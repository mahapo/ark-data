This satellite array can determine thelocation of radio and radars transmmitters,using triangulation, and the identity of navalunits, by analysis of the operating frequenciesand transmission patterns. NOSS used theELINT (Electronic Intelligence) techniquecalled 'time difference of arrival,' TDOA, ratherthan true interferometry.\"- Space Policy Agency: Military Space Programs aboutWhite Cloud NOSSApril 27, 2002 Dover, Arkansas - Since my Earthfiles and Coast to Coast AMradio report on April 23-24, 2002, I have received several e-mails from viewersabout the United States Naval Ocean Surveillance System (NOSS) satellitegroup as an explanation for the April 14, 2002 moving triangle of \"stars\" sightingdescribed in the 04/22/02 Earthfiles. These satellites were not acknowledgedby the United States government as officially existing prior to 1996, even thoughthe first experimental ones were launched in the early 1970s. Even today, fornational security reasons, Navy intelligence does not want information aboutNOSS known in the general public. Aiding that secrecy, the trios of satellites arenot easily seen with the naked human eye.The following is an excerpt submitted by Ted Molczan in a document\"containing my analysis which shows that NOSS 2-1 was observed at PineyRiver valley, Arkansas on 2002 April 14 CDT.\"Summary of Pass DetailsDate: Sunday, 14 April, 2002Satellite: NOSS 2-1 (C)Observer's Location: Dover ( 35.4010°N, 93.1140°W)Local Time: Central Daylight Time (GMT - 5:00)Orbit: 877 x 1,338 km, 63.4° (Epoch 23 Apr)Sun altitude at time of maximum pass altitude: -36.1°Event Time Altitude Azimuth Distance (km)Rises above horizon 22:58:23 0° 327° (NNW) 4,041Reaches 10° altitude 23:01:00 10° 327° (NNW) 3,140Maximum altitude 23:07:51 73° 303° (WNW) 1,324Enters shadow 23:07:51 73° 303° (WNW) 1,324 04/26/02 E-Mail from Ted Molczan, Energy Analyst Consultant, Toronto,Ontario, Canada:\"NOSS Background"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Based on many years of experience as an amateur astronomer specializing in 'spysatellites,' the description of the Piney River valley event led me to suspect thatone of the three 2nd generation NOSS triads had been observed. These objectsusually are visible only in binoculars, but occasionally they are bright enough tobe seen with the unaided eye.NOSS means Naval Ocean Surveillance System. The operational system consistsof several triads of satellites flying in a triangular formation. They are believed tobe able to determine the position of ships at sea using a method known as TDOA(Time Difference of Arrival).It works roughly as follows. Each member of the triad carries a radio receiverand a very accurate clock. All three satellites' clocks are closely synchronized.Their radios detect radio transmissions from ships at sea. Since each satellite in atriad is at a different distance from a ship's radio transmitter, each will receivethe signal at a slightly different time. Knowing the precise location of eachsatellite and the difference in the time of signal arrival enables the solution of aset of equations that yields an accurate determination of the ship's co-ordinates.The first experimental NOSS triad was launched late in 1971. The firstoperational launch occurred in 1976, followed by seven more successfullaunches through 1986. The 1986 triad is still operational, as evidenced by theiroccasional small orbit adjustment manoeuvres, detected by amateur satellitetrackers.Those early NOSS satellites are quite small, such that they are best seen usinglarge aperture binoculars, such as 11x80. Only rarely do the early NOSSbrighten sufficiently to be visible to the unaided eye. I witnessed one such eventin the late 1980's.In 1990, the first of a second generation of NOSS were launched. Those objectsare two or three orders of magnitudes brighter than the first generation NOSS.They are readily visible in 7X50 binoculars. Most of the time they are too faintto be seen with the unaided eye, but like their first generation cousins, they dooccasionally brighten sufficiently to be seen easily with the unaided eye. Thishappens much more often than with the first generation.The second and third successful 2nd generation NOSS launches took place in1991 and 1996. The latter event was well placed for observation by amateurs,who were able to document much of the 28 day long deployment sequence.September 2001 saw the launch of possible third generation NOSS triad. A thirdgeneration was suspected in large part because of the move to a different boosterrocket. Thus far, there has been an element of mystery about this launch,because only two satellites have appeared. They fly in formation in a standardNOSS orbit and are about as bright as the 2nd generation NOSS. I speculate thatthere are only two because one may have failed to deploy. We should be able totest this hunch later this year, when another launch using the same rocket isexpected. Relationship of NOSS to the Piney River Valley SightingU.S. Space Command does not publish its orbital elements of NOSS and thehundreds of other spy satellites and related debris, so the only publicly availableelements are those produced by the handful of amateur observers and analystswho routinely track and update their orbits.I maintain a database of many hundreds of such orbital elements spanningalmost the entire history of the 2nd generation NOSS. In order to determinewhether or not it was NOSS that were seen at Piney River valley, I used my orbitprediction program to compute the time and path of all three 2nd generationNOSS relative that location."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I found that the 1990 triad, which we call NOSS 2-1, was an excellent match tothe observations.

The path, direction of travel, and duration oftravel are in excellent agreement with the description of the eyewitnesses at thePiney River valley. Ephemeris Summary ExplanationAt the first entry in the ephemeris, 23:04:31 CDT, the triad passed just north ofthe boundary of the constellation Auriga. Over the next nearly 3.5 minutes itpassed through Lynx, Camelopardalis and Ursa Major (the constellation thatcontains the Big Dipper). It was heading toward Leo Major, but at about23:07:55 CDT, as it reached Leo Minor, it entered the penumbra of Earth'sshadow.I note that the time of the events is about 2.5 to 3 minutes later than reported,but it is common for wristwatches to be off by several minutes, so that is not amajor difference.There is also a discrepancy in one of the reported directions of travel, from\"northeast to southwest\". The NOSS traveled from northwest to a bit south ofeast. Directions can easily be misjudged under the circumstances, especiallysince the objects were seen over only a part of their arc across the sky. I placegreater weight on the description of their path relative the constellations, sincethey were plainly visible.After entering the penumbra, over the next 5 seconds or so, it would haverapidly faded from naked eye visibility. Just eleven seconds after entering thepenumbra, it entered the umbra, and faded totally from view. From the vantagepoint of the satellite, one would have seen the sun set in 11 seconds!Note that this fadeout began as the objects reached 74 degrees elevation, whichis nearly overhead, just as described by Nancy Martin in the original 04/22/02Earthfiles report.Ms. Martin, watching through binoculars, also observed that they faded 'justslightly behind each other,' which I can confirm with the predicted penumbraand umbra entry times of all three triad members.

The R.A. angles are expressed in units of hours andminutes, and DEC angles are in degrees and minutes of arc.On rare occasions, NOSS have been known to flare brilliantly, as in this 1996report by Craig Cholar, of the same triad seen by the Piney River valleyobservers: \"Imagine seeing Venus in formation with itself separated by less than7 degrees, with Saturn trailing along; that's what the spectacle looked like.\"http://satobs.org/seesat/Sep-1996/0056.html I hope this will prove helpful in understanding the Piney River valley event inArkansas on April 14, 2002, 11:02-11:05 p.m. CDT.If you would like to observe a NOSS pass, I would be pleased to providepredictions for your location. Let me know when you expect to have a clearnight. Binoculars of at least 7x35 and preferably 7x50 are required, because theobjects seldom are as bright as they were on 14 April. Also, it would help if youhave a star map. Alternatively, I can direct you to the Heavens-Above web site,which has all of our NOSS elements, and provides excellent predictions,including charts.Best wishes,Te d M o l c z a nToronto, CanadaMolczan@hotmail.com2002 Apr 26\" Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
