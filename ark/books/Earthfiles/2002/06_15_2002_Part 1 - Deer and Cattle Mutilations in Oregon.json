June 15, 2002 Grants Pass, Oregon Oregon now has two active mutilationregions: the Christmas Valley east of Bend (See Earthfiles 05/15/02) and theApplegate Valley in the Siskiyou National Forest south of Grants Pass. OnMonday night, June 10 around midnight, graphic artist Dwain Wright and hiswife were getting ready for bed when their five outdoor cats came running insidethe house in a panic. The Wrights live on an isolated hilltop in the forest andthought coyotes or other natural predators might have scared their cats. LaterMrs. Wright woke up to see a bright light outside, but went back to sleep.

By Wednesday morning, June 12, Dwain noticed buzzards circling low about200 feet from his house and went to investigate. He was shocked to find a deerlying on top of 3-foot-tall fescue grass that was flattened and swirled under thedead and mutilated doe."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Young doe dead and mutilated lying on flattened,swirled fescue grass 200 feet from the Dwain Wright home on the mountaintop in Applegate Valley, Oregon.

It was lying with its right side, right eye, faceup and the right eye was missing as were the lips."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Doe's right and left eyes and tear ducts removed along with hide from the right sideof the jaw and the tongue. All teeth were present. Digital image © 2002 by Dwain Wright.I noticed there was a puncture wound behind the front leg. At first I thoughtmaybe it was a gunshot. But it didn't go through. And then looking through thehole, I noticed that all the internal organs were missing. There was an incisionaround the rear portion a large portion of the rear was missing and whatever hadbeen removed. There was no blood. That was the other odd thing.Hole in doe's right rib cage surrounded by dark color,\"as if the hair had been rubbed off with something that left a stain,\"Dwain Wright said. Same dark discoloration was around the left leg andright flank holes. Digital image © 2002 by Dwain Wright.A bloodless long excision was made between the rear right legand doe's belly. Digital image © 2002 by Dwain Wright.A hole cut in the doe's front left leg exposed pinkish boneand the odd stain around the cut as with the other excisions on the abdomen.Digital image © 2002 by Dwain Wright.The State Police Fish & Game people came from two different counties andwere a little suspicious and first tried to explain it away as a cougar death. And Isaid, 'I've been here 14 years and I know when cougar attack deer, they generallybite them on the neck and there are claw marks on both sides. That wasn't thecase."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Then they tried to explain it away as small arms (gunshot wound). I said, 'No.'When they looked at the hole behind the front leg, they noticed that none of theribs were missing or broken. Where the hole was, it would have gone through arib.Meaning the police meant that somebody might have shot this deer?Yes. Then they tried to explain away the brilliant light my wife saw as being aspotlight from a poacher. But we know this entire area and there is no onearound here that would poach a deer because there are so many deer anyonecould shoot one in their front yard with a bow and arrow. The deer are thattame.Back to that hole and looking into the rib cage.A police officer noticed that the internal organs were missing. He looked insidewith a flashlight. He said, ''There's nothing in here.'No internal organs at all?No. Part of the large intestine was intact because you could see the excrement inthe back.But a space between ribs would not be big enough to get the heart out,would it?I don't know. Not normally.Did either of the state patrol game officers investigating make anycomment about the unusual bloodless excisions surrounded by the darkdiscoloration?No. He tried to bluff me, basically. I explained that I have a Ph.D. from UCLAand spent the first two years in Fish & Game management. I was aware of my 14years here on this property about what happens to animals and animal woundsand how quickly it happens. Before that, they tried to tell me that birds simplyswooped down and popped the eyes right out and flew off with them.I have tried to take eyeballs out of animals in the past that we've eitherbutchered or found dead and it's a very difficult operation to get an eye out of asocket.And it would be messy.Very messy. Eyeballs are very strong. It's all tendons and muscles. It's verydifficult to cut one apart or to excise from a eye socket.\" Left Eyeball and Tear Duct Removed After Dwain Wright First Found Deer\"One puzzling thing is that when I first found the deer and took pictures, Ilooked under its head to see if both eyes were missing. I noticed the left eye wasstill intact. I went back to the house and returned about two hours later with mycamera again. The deer had been turned over and the left eye was then cut likethe one on the right, eyeball out and tear duct taken, exactly the same way. Butthey were all there two hours before. My wife was working in her small grapevineyard the whole time about 100 feet away, yet she did not see or hearanything.\" After State Police Left, Small Plane Circles\"What happened after the two Oregon State Patrol game officers hadchecked out the deer?After they left, I would imagine most of the state police vehicles have global"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"positioning sensors in them so they know where their officers are at all times.After they left about 45 minutes or an hour after they were gone, a single engineaircraft came in low from the east and made a very sharp turn right above thetrees, about 200 to 300 feet off the ground right above where the deer waslocated below it. Then went low across the valley to the south and disappeared.It obviously took photographs, but I don't know who it was or what it was.\"To be continued in Part 2.More Information:1) Soil and Plants To Be Tested, But No NecropsyDwain Wright contacted me by e-mail with some of his images on Wednesdaynight, June 12. The next day, Thursday, June 13, I contacted biophysicist W. C.Levengood about getting plant and soil samples from around the deer's body. Heagreed and Dwain Wright collected samples per Levengood's instructions andshipped them to Levengood's lab in Michigan for study.Further, I contacted Colm Kellerher, biologist, at the National Institute forDiscovery Science (NIDS) about getting a veterinarian to the scene to do anecropsy. Colm ultimately talked with the Ashland Veterinarian ForensicsLaboratory not far from Applegate Valley. Colm called to tell me that the labwas open to doing a necropsy on the deer for NIDS, but that Oregon stategovernment protocol required that Fish & Game authorities first investigatebefore signing off on transportation to the Ashland laboratory.The two Oregon State Patrol game officers who saw the deer and talked withDwain Wright told him, \"the forensics lab in Ashland would be too backed upwith projects from around the world to take time on something as small scale asthe deer.I asked him if the officers were saying they wouldn't even approve having thedeer transferred to the Ashland laboratory because it would not have anypriority there?Dwain said, \"That's correct.\"When Biophysicist W. C. Levengood has information to report about the fescuegrass and soil collected for analysis, I will report at Earthfiles.com and in radioreports.2) Dwain Wright Saw A Mutilated Bull in 1980I reported in my book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness© 1998 another experience of Dwain Wright's which first exposed him to theanimal mutilation mystery.From pages 169-170: \"In 1980 east of Bend, Oregon, then 34-year-old DwainWright had joined a friend on a hunting trip. Wright, who received a Ph.D. inPsychology from UCLA and a Masers Degree in Graphic Design, went along toenjoy the beauty of the outdoors, not to hunt. The men were in a place calledSand Springs where forest and open range desert meet. The year before in thatsame area, Wright had discovered a dead cow wedged in the upper limbs of ahuge Ponderosa pine tree. He never learned what happened. This time he wentoff to explore again on his own and stopped at some cattle watering tanks. In a1994 interview, Dwain Wright told me what happened.\"This old cowboy came walking out of the woods nearby. He had a small traveltrailer back there so he could keep an eye on the cattle. Out in open range likethat, rustlers could steal pretty easy. We got into a conversation about cattle andthen he asked me, 'Do you believe in flying saucers?' And I said that I did. And"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"he said, 'Well, they come across the desert here at night. I want to show yousomething.' He took me to another area and there was a dead bull pressed intothe ground as if it had been dropped from a great height.\"\"And he said they came at night (glowing discs). The cattle were just drawn up.They floated right up off the ground. He had seen it happen. And he said thatsometime later, they just dropped them back down onto the desert or throughthe trees into the forest. And he said you could hear them at night making ahorrendous crash through the trees.\"Eyew itness Dwain Wright, a graphic designer from Grants Pass, Oregon.\"This photo was taken in 1978 or 1979. The canyon behind me was where I saw a cow in thetop of a huge Ponderosa pine tree, caught in the upper limbs.\" This is same area he met cowboy and sawmutilated bull pressed into the ground, \"dropped from glowing discs,\" according to the old cowboy.Photograph provided by Dwain Wright.
