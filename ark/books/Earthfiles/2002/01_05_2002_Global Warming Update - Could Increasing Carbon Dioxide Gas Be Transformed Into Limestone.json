The unpredictable consequence could be rapid globalclimatechange and many plant and animal extinctions.The Philadelphia Inquirer, December 18, 2001, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.January 5, 2002 New York City, New York - In a Dreamland radio newsreport at the end of 2001, I talked with a Columbia University scientist aboutthe risk of rapid global climate change as cars and industries put more and morecarbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. (See Earthfiles12/22/01.) Industries and motor vehicles over the last century between 1900 and2000 put 280 billion tons of carbon from carbon dioxide into the earth'satmosphere and oceans. That blanket of CO2 is warming the planet now and isexpected to keep getting thicker and warmer throughout the next hundred years.The unpredictable consequence could be rapid global climate change and manyplant and animal extinctions.Further, when you add up all the industrial and auto emissions together in theUnited States now, each American is adding CO2 to the atmosphere at the rateof 22 tons per person each year. At that rate, the amount of carbon dioxide thatbuilds up like a blanket around the earth could rise from 370 parts per milliontoday to more than 600 parts per million by the end of this century. Computerclimate models all predict that such an increase in carbon dioxide would causegreat changes in the global weather and change the acidity of ocean waters somuch that coral and many other marine creatures will die off.That much CO2 increase over the next several decades also means we could"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"increase the average mean temperature of the earth as much as 10.5 degreesFahrenheit. That's how much it took the earth to warm up over the past eleventhousand years since the last Ice Age. What will happen if the earth warms upthat much in only 100 years? Atmospheric physicists say this is like playingRussian roulette with the world's future.The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in associationwith the U. N. Environment Program (UNEP) and World Meteological Organization(WMO),projects three possible global average temperature ranges between 2000 and 2100, allgetting warmer.

He is Dr. Klaus Lackner, Professorof Geophysics in the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering atColumbia University in New York City. Dr. Lackner grew up in Germany andreceived his Ph.D. equivalent in particle physics at the University of Heidelberg.He has held post-doctoral positions at the California Institute of Technology andStanford University's Linear Accelerator. Then he worked at the Los AlamosNational Laboratory from 1983 until 2001 when he transferred to ColumbiaUniversity. He is seriously worried about the CO2 build up around our planet,thinks that humans will be dependent upon fossil fuels for at least anothercentury, is trying to solve the greenhouse problem with physics - and evenWashington, D. C. is beginning to listen.Interview:Klaus S. Lackner, Ph.D., Ewing Worzel Prof. of Geophysics, Dept. of Earthand Environmental Engineering, Columbia University, New York City,New York: \"I believe that in order to have energy for the next one hundredyears or so, we will have to reach a point where we have what I call a net zerocarbon economy. For all the carbon dioxide that we generate and send out, wehave to have an equal amount of carbon captured and disposed of safely andpermanently. In order to accomplish that, I am working on a number of projectswhich together are trying to first capture the carbon dioxide and then safely andpermanently put it away.And we have suggested in a very long term, the very best way of getting rid of itis as a solid. And it turns out that there are plenty of minerals out there that arerich in magnesium oxides, magnesium silicates, that can react with carbondioxide and form magnesium carbonate (limestone) and silica (quartz) whichcomes out as sand.So, we now have a way of permanently tying up that CO2 as a solid. Thereaction is exothermic so it doesn't consume any energy if it is done right. And itis thermodynamically stable once you have formed it, you need a substantialamount of energy to undo it so you can be absolutely sure that over time this"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"will not leak back into the atmosphere. It is a permanent and safe disposal.Can you please explain first how you would go about getting carbondioxide out of the atmosphere?You can get carbon dioxide in two places. One is you can try to collect it at thesource of emissions, such as a power plant for example. There are a number ofpeople who are trying that with various projects. I am also looking at the optionof directly taking the carbon dioxide back from the air.You know that can be done because that in effect is what a tree is doing. Webelieve we can do this much more efficiently than you would do that way. Forexample, you can use lime water which is a good absorbent and as the air movesover that, the CO2 in the air will be absorbed by that lime water and turned intolimestone.Since this is a planet motivated by making money, is there anything thatwould be an incentive to companies to do this process and makemagnesium carbonate? Can we do something with magnesium carbonate?You may be able to use some of it as building material. You may also have sidebenefits from the operation which provided you the magnesium silicate in thefirst place. For example, very often there are iron oxides associated with that.But I would caution you this may help you in the transition phase. In the longterm, keep in mind you have to tie up 22 tons of carbon dioxide per person inthe U. S. and by the time you have tied it up, you have made on the order of 50tons per person per year. There is hardly anything short of water that weconsume on that scale. So, it seems to me in the long term this becomes adisposal issue and a financial incentive has to come from some form ofregulations which basically allow you to trade carbon permits against carboncredits where you have put CO2 away. I would like to call that a Certificate ofSequestration.Meaning there would be some sort of reward for those countries and areasthat were using this process to reduce the CO2 emission?And one of the advantages of the air extraction approach would be that it allowsnew companies to enter into this field and turn it into a business, providedsomebody is paying for the service they render. Which then means that somehow or other, society has to come up with a way of having these kinds ofprocesses paid for. We do this routinely in other areas today. We already havesulfur trade for sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants. That is in somesense different because here you buy a right of pollution. We also do the samething with the sewer system. Nobody today argues that we don't have to pay forhaving a sewer line from our house to a system which treats it before it goes outto a river.We are already dealing with other emissions having to do with smog andother problems on the planet and we have been for quite awhile. Thiswould simply be another application of technology to reduce CO2 in theatmosphere which is a problem that no one knows how to deal with,meaning we are not going to be able to cut back the need for fossil fuelsover this century because it is the only real viable large energy producerthat we still have?That is correct. I believe we have vast amounts of fossil energy available. I thinkthe discussion currently going on whether or not oil runs out misses the point.We have enough coal, tar and shale to last us many centuries at a cost which ishardly more than it is today. So as a result whether we like it or not, fossil fuel isgoing to be a major player for the next 100 years and we better figure out meansof dealing with the environmental impact. So, what I am saying is that whateverstorage you use, it has to last a long time compared to a thousand years.That's why magnesium carbonate would be good for a permanent, solidstorage.It is so attractive. It's permanent. It's solid. And it's thermodynamically stable."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"You can see that because entire mountain ranges are made out of the stuff today.Dolomites are a mixture, the Dolomite mountains are essentially a mixture ofcalcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate.We might be able to use that residue to build things with in the future.You might. On the other hand, the amounts we would be creating per person arevery, very large. This is more than we consume concrete or even aggregate.We would be building new mountains with magnesium carbonate.Yes, but don't forget they are replacing mountains of magnesium silicates!We would know that those mountains stood as testimony to humaningenuity in facing a crisis of the atmosphere and transferring that CO2blanket build up into mountains on the earth which couldn't hurt us.They couldn't hurt us. But on the other hand, you have to admit up front, theyare large. And I cannot help that because the amount of fossil carbon we areextracting from the earth is large. We are talking on the order of cubic kilometersof oil that we are burning on an annual basis.Because people can't see it, they don't realize what we are building up inthe atmosphere, invisible to our eyes, but equally as solid and massive asmountain ranges.It is as massive as mountain ranges. The issue ultimately will be can we, what arethe compromises we are willing to make in order to have energy? And we haveto come to a system which is environmentally acceptable. And rather thandiluting the CO2 over the planet and causing all sorts of consequences becauseCO2 is a greenhouse gas. It is physiologically active and plays a major role inthe environment. Changing it, doubling it, tripling it, is simply not an acceptableway of dealing with it. So we have to find other ways of storing it.In the interest of national and global security, have you been in anydiscussions in Washington, D. C. with political people about this idea andwhether the U. S. would be prepared to try to go forward with this idea?My impression of the response is that generally people are favorably inclined.They like to see more data to prove that this can be done, but I think a large partof the impasse is that we don't see technological solutions to this problem. Byproviding them (with one), I think we can get beyond that. If you listen to thedebate, I think it is generally accepted that the stabilization of CO2 in theatmosphere ultimately will have to be achieved. The question, the debate ismore about what level is that? How far is that out?Meaning in terms of a time line?In terms of a time line and also the levels of CO2 in the atmosphere that peoplewould be willing to tolerate. Would we have to stop at 400 ppm? I don't thinkwe can achieve that anymore because the time has run out on that.We're already at 370 ppm.So, could we get to 500 or 600 ppm? I think everybody agrees that we will haveto stabilize at a point. I would like to make it very clear that this is a differentfrom sulfur emissions where all we have to do is keep the rate of emissionconstant from where it is today. If we held the rate of emission constant (onCO2), we would still have a problem. We are filling up a cup and we are fillingit higher and higher. And in the end, we have to reduce CO2 emissions toessentially zero if we want to succeed. If you want to stabilize CO2 levels in theatmosphere and excess carbon in the environment, we will have to go to asystem in which the CO2 emitter is compensated for more or less completely.But isn't the big question here that we are already at 2002 and that's only98 years to the end of this century. And we are approaching 400 ppm CO2in the atmosphere and the atmospheric physicists are already warning thatif we get to 600 ppm, it is an open question about whether we are gettinginto territory in which the earth itself could switch into one of these rapidreorganizations of rapid climate change that have happened in 5 to 10years in the past and cause such revolutionary change of drought, toomuch water, flooding, no crops all of those things could kick in. I don't see"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"that we have a lot of time to debate what we can do.There is no question that we are moving into a new regime which is ratherdifferent from what we have seen in the last tens of millions of years. And this isnew territory and I would like to add to what you said that it is not just theclimate change. The extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will undoubtedlyacidify the surface oceans. That has consequences for coral reefs which havenothing to do whatsoever with the change in temperature or change in climate.So, we completely change the major material cycles on the earth by basicallyadding an unprecedented amount of carbon, free mobile carbon, into the system.What you are saying is that sense the oceans are the largest element toabsorb CO2 right now along with trees, as CO2 levels go up and more andmore go into the oceans, lakes and water systems, that it's going to changethe alkaline or acidity of the oceans to the point that it could destroy thecoral?That's correct. The amount of uncertainty we are creating is very large. And I ampointing out that we are always focused on the climate change issues. But thereare these other marine issues as well.\"More Information:Statistics To Consider:At current rate of carbon dioxide emissions, in 100 years 600 billion tons ofcarbon in the form of CO2 will have been put into the earth's atmosphere.If CO2 emissions grow at a rate equivalent to the 20th century's carbon dioxideincrease which grew roughly by a factor of 12 between 1900 and 2000, theamount of CO2 in the atmosphere could jump from 600 billion to anywherebetween 2000 to 3000 billion tons.If you add a 1000 to 1500 billion tons of carbon in the form of carbon dioxideto the ocean, you will change the pH chemistry of the ocean from top to bottomby a significant .3."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"We b s it e s :http://www.ipcc.chhttp://www.co2science.orghttp://www.co2science.org/center.htmhttp://www.epa.gov/globalwarming/emissions/national/co2.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
