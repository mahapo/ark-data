But there was at least one such incident almost 80 yearsago, according to a story in a newspaper published at that time. The strangeepisode reportedly took place in mid-April of 1897 on a farm in Kansas andinvolved the theft of a cow by the UFO, right before the farmer's eyes! The news story, published in the Woodson County Advocate on April 23, 1897,relates the following incident, as told by the farmer, Alexander Hamilton, ofVernon:\"Last Monday night about half past ten o'clock, we were awakened by anoise among the cattle. I arose, thinking perhaps my bulldog wasperforming some of his pranks, but upon getting to the door, I saw to myamazement, an airship slowly descending over my cow lot about 50 rodsfrom the house. Calling Gib Heslop, my tenant, and my son, Wall, weseized some axes and ran to the corral. Meanwhile, the ship had beengently descending until it was no more than 30 feet above the groundand we came up within 50 yards of it. \"It consisted of a great cigar-shaped portion, possibly 300 feet long, witha carriage underneath. The carriage was made of panels of glass orother transparent substance, alternating with a narrow strip of someother material. It was brilliantly lighted within and everything wasclearly visible. there were three lights, one like an immense searchlightand two smaller - one red and the other green. The largest wassusceptible of being turned in any direction. It was occupied by six ofthe strangest beings I ever saw. There were two men, a woman and threechildren. They were jabbering together, but we could not understand asyllable they said. \"Every part of the vessel that was not transparent was a dark reddishcolor. We stood mute in wonder and fright when some noise attractedour attention and they turned their light directly upon us. Immediatelyupon catching sight of us, they turned on some unknown power and agreat turbine wheel about thirty feet in diameter which was slowlyrevolving below the craft began to buzz, sounding precisely like thecylinder of a separator, and the vessel rose as lightly as a bird. \"When about 300 feet above us, it seemed to pause and hover directlyover a three-year-old heifer which was bawling and jumping apparentlyfast in the fence. Going to her, we found a cable about a half-inch inthickness, made of some red material fastened in a slip knot around herneck, one end passing up to the vessel and tangled in the wire. We tried"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"to get her off, but could not. So, we cut the (fence) wire loose and stoodin amazement to see the cow, ship and all rise slowly and sail off,disappearing in the northwest. We went home, but I was frightened andcould not sleep. \"I rose early Tuesday morning, mounted my horse and started out hopingto find some trace of my cow. This I failed to do, but coming back toLeRoy in the evening, I found that Lank Thomas, who lives in CoffeyCounty about three or four miles west of LeRoy, had found the hind legsand head in his field that day. He, thinking someone had butchered astolen beast and thrown the hide away, had brought it to town foridentification. But he was greatly mystified in not being able to find anytrack of any kind on the soft ground. \"I went home that night, but every time I would drop off to sleep, I wouldsee that cursed thing with its big lights and hideous people. I don't knowwhether they were devils or angels or what, but we all saw them and mywhole family saw the ship and I don't want any more to do with them.\" The farmer's description of the craft bears a strong resemblance to those given bymany who have seen UFOs in recent years. But what makes the 1897 accounteven more startling is that it happened almost seven years before the WrightBrothers made history with the first recorded airplane flight. And space travelwas yet an undreamed of event of the future! If the past was puzzling, so was the present, as reports continued to come induring the spring of 1976. Several incidents happened within a day or two of thefirst of May, which may or may not be significant. Two cases of cattle mutilationwere reported to the Cascade County Sheriff's Office on April 29. One involveda cow belonging to a Castner Falls rancher. The Black Angus cow had beendead too many days for a successful autopsy, but it was obvious to theinvestigating officers that the tongue, an eye, an ear and the lips were gone. Therectal area may have also been cut out. the cow's head and neck had apparentlybeen bent back at an angle to the right and a white fiber-looking substancecovered one side of the cow. It resembled the petroleum distillate found on thecalf in Judith Basin County, but laboratory tests proved it was not the samesubstance. The other mutilated animal was a yearling steer belonging to a Simms arearancher. The rectal area appeared to be cut and there was what appeared to be apuncture mark on the right side of the carcass. The veterinarian who performedan autopsy on the steer noted that the steer had been eating up to the time of itsdeath and had apparently been in good health. An unusual factor, not encountered before, was a ruptured area about fourinches across on the inside of the chest cavity. There was also a rupture the fulllength of the body on the animal's right side. The veterinarian commented thatthe ruptures were unusual. There were no external bruises. Adding another note of mystery to the investigation was a report by a neighborwoman of the man who owned the steer that she had heard a \"funny noise\" threenights earlier which frightened her. She said she was home alone watchingtelevision about 11:30 p.m., when she noted that there seemed to be a lot oftraffic going by. She turned off the lights, leaving on the television, so she couldwatch for lights. It was at this time that she heard an odd noise, which she described as a whirringsound, going on and off intermittently. It was not loud, but continued for aboutten minutes. Since the veterinarian estimated the steer had been dead two orthree days, it is possible the noise the woman heard was the same night the steerwas killed. The night after officers investigated the mutilated steer (April 30, 1976), they"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"received a phone call from a woman in the Fife area reporting a group of flyingobjects maneuvering over her community. She watched the objects throughbinoculars and said they appeared to have yellow, green and blue lights aroundthe outside of the craft and that their centers seemed to glow. They appeared tobe headed south at a high rate of speed, she said. She added that she had seensuch craft before, but had not reported them. In a later conversation with thewoman, Captain Wolverton learned that she often watches airplanes andhelicopters and is familiar with them. She said she never phoned in a reportunless she was unable to identify the craft. A Great Falls couple, parked on a country road near Great Falls about 3 a.m.,were badly frightened when they saw a UFO that did a disappearing act. Theincident happened about May 1, 1976, but was not reported until two weekslater. The couple told Captain Wolverton that they had just parked on anapproach road and turned off their lights when they noticed a small triangular-shaped object hovering about four feet above the ground very close to their carand ahead of it. It glowed with a blue light. They described the size of the objectas about one foot by two feet. When the car headlights were turned on, the object disappeared. When thelights were turned off, it appeared. The procedure was repeated three or fourtimes, but when the object seemed to be coming closer to them, the coupleturned on their lights and engine and \"took off\" in a hurry! The incident wassimilar to one Captain Wolverton had heard about in another state. The strange sounds attributed to the hairy creatures cropped up again in a reportto the Cascade County Sheriff's Office on May 7, 1976. A man whose ranch is inthe vicinity of Gore Hill, location of the Great Falls International Airport,phoned to say that he was out feeding stock early that morning when he heard awailing-moaning sound. It was very loud and he thought it was close, but couldnot determine the direction from which it came. He said his horses acted strangeand restless. When Captain Wolverton played a tape recorded (of Sasquatch howls?) in thePuyallup, Washington, area of the strange sounds heard there, the man said,\"That is exactly what I heard.\" Captain Wolverton and Undersheriff Osbornechecked the area carefully, but nothing was found. The reports continued to come in and with them came the theories andspeculations. Some people have said in all sincerity that they consider thestrange events to be signs of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ or the end of theworld, as foretold in the Bible's Book of Revelation. this theory, like the others,has been neither discounted nor endorsed by those conducting the investigation. A man who is, and has been, a professional government trapper for 18 years wasasked his opinion as to whether predators could have caused the mutilations. Hesaid that when coyotes feed on a dead animal, they do not take the hide, norwill they start in an area where they have to break the hide. He said they wouldeat three to four pounds of meat in one or two days, but would not eat theentrails if any meat was exposed. He based his opinion on his experience inexamining over 2,000 animals killed by predators over the years. Investigating officers appreciate the comments of anyone who thinks he or shemay have information which could possibly help solve the mystery. They areespecially grateful to those cooperative residents who have reported cattlemutilations or sightings of UFOs or hairy creatures. Without this help, theywould be unable to assemble the evidence that they hope will lead to aneventual solution. \"I want people to know,\" Captain Wolverton said, \"that our department, under adirective from Sheriff John Krsul, is looking at this whole situation asserious.\" Captain Wolverton urged anyone who might have something unusual to report"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"to phone their local law enforcement officers or get in touch with him. It is onlyby continuing to follow every lead, to investigate every incident, that lawmenwill be able to solve the mystery of cattle mutilations and other strange incidentsthat are plaguing Montana and other areas. Epilogue his book, in a sense, has no ending. It can't have as long as the story it tells isnot solved. At this writing, no one has produced proof as to who, or what, ismutilating cattle, or why. And although there have been many conjectures, someof them most convincing, no one has yet proved the identity and origin of theunidentified flying objects. Or the hairy creatures (Bigfoot/Sasquatch) Themystery goes on and on, with new bits of the puzzle added now and then tofurther perplex those who are striving so hard to solve it. One fact is certain. The officers in the Cascade County Sheriff's Department,from Sheriff John Krsul on down, take the strange incidents seriously and theyare conducting a serious investigation. They realize, of course, that there aretimes when a person's imagination plays tricks on him. And they also leave roomto discount calls from pranksters. But the men who have investigated the strangeepisodes related here have seen and heard too much to casually disregard it.They believe those persons who say they have seen hairy creatures or UFOs. Infact, some of the officers have seen UFOs themselves. As for the cattle mutilations, the officers have observed too many strangelybutchered cows to mark it all up to natural causes or predators. There has to bean explanation for the strange and frightening incidents and a solution to thesyndrome of puzzling events. Those in the Cascade County Sheriff's Departmenthave no intention of giving up before they unravel the mystery - no matter howlong it takes. They feel strongly that local sheriff's officers will probably be thepeople responsible for solving the mutilation mystery, when and if it is solved.At that time, this book might have a sequel.
