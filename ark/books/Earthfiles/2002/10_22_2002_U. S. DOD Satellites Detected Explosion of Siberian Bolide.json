DOD SatellitesDetected Explosion of Siberian Bolide© 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe\"U.S. satellites detected the impact of a bolide near Bodiabo(Bodajbo) in Siberia at 16:48:56 UTC (12:48:56 EDT) on 24September 2002. The object was simultaneously detected by bothvisible wavelength and IR (infrared) sensors. The object was firstdetected at 57.91 North Latitude, 112.90 East Longitude at analtitude of approximately 62 kilometers (38.5 miles). It was trackedto 58.21 N, 113.46 E at an altitude of approximately 30 kilometers(18.6 miles). The observed visible wavelength peak intensity was 2.4x 10^11 Watts/ster. The total radiated energy was 8.6 x 10^11 Joules(6000K black body).\"- Peter Brown, Ph.D., Physicist, Univ. of Western Ontario, CanadaPresumed bolide explosion on September 24, 2002, during the Russiannight at 58.21N, 113.46 E near Bodajbo, Siberia, Russia. October 21, 2002 London, Ontario, Canada - On September 24, 2002 at12:48:56 EDT and 16:48:56 UTC, night time in Russia, American Department ofDefense satellites detected the explosion of a presumed bolide approximately18.6 miles above Bodajbo, Siberia, Russia (58.21 N, 113.46E). The explosionwas equivalent to 100,000 tons of TNT, or a meteorite about three meters indiameter burning up in the earth's atmosphere.A Canadian scientist who receives notification from American DOD satelliteoperations about meteor and bolide (large and bright) events is Dr. Peter Brown,Physicist and Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy atthe University of Western Ontario in London, Ontario, Canada. Today, I askedhim to explain what happened.Interview:Peter Brown, Ph.D., Physicist and Assistant Professor, Canada Research"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Chair in Meteor Science, Department of Physics and Astronomy,University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, Canada: \"It's a satellitesystem that detects looking at the hemisphere of the earth. Basically whathappens is whenever there is a bright flash, the satellite detects or produces asignal that can be seen on the ground. Obviously, it's used for other purposes,for military purposes, and does detect any bright flashes. It can detect lightning,it can detect fireballs, that sort of thing.WE HAVE BEEN USING THE SATELLITES TO TRY TO KEEP TRACK OFWHETHER OR NOT THERE IS ANY NUCLEAR TESTING OREXPLOSIONS ON THE PLANET, CORRECT?Yes, that is certainly one of the missions that this uses, looking for any kind ofmilitary explosion or activity of interest that generates optical radiation in theatmosphere. So, in this particular case, the satellites detected this object both invisible wavelengths and infrared sensors at 16:48:56 on September 24th.WHICH IS?16:48:56 is Greenwich time. So, it's the time in Greenwich in England, alsoknown as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). So for an East Coast audience, thatwould be the equivalent of 12:48:56 p.m. EDT.RIGHT AFTER NOON TIME HERE.Right, and it was deep night time in Siberia.WHAT WAS THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY RELEASED ON THIS SATELLITEIMAGE COMPARED TO NUCLEAR DETONATIONS?The satellite data suggests the total radiated energy of 8.6 times 10 to the 11thJoules. That's the equivalent of 200 metric tons of TNT explosive that wasradiated optically. That is not the total energy of the object. That is the amountof energy that the actual satellites' sensors detected. That is somewhere between1/5th or more likely 1/10th of the total energy. So, the estimate of the totalactual kinetic energy of the object would be about 2,000 tons TNT equivalent,or two kilotons, and that equates to something of the order of 1/10th the size ofthe Hiroshima nuclear explosion.THAT SUGGESTS WHAT SIZE BODY WOULD HAVE MADE THISEXPLOSION?Without additional data, we can't say definitively, but if you were to use someaverages, like for example, assuming an average velocity near 20kilometers/second which is typical for a near earth object population, taking thatkind of average and taking a 1 to 10 conversion for the optical total energy. So,we're assuming the total energy is about 2 kilotons of TNT. Taking those twoassumptions, we can then make some estimates of where that would put us. Fora 2 kiloton object, we would be looking at something in the neighborhood - oh,an object about 10 feet across, 3 meters across, something like that.DID THE DEFENSE DEPARTMENT IMAGE CONFIRM THAT THISOBJECT EXPLODED IN THE AIR? AND IF SO, HOW HIGH?The DOD satellite data don't specifically say anything about an explosion ornot. It simply says that the object was tracked down to an altitude of 30kilometers. One can presume there was an extended period of fragmentation, butthe data release isn't specific. it doesn't talk about it broke up at such and suchan altitude or exploded at any altitude. But 30 kilometers is a very typicalaltitude for an object to deposit much of its energy at in this size range. So itwouldn't surprise me if that close to its end height or close to where most of theenergy was deposited. But we don't know for sure.THE RUSSIAN MEDIA HAS REPORTED SEVERAL PEOPLE WHO EITHERLIVED IN THAT AREA OR WERE THERE SAYING THERE WERETREMBLES IN THE AIR LIKE AN EARTHQUAKE."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"One can imagine there are a couple of modes that operate when you get an airburst. One is you get a ballistic blast wave, you know, a sonic boom in essence,but a very powerful one. And that sound wave itself can couple to the earth andcreate shaking visible on seismographs.WITHOUT EVEN IMPACTING ON THE SOIL?That's correct. We've actually documented quite a few cases where just verystrong blast waves, coupled with the soil, people can feel the shaking.Seismographs can detect that kind of an air blast and that air wave can actuallycouple into the ground producing P-type waves which are push/pull,longitudinal waves, set up by earthquakes in the earth itself. So, there are severalseismic modes that can be generated or catalyzed as the result of an air burst. Soyou don't necessarily need to have cratering. But clearly, a cratering event wouldalso generate seismic waves. But seismic waves don't generally mean, in fact,most of the time they don't mean cratering. Cratering is a very rare event.IN THIS CASE, THE COMBINATION OF PEOPLE SAYING THEY SAWTREMENDOUSLY BRIGHT FLASHES OF LIGHT AND FELT THETREMBLING, AM I UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY THAT BECAUSETHE DOD SATELLITE WAS ABLE TO IMAGE THIS EXPLOSION THATYOU HAVE A DEFINITE IDEA OF THE ENERGY RELEASED, ANDTHEREFORE, IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A LARGE OBJECT THATREACHED THE GROUND?The data released tells us what the radiated energy seen by the satellite sensorsare and that places it in context with other events that we recovered meteoritesfrom and which have also been seen by DOD sensors. And while this is certainlya sizable event, it is not among the largest in that category. There was an objectthat occurred January 18, 2000 in the Yukon that dropped the Tagish LakeMeteorite and it actually generated more radiated energy and it was estimatedfrom a lot of detailed investigation that it was probably an object about 60metric tons in size. So this one (over Siberia) is probably very comparable tothat, somewhere in the tens of metric tons, maybe 100 metric tons the most. Andobjects of that size typically detonate and deposit most of their energy in theupper atmosphere simply because they are not strong enough to withstand thehigh pressures of atmospheric entry at lower altitudes, with the possibleexception of iron meteorites which can in some cases get down intact withalmost cosmic velocity.Had this occurred over the southern U. S. or Australia, there would probably bemore people out working on it. But it's a very rugged area and very inaccessible.Winter is coming. I would assume based on other events that there is indeedmaterial on the surface. I think that's quite reasonable. But the material isprobably in the form of hundreds or thousands of fragments, smaller meteorites.Perhaps some of them many kilos in size, but probably most of them muchsmaller. And to find that in a heavily wooded area with snows coming on is ahuge task and it would be a huge amount of expense, huge amount of effort anda very low probability that you would come away with anything.\"We b s it e s :http://phobos.astro.uwo.ca/~pbrown/usaf/dod221.txthttp://phobos.astro.uwo.ca/~pbrown/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Republication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
