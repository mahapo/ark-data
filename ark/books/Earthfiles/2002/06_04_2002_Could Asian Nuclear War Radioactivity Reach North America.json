The Marshall Islands where the U. S. experimented in the 1950swith many atomic tests is at the far left in the Pacific Ocean. From Marshall Island andNevadaTest Site nuclear explosions, radioactive fallout riding on the prevailing westerly windsreachedNorth Carolina and New York, distances nearly equivalent to the 10,000 to 12,000 milesIndia and Pakistan are from the west coast of the United States. June 4, 2002 Tacoma Park, Maryland - If India and Pakistan strike eachother with Hiroshima-sized bombs, how much radioactivity could reach theatmosphere and fall out around the world? That is a question I began asking aweek ago and discovered that very little is known about the consequencesdownwind of such a catastrophe. The National Atmospheric Release AdvisoryCenter (NARAC) at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore,California seemed like it should know. NARAC's public affairs office describesits \"primary function is to support the Department of Energy (DOE) and theDepartment of Defense (DOD) for radiological releases.\" But when I asked aninformation officer there for information about the spread of radioactivity in theatmosphere from a nuclear war in Asia, the answer was, \"That information isclassified in the interests of national security.\" One scientist who wants to talk about potential radioactive fallout and its threatto earth life is Arjun Makhijani, Ph.D., President of the Institute for Energy andEnvironmental Research (IEER) in Tacoma Park, Maryland. Dr. Makhijanireceived his doctorate in nuclear fusion studies at the University of California,Berkeley in 1972 and has been head of the IEER since 1988. The institute isnon-profit funded mainly by foundations with a goal of independence and being"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"non-partisan. Dr. Makhijani said, \"Our goal is to provide the public and policy makers withclear and sound scientific studies on energy environmental security questions.Nuclear war is kind of an ultimate type of environmental catastrophe in my viewat least. We try to do it in ways that are clearly understandable so they will beaccessible to the public, but technically thorough at the same time.\" He surprised me in recounting a recent incident few know about that nearlyresulted in a nuclear missile exchange between Russia and the United States.\"There was potentially a nuclear war by miscalculation in January 1995 whenan American weather rocket was mistaken for a Trident missile by a Soviet radarbecause it was going towards Moscow and seemed to be that type of rocket. Andthe black suitcase was sent to President Yeltsin, but he waited, fortunately. Thenthe trajectory veered away from Moscow and nuclear war was averted. But wecould have been at a full scale nuclear war at the time and no one would haveknown there was even a problem until the first strike.\"He stressed that in terms of a strategic nuclear crisis, the Pakistan and Indiathreat is the worst since the Cuban missile crisis. \"In some ways, this is moredangerous in terms of the possibilities of nuclear war because there is an activeterritorial dispute (over Kashmir) between the two countries. They are sitting eyeto eye across the border with more than a million troops and no serious lines ofcommunication right now. Everything is happening through third parties whichis very unhealthy because I think these leaders should be talking to each other.\"I asked him if Pakistan and India do exchange nuclear weapons, what might theradioactive fallout be for the Asian region and for North America?Hiroshima, after the atomic bomb in Japan, 1945. Photograph and information below fromhttp://mothra.rerf.or.jp/ENG/A-bomb/History/Damages.html Nuclear material was Uranium 235.Energy released was equivalent to 12.5 kilotons of TNT dynamite.Maximum temperature at burst point was several million degreescentigrade.A fireball of 30 meters diameter formed in 0.1 millisecond, with atemperature of 300,000 degrees centigrade and expanded to its maximumsize in one second.The top of the atomic cloud reached an altitude of 17,000 meters.Radioactive debris was deposited by \"black rain\" that fell for an hour overa wide area.Maximum wind pressure of the blast: 35 tons per square meter.Maximum wind velocity: 440 meters per second.Wooden houses within 2.3 kilometers of ground zero collapsed.Concrete buildings near ground zero hit by the blast from above hadceilings crushed and windows and doors blown off.Many people were trapped under fallen structures and burned to death.People exposed within 500 meters of ground zero were killed by theradiation."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"People exposed at distances of 3 to 5 kilometers later showed radiationsymptoms, including radiation-induced cancers.More than 100,000 people died in the atomic explosions at Hiroshima andNagasaki. Arjun Makhijani, Ph.D., President of the Institute for Energy andEnvironmental Research (IEER), Tacoma Park, Maryland: \"An actualprojection of the precise fallout would, of course, depend upon how manybombs were used and the exact sizes of those bombs and none of thisinformation is public. We have some guesses about the arsenals of India andPakistan. The India arsenal is reputed to be 50-plus warheads made ofplutonium and they may be thermonuclear or boosted components. We don'tknow.Pakistani might also have about fifty bombs, but are almost all are certainlymade of highly enriched uranium without any plutonium and without anythermonuclear components.These would generally be bombs of the sizes that were used on Hiroshima andNagasaki. The fallout effects regionally if they are burst near the surface, closeto the ground, could be quite severe to devastating, depending upon exactly howhigh above the cities they were detonated. If the bombs are detonated very high,the local effects can be low, relatively speaking. The immediate radiation effectswould always be severe because there is intense gamma radiation in neutronsand in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a great many people died of intense high levelradioactive doses they suffered in the immediate aftermath of the explosion inthe milliseconds after the explosion. So, the more general radioactive falloutconsisting of fission products would contaminate the region pretty severely. Itcould contaminate the water ways and the milk supply.Much of our knowledge of what might happen comes from two recent studiesfrom National Cancer Institute and the other from Center for Disease Control.The NIC estimated in its first study published in 1997 of the milk contaminationresulting from Iodine 131 in the fall out and it was quite unevenly distributedactually across thousands of miles from the Nevada test site. The most intensehot spots were in Idaho and Montana, even though the testing was in southernNevada. And this is because of geography and rainfall and weather patternsgreatly affect how intense the radioactivity precipitates out of the fallout cloudinto the region. The doses to the children in those areas in the immediateaftermaths of those tests sometimes were very high, as high as the most affectedchildren from Chernobyl downwind of Chernobyl.The milk supply would be contaminated by Iodine 131 in the entire region, notonly the south Asian region, but depending on weather patterns, in other partsof Tibet and central Asia and southeast Asia and west Asia - depending on thelength of the war, in all directions.One of the things we know from Chernobyl is it was not a predicted type ofnuclear reactor accident in that the fire went on for 10 days. So, the releasesoccurred over quite a long period of time. What happened as a result of thatbecause of changes in the weather over that 10 day period, there wasn't a singlefall out plume from the Chernobyl accident. The fallout actually went in anumber of different directions and created problems along more points of thecompass than one might have expected from simple projections. That might alsobe the case if India and Pakistan start fighting a nuclear war. It would depend onexactly how they fought it and how they used the weapons. If thingsdisintegrated politically and weapons were still being used, the whole thing isextremely messy and frightening and not easily amenable to modeling. Radioactive Contamination in United States Far From Test Sites in the 1950s"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I can tell you the sort of cumulative doses that have occurred in some childrenwho were most disproportionately affected children who drank fresh milkbecause milk was the main pathway for Iodine 131 doses to children. In theworst affected cases in Idaho and Montana, the worst affected children got dosesas high as 2000 rads (radian per second) to the thyroid 1000 to 2000 rads. Andthese are the children in these counties who drank goat milk and lived on farmsand there were children like that. Mormons used to raise goats at the time, as Iunderstand. There were also sheep being raised at the time, lots of Basqueshepherds lived there at the time. There were across the country children wholived on farms and drank cow's milk and got doses in the tens or up to 100 to200 rads to the thyroid. These doses pose a significant risk of thyroid diseaseand thyroid cancer.The total estimated number of thyroid cancers from the fallout you can see theextent of the uncertainty from the Nevada Test Site fallout are somewherebetween 11,000 and more than 200,000 thyroid cancers.The dust storms from China at least 10,000 miles away have reached thePacific Northwest with a lot of dust. That demonstrates there is a directsweep of air currents from Asia to North America.Yes, we all live under prevailing westerly winds. That's what caused the falloutfrom Nevada to blow across the country which was known to meteorologistsbefore the test site was located there. We know from those sets of tests that therewere relatively hot spots all over the United States, even in the most eastern partof the United States in North Carolina.That would have been from blasts that were at least 5,000 to 6,000 milesaway?More. Marshall Islands to North Carolina might not be too different a distancethan say India or Pakistan to the West Coast of the United States.So we do have a precedent for 10,000 to 12,000 miles of radioactivitycoming from a blast and falling out at high levels in hot spots in the UnitedStates?We know from the studies done by the Centers for Disease Control and NationalCancer Institute this year the effect on the continental United States of testingdone by the United States in the Marshall Islands and by the Soviet Union inKhazikstan and in the northern Arctic islands, that there were hot spots fromtesting half way around the world in the continental U. S. So, it is possible thata nuclear war in India could result in hot spots as far away as the United States.As I said, these are not hot spots in terms of panic levels of radioactivity, butcertainly there have been levels of concern in the United States from testing inthe Marshall Islands and the Soviet Union.These were levels that would be of concern, but not they are sort of panic typesof radioactivity to cause evacuation of areas or similar to what would happen if adirty bomb was exploded in a city or anything like that. Definitely not to bedismissed as irrelevant or insignificant and definitely of concern for the publicthroughout the world because there would be some fallout everywhere and theamounts would depend upon meteorological patterns and the number of bombsthat were used and how they were used.If Pakistan and India exchange up to 20 missiles of theHiroshima/Nagasaki-sized bombs....Ye s ....the estimated diameter of geography that would be decimated isapproximately what?It would depend upon how these bombs were detonated. From the one studythat we know from Princeton University, a very large portion of Bombay tens of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"square miles would be devastated by a single Hiroshima-type of bomb. So, thedirect area that would be incinerated, reduced to rubble and where thepopulation would be completely be devastated would probably be from 20bombs would be in the hundreds of square miles, if not more. Many hundreds ofsquare miles.It's almost verging on the incomprehensible, isn't it?It is. I think the leaders of India and Pakistan I say this extremely reluctantly Idon't use such harsh terms but they are playing irresponsible brinkmanship withnuclear weapons. I think this is a time when they have to step back from thebrink where some type of international monitoring force for preventing acrosswater infiltration is needed and where India has to commit not to cross the lineof control. And when they have met before and said, 'We are going to resolveour differences peacefully, and they are not doing it. They owe it. There is nopiece of real estate in the world that is worth reducing vast areas of the world torubble and killing millions and millions of people.There are some Indian militarists who believe because India is so big and has apopulation of a billion people that India could absorb a couple dozen nuclearbombs from Pakistan and still survive where Pakistan will be completelydevastated by the similar number of bombs from India. I think those Indianmilitarists who think that way are living an illusion. If the main cities in Indiawere destroyed by Pakistani attack, India would cease to exist as a governmentalbody. Its main technical, financial and industrial and transportationinfrastructure would be completely destroyed. A very large portion of watersupply systems in large cities could become unusable. Large cities wouldbecome impossible to rebuild. India does not currently have the resources tomeet the needs of hundreds of millions of its own people. And if its main citieswhere the financial resources and industrial resources were devastated, I thinkthe disaster on the entire region would be truly India would not exist in anythingresembling its current form if there were a nuclear war, even if most of its peoplecontinued to live afterwards. Radioactive Monitoring in United StatesWhat is the best advice to Americans if radioactive fallout were reportedin the United States?Don't panic, first of all. For a lot of different reasons unconnected with Indiaand Pakistan, the capability of local emergency responders to measure radiationin the air and water and food needs to be developed because of the possibility ofterrorists using dirty bombs or contaminated water supplies or food.So this is a vulnerability now in the United States since we don't haveenough trained radiological teams?There are some, but a large part of the problem is that most of the trained forceoutside of the nuclear power industry lies in the Dept. of Energy which makesnuclear weapons and the Dept. of Energy's record in health and environment inmy opinion has been quite poor. they have lots of good people on the inside.They have lots of competent scientists and technicians on the inside. But theiroverall trustworthiness and the amount the public would trust is quite differentfrom say the Centers for Disease Control. If CDC says something, the public islikely to trust it, but if the Dept. of Energy says, 'Don't worry, the levels ofradiation are small.' The public is unlikely to trust it because it has not shownitself to be worthy of that trust before. They have the same press release whetherthings are serious or not serious.I think the United States needs to develop some capability that is independent ofthe nuclear weapons and nuclear power industry to deal with radiationcontamination issues. And I think the India and Pakistan crisis is just one morereason for the U. S. to do it.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" During Monsoons, Europe to the Northeast Could Receive Radioactive FalloutThis is a time when the monsoons will be starting soon in June and then movingnorthwards. The prevailing monsoon winds are from the southwest. So,generally the radioactivity would be carried eastward and northward, at least asfar as the regional patterns would be concerned. Because there is heavy rainfallin large parts of the region in June, July and August, if the war occurred at thistime, there would be places severely affected and quite a lot of water wouldbecome contaminated.\" More Information:China's Nuclear ProgramArjun Makhijani: \"We know quite a lot about the nuclear program of China. Itis a much more modest than the nuclear program of the United States. China hasa few hundred nuclear weapons. It has 20 long range ballistic missiles that couldreach the United States. They are all liquid-fueled missiles which would take aday or more to fill up and fire. So, they seem quite vulnerable to a potential firststrike from the United States. They are quite concerned about ballistic missiledefenses because of that.They are modernizing their arsenal and developing solid fuel rockets moresimilar to what the U. S. has. They might build dozens of these. It is unknown.Their nuclear arsenal is planned to be \"small\" relative to the U. S. No nucleararsenal is small because each weapon is so terrible, but China does not to publicindications seem to want to engage in a nuclear arms race with the U. S. Theywant to reserve their money to becoming an economic superpower.\" A Dramatic Case of U. S. Radioactive Fallout in 1954The U. S. government knows that people who lived in Nevada, Utah, Arizona,Idaho, Montana, Louisiana, North Carolina and even Albany, New York weresubjected to radioactive fallout as a consequence of atom bomb testing in theMarshall Islands and the Nevada Test Site. One dramatic example of what canhappen was described in a 1991 book:\"The hot spot occurred during the Upshot-Knothole series due to asevere thunderstorm, which happened just as the fallout cloud passedoverhead at an altitude of about 40,000 feet. According to the officialevaluation of this test: 'An interesting example of a small area of veryintense fallout occurred near Albany, New York on April 26, 1954following the seventh (atomic) burst. On this date, the highestgummed film activity ever observed by the monitoring network -16,000,000 d/m/ft2/day (disintegrations per minute per square foot) -occurred on the film exposed at Albany airport. Although there aresix monitoring stations within 150 miles of Albany, the fallout wouldhave been under-estimated by about three orders of magnitude inthis area had there been no station in Albany.'\"The official report on Upshot-Knothole estimated that a hot spotsimilar to the one in Albany over a location such as western Kansasmight have had intensities of one billion to 100 billion disintegrationsper minute per square foot at the time of deposition only five or sixhours after the test. This amounts to 4.5 to 450 millicuries per squaremeter, or 4,500 to 450,000 curies per square kilometer. Even shortperiods of human exposure to this level of radiation would mean thatthe dose received by such hot spot populations would be above the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"global average.\"- From Book: Radioactive Heaven and Earth: The Health and EnvironmentalEffects of Nuclear Weapons Testing In, On, and Above the Earth © 1991 bythe International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW) and theInstitute for Energy and Environmental Research (IEER).
