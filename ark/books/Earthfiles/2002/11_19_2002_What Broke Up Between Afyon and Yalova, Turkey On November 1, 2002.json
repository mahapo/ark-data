As I was trying to figure outwhat it might be, I saw several steady lights. Then the light which I previouslypresumed as headlight started to change and get smaller. As I was trying to finda plausible reason for that, the object approached and got into the position of 12o'clock. Ten or fifteen small objects about the size of a Boeing 747 were flyingat 1-2 kilometers between them. This lasted for about 1.5 minutes. As they weregetting out of sight, we reported these UFOs to air control at 5:44 a.m. localtime.\"- Captain Ercan Eken, Pilot, Sun Express Air, TurkeyVideo frame from a 22-second sequence taped at 5:38:58 a.m. onNovember 1, 2002, by Halil Yalcin while driving with his wife betweenBalikesir and Susurluk, Turkey.

November 18, 2002 Istanbul, Turkey - On November 1, 2002 around 5:30 to5:45 a.m. local time, four airline crews in the air and two on the ground reportedan unusual armada of glowing objects moving together past a yellow pulsinglight. The pilots' reports went to Turkey's Flight Safety Department and wereheadlined on television, radio and newspapers as a \"fleet of UFOs flying overTurkey.\" The airline crews in the air estimated the altitude of the pulsing lightand armada of glowing objects was between 22,000 and 36,000 feet."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Black line is the route travelled between 5:30 to 5:45 a.m. local time,on November 1, 2002, by a pulsing yellow light and a bright white light that brokeup into many large, glowing pieces between Usak to Izmir. Somewitnesses said the objects were travelling from west to east.Not long after the international press picked up the story, NASA and Russia'sSoyuz officials announced that what happened over Turkey was the orbitaldecay and break up from an October 30th Soyuz launch. But the six airlinecrews disagreed and several contacted Haktan Akdogan, Founder and Chairmanof the Sirius UFO Space Sciences Research Center and International UFOMuseum in Istanbul, Turkey. On top of the pilots' written testimonies, a mannamed Halil Yalcin managed to videotape 22 seconds of the explosion, orbreak-up, of the bright, white light near the still-pulsing yellow light.Haktan now speculates that the yellow-pulsing object, which all the airlinecrews called a \"UFO\" in their written reports, was an advanced technology ofextraterrestrial origin that destroyed a large meteorite before it could hit theearth and do damage. I talked with him today at his office in Istanbul.Interview:Haktan Akdogan, Founder and Chairman, Sirius UFO Space SciencesResearch Center and International UFO Museum, Istanbul, Turkey:\"When they witnessed the bright light, they say it looked like an aircraft with itsheadlights on, they thought at first. After that, when the object got closer, theysaw a flashing light. As they were trying to figure out what it might be, they sawseveral steady lights. Then the light they presumed to be headlights started tochange and get smaller. As they were trying to find a possible reason for that,the object approached and got into the position right in front of them.HAKTAN, WAS THERE ANY COLOR TO THESE OBJECTS?They say they were yellowish object. But after that, the big bright light split intolike 15 smaller bright light objects, each estimated to be about the size of aBoeing 747, each a smaller object. They say about 30 to 40 meters in diameter.So they were flying horizontally...JUST SO I'M CLEAR, THE PULSING YELLOW LIGHT AND THE BRIGHTLIGHT...The one in the back is pulsing, the yellowish was flashing light. The other was asteady light, very bright.AND WHAT BROKE UP INTO ALL THESE LARGE PIECES?At the time, they had no idea. They didn't see any kind of energy or anything.They had no idea. It was one bright light first and then another one right behindit that was flashing, pulsating yellowish light. The light comes right in front ofthem and splits into 15 pieces.THE LIGHT SEEMS TO SPLIT INTO 15 PIECES?Right. But they fly horizontally, so they thought it was a fleet of UFO because itwas flying horizontally, it was flying at high speed, and they were 100% surethat there was no aircraft there, as far as they know. They checked with radarand everything. So, with this kind of technology, at first they thought it could be"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"meteor. But when they see them flying horizontally in those kind of big pieceslike big lights 30 or 40 meters in diameter, that went out of their mind, themeteor idea.So, after that: this is what they reported in written testimonies to the FlightSafety Department and to us, as well. But this sighting was also witnessed byfour different airliners up in the air and also two airliners from the ground, fromdifferent cities and airports at the same time. And also by four or five people onthe ground. One of them was Imam, the head of the prayer was going to hismorning prayer. He witnessed this same exact thing.Graphic sequence drawn in cooperation with pilots from the four airline crewsin the air that watched the yellow pulsing light and break up of the bright, white lightbetween 5:30-5:45 a.m. on November 1, 2002 while flying between Afyon and Yalova,Turke y.And the most important thing here is that one guy driving the same time fromanother city with his wife, he had a camera with him. He witnessed the wholesighting and he pulls over and he gets out of his car and managed to film it for22 seconds. In the video footage, you see very clearly especially from themeteors you see pulsating light behind it. It pulsates like two times every onesecond. So, as far as we know, as far as everybody knows! meteors cannot flyhorizontally. But, also logically, meteors never have lights pulsating in a regularway like those observed in this case.One of the claims that has been put forward by some circles is that the objectwas decay that broke up from Soyus rocket launch from October 30, 2002.When I asked for the full report from the International Space Station, they sent"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"us a report of the Soyus re-entering the atmosphere at the same time, but in thereport, it says this rocket fragment is 2.7 meters in diameter. It's so small! Thatsmall piece would have burned up in the atmosphere between 700 and 800kilometers altitude.Let's suppose that it had kept its original size by until it reached 40,000 feet.How can we explain it splitting into 15 or 20 pieces and each one is 30 to 40meters in size and they were still so bright and how did all these pieces flyhorizontally violating the laws of gravity?Finally, this is the most important thing: how come another flashing objectappears behind the meteor? So, this is not a Soyuz rocket. It's not a regularmeteor.WHAT HAVE THE SOYUZ OFFICIALS THEMSELVES SAID ABOUT THISSINCE IT'S BEEN ON VIDEOTAPE AND SINCE 6 DIFFERENT AIRLINECREWS SAW THIS? WHAT ARE THE OFFICIALS SAYING?Officials from where?IN TURKEY?The government of Turkey don't talk about it! This is the same cover-up policythey follow in Turkey as well. The officials don't talk about it. But all thereports, there are testimonies from pilots when they went to the SafetyDepartment of Aviation and sent to us. We held a press conference and it was allover the papers because those are very reliable people, very credible people,these witnesses. Imagine, six airliners: two on the ground and four in the air.And their testimonies are all the same. And these guys, they know their aerialobjects in the atmosphere more than the astronauts. The astronauts are usuallyfocused on objects outside the atmosphere. These guys know what they aretalking about. And it was captured on the media (videotape). The meteor footageis amazing. You see the pulsating, the flashing object. It's unbelievable! So, it'sout of question that this is Soyuz rocket. It's out of question that it's a regularmeteor shower.And how can you explain such organizations as NASA and all that either theycovered it up because they didn't want to spark a panic among people or wethink extraterrestrial technology made it invisible (from radar) using some kindof energy field. This might possibly explain the fact that the objects were notpicked up by any radar because the pilots, when they witnessed the sightings,they checked with radar military radar and civilian radar and the radar scopesdid not detect it.AND THAT METEOR SPLIT UP BY SOME KIND OF INTERACTION WITHTHE PULSING LIGHT PRODUCING ALL OF THOSE FRAGMENTS...Exactly.INSTEAD OF A STONY METEORITE, COULD THE VERY BRIGHT LIGHTTHAT BROKE UP, HAVE BEEN ANOTHER PIECE OF TECHNOLOGYTHAT THE PULSING LIGHT DESTROYED?Uh... it could be. But when you see the video, when it smashes it in the finalstage, you see like fireworks. You see like a regular meteor shower. To us, itlooked like meteors. But the flashing pulsing light is always behind it and it'sflashing. And it's unbelievable.DO YOU SEE THE BRIGHT, WHITE LIGHT EXPLODE ON THEVIDEOTAPE?It's already exploded in the video, like fireworks. You see all the lights besidethe pulsating yellow one and they are huge. But there are so many of them,maybe 30 pieces.DOES THE VIDEOTAPE SHOW THE 15 OR 20 PIECES FALLING DOWN?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"No. It's not falling down. It's still flying horizontally, because they need moretime to make the final smash probably.WHY DID THE MAN STOP VIDEOTAPING AFTER 22 SECONDS?Because there is a hill. It (lights) get out of his view.WHAT PUZZLES ME, HAKTAN, IS THAT THE UNITED STATES IS ON THEPOSSIBLE VERGE OF A WAR WITH IRAQ. IN THAT PART OF THEWORLD, ANYTHING UNUSUAL THAT WOULD HAPPEN IN THE SKYTHAT WOULD BE SEEN AND REPORTED BY SIX AIRLINE CAPTAINSAND CREWS AND VIDEOTAPED ON THE GROUND, YOU WOULDTHINK IT WOULD BE NORMAL FOR POLICE AND FOR GOVERNMENTAUTHORITIES TO BE ON TOP OF THIS IMMEDIATELY TO FIND OUTWHAT HAD HAPPENED.Yes. But they may have more evidence than we do about this case. They don'tneed to contact with us. They already have the written testimonies of pilotsperhaps. They may have more video footage or whatever. I don't know, becausethis video footage was also shown on prime time news on one of the channels.Those pieces they should have hit the ground and caused a big disaster. Imaginefifteen or twenty 747s hitting the ground, but nothing happened whatsoever.THAT'S ALSO A MYSTERY TO ME. YOU HAD NO REPORTS OF ANYIMPACTS ON THE GROUND FROM THAT REGION?Nothing. Nothing at all.WHERE DO THE PILOTS THINK ALL THOSE LARGE PIECES WENT?They all became ineffective by this technology. There were large pieces at thetime, but in the video footage you can see they are splashing into more pieces.That's why they were, this pulsating light was making them flying horizontally tosave more time in order to make all these pieces ineffective before they hit theground. Maybe they went into the sea. We have no idea.SO, NOBODY HAS REPORTED A SINGLE IMPACT OF ANYTHING?No, nothing.DID ANYONE HEAR ANY SOUND?No. No. They didn't hear any sound at all.\"We b s it e s :http://www.siriusufo.org/engnews/haber.htm (videotape sequence)Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
