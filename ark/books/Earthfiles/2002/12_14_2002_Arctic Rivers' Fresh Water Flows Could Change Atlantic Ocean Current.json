That fresh water has spread rapidly thepast sevenyears over 15 million square miles from Greenland to the coast of the Carolinas. Mapcourtesy MBL, 2002. December 14, 2002 Woods Hole, Massachusetts - Six of the world's biggestrivers in Eurasia are dumping 7% more fresh water into the Arctic Ocean thanthey were in the 1930s. The current outflow is 128 cubic kilometers per year.The increased fresh water runoff is attributed to increased rainfall and meltingperma frost and glaciers as greenhouse gas emissions continue to heat up theearth.This week on December 13, the American Association for the Advancement ofScience journal, Science, published the recent findings of a research team fromthe Eco System Center's Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL) at the WoodsHole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Eco System Center's Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL)at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Photograph © 2002 by Richard Howard.The team's leader, Dr. Bruce Peterson, an aquatic ecologist and senior scientistat MBL, reports that the discharge from the rivers over the past 64 years isclosely related to the global surface air temperature and to the North AtlanticOscillation which, combined with the North Atlantic Drift that brings warm Gulfof Mexico waters northward to warm temperatures along eastern North Americaand western Europe.But in the past seven years, fresh water from the Eurasian rivers has increasedand spread rapidly over 15 million square miles from Greenland to the coast ofthe Carolinas in the United States. This week I talked with Dr. Bruce Petersonabout the Arctic river water research and what all that fresh water diluting thesalty Atlantic might do to the North Atlantic Drift and Oscillation.

And that's a lot of water."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" A contrast example between 1970 and 2002 showing the dramatic change from saltyto increasingly fresh water in the Atlantic Ocean along the western coast of North Americaand the Arctic. Graphic information from Woods Hole OceanographicInstitution and Bedford Institute of Oceanography.WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FRESH WATER THAT IS GOING INTO THESALTY OCEANS.Exactly right. And so we took the (United Nations) Inter-governmental Panel OnClimate Change (IPCC) recent publication, 2001 publication, and saw thatwithin this next century they expect an increase in temperature due togreenhouse warming of about 1.4 to 5.8 degrees C. If we then use the amount ofwater per degree that we see on our regression line, we'll end up with anincrease in discharge from these rivers that is roughly on the order of 18-70%increase over this coming century, that is by the year 2100. Now that range iswide because we use the very widest range of temperature projections; that is,1.4 to 5.8.BUT THAT WOULD BE AN AWFUL LOT OF FRESH WATER GOING INTOTHE SALTY OCEANS AND WHAT WOULD THE CONSEQUENCES BE?Well, that could well be a lot of water and although these are only 6 rivers, eventhat amount of water from these 6 rivers, if it were the high end of that range that is, towards the 70% - could potentially effect the circulation of water in theNorth Atlantic. The North Atlantic is the site where North Atlantic deep water isformed and it's a critical site in the global thermal circulation of the world'soceans.But what I am concerned about is that these 6 rivers are only 40% of the Arcticwatershed when you include all of Eurasia and the rest of North America. Andin addition to that, we have a large amount of water tied up in the ice sheets, theice cap of Greenland, and smaller amounts of water tied up in various glaciersand sea ice that could also melt and influence the Arctic.So, I'm guessing now, but it's potentially possible that the total change could betwo or three times greater than if you just look at these rivers by themselves.TWO OR THREE TIMES GREATER IS A GIGANTIC VOLUME OF FRESHWATER GOING INTO THE OCEANS.That would be a volume of fresh water which, according to my understanding ofthese global climate models that deal with the linkage between the atmosphereand the ocean circulation, that would be an amount of water that would reallyoverlap with the kinds of the amounts of water that are expected to either slowdown severely or shut down that Atlantic Drift...THE NORTH ATLANTIC DRIFT.North Atlantic Drift, or the North Atlantic deep water formation, which is wherethe North Atlantic Drift ends up.IF THAT HAPPENED, THEN THAT'S WHERE THE QUESTION IS: WOULDTHE EUROPEAN AREA BE PLUNGED INTO DEEP COLD OR MODERATECOLD? WHAT MIGHT ALSO HAPPEN TO VARIOUS MARINE LIFE IN THE"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"AT L A N T I C ?This, in fact, is such a shocking thing to think about this overturning in theNorth Atlantic, shutting off, that is about as far as we've got in considering theimpact. Again, to think about what happens beyond that, you really need tolook at the ocean circulation models because the ocean circulation drives a lotof the biology. They can tell you what the temperatures are likely to be, whatthe upwelling rates are likely to be, and those are the things that will reallyinfluence the biology.What we would expect, of course, is that this region of the earth's oceans wouldbe much cooler. If the North Atlantic Drift that brings the warm Gulf of Mexicowater to Europe should stop, average winter temperatures in the NortheasternUnited States and in Western Europe could abruptly drop 10 degreesFahrenheit.HOW FAR OUT IN THIS CENTURY DO YOU THINK CREDIBLY THAT WEMIGHT EXPECT THAT TO HAPPEN, IF THIS NEUTRALIZING OFSALINITY IN THE OCEANS CONTINUES?Well, first of all, I think it would not only be Eurasia, but North America wouldhave to be ramping up and Greenland might have to be melting to get thatamount of water. However, if the total input was what time in this century? Iwould expect that and I've seen some simulation models that suggest that thehighest risks are between 100 years from now, the end of the century and themiddle of the latter parts of the next century.How soon could it happen? Well, it could happen, with a low probability, verysoon and with increasing probability as we get toward the end of this century, if and this is a big if if the fresh water does ramp up with increasing temperaturesas it has over the 64 years of the record that we have in front of us.RECENTLY I READ THAT THEY ARE NOW SEEING THERE ISACCELERATED MELT IN GREENLAND AND THAT FITS RIGHT INTOWHAT YOU ARE JUST SAYING THAT IF WE DO BEGIN TO SEE THATTHERE IS ACCELERATION EVEN IN THE LARGE ICE ON GREENLANDGOING OFF INTO THIS OCEAN, THAT A CHANGE IN THE NORTHATLANTIC DRIFT COULD COME SOONER THAN ANYONE WOULDTHINK.Well, it's possible, but we don't have a good temporal record of the melt inGreenland, so we might not be able to do what we did with the rivers that is, runa regression over many years to see what the slope of it would be. Weunderstand there is a great deal of year-to-year variability in temperature indifferent parts of the system. So, although there might be a big melt this year, ifthat melt were sustained or increased, yes, this certainly would increase theprobability that this could happen sooner than if just the rivers werecontributing.WHEN WOULD YOU KNOW, IN TERMS OF DATA. WHEN WOULD YOUKNOW THAT THINGS MIGHT BE REACHING A DANGEROUS POINT INTHE ATLANTIC DRIFT IN TERMS OF ITS SLOWING DOWN TOWARDSTOPPING?It's very hard to answer that question because the history of research in that areaover the last 30 years has shown us that there can be pulses of fresh water thatare called 'salinity anomalies' which apparently can slow the deep waterformation and of course, it can bounce back.What we're talking about is a little bit different than that. We're talking aboutenough fresh water to shut it down. But when would we know? I would say thatthe fact that we've observed three of these 'salinity anomalies' is sort of a littleearly warning saying, 'There's enough fresh water around to seriously effectthings now. If you keep pushing in this direction, I would think the next two orthree decades are really the critical time for us to be understanding the dynamicsof this system. Our ability to project and model the future right now could be"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"greatly improved by consistency in monitoring and study in the next decade. Idon't know if society has that long to sit around and wait before they decidewhether or not they are going to push this greenhouse effect as high as the upperlimits of those ranges. But, if I had a stake in this, I would say I would try tothink right now about how to lower the CO2 emissions enough that we don't hitthe upper end of that temperature range predicted by the IPCC.BECAUSE THE CONSEQUENCES ARE SO HUGE AND UNKNOWN.Right, we don't have the ability to project beyond what might happen after ashut down in any detail at all. It's just an event that it might not be good. Itcertainly would be destabilizing for some, if not much, of our society and sinceit's somewhat unpredictable, I would like to stay away from that threshold, if itwere up to me.And it's frightening to us, you know! We just stuck our nose in the riverdischarge data and did not go into it with the idea that we were going to find atrend like this. It was a surprise to us and alarming to me that so early in the1930s we started a trend that appears to relate quite well to just a small amountof warming less than 1 degree C that we have had already in the last century. So,it's surprising to me.BUT EVERYTHING IS, BOTTOM LINE, GLOBAL WARMING?Well, it appears to be related one way or another to global warming. I think anymodel that you look at, the temperature is going up and if the relationshipbetween temperature and the hydrology that we've seen right here continue, thewater is going to go up, too.WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL GREATEST CONCERN, NOT ONLY AS ASCIENTIST BUT AS A PERSON LIVING ON THE PLANET NOW,LOOKING AT A TIME WHEN THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE ANYAGGRESSIVE ACTION TO SLOW DOWN GLOBAL WARMING?I guess my major concern is public education. That is, I feel if the public can'thave access to this kind of information and begin to understand it and thus, sortof vote with a very informed perspective of course, our Congressmen andSenators should have this perspective, as well. So, I feel we have a short numberof years in order to get the education to the point where people will recognizewe would really like to know the mechanisms linking warming and runoff in theArctic much better than we do now. So, we really worry about that because ourspeculation for the future depend upon how well we understand the system asit's operating today. And we have imperfect knowledge. So, there is atremendous amount of effort right now the National Science Foundation has justinvested roughly $30 million in intensifying the study of the fresh water cycle ofthe Arctic and also the circulation of the Arctic Ocean in the North Atlantic.They have at least recognized that we need to understand the mechanisms inorder to make any informed prediction or speculations for the future.ONE OF THE HUGE DISRUPTIONS THAT COULD HAPPEN WOULD BE ALOWERING OF TEMPERATURE IN EUROPE...Right.... THE AMOUNT OF LOWERING NOT QUITE KNOWN, BUT IF IT WASSIGNIFICANT, IT COULD EFFECT EVERYTHING FROM FOODPRODUCTION TO TRADE TO GENERAL MOBILITY OF PEOPLE.If it was significant, all those things would be true. Unfortunately, we can't tellyou how significant it would be. If it's not much of a cooling above what wehave in the current climate that is, it just compensates largely for the warmingthat we are forcing upon the system by burning CO2, then temperatures mightnot be that much different.But just sit back for a minute and think what the rest of the world would be like5 degrees warmer than it is now. So, it may be that Europe would have an air"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"conditioner and the rest of the world could be frying.WHAT WOULD THAT DO TO ALL OF THE GLOBAL CLIMATEMACHINERY?You're way beyond my ability to predict. My understanding from experts ininterpreting the global climate machinery is that we do not have the ability toeven predict what the ocean circulation would be like. How would itre-establish itself after such a shut down? And until we can do that with someassuredness, we certainly can't get the climate right.WHAT HAVE SOME OF THE SPECULATIONS ABOUT WORSE CASEBEEN?Well, you can find in print in a number of places people speculating, 'It will putEurope and the Northern Hemisphere on the track to have an ice age.'More Information:See other Earthfiles.com reports related to North Atlantic Drift changes in theArchives:· 12/22/2001 -- Scientists Warn That Climate and Earth Life Can ChangeRapidly· 01/09/2000 -- Global Warming Alert from NOAA and U.K.· 12/25/1999 -- Y2K Nuclear Concern and Global Warming UpdateCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
