The website listed with theinternet article is http://www.yawp.com/3rd-i/current/pp/putnam.html. Thatwebsite belongs to a loose group of people scattered between Iowa City andCharlottesville, Virginia who like to write fiction and pass it off as non-fiction.One of those people is Vernon Trollinger of Iowa City, Iowa where in August1996, Vernon Trollinger and Todd Ristau wrote \"The Putnam Paralellogram\"fiction for their Volume 3, Issue 8 monthly magazine called Third Eye OverIowa that carried these cautionary words on its cover: Believe At Your OwnRisk. Trollinger told me that \"Dr. Leonid Rosenweitz\" is actually Todd Ristauwhose main passion is dramatic theater productions for the No Shame Theaternow in Charlottesville, Virginia. In fact, the only photograph in the \"PutnamParalellogram\" article of an alleged Dr. K. M. Schaefer is Todd Ristau whophotographed himself in a photo booth at the Deadwood Bar in Iowa City in1996.Trollinger also told me that the idea for the Putnam Parallelogram story startedwith the Iowa State Historical Society Archives book entitled, \"Index toAbandoned Towns of Iowa\" by David Mott. But the town of Putnam in ruralFayette County where the 1945 Putnam Parallelogram mystery was supposed tohave begun is not even listed in the Index. If there ever was a Putnam, Iowa, it'sno longer listed in any of three Atlases I checked and the phone informationoperator says there is no Putnam in the state of Iowa.
