The second formation northof Kassel in an area kept secret at the farmer's request was discovered on May 1, butthoughtto have been formed earlier, most likely at the same time as the first formation. May 4, 2002 Saarbruecken, Germany - Crop formation investigator, surveyorand author, Andreas Mueller, reported to me today that two formations havebeen discovered south and north of Kassel, Germany in oil seed rape so young ithad only begun to open its bright yellow flowers. Both formations are thoughtto have been created the same night on Thursday, April 25. The first nearFritzlar south of Kassel was found by the farmer on Friday, April 26. Thesecond was found May 1 north of Kassel, but the condition of the cropindicated the plants had gone down earlier. In previous years, Kassel has hadtwo formations arrive at the same time and, like Avebury in England, is thegeographic focus of the crop phenomenon in Germany. See More Information atthe bottom of this report and my Earthfiles reports beginning 05/19/01 aboutlast year's prolific season in Germany.Germany's First 2002 Formation Discoveredin Fritzlar south of Kassel on April 26, 2002:In young oilseed rape,a large circle connects to a smaller circle in an angledpath, an odd variation on the straight dumbbell pattern seen in many formationsworldwide since the late 1980s. Diameter of the big circle is 17 meters; the small circleis 8.5 meters; the connection path is 5 meters; total length is 30 meters (98 feet).A small grapeshot circle was found outside the main formation.Photograph © 2002 by Dirk Moller."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Germany's Second 2002 Formation DiscoveredNorth of Kassel on May 1, 2002 (est. to have formed April 26):The second formation again is in young oilseed rape.

Interviews:Andreas Mueller, Creator of the International Crop Circle Archive(I.C.C.A.) and author, Kornkreise - Geometrie, Phanomene, Forschung ©2001, Saarbruecken, Germany: \"We have the report of the farmer and he wasout on Thursday, April 25. He was spraying his field and on April 26, hediscovered the formation for the first time. So it had to happen sometime in thenight of April 25 to April 26.Basically it's two circles. There's a bigger circle and a smaller circle and they areconnected by a path, by some kind of it's not a straight path like we have intypical dumbbell formations. It's an angled path that runs out in some kind ofpath from the big circle connecting the small circle and forming a tangent to thesmall circle. So, it looks a little bit angled, the whole thing. And there is a smallgrape shot circle at the bottom of the big circle as well.Given the crispness of oil seed rape, which is a little bit like thin celerystalks, it is difficult to understand how a small grape shot circle can bemade isn't it?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"It is very hard to do this with these fragile crops.Also, it is interesting to note that when we were in the formation, there werealready, had been already some visitors and animals like deer. We could see thisby footprints in the very damp soil. But by walking on the floor, on the flattenedplants, you hear them always snapping and breaking under your feet. We were ina few days after it was discovered and many plants came up again, as theyusually do, to grow in the direction of the sunlight. So this means that manyplants were not harmed or damaged so hard they couldn't lift up again. And thedamage we caused was so hard that the plants were broken in two. So, this isvery interesting to note when you are in an oil seed rape field. Somethingpushed the plants down before that did not cause this damage.Did not break them off.That's right.Did Frank or anybody get up in an airplane to take an aerial photo soonafter the farmer found it?Not yet, because the weather is not very good. This was also the conditionswhen the formation had formed. It was very rainy, very cloudy, very windyweather conditions here. So it was not possible to go up with an airplane. Andthis counts also for the second formation. But on that one, we have a good viewfrom a nearby hill.So, the weather itself makes it remarkable that there would be anyformations in oil seed rape right now?Yeah, you have to imagine here that the weather it's not very nice to be out in afield, especially not in a rape seed field where the crops grow up to yourshoulders and everything is wet. You get wet. And to get into the formationsthemselves, the tramlines are filled with water. It's really muddy and it's not niceto be out there for longer than 10 minutes. So, this was also a thought I hadinside the formation. I thought, 'If somebody should have done this, it was anugly job!' And there were no mud prints on the stalks as we would expect (ifpeople had made it).What about the second formation?The second formation again is in an oil seed rape field and basically it's simplytwo concentric rings and then there are four smaller grapeshot circles placedsome of them in between the two rings, so in the standing ring. And someoutside in the normal field. The overall diameter of this formation is 37 meters(121 feet), which is about 100 feet or so, a little bit more, 110 or 120 feet. Thiswas found on May 1st, but as the formation is not visible from any road orground, you have to climb this hill. We expect it to be a few days older andbecause it shows the same degree of the re-erection of the plants as the firstformation, we suspect them to have been formed probably in the same night.And this is very common in this area close to the city of Kassel, especially theearly formations and some of the later formations, they appear as twins. Theydon't look the same, but they appear often two in one night. So, this is also acommon feature we can say about the crop formations here at this Kassel area.When you say it looked like grapeshot between the two concentric rings inthe second formation, it reminds me of the Soberton formation, the first inEngland this year with those two circles in between the rings. (Seephotograph on the Earthfiles Headlines page.)Some people already came up with this comparison. But the thing is the twocircles in Soberton are standing. And our grapeshot here are flattened. So theyare flattened in between the standing rings that divide the inner ring from theouter flattened ring. So, it looks different. It's not like a positive or negativeimage of each other."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"But again, we are always left with the mystery about understanding what isbehind the circle-making intelligence. If we did understand more, we mightfind that what came down in England and what came down in Germanyhad some relationship.Yeah, if we could understand it. What would probably be very interesting foryou and the audience is that a colleague of mine his name is Klaus Listmann heis a researcher from the FGK Group, which is another group here in Germanyinvestigating the crop circle phenomenon. He did a temperature survey in bothformations. He uses a professional temperature device to measure thetemperature.He's measuring the temperature of the soil or plants?No, inside the formation. It has the sensor of the surrounding.In the air?Yeah, in the air, I guess. It doesn't take the soil or plant temperatures. It takes theusual present temperature. The temperature surveys confirmed that inside theflattened area it was 3 degrees Celsius warmer than in the normal standing field.And the same effect was measured in the second formation. There the differencewas four degrees. And this is something you already feel if it is 4 degrees warmersomewhere, which my friend did.The weather conditions were windy, cold, rainy and cloudy and one wouldexpect the opposite effect because the flattened areas are open for any windmovement to blow away any isolated heat. But the effect is the opposite. It iswarmer inside the formations which is very strange.\" W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, Grass Lake, MichiganI called biophysicist W. C. Levengood in Michigan to tell him about themeasured higher air temperatures in the two German formations.\"Yeah, I'm not surprised.You say you're not surprised because...?There are several factors why I'm not surprised. First of all, we have abundantdata strongly indicating the presence of microwave energy.Right.So if you have moisture in the soil that automatically would mean it would heatup very rapidly because microwaves heat up the water. It's designed to get thewater molecule vibrating and increase its temperature. So, that's not surprising atall.The German researcher who has been studying temperature variations informations found a 3 degree Celsius higher temperature in the firstformation and a 4 degree Celsius higher temperature in the second. Andthose measured higher even in cold, rainy, windy weather.Well, again that's not surprising. Soil you see is a pretty good thermal insulator.It takes awhile to heat soil up and it takes awhile for it to cool down. It isn'tsomething that occurs like when you turn your hot plate on and off. That coolsdown pretty fast.So, if microwaves had been interfacing with those crop formations, the soilwould have retained that heat?Yes and it could have penetrated quite deep. By quite deep, I mean severalinches."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"And that would affect the heat of the air above those soils in theformations?Oh, sure. It's radiating that heat out very slowly.\" Andreas Mueller:Is it fair to say that since 1990, from April to May 4, there have usuallybeen more formations by now in previous years around the world than sofar in 2002?Yeah, definitely. I don't know why this is. We are, as I said, I am very curiouswhy there are so few formations in England.One can take this from different points of view. The claim is also by someGerman skeptics that in England and Germany there are dozens of hoax groupsout there. So, I ask you: where are they? They might answer they have stoppedto show nothing happens? Well, I think we have to see. And as long as we don'tknow about the real background of the crop circles I know there is a realphenomenon besides some of the croppies (hoaxers), man-making croppies.When I talk about the crop circles, I talk about what I think is the genuine, notman made phenomenon. So as long as we don't know about the source andorigin of that, we can only speculate. More Information:People always hope that the crop circles will get bigger and more complicatedand elaborate and bigger in scale. I think these asking for bigger records tells usmore about ourselves than about the crop circles. Probably if we are now a littlebit disappointed and wondering why there is so few crop circles, again itprobably shows us our expectations which probably don't have much to do withthe crop circles.\"When I was writing my book, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles © 2000, Iasked Michael Hesemann, publisher of Germany's Magazine 2000 inDuesseldorf and long time student of ancient histories and religions why Kasselhas played a pivotal geographic role in Germany, as Avebury and Silbury Hillhave in England. He responded:\"In my opinion, it is no coincidence at all that Kassel became theGerman center for crop circle activities. It is indeed, next toKarlsruhe and Schleswig-Holstein (which are the other areas withfrequent circles in our country), the land which comes closest to thesacred landscape design of the sanctuaries of Avebury andStonehenge.\"Kassel is also the birthplace of Rosicrucianism in the 17th Centuryand the center of Masonic activities in the 18th Century. In 1614, theKassel printer Wilhelm Wessel published two books which becamethe 'Bibles' of Rosicrucianism: the anonymous General Reformationof the Whole World and the famous Fama Fraternitatis or theDiscovery of the Commendable Order of the Rose Cross. It waswritten by Johann Valentin Andreae, son of a Lutheran priest withthe reputation of being an alchemist, born and living near Tuebingenin Wuerttemberg.\"One year later, Andreae published his second book ConfessioFraternitatis or Confessuin of the Commendable Brotherhood of theVenerable Rose Cross, Addressed to the Intellectuals of Europe,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"again in Kassel. The fact that Andreae spent all his life inWuerttemberg, but published his books in Kassel/Hessen indicatesthat there was indeed a secret society already active at that timewhich coordinated the publication. With a very high probability,Andreae's friend, Rudolf August von Braunschweig-Wolfenbuettel,was another member of this Rosicrucian order. Its center of activitiesat that time was obviously already the city of Kassel.\"Mentioned for the first time in 913, Kassel obtained its town-rightsby the end of the 12th Century when it became seat of a Germanchapter of the Knight Templars. Since 1277, it is the residence of theCounts of Hessen. At that time until 1848, Germany consisted ofover a hundred independent states or counties ruled by Counts,Barons, Princes and Kings, united within the Holy Roman Empire ofthe German nation. In 1527, Hessen introduced the LutheranReformation as one of the first German states. The Counts of Hessenwere proud of their French ancestry, sharing with the Kings of Francea remote descent from Pippin, the Short, the father of Charlemagne.\"In 1717, the very year in which Freemasonry went public for thefirst time with the foundation of the Great Lodge of England inLondon, the Count of Hessen-Kassel, one of the first GermanFreemasons, completely changed the design of his residential city,Kassel. With the help of Italian architects, he designed it as 'the cityof man,' a model of the human energy body with its seven chakras.For this, he erected a network of fountains and monuments along astraight line, the city's new axis, ending on top of a mountain. There,he erected an octagonal structure corresponding with the eight-petalled lotus of the Buddhist model of the Kundalini, crowned by astructure which is half obelisk and half pyramid, with a bronze statueof Hercules on top: the God-Man of the Greek/Roman mythologyleaning on his club. Hercules stands for the perfect man. Seen frombelow, the whole structure resembles a Tibetan stupa. At his feet inthe octagon, Count Hessen-Kassel placed the defeated GiantEncelados, symbol for the ungodly 'old man.'\"Interestingly, Carl of Hessen-Kassel, who ruled from 1767 on,became one of the closest friends and disciples of the mysteriousalchemist, Comte du Saint Germain. Although Hessen preferred toreside in Gottorf near Schleswig, the capital of his land was Kassel.He hosted Saint Germain in the nearby castle of Louisenlund, wherehe allegedly died in 1784. In 1774, Carl of Hessen-Kassel wasreceived as a Freemason in the lodge at Schleswig. In 1782, heorganized the first national conference of Freemasons inWilhelmsbad near Kassel.\"In conclusion, I can say that Kassel was Germany's most importantcenter for Rosicrucianism with a ruling family deeply involved inalchemy, freemasonry and sacred landscape design. There is a directconnection between these ancient crafts and occult sciences andancient Egypt as there is one between the stone temple of Aveburywith its Silbury Hill pyramid and the land of the Pharaohs. Therefore,it does not seem to be a coincidence that right here in Kassel thecircle makers found a second field of activity.\" We b s it e s :http://invisiblecircle.dehttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comCredits"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
