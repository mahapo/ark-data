Across the road to the south is Woodborough Hill and Tawsmead Copse.Since the modern crop formation phenomenon began in 1989, this geography has becomelegendary for mysterious lights and interactions with helicopters.September 1, 2002 East Field, Wiltshire, England - Two weeks ago onAugust 14th was my last day in England. A new crop formation had beenreported in the famous East Field below Adam's Grave and Knap Hill to thenorth and across the road from Woodborough Hill and Tawsmead Copse to thesouth. As I walked toward the formation, I took a photograph withWoodborough Hill in the background.

From the air, the pattern reminded me of two dolphins circling around threeconcentric rings. On the ground there were stalks flat to the ground withoutcreases or breaks; clumps of stalks were standing at the center of the flattenedcrop and throughout most of the formation; plants in the tramlines were alsostanding; a graceful S-shaped pattern of green grass was exposed by theflattened crop in one section; and a large, black beetle was dead on top of awheat head.

More than anyone else I know, Andy has seen and videotapedhelicopters moving over crops in which mysterious lights have appeared, beforeor after formations. We sat down at the center of the new East Field pattern so Icould catch up with what he had seen this summer on night watches inWiltshire.

He said the most dramatic occurred on Monday night, July 29, between 10:15p.m. and 10:45 p.m. He and a friend had decided to visit Knap Hill above theEast Field where both have seen orange lights before. While his friend was at thevan preparing food, Andy walked to the top of Knap Hill with his video camera.He saw a helicopter fly toward Woodborough Hill about a half mile away anddrop down behind it. Andy could hear the hovering sound loudly and clearlyand wondered what was going on. Almost simultaneously, a strange blue light came up from the ground in front ofthe trees (copse) at the bottom of Knap Hill. The light had a strangephosphorescent glow. Andy Buckley, Computer Graphics Artist, Manchester, England: \"I woulddescribe it as a kind of blue light that seemed to emanate from ground level justin front of the second copse and it spread out into the field. I've seen this kind ofthing before, and it seems like a patch of light that was on the ground, not froma torch. It was almost phosphorescent. The First Light and Helicopter"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Almost immediately, the helicopter which was still hovering the other side ofWoodborough Hill suddenly came up and shot across the field at an extremelyrapid rate. I got my video camera filming all this and he came right to the pointwhere I had seen this light just around the copse. In a few seconds he was therehovering just below the copse. You could see the very bright red navigationlight.I decided at that point I'm just going to run down the hill. It was dark and it wasquite difficult. I had a torch with me, and I thought I'm going to run straightdown the hill to get close to see what's going on. As I was running down the hill,I put my light on and the pilot in the helicopter saw this presumably becausethey switched their lights off, all the lights on the helicopter just went off! Thenavigation lights and cabin lights.Initially I thought the helicopter was a gazelle, which we see frequently. But Ichanged my mind. I'm sure it was an Apache gun ship helicopter because it wasmuch larger and the sound was much different. I kind of recognize enginesounds. I'm pretty sure it was either a Puma or Apache, a larger helicopter.I got down to the bottom of the hill and I was trying to see where the helicopterwas without their lights on. I switched on the low light NightVision on thecamera which didn't really improve anything. I couldn't see anything at all.Finally, I walked behind one of the copse. I figured he was over the field, veryclose to the ground. But I couldn't see a thing. It was completely black, althoughhaving said that, there was a helluva a lot of buffeting and vibration and windcoming from this helicopter. So I was obviously quite close to it.I was still filming this so on video you can hear the helicopter. I decided Icouldn't get any closer. There was a fence at the bottom and there was no way Icould climb that fence in the dark. After two to three minutes, the helicoptersuddenly rose up. I could vaguely see a shape rising up from the field and hesuddenly switched all his lights on again. That was dramatic! Then almostimmediately he flew in front of me and across the East Field towards AdamsGrave and then disappeared beyond the brow of the hill. A Second HelicopterAfter that, I walked about half way back up the slope of Knap Hill and sat downon the ground and figured that perhaps the lights would reappear again. I'vebeen in situations like that where once the helicopters are gone, the lightsreappear. So, I got my camera filming again. I didn't see lights, but a couple ofminutes later, I saw another helicopter. It was coming again from theWoodborough Hill direction across the valley quite low down and quite close. Ithought he was going to repeat the same maneuver. But in fact, he started to riseand went over the top of Golden Ball Hill and then I lost him from view. Blue-White Phosphorescent Light Re-appearsI switched the camera off and then almost immediately, I noticed the blue-whitelight re-appeared quite close to the ground and spread over the field. It wasn'tparticularly bright and I filmed this, but since examining the footage, I can't seeanything. The light wasn't particularly bright, but I could see it quite clearly. Itwas very strange, quite diffuse. It seemed to have a core to it, a blue-white core.It was difficult to see where the light was emanating from, presumably it wasquite close to one of the copses. Strange Mechanical VoiceI carried on filming for a few minutes. Then, quite suddenly I heard this strangesound again coming from the area where the light was just in front of the copse."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The only way I can describe it was a kind of cross between a human voice and akind of mechanically created voice. It sounded human, but also artificial, with akind of metallic tone to it. It was quite loud and it came in two short bursts. Thefirst lasted for probably a couple of seconds. Then a slight pause for a second,and then there was another sequence of sounds.The first just sounded like some kind of chant. I've heard this phenomenonwhere people speak in tongues and it sounded very loud, kind of like (givessound example). That sounds very bizarre, but there was no mistaking it. I'veheard animal noises in the dark, like sheep and foxes. They bark occasionally.And you get deer in this area. But it was nothing like those sort of sounds thatyou recognize instantly.Was this exactly where that blue-white glowing light had been?It was coming from the same vicinity, from down below the copses. And itsounded sort of amplified, quite distinct. I wouldn't have said any person simplycould have shouted to make this noise, because I don't think it would have beenheard from that distance.Were there any helicopters there when that happened?No, the helicopters had disappeared. It was just quiet. I don't recall that whenthe noise appeared, or the sound of the voice, seeing any lights at the time. Andin fact, the lights did not reappear after the voice, or whatever it was, stopped. Ididn't see any more lights. I waited for another five minutes or so and thendecided to go back to my friend and tell him what I'd seen. Did Lasers Fire from the Helicopters?I rushed back down the hill. He was sitting in his van and his van had the backdoors open and he was eating. So his view was towards Lockeridge and GoldenBall Hill. He told me that 20 minutes earlier he had seen a helicopter fly overthe top of Golden Ball Hill, very low to the ground. As it appeared to him, hesaw two beams of light similar to laser light, very pencil thin, red lines of light.Initially he thought the light source was from the ground as if someone were onthe ground firing these beams up at the helicopter. But having thought about it,he kind of reasoned it was more likely that the lasers, or whatever they were,actually shot down from the helicopter to the ground.So, I came to the conclusion that was the second helicopter I filmed which flewacross the valley and over the top of Golden Ball Hill and then lost to view. Wedidn't see any other helicopters, so it was presumably from that helicopter.The implication is that if it was that second helicopter and that there werelaser lights shooting down, the lasers were focused where you saw thatblue-white light and heard the strange mechanical voice?No, the lights that my friend saw were coming down over a field which is on theother side of Golden Ball Hill, which had been plowed or harvested. Not theside where I saw the lights. And he said the red lights lasted for only a fewseconds and then the helicopter flew off. So, it's difficult to ascertain where thelights were hitting the ground, but it must have been in the field on the otherside of Golden Ball Hill.How many times in this area between Woodborough Hill, the East Field,Pickled Hill, Milk Hill, Knap Hill and Golden Ball Hill have you seenhelicopters seem to interact directly with formations, crops or lights?Many times. I've lost count of the number of times I've been out. I tend to go outvery early in the morning and I've actually on camera filmed military helicopterseither coming down directly over formations. Usually they fly straight to aformation and they will drop down and hover and then fly off. Or, they willsimply come down over certain parts of the landscape and hover which I find"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"quite unusual. Obviously military helicopters do low flying in this area and theydo come down to ground level. On some occasions, they are very specific aboutwhere they go to. They will just simply fly from say a point over towardsSalisbury Plain straight to a point as if they are searching for something. After afew minutes, they will fly off.Any off-the-record talk from military intelligence or others about what themilitary interaction with the lights might be about?Well, they deny that they see these lights. They just denied that the pilots hadever seen anything. But the evidence on camera is quite interesting.It seems that the pattern that has happened over the last ten years at leasthas been that helicopters show up so rapidly when there is an event as ifthey are monitoring certain frequencies?Yeah. I think the interceptions of lights are immediate. So, they must have someway, some technology or protocol if you like of recording anomalous events. Ijust assume it's treated the same way as any invasion of local airspace. I supposethey have some means of detecting these objects and therefore they respondimmediately.But why? And what are the lights' relationship to the crop formations?Well, it's difficult to say. I still think we are looking for evidence, video footageof something I'm sort of interested in when I go out which is to obtain some hardevidence of light creating the formation, even if it is only a small circle.Although I think I've come pretty close to it. I've seen instances where lightsappeared quite close to the ground, small lights. There was one occasion over atWoodborough Hill where I saw a very small light, probably no more than thatsize glinting, flashing over the crop. Then the crop started swirling beneath it.And at that point, fantastic! We're getting a crop formation. But nothinghappened. The swirling stopped. On one occasion, it moved across the fieldrather akin to a fair weather whirlwind that we occasionally get.How many videos do you think you have of lights now?I haven't done a count. A rough estimate, maybe forty. Maybe some of themhave a mundane explanation. I don't know.So far, none showing a crop formation being made, but that is your goal?A lot of the footage is night time footage which means lights in the sky.Although I have filmed a lot in daylight. I consider that more important. Yeah,that's my ultimate goal, either to film a light forming a crop formation or to filmmore evidence of military interception of lights either close to the ground orforming crop formations. That would be the ideal footage, I suppose! It's verydifficult to predict when these events are going to happen.\"More Information: For another dramatic incident involving blue-white glowing light, see Earthfile'sMysterious Clouds of Light in English Crop Formation.
