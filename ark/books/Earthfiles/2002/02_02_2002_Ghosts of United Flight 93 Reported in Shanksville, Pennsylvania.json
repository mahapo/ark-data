Oneman told his wife that he and others were going to take action against theterrorists.United Flight 93 went straight down into the rural countryside of Shanksville,Pennsylvania, not far from Johnstown. All 38 passengers and 7 crew memberswere apparently killed instantly as the airliner impacted at high speed thatproduced a crater fifty feet deep in the grass and trees.Morning of September 11, 2001, plume of smoke rises from"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the crash of United Flight 93. Photograph © 2001 by Val McClaskey.Within 48 hours, the FBI and State Police brought in a house trailer to be acommand post and to store some of the evidence boxes. Eventually the craterwas filled back in and local residents started referring to it as the \"mass grave.\"In order to protect the site, the Johnstown Rent-A-Cop company known as R.A. C. was hired to patrol 24 hours a day. One of the R. A. C. security guardswas assigned to duty at the crash site on November 9, two months after the 9-11horrors. His name is Robert Wagstaff, 32-years-old and longtime Johnstownresident. He became so uneasy near the trailer that he did not want to go therealone.He and other guards heard voices and footsteps at the trailer and once Roberteven saw a ghost up near the main gate. This new development to the September11th attack was first reported locally in Johnstown on Fox TV 8 which lead tomy learning about the hauntings. Here is Robert Wagstaff to describe some ofthe hauntings he has personally experienced during security duty at the UnitedFlight 93 crash site.Interview:Robert Wagstaff, Officer, Rent-A-Cop Services (R. A. C.), Johnstown,Pennsylvania: \"Me and another guard had just got into the trailer. We were inthere for only about two minutes and we heard somebody knock on the door.And there was nobody around, nobody. Well, my partner went out and hesearched the area and I stood in the doorway. Now, keep in mind, I'm only fivefoot nine inches and I weigh about 220 pounds. So, to get passed me, it's kind ofdifficult to do. You know, especially in a trailer door.Anyway, he's looking around and he didn't see nobody and he came back in andwe just kind of blew it off, like maybe it was the wind or something. You knowwhat I mean? So, we go back into the trailer and we got our coffee and we wentto sit back down to play some cards. We didn't have any chairs set up yet. Well,when we went to sit back down, one of the chairs was already set up and wedidn't set it up. I don't know where the chair came from. I don't know who put itthere.Yet you know for a fact that it was not there before the knock on the door.ght. And Jerry and me looked at each other like, 'What the heck?' And then wekind of ignored that, too, like maybe we're just imagining things. And we satdown and got into the chairs and started to play cards. We played two hands ofcards and then we heard someone walking through the trailer.Like on the inside?Yeah. And we looked at each other and we looked around. And there was not asoul to be seen. OK? The next thing we knew, we heard mumbled voices likethey was outside of the trailer.Any words?We couldn't make out the words. It was too muffled, you know what I mean?Male or female?It sounded like a group of people. It sounded like more than one. They allsounded like they was outside on the back half of the trailer. So we hurried outand ran outside and we looked and there was no footprints in the snow.You even had snow to look for tracks.Right, and there was no footprints. So, me and him got back in my car and wentback up to the main gate and we didn't go back in the trailer. (laughs) Needlessto say that kind of startled us.Another time I was sitting out there at the main gate and it was about 3 o'clockin the morning. I lstarted to lay my head back to kind of relax for a couple ofminutes instead of just staring at the gate and doing crossword puzzles and stuff."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I laid my head back and keep in mind, I'm out there all by myself. Got my cardoors locked. And out of nowhere, I hear a voice inside my car say, 'So, nowwhat?'And I jumped up and looked around and there was nobody in my car, nobodyaround. I went, 'OK.'Was that a male or female voice?That was a male voice. And it startled me real bad.It was loud just like somebody was sitting in your car?It sounded just like somebody was in my car, like somebody was in thepassenger seat and I was in the driver's seat. That's how clear it was, but therewas nobody there!One night it had quit raining and I'm sitting there all by myself listening to mystereo, got my car running. I drive a 1987 Cougar, OK. So, it's an older car, justso you have an idea. And I'm sitting in my car and all of a sudden - have youever felt what it feels like when you are in your car and somebody sits on thetrunk? So, I'm sitting in my car doing a crossword puzzle and it felt likesomebody jumped up on the trunk of my car. And I'm looking and I don't seeanybody. So, I get out of my car and close the door and I walk around to theback of my car, got my spotlight on, you know, and I'm looking around. Andthere's absolutely no marks in the mud except for the tire tracks from me pullingin and out and moving around, you know. Otherwise, there was no tracks in themud. There was all kind of dirt on my car. You figure it had just rained, it'smuddy out there. So, I had a real filthy car at the moment, but there was noscuffs in the dirt on my car, like nothing was ever there.But while I was looking right there in front of me, the rear end of my car jumpedback up. Like whatever was on it came off.There was one time I was sitting out there at the main gate. Now keep in mind,the main gate is almost a mile away from the main crash site. OK? But I seen thislady walking around in the dead of winter at 4 o'clock in the morning. It was afull moon out, 4 o'clock in the morning, and I seen this woman as clear as day,like if you was to be looking at me dead in my face and you was standing infront of me.Was she at the crash site?She was actually coming towards my car.From the crash site?From the direction of the crash site.How was she dressed?She had on like a blue baseball jersey. OK, one of those button-down-the-frontones with a pair of blue jeans on. She had medium length, like light browncolored, hair. She had glasses on. I mean, this lady was so clear. I was gettingready to get out of my car and ask her why she was walking around out there inthe middle of the night, dead of winter, snowing. And why didn't she have on acoat?So, I went to get out of my car and as soon as I pulled on my car door to open it,she vanished.How did she vanish?She just vanished. She totally disappeared. She didn't like fade out or nothing. Itwas almost as if I blinked and she wasn't there no more.How far away from you was she when she disappeared?An approximation as far as guess on size of her and everything else in distances,I would say probably no more than about ten to fifteen feet away.When she disappeared like that, then what did you think?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The first action for me to do being that I'm a security guard was take out myplanner and write down everything I seen. I wrote down the time, thedescription, how old she looked to me, the whole nine yards. How far she wasaway from the car, what direction she was coming from and how many steps Iseen her take. I seen her take like seven steps. And like I said, she was walkingright towards me and just vanished into thin air.What about other reports from other security guards?The overnight guards have heard people walking through the trailer, heardpeople knocking on the trailer door. As a matter of fact, another guardmentioned he saw what appeared to be shadows of people walking around. Andwhat those are called are called shadow people.' And basically what that is isspirits, too. OK? And you can only see them at night time, too.Now, the funny part is, I would see the shadow people and there would benothing to create a shadow. No kind of light source to create a shadow, OK? Butyet, you would still see shadows running around in the dead of night.Where were they and what did the shadows seem to be focused upon?They seemed to be focused upon trying to get away from the crash site is what itlooked like because they was going away from it. It was like they was runningaway, is what it looked like. And you would see on average probably about sixor seven shadows over the course of an average night out there.How do you see shadow people moving in darkness?That's my point. I don't understand how you can see them. I mean, you just do.You see them. And I would even hit them with my spotlight. They would vanishinto thin air. As soon as I would hit a shadow with my spotlight, it would vanishinto thin air. But when I would take my spotlight back off of (where the shadowhad been), it would be right there in front of me again running. And it was hardto catch them (with my spotlight) because they was fast. You know, it was hardto catch them with your spotlight.When you and the other guards and your boss have talked about thishaunting in the Flight 93 crash site, what do you all conclude?We was going out there to protect the things that belonged to the people on thecrash, that was in the crash. We was there to protect the people that was in thecrash, in a manner of speaking. And that's how most of us felt. And we can'thelp but think that maybe, just maybe, that the spirits that are from that flight,the ones that acted heroically are trying to protect us as well. And every time wego in that trailer, they knock on the door to get our attention to get us back outof the trailer.The people on Flight 93 who had to jump the terrorists to get them to quit flyingthe plane towards Washington, D. C. just maybe they decided to use the traileras like a prison for them terrorists. Because you get an uneasy feeling when yougo into that trailer whether you've been there before or not.What you are saying is that you all are making a point that the terroristson that plane who caused it to crash died with the passengers who actedheroically. All of those souls and spirits were mixed up together?Right.What have you and the other guards discussed in terms of how cansomething in the unseen after the moment of death interact with matter tomove a chair, to knock on a door, make stairs creak and that sort of thing?For me, I don't question it. I honestly don't. But like one of the other guards whois a little bit younger than I am and he was the one that was originally workingover night. And he was kind of gun shy so to speak. He didn't really know whatto expect as to how is it possible that spirits are able to interact with us if theyare dead? And the only thing I kept telling him was, 'You can't be afraid of thedead. They really can't hurt you. The most they can do is scare you.' If you'vegot a bad heart, then I guess they can kill you. (laughs) But otherwise, there'sreally nothing to be afraid of. And he said, 'But how are they able to do it?' AndI said, 'Well, honestly, I don't know. I haven't been dead yet.' (laughter)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"But I believe it is a learning process once they pass on suddenly like that. I thinkit's a learning process for them to go ahead and be able to move things aroundand appear as a form of a human and so on after they pass on suddenly like that.Yes, there is supposed to be an association between sudden death andhauntings, that there are more hauntings where there have been suddendeaths.Well, you can't get more sudden than that. Nobody got on that airplaneexpecting to die, except for the terrorists. And they wasn't even expecting it untilthey was boarding the plane. So, I mean, they acted heroically as far as saving abunch of lives, but at the same time they wasn't trying to die. And that's whathappened. I can't help but think with that many people dying at one time, totallyunexpectedly, there's going to be something there.\"When Robert Wagstaff went to the United Flight 93 website to look at thepassenger photographs, he told me he shivered with goosebumps when he sawone of the females who closely matched the woman he saw walking toward himand then vanish. In respect for the family, he has asked that her name not begiven. (End of Real Audio)Pennsylvania Ghost Hunters Society, JohnstownA photograph was taken at the public memorial to the victims of United Flight93 back in September by Nancy Coplin, Director of the Johnstown Branch ofthe Pennsylvania Hhost Hunters Society. She and her ghost hunter colleagueshave studied the many reports of hauntings at the Gettysburg battle field. In theirinvestigations, she uses still and video cameras and audio recorders. I asked herabout the relationship between sudden death and the frequency of hauntings.Nancy Coplin, Director, Johnstown Branch of Pennsylvania Ghost HuntersSociety, Johnstown, Pennsylvania: \"When death came to them, it came veryquickly which leads us to believe that they don't even realize they are dead. Itmay take time for their minds to clear and rational thought to return after death.And what occurs at the time of death affects post-death behavior. Fear andconfusion alone in itself can become an anchor.On this matter world.In this particular instance, yes. We know that they died a very horrible, tragicdeath in that situation. And they do indeed attempt to make human contact attimes.Is it fair to say that it is in the very sudden death and violent incidents thatthere seems to be a link to more hauntings afterward?Yeah, because there are unresolved issues and unfinished business. They are notready to go. We find that in a lot of cases. That can be compared to a situationlike on the Gettysburg Battlefield where so many hauntings are reported wherewe've done numerous investigations there. We compare this similar to that:sudden, tragic, untimely deaths in which none of those folks were ready to go.What in past literature suggests is the best way to help those spirits moveon?We really can't officially send them into the light. We don't use psychics oranything like that. We use strictly scientific methods with cameras and video andaudio. There are at times attempts to make human contact looking for help. Wefeel that those who are receptive to these types of hauntings, we can suggest weknow they hear us because they respond when we are doing investigations wecan only make suggestions and try to help them realize that they are in thistransition. And once they accept the death of their physical body, we feel theydiscover their new shining body which in turn allows them their soul to soar. Ithelps to release the anchors that bind them here to begin with.Have you been out to the site and taken photographs?Yes, we did. We went out when the temporary memorial was there at the very"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"beginning. We went one late afternoon and stayed into the dark and tookphotographs and yes, we did get some photographs of anomalies out there.What kind?The most common anomaly we photographed is the orb or ball of light which isa form of spirit energy.You do have photographs that show those at the crash site?Not at the crash site, not where the crater was. That was roped off and it still is.There is no trespassing down to the crater site, but we did get photographs at thememorial. I was not surprised to hear this story on the news when it first cameout here locally. I was kind of thinking this is going to be the case out there.That it would end up being a haunted site because it was such a sudden andviolent death?Ye s . \"About The Memorial Site Photograph With Cluster of Spheres Around Cross\"When we take photographs like this, I can't sit here and tell you that those ballsof lights that we photographed out there that evening are indeed the crashvictims. There is no way for us to tell by looking at photographs like that. Theonly way we actually know is to conduct an investigation by using electronicdevices like tape recorders and trying to get electronic voice phenomenon. Thisholds true, no matter what investigation you do. Just because you get ectoplasmor some type of energy on film or videotape, that doesn't tell you who it is.When you use a recorder and you ask a specific question: Can you tell me youname? If we get a name back and say it would be one of the crash victims, andthat is entirely possible, but we haven't tried it - then we know for sure. We cansay, yes, this is one person who is there.Would you plan to do such research?I am hoping to with the help of Renae Kluk who did the report on TV 8. TheSomerset County Sheriffs Office has taken over and the sheriff told Renae togive him a month or two to see if his men who are guarding the site out therehave any stories. If so, we will try to organize an investigation with cameras andtape recorders as we have in the past at the Gettysburg battlefield.\"First TV News ReportsRenae Kluk is a recent communications graduate of Clarion College in northernPennsylvania and works as both on-air weekend anchor, reporter ANDcameraman at the Fox TV8 channel in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. She has livedthere all her life and has never received so much response, mostly positive, fromher fellow residents as she has since first interviewing Robert Wagstaff about hisghost experiences at the Flight 93 crash site. This week she told me about herown visit to the spooky trailer.Renae Kluk, Weekend Anchor and Reporter, Fox TV 8 and ABC 23,Johnstown, Pennsylvania:\"So we drove down to the trailer and he's showing me where the chair wasmoved to and different things that had happened. We set up the camera to do theinterview. And about half way through the interview, it was about a half hourinto the interview actually, and it was about 3:30 in the morning. I said, 'Who doyou think these spirits are?' And he goes, 'Well, I think that a lot of people, theywere heroes, but there were a whole heck of a lot of people who are dead whoweren't expecting to die on September 11.'And at that point in the conversation, that's when we heard the sound outside.And it was like the sound of footsteps.You heard this with your own ears?Yeah. I heard it and Bob looks at me and there was dead silence between the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"two of us. We just kind of locked eyes. And I looked at him and he looked at meand we were both waiting for the knock at the door. and we were just waitingand waiting. He had said sometimes you hear footsteps and then you hear aknock at the door. And I'm sitting there and mentally thinking, 'Please don'tknock! Please don't knock! Because if you knock, I'll really freak out!' (laughs)The knock didn't come, but I do have the sound of the footsteps coming up thestairs.You actually got the sound of footsteps on the videotape you were running?Yeah. I don't have any video of - I just left the camera on the tripod. I do it all. Ireport and I run the camera and everything. I do have the audio, but no video ofthe outside steps. It was kind of impossible to be moving around that quickly.We were waiting for the knock.Did you open the door at that instant to see?No, we didn't get a chance to open the door at that instance because we wereboth sitting there with locked eyes and it was, 'OKAY!'What did those footsteps sound like in terms of gravel, rocks, soil whatkind of sound?They were metal steps.It was shoes coming up the metal steps of the trailer?It was creaky like creaking up the metal steps of the trailer.Did you feel any motion in the trailer?No, we were pretty far away from the door at that point. We were kind ofmidway through the trailer, maybe 12 to 15 feet from the door. When the soundof the footsteps went up the steps and stopped. That was it. They just went upthe steps and stopped at the door. No one went back down the steps. They juststopped at the door. And when I got back, I thought, 'Well...' I walked up thosesteps because I tape recorded our coming in on video, walking in together. And Ithought, 'I have the sound of my feet going up those steps. I wonder what thatsounds like?' I played it and saw what that sounded like. Then I shuttled throughthe tape and I listened to what we heard in the middle of our interview. And itwas the exact same sound. It was like, 'Oh, those really were footsteps.'How does something in the unseen in the category of ghosts after deathinteract with the matter world to make any kind of sound?Yeah. Exactly. That's one of the unexplained. If they don't have any weight ormass?What kind of response have you had to your two TV reports?When I went in earlier the next day, I had one e-mail message from a viewerbasically saying we needed to let the spirits of Flight 93 rest and we should nothave done the story. However, other public response wherever I've gone out, lotsof people have come up and asked, 'Did you really experience the footsteps? Doyou really think it is haunted?' I've gotten far more positive response thannegative.In fact, I have to say out of all the stories I have ever done in this market, andthis is my hometown, so I have a lot of friends in the area. Out of everything I'veever done, this has been the one story I've gotten the most response from. Andyou know, I keep wondering: if this is going on in Shanksville, Somerset County,what's going on in New York? What's going on down at the Pentagon? BecauseI'm sure if these spirits are just as discontent or should we say, as vocal, I'm surethey are experiencing kind of the same thing there, too.\"We b s it e s :http://www.ghostweb.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund PolicyCopyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
