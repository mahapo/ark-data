Photograph © 2001by Roger Barbour Kuhn.April 6, 2002 Madison, Wisconsin - On February 28th, the WisconsinDepartment of Natural Resources (DNR) confirmed three cases of deadly chronicwasting disease (CWD) in free ranging white-tailed deer in the Mount Horeb areaof western Dane County. This week that number jumped to ten. Since March 5,2002, the DNR has collected 197 deer samples from that region and plans tocollect 300 more. CWD is a prion disease that attacks brains and nervous systemssimilar to mad cow in cattle, scrapie in sheep and new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakoband kuru in humans. The culprit in both animals and humans is called a prion.Prion stands for proteinaceous infectious particles. More simply, prions start outas normal proteins that mysteriously change shape and then destroy brain andnerve tissue. To this date, no one knows what caused the proteins to changeshape in the first place or how misshapen proteins are transmitted. There is noblood test to find prions while animals are alive and no cure after prions areconfirmed. Death usually occurs within weeks or months."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" On the left is the normal prion protein, PrP-C found in all mammals.On the right is the abnormal, misshapen PrP-SC. Various distorted prion proteinshapes are what cause diseases such as Chronic Wasting Disease (CWD) in deer and elk;scrapies in sheep; BSE Mad Cow in cattle; Creutzfeldt-Jakob, new variant-CJD and kuru inpeople. All prion diseases attack brain and spinal cord tissue and are always fatal.Diagrams © 1996 by Z. Huang, Stanley Prusiner and Fred Cohen.Wisconsin's Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection hasbanned deer and elk imports from other states unless sellers can prove theiranimals have been free of CWD for at least five years. The problem is that no onehas been testing herds in the United States that long, except Colorado andWyoming where chronic wasting disease first showed up in the 1960s. Fieldresearch has shown that chronic wasting disease can spread quickly and as manyas sixty percent of white-tail deer exposed to the illness can become infected.The Deputy Administrator of the Land Division of Wisconsin's Department ofNatural Resources, Dr. Sarah Shapiro Hurley, is a veterinarian with a Ph. D. inMolecular Biology. The past fourteen years, she has worked on state wildlifeissues and is surprised that so many cases of chronic wasting disease havesuddenly been found in Wisconsin. Mount Horeb in western Dane County southeast ofMadison, Wisconsin is where all the positive findings of CWDhave been found within an approximate five mile diameter area.

We didn't expect to find it particularly in free ranging white tail deer.We have no idea why it's there. Obviously, that's a part of our investigation, butwe may never know exactly what brought it here.It's a big jump from Colorado and an area where it's been since the 1960sto Wisconsin, isn't it?Right, but part of what we don't know about the disease is how it's transmitted,why it occurs in certain places, and whether or not it does exist undetected insome of the intervening territory. For instance, Iowa has not been doing anysampling for chronic wasting disease. And I believe that Minnesota has donesome, but it has been very limited. There is so little known and in terms ofsampling free ranging wild animals, there really is almost nothing that has beendone throughout the country outside the endemic area in Colorado andWy o mi n g.How do you think it has spread, even if you're speculating, from Coloradoand Wyoming now to Wisconsin?I honestly can't tell you. I don't know. There are theories that range from the factthat just as it arises spontaneously such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humansin one in a million people appears to be spontaneous. Perhaps it arisesspontaneously in deer and other animals and that because of the deer densities orsome other set of circumstances, it was able to spread from one animal toanother? It's possible that it moved on an animal that was imported into the state.It's possible that these deer are ranging in part over land on which sheep withscrapie disease (another prion disease) were pastured at one time. It's possiblethat someone went hunting out west and brought back a mule deer and discardedthe skeleton and hide somewhere out in that part of the world. You could just goon and on and speculate, but we don't really know.Is it true that like mad cow disease and perhaps scrapie, that the infectedprion nerve tissue has to be ingested, literally eaten and consumed into theanimal that becomes ill?We don't know that. It isn't known how it's transmitted. Scrapie, for instance,when it's transmitted sheep to sheep probably is not as likely to be ingested.There is some evidence in scrapie in sheep that there's a genetic component andit's transmitted from ewe to lamb.We do have a lot of indication that it's density dependent. It doesn't matter if it'snose to nose contact or contaminated feed or spread by sexual contact orsneezing or...Urine and feces....or carried by fleas from one animal to another, whatever it might be. We don'tneed to know exactly how it happens if we understand at least some of thedynamics and we can reduce the density, regardless of what exactly is happeningin the moment that the disease goes from one to another. We've been able tointervene there and reduce the risk of transmission. We don't have to understandeverything about it to be able to begin to manage it. We can fine tune themanagement if we know more about how it's spread, but we aren't completelyhelpless or powerless in being able to begin to work on the disease, just becausewe don't know everything there is to know.Wisconsin is famous for deer hunting. What are you going to tell the deerhunters that I assume you are going to turn to in order to reduce the deerpopulation? If there is a chance there is contaminated prion meat, does thatmean for the foreseeable future that people will be warned not to eat anydeer that they kill in the state of Wisconsin?We have been working very closely with Health and Family Services in the state"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"on developing a responsible, responsive, understandable message about the risksof transmission of chronic wasting disease through eating meat, venison. What weexpect to tell hunters about that risk is to explain the relationship to mad cowdisease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, to explain the situation with regard tochronic wasting disease and to give folks the information they need in order tomake their own personal decision about whether they choose to eat the meat.What is that information?Well, the information is that this disease is in the same family as mad cow diseaseand that mad cow disease has been shown to be transmitted to humans, that thereis no evidence based on the World Health Organization's and Center for DiseaseControl's investigations of all the anecdotal evidence and everything else that isout there, that chronic wasting disease has ever been transmitted to a human.There is no higher incidence of the new variant CJD in populations in the areawhere chronic wasting disease is endemic in deer and elk. There is no higherincidence of new variant CJD in populations of people who eat venison and thereis no evidence that it has been transmitted. But we are not going to assure folksthat there is no way that it ever will be. We're going to tell them, give them theinformation and facts, and say very clearly: This is something you need to thinkabout and determine whether or not you are willing to take the risk of consumingthe meat. And that it is a small risk, but we are not going to sugar coat it or makeit appear that it doesn't exist.Would you yourself eat any deer that was killed right now in the infectedWisconsin area?I wouldn't eat any deer. I would not eat meat from a deer that was obviously sickand I would not eat meat from that area. I wouldn't eat something where thevenison had been commingled. But if it were a healthy animal and I was eatingonly the meat and I was not eating the brain or the marrow or something likethat. Then, yes. I would eat the muscle tissue from deer, a healthy deer that waskilled in that area.What is your perspective on the relationship between the spread of madcow disease in Europe and what now seems to be the parallel spreading ofchronic wasting disease in the United States?I don't think there is any connection at all. I think the epidemiological evidencehas shown that in Europe with mad cow disease a large part of that spread had todo with feeding bone meal from ruminants to ruminants, cattle. That has beenagainst the law in the U. S. since 1999. And there is very little feeding of bonemeal to deer. So, I don't there I doubt there are parallels.You can't help wonder as a human living on the planet, why is it that atparallel times there should be a spread of prion disease in cattle that jumpto humans in Europe and at approximately the same time that deer herds inColorado, Nebraska and then further east to Wisconsin should see thespread of another prion disease which is chronic wasting.In the United States with chronic wasting disease, the spread has been of adifferent nature. Up until, Wisconsin, most of the documented spread of thedisease was in the transfer of game farm elk from one farm to another and it wasfairly easy to track. How it got there was pretty straightforward. This doesn't fitthat pattern as far as we know.Isn't that what makes Wisconsin sort of alarming - that now this priondisease has showed up in a state that is quite a ways from Colorado andNebraska and no one can really understand or explain how it got there?That's true. But we've only known it's been there for a month. I mean, we may atsome point be able to understand or have a likely scenario through which itspread.But in your mind and other professionals', it must be of some worry thatsince mad cow disease - that prion - jumped from cattle to humans in"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Europe, there is a possibility that the prion disease that produces chronicwasting disease could also jump to the human population here?Oh, sure. And that's what I was saying earlier. We are not ignoring or trying tokeep the public from learning about that and say to them: This is not a decisionfor us to make. You, here is what we know and you make your decision just thesame way you make a decision about whether or not to wear a seat belt whenyou drive your car, whether or not you make a decision to smoke or not smoke.Here is another risk and here's what we know about it. Make a decision aboutwhether or not you want to eat the venison.\"White-tailed buck © 2001 by P. E. Johns. More Information:From the April 2, 2002 Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources NewsRelease:\"CWD has been known to occur in deer and elk in the western USA for decades(Colorado and Wyoming). In spite of ongoing surveillance for similar diseasesyndromes in humans, there has never been a proven instance of peoplecontracting a disease from butchering or eating meat from CWD-infected animals.A World Health Organization (WHO) panel of experts reviewed all the availableinformation on CWD and concluded that there is no scientific evidence thatCWD can infect humans. However, there is much that scientists still do not knowabout CWD and one cannot state that transmission of CWD to humans isabsolutely impossible.\" March 27, 2002, The Washington Post:\"The number of British cases of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the rare andfatal human equivalent of 'mad cow disease,' is doubling every three years, eventhough measures to protect meat, the presumed source of the infecting agent,have been in place for nearly a decade. The continued growth of the epidemic ofvariant CJD almost certainly reflects the long delay between infection and theappearance of symptoms, rather than representing new infections, a Britishscientist told a gathering of infectious disease specialists.

We don't know because we simply don't know whatthe incubation period is.'\"Mad cow disease shocked the medical world when it spread from cattle tohumans in 1995.
