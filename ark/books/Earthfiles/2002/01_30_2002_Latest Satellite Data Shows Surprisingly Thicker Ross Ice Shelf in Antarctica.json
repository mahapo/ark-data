It has been thesource of Rhode Island-sized icebergs in recent years in what was thought to bea continual slow melting in slippery mud at the bottom where the heavy icelayer pushes against the continental land mass. Since the last Ice Age ended tenthousand years ago, icy \"rivers\" have moved along that mud base and dumpedConnecticut-sized icebergs into the sea in recent years.Two large icebergs, designated B-15A and C-16, are captured in this MISR nadir"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"camera view of the Ross Ice Shelf and Ross Sea in Antarctica on December 10, 2000duringTerra orbit 5220. Iceberg C-16 calved off the ice shelf in late September and is nearly 50kilometersin length. B-15A is left from the March 2000 iceberg that broke off nearly as large as thestate of Connecticut,and then into several pieces. Ross Island lies between 77 and 78 degrees south latitude andconsists ofseveral volcanic peaks, including active Mt. Erebus more than 12,000 feet high.

Before Dr. Joughin's research, old estimates said the Ross Ice Shelf waslosing 20 billion tons of ice a year. His new data indicates the ice is actuallygetting thicker at the rate of 26 billion tons a year.Interview:Ian Joughin, Ph.D., Senior Engineer, Jet Propulsion Laboratory RadarScience and Engineering, Pasadena, California: \"Understanding how andwhy these ice streams are changing their speeds is an important issue we arestudying. We've only been getting this data over the last seven or eight years andalready we've seen a lot more variability in glacier and ice stream speeds than wewould have expected to see. And we're trying to understand if this is a naturalvariability so that even if things were stable it just sort of oscillates around? Or isthere some trend there that could have an effect on sea level one way or theother?The way that part of Antarctica loses ice is that these large streams of ice,actually flowing ice within the ice sheet, carry the ice to an ice shelf such as theRoss and off to the ocean where it breaks off as large icebergs. So, iceberg\"calving,\" not melting, is how Antarctica loses snow. Otherwise, the snow wouldjust continue to pile up. In fact, we think the ice flows and iceberg creation areindependent of global warming at this point.The satellite images I studied were from instruments actually meant to makeradar images, but some people before I was even working on this figured out away to make measures of small land displacements. My particular application islooking at ice sheets, but this kind of technique can also be used to detect smalldisplacements of the earth's surface, such as when you have an earthquake. Youcan see all the displacement resulting from that earthquake. Or when a volcanois inflating or deflating during an eruption or prior to an eruption. You canactually see very small motions from space over wide areas. So, it's a verypowerful new technique.The part of Antarctica that I was looking at is sort of removed from the oceanbecause of the big ice shelf between the pole and the ocean. It is really so coldthere that climate change isn't having much of an impact. The reason we thinkthat ice is thickening in this region is because one ice stream, or river of ice,stopped moving about 150 years ago. That is well known. Another ice streamnext to it was thought to be discharging ice much faster than it could besustained by the amount of snow falling. And what our study found was that thisice stream has slowed down so much over the last twenty years that it is now not"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"really out of balance. So all the thickening in that other ice stream is where theice is piling up. And that's happening because that's where the ice streamstopped 150 years ago. That really pre-dates the internal combustion engine andit's hard to make any connection between it and global warming.Why did it stop 150 years ago?Well, part of the reason for the concern regarding this part of the ice sheet is thatit has sort of been steadily retreating over the last 10,000 years or so since theend of the last Ice Age. So the idea was that this retreat could continue on untilthe ice sheet disappeared and once the ice sheet had gone into the ocean, itwould raise sea level by several meters. And there is evidence that some timewithin the last 600,000 years, this event did happen that the ice sheet was goneand the sea level was higher. But what our results suggest now is that the icestreams are slowing down and at least one is stopping and one is slowing down.This long term retreat is coming to an end.Paradox of Ice Build Up: Ross Shelf Got Too Thin To Insulate Ground Nearly AMile BelowThe reason, we think, is that these ice streams are slowing because they aresitting on a layer of wet mud. You've got about 1,000 meters of ice on top of thislayer of mud that's lubricating the flow. Over time, the ice sheet has beenthinning. And the reason that mud is there even though the surface temperatureis very cold this thousand meters of ice acts like a blanket and insulates the bedbeneath the ice stream from the cold surface temperatures.As that blanket has thinned over the last few thousand years, it has gotten to thepoint where it is perhaps not thick enough to provide enough insulation. Thatstarts to freeze the water that is supporting that mud and removes the lubricationand causes the ice streams to slow down. In many ways, ice streams like theseact on their own cycles in terms of growth and decay and are definitely notforced by short term climate changes. They might be forced by long term climatechanges on a scale of several tens of thousands of years, sort of ice age cycletime scales.Is it fair to say that the scientific community studying the atmosphere hasbeen warning that there would be thinning of even the Antarctic ice andthis thickening of the Ross Ice Shelf comes as a surprise?I think it's a complex issue that has been over-simplified in the way it's beenexpressed in the press. Parts of Antarctica like where the Larsen Ice Shelf brokeup are much further north and warmer and in contact to the ocean and muchmore susceptible to climate change. There are also other glaciers in Antarcticawhich calve more directly into the ocean and they have closer contact with theocean. So they are sensitive to climate change.What would it take to seriously melt all of the Ross Ice Shelf?It would take a huge rise in temperature. I don't know exactly what that wouldbe, but to completely melt it away would take quite a lot. Probably 10 degreesor more.The 2001 Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change under the UnitedNations that accumulates data from laboratories around the world hasprojected that by the end of this century, there could be an increase in theaverage global temperature of 10.5 degrees Fahrenheit. Would thattemperature cause a major change in these ice flows that you have beenstudying?A temperature rise of that magnitude would cause much more melting in coastalareas of Antarctica and certainly a significant amount of melting in Greenland.It's a concern when ice and water come off the land masses because that'swhere sea level begins to rise further.Yes, ice that is already floating in either the sea or as an ice shelf is already"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"displacing its weight in water. It's already made its contribution to the sea level.But ice that is sitting on land and falls into the oceans is what we're worriedabout.Less Chance Now That Ross Ice Shelf Will Collapse and Suddenly Raise SeaLevelsWhat you are measuring would tend to support an opposite direction of icebuild up as opposed to its moving off the Ross Ice Shelf into the sea?Well, no, the area I'm looking at is that regardless of climate change, the RossIce Shelf on its own internal flow and dynamics could collapse. That was sort ofthe fear first raised in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The more over time thatpeople have studied the problem, the risks for that particular area have beendowngraded. Already there has been less worry about that area and the study wedid shows there is even less concern. This particular part of Antarctica willcollapse on its own irrespective of climate change.Until recently, the rivers of ice have fed off the land and into the oceans?They feed into the large Ross Sea there and that's where the Ross Ice Shelf is.So, this large, several hundred meter thick layer of ice floats and calves icebergsat the mouth of the bay. That's where you get the large New England state-sizedicebergs calving off. Much of that ice originated on land, flows into the top endof the Ross Ice Shelf and the ice breaks off into icebergs.Anything coming off the Ross Ice Shelf is contributing to sea level rise?In a sense. It doesn't contribute immediately at the time, but over time, whateverice breaks off, more ice is flowing in at the other end of the ice shelf to replaceit.The expectation has been that with an increase in average globaltemperature rise there would be an increased melt which would addsignificantly to sea level rise until your new research was published in theJanuary 18 journal, Science?Well, again, most of the research in this area hasn't been so tied to climatechange. There are other parts of Antarctica like the Larsen Ross Shelf - and thatreally is an area that's believed to be warming and has undergone a lot more melt- but this area even at the Ross Ice Shelf is pretty cold. There's not a lot of meltthere right now.The dynamics of the oceans and atmosphere are complex and as the earthwarms up, could there be something in that machinery that couldparadoxically cause the cold at the South Pole to maintain itself?It's a complex system, but warmer temperatures even in this area can have aneffect say by increasing or decreasing the amount of snow that falls each year.Now, in our particular area because we are looking at thickening due to icestreams that change their speeds, that doesn't really have anything to do withchange in accumulation. But certainly areas of Antarctica could thicken becauseyou get more snow accumulation even though the global climate was warming.Because there might be more water trapped in the atmosphere that wouldfall out as snow?Yes. You would have wetter and warmer air in the waters around the continent,but the continent itself would rarely have any melting. So you could depositmore snow on it.So, it is a paradox in the warming trend?Ye s .Do you know the last date there was no ice or snow in Antarctica?I don't know the dates, but a lot of that ice has been there for a long, long time.On the Antarctic Plateau at Vlostock, I think the ice cores go back over 400,000years. There has been ice there much longer than that. But in west Antarcticasometime in the last 600,000 years, there wasn't much ice there or much of theice disappeared and that could have raised sea level by a few meters."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Prior to 600,000 years ago, is it assumed there was no Antarctic ice cap?No, between the ice ages, there have been warm periods in the last 600,000years and this part of Antarctica did not have ice. But there was still a huge icesheet on the rest of Antarctica.Keeping Track of the Antarctic Ice In The FutureWhat is the next step in your research?Antarctica is a complex place and we were looking at one area. I have acolleague here, for example, who is looking at an area in western Antarctica sortof on the other side of the ice divide where he's seen some glaciers that arethinning rapidly. And so all of these different glacial systems seem to actsomewhat independently of each other and we need to collect a lot more data tobe able to do an assessment for the whole continent. Before you can say howmuch Antarctica is contributing one way or the other, you need to look at allthings, not just one glacial system.But I'm hoping that NASA will be able to put up a low earth orbit satellite thatwill orbit from north to south around the earth's poles, allowing us to see thewhole world every eight days.It seems we still don't know a lot about Antarctica in terms of how the icebuilds up and moves out and melts.Yes. When people were going out 20 to 30 years ago, they hardly knew wherethe ice streams were. In fact, a large part of the ice streams we only knew aboutin the last 5 or 6 years with good satellite observations. So, we're really justbeginning to get the data from space which really can get the whole kind ofcontinent scale picture. My personal priority is to understand how these icestreams change over the next decade or so since the Antarctic ice is such adynamic system.\"More Information:This color picture of Antarctica is one part of a mosaic of picturescovering the entire polar continent taken during the hours following spacecraft Galileo'shistoric first encounter with its home planet.
