Smith, Freedland Publishers \"The mutilators haven't made one misstep.They leave their calling cards, but no one has ever surprisedthem at their work. They leave too much evidence for any rationalperson to deny they exist, but never enough to be identified. No one evenclaims to have taken a picture of them. Afterward, of course, thousandsare taken. They're obviously playing with us like a cat plays with a mouse.And it's driving folks, including the authorities, right up the wall.\" Fredrick W. Smith asked on his 1976 book cover, \"Who did it? Why?How was it done without leaving a clue? Why are the facts suppressed?(This book has) Answers to questions that have baffled lawmen and ranchers throughoutthe west.\" Introduction Fredrick William Smith was born in Salmon, Idaho on October 21, 1920, andraised in Butte, Montana where his father was a miner until his death when Fredwas 8 years old. Then his mother moved the family to Denver. On May 5, 1945, Fred Smith married Grace Elizabeth Deaton. The couple hadseven children, four boys and three girls. Fred worked as a goat farmer, part-timeplumber and wrote. By the mid-1970s, he was puzzled by unusual cattle deathsin Colorado. Fred talked with law enforcement and ranchers in easternColorado and came to the conclusion that whatever was killing the animals, andbloodlessly excising tissue in similar patterns from animal to animal, was nothuman. In 1976, he published his investigation, not knowing that at the sametime Deputy Keith Wolverton in the Cascade County Sheriff's Office in Great"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Falls, Montana, was collaborating with writer Roberta Donovan to summarizethe sheriff's reports about mutilations in that region.

The calf was discovered in a pasture, along with three otherunmutilated dead cattle. Investigations failed to reveal the cause of death of the othercattle.\" o most people, Colorado means the high country, timberline, dozens of14,000 foot peaks, alpine lakes and meadows, the heartland of the Rockies withspectacular scenery wherever you look. That's not all of Colorado, however. Theeastern third, from the Denver foothills to the Kansas-Nebraska border, coveringalmost 150 miles, is a different country, the high arid plains, old buffaloterritory. The high plains immediately east of the Rockies aren't perfectly flat. After rising"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"slightly out of the Denver basin, they slope gradually eastward about ten feet permile. Drainage northward into the Platte and south into the Arkansas creates aslight hump in the center of the state north and south as well as east and west.The flat, dry, treeless landscape has been described by many as extremelymonotonous. what's most spectacular about that land is its immense sky, a deep blue highaltitude transparency falling away to the distant horizons all around, like anocean sky, but much bluer, drier and clearer, and bigger, too, since the landthere is rounder than the ocean. It's not a good place for things to hide in. Eaglescircling overhead can see and be seen for miles. Yet, something strange -- and in a way terrifying - has been happening recentlyin Colorado, throughout the west, and especially on the high plains immediatelysouth and east of Denver. Animals have been found mutilated, mostly cattle, butalso horses, sheep, goats and possibly dogs. The situation is completely baffling.Although at least 180 cases were reported in Colorado during 1975, the firstsolid clue to the mutilators' identity has yet to be discovered. The followingnews items present most of what is publicly known. The Glenwood Post, Glenwood Springs, Colorado, September 22, 1975 \"Garfield County Undersheriff told the Glenwood Post last week thatGarfield County was the scene of a cattle mutilation as early as Februaryof this year (1975). Hart also reported that on September 13, a Herefordcow was discovered mutilated just across the Garfield County line in MesaCounty. Missing were the animal's sex organs, rectum and an ear. \"As usual, the animal was cut up, genitals excised and no sign left thatwould give law enforcement authorities any clues as to who or whatcommitted the slaying. Hart said, 'There was no blood leading away fromthe kill. There were no tracks. There wasn't even a cigarette butt.' \"The February slaying involved two Hereford calves. Both animals hadbeen stripped of their hides along their front quarters. No meat had beentaken. There are also indications that slayings have occurred which havenever been reported to the police authorities. \"In the last several months, butchering cattle has been on the upswing.Hart attributes this primarily to the country's economic recession. Policeauthorities are aware that some mutilations take place only to obscure theprimary motive - that of obtaining some very fresh beef free of cost. Hartsaid, 'Whenever meat is gone, we don't classify it as a mutilation.' \"Theories abound as to who is committing the slayings. They includecontentions that they are being committed by a satanic cult and evencreatures from outer space. Hart is not willing to discard any possibility -no matter how outlandish. Hart doesn't even dismiss the interplanetarytheory. Although he thinks that would be the last of all explanations, hesays, 'In all my years of police work, I've had occasion to see things in thesky, along with other people, that none of us could explain.' \"When questioned about the possibility of a satanic cult being involved,Hart said, 'It could be. However, we have no evidence whatever to provethat.' The only thing Hart is willing to definitely say is, 'No doubt they area bunch of nuts of some kind.' \"The most baffling aspect of the slayings to law enforcement authoritieshas been the neatness with which the killings have been done. InColorado, slayings have occurred on open range land. Rarely are therefootprints or tire tracks around the carcasses. This differs from killingsreported in eastern states. In those eastern states, cattle were found inwooded areas where it is much easier to remain undetected. Ranchers and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"police are perplexed how the killers can continue to remain undetected onopen range. \"This is particularly true in Colorado's eastern plains. Hart detailed onecase in which a steer was found on open range, cut open at the ribs withthe heart excised.\" The same news item from the Glenwood Post tells of a Carbondale backpackerwho found two mutilated sheep while hiking in the high country. According tohim, \"It definitely was not any coyote. They don't neatly cut throats and leavewith the genitals.\" The loss of two or three hundred cattle throughout the entire state of Colorado,which raises three million for slaughter, at least 30,000 of which could beexpected to die annually of natural causes, isn't economically significant. Whatarouses such intense interest is the uncanny nature of the thing. Everyone whohears of it is fascinated and/or repelled. This includes the governor of Colorado,as is shown by the following news item. The Meeker Herald, Meeker, Colorado, September 4, 1975 \"Gov. Richard D. Lamm flew to Pueblo Monday afternoon to confer withthe executive board of the Colorado Cattlemen's Association concerningthe widespread livestock mutilations that have occurred throughout thestate. Calling the mutilations 'one of the greatest outrages in the history ofthe Western cattle industry,' Lamm pledged the full resources of the stateto help stop the mutilations and arrest the persons responsible. 'It is no longer possible to blame predators for the mutilations,' Lamm said.'It is clear from the evidence that only human predators can be responsiblefor these terrible offenses.' The Governor noted that the School ofVeterinary Medicine at Colorado State University had concluded thatmutilations were caused by humans using knives. 'It is important that we solve this mystery as soon as possible,' Lamm said.'The cattle industry already is hard hit from an economic point of view.From a humane point of view, and from an economic point of view, wecannot allow these mutilations to continue.' \"Lamm was accompanied to the meeting with the cattlemen by JohnMacIvor, Director of the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, which enteredthe case at the request of local law enforcement officials. The governortold the cattlemen he was asking all state agencies to cooperate fully withthe CBI (Colorado Bureau of Investigation), and local officials, and to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"provide any help needed to solve the case.\" If this mystery isn't solved, it won't be for a lack of trying. Some lawmen havesaid privately they would rather crack this than any case they've ever worked on.It would be interesting to calculate how much more the police work has costthan the comparatively paltry loss of two hundred beef. What's involved here isthe principle of the thing, rather than money, and the uncanniness of thephenomenon, the intense public interest, the sacred rights of property, the ruleof law and the loss of face for the law enforcement officials. The Gunnison County Times, Gunnison, Colorado, September 8, 1975 \"DENVER - The largest force of law enforcement manpower everassembled in the history of Colorado has been unable to find any answersto the questions about 150 cattle mutilations. And, the reports of slain andmutilated cattle are still coming in daily. Reports early this week disclosedthat other states experiencing the cattle mutilations in the past four yearsare now mobilizing a united effort to try to stop whoever is behind theseslayings and apprehend those responsible. \"The use of radar aircraft installations over a wide area is now beingemployed to help local law officers track unidentified aircraft or reportedsightings from area residents. A helicopter flying under 50 feet, however,may not show up on radar. If a helicopter were to dip behind a hill or landfor a short period of time, the radar may lose the unidentified aircraft. Lawenforcement officials are still facing many problems with how to trackdown reported sightings of helicopters flying without lights in the vicinityof mutilated cattle. \"A three state meeting of law enforcement officers has led to an agreementto share any and all information in the mutilation cases. Approximately 60law officers from Nebraska, Wyoming and Colorado met in Fort Morgan totry to coordinate an effort to apprehend those responsible for the multitudeof mutilations plaguing already hard hit ranchers and farmers in as many as10 or more states.\"CHECK LIST The Colorado Cattlemen's Association (CCA) issued the followingcheck list for ranchers:1. Check pastures and cattle regularly - daily if at all possible.2. If livestock mutilations or deaths are found: a. Do not go near or move the animal.b. Do not touch anything that would appear to be some physicalevidence toward what may have caused the animal's death ormutilation.c. Immediately call the CCA Office, collect, at 623-4347.d. Immediately call the local sheriff's office.e. Do not discuss the death with neighbors, or others until it has beenchecked by officials. 3. Report any suspicious vehicle movements of any type. a. If an automobile, try to obtain a description to include color, year,make, model, tag number, time of day, date and direction traveling.b. If an aircraft, try to obtain description, color, numbers, helicopteror fixed wing, single or multi-engine, time of day, date and directiontraveling. 4. Avoid publicity.5. Time is of the essence. During business hours 8:30 to 5 PM, callthe CCA Office at 623-4347. After hours, call David G. Rice, Jr.,237-4274, Doug Huddleston, 238-9894, or Margaret Maul,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"364-4133. \"This fact sheet is for Colorado residents only. Residents in other statesshould contact local law enforcement agencies immediately and local andstate cattlemen's associations. The recent meeting held in Fort Morganconfirmed 132 cattle mutilation deaths in Colorado with estimates nowindicating the number may be as high as 150. \"Mutilated cattle delivered to the Colorado State University veterinarypathology lab have, for the most part, been too decomposed to be able toascertain the cause of death. In one case, the cause of death was reportedto have resulted from natural causes before the mutilation was performed. \"CBI special investigator, Carl Whiteside, said that the removal of sexorgans and other body parts was definitely not made by predators. Theonly consistent item brought up was that a ranch or farm hit once was nothit again. \"Sheriff George Yarnell of Elbert County, Colorado, the hardest hit areawith 55 cattle mutilations that began in April, believes that helicopters arebeing used to transport the animals. He described circular impressionsfound around one slain animal to support his theory. He also reported thatabout 85% of the cattle mutilated in his area were found in hilly terrain. 'Ifhelicopters are being used, this type of area would cut down on lightingand noise of aircraft,' Yarnell said. \"There has also been some consensus by various ranchers studying theirmutilated animals that tranquilizer darts or injections are being used on thecattle. Colorado's U. S. Senator, Floyd Haskell, has called for the FederalBureau of Investigation to enter the case, since the incidence of cattlemutilations has covered several western states. \"All kinds of classes of cattle have been effected with many of the mostvaluable animals in the herd being struck down. Miscellaneous cases havebeen reported in the Dakotas, Wyoming, Nebraska, New Mexico andMontana, but Colorado remains the hardest hit to date. \"The number of cattle mutilations and the frequency of the slayings hascontinued to baffle Colorado law enforcement officials since April 1975.The Colorado Cattlemen's Association has offered a $5,000 reward for theapprehension of those responsible for the mutilations. Also, the MontanaStock growers Association has recently raised the reward in Montana from$250 to $1,000 for any information leading to the arrest and conviction ofmutilators.\" As this is being written, rewards offered for the arrest and conviction of cattlemutilators keep mounting and would make a nice bulge in the wallet to go withthe feather in the cap of the lawman who solves the case. In order to check outthe tranquilizer dart and injection theories, CSU (Colorado State University)animal pathologists have skinned out some carcasses very carefully examiningthe flesh and hides for tiny holes or other evidence of injections and havereported finding none. The helicopter theory is widespread because no tracks,blood, or evidence of struggle is apparent. Also, some carcasses appear to havebeen transported to unlikely locations apparently so they can be found moreeasily. Intense blinding lights from the sky are also reported to be a part of thephenomena.
