Astronomers Mike Brown andChadwick Trujillo, from the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, madea formal report in the October 7, 2002, Harvard Smithsonian Minor PlanetElectronic Circular, the Astronomical Journal and before the 34th AnnualMeeting of the Division of Planetary Sciences of the American AstronomicalSociety which began this week at the Sheraton Conference Center inBirmingham, Alabama.The new planetoid is currently being called the native American name, Quaoar,pending a name vote by the International Astronomical Union. Quaoar's locationis in the Kuiper Belt of icy bodies left over from the solar system's creation, oneand a half billion kilometers (900 million miles) beyond Pluto. Its diameter is800 miles, about half the size of Pluto. If all the 50,000 numbered asteroidsknown in the asteroid belt were combined, their mass would still not be as big asQuaoar."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Image courtesy CalTech.Today I talked with Dr. Brown about the significance of the large Kuiper BeltObject discovery and the ongoing debate about whether Pluto is really a KuiperBelt Object, too, and not a real planet.Interview:Mike Brown, Ph.D., Assoc. Prof. of Planetary Astronomy, CaliforniaInstitute of Technology, Pasadena, California: \"The most significant aspect isthat we have found the largest object in the solar system since the discovery ofPluto in 1930. What is clear to me is that the more we look (in the Kuiper Belt),the more we find and the more we look, the larger the objects we find. The factthat we have only looked for eight months through a small fraction of the skyand found this object really says to me there is a pretty good chance there willbe larger and larger objects out there. As Pluto was a very exciting discovery in1930 showing that the solar system extended further than originally thought,Quaoar(KWAW-waur) in June 2002 is showing the same thing, that the solarsystem continues on further than people realized.THERE CONTINUES TO BE THIS DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER PLUTO ISEVEN A PLANET OR COULD BE A LARGE KUIPER BELT OBJECT. NOW,THIS OBJECT IS ABOUT HALF THE SIZE?It's about half the size of Pluto, right.IF IT IS, WHY AREN'T THEY BOTH PUT IN THE CATEGORY OF KUIPERPLANETOIDS?I tell you what I would do. If I had a vote on how you would classify both ofthese objects, I would say that a planet if you want to be a planet, you should besignificantly bigger than anything else in your vicinity. Right now, Pluto is notsignificantly bigger than anything in its vicinity because now we know aboutQuaoar and we know that Pluto is not significantly bigger. So, I would classifyboth of those objects as particularly large, but just as Kuiper Belt Objects, wenow know about 600 other Kuiper Belt Objects in orbits beyond Neptune andthese (Pluto and Quaoar) are just currently the two biggest members.WHAT EXACTLY ARE THE KUIPER BELT OBJECTS?Kuiper Belt Objects are thought to be the remnant from the earliest time in thesolar system, about 4.5 billion years ago. Then the solar system was a largegaseous nebula shaped like a pancake, a flattened pancake, and planets werebeginning to form. Large planets formed close inside. Jupiter was the largestplanet that was formed inside. As we moved further out, Saturn, Uranus,Neptune get progressively smaller. By the time you get out past Neptune, thereis not enough material to form large planets like those four small planets, sosmaller objects form. Smaller icy form and those objects would have formedabout the same time or a bit later than the giant gaseous planets and have beensitting out there basically in deep freeze for the past 4.5 billion years."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Sun and solar system are drawn inside Pluto's Orbit which is inside the Kuiper Belt thatbeginsaround the orbit of Neptune and extends outward more than a billion miles toward the OortCloudmade up of billions of icy comets. One of astronomy's great mysteries is why there is adefinedboundary for the Kuiper Belt, a clear separation from the more distant Oort Cloud.Illustration courtesy NASA and JPL.HOW FAR IS THIS NEW QUAOAR?Quaoar is about 4 billion miles from the sun.THAT PLACES IT HOW FAR BEYOND PLUTO?About a billion miles beyond Pluto. So it's quite a ways out there.IS IT AN AUSTRALIAN WORD?No, the word is from the Tongva tribe indigenous to the Los Angeles basin andit's the name of their creation force.LIKE WHAT THEY WOULD SAY IS THE FORCE IN EVERYTHING?Right. Quaoar is a formless, genderless, force that sang and dance the entireuniverse into existence.WHAT BROUGHT YOU ASTRONOMERS TO USE THAT NAME?There is a name from the International Astronomical Union who controlsnaming of all objects in the sky, that objects in the Kuiper Belt like this one,have to be named after a creation deity in some mythology. Some of the objectswere named after your generic Greek and Roman mythology. We thought itwould be much more interesting and appropriate to name it after the tribe thatwas indigenous to the Los Angeles basin (near Pasadena and Cal Tech whereMike Brown and his colleague, Chadwick Trujillo, work to find Kuiper BeltObjects and discovered Quaoar.)DO YOU THINK THERE ARE MORE KUIPER BELT OBJECTS AS LARGE,OR EVEN LARGER, THAN THIS ONE?I would be willing to bet that in the next year or two, we will be finding objectsat least this large and I even expect we will be finding objects larger than Quaoarand probably even larger than Pluto.DOES THIS HAVE ANY CONNECTION TO ALL OF THE STORIES IN THEPAST FEW YEARS ABOUT A PLANET X ORBITING PERHAPS FURTHEROUT IN THE OORT CLOUD. THERE IS A HYPOTHESIS THERE IS ABROWN DWARF OUT THERE LEFT OVER FROM THE EARLY DAYS OF"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"OUR SOLAR SYSTEM WHEN IT STARTED OUT TO BE A BINARY STARSYSTEM?No connection. That hypothesis which is still open to a lot of debate and isgenerally not accepted by most astronomers that there is a large browndwarf-like object quite a bit further away. If there really is this brown dwarf, it'smuch more massive than Quaoar. It's even more massive than Saturn, Uranus orNeptune, probably. Maybe even Jupiter, probably even Jupiter. So, if this objectexists and I would say the jury is still out if this object exists, it is much moremassive and would not feel any effects from Quaoar. It's also sufficiently faraway that Quaoar would not feel any effects from it.This discovery does not really speak much to that one, except this discovery ofQuaoar is concrete. We see the object, we know it's there, rather than justhypothesizing it from some fairly subtle evidence.WHICH HAS TO DO WITH THE IMPACT ON COMET ORBITS.That's right.NO INFLUENCE ON COMET PATHS?No, it's probably too small unless a comet happened to come very close by, thesame way that Pluto is too small. We currently don't know of any definite effectsof Pluto on comet bodies or other bodies coming by into the solar system.WHY ARE YOU READY TO BET MONEY THAT THERE IS AN OBJECT INTHE KUIPER BELT THAT IS AS LARGE, OR LARGER, THAN QUAOAR?The reason is that we only started this survey of the outer solar system eightmonths ago. And eight months since we started the survey, we've covered maybe5-10% of the sky. In that time, we found Quaoar, we found in January an objectnot quite as big as Quaoar, but about half the mass of Quaoar. There is a prettygood chance there will be larger and larger objects out there. The Mystery of the Kuiper Belt's Abrupt BoundaryANY OTHER MYSTERY THAT YOU ARE ESPECIALLY INTRIGUEDABOUT AND DISCUSSING WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES IN THISPLANETARY MEETING DOWN IN ALABAMA?Yes, there is one big one and that is this. We know the Kuiper Belt startssomewhere just outside the orbit of Neptune, but we also know it ends fairlyabruptly a little bit outside the orbit of Quaoar. There is really no good reasonwhy that should be the case. All the original hypotheses about the existence ofthe Kuiper Belt would have suggested that it extends much further into space,and yet there seems to be a 'cliff' right there. We don't know why that is. We aretrying many different ways to see if there are other objects further out there. Oneof the hypothesis might be that there are some particularly large objects now I'mtalking about planets, not Kuiper Belt Objects large objects, maybe the size ofEarth or Mars that are much further out that are causing something that lookslike this edge to the known solar system. But for now, we don't know that. Allwe know is that there is edge and we really would like to know why that edge isthere.THE EDGE IS BETWEEN THE KUIPER BELT AND THE OORT CLOUD?Right. The Oort cloud is much further out and it's composed of objects thatdidn't form out there. They formed probably between Jupiter and Saturn andthen were flung much further out there.WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING IS THAT THERE MIGHT BE A LARGEPLANET-SIZED BODY STILL ROTATING OUR SOLAR SYSTEM THAT WEHAVE YET TO DISCOVER THAT COULD BE AT THAT DISTANCE MARKBETWEEN THE KUIPER BELT AND THE OORT CLOUD?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"It's speculation, but it's speculation that I think is worth considering. It's the typeof thing with the survey we are carrying out over the next few years, we shouldbe able to detect. I'm talking about something maybe the mass of Mars or Earth.GREAT COSMIC MYSTERIES, EVEN AT THE EDGES OF OUR OWNSOLAR SYSTEM.Yes, it's really quite fun!\"We b s it e :http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~chad/quaoar/http://www.ifa.hawaii.edu/faculty/jewitt/kb.htmlCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
