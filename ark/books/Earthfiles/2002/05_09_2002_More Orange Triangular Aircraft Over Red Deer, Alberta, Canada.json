May 9, 2002 Red Deer, Alberta, Canada - Since the first week of September2001, six nurse's aides at the Lacombe Nursing Home near Red Deer, Alberta,Canada have witnessed several flights of unidentified orange glowing triangularcraft during their night shift breaks. For background, please see previous09/22/01 and 10/27/01 Earthfiles reports that contain drawings of earliersightings. This morning, I received another phone call from nurse's aide, PennyPickett, about two more sightings. InterviewPenny Pickett, Nurse's Aide, Lacombe Nursing Home, Lacombe, Alberta,(near Red Deer) Canada: \"On the early morning of May 8 about 2:30 a.m.,another nurse who is new and I saw two of the orange triangles fly over duringour cigarette break in the early morning. And then early this morning at 12:25a.m., we saw them again for a longer period of time, maybe half a minute, andthere were six triangles. The nurse with me hadn't seen any before and she said,'Oh, my God, what are they? They are going way to fast to have any humansinside those ships. And they are so high up! I can't believe it. What are they?' So,we've seen eight of those triangles again since I called you April 20th aboutseeing fourteen in the sky all at once.\"Six Triangular Craft on Thursday, May 9, 2002at 12:25 a.m. MDT, over Lacombe Nursing Home:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"On May 9 at 12:25 a.m. MDT above the LacombeNursing Home near Red Deer, Alberta, Canada, nurse's aide Penny Pickettwatched six large, orange glowing, triangular aerial craft move rapidly across the skyin about fifteen seconds.

Drawing © 2002 by Penny Pickett. Penny Pickett: \"I was outside about five minutes to 4 a.m. MST, and looked upand saw four triangles. They divided off into two going northwest and the othertwo going southwest. Another nurse's aide, Beth Steiss, sat down with me and Itold her, 'I can't believe it. I've been thinking about these orange triangles everyday for about a week now and I can't believe they just showed up again.' Bethsaid, 'I wish I could have seen them.' And I said, 'Oh, my God, you can. Turnaround.' And there were fourteen of them and they were coming from the northgoing straight south. And they broke off into three groups of four and then all ofa sudden there were two more there and kind of went above all the others. So,there were three groups of four (12) and two more came off and kind of above(2). But no sound and they were brighter than they have ever been.That same cantaloupe or pumpkin orange?Ye s .The other nurse's aide saw these, too, right?Yes, clearly, and she has never seen them before. She's only heard us talk aboutthem.What was her reaction?Her mouth was just hanging down on to the ground.How high above you do you think the triangular craft were?Maybe a thousand feet at the most.If you extend your fist at an arm's length from you and look at how muchof the area that your fist covers at an arm's length, were the craft smaller?The whole cluster?No, each one of those triangles would be how big in comparison to yourfist?Each one of them would be at least two finger widths wide held out at arm'slength.So, each triangular craft is two finger widths wide and there were fourteenin the sky above you. How much space do you think they covered?Two hand widths open wouldn't have covered all of them.Were they flying in a formation?They were all in one cluster to begin with and then they broke off into the threegroups of four. And then two more came up and curled around kind of like birdsto sometimes flying above the rest of them. But there was no sound at all. Itfreaked me out because I have seen them too many times! This is my fifth andsixth times this morning, 3:55 a.m. MST our time here.Did you try to call police or other authorities this time since there werefourteen?No, I called Linda (another nurse) to come out and see if she could any morebecause we had to go in and do rounds. And to call the police in Lacombe, youhave to go through Red Deer and unless it's an emergency, you can't call 911 oryou get fined.You get fined if you call 911?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"If it's not a life threatening emergency. And how do you know if these are lifethreatening or not, you know?So far they haven't been, but the triangles certainly are unexplained.They are definitely unexplained. And it scares me. When I saw them today, I feltlike I was having a freaking heart attack because it scared me so bad.What were you scared of this time?I don't know. Normally, I'm calm when I see them. But today it scared me so badI started crying. It just kind of freaked me. It seems like the last times we've seenthem, something bad happened a few days later. Like we saw them around the5th of September and then on September 11th was the bombing (terrorist aircollisions with the World Trade Towers in New York City; the Pentagon inWashington, D. C.; and crash into Shanksville, Pennsylvania). That's what wentthrough me this morning when I saw them. Kind of fear that something badmight happen again. Because especially just the way they seemed to break offinto groups.It reminded you of something military?Yeah, and it's kind of scary. But yet, thrilling at the same time.Because it is so unexpected and unexplained.Yeah. And the numbers were so increased, to fourteen!Since this has happened so often since September 2001, could you nursesaides start taking a video camera to work to use on your breaks to try tocapture the orange triangles on tape?We've all talked about it, but none of us have cameras like that. And we're notsure we would be able to get anything because they move so fast. You know theway an airplane moves across the sky? These triangles seem to travel ten orfifteen times faster. Like it takes only fifteen seconds for them to go clear acrossthe sky from one end to the other.What sense did you have about the craft on May 9, 2002?It wasn't a fearful one because it's starting to become a common thing. LikeMaureen (other nurse) said to me after we saw them, 'Why are they flying overhere so often? Is it because no one can detect them here for some reason? Arethey too far away from major airports or military installations so nobody catchesthem on a scanner or anything? Is it safer for them to go this way over RedDeer?'A satellite went over right after these went by. Wouldn't a satellite pick theseup?\"More InformationIf anyone has any information about what the large, orange glowing, triangularaerial craft might be that have been seen by six nurses aides half a dozen timesover Lacombe and Red Deer since September 2, 2001, please contact me:Linda Moulton HoweReporter and EditorEarthfiles.come-mail: earthfiles@earthfiles.comFax: 215-491-9842"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
