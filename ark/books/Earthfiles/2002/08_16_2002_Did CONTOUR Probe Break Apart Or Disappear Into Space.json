At thatburn time, CONTOUR was over the Indian Ocean at 140 miles (225 kilometers),too low for NASA's Deep Space Network stations to track the spacecraft duringthe burn. All systems seemed to be OK going into the burn, but 45 minutes laterwhen the JHUAPL mission operations team tried to regain contact with theprobe, no signal was received. Since then, the scientists have been \"looking at the nominal path, as if the burnoccurred,\" Dr. Farquhar said. \"We're working on the assumption that the motorfired, and the team is putting its priority there.\" JHUAPL which built and managed the probe says that \"CONTOUR's on-boardcomputer is also carrying a command that about 24 hours after the scheduledburn time, the craft would turn about 40 degrees and perhaps improve itsantenna's fix on Earth.\" At first, scientists were optimistic that communication would be re-establishedwith CONTOUR. But this morning, Jim Scotti with the Spacewatch Project atthe Lunar and Planetary Laboratory at the University of Arizona, made an imagewith the 1.8 meter Kitt Peak telescope which might mean bad news. The imageshows two objects paralleling each other 250 kilometers apart near one of thepredicted positions for CONTOUR after the burn. So, one possibility is that theprobe broke apart."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The white and dark parallel trails ringed in green are unidentified objectsnear one of the predicted positions the Comet Nucleus Tour spacecraft wouldhave been after the August 15, 2002 burn to move out of the earth's orbit into space forits mission to study Comet Encke in 2003, Comet Schwassman-Wachman 3 in 2006 andperhaps Comet d'Arrest in 2008.

Arizona's Spacewatch office released the image with this description:\"In this subtracted image in which moving objects are revealed by pairs ofimages, one dark and one bright, there are two parallel trails near one of thepredicted positions of the CONTOUR spacecraft. Radio contact withCONTOUR was lost the day before (August 15, 2002) following a commandedlarge velocity impulse maneuver (rocket burn). These trails were discovered and measured by Jeff Larsen during hisre-examination of the data. The curvature of the trails is a natural characteristicof the drift scanning process at this high declination. The images are orientedwith north at the right and west at the top. The positive images are the earlier time. The fact that there are two trailsindicates that the spacecraft must have separated into two pieces that are stillmoving in nearly parallel directions.\" August 16, 2002 Teleconference Excerpts: Robert Farquhar, Ph.D., Comet Nucleus Tour (CONTOUR) MissionDirector, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel,Maryland: \"But when you try to do things that have never been done before,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"sometimes they are not successful. We haven't given up yet, but I'm a littlediscouraged with the news today of these space launch images. Later on today, we are going to be using the Arecibo radar along with the radarstation at Goldstone and try to do some radar bounces off of the contouredspacecraft. That will also give us some more information. There are also othertelescopes trying to confirm the observations of The Spacewatch team(University of Arizona). So, even though the news isn't very good, I think this allneeds to be verified. So we are going to continue to try to make contact throughMonday at the very least. Are there any alternatives you have here on earth to tune up the spacecraftand make it talk if it is still intact? Or do you have to be in a passive modeand wait to see it? The first thing we have to do is try to locate it in the sky, but we've probablybeen trying to make contact with it, but we have probably been looking in thewrong place. We have very narrow beam widths on the ground antennas. So,we've just been in a listening mode up to now, but we haven't heard anything.We've also tried to send commands up to try to turn on the transmitter or switchto a different antenna. Things like that. There are quite a few things we can gothrough and we have been going through. How far off from where you were looking was this found? It wasn't that far off. I think it was off about 3%. I mean it was back 3% fromwhere we would expect it (CONTOUR) to be, about 6/10th of a degree in thesky. So, fairly close. We haven't found any smoking gun about what could be wrong with the thing. Itseems that everything was OK going into the burn, but when it came out we justdidn't see anything. We haven't heard anything the entire time. Now, we did lookfor it in earth orbit and did not find anything. But with (this morning's) image, itshows pretty much that something is there. The only bad feature for us is thatthere are two objects there. There are two objects traveling in a parallel trajectory which could meanthe spacecraft has broken into two pieces? That certainly one conclusion one can make, yes. Could you explain the timer activation you talked about earlier, thepossibility of a backup system? If no commands are sent up to the spacecraft for 96 hours and the last commandwas sent up some time prior to the engine firing, then the spacecraftautomatically turns on both transmitters, works through the two processors onboard the spacecraft and does a round robin of all the transmitters oftransmitting out the different antennas. This takes quite awhile, something likeabout 30 hours to go through all the possibilities. Do we know if that does not happen would that be the time for you toconclude that the whole project is dead?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"That's another data point, of course. But this is when that will happen. This ison Monday and this is eastern daylight time. The first possibility is 4:09 a.m. andthen since we did send some commands up shortly after we noticed we weren'thearing from the spacecraft, so if those commands did get in, that could extendthis period out to about 10:09 p.m. on Monday. Then, if we don't hear anythingthen, we are going to caucus on Tuesday to see what the next step is. If the spacecraft did not split in two, is there any explanation for that spacelaunch image? Yeah, I've heard some people which I think is a little hopeful, but we'll grasp atany straws we can get right now, that they might be some insulation that cameoff the spacecraft. It is a magnitude less, an astronomical magnitude less inbrightness. But I'm not that optimistic about that. If you had a normal burn. Would there have been time for you to havegotten any kind of a glitch notification that if there was either an explosionor something had happened, would you have been able to pick that up? We weren't able to see the burn from any of the DSN (Deep Space Network)stations because it's a perigee burn and it's at a very low altitude, 225 kilometers.So, unless you were right over one of the stations, you wouldn't be able toobserve it. For some people, I guess there were some amateurs out trying to lookat it optically. I don't know if they were successful or not. We haven't trackedthat down yet. With a solid rocket motor, once you light it, it's going to go allthe way. It's going to do something. But we don't know the details of whathappened to the motor itself during the burn. If you do re-establish contact with this spacecraft, how far back would thisset the mission? If the spacecraft is still operating, it doesn't set us back in the slightest becausewe have enough fuel to make any necessary orbit corrections and the missionwould go on as usual. What we have to do is contact it and then find out whatthe status is. Looking at this image, I don't feel very good about it. If the two objects are the spacecraft, how far are they away today? They are roughly about 250 kilometers apart from each other. And 400,000kilometers from earth. That's where this image was taken. When will the Arecibo attempt be made? And is NORAD involved as well? Arecibo is working with Goldstone and that attempt will be made tonight.NORAD, as far as that goes, JPL navigation had requested some help from them,but as far as I know, they didn't see anything. They were mainly looking for thespacecraft in earth orbit and they did not see it yesterday. What will the impact of this loss have on comet science and how longwould you speculate it would take to duplicate this data? That's a good question. It's difficult for me to answer right now because of mypersonal involvement in this thing for such a long time. I wrote my first paper ongetting to Encke's Comet in 1972. So, I've been at this for 30 years. I would like"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"to have gotten some images and I've sort of given up. It's pretty bleak. As far as how important this is. Encke's Comet is a very unique object. It's beenin its present orbit for thousands of years and it comes around every 3 1/3rdyears and comes very close to the sun. So, it is a big mystery about why it is stillso active. that's one thing. We were also going to follow up that with a flyby of Comet Schwassman-Wachman 3 which has recently split up into several pieces. Both of these thingswould have been things done for the first time.\" http://www.contour2002.org http://spacewatch.lpl.arizona.edu/contour.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
