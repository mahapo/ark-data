Nuclear Power Plants On Heightened AlertAfter Nuclear Regulatory Commission Warning© 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe103 nuclear power plants in the United States above supplyabout twenty percent of the natin's electricity. Some states such as Kansashave only one reactor. Others such as Pennsylvania have nine reactors,including Three Mile Island which is near the Harrisburg International Airport.Graphic © 2001 by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.May 25, 2002 Washington, D. C. - This Memorial Day weekend, the U. S.government has announced several terrorist threat warnings. The latest came fromthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission placing all 103 nuclear power plantsthroughout the country on a heightened state of alert. This weekend the FBI alsowarned of possible underwater terrorist attacks by scuba divers that could targetnuclear power plants as well. Recently intelligence sources warned that on theFourth of July, Pennsylvania's Three Mile Island (TMI) could be the target of an AlQaeda attack. In fact, there is concern that spent radioactive fuel could be stolen toproduce a dirty bomb to be set off at nuclear power plants.Three Mile Island nuclear power plant near Pennsylvania's state capitol,Harrisburg, and the Harrisburg International Airport.

Nuclear power plantoperators depend upon computers and other electrical devices to control reactorcores and cooling. If electric wires and cables are destroyed in an initial destructiveimpact, even back up electrical generators could be destroyed as well.The American Federation of American Scientists argues that terrorist attacks onnuclear power plants or the smaller atomic bombs known as \"suitcase nukes\" are lesslikely to happen than explosions of \"dirty bombs.\" Terrorists can more easily makedirty bombs from the cesium in radioactive medical equipment, cobalt used in foodirradiation plants, americium used in the oil industry and other radioactive industrialsources. The idea is to wrap the radioactive material around dynamite and dispursethe radioactive debris into the air. Once inhaled by people or animals, the risk ofcancer rises dramatically. In addition to cancer, the stones, bricks, wood, cement,asphalt of a city could become so contaminated with radioactivity that demolitionand removal of entire city blocks might be necessary.Imagine if half of Manhattan were irradiated by cobalt fall out from a terrorist's dirtybomb and became unlivable or that millions of people living on the islandpsychologically had to leave in order to have some peace of mind. Relocatingmillions of people and losing one of the world's main financial centers has beenunthinkable until now in the post 9-11 world.In this report, I interview a physicist from the American Federation of Scientists whois an expert about dirty bombs and suitcase nukes. But I begin with an update aboutwhat is happening to Three Mile Island security right now from Scott Portzline wholives near there and who has worked as a concerned citizen since 1984 to monitorthe plant after its partial core melt down threatened the health and safety of theHarrisburg region. Scott has never felt completely safe since then because he doesnot think nuclear power plant security has yet been improved enough to make plantsinvulnerable to terrorist attacks."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Scott Portzline, Former Security Chairman,Three Mile Island Alert, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.Sportzline@home.comFor eight years, Scott Portzline helped the volunteer civilian Three Mile Island Alertgroup monitor radiation and security. He has testified before the U. S. Senate, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguardsand before other governmental bodies in an effort to close security gaps that he hasfound. His research has been cited by the U. S. Department of Energy and variousmilitary branches. Portzline also maintains a data base of lost and stolen radioactivematerials in the United States. I asked Scott what the consequences might be if alarge aircraft or a suicide truck bomber slammed into Three Mile Island.Video frame taped by Scott Portzline on January 31, 2002beginning at 4:13 p.m. when a pickup truck drove into the mainnorth entrance of Three Mile Island and stopped voluntarily. There wasno guard in the guard house and both the horizontal gate and the black andwhite striped lift gate were open. Video frame © 2002 by Scott Portzline. Interview:Scott Portzline, Former Security Chairman for Three Mile Island Alert(TMIA), Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: \"Three Mile Island has recently admitted it isnot designed to withstand the impact of some of the larger aircraft like a 747 or 767.Even without penetration into the containment, the resulting fires could knock outenough systems that they lose control of the plants through the electrical systemsthat control the core.But assuming penetration of the containment building and a full scale attack andfire, you could have the entire state of Pennsylvania rendered uninhabitable andeconomically not viable for decades. This comes from a report done by MITProfessor in the 1970s named Norman Rasmussen. It was for the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission's \"Severe Accident Consequences.\" He described the worst casescenarios where an area the size of Pennsylvania could be rendered unusable anduninhabitable for decades. So, the cost would be getting up towards trillions ofdollars. Tens of thousands of people would end up dying from cancers in the next 20or 30 years. Leukemias possibly in the first couple of years, we could see hundredsof leukemia cases. It depends on the wind blowing and it depends on how fastpeople can evacuate.As we have seen in the hurricanes of Florida, some people were only able to travel20 miles in 24 hours. And we think the same thing would happen here if Three MileIsland were attacked. There's a lot of roads in Pennsylvania, but there's an awful lotof traffic in the first 20 miles concentric around that plant.In the month of May 2002, the FBI has put Three Mile Island on a list ofpotential targets by Al Qaeda. It's not specific about what form the attackmight take, but it certainly made headlines. Since that FBI declaration, haveyou seen any change in the security operations at TMI?Well, Three Mile Island added state police and the national guard. They did heed to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"my advice where they made the setback distances to protect from truck bombs morethan 400 feet. It used to be only 125 feet, so that was a problem.I got a letter from my U. S. representative saying that the national guard does airpatrols over the northeast and the details are highly classified as to flying missionsall across the United States to protect the nuclear reactors and that they couldrespond to any hijacking that comes up. But the problem that comes up here atThree Mile Island is corporate sized jets flying into the Harrisburg InternationalAirport which is only 2.5 miles from Three Mile Island or another airport that isabout 5 to 8 miles away, they fly very close to Three Mile Island. In fact, when theycome in for a landing, they fly right through the mist of the cooling towers. That stillis happening today. There isn't a No Fly Zone at Three Mile Island. And so, there isno time for the national guard air patrols to intervene in such a case.There are things they can do additionally at the nuclear power plants where we stillare only relying on jets being able to respond to a known threat. But at Three MileIsland it's very unusual in the country because it's so close to an international airportand the planes fly over on a regular basis. If we used a radar-guided missile, orcomputer-guided missile, there is still the chance for failure and lock on to other airtraffic and I don't want to see them hit. But a Phalanx gun uses a bullet, a rapid firebullet, which would take away from some of the dangers of the missiles.There is still collateral damage going to occur. At that point you would have tomake decisions for national security whether the loss of the plant and the radioactivecontamination is a worse trade off than the lives of people on a jet airliner.The last time we talked after 9-11, there was concern on your part that you hadvideotaped the fact that the security guard gate at the front was still being leftup and this was after the 9-11 problem when it took security several hours justto hook up the electricity to get the gates closed.That's right.Now we're in May 2002 with the FBI issuing alerts that Al Qaeda might attacka nuclear power plant in the United States, specifically Three Mile Island. Hasanything changed in your observations about that security gate being closednow on a regular basis with guards there 24 hours a day?No, the barrier is still open. I call it the vehicle barrier or gate. It is still wide open.And they have increased the number of patrols, but I have never seen the nationalguard patrolling the island. They claim it does, but I have never seen that yet.The problem with the open gate is that a large truck bomb from even a quarter of amile away from the nuclear reactor could break pipes because of the ground shockwave. There is a tremendous blast that is propagated through the ground that createsa lateral acceleration that far exceeds that during the peak magnitude of anearthquake.What you mean is that even if an airliner was not in the attack, a large suicidetruck bomber could barge through fast and end up exploding with such animpact that it could break the pipes and tubes that cool the reactor.That's right. You could have a loss of coolant from lateral acceleration that snapspipes through the shock waves that travel through the ground, not the air. And ithasn't been studied properly. And until the study has been done, they should keepthat gate closed at the entrance of TMI so that no traffic is permitted onto the island.Because once a vehicle is on the island, they would be only about a quarter of amile away from the reactor. From that distance, it's not certain the reactor pipescould survive that kind of shock. Another thing that can happen is even if they don'tbreak the main cooling pipe from that type of wave, there could be the breakage ofother water pipes which create water jets and can short out electrical systems andyou lose control of the reactor. Or lubricating oil pipes break and then they becomelike a blow torch and cause fire and you use control of the reactor. Or just thesimple metal fragments that explode and go throughout the area can cause fires,possibly taking out the emergency diesel generator building. There is quite a bit toworry about because they still haven't decided to close the vehicle barrier at the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"north entrance of TMI.Recently The New York Times had an article entitled, 'Post 9-11 QuestionsAbout Security At Electric Plants.' It quotes the former FBI investigator, JimKallstrom, as saying: 'There is nothing more of a national security asset thanthe power grid.' He is very concerned about security weakness. Could youcomment on this?One of the biggest concerns at the nuclear power plants is called station black outwhere the loss of off-site power can contribute to loss of electrical control of thereactor system. So what we can foresee is an attack against the electrical grid whereoff site power is lost and the plant is put into the condition known as station blackout. At this point, the diesel generators have to fire up at the plants themselves. Theyare emergency diesel generators to supply electricity to bring the plant to a safe shutdown. But the loss of those generators can result in a meltdown and they have sometroubles on a regular basis.Recently, the NRC has been extending the times they are allowing for the repairs tothese diesel generators used to be 72 hours to 2 weeks and even a month now. Sothis is new in the last year where the NRC is actually reducing its safety levels. Andthere is no good reason for it. It's just gambling, rolling the dice, hoping that nothingwill happen. So I'm hoping to file a petition for rule making with the NuclearRegulatory Commission to require a mobile diesel generator. It would serve twofunctions for safety and security. If there was ever an attack on a nuclear plant or ajet liner that takes out the switch yard and they lose off -site power and the resultingfires also destroy the emergency diesel generators, there could be a mobile unit thatis parked several thousand yards away from the reactor sites, started up within a fewminutes and driven up to electrical box connections, may be two or three around theplant and restore power. This seems to me to be a logical step and a part of depth ofdefense, they call it the trade term is that they like to say we have so much 'defensein depth.' But the truth is in electrical systems, it's only two deep: the off-site powerand the emergency diesel generators.Yes, there are some batteries that can supply power and they do have some steam-driven pumps, but those will not work long enough to bring it to a successful shutdown.The bottom line is that if electrical power is cut off to a nuclear power plant,then the ability for the technicians to control the plant and to keep it fromgoing into a meltdown is going to depend upon back up power.Yes, and what happened in Ohio - that's the reactor that recently had the hole eatenthrough the steel where it was almost to the point of causing a loss of coolantaccident a few years ago a tornado struck the plant and took out the off-site power.It went into station black out. One diesel generator overheated and another didn'tstart up properly and the operators said their hearts went up into their throats for afew minutes.\"Continued in Part 2.
