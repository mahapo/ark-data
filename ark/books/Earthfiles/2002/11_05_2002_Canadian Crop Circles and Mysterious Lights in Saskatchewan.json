The particular southeast region of the province shown in this mapis one of the hot spots where patterns keep appearing year after year. In 2002, Punnichyin the far left circle had a series of four formations in wheat. The latest in the season, a9-circle pattern discovered by a pilot on October 10, 2002, was discoveredin a Kamsack wheat field, upper right circle.November 5, 2002 Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada - Paul Andersonof the Canadian Crop Circle Research Network (CCCRN) has received his 19thcrop circle report for 2002. It is a pattern of nine circles. It is not known howmany of the connecting pathways were part of the original pattern design andhow many were paths made by curious residents. The largest of the nine circleswas approximately 55 feet in diameter. It was found in mature wheat near thesmall rural town of Kamsack in southeastern Saskatchewan by a pilot flying overthe field. He took a photograph that was printed by a local newspaper shownbelow.Aerial photograph printed in local newspaper, taken by pilot whodiscovered wheat formation on October 10, 2002 near Kamsack, Saskatchewan.To the west is the small farming community of Punnichy (pun-ney-chigh) wheremysterious lights have been reported for decades, along with animal mutilationsand crop formations. In early September of 2002, there were a series of fourformations, all in wheat.Punnichy 2002 Formation Number One:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Punnichy Formation Number One diagram© 2002 by Paul Anderson, CCCRN.The first was a pattern of three circles in a triangle joined together by pathways,approximately 20 meters (65 feet) diameter. The plants were laid downcounterclockwise in all three circles. Two pathways laid from the center pointtoward two of the circles. Another pathway from the third circle laid toward thecenter point. Sporadic 'burn marks' were found in the formation.

About 6.4 kilometers (4 miles)southeast of first formation. Since mysterious luminosities have been seen in association with cropformations in England, Holland, Canada and other places, I asked several farmowners in Punnichy if they had seen any unusual glowing objects near the fieldswhere the crop formations were. No one had a specific 2002 incident, but manytold me that all their lives they have heard about mysterious lights in Punnichythat seem to haunt a road in the farm country. Some have been spooked by thelights. The most dramatic encounter happened to Marilene Senft, who was bornin Punnichy 44 years ago. When she was a teenager, she was driving from herhome to her boyfriend's house at 8 o'clock in the evening when she saw a lightthat stayed with her for the next seventeen miles of winding country road.Interview:Marilene Senft, Customer Service Representative, Bank of Montreal,Winyard, born and raised in Punnichy, Saskatchewan, Canada: \"At first Ithought it was just a yard light, right? Then I realized there were no yard lightsaround that area at that time. It did not bother me until it came closer and closerand it was a really brilliant light. It followed me and scared me because I hadheard stories of this light. It actually came into my car. It seemed like it cameinto my car and stayed with me and then it would go and follow me. Right at myhusband's place - at the time he was my boyfriend - and when I got to his yard toturn in, it just disappeared.CAN YOU DESCRIBE SOME OF THE COLORS, FEATURES, SIZE, ANDWHEN IT ENTERED THE CAR, WAS IT COMING THROUGH AN OPENWINDOW, THE GLASS OR WHAT?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"There was no windows open, so it was coming through the glass.
