It hadbeen raining for several days. Fields were full of mud and not conducive forpranksters, so the Malletts immediately drove out to see the condition of theplants while still fresh. I talked with Charles the next day, July 10, about hisimpressions.Interviews:Charles Mallett, Crop Circle Researcher and Co-Owner with FrancesMallett of The Silent Circle Cafe, Cherhill, Wiltshire, England: \"This newone is a few hundred meters from that June double spiraled serpent formation inthe next field. This time the crop is young wheat as opposed to elderly barley inwhich the coiled serpents went down.The weather has been absolutely dismal here. You wouldn't believe it, Linda! It'slike January. It's been raining every day for the last week or so. It was actuallystormy rain on the night this formation happened which must have been thenight of July 8 going into the 9th. When the formation was reported to us, we"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"figured it was not going to be a hoax or anything silly. We thought it would bevery clear in the plants and muddy ground. If it were a bunch of guys trompingaround in the field in the rain in southern England now, they would make ahelluva mess. No way to avoid it.When we got there, it looked like a couple of people had visited earlier in theday. There was one very small tract going into the formation that looked like acouple of people had walked in. But essentially, the formation was very clean,very crisp and neat.It's a flattened triangle in this wheat with a flattened circle on each point. Iwould say the circles were about 25 or 30 feet in diameter, each. The three sidesof the triangle are 50 feet, maybe.West Overton, Wiltshire, England, triangle with a circle at each vertex reported on July 9,2002.Each circle at corners of triangle about 30 feet in diameter. Side lengthsof triangle about 50 feet. Pole shot © 2002 by Charles Mallett.Is that similar to the Barbury Triangle?It's not actually, but it's interesting that you should say that because myimmediate impression upon seeing it from an adjacent hill is that it looked kindof Kabalistic, that brand of ancient Christian mysticism. For some reason, itstruck that chord with me. It's far less sophisticated than the 1991 Barburytriangle and much smaller and much less complex.Nonetheless, it is cleanly \"cut\" (no physical cutting crisply, neatly laid down)into the field. Coming off each corner, we have one point pointing straight upthe hill in the formation facing the road. Coming off the top outside the mainbody of the formation is a couple of laid areas in the shape of rectangular boxesand above those an arc, or letter \"C,\" also laid out. That's clearly the top of theformation.Arc over rectangles above the circle seem to indicate the \"top of the formation.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"One of the rectangles is slightly twisted off center. Pole photograph © 2002 by CharlesMallett.One of the boxes of these arcs is very slightly twisted in relationship to the mainbody of the formation, which is interesting. At two lower points of theformation, we have strings of receding circles sort of disappearing down the hill.Circles taper in size away from on both sides of the triangle.Pole photo © 2002 by Charles Mallett.One or two other interesting little glyphs are dotted around the formation. Thewhole thing probably covers about 180 feet across the field. It's consistentlyneat pretty much over the whole thing.It's an interesting formation and to me, my first impression was some weirdspaceship, very mechanical, like a machine-type looking.In contrast to how the plants were laid down at Stonehenge or in thedouble coiled serpents at West Overton, how were the plants laid down inthis triangle compared to the other two formations?I would say the formation down at Stonehenge is a separate agency. In my mind,there is no doubt at all. The Stonehenge formation, as we discussed in yourearlier Earthfiles.com report on July 5, seems to be very related to the 1999Hackpen Hill spiraling formation. The agency involved down at Stonehenge I'mabsolutely certain is the same agency that created Hackpen Hill. I went in bothformations on day one. They were essentially the same.When you look at these crop formations every day, or every few days, youperceive subtle things about the way they are laid out, just the way they arearranged in the field and around or on topographic details things that casualvisitors might not notice. So, Stonehenge and Hackpen Hill are related.In comparison, this latest formation at the West Overton location of thedouble spiral, is not the same hand or agency whatever you care to call it there is no way it's the same as Stonehenge. I don't know why or what'sgoing on, but it's not.I mean, it's very neatly done, but it seems much more mechanical, much moreaggressive. It was kind of flatter to the ground. Down at Stonehenge, when wewere standing on the crop, it was like a carpet sinking under your feet. We werecrushing the plants with our feet that had been laid down very subtly and gently.Over at West Overton in the triangle and in the spiraling double serpentformation, they seemed to be pretty flat, fairly mechanically done. Just a lotmore harsh, for some reason. Even though the edges and everything about thepatterns suggest they are genuine events as far as we're concerned because theyare so inconsistent with the typical efforts of the average hoaxers that we areaware of. There doesn't seem to be any doubt about that!"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Neat, crisply edged West Overton formation in wheat reported July 9, 2002did not, to Charles Mallett's eyes, have the same elegant, fluid crop lay of the July 4, 20026-fold geometry at Stonehenge. Pole photograph © 2002 by Charles Mallett.Having come in rain, for people to have worked on these formations in therain and mud without leaving evidence of mud somewhere on the plantsjust doesn't seem quite feasible?No. As you know, I've walked around in a lot of corn (cereal crops) fields in alot of bad weather and I can absolutely assure you that you cannot walk up anddown tramlines in a crop field in southern England in the rain without makingone helluva mess. Most noticeably, the weather conditions were the same whenthe huge, amazing formation turned up at Stonehenge. Linda, that wasabsolutely pristine and clean.If you put your foot on a gently laid bed of wheat, you're going to leave a bigfootprint. Even if it's not muddy, you still leave a big footprint. When it'smuddy, you leave a horrible mess. You can't help it, as simple as that. None ofthat was present at Stonehenge and the West Overton triangle was pretty similarin cleanness when we first went in it.\"More About Holland and German Crop Formations in Upcoming ReportWe b s it e s :http://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://home.clara.net/lucypringlehttp://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.invisiblecircle.deCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
