March 30, 2002 Narrowsburg, New York - Since the dry, warm fall andwinter of 2001-2002, rivers on the East Coast of the United States have reachedthe lowest levels on record. In December, it was so bad in the CannonsvilleReservoir of the Delaware River watershed that its muddy bottom was exposedfor the first time since it was built. That reservoir, which helps provide water toManhattan, had only 3% of its water capacity. In fact, half the drinking water forNew York City comes from three reservoirs in the Delaware River watershed andall three right now have less than half their normal water levels."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Wells have run dry in Maine and New Hampshire. Georgia and South Carolinaare suffering from three years of consecutive drought. West Texas, Colorado,New Mexico and Arizona are drought tinderboxes. More than half the UnitedStates now is facing water shortages and it's only March. What happens over thenext five months as temperatures rise into the summer and an El Nino brewing inthe Pacific begins to affect weather patterns, further reducing moisture along theEast Coast?This week I talked with Bill Douglass, Executive Director of the UpperDelaware Council, Inc., in Narrowsburg, New York. His council oversees the bigDelaware River watershed. He and his colleagues are now very concerned aboutthe low reservoir levels. Interviews:Bill Douglass, Executive Director, Upper Delaware Council, Inc.,Narrowsburg, New York: \"These reservoirs have gone to extremely lowcapacities over the past several months. In fact, back in December, the onereservoir was down to approximately 3% of its capacity.Only 3%?Yes, that's the Cannonsville Reservoir.That would mean you were seeing mud in the bottom?Oh, definitely. I think the lowest I'd ever heard it go down to in the past wasapproximately 17%. Typically there would be a couple feet of snow up in theCatskill Mountains and that would come out in the spring rains of March, Apriland May. But right now, there is little to no snow pack in the mountains.What is the demand for water in New York City?The figure I've heard most recently is approximately 1.5 billion gallons of watera day is what they use.If you take that against all three reservoirs being less than half of whatthey should be ...Right.And this is March 29. How serious is it if we do not get rain this spring andgiven the fact there is no snow pack?Well, I think in the upper basin above say Port Jervis, New York, where the threestates come together, we were running a deficit of about 12 inches of rain fromthe past year. We typically get roughly 43 or 44 inches of rain a year. So, thatdeficit is what has lead us into this drought. And without the snow pack thatwould normally help refill, the word I'm getting from experts in the field is thatthis coming summer, if we haven't made significant impacts on bringing thatdeficit up, we are going to be in very serious trouble to meet all the waterdemands that we have here.The three issues that we're looking at here are:1) The ground water levels and the wells that are tested by the State ofPennsylvania on a regular basis, many of those wells have had record lows inthem in the past several months.In fact in New Hampshire and Maine, people have been having to hirepeople to drill new wells trying to find new water because there older wellshave all gone dry.Yes. So, that's one aspect of the whole water regime. Ground water levels are"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"low.2) The second is the stream levels are also low. That's in part based on theground levels because the base that flows out of any stream is contributed by theground water that flows into them. 3) And the rivers are dependent upon snow pack and there is no snowpack.That's correct.So, in all three categories, there is no prognosis for there to be a suddenincrease of water in the near future.Right, because we have ground water problems, we have snow pack and streamproblems and we've got reservoir storage problems.We are just starting into spring with a likely hot summer coming,especially if we go into an El Nino which usually increases temperatures onthe East Coast.Sure, and as soon as the vegetation starts growing, the grasses and trees, they aregoing to start sucking up ground water and typically the ground water levels willstart going down again because of the uptake by the vegetation.Is it fair to say that all the officials you are talking with are extremelyconcerned about water rationing this summer?Oh, yes, yes, they are.A big question is: if through the 1990s and into 2002 every year it has beenwarmer and warmer and that is hard data. If we are now beginning to seean offshoot result of global warming coming in no snow pack and less andless water, has anybody been working on a projection that if the reservoirsgo empty, the ground table water gets lower and lower, what happens whenthere is no water to provide these populations? Where do we turn to ifthere ids no water in the normal places? Do we have to import bottledwater from other states?I'm sure there will be some of that going on. The city of New York does have asmall operation it could turn on for withdrawing some water from the HudsonRiver. They have a plant that's in existence. They've used it only once or twice inthe past several decades.But that wouldn't provide a billion and a half gallons a day.No, not even close. But it would be a supplement.Would you say right now it is a fair speculation that the city of New Yorkand surrounding region might be faced with such serious rationing thissummer if this drought persists that even taking baths and showers mightbe really limited?If the drought situation continues without the reservoirs filling, those types ofactivities would certainly be curtailed.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"More than half the United States is suffering low water levels in rivers as of March 29,2002.

As inthe Delaware River watershed, ground water is drying up in many regions. Morethan a thousand wells have gone dry in small towns in Maine and NewHampshire which have had the driest winter on record. Some residents have paida lot of money to drill new, deeper wells; others are buying and hauling drinkingwater from springs in other towns. Western states such as Arizona, New Mexico,California and Colorado are worried about fires. Ranchers in the NorthernPlains don't have enough water to support their cattle herds and Montana wheatcrops are down 45% from where they were in the mid-1990s. Farmers inGeorgia and South Carolina are trying to survive after three years of drought andstunted crops.

If this continual"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"warming trend is a product of general global warming caused by greenhouse gasbuild up, will severe droughts become more common? I talked about the currentnation-wide drought with Don Wilhite, Director of the National DroughtMitigation Center at the University of Nebraska in Lincoln.Don Wilhite, Ph.D., Climatology, Director of the National DroughtMitigation Center, University of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska: \"In terms ofglobal warming, the point needs to be made that you can't take a single episode,a single event, whether it's a drought or hurricane or a flood event and say, 'Ah,that's an indication of global warming.'A shift to persistent global warming since the 1980s,graph courtesy NOAA National Climatic Data Center.But we've had more than a decade of progressively warmer temperatures.Yes, and the probability of getting warmer each year in consecutive years is very,very low. And so, one point that people who are supporters of the concept andtheory of global warming, they would say the likelihood of that occurring is solow that something has to be going on. There are some, a few, disbelievers outthere. But you can also look at other events: the number of extreme rainfallevents around the world and those have been going up. The records we havebeen breaking in not just global mean temperature, but also looking at meantemperatures in terms of this past winter or this past December, January andFebruary, individual months for many parts of the country.Another indicator is just the occurrence of more extreme events which is whatyou would expect with global warming so you would not have just maybe morefloods, but also more droughts and more heat waves and a whole variety ofthings. There is a lot that is going on here and the weather is very complex andthe climate system very difficult to predict with any accuracy."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"What is the forecast for fire threat this summer if we have droughtconditions in over half the United States?Well, the prognosis right now is not very good. I was just reading a report todayfrom Colorado and Colorado is reporting dryness in a lot of the forested areasthat is equal at this point in time to what they would normally be in the middleof summer. It is a situation we see in New Mexico right now and Arizona whichis extremely dry and Colorado is extremely dry, West Texas, and then a lot ofother parts of the west, plus the whole East Coast that we talked about.Given the fact that this is just the end of March and we have a long way togo through August, what is the worst case scenario that you can seedeveloping in the United States?Well, in the western U. S., you're going to see that you're not going to get muchrecovery.Meaning there isn't going to be much rain?Yes, the situation particularly in the west where they rely so heavily on snowpack and then the runoff to fill reservoirs and to feed irrigation systems andhydroelectric power and all of that - if you don't have a snow pack, that's whatgets you through from one year to the next. The snow season is almost over. So,it's unlikely that in most of the western U. S. where they depend on snow pack,if they don't have it now and much of the western U. S. is in a situation of say 50to 70% normal snow pack - it's unlikely that they are going to make up thatdeficit at this point.Now, in other parts of the country, you could as we were talking about NPRtoday, there could be a situation where precipitation begins to return to normaland if you average 5 inches in the month of April, that you get your five inches.That's going to alleviate a lot of problems for let's say the homeowner who wantsto water their lawn - natural rainfall is going to take care of a lot of that.But what if there is no more natural rainfall? what if we are in a periodwith El Nino out in the Pacific in which rainfall in Pennsylvania, New Yorkand so forth along the East Coast is not going to reach any of its normallevels and we're going into the warmest part of the year?Ye a h .And into the late spring and summer with no ability to refill?Yeah, in that case, first of all, I would say that you have to remember that evenwhen there is a drought, there is still rainfall. So that you are looking atprecipitation that is maybe 60-70% of normal, but you are getting some rain fall.That will help some. But if you don't have replenishing rains that really begin tofill the reservoirs and also help out the agriculture in the areas and start refilling"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"some of the ground water tables, then you're going to continue to deplete theresource and the economic and environmental impacts of that are going to bejust devastating.Could we be moving into a new era in which the global warming climatecycle could be creating bigger droughts, bigger water areas, these biggerswings that the computers have said would happen, and that if Manhattanand some of the cities along the East Coast are facing the conditions inwhich reservoirs and ground water are basically empty, would the federalgovernment then act in declaring a national emergency? And if so, howwould that work?I don't know. Certainly, in terms of drought they have never declared a nationalemergency. In fact, the President - my understanding is that the President of theU. S. has never declared a drought emergency. Usually it stops with theSecretary of Agriculture. But if you got into a situation where it became anational emergency, it would have to be something that would revert to thePresident. I certainly don't envision a situation where this dry situation is goingto continue for multiple years where you're going to have a very severe depletionof ground water and no recharge of reservoirs that would take a while torecover. So, I don't know if this, I wouldn't say this is any part of a long termtrend.But what if it were?If it were, then you are painting a worse case scenario. And with globalwarming, we don't really know how the climate is likely to be changed at thelocal or regional scale. We talk about global warming in terms of increasingglobal mean temperatures. But how this is all going to wash out for local areasin terms of how it's going to affect their temperatures because the temperaturesaren't going to rise the same amount for every location. Some areas could evencool in global warming. some areas, particularly the Arctic and polar areas areexpected to warm up more than any other area. The equatorial areas will warmup less. What I'm more concerned about is the impact of sort of the combinationof global warming and increasing temperatures along with changes inprecipitation. Because even if precipitation increases for an area, the increase intemperature can compensate in the sense that evaporation is increased.Bear Creek, Allegany County, Maryland, August 5, 1999 drought.Photograph courtesy U. S. Geological Service.So, you get into a drought-wet-drought cycle?Right.Could we be facing the same kind of situation that set up the 'Dust Bowl' ofthe 1930s?Well, potentially there is no reason why we can't have consecutive and manyconsecutive years of drought. From a climatological perspective, the 6 or 8consecutive years of drought that effected large portions of the country during"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the 1930s, there is no reason why that couldn't re-occur, either in the centralpart of the U. S. or in some other part of the country. the southwest andsouthern great plain states had 6 to 8 years of consecutive drought during thelate 1940s to the mid-1950s. California went through 6 consecutive years ofdrought from the late 1980s to the early 1990s.Is the Bush Administration now talking with you and others about theseriousness of the drought situation?It is my understanding that right after the Easter break, there is going to be a billintroduced by Senator Pete Dominici (NM) in the Senate. It is called theNational Drought Preparedness Act of 2002. And this legislation has beendrafted for about the last 6 or 8 months by organizations like the WesternGovernors Assoc. and Southern Governors Assoc. and we've had input on thatas well. My understanding is that the administration is in support of thatlegislation.\" More Information:From Delaware River Master's Office:As of March 25, 2002, with no snow pack, very low river levels and diminishingground water tables, the current status of water in the three reservoirs of theDelaware River Watershed that provide half the drinking water for New YorkCity and water for New Jersey and Pennsylvania:a) The Cannonsville Reservoir which is the one on the West Branch, is at 38.5%capacity. It can hold 1,150 feet of water or 95.706 billion gallons. It had only3% of that amount in December.b) The Pepacton Reservoir is at 47.8%. It can hold 1,280 feet or 140.190 billiongallons.c) The Neversink is at 40.1%, the smallest of the three. It can hold 1,440 feet or34.941 billion gallons.
