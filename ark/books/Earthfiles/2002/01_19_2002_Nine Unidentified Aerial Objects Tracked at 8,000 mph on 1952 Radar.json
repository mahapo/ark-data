That career grew out of his 1951 enlistment in the U. S. Air Forceat seventeen with his parents' approval. After basic training, Airman Yergin spentnine months learning electronic fundamentals and advanced radar sets. His firstassignment was to work on the construction of a Long Range Early WarningRadar installation at Perrin AFB sixty miles north of Dallas, Texas, one ofAmerica's Air Training Command (ATC) bases.Mr. Yergin said, \"Not far from the main base was Perrin Radar Annex locatedeast of FM 1417. This facility was part of a large system of radar stationsguarding our skies against attack during the Cold War. This facility was alsoknown as a Ground Controlled Intercept (GCI) site. We had one building wherewe had a radar set on a 45-foot tower adjacent to the building where there wereeight Planned Position Indicator scopes (PPI). They were manned by an officer,radar operator and radar mechanics who made scope adjustments, calibrationsand maintained performance.\"One day in 1952, the radar picked up a large unidentified blip that changed intonine objects that \"performed aerial maneuvers far beyond our known technologysuch as remaining stationary, making right angle turn and accelerating to 8,000mph from a dead mid-air stop.\" After a dramatic hour in the radar hut, A/2CYergin and his radar colleagues were taken into custody at gunpoint by civilianpersonnel in black suits and armed Air Police. Airman Yergin was interrogated,intimidated, pressured to forget what he had seen and heard and ordered to signa non-disclosure agreement binding for ten years. Violation of the agreementcarried the penalty of ten years in a federal penitentiary and a $10,000 fine."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Mr. Yergin contacted me because the incident has haunted him and he stillresents the government intimidation and suppression of information about atechnology that, in his opinion, could not have been terrestrial in 1952. Mr.Yergin thinks the truth should be told and hopes that others who were in thatradar hut at Perrin AFB in 1952 might come forward now to confirm theextraordinary radar evidence that has been suppressed to this day.Interview:Chandler Yergin, Former U. S. Airman 2/C Air Force Radar Mechanic,Perrin AFB, 60 miles north of Denison, Texas: \"One day I had just finishedgoing through the early morning calibration procedures for the radar set andscopes. All were within specifications and were working perfectly. Then anofficer called me over and said, 'Airman, look at this huge blip! What is it?'Chandler Yergin's drawing to show the size of the large stationary blip north of New Yorkthatfirst appeared on the Perrin AFB, Texas radar screen and how it compared to a normalaircraft size on radar. Drawing © 2002 by Chandler Yergin.I guess we had an overlay where the outline of the states would show up. So, wewould get an idea of what we were looking at and what state it was in andwhere. And this was indeed a huge blip, just about northwest of the state of NewYork. It was just sitting there. And all of a sudden, right before our eyes itseemed to kind of dissolve into nine smaller blips. And it shifted a little bit andthey went into a V formation.Mr. Yergin shows here \"the large blip changed to show 9 craft in a formation pattern,but still stationary. It was my understanding that radar confirmation was also madeby stations in Denver and Salt Lake City.\" Drawing © 2002 by Chandler Yergin."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"What was odd about it was that there were only nine. If it had been ten, it wouldhave been a nice V- formation. But there was nine. So there was one at thefront, then two and then three and then another two and one at the back. That Vformation started slowly moving in the direction of our base north of Dallas.And then word came in that apparently another base in the northeast had radarcontact and tried to interrogate it with IFF, Identification Friend or Foe. Everycommercial plane has a transponder in it whereby interrogating from the groundit will respond to identification: the type of aircraft, the serial number and soforth. And it did not respond.Now, this was 1952 and bases were on alert. And when something in the airdidn't respond to Identification Friend or Foe, we started getting a little worriedbecause here was a formation! We didn't know whether it was the Russians orwhat it was. But it kept cruising along.Could I ask something? When it was first identified as one large radarblip, did you have any estimate in measuring how big it was based on whatyou were getting on the radar?We knew it was huge. We did a measurement. I don't know that anymeasurements were taken, but compared to the size of a normal aircraft, this wasabout five or six times bigger than a normal aircraft would show up as. So, it waspretty huge. And apparently they had been flying so close together that at firstwe just got the one big, round reflection (strong signal) back. Then it shifted,and the things separated a little bit, and then they showed up as nine smallerblips.How fast was the formation moving?Well, we estimated it was just cruising along at may 300 to 400 miles per hour,just cruising. And anyway, it didn't respond to the interrogation from theground. So, we could hear the radio man, or the officer in charge, say, 'CallDenver. Call Salt Lake. See if we can get a radar fix, if they also have a radar fixon them.' Well, indeed, they phoned back and said, 'Yes,' they did. So we nowhad a radar fix from Denver, Salt Lake City and Perrin Field (in Denison, Texas).So at least three radars were now tracking in the mid-west and possibly others inthe northeast.Now, being an ATC base, it was home to the F-86D Sabre Jet. Response time toget airborne in an alert was about ten minutes. Anyway, they scrambled the jetsand it was a search and destroy type of mission because those things weren'tresponding.Now, since we could only determine range and azimuth, we did not have aheight finder, the F86's were staggered at 500 foot intervals to try to get a visualsighting and radar lock on them. These things are still just cruising in and thejets were taking off. Now, we could see on the radar that the planes were takingoff and they are on an intercept course and the V formation kept getting closerand I tell you, some of the officers were getting a little worried because it lookedlike they were coming right into the antenna, right for the base. At this point intime, they had just crossed the Arkansas border and as I say, it was getting alittle panicky around there. Everyone was hoping these jets would interceptbefore they got much closer."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Mr. Yergin wrote here, \"At slow speed, perhaps 350 mph, the UFO formation on directpath forDallas, Texas and/or Perrin AF Base. We could determine range and azimuth but notaltitude.Jets were flying at intervals of 500 feet to try and obtain visual and radar contact.\"Drawing © 2002 by Chandler Yergin.Now, we watched as the planes got about 400 miles from the intercept, thesethings stopped dead, Linda. They stopped dead. We don't know how high theywere, but they just stopped dead. And we watched as the planes got within 150miles from them and they took off at a right angle and we tracked those suckersall the way up through Canada. They took off at about a 90 degree angle from adead stop on their original flight path to a very fast acceleratio. After we plottedthem about a thousand miles into northwest Canada, one of the guys called backand said, 'These things are going 8,000 miles an hour!'Mr. Yergin writes that the radar objects \"at approximately 500 miles from our base, theUFOsstopped and remained stationary! As our fighter aircraft approached to about 150 miles ofthem,the UFO formation sped off at a 90 degree angle from their original flight path. It was nota gradual acceleration but from dead stop - then max speed we calculated to be 8000 mph.\"Drawing © 2002 by Chandler Yergin.The jets that were trying to get to an intercept, they never got any visualeye contact?I don't know. I don't know if they did or not. I don't know what they reportedthrough their own Chain of Command. I suspect they were close enough to get aradar fix. We were not privy to that information and nothing came back on radioto the hut anyway.Now, the interesting point, Linda, too is that after that, it wasn't more than threeor four minutes after they had gone off screen that the doors to the radar hutopened and a bunch of guys came in. Some were dressed in civilian black suitsand were obviously the ones in charge. They were accompanied by a bunch ofAPs (Air Police). The APs had sidearms and carbines. And they separated all of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"us very quickly. One of the guys in the suits came up to me and said, 'Airman,come with me!'I was startled and said, 'What?' and he pulled his side arm and aimed it at mystomach and said, 'I said, Come with me now!' And they marched us all out.There were at least three of them to each one of us. I followed the black suitwith an AP on each side of me. I was taken to a remote corner of the base to abig hangar that I had never seen before. I didn't know it was there. And theystuck me in a room and they gave me a pad and paper and they said, 'Now youwrite down everything that you saw and heard for the past hour. Who said it?What was said? Draw a diagram of the scope, what you saw. And what yourconclusions were.' And they left me alone for about an hour while I tried tofigure out all that stuff and put it in some kind of chronological order and drawthe diagrams.Then another interrogator came in and went through step by step of what I sawand heard. And they said, 'You didn't see that. You didn't see anything.'I said, 'Well, pardon me, sir, but I did!'And, 'No, you didn't.'And I said, 'Well, I made my statement and I drew the diagrams and I put downon paper exactly what happened.'And then of course, they started in and said, 'That's impossible! There is no wayyou can violate Kepler's Laws of Motion. It's against the physics.' And weargued. They didn't physically browbeat me, but they certainly threatened me.You know I had seen guys get discharged for psychological problems and mentaldischarges.They said, 'Do you expect to have a career in the service?'I said, 'Well, I certainly may not make a career out of it.'They said, 'Well, you know if you're talking crazy stories, you're not going to getpromoted. And if you get discharged, how is that going to look? If you get apsychological discharge, what kind of job are you going to get?' And so forth.On and on and on. This went on for four hours!And I finally understood and said the only way I'm going to get out of here is toplay their game. So, I said, \"All right, I understand. I'm a radar mechanic. I havea suggestion, sir.'There were three or four of them in the room, you know, taking turns at me.They said, 'What?'I said, 'I'm a radar mechanic and I think I should go back and run anotherdiagnostic on the scope.' I said, 'I'm sure I can find a malfunction.'They said, 'That's fine.' They threw a piece of paper in front of me and they said,'Read it and sign it.' And I read the paper and it said I would be subjected to tenyears in a federal penitentiary and quite a hefty fine if I spoke about this orunder penalty of violation of the official secrecy act (National Security Act of1947), if I told anybody or talked to anybody about what I had seen or heardduring that one hour.And when I got back to the radar hut, the others came in one by one and all wecould do was look at each other. No one dared mention a word about it. All wecould do was go back to our routine business.All of the other men had been subjected to the identical kind of debriefing..."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"They took us all out at gunpoint and separated us and interrogated us. I have toassume the grilling was about the same for all of us....and intimidation of each man.Absolutely.Did you talk with any one of them very confidentially?Not a word! We were afraid. We were subjected to constant surveillance. Theyput the fear of God into us. No, we did not talk to each other confidentially orany other way. We did not. At least, I didn't. And I did not. I kept my agreementfor over ten years. I didn't talk about this with anybody!But the guys in the black suits, I made the assumption, I thought they must havebeen NSA (National Security Agency). I thought it must have gone pretty highup because for civilians to come inn on the base to do that, they had some littlebit of clout!The paper that you signed, did it have a year expiration on it? Or was it forlife?No, to the best of my recollection it said a $10,000 fine and ten years in thefederal penitentiary if I discussed or wrote about it for a period of ten years.So ten years was the expiration. And in this year of 2002, you would not beviolating that particular signed document.As I recall, it should have expired by 1962. But after what I had been throughand so forth, I still didn't discuss it with people for a long time after that.Did you ever sign any other non-disclosure agreement after 1952concerning anything you had seen?No, ma'am.\"More Information:See the book Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume II: High Strangeness in theEarthfiles Shop for more military and intelligence accounts of U.
