South American fishermen used thename years ago to designate periodic cycles ofunusually warm water in the Pacific oceanwhich appear around Christmas time. El Ninoconditions occur once water temperatures havewarmed enough (.5 degrees Celsius or moreabove normal) to alter normal cloudiness andrainfall in the Pacific basin. The cycle is everyfour or five years and can last up to eighteenmonths. The last El Nino was 1997-1998.Pacific Ocean temperatures near the South American coast in February 2002 had warmed2 degrees Celsius (4 Fahrenheit) indicating that El Nino conditions are developing.Map courtesy National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.March 9, 2002 Washington, D. C. - Scientists at the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration (NOAA) announced on March 7 that ocean surfacetemperatures near the South American coast had already warmed 2 degreesCelsius (4 Fahrenheit) by February 2002.\"This warming is an additional sign the Pacific Ocean is heading toward an ElNino condition,\" said NOAA Administrator and Under Secretary of Commercefor Oceans and Atmosphere, Conrad C. Lautenbacher, USN (Ret.). \"It's still tooearly to determine the potential strength of this El Nino or exactly what weatherconditions it will bring to the United States, but it is likely these warmingconditions in the tropical Pacific will continue until early 2003.\"Already consequences of the warmer Pacific waters near South America haveincluded increased rainfall, including extreme floods in Bolivia, and fishermenreport that cold-water anchovies have been replaced by tropical species.Possible El Nino Impacts On United States in 2002-2003:Less rain in the SouthwestDrier fall and winter in Pacific NorthwestWarmer fall and winter in northern Great Plains and upper MidwestWetter winter from Louisiana to FloridaMore winter storms along East Coast"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Fewer Atlantic hurricanesLess rain in the west and warmer Great Plains and Midwest mean that alreadyserious drought conditions in the United States could get worse in some areas.
