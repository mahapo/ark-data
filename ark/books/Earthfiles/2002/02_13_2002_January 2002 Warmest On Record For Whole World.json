Satellite photograph courtesy NASA.February 13, 2002 Boulder, Colorado - Over the past three weeks, there havebeen several sobering headlines about the impact of global warming:February 3, 2002: \"Scientists report that Antarctica is becoming toohot for the penguins.\"February 6: National Medal of Science and Pulitzer Prize-winningnaturalist Edward O. Wilson warns that 20% of the species alive onearth today could be gone by 2030.February 13: Hundreds of millions of monarch butterflies died in afreak snowstorm in Mexico mountains where they have normallywintered in safety.That same day, the Royal Observatory in Belgium reported itscalculations that the build-up of greenhouse gases around our planetwill slow down the earth's rotation by a microsecond which couldincrease wind speeds between 10 and 60 degrees latitude in bothhemispheres.Also, on February 13th, Pennsylvania's Governor declared a droughtemergency for twenty-four counties, including the Philadelphiaregion. That means water restrictions already and officials areworrying about the upcoming summer if drought persists."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"February 14: The Daily University Science News reported: \"GlobalWarming Said Devastating Aquatic Ecosystems.\"February 17: At a Boston meeting of the American Association forthe Advancement of Science, atmospheric physicists reported thatmelting glaciers could cause sea levels to rise more than twice whatwas previously predicted, at least one to two feet over this century.February 20: a massive hail and rain storm in La Paz, Bolivia killed27 people.That same day, atmospheric physicists at the AAAS meeting inBoston asserted that global warming will continue for at least thenext hundred years even if fossil fuel consumption is dramaticallyreduced.February 22: The Philadelphia Inquirer headlined: \"This winter isn'tjust warm - it's the warmest.\" The November 2001 through January2002 is the hottest winter on record in the United States - 4.3 degreesF above the average temperatures. Further, January 2002 was thewarmest on record globally, 1.24 degrees F. above normal.November 2001-January 2002 warmest winter period ever recorded in United States since1895.The second warmest November-January occurred in 1999-2000. The third warmest was thedroughtdecade of 1933-1934. The map above indicates that every state on the U. S. mainland hadabovenormal temperatures.

There was no ElNino in 2001. This week I talked about the modern unprecedented temperatureswith Dr. Kevin Trenberth, Head of the Climate Analysis Section at the NationalCenter for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Interview:Kevin Trenberth, Ph.D., Meteorologist and Head, Climate AnalysisSection, National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Boulder,Colorado: \"Kevin Trenberth, Ph.D., Meteorologist and Head, ClimateAnalysis Section, National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR),Boulder, Colorado: \"Last year (2001) we didn't have an El Nino, so it didn'tcontribute to the record warmth that occurred. Of course, the end of last yearwas the beginning of this current winter and we've had a pattern where acrossNorth America, especially east of the Rockies, it's been exceptionally warm.There has been an absence of snow.Another area in which warm winters doesn't help is certain kinds of pests andinsects. Some insects and fungus diseases are killed off by really coldconditions. One of the examples is the West Vile Virus which came into NewYork City. Normally it wouldn't be able to survive there, but somehow it hasbeen able to winter over and the cold conditions that normally would kill thatkind of thing off, instead the virus has been able to winter over and survive. Wehave to see if it wintered over and survived this year as well. But that's the sortof thing that's a downside to warmer winters.Then if we get to summer and it's warmer in summertime, then that can cause awhole raft of problems because of increased heat stress, heat stroke, evenpotential for greater drought conditions and very much discomfort to humansand animals alike.Already in the state of Pennsylvania, there are 24 counties that are undersevere drought monitoring and have water restrictions.The prospects with global warming are that these droughts will get bigger andmore intense, last longer, because there is more evaporation that goes into theatmosphere and this doesn't have good implications for agriculture or for fires.There are a lot more fires under these conditions and water restrictions comeinto play.Some of the climate computers have even shown that in the United States,the so-called 'Bread Basket' could suffer so much drought that the foodraising areas might have to go north into Canada. Nations might have tostart growing food for other nations as opposed to any particular nationbeing indpendent with food on its own.You're correct. One of the potential risks for global warming is that there is a riskof greater summertime drought in the United States. It doesn't necessarily followthat you can move the growing of a crop further north because the growingseason doesn't change. The length, the amount of time that it is light when thesun is shining doesn't change as the climate changes. Also, the soils are notnecessarily suitable. We know there are some grain crops grown in Canada, sothere is some flexibility there. But this is the kind of effects that we ultimatelyhave to worry about. It's all very well to say that you can move the crops furthernorth, but you can't move the farmers further north. So, a number of peoples'livelihoods are at stake in these kinds of changes.We can survive one year of drought. The key question is: what happens if it's twoyears or three years or four years. Suddenly farmers start going out of business.Then even if you do have a good year, suddenly the farmers are not there to takeadvantage of it. So, the climate factor begins to compound these kinds of thingsand can be very disruptive in that regard.From the position you have at NCAR as you look out the next ten or fifteenyears, are you expecting that this warming temperature trend willcontinue?We're certainly expecting that the warming will continue. We see no reason why"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"that should stop. We believe that a major component of it is the build up ofgreenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This relates especially to the burning offossil fuels and relates to the emissions we are putting into the atmosphere.There is no evidence that that is abating.A photograph of the world at night compiled from satellite images shows lighted citiesdependent uponelectricity and power stations which emit greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,warming the earth. Image courtesy of NASA.We would actually have to cut the amount of emissions quite a lot in order toslow this process down because when you put carbon dioxide into theatmosphere. It stays around for about 100 years. In other words, as you addmore it builds up and simply stopping adding more doesn't make it go away. Itstays there. And so as long as we keep burning fossil fuels the way we are. Thisis not just the United States. It's very much a global problem where internationalrelationships and treaties come into play and it would be nice if the UnitedStates could play a strong leadership role in this. President Bush has justannounced the Administration's position on this, but they have not been a partof the Kyoto Protocol which is the international agreement which was designedto try to come to grips with this problem.Why is our government not taking the build-up of carbon dioxide andother greenhouse gases seriously, realizing that the future of not just thiscountry, but the world, could be jeopardized by a warming that mightreach 10.5 degrees F. over the next 100 years?Well, that's a good question. The reason that is given, of course, is that it'srelated to the economy because if we were try to make inroads to reducingemissions, if we did it in the wrong way and too suddenly, then it could have anadverse effect on the economy. On the other hand, I don't think that kind ofstatement takes into account the adverse affects of the climate change on theeconomy and on the environment as well. That aspect seems to be somehow in adifferent pot, so that when we do have a weather disaster, a hurricane, orflooding or drought, it's not connected to where that is coming from which isrelated to all the emissions that are being put into the atmosphere.You are saying that we end up spending as much or more money on thecatastrophes and disasters that can be a directg consequence of warmingwhile saying on the other hand that we can't cut back emissions because itwould effect the economy. That seems penny wise and pound foolish.In the long term, I think that's correct. This is a long term problem.Right now, there is a news story out of Antarctica that penguins are havinga hard time surviving because the temperatures are so warm in sections.Some people are confused because there have been headlines about theRoss Ice Shelf increasing in thickness without realizing Antarctica is a verycomplex situation. While the Ross Ice Shelf increases in thickness, otherplaces such as Larsen B are melting more rapidly than was anticipated.Penguins are under great stress because of the warming temperatures thatare melting ice. Could you comment on that and the emerging questionabout whether or not the 48 contiguous states could reach a point of winterwithout snow?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"What happens with global warming in Antarctica Antarctica is very high in theinterior and it's also very cold. So even if you warm it up by 5 or 10 degrees, itstill stays below freezing. But there is more moisture in the atmosphere, so weexpect that in Antarctica in the interior there will be more snow and actually inAntarctica there could be a build up of snow and ice. This is one of things thatthere is some evidence that it's occurring.At the same time the world is getting warmer.Yes, at the same time the world is getting warmer. On the other hand, we doexpect it will melt around the edges and that's the area where it affects thepenguins, especially in the peninsula south of South America. There has beensubstantial warming which does disrupt the penguins' way of life.And a much bigger impact is in the Northern Hemisphere where the polar bearsare pretty much dependent upon having ice cover and other mammals like Arcticfoxes and things like that in order to go from one island to another in thenorthern Canadian region. If the ice cover breaks up earlier and melts, it has areal adverse affect on their whole environment.In the United States, we certainly would still expect to see snows in themountains, but the season gets shorter. It gets cold enough in the interior of theUnited States that I don't imagine that snow will completely go away, but therewill be some areas such as New England that may well be much more difficult,or snow will become a much more rare event as we go into the future.And global warming doesn't stop at the year 2100. It continues into the 22ndcentury and even beyond that. Even if we do stabilize the concentrations of CO2in the atmosphere, the temperatures continue to increase for one to twocenturies after that and sea levels continue to rise for many centuries after that.So, there are some very long time scales involved in the climate system becauseof the way the heat gradually penetrates into the oceans and the oceans expand.The melting of glaciers, the melting of Greenland is a very slow process. ButGreenland is one of the things that we would expect ultimately to melt, but itwould take several thousand years for that to happen.Along with the very high temperatures, there would be major changes in thewhole nature of storms. We expect the storms would be more severe. Therainfall would be more intense when it does occur. In some ways, it's more likeevents we have in summer where we have a lot more convective events,tornadoes and hurricanes and things like that. Maybe more of those which arenot beneficial in general for agriculture. Agriculture does much better withgentle, more persistent rains rather than intense rains which are gully washersand usually cause local flooding.Could that explain the recent severe hail and flooding that occurred inBolivia?It could. There is a general tendency around the world, not just in the UnitedStates, for rainfall to change character in this way. There is a tendency formoderate rains to be decreasing and for heavy rains, more intense rains, to beincreasing and this is one of the things we expect to see with global warming.Workers in La Paz, Bolivia shoveling hail on February 20, 2002"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"after one of the most massive ice and rain storms on record there. Storm killed 27 people.So, there will be drought and then floods and the floods can do moredamage on drought soil, plus up and down temperatures.Right. It's kind of ironic that you have drought and floods both increasing in risk,but it relates to the fact that a lot of the heat goes into drying which promotesdrought where there isn't any rain. On the other hand, that extra moisture that isbeing pumped into the atmosphere gets brought together in our weather systemsand it all gets dumped out in locations that produces local flooding. So, the riskof both floods and droughts increases.In February, NOAA Announces El Nino Alert for 2002\"If we have an El Nino in 2002, will that increase the amount of rainfall inthe United States or decrease it in areas that are already suffering so muchdrought?Dr. Trenberth: \"What can happen is it often pulls the storm track further to thesouth, so it can mean m more rainfall in the United States. One example is 1993which was sort of a moderate El Nino, but that's when we had the huge floods inIowa and the upper Mississippi basin. All along the Mississippi, that was an ElNino year.On the other hand, in 1988 which I mentioned to you before was the last timewe had a really large drought. That was a big La Nina year. That was a reallystrong reversal of El Nino in the Pacific. So there is evidence like that whichsuggests it favors parts of the United States to be wetter. On the other hand, evenas we had all those floods in the upper Mississippi basin, there were droughts inthe Carolinas. So, what happens is that you have a very strong weather patternand in El Nino it tends to get locked into place. Exactly where it gets lockedinto place and which parts are wet and which parts are dry, those can movearound. They depend upon the particular flavor of El Nino that you get. But theodds are that some parts of the United States will be wetter.When will we know if El Nino is taking hold in 2002?What we need to do is watch very carefully about what is going to happen in thenext couple of months. The Climate Prediction Center in NOAA and theNational Weather Service is the organization that puts out the official forecastand they have already issued an alert that El Nino is rearing its head. Theforecasts at this stage of the event are not that good as to whether it will be areally big event or whether it will be a modest event or small event and exactlywhat its effects will be. We need to watch very carefully and probably a coupleof months from now, we'll be able to have more confidence in the forecasts aswe go later into the year.We b s it e s :http://www.noaa.govhttp://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2002Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expressly"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"prohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
