Many formations haveappeared in thesame geographic places since 1990, sometimes in the exact position of previous years. June 4, 2002 Avebury Trusloe, Wiltshire, England - For days prior toSaturday, June 1, rain had been falling hard on the crops in the famous farmcounty of Wiltshire, England. Then between the night of June 1 and 6 a.m. June2, something touched young, green, 4-foot-high barley growing in a field nearthe famous and ancient ring of large sarsen granite stones in Avebury. The farmowner, a Mr. Butler, said he knew the barley was normal the day of June 1, sohe was surprised and amazed to find a 180-foot-diameter formation of mostintricate design at 6 a.m. on Sunday morning. According to Mr. Butler and acouple of other people who came along, the pattern was in pristine condition.No one could find tracks or other evidence of entry in the wet, rain-soaked mud. On June 2nd, Charles Mallett - new owner with his wife, Frances, of the SilentCircle Cafe in Cherhill not far from Avebury - heard about the new formationand went to see it. Charles has been in dozens of crop patterns and later talkedwith me by phone about his impressions.

Aerial video© 2002 by Stuart Dike, www.cropcircleconnector.com.\"When I walk around in a barley field that has been rained on for a week, I makesuch a mess, you wouldn't believe it. And I'm trying to be careful. The weatherfor the previous week to ten days has been absolutely terrible. Raining like hellfor a week or so. That Saturday night was dry and fine weather, but the fieldswere very wet and muddy. After I entered the formation on the Sundayafternoon, my boots were very muddy.So I want to emphasize, it was extremely clean. I could perceive where visitorsto the formation had walked, but all the other areas were absolutely clean andpristine. You know when people first walk into a crop formation, they will walkaround the perimeter and make a bit of a path. And then everyone else whocomes, goes around the same path. That's the easiest place to walk and thatpretty much happens in all the formations. The other clean areas weren'tdamaged at all. In what I consider to be a genuine formation, the crop is putdown quite gently and it can't take 160-pound man on it without breaking.It's an expansive formation about 180 feet in diameter. My first impression was aMayan or South American iconology. But after viewing the aerial imagestonight, it's kind of a Celtic knot design of some kind. But very interestinginterior shapes. To describe it from the inside out, I would say there is a standingring at the very center of the formation with a flattened circle inside the ring.Avebury Trusloe near Beckhampton, about 180 feet in diameter.Aerial video © 2002 by Stuart Dike, http://www.cropcircleconnector.com.Then radiating out in six directions so this is a six-fold geometric design, six kindof arrowhead-shaped standing sections or bulging triangles radiating out allaround, all enclosed in a flattened circle. Surrounding this whole apparatus is aflattened ring about 1 foot wide, maybe 18 inches, and coming off this ring out"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"towards facing away from the formation are 39 little loops flattened circles donevery delicately and smooth, as if a continuous action had gone around the wholeformation around this whole outer ring to produce the loops.It's laid down so neatly as if it went down in the interior sections between the sixstanding kind of arrowheads, its gone down in huge waves as if it all happenedpretty quickly.It has that liquid flow?Sure. The barley is extremely delicate compared to late season wheat. It's verysilky and light. It kind of blows around in the wind like an ocean.You wouldknow, Linda, because you have obviously been in a lot of formations. Some ofthem you can kind of tell by looking that the whole thing has been created by asingle hand because the style over the entire formation is exactly the same,opposed to others that are suspicious where it seemed like six different stylesbecause there were six different people.On the contrary, this formation is one of those that looks extremely sharp on theground as if a single agency has been involved in the creation. No board marks.Did you look for any lengthened nodes or expulsions in the nodes or any ofthose biophysical changes we have seen in other formations?We didn't see blown nodes, but we did see a lot of elongation of nodes. Wherethe lay had changed directions to swerve around and sweep around standingcrop, the nodes bent around corners to meet with the flow which was ratherinteresting. So, there was plenty of pretty obvious changes at that level.The whole thing is extremely neatly laid out. I went back there on June 3 andbecause this is fairly young barley, over the course of one day, most of the crophas gone upright again. You wouldn't expect that from the aerial images becauseit looks so pristine and perfect. Geometrically, it's certainly fine and finishedextremely well. It's really the best that has happened in southern England interms of esthetics and geometry so far in 2002.\" Halewick Lane, Sompting near Worthing, Sussex, England Discovered Monday,June 3, 2002You might want to know about another formation which I believe happened onthe same night as Avebury Trusloe. This one is in Sussex, near a town calledHove in the Sompting area quite aways east of Wiltshire. There have been cropformations in the past.Maxine Ross and Paul Parsons report that they \"woke to find a crop circle in the fieldat the bottom of our road. This is just north of the A27 at the bottom of Halewick Lane, Sompting ,West Sussex. My Father, Bob Parsons,took the photo attached.\" Photo © 2002 by Bob Parsons. Only one shallow angle image so far, but it looks very large, at least 250 feet"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"based on the number of tramlines it crosses. (Tramlines are the lines made bytractors through crops and distances between the lines can vary from 30 to 80feet.) It's in barley and looks very clean cut and sharp.Halewick Lane, Sompting near Worthing, West Sussex, first reported June 3, 2002.Above two aerial photographs © 2002 by David Russell, Southern Circular Research. Silbury Hill, Wiltshire, England Discovered Tuesday, June 4, 2002 (Young4-foot-tall barley)I first heard about this formation this morning at 11 a.m.. Some guy came in ourSilent Circle Cafe up the road from this formation. It happened to be hisbirthday and he had taken an early morning microlight (very small airplane)flight over the countryside. I believe it was a birthday gift and he spotted a newformation down at Silbury Hill. Seeing our cafe there, he came in and told us.The June 4, 2002 formation is pointing right at Silbury in the upper right corner of theimage.Aerial video frame © 2002 by Stuart Dike, www.cropcircleconnector.com."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"We headed out there as quickly as possible and located the formation almostdead opposite the ancient mound of Silbury Hill. In fact, it is in exactly the samelocation as a formation in 1999 that was a 4-fold design or stepped pyramid.This new one is in the exact same location and quite strangely at almost thesame elevation as the top of Silbury Hill which, I believe, is 130 feet.We made our way into the formation and it is quite spectacular to say the least.Easily the neatest English formation of this year. It is absolutely crisp.The satin sheen of the downed barley. The dark green pattern is the 4-foot-tallbarley left standing. Aerial video frame © 2002 by Stuart Dike,www.cropcircleconnector.com.Better than Avebury Trusloe?In some ways. It's almost as if a different agent is involved here, equally stylishand equally stunning. But it's kind of different in just the basic way it's gonedown. It's quite odd, as opposed to Avebury Trusloe which was kind of veryfreehand, loose, laid down very gently as if something had just brushed over theformation at Trusloe.This one at Silbury Hill was quite flat to the ground, and yet everything wasraised up about three inches so that when you step on it, you get a real crunchunder the foot as you put your body weight onto the plants. In Trusloe, theplants were coming up around my knees. So, obviously there had been a muchgentler put down at Trusloe. The lay in Trusloe seemed to be one of those whereit needed to be seen from the air because it was very hard to make sense of it onthe ground.It's in similar-aged barley to the previous day's formation. It's about 4-foot-highbarley, very damp, very green. It had rained the previous night which is quiteinteresting in itself because I personally wouldn't want to be on a hilltop on awindy, wet night in Wiltshire. But the formation arrived in those circumstances.We made out way into it and it's a little more than 200 feet in diameter. Theformation consists of a fairly large number of circles towards the center of theformation, very large interlocking circles making a kind of Vesica Pisces symbolsand radiating out in four directions. There are strings of circles kind ofdisappearing, lapping over the sides of the hill. The way the formation ispositioned, it kind of looks like a star shape draped on top of the hill.The actual design to me seems reminiscent of things that were happening back in1998. There was a formation named the Queen constructed in a very similarfashion. Also, a couple of others known as \"cat's eyes.\" They were quite similarin construction, but not quite as neat as this one maybe because it's in barley. Itdoes go down very smoothly. The entire floor of the formation really did look asif a single sweep had gone over the whole thing, like a rippling pond of crop.Very, very impressive to see on the ground. There were some very interestingcenter swirls, tufts left standing, and some very interesting weaving going on. It's"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"actually quite complex on the ground because there are lots of circlesinterlocking with each other, certain sections standing and certain sections downto create this effect from the air.It is strange that we often get splatterings of formations that suddenly jerk usback a few years, almost as if for some reason to remind us of what came before.But the formation did seem, in my opinion, extremely genuine in terms of itdidn't sem to be one of those made by people. My experience tells me that thisone was created by a single hand, probably very fast and you have to be there onthe ground to appreciate it. You would never see those details from the air. It'sthe whole rippling motion as if one fairly swift sweep went over the area and putthe crop down extremely precisely in a moment. That's my impression.Are any of the known hoaxers trying to claim anything on these firstformations?No, I have had no word on that. As you know, we've opened a crop circleinformation center and cafe at Cherhill just a few miles from this particularformation. We have had a few of these hoaxer individuals drop in to look at theplace and have some tea. For instance, yesterday the Avebury Trusloe formationwas present and we had individuals in there who we know have been involved inmaking fairly mediocre formations in the past and it was pretty apparent talkingto these people that they knew nothing about any new formations just fromsitting down and having conversations. Generally, my experinece tells me thatpeople who make crop circles are on some ego trip and are quite keen onhingting about new formations to guage our opinions. But there was no sign thatany individuals I have spoken to knew about any formations prior to theirarrival, which is quite intersting. It is always after the event that they say, 'Oh,yes, I made that one. I made this one.' But when it comes down to the proof andfacts which I have learned it is extremely flimsy.It's also significant that this year there were more oilseed rape formationsin Germany first. People were speculating about the quiet of the springseason in England. If you go back to 1990, that was the way that year was -very quiet until the first of June and then a whole series of remarkableformations occurred and many seemed to be \"a new language\" in thepattern history.Yes, it's extremely bizarre how the situation seems to work. In Wiltshire, we havemassive canvasses of perfect rape which is available in early May. And for somereason, it just doesn't happen some years. One year, maybe it will start the firstof April and we'll get stunning formations like a dozen formations through Apriland May. But this year, it just didn't happen - until now.\" More Information:You can e-mail Charles and Frances Mallett for more information about TheSilent Circle Cafe and crop circle information center at:thesilentcircle@hotmail.com.Telephone in Calne, Wiltshire, England: 07810-825-185"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Charles and Frances Mallett opened The Silent Circle Cafe on June 1, 2002.Hours are 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily on the A4 Beckhampton-Calne Road, below theCherhill White Horse and obelisk near Calne, Wiltshire not far from Silbury Hill andAvebury.
