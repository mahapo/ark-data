July 20, 2002 Pewsey, Wiltshire, England Charles Mallett and his wife,Frances, both long-time crop formation researchers and now co-owners of TheSilent Circle Cafe in Cherhill, Wiltshire, say the Pewsey White Horse nautilusformation is as mysteriously fine a formation as any they've ever seen. Further,on July 17, a Danish girl visited their cafe and told Charles she had watchedmysterious lights in the sky for about ten minutes the night before directly abovethe Pewsey White Horse. She wrote up her eyewitness account for Charles and"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"he told me what happened. Interview: Charles Mallett, Crop Circle Researcher and Co-Owner with FrancesMallett of The Silent Circle Cafe, Cherhill, Wiltshire, England: \"One of theDanish girls was renting a cottage near Mannings Ford, which is a few milesfrom Pewsey with clear views across the landscape and the White Horse. Thenight before this formation arrived down at Pewsey, at about midnight, one ofthe girls was standing outside for about ten minutes watching the sky. Suddenly,she saw a number of light anomalies, what she perceived as strange lightsmoving around erratically in the sky over the hills which are only a couple ofmiles away towards the White Horse. These lights just descended into the fieldand the entire event from her seeing the lights until descending into the field wasminutes, rather than seconds. It was long enough for her to be pretty certain thatsomething odd was going on in the sky.You're familiar with some high quality formations, Linda. This formation wouldhave been as good as anything you have ever seen, including Cherhill 1999 andDevil's Den. That kind of quality.Why is it so white?I think it is the time of day that (photographer) Dereka Dobson was flying. It'squite amazing, isn't it, like a graphic. Personally speaking, I would consider itentirely genuine and entirely anomalous event. The wheat plants were laid downclean and neatly. No signs of board marks, stomping, or anything like that. Wewere really fortunate to get in there because after the farmer heard about theevent, he threatened to shoot people even if they went into the field. He actuallykicked in and damaged quite badly the very center of the formation, which was agreat shame. Apart from that, it was in fine condition. I don't think anybody hadbeen in there when we got there in the afternoon on day one.As I said, it was absolutely pristine. I could not find any evidence whatsoever ofhuman activity, tampering, or anything like that at all. It seemed fluid andconsistent through the whole event.All ground photographs of the Pewsey White Horse nautilus formation reported onJuly 17, 2002 are © 2002 by Charles R. Mallett.

Eleven feet wide, that thing is. I could hardly get myfeet, or one foot, in the actual laid pathway that makes that spiral. The actuallines that go through the spiral to replicate the larger brother, they were just acouple of inches wide and extremely delicate. Interestingly enough, at the centerof that tiny little fractal spiral, it seemed as if the energy or whatever had createdthis event at such a localized level that it seemed to scorch the tops of theplants. This is fairly green wheat and a number of the stalks essentially had allthe moisture taken out of the stems as if they were dead. That is extremelystrange.I've personally seen that in two formations in the past: one at Cherhill in 1999,exactly the same effects on the plants. And also in 1999, at the LiddingtonCastle formation, we found similar effects on plants of a similar age, also in verylocalized areas in small signatures next to the main formations. That wasextremely strange back then and up to now, I've never heard any credibleexplanation for why that should be. Unless, of course, what is making cropcircles is some energy which we don't understand or fully appreciate.Depending upon the thickness of plants in patterns, the energy mightscorch plants once in awhile.Sure. By no means do we see these kinds of effects in every crop circle. Thatdoesn't happen. I don't think there is any one given formula that puts a cropformation down. I think the topography might matter. The weather conditionsmight matter.The formation pattern is an amazing expression of Nature. So simple, but at thesame time, so sophisticated. The mathematics involved in putting that spiraldown is quite challenging. I would suggest that anyone try to get a goldensection spiral on a piece of paper, let alone a crop field in the middle of thenight.It's also quite interesting the way the end of the spiral, the wide straight path,which signifies the end. It seems to act as an arrow and points directly at theWhite Horse of Pewsey."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\"Straight end\" of nautilus points at Pewsey White Horse on hill in background.Photograph © 2002 by Charles R. Mallett.The nautilus shape and that spiral are clearly the perfect expression of growthand development in Nature. The way it is, it's almost like Nature has had a littlebaby. The whole formation is kind of like that. It's technically verysophisticated, but at the same time, very subtle and very beautiful. It could sumup a lot about the whole crop circle phenomenon in terms of expressions ofNature and growth in Nature and development, including the soul andconsciousness. A lot of what the crop circles are about can be, or is beingexpressed, by that nautilus formation. And it is completely anomalous whichmakes it even more exciting."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"To me, it suggests that whatever intelligence is behind the crop formationsis signaling that we are on a spiraling cycle. The little nautilus wouldindicate that we, earth, are at a particular juncture on a cycle and might bein jeopardy. Whatever the intelligence is, maybe it is saying, 'We can seeyour timeline, past, present and future.'Everything we have discovered about the crop formations over the years havesuggested, as you just said, that we are pretty much at a critical juncture in thedevelopment of ourselves as a species and as individuals, of the souls, I guess. Ifanyone takes a look at the world around us, it's a mess. Something is needed andthe crop circles to me seem like a wake up call and it's very much needed. It isexpressing the way in which we are going, so it seems perfectly natural in asense. Maybe it's a helping hand and a lot of people are realizing that. In Contrast to Pewsey White Horse,Windmill Hill of July 18, 2002 Has Board Marks ThroughoutWhat about Windmill Hill?We were there on the first day in the late afternoon after a good many peoplehad already been in the formation. When we first walked into it, it is 250 feet orso in diameter, so it is pretty huge. It is extremely elaborate on the ground.Without seeing an aerial shot, we walked into that, out first reactions were,'Wow! Look at this. It's amazing.' There are hundreds of standing diamond-shaped pieces, chunks of wheat. We walked around the whole thing and it wasquickly apparent that it seemed to have a relationship to the 2000 magnetic fieldmoire pattern that was also near Windmill Hill. That formation and this eventresemble each other. This time there are six sort of interlocking magnetic fields.This 2002 Windmill Hill, after examining the formation for about 10 or 15minutes, we left up in the event with Andreas Mueller and Werner Anderhub ofSwitzerland. Werner had just flown over it and Andreas, being the mathematicsand geometric student that he is, quickly came up with a fairly simple method ofconstruction and pretty much what it was."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"We all started scrutinizing the formation more closely, the four of us: Frances,my wife, Andreas, Werner and myself. It didn't take us long to see on the groundclear, stomper board marks which were all over the entire laid crop area. Therewere some kind of cut lines like the edge of a board had been put onto the cropand human weight pressed down onto it so it leaves a crease across the crop.These lines were at regular intervals over the entire crop area and the intervalswere effectively one pace. So, for myself, Andreas, Werner and Frances, itseemed apparent that this thing had been created by an entirely mechanicalmechanism for reasons unknown. But the evidence was on the ground.When we looked at the design in Andreas's sketch, we started relating it tomaterial that has been done in the past for TV documentaries to prove that allcrop formations are a hoax and it was a similar style to some known hoaxers.There was nothing new. the method of construction was quite simple. It's a bigcircle and all the hoaxers needed were six points and then fill in a lot of lines.But it is an audacious undertaking and carried off quite well and will probablyconvince a lot of people because in the aerial photograph, they did do a goodjob. It's perhaps the most well-executed hoax so far.Could this have been paid for by the Disney Corporation backing theHollywood movie, Signs, because the producers indicated in prior publicitythey would have crop formations produced somewhere before the movie isreleased August 2?Perhaps. My impression was afteer speaking to one individual is that the farmeralready knew something fairly big was going to go down on his land around thedays leading up to July 18.Was it suggested that the farmer had been paid?The source did not elaborate, but the implication was the farmer knew about itbefore it happened. The fact that Colin Andrews was the first one up therephotographing it makes me suspicious.You mean because he's had a vested interest in his public statements in2000 that 80% of crop formations are hoaxes?Right.That statistic, however, was never backed up by any hard evidence.Yes, pulled out of thin air. So, this 2002 Windmill Hill formation is either aSigns movie splash, or it's a piece of misinformation which is designed todiscredit the real phenomenon and possibly discredit researchers who mightclaim it is genuine.It's not, but Pewsey (White Horse) is the real deal and very impressive.\"We b s it e s :http://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://home.clara.net/lucypringlehttp://www.dcca.nl/update%202002-nl.htmhttp://www.invisiblecircle.deCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"earthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
