March 9, 2002 New York City, New York - This week I talked to a scientistwho is confident that many dinosaurs had feathers, including the fierceTyrannosaurus rex \"monster\" meat-eater, - or at least when it was young. Dr.Mark Norell, Chairman of the Paleontology Division at the American Museumof Natural History in New York City, published photographs and informationabout a new fossil discovery from the Liaoning Province in northeast China inthe March 7th journal, Nature.The complete fossil slab found in Liaoning Province, northeastern China.The head is in upper left, looking backwards. The tail is stretching across to the right.A red box around one area just behind a back leg represents the enlarged view below.The hind limbs are heavily feathered.

The hypothesis is that thedinosaur was warm blooded, and the feathers were used to retain body heat, notto fly. This feathered dinosaur belonged to the Tyrannosaurus rex family.Dinosaurs first emerged on earth 235 million years ago. Feathered birds flying inthe air came much later, around 130 million years ago. So, feathers on dinosaurshas been a controversial hypothesis. I asked Dr. Norell about the significance ofthis most recent fossil discovery in China.Liaoning Province, northeastern China is the region where thefeathered dinosaur fossil was found. Interview:Mark A. Norell, Ph.D., Biologist and Chairman of the PaleontologyDivision, American Museum of Natural History, New York City, NewYo r k: \"This animal (fossil) really shows a feather which I think everyone canagree is a feather. I can show photographs of it to my 5-year-old daughter andshe says, 'Yeah, that's a feather.' Because it has a central shaft and has the barbs"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"that formed a vein that comes off the side of the shaft and everything else. So, ittruly is a feather.Now, why is this important? For a scientist, it's important for a couple ofreasons. One, it is really completely de-couples the idea that the origin offeathers and the origin of flight are the same. These animals didn't fly. Theyweren't birds. They are outside, they are more primitive than birds are. This hassort of been pretty well accepted the past couple of years by a lot of finds thatpeople have made, mostly in northeastern China. However, I think that this thingreally nails it. This is body covering that we thought at first were just primitivefeathers really, but are more than primitive feathers. They are in fact just like thefeathers that one sees in modern birds.Could you give radio listeners a kind of word picture about what thisparticular feathered dinosaur might have looked like?I think if you were to take yourself back to look at it, it would look pretty muchlike a bird with a long feathered tail. I mean, it was bi-pedal, meaning it walkedon two legs. It wasn't very large. It was only about three feet long. It had a fullyfeathered tail with long feathers that stick off the end of the tail. It had longfeathers off the hind legs, off the forelimbs and I'm sure that the body was prettyfluffy, too, even though even a lot of the body feathers aren't preserved on thisspecimen a fluffy body covering is present on a specimen that was announcedlast year at this time.If you were looking at current known birds, what would be the closest birdfeathers to what would match the fossil?They are not really flight feathers because the flight feathers of birds, thefeathers that form the airfoil, are asymmetric which allows, helps give them lift.In this animal, it's just basically a normal feather like if you plucked a featheroff, a generic feather off the tail of a chicken or something like that, it wouldlook pretty much like that.So short, not long?Well, no fairly long. Some are 4 or 5 inches long, but are rounded and notpointed on the end. Then they are just kind of a generic feather.The more we learn, it almost becomes humorous that dinosaurs wouldhave had something that looked like chicken feathers.Yeah, some of them did for sure. I think there is pretty good evidence thatperhaps even juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex would have had these things (fluffydown and/or feathers)."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Painting of two Tyrannosaurus rex dinosaurs while above aPteranod flies on bat-like membranes, not feathered wings,© by Mark Hallet in Dinosaur Illustrations.Is it possible that a full grown Tyrannosaurus rex, that fearsomemeat-eater, might have had feathers?Well, not as an adult probably. I think that at least a lot of people are suggestingnow that the origin of feathers mostly has to do with the origin of warm bloodedmetabolism. So, just like we wear down coats and that kind of thing, birds usefeathers as insulation because they are warm blooded. The thing about warmbloodedness is that once you get to a certain size, you come into what's calledthermal balance with the environment where you don't need to hold on to heatthat well anymore. And that's why animals like elephants by virtue of their greatsize, they don't need to have a big body covering. Their problem is getting rid ofheat as opposed to holding on to it. When Tyrannosaurus were born and quitesmall, they were hatched out of the egg, not born, they would very likely havehad a body covering. But then, as they grew larger, they would probably havelost it.So, we would have to re-think all of our models in museums and zoos andwhat kids get (in school and toy stores) - that maybe all dinosaurs, eventhough reptilian, might have started with a furry covering?Yeah, there are really some exciting animals that are coming out of northeasternChina and some things that are very distantly related to modern birds whichseem to have some sort - I wouldn't call them feathers - but they seem to havesome sort of covering which isn't the classic kind of scaly dinosaurs thateverybody has thought of for a long time.Would the scales on the dinosaurs, if they were scaly, had grown inevolution from feathers?No, not really. I think the scales on dinosaurs - a lot of us argue that dinosaursare still alive today. We just call them birds. Modern birds that are alive todaydo have scales. If you look at the foot of a chicken or a duck or pigeon or any ofthe birds that people commonly see, they have scales. The scales are differentthan the scales of a lizard, but all the evidence points to the scales of extinctdinosaurs are the same as the scales that one finds in chickens and ducks today.Is there a close evolutionary relationship between current day lizards andreptiles and dinosaurs?No, all dinosaurs are more closely related to modern birds than they are tolizards or crocodiles."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Dinosaurs went extinct 65 million years ago and emerged....235 million years, yeah.Would the dinosaurs have preceded birds? Who would have had thefeathers first?You can't really look at it that dinosaurs and birds are two different things. Justlike humans are a kind of primate, birds are a kind of dinosaur. Birds really aredinosaurs. Birds split off from what people would call the traditional dinosaursat least 130 million years ago.So, the dinosaurs would have been first with feathers before birds?Yeah, the earliest dinosaurs do occur before the earliest birds, but birds aredinosaurs also.And birds wouldn't have feathers perhaps if the dinosaurs hadn't hadfeathers first?You might be able to say that, but the reason that birds have feathers is becausethey were descended from non-avian dinosaurs that had feathers.Meaning that the dinosaurs that have been discovered weren't flying withthese feathers?Right. Right.Why do you think there is such a focus of these discoveries in China andnot elsewhere?It's largely serendipity. There are a few great places in the world to find fossils.Some of these places are different than others in the sense they haveenvironments that preserve soft tissue. That is a very rare thing to find as fossilsbecause you need to have very, very fine grained sediments. You have to have alack of oxygen so specimens don't disintegrate really quickly. All these thingshave to come together and they just happened to come together about `130million years ago in northeastern China to preserve these things.They might have been around the world, but not preserved?I'm sure they were all over the world. In fact, we find close relatives of theseanimals in North America, Mongolia, even in the south of France.Is it established pretty much that dinosaurs were warm blooded and notcold blooded as we thought decades ago?Obviously, some dinosaurs are warm blooded because birds are dinosaurs andbirds are alive today and are warm blooded. There is a lot of evidence that hasbeen accumulated over the past several years from a variety of different sources,all the way to looking at the microstructure of bones to looking at differentproportions of different types of isotopes of oxygen in bones which are all reallypointing in the same direction that in fact, some dinosaurs were warm bloodedjust like birds are.If the dinosaurs were warm blooded and still categorized as having areptilian link, why is it that reptiles would end up being cold blooded?The primitive condition of reptiles is to be cold blooded, but I think mostmodern classifications of reptiles include both dinosaurs and birds as kinds ofreptiles. Primitively, they were cold blooded, but as they evolved in the morederived forms, warm bloodedness originated.Why was there so much resistance in the beginning of these discoveriesabout feathers on dinosaurs?Uh, I have no idea! Actually, I don't know. People just get these notions and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"want to hold on to stuff. But as a scientist myself, if day after tomorrow,somebody comes up with a data set that shows these aren't feathers or we havemisinterpreted something, I would say, 'That's fine. Let's move on with a newidea. Everything I wrote was incorrect.'But a lot of scientists I wouldn't say a lot, but some don't feel that way and theyclaim to hold ideas almost as if it were a religion or something.But in your own mind, there is no question that what you've got in thisrecent China fossil are feathers?Right.\" We b s it e s :http://www.amnh.orgCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
