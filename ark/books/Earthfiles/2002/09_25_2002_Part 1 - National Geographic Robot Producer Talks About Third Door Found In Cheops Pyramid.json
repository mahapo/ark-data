September 25, 2002 Washington, D. C. - Zaia Hawass, head of Egypt'sSupreme antiquities Council in Cairo, held a press conference on September 23,2002. He announced that after the September 16 television program broadcastby Fox and National Geographic to explore the southern shaft of the \"Queen'sChamber\" in the Great Pyramid of Cheops, the robot was sent up the secondnorthern shaft off the same chamber. Back in 1993, German engineer RudolphGantenbrink had discovered a sharp 45 degree turn about 60 feet from thechamber, but did not go further. The National Geographic and iRobot teamdecided to see how far the new 2002 robot could go. To their surprise, at 80 feetfrom the Queen's Chamber, there were two more turns. Then at 65 meters, orabout 210 feet, there was yet another door with copper handles like the one inthe southern shaft. As of this date, no one knows what is behind either of thelittle limestone doors. This week I asked Chris Sondreal, Producer, Egypt Robotics Unit, NationalGeographic Television and Film in Washington, D. C., about their off-cameradecision to send the robot up the northern shaft around the 45 degree turn. Engineer Gregg Landry, from Boston's iRobot, on September 16, 2002 lifts a robotoutfittedwith lenses and drills to explore one of the narrow, mysterious 8-inch diametershafts inside the Cheops pyramid of Cairo, Egypt.

C. 20036: \"Interms of looking at the Great Pyramid itself, you realize that the northern shaftcould not continue straight for 210 odd feet. There is a structure called theGrand Gallery that it would be running straight through. In fact, the Germangroup (Rudolf Gantenbrink, 1993) discovered the first (45 degree) turn whichlead us all to realize that probably the northern shaft would have to make a jogand go around the chamber called the Grand Gallery.Two More Turns Discovered Beyond the Gantenbrink AngleSo, what was a surprise were the second two turns in which it appears that thenorthern shaft reorients perhaps all the way to true north. So, it's as if it wasdesigned to head to true north and made a turn and then turned back to truenorth,We really were concentrating on getting around these corners and makingsure we could do that safely and mapping them and getting data as we weregoing. All of a sudden with modifications we had recently done to the robot, wewere at 90 feet and around the corners. Although there were still the metal rodsthat were left previously by other archaeologists on the bottom of the shaft, wewere suddenly moving very quickly, relatively speaking 5 feet or so a minute.Extraordinarily, we got past the metal rods and kept rolling and rolling androlling and we reached 150 feet and the shaft just kept going. It was completelyclean and clear at that point. There were no tread marks or traces of any otherrobot or any other explorer having put anything that far in the shaft. And we gotto 160 feet, then 170 feet, and every shaft block is a little bit different looking.So, every time we came to a new block, it was something we hadn't seen beforeand we had to stop and look at it. Some are shiny and some look like maybethere was some water damage. And we kept going for 180 feet, 190 feet. Andthen at about 200 feet, we could see our lights bouncing off of something andwithin a couple of seconds, we could see those copper pins and we knew wehad found another blocking stone.DID IT LOOK EXACTLY LIKE THE SOUTHERN SHAFT?

From a distance, it looked like the exact same stone at theexact same distance from the Queen's Chamber. But as you got closer to it andwe drove up to it, we realized they are not identical. They have roughly thesame dimensions. The stone is roughly the same quality. But the copper pins areplaced in it in a different fashion. In this new blocking stone, the pins seemed tobe much better preserved. There is not they seem to be clearly pieces of metaland there is not nearly as much kind of green residue on them from corrosion orother natural weathering of metal."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"And in the case of the one on the left, it seems as if it has been bent back or putinto position and carved out by a chisel. It's actually kind of recessed a bit intothe stone. Also, it appears that both of the holes that things come out of areslightly higher in position, at least as it appeared to our cameras. They appearedto be maybe a centimeter higher than they are on the other blocking stone. So,it's like two guys maybe just idle speculation but like maybe two guys gottogether and described to one another what they wanted to make and they werecraftsmen and went off and made virtually the same thing, but never put themside by side to make them perfectly the same thing.WOULD THERE BE HANDLES ON THE OTHER SIDE?We don't really know what is happening on the other side of the stone becausethe one time we put a camera through, we didn't have mirrors on it or any meansof turning the camera back to look at the stone. But it is quite possible that onthe other side, these copper pins, these metallic pins, are connected together in ahandle, or maybe they are individually a separate handle. Maybe there are twohandles on the other side.We are tantalizing close to being able to go up and looking through the hole thatwe put in the southern door, going up with a camera with a mirror on it andbeing able to look back at ourselves back at the dark side of the blocking stoneand find out what is going on.ANY PLANS TO DO THAT ANY TIME SOON?We will have to coordinate with our colleagues at the antiquity authorities inEgypt and get their approval for a plan and work with some scientists in theUnited States to make certain we have the right instruments on the robot. But Ithink we are optimistic that some time in the next 12 months or so, we'll be ableto go back and solve many more mysteries.AND PERHAPS DRILL THROUGH DOOR 2?I don't actually know what the plan will be there because we are going to haveto do what we did with the first blocking stone that we discovered we are goingto have to use remote sensing technology to find out how solid the door is, tomake sure we don't damage it if we were to drill it. Also, try to use remotesensing technology to tell us how thick that second one is. So, it's a possibility.But I think until we find out that it is yet another thin slab of stone, we wouldn'twant to make any commitments about what we are going to do next.IS IT DIFFICULT TO GET THAT REMOTE SENSOR UP TO THE SECONDSTONE AND TRY TO FIND OUT HOW THICK IT IS?It is. The one sensing technology we have that won't be difficult, or should berelatively easy, is ground-penetrating radar. It will, it can peer, the particularmodel that we have, can peer through up to 18 inches of concrete. It will alsopeer through air spaces. We know we have a 2 to 3 inch block happening first.Then we have a 7 inch air space. Then we have another block starting. We knowthat ground-penetrating radar should be able to at least tell us, it will be able toread the face of that next block. If it's not too thick, it might be able to confirmfor us how thick that next block is. If we are going to use the thickness gauge orother sensors, then it is extremely difficult because we will have to figure outhow to put that sensor through a 3/4 inch diameter hole. At least in the currentconfiguration, that would multiplies the complexity of what we are trying to do.I HAVE BEEN PUZZLED THAT IF THE RADAR WAS USED ON THEOUTSIDE OF THAT FIRST DOOR THAT WAS DISCOVERED IN 1993, WHYWOULDN'T IT HAVE SHOWN VERY CLEARLY THAT THERE WAS ALSOTHE SECOND DOOR SEVEN INCHES BEYOND?We actually weren't able to launch the radar on the missions we had, these lasttwo missions we had. The only remote sensing technology that we were able toget all the way to the door this is because of the very physical obstacles of the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"step and also the weight tolerance of our robot was the thickness gauge. And athickness gauge can only read the piece of stone that it's touching. So, had webeen able to bring the ground-penetrating radar up there, we might very wellhave had a much better sense of what we were going to find but because of avariety of technical issues, we didn't use it this time around.RIGHT NOW WITH THAT HOLE GOING THROUGH THE FIRST BLOCKOF STONE, WOULD YOU BE ABLE NOW TO GET THE GROUND-PENETRATING RADAR RIGHT UP AGAINST THE FACE OF THE SECONDBLOCK?No. No, because the ground-penetrating radar antenna is about 5 inches by 5inches. So, we would just push it against the surface of the first stone and getour readings that way. We are fairly confident that will be allow us to be able toread the face of the next stone, if not the whole thickness of it.AND DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU MIGHT TRY THAT?Once again, I'm hoping to learn in the next 12 months what all the authoritiesand National Geographic and Dr. Hawass will agree to how we proceed next. Iwould assume that would be one of the first things we do when we return.IT'S SO AMAZING THAT 4500 YEARS LATER THAT THIS GREATPYRAMID IS STILL SO MUCH A MYSTERY AT SO MANY LEVELS.It is. It's extraordinary and it's a privilege to be part of a team that's trying tocrack a millennia's old puzzle.\" Continued in Part 2We b s it e s :http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/09/0923_020923_egypt.htmlhttp://www.cheops.orghttp://solos.users.netlink.co.uk/door.htmlhttp://www.magicalegypt.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
