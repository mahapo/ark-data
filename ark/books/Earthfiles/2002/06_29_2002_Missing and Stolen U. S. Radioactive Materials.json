Radioactive Materials© 2002 by Linda Moulton HoweJune 24, 2002 Event Notification Report by U. S. Nuclear RegulatoryCommission about Plutonium-242 and Americium-243 missing from a December2001 shipment, not opened until May 20, 2002 and not reported by the NRC untilJune 24, 2002. To date, no one knows what has happened to the radioactivematerial supposedly encased in a flame-sealed glass container inside the shippingbox and protective plastic container. The FBI is investigating. June 29, 2002 Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania - This week, the U. S.Nuclear Regulatory commission issued an Event Notification Report aboutradioactive Americium-243 and Plutonium-242 that are missing from a shipmentbetween AEA Technology of Burlington, Massachusetts and Knolls AtomicPower Laboratory in New York. According to NRC and Department of Energy records, in the United Statesevery year on average, about three hundred cases of missing radioactivematerials are reported. Half of those are eventually recovered. But what aboutthe other 150 cases of missing radioactive materials? Or the 9,000 missingnuclear items that the Department of Energy says it is trying to track? Radioactive materials such as cesium in medical equipment, cobalt used in thefood irradiation industry, americium used in oil industry research and spent rodsfrom nuclear power plants can all be used by terrorists to make dirty bombs. Alla terrorist has to do is have enough technical know-how to wrap stolenradioactive material around sticks of dynamite and blow it up. The radioactivecontamination floating on the dust and wind could make dozens of city blocksin any city unlivable for decades to come. Imagine millions of New Yorkerstrying to get off the island if one or more dirty bombs went off? The economicand psychological toll, beyond physical destruction from the explosion orexplosions, would be huge possibly requiring evacuation from most of the city. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"What is particularly disturbing about this most recent Nuclear Regulatory alertabout the missing plutonium and americium is the fact that the shipment wasreceived on December 7, 2001. But the package was not even opened until May20, 2002, five months later. That's when it was discovered the flame-sealed glasscontainer designed to hold the radioactive substances inside the shipping boxand protective plastic container was empty. The FBI was called in to investigate.But the Nuclear Regulatory Commission waited until June 24 to issue the alert. I talked about the dangers of missing and stolen radioactive materials in theUnited States with Scott Portzline. Scott helped the volunteer civilian ThreeMile Island Alert group in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania monitor radiation andsecurity near that nuclear power plant. He has testified before the U. S. Senate,the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Advisory Committee on ReactorSafeguards and other governmental bodies in an effort to close security gaps thathe has found. His research has been cited by the U. S. Department of Energyand various military branches. Scott worries that dirty bombs and attacks onnuclear power plants are high on the Al Qaeda terrorist To Do list in the UnitedStates. Scott Portzline, Former Security Chairman,Three Mile Island Alert, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.Sportzline@home.comInterview:Scott Portzline, Former Security Chairman for Three Mile Island Alert(TMIA), Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: \"The AEA Technology and KnollsAtomic Power Laboratory case shows there is still not a proper control. If youreceive something that can be deadly like this, then you should be required toconfirm that the contents are inside that package within a few hours, maybe asmuch as 24 hours.At least. And where did the plutonium and americium go if they weren't inthe package?Nobody knows! The FBI was notified. The initial report suggested the packagewas shipped to England.There is a precursor to this event that involved a large amount of Iridium-192and it was shipped from the AEA Technologies near Boston. It was supposed togo to Mexico. But what happened was that they lost track of it and it wound upat an airport outside London, England. So, this huge source of Iridium-192 866curies was missing for ten days. It set off a frantic 5 day search along the roadbetween the company and the Boston Airport for any signs of radiation.This occurred on what date?April 1999. And it was being shipped by Fed Ex. Plutonium and things like thiscan be shipped through Federal Express. Radium-192 can be very deadly.There is a 1999 precedent of radioactive material going astray in a Fed Exshipment. Now in 2002, there is missing americium and plutonium from apackage shipped in December and not opened until May. No one knowswhere the material is and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is only nowmaking the alert announcement.Yes. And that's a good point. That was a huge loss in 1999. Yet, nobody was"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"saying anything in the news about, 'Look out for this package. It could kill a lotof people in the Boston or New York area.'It was my telephone call to the Boston Globe that first broke this story becauseof the dangers involved. I've experienced this in the past. I monitor the dailyevent reports from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Back in 1996, I startednoticed a high volume in my opinion of lost or stolen nuclear materials in theUnited States. So I made a few phone calls to other researchers and anti-nuclearactivists and found that nobody was really monitoring this side of the nuclearindustry. I started attending some of the meetings that were happening at theNuclear Regulatory Commission.Missing radioactive materials are happening every other day that I candocument. But I can extrapolate that it's actually occurring every day -radioactive substances in the United States are lost, stolen or found. One Ton of Beryllium and Cobalt SmuggledThere was an incident in Texas on December 19, 1996 where Mexican customagents found a truck crossing from Texas into Mexico. It had a false bottom.There was some sort of metal material. They weren't sure what it was, so theyasked for help from the nearby Ft. Bliss Army base. They wanted to know if thematerial was radioactive.Well, it turned out to be a ton of cobalt and beryllium.A to n?A ton of cobalt and beryllium, highly radioactive, highly dangerous. Beryllium isused to produce neutrons in a chain reaction in a nuclear weapon. I'mspeculating that this came from one of the nuclear laboratories out in the Westlike Los Alamos or Colorado.Why was all this radioactive material being smuggled in the false bottom ofa truck?That's a good question. I called the people who were mentioned in the initialreport. I called the FBI. I called the police. I called one of the soldiers at Ft.Bliss that was mentioned. Everybody said they didn't know what I was talkingabout. That told me that national security had just been breached.Is your implication that they had knowledge and would not admit it?Sure. There were no further reports. I think the initial report that came outshouldn't have come out, that it got by the classifiers at the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission. This was an event that indicated somebody had beryllium used fornuclear weapons and cobalt and was obviously smuggling it. It was hidden inthe false bottom of this truck. The government did not want to talk about it.Do you have any idea what happened to that ton of radioactive material?No, but I'm hopeful that it was ceased by the agents and has been taken care ofproperly. Mock Security Drills At Nuclear Weapons LaboratoriesWe also have security problems at some of the nuclear weapons laboratories,which I just indicated. There were security drills at the Los Alamos NuclearLaboratory, controlled by the Department of Energy, where mock intrudersgained control of enough uranium to cause a nuclear detonation. They weren'table to get off-site with it, but if they had been suicidal terrorists, they wouldhave been able to assemble it into a crude nuclear device and destroy it then.Another drill at Rocky Flats, Colorado nuclear facility, mock intruders stole"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"enough plutonium for several nuclear bombs. What they did, to test the securityguards there, one intruder went into the facility with a lacrosse stick and threwplutonium over the fence to someone else with another lacrosse stick. Then theywent outside and a minute or two later, they saw all the guards high fiving eachother who believed they had successfully repelled the attackers since they didn'tsee anybody. But their alarms went off and they figured the intruders hadretreated. So, here the guards were congratulating themselves, yet enoughplutonium had just been stolen to produce several nuclear bombs from theirfacility.You have been trying to monitor missing radioactive materials since 1996.Now we have gone through September 11th and all Americans arewondering what is going to happen July 4. What is your personal greatestconcern about an event that could happen?My greatest concern is selfish. I live about 13 miles from Three Mile Island. I amconcerned there is going to be a commando attack or an airplane attack onThree Mile Island. Three Mile Island keeps being mentioned by the terrorists.They had a training camp nearby in 1993 where they did a nighttime mockassault on an electrical substation as if they were practicing going into a nuclearplant. They threatened to attack nuclear plants.In fact, just a few days after the World Trade Center was bombed in 1993, thesame terrorists that had the training camp near Three Mile Island threatened toattack nuclear plants with 150 suicide soldiers. So, my concern or my greatestfear is an attack on a nuclear plant. What Dirty Bombs Could DoSee Earthfiles 05/25/02But what would be easier to do would be the dirty bombs. I would picture adirty bomb event happening in some of the larger cities where it can do thegreatest terror or greatest economic damage. In my opinion, the greatest problemis not the terror, but the economic damage that will occur.The radioactivity would contaminate buildings, sidewalks, metals, justabout everything?That is a possibility with a larger bomb and a lot of dust and a lot of radioactiveparticulate matter.What would happen in a city like New York if two or three dirty bombswere set off?They would be totally devastating. The first thing you would see happen wouldbe people trying to evacuate. There would probably be some people harmed injust that hurried evacuation. No order would have to be given. People wouldjust do it. There would be public urgings of people not to try to evacuate fromcertain areas because they would just be adding to the problem.Secondly, you would see this tremendous need for health screening. Peoplewould inundate hospitals wanting to be measured for radioactivity. Some ofthem would already be having symptoms that were real. Some would havesymptoms that are imagined. The economic burden of just the health effects andevacuation would be tremendous.Then you have to have the responders who are measuring the radiation, trying todetermine what the exclusion zone should be, the evacuation zone. Finally, youwould have disruption of business, possibly the loss of buildings for blocks andblocks, dozens of blocks, even hundreds of blocks.Even a hundred square miles if there were three large dirty bombs exploded.The economic impact could easily reach the multi-trillions of dollars."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"To clean up a city, there would first have to be a mass exodus of a lot ofpeople out of an island like Manhattan for some indeterminate period oftime.That's right. There would be reluctance to live there, to work there. In otherwords, you would almost have to rebuild an entire Manhattan somewhere else.Move all those businesses, the corporate offices. They wouldn't want to havetheir workers go in to an area where people aren't comfortable.Three Mile Island nuclear power plant near Pennsylvania's state capitol,Harrisburg, and the Harrisburg International Airport.Security At Three Mile Island Prior to Fourth of July 2002The National Guard is there and security seems tighter, but the front main gate isstill open most of the time. Just last week I found out that the FBI has asked theguards at nuclear power plants to check the identification and photograph anypeople who are filming or videotaping at a nuclear plant or any surveillanceactivity that they are suspicious about. If anyone crosses a boundary line at anuclear plant, they are to get their identification. I learned this was going onbecause some of the guards have been reporting to the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission or to the FBI that they believe they have seen some of the terroristswhose photographs are on the FBI watch list.To think that today in June 2002 as we go into the Fourth of July that someof those characters from the FBI's most wanted terrorist list might behanging around nuclear power plants is unsettling.It sure is. I'm concerned that they are doing their homework. Al Qaedaoperatives have had plant designs and schematics. They were found in caves inAfghanistan.Also, last week, a Pennsylvania legislator sponsored legislation to urge thegovernor of PA to give the National Guardsmen at the nuclear power plantsloaded weapons. They have to suspend the normal rules in order to get that onthe table. For some reason they had to resort to political highjinks to get acommon sense bill before the legislation which only urges the governor to givethe national guardsmen loaded weapons.In the light of 9/11, why would there be any question or resistance tohaving guards at nuclear power plants have loaded weapons?I think there is some concern of having a misfire, that somebody could beinjured by a mistake made at a nuclear plant. For instance, just last week at theFitzpatrick Nuclear Plant in New York, there was an accident with a NationalGuardsman in a humvee where they forgot to set the parking brake on a shiftchange and it rolled into Lake Ontario.Who are the people in security at nuclear power plants these days?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The National Guard are just your average neighbor, not necessarily trained toprotect a nuclear power plant. There are going to be mistakes that are going tobe made, but there is also concern with the ammunition of regular companyguards at these plants who have accidentally fired their weapons. One manaccidentally shot his foot. Another shot into his vehicle. Mock Nuclear Security Exercises at U. S. Air Force BasesDr. John Weinstein, he is chief command and control of the nuclear support staffin Washington, D. C. for the U. S. Army. He gave a lecture at the U. S. ArmyWar College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania on Jan. 19, 1998 which I attended. Hetold us that in 75% of these security tests at Air Force Bases, the mock intruderswere able to get access to nuclear weapons. And in 33% of the tests, theyactually made off with the weapons.While we keep pointing to the Soviet Union as a source of nuclear materials tobe used as dirty bombs, or even the ultimate nuclear weapon, right here in theUnited States we have enormous gaps in our security.Clear evidence that radioactive material is lost or stolen or handledsloppily all of the time.Ye s .It is almost like we all need to be walking around with a Geiger counternow because you don't know exactly where all the invisible radiation couldbe.I have two portable Geiger counters and a third that I got at a Dept. of Defense.It's a Civil Defense unit I need to get calibrated.Another thing that happened this week was at the Point Beach Nuclear Plant inWisconsin. One of the security guards tested positive for drugs and so they hadto let him go. That meant the plant went below the minimum number of guardsrequired. That also tells me that even at this time of terrorist threats, nuclearpower plants are still using the absolute minimum number of guards that theNRC says they should have.This happened right before the Fourth of July after the FBI warned aboutThree Mile Island more than a month ago.That's right.\"We b s it e :http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/event-status/event/http://www.fas.orghttp://www.tmia.comhttp://www.nci.orghttp://www.whitehouse.gov/homeland/http://www.nrc.govCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Republication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
