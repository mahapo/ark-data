Twenty-sevenyears later, in 2001 to 2002, Pondera County and surrounding region experienced morethan adozen animal mutilations associated with unidentified lights and other high strangeness.See Earthfiles 08/18/01. pparently whoever was at the controls of those unidentified helicopters thenight of December 2 to 3 enjoyed harassing law and Air Force officials, as thefollowing night (December 3), more sightings were reported. Officers were ableto trace the crafts' course through a series of reports spanning a two hour and 40minute period, but were unable to identify them. This time the calls originated in Choteau and were based on phone callsreceived in the Teton County Sheriff's Office, as well as on reports of lawofficers and contacts with Malmstrom. A Teton County law officer radioed in at6:59 p.m. to report a helicopter south of Dutton and headed east toward FortBenton. Five minutes later, the officer said the craft was over the Juliet 11missile site in that area. A check with Malmstrom Air Force Base to determine if it was an Air Forcechopper received a \"negative\" reply. The unidentified chopper, flying at lowaltitude, had a strobe light. Attempts by FAPCON (Radar Approach Control, acivilian agency) to pick it up on radar were unsuccessful. At 7:40 p.m., the Teton County officer established that it was not one, but two,helicopters and at that time, one was heading east and one west. Eight minutes"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"later, another officer reported two helicopters over Bootlegger trail north ofGreat Falls, flying toward the city. The helicopters seemed to multiply like rabbits. By 7:54 p.m., Malmstrom AFBreceived reports of two helicopters over Juliet 5 missile site between Great Fallsand Fort Benton (northeast of Great Falls) and two northeast of Conrad (whichis northwest of Great Falls) traveling toward Fort Benton. This was basically thesame general area as the sightings of the night before. At 8:11 p.m., Choteau reported choppers south and east of Dutton, near theTeton-Chouteau county line. At 8:33 p.m. there was a report of three helicopterswith flashing red lights over the Juliet 5 missile site near Fort Benton. Withintwo minutes, all had left the area and at 8:52 p.m., they were reported seven oreight miles southwest of the missile site. Malmstrom's Wing Security verified thatthere were unidentified helicopters in the area. At 9:40 that evening, two helicopters were reported ten miles north of GreatFalls. Neither Malmstrom nor the tower at Gore Hill could confirm the report,nor could they identify the craft. Deputy Arne Sand wearily summed up theevening's activity in his report, saying, \"the office sent me north of Great Fallschasing lights in the sky again, and they were similar to the ones the nightbefore. Again, I was not able to see any shape of the objects behind the lights.\" He was referring to his experience of the night before when he participated inthe chase that took law officers over a wide area. At that time, he was sent toback up the Dutton town marshal, when the marshal saw bright lights in the sky.What happened is related in Deputy Sand's own words in his official report: \"Between Power and Dutton, a bright white light, about 500 feet above theground came from the west and crossed the highway behind me going east. Iwas not able to see any shape of the object. For the next two hours, the lightswould come and go. At about 3:30 a.m. on 12/3/75, Dick Gasvoda and myselfwere just arriving at Fort Shaw when the office called and said that some typeof aircraft was hovering over the missile site at Vaughn. So, back we went andwhen we got by the feed lots, west of Vaughn, we saw a bright white light overthe feed lots. It was going west at a high rate of speed. The object crossed thehighway in front of us and headed towards Great Falls. I talked to thesergeant at the missile site and he said the craft was over the site with abright light, but could not see any shape and did not sound like a helicopter.\" Where to draw the line between unidentified helicopters and unidentified flyingobjects (UFOs) is difficult to determine. In some cases, the craft has been seenplainly enough to determine definitely that it looks like a helicopter. At othertimes, the bright light emitted by the craft made it impossible to exactlydetermine the shape or outline of the craft. The method of flight often resembled a helicopter, but there were many moreincidents when the speed and method of climbing was such that it could notconceivably be a helicopter. And sometimes the viewer's description of what hesaw ruled out the possibility of a helicopter. Helicopter or UFO - between August 1975, and May 1976, the Cascade CountySheriff's office received about 130 reports of sightings in the five-county area.Frustrated officers found that in many instances, by the time they reached theplace where the sighting had taken place, the object in question was gone. It isdifficult to investigate something that is no longer there. Reports came in from many areas. The sheriff's office at Fort Benton reported ahelicopter 20 miles east of that community. Malmstrom said there were no AirForce choppers in that area. A woman at Eden told of a helicopter flying lowright over her ranch home. A resident of Chestnut Valley watched a helicopterflying for about an hour over the area where he lived. An unidentified helicopterreported flying over Cascade turned out to be one belonging to the Montana Air"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"National Guard. On the night of December 4, 1975, immediately after the rash of sightings, whichkept law officers busy for two nights, an officer saw a helicopter lift off fromwhat looked to be the Deaconess Hospital landing pad at the southeast edge ofGreat Falls. He checked with the hospital's emergency room the next morningand was told that no helicopters had landed there during the night. Late on the afternoon of December 8, the sheriff's office received a report that amissile team had spotted a helicopter about 1,000 feet above Fox 10 missile site,west of Choteau and Augusta in the mountains. It was also seen from Fox 9 andwas believed to be headed toward that site. About an hour later, MalmstromAFB notified the sheriff's office that there were lights on the ground two milessouth of the Fox 10 site. There are no roads into this particular area and, inaddition, the lights appeared too far apart to be the headlights of a car. At about the same time, a Vaughn resident reported seeing three smallhelicopters flying in the area of Bootlegger Trail. He said one was at an altitudeof about 50 feet and the other two at about 150 feet. All were dark colored. Acheck with the NORAD command center showed no evidence of the chopperson radar. NORAD confirmed that all Malmstrom helicopters were in. A short time later, a report was received that a woman living near Portage hadnoticed some men around her farm machinery, but when they saw her theyjumped in their helicopters and left. She told officers she saw two helicopters ina wheat field about 50 yards from the house. A report was also received from the sheriff at Fort Benton who thought onehelicopter was flying toward Great Falls while another was down in the Portagearea. The mystery was solved - at least this time - when an officer in theCanadian Air Force phoned the Cascade County Sheriff's Department later inthe evening to tell officers he was flying the helicopter that went down nearPortage due to engine trouble. He said he landed as near a residence as possibleand knocked on the door, but no one was home. Another Canadian chopper pilot came to his rescue, helped him repair his craftand they both took off for Malmstrom. The distraught residents who reportedseeing the helicopters were informed by the sheriff's office that there wasnothing to be alarmed about. A few days later, Malmstrom AFB notified the Cascade County Sheriff'sDepartment that crews at a missile site near Ulm, south of Great Falls, hadreported seeing three helicopters flying at 150 feet altitude around the site. Theysaid they frightened one away by shining a large light on it. Sheriff's officers were on their way to the site when they received a radiomessage to \"disregard\" as the choppers had been identified as belonging to theArmy National Guard. the incident was almost forgotten when it happened tocome up in conversation some time later between Captain Wolverton and anArmy National Guard official. The latter denied the choppers had belonged tothe National Guard. In some instances, the sightings of unidentified helicoptershad a logical explanation, but in most cases they did not. Chouteau County deputies reported seeing two helicopters flying about 300 to400 feet above the ground. They were described as having a large red light and awhite strobe light. NORAD confirmed no Air Force choppers were out and saidthey could not locate the craft on radar. Reports of unidentified helicopters continued to come in from different areas.RAPCON reported a chopper sighting between Ulm and Cascade on December22, 1975. And a Great Falls man reported hearing a helicopter fly over himwhile he was camped in Prickly Pear Canyon on February 18, 1976.These and all other reports were recorded as officers continued to piece togetherthe parts of a baffling puzzle."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" To be continued in Chapter 8 - Teenage Girls Chased by UFOCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
