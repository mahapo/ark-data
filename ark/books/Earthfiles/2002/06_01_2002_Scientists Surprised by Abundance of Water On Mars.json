For several decades, traces of atmospheric water and some water ice alongwith frozen carbon dioxide at the poles had been known. But where had all thewater gone that had once flowed through the rivers and canyons? Apparently,the oxidized, rusty surface has been deceiving. Less than a meter below the redrocks and dust in very cold regions, scientists have found a signal for theelement hydrogen that is so strong it's assumed to be frozen H2O (water),according to this week's journal Science.

Four months ago in February 2002, astronomers and geologists had just turnedon the gamma ray spectrometer and other instruments aboard NASA/JPL'sorbiting Mars Odyssey spacecraft to get the instruments ready to explore forwater. The gamma ray spectrometer wasn't even in its correct position whenscientists were surprised by a strong hydrogen signal. The detection of hydrogenis based both on the intensity of gamma rays emitted by hydrogen and by theintensity of neutrons that are affected by hydrogen. Since February, the Mars Odyssey instruments have returned so much data thatNASA/JPL scientists have been able to produce beautiful maps of the hydrogendistribution in both the Southern and Northern Hemispheres of Mars. So farestimates on the amount of hydrogen indicate the icy layer is about half waterice by volume. That means if you had a gallon of the dirty ice and heated it, youwould end up with a half gallon of water."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"A global view of Mars in intermediate-energy, or epithermal, neutrons,based on data in February and March 2002 from one of the instrumentsin the gamma ray spectrometer suite.

Prof. of Astronomy atCornell University. Dr. Bell is also a member of the Mars Odyssey CameraTeam. Previously, he worked on the Pathfinder Rover Team and is involved withthe two upcoming Mars Exploration Rovers that will launch next year for aMars landing in 2004. With this week's announcement of frozen water only ameter down over large regions of Mars, Professor Bell called the discovery a\"stunning surprise.\" Interview:Jim Bell, Ph.D., Asst. Professor of Astronomy, Cornell University, andmember of the Mars Odyssey Camera Team and 2003-2004 MarsExploration Rovers: \"What is surprising and what is, I think, quite stunning, isthat the Odyssey measurements have detected the presence of water iceunderground not on the surface but underground. And that is somewhere youcan't see with a camera, you can't take pictures of underground ice. You needinstruments like the gamma ray spectrometer, like the neutron spectrometer, tomake that detection.Today, Mars is a cold, dry and barren world with no liquid water on its surface.But if you look carefully at the pictures, and many astronomers have, in someplaces on Mars there is evidence that long ago lots of liquid water flowed acrossthe surface. There is evidence for channels and ancient river systems and gulliesand streamlined islands that could only be created by the flow of large amountsof liquid water. Those are wonderful evidence that a liquid was there like waterin the past, but it's not there today. And so the question that has been oneveryone's mind is: where did all that water go? Mars was an earth-like planet,perhaps with a higher atmospheric pressure and higher surface temperature thatwould allow liquid water on its surface, but it's not an earthlike planet today."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Something happened in that environment, water went away. It went somewhere.And in the Odyssey results, I think we may have part of the answer. At leastsome of that water appears to have seeped into the subsurface and frozen inplace as these icy deposits that have been detected by the spacecraft.Why would it go down at least a meter underground?That's an excellent question and I believe it has to do with the nature of theMartian surface. Again when we look at pictures of the planet, we see in manyplaces on Mars a battered surface that's been hammered by asteroids and cometsfor billions of years and many places on Mars look a lot like the moon, forexample. Many impact craters all over the place. The surface has beenhammered and every time you crash an asteroid or comet into the surface, youbreak it up, you shatter the rock. It becomes very fragmented and porous. Andso the uppermost surface of Mars is likely to be a jumbled, fragmented, veryporous kind of material with lots of space between rocks and grains that wouldallow any liquid flowing across the surface to seep down into that surface itself.Ice formed a milky layer in this Martian Lowell Crater as theSouthern Hemisphere moved into its fall/winter season.Photo courtesy NASA/JPL/Malin Space Science Systems.Any idea yet from any of the data how deep into Mars this frozen ice mightgo if it is starting in the three feet below the red dusty surface?Well, that's the $64,000 question that everybody is asking. The Odysseymeasurements are only directly sensitive to the uppermost meter or uppermostfew feet or so of the surface and that is where the detection of this water ice hasbeen made, in that uppermost meter. But no one really knows where the bottomof that layer is. There is some evidence that the layer changes depth withposition on the planet. It is perhaps much deeper near the equator where thetemperatures are warmer and shallower near the poles where the temperaturesare colder.But where the bottom of that layer is right now, is anyone's guess. What's goingto be required to find out is more measurements, more remote sensingmeasurements from orbital spacecraft. Perhaps the deployment of additionalinstruments from rovers or landers in future missions that will be able to try tosense the depth of this icy layer using radar or electromagnetic soundingtechniques like the same ones that are used in places like Siberia where there ispermafrost and places like Greenland and Antarctica and study the ice layersthere.Ultimately the final test might not be made until people actually go there withlarge, fairly cumbersome drilling rigs and other drilling equipment andastronauts can get down into those layers and extend drills down many meters,perhaps tens of meters, perhaps hundreds of meters, down into the subsurface,to see where the bottom of that layer really is."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Are we talking about hard ice like you would get out of an ice maker? Orpermafrost?The signal that has been detected by the spacecraft has been modeled byscientists as being consistent with something like 20, 30, 40 percent ice byweight, which is about half percent weight by volume. So, if you stuck a shovelin the ground and dug a shovel full of this stuff up and dumped it on the tablewhat you would get is a dirty slurry mixture of ice and rock and dust, all kind ofmixed together.Dr. Jeff Plaut at JPL (Radar Specialist) said that there are indications insome areas that it might be almost pure ice as if there are undergroundpools, or globs, of ice.It's possible. Again, it depends on how you model it. Certainly it's notunambiguous that that's the case. But, one of the things I talked about earlierthat is interesting and exciting about this result from the Odyssey is there arethese maps, spatial maps, across the entire planet of the strength of this(hydrogen) ice signal. So, what Jeff Plaut is talking about is there are some smallareas where the signal is much stronger than in other areas. So that either couldindicate a more pure ice component or perhaps a more abundant ice component,a deeper ice deposit in that area than in other areas.How much water in total between the two hemispheres do you think we aretalking about if it all melted?If it all melted, that's a great question. It depends on the depth. How deep doesthat layer go? If it's only a meter deep, which would I think be kind of surprisingbecause that just happens to be the depth that we can sense to if it's only a meterdeep, then we're not talking about a lot of water perhaps a Great Lakes quantityspread across the whole planet, producing a layer maybe centimeters thickwhich isn't really a lot of water. Earth has kilometers of water on its surface, forexample.However, if that layer really does extend down many tens of meters or hundredsof meters in places, then we get up to the level of talking about a small sea orocean's worth of water perhaps trapped in the surface. And that's why I had aquestion mark in my original commentary on this Tip of the Iceberg? Are wereally looking at an ocean's worth of water stored in the subsurface? Or is it justa small amount? It's a very important question which has real implications forfuture explorers when they get to Mars.It's almost like an ironic cosmic joke that the red desert, dusty planet ofour solar system should have so much potential water just a meter down?Mars is a planet of spectacular cosmic contrasts. It's a relatively small earth-likeplanet and yet it has the largest volcanoes in the solar system.And the deepest, biggest canyon.Perhaps nowhere as geologically active as the earth, and yet it has the largestand deepest canyon system. And then as you just said, it's a dry, cold,inhospitable world, and yet just below the surface there may be in fact evidencepreserved there that tells us in fact that Mars was a much different, much moreearth-like place early in its history.What about the possibility of microbes in that icy region?It's a fun thing to think about and people wouldn't have given it much possibility5 or 10 years ago, but we've discovered on the earth that bacterial life forms areall over the place in the most unlikely environments, including in the permafrostof Siberia, including in battery acid type water in deep mines, including at thebottom of the ocean where there is no sunlight available. The most wild andcrazy places on the earth, life has a foothold and it seems to be thriving in them.So, it's not crazy any more to talk about the possibility of life in the Martiansubsurface. We have no evidence there is any life, but what we do have is"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"evidence that many of the conditions that are necessary for life as we know it aremet there, including the possibility of liquid water, including heat sources fromvolcanism from impact of geothermal heat and including organic moleculeswhich have been raining down on all the planets from asteroids and cometssince the beginning of the solar system.What will be the first instruments or machines on landers and rovers to tryto bore down into the soil to look at the icy soil?Well, the first one that would have tried was the 1999 polar lander spacecraft,but that unfortunately crashed and its mission was a failure. It had an arm thatwas to dig a trench into the surface and it was going to land at a very highlatitude in the Southern Hemisphere. So, it may have unearthed some of theseicy deposits. Of course, that mission crashed and that couldn't happen.The next two NASA missions that go will be the Mars Exploration Rovers andboth of those will be going to relatively equatorial regions, so they won't have acapability to dig into these deposits. They also don't have drilling devices.But beyond that, the next series of missions in either 2007 or 2009, I think it islikely that we will see a relatively modest drilling capability, or trenchingcapability, to try to get down into the most upper meter or meter and half or soof the subsurface and I think there will be a strong push based on these resultsand others to try to land the next generation of landers and rovers at highlatitudes and get into these icy deposits.Why wouldn't we change our launch directions next year?Can't do it. Celestial mechanics, Isaac Newton it's just too far along in theprocess and for the launch vehicle that we have available to us we are restrictedto equatorial latitudes.What about England's Beagles would they be able to dig down?No, Beagle is a very small, simple landing device that deploys some instrumentsand takes some pictures and makes some other relatively simple measurements.But there is no mobility or trenching capability.So, we have tantalizing indications in 2002 of a lot of water ice under thesurface of Mars, but we won't be able to do physical digging for maybethree to five more years?You've hit the nail on the head, exactly. We will collect more data from orbit. Ofcourse, the Odyssey Mission has just started, so these measurements willcontinue to get refined. The Mars Exploration Rovers that will get launchednext year will address the issue of water that could be trapped in minerals atequatorial latitudes. That is part of the picture that Odyssey is also showing, butwill not be able to dig down into these deposits at high latitudes.Personally, what is your greatest interest in exploring Mars?I'm very interested in this issue of how Mars may have been earth-like a longtime ago, and yet it is not today. How do you change a planet's climate sodramatically? How do you go from a possibly warm and wet earth-like world tothe cold and barren desert-like planet that we have today? And what could thatmean for ourselves on our planet?\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Northern Hemisphere cap of carbon dioxide frost and some waterice in summer.
