This has not always been easy, as memory plays tricks on people whoare frightened or excited. And people find it difficult, sometimes, to describesomething few others have ever seen. Despite these obvious problems, officers have done everything possible tosubstantiate reports. They visited the scene of mutilations and sightings andsearched for every shred of evidence. In some cases, they have questioned othersliving in the area. They also administered lie detector tests. At times, the officers personally knew the witness and could vouch for hisreliability. And occasionally it was that sixth sense experienced lawmen seem todevelop that helps them know when someone is telling the truth. It isn't alwayseasy to spot a phony, but if anyone can weed them out, it often is a law officer. However, there is at least one classic example of a man who told such aconvincing (but untrue) story that he fooled not only officers but other people,including a writer whose story, based on the man's information, was published ina national magazine. The writer, who wrote the story under a pen name, later told Captain Wolvertonthat he did not know at the time that the information was false and he nowregrets writing the story. The information for the story originated with a man(referred to in chapter three) who was a long term inmate in a Midwest federalpenitentiary. It is not certain where he obtained his so-called \"information,\" butthe best guess is through the prison grapevine. His story had just enoughaccurate information in it, including names of individuals, to give it credibility. According to the convict's story, the cattle mutilations were the work of a cultheaded by a man in Texas. The man he named does exist, but extensive checkingfailed to link him to anything out of the ordinary. Cattle mutilations were only the beginning, the convict said. He claimed that themutilation of humans was next and had already started. He said that four peoplehad been mutilated at Lake Kozad, Nebraska. Captain Wolverton contacted thesheriff there, who told him that no bodies had been found and there were noreports of missing people in that area. It was the sheriff's opinion that the entirestory was false. Cultists were doing the cattle mutilations, the convict said, to see if they couldget away with it. If not detected, they planned to start on humans next, includinga number of prominent people in the political field, news media and Hollywood"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"actors. He had what he claimed was a list of 35 people who were to be killed,including some from Montana. Captain Wolverton and Deputy Arne Sand, a polygraph examiner, made a trip tothe prison to interview the convict. Deputy Sand administered a polygraph testto the man and he failed almost every question, including very simple ones.Checks made later on different aspects of his story all proved his tale false andnone of the predictions the convict made have come true. It was the officers' opinion after talking with the prisoner and checking his storythat the whole thing was part of the convict's plan to obtain a release fromprison or a transfer to a prison with less security. In the meantime, the storycaused considerable harm, as it had been reported by a number of newspapers asfactual, including at least one newspaper in the north-central Montana area.Officers were concerned that the story would cause undue apprehension andeven panic. One curious aspect of the situation in Montana and other states is that thefederal government does not seem to be doing any investigating of cattlemutilations. Or if it is, it is not sharing its information with local officials. At onetime during the investigation, Captain Wolverton received a phone call from aDepartment of Agriculture official in Washington, D. C., inquiring about cattlemutilations in Montana. He indicated in his conversation that he was veryinterested and said he would fly to Great Falls the following week to confer withthe Cascade County Sheriff's Department on the incidents. Captain Wolverton and Deputy Anderson worked frantically to assemble copiesof all of their reports and photographs for the man. He never arrived, nor wasthere any further communication from him. The absence of any federalinvestigation into something so important to the safety and welfare of theAmerican public has made law officers wonder whether or not someone in highcircles knows what is behind the mutilations, UFOs, and other mysteries, but isnot disclosing this information. \"Call it a gut feeling,\" Captain Wolverton said, \"but I have a notion somebodyknows what is going on.\" The theory is only a wild guess, but it could explain why official Washingtonseems to be ignoring the entire situation. If the federal government is ignoringthe situation, some private organizations of national scope certainly are not. Onein Pennsylvania has investigated several hundred incidents in that state and aspokesman for the group told Captain Wolverton over the telephone that \"thereis no doubt the things are for real.\" He added that UFO sightings have been reported in many places in the worldand have increased in recent months. He also ventured a guess that there was alink between the cattle mutilations and the strange hairy creatures that havebeen seen in several states. The reports of hairy creatures received in that area, the spokesman said, havecome from responsible people, some of whom were not well educated and livein back country where they would not have read newspaper accounts of similarincidents. Montana Rancher Shoots At Bigfoot Creature That Disappeared in \"Flash ofLight\" One man reported shooting one of the \"creatures\" from six feet with a double-barreled shotgun. He reported that it \"disappeared in a flash of light.\" In some instances the strange creatures have been seen carrying small animals intheir arms and some have been seen in the same vicinity and at the same time asUFOs. The creatures have been seen in populated, as well as wooded areas,although they seem to prefer the latter. Some have been described as having"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"glowing eyes\" and people have reported that the creatures had a pungent odorresembling rotten eggs. Some have been seen swimming in water. As in Montanacases, the man said otherwise aggressive dogs seem immobilized with fear andfail to bark at the creatures. One theory being studied by those at the Pennsylvania center is that thecreatures may be a psychic phenomena, visible to some and not to others andpossibly non-physical. This could at least explain why some people describe thecreatures as transparent, report that bullets do not stop them and tell of thecreatures disappearing before their eyes. Another organization, which is doing extensive research into the strangecreatures, operates out of New Jersey. A man formerly affiliated with it in thatstate is now a deputy sheriff in southwestern Montana and is coordinatingMontana's investigation with that in New Jersey. He told Captain Wolverton that in one recent month, a total of 244substantiated reports of UFOs were received in one county in Pennsylvania.That area has been plagued for three years, he said, by numerous reports of UFOsightings, followed by cattle mutilations and then sightings of the hairycreatures. Comparing reports from various parts of the country, it is discovered that the\"creatures\" vary in appearance, but all have some similarities. They are reportedto have anywhere from three to five toes. In some areas, they have canine-typefangs and the estimate of their size has varied. A man with a research society in Michigan said, in a telephone conversationwith Captain Wolverton, he once shot a \"creature,\" which screamed and thendisappeared into a swamp. He said the track it left was five-toed and measured15 inches long and ten inches wide. The impression in the ground was one and ahalf inches deep. The New Jersey organization is now using computers to study the informationassembled thus far on UFOs, hairy creatures and mutilations. One conclusionreached is that the incidents seem to happen mainly on hot, humid days in thatarea. In any case, the incidents are taken seriously by those investigating them andevery effort is being made to solve the mystery. However, in all the checking thatCaptain Wolverton and the Cascade County deputies have accomplished hereand elsewhere, there have been absolutely no reports of any human being havingbeen harmed by the Bigfoot \"creatures.\" To be continued in Chapter 13 - UFO Reported in 1897Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
