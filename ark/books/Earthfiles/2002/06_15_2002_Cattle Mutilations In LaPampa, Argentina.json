June 15, 2002 Rio Colorado - Since April 2002, more than two dozen cattle have beenreported by La Pampa Province, Argentina farmers to local authorities because their deathsare not normal. Cut from the animals' bodies without blood are ears, eyes, tongues, jawflesh, genitals, udders, rectum and vaginal tissue. The town with the greatest number so faris General Acha. The total number of mutilated cattle there varies from eight to eighteen.Other affected towns so far are Chuchillo Co, Jacinto Arauz, Quehue, Santa Rosa, Toay,Rivera, Macachin, Villa Iris and Salliquelo.Yellow highlight indicates the towns in the La Pampa Province of Argentina,about 200 miles southwest of Buenos Aires, which havereported cattle mutilations since April 2002.Scott Corrales, Director of the Institute of Hispanic Ufology in Bradford, Pennsylvania,has been translating Argentina newspaper articles since the wave of mutilations began. OnJune 14, he reported that the latest cases were found in Macachin and Rivera onWednesday, June 12, 2002. One of the farmers, Mr. Diez, showed the newspaper, Diario\"La Arena\" a videotape of his mutilated cow and \"explained that he had found a dead cowwhose organs had been removed through incisions, showing 'evident signs of cauterization,'or high heat.According to the farmer's son and the videotape, the cow had a \"perfectly round markaround its ocular (eye) cavity, from which the orb (eye) was completely missing.\" The lipswere cleanly excised along with the tongue \"with signs of high temperature.Scott reports, \"Another incision began in the abdominal area and progressed toward the tailwhere it was perfectly skinned back revealing the absence of mammary glands,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"reproductive organs, anus and intestines.\"Argentina media photographs above related to 2002 cattlemutilation investigations. Sources unknown.The day before on June 13, 2002, Diario \"La Arena\" reported two cases in the capital SantaRosa and nearby Toay. Scott's translation began: \"It is a strange event closer to home: (two)dead cows lacking organs or blood which have flourished throughout the province andastonished many, without any explanation having been found for such a singularphenomenon. Farm animals near Santa Rosa had their turn now, and not only did theprovincial police become involved, but professionals from the National University of LaPampa involved themselves to perform analyses. (These) two deaths near this capital citywhich can be added to the twenty uncanny bovine deaths in the province.\"One of these animals, a 9-month-old cow, was found dead on June 3. But by June 10,something had returned to the animal to remove tissue from its face, neck and sexualorgans. Farmer Claudio Ferrero reported the animal and on June 12, Sheriff Hector Garcia,officer Nestor Garcia, a team of criminalists, and veterinarians from the School ofVeterinary Medicine at the University of La Pampa investigated the cow.Scott translated, \"Camcorder in hand, the authorities followed the autopsy performed by(the veterinarians) in the cold morning air. The autopsy team, which arrived from GeneralPico, consisted of veterinarians Alberto Parani, Jorge Dubani and Abel Herrera, whoconducted an on-site visual inspection. The experts took samples, opened the cow, andfinally removed its head. They found that the animal's face was missing its muscles, alongwith the musculature of the neck. Furthermore, a hole was discovered in the animal'shindquarters through which its genitals were extracted.\"The animal's face 'looked as though it had been burned,' according to Ferrero, and twostrange incisions were noted on an ear and on the neck.\"Strange Nocturnal Lights One of the first Diario \"La Arena\" newspaper reports about the cattle mutilation mystery inLa Pampa was back on April 29, 2002. That headline read, \"Strange Case in Salliquelo:Mutilated Animals Appear in Wake of Nocturnal Lights.Scott Corrales translated that article beginning, \"A few days ago strange lights appeared inthe night skies over Salliquelo, Province of Buenos Aires, and in the morning cattleranchers of the area found three mutilated bovines showing signs of having undergone asurgical intervention with unusual implements. A veterinarian told local media that theincisions \"are strange ones in which some sort of heating element appears to have beenused.\"The veterinarian is quoted as saying, \"The skin is burned along the edges of the cuts and(there is an) absence of blood in veins, muscles and ligaments. ...it is simply desiccated....It's as though you were cutting a piece of paper with a hot wire. The edges become dry,scorched and thinner. Furthermore, all traces of blood vanished. We only found somecoagulated remains in the heart.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Strange Green Dwarf Seen On June 6, 2002, Diario \"La Arena\" headlined \"Strange Dwarf Reported in Cattle MuteArea\" near General Acha. Scott Corrales translated that, \"The presence of a 'dwarf' or'green midget' wandering the backyards of many neighborhoods in General Acha has beenthe latest subject of conversation. It appears to be a short, green entity which runs awaywith haste when detected.\"All the La Pampa Province cattle mutilation events have been taking place only an hoursouth of the nation's capital, Buenos Aires.Interview: Scott Corrales, Director, Institute of Hispanic Ufology, Bradford, Pennsylvania:\"People may not realize that Argentina is the world's 5th largest country. Most of thepopulation is in the La Pampa Province of about 11 million people, southwest of BuenosAires. We're talking about some of the most fertile area in Latin America. In fact, most ofthe beef produced in Argentina is raised in this region. It's very well connected with roadsand railroads. These things are happening basically under peoples' noses. It's incredible! Today's report came from Santa Rosa which is a UFO hotspot in its own right. In fact, weposted a story to the internet only last month regarding a luminous cloud of some sortwhich some had identified as a UFO. There, we have that double combination of activity inArgentina, mutilations and UFOs, going back to the 1950s when we first started gettingwidespread UFO reports throughout South America. They always seemed to involveArgentina, Chile and Brazil. What is the highest strangeness case you have heard about since May 15th of this yearassociated with all of these animal mutilations? It would have to be the strange, green dwarf at the scene last week. I think it was in theGeneral Acha area as well. A resident of the La Oeste neighborhood in General Acha toldthe newspaper that this green dwarf which is nondescript, she couldn't make out any of thedetails, appeared twice on her property, once in the morning and once in the afternoon. Shehad no corroborating witnesses. By the time she called her husband who was sleepingindoors, he only could see a shadow vanishing up a tree. As the story hit the local news, more and more people came forward saying they, too, hadseen this green dwarf in their backyards. That ties into another area of high strangeness inArgentina over the past two years there have been reports of dwarfs, imps, goblins,whatever you want to call them, in different parts of Argentina in the north and south.Argentina Animal MutilationsAlso Reported in 1991Since the events began last month, first there was the odd mutilated cow. There had notbeen cattle mutilations reported since 1991 when the Victoria UFO wave occurred. Victoriais up by Uruguay. It attracted worldwide attention to the extent that the King of Spain senthis representative to look into the matter.Along with the UFO sightings, you started having cattle mutilations. They created quite abig stir back then, but the activity stopped much like Puerto Rico in 1996. After it wasextinguished, people soon forgot about it and life returned to normal.And now, we have twelve years later this reactivation of cattle mutilation. I think sinceFebruary or beginning of March, there were a number of chupacabras cases in Argentina.Remember all of the year 2000, it had been Chile. Chile had born the brunt of chupacabrasattacks to the total of almost 1500-1600 mutilated animals in both north and southernChile. And now, it was occurring on this side of the Andes Range. There were witnesses toa creature described as a gargoyle, but not the typical chupacabras description, but more ofa very large, gargoyle creature moving at incredible rates of speed.However, no one has seen any creatures with these mutilations. The only report we havethat is in the reports you have is of someone seeing a bright flash of light at the field whereone of the cows was mutilated prior to the mutilation taking place.Then again, Argentina is now in winter. There are a lot of storms. It could have been"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"lightning. Certainly, they invoked the lightning hypothesis, but it appears to not have takenhold. I think people know better that lightning cannot do the kind of damage that isreported in these cows. And now you have the participation of the University of La PampaSchool of Veterinarian Medicine and these vets would know much better not to be fooledby a lightning explanation.In one case a couple of days ago, I noticed there was a mention of the lungs being excisedand that really put the fear of God into the farmer.\"Website:Inexplicata: http://inexplicata.blogspot.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
