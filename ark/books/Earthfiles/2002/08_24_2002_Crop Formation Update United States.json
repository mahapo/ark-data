At one end of Dorbrook Park running along a forest of deciduous trees isa rye field rented by a farmer from the township. On August 15, Colt's Neckresidents reported a large crop formation in the rye.Front page aerial photograph in Asbury Park Press newspaper on Saturday, August 17,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2002.Aerial photograph by staff photographer Brian Ferreira © 2002 Asbury Park Press.In aerial photographs, the pattern appears green because there was a grassy floorbeneath the rye crop. The pattern of two concentric circles that have aprotruding section on opposite sides, all surrounding a long dumbbell is similarto patterns found in England in the early 1990s. The farmer reported that thedumbbell is 430 feet long and the rings with protruding sections are 230 feetwide.Front page aerial photograph in Asbury Park Press newspaper on Saturday, August 17,2002.Aerial photograph by staff photographer Brian Ferreira © 2002 Asbury Park Press.The Asbury Park Press began its August 17th front page article about theformation this way:\"Concentric circles carved into a field of rye grass in a county park inColts Neck are the result of a prank, possibly inspired by the recentlyreleased movie SIGNS, police and park authorities are convinced.But some teenage visitors to the crop circles aren't buying that theory.'I think aliens did it,' said Lyndsey Farrar, 15, of Colts Neck.\"The crop had been trampled on and everything had been mowed down aroundit, but the farmer had left enough to see some of the original lay and pattern. Ican say that the far southern end of the dumbbell had a complicated lay of fivesections of rye divided by four \"spines,\" each about 12 inches wide running thelength of the southern circle. Three of the spines ran east to west, but one ranwest to east. In between the spines, the rye had been laid neatly and nearlystraight north to south. The outer sections of the circle beyond the spines werelaid down clockwise. The northern circle did not have the complicated laypattern and swirled clockwise around a center. The rye in the long corridor wasquite jumbled, but it seemed some of the rye heads were originally flowing southto north and others north to south. I gathered plant and soil samples forbiophysicist W. C. Levengood to study. August 24, 2002 Teton, Idaho - At around 2 a.m. in the early hours ofSaturday, August 10, 2002, in the small farming community of Teton, Idaho,two men who do not know each other were seeing unusual light. One, inside,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"thought it was a full moon coming through his house windows. The other,outside, had never seen anything in the sky like it before. Jim Taylor, a JohnDeere tractor salesman, was outside his Rexburg home when he noticed a brightwhite-yellow light in the sky brighter than any other object and movingerratically.Teton, Idaho northeast of Idaho Falls. In the late 1980s about five miles north of Teton,both cattle mutilations and circles in crop were reported, but no one has ever seen abeautifulformation like the one discovered on August 10, 2002 by farm owner Bryon Parker. Interviews:Jim Taylor, Salesman, John Deere, Rexburg, Idaho: \"A lot of stars wereshining, but there was that particular light which did catch my eye. My firstthought was that it wasn't from around here. It definitely was different. Iwatched it for several minutes and it kind of faded in and faded out and movedaround strangely and then just disappeared. At that time, I figured it might havebeen an unidentified flying object.AND THE COLOR?Kind of a whitish yellow in color. That far away, it was kind of hard to tell.DID IT SEEM TO BE IN THE GENERAL AREA OF WHERE THE TETON,IDAHO FORMATION APPEARED?It was just right in the same area at the time.IF YOU WERE HOLDING OUT YOUR HAND RIGHT NOW AT AN ARM'SLENGTH DISTANCE AND YOU COMPARED THE END OF YOUR LITTLEFINGER OR THE END OF ANY OF YOUR FINGERS TO HOW BIG THATLIGHT WAS IN THE SKY AT 2 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING ON AUGUST9, WHAT WOULD THAT SIZE BE?About the size of my small fingernail.OK, THE SMALL FINGERNAIL. THAT IS NOTEWORTHY BECAUSE YOUCAN COVER A FULL MOON WITH THE END OF YOUR LITTLE FINGER.SO, WOULD THE LIGHT HAVE APPEARED THAT LARGE IN THE SKY?No, I wouldn't think that large, no.WAS IT THE QUALITY OF THE LIGHT THAT ATTRACTED YOU FIRST?It was the light, because it was brighter than anything else in the sky.DID THE LIGHT ITSELF SEEM TO CASTING DOWN ANY LIGHT IN ANYDIRECTION?No."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE MOVEMENT?Short movements. It would stop and go back and forth a little bit. The light wasdifferent intensities, back and forth. That's what caught my eye, that it was not asolid, steady light, but going back and forth in different intensities.SO, IT WOULD SORT OF FADE OUT AND THEN GET BRIGHTER?Ye a h .THIS LASTED FOR HOW MANY MINUTES?A couple of minutes.ONCE IT HAD GONE, DID IT FADE OUT OR POP OUT?Just faded. Quickly. It was gone very quick.DID YOU STAY WATCHING TO SEE IF IT WOULD COME BACK?I did not. I just kind of blew it off.NOW, WHY IT IS SO SIGNIFICANT IS THAT IN THAT 2 TO 3 A.M. TIMEPERIOD, ANOTHER TETON RESIDENT, DARRELL BRIGGS, WHO I'VEINTERVIEWED, HE HAD FALLEN ASLEEP IN FRONT OF HIS TV SETAND GOT UP AND KNEW IT WAS ABOUT 2 O'CLOCK OR A LITTLE BITAFTER AND HE WAS LOOKING AT WHAT HE SAID LOOKED LIKE VERYBRIGHT WHITE MOONLIGHT COMING THROUGH HIS BEDROOMWINDOW. Darrell Briggs, Granular Operator, Basic American Foods, Teton, Idaho:\"I fell asleep in my chair and got up to go to bed. When it's really moonlight outthere, a full moon, you know? I don't have to take and turn the lights on to seeto get to bed. And it was just like a full moon that night. And I was talking withmy mother about it. She said, 'Well, we didn't have a full moon last night.' And itwas like that.SO THAT IMPLIES THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING WITH BRIGHT LIGHTAROUND YOUR HOUSE?Yeah. See, there's an open field between me and where the cemetery was at andwhere the crop circles are at.IS THE CEMETERY RIGHT ALONG THE EDGE OF THE FIELD WHERETHE CROP FORMATION CAME?Yes, it's on the top of the hill there.YOUR BEDROOM IS HOW FAR FROM THE FORMATIONAPPROXIMATELY?My house is probably about a mile, maybe a half mile, something like that. I canlook out there and see the cemetery and all that. There are no obstructions inbetween except for the field.\" Formation Discovered August 10, 2002After sunup on Saturday, August 10, one of the Parker brothers whose familyhas farmed the land for three generations discovered the strange rings and circlesin the field below the hilltop cemetery that Darrell Briggs can see from hishouse. Mr. Parker immediately called his brother, Bryon Parker, who is Mayorof Teton. He is married to Connie Parker and has three daughters, Brenna, 17;Cassie, 14; and Jessica, 12."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Mayor Parker decided before he even went into the field that he would get intoan airplane and take aerials to document what he first thought was damage to hisfield. He was even thinking of taking legal action against vandals until he sawthe pattern. Then he landed and went inside the formation to see the wheat upclose for himself. What he saw amazed him.Aerial photographs taken early morning on August 9, 2002 by farm owner Bryon Parker ©2002.The formation was approximately 300 feet each way.Bryon Parker, Mayor, Teton, Idaho, and farm owner of Teton wheat fieldin which August 10, 2002 formation appeared: \"We walked into the center ofthe circles and it was a beautiful job. There is no doubt about that. When wewalked back out and turned around, ours were the only footsteps we could seein there. I mean, it was just obvious.The center of the circles that were all laid down, there was about a two to threefoot circle in the center of them just woven together. Some of it was woven inand out four, five and six times, but not a broken stalks in any of it."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Sections of wheat were laid over and under each otherlike a loose braid at the center of the five flattened circles. After a few days,the Parkers found that all the woven sections had been pulled out bythe roots by visitors to the formation. Photograph © 2002 by Patricia Hill.DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING ELSE UNUSUAL IN THE WAY THE CROPSWERE LAID DOWN BESIDES THE WEAVING?When we first looked at it, the laid down stuff was I mean, it was just perfect.There was nothing, no leaning stalks. They were either laid down or standingstraight up. It was just a perfect straight wall of grain stalks all the way aroundthe circles. There was no leaning. They were either straight up, or flat.VERY PRECISE.Very precise. That just caught my eye because it was such a definite line. All thenorth south circles and rings was going in a counter-clockwise direction. Andthe two on the east and the two on the west were going in a clockwise direction.And they are true magnetic north, from the smallest circles on each end. Linethem up, they are exactly magnetic north direction.SO EVERYTHING IN THAT NORTH/ SOUTH AXIS IS ALLCOUNTERCLOCKWISE?Ye s .WHEN I COME OUT TO THE EAST AND WEST.Them are all clockwise.SO, THEY ARE THE ONLY PIECES OF THIS FORMATION THAT WERECLOCKWISE.Exactly. I don't know why or what. Over the years, we have seen this on TV justlike everybody else. I was a skeptic, I'll tell you right up front. I thought,'Somebody has been messing in my grain field.' But after I went down there, Idon't think so."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Sprinkler pipe was not effected by the wheat that laid smoothly over it.Photograph © 2002 by Patricia Hill.There is a line of sprinkler pipe laying right through I guess it lays right along theedge of the main circle and the bigger ring goes across it twice. A sprinklerirrigation pipe, do you know what I'm talking about?SURE.The grain was just laid across that so pretty, not a broken stalk, not a mashedhead of wheat. One of the risers off the pipe was right out in the ring and thegrain had laid right around it. I mean, not a disturbed spear of grain. It was justlaid around that pipe like it was part of it.LIKE IT WAS MELTED OVER IT, OR SOMETHING?No. It wasn't kinked over it. It wasn't mashed. It was just laid across it just like ablanket. It was just pretty.VERY GENTLE.Very. That's another thing I thought was weird. Once we got down and lookingat it, none of the straw is kinked. It's just laid over and looks like it grew thatway. It's laid over right from the ground.NO CRACKS, NO...Nothing.THAT IS THE CHARACTERISTIC OF WHAT WE CALL THE TRULY FLUIDWATER-LIKE FORMATIONS WHERE THERE ARE NO CRACKSANYWHERE IN THE STEMS.Yeah, if somebody had walked out there and done it, you would have found allof the straw broken. But it just wasn't. I don't know.AND IF IT ISN'T PEOPLE, WHAT COULD IT BE?Boy, I wish somebody would tell me. I've had that question asked me a thousandtimes.YOU AND YOUR FAMILY BEFORE, DURING OR AFTER THAT TIME OFTHE FORMATION, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THESKY?No.\" Translucent Orbs Above The FormationBut Bryon and Connie Parker's three daughters saw what they called \"orbs\"above the formation, both in daylight and at night. Several people saw orbswhen the flash bulbs went off on their cameras, but Cassie said she could see theorbs move with her naked eye."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Bryon Parker with two of his teenage daughers on left and Heather Johnson, researcher,inside the Teton, Idaho wheat formation on the Parker farm.

It was kind of freaky at first. Then afterawhile, I kind of thought they were kind of cool.DID YOU OR ANYBODY YOU KNOW OUTSIDE OF THESE ORBS, SEEANY UNUSUAL LIGHTS IN THE SKY?Me and my dad and a couple of others seen an orange light above a shop thathas no electricity at all. It was an orange light that was moving.THAT'S THE SHED THAT A MR. ALAN MEYER, HE HAD A VIDEOTAPECAMERA AND HE VIDEOTAPED THAT LIGHT.Ye s .IT WAS VERY ORANGE COLOR.Ye s .WOULD IT BE THE ORANGE OF A PUMPKIN?Ye s .HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WAS OUT THERE ON THE SHED?We seen it for about a half hour.IN THAT HALF HOUR DID YOU WITH YOUR EYES EVER SEE IT MOVE?Yeah. I seen it move a couple of times.WHEN IT MOVED, DID IT MOVE SIDEWAYS OR UP AND DOWN?It moved sideways and backwards."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"SIDEWAYS AND BACKWARDS. DID IT CHANGE SIZE OR INTENSITY OFLIGHT?Nope.WHEN IT WENT AWAY, WHAT HAPPENED?Nothing really.DID IT FADE OUT OR POP OUT OR?It just kind of faded a little bit.WHAT DID YOU THINK IT WAS?I don't know.\" Alan Meyer, Ph.D., Writing Teacher, Bonneville High School, Ogden,Utah: \"When we finished our investigation around midnight on the night ofAugust 14, all of us there felt a very strong and eerie presence, in fact. Themystery light we saw appear about the machine shed at the edge of the field hada very haunting quality. We felt very much as if we were being watched theentire time. But particularly as we left the field, a sense of some sort of eyesupon us. It was a very strong feeling for everyone.WHAT HAPPENED AT THE SHED?The farmer, Mr. Parker, was giving us a tour of the property. I was showing himthe pictures we had just taken that showed orbs appearing on the LCD screen onthe back of the camera. We were also shooting infrared Nightshot video at thesame time. It was quite amusing, he (Mr. Parker) turned to me and said,'Do you see my machine shop over there?'I said, 'Yes.'He said, 'See that light above it?'I said, 'Yes, I see that electrical yard light.'He said, 'There is no light above the machine shop.'I got a little chill and said, 'What?'He said, 'There's no light there.'But clearly we could see a light about the size and brightness of a street lampabove the center of the roof of the machine shop.Digital NightShot video frames of the light moving along the machineshop roof on the night of August 14, 2002, four days after the formation appearedon the Bryon Parker farm in Teton, Idaho. Video frames © 2002 by Alan Meyer.I focused on that with my NightShot camera and taped several minutes of it. It"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"moved very slowly along the roof line of the shed and went down the side to thepoint where it went behind the shed. We had to move around through the fieldbelow the formation to continue taping the light.It stayed on the side moving very slowly for a minute or two and finallydisappeared.\" A visitor to the formation soon after it was publicly reported was Dr. PatriciaHill, a psychologist from Aspen, Colorado, who happened to be in Idaho at thetime. She has visited formations in England and drove to the Parker's farm to seethe Teton pattern. She was so impressed she talked to Bryon Parker about howspecial the formation was and urged him not to harvest it, which was his intentat the time. After Patricia reinforced that the cross hatching at the center of thefive circles and the fluid lay of the wheat over the water pipe were unusual,Bryon decided to cut around the formation when he harvested on August 19 andhas left it for visitors to see for another week or two.Bryon Parker on far right with his family; Teton formation in their wheat field behind them.Photograph © 2002 by Patricia Hill.We b s it e s : http://alanmeyer.com http://drpatriciahill.com Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
