Right jaw stripped of flesh on Argentina mutilated cow.Udder excised from another mutilated Argentina cow. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Yet, mutilations continued. This past week, Scott Corrales who does Spanishtranslations of Argentina media reports forwarded to me the following e-mailfrom Christian Quintero of the Proyecto Condor-CEUFO organization:\"Despite the fact that the news media's silence could be interpreted as meaningthat the mutilation epidemic has ceased, the inhabitants of southern BuenosAires Province and La Pampa are still reporting new cases. The problem is thatthe police no longer appear interested in accepting new reports, and animalowners have therefore stopped informing the authorities. In addition to this, a TV show on hunting called El Escape del Cabure,broadcast on the MAGAZINE cable channel, has shown images of new cases.While the program's hosts and their guide roamed through a hunting preserve inthe province of La Pampa, they found a wild boar with the same signs ofmutilation seen in other cases which became known to the public. The animalwas found in a section of the remote Calden wilderness and showed a smallorifice on the back of its neck through which its brain had apparently beenextracted. When the show's host asked the guide about the matter, the man replied thatalmost a year ago (long before the first bovine mutilation cases appeared), it waspossible to find dead animals with these characteristics which had never beenseen before in the region.\" Further, on August 22, veterinarian pathologist findings in a bull mutilation nearRio Cuarto in Cordoba Province north of La Pampa were summed up this way:\"Knowledgeable sources say that in spite of the best efforts made in the agenciesof the School of Agronomy and Veterinary Medicine of the National Universityof Rio Cuarto, the case involving the dead male bovine mutilated in the vicinityof Berrotaran, 75 kilometers north of Rio Cuarto on Route 36, has yet to besolved. The necropsy highlights are:- The bull had subcutaneous lesions in its thorax and ribs.- Had lesions around the extracted eye as though a device had been rested on it.- Its rumen was empty of corn chaff food from the feed lot in which the animalwas discovered.- The internal organs had been cut out, apparently through a hole cut in therectum with the same cutting tool.- There was no blood in the heart. The animal did not die from a heart attack orfrom electric shock.\" One man in Jacinto Arauz an hour northwest of Bahia Blanca recently saw astrange, round aerial object that glowed green in the daylight as it came as closeas three to four feet from him. The man said he felt some kind of force emittedfrom the aerial object that knocked him to the ground. Then he watched his cellphone rise from his body and up into the green object which took off anddisappeared. Interview: Scott Corrales, Director, Institute of Hispanic Ufology, Bradford,Pennsylvania: \"What makes this even doubly strange and much moreinteresting is the fact that the sheriff of the town of Jacinto Arauz kept placingphone calls to the missing cell phone and he said they kept answering, but noone was there. I could hear air or space after some one picked up the phone.However, when they tried to triangulate through the phone company, they weretold it was simply out of the area.That phone was never returned?No, never returned. The news story says that the police placed phone calls onthe same night as the incident. On two tries, the cell phone would ring and thencut off and on the third attempt, a sort of breathing could be heard. They they"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"heard the sound of a keypad being dialed. Subsequent efforts indicated the cellphone was either off or beyond the coverage area.So, perhaps it was in another dimension, another planet, we don't know. We'llprobably never see that phone again.Did the man describe the size of the craft that came down only a meter orso from him?He was very spartan with his description. It just said, 'a dim green-coloredcircumference with 3 legs barely a meter or meter and half away from him.'What reached out and got his cell phone?It seemed to have been magnetism of some sort. What he described as 'electricalcharge' dropped him to the ground. He was toppled and paralyzed and unable todo anything. However, this man was carrying a number of things on him. He hada pair of binoculars. He had a cell phone in his left hand and told thenewspaper: 'I had a cell phone in my left hand. It was sucked up by the greencircle. I saw it rising and disappear.'When he was asked by a reporter to describe the object, he said: 'Given that Icould only see the bottom part, I can tell you it was a smooth surface with threelegs. At no time did it make contact with the ground. I don't know how manyminutes I was there because I lost all notion of time.' He saw no figures in thecraft and all he saw was the cell phone rising out of his left hand and beingabsorbed by the green circumference. He was left with his binoculars and I thinkhe carried a firearm.It took him a long time to just get himself back into his car. He returned homeunable to speak. He had to write a note to his wife explaining what hadhappened. He was again taken to the hospital. He said, 'The ring and middlefingers of the hand in which I held the cell phone still hurt. My jaws, shoulderand legs also hurt. I always wanted to see something like that (meaning a UFOphenomenon). But nothing like this had ever happened to me before.'\"We b s it e s :http://www.inexplicata.com (Journal for Spanish Ufology)Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
