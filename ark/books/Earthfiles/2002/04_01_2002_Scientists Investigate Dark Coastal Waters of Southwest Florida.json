Satellite image courtesy NASA. April 1, 2002 Marathon, Florida - Fishermen who have spent their livescatching marine life in the waters between Naples and the Florida Keys begancalling news media in January to report massive areas of water so dark and denseit was eerie and many said they had never seen anything like it before. By themiddle of March, NASA satellite images clearly showed dark waters that at onepoint spanned an estimated 100 miles. Fishermen also noted that dead plantsfrom the ocean floor seemed to rise up and follow the movement of the darkwater through Florida Bay and the Keys. Fish seemed to turn away from thedark currents and eventually scientists discovered that coral and sponges haddied or were dying in certain channels where the dark waters had been.This past week on March 28, members of the scientific community met at theFlorida Marine Research Institute in St. Petersburg to review data from somewater samples. Their consensus was that the \"discolored water is most likely dueto a non-red-tide algal bloom of coastal marine origin. ...the presence of a largeamount of algae in the water can potentially cause problems for bottomorganisms as the bloom decays.\" Into at least mid-April, divers will be goingback down into the dark waters to take further samples. The discolored area isstill observable in a region about thirty miles by ten miles.After the meeting, I interviewed Dr. Brian Keller, Science Coordinator for theFlorida Keys National Marine Sanctuary in Marathon, Florida. The sanctuary isfunded by NOAA. Even though no single organism has been identified as thecause of the massive dark waters, he has a theory that the organism responsibleis a species of diatom which is a microscopic type of algae that give off agold-brown color. First, I asked Dr. Keller about the fishermen's first reports."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Fishermen between January and March 2002 were reporting black-brown water in whichnothingseemed to be alive in an area about 9 miles offshore from south of Everglades City to northof Cape Sable.Eventually the dark water phenomenon spread into Florida Bay and the Florida Keys.Silicate runoff fromthe Shark River out into Ponce de Leon and Whitewater Bays is associated with diatomblooms.Red arrow points to Shark River where phosphorous and silicatelevels can spike periodically due to pesticide and fertilizer runoffs. Diatoms that thriveon such chemicals can then have a dramatic population explosion. Some scientistssuspect such conditions have provoked the dark waters. Interview:Brian Keller, Ph.D., Science Coordinator, Florida Keys National MarineSanctuary, Marathon, Florida: \"The observations that were coming in fromcommercial fishermen were water conditions unlike anything that they had everseen in their time on the water. Dark appearing water, no sheen characteristic ofan oil spill, no strong aroma that would be characteristic of red tide; at nightboat propellers caused phosphorescence. There were sightings of large numbersof comb jellies (jellyfish) in the water that can cause phosphorescence, as wellas some of the type of phytoplankton can cause phosphorescence at night. Theysaid they were seeing something like they had never seen before, a dark mass ofwater that fishes appeared to be avoiding and the fishes in the water appeared tobe behaving unusually. They talked about stringy masses in the water columns.That could have been a type of bacteria that can form stirringly-looking growthforms in the water columns."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Technicians from the Mote Marine Laboratory in Summerlin Key andFlorida Marine Research Institute in St. Petersburg gathered several samplesof the dark water in March for analyses. Photograph © 2002 by Romain Blanquart, NaplesDaily News.They collected water samples that have been sent to the Florida MarineResearch Institute for analysis. Some of those samples have fairly large numbersof diatoms in them. There was very little indication of red tide in those samples.More recent samples collected by the Mote Marine Laboratory just north of anarea called Sugar Loaf, many of those samples had medium to highconcentrations of a particular type of diatom. So, our thinking is that this may bea particularly massive and persistent bloom of algae.Why blackness and why such an unprecedented appearance to thefishermen?Well, the blackness is apparent only in satellite imagery. People on the water inwhat appears to be black in the satellite imagery appears a brownish,greenish-brown at the water's surface. So, we have some kind of a disconnectbetween the satellite imagery and the actual appearance of the water which ismore of a dark color, not black to the eye, up close.In terms of why it is so large, we can only speculate about that because thesetypes of bloom happen in that region of western outer Florida Bay and thesouthwest Florida shelf pretty much every year. They are associated withsilicates that come out from Shark River flue which is an outflow from theEverglades in that southwest region of Florida.Diatoms require silicate in order to grow and reproduce. They also get a pulse ofnitrogen. What's unusual is the size and persistence and we can only speculatethat there was more than the usual influx of nutrients that fed this bloom andenabled it to grow to such a massive size and to last as long as it has.Those nutrients would fall into the category largely of fertilizers andpesticides?Well, these actually come out of the system naturally. Part of the geology in thatpart of Florida we have a shift from sediments, the normal types of sands that aresilicate sands into Florida Bay which is all carbonate sand. And so the SharkRiver outfall can bring with it naturally occurring silicate. The agriculture areasare a long distance away from that part of Florida and pass through a lot ofwetlands vegetation. And studies in the Everglades indicate that the agriculturalnutrients pretty rapidly get taken up by the wetlands vegetation in what arecalled water conservation areas. And so, it's unlikely that agricultural nutrientsare going all the way across to the southwest coast of Florida.So, you would say right now as an educated guess that whatever fed thisdiatom bloom was some natural relationship between the silicate and theot6her kind of sandy floor in those two waters?That's correct. And we've had a very wet what would normally be our dry season"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"from November until about April - we've had a very wet dry season that mightbe linked with what could be a forthcoming El Nino event. And that couldexplain why more than the usual outflow came from Shark River bringing thesenutrients to feed this diatom bloom, but that's just a guess.Is it definite that it is the diatoms that are causing the blackness from thesatellites, or could there be something else there mixed with the diatoms?Again, looking at the water up close, it does not appear black. But what canhappen in these blooms is there can be shifts in the types of algae that dominatethe blooms, so that one type of algae will bloom and then die off and providenutrients that feed yet another bloom. And that might have been the sequence inthis case.Now, the Pfiesteria phenomenon that is usually linked to estuaries alongthe East Coast when it is in the blooming dinoflagellate amoebae stage -any possible connection between Pfiesteria and what is happening?I don't see any connection and we've been able to have scientists analyze thecomposition of the plankton and they are able to identify different groups anddifferent species and there's no indication of any Pfiesteria. It's never beenobserved in this part of the country and it's not being observed in this case.There were some indications of low concentrations of red tide typedinoflagellates. It's not unusual to have a mix of several different species in thesetypes of algae blooms, although something like a diatom may dominate, itdoesn't mean that every other type of algae is excluded.So, it's not unusual to see a mix. But in this region, when I think of black water,I think of water that has been discolored by the tannins that have been releasedby decaying vegetation from mangroves and terrestrial leaves and vegetation likethat which can impart a truly blackish appearance to water because of thosedissolved compounds from the tannins. Since people on the water do not seeblackness, I can't explain why the satellite imagery appears black. High \"Chlorophyll A\" Concentrations in January 2002In early January, Florida International University conducted one of its four timesa year surveys through the sanctuary waters out into the southwest Florida shelfand they saw a low salinity between the 10th and 13th of January, right in thearea of the mouth of the Shark River that supports the notion of an outflow atthat time. They saw an area of concentration of chlorophyll A which is aphotosynthetic pigment utilized by these algae and they saw the highestconcentrations of chlorophyll A that they've ever measured in these waters since1995. They also saw a very high concentration of oxygen which also supportsthe idea that this was a dense bloom of algae that generate large amounts ofoxygen when they are photosynthesizing during the day time. This was definitelynot a dead zone. This was a very full of life zone at that time. And now twomonths later in March, we are seeing signs down in the sanctuary that we havelarge numbers of diatoms and we are seeing dead diatoms, the dead skeletalmaterial they leave behind. So, it appears that the bloom is starting to age anddissipate."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Rope sponges in the Northwest Channel off Key West have been dyingin large numbers since the dark water moved through, according to local Keys divers.Photo © 2002 by Ken Nedimyer, Naples Daily News.Slow-growing brain corals were damaged most in the wake of the dark water.According to marine scientists, this one in the Northwest Channel off the Keyshad been dead for a week after the dark water moved through the channel.Photo © 2002 by Ken Nedimyer, Naples Daily News. Sponge and Coral Die OffsThere were reports that sponges and corals in a channel off of Key Westwere found dead at the height of the fishermen reporting the dark water.Any truth?That's correct. Those observations were made about a week ago by a veryexperienced diver who is an excellent natural history observer and we havescientists from Mote Marine Lab who are going to that same site today to collecttissue samples for analysis, get some photographs and some video of what thecommunity looks like and possibly get some more quantitative data on what'shappening there.If the answer to all of this dark water is a diatom, why would a diatomwhich is a plant have the ability to kill sponges and corals?We're not sure there is that linkage. We're not sure whether it's somethingassociated with the bloom other than the diatom that is causing this effect. Wehad a massive sponge die off in the Florida Bay in the early 1990s that wasassociated with a different kind of algae bloom, with a cyano-bacterial bloom.And there can be a combination of toxic effects. A lot of these microscopicplants carry nasty chemicals to try to prevent animals from eating them. Therecan also be physical clogging of filter feeders by huge quantities of thesemicroscopic particles that will clog up the filtering apparatus of things likesponges. So, we're not sure what is causing the die offs that we have seen nearKey West associated with this bloom. And we're hoping that the tissue samplesthat are being collected today and probably more in the future will give us someinsight as to what caused those die offs.What have you learned since Friday, March 29?Researchers from Mote Marine Lab went to an area just northwest of Key Westwhere there were reports from a week earlier of sponge die offs, corals eitherdying or dying off.How wide spread was the coral and sponge die off?We're not sure about that. Because of the mixed reports of what appeared to beserious die offs in some areas, but not the case in areas not too far away. That'swhy we need to have some more intensive and quantitative surveys.But would you say quite a large number of corals and sponges, based onthe data you know as of April 1?I can't say that based on what I've heard. And we still don't have any quantitative"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"data. We just have reliable observations of dead and dying sponges and somedead and dying corals, but we don't yet have a good idea of the spatial extent ofthat.If their deaths were linked to this microscopic diatom, what would there beabout the presence of a diatom that would kill off sponges and corals?Well, I'm not sure it would be the diatom. It could be some other components ofthe bloom. There are some types of phytoplankton that have some toxicchemical compounds in them. There is also the possibility of at least for thesponges of a simple physical clogging of their filter apparatus. In the case ofcorals, the really dark water would block sunlight that they need to help withtheir growth and condition.On Friday, oxygen measurements were made and even at that time theconcentrations of oxygen were very high. And so we're not yet seeing any signs.But we're concerned about it and we're going to keep watching it and we haveanother extensive water quality cruise that's scheduled to start on the 15th ofApril and that should give us a good map of water quality conditions throughoutthe region at the surface and at the bottom of a large number of nutrients andwater quality parameters. And the Mote Lab scientists were reporting whatmight be a very particularly microscopic form of phytoplankton as part of thebloom - what's called picoplankton. They are very miniscule type of algae.In this microscopic algae, is it something that is rare and coult it becontributing to the low visibility in the water and problems in the coral andsponges?It could be a contributor and we're looking forward to getting the full analysesof the water samples that were taken on Friday so we can know more about thecomposition of algae in the blooms, their concentrations in the water columnsand information like that.How much of the dark discoloration is still being seen in the waters as ofApril 1, 2002?We had another vessel from NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic andMeteorological Laboratory in the vicinity of the bloom on Friday and it did acruise track along what is called the back country which would be the northernedge of the Keys that are characterized by a lot of shallow water areas. And theysaw these bloom conditions from an island known as Big Pine west to Key Westand that would cover a distance of approximately 30 miles. And they estimatedit extended 10 miles to the north, this very brownish-green water.So, it's still covering a very large area?That's correct. The underwater visibility is typically less than 2 feet in this kindof pea-soup appearing water. The divers I have spoken to have experienced noadverse affects other than the limited visibility in the water. Again, there areareas where the bottom community appeared healthy and OK, despite beingimmersed in what appears to be very concentrated plankton bloom.It's that density that is so puzzling to everybody at this point?Yes. But what comes out of the Shark River and what is unique for the diatomsis the silicate that can come out of those waters. It is natural. It is silicate thatcomes into a system where the sediments are dominated by carbonate sedimentsrather than silicate-based sediments. And so, it provides nutrients that areotherwise lacking for diatoms.What you mean is that on a cyclic winter to spring basis, you can suddenlyhave an influx coming out of the Shark River into the southern waters thatcontains a lot of phosphorous and silicate and whatever diatoms are therein a carbonate-based mud will thrive suddenly on the new influx ofphosphorous and silicate?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Yes, and when we look at the data gathered in that area in January andFebruary, they show a plume of low salinity water coming out of the vicinity ofthe mouth of the Shark River. And this was a month apart. And we had arelatively very wet winter which is characteristic for this region in anticipation ofan El Nino event. And we are getting early warning signs from the Pacific thatanother El Nino is developing. So, we've had a wet winter that would tend tosend more of this silicate-laden water out of the Everglades and out onto thesouthwest Florida shelf which is consistent with a model of how diatoms occurin that region.What is it about a bloom of something like a plant that naturally exists inthe ocean that can become so dense that it can cause destruction of coraland sponges and what makes that become a potential threat in the future?A general issue in that regard for any such phenomenon is how much is due tohuman-related causes and how much is truly natural. And in this particularbloom, I'm not sure we're going to be able to develop a good answer for that.Perhaps we'll never know.\" More Information:Lab Analyses As of April 1, 2002Beverly Roberts, Research Administrator, Florida Fish and WildlifeConservation Commission, Florida Marine Research Institute, St.Petersburg, Florida:How many samples of dark water have you analyzed in your lab so far?\"It looks like we may have had over 30 samples. Some of those are clumpedfairly close together and that's over a period of time from March 8 to March 30.Of those, what seems to be the most dominant organism, plant orotherwise, that you've found?There isn't one (dominant).There isn't a single dominant one?Not really. That's what I'm saying about our samples are giving us quite variedresults in terms of phytoplankton. Samples collected from March 28 through the30th in areas just north of the Keys indicate that a Florida red tide organism,Karenia brevis, is still present and in apparently a very patchy distributionthrough all that area. We have observations that the discoloration and actualtextural variations along the surface are quite different within just a few nauticalmiles of one position and another recorded position. And we may not have goodresolution of what is causing this discoloration at this time certainly andpossibly for some time to come.What about the issue of a diatom being present?Diatoms are still being observed in the samples that are coming in, not the samespecies in all occasions and not always the dominant species. Diatoms are atypical component along the west Florida shelf, so it's not surprising to findthem. I'm certain they are part of the overall event that is being observed insouthwest Florida.But it is still not clear what produced the mass of darkness that has beenobserved since January?Yes, it's uncertain what the major component of the discoloration is that hasbeen reported since January. Our sampling at this point seems to indicate thatthere may be various causes involved with the entire area.\""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" More Information:Official Summary of Conclusions from March 28, 2002scientific investigators' review of recently compiled data and observations:\"The combination of satellite imagery, nutrient data, and organicmatter signatures seem to indicate that, as of 03/19/02, the'blackwater' is an event of marine and biological origin.Characterization of the area of water mass as a dead zone is notaccurate because living organisms of various plant and animal groupsare still present, but conditions on the bottom deserve further study.This colored water is not related to the hypoxia (abnormally lowlevels of oxygen) found in the northern Gulf. Although hypoxia onthe bottom as a result of decomposition of organic matter is always aconcern with algal blooms (especially at night), none of the samplingin south Florida coastal waters has indicated that this is an issue todate.\"In the samples collected on 03/19/02, nutrient levels were nothigher than those previously found on the West Florida Shelf,phytoplankton composition was similar to other coastal samples, andthe Colored Dissolved Organic Matter was characterized as coastalmarine in origin (but more samples are needed to confirm this). Thesalinity of the sample, 35.8-36.2, was consistent with coastal watersof south Florida, and the event may have been associated with adecaying coastal bloom(s).\"Future sampling may help determine the initial cause of thediscoloration event. Investigators' discussion included determiningwhat samples could be collected in the future and what otherhistorical data could be examined to aid the investigators onidentification of the factors responsible for the discolored waterevent.\" Historic References to Other Dark Waters In Same Florida Region:Brian Keller, Ph.D.: \"There were earlier observations of dark water events. Onein the mid 1950s from the crew of a boat that goes out by Tortugas NationalPark on a regular basis. It's a supply boat and the crew noted in the logsometime in the mid-1950s very unusual mass of dark water between Key Westand the Dry Tortugas. And there was an earlier report in 1898, scientists, therewas a marine lab in the Dry Tortugas at that time and they reported a dark waterevent.But we don't have enough to go on to be able to say that those earlier eventswere also diatom blooms. But it certainly is a possibility. Thinking ecologicallyon the long term, it would make sense that the sort of thing - and we've seen, forexample, red tides back in the 19th Century - algae blooms have likely occurredthroughout all of history from natural events. This appears to be probably anextraordinarily large and persistent bloom for this area.\" We b s it e s :http://seawifs.gsfc.nasa.gov/seawifs.html http://www.floridamarine.orgCredits"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
