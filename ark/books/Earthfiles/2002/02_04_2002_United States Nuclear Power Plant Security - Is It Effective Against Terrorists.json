S. nuclear power plantswith car or truck bombs, boats or aircraft.\"- Seth Borenstein, The Philadelphia Inquirer, January 31, 2002103 nuclear power plants in the states colored purple above supply about twenty percentof the electricity used in the United States. Some states have only one reactor. Others suchasPennsylvania have nine reactors, including Three Mile Island which is near theHarrisburg International Airport. Graphic © 2001 by the Nuclear Energy Institute.February 4, 2002 Middletown, Pennsylvania - President George Bush said inhis January 29, 2002 State of the Union speech that \"diagrams of Americannuclear power plants\" were found among terrorist manuals and other artifactsleft by terrorists in Afghanistan. Earlier on January 16, the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation (FBI) had issued an alert that a terrorist attack on a nuclear powerplant could be imminent.After the State of the Union address, the President of the Nuclear ControlInstitute, Paul Leventhal, said, \"Unfortunately, neither the White House nor theNuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) have taken protective measurescommensurate with the threat or with the unthinkable consequences of asuccessful attack on one of these nuclear plants. These plants are vulnerabletoday, and that is intolerable.\"The Nuclear Regulatory Commission keeps saying that security at plants hasbeen strengthened and is satisfactory to cope with terrorist threats in this time ofwar. But a man who lives near Three Mile Island in Harrisburg, Pennsylvaniahas worked as a concerned citizen since 1984 to monitor the plant after itspartial core melt down spread radioactivity into the environment in 1979. Hesays security today is still not what it should be and he's got the photographs toprove it."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Scott Portzline has researched the issue of sabotage and terrorism of the nation'snuclear power plants for nearly two decades. For eight years he helped thevolunteer civilian Three Mile Island Alert group monitor radiation and security.He has testified before the U. S. Senate, the U. S. Nuclear RegulatoryCommission, the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safeguards and before othergovernmental bodies in an effort to close security gaps that he has found. Hisresearch has been cited by the U. S. Department of Energy and various militarybranches. Portzline also maintains a data base of lost and stolen radioactivematerials in the United States.Over the past week of heightened alerts, he has visited the Three Mile Islandnuclear power reactor site and found that the gates have not been closed andguards slow to respond, even when he was there videotaping on January 31st asa pickup truck arrived and stopped voluntarily next to an empty guard house.Interview:Scott Portzline, Former Security Chairman for Three Mile Island Alert(TMIA), Harrisburg, Pennsylvania:\"I went to the north entrance of Three Mile Island, which is the main entrance,and observed nobody at the immediate entrance. There was a guard shack whichwas empty. A pick-up drives up to the entrance and slows down and voluntarilystops. Of course, if this had been an intruder who had malevolent intent, hecould easily have driven across the bridge and on to the island and then into theparking lot."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Sequence of six video frames taped by Scott Portzline on January 31, 2002beginning at 4:13 p.m. when a pickup truck drove into the main north entrance of ThreeMile Islandand stopped voluntarily. There was no guard in the guard house and both the horizontalgate and the blackand white striped lift gate were open. Video frames © 2002 by Scott Portzline.BOTH THE METAL HORIZONTAL GATE AND THE INTERIOR LIFTGATE WERE WIDE OPEN?Yes. The vehicle barriers at Three Mile Island have been open now for the lasttwo and a half months each time that I've been there. They need to close thevehicle barriers at the nuclear plants right now. And only open them when theyare sure that a vehicle is properly cleared to go in to the plant. They are doingsome bomb checks. And sometimes I've observed some very thorough bombchecks where they enter cargo vans and look around and it takes ten to fifteenminutes. And they use the mirrors under the vehicles. But I don't see that for allthe cargo vans, even, that go in.DON'T OPEN GATES SEEM PECULIAR AT A TIME WHEN WE'VEHAD FBI ALERTS CONCERNING POSSIBLE TERRORIST ATTACKSON NUCLEAR PLANTS?It's definitely not everything they can do. We hear from government officials thateveryone is doing as much as they can do. Well, no they are not. They shouldclose those vehicle barriers. And it makes no sense to have them open. Whatwould happen if Al-Qaeda drives a van with 15 commandos through that frontentrance because the vehicle barriers are open and there's nothing to slow themdown?WHY SINCE SEPTEMBER 11TH ANY GATES WOULD BE LEFTOPEN?The only thing I can think is that the Nuclear Regulatory Commission isconsidering here is that they are protecting against smaller truck bombs. So, theydon't seem to be considering delivering commandos through the entrance. If youprotect against a small truck bomb rather than a large truck bomb, then you stilldon't have to control access to the plant until you get closer to the protectedarea of the plant which is the middle of three security zones. The inside zone iscalled the Vital Area; the middle zone is called the Protected Area; and theoutside perimeter is the Owner Controlled area.But in 1984, the Sandia National Laboratory found that a large truck bomb froma large set-back distance greater than the protected area for most plants couldcause unacceptable damage leading to a meltdown or a radioactive release.\"Gordon Johndroe, White House Office of Homeland Security, DeputyPress Secretary, Washington, D. C. :\"FOR EACH OF THE 103 NUCLEAR REACTORS IN THE 62GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES, IS THERE ANORDER, A STANDING ORDER, NOT A REQUEST, BUT A STANDINGORDER THAT THERE BE A SECURITY GUARD AT THEENTRANCES OF ALL NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS IN THE UNITEDSTATES?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The Nuclear Regulatory Commission has standards for security at its licensingfacilities that were in place before September 11 and we continue to evaluatethose and provide additional funding to the commission in order to betterprotect our nuclear facilities.BUT ARE YOU SAYING THAT THERE IS NO REGULATION FORTHERE TO BE A GUARD AT EVERY ONE OF THE NUCLEARPOWER PLANTS?I would have to take a look at the guidelines. All of our nuclear facilities areguarded. I don't know where it says they specifically have to stand per yourquestion standing at the front gate. But there are requirements that the facilitieshave security.THE QUESTION HAS COME UP BECAUSE THE THREE MILE ISLANDALERT GROUP, SCOTT PORTZLINE, SPECIFICALLY ON JANUARY 31STAFTER THE FBI ALERT, AFTER THE PRESIDENT'S STATE OF THEUNION SPEECH TALKING ABOUT TERRORIST THREATS TO NUCLEARPOWER PLANTS IN THE UNITED STATES, HE WENT TO THREE MILEISLAND WITH A VIDEOTAPE CAMERA, JUST STOOD OUTSIDE ANDVIDEOTAPED. A PICKUP TRUCK, THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE GUARDSHACK. THE TRUCK STOPPED VOLUNTARILY. THE TRUCK COULDHAVE GONE ON THROUGH. THE TRUCK STAYED THERE AT THEGUARD SHACK VOLUNTARILY WAITING FOR A GUARD TO COME.THAT WAS JANUARY 31ST.There are security measures. There are security measures in place at all of ournuclear facilities. Some can be seen. Some cannot be seen. But our facilities arebeing protected by a variety of means.But what I think what is important that while the President said that we foundAl-Qaeda was gathering information on various facilities and landmarks in thiscountry and around the world, we have no specific information as to a time, dateor location, nor do we have any corroborating information indicating that theywere doing anything more dangerous than just gathering information. So, theFBI and Nuclear Regulatory Commission have issued alerts. The FBI has tolocal law enforcement and the NRC to their facilities to be on alert to anysuspicious activities around their facilities. And if we do gather any informationthat is specific to time or date or location, all appropriate measures andprecautions will be taken.COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN WHY WE DON'T HAVE 'NO FLY'ZONE RESTRICTIONS OVER ALL OF THE NUCLEAR POWERPLANTS IN THE UNITED STATES?There are other security precautions that are in place to help protect our nuclearfacilities. Those include strengthening our overall aviation security. There areother means that are in place to make sure all the necessary precautions aretaken around our nuclear facilities. And if No Fly Zones are determined to bethe best way to protect nuclear facilities at any given time, then whereappropriate they will be instituted. But No Fly Zones have a significanteconomic impact on the region and on the economy and on the airlines. Andthat is why other precautions are taken before needing to go to a No Fly Zone.RIGHT NOW, DOES DIRECTOR TOM RIDGE, HEAD OFHOMELAND SECURITY, HAVE ANY PROPOSALS ON HIS DESKABOUT DECLARING NO FLY ZONES OVER NUCLEAR POWERPLANTS IN THE UNITED STATES?There are a variety of proposals regarding security for our nuclear powerfacilities as well as other measures to strengthen our homeland security. And weare constantly evaluating the information we have to determine whether No FlyZones or other security measures are necessary.\"The Public Is Urged to Write About Concerns and Suggestions"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Write to the American President, Secretary of Transportation or HomelandSecurity Director Tom Ridge:Tom Ridge, DirectorWhite House Office of Homeland SecurityThe White House1600 Pennsylvania Avenue N. W.Washington, D. C. 20500January 28, 2002Why Not Have \"No Fly Zones\" Above American Nuclear Reactors?Scott Portzline: \"I saw a military aircraft flying very low preparing to come infor a landing at the Harrisburg International Airport which is just 2.5 miles awayfrom the TMI plant. And so, on a regular basis you can observe large aircraftflying directly over Three Mile Island. In this case, it wasn't directly over. It wasabout a mile away, but it demonstrated that there is a flight path at a nuclearplant that is troubling because there would be no way for anyone to determinewhether this was a plane about to attack TMI. We have small airplanes andcorporate jets at another airport that's just a few more miles away, and it's verypossible that this flight corridor and landing area could be used to attack TMIfrom the air.WHAT DID YOUR INSIDE SOURCES SAY ABOUT THE FBI ALERTTHAT TERRORISTS MIGHT ATTACK A U. S. NUCLEAR POWERPLANT IN JANUARY?I had been getting a sense that something was up for a couple of weeks then.And I finally decided I needed to talk with some of my intelligence sources. I'venever heard the way this one gentleman talked to me in the last decade or so. Hesounded upset and bothered by what he had been reading and told me he didn'teven like to look at the daily intelligence reports because of the things he hadlearned recently.MEANING THEY WERE SO ALARMING?Yes, that was the impression I got. He didn't tell me any details about what hesaw other than saying things like, 'I wish I didn't know what I know.' And that hehas goosebumps when he thinks about September 11th and some of the otherthings he has read recently.October 17, 2001WHAT DID HE SAY ABOUT THE OCTOBER 17, 2001 FBI ALERT?HOW VALID WAS IT?The Three Mile Island threat my source told me that there was a lot ofintelligence behind the threat that came in on October 17 and that the threat wasan e-mail from Spain and that there were many other factors that said this was areal threat and putting things together, it was easy for me to figure out when thefederal authorities were saying that the threat was not credible, they wereactually making a cover story. I believe the threat was credible.In fact, they closed down the Harrisburg International Airport for several hoursand there were three F-16s circling the Three Mile Island area.WHY, SCOTT, A MONTH AFTER SEPTEMBER 11 WOULD ANYONEIN THE GOVERNMENT FEEL JUSTIFIED IN COVERING UP A VALIDPOTENTIAL ATTACK ON THREE MILE ISLAND?I don't understand intelligence and we certainly don't get told everything that wemay actually have a right to know about. It would frighten a lot of people,especially in this area which went through one nuclear accident. Some peoplehere still suffer from the anxieties produced by that 1979 nuclear accident. It"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"would frighten me.I SUPPOSE WHAT AUTHORITIES ARE WEIGHING IS: DO WE TELLAND GET PEOPLE OUT IN AN ORDERLY FASHION WHILE WEWAIT FOR A TERRORIST ATTACK?The local officials complained quite heavily about the delay in communicationsto them and being mislead by the Pennsylvania Emergency ManagementAgency. They were told not to speak of the threat. There was a hearing held bya local U. S. Congressman to try to repair the communications problem. I wasinvited to testify at that hearing and to talk about security problems. But whenwe got to the end of the section of the meeting that was going to lead into thecurrent situation, including security, he banged the gavel and that was the end ofthe meeting. So while he's telling the media that he's solved some of thecommunication problems and had a hearing on security, they didn't really have ahearing on security.POLITICIANS DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT A POTENTIALNUCLEAR THREAT IN PUBLIC?That seems the case. Earlier this summer before any of these things came up, Iwent to a town meeting with U. S. Senator Arlen Spector from Pennsylvania. Imet with one of his assistants to express my concern that there were no guards atthe entrances at TMI. Then I went to a public meeting and talked for a fewseconds and he cut me off. Then I started to talk for a half minute and hesignaled for a staffer to come over and get details from me and they took me outof the room. He did not want a public airing of what I was discussing.Sometimes I think it might have to do with politics where the Bush/Cheneyenergy plan is calling for revitalization of nuclear energy and the plants beingpursued now have no containment buildings.THESE ARE THE PEBBLE BED REACTORS?That's right. It's called the modular pebble bed reactor. They are smaller. Theyare cheaper to build because you don't have a containment building and you canadd on to them unit by unit.BUT THEY ARE STILL EXPERIMENTAL, RIGHT?Yes, there is an experimental program about to get underway in South Africa.There was an experimental program in West Germany, the Hamm-Uentrop,which on May 4, 1996 experienced a radioactive release nine days afterChernobyl which was still burning. And the pebble bed graphite can burn. Andwithout containment buildings, these pebble bed reactors might be even morevulnerable to terrorist attacks.September 8, 2001 Three Days Before 9-11On September 8, Saturday evening, about 7:45 p.m. EST, I was videotaping atthe north entrance at Three Mile Island. There was no guard, no guard booth, nopolice officers and no National Guard, of course. And the vehicle barriers werewide open. So, the entrance was completely open. This was furtherdocumentation of the conditions at TMI and the vulnerability of it which wasonly three days before the horrific attacks in New York and the Pentagon.More Security Guards Needed?WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE CURRENTPENNSYLVANIA POLICY ON THE NATIONAL GUARD AT THENUCLEAR REACTORS?The National Guard was deployed in November after a lot of public outcry, butit's there on a volunteer basis. The guardsmen are paid, but they volunteer forthe duty. And it's unclear as to what type of training they've had and exactlywhat their responsibilities are. We don't think the policy is strong enough."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"If you go back before the attacks on September 11th, you would not have foundany guards at the entrances of Three Mile Island. And I had filed a petition withthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission so there would be a requirement for at leastone armed guard at the entrances of all nuclear plants. I picked one because itwas the simplest, least amount of trouble that it would be causing the NRC andtheir pocketbook. I figured it would be a litmus test.WHAT HAPPENED?The time period for the comment to come in on that ruling has just ended twoweeks ago, so we will soon find out from the NRC what they have decided.IF THEY IGNORE YOUR PETITION AND NOTHING CHANGES,WHAT DO YOU CONCLUDE?There is not a proper security effort at U. S. nuclear power plants.\"Could U. S. Nuclear Power Plants Ever Blow Up Like Atomic Bombs?Paul Leventhal, President, Nuclear Control Institute, Washington, D. C.:\"No. The nuclear power plants we have in the United States because they use alow-enriched uranium fuel rather than a bomb grade enriched uranium fuel willnot explode like an atomic bomb. But if there is a meltdown and thecontainment is breached. Frankly, in the event of a meltdown it is very likelythat the containment walls will be breached because of the very large pressuresand explosions that take place in that kind of circumstance. then the radioactiveplume has the effect of fallout from a nuclear explosion. So, it is the radioactivedebris from a destroyed plant that people would be subjected to rather than theblast effects of an atomic bomb. But that doesn't mean that the consequences interms of radiation effects are minor. To the contrary, the consequences could bequite severe.THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS ALREADY MOVED TO MAKEAIRPORT SECURITY AND CHECK-IN BE UNDER FEDERALOVERSIGHT. WHY WOULD WE NOT MOVE IN THAT SAMEDIRECTION TO PROTECT NUCLEAR REACTORS, TO PUT THEMUNDER A FEDERAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION?Well, that's the $64.000 question. It would seem to me that there is no reasonnot to do it. the president in his budget message is asking for billions of dollarsmore for the Homeland Security Agency. They are going to be spending a lot ofmoney on security in the United States. The actions they are taking at theairports are a good first step. Clearly still insufficient in terms of the quality ofthe personnel and of the detection equipment being used. We think the samehigh priority must b e placed on protection of nuclear power plants and wethink emergency action must be taken immediately so these plants do not remainvulnerable any longer. As we speak, these plants are vulnerable.Yet, application of military resources to the protection of these plants canreduce the vulnerabilities to an acceptable level and that's what needs to bedone.WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP FOR THE NUCLEAR CONTROLINSTITUTE IN ALL THIS?Well, we continue to do vigilance on what the industry and what the governmentare doing. We try to be a truth squad in the sense that when they put outmisleading statements and point to misleading video of tests of planes crashinginto walls. We try to keep them honest so that the American people understandthe extent to which they are being mislead. And we are also appealing tocongress to take action to get legislation passed that will over the long runprovide greater security, but we also point out that emergency actions need to betaken immediately. And that can only be done on the authority of the NuclearRegulatory Commission and the President of the United States. And that is whatis most lacking right now.Call For Nuclear Power Plant Security Changes"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"My suggestion is that action be taken on three fronts:1) One is with regard to No fly zones be established immediately overevery nuclear power plant in the United States.2) The second is to have ground-to-air battery missiles installed atthese plants under the control of highly trained military operatorswho are further under the control of military and political authority.3) And thirdly, you need to have troops on the ground, at least 30 or40 troops around each of the 62 plants to provide a visible show offorce and a credible deterrent against attack.If you had those measures then I think people could rest reasonablyassured that the plants are protected. But you need to have thosedefenses tested in mock exercises to demonstrate that they work. Andonly then should the plants be allowed to operate. And if those kindsof protections are not in place, then the plants should be shut down.YOUR WEBSITE IS WWW.NCI.ORG.We have a special section on nuclear terrorism. Unfortunately the nuclearterrorism threat is not limited to the sabotage of reactors. There is also thepossibility that terrorists that can acquire atom bomb materials and make bombsout of them. There is the 'dirty bomb' threat a number of other threats. And atour website, we describe what each of these are and give assessment of therelative severity of these threats and we always point out what needs to be doneto prevent these dangers from materializing.\"1993 First World Trade Center Bombing on February 26, 1993Scott Portzline: \"The terrorists responsible for the first bombing of the WorldTrade Center in 1993 had a training camp 30 miles from Three Mile Island andthey did a night time mock assault on an electrical substation as if they werepracticing going into a nuclear power plant. (See: http://www.tmia.com/threat.html)Then nineteen days later, the World Trade Center was bombed and they vowedto take it down the next time they would attack. And they also said they weregoing to attack U. S. nuclear facilities with 150 suicide soldiers.Calling themselves the 'Liberation Army Fifth Battalion' in a letter to the NewYork Times, the World Trade Center terrorists threatened to attack additionaltargets, including 'nuclear targets' with '150 suicide solders.' The letter wasreceived four days after the bombing and subsequently authenticated by federalauthorities. The motive for the attack was revealed in the one page letter. It said:'The Americans must know that their civilians who got killed are nobetter than those who are getting killed by the American weaponsand support. The American people are responsible for the actions oftheir government and they must question all of the crimes that theirgovernment is committing against other people, or Americans will betargets of our operations that could diminish them.'They made a list of demands which included an end to interfering 'with any ofthe Middle East countries interior affairs.'Although other terrorists have previously threatened to attack US reactors, theWorld Trade Center terrorists could have gotten their inspiration by an intrusionat Three Mile Island just three weeks before the bombing. A US Senate hearingwas held to evaluate the implications of these two events and what they impliedabout security at the nation's nuclear power plants. Senator Joseph Lieberman,"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"chairman of the oversight committee, labeled the TMI intrusion 'a warning bell'and the bombing of the World Trade Center 'a warning earthquake.'
