While the camera was stillrunning, he lifted the camera 180 degrees to get another shot of an airlinertaking off. He did not know at the time that he caught ten frames (1/3rd second)of digital videotape of the jet airliner passing out of the upper right corner and astrange, missile-like, unidentified aerial object rapidly passing through sky andseemingly through a cloud estimated to be at 5,000 feet. He discovered the rapidobject in the editing room and showed it to his colleagues. Someone called thepolice who went to the edit room, saw the tape, and promptly called the FBI.Here now is Brandon Mowry, the cameraman, with his story about whathappened that day and with the FBI.Interview:Brandon Mowry, Videographer, Fox 23 News WXXA, Albany, New York:\"Last Sunday, nine days ago (Oct. 20, 2002), I was shooting a weather shot forthe news that evening. I was at the Albany International Airport at the end of arunway. It was 4:30 p.m. EDT and I was filming a plane taking off towards meand eventually heading directly over my head. As I was following the plane, itcame directly above me, I had to adjust the camera 180 degrees and catch theplane taking off away. It was during that adjustment when I wasn't lookingthrough the viewfinder that this UFO, or ?, flew by.Like I said, I didn't notice it until I got back to the station. I drove directly back"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"to the station, threw it into the edit machine and was checking the stillness ofthe shots, seeing which one would be best to use and saw this thing fly by. Itwas very, very fast. I saw it. I rewound it and paused it to see what it was. I sawso met h in g very, very st ran ge. An d very, very in t erest in g.Then I grabbed the person closest to me who was an editor and showed him. Hecouldn't believe it. Then I began showing everybody else at the station. At thattime, I decided that I needed to go out and shoot an accident. So, I leftimmediately and went and shot an accident. A half an hour later when I got backto the station, there were police there checking out the footage. They were in theprocess of calling their Captain to come in to check it out. Also, when theCaptain got there, he took one look at it and called the FBI and the FBI was atthe station within the hour.WHAT IS ON YOUR VIDEOTAPE?It's very distinct, even when you don't blow it up. We zoomed in on it and kindof cleaned it up to take a closer look at it. It's a very thin rod or cylinder-shaped,round cylinder rod, dark, with two sets of wings. One set in the front and one setin the back. And the wings were white. Small little appendages. It looks a lotlike a missile.I SAW A FRAME SOMEBODY E-MAILED ME AND I THOUGHT IT WASEXTREMELY STRANGE IN STRUCTURE. BUT WHAT REALLYIMPRESSED ME WAS HOW ALMOST TRANSPARENT IT SEEMED.Right. I don't know. We talked with some ex-military personnel because a lot ofpeople are saying this thing looks like a missile. A lot of people think it is somekind of secret military craft. He looked at it and said that it doesn't look like anymissile he's ever seen before. But still, a lot of people are saying it looks like amissile. It resembles more of a missile than anything else. But it could beanything, you know.The SR-17 Blackbird, I understand, and the B-2 bombers the technology wasthere and we had those, the military had those 20 years before the public knewabout them. Maybe this is something the military has that no one knows about.But it's just as possible that it could be a UFO.WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE FBI GOT THERE? WHAT KIND OFQUESTIONS DID THEY ASK AND WHAT HAPPENED?OK. The FBI got to the station. Talked to me about half an hour in the breakroom and had me meet three other FBI agents up at the airport to show themexactly where I shot this thing, where it came from, what direction, where theplane was and everything like that. Then they confiscated my tape. It was theoriginal tape. I said, 'I would like to keep this. I shot it.' They said, 'Well, it'sevidence. You have to give it to us.'I didn't throw any punches or anything. I was a little upset, but I just did it. Theytook it and that tape is in Washington right now being analyzed, from what I canunderstand.AT T H E F B I .Right. Then two days later, the FBI called me up in the morning and asked meto come down. They needed to ask me a couple of questions that they forgot toask me. So, I went down and they talked to me in a little room for about anhour.THIS IS IN ALBANY?Right, in FBI headquarters here. And after they were done talking to me, thenthey said, 'You know what's next.' I said, 'What's that?' They said, 'We're going toask you if you will take a polygraph test.' And I didn't have anything to hide so Isaid, 'Sure, I'll take one.'They took me to the New York State Police Department where there was a"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"polygraph examiner and I went upstairs with him into a room. He told me how itworked, everything like that.They ran a couple of pre-tests on me to see if I was able to be polygraphed. Iguess one out of ten people aren't. I was, though, according to them. Then theytold me the questions that I was going to be asked. I was really nervous, but thenthey asked me and we ran through a kind of pre-test of everything they weregoing to ask me and then we did the actual test. And that took about three hoursin this room with this guy.WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS DID THEY ASK YOU?The first and last questions were: 'Do you live in the United States?' That wasthe first question. The last question was: 'Do you live in Canada?' And all thequestions in between were like, 'Have you ever lied to the FBI? Have you evercommitted a felony? Did you tamper with that tape?' And one strange questionwas, 'Did you receive $500 from a Clifford somebody that used to work at Foxthat wanted revenge on FOX because he got fired from there?'I checked that out at the station and nobody has ever worked there namedClifford. So, I don't know what that was about.Then another, I went through with everything. Granted, I was nervous and myheart was pumping even through those questions like, 'Do you live in the UnitedStates?' My heart just started racing even though I had nothing to hide. Thenthey told me that after the test, they came and sat down in front of me and toldme I didn't do too well. I said, 'What do you mean I didn't do too well?' They go,'Well, you failed.' I said, 'What? I failed? That can't be!' He said, 'You're lying.You're not telling us something. It just doesn't add up, Brandon. There's toomany coincidences here.' I just couldn't believe it. He kept pushing me andpushing me and saying, 'You're going to lose your job. This is going to be on thefront page of the paper. You were on the radio show this morning. People aregoing to think you are insane. You are going to give FOX a bad name and you'regoing to lose your job. So, you better tell us what is going on.'And I just kept telling them. And he goes, 'What do you think is going to happenwhen that tape comes back and it says you tampered with it?' I said, 'That'simpossible! I guarantee 100% when that tape comes back, it will not it will say Idid not tamper with it.'I just looked at him and he drove me to tears. He was just pushing me andpushing me and I did not know what was going on. He drove me to tears andthen got up and grabbed the polygraph papers and left the room. I was in therefor fifteen minutes by myself and all I could say over and over was, 'What's goingon?' I couldn't believe it. What's going to happen? I'm not lying, you know?Then, a few minutes later, he comes back in and tells me, 'I'm sorry. I apologize.I re-examined the polygraph and it turns out you were telling the truth and Ican't say I'm sorry enough.'WHEN DID THIS OCCUR?This was last Tuesday, a week ago today. I think it was a whole game. I thinkthat was their whole plan to do exactly what they did to intimidate me and try tomake me admit to something I didn't do and maybe it would go away.COULD YOU GO BACK TO THE EDITING ROOM WHEN THE FBI FIRSTSHOWED UP BECAUSE YOU WERE THERE, RIGHT?Right.WHAT WAS THE DEMEANOR WHEN THEY CAME INTO THE EDITINGROOM AND WHAT WERE THE FIRST THINGS THEY DID AND SAID ANDASKED THEN?They came in. There was only one guy at first and he came in and it was he justkind of looked at it. You could tell, he was like, 'Wow!' look on his face. But it"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"wasn't like anyone else who had seen it before who were like 'Wow, what isthat?' He just kind of kept to himself. He had a notebook and he looked at itover and over and over. It was business after that. You could tell that this wassomething that is a problem or needs attention. And he went right at it andinterviewed me and wrote down everything he asked me. He asked a bunch ofquestions about my past, stuff like that.HOW OLD ARE YOU?24.AND YOU'VE BEEN WORKING IN TELEVISION FOR ABOUT 2.5 YEARS.Right.SO, YOU'VE REALLY GONE FROM HIGH SCHOOL TO WORK WITH ACOUPLE OF YEARS IN COLLEGE.Right.SO, FOR THEM TO QUESTION EVEN YOUR BACKGROUND, THEREREALLY ISN'T MUCH FOR THEM TO QUESTION BECAUSE YOU HAVEBEEN WORKING AS A VIDEOGRAPHER FOR 2.5 YEARS RIGHT OUT OFSCHOOL?Right, yeah. They were asking people around at work when I wasn't aroundwhat kind of a person is Brandon? Would he ever do something like this? Doeshe seem like a person who would make up something like this? I don't see how maybe they are doing their job. And that's good that they are covering all thebases. I hope they would do that. But this is on tape and the time line isdocumented. 4:20 I told them I shot that plane. The plane that was in the shot,they checked the airport and found out that that plane took off at 4:20. I wasback at the station at 5 or before discovering this thing and showing it toeverybody. So, that's 40 minutes I had to supposedly doctor this tape. Thirty ofthose minutes were spent in the news car on the way to the station. All I have inthat news car is a scanner and a cell phone.YOU ARE SAYING WITHOUT QUESTION THAT YOU DIDN'T EVENKNOW THAT THIS WAS ON THE TAPE UNTIL YOU SCREENED IT IN THESTATION?Exactly. I wasn't even looking through the viewfinder when this thing flew by.It's been 9 days now and we haven't heard anything. This tape has been inWashington for a week now and we haven't had any explanation as to what thisthing is.YOU HAVE A GOOD DUB OF IT?Yeah. It's a 2nd generation dub, but this is digital video. I think the big thingabout this is that we shot it on really good equipment, a $20,000 camera,whereas most, a lot of, UFOs are shot on home videos. And this thing whatsaved me here people have said this is an insect. 'It's an insect close to thescreen.' Or, 'It's an error in the tape.'But that's all discredited because if you see the whole video, there is one cloudin the upper left hand corner and this thing goes behind that cloud. It's so easyto see. That's not an insect, you know!IT'S SOMETHING AS FAR AWAY AS THE CLOUD AND GOES BEHIND ITAND HAS THIS VERY STRANGE, LONG, MISSILE-LIKE STRUCTUREWITH THESE APPENDAGES AT THE FRONT AND BACK AND HASWHAT SEEMS TO BE ALMOST AN EFFORT TO CLOAK ITSELF IN AKIND OF INVISIBILITY THAT REFLECTS THE BLUE SKY.I never thought of it like that but I guess you could say that. Yeah. I guess youcould say that."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I'M ALSO CURIOUS IF IN THAT FIRST ARRIVAL OF THE FBI IN THEEDITING ROOM, DID THE FELLOW WHO WAS TAKING NOTES ASK TOYOU OR ANYONE ELSE AT THE STATION ABOUT THIS BEING ANUNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT IN THE CONTEXT OF SOMETHINGEXTRATERRESTRIAL?No, no, they never said anything like that. There was a lot of talk around thestation like that. But, no the FBI never said anything like that. But I would liketo add that this thing that is flying through the screen it's only we checked whatthe cloud ceiling was that day. And the cloud ceiling was 5000 feet. This thingwas at least 5,000 feet in the air and it was almost as long as that plane, which isabout 300 feet in the air, from that (longer) distance. And it's only on the screenfor about 7 frames. We shoot, those cameras shoot 30 frames a second. So thisthing was in the screen for a third of a second. And it's that far away. When yousee like a jet up there flying, it looks like it's a snail because it's so far awaybecause of our perception, it looks like it's going slow.But this thing is just a third of a second through that frame and it's gone at least5,000 feet in the air. I mean, I don't know of anything that can go that fast that'son earth.HOW BIG IS IT REALLY?Exactly. It looks huge and it's so far away. It's got to be hundreds of feet inlength and going thousands of miles an hour.WHEN YOU WERE LAST TUESDAY SUBJECTED TO THAT LIEDETECTOR TEST FOR THE THREE HOURS AND ALL OF THEQUESTIONS THAT WERE ASKED, DID ANYONE IN THAT PROCESSEVER EVEN BRING UP THE LETTERS 'UFO' OR 'EXTRATERRESTRIAL?'No. No. Not at all.DID THEY BRING UP ANY WORDS AT ALL THAT WOULD SUGGESTTHEY EVEN HAD AN IDEA WHAT IT MIGHT BE?No. What was weird was at the end. I had tears in my eyes when I came backdown. The agent who brought me to the New York State Police Dept. He wasdownstairs and the other guy who administered the test looked at the agent andhe said, 'Brandon is a little upset with me.' Tears are rolling down my face. He'slike, 'I told him that I misread the polygraph test and I told him that he didn'tpass and he got a little upset with me, but he did OK.' And then the guy justlooked at me, the FBI agent, and smiled and goes, 'I knew you would pass. Iknew you would do it. I just knew you were telling the truth.\" And he wasshaking my hand. But he said, 'We still don't know what this thing is and I'mgoing to need your help to find out what this thing is.'And I just looked at him. In the heat of the moment, I was so upset. It was closeto one of, on the top of the list, of one of the worst days in my life emotionally.He looks at me and says, 'I'm going to need your help. I'm going to give you acall. You still need to help us figure out what this is.'\"We b s it e :http://fox23news.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Republication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
