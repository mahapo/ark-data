Inscription Refers to \"Jesus.\"\"First appearance in the archaeological record,\" say experts.© 2002 by Linda Moulton HoweLimestone ossuary dated to A.D. 63 inscribed in Aramaicwith the word \"Jesus.\" Photograph courtesy Biblical Archaeology Society.October 22, 2002 Washington, D. C.The first and only appearance, so far,of the word \"Jesus\" inscribed in the archaeological record has been discoveredby Andre Lemaire, a French expert in ancient inscriptions. Dated to A.D. 63, thewords in Aramaic - the language that Christ and his followers used - are carvedinto a limestone burial box known as an ossuary: \"James, son of Joseph, brotherof Jesus.\" Lemaire says that ossuary burials - digging up a grave after a year toput the bones into a limestone box - were generally practiced between 20 B. C.and A. D. 70, exactly the time of the earliest Christian efforts in Jerusalem.According to Biblical scholars, the presence of all three famous names isextraordinary. Historic research to date have confirmed that only twenty menwith the name \"James\" in Jerusalem in A.D. 63 would have had a father namedJoseph and a brother named Jesus.Biblical Archaeology Review (see website below) also reported that twoscientists with the Israeli government's Geological Survey examined theinscribed limestone ossuary with a microscope and could find \"no evidence thatmight detract from the authenticity.\"The owner of the ossuary does not want to be known publicly to avoidinsurance costs and guards for the extraordinary historic artifact. The man saidhe \"didn't realize the significance\" of the ossuary and wonders, \"How could theSon of God have a brother?\"About the question: Did Jesus have siblings? The Gospels call James the\"brother of Jesus.\" Protestants and Catholics have different interpretationsbecause of the \"virgin birth\" status of Christ from his human mother, Mary.Protestants infer that Christ was Mary's first pregnancy, an \"immaculateconception,\" followed by later normal intercourse with Joseph, followed by thebirth of four sons, including James, and at least two daughters. The Catholicshave held that James was only a close relative to Jesus Christ.The owner is now apparently willing to allow an exhibit of the ossuary at theRoyal Ontario Museum in Toronto, Canada, during the annual meeting of Biblescholars in November.We b s it e :"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"http://www.bib-arch.org/bswb_BAR/indexBAR.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
