According to officials, it was the \"fastest spacecraft ever toleave Earth.\" Its mission was to travel through the asteroid belt, be the firstmanmade machine to pass Jupiter and be the first spacecraft to use planetarygravity to change course and to reach escape velocity from the solar system.Pioneer 10 is powered by electricity derived from the warmth of decayingplutonium 238 and was intended to last only 21 months. Thirty years later, it isstill going and sending signals.Its twin spacecraft Pioneer 11 was launched on April 5, 1973. It was Pioneer 11that obtained dramatic images of the Great Red Spot. As it passed the greatplanet, NASA reports the craft \"used Jupiter to accelerate to a velocity 55 timesthat of the muzzle velocity of a high speed rifle bullet, 108,000 mph (173,000kilometers per hour).\" Both Pioneer 10 and 11 were designed and built byengineers at TRW. Both probes passed Pluto and headed out into deep spacelong ago, traveling at 27,000 mph and are now more than 7 billion miles fromearth.According to NASA, only Pioneer 10 is moving in the opposite direction to the Sun'smotion through the galaxy. Pioneer 11 took an opposite route with the directionof the Sun's path.

Therate of deceleration is very close to a cosmic measurement known as Hubble'sConstant. That refers to the expansion of our universe. Think of a balloonblowing up and imagine you are a dot on that expanding balloon. If you startedon Earth, the further you traveled into space the faster you and everythingaround you would be expanding away from the earth. The rate at which thatexpansion velocity increases is known as the Hubble Constant.How have physicists measured that Pioneer 10 and 11 are slowing and foundthat the rate of deceleration is strangely close to the Hubble Constant? I askedMichael Martin Nieto, a theoretical physicist who has worked at Los AlamosNational Laboratory since 1972. He has focused on trying to understand themystery of what could be \"tugging\" at the Pioneers. He begins by explainingwhat can be measured from those spacecraft so far beyond our solar system.Artist's impression of Pioneer 10traveling through space courtesy NASA. Interview:Michael Martin Nieto, Ph.D., Theoretical Physicist, Los Alamos NationalLaboratory, Los Alamos, New Mexico: \"We actually measure a Doppler shift,a change in frequency of the light as it's coming back to us. And we interpretthat to mean that the vehicle is slowing down faster than it should as it is leavingthe sun. But again, the fundamental measurement is a Doppler shift, afundamental change in frequency of the light coming back to us. By that, I meanthe radio signals.When you studied the acceleration of Pioneer 10 and 11 and you found thatit was actually decreasing instead of increasing incrementally and theslowing force was equivalent to Hubble's Constant of expansion velocity,that would be a contradiction to what should have been happening, right?At first sight, yes, and the Hubble's Constant is a very large scale phenomenon.The size is on the order of the size of the universe. Let's put it this way: thedistance from us to the sun is a distant of 8 light minutes. It takes light 8 minutesto get from us to the sun. Pioneer is something like about 12 light hours from thesun. The size of the universe is about 10 billion light years. So, that is a muchbigger scale. So, it is hard to make the leap from that scale to this scale. But thecoincidence is there and we observe it.It is a mystery to you because what did you expect that is different?Well, we expect of course that it will obey Newton's Laws (of gravitationalforce) for an object leaving the solar system. And then when you have this verysmall effect left, you say it has to be some systematic such as heat pushing on it,fuel being expelled from the remaining rockets. But we checked into that, but asfar as we can tell, there is no way that we can understand how something likeheat from the nuclear fuel or radiant heat from the electrical power could causethis. It doesn't mean that it isn't there. It means we couldn't find out how it coulddo it."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Gravity Might Not Work Exactly The Way We Thought It Did?Another idea is that maybe you have a modification of the Laws of Gravity atlarge distances. There is one guy in particular by the name of Moti Milgrom(Theoretical Physicist at the Weizmann Institute of Israel, Rehobeth, Israel.),who has proposed at very large distances gravity gets modified. Why he says thatfor instance is that people noticed that rotation curves of galaxies are not whatyou would expect given the visible matter that you see. And so they say, 'Ah,there's got to be Dark Matter, missing matter.' And Milgrom says, 'No, there isn'tDark Matter, there isn't missing matter. It's just that gravity is modified.'Once again the size of this modification scale is about the size of our anomalousacceleration (in Pioneers 10 and 11). So, maybe this is sort of like the firstappearance of this modification of gravity at large distances.If so, why would it show up still so close to our solar system? Pioneers 10and 11 are still not that far from us.Yes, that's right. But the point is, what happens is that this is the first craft whichhas been able to be tracked to this accuracy at this distance. No other spacecraftat this distance has been able to be tracked this well for various technicalreasons. This one was just built by accident so you could track it very precisely.And other spacecraft were not built this way and couldn't be tracked as well asthis one can.How would we see things differently if Dr. Milgrom's theory is provedcorrect?What that would mean is that our understanding of what is causing cosmology,our understanding of cosmology would change radically. Right now, our ideasof cosmology are very biased toward the fact that there exists Dark Matter outthere. And we're trying to understand the behavior of the universe at very largedistances. And our current understanding is based on a paradigm that thereexists large amounts of Dark Matter. And with this theory, that ain't true. So, ourunderstanding of cosmology changes radically if this were indeed correct.If Dr. Milgrom is correct, he is saying we don't need dark matter, but whatthen replaces dark matter?A force. Because what the Dark Matter does is make things behave a certain wayunder Newtonian physics or Einstein physics. But what Milgrom's Theory says isthat a smaller amount of matter of normal matter will make the objects obey theway we thought they would only with large amounts of matter.Let me give you an example: Spiral galaxies - they basically rotate as a soliddisc. And that has been very, very strange because there is not enough visiblematter in those galaxies to make them rotate solidly.A spiral galaxy M31 (NGC 224), type Sb,in Andromeda from Messier Catalogue.The spiral arms should all wind up just like you were rotating a little banner in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"back of you going around and around and it winds up wrapped around you.That's basically what should happen with the spiral galaxies if only the matterthat we see is there. But they don't. They remain solid. It's like someone painteda disc and then rotated the disc. And the way people say, 'Aha, it behaves, thereare different ways that there is more matter in there than we think.' And Milgromsays, 'No, you don't need more matter. You need a change in the laws of physics.So, that's an example of how our understanding would change.Then if he's right, how would that effect the way we look now at theevolution of this universe? Would it continue to expand infinitely? Orwould it collapse back on itself?What would happen is that we would have to re-analyze that question. OK? Iimagine that the end result would be what we think now that it is expanding.But our understanding of how that happens would be radically different.What is the next step in the research on this?Well, there are three different subgroups some of us are looking at. One is to getmore Pioneer data from the archives which is still coming in slowly and analyzethat. A second one is to look at other spacecraft. That has been done a little bit,but every other spacecraft out there looks to be more difficult to analyze to thisaccuracy. And third is to get a new mission, or repair a site on a new mission, todo an experiment to test this effect.If this difference in gravity turns out to be supported by new research, is itpossible that what you are measuring that is equivalent to Hubble'sConstant would imply that the whole big cosmology has some kind ofrestriction built in on the acceleration of objects in space?Well, it's impossible for me to rule that out. I would think it would be more likea modification I think there is something out there that we don't understand andon this scale, the size of the scale of the solar system is the first scale at whichwe can begin to see it.It's sort of like in the beginning of the 1900s when people were first beginning tounderstand the workings of the atom and what eventually lead to quantummechanics. They began to find funny things going on which they couldn'tunderstand. And this event lead them to what at that point was an unbelievablebreakthrough; i.e., quantum mechanics. So, it could be in the best of all worlds,if it was going to be something new, that might be more like it. This would bethe first signal of something new that is going on.Does all this excite you?Oh, yeah, of course! I mean, I've worked very hard for a very long time on thisand it's been very fascinating. And I've gotten involved with people I thought Iwould never get involved with. One of the first things that was said was that ithas to be heat from the radio isotope thermoelectric generators. These arebasically hunks of plutonium that are on the craft which make a lot of heat justbecause they are plutonium. And from the heat, you use some thermocouples togenerate electricity. But there is a lot of heating power out there. So, obviouslythere is enough power to cause this effect if it happens to be directed in onedirection. So, that's the obvious thing - it's got to be that. So, let's forget about it.Well, we decided to look into it in more detail. And when we did, we got to talkto some people who had worked on this project some 30 to 40 years ago. And asI say in my talks, I found out they (TRW engineers) really knew how to buildcars then. They were really good! And I got to appreciate what they did andunderstand what they did.You are excited about discovering something that you have worked hardwith others to try to explain by all of the obvious possible explanations andhave moved out through Newton's laws of gravity and out to Einsteinianlaws of relativity concerning mass, matter and gravity. Are you on the edgeof possibly an entirely new concept of gravity?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Maybe, but I want to do it right. And the way you do it right is that you areextremely careful. You make very clear the difference between what you know,what you believe, what you think, what you suspect, what you hope and whatyou don't know. It's very important to keep those things distinct in your mind.Otherwise, you'll blow it.But you could be on the brink of modifying Einsteinian relativity andNewtonian gravity?Could be. Yeah, one can always say that. Let's put it this way, I cannot rule thatout, so that's why I'm going. We have worked very hard to rule that out. Youdon't want to claim it at this point. We have come out and stated: weunequivocally have something which we do not understand. We've tried toexplain it with normal physics. We haven't been able to. It doesn't mean youcan't. It means we haven't been able to, nor has anyone else. Does that mean itcould be something new? Yeah, it could be something new. Could it besomething to do with gravity? Yeah, even though it's hard to understand forgiven reasons.So, yeah, we could be. I would doubt it. I have to doubt it. But I certainly amcontinuing to look for it We came out with our first Physical Review Letters in1998 and our final report is just coming out now, four years later, and so forfour years we have been answering all these questions. And at the verybeginning, you think, 'Oh, my God, everybody's right. We've blown it. This iswrong. It can't be' But then you look at it in more detail and you find, 'No, theythought this was true, but it's not.' So, it's a series of emotional ups and downs.And it's been very exciting.The anomaly stands on its own whether it's related to Hubble's Constant or not.In other words, we have this anomaly. That is the big thing. The fact that it'srelated and seems to be numerically the same to Hubble's Constant, that'sinteresting. But whether it's 2 times Hubble's Constant or 1 times Hubble'sConstant, right now since we don't understand it, that's a side issue. The bigissue is we have this effect, OK?Supposing this is not new physics. Supposing it is old physics. Why is it at thislevel? The reason why it's at this level is because nobody has looked at thingsthis precisely before. And actually, that's why we emphasize to people a lot,'Look, even if this is old physics, this is very important. Why is it important?Because we have shown that you've got to be aware about how to navigatethings this precisely. There are new missions out there like the SpaceInterferometer Mission which need to worry about this kind of precision in theirguidance. Nobody's had to worry about that before. Now, you have to. So, thisis a win win situation. If it's new physics, then obviously it is a huge win! If it'snot new physics, it's still a win because we have shown people how to and thatyou have to navigate things this precisely.\"More Information:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"This gold anodized plaque was duplicated and placed on both Pioneers 10 and 11 in theearly 1970s as the firsthuman artifacts to go beyond the solar system.

One is that independent of this, the NASAand space science community wants to get a mission out to Pluto fast. Thereason for that is Pluto which is on a very eccentric orbit is going out into thesolar system and by the year 2020, it's atmosphere is going to freeze out. Andthe space scientists want to get out there before the atmosphere freezes.It's distance from the sun is increasing because it's on a very eccentric orbit. Inother words, you know how comets have very eccentric orbits and come in veryclose. Well, Pluto is something like that. At its closest point, its orbit is withinthe orbit of Neptune, OK? At its furthest distance, it's quite a ways outsideNeptune.Into the Oort Cloud?At the beginnings of it, right. Probably not quite that far, but certainly theKuiper Belt. But, it basically goes in and out in an eccentric orbit and right now,it is going out. And it is going to go out far enough that it's atmosphere is goingto freeze. And it's going to happen by 2020.So, therefore there is a strong community of space scientists who want to get acraft out there fast. And of course, what we say is, 'Why don't you build it so we"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"can also test this?' that's one possibility.The other possibility is a separate craft and NASA has just come out with a newinitiative called: New Frontiers in Science. And one of the things that people aretalking about is the Inverse Square Law. Well, this effect amounts to a test of theInverse Square Law. So, we obviously want to encourage that also.If the pressure is on getting to Pluto before its atmosphere freezes, doesthat mean we will be trying to launch something there in the next two orthree years?In the next 5 years.And the idea would be that you could have an experiment on board of whatis launched to Pluto as well?Yeah, that's our idea, the idea I'm talking about.When do you think you'll know?On Pluto?Yes, whether you'll have a test on that launch?That would take a couple of years, I imagine. What has to happen is a designteam has to design the craft and depending upon the craft, we either have a testor we don't.So, maybe about 2004 you might know for certain about the next step?Ye s .Who will be responsible on that Pluto launch?That is the $64,000 question. There have been two assignments and both havebeen rescinded for various political and financial reasons. Budgets cut to zerowith tremendous politics going on. So, I don't know.\" We b s it e s :http://science.msfc.nasa.gov/headlines/y2001/ast03may_1.htmhttp://spaceprojects.arc.nasa.gov/Space_Projects/pioneer/PNhome.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
