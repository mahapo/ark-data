There was no moon and the clear sky was vivid with stars at 11 p.m.Central Daylight Time. We were there to look for the mysterious lights that havelong been reported in the Piney River valley ten miles north of Dover.Four of us were at one end of a long wall above the valley. With me was retiredTV broadcast engineer, Brent Cater, from Clarksville, Arkansas; DonKreinbrink, an industrial equipment service engineer from Southaven,Mississippi; and Deanna Ming, a TV technician from Memphis, Tennessee. Fiveothers were at the other end of the wall: Bob Martin, a pilot and aircraftmechanic from Olivette, Missouri; his wife, Nancy, a corporate marketingassistant; JoAnne Scarpellini, a retired research assistant of neurology andneurochemistry at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis, and aMUFON field investigator; Steve Kuelbs, a maintenance engineer from WoodRiver, Illinois; and John Brill also from Illinois who was recovering from eyesurgery and could not see the event.So there were eight of us who witnessed what happened. I was staring down intothe dark valley looking for light activity when I heard Bob Martin's voice fromthe farthest group say, \"Oh, my God!\" We all started asking what? where?because the night was so dark we couldn't even see each other. Bob ran to usand said, 'Look up!' in the sky. I was astonished to see what looked like three\"stars\" moving very slowly through the surrounding field of stars like nothing I'veever seen before.Don Kreinbrink turned on his analog video camera and recorded one relativelyclear frame of the moving triangle."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Analog video frame enhanced to highlight three star-like points of light movingslowly northeast to southwest from the Auriga constellation towards the Leo constellationwhere they stopped after traveliing for three minutes.

Interviews with eyewitnesses at thePiney River valley overlook north of Dover: Audio Excerpt from Don Kreinbrink'svideotape:\"They're (triangle of moving 'stars') are huge! Ithink you need to look further south. See thosetwo bright stars? Holy s--t!It's huge and it's just creeping! If that's atriangle, it must be miles across!Holy mother! Isn't that cool?Is it blocking stars?It has to be a formation, it's so big. It cannot beone thing, can it?You guys, I don't believe this! It's huge! It justdisappeared right there. It stopped. It'samazing!\" Brent Cater, Retired TV Broadcast Engineer, Clarksville, Arkansas: \"Ittook me a few seconds to get oriented and to find these lights. And what I didsee when I finally did see them were three lights in a triangle formation, veryhigh up in the stars, seemingly and I estimated that I saw them for 10 or 12seconds total (out of approximate 3 minute event), and they seemed to stop, allthree lights seemed to stop almost directly overhead. When they stopped, I lostsight of them in the star field. If they weren't moving against the star field, theywere very hard to see.\" Don Kreinbrink, Service Engineer, Omron IDM Controls, Southaven,Mississippi: \"Those points of lights looked just like the stars. And they formedan asymmetrical triangle. They didn't seem to be all arranged evenly. They were"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"just looking like stars moving among the stars. I was very impressed with howlarge it was and how slow it was moving. As soon as I spotted where it was, Ifired up my video camera. The screen on that camera is very bright and it doesn'tdo much for helping you see at night. So, I was sort of blinded by the screen onmy video camera, but I pointed it as best I could up to where the three points oflight were and tried to get something, but there was no way to see on the videocamera screen the objects, it just doesn't show small points of light very well.\" Bob Martin, Pilot and Aircraft Mechanic, Olivette, Missouri: \"Can youdescribe how you estimated how much of the sky the triangle covered?Holding my hand up at arm's length, they (three points of light) would probablyjust fit inside it. A little smaller than my hand.Your hand would span about 10 degrees of sky?Yeah, that's probably a fair estimate.Depending upon how high that would be, a 10 degree span could behundreds of miles in distance between those points?Yes. It (\"star\" triangle) could have been huge because I really had no referencepoint for them up against the stars. They were just big and bright and could havestretched for miles.That would tend to support the idea that this was a formation of threeobjects moving in exquisite precision over three minutes, not any kind of alarge object, especially since all of us seemed to see stars in and around themoving stars.Ye s .In all of your experience as a pilot and looking at the sky as an amateurastronomer, have you ever seen anything like this before?Not quite like this, no. I've seen lights I couldn't explain in the sky and variousobjects, but I've never seen them hold a formation like this.\" Nancy Martin, Marketing Assistant, Swan Corp., Olivette, Missouri: \"Theywere moving too slowly to be satellites and they moved to almost directlyoverhead and then they faded to a brownish color and then flickered out.Did you, watching through binoculars, note if all three lights stopped andthen faded out together? Or did one fade out and then another andanother?They seemed to fade out just slightly behind each other.Meaning a little off beat, not in sync?Right, that's what it looked like to me.Was that brown color as if light was being extinguished?Yes, like they were fading. It was 11:05 p.m. CDT when they flickered out.That's when I said, 'It's 11:05.' And JoAnne Scarpellini said, 'OK, look for fighterjets.' And sure enough, there appeared one.\" Bob Martin: \"And about five minutes after the lights went out, I noticed anF-15 flew overhead with an extremely bright strobe light, following their sametrajectory. And this guy was flat out flying. I mean, he was probably subsonic. Ibet he was doing over 600 knots.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Deanna Ming, TV Studio Tech, Memphis, Tennessee: \"I think it wassomething alien. It was a beautiful sighting, it wasn't frightening. I think it wasbecause it was at such a distance. And I'm really glad I saw it. I would reallylove to understand more of what was going on. I think it was something that wasattempting to be hidden, but maybe we were supposed to see it. I'm not sure.\" Steven Kuelbs, Maintenance Engineer, Wood River, Illinois: \"It was veryexhilarating in that moment. I never felt so alive! I was witness to somethingspecial and adrenaline was going through my veins! I wanted to see more.\" JoAnne Scarpellini, Retired Researcher Assistant in Neurology andNeurochemistry, Washington University Medical School, St. Louis,Missouri: \"My first thought is: what are they? What kind of mechanics are here?Who has something that we - or at least as far as I know - don't have a clue as topropulsion, because these things can stop in flight and then continue. And I'msure it wasn't a helicopter and I think that's about the only thing we have thatcan do that. What are they here to do? How long have they been here? Why arethey doing it? There's just no end to the questions.\" Cluster SatellitesThere are NASA satellites called Clusters launched in July 2000 to study themagnetosphere. There are four of them that travel polar orbits together north tosouth and I wondered if cluster satellites could explain the strange triangleformation. So, I contacted Melvyn Goldstein, Project Manager of ClusterSatellites at NASA Goddard, Greenbelt, Maryland. Melvyn Goldstein, Project Manager, Cluster Satellites (studymagnetosphere), NASA Goddard, Greenbelt, Maryland: \"We pulled up theorbit here and starting on April 14 and running through the 15th, the spacecraftare predominantly in the day side of the earth and throughout the entire day ofApril 14 to the beginning of April 15th, they are out in front of the earth on theday side. And it isn't until very late on the 15th, which is Monday, that theyactually go into the night side of the earth, so it doesn't seem plausible.So, the Cluster satellites could not explain that Sunday April 14, 2002sighting?No, I don't think that's going to be viable as an explanation. I really have no ideawhat phenomenon these people saw. There aren't that many satellites that arevisible by naked eye, but there are a few.But we just eliminated the Clusters.Yeah. Clusters are almost impossible to see with the naked eye. It's been seenwith telescopes, but I would be very surprised if somebody actually hadmanaged to see it with naked eye or even with binoculars.\" More Information:Space Station and the Space Shuttle?\"Could either appear as a triangle that was moving for three minutes?The space station is big and the shuttle is big. It depends on what is reflecting. I"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"don't know. Three is kind of a queer number, but the space station has bigmodules. You won't see the scaffolding between them.Also, there are 60 iridium satellites up there in very low orbit. Sometimes theyclump together, but I think they are virtually impossible to see with the nakedeye, even with binoculars. I have only read one report of even a telescopefinding them. They are not all that reflective and about five or six yards across.\" Earthfiles Request:I would appreciate hearing reports from eyewitnesses anywhere in the worldwho have seen similar patterns of \"stars\" moving and stopping in the night sky.My e-mail address is:earthfiles@earthfiles.comThank you,Linda Moulton Howe Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
