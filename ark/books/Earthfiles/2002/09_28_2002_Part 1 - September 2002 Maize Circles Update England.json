September 28, 2002 Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England - Two weeks ago inEngland, pilot Tony Hughes was flying over Adam's Grave in Wiltshire when hesaw a circle inside a sweet corn field growing along the road between Adam'sGrave and Milk Hill. Then a week later, photographer Peter Sorensen was flyingover the same area and reported a second circle in the same corn field. In bottom right hand corner is first circle in tall sweet corn discovered by pilot TonyHughesand investigated by Charles Mallett that had \"explosive\" radial lay. There is also a smallgrapeshotoutside the \"exploded\" circle. In the upper left corner, the ring around the standing cropwas putdown in a more conventional spiral lay. Another small grapeshot is quite a distance outsidethat circle.The arcing shades of green in the corn field are unidentified.Aerial photograph © 2002 by Peter Sorensen. When Charles Mallett at The Silent Circle Cafe in Cherhill heard about thecircles in corn, he suspected it was Hollywood's Disney producers putting circlesdown amid tall corn stalks just like they had in the science fiction thriller, Signsmovie, with Mel Gibson. But after Charles went to see the first circle for himselfa few days ago, he told me he was surprised to find the corn stalks were notswirled around in the circle, but were laid down straight out from the center as ifby a strong explosive force."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Close-up aerial of a portion of the \"exploded\" radial lay circlein tall corn on the western edge of Adam's Grave, Wiltshire, England.Aerial photograph © 2002 by Peter Sorensen.Close-up on ground of sweet corn radial lay extending intosurrounding standing corn.

Charles Mallett, Crop Formation Investigator and Co-Owner, The SilentCircle Cafe, Cherhill, Wiltshire, England: \"Those plants are 7 feet high, sowhat I had to do is walk up the hill, locate the circles from a high vantage pointand then pretty much guess when I got down to the edge of the standing cropbecause it's so high, you have no point of reference at all. My first attempt whenI walked into the field, it's like being in a jungle. You need a machete to getthrough it. It's ridiculous! I walked right past the formation and ended up at theother end of the field. Missed it completely. Completely disorienting. It's badenough just trying to make your way through there (the tall corn crop), let alonemake a circle or pattern in it. It was unbelievable!So, my second attempt I managed to find the circle. What I was looking at and Idon't know how many people had been there because I was not absolutelycertain how long it had actually been down what I initially perceived as anirregular circle in fact, I went back a couple of days ago and measured it. It's 74feet across and north south it's 92 feet, so it's kind of egg shaped. Pretty vague.Actually, there's a standing center seven standing stalks and from that point itliterally looks like a bomb has gone off in there, as if some kind of blast had hitit."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Seven standing stalks in middle of first circle in maize corn on western edge of Adam'sGrave,Wiltshire, England. Photograph © 2002 by Charles R. Mallett.Close-up of seven stalks at center of maize corn circle. Photograph © 2002 by Charles R.Mallett.Everything was dead flat to the ground. Everything was kinked off at groundlevel and about 1/3rd of the plants were broken right off and it was all radiallysplayed from the center out in all directions. It looked quite impressive in someways. I don't see how a team of hoaxers could do so much damage, even if theywere trying, you know?Sweet corn splayed flat to the ground \"like a bomb has gone off in there,\"in the field on the western edge of Adam's Grave, Wiltshire, England.Photograph © 2002 by Charles R. Mallett.So, this corn circle seemed to have violent energy associated with it?Severe. Even looking at the plants, myself and Frances, my partner. We are fairlyexperienced at looking at crop circles. Even though the violent nature of it wasobvious, totally apparent, there wasn't on the stems of the plants, there weren'tany indications of board marks or mechanical tools. They were pretty moist,very delicate, the stems. They just crush badly. There wasn't any perceivable"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"mechanical or board type marks that you see in a standard hoax type formation.Judging by the mess I was making by walking on the plants, they would havebeen there if it had been a hoax. But then again, I wasn't there when it happenedand I don't know the methodology of that thing going down. But I was fairlyimpressed.How could the seven stalks have remained standing in the center?I don't know. I have no idea. It's quite interesting, actually. Around the sevencentral standing stalks, the perimeter ones were kind of bent over kind of halfway down. It was like a curtain of seven stalks with the outermost ones bentover half way down. It just looked like some shock wave had hit the thing andsplayed it out in a vague circle. It really did look like a bomb went off in thereand I haven't seen a circle like that before. So I haven't really got much of areference point for judging it.And there is a second circle formation nearby?Yes. This one must have appeared about six or seven days later. This wasreported by Peter Sorensen to the same pilot which initially reported the originalevent. He said it was a circle. It turned out this second one is bang in the centerof the field. The first formation is in the top right hand corner of the field. Thesecond one appeared about 6 or 7 days later and a more accurate circle. Andrather than being radially splayed out in all directions, it's swirled in a moreconventional crop circle style with a large standing center.I haven't examined this on the ground as yet. But nevertheless, some of what Isaw in that first circle here doesn't square with a mechanical method for layingcrop; i.e., using planks of wood and things like that because that would havecrushed the stems if they did. I tried it myself.\"Continued in Part 2We b s it e s :http://www.geocities.com/cropcirclecanada/circlescanada02.html (Canada)http://www.geocities.com/cropcirclecanadahttp://www.cropcircleconnector.com (England)Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
