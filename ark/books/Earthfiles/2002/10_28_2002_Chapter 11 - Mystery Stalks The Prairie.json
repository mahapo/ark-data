First, there was the rash of cattlemutilations, then the many sightings of unidentified helicopters, followed bynumerous UFO sightings and more recently, the reports of people who saw oneor more strange hairy creatures that walked upright like a man. There wereoverlapping events. One type of activity seemed to decline as another started.Was it a piece of the puzzle or coincidence? Speculation seemed futile. The first report officers received of the hairy creatures came December 26, 1975,from two very badly frightened junior high age girls. One girl, who lives in GreatFalls, was spending the Christmas holidays with another girl in the Vaughn areaand it was here the incident occurred. The girls told the deputies that in the lateafternoon, they noticed the horses were acting very strangely, pawing the groundand rearing on their hind legs. They went outside to see what was the matter andit was then that they saw a strange creature about 200 yards from their mobilehome and 25 yards or so away from a thicket. Vaughn, where the girls saw the \"Bigfoot\" creature through rifle scope,west of Great Falls. All the yellow-colored towns and regions were affected bywhatever was stalking animals so intensely in 1975 to 1976 in Montana. The Great Falls girl found a .22 rifle belonging to her friend's father and lookedthrough the scope at the creature. She described its face as \"dark and awfullooking and not like a human's.\" The girls said the creature was 7 to 7.5 feet talland twice as wide as a man. To see if she could frighten the creature, the girl with the rifle fired it into theair. When nothing happened, she waited a short time and fired into the air again.The second time, the creature dropped to the ground and pulled itself alongwith its arms for a short distance before standing erect once more. The girls"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"decided they had seen enough! They took off running, intent on finding someone who would take them to GreatFalls where they could wait for the Vaughn girl's mother to get off work. One ofthe girls looked back over her shoulder and saw several other creatures - shethought three or four - helping the first one back into the thicket. The girls swore their story was true and their obvious fright reinforced what theyhad said. Later, they both willingly took a polygraph test which furtherindicated they were telling the truth. The night following the incident, Undersheriff Glenn Osborne, Captain KeithWolverton and Deputy Dick Gasvoda went to the area to search for the creaturesor any evidence. While Undersheriff Osborne and Deputy Gasvoda went into thebrush to try to \"flush them out,\" Captain Wolverton waited in the clearing with astarlight scope which permitted him to see in the dark. No creatures were found, but the men did notice a number of trees broken off inthe area which is a similar observation noted at other sites where the creatureswere seen. When officers questioned the Vaughn girls' father later, he told of a hair-raisingexperience he had had shorty after midnight Christmas morning. He said he hadawakened to a sound that he could only describe as like a human dying anagonizing death. He said he took his flashlight and rifle and went outside tocheck, but his dog refused to go with him. The awesome sounds have beenreported in connection with seeing strange hairy creatures in several places inthe United States. The Cascade County Sheriff's Office has tapes of the soundsfrom California, Pennsylvania and Washington. It's an eerie sound, to say theleast, officers have noted. Reports from some areas where the biped creatures have been seen say that theyemit an unpleasant odor compared to rotten eggs. Not satisfied with their nightsearch of the area, Captain Wolverton returned the next day and walked the areawhere the creatures were seen, but he found no footprints. The following day,he flew over the area and took pictures of it. In a telephone conversation with a writer in another state who was writing abook on the strange creatures, Captain Wolverton was told that reports ofsightings have come from all over the United States. The writer said he had beentold that the creatures do not leave tracks, that they have been shot at, but itapparently does not hurt them, plus at times the creatures appear transparent.He added the bipeds have been observed in connection with UFOs. The theory that bullets don't stop them was evidently shared by a Great Fallsman who gave officers a belated report of seeing a large, hairy creature whilehunting coyotes on Bootlegger Trail in December, 1974. He described thecreature as seven or eight feet tall and said it looked like a grizzly bear. He saidhe fired at it three times with his 30.30 and when it kept coming toward him, heleft hurriedly in his car. It was about one month after the girls' terrifying experience that a man living twoor three miles west of Vaughn, reported hearing the same disturbing sound theVaughn girls' father heard on Christmas Eve. He, too, likened it to the scream ofa man dying an agonizing death. he said it lasted about five minutes. He lookedout the bathroom window, but was unable to see anything. His dogs, which areordinarily very aggressive and bark loudly when anyone approaches, werestanding next to the house making faint barking sounds. Early in February 1976, a woman in Babb phoned to tell officers that she andher husband had heard the same kind of weird sound twice during the precedingsummer. She likened the sound to a werewolf. Again, the dogs appeared to beterrified. She said other residents of Babb had heard the sound, too, and sheunderstood a man from Browning had seen \"Bigfoot\" on Logan Pass in Glacier"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Park the preceding summer. Authorities did not have the man's name so theycould not check the story. Captain Wolverton received a report from an airman on February 11, 1976, whosaid he had seen footprints in the snow that appeared to be those of an animalwalking upright. The tracks, found in the vicinity of Beaver Creek in the RockyMountains west of Augusta, had three toes.The airman also reported that someof the green pine trees in the area were broken down. Deep snow preventedCaptain Wolverton from reaching the area, but he did fly over it. However, hewas unable to see anything unusual. A few days later, a Great Falls woman reported she had heard the strangesounds twice - once between Christmas and New Year's and once in January. Helena Bigfoot Encounter on April 4, 1976 By far the most startling report so far and the one that produced the mostevidence was one from a 16-year-old Helena boy. When Captain Wolvertonlearned of the incident, he and Deputy Ken Anderson went to Helena tointerview the boy and his family. The youth told the officers that he hadawakened about 4:30 a.m. the morning of April 4, 1976, and stood looking outhis bedroom window for a time. The second story window provides a grand viewof the pasture to the east of the house. At about 5 a.m., the boy told the officers he saw a tall, hairy creature walking inthe pasture, coming from the south, or to his right. He said the creature wastaking long strides and his arms moved back and forth as a person's would. The creature did not appear to have a neck, but it was capable of turning itshead and it appeared to be looking around. Except for its face, it was coveredentirely with brown or black hair about an inch to an inch and a half long."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Sixteen-year-old Helena, Montana teenager watched two large, hairy creatures in theearly morning of April 4, 1976 walking across a pasture near his home. He drew the abovesketches to show what the two hairy creatures he saw from his bedroom window lookedlike.He told law officers that one of the creatures came as close as 100 feet to his house.Drawings on file at Cascade County Sheriff's Office. The youth was unable to describe the face, but said the forehead protruded outand then upward to a rounded head. The nose looked pushed in. He did notnotice any ears. In some respects, the description matched that given of strangecreatures seen in Pennsylvania earlier. When the creature moved, the boy said itwalked very smoothly without stooping and did not appear to bend its kneesmuch. When the creature's arms were at its side, the arms were as thick through fromfront to back as its body. The creature's back seemed to go straight down tobelow the buttocks, without any curve at the small of the back. The youthestimated the creature's height at eight feet. He claimed he was misquoted in anewspaper account as saying the creature was ten feet tall. He was upset overbeing misquoted. As the boy watched, the creature kept walking until it was directly east of thehouse, at which time it was joined by a second hairy creature. The second onewas abut a head shorter than the first, but just as wide and the color was thesame. At this point, the boy related, the larger creature reached down andpicked up something dark colored, \"about the size of a bale of hay.\" Somethingwas flapping from the ends of the object which looked similar to a piece of darkplastic. the larger creature handed the object to the smaller creature who carriedit. The larger hairy creature then started walking straight toward the house. When itwas within about 100 feet of the house, it looked directly toward the windowwhere the boy was watching. The boy vaulted downstairs to wake his father andthe two returned to the window in not more than two minutes. But when theylooked out, the strange creatures were gone. Even the use of 10 powerbinoculars failed to reveal anything. The boy appeared badly shaken by the ordeal. Later in the day, the boy's sisterfound a track in the pasture. She and the boy covered it with wood until thenext day when they made a plaster cast of it. Captain Wolverton and DeputyAnderson made their own cast from the one the youth had. The track measures17.5 inches long and 7 inches wide and appears to have three toes.The boy drew"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"three sketches of the creature for officers. The drawings (above in this chapter)are on file in the Cascade County Sheriff's Office. This is a photograph of a plaster cast made by a Helena, Montana, youth of a trackfound near his home. The track is believed to have been made by one of two large, hairycreaturesseen by the young man in the pasture outside his bedroom window. Note the ruler thatshows thelength of the footprint as 18 inches. Photograph © 1976 Cascade County Sheriff's Office. In talking with the boy's father, the deputies learned of another incident thathappened twelve days before the boy saw the creatures. The father said he wastaking a bath when he heard something outside his bathroom window. He gotdressed and went outside where he found a large print in the five inches of snowbelow the window. He said he couldn't make any shape out of it, but on eitherside of the track and a little forward were two different scratch marks in thesnow. Each mark had five scratches indicated in the snow. The boy's mother also confirmed his story and added that during the two monthsprevious, a number of strange things had been happening. She told of hearingsounds like something heavy running outside and their dog being scared. Sheadded that they had heard weird sounds like an elk bugling or dogs howling,both before and after her son saw the strange creatures. The officers were alsotold that a 13-year-old boy who lives in the same area had also reported seeingone of the hairy creatures. As officers searched the pasture area where the two creatures were seen, theynoticed both cattle tracks and horse prints. When they asked the boy's fatherwhen the horses were taken out of the pasture, he replied, \"There's never beenhorses in that pasture.\" The boy said he had taken a lot of kidding about seeing the creatures, but hewasn't kidded by the officers. They did not doubt him and Captain Wolvertonadded to his official report, \"After talking to (the boy) and his family, I believethat (the boy) did see what he reported.\" To be continued in Chapter 12 - False Story Fools PublicCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
