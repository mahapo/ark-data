(9 cats, 2 squirrels and 1 rabbit inAurora; 1 cat and 1 rabbit in Denver). The region affected has been wheresouthwest Aurora and southeastern Denver come together between theUniversity of Denver and the Aurora Medical Center.One investigator who wishes to remain anonymous told me, \"Very precise cuts.Some are just cut in half, like with a band saw or very sharp knife or somethinglike that. Just cut in half and either the front half or the back half is left to befound. Others have only flesh removed from the abdomen area, or a few organsremoved, or all organs removed. A few have had just the spine removed in a veryprecise way. Usually there is no blood. There have been at least two othercycles of cat mutilations here since 1990.\"So far, officials are not releasing photographs of the mutilated animals.Investigators don't want to encourage copycats and want to preserve evidencedetails for trial if anyone is arrested. However, the Plano, Texas PoliceDepartment's 1993 photograph in More Information below is a good example ofwhat half cats look like wherever found around the world.Similar waves of cat, and half cat, mutilations have been reported throughoutthe world since at least the 1970s. The following are some of the locationswhere small animal mutilations have occurred - some with cyclic incidents everyfew years: London, England; Toronto and Vancouver, Canada; Bellingham,Washington; Falls Church, Virginia; Pensacola, Florida; Lee, New York; LosAlamos, New Mexico; Tucson, Arizona; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Ft.

(SeeEarthfiles shop.)One of their fundamental mysteries has been the lack of blood, tracks, orevidence of struggle. I have gone into the field to collect tissue and grass samplesfrom dozens of animals and know that pathologists have confirmed that at leastsome of the excisions have been made by something hot enough to cook thecollagen and hemoglobin. But exactly what the technology is? who is operatingit? and why? are still unanswered questions. It is a fact that no one yet has beenarrested and convicted for the animal mutilations that have persisted worldwidesince at least the early 1950s, according to U. S. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso,author of The Day After Roswell © 1997, now deceased.Missouri 2002 mutilation photos have not yet been released,but this 2001 photograph of a mutilated cow in Pondera County, Montana, is a goodexampleof the classic animal mutilations reported to law enforcement since the mid-20th century.Clean bone like this have been found on animals still warm to touch.Clifford Crist has been a Ray County Commissioner for fourteen years. He andtwo other commissioners oversee county budgets and are well respected in theRay County community. Commissioner Crist has also ranched near Polo,Missouri, the past forty-four years. When he found one of his healthy, pregnantcows dead in mid-October, he was shocked and disturbed by the way her hideand vaginal tissue had been so cleanly and precisely cut out. Predators, such ascoyotes and birds, did not touch the carcass. He was further shocked to find thatmore tissue was cut very precisely from her body a few days later.Then, on Friday, November 15, nearly a month after her death, CommissionerCrist was shocked a third time to find even more hide and her tongue excisedneatly from her dead body which is still laying in the same place he originallyfound her. Neither Commissioner Crist nor the Ray County Sheriff's Office canexplain why the month-old carcass meat is still bright red where the new cutswere found yesterday. I reached him by phone shortly after he returned fromexamining the cow's body for the third time.Interviews:Clifford Crist, Western Commissioner for Ray County, Court House,Richmond, Missouri; and Rancher for 44 years near Polo, Missouri: \"Thisis just real strange. I was back over there today and I believe they (mutilators)have been back for the third time. I just came from there probably an hour agoabout 3/4 of a mile away from my house on the back side of the farm. And youjust get an eerie feeling when you are near there.Could you explain that more?Well, you just feel like uncomfortable being around that where someone has had"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"a desire to do this to an animal. You just feel uncomfortable. It's just not a goodplace, comfortable place to be.Can you start with what you first saw and how it has changed?She had her sexual organs removed, no blood. And of course, the other animalshad been around her. It had been raining and there was tracks of just the cattleand no footprints. There was no struggle. We couldn't see how she we justcouldn't see her cause of death. No bullet wounds, no blood.Called the sheriff and he came out and looked at her and took pictures and triedto gather evidence. I can't remember the exact date, but probably about twoweeks later, they (mutilators) came back and skinned part of her head aroundher jaw and muzzle, nose and pulled her tongue out and cut it off.It's real strange that no animals (predators) for several days had eaten on her.Usually, a dead animal, the coyotes and varmints will find her real quick. Noone bothered around her, no animals.Then it just happened to be this afternoon I was back over there and what Ibelieve is that she has been mutilated more, her body, since. It's (mutilators)been around on her shoulder and front leg. It's skinned and it was just realprecise where it was cut.Then, it was fresh. You could tell. It was just in the last couple of days. Theblood was not dried. It was still red, very red underneath there.It sounds as if this cow has been artificially preserved in some way...Ye s ....for the hide to be fresh and the meat to be fresh for a month?Yes. Course, it's been cool. It hasn't been hot. It's been cool. But where theymutilated her again on the shoulder and the front leg, it was just fresh. Youknow, looked like fresh meat. That would lead you to believe she had some kindof preservative or something injected into her. I don't know. It's just strange.The way she was cut, was there any kind of pattern such as curves, circlesor ovals?It was in an oval shape and a curve. There was no square corners. It was just cutin a precise pattern.Today, what were the conditions of the ground when you went back? Didyou notice any unusual tracks?No. The gate is locked. The first time, we noticed tracks off a hard surface roadand they came through a neighbor, we believe. His gate was open. But sincethen, his gate has been locked and there has been no one in that gate.It almost suggests that whoever got into your pasture for the third round ofexcisions you found November 15, might have come from the air?Either air or walked probably a half mile.Walking is probably less likely than coming in from the air, would yousay?I would think so.That's why I am wondering if anyone heard or saw anything unusual in theair?No one that I know of.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Ray County Sheriff's Office, Richmond, MissouriAfter that pregnant cow mutilation on Commissioner Crist's ranchOctober 21st, Ray County Sheriff's Deputy, Mike Spear, investigated twomore cow mutilations found October 28th and November 3rd, only acouple of miles away on nearby ranches.Deputy Mike Spear, Ray County Sheriff's Office, Richmond, Missouri: \"ithad part of its hide removed from the underside of its belly from behind its frontright leg to the udder, just a nice big clean piece of fur, if you will. And thevaginal area behind the calf's tail had been cut out and removed. But they didn'ttake the udder. They didn't puncture any of the organs.Was there a pattern to the removal of the hide from the front of the animalback to the udder? Was it a rectangle or triangle?It was more like a rectangle. We thought maybe they (mutilators) would use itfor a cloth or a shawl to hang over their shoulder or something, or for some kindof ritual.It was very neatly done?Yeah. Yeah, it was. Just the hide itself taken off. There's like a fat layer inbetween the skin and the inside skin, and it was just taken off there.And no blood?No blood.What about the November 3 mutilation? Did you look at that one as well?It was pretty much the same as this one. The tongue was gone. The side of theface. But the farmer himself, he said when he saw it, it was a real clean cut andthere was still no blood. And that was surprising to me. Even if the cow wasdead, you'd think there would still be some blood present.Today when I talked with Commissioner Crist, he was amazed that fourweeks after he discovered his mutilated cow, more cuts have been madeand the meat is still bright red.I don't know. It's been pretty chilly here, but certainly not freezing. It's difficultto say how it's preserved or if it is preserved. It should be brown by now.\" To report information, call:Ray County Sheriff's Office 816-776-4545.The tip hotline: 816-474-TIPS.

In 1991, 1993 and again the past couple ofyears, police received dozens of reports about cats found cut in half, usuallywith the front half near the owners' yards or sidewalks. Plano Police DetectiveMike Box also had missing reports on more than 80 domestic house cats thatwore collars and I. D. tags, but were never found. Detective Box investigatedsatanic cult activities, but could not find any evidence that connected them tothe mutilated and missing cats and other animals such as dogs.Half-cat photographed by Plano, Texas Police Officerfor Incident Report No. 91-44994, August 31, 1991.In 1992-1993, Vancouver, British Columbia had a rash of cats found cut in half- usually the front half was found on the owner's lawn. The Supervisor ofAnimal Control for the Vancouver City Pound told reporters, \"The cats areclearly being butchered by someone. It's a real surgical job. And all I hope isthat these cats were already dead when they were cut in half.\" At the time duringthose rash of cat mutilations in Vancouver, I was working with pathologist andhematologist John Altshuler, M. D., in Denver, Colorado. We were able toobtain one of the half cats - the front half - for analysis of the abdominalexcision. Dr. Altshuler confirmed that the entire excision had been cut withsomething hot enough to cook the collagen and hemoglobin.By September 15, 1999, the San Jose Mercury newspaper headlined \"Cat killermenaces southern San Jose.\" The article began, \"A killer is stalking the cats ofsouthern San Jose, mutilating 21 felines since May 31 - primarily pets takenfrom owners' yards at night and returned dead, often dismembered and skinned.\"No one ever tried to claim the large reward that exceeded $20,000 by providinginformation.
