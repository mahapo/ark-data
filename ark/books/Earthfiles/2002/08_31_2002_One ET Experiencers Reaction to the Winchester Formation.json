Martin.August 31, 2002 Washington, New Jersey - Earlier this summer, I met a NewJersey man named Riley Martin who in 1995 wrote a book entitled, TheComing of Tan. Tan is the name of a non-human being from what Rileyunderstands to be a planet called \"Biaveh\" 450 light years from earth in theTaurus constellation that also contains the Pleiades. Taurus (The Bull) isnorthwest of the Orion constellation.

Above Aldebaran are the Pleiades(Messier 45) which are 425 light years away. Riley Martin says the \"Biaviianextraterrestrials\"he has encountered claim to come from a star in the Taurus constellation that is 450 lightyears from earth. Graphic from www.crystalinks.com.Ancient Egyptian gods and goddesses wore Taurushorns with solar disc. Graphic from www.crystalinks.com. Riley, who is now 56-years-old, says he was taken physically for examinationaboard an extraterrestrial craft at age seven by the Biaviian named Tan. In 1987,the Biaviians appeared in the sky while he was driving and he stopped to takePolaroid photographs of their disc-shaped craft.Over time and in several physical meetings, Riley says he has been educatedabout a variety of non-human beings interacting with earth, including a group ofreptilian humanoids that the Biaviians do not like. Riley calls the reptiliansTargzissians, or \"Targs.\" Riley thinks the Biaviians and the Targs have bothmanipulated genetic evolution on this planet and that one of the Targ's creationsis a hybrid \"Grey\" species with large dark eyes that are part Targ and part humanto do work on this planet.Reptilian entity that Riley Martin says the non-human specieshe is in contact with (Biaviians) call a \"Targzissian,\" or \"Targ\" which the Biaviianshave fought with in the past and do not trust. Drawn by Riley and captioned as a\"Targzissian pilot\" in Riley's book, The Coming of Tan © 1995.Ten years ago, the Biaviian named Tan telepathically gave Riley a poem inwhich he said, \"Unto you my sign is written there upon the living fields. Lo' thecircle is eternal, though you perish, you yet shall live.\" Riley did not knowabout crop formations then, but today thinks that is what the entity was referringto. I asked Riley this weekend to briefly explain how he came to meet thenon-humans and what his reaction is to the current Winchester alien face with"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"large eyes and binary code disc that warns about false gifts and deception.Face and code wheat formation 250 feet wide by 360 feet long at Vale Farmnext to Crabwood copse and microwave towers in the village of Pitt near Winchester,Hampshire, U.K., first reported on August 15, 2002, one year after the August 14, 2001faceand code appeared at the Chilbolton Radio Observatory.

Martin, Author, The Coming of Tan © 1995, married and residingin Washington, New Jersey: \"In 1953 at the age of seven in northeasternArkansas, I saw these lights above the river three nights in a row. Late at night, Icould not awaken my brothers who slept in the same room with me, nor myparents on the third night.I went out to the river, came through a cane break. The ship was there, mooredby three flexible legs. It was a saucer shape, the classical saucer. Two beingscame out of the ship, struck me with a light first of all that immobilized me.They came out and got me by the arm, took me back and talked very gentle to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"me. After an examination, I began to communicate with them telepathically.They came and picked me up no matter where I was about every eleven yearssince that time.Now, they did not uplink my memory for 35 years. Only after the December 27,1987 sighting and the Polaroid shots (top of this report and at website below),did I begin to remember under hypnosis and all of the data came back to me asthey wished it to be. Why they waited that long? I cannot say. Perhaps theythought I was ready and would not corrupt this information or what have you. Iam not the only person who has given information down through the years.PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST CONTROVERSIAL CROP FORMATIONSON RECORD IS THE AUGUST 15, 2002 ALIEN FACE WITH CIRCULARBINARY CODE IN THE WHEAT FIELD NEAR WINCHESTER, ENGLAND.I'M CURIOUS, RILEY, WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST REACTION UPONSEEING THIS?Frankly, Linda, I was more impressed with the Face that had been done in thefields a year, or several years back.ONE YEAR AGO AT THE CHILBOLTON RADIO OBSERVATORY.Yes, I was more impressed with that one. I do know that the alien, Tan, whom Iknow, one of the Biaviians, in his poem he wrote in the book about seeing hissigns written upon the living fields. This was like a decade ago. I did not know atthe time what he was talking about, but now I understand that numerous ofthese symbols are not man-made. This is a fact. I believe this is because theextraterrestrials want us to know without any reasonable doubt that we are notalone in the universe.\"Tan,\" the Biaviian, drawn by Riley L. Martin for his book,The Coming of Tan © 1995. Riley says, \"The impression that one getsfrom the Biaviians ranges from the comical (in appearance) to the lovable.However, when you learn the potential magnitude of their power coupledwith the deductive scope of their reasoning, you are given cause, on occasion, forapprehension.\"IF IT WERE MADE BY SOMETHING NON-HUMAN, AND NOT HUMAN,WHAT DO YOU THINK THE NON-HUMANS WOULD BE TRYING TOACCOMPLISH WITH THIS PARTICULAR ALIEN FACE AND THE ROUNDBINARY CODE IN THE WHEAT FIELD?OK, let me try to hook it together for you. I have learned that the \"Greys\" are ahybrid created species engineered by the reptilians. The Greys have beeninteracting with man a great deal. They have also been involved in collecting a"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"certain organic materials from say cattle mutilations and things of this nature togive to the Targs and their females in estrus and things like this. So, would it befar fetched to believe that the Biaviians are showing us the deceivers of what wewill be faced with at some point in the not too distant future, should they(hybrids) come to us? Then maybe the Biaviians are warning us, 'Hey, these arehybrids made by the Targs. Don't believe what they say because, youunderstand, they are going to use you,' or something of this nature.SO YOU WOULD BE SAYING THAT PERHAPS THE FACE THAT WAS PUTIN THE FIELD IS BY WHOMEVER IT IS WARNING US ABOUT THATFACE, NOT THAT THAT FACE IS THE DELIVERER OF THE CROPFORMATIONS?Right. Right. If I were going to conjecture an opinion, that would be it becausethey also, the Biaviians warned me back in 1988 to not have neurologicalinteractions with the Targzissians, the reptilians, that have been trying to reachme. So, maybe they are warning the world and saying, 'Look, these guys are badnews,' or something.AND THAT THE TARGZISSIANS THAT ARE THE REPTILIANS FROMYOUR CONTEXT OF EXPERIENCE ARE THE ONES THAT HAVECREATED THE GREY HYBRIDS THAT ARE REFERRED TO INABDUCTIONS AS HAVING THE LARGE DARK EYES?Yeah, I think. I feel, my information given me that feels now somewhat certainthat they are more or less worker drones for the Targzissians and the Targzissiansdid create them. However, somewhere infused in there somewhere are somehuman genetics. I also believe the Targs created genetically these entities youmight call the Men in Black, or whatever have you, back over the years. Theyare getting good at it.SO, THIS FACE IN THE FIELD IN WINCHESTER, FROM YOUR POINT OFVIEW, COULD BE ONE OF THE HYBRIDS MADE BY THE REPTILIANSPECIES THAT WOULD BE A COMBINATION OF REPTILIAN ANDHUMAN GENES?Yes. Yes. Thereabouts. Maybe they incorporated some other alien factors, too.But, essentially that is what I'm saying in that they (Grey hybrids) are able tobreathe in this atmosphere and things like that.AND THIS WARNING COULD BE A WARNING BY ANOTHER SPECIESABOUT THOSE HYBRIDS THAT LOOK LIKE THE FACE IN THE FIELD?Yes. Yes. Now, this is what I'm conjecturing, Linda. You must take it with a grainof salt. But this is my take on it, so to speak.AND OTHERS MIGHT SAY THAT THE FACE IN THE FIELD ISREFLECTING WHO MADE THE FORMATION WITH THE BINARY CODEWARNING ABOUT YET ANOTHER SPECIES?Yes. Nonetheless, I believe it is my first assessment of it instead of that one. Ifyou are going to warn me about somebody, give me what they look like. Youunderstand? Don't give me you and then tell me, 'Hey, the deceivers are coming.'You see what I mean?SO, BOTTOM LINE, YOU WOULD INTERPRET IT AS THAT THE FACE INTHE FIELD IS WHAT IS BEING WARNED ABOUT IN THE BINARY CODE?Right, because they are breaking the rules. It is permissible, historically, theTargzissans took from wild herds. These days it's easier to take from containedherds the organic material they use: sexual organs and other (such as) blood,hemoglobin and stuff like this.WHICH IS THE ANIMAL MUTILATIONS?Right, animal mutilations and all this. Then leaving the animal there for theowner to find it is a no-no. The Targs are breaking rules. Perhaps they are"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"coming to a point now where knowing that the earth is going down the drain, orwhat have you, that they are taking liberties beyond what they should. Andmaybe the Biaviians decided to lay this down so that one of us would figure itout and pass the information along. So, if a Grey (entity) lands in your yard andcomes up to you and grabs you by the arm, then hit him in the mouth, OK!IF YOU WERE CORRECT IN YOUR SPECULATION THAT THE GREYALIEN FACE IN THE WINCHESTER FIELD IS WHAT THE BINARY CODEIS WARNING ABOUT, THEN WHAT DO YOU THINK LAST YEAR AT THECHILBOLTON RADIO OBSERVATORY WAS THE PURPOSE OF THATMORE HUMANOID FACE AND THE OTHER BINARY CODE?I believe it was saying, 'Humans, you are human. We are we. We know you arethere. We want you to know that we are here. We did the same thing on Mars instone. We're doing the same thing in the fields to tie these various thingstogether. You already have the information. You already have the logic. Youalready have all the circumstantial stuff you need to now figure out that you'renot alone in the universe. And what have you. I think it was something like that,so to speak, that you could only see from the sky. I believe that they are tryingto make their presence known to us without actually landing and altering ourcontiinuum which is not allowed simply because they belive, according to thisalien, Tan, that we do not have a lot of time left upon the earth before we willexperience a number of transitions of great cataclysms upon this planet, andwhat have you.WHAT ARE THE CATACLYSMS THEY HAVE SHOWN YOU? WHAT WILLHAPPEN?They base their future predictions upon present day data. They know we havedropped so many billions of pounds of carcinogens into the waters and into theatmosphere yearly. They know the rain forest is being depleted and it's 45% atleast of our oxygen on the planet. They know the water table is being poisoned.Over-population. New viral infections with which we cannot deal. Wars andrumors of wars. Nuclear waste. All of this is adding up. If it continues,over-population, if it continues at the rate it is going, all of this will come to anend around late 2011 or early 2012. And there will come about greattransitions. Add to this the offsetting of the weather patterns through thesevarious hot house gases and things we are putting up here. Then you have a realsmorgasbord for disaster. This won't be the first time this has happened in thehistory of the world.It doesn't mean that I think everybody is going to fall dead in 2011 or 2012. Butthat we will go through a transition such as we have gone through ice ages, suchas we went through the shifting of the continents, such as we went through thereversal of the magnetic poles of the planet.DO YOU THINK THE NON-HUMANS ARE GOING TO CAUSE THISTRANSITION, OR IS IT GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS COSMICAND NATURAL?We are the ones, humans are causing this thing. However, they do feel someresponsibility because they have had some genetic interaction with us sincepre-Biblical times. Nonetheless, we are the ones, just like a bird poisoning itsown next, we are the ones who will ultimately destroy ourselves out of greedand apathy, out of raping the planet of its resources and not trying to go toalternative sources of energy. This is what they are telling us. Life is notguaranteed to us, Linda, though we are tenacious and very brilliant creatures.For every one living species walking the earth now, perhaps a thousand havecome and gone. And many were tenacious survivors, but they didn't make itthough because of certain great transitions on the earth. This one, this transition,is made by living beings instead of being only a natural catastrophic thing.MEANING HUMANS HAVE BROUGHT THIS ON THEMSELVES?Yes, indeed. And knowingly so. They're here checking us out. It's not often you"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"get a chance to see a bunch of damn fools that are cognizant destroy an entireplanet!But, if we have the power to destroy it, then we have the power not to destroy it.It's like this: if you're making $200 million this year. Settle for $180 and use $20million of it to clean my river. Or to put scrubbers in your factories. Or go toalternate sources of energy. Let's stop destroying the earth. Let's use ouringenuity or creativity our concepts to go to alternative sources of energy. Let usbecome more realistic in the way we look at things.They are letting us know as best they can without actually coming in and takingover the place. They are here, and there is a universal community.\"More Information:To purchase The Coming of Tan,click on the websitehttp://www.thecomingoftan.comOr contact:Historicity Productions91 River RoadStockton, New Jersey 08559Tel: 609-397-8446e-mail: curtis@tradenet.netWe b s it e : http://www.thecomingoftan.com http://www.allthesky.com/constellations/taurus/constell.html Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Refund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
