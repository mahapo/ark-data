See Earthfiles Shop.Within weeks, several ex-military and ex-intelligence people from around thecountry contacted me in various ways. Repeatedly, I was told that thedocuments and testimonies in \"Military Voices\" have true information aboutUnited States government knowledge and cover-up of non-humans interactingwith earth. One of those calls was from a relative of a retired Army and CIAadministrator. A copy of my book was sent to him and by early May 1998, I wasput in phone contact with a man I will call \"Kewper\" at his request to protect hisidentity.Kewper served as a First Lieutenant with the U. S. Army Signal Corps and was aCIA administrator at an Army base in the southeastern United States from 1957to 1960. He provided his DD-214 and Certificate of Discharge along with a1956 newspaper article about his being drafted. His civilian name and ArmySignal Corp base of operations were consistent with the Army discharge paperswhich he showed me in a face-to-face meeting where he resided.I would name the Army base, but as you read further in the interview excerptbelow, you will see that Kewper was asked by government watch dogs towithhold that information in order to protect current CIA sensitive and classifiedoperations out of the same base in 1998.Back in the 1957 to 1960 period, Kewper taught radio operations andcryptography to Army Signal Corps officers under a false identification assignedto him by the CIA, for which he also worked. The head of that Signal Corpsschool had worked for the OSS during World War II. The OSS was the Office ofStrategic Services which became the Central Intelligence Agency in 1947. Inaddition to teaching, Kewper's CIA boss at the Army base asked Kewper to helpanalyze Top Secret cases gathered for the Air Force's Project Blue Bookinvestigation of unidentified flying objects.Even though the public and media were later told there was nothing to UFOsand the Air Force was not interested, Kewper said the truth was that highlysensitive and unexplained Blue Book case files were gathered in Washington, D.C., sent to Fort Belvoir, Virginia, and then re-routed to different CIA fieldoffices for further study. One of those CIA analysis centers was the Army base inwhich Kewper and his boss worked with cryptography and radio operations.Kewper traveled with his CIA boss to the Papoose Mountain range on the edgeof Groom Lake, Area 51, Nellis AFB, Nevada, in August 1958. There, with hisboss and three other CIA agents, Kewper toured with a USAF Colonel identifiedonly as Jim to see disc craft inside a small mountain and a living, telepathic\"extraterrestrial biological entity\" dressed in human civilian clothing to be morepsychologically acceptable, Kewper thought."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"When I first talked with Kewper, he said his security oaths expired 30 to 35years after he got out of the Army and CIA in 1960. That period ended around1995, so Kewper said he felt he was not doing anything wrong by discussingwith me his extraordinary firsthand knowledge and experiences concerning\"extraterrestrials,\" the word used to describe them in Top Secret classified filesKewper read and analyzed.On Saturday, May 30, 1998, I called him to ask if he might be willing to do aradio interview, as long as his real civilian name and location were withheld.Kewper surprised me when he immediately said, 'I'm afraid your phone istapped.' He had received a call on Monday, May 25, from a man who did notexplain who he was, who he worked for and did not address Kewper by name.The caller simply started talking, reminding Kewper of his \"patriotic Americanduty\" to his military past and warned him not to talk with \"somebody inPennsylvania\" which we assumed was me.Kewper wanted to file a police report for a harassing phone call and went to afriend of his at the phone company to see if there was a record of the call. Hisphone company friend found that the source of the call had been the WackenhutCorp., but when he went to his supervisor to get authorization to have a printoutmade, the data containing the Wackenhut name had been mysteriously deletedin the phone company's call records. Wackenhut has long been a provider ofsecurity operations for a variety of U. S. intelligence agencies, including theNational Reconnaissance Office (NRO) and the Central Intelligence Agency(CIA).This is what Kewper told me on the record under the condition that I edit outsubjects that the unidentified caller said were still sensitive. Those edits areindicated in the following interview first broadcast on the North Americansyndicated radio programs, Dreamland, on May 31, 1998, and Coast to CoastAM with Art Bell the night of June 1-2, 1998.Interview:\"Kewper,\" Retired Former U. S. Army Signal Corps Cryptographer andCIA Administrator:YOU ANSWERED THE PHONE AND THEY SAID...?They didn't say my name, but just said, 'We understand that you had aconversation with somebody in Pennsylvania in regards to classified materialsthat had been classified and we would appreciate it if you didn't bring up thefact in an interview or television interviews in regard to (Army base namedeleted) and that you had mentioned on the telephone and also about anythinggoing on in the (CIA aerial logistics deleted) or anything regard to that. Wewould really appreciate it because reporters and just interested people - if it getsaired may try to get into the classified area there. And of course, to their ownphysical harm.THEY DID NOT SAY THAT YOU COULD NOT TALK ABOUT SEEINGCLASSIFIED FILMS OF CRAFT AND HUMANOIDS?No, that is not what they specified I shouldn't talk about. They were veryconcerned about the name of the military base getting out because it is still usedfor highly sensitive CIA-related matters today.AT THAT BASE, YOU WERE ASSIGNED TO STUDY PHOTOGRAPHS,DRAWINGS AND FILM OF UNIDENTIFIED CRAFT AND BEINGS?Yes. At least we were one of the groups investigating the unexplained. I knowwhen they closed down Project Blue Book, they said they had found very littlethat wasn't explained. And that was actually true because anything they didn'texplain would be sent to Ft. Belvoir in Virginia and then farmed out from there"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"to other military or - the FBI was involved with some of the things, too. I know,because FBI would show up on some of these peoples' doorsteps.WERE THE FBI SOME OF THE ALLEGED MEN IN BLACK?Yeah, I think so, at least in some instances.WHAT WERE THE YEARS THAT YOU WERE PERSONALLY WORKINGIN THE CIA AND HANDLING THESE HIGHLY CLASSIFIED REPORTSRELATED TO THE UFO PHENOMENON?1957-1960. I was in the service starting in 1956, but I didn't get involved withthe CIA in the first year.YOUR RANK WAS WHAT AND IN WHICH MILITARY BRANCH?I was in the Army and a 1st Lieutenant. I was still actually in the Army SignalCorps, but I also worked for the CIA, too, because I was getting two paychecks.I was getting one from the CIA and one from military service.IN THE COURSE OF THIS WORK FROM 1957 TO 1960, DID YOU SEEANY 16MM FILMS RELATED TO THIS PHENOMENON?We saw several at that time which were highly classified UFO sightings and film.We had one film showing a UFO actually developing or materializing over apower plant out in one of the western states, like Oregon or Washington or Utah- somewhere out in that area.YOU MEAN SOMEONE JUST HAPPENED TO BE FILMING?Yes. Someone was trying a brand new camera and they were filming this powerplant. And first the mountainous areas around and then they were over to thispower plant. And then the power plant had like a smoke stack and had somesmoke going on up. And right a little ways a way from where the smoke wasgoing up, we started seeing like little white round - like a little piece of a cloud.And it got more and more dense. And more and more round. And pretty soonyou could see like little tiny windows around the bottom section. I'm just usingwindows as a term loosely. And it developed more and more and pretty soon itlooked real silver and pretty soon it started flying off by itself slowly.SO YOU HAD ON FILM IN CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY WORKWHAT APPEARED TO BE A HARD SILVER DISC THAT LITERALLY JUSTEMERGED FROM WHAT LOOKED LIKE A VAPOROUS CLOUD.Yes. Just a little ways from a cloud emitted by the smokestack. So we thought atthat time that these aliens must have some way of like materializing or travelingfrom one area to another and materializing and by using the current that wasdown in the power plant some how to change the electric currents that weredown there and change it into something electromagnetic or something solid likesolid material.They just announced it as something that we have that we cannot explain andwe'd like to have you take a look at this - your group - just one of theunexplainable things. And they said, too, that you may get calls from peoplewho had witnessed this (materialization in the sky) and this is hard evidence filmof such an actual happening.WHAT HAPPENED TO BRING YOU CLOSE-UP WITH A GREY BEING?My CIA boss and I went to Area 51 in August 1958. We were out there for ameeting of all the CIA people around this country and over toward the Far Eastand so on, and we had the meeting there at Area 51. We were involved with thisProject Blue Book thing and they wanted the meeting there with some of usinvolved directly with the Blue Book project. There were only 5 of us that wentfrom (name of Army base deleted) and we were the only 5 that had meetingsright inside a little base they had there in a small mountain."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"AT NELLIS AFB IN NEVADA.Yes. But we went out to Groom Lake Area and the two areas they had out there,they showed it to us, but only to us and not to the CIA people that were in fromthe Far East or from Central America. They didn't go out there. Only the 5 of us.And we landed at Area 51 at the main landing strip. Then we got into a van typeof small mini-bus. And after that, we didn't stop to get into any other buildingsthere. They took us down about 10 miles away, something of that nature, andstopped at the first special area. And they did take us into the area where theyhad U-2s and we also had the SR-71 Blackbirds. And I believe they were flyingthem at that time.We were there a short period of time and then we got back on the bus and wentanother about 8 miles to the third and final area where they had highly classifiedmaterial. We stopped there and went into like an office area first and then aColonel there met us and took us on a tour. He took us first of all down awalkway into a hangar area that had been carved out - it might have been anatural cave to start out with - but at least it was carved out of the mountain sidearea. (Papoose Mountain range.)THIS IS A USAF COLONEL WHO IS JOINING YOU AND YOUR CIA BOSSAND THREE OTHER CIA MEN IN YOUR PROGRAM?Ye s .WERE THERE ONLY SIX OF YOU?Yes. As we passed through different areas naturally, there were other workersand scientists working on different things and office personnel.DID YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT THE REASON WAS THAT YOUR BOSSWAS HAVING YOU GO TO HAVE THIS TOUR BY THIS COLONEL?Yes. They wanted us to see the craft so when we looked at pictures and tried toidentify fake pictures from the real thing, this would be a help to us. That wasthe main reason why we were toured through the area to see the different typesof craft so we could pick out the (hoaxed) 'garbage can covers' from the realcraft.DO YOU REMEMBER THE NAME OF THE COLONEL?Just his first name that was on his name tag and it was 'Jim.'WHY HE WOULD HAVE HAD ONLY ONE NAME ON THERE?Because apparently he was guarding his real identity just like most of us did. Jimwas probably not even his real first name, most likely.THE NAME ON YOUR NAME TAG WAS NOT YOUR REAL CIVILIANNAME?No, I had a separate name for when I got into the CIA and a separate name tagand a picture ID tag from the CIA with my picture on it and name.BUT YOU WERE NEVER WORKING UNDER YOUR REAL NAME - YOUWERE ALWAYS WORKING UNDER AN ASSIGNED NAME BY THE CIA?Yes, I was working under an assigned name.SO THE 6 OF YOU - THE COLONEL AND YOUR CIA BOSS ANDYOURSELF AND THESE THREE OTHER CIA MEN INVOLVED IN THISPROJECT - YOU'RE LITERALLY WALKING INTO A CARVED OUT AREAOF A MOUNTAIN?Ye s .CAN YOU DESCRIBE EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAW?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"As soon as we got in, the first thing we did see was two small craft.WHAT COLOR WERE THEY?They were the silver, kind of a silver finish to them - not real shiny and brightbut basically silver.WHAT WAS THE DIAMETER?About 18 or 20 feet - they were quite small.Drawing Â© September 1998 by \"Kewper\" of one among several disc crafthe saw inside part of the Papoose Mountain range (S-4) near Groom Lake, Area 51, NellisAFB,Nevada, during his visit as a U.S. Army and CIA Administrator in August 1958.WERE YOU ALLOWED TO GO OVER AND TOUCH THEM?No, we were on a walkway area and couldn't get down over to where the craftswere actually sitting.HOW MANY OTHERS COULD YOU SEE?At least about seven, I think. There were some larger ones in the rear towardsthe end that we could see that were probably 50-60 feet in diameter.WERE ANY DIFFERENT FROM ANOTHER?They were all disk-shaped, but some had larger bottom areas that extendeddown the same distance as they extended to the top. And they were in differentcolors. The larger ones in the rear were a real deep, real dark grey color. Someof the other ones were lighter in color, but maybe like a light or medium browntype of thing. The larger ones in the rear had real large top units and largebottom units to them and were sitting on like metal saw horses to hold them upoff the ground.DID THE USAF COLONEL TRY TO EXPLAIN - OR DID HE HAVEKNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PROPULSION SYSTEM OF THEEXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT?That question was asked and they mentioned it was electromagnetic/anti-gravitational type engines. But they had other propulsion systems also.Apparently they were like anti-matter propulsion on one of the units, somethingof that nature.And I saw they tried to reverse-engineer (one craft) so part of the craft was takenapart. And they were trying to figure out how it works and they were explainingto us that there really was no physical motor in that thing. The entire (disc) waslike an electronic circuit and the aliens had to be inside of this disc to complete"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the electronic circuit to make it fly. (The Area 51 people) knew that becausethey had tried to make that one fly. They were just like a battery electrical unit.And it worked with anti-gravitational electromagnetic drive, but the wholesaucer itself was like the drive of the ship. And it was all coated with nickelinside and it was like a giant circuit, electronic circuit. And it took the aliens tocomplete the circuit because they were tied right in with it and they hadheadbands they wore that had detectors. And they had finger-type board controlwhere they could fly the craft.THOSE ARE THE HAND-IMPRINTED 6-FINGERED CONTROL PANELSTHAT WERE WITH THAT AUTOPSY FILM (1995 Ray Santilli)?Ye s .THEY SHOWED THOSE PANELS?Ye s .DID YOU SEE THE PANELS THEMSELVES ACTUALLY THERE WITHTHE CRAFT?Yes. They were there with the craft. They were trying to figure out the electroniccircuitry because there was no wiring of any kind that they could see. But lateron, they found out that when they had it at Groom Lake, they had a couple ofscientists there and these scientists used microscopes to check over the fingertipcontrol harnessing and they found little fibers going out from it. They usedmicroscopes to see that and they found out then it was a fiber optic type ofelectrical transmissions throughout the craft.ALL DONE WITH LIGHT.Yes, it was light. The craft inside - the report I read originally - that when theylooked inside the craft, the craft was glowing with a real thin light inside fromall the circuitry fiber optics. Reverse-engineering of that is apparently where wegot fiber optics technology from.WHAT IS THE COLONEL SAYING TO YOU ABOUT THESE DISCS INRELATIONSHIP TO WHERE YOU'RE GOING NEXT?He just stated that these are some of the craft we have picked up and captured indifferent parts of the world. Apparently some of them were even brought in fromoverseas from some point or other, but I gathered that most were capturedwithin the U. S. He just mentioned that we were going back out to the generaloffice area and other smaller hangar area to see the being, this extraterrestrialbeing, they had there at that time. Visiting A Grey-Skinned Extraterrestrial Biological Entity (Eben)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Drawing Â© 1998 by \"Kewper\" of what the U.S. Air Force Colonelintroduced to the CIA group as an \"extraterrestrial biological entity\"workingat a disk behind a one-way mirror/window inside small mountain (S-4) nearGroom Lake, Area 51, Nellis AFB, Nevada in August 1958.We went from the hangar area where the saucers were, out to a covered walkwayarea, into what I would call an office complex because it was a bunch of smallrooms and offices. There they had a special room for viewing that had one-waywindows in it, one-way mirrors, rather, and we could look through the windowinto this small office where the being was in there. He was not able to see usthrough the mirror because there was a mirror on his side.WHAT HAPPENED?They did tell us that the being spoke like telepathically and the other fourpeople went in the being's room to try communicating.YOUR BOSS, THE THREE OTHER CIA GUYS AND THE COL. JIM?Ye s .YOU'RE WATCHING FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ONE-WAYMIRROR. WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT THE BEING?The being was, I think, what the Colonel called him was a 'Grey.' He had thelarge head and bigger eyes, kind of slanted bigger eyes - he looked like he waswearing sunglasses because the lenses were real dark. And kind of a slim facedown to a peaked chin with just a little nose area and a tiny slit of a mouth andjust holes in the side of his head for ear openings.ABOUT HOW TALL?About five feet, something like that.WHAT WAS THE SURFACE OF THE SKIN LIKE IN COLOR ANDTEXTURE?It was greyish-looking, but it looked fairly course - not like the smoothness ofour skin, from looking through the window. It looked almost like a canvas orsomething, graininess, not real smooth like our skin would be. The color was amedium grey.COULD YOU SEE THE HANDS?No, I didn't because first of all, the being had his hands and arms behind hisback, kind of walking back and forth behind a little desk area. There was a chair"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"for him to sit down and he did sit down later on. But, I never did see his hands,so I don't know how many fingers he had.COULD YOU SEE ITS FEET AND WAS IT WEARING ANY CLOTHES?I would classify it as civilian clothes. I never saw his feet so I don't know if hehad on shoes or his own feet or just what.AND YOU COULDN'T SEE THE FEET BECAUSE?Because he was behind this desk area and all I could see was from above hisknees on up.WAS YOUR IMPRESSION THAT THEY HAD JUST SORT OF PUT THIS ONTHE BEING IN ORDER TO MEET THIS GROUP OF PEOPLE?Probably. I would say so.WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOUR BOSS AND THE THREE CIA GUYSAND COLONEL JIM IN THAT ROOM COMMUNICATING WITH THEBEING?They questioned - my boss did ask him what he was doing here? And why doyou come here? And this type of thing, and the only answer he had gotten was,'We are not here to conquer the earth. We're not here to destroy anything. Weare here to add, like knowledge to humans and so on, so they can gain moreknowledge in different areas.'DID YOUR BOSS AND THE OTHER MEN EXPLAIN HOW THATTELEPATHIC PROCESS WENT?They said they definitely weren't hearing a thing through their ears and that thevoice more or less they heard was right in the mind itself. They could put theirfingers in their ears and they would still hear the being - one tried that. Heplugged both ears to see if he could still hear the being and he could.WHAT WAS THE SOUND OF THE BEING IN THEIR MINDS?My boss said the voice almost sounded like an electronically reproduced voiceDID SOMEONE EXPLAIN WHY THIS BEING WAS EVEN BEING KEPTTHERE?No, they wouldn't tell us why he was kept there, how long he had been there oranything like that. They wouldn't - I think one of the answers was, \"We can't talkabout that,\" I believe was the main answer.DID THIS COLONEL TALK ABOUT WHETHER THESE BEINGS WERECONSIDERED ANY KIND OF A THREAT?No, they didn't really consider it like a big threat - but there was always like, 'Wedon't know for sure, but we don't think that they are going to be harmful to us,but we don't really know for sure. We can't say for sure that they are not tryingto invade or checking us all out and checking out our military.' Because even atthat time, the saucer sightings were always around classified areas and anymilitary bases, that type of thing. So, it looked almost like they were scouting.BY THE TIME YOU LEFT THE ARMY SIGNAL CORP AND CIA IN 1960,DID YOU HAVE ANY FURTHER BRIEFINGS ABOUT THE BEINGS ANDWERE THEY REFERRED TO AS EXTRATERRESTRIALS?Yes, they were referred to as extraterrestrials. Most of the time they referred tothe one out there as a \"Grey.\"THE ONE AT AREA 51?Yes, they just referred to it as a \"Grey.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"WHY DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT HAS NOT TOLD THE UNITEDSTATES PUBLIC, MEDIA AND THE WORLD WHAT THEY KNOW?You would think they would by now. But I know at the same time through theCold War era back in the 1950s - I was involved with it - the CIA in a lot ofcases in regards to this unidentified flying objects - did contact and work witheven the Russians during that time of the Cold War to see what they had becausethe Russians had contacted us in regards to UFOs because they had UFOsightings also. And they contacted us because they thought it might be somekind of advanced flying craft that we had and they were calling us to warn us tokeep them out of their area... because they thought they were our craft. And wetold them they were not ours.IF RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES WERE SECRETLY TRYING TOTALK WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT AN EXTRATERRESTRIALPRESENCE, DID YOU EVER HAVE ANY FURTHER INFORMATION OVERTHE LAST 40 YEARS ABOUT WHAT OUR GOVERNMENT'SUNDERSTANDING OF THE AGENDA OR INTENT OF THESE BEINGS ISBY NOW?I know that we have - they have worked together with Russia on this, especiallysince the Gorbachev thing and we became more friendly. And that Russia isinvolved with particle beam weapons, too, from satellite and from ground - wehad actually given them the particle beam thing to be able to like shoot downany of the saucer craft.BUT WHY WOULD WE TRY TO SHOOT DOWN CRAFT IF WEPERCEIVED THESE BEINGS TO BE BENEVOLENT?Well, it could be something that happened since that time I was involved.DID YOU EVER SEE ANY REFERENCES TO ANIMAL MUTILATIONS ORUNUSUAL DEATHS?Yes. At that time, we had it out in Colorado, I think - I saw some of those. Andthey were apparently different parts of the animal were taken like samples - thestomachs in some, sex organs in others - and various parts and apparentlymutilated with a laser weapon of some kind that left very precise cutting edges.DID YOU READ ABOUT ANY SUCH CASES IN THAT 1957-1960 TIMEPERIOD?Yes, especially from Colorado.EVEN BACK THEN?Ye s .DO YOU THINK THAT THIS STORY SHOULD BE TOLD IN ITS ENTIRETYTODAY?Yes, I think it should. We still have a lot of sightings to this day and age.THIS IS WHY YOU'RE TALKING TO ME?Ye s . \"After this audio taped interview was broadcast, I made arrangements to visitKewper privately at his residence to see documents and other materials relatedto his military work and civilian life afterward. He talked several hours on therecord and agreed to go another step to work with me on videotape. Wetentatively outlined how that would be accomplished and I returned toPhiladelphia to organize a camera shoot with Kewper.One week before we were scheduled to meet again, Kewper called to say that hehad been approached in a supermarket parking lot by two men who warned himspecifically not to talk with \"Linda Howe\" any more. The same men showed up"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"two more times, expanding their threat to include Kewper's son. It might havebeen toothless intimidation efforts, but Kewper became so upset he told he hecould not go forward with the videotaping at that time.More Information:SOM1-01 document that first emerged in 1994 on 35mm negativeswhich were studied by aerospace engineer, Bob Wood, and his son, Ryan, in orderto produce the \"clean copy\" shown here from their investigations of governmentknowledge and cover-up.A document reprinted in Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: HighStrangeness is entitled \"Restricted SOM1-01 Majestic-12 Group SpecialOperations Manual: Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery andDisposal TOP SECRET/MAJIC EYES ONLY\" and dated April 7, 1954, with aWar Department seal. A copy of this manual emerged in 1994 when donBerliner, member of the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR) based in Mt. Rainier,Maryland, received a green box used to ship film and photographs andpostmarked March 7, 1994 from a La Cross, Wisconsin pharmacy. Senderunknown. Inside were 35mm negatives of this SOM1-01 training manual. Lateraerospace engineer, Bob Wood, and his son Ryan, studied the photographs andproduced the \"clean copy\" above in their investigations of governmentknowledge and cover-up.Page 363 of my book has a reprint of the document's page labeled \"Descriptionof Craft\" that states the following:\"Documented extraterrestrial craft (UFOBs) are classified in one of fourcategories based on general shape, as follows:a. Elliptical, or disc shape. This type of craft is of a metallic construction anddull aluminum in color. They have the appearance of two pie-pans or shallowdishes pressed together and may have a raised dome on the top or bottom. Noseams or joints are visible on the surface, giving the impression of one-piececonstruction. Discs are estimated from 50 to 300 feet in diameter and thethickness is approximately 15 percent of the diameter, not including the dome,which is 30 percent of the disc diameter and extends another 4 to 6 feet abovethe main body of the disc. The dome may or may not include windows or ports,and ports are present around the lower rim of the disc in some instances. Most"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"disc-shaped craft are equipped with lights on the top and bottom, and alsoaround the rim. These lights are not visible when the craft is at rest or notfunctioning. There are generally no visible antenna or projections. Landing gearconsists of three extendible legs ending in circular landing pads. When fullyextended, this landing gear supports the main body 2 to 3 feet above the surfaceat the lowest point. A rectangular hatch is located along the equator or on thelower surface of the disc.\"Another SOM1-01 page is entitled \"Description of Extraterrestrial BiologicalEntities (EBEs)\" which states:\"Examination of remains recovered from wreckage of UFOBs indicates thatExtraterrestrial Biological Entities may be classified into two distinct categoriesas follows:a. EBE Type 1. These entities are humanoid and might be mistaken for humanbeings of the Oriental race if seen from a distance. They are bi-pedal, 5 to 5 feet,4 inches in height and weigh 80 to 100 pounds. Proportionally they are similarto humans, although the cranium is somewhat larger and more rounded. Theskin is a pale, chalky-yellow in color, thick and slightly pebbled in appearance.Their eyes are small, wide set, almond-shaped, with brownish-black irises withvery large pupils. The whites of the eyes are not like that of humans, but have apale gray cast. The ears are small and not low on the skull. The nose is thin andlong, and the mouth is wider than in humans, and nearly lipless. There is noapparent facial hair and very little body hair, that being very fine and confinedto the underarm and the groin area. The body is thin and without apparent bodyfat, but the muscles are well-developed. The hands are small, with four longdigits, but no opposable thumb. The outside digit is jointed in a manner as to benearly opposable, and there is no webbing between the finger as in humans. Thelegs are slightly, but noticeably, bowed and the feet are somewhat splayed andproportionally large.\"b. EBE Type II. These entities are humanoid but differ from Type I in manyrespects. They are bi-pedal, 3 feet 5 inches to 4 feet 2 inches in height and weigh25-50 pounds. Proportionally, the head is much larger than humans or Type IEBEs, the cranium being much larger and elongated. The eyes are very large,slanted, and nearly wrap around the side of the skull. They are black with nowhites showing. There is no noticeable brow ridge, and the skull has a slightpeak that runs over the crown. The nose consists of two small slits which sithigh about the slit-like mouth. There are no external ears. The kin is a palebluish-gray color, being somewhat darker on the back of the creature, and isvery smooth and fine-celled. There is no hair on either the face or the body, andthese creatures do not appear to be mammalian. The arms are long in proportionto the legs, and the finger is thicker than the others, but not as long as the indexfinger. The feet are small and narrow, and four toes are joined together with amembrane.\"It is not definitely known where either type of creature originated, but it seemscertain that they did not evolve on earth. It is further evident, although notcertain, that they may have originated on two different planets.\" Threat AssessmentFurther, the April 7, 1954 TOP SECRET special operations manual states underthe label \"Current Situation\" a summary that closely parallels Kewper'sdescription of his CIA colleagues' perspectives about the extraterrestrial situationback in 1957-1960:\"It is considered as far as the current situation is concerned, that there are fewindications that these objects and their builders pose a direct threat to thesecurity of the United States, despite the uncertainty as to their ultimate motivesin coming here. Certainly the technology possessed by these beings far surpasses"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"anything known to modern science, yet their presence here seems to be benign,and they seem to be avoiding contact with our species, at least for the present.Several dead entities have been recovered along with a substantial amount ofwreckage and devices from downed craft, all of which are now under study atvarious locations. No attempt has been made by extraterrestrial entities either tocontact authorities or to recover their dead counterparts of the downed craft,even though one of the crashes was the result of direct military action. Thegreatest threat at this time arises from the acquisition and study of suchadvanced technology by foreign powers unfriendly to the United States. It is forthis reason that recovery and study of this type of material by the United Stateshas been given such a high priority.\"When that \"Current Situation\" was printed in the 1954 manual, either the greybeing at Area 51, Nellis AFB, Nevada, was not there. Or this training manual didnot want even its intelligence recovery teams to know that the U. S. governmentactually had extraterrestrials in custody.Further, the SOM1-01 manual does not discuss animal mutilations or the humanabduction syndrome which were reported to the CIA and military officers asearly as the 1950s, according to both Kewper and Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso in his1997 book, The Day After Roswell. Was that information known when theSOM1-01 manual was written in the early 1950s? Or was it deemed necessary tokeep such unsavory facts from the trained intelligence teams that would have toretrieve craft and extraterrestrial biological entities?Fifty-five years later in 2002, what sustains the Orwellian policy of silence anddenial in which lies are ordered to become official truth? The 1954 U. S. WarDepartment's SOM1-01 training manual states:\"Any encounter with entities known to be of extraterrestrial origin is to beconsidered to be a matter of national security and therefore classified TOPSECRET. Under no circumstance is the general public or the public press tolearn of the existence of these entities. The official government policy is thatsuch creatures do not exist, and that no agency of the federal government is nowengaged in any study of extraterrestrials or their artifacts. Any deviation fromthis stated policy is absolutely forbidden.\"What will it take to change this policy of denial in the interest of nationalsecurity? What non-human and military-industrial complex interests are sovested in perpetuating the suppression, and why?We b s it e :http://www.majesticdocuments.comCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
