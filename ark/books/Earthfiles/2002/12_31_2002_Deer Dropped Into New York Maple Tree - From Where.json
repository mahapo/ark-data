December 28, 2002 Long Eddy, New York - Deer and gun season both"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"opened in the heavily wooded southwestern corner of Delaware County, NewYork, across the river from Wayne County, Pennsylvania, on November 18. Thenight before it had snowed covering everything white. Hunter Gerald Inman, astockbroker from West Nyack, Rockland County, New York, was at firstdisoriented by the sight of a deer hanging in the middle of all the white trees infront of him. Upon closer inspection, Mr. Inman estimated the deer was hangingbetween two branches about twelve feet or more off the ground. There were nosigns of blood or struggle.Later, he told his hunting club buddies. They all laughed and told him he wascrazy. But Jim Hudgins from Gerald's hunting club explored the area himselfand also found the deer in the tree on Dec. 7, 2002. He reported the peculiarfind to the Bureau of Wildlife in the New York State Department ofEnvironmental Conservation and the case went to Scott Van Arsdale forinvestigation. Scott is a Wildlife Technician 2 in the Bureau of Wildlife and saysno one in the department can recall anyone before ever finding a deer so highand so tightly lodged in the crotch of a tree. Scott went with Gerald Inman, JimHudgins and another man back to the site in mid-December. The snow was sodeep, the men could not drive to the hunting cabin. So the group hiked in about1.5 miles and carried a tall aluminum ladder to get the deer down. I asked ScottVan Arsdale what happened.Interview:Scott Van Arsdale, Wildlife Technician 2, Bureau of Wildlife, New YorkState Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), Stamford, NewYo r k : \"The deer was wedged belly down in the crotch of the tree with its frontfeet and head hanging down on one side of the tree and its hind legs hangingdown on the other end. It wasn't a very wide tree, so this deer drooped down onboth sides of the crotch.Another closer view on December 7, 2002 of the 70-pound male deerwedged tightly between two branches of a maple tree at least twelve feet off the ground.Digital image © 2002 by Jim Hudgins.WHERE THAT NOTCH WAS OR BRANCHES WAS A FULL 12 FEET OFFTHE GROUND?Yes, it was. Or more.OBVIOUSLY THE DEER DIDN'T JUMP AND SPRING UP THERE?Right. It was just a little too far. Deer can probably jump about a maximum often feet. But it was actually down hill behind the deer so it would have beenmore than a 12-foot jump for it. It had a wounded foot, too, which thepathologist did not mention, but it had a swollen front foot. So, I doubt it wasmoving around too good to begin with. I'm sure it could get through the woodsfine, but to have a little deer jump that far was just a little bit beyond the realmof what you consider possible, I think."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHAT HAPPENED FOR YOU TO GET THE DEER OUT OF THEBRANCHES AND OFF TO YOUR PATHOLOGIST?We tried everything we could to get the deer out of the tree with the tree stillstanding, climbing up on the ladder and pushing on the deer. We tied a rope to itand had some of the guys pull and others pushed on the deer. We put the ladderunder the deer's front legs, between the tree and front legs, and two of us pickedup on the ladder. And we are talking, some of the guys were pretty big! One isan ex-football player, actually, and we just couldn't get that deer loose. So, oneof the fellows hiked back to their hunting camp to get an ax. We didn't have achain saw. We decided to chop the tree down. The four of us took turns with theax and dropped the tree so we could get to the deer. Even then, we haddifficulty removing it. We had to push and pull on the deer until we got it aboutfive extra feet up from the crotch before the two tree trunks were wide enough toslip the thing out.THIS WAS ALMOST A MONTH AFTER THE OPENING OF DEER SEASONWHEN MR. INMAN FIRST FOUND IT UP THERE IN THE BRANCHES?Right. It was just short of a month. It's been a very cold fall around here, so thedeer was well preserved.WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?We put it on a sled and took it back out to the road and I delivered it as soon asI possibly could to pathology, Dr. Ward Stone, in Albany. Pathologist Reports Deer Killed by Bow and ArrowCAN YOU SUMMARIZE WHAT HE FOUND AND SAID?He found that the animal was killed by an arrow, which did go through the heartand lungs. So, it was a very good shot, whoever shot the animal made a reallygood shot, so that deer was dead very quickly.WAS THE ARROW STILL THERE WHEN YOU DRAGGED THE DEER OUTOF THE TREE?No, it wasn't. In fact, I didn't even notice the wound. But I wasn't looking thatclosely because the case is so unusual, I wanted the experts up in pathology tolook at it before I looked at it too hard. Sometimes in the field, if I think it'scoyotes or something has killed an animal, I will do a little field investigationmyself. But I figured this was one for the experts, so I didn't even check over thebody that closely when I had it in my possession.IF YOUR STATE WILDLIFE PATHOLOGIST, WARD STONE, EXAMINEDTHIS MALE DEER AND CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS SHOT BY ANARROW THROUGH THE HEART AND LUNGS, BUT THERE IS NOARROW IN THE BODY, HOW IS HE CONFIDENT THAT THAT IS WHATHAPPENED?Oh, it's real easy because the arrow leaves a hole and the blades, cutting bladeson the hunting head, slice right through. He even said it was, 'a three-bladebroad head arrow.' So, there is nothing else that is going to be confused with anarrow wound.BUT THAT LEADS TO THE QUESTION: WHAT HAPPENED TO THEARROW THAT WAS THERE AND HOW DID THIS DEER END UP 12 FEETABOVE THE GROUND IN A TREE WITH NO ARROW IN ITS BODY?It's very common for the arrow to pass straight through the body. In fact, I thinkthat happens more often than not in archery kills. The arrow just goes right onthrough and out the other side. So, it's not even with the snow on the ground, ifthe arrow was there on the ground with the snow, we would not have seen it."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"So, there isn't any mystery about how the deer died. It died from an arrowwound.How it got up in the tree is another story and I think Ward Stone and myselfbelieve that somebody put it, some human, put it up there. We're reasonablysure of that.IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD WHEN IT WENT INTO THE TREE?Oh, yeah, it died almost immediately after the arrow hit it. Very soon after.WHAT WOULD BE THE MOTIVE FOR ANYONE TO DO THAT?That's a good question. I have no idea. The only thing I can think of is a hoax, toplay a trick. But the reason I didn't think it was a hoax to begin with because itwas way out in the middle of nowhere. You'd think that if someone was going toplay a trick, they would have done this near a road or hunting cabin or someplace where they knew it was going to be seen. But this wasn't a place where Iwould think that you would know someone was going to come by.WOULDN'T THERE HAVE BEEN SOME KIND OF TRACKS IN THE SNOWIN AND AROUND THAT TREE?No, because we had several snow storms. The opening day of deer season is theopening day of gun season. So, it's preceded by about five weeks of archeryhunting. We pretty much figure the deer was killed before the opening day ofdeer season. So, whatever evidence was there on the ground when the deer waskilled was covered up by the snow which fell the night before Gerald Inmanfound the deer.WAS THERE ANY BLOOD LEAKAGE FROM THE WOUNDWHATSOEVER ON THE BODY?The deer had been up there for three weeks by the time we arrived. There was atiny bit of blood on the snow the day we went to get the animal, but I think thatwas because it was the first day above freezing in a long time and it is kind oflike when you leave meat on the counter to thaw, some juices run out. I thinkthat is what was happening there. There certainly was no noticeable blood fromwounds on the side of the deer or anything. We didn't notice an arrow wound inthe field.DID GERALD INMAN SEE ANY BLOOD ON THE DEER WHEN HE FIRSTFOUND IT ON NOVEMBER 18?No, he didn't mention that he did.WHAT ABOUT THE DESCRIPTION THAT SOME KIND OF CLAW MARKSWERE FOUND ON THE TREE DID YOU SEE THOSE AND WHAT DO YOUTHINK?Yes, I did. My guess is I'm not an expert on claw marks on trees. The onlyanimal we have in New York of any size that routinely climbs trees is a blackbear and I'm not qualified to say whether a cat or something else, whether a beardid. But my guess, my gut feeling is, that probably a bear climbed up the tree atleast part way to investigate the deer in the tree. We have a lot of bear in thatarea and I think it would just be natural for a bear going through the woods tosmell the deer up in the tree and to climb the tree to investigate.WHICH ADDS TO THE MYSTERY OF WHY WOULD A BEAR NOTPROCEED TO PULL THAT DEER OUT OF THE TREE? WHAT WAS ITABOUT THE DEER THAT APPARENTLY REPULSED OR DEFLECTEDTHE BEAR?The tree is fairly small to begin with, small in diameter. I don't think there is anyplace that the bear could comfortably grab and stand and then be free enough tofeed on the carcass, or pull it out. We couldn't get it out, four men couldn't getout. I imagine if the bear tried, it would have the same problem. And the bony"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"legs were the easiest to reach, so there isn't any good meat there. It probablywould have been a lot of work for the bear to dine on it. We don't know exactlywhat happened there.In fact, a bear could have climbed that tree before the deer was even there andleft the marks. We don't know what the chronological order of all this happeningwas.IN ADDITION TO THE HOLES FROM THE BOW AND ARROW IN THEHEART AND LUNGS, DID DR. STONE FIND ANY OTHER CUTS,SCRATCHES OR ANYTHING ELSE ON THE DEER?He did not say he did. I did find right near the tree trunk, some small animal hadchewed on the deer a little bit in a couple of spots, a possum or a squirrel orraccoon, had chewed on the animal where they could reach just a little bit. Verysmall, very little damage to the carcass itself.SO, IT WAS A CLEAN KILL BY AN ARROW THAT WENT THROUGH THEDEER AND THEN SOME HOW THE DEAD, 70-POUND MALE DEERENDED UP 12 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND IN A TREE.That's right.ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER BEFORE IN ANY OF YOUR WILDLIFERECORDS IN NEW YORK?Not that I'm aware of. I certainly haven't heard of anything. All the DEC officialwildlife people knows about this incident and nobody has reported to me theyhave ever come across anything like this before.\"More Information:Even though the New York deer showed no signs of blood or excisions of hideor tissue, during my investigations of the worldwide animal mutilationphenomenon, I have heard from law enforcement and ranchers thatoccassionally deer or other wild game have been found dead, with no signs ofblood, hanging from broken tree limbs as high as 14 feet off the ground.Related excerpt from my book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume II: HighStrangeness, Chapter 2, \"Light Beams, Discs and Animal Deaths\" about theconscious memory of Steve Bismarck, resident of Snohomish, Washington, whileworking in the woods behind his father's house Easter weekend 1977:\"I heard a thud to my right and a Bigfoot walked through (the woods)going the same direction as those little guys (Filipino-lookingnon-humans). It was like he was following behind them.\"Steve said the Bigfoot or Sasquatch creature was about eight feet tall, hada cone-shaped head and solid black hair about four inches long all over itsbody."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\"This ape-like animal walked upright,\" Bismarck wrote abouthis drawing of a Bigfoot creature he saw in a forested swamp behind his Snohomish,Washington home Easter weekend, 1977. He estimated the creature stood at leasteightfeet tall, or taller, not counting its arm reach over its large head.Five months later in the early morning hours of August 8, 1977, Bismarckgot home from a night out and went to get some corn and barley to feedyoung calves he was raising.\"I hear what sounds like a bunch of coyotes yelping out in the back. Itsounded like a hundred of them. I thought maybe coyotes had a deer andwere tearing it apart. Then it sounded like puppies getting crushed bysomething stomping on them! So then I think maybe they're tangling with abear. And pretty soon, something starts screaming. And it's a scary,high-pitched scream. Then all the coyote noises stop. And this thing is stillscreaming and I slam the door shut. I run and get my 30-30. And I'mthinking that thing could be up to my house in just seconds.\"\"Then my sister next door calls up and said, 'Did you hear that noise? Ithought it was going to knock the house down!'\"\"I told her, 'I think it was the Bigfoot howling.' And I called (DeputySheriff) Jerry Phillips and told him what was happening. He said thatsomeone else had called him to report they had seen a large, orangeglowing object drop down in the woods over my way. Phillips came outagain and investigated. He didn't find any dead coyotes or other animalsback there, but he found some tracks in the woods. He took plaster casts ofthem.\"I talked with Jerry Phillips in March 1996 about Steve Bismarck's accountand he remembered all of the story and more. He sent me a hundred pagesof file reports and photographs, including a polaroid photo of a possibleBigfoot track cast in plaster on Steve Bismarck's farm. Phillips told methere were also dozens of unusual animal deaths in the Snohomish areasimilar to the several thousand animal mutilation cases reported worldwidesince the 1960s. Phillips said there were several dozen unusual animal deaths near SteveBismarck's home in 1977 and one of the strangest was a deer foundhanging from a tree limb (about 14 feet above the ground) with odd,bloodless excisions of tissue from various parts of its body.\"See Earthfiles Shop for more information about Glimpses of OtherRealities, 2 Volumes."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
