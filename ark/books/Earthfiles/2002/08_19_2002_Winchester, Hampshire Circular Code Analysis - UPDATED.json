The 2002 face and code formation is a couple miles to the west of Winchester.Another 5 or 6 miles further west is the Chilbolton Radio Observatory.Face and code wheat formation 250 feet wide by 360 feet long at Vale Farm next toCrabwood forest in the villageof Pitt near Winchester, Hampshire, U.K., first reported at 9 a.m. on August 16, 2002, oneyear after theAugust 14, 2001 face and code appeared at the Chilbolton Radio Observatory.Aerial photograph © 2002 by Lucy Pringle, http://home.clara.net/lucypringle."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Update on August 19, 2002 - The following is the Sunday, August 18, 2002E-mail I received from Earthfiles viewer who described himself as: \"A large partof my full time job is decoding ciphers and reverse enginereering communicationprotocols.\" His original text below is updated with additional notes about thebell ringing sound. (He requested anonymity and later gave his name as RichardBrain.) \"Hello I have noticed your news article on theCrabwood corn circle.Please find below the results of my initial workin decoding the CrabwoodFarm crop circle, and the message which itseems to contain!SUGGESTIONS.Suggestion 1. The circle partially overlayingthe Alien visage, Appears tocontains digital information comprising of onesand zeros. (Either Flattenedor erect corn).Suggestion 2. The information is represented in8 bit data segments ofidentical length, all bit positions being equallymarked. There is a narrowseparator or synchronisation bit (ridge)between the 8bit data fields.Suggestion 3. It is highly probable that ASCII 8bit encoding is used as themost common character used was SPACE thatis represented by hex x20, thiswas used to separate the blocks of datasegments. (Hex is a convenientdigital way of representing the binaryinformation contained in themessage). The circle seems to be of simple 8bits binary encoding, withcharacters represented by the ASCII characterset. The language used isinternational English. The Circle is read fromthe inside out or counterclockwise.Suggestion 4. Between each curved line ofdata, there is an empty separatorline.MESSAGE DECODING.The pictures used to decode the text weretaken from crop circle connector,http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/2002/Crabwood/crabwood2002a.html. Thepictures required orthogonal correction toensure that as a near as perfectcircle was presented. This is so that a viewdirectly above of the circlewas used when decoding the contents.Simple contrast enhancement was performed.The message was decoded by using a marked"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"bit of paper in the followingmanner |blank|1|2|4|8|1|2|4|8|.

Theonly solution that could be found were two ancient Latin words, Oppono Astos.One translation is, \"I oppose acts of craft and cunning.\" The Latin description ofwhat the Greeks did with the Trojan Horse used the word astos to describe thegift of the Trojan Horse which was used to get an attacking army into the city ofTro y.
