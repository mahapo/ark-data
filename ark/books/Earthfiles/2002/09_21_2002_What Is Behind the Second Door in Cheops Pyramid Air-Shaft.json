C.The four narrow \"air-shafts\" leading from the Queen's Chamber, King's Chamber andthe Subterranean Chamber have long baffled archaeologists about their true function. IfCheopswas truly the King's burial chamber and transition site from this life to the afterlife, whatwould need airshafts? If linked to stars and constellations, why would there be stone blocksin them?Why are \"Door One\" and \"Door Two\" only seven inches apart? September 21, 2002 Washington, D. C. - On Monday night, September 16,2002, a television program co-produced by the Fox network and NationalGeographic was broadcast live from the great Cheops pyramid near Cairo,Egypt. The title was Pyramids Live: Secret Chambers Revealed. The goal wasto have the television audience, Egyptologists and other scientists discover at thesame time what was behind the little Tura limestone \"door\" bearing two smallcopper handles that blocks the southern \"air-shaft\" which extends from theso-called Queen's Chamber below the King's Chamber. Egyptologists generallyagree now that since the Queen had her own burial pyramid, the chamber belowthe King's Chamber must have had another purpose. The southern air-shaft that extends from the Queen's Chamber is only eightinches in diameter. The first little \"door\" inside it was discovered on March 22,1993 by German engineer, Rudolf Gantenbrink, who built a robot calledUPUAUT 2 to explore the shaft. The first surprise was the long length of theshaft, about 215 feet. The second surprise was the limestone block embeddedwith the two little copper pins, staples or handle; thus, a \"door.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Video image on March 22, 1993 taken by UPUAUT 2 robot produced byGerman engineer Rudolf Gantenbrink. This is where the robot halted before a slab ofwhite,Tura limestone that had a small copper handle on the right and a copper stump on the leftfrom which another handle had fallen to the shaft floor (not pictured here). Quoting from Solos News (website link below), \"Evidence that the slab was notjust an ordinary core stone of the pyramid was provided by the camera. A smalllaser beam mounted on the robt could be seen shining on the \"door\" and then,when it was moved downwards, disappearing in a gap underneath (the door).This gap seemed to be at least a centimer in depth, meaning the door-block wasnot a tight fit. One corner of the block was chipped, leaving a triangular spaceand revealing what seemed to be a groove in the block to the side\" throughwhich a door might lead to a hidden chamber beyond. Further, that 1993 robot examination established that the little shaft-door wasmade of Tura limestone, an especially white stone that the Egyptians cut fromunderground quarries and hauled to the surface to give the finishing layer to theoutside of pyramids. Kephren today still retains some of its Tura limestonecoating and once upon a time, Cheops would have blazed like a huge diamondon the Giza sands as its Tura limestone coating reflected sunlight. Why wouldTura limestone be used not only on the inside of Cheops, but inside one of itsmysterious narrow shafts whose function are still unknown. Later tests withradar established that the limestone block was three inches thick. Nine and a half years later on September 16th, the televised effort to find outwhat was behind that Tura limestone block in the southern shaft of the Queen'sChamber began with another little robot built by Boston's iRobot company.According to the program's executive producer, John Bredar, the iRobot firsttraveled up the southern shaft with a drill designed to go through the 3-inchblock and then return with a camera lens in place of the drill so that everyonecould see through the hole. There was much speculation about whether behindthe block with copper handles there might be another door, or statue of Khu-fu,or even a hidden chamber. Friday I asked him why, upon finding a second Turalimestone block, the robot did not keep drilling.

Interview:John Bredar, National Geographic Executive Producer, Pyramids Live:Secret Chambers Revealed, Washington, D. C.: \"Interesting question. Well, itmay happen sometime down the road. The problem is that there are a couple ofliteral logistic problems first:One is that it wasn't clear what the distance was from the back of the first stoneto the front of the second stone. So, we wouldn't know whether the drill bitwould reach.Second, we knew pretty much how thick that first stone was because we hadtaken another device up there and placed it on the outside of it and made anassessment. It's called an Echo Impactor. It calculated that the stone was aboutthree inches thick, which is what it ended up being.It would be kind of archaeologically irresponsible to just start drilling on thesecond stone without knowing how thick it was. So, that's the second issue.The third thing is that during the program, it took about - in the program, theylaunched the camera robot about 10 minutes into the show. It arrived at thestone about 15 or 20 minutes before the end of the show. So, it takes that longto get up there. And when it went up, it only had a camera on it. It would haveto have come all the way back down the shaft and they would have had tocompletely reconfigure it with the drill and send it back up. That's about an 8hour enterprise.IT APPEARED IN THE SHOW, THOUGH, AS IF THE HOLE HADALREADY BEEN DRILLED BY THE TIME YOU GOT THERE IN THELAST THREE MINUTES?That's right. The hole had been drilled on a previous mission because you canonly take one thing up on the front of the robot. You can either take a camera. Itlooks like a drill with the long probe on it so it can slide through the hole. Oryou can take the drill. Or you can take a number of other devices which we hadused previously like the one I described, the Echo Impactor.BUT IF YOU HAD ALREADY DRILLED THE HOLE, WOULDN'T YOUHAVE ALREADY SEEN WHAT WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE; I.E., THISSECOND BLOCK?No, because as I said, the stone was three inches thick and the camera that youuse to drive the robot are not able to look through the hole. All we knew wasthat we drilled through and we created a hole and the drill met a point orreached a point where there was no resistance. We knew we were through, butwe had no idea what was on the other side until that camera went through liveand revealed it to the scientists and everybody else at exactly the same time.And that was the whole objective to put the viewers in the seat with thescientists and have them experience the archaeological discovery at the exactsame moment.WAS THERE ANY REASON WHY ONLY ABOUT THREE MINUTESWOULD BE ALLOWED FOR THE LIVE DISCOVERY BECAUSE IF THEREHAD BEEN SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD HAVEONLY ABOUT THREE MINUTES TO COMMENT OR EXPLORE?That's a good question and it was one we pondered for a long time. there were alot of other interesting points that we wanted to convey in that show, all of thework of Dr. Mark Lehner and the new revelations in the Lost City of thePyramids and all the work that Dr. Hawass had done in the workers' cemetery.We just felt it was a nice dramatic climax to have the drilling occur in the verylatest part of the show. We knew that if we did make some kind of discovery, wewould be able to only kind of look at it with that camera in a kind of minimal"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"way.But it was a gamble because we really had no idea what was going to be behindthere. It could have just been a corridor that continued on. It might have evenbeen an object of some kind. We had more than three minutes actually. Therewas about 7 minutes until the end of the program including our credits andeverything. So we thought, 'Alright, if we make a big discovery that you canactually look at,' as opposed to the big discovery that we did make which issomething you can't look at but can talk about in general terms, if we did make asignificant object discovery, then we could rob from pieces that came later in theshow like the close, the credits, the final return to the tomb site. So, we felt likewe were in pretty good shape.NOW THAT YOU HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT APPEARS TO BE ASECOND BLOCK, COULD YOU EXPLAIN HOW FAR THAT SECONDBLOCK IS FROM THE FIRST AND WHAT THE NEXT STEP WILL BE?It's approximately 7 inches from the back of the first stone to the front of thesecond stone.THAT'S NOT VERY FAR.No, it's not very far. But the drill bit is less than 7 inches long, so somethingwould have to be redesigned. We've just really begun to talk with Dr. Hawassabout what the next steps would be, whether or not we could devise and evenlonger drill bit and even longer camera lens.There is one tricky little detail that has to be taken into account and that is:when you drive the robot into the shaft, the first of about 9 feet are flat. Then itmakes a turn up to the 40 degree shaft and that turn is such that if the drill bit orthe camera probe are too long, it can't make the turn. They poke into the shaftbecause of the angle of the shaft. So, that's going to take some figuring out. Wemay be able to solve that one with some kind of telescoping drill bit orsomething like that.HOW DID YOU GET THIS ONE UP TO THE FIRST LITTLE DOOR?We knew that it was only going to be, after we sent the Echo Impactor up there,we knew that we only needed to get through three inches of stone. So, we didn'treally need a really long drill bit.Now, we know that we would need the 3 inches through the existing first stoneand 7 more inches and then whatever the distance would be through the secondstone which is the most problematic thing. We can't just go up there and drill ahole and not know how thick it is.I SEE THAT THE BIT HAS TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE TURNAS WELL AS THE DISTANCE TO GET THROUGH THAT SECOND STONE.Yes, a few conflicting demands.WHAT ABOUT USING SOME KIND OF RADAR OR WHAT YOU USEDTHE FIRST TIME TO FIND OUT THE THICKNESS OF THE SECOND ONEAND WHAT MIGHT BE BEHIND THERE?Those are technological challenges I don't know enough about. There was apiece in the show where you could see the Echo Impactor going up and beingplaced against the stone. If you remember that, it's a pretty big, bulky piece ofequipment, relatively speaking. The problem is that I don't think they havefigured out a way to get that technology down to the tip of a probe size. Sothat's the biggest complication.First of all, you have to figure out how to get the ground-penetrating radar or theEcho Impactor technology up to the face of the next stone. So, it's a tough one.IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE CONSISTENCY OF THELIMESTONE BLOCK, THE FIRST ONE WITH THE LITTLE COPPER"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"HANDLES, AND THE SECOND ONE WHICH APPARENTLY DOES NOTHAVE VISIBLE COPPER HANDLES, IS MADE OUT OF TURALIMESTONE WHICH HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN USED ON THEOUTSIDE OF PYRAMIDS, INCLUDING CHEOPS. WHEN IT WASORIGINALLY MADE, IT WAS COVERED WITH TURA LIMESTONE ANDWOULD HAVE BEEN A BLAZING WHITE.That's right.WHY WOULD THE TURA LIMESTONE BE IN THESE LITTLE BLOCKS INTHE CHANNELS? AND COULD IT BE THAT THIS IS A PART OF CHEOPSTHAT WAS ORIGINALLY BUILT TO BE AN EXTERIOR AND WASSOMEHOW EXPANDED UPON?I think the idea of that particular type of limestone having some kind ofadditional meaning is valid, because as you said the exterior of the GreatPyramid was covered with it. In fact, the second pyramid, Kefren the son ofKhufu the top of his pyramid still has its facing stone on it which is why it has asmooth exterior for the top part.The second part of what you are suggesting, I think, is a harder case to makebecause the shaft do seem to have a kind of parallel to the shafts in the King'schamber that do go all the way to the outside of the pyramid. The way they wereconstructed, they were laid out as the pyramid was going up. It just seems toimply that they would have been designed to go clear to the outside. But, youknow, there is a huge amount of speculation here.So, what you are saying is that perhaps the stone we are seeing was the originalouter layer and then they made some modifications.JUST RAISING THAT AS A QUESTION.I don't think that would work because we are still about 45 or 50 feet from theexterior wall of the pyramid. They had to start building from the base with aparticular angle in mind. So, I don't think it ever would have been at the anglethat would have ended where the blocking stone is.I KNOW THAT THE FOUR INTERIOR LITTLE CHANNELS ARE STILL AMYSTERY EVEN ABOUT WHAT THEIR FUNCTION MIGHT HAVE BEENAND CLEARLY, THIS WAS QUITE AN ENGINEERING FEAT TO BUILD APYRAMID THAT LARGE AND HAVE THESE FOUR VERY PRECISECHANNELS. HAS ANYBODY SINCE THE NIGHT OF THE SHOW THATYOU'VE TALKED TO IN EGYPTIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL QUARTERSTRIED TO SPECULATE ON WHY THEY THINK THE TURA LIMESTONEMIGHT HAVE BEEN USED FOR THAT FIRST BLOCK AND POSSIBLYTHAT SECOND BLOCK INSIDE AN 8-INCH DIAMETER LITTLECHANNEL?Yeah, that's an excellent question. The only person I know of who has talked alittle bit about this is Mark Lehner. What Mark said was that he felt there wassome significance to the tura limestone being there. He wasn't sure what it wouldmean, but he felt like it leant more credence to the possibility of findingsomething because that stone did have a special use.But beyond that level of speculation, I haven't heard anything. Part of it isbecause we really haven't had a chance to digest and expand that aspect of theacademic inquiry. The investigation continues, but kind of making sense out ofthe data hasn't really begun in earnest yet, I would say. So maybe that's onereason why we don't have too many answers to that.YOU WERE AT CHEOPS FOR THE BROADCAST OF THE SHOW,WEREN'T YOU?Ye s .AND ZAIA HAWASS WAS THERE."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Ye s .DID YOU TALK WITH HIM AFTERWARDS? I WOULD THINK THATWOULD BE NATURAL AS EXECUTIVE PRODUCER OF THE PROGRAM.Yes, I did talk with Zaia about it. What did he say? He felt pretty strongly thatthe second stone was blocking something, or hiding something. He was sayingthat based on the fact that the first stone was the initial block and kind of a howdid he describe it? more of an aesthetic block and the second stone seems to be it's not finished and it's more roughly formed. I don't know what he was basingthis on, to tell you the truth, but he seemed to think there might be somethingbehind the second one. I don't really know what he's basing it on because I'mnot sure that the second stone isn't just solid rock, like a regular building stone.DID HE OR ANYBODY SPECULATE WITH YOU EITHER ON OR OFF THERECORD WHAT THEY REALLY THINK WOULD BE THE REASON FORTHE COPPER HANDLES ON THAT FIRST BLOCK WHICH SEEMS SOMYSTERIOUS AS WELL?Well, Zaia did. He thinks they were used to pull the stones into place frombelow. There might have been some rope attached to them and they would havebeen pulled into a closed position from further down the shaft.BUT WHY WOULD THEY MAKE THEM OF COPPER?Well, that was the only metal they had, as opposed to wood or something?YES.That's a good question. I don't know. Dr. Rainer Stadelman who is kind of thedean of Egyptologists in the show, he speculated that they were magic devicesthat the King's soul would have used to move the stone. Dr. Mark Lehner kindof echoes that and says that if it was a false door of sorts, a figurative orsymbolic door, then the handles would have had to appear on it to berecognized as a door. But they certainly wouldn't have been utilitarian in anyway.So, I think that's probably the most interesting theory of all that it still is thismodel corridor for the King's soul to travel to the southern sky as the sun godRa. Until we make some more discoveries, it's hard to say what the best theoryis.IN THIS CONTEXT, CHEOPS WOULD BE LOOKED AT AS A MACHINEFOR IMMORTALITY, A MACHINE FOR THE TRANSFER OF THE SOULFROM THE MATTER WORLD TO WHICH IS IN THE AFTERLIFE?You mean the pyramid (Cheops)?YES.Yes, it was kind of a divine complex where it was in some respects a magicaltrain station, like you are saying. But it's more complicated than that. But yeah,it was kind of a transit place for that King's ka, his vital force. They didn't reallyinterpret it as soul. In a sense, when you boil it down, it is kind of like that.WHAT IS THE NEXT STEP NOW IN THE PROJECT?Well, as you know, there is a northern shaft that goes out of that chamber andthe Egyptians were nothing, if not symmetrical. So just as in the King's chamberabove, there is a northern and southern shaft. The southern shaft for the sun godRa and the northern shaft for the god Horus, God of the Heavens.So, investigating the northern shaft is ongoing.ARE YOU DOING THAT WITH ROBOTS?Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"IS THIS, ARE YOU FILMING AS YOU GO TO MAKE UP ANOTHERDOCUMENTARY?We're documenting it. We don't really have plans right now just because it is anongoing investigation. Because of the nature of the robot, everything is beingshot because that's the only way the scientists have eyeballs up there. It's theonly way to see anything. So, it is all being covered, yes. Hopefully, we're goingto have some interesting discoveries to talk about on that front.WHEN DO YOU THINK THINGS WILL BE READY WITH ANOTHERDRILL TO GO THROUGH THE SECOND DOOR?I don't know that they are actually going to go through the second door. I thinkthat the first very complicated problem is going up there and justify putting adrill into this stone not knowing how thick it is? My guess is that mostarchaeologists are going to say, 'You can't really do that.' There might be a campthat says, 'Look, we know the first one was three inches thick. Why would thesecond one be any different?'So, I can imagine a pretty good academic argument about whether it is justifiableto go up there and just start drilling, not knowing how thick that stone is.Because honestly, until they figure out a technology that can go through the tinyaperture that we created and touch that following stone is and figure out howthick it is, I just don't see it making a lot of sense. What kind of drill bit do yougo up there with? What kind of drill would be able to spin a drill bit that big,that long, and still be small enough and light weight enough so the robot cancarry it up the shaft? There are a lot of serious technological problems that wewould have to solve before we could get to the point where we could drill again.WHAT ABOUT THE iROBOT TEAM DID THEY HAVE ANY IMMEDIATERESPONSE TO THOSE KIND OF QUESTIONS?No, I think everybody was so relieved that the robot had worked at the criticalmoment! This was an incredible challenge and I think everybody finished theprogram with a level of relief that kind of precluded thinking about anything elsegoing on yet, at least as far as that shaft goes. There is a long way to go still.IF THE CHEOPS PYRAMID WAS LOOKED UPON AT THE TIME IT WASBUILT AS A KIND OF IMMORTALITY MACHINE, MEANING THATWHICH WOULD BE USED TO VAULT THE KA OF THE KING TO THISPLACE IN THE AFTERLIFE, WHY WOULD THESE LITTLE CORRIDORSHAVE BEEN BUILT IN CHEOPS AND WHAT WOULD BE THE FUNCTIONOF BLOCKING THESE CORRIDORS IF THE RELATIONSHIP OFEVERYTHING THERE IS TO THE KA, TO THE TRANSFER OF THE SOUL.WHAT PURPOSE WOULD THESE DOORS OR THESE BLOCKS PROVIDE?Good question. The only answer that I can give you that kind of makes sense is there is a theory among some Egyptologists that the utility of something in thislife was directly, had an inverse relationship to how useful it was in the otherlife. So, if you had a stone door that basically ran right into a brick wall, that'suseless in our life. But for them, it was completely useful.MEANING IN THE AFTERLIFE?In the afterlife, yeah. So if you go around to other Egyptian sites and you see thetypical false door that, like for example, in the step pyramid and Zoser's pyramid it's a solid piece of stone. There is nothing on the other side. And yet, it was adoor and it was an essential part of that pyramid because it was through thatdoor that Zoser went to the afterlife. That's the only kind of answer I can givethat is part of that theory.WHY THEN WOULD THERE BE TWO BLOCKS INSTEAD OF ONE?Well, there is it's just endless, isn't it? It just keeps going!The German, Reiner Stottleman, has this theory that there should be three"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"blocks! I don't know the details of his theory very well, but there are threechambers in the pyramid. There is a subterranean chamber, there is the Queen'schamber and the King's chamber up above. There were three blocks closing offthe King's burial chamber from the rest of the world after he was put to rest inthere. There were three granite blocks slid into place.So, his theory, and I'm not doing justice to his theory, is that there should bethree blocks to these shafts! I don't know. I think this is at the heart of why weare also intrigued with the ancient Egyptians because they had this beliefstructure that clearly motivated a whole nation to build I don't know if you havebeen to the pyramids?OH, YES, I HAVE.You know what it's like to stand at the base of Khufu's pyramid. It's justoverwhelming!IF THE MACHINERY OF CHEOPS HAD TO DO WITH THE TRANSFER OFTHE KA LIFE FORCE TO THE AFTERLIFE, THE SUGGESTION IS THATTHE THREE SLABS WERE PUT INTO PLACE BECAUSE THE CHEOPSWAS ACCOMMODATING THE KING, THE QUEEN AND THE THIRDWA S ?The subterranean chamber.WHICH WAS ACCOMMODATING WHO OR WHAT?It's never been clear what its use is for. Nor has it been clear what themisidentified Queen's Chamber was for because the Queen's Chamber was notfor the Queen. She has her own pyramid outside the great pyramid. There are alot of different arguments about what the Queen's Chamber was for. One is thatit was something known as a \"serdab\" which is a room that is only for the King'ssoul that is inhabited by a statue that is imbued with the soul and that is whythat room would require shafts so that the ka could exit. And there is precedentfor that at the step pyramid. At Zoser's step pyramid, there is something calledthe \"serdab box.\"This box, I think, is a granite box and it has two holes in it. The box is tilted atan angle so there is a trajectory towards the stars from this box. Inside the box isa statue of Zoser, which is one reason why some Egyptologists think there mightbe a statue behind the stone door because if theory that the Queen's Chamberwas some kind of serdab held, there is a possibility that maybe there would be alittle statue angled towards the stars. Even that has problems becausetheoretically there was a statue of Khufu in the Queen's Chamber. There is a bigniche there and it's empty. That's an interesting theory and there is someprecedent for a serdab in one of the major pyramids.ALL DEVOTED TO THE IDEA THAT THEN THESE FOUR CHANNELS INCHEOPS WERE NECESSARY FOR THE KA TO HAVE EXITS FROMCHEOPS?Ye s .Reiner Stottleman again citing the pyramid papyri which were found later andwritten later apparently than the 4th Dynasty and they quote Khufu as saying,\"It is distasteful for me to descend out of the pyramid. I will ascend directly toheaven.\"He could have gone out the normal entrance, right? But according to thesepapyri, he had to go direct, if you will.AND WHY FOUR PLACES?Yeah, well two for each chamber. And I don't know go figure! I guess is the bestanswer.WHY WOULD THE STONE BLOCKS IN AN EXIT FOR THE SOUL MAKE"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"SENSE? IT SEEMS PARADOXICAL.Yes, it does. The only think I could do is refer you to the quote from MarkLehner in the movie about this where he says a stone door would not be aproblem for the soul of the King. The stone door is one of the most commonfeatures in every Egyptian tomb. That's how he interprets it, a normal featurehere on a slightly different scale, but a feature that is repeated over and over inevery tomb that you find. So, for Mark, it just fits. It is not a problem for theKing's soul. But this was an unbelievable feat of engineering for them to laythese channels out.WHICH MAKES THEM EVEN MORE MYSTERIOUS BECAUSE HERE4,500 YEARS LATER, WE ARE STILL MYSTIFIED BY THEIR FUNCTION?Exactly. Still trying to figure it out. It is such an enigma! It is just baffling. Noone has a conclusive answer and that was one hope in this investigation to shedmore light on this baffling problem, archaeological problem. You know,honestly, drilling through that second stone may just further complicate theinquiry.BECAUSE DEPENDING UPON WHAT IS FOUND, IF THERE IS A THIRDBLOCK...Exactly!OR A SMALL STATUE OR? IT WOULD STILL NOT REALLY ANSWERWHY THESE CHANNELS WERE MADE.Right.\"We b s it e s :http://www.cheops.orghttp://solos.users.netlink.co.uk/door.htmlhttp://www.magicalegypt.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
