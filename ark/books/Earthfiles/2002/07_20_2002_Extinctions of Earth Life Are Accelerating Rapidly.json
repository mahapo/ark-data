July 20, 2002 Corvallis, Oregon A study by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)was released this month which says that at the current rate of extinctions in 350mammals, birds, reptiles and fish studied by scientists, in the middle of the 21stcentury, the oceans will be empty of marine life, forests will be gone and 25% ofthe world's mammal species could be extinct. Human over-population will havepolluted water everywhere. Supporting this dire picture of the future are the following World Wildlife Fundstatistics that contrast the state of the environment in 1970 with today: More than a third of the natural world has been destroyed by expanding humancivilization since 1970.Over-fishing of the oceans has produced the collapse of the North Atlantic cod.In 1970, there were an estimated 264,000 tons of the fish. Today, that numberhas dropped by 80%, down to only 60,000 tons. That number is expected tokeep going down. The forest cover of our planet has shrunk by 12 percent. Fresh water ecosystems have been reduced by 55 percent. The world's tiger population is down 95%. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Indian Tiger and all photographs © WWF-Canon/MartinHarvey. There are only about 3,000 black rhinos left. In England, several species of songbirds have declined by 90% or more. The WWF report places great blame on the United States of America whereaverage U. S. residents consume and throw away more energy and materials thanany other people on earth. The British are second on the list of consumers. AWWF spokesperson said, \"If all the people of the world consumed naturalresources at the same rate as the average U. S. and British citizen, we wouldrequire at least two extra planets like earth by the year 2050.\" This week I talked about the very sobering World Wildlife Fund report with aprominent scientist and American citizen who has been warning about misuse ofearth resources, destruction of natural habitats and rapidly increasing extinctionsof earth life for many years. She is Dr. Jane Lubchenco, Distinguished Professorof Zoology and Marine Biology at Oregon State University in Corvallis. Dr.Lubchenco received her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1975. She wasPresident of the American Association for the Advancement of Science from1996-1997. She is currently the incoming-president of the International Councilfor Science invited by the United Nations to coordinate the scientificinformation that will be discussed next month in Johannesburg, South Africa atthe August 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development. I asked Dr. Lubchenco, in the context of her long efforts to raise political andcivilian consciousness about the precariousness of earth life in the face of theindustrial world's aggressive spread, what her greatest concern is now in 2002.

I'm a marine ecologist and Iwork with ocean critters and much of what we are seeing in oceans are verydramatic declines and very few people are aware of the magnitude of the loss inoceans. Currently, less than a quarter of 1% of the surface area of oceans is setaside in any kind of protected status. Since we live in a world where people fight over the right to fish in variouswaters, how are we going to get international agreements that are respectedto slow down the over-fishing?That is going to be a major, major battle. There is no doubt about it. As peoplehave selectively removed a lot of the top predators in ocean ecosystems. Thosewould be the sharks, the blue fin tuna, the salmon, the very high carnivorousspecies that are at the top of the food web. In the process of removing those, wescientists think there have been some very significant changes to ocean foodwebs in a way that has collapsed and many of the collapsing fisheries we areseeing around the world are likely to be a result of some of those changes.In fact, sharks and the beluga sturgeon are facing extinction in the next tenyears, I believe.They have been massively over-fished.If they go and when we say extinction, we mean the end of that species.Extinction is forever.If the sharks are facing extinctions, if we see a lot of large marine creaturesliterally disappear off the face of the earth in the next ten years, what is theworst case that could happen in the oceans?You don't have to lose very last individual of a species to see the system begin tocollapse and we are already seeing it beginning to collapse. We are alreadyseeing collapsed ocean ecosystems because we have removed so many of the toppredators.There is also recent information that a whole host of new diseases in corals andother marine critters are appearing where we had no record of them prior to veryrecent times. In many coral reef habitats and this is in tropics on hard bottomareas throughout the world, in many of those places there are very serious otherthreats such as significant over-fishing, pollution from the land both raw sewageas well as fertilizer runoff from adjacent areas destruction of mangroves whichtrap sediments and keep sediments from flowing onto coral reefs. Thedestruction of mangroves is a very serious contributor to loss of coral reefs. So,coral reefs are particularly threatened because there are so many differentfactors, all of which are hitting them at the same time. We are seeing some veryserious loss of biological diversity and collapse of coral reef ecosystems around"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the world and it is very, very serious.What happens to the species in the oceans that are dependent upon coralreefs? If the coral goes, does that mean we are going to accelerate thealready-pressured extinction rates on marine animals?Absolutely. Many of the species that live in and around coral reefs, live onlythere. So if the reef is destroyed, if the corals are eliminated, then in fact thatwipes out the homes and habitats of a whole host of other species. This isanother example of the interconnectedness of species and how you can have aloss of a few key ones that trigger serious losses throughout the whole system.Is it true that the polar bear might be facing extinction in this decadebecause it is losing so much of the ice territory it has depended upon as icemelts so rapidly in global warming?Yes. It is my understanding that polar bears are very seriously threatened rightnow because of the losses of the ice that they depend on to forage for theirfoods. The reports I have seen is that they are very seriously emaciated and invery serious trouble.It is hard to imagine this planet without the polar bear.Ye s .It becomes a metaphor for everything we are talking about.I think it does, indeed. That's absolutely right.When you gather with your scientist colleagues, each of you has a differentfacet of what is happening on the planet. I would assume the mood now isone that is quite depressed?Many, many scientific meetings especially involving scientists who are dealingwith environmental issues are very depressing because most of the news is notvery good news. People who have studied systems for a long period of time areseeing very dramatic changes. They report those and share those and so there isvery serious concern about the future and a tremendous amount of frustrationand an increased willingness to step outside the ivory tower of academia and toshare more widely with citizens and policy makers what is happening because itis so serious and the changes are so dramatic and are happening so rapidly.There is a strong desire on the part of many scientists to help others understandwhat they are seeing and to be as concerned as they are.Is it fair to say that most scientists question whether the earth has asustainable future?I'm not sure that all scientists would say that. Scientists that are field scientistswho have seen very dramatic changes, scientists who work on various aspects ofenvironmental issues are by and large very seriously concerned about theunsustainable trajectory that we are currently on. The National Academy ofSciences in the United States has been championing a whole new focus forscience called Sustainability Science. The report the Academy issued, which isentitled \"Our Common Journey\" says in no uncertain terms that the earth is onan unsustainable trajectory because of the broad sweep of human activities thatare massively modifying the whole life support system of the planet. Thatincludes loss of species as well as global warming, not to mention a whole hostof other things, and it points to the fact that not only are we on an unsustainabletrajectory now, but given the fact that there are an increased number of peopleon the planet.We started this century with 6 billion and by the end of this century, it's likely tobe on the order of 9 to 10 billion people. We currently are not providingadequate food and clean drinking water, even basic necessities, for a goodfraction of the human population. The ways in which we are doing, providingfood and drinking water, are resulting in species extinction, in resulting in"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"increased global warming the way we are creating our energy so the challengesof not only providing the basic necessities to all people down the road, but atthe same time protecting and restoring the ecosystems of the planet that provideour life support systems, is an immense challenge. The reality is that we don'treally know how to do it. We know that what we are doing is not working. Weknow that we need to use more, to switch away from fossil fuels, for example.We know that we need to significantly reduce the waste we are generating. Weneed to use resources much more efficiently, but there are some huge scientificchallenges to figure out how to make that transition to sustainability.Because time is very short! We don't have the luxury of being able to study thisthing to death. We really need to begin to implement some major changes in theway we go about our daily business in a way that is going to allow us to have afuture that has any kind of quality of life.If even the National Academy of Sciences is saying that the future is notsustainable in the current path that we are on, why wouldn't addressing theenvironmental problems jump up to number one in this administration?I can't answer that. It's a very good question.Is it perhaps already too late to change this boat and turn it around?I don't think we have a choice but to try. It's not clear when it will be too late.It's clear that we have already lost a lot of options. And one of the biggestarguments for moving quickly instead of delaying things is that we are likely tohave more options the faster we are moving.In oceans, we have seen that when you create a marine reserve, even in an areathat was seriously degraded, it can come back. So in many situations, there isprobably a good reason to believe that we can do a fair amount of recovery andthat it is worth doing. And sooner is undoubtedly better.If people are worried about jobs and health care and retirement now, thosecould only become worse if the world in the next twenty to thirty yearsbegins to fight over water, land and food.That's exactly right.\"We b s it e s :http://www.panda.org (World Wildlife Fund)http://www.environmentaldefense.org/home.cfm (Environmental DefenseFund)http://www.cmc-ocean.org/ (The Ocean Conservancy)http://nature.org/ The Nature Conservancyhttp://www.pewoceans.org/ (Pew Ocean Commission)Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
