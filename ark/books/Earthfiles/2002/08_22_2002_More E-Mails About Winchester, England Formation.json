A satellite is in a 100-mile orbitaround earth (an example). It is travelling at a velocity thatmaintains its orbit - approximately 18,000 mph or 26,400 feet per second sothat to make a simple circle of 100 feet in diameter, the laser wouldoperate for a 1/264th of a second, but NO, that wouldmake a line across the earth. It would have to have a beamthat spread into a circle with a 50-foot radius instantly -and that is just a simple circle.England is usually very foggy.The biggest issue for a free space laser is fog. While the laser beamtransmits through fog, the moisture particles are so small and dense andlike many tiny prisms to distort and dissipate the signal. This problemmakes the light with information distort and produces an error bit. Althoughthe liquid content of a heavy shower is 10 times that of a dense fog, theradius of a raindrop is about 1000 times that of a fog droplet. This is theprimary reason that attenuation via rain is 100 times less than that of fog.The effects of snow on a laser transmission fall somewhere in between thoseof fog and rain, depending on the degree of water particles in the snow.Even more devastating to holding your writing utensil on target isShimmer: This is the direct result of a combination of factors, includingatmospheric turbulence, air density, light refraction, cloud cover, andwind. The combination of factors will cause a similar disturbance when alaser beam is transmitted through the atmosphere.Then there is the matter of laser energy. The power density required at thetarget site has to be precise so as not to ignite a dry cropand yet penetrate the atmosphere. Even by penetrating the atmosphereand attenuating below ignition temperatures, how is the beam focusedon the lower point of stalks?Some of these arguments also apply to masers.What about using UAVs? More probable than satellites, but stillhaving problems as a hypothesis. UAVs are also in motion, thoughmore controlled than a satellite.Most of these alternate hypothesis come from those who outright statetheir disbelief in the ET-origin hypothesis or some other exotichypotheses involving earth energies or extra-dimensional entities.The crop glyphs (other than the confirmed hoaxes) remain a mysteryto be further investigated, but I think it is highly unlikely thatwe will find a military source behind this phenomenon.Sincerely,Bill HamiltonExecutive DirectorSkywatch International, Inc.We b s i t e :"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"http://www.skywatch-research.orgFiat Lux et Veritas\" 2) On 8/21/02 4:33 PM, JK wrote:\"Probable word for the 'EELIE??E' mish-mash: \"BELIEVE\".

Conceding thepuzzling nature of Winchester and its circumstances, I note the amount ofattention it is legitimately getting, but I wonder if the formation is a deliberatedistraction from something else--what, I don't know--going on in the crop circlephenomenon or the crop circle community. (E.g., what would you have beenmore attention to had this not come up?)It might also be intended to provoke dissension and unfounded speculationwithin the crop circle community by a party or parties unknown with an interestin having the research community in disarray, although I don't see muchevidence that such disarray is occurring.Cheers,\"CC, Texas 5) On 8/21/02 1:32 PM, Richard Brain wrote:\"Hi LindaYour site has a new webpage..http://www.earthfiles.com/news/news.cfm?ID=383&category=EnvironmentThe Braille idea probably is more understandable, if the suggestions fordecoding the damaged area are added from my prior e-mail."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Suggestion 1.
