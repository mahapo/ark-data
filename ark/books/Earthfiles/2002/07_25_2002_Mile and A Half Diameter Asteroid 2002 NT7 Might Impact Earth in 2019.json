K. Asteroid 2002 NT7 currently tops the Impact Risk list of NASA/JPL's Near-Earth ObjectProgram because current calculations place it crossing the earth's orbital path on or aboutFebruary 1, 2019, or other possible later dates. NASA says, \"While this prediction is ofscientificinterest, the probability of impact is not large enough to warrant public concern.\" July 25, 2002 Liverpool, England - The newly discovered potential threat tothe earth in another seventeen years is known by scientists as \"Asteroid 2002NT7.\" It was discovered on July 9, 2002 by researchers from M.I.T.(Massachusetts Institute of Technology) and the Lincoln Near Earth AsteroidResearch (LINEAR) project funded by the United States Air Force and NASA.The goal of the LINEAR program is to demonstrate the application oftechnology, originally developed for the surveillance of earth orbiting satellites,to the problem of detecting and cataloging Near Earth Asteroids (also referred toas Near Earth Objects, or NEOs) that threaten the Earth.

Imagewas photographed on July 19, 2002, with Klet Observatory CCD camera.The fieldof view is 16 to 10 arcminutes with north to the top and west to the right. The LINEAR program uses a pair of GEODSS telescopes at LincolnLaboratory's Experimental Test Site (ETS) on the White Sands Missile Range inSocorro, NM. The telescopes are equipped with Lincoln Laboratory developedCCD electro-optical detectors and collected data is processed on site to generateobservations. Observations are then sent to the main Lincoln Laboratory site onHanscom, AFB in Lexington, MA where they are linked from night to night,checked, and sent to the Minor Planet Center (MPC). The MPC assignsdesignations to LINEAR's new discoveries of NEOs, comets, Unusual Objects,and main belt asteroids.A scientist in England has organized an e-mail network to monitor asteroid andcomet alerts and was the first person to speak out about NT7. Benny Peiser,Ph.D., is a Senior Lecturer in Social Anthropology at Liverpool John MooresUniversity in Liverpool. He is a social anthropologist who studies the affect oflarge events such as asteroid impacts on the earth, environment and socialevolution. Interview:Since July 9, I understand you've had 100 observations of the NT7asteroid. Can you describe what the trajectory seems to be and what thethreat potential is to earth?Given that we only have two weeks of observations, the orbital arc we have sofar is very short and the trajectory is very uncertain. Nevertheless, we can makecalculations about what the probability is of this arc to eventually move throughthe earth. This object has a fairly high rating. In other words, it has a relevantimpact probability. But in all likelihood like in other previous cases, additionalobservations will almost certainly eliminate this potential hazard.Is it true this is the first asteroid to have been given a positive value on thePalermo Technical Scale, meaning greatest potential for earth impactobserved so far?Yes and no. Yes for an object with an impact probability in the near future.There was another asteroid called 1950 DA that actually had an impact datesome 800 years in the future, which also showed up in that category. But giventhat the impact date for that asteroid is some 800 years in the future, it does notreally rank in the same class.February 1, 2019 could be the first potential date of the asteroid's orbital"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"collision with earth?Indeed.If this is on a potential impact with earth in only 17 more years, why has noone reported NT7 before as a possible asteroid threat?Because it has a very peculiar inclination and really only shows up close to theearth in the Southern Hemisphere. And in the Southern Hemisphere, we do nothave any search programs. Because of the asteroid's peculiar inclination and thefact that it comes closest to earth, especially approaching the earth from theSouthern Hemisphere, it has not been spotted. We thought initially that oldphotographs might be archived somewhere that would have this object alreadyon one of the plates. But it might turn out that this is indeed the first time that itwas observed.Is it true that NT7 orbits the sun every 837 days?Yes, that's true.Is it odd that it had not been discovered before July 2002?Not really because so far we have only discovered 600 asteroids in that sizecategory that is, asteroids larger than 1 kilometer in size. This one is twokilometers, about 1.5 miles wide. We expect there to be some 700 asteroids inthat size category which have not been discovered yet. So, we think this is oneof those.You were quoted by the BBC as saying, \"This asteroid has now become themost threatening object in the short history of asteroid detection.\"Yes, I said that. That is true. I should have said potentially the most hazardous.This is only a potential threat. Obviously it is the asteroid that has the highestimpact probability and the shortest impact date and it is fairly large. We've hadsimilar objects in the past with a lower impact probability and a larger warningtime and a smaller size. But this one is a historic first in that it is rather big and ithas a fairly short warning period and a fairly relevant impact probability.How long do you think it will be that enough observations are made forastronomers and physicists to be confident about whether this is on animpact course or not?I expect the object to be eliminated from our list within the next three or fourmonths. As I said, the object will be visible for the next 18 months or so, sothere are many opportunities to follow up the object and to refine the orbit andto almost certainly prove that it's not going to hit.What if the calculations turn out to support an impact?Well, then God help us! This is a very large object that we do not want even tocontemplate hitting us. It would plunge our planet back into stone ageconditions. It would lead to mass starvation on a global level and we don't wanteven to think about these kinds of scenarios which are any how extremelyunlikely.But isn't the reason why there are asteroid searches because of thepotential threat of impact? It has happened in our earth's history before.Oh, absolutely! And it's going to happen in the future unless we take this riskseriously enough and look out for this object and eventually some time in thefuture, we will have to deflect an object that will be on a collision course. It'sjust a question of time. sooner or later, we will find an object, hopefully notsuch a large one that is on a collision course. It might take another 100 or 1000years or tomorrow. No one can tell. Therefore, we need to be prepared.These things seem to keep creeping up on us and being discovered just verysuddenly. We really don't seem to know what exactly is coming through"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"our solar system and crossing near the earth's orbital plane untilsometimes an object has already passed us. What effect would an asteroid1.5 miles in diameter have upon impact with earth?If an asteroid that size would impact the earth, it would throw up so much dustinto the atmosphere and possibly into the stratosphere that the sun would beblocked out for a long period of time, perhaps a whole year or longer. It woulddestroy all the crops worldwide and it would consequently lead to massstarvation apart from the physical damage at the impact. If it were to impact oneof the oceans, all the coasts and all the towns and cities around the coasts wouldbe destroyed by huge tidal waves. We are talking about a global disaster ofapocalyptic dimensions if an asteroid that size were to hit us.However, we should also remember that an asteroid that size only hits the earthperhaps once every one or two million years and there is no reason to believe itwill actually happen right at our generation. The likelihood is extremely smallthat we are the unlucky ones. We've survived for the past 5 million years and Iam pretty confident that we can solve this problem of incoming asteroids in thenext 100 or 200 years. That's the time span I suggest it will take for a planetarydefense system to be established and to work efficiently.But it is a fact, is it not, that currently for the next three or four months noone will know for certain whether the February 1, 2019 or later dates are areality. What happens if scientists calculate and find validity to an impactdate in 2019. Do we have enough time over the next 17 years to do anythingto stop a 1.5 mile diameter asteroid?The short answer is most likely not. Most likely 17 years would not be enoughto develop the technology necessary. However, the human species is very cleverand has always managed so far to escape all the disasters thrown at us. Soperhaps we would be able to do something about it. But currently the estimatesfor an efficient system of planetary protection and deflection program isestimated between 30 and 70 years. But with the advance of technology,perhaps this might actually decrease. If we ever were to face with such ascenario, I'm pretty sure the global, the community would get together and putall the resources into a program that would try to deflect the object long beforeit hits the earth.For those of us who would like to keep track of the NT7 asteroid, what isthe best way to do that on the net?There are a number of websites which update the risk assessment of this andother asteroids on a daily basis. All the observations that come in are put intocomputers and the risks are assessed. The best site in the U. S. is at JPL at theNear Earth Office of NASA. It's a program called Sentry which lists all theasteroids on a potential collision course and that website gives lots ofinformation about all the asteroids currently listed as meriting monitoring orconcern.\" We b s it e s : http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov (Sentry Near-Earth Object Program) http://www.ll.mit.edu/LINEAR/ http://www.klet.cz/"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
