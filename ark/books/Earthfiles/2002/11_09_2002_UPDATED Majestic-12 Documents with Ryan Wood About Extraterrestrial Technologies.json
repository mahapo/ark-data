Also see Earthfiles021202.Updated with maps on November 16, 2002.November 9, 2002 Broomfield, Colorado - Since the mid-1990s, aerospaceengineer, Robert Wood, Ph.D., and his son, Ryan Wood, a mathematics andcomputer science professional, have taken on the challenge of trying to prove -or disprove - the authenticity of several hundred pages of allegedly leaked U. S.government documents about \"flying saucers,\" \"extraterrestrial biologicalentities\" and \"interplanetary\" technologies. Their main source has been a mannamed Timothy Cooper whose father worked at White Sands in the 1940s.Twice Timothy has found in his mailbox a large stash of alleged classifiedgovernment documents from one or more anonymous sources. The latestdelivery was July 2001 and the postmark on the package was \"from Virginia.\"Inside were 23 pages of new documents, not originals, but photocopies of oldonion skin copies of original documents. The tissue-thin onion skin paper hadbled through from the back side making them very difficult to read. Dr. Woodused a magnifying glass this summer of 2002 and painstakingly translated all thepages into clean, easier to read copies at Bob and Ryan Wood'swww.majesticdocuments.com website.This weekend, I talked with Ryan Wood about the content in the latest batch ofdocuments that includes extraterrestrial technology descriptions and a referenceto \"Project JEHOVAH\" analyzed for the Majestic-12 Special Studies Group bythe famous physicist, Albert Einstein, Ph.D., and physicist, RobertOppenheimer, Ph.D, Director of the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. Anothermajor scientist referenced in the latest batch of documents is Edward Teller,who directed the U. S. Defense Department's \"Star Wars\" efforts under theRonald Reagan Administration in the 1980s. The Star Wars goal was to havemilitary ability to destroy any foreign technologies coming from the atmosphere"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"into North America, including nuclear missiles.Interview:Ryan Wood, President, www.majesticdocuments.com, Broomfield,Colorado: \"Edward Teller wrote a couple of papers that talk about UFOsovereignty and our airspace through the state of UFO intelligence operations,problems with current policy and proposed solutions. They talk about UFOs as'space weapons' and recommend changes to the national security estimate.One paper Edward Teller wrote is 'UFO Technology and the Imbalance ofPower.' The first paragraph is kind of neat:\"Today all on earth are close neighbors. The first world which is liberal,the second world which is dictatorial, the third world where changes arerapid and often violent. The fate of all hinges on the development anduse of UFO technology. If we want to understand and influence thefuture, we should review and understand humankind's new tools.\"THIS WAS WRITTEN WHEN?It's undated.BUT YOU THINK IT'S THE 1980S?Yeah, I think it's the 1980s.THAT WOULD BE THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION WHEN TELLER WASHEAD OF (DEFENSE DEPARTMENT'S) STAR WARS?Correct.IN YOUR NEW FILM ENTITLED The Secret - Evidence That We Are NotAlone, - WHICH IS EXCELLENT - YOU GO INTO MANY OF THESEDOCUMENTS. AND ONE THAT YOU AND YOUR FATHER TALK ABOUTIN THE FILM IS A SEPTEMBER 2, 1947 DOCUMENT THAT REFERENCESSOMETHING LIKE GLASS THREADS THAT HAVE PLASTIC CLADDINGAROUND THEM.Right. It's an annual report dated 2 September 1947. The subject is 'FlyingSaucer' and it's to the Commanding General of the Air Materiel Command(AMC) at Wright Field, Ohio. The document is not complete. We just have twopages. But there is a paragraph at the end. It's 'MAGIC EYES ONLY, Subject:Flying Saucer.''Flight instruments and controls are activated by optical wave guidefibers, similar to glass rods except they are flexible and have a plasticcladding wrap. All functions may be operated by touch sensitive ortexture sensing stimuli. Instruments are covered by plastic plate thatseem to be color coded.'"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Paragraph 7 in Research and Development Laboratory, September 2, 1947,\"Analytical Report on the SUBJECT: Flying Saucer,\" to Commanding General,Air Material Command, Wrights Field, Dayton, Ohio, ATTN: AC/13-, Brig.,Gen. C. F. Cabell, Headquarters, Army Air Forces, Washington 25, D. C.When I first read this, I was interested in the linkage to fiber optics and did someresearch on fiber optics and it really was not patented until 1954. This waswritten in 1947.SEVEN YEARS BEFORE.Seven years before and the key breakthrough in fiber optics really is thiscladding wrap. This allows improved signal to noise, it allows you to havesomething effective as a communications tool.THERE IS NO CONFUSION THAT THIS WAS IN THE CONTEXT OFEXTRATERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGY?Yeah, the subject is 'Flying Saucer' on the Analytical Report and that's Paragraph7 in the report. Other paragraphs under 'general description of the craft' say:(1) 'Metallic skin of high polished finish. A comparison of A151 E1112steels indicates that the metals used to construct the craft exceedstructure, chemical compositions and mechanical properties currentlyunder development. Metal specimens were subjected to AISI 8620, AISI3140, AISI 4140, AISI E4340, AISI 5140, AISI 8640, AISI E5Z100, andAISI 430, 410 and 347 machining tests with negative results. (2) Craft designed for high altitude flight. Automatic exhaust orificeswere identified. A gyro-controlled wing stabilizer apparently maintainscraft in a hover mode. (3) Power plant may consist of a spherical reactor (hydrogen isotopetype) connected to propulsion motors. (4) 100 ft. in diameter with central section approximately 30 ft. Centralcabin may have three flight decks: top level for flight control; centralsection for equipment; and lower section for power plant and landinggear. Circular wing may have rotating section and adjustable leadingedge. (5) Top (dome) may have the ability to recede into central section forhigh performance operations. Observation blisters are retract to provideobservation top and bottom of wing. (6) Construction is based on a 6:1 ratio. (7) Flight instruments and controls are activated by optical wave guidefibers, similar to glass rods except they are flexible and have a plasticcladding wrap. All functions may be operated by touch sensitive ortexture sensing stimuli. Instruments are covered by plastic plate thatseem to be color coded. (8) Craft may have all weather navigation capability to allow 'blindflying.' Possible television viewing used.'THIS IS ONLY TWO MONTHS ALMOST TO THE DAY FROM THESO-CALLED ROSWELL CRASHES IN NEW MEXICO?Yeah, we have all of July and all of August. That's right, just two months. Andthey would have been working hot and heavy trying to understand the core"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"technology and write up the results.DO ANY OF THE NEW DOCUMENTS INDICATE A LINKAGE BETWEENTHEIR CONTENT AND ANY SPECIFIC CRASH OR CRASH SITE?Only by implication due to date. It is 16 July 1947 that Nathan Twining, theCommanding General, requested that his people go through and do a detailedanalysis and he wrote a memo on 16 July 1947, and they start doing a bunch ofwork. We see this technical report, this analytical report, and one piece ofevidence.U.S. Army Air Force Headquarters Commanding General Nathan Twining'ssignature on July 16, 1947, communication to Air Defense Command about an\"Incident Report on Flying Discs\" that references \"Proving Ground, New Mexico.\"See More Information below.There is also a more detailed report, the September 19, 1947, known as the'White Hot Report' which was released earlier by Tim Cooper and published onour website at www.majesticdocuments.com. There, it's called 'MissionAssessment of Recovered Lenticular Aerodyne Objects.' It's a 28-page report,double spaced. It's basically the technical and analytical summary of theEisenhower Briefing Document which has been commonly worked by StanFriedman and others.List of contributing members on the Subject Title page, \"Mission Assessmentof Recovered Lenticular Aerodyne Objects,\" dated September 19, 1947. Also known as the\"White Hot Report.\"AND IT'S IN THE 'WHITE HOT' DOCUMENT, RIGHT, THAT THERE ISANOTHER REFERENCE TO SCIENTISTS ANALYZING LINESCONNECTING DOTS THAT ARE ETCHED IN PURE SILVER?Yeah, they are describing the various aspects of what they found. Paragraph 18talks about the elements in the small 'neutronic power plant.'"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Paragraph 18, \"Mission Assessment of Recovered Lenticular Aerodyne Objects,\"references \"small neutronic power plant\" found inside ULAT-1 (Unidentified LenticularAerodyne).And Paragraph 20 says 'the only evident circuitry found on the motor was a thinplastic-like sheet fashioned like platters embossed on the exterior of aspherically shaped casing coated by a thin coating of pure silver.'They are describing this motor. 'Under high powered magnification, it wasobserved a series of fine grid-like lines intersecting groups of dots arranged incircular patterns.'Paragraph 20 of the \"Mission Assessment\" describes in 1947what today is called an \"integrated circuit.\"That description, sounds very much like an integrated circuit of today. What'spowerful is that they chose so many words to describe an integrated circuit. Itjust smacks of authenticity because of its phrasing.BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT WAS.That's right. All they could do was describe what they see.(Some of the documents) are very exotic sounding.Single page document that references PROJECT JEHOVAH under Code WordWHITE PEBBLE MAJCOMSEC INTELLIGENCE EYES ONLY, prepared by MJ-12Group Technical Advisory Panel (MTAP-12) completed on October 2, 1962."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"There is a 1-pager (above) that's called, 'Code Word White PebbleMAJCOMSEC INTELLIGENCE EYES ONLY, PROJECT JEHOVAH.'

Eisenhowerto the Director of Central Intelligence (CIA), dated November 4, 1953.Yes. It was from Ike (Eisenhower) to the DCI. November 4, 1953, TOP SECRET(downgraded to SECRET) to the Director of Central Intelligence. (PresidentEisenhower) is talking about in the opening sentence to the Director of CentralIntelligence: 'I have studied the MJTWELVE Operations Plan of June 16, 1953,on the subject of instructions for the expenditures of the National UFOIntelligence Program, and more specifically, the Special Operations Instructionto be issued to Unified and Specific Major Commands and Commanders.Then in a last paragraph (shown above), it says:'Preferably, I would like to see this done in a closed meeting to bearranged through the Director of the National Security Agency, yourself(Director of Central Intelligence), and representatives of the MJ-12Special Studies Project. I specifically want Project JEHOVAH directorProfessor Albert Einstein and doctor Robert Oppenheimer to inject anyuseful comments to the briefing as they are most informed on the physicsrelated to the subject. Perhaps the annual Quantico conference wouldprovide an opportunity to do this without the publicity which would callattention to such a special meeting. Sincerely, Dwight D. Eisenhower'JUST THINK, RYAN, IF THIS IS LITERALLY TRUE, IT MEANS THAT THEGREAT PHYSICIST ALBERT EINSTEIN, WAS COOPERATING WITH THEEISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION IN THE EARLY 1950S IN TRYING TOTRANSLATE OR DECODE SOME KIND OF EXTRATERRESTRIALBIOLOGICAL ENTITY LANGUAGE OR CODE THAT THEY WEREREFERENCING AS PROJECT JEHOVAH.That's what it seems to indicate. These are the only two documents that are sospecific about Project JEHOVAH. I think these are the only documents that"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"mention Project JEHOVAH directly. Many discuss EBEs and MJ-12 SpecialStudy Project and Einstein and Oppenheimer, but these (Eisenhower November4, 1953 and Code Word White Pebble October 2, 1962.) are the two that talkabout Project JEHOVAH.HAVE YOU OR YOUR FATHER GOTTEN ANY STATIC FROM ANYONE INTHE GOVERNMENT AT ANY LEVEL IN THE LAST YEAR OR TWO ASYOU CONTINUE TO TRY TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF MAJESTIC 12?No. So far, we have been, no one has asked us to stop or bothered us. We haveno indications of concern. Of course, you always have paranoias occasionally,but there is no overt sign of any problem. I honestly think that we are just a cogin the system and we are part of the campaign to desensitize the Americancitizenry to the truth about extraterrestrial and we happen to be specializing indocuments which appeal to somebody who is a little more scholarly orintellectual in their approach to the UFO field and aren't impressed by lights inthe sky or recollections of abduction experiences and things like that.WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS GOING TO TAKE FROM ALL OF THEDOCUMENTS YOU HAVE TO CONVINCE THE NEW YORK TIMES THATTHIS IS SERIOUS?There are lots of people alive who could tell the truth and expose credibly a lotof this, but they suffer incredible penalties. Their pensions would beconfiscated, their livelihoods, they would be thrown in jail. There is the ForeignIntelligence Surveillance Act which you have to have a search warrant, you canshow up in secret and have a federal agent search your house, tap your phone,monitor you, all without due process. It's designed for catching spies, but thequestion is: what is foreign intelligence? Would they consider trafficking in UFOdocuments foreign intelligence?CLEARLY THAT HAS BEEN THE DEFINITION FOR A LONG TIME.You know, so it's very challenging situation to come forward with proof. I amreminded of President Bush's comments to Saddam Hussein when he talks about\"complete and unfettered access to his weapons of mass destruction sites. Andwhat I want is complete and unfettered access to the 631 vault in the NationalArchives. And with a team of archivists for 2 or 3 months to find the truth thatthey are hiding extraterrestrial reality.\"More Information:The following is a partial excerpt of the lengthy and detailed information of aJuly 16, 1947, document from Headquarters Army Air Force CommandingGeneral, Nathan Twining, to Commanding General Air Defense Command.\"This three page bureaucratic report provides the first glimpses of Lt. GeneralNathan F. Twining's Air Accident Report original published in LeonardStringfield's (now deceased) Status Report VII, in 1994. Ryan Wood comments:\"Twining apparently describes in first order detail the inside of a flying disc,everything from the typewriter-like keys that control the propulsion system to athirty-five-foot-diameter doughnut shaped tube,\" possibly filled with heavywater. \"The significance and consistency of the technical content has not beenevaluated, although it is clear that the writing is consistent with 1947 state of theart, not modern.\"\"1. As ordered by Presidential Directive, dated 9 July 1947, a preliminaryinvestigation of a recovered \"Flying Disc\" and remains of a possiblesecond disc, was conducted by the senior staff of this command. Thedata furnished in this report was provided by the engineer staffpersonnel of T-2 and Aircraft Laboratory, Engineering Division T.Additional data was supplied by the scientific personnel of the JetPropulsion Laboratory, CIT and the Army Air Forces Scientific AdvisoryGroup, headed by Dr. Theodore von Karman. Further analysis wasconducted by personnel from Research and Development."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 2. It is the collective view of this investigative body, that the aircraftrecovered by the Army and Air Force units near Victorio Peak andSocorro, New Mexico, are not of U.S. manufacture for the followingreasons: Yellow areas mark locations referenced as \"extraterrestrial craft\" landingor crash sites in MJ-12 documents.

Twining's July 16, 1947accient report states:\"...the aircraft recovered by the Army and Air Force units near Victorio Peak andSoc orro,New Mexico, are not of U.S. manufacture...\" a. The circular, disc-shaped 'planform' design does not resemble anydesign currently under development by this command nor of any Navyproject. b. The lack of any external propulsion system, power plant, intake,exhaust either for propeller or jet propulsion, warrants this view. c. The inability of the German scientists from Fort Bliss and WhiteSands Proving Ground to make a positive identification of a secretGerman V weapon out of these discs. Though the possibility that theRussians have managed to develop such a craft remains. The lack of anymarkings, ID numbers or instructions in Cyrillic, has placed seriousdoubt in the minds of many, that the objects recovered are not of Russianmanufacture either. d. Upon examination of the interior of the craft, a compartmentexhibiting a possible atomic engine was discovered. At least this is the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"opinion of Dr. Oppenheimer and Dr. von Karman. A possibility existsthat part of the craft itself comprises the propulsion system; thus,allowing the reactor to function as a heat exchanger and permitting thestorage of energy into a substance for later use. This may allow theconverting of mass into energy, unlike the release of energy of ouratomic bombs. The description of the power room is as follows: (1) A doughnut shaped tube approximately thirty-five feet in diameter,made of what appears to be a plastic material, surrounding a centralcore (see sketch in TAB 1). This tube was translucent, approximately oneinch thick. The tube appeared to be filled with a clear substance,possibly a heavy water. A large rod, centered inside the tube, waswrapped in a coil of what appears to be of copper material, ran throughthe circumference of the tube. This may be the reactor controlmechanism or a storage battery. There were no moving parts discerniblewithin the (words obscured here). (2) This activation of a electrical potential is believed to be the primarypower to the reactor, though it is only a theory at present. Just how aheavy water reactor functions in this environment is unknown. (3) Underneath the power plant, was discovered a ball-turret,approximately ten feet in diameter. This turret was encompassed by aseries of gears that has a unusual ratio not known by any of ourengineers. On the underside of the turret were four circular cavities,coated with some smooth material not identified. These cavities aresymmetrical, but seem to be movable. Just how is not known. Themovement of the turret coincides with the dome-shaped cupolacompartment above the power room. It is believed that the mainpropulsion system is a bladeless turbine, similar to current developmentnow underway at AMC and the Mogul Project. A possible theory was devised by Dr. August Steinhoff (a Paperclipscientist), Dr. Werner von Braun and Dr. Theodore von Karman as thecraft moves through the air, it somehow draws the oxygen from theatmosphere and by a induction process, generates a atomic fusionreaction (see TAB 2). The air outside the craft would be ionized,thuspropelling the craft forward. Coupled with the circular air foil for lift,the craft would presumably have an unlimited range and air speed. Thismay account for the reported absence of any noise and the apparent blueflame often associated with rapid acceleration. (4) On the deck of the power room, there are what resembles typewriterkeys, possibly reactor/powerplant controls. There were no conventionalelectronics nor wiring to be seen connecting these controls to thepropulsion turret. e. There is a flight deck located inside the cupola section. It is round anddomed at the top. The absence of canopy, observation windows/blisters,or any optical projection, lends support to the opinion that this craft iseither guided by remote viewing or is remotely controlled. (1) A semi-circular photo-tube array (possibly television).(2) Crew compartments were hermetically sealed via a solidificationprocess.(3) No weld marks, rivets or soldered joints.(4) Craft components appear to be molded and pressed into a perfect fit.\" We b s it e :http://www.majesticdocuments.comCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund PolicyCopyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
