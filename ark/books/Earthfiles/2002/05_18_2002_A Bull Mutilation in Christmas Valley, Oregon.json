May 18, 2002 Fort Rock, Oregon - There is a new report from the Lake County,Oregon Sheriff's Office this month of a bull mutilation in the Christmas Valley ofOregon southeast of Bend. It seems to be a continuation of animal mutilations andvery strange aerial lights near the Sand Springs region over the past several decades.One rancher there in 1980 even described seeing cattle drawn up into glowing discsin the sky and dropped back down to the ground, dead and mutilated, the weight oftheir bodies making craters in the dusty soil. Oregon resident, Dwain Wright, talkedwith that Sand Springs rancher and described the incident for me when I wasproducing my documentary Strange Harvests 1993 and my book Glimpses of OtherRealities, Vol. II: High Strangeness (see Earthfiles Shop). Here is a brief excerptfrom that interview:\"And he said they came at night. The cattle were just drawn up. Theyfloated right up off the ground. He had seen it happen. And he said thatsometime later, they just dropped them back when they were done withwhatever. The cattle were dropped back down onto the desert or throughthe trees into the forest. And he said you could hear them at night makinga horrendous crash through the trees.\"Only two weeks ago on May 5, 2002 on a ranch about 15 miles south of SandSprings, a 2400 pound bull worth $2,000 was found in a shallow crater not far fromthe water trough. His owner, Fritz Morrison, has ranched there for thirty-five years.That day, Fritz had been at the water pump at 12:30 p.m. and his bull was layingbeside the trough chewing his cud, seemingly well and content along with severalcows. But when Fritz returned only three hours later to do more work at the pump,this is what he found."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Interviews:Fritz Morrison, Rancher for 35 years, Fort Rock, Oregon: \"I went back out at3:30 p.m. and about 100 yards from the well, right besides the road, there he laydead. I got out and looked at him. At first, I couldn't understand and I walked overto him and his eye on the top side he was laying flat and the eye that was up wasgone and it was bubbling like a fluid and blood.Bull was alive at 12:30 p.m. and found dead and mutilated at 3:30 p.mon May 5, 2002. Left eye was removed, tongue was excised deep within the throat,the testicles and shaft had been bloodlessly removed leaving penis stretched out on theground, and the rectum was cored out. Photograph © 2002 by Keith Bumpass,Deputy Sheriff for Lake County, OregonI touched him and he was plum warm. His legs were stiff as a board, sticking straightout and stiff. And he was plum warm and he should have been pliable, I thought. Ididn't know what had happened. I thought maybe he had been shot in the eye orsomething, but there were no footprints, no tracks, no tire tracks, nothing. So, I wentback and came to the house to get a chain to pull him back off the road so I wouldn'thave to drive right by it every day. And I got back out there around 5:00 to 5:30 p.m.and he had been mutilated. His testicles had been cut off and his butt had been cutout. And I'm sure the blood was completely gone. There wasn't a drop of bloodanywhere he had been cut out. And his penis had been pulled out from inside. Theskin had not been cut from his testicles up to where it comes out in the belly. It hadbeen pulled out from the inside and was hanging out and was real fresh, like maybeI'd interrupted something again. I don't know.Clean, bloodless excision of testicles and shaft leaving penisstretched through hole from abdomen onto ground.

After I drug him off, the next morning I got out there and theground where he had been laying was all sage brush and grass and where he hadbeen laying for about a 50-foot-diameter was completely obliterated. There was nota sagebrush left or a piece of grass or anything. It was just completely gone. Where Idrug him, from where he was out to where I drug him, that ground for about 20 feetwide was just obliterated, just tore up. And all my cows were standing around thisbull out there not all my cows, about 25 or 30 head just standing around like theywere guarding him.Guarding him, or trying to stamp out something they didn't like.Yeah, like making a perimeter around him, just standing there.Fritz Morrison's cows still gathered around the deadand mutilated bull on May 8, 2002 when Deputy Keith Bumpassinvestigated three days after the bull was first found.From May 5 to May 13, about thirty very agitated cows kept trampling sage brushand grass to dry powder (foreground), both at the original site of the bull's death and this spotnear trees where Fritz Morrison dragged the animal to get him away from the road.They were the cows that kept tramping everything down?Yeah, I'm sure they are. It was all cow tracks. I'm sure the cows did it. I don't know"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"what they were doing or why they were doing it. They even dug a couple of holeslike 3 foot in diameter and about a foot deep, rooting it with their heads. And everyonce in awhile, you would see one of them bawling and root the ground for daysafterward.The other thing I noticed that was really odd is that there were a couple of buzzardsthere. They weren't on the animal, but one had come in and sat on him for a minuteand crapped on him and left. But the others that day, there were 2 of them sitting onthe ground like 50 feet away from him. I go out there every day and kind of look athim. He's never been eaten on. There were no flies on him. Nothing touched him,but the cows every night seemed to gather around him about 5 or 6 o'clock and juststand there awhile before they go off and eat, at least for a week after he died.Have you ever seen this kind of behavior by cows around a dead animalbefore?Not like that. Once in awhile when we butcher and we gave some blood with thehide or something, they'll go up to it and bawl and make a bunch of noise and thenthey leave it alone and never come back. They don't do it again and again like withthis bull.Another thing that was a real mystery to me that I still haven't been able tocomprehend was his stiffness. An animal doesn't usually get completely stiff hecouldn't have been dead more if they killed him right after I left (at 12:30 p.m.) itwas three hours maximum and he was just stiff as a board and his legs stuck straightout.Rigor mortis doesn't usually set in until later.Right. That really shocked me, too. I've never seen that.Did you have any veterinarian come and do a necropsy?No, I didn't because this has happened to us before. About 20 years ago(1983-1985), we lost 18 head.Can you tell me about that?The first one we found was right in the middle of a cow trail. The cows had left thewater oh, maybe a couple hundred yards away from the water, right in the trail,laying there dead. And when we found her, she had already been mutilated. And allthe other cows were walking way out around her. Coyotes were walking around herand nothing ever did eat her. She laid there and just dried up.Which parts were taken from her?Her bag, her uterus, one ear had been cut off, and the switch of her tail was gone.And no blood around.In the eighteen mutilations you had, how many were female?All but one. We had one bull and all the rest were cowsIn that bull back in the 1980s, what do you remember about him compared tothis new one in May 2002?It was mutilated the same way, except its penis was gone completely.Did you check to see if the tongue was still in the mouth?No, I did not. (After I asked them to check, he and Deputy Sheriff Keith Bumpassopened the bull's mouth and found that the tongue had been excised from deepwithin the throat, typical of animal mutilations over the past fifty years.)We had another cow up there that was a very unique one. This is the one that is thebiggest mystery, I guess. There was a big sand flat about 60 to 100 acres in size,maybe even bigger than that. But she was laying there. No grass on it, no dirt,nothing, so nothing would go out there. Just a big sandy flat. And we saw a cowlaying out there one day. And we went out there to her. There was not a cow track"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"on that flat. No tire tracks, no footprints, no nothing. And this cow is laying deadout there. She had 3 puncture marks like in a triangle on each side of her rightbehind her front shoulders that went in about 2 inches and dead ended. You couldtake a pencil and stick it in there about 2 inches and it would stop.That's as far as it would go through.This was a triangular patch of the puncture holes.Right. And she'd been mutilated. No blood. No nothing, just dead out there on thatflat. That's probably the weirdest one I think we ever had because the only way shecould have got there is from a helicopter or something like that. She didn't walk outthere. There wasn't a cow track. And there wasn't a tire truck, so she wasn't drug outthere.So, she had to have been dropped or lowered from above some how?That's right. And that was about our third one we found. Boy, we went to packingguns then. That spooked us all. So, I've been so spooked over losing this one here(the bull)! I thought it had stopped. I thought we were done with that kind of thing.We thought it was a devil cult at first. Then when that cow (with the triangle ofpuncture marks) happened, that was terrible. All of ours we had investigated by thesheriff's department. We had a vet come out and we had a doctor look at one ofthem.The only conclusion they could come to was that it was not cut by a knife, that therewas no way anybody could cut that perfect with a knife. And the edges were not likea knife cut. It was more like a laser. This doctor said, 'That looks like a laser cut.'And that was something that started bothering us, too.Something picked that cow on the flat up. We even blamed it on the government. Ihad a theory one time it was aliens trying to study the cow and find out how theycontrolled humans. We take such great care of them. We feed them. We water them.We doctor them. We are like a servant to them. That was my theory! But I don'tknow.We've seen things quite often at night like we have been riding after dark and herecomes this bright red object. It looks like the exhaust of a jet. It's coming right overus overhead and it goes by and we keep waiting for the sound and there never is anysound. But it looks just like jet exhaust, bright red fire.Another time we were out at one of our wells and we were sitting out there and thiscar is coming down the road and he's coming right at us. And just before it got to us,the headlights separated and went around us. And no sound and we didn't seeanything. That was the scariest thing we ever did see in our lives! We wentimmediately, of course.When you went back to that area the next day or so, did you find anythingpeculiar?No, no tracks, no nothing. No tire tracks, not anything. There weren't anymutilations then. We tried like when this was going on, our hired man we had upthere kept seeing strange lights in the sky. He wouldn't go out there after dark. Hewas petrified of it. None of us wanted to do it either, so we stayed away from thereat night.What had he seen that scared him so much?Just these strange lights coming down out of the sky at him when he was out. Wehad to haul water up there. We had a big tanker truck and he said just all of asudden the sky would light up and then it would go away. he never saw anything, hesaid, actually seen anything that was visible to him, his naked eye, other than thisbright light.Like a large camera going off at night and the whole sky lighting up?Yeah, like a flash bulb, is what he said it was like.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Lake County, Oregon Sheriff's InvestigationDeputy Sheriff Keith Bumpass began his investigation on May 8, three days afterFritz Morrison found his dead bull. He took photographs and wondered howanyone, or anything, could have gotten to the 2400-pound bull without leavingbehind some kind of track evidence.Keith Bumpass, Deputy Sheriff, Lake County, Oregon Sheriff's Office: \"It's oneof those things you scratch your head and search for experts. First, we're in an areahere where there is nothing but tractors and things like this and it takes a pretty goodsize tractor to lift up a bull that size. You should have tracks of some kind ofmachinery. So, for this bull to be laying out in that pasture with no tracks around it,it's beyond our comprehension.What about something from the air?I thought something like that. Carrying the animal if you did, you'd most likely seelike you see on television, using straps and stuff. So you would think you wouldhave some kind of rub mark around the body of the area if a helicopter had lifted it.But Fritz don't live very far from this animal and he's got a pretty good view of thiswhole thing and he would have noticed helicopters because we have like Life Flighthelicopters that come over the mountains and you can hear it from miles away as itcomes over. I asked him if it could be a helicopter. And he said, 'No, I would haveheard it being so close to the home.' And also, even if you have a silent typehelicopter like many of the militaries have, you're still going to have down wash ofthe wind. We looked for stuff all over those trees, for dust or anything out of theordinary, and we couldn't find anything anywhere. That would be the onlyalternative something dropping this animal. I guess, it would have to be a prettygood sized aircraft to do so.Did you talk with anybody around where he lives about whether or not theyhad seen anything unusual at night?Fritz has seen, different weird lights. I personally have seen some lights one nightwhen I was coming down the road not too far from where this bull was found. Atthat time, I was driving a hay truck loaded with a load of hay. I was coming backempty and I remember seeing 3 big lights really low to the ground. It was a verybright night, the kind of night where we would get out and look for miles and miles.So I thought there might have been low level maneuvers. The military has a base, asmall base in Klamath Falls which is about 110 miles south of here. I thought theymight be doing that. As it came towards me, the lights shut off approximately 1/4mile in front of me. So, I stopped the truck, jumped out and turned the truck off tohear the rumble of the (aircraft) engine as it went by. I couldn't hear anything. Therewas no rumble. There was no aircraft going by. So, I kind of chalked it up and didn'ttell many people about it.What color were those lights?Almost like a lithium blue, like these new lights you see on cars, the headlights.About that color. And they were big and perfectly apart. When I was looking atthem, it looked about 2 feet on the left, one in the middle and 2 feet on the right.And they were all the same size coming straight towards me.In an equilateral triangle, then?No, it was actually straight across from each other in a straight line. That's why Ithought it might be an aircraft. But there is no way within a few seconds of when Istopped that truck and jumped out. Shut all my lights off to see what kind of, if itwas a big C-130, there was no way it could have got past me because it was comingright toward me real slow.And it just disappeared?Yeah, it was like it wasn't there. And I thought, 'What?!' Other than that, there have"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"been other farmers that have seen quite a few lights in this area, just different typesof lights.We're talking about a bull mutilation that occurred on May 5. When did yousee the three lights that you described and have farmers seen anything in thepast month or so?The only lights I've seen are about two years ago. Recently, here was a farmer by thename of Pat O'Keefe who has property right next door to Fritz Morrison. Pat about amonth ago seen some lights up above the hill on his place. He thought he might havebeen someone flashing a flashlight or something, so he went up the next day to lookat it and to see what was up there. He didn't see any footprints, but he did find askull, or actually a whole head of a dog, he believes, like a red ...Like an Irish setter?Yeah, the Irish setter type of dog. We went up to look for it. It had been beheadedright in front of the front shoulders, he was telling me. He lived on this ranch sincehe was a kid and he's in his late 50s now. He's seen all kinds of animals, but this oneraised the hair on the back of his neck because the head had been cut perfectly rightin front of the shoulders, this dog. And a pretty good sized dog, he said. And it wasdone pretty much like a precision knife had done it. He was a meat cutter by tradefor almost 40 years. And he goes, there is no way I could have duplicated this cut atall out here in the field.And there was no blood and nothing had touched it. And he said there was no dirton it! And up here in the desert, we have a lot of powdery dirt and had it beendropped from the sky or anything, there would have been dirt in the wound area,.So, he said that really baffled him and he noticed his dog wouldn't even go aroundit. He just kind of backed out of there and left.We went up there yesterday to look for it, but unfortunately couldn't find theanimal. He said he wasn't even going to say anything about it until Fritz said his bullhad been mutilated. They are going to go up and look for it tomorrow also.The only thing that was there was the clean, fresh severed head of what hethinks was a red-haired dog, but no body, no tracks no dirt, no anything?No drag marks. Like if a cougar will kill an animal up here, it will actually drag theanimal. Nothing. It was the head, neck and all the way to the front shoulders of thedog, so there was quite a bit there. He said almost like a vampire has real big long,long teeth? He said these went down past the bottom of the jaws and most animals,the teeth don't do that. They were all the way down past the bottom of the jaw.Usually when a dog's lip closes, it hides its teeth. But these went way past there andhe said he had never seen that before. So, we're going to keep looking for the thing.Hopefully we can find it.One mystery on top of another mystery.It is. It's just baffling.Have you or the sheriff tried to contact any of the military authorities in theOregon area to ask about the situation and learn if the military has anyinformation about animal mutilations? (Oregon has national guard units, not amajor military base.)No, not yet. I'm kind of doing the lead investigation. We're a gigantic county of 8,800square miles with only a few deputies, so our hands are full. I'll slowly start doingthat and kind of pursue to see who else has seen this and find out what otherinvestigations they have done that might help us.Fritz Morrison and others had cattle mutilations in the 1982 to 1985 period.Fritz alone had 18 mutilations then. You've worked for the Lake CountySheriff's Office four years. But you and your colleagues were not aware ofanimal mutilations much and your office apparently doesn't have much historyabout the phenomenon?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Exactly. That surprised me. And the farmers who have mentioned the mutilationsand have lived here a long time and they say, 'Oh, is that starting back up again?'You would think each sheriff passing the baton to the incoming sheriff wouldsay, 'Look, there is a problem here that comes in cycles. This is what it is and itis baffling. We've never been able to arrest and arraign anyone. So you need toknow some facts.'Yeah, it's sad to say I can't say what they were like in the past, but we havetechnology today that they didn't have access to back then and with me, instead of, ifI don't know the answer, I don't chalk it up to some critter eating something. I've gotto research it to the point that if I can't explain it, then it has to be something out ofthis world.Why do you think your office and other law enforcement contacts don't havemore information about animal mutilations?I don't know if it's because people don't want to research it or because they can'texplain it and feel inadequate, or they always want to be able to prove somethingand when they can't, sort of set it aside. I really don't know. It's kind of hard toexplain why people haven't followed up because you are talking losing a lot ofmoney with these farmers when these things happen. Like with Fritz, he lost 18 thefirst go around and now the bull. That's a lot of money.If it is a persistent mystery and has happened to a lot of ranchers, why wouldthis phenomenon not be a priority from the Governor on down? And at thefederal level?You would think it would be. There should be a lot of research. It's costing peoplemoney. It's not a disease. It's some thing doing this. It baffles me that people inhigher positions in the military or whatever don't care about this stuff. Or they knowand care and are not saying anything. These poor farmers need to be reimbursed orsomething for the loss of their animals. It's not a natural death, that's one thing. Youare talking basically murder, or animal abuse in the 1st degree, so you're talkingcrimes here. There should be a lot more done to try to figure out what's going on.\" Laboratory Analysis of Physical EvidenceDeputy Bumpass gathered soil and grass samples from the original site where FritzMorrison first found his bull dead at 3:30 p.m. on Sunday, May 5. He also foundsmall black particles on the bull's hair. All were shipped to biophysicist W. C.Levengood in Michigan. Levengood has been studying biophysical and biochemicalchanges in grasses for ten years related to crop formations and animal mutilationsites. He studies plant respiration at the mitochondria level and has found a patternof stress in plants sampled at crop formation and mutilation sites. His hypothesis isthat a plasma vortex - spinning ions - with energies that include microwaves interactwith the animals, plants and soils. But to date, the source of the plasma vortex isunknown.Preliminary Data:W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, GrassLake, Michigan: \"When Deputy Bumpass talked to me about getting samples, Irecommended that he look very carefully at the hide of the bull all over and to sendme any black samples that he could find from the bull. It was a black bull, butremarkably he did find some around the excised anal area.I conducted a microscopic study of this yesterday and today and it revealed ahomogeneous mass. I looked at some of these small particles. I still have some left.(They were) slightly red in color at the edges, otherwise opaque. Pretty similar towhat we found before. (See Earthfiles 09/07/01 and 07/28/01)Meaning pure hemoglobin particles?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Yes. I did my hydration, dehydration test. After about 20 hours, the dehydration hadoccurred and at the edge of the cover glass I found the same stressed crack patternsin a pale, red matrix, hardened matrix, we have seen before that is typical of the purehemoglobin. I think there is a high probability even if we can't say for sure yet that itis pure hemoglobin.If analytical chemistry does confirm that these particles are pure hemoglobin,what do you think could be the process for a bull that weighs 2400 pounds in aremote pasture in Christmas Valley, Oregon, to end up with dried hemoglobinparticles on its hair?First of all, this is a very sophisticated kind of energy application. As I've said manytimes, I do not think the blood is removed. I think it is disintegrated, or at least thecomponents of whoever, whatever, however this is done, the hemoglobin might beone of the major components that they are interested in. We don't find a lot ofhemoglobin. We've found damn little! But what we do find is absolutely pure andthat takes some very sophisticated biochemical procedures that I don't know ofanyone or any way that these could be done in a field out in a pasture.\" More Information:See my books and documentaries in the Earthfiles Shop.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expressly prohibitedwithout prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
