Smith, Freedland Publishers \"A Benson, Minnesota farmer fed his cow and later returnedto his barn to turn out the lights. He discovered the cow mutilated'inside the barn.' A mutilation in South Dakota left a steer with the lower jawremoved and some tissue cuttings so delicate that veterinarians maintained itwouldhave taken them two weeks to perform the same type of surgery.The animal was found 200 feet behind the owner's barn.\"- Brush Banner, Brush, Colorado, September 10, 1975. Chapter 2, Part OneBlueprint for Confusion \"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,Than were ever dreamt of in your philosophy.\"- Hamlet by William Shakespeare attle mutilations have provided a basis for every conceivable theory. MargaretMaul at the Colorado Cattlemen's Association has heard hundreds of them. Oneperson explained at length and in great detail who the mutilators really are. Oneof the insiders is Henry Kissinger. Many people, she says, have thought thewhole thing was exaggerated Cattle couldn't be mutilated like the stories say.but after seeing with their own eyes what's been done to one of their neighbor'sanimals, or to one of their own, they suddenly become believers. The physicalpresence of the actual facts has a profoundly enlightening effect on ranchers,farmers and most lawmen.Everyone vaccinates for blackleg and other common cattle diseases. Ranchersand sheriffs, most of whom were raised on ranches, claim to have been able torecognize common livestock diseases from childhood. No, what they've beenseeing here is something completely different, something no one they know hasever seen before.Local vets who have been at the scene of mutilations have not come up with anyanswers. They send off tissues and specimens, but that never providessatisfactory answers, either. It's true that most vets have tried to shun thosecases. According to one sheriff that is so they won't have to testify in court.There is nothing to the insurance angle either. Few stockmen were insuredagainst \"vandalism.\" Four claims are known to have been paid in Colorado, andthey come to less than $300 each, according to The Denver Post on September15, 1975.The few carcasses that were taken to be examined at Colorado State University(CSU) were skinned out, the flesh and hide examined for wounds, bruises, orholes that could have been caused by injections or darts. None to which deathcould be attributed were ever found. then the vital organs, hearts, brains, livers,kidneys and so on are removed, cut into slices and examined. The process takesthree men about an hour. In one case, for example, the sheriff who had brought"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"in the carcass and was watching the examination, says a small spot was found onthe brain. That later became the \"cause\" of death.He has also watched autopsies on humans where the probable cause of deathcould be more accurately determined. In humans, it is natural for various organsto have anomalies, or even be in an advanced state of deterioration withoutbeing the immediate cause of death. The pathologists who actually did thedissections usually admitted they did not know the cause of death in the animalbrought in to them. Yet, when the report comes back from up front, the cause ofdeath is usually very clear and prosaic - you can read it in the professionaljargon right there on your yellow carbon copy!The most significant autopsies were done on the bison at the CheyenneMountain Zoo. The carcasses were fresh, the weather was cool. As displayanimals, they were more valuable than meat animals, and this was a matter ofpublic rather than private interest. The zoo's veterinarian, who could beexpected to be familiar with exotic as well as common animal diseases, spentmany hours studying every aspect of the deaths. The county coroner examinedthe carcasses and tissue specimens were submitted to the state lab for analysis.Everything appeared very strange and unprecedented. No disease or cause ofdeath for the mutilated animal was ever found, and residents of the area thinkthe animals were killed by a laser, a theory that neither CSU nor the CBI hascome up with yet.In a number of cases, other animals in the herd die mysteriously within a shorttime, as though they had also been effected somehow. This has been observed ina number of cases, including a report from Balch Springs, Texas on September15, 1975. Maybe they had barely been caught in the edge of the killer beam.The second buffalo cow died the day after the first mutilated one wasdiscovered, and a third animal died the day following that. This was the entireyearly death rate within three days, none of which could be accounted for. Thesecond buffalo was seen passing blood in great quantities. Since it might have acontagious disease and also was very weak, the animal was destroyed and anautopsy immediately performed on it. It had \"hemorrhagic enteritus,\" internalhemorrhaging, as had been observed externally. The third animal was founddead and a coyote had chewed on its udder, according to The GazetteTelegraph on November 21, 1974 in Colorado Springs. Very precise surgicalbites had been taken and never once was flesh torn or left the least ragged orbloody, we presume.The heifer mutilated on Jim and Roma Lee Russell's ranch just off the highwayseveral miles west of Kiowa was one of the earlier Colorado cases. Soon afterthe mutilation, three more animals died there under mysterious andunexplainable circumstances. One was a 600-pound steer that began goingdownhill immediately after the mutilation. Neither Jim nor his neighbors nor thelocal vet had ever seen anything like it. The steer never lost its appetite and atewell until the day of its death. But it quickly lost weight until it was only skinand bones. The skin became dry, hard and leathery, cracking open with largeblack splits all over. The skin became so hard, it was impossible to inject it withanything.The two other deaths were sucking calves. One had not been born when themutilation occurred. Both had good appetites until death, but they lost flesh asthough they had been starving. No one has been able to come up with anexplanation.Another unusual aspect of the phenomenon is the lack of blood. At first, it wasgenerally believed that all the blood was somehow being pumped out before theanimals were mutilated. In some cases, that might have happened, although nojugular veins are known to have been cut. Anyone with butchering experienceknows it is impossible to cut a fresh carcass bloodlessly unless it's been bled outwell. And some of the mutilations had to have been done immediately afterdeath because they were still warm when they were found, according to TheDenver Post on September 8, 1975, the Ranchland Farm News in Simla,Colorado on August 28, 1975 and The Brush Banner in Brush, Colorado on"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"August 16, 1975. Yet, in almost all cases, the cuts have been perfectly clean andfree of blood, and blood is not found on the ground.The lack of blood at the site, as well as the fact that there is seldom evidence ofthe least movement, or the struggle that even an animal that's been shot directlyin the brain always makes, has led many to believe that they had to have beenpicked up, cut, and then laid back down on the ground again. This is what theRussells are sure must have happened to their heifer. She was found lying in adry shallow sandy stream bed a short distance from the house with soft sand inevery direction from her for at least ten feet. Yet, there was not a single track inthat soft sand to explain how she had gotten there unless she had been dropped.A back leg was broken and the head was twisted oddly as though that is whathad happened. Her calf was almost due and she had been cut so that it wasexposed inside her, but it was not taken. Otherwise, it was a \"standardmutilation.\"A number of ranchers believe the animals are picked up, mutilated, then putdown again. How else can the complete lack of tracks in sandy, dusty or muddyareas be accounted for? One large bull that was apparently dropped had all fourlegs broken. What kind of a predator might have done that? the report asks,according to The Denver Post on August 27, 1975. A number of cases where theanimals were found outside the fence or somewhere else they could not havegotten by themselves are equally unexplainable.Two cows mutilated in Park County \"couldn't possibly have been where theywere found unless they had been dropped from aircraft,\" according to SheriffNorman Howey, as described in The Gazette Telegraph in Colorado Springs onSeptember 17, 1975. The two dry cows were found half a mile apart in adifferent pasture than the one their owner had left them in. The pasture theywere found in was where only cows with calves were being kept. \"There were nostrange tracks nor footprints,\" the sheriff said. \"On top of that, the gate waspadlocked.\" The cows had been operated on in the \"traditional manner\" with notrace of blood at the scene. One cow's bladder, however, had been \"popped\" outof its body where the rectum had been excised. Internal pressure from thepresumed fall is believed to have caused that.Some animals, including large bulls, have been felled as though by a massivehammer. Others appear to have dragged themselves a short distance, or as muchas several hundred yards. This was seen in several instances, according to theElbert County Country Squire on July 24, 1975 in Elizabeth, Colorado, and\"unusual in that large quantities of blood were visible at the site,\" according toRanchland Farm News in Simla, Colorado on July 17, 1975. Mutilated animalshave been found in ponds, straddling ditches, tightly wedged between largerocks, and lying bloodlessly next to large trees where no helicopter couldpossibly have placed them.Sgt. Martinez, a sheriff's deputy and \"experienced investigator,\" told of amutilated cow near Canon City. \"It was weird, - like maybe the blood was allsoaked out. The cut around the face had to be made with a knife. The cuts weretoo clean. If you shoot an animal, it thrashes around before it dies. This cowdropped where she stood, just as if she had been drugged first. The animal putup no struggle. There were no tracks showing it had been in any death throes oranything like that. It dropped. Its head hit a small twig as it went down, brokethe twig and that was it. That was the only indication of any disturbance in thearea. It was awful rugged country in that canyon. I almost broke a leg trying toget down there in the daytime. Trying to get down there in the dark would bealmost impossible. And to make those cuts in the dark - well, I just don't believeit,\" he was quoted in The Pueblo Chieftain, Pueblo, Colorado, on October 14,1975.The when and where of cattle mutilations are equally mystifying. Most areprobably done at night, but some are known to have been done in the daytime.At least one was done in a snowstorm, according to The Gazette Telegraph,Colorado Springs, on June 13, 1975. One of the most recent in Elbert Countywas right beside a fairly busy road. The school bus had gone by in the morning"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"without seeing it. In the afternoon, it was right there, too obvious to miss. Howcould that have been done in such an exposed place without it being seen? It'svery common for mutilated animals to be left in exposed places where they can'tbe overlooked and where the mutilators could also be easily seen, too, onemight suppose. Or they might be found miles from an access road.The Russell's heifer was left in a very obvious place in sight of the house.Knowing it was ready to calve, Mrs. Russell had been watching it and had goneby that spot several times a day. If it had been there, she does not know how shecould have missed it. Mutilations have occurred in barnyards, very close tohouses. A Benson, Minnesota farmer fed his cow and later returned to his barnto turn out the lights. He discovered the cow mutilated 'inside the barn.' Amutilation in South Dakota left a steer with the lower jaw removed and sometissue cuttings so delicate that veterinarians maintained it would have taken themtwo weeks to perform the same type of surgery. The animal was found 200 feetbehind the owner's barn. (The Brush Banner, September 10, 1975).The buffalo at the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo must have been about 50 yards froman expensive two story home. One investigator claims there have been tenmutilations within the Ft. Worth, Texas city limits, according to the The BrushBanner on September 10, 1975. The cow was mutilated for NORAD directly infront of its big entrance gate to the world's most heavily guarded super secretinstallation. Two others, the only reported cases in Jefferson County, weremutilated near the gate to the Rocky Flats hydrogen bomb manufacturing plantimmediately northwest of Denver, according to The Denver Post on October 24,1975.One widely publicized aspect of the phenomenon has been the occasions whenit has been found impossible to photograph a mutilated carcass. \"A welldocumented instance was that after several attempts, both Morgan County andWashington County officers were unable to take a photo of the carcasses with aPolaroid camera. \"We even checked the bodies for radiation,\" admitted Jones,Washington County Undersheriff. The photographs were consistently dark andeven when the camera settings were changed to compensate for the conditions,the pictures were without contrast. A flash attachment was then used and still,the Polaroid failed to provide a usable photo. \"I can't explain it and I'm notgoing to try,\" he told The Brush Banner on July 30, 1975.Hundreds of photographs, of course, of mutilated carcasses have been taken.One sheriff, after showing some excellent black and white Polaroids, said onecould not take colored photos at a site. I asked a newspaper man in the area whowas also a photography expert about that remarkable circumstance. He thoughtit was just due to \"pilot error,\" although he had never photographed a mutilatedcarcass himself. Those officers had bad film and few sheriff's departments arecompetent to take the colored photos that require more expertise, especially indeveloping.That might be too easy an answer, however. Law officers take lots of pictures intheir line of duty. They have good equipment and there is no reason to supposethey aren't able to operate it. Very good photos can be taken with inexpensiveequipment by people who don't know any more than how to roll the film aheadand push the button. would sheriff's departments in two different counties bothcome up with bad film at the same time and place when they had neverexperienced that on other occasions? That could happen, but it would be a rarecoincidence. There seems no doubt but that mutilation areas are closelymonitored from above. it would be equally feasible for the high energy beamrequired for that surveillance to be focused so as to make picture taking difficultor impossible.Another surprising thing is that some carcasses have been mutilated at leasttwice.
