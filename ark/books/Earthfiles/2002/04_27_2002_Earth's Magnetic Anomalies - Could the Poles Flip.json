The structure changesdramatically in the liquid core below the mantle where the magnetic field isgenerated by the convection of the core's melted iron. Graphic courtesy GaryA. Glatzmaier, EE-IGPP, Los Alamos National Laboratory andPaul Roberts, University of California-Los Angeles. April 27, 2002 Cambridge, Massachusetts - Deep beneath our feet as wewalk around in fact, 4,000 miles down is the center of the earth where an ironcore is so hot it is liquid and boils around like cooking porridge. That moving,melted iron also produces the magnetic fields that surround the earth and uponwhich much of earth's surface life, satellites and space technology depend uponfor orientation, and for protection. If magnetic fields did not trap highlyenergetic particles racing from the sun, all kinds of damage could be done toliving organisms and space technologies. For nearly a million years, magneticfield lines have been coming out of the south pole and entering the north pole ofthe earth. That is called the magnetic dipole.Now a science team from Paris, France led by Gauthier Hulot at the Institute ofEarth Sciences in Paris - working with other scientists such as HarvardUniversity's magnetic field expert, Dr. Jeremy Bloxham - have compared satellitemeasurements of the earth's magnetic field strengths 25 years ago and today.Their discovery was published in the April 2002 science journal Nature and itboils down to this: there are strange and not very well understood variationsnow in the earth's magnetic field. In fact, down in South Africa there is a largeregion that already has a magnetic field pointing in the opposite direction fromthe rest of the earth's field and is getting stronger all the time, according to newsatellite data.Further, the north and south pole magnetic fields have weakened in strength byabout 10% of what they were. If the South African region continues to getstronger and the poles keep weakening, scientists think that within the next"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"millennia, the pole magnetic fields could disappear altogether, or flip so themagnetic field lines would leave the north pole and enter the south pole.Meanwhile, could magnetic field anomalies and changes in strengths andgeographical locations persist during a transition period to an unknownoutcome?Based on ancient rock studies, geophysicists can say that such a situationhappens three or four times every million years. There can even be a periodwhen there are many magnetic poles all over the planet, not just at the poles.But no one knows for certain what the implications are for earth life andtechnology because it hasn't happened since 780,000 years ago.Recently, I talked with Dr. Bloxham's graduate assistant, Mathieu Dumberryfrom Canada, who specializes in the dynamics of the earth's iron core. I askedhim if the last time a pole reversal occurred was nearly a million years ago,wouldn't that mean current surface life, including humans and geophysicists,have no idea what actually happens if the poles reverse? Interview:Mathieu Dumberry, Graduate Assistant to Prof. Jeremy Bloxham,Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Harvard University,Cambridge, Massachusetts: \"That's correct. The consequences for human life,in terms of what the actual exact sort of strength decrease in the overallmagnetic field is and in terms of what the consequences are for the solarparticles that are trapped in the magnetic field of the earth is, we don't reallyhave a good idea on that.The magnetosphere plays such a strange and mysterious, but importantrole between the ionosphere, outer space and here on the earth. There areaurora borealis and all kinds of magnetic field effects. If the North andSouth poles suddenly changed and the magnetic fields were coming out ofthe North Pole and entering the South Pole, wouldn't you think there mightbe some dramatic effects on earth life?I think the most dramatic effects might occur during the reversal that is when thestrength of the dipole field is going to be the weakest. Because if the dipole isoriented one way or another in terms I'm thinking in terms of the solar particlesthat are trapped in the magnetic field therefore, don't reach the surface of theearth. These sort of high energy particles could be damaging to life on the earth.If these particles are trapped by the fields, they don't reach the surface.However, if the strength of the dipole field decreases, then the ability of themagnetic field to stop these highly energetic particles is weakened. And so thismight have an affect on life.But, as I said earlier, 780,000 years ago when it happened, of course, we did nothave human society as we have now today, but the creatures that lived then interms of humans and other animals have survived.Some have. But there have been periods of unexplained extinctions in thehistory of the earth. If I understand what you are saying, strong solarparticles could be able to reach the surface of the earth uninterrupted bystrong magnetic fields as they are deflected today. Such energetic particlesreaching the surface of the earth unimpeded could do damage on thesurface during the collapse of the magnetic dipole?Yes. But again, I can speculate on the strength of the magnetic pole much betterthan the affects on biology. But I would say that since these big mass extinctionevents one we know occurred 65 million years ago and another one more like250 million years ago these mass events if you postulate they were caused by themagnetic field reversal, then you have to explain why in all reversals since Imean, there have been reversals it seems there are reversals in the magnetic field"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"two or four times every million years. So now you have to ask why there haven'tbeen any mass extinctions when all the other reversals occurred?That's a comforting point, given the fact that all of you are already pickingup anomalies in the magnetic fields that suggest, as the French scientistshave said, 'We know that something is happening and we speculate that weare in an unusual situation that might be related to a reversal.' Those arewords of Dr. Hulot.Yes. It's quite possible that this is happening, that we are in the middle of areversal, at least at an attempt at reversal. But you know, we might also find thatin 500 years that this small reverse patch (in South Africa) has shrunk and didnot succeed in creating a reversal. We don't know, because the time scale ofthese magnetic field changes seems to be on the order of 300 to 500 years. It'sdifficult to say at this stage whether this is a feature that will definitely lead to areversal of the dipole.Have you talked with Dr. Bloxham (Harvard) about the entire issue thatyou and geophysics could be sitting on data that as the time line evolves inthe future could become extremely relevant to earth life? So far modernhumans have never experienced a magnetic field reversal nor thedisappearance of the North and South poles.Well, absolutely. It's essentially the reason why we study the magnetic field. Initself it's interesting from a mathematical point of view to understand thedynamics of how the field is generated. But in terms of human societyperspective, the reason why we study the magnetic field is because it has aninfluence on our life and on our future. Yes, that is essentially why we arestudying the magnetic field of the earth and its changes.\"What about aerospace and satellites and military applications? Wouldn't achange in magnetic fields affect a tremendous amount of earth technology?Yes. Fortunately these changes are occurring slow enough. The typical life timeof a satellite is probably not going to be affected. But when we launch a newsatellite, if we are aware of a changed magnetic field then probably during thelife time of the satellite, (we would build the satellite) to operate functionally.However, it's sort of ironic that the satellite which was used to produce the dataand comparison between the last satellite mission...Data was compared from two different satellites, one with data from 25years ago and one that is current, to find these magnetic anomalies,correct?Yes, so the current satellite mission (ERSTED) was originally built and theinstruments were built to withstand a certain strength of the magnetic field.However, now trying to establish how the growth of the sort of reversedmagnetic field patch in South Africa is growing, it is actually growing faster thanthe people who built the satellite originally thought. So, now the field might betoo strong to really operate well. So, it's ironic that one of the reasons to launchthat satellite mission was to monitor the growth of that field and now the fieldhas grown to a point where it might be hard to measure accurately now.Do any of you, whether it's based on speculation or hard data, have anyidea when we reach a threshold in these magnetic field changes in whichthe North and South Pole fields are weakening and other areas on theplanet such as South Africa are getting stronger do you know at whatthreshold these changes in the magnetic fields can affect earth life?I would say currently no. What we see from the data is what the magnetic fieldsappear at the surface of the core. We have no idea what is going on inside thecore. We do have an idea because we are producing mathematical models thatmimic the generation of the magnetic field. So, by comparing what we see in thedata to what we see in the results of the models, then you can guess, 'If we seethis pattern of magnetic field at the surface, then this means what is happening"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"inside.'To answer your question, essentially we don't really know for sure if we see acertain pattern at the surface that it means something directly that we can sort oflook at the future 500 years or 1000 years and be certain, 'This is what is comingup.'\" We b s it e :http://www.psc.edu/science/glatzmaier.htmlCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
