Drawing by LisaDusenberry, fromGlimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses © 1994 by Linda MoultonHowe.December 28, 2002 Jamison, Pennsylvania - When I was in Peru in June1987, I heard about tall beings with copper red hair, crystal blue eyes, and verywhite skin that were seven to eight feet tall, or taller. The man who told meabout them was an archaeology student whose father worked as a traveling nursein the rural areas of Peru. Edwin Flores told me that his father had traveled in1981 to a remote village called Pillpinto, six hours by car from Cuzco. When hereturned, he asked his son why \"very tall Irish people\" were living in the ruggedmountains. His father explained that he had seen them at the outskirts of thevillage. Flores said his father had not been back since 1981 and he didn't knowif the \"tall Irish\" were still there. I proposed that we go to Pillpinto and find out.It was a difficult road, climbing most of the time, with hairpin turns. We werestopped twice by security police. I didn't learn until later that we were drivingright toward one of the hide-outs of the Communist-inspired rebels known asthe \"Shining Path\" who had been blowing up trains and buildings in Peru. Flores"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"explained to the police that I was an American documentary filmmaker andwriter investigating information about extraterrestrial phenomena and that wewere looking for \"tall Irish\" living near Pillpinto. We were surprised when thepolice said. \"Si!\" They knew about the red-haired people. At the outpost closestto Pillpinto, two policemen pointed up into the sky and told about a large,round, bright object that had landed on top of one of the mountains. The policesaid they had climbed up there and if we did, too, we could still see the \"burnedoval\" where the light landed. The police estimated it would take a day to reachthe site. I was tempted, but time was limited, and I wanted to at least see if thetall Irish people were still living in Pillpinto. So, we continued on to the village.When we stopped, our car was surrounded by dozens of children. When Floresexplained why I was there, the children began pointing toward houses. He saidthe children knew about the tall, red-haired people and would take us to a manwho knew about them.My heart began to beat faster as we walked toward the door of a small, adobehome, preceded by the laughter and chatter of the children who surrounded us.The sun was setting and in the twilight shadows, I asked myself what I was goingto do if I actually found myself in front of an eight foot, red-haired being fromanother world.Flores knocked and the door opened. In front of us stood a man aboutfive-foot-four with clear blue eyes, like \"clear water,\" as Felipe Branco describedthe clear green eyes of the tall, red-haired beings he has encountered in Brazil.There were copper-red patches in his dark, brown hair. I asked Flores if hecould find out where the man's parents were. After a long answer in Spanish,Flores said, \"His parents live in that house over there. Nothing unusual. But heknows about the 'tall Irish.' He says they used to live outside the village and havemoved on. He said there is another man here who knew them.\"We walked further surrounded by the children. Flores knocked on the seconddoor. Another man answered and his eyes were clear blue, too. He also hadcopper patches in his dark hair. He knew about the red-haired people, but saidthey didn't live there anymore. He did not know where they had come from,either, or where they had gone.In 1993, Missouri artist Lisa Dusenberry sent me a photograph of a humanoidshe had drawn (top of this report) based on the testimony of a man fromsouthwestern Tennessee who encountered an unusual humanoid during anabduction experience that was similar to the Peruvian description. He said, \"Shewas eight feet tall, wore a full-length purple, hooded robe, and had long, redhair.\" He felt she was kind and loving and he was comfortable with her.Another woman in southern California saw a copy of Lisa Dusenberry's drawingof the red-haired and said the female was the same being she had seen during herabduction. A woman and her teenage daughter who were abducted from a ruralNevada town also described red-haired humanoids. Peru and Tall, Red-Haired BeingsVery tall, copper-haired, blue-eyed beings were involved in the abduction ofBrian Scott in southern California in the mid-1970s.

Frazier,www.ThePlayof Life.com and recent interview with him in Part 4 of thisEarthfiles.com series of reports.When Spaniard Pedro Pizarro began his land expedition into the western coastof South America in 1531, he was surprised to find tall, red-haired, white-skinned people mixed among the larger population of short, black-haired,brown-skinned people. Pizarro, with his white skin and light hair and beard, waswelcomed by the Incas as the return of their god, Viracocha - an unfortunateassumption that lead to the Incas' destruction. Pizarro was also surprised to learnthat Viracocha was described as being tall with reddish-brown hair and a beard.\"In (Peru), on the Pacific coast and the desert sand of Paracas,there are large burial caves in which numerous mummies have been perfectlypreserved. Some of the mummies were found to have ... red, often chestnut-colored hair,silky and wavy, as found amongst Europeans, they have long skulls andremarkably tall bodies.Hair experts have shown by microscopic analysis that the red hair has all thecharacteristicsthat ordinarily distinguish a Nordic hair type from that of Mongols or AmericanIndians.\"- From Aku-Aku: The Secret of Easter Island © 1988 by Thor HeyerdahlA red-haired mummy dated to circa 1400 A.D. and recovered from Nevado Ampato,Peru, in the mountains near the famous Machu Picchu mountaintop \"city\" or \"fortress\"built for unknown purpose.
