Pennsylvania has five fully active reactors,including Three Mile Island which is near the Harrisburg International Airport.Graphic © 2001 by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.September 10, 2002 Harrisburg, Pennsylvania - Today for the first timesince the Homeland Security color-coded threat level went into effect lastMarch, the level was raised from Code Yellow to Code Orange, only one notchbelow the highest Code Red. Homeland Security Director, Tom Ridge, andAttorney General John Ashcroft, said the alert level was raised after receivingwhat they called \"an abundance of credible intelligence\" about terroristsplanning attacks to coincide with tomorrow's first anniversary of September 11,2001 - somewhere in the U. S. or world. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" The New Jersey National Guard troops were mobilized to guard criticalfacilities, including nuclear power plants. In Pennsylvania, everyone wonderedabout Three Mile Island. Even the issue of armed National Guard patrols atPennsylvania nuclear power plants is still controversial. Yesterday, a Geiger counter belonging to the TMI utility was found along withunrelated items inside a cooler placed at the 9/11 Shanksville crash site forreasons unknown. Was it a prank? Or an Al Qaeda terrorist cell member leavinga weird calling card at one of its 9/11 destruction scenes? I called Ralph DeSantis in Three Mile Island security to find out what washappening under the new Code Orange alert. Interviews: Three Mile Island nuclear power plant near Pennsylvania's state capitol,Harrisburg, and the Harrisburg International Airport. Ralph DeSantis, Security Communications, Three Mile Island NuclearPower Plant, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: \"Here's the deal. They went fromyellow to orange, as you know. And at Three Mile Island and at all nuclearpower plants, we are taking guidance from the Nuclear Regulatory commissionon additional security measures. Some of those measures could include:- Having additional security personnel on standby.- Adding or changing our security barriers that we have at the plant.- Reducing unnecessary activities at the site.- And we are increasing our communications with federal and state lawenforcement agencies.WHAT ABOUT PUTTING BULLETS IN THE NATIONAL GUARD'S RIFLES?You have to talk to the National Guard about that. I don't speak on behalf ofthem.IS ANY GUARD AT THREE MILE ISLAND ON SEPTEMBER 10, DO THEYHAVE BULLETS OF SOME SORT IN THEIR WEAPONS?All officers are prepared to defend the plant. The actual status of their weaponryis safeguarded information, but needless to say, they have live ammunition andthey are ready to defend the plant.YESTERDAY, I BELIEVE IT WAS IN SHANKSVILLE, A CONTAINER WAS"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"FOUND WITH SOME THREE MILE ISLAND-LABELED EITHER GEIGERCOUNTERS OR RADIOACTIVE-RELATED MATERIAL?It was not radioactive at all.. At the Shanksville site they found a cooler whichcontained among other things not at all belonging to Three Mile Island, butthere was one radiation detection device that was in the cooler that is from ourenvironmental monitoring program.HOW DID IT GET THERE?Someone stole it.AND IF SOMEONE STOLE SOMETHING FROM YOUR ...It was not on the island. These are detectors. We have 200 of these around thesite in the environment to detect radiation and someone stole one. It was a verycowardly thing to do and we are working diligently with the federal and statelaw enforcement agencies in the investigation.IS THE FBI INVOLVED?You'll have to talk to them.IS IT POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE DID THAT AT THE SHANKSVILLE SITETO LEAVE A CALLING CARD?I don't know what their motive was in doing it. If that was their motive, weconsider that to be cowardly, a disgrace to our country and we're working withauthorities to prosecute to the fullest extent if we could find the person who didit.WHAT IF IT THAT IS RELATED TO AL QAEDA?I cannot get into what if and speculative types of questions.\" Pennsylvania House Minority Whip, Representative Mike Veon (D) from the14th District in Beaver Falls is so concerned about the vulnerability of ThreeMile Island and other nuclear power plants to attack that he drafted legislationthis summer that would require National Guard troops to carry loaded weaponswhile patrolling nuclear plants. That bill has been resisted by PennsylvaniaRepublican Governor Mark Schweiker who thinks everything about nuclearplant security should be secret.Given the heightened state of Code Orange alert, I asked Representative Veonthis afternoon if he or other state officials had been given any inside informationfrom the federal government about whether Three Mile Island has specificallyshown up on intelligence hit lists. Mike Veon (D), Minority Whip and State Representative of Pennsylvania's14th District (Beaver Falls) Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: \"No, the legislativeleadership in Pennsylvania has not been briefed on the updated warning status.So, we don't have any knew information that is not in the public realm as toexactly what this new heightened status means for Pennsylvania or for thenuclear plants in the state.DOES THAT BOTHER YOU THAT STATES, ESPECIALLY ONES THATHAVE A LARGE CONCENTRATION OF NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS, ARENOT CALLED BY HOMELAND SECURITY AND TOLD, 'WE ARE GOINGTO RAISE FROM YELLOW TO ORANGE AND THIS IS THE REASON'?Absolutely. I think there should be a much better system of articulating andeducating public officials. I get calls all the time. I have a district that is only afew miles from the first nuclear plant built in this country, a shipping port inBeaver County. I have people who stop me on the street all the time and ask me"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"about the safety and security. I don't think we have a very good system in placethat educates and informs and articulates elected officials exactly what theimmediate heightened security concerns are. I think we need a much bettersystem. There ought to be a more adequate briefing and there just is no system inplace.YOU HAVE LEARNED TODAY ABOUT THIS HEIGHTENED ALERT FROMYELLOW TO ORANGE TODAY BY WHAT, LISTENING TO CNN?I learned like everyone else from the public media.WHAT DO YOU KNOW THOUGH ABOUT THE STATE OF SECURITY ATTHREE MILE ISLAND?I don't know anything more than I knew yesterday about it. I have been criticalthat we don't have a large enough National Guard force. I've been critical aboutthe kind of weapons, or lack thereof, of the kind of weapons that are at thenuclear facilities all across the state. So, I don't know anything today more thanI knew yesterday. Frankly, that bothers me.YOU DON'T THINK RIGHT NOW THAT THREE MILE ISLAND ISIMPERVIOUS TO AN ATTACK OR HAS ENOUGH ABILITY TO FEND OFFAN ATTACK?I do not. I have been critical from the start. Some people have said I'm analarmist. I'd rather be safe than sorry and I have yet to receive what I think areadequate descriptions of nuclear plant safety and security in this state. I getreassurances from those that are in charge of security and yet, Three Mile Islandis a good example. They told me that it's very safe, yet a fisherman and his sonpulled a boat right up onto the island within a hundred yards of the plantwithout being detected.RIGHT. I TALKED WITH SECURITY ABOUT THAT AND THEY SAID, 'OH,THOSE PEOPLE COULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN TO THE POWERPLANT.'Sure, they are always full of reasons why something couldn't be done. But thefirst time, the first explanation to me was that they could not even get to theisland. Then once, they get to the island, now they say they couldn't get to thenuclear power plant. So, that's just not adequate and I think that's a sign andsignal for people like me that the job is not getting done the way it should be.CLEARLY PEOPLE IN THE HARRISBURG AREA AROUND THREE MILEISLAND ARE CONCERNED ENOUGH TO HAVE THREE MILE ISLANDCITIZENS GROUP THAT IS CONSTANTLY TRYING TO MONITOR. WHAT ITHINK I'M PUZZLED ABOUT AS A REPORTER: IF YOU HAVE BEEN ASTATE REPRESENTATIVE FOR 18 YEARS, WHY IS IT THAT YOU CAN'TSEEM TO MAKE THE SECURITY OF THREE MILE ISLAND A PRIORITYHIGH ENOUGH TO HAVE ACTION WITHIN THE LAST 12 MONTHS?I think to some degree it is a philosophical difference with the governor and hisstaff in this state. They want to treat security in Pennsylvania only as a statesecret. The less anyone knows about it, they believe, the better. That's myopinion about their philosophy. I believe the more people know about we havein place, the more greater the visible deterrents, the more public knowledge, themore public information, the more public expression of strength and securityand deterrents, the better off we are.THERE IS A LOT OF CONCERN RIGHT NOW THAT BETWEEN NOW ANDMIDNIGHT TOMORROW ON SEPTEMBER 11 THAT THERE IS GOING TOBE AN ATTACK, A SUICIDE ATTACK OR SOME KIND OF ATTACKEITHER SOMEWHERE IN THE UNITED STATES OR AN ATTACK ONAMERICA SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD. IF YOU WERELOOKING AT ALL THE POSSIBLE TARGETS IN THE U. S. THAT COULDDO THE MOST DAMAGE, WOULD YOU PUT THREE MILE ISLAND UPTHERE ON A LIST OF THE TOP FIVE?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I would certainly put it on the list of the top five sites that if attacked and ifdestroyed could cause the most damage. No question about that just because ofthe fact that it's a nuclear facility. I wouldn't necessarily put it on the list ofplaces most vulnerable to attack, but certainly on a list of places that if attackedcould cause the most damage. And I think from President Bush to Tom Ridge toDonald Rumsfeld to Governor Schweiker to everyone in Pennsylvania, we're allwell aware of that and certainly on September 10 and September 11, we'reaware that that is a very possible high profile target.WHAT IS THE LEGISLATION YOU DRAFTED HOPING YOU COULD GETIT PASSED?I drafted legislation that mandates the National Guard have live bullets in theirweapons. I think it's an insane policy, and a wrong policy...TO NOT HAVE...to not have live ammunition in their weapons. And the precious seconds it takesto load those guns are seconds that should not have to take place. We made thatclear. We've tried to do it by law. The governor could do it with a phone call orcomment to the Attorneys General. But as far as I know, they won't say one wayor the other.WHAT IS THE STATUS OF THAT LEGISLATION TODAY?It's in the House of Representatives (Pennsylvania) and the Republicanlegislature refused to move it, I think out of concern of embarrassing theRepublican governor.BECAUSE HE HAS TAKEN A STAND THAT HE DOESN'T WANT ANYONETO KNOW WHAT THE EXACT SECURITY MEASURES ARE?That's correct.WHAT IS YOUR OWN PERSONAL GREATEST CONCERN ABOUT WHATMIGHT HAPPEN TO THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS EITHER INPENNSYLVANIA OR THIS COUNTRY? AND I'M THINKING EVEN INTERMS OF AIRLINE SUICIDE ATTACKS RIGHT INTO THE DOME OFTHREE MILE ISLAND?My own personal most significant concern would be an attack from the air. Ithink that could do the greatest damage. I'm certainly concerned about anyinfiltration of the perimeter of the plant, but that would be my number oneconcern.\"Project On Government Oversight (POGO) Report Critical of Nuclear PowerPlant SecurityThis afternoon I also received word that the Project On Government Oversight(POGO) in Washington, D. C., has completed a four-month-long investigationinterviewing 22 guards at 13 nuclear power plants to determine what the guards'perspectives are on the adequacy of security protection. POGO says in its reportto be officially released on Thursday, September 12, that \"security guards atonly one out of four nuclear power plants are confident their plant could defeata terrorist attack.\"I called POGO's Senior Investigator, Pete Stockton, who has worked forCongress and has spent the past two years as an investigator for the Secretary ofthe Department of Energy on security problems at nuclear weapons facilities. Pete Stockton, Sr. Investigator, Project On Government Oversight(POGO), Washington, D. C.: \"We've interviewed Nuclear RegulatoryCommission experts, Department of Energy experts, and we're just coming out"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"with a report now. And we find there are significant inadequacies in theprotection of these plants. We're just focusing on physical security and we arefinding that the guards are under-manned, they are under-paid, and they areout-gunned which leaves major holes in the security of these places.WHEN YOU SAY OUTGUNNED, YOU MEAN?The problem with being out-gunned. The problem when we started this two orthree months ago, a third of the guards in the country were only equipped withside-arms and shotguns. What you would expect in a real terrorist attack is theseguys coming in with automatic weapons, grenade launchers, sniper rifles and allof that. These guards feel they are significantly out-gunned.Now, there are a number of facilities now that have gone to AR-15s, which is asemi-automatic rifle similar to an M-16 that's semi-automatic. Still, that doesn'tmeasure up to the kind of weaponry that the terrorist would come in with.In a facility like these and a terrorist attack, you don't have perimeter defenselike that. You develop your security from the inside out. As one of theseNational Guardsmen said, 'All we are are canaries in a coal mine.' When theydie, the guard forces are going to know they are coming, the bad guys arecoming because they are just sitting ducks out there.WHAT IS IT GOING TO TAKE TO CHANGE THIS?It's going to take some action on the part of the NRC and the utilities to upgradethis security. The biggest problem they have right now is their defensive postureis based on only three terrorists attacking from one spot. That's highly unrealisticafter what we found at 9/11 where you had 19 terrorists in a highly coordinatedattack. I wouldn't recommend going with a the DBT threat level that thefacilities are supposed to be able to guard against.WHAT DOES THAT STAND FOR?Design Basis Threat. That means the number of outside attackers, the number ofterrorists coming in, the kind of weaponry that they carry and the number ofinsiders that are going to help them both active and passive. A passive insider isjust one that provides information to the terrorists. An active insider can beactually armed, shooting people in the back, that kind of thing.WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THREE MILE ISLAND AT THISPOINT?I can't comment on that, on a particular facility (to protect the security guards). Ithink we are talking about the fact that there are basic problems at most of theseplants.SO, THE SUMMARY IS THAT OUT OF 13 PLANTS IN WHICH YOU WEREABLE TO INTERVIEW GUARDS ANONYMOUSLY, ONLY TWO OF THOSETHIRTEEN INSTALLATIONS SEEMED TO HAVE IMPROVED SECURITY...Since 9/11 essentially, that's an easy way to put it. That have taken it seriouslyand have improved the security. Where the guards really believe that they couldhandle the old DBT and possibly could handle a real terrorist attack.The vast majority of the others, they would be wiped out. These attacks takeabout 3 minutes. We say between 3 and 10 minutes, one of these attacks is overand the NRC and a lot of the utilities say, 'Well, we're just going to contain theseguys and wait for outside help.' But SWAT help comes in about an hour and ahalf to two hours. So, they simply can't wait for any outside responders to be ofany help at all.WHY IS IT THAT THE NRC HAS DRAGGED ITS FEET IN TERMS OFUPGRADING SECURITY AT THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS?(laughs) There have been arguments for a long time that they have been tooclose to industry and industry either doesn't believe in the threat or the major"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"issue is that they don't want to spend the money on security because it's anoverhead issue. Essentially, it comes out of profits and they simply don't want tospend the money.One of the shocking things we found is that these guards are seriously underpaidand the janitors at the plant make between $1 and $4 an hour more than theguards make. In fact, we found at a number of sites that the guards make lessthan the local manicurists and aerobic instructors and people like that whoaren't risking their lives.A YEAR AFTER 9/11, THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE?It doesn't.SO WHAT CAN BE DONE?One thing that's going on right now is that the Congress is so upset about thisthat they are trying to legislate a new DBT, which is kind of a bizarre thing to bedoing. It's trying to upgrade security with legislation if the NRC refuses to move.And the NRC has been trying to fight that legislation.Let me tell you, a crisis in Washington, the first thing you do was reorganize andyou create new bureaucracies and that somehow salves the concern of theAmerican people, or it's supposed to. They don't get down on the ground andfind out what is the problem. They don't talk to the guards. They don't go outand investigate what is happening at these plants.The NRC has done exactly the same thing as Homeland Security has done on amega scale they have created a new Office of Security in the NRC. If you look atthe top five managers, only one has had any security background at all, has anyexperience in security. So, you tell me!SO, IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY, YOU'RE SAYING THAT CONGRESSIS SO FRUSTRATED BY ALL OF THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT NUCLEARPOWER PLANTS FROM ITS OWN CONSTITUENTS THAT IT IS NOWTRYING TO LEGISLATE AND SAY THAT ALL NUCLEAR POWERPLANTS MUST BE READY TO TAKE ON A BIGGER ASSAULT BYTERRORISTS OR SOME ATTACK THAN CURRENTLY BECAUSE THENUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION HAS FAILED TO DO SO?That's exactly right. You put it perfectly. And there was serious frustration onthat committee and you should have heard Hilary Clinton (Senator (D), NewYork). You know, she's got Indian Point in her back yard and all she hears fromher constituents is about the security at Indian Point.\"We b s it e s :http://www.whitehouse.gov/homelandhttp://www.pogo.orghttp://www.nrc.govhttp://www.fas.orghttp://www.tmia.comhttp://www.nci.orgCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"earthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
