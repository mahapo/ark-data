The next day, March 18, 1950, the unprecedented aerial event madeheadlines in the Farmington Daily Times and The Denver Post.March 18, 1950 Farmington Daily Times, Farmington, New Mexico.But March 17, 1950 was not the first fly-over the Farmington and Aztec area. One yearbefore in the spring of 1949 - and very likely March also - Hulon and Geneva Pace andtheir 9-year-old son, Glenn, were renting a house on Lincoln Street in Farmington whiletheir new house was being built. Hulon, who is now 82-years-old, lived with his wife,Geneva, in Farmington until April 2002 when they moved to Tennessee to be closer to theirson.I met Geneva and Hulon in Aztec during a conference there March 22-24, tookphotographs of them, received a drawing that Hulon did of the silver discs he saw fly overtown that spring. He and Glenn distinctly remember a newspaper headline about a crasheddisk in Hart Canyon 11 miles northeast of Aztec in what was then the Farmington TimesHustler. I checked with Times librarian, Margaret Mathers, about the date that the Hustlerchanged to the Farmington Daily Times. She told me the first daily newspaper came out onAugust 1, 1949.I asked her what day the newspaper was printed and distributed prior to August 1. She saidin 1949 the Hustler came out on Fridays. So, for example if there was another fly-over orcrash on St. Patrick's Day March 17, 1949, it turns out that was a Thursday and the storywould have been printed the next day, Friday, March 18, 1949. A crashed disk on anational holiday prior to 1950 was discussed by a military officer described in the \"MilitaryVoices\" chapter of my book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness. So, Iasked Margaret Mathers to check the back issues of the Farmington newspaper for bothMarch 18 and March 25, 1949. The newspapers archived on microfilm for those dates hadthese respective headlines: \"Legislature Attempts Disenfranchisement of Navahos\" and\"Navahos Consider Asking for Accredited Schools.\" The librarian said there was not asingle word in either paper about unidentified aerial objects or a crash in Hart Canyon.But Hulon Pace, retired now, but former shop foreman at Smoak Chevrolet and El PasoNatural Gas in Farmington, remembers that he and his wife, Geneva, and their 9-year-oldson, Glenn, all saw a newspaper headline and read the story about a disk coming down inHart Canyon."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Hulon and Geneva Pace at their Farmington, New Mexico home onMarch 22, 2002.

But it's well known throughout the community herethat there was a crash site of a saucer out northeast of Aztec.In Hart Canyon?In Hart Canyon, right.If you go back to March of 1949 which appears to be the month and date that Glennand I and others have talked about, can you remember what you saw with your owneyes in the newspaper?There was supposedly a UFO crashed in Hart Canyon. They had a write up on it, but I can'tremember how it was worded at that time. It's been so long.Do you remember anything about the headlines, the big words on the newspaper?I think it just said, 'UFO Crashes In Hart Canyon,' I believe, is the way the headlines was inthe newspaper.Can you explain where you were living at that time that helped you and your wiferemember?We was in a rental on Lincoln Street here in Farmington while we was building a newhouse.You would have been in that rental in March of 1949?Ye s .When you recently went to the library and have tried to find that 1949 newspaper,what did you and your wife talk about in terms of the fact that it doesn't seem to bethere anymore in the archives?We couldn't imagine. At the time we checked all we could check on it and see why it wasn'tthere and we never could get any information why it didn't show up there. Everybody justseemed to be blank about it. Nobody had any suggestions or whys or wherefores orwhatever.\" Newspaper Headline About Disk In Hart CanyonNot only does Hulon Pace and his son, Glenn remember the newspaper headline, but bothfather and son associate the headline with their own eyewitness sightings of anotherfly-over of unidentified discs right before the newspaper story. If so, that would mean discswent over the Farmington/Aztec area both in the spring of 1949 and the famous armada ofMarch 17, 1950. Here is Mr. Pace's drawing of the silver discs he saw over Farmington in"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the spring of what he thinks was the spring of 1949.Sketch by Hulon Pace on March 22, 2002 of the silver disks he remembers movingabove Farmington for several minutes in the spring of 1949, when he and his familywere living in a rental while their house was being built. The next day he and his familysay the Farmington Hustler newspaper had a headline and story about a disk crashingin Hart Canyon 11 miles northeast of Aztec. Suspected date of sighting was either in 1948or 1949 on March 17, and Hart Canyon newspaper headline on March 18.Hulon Pace: \"They was playing around like they was dogfighting or something, you know.About five or six is the best I can remember at the time that we saw them and stood thereand watched them for ten minutes or so. Then they disappeared off to the northeast.What were their color and shape?They was a silver color and kind of shaped like a saucer. They would turn up on their sidewhere the sun would shine on them every once in awhile and you could see them real plainwhen they turned up on their side. Otherwise, they would just flatten out and you couldhardly tell the color of them when they flattened out. But when they turned up on theirside, it would be going one direction and then all at once, they would go another directionnot even slowing up. It was amazing!And what gave you the impression of a dogfight?Well, just the way they were playing around. I don't know if you would call it a dogfight orwhat. It looked like they were just maneuvering around each other like our planessometimes would do in a dogfight, just putting on a show or something.You don't mean that it looked like some of them were fighting with others?No, they weren't really fighting, just maneuvering is what they were doing. It was amazingas fast as they were going how they could keep from running into each other.\" Glenn Pace, Eyewitness to Unidentified Aerial DisksAbove Farmington Around 1949"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Glenn Pace at age 9 at his Farmington, New Mexico homewhere he lived with his parents, Hulon and Geneva Pace.

The same time his father was seeing thedogfight in the spring of 1949, Glenn was at grade school and saw part of the same strangeaction in the sky.Glenn Pace, son of Hulon Pace, music and commercial editor, Nashville, Tennessee:\"And we come out of school for recess right towards the end of that situation. And we musthave seen them for about 30 or 40 seconds that first time.What did you see with your own eyes?We saw the formation up there, silvery discs and they made a couple moves together whichI thought was really strange. When these things in the air were all moving in unisontogether.Like some people have compared it to schools of fish moving.Yeah, kind of like that. Like they first moved, they were like over the south part of thebluffs there. And they made a move towards the airport which would have been west ofFarmington. Then they made a jog that jogged back over kind of towards Bloomfield, butnot very - must have been like over 2 or 3 miles east. And then they moved back over thebluffs, they made a jog back over there. And then from there, they bolted toward Durango.They were gone in just a flash. It wasn't more than a few seconds.You watched see this with your own eyes?Right. And I had a paper route at that point. I had a huge paper route.So, you got to see the newspaper article with your own eyes?Yes, I did. I remember reading the headline and my mom read the whole article to us all inthe living room at the dining table. I delivered the papers that day, too, besides reading thearticle, I delivered papers that was there. And when I rolled it up, it was right there. Youcould see it when it was rolled up! It's not something that was a figment of my imagination.That article really existed. How in the world they got them all is beyond me!Try to tell me what you remember the headline said.The next day in the paper, an article come out that was headlined in the paper. It said that aUFO had crashed near Aztec up in Hart Canyon. It had a pinhole in the porthole and therewere three charred bodies inside about 4 foot high in stature. And that the government hadcome and took the craft and carried it away."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Glenn Pace, 9 years old, and his friend, Teddy Brock, on Glenn's horse Nibbles in 1949.The two rode out to Hart Canyon to see where the disk came down that was headlinedin the newspaper.

My grandad had a big truck, so I knew what truck tracks looked likein the sand and there were truck tracks out there.Then, the very next year on March 18, 1950, you were ten years old ...Yeah, a year later in March of 1950, we were on the playground and we saw, a kid lookedup and saw a whole bunch of UFOs up there and said, 'Hey, look at that!' And we lookedup and said, 'Wow, that's just like the other ones that we seen.' But there were a lot more ofthem. They were just, they moved a couple of moves and were just kind of going slow. Andthen they took off in the same direction again. They went back towards Durango when theyleft. But now we only saw the one fly-over. Other people reported seeing more than onefly-over.On that day.Yeah, on that day.\" Government File On Aztec, NM DiskBeyond these memories, there have also been leaks by military people and others about thediscovery of an extraordinary craft near Aztec with details that sound similar to GlennPace's childhood memory of what he and his parents saw in the newspaper. I first sawAztec mentioned on a list of UFOB crash sites on April 9, 1983. I was in the U. S. Air ForceOffice of Special Investigations (AFOSI) at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexicoworking on an hour special for Home Box Office.The man across a desk from me was Richard C. Doty, then a Special AFOSI Agent in theAir Force. He showed me an alleged briefing paper for the President of the United Statesthat included a list of U. S. government retrieval operations of what the document called\"unidentified aerial craft\" of extraterrestrial origin. Some crash locations I remember listedin the briefing paper were Aztec, Roswell and Magdalena, New Mexico; Kingman,Arizona; and northern Mexico south of Laredo.The Aztec incident, according to other sources beyond that briefing paper, involved a99-foot-diameter silver disc with a dome discovered in Hart Canyon eleven miles northeastof Aztec in March 1949.About that alleged crash, some years ago I received a military officer's confidentialinterview entitled \"The Report on the Crash at Farmington.\" There was a black and whitephotograph of a silver disk at the site. The officer helped produce a computer recreation ofthe silver disk downed near Farmington, New Mexico \"prior to 1950.\" The military officersaid dead non-human beings were found inside the craft. The name Farmington in the filetitle was thought to have been used instead of Aztec because in 1949, Farmington was alarger town than the nearby rural farming community of Aztec."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"A computer simulation of a photograph allegedly seen by former military officer in early 1960s. Photograph'slocation was a file drawer in a classified military library. Source said silver-colored diskwas U. S. military near Farmington, New Mexico, prior to 1950. For more information, see: Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness in Earthfile s Shop.The authors of the report are two investigators whom I know and they wanted me to seethe computer-generated drawing based on a photograph the man said he had seen during amilitary assignment. The image depicted a disc shaped like two smooth saucers gluededge-to-edge and topped by a shallow dome. The caption read: \"A computer simulates thedisc-shaped craft as it was seen intact on the ground in the actual photograph.\"I agreed not to identify the authors at their request and they gave me permission to excerptfrom their discussions with a \"witness who was a former military officer. While serving, hesaid he had a special security clearance that enabled him to access a restricted library (priorto 1970). Due to the highly sensitive nature of the information, and possible risk to thisindividual, no information is provided which could be used to identify him or the locationof the base.\"The following excerpts are not verbatim, but were compiled from notes after four separateconversations with the military eyewitness.\"Q: What was the occasion in which you viewed documents concerningcrashed saucers?A: While I was stationed at this particular base, ...the materials library wasavailable to those officers with a designated security clearance and I had theappropriate clearance. I was passing time in the library and I discovered a fileon the subject of an alien craft and its dead occupants that had been retrieved.The file contained a report, a separate black and white photograph, and a bookby Major Donald Keyhoe.Q: What did you see in the photograph?A: There was a perfectly intact, circular-shaped craft and it was lyingsomewhat tilted to one side on the ground in the desert. There did not appearto be a crater or other ground-surface disturbance in the photograph thatwould indicate a crash, but I could not tell for sure. ...it was stated that thecraft was retrieved somewhere near the town of Farmington, New Mexico,prior to 1950. As I could see in the photograph, the material of which the craftwas composed was metallic, and resembled brushed aluminum. The reportnoted this also.Q: Were there any surface features on the craft at all?A: It was stated in the report that there were portholes on the cabin part of thecraft, but they were not made of any type of glass. I couldn't make out thisfeature in the photograph.Q: Did the information reveal what that material could have been?A: Well, this porthole had a puncture that was the diameter of a pencil; thatwas the only defect discovered on the entire ship. Our people tried diamonddrills, an acetylene torch - everything they could come up with on the portholewhere this opening was located, but nothing would break through it. Theycouldn't enlarge the hole, either. The material was tougher than anything wewere familiar with on earth. But they eventually got into the cabin.Q: Did the report say how they accessed it?A: Yes, it was described as a chance opening. They had gone over the outsideof the craft and could not even find a seam or crack that might indicate thelocation of a door or other entrance. This led them to focus on the smallopening in the porthole. As I mentioned earlier, they used everything theycould think of to enlarge this hole, and nothing worked. It was concluded that"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"they would have to somehow gain access through this hole and they eventuallydid because a door popped open. It appeared from a place where there wereno obvious seams or other indications of a door. The report said (referring tothe opening and closing of the door) that it was 'almost as if the material of thecraft had liquefied and then solidified again,' leaving no clue of the door'slocation upon closing. If there was a seam, it was so tight it couldn't beobserved.Q: Was there anything in the report that indicated the weight of the craft?A: Yes, it was apparently composed of a very lightweight material. The reportstated that two average men could lift or move the entire ship.Q: I am especially interested in what these dead occupants were like.Were they described as biological extraterrestrials.A: Well, it said that thetwo bodies were badly charred. So was the interior of the cockpit of the craft.The report also said that they were about four feet in height. There was nodescription of their features beyond that.Q: So, there was no mention of sexual difference?A: No, no mention of that. But it's interesting that the report said that theclothing wasn't burned at all. It was a one-piece flight suit.Q: So, there was a description of the fabric?A: Yes, it was some type of woven fabric and the report said that it had atensile strength of 800 pounds.Q: Was there any mention of craft propulsion systems?A: There was no mention of a propulsion system other than the idea that theirtechnology utilized magnetic or gravitational fields of the planets to travel inspace.Q: Was there anything in the report that indicated the reason for the craftcoming down? For example, there have been rumored reports that ourmilitary was under orders to intercept and shoot them down. Is it possiblethat we shot this one down?A: According to the report, we were not responsible for bringing this craftdown. There was mention of a magnetic fault, or opening, or something likethat, located in the area where the craft came down. There were three of thesefaults or openings located in North America: one was located in the Southwest,around the Texas/New Mexico area; one was somewhere in the Carolinas; andone was somewhere in the Northeast sector, but I can't remember exactlywhere.Q: Have there been more than one crash?A: Yes, the report referred to 'crashes' and the Farmington crash informationwas used to relate general information on similarities with other crashes.Q: Are you saying that these aliens are not able to control their craft incertain areas?A: From the report, I learned these areas occur naturally and could possiblyinterfere with the navigation of these craft. The way I understand it, they usethe natural magnetic lines of a planet and a gravity field to move their shipsfrom one place to another. That's how they are able to make near-right angleturns which our jets are incapable of doing. They can fly circles around any ofour aircraft.Q: Was there anything in the report that suggested where the craft andlittle beings originated, or why they are coming here?A: No, nothing ... but the report did say that hundreds of alien craft flew overthe town of Farmington, New Mexico on the anniversary of this crash. Thatalso corresponded with the celebration of some national holiday. It said thatmay have been a tribute to the beings that were killed, or they were letting usknow by a show of force they had overcome the factor that caused their shipsto crash.Q: Why do you feel that the military or the government is withholding thisinformation from the public?A: They felt that only people in professional levels were capable of dealingwith this information. Based on what occurred with the Orson Welles Wa r o fthe Worlds radio presentation, this information could create panic. Then itthreatens to break down the industrial complex that supports the militarycomplex; it would obviously undermine it. And it could possibly reduce ourability to counter an attack by a hostile alien culture. But it was also clear thatthe intent of these particular beings was not known."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"While our technicians worked on the craft out in the desert (trying to gainaccess), other alien ships would from time to time fly by the site, pausingmomentarily to view the scene, perhaps to see if there were any survivors. Atno time did they attempt to harm our people.All the information on this subject was removed from the library in the late1960s. One thing I can say is that I would sure like to know what's going onnow.\" More Information:If anyone has more information about the Farmington disc flyovers on March 17, 1950, orthe retrieval of one or more silver discs near Aztec, please contact the Aztec Library at:505-334-7658.Also, I welcome further information concerning this report at earthfiles@earthfiles.comor FAX me at 505-797-7908 or write me at P.
