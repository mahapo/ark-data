July 2, 2002 Buenos Aires, Argentina - The National Health andAgroalimentary Quality Service (SENASA) yesterday held a press conference inBuenos Aires to announce, as the press release above states, \"Official ReportRegarding Injuries and Mutilations to Bovine Carcasses.\" To most everyone'ssurprise, including ranchers and veterinarians who had examined dozens of thedead animals, SENASA's President, Bernardo Cane, announced that \"studiesperformed on dead and mutilated animals have established that the deaths werethe result of natural causes and the injuries were provoked by predators, among"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"them a rodent of the genus Oxymcterus, more commonly known as the'hocicudo rojizo' (red muzzle) whose population has recently increased andwhose nutritional habits have changed.\" Oxymcterus, \"hocicudo rojizo\" (red muzzle), a rodent now officially blamedby Argentina federal officials for the animal mutilations in Argentina since April 2002.Photograph provided by SENASA, Buenos Aires. A reporter at the SENASA press conference in Buenos Aires was Reed Lindsay,a freelancer who attended after spending time in Salliquelo and General Pico ofnorthern La Pampa province to talk with ranchers and a couple of veterinarianswho have seen dozens of dead cattle from which ears, eyes, jaw flesh, tongues,trachea, larynx, esophagus, genital organs and rectal tissue have been excised\"surgically\" and bloodlessly. The ground under the dead animals has not shownany signs of struggle or tracks. I talked with Reed today about the pressconference and what he has learned the past few days in his research.Interview:Reed Lindsay, Freelance Newspaper Reporter for North Americannewspapers, currently based in Buenos Aires, Argentina: \"SENASAsummarized thirty cases that its laboratory analyses indicated 'signs of animalfecal matter' from the red muzzle mice, birds, armadillos and foxes on the deadcarcasses. The officials say that the excisions \"appear to be precise,\" but underthe microscope are not precise. Dr. Cane and his SENASA veterinariancolleagues attending the press conference, said animal predators had eaten thetissues away.Did anyone at this press conference challenge these conclusions?No, but I think I was one of the only reports at the press conference who hadactually gone out to the fields to talk with ranchers and veterinarians who hadseen a lot of cases. Due to the economic crisis here, reporters in the nationalmedia are on very low budget and generally rely on stringers or wire services toget the news about what is going on outside Buenos Aires. There was not a lotof questioning going on by the media. Most people did not have any backgroundabout animal mutilations.I did pose the question: how do you explain the contradiction between thismouse conclusion and the conclusion of professional veterinarians and ranchersout in the field with these cows every day and who say there is no way thiscould be the work of animals.That veterinarian, Dr. Belot, said he was looking at cautery on theexcisions.People on my trip were a little more cautious about that because they said it wastheir suspicions, but Dr. Belot said he wanted to wait to see the results of the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"test samples that he had sent to SENASA.Did anyone at this press conference show a photomicrograph of an excisionunder a microscope as part of SENASA's official investigation?No. Heat was not even talked about. There question was: are these precise cuts,either with a knife or with some kind of heat-producing instrument? Or are theythe work of animals? In the presentation, they put up two photos. One photowas cow hide cut with a knife. The other was cow hide supposedly found in oneof the mutilation cases. You could see under the microscope, how hide cut withthe knife was a clean line, whereas the other cow hide was uneven.Did anyone point out that predators including mice, birds and foxes havebeen around for centuries. Why would their natural predation suddenlylook differently as excisions that stand out as precise and unusual to theranchers and veterinarians?Right. The officials said there would have to be more studies done with rodentexperts. Further, their theory was that last year had a very warm summer. Theyspeculated that perhaps there was a proliferation of these mice. This year it hasbeen very cold in Argentina, one of the coldest winters in a long time. Thus, thefood sources of insects and plants aren't as abundant as before and there aremany more of them. So, there are a lot of hungry mice and they are going afterthe dead cows. Veterinarian Alberto Pariani, University of La Pampa,Has Never Heard of the MouseInterestingly, veterinarian Alberto Pariani, D.V.M. of the University of LaPampa in General Pico has never even heard of this 'hocicudo rojizo' mouse. Hesaid that he personally has gone out on four or five mutilations in the field andhe's seen tissue samples from at least forty animals submitted to his lab at theUniversity of La Pampa from other local veterinarians. Dr. Pariani was especiallysurprised by the official statements in the press conference because he has notseen any fecal animals of foxes, birds or mice on any of the mutilated animals hehas examined.Now, he's being very cautious. The only thing he will say on the record is he hasdefinitely ruled out disease. But he told me, 'The types of excisions do notcorrelate with any known infectious disease. When animal predators eat, theyrip and tear. They don't cut.' Everyone who has had experience working out onthe ranches says the same thing: 'No animal can do this.'\"He said that to me on the record before the press conference. But now he'safraid of saying something publicly that will get him in trouble. But it's clear hehad never heard of these mice before. It certainly was not his conclusion.From my trip to northern La Pampa what impressed me the most was theconsensus among veterinarians and ranchers out in the field who work in thesmall towns out in the pampas, working with cows every day. There was a clearconsensus that this was not the work of animals, disease, natural causes. that thishad to be by intelligent beings. There was also a consensus although mostpeople would come out and say it publicly, that it is not human. Thisperspective includes the veterinarians, ranchers and even the police. The head ofthe state police in the area of General Pico. I spoke with him and he said therewas no way people could be doing this without the police catching them.I asked him, 'Is this the perfect crime, then?' He said, 'There is no such thing asthe perfect crime.'Fifty years and counting of such perfect crimes! Did you get photographs ofany new cases?I did on one case. Now, it's about five days old. The rancher found it on"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Thursday, June 27, and we went out there on Saturday morning, June 29. Westarted at the police station. The veterinarian the day before had cut off the headfor analysis and we saw the head first there in General Pico. The vet showed upas well and pointed out some of the things he thought were interesting.It was a calf, about 120 pounds.Male or female?Female, I think. It was missing an eye. Missing an ear. Missing its tongue,pharynx and larynx. the facial muscles were gone in what appeared to be aprecise cut.Then after examining the calf's head, we went to the nearby ranch to see the restof the carcass there. In the chest area, there was a hole of missing flesh. It waspretty much a circular cut. The vet said that the day before when he cut off thehead and took it to the police station that the round hole was not there in thechest. The police agree as well, the ones who went to the pasture with us. Therancher also said the round chest hole was not there the day before.SENASA would say it was the red-nosed mouse that came and ate it away?Right. But the veterinarian and rancher said the first place that scavengers go foris the guts. They are not going to eat the muscles in the face and ear. TheSENASA veterinarian at the press conference said about this issue, 'That's truewith foxes. They can rip up the hide. But the mice, they are too small to dig intothe cow hide, so they have to go through the orifices of the cows such as themouth, ear, eye, rectum.Which doesn't really explain a brand new hole in the chest from the daybefore, does it?No, not really. But about what makes the round holes, one of the scientists inthe press conference said, These mice tend to eat in that way. It's a naturalbiological phenomenon.\"Dr. Pariani had never heard of the mice eating holes in cattle before thispress conference?No. Uruguay MutilationsWhat about Uruguay where last week a mutilated cow was found in theprovince of Durazno?You know what they announced as the answer to Uruguay at the pressconference? The Ranch Grazing Minister from there said it was 'the work ofyellow jackets'!\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
