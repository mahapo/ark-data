Pilot John Bouker, Owner of the BristolBay Air Service in Dillingham, Alaska, has flown for 22 years in everything fromC-130s to the Cessna 208 he was flying the weekend of October 5. It was lateafternoon, around 4 p.m., partly cloudy, but nice flying weather. John had sevenpassengers with him in his commuter plane when he thought he saw anotherplane coming toward him.Interviews:John Bouker, Pilot and Owner, Bristol Bay Air Service, Dillingham,Alaska: \"\"I looked out the window there there are no roads here, so we get around by air.There has been numerous mid-airs in Alaska that you don't ever hear about inthe United States, the lower 48.MEANING MID-AIR COLLISIONS?So we're always having to look around. Instead of cars, we have airplanes uphere. And so, it looked like another airplane, small airplane of some kind. I keptlooking at it and then said, 'Oh, my God, it's a bird!' I told the other people,'Hey, check this out.'We looked over there and everybody is looking out the left side of the plane.And there is this gigantic eagle type bird. It wasn't an albatross. It wasn't aseagull. It wasn't a parrot. It was some kind of eagle."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"WHAT WAS THE COLORING LIKE?It was a dark color, but he wasn't black. The best I could describe it is a bronzecolor. That's what it looked like to me.WERE THE WINGS FLAPPING THE WAY WE THINK OF BIRDSFLAPPING, OR WAS IT SOARING OR WHAT?It was soaring when I saw him. He moved his wings a few times. But you know,this guy had a rabbit in his mouth. It looked like a rabbit, big tundra jack rabbitand it was dangling from his mouth. We could tell that. These big jack rabbitsthey have up here are pretty big, more like a small dog to medium dog. It lookedlike a jack rabbit to me. He had something white in his mouth, big and white.WHAT WOULD YOU ESTIMATE THE WING SPAN WAS?I would say it was 14 to 15 feet.FOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN FEET THAT IS REALLY HUGE.Yeah. Because I know what a regular bald eagle looks like. This was probablythree times bigger than a bald eagle, or regular eagle. It could be compared tohow they have those motorized hang gliders. It definitely had the wingspan ofsomething like that. It was big, you know? You wouldn't want to have littlechildren running around. Eagles are predators. They'll get cats out of your yardand stuff like that.COULD YOU SEE TALONS AS IT HELD ON TO THE RABBIT?No, it wasn't holding on whatever feet he had were tucked up in him. I didn't seeany talons or anything.We landed at the airport. We saw him about 4 miles from the airport and welanded at the airport and this thing flew over the airport and circled the airporttwice. Then there were probably 20 people on the ground at the airportwatching this.On the ground, I got a better look. In the air we were going fast. We zoomed bythis thing and looked back. I thought, 'Well, that's the last we'll see of that.'Everybody was gaping and shouting. We landed. He flew over the ramp there atthe airport, these little village airports. He circled twice with this thing in hismouth and then he moseyed on his way. He wasn't afraid of us by any means.COULD YOU SEE ANY COLORATION ANY PLACE ON THE WING TIPSOR ANY OTHER PART?No. No. I saw his tail feathers were spread out, they were huge. You know howtail feathers in a bird, they kind of feather out. That's one thing that impressedme. I was looking at the size of his tail feathers, how they were spread out in afan.THEY WERE ALL DARK AS WELL?They weren't dark and they weren't white, but they were bronze.BUT NONE OF YOU HAVE EVER SEEN THAT BIRD BEFORE?Not me. No, I've seen 200,000 eagles in my life, at least! (laughs) I have neverseen anything like that!\"Margot MacKenzie, High School Teacher, Manokotak Nunaniq School,Manokotak, Alaska:\"It was about probably 800 to 1000 feet in the air and it was an absolutely huge,huge bird! No white on it anywhere. I've looked up the Steller's Sea Eagle whichhas white on the tail and shoulders. Maybe the shoulders you wouldn't be able"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"to see, but I imagine you could see the tail and there was no white visible at all.And the Steller's seems to have a really bright orange claw and beak and thatwas not obvious either.So, the color of the bird is like a dark brown with maybe a dark grey head. Andthe wings were so clear, even at that height, that you could see kind of a crosspattern on the wings where the feathers were and you could also see the fingersat the end of the wings. It wasn't just sometimes you'll see an eagle up over themountains and you can't see, you can't determine the end of the wings. You canjust kind of see the edge of it.YOU DON'T SEE DETAILS.On this one no, you could see detail. It was extraordinarily large.THERE HAVE BEEN TWO PILOTS AND A TRACTOR DRIVER WHOCOMPARED THE WING SPAN TO APPROXIMATELY. 14 FEET.Probably 12 to 14 feet, yeah. It was big. I used to live on Prince of Wales Islandnear Craig where there are many eagles in the spring of all different sizes. Andthis was not an eagle. And Moses John, when he saw it a couple of days later,and an eagle was flying in close proximity to this bird, and it was way biggerthan an eagle.YOU COULD NOT SEE WHITE ON ANY OF THE TAIL FEATHERS?There was absolutely no white anywhere on that bird. No. I watched it for along time. I watched it for probably 10 minutes and then it flew on the otherside of the mountain. It was huge, absolutely huge! It would quite take yourbreath away to see it. It's been seen by not just one or two people. It's been seenby probably close to half the village.HOW MANY PEOPLE?Maybe a hundred.A HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE SEEN THIS NOW?At least a hundred, yeah.DID YOU OR ANYBODY THAT YOU KNOW GET A PHOTOGRAPH OFTHIS BIRD?No, but everyone's got their cameras out now!Most people when they saw it were unprepared, because as you see it and tellpeople, they absolutely don't believe it. Well, then suddenly when they see it,they wish they had their camera with them because then they begin to believe itonce they've seen it.\"Douglas Causey, Ph.D., Senior Vertebrate Biologist, Museum ofComparative Zoology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts:\"How big did they say the wings were?THEY ESTIMATED 14 FOOT WING SPAN.No, no, no, no. (laughs) You would have to go back to the age of the dinosaursto get something flying that had a wing span that big. I have no doubt that whatthey saw was a Steller's Sea Eagle. It just sounds like the only bird that wouldbe as large as that, not counting a 14 foot wing span. Their wing span is about 4to 6 feet or 5 feet. But that is a measurement taken on a bird with a ruler. Inflight, it's awfully hard to gauge lengths. So, I have no doubt that without gettingout there with a ruler, that it must have looked enormous. They are very largebirds.There is a sub-species called Niger which by its name you would guess is almostentirely black. So, this is - I wish he had taken a picture. I take it, he didn't."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Number 41 is the Steller's Sea Eagle which can have a wing span of 4 to 6 feet.On the right is the darker Niger sub-species of Steller's Sea Eagle (Haliaeetus pelagicusniger;Niger is Latin for \"dark\"), which does have a white-trimmed tail. Both are native tonorthern Asia,the Sea of Okhotsk and Sea of Japan with some occasional sightings of the white-shouldered Steller'sin the Aleutian Islands. But the Niger is more rare and has not been seen much for half acentury.Image source: Handbook of Birds of the World, Edited by Josep Del Hoyo.I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIND SOMEONE WHO HAD TAKEN PHOTOS.Well, let me tell you that what is very intriguing about this is that race Niger isknown from Korea. But there hasn't been one seen in the wild in probably I'mguessing but probably four or five decades.It could also have been an immature or funny lighting, all these things play arole. But whatever whether it's a sub-adult or this very rare sub-species, Niger,these very dark forms are known.WHY HAS IT NOT BEEN SEEN FOR 50 YEARS?There could be several reasons for that. I don't know specifically, but I canguess. First of all, it might have been rare to begin with.WHAT IS THE SIZE OF THE NIGER SUPPOSED TO BE?It's about the same size as the Steller's Sea Eagle. What we're talking about is theplumage variant. It's darker.IS IT POSSIBLE IF THE NIGER HASN'T BEEN SEEN FOR HALF ACENTURY, THAT SOME THING MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IN THEENVIRONMENT THAT THE NIGER IS GROWING LARGER?No. That's something that doesn't happen. They get to a size and stop. Again, theNiger is known as a form of Steller's Sea Eagle. It wouldn't be a differentspecies. It's only been described as a 'morph,' which means a different color type.So, Steller's Sea Eagle are seen rarely, but they are recorded from other parts ofthe Bering Sea like the St. Lawrence Island. They've been reported. But they arenot common by any means. Where this pilot was was very close to the AlaskaPeninsula. This is a bird that was very far out of its regular area. It's going tolook nothing at all like the bald eagle, which are common in the AleutianIslands and Alaska Peninsula."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"So, this would have been a very different, very big looking bird.But I wish they had a picture of it and would love to have a specimen becauseyou have described a bird that is probably 4 times larger than anything known inthis group. Knowing no more than what you've told me, I think people areover-estimating the wing size. I think if you check and talk with people whowork with birds like condors, that have very large wing spans, you get peoplesaying they have 15 foot wing span, when in fact they have about six.IF THIS IS AN ANOMALY AND ALL THESE EYEWITNESSES AREDESCRIBING SOMETHING THAT DOES HAVE A WING SPAN OF ABOUT14 FEET. IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY, THERE HAS NOT BEENANYTHING FLYING WITH WINGS IN THE AIR OF THE EARTH WITH A14 FOOT WING SPAN SINCE AT LEAST THE DINOSAURS?Wel l (l au gh s) n o w I'm go in g t o h ave What I'm thinking about in 14 feet is a Pterodactyl.So, I would have to say that everything except the wing span matches almostprecisely with a Steller's Sea Eagle. For people who haven't seen them, it's goingto be startling and different and they could easily pick up a rabbit, even a largeranimal. I myself am fooled about lengths and distances all the time. So, I don'tknow about them, but I'm saying that 14 feet is beyond anything we know rightnow in birds. And certainly, it's beyond 2 or 3 times anything we know foreagles.AND REAFFIRMING TO SOME EXTENT WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THENIGER STELLER'S SEA EAGLE, THE PILOT, JOHN BOUKER, STRESSEDWITH ME THAT WHAT REALLY CAUGHT HIS EYE WAS THEENORMOUS SIZE OF THE TAIL FEATHERS AND HOW THEY SPANNEDOUT.Let me ask you, did he say they were all dark? Or any white on the tail.HE SAW NOTHING BUT THE DARK COLOR. I ASKED HIMSPECIFICALLY ABOUT COLORATION AND HE SAID THERE WASN'TANY.The adult forms of Niger have a white tail band at the terminal tip. So, all dark iscertainly Niger, the Niger form of Steller's Sea Eagle. White bands on tails arehard to see sometimes, particularly if they are up against a white background.But this could have been an immature as well, and the white hadn't developed.But again, we're talking about a bird that hasn't been studied very well.This is really neat. This is a bird that we know hardly anything about and largeor small, or white morph or dark morph. And so when you're talking about abird with a total population that is roughly 7,000 birds, they are extremelysensitive to habitat and by shooting. People love to shoot big birds. They breedin old growth forests that have been cut down. This is good news. this is a goodnews story. We have a record of a rare bird way out of its distribution whichimplies that there is something positive going on, I think.\"Credits"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
