Video © 2002 by Don Kreinbrink. May 2, 2002 Toronto, Ontario, Canada - Last week on Coast to Coast AMradio, I reported about the enormous triangle of what looked like stars movingslowly through the starry sky above eight of us at the Piney River valley look outnorth of Dover, Arkansas on April 14. I also interviewed a NASA Goddardscientist about cluster satellites that travel in fours to see if that could explainwhat we all saw near Dover, but he checked orbital logs and said none of thosecluster satellites were on the night side of earth on April 14. (See: Real X-Files04/22/02 and 04/27/02.)Since then, I have received more than two hundred e-mail reports from all overthe world about other triangle formations of stars or lights in the sky that movein baffling ways that cannot be satellites. But among these reports, severalpeople have sent information about classified U. S. Navy spacecraft that movetogether in triangle patterns - and are definitely satellites known as the NavalOcean Surveillance System, or NOSS. The first experimental NOSS launch wasin 1971. There were several \"generation one\" launches in the 1980s and \"secondgeneration\" launches began in 1990, continuing in 2001 with perhaps an evenmore advanced system and another launch scheduled for November 2002. Afterthe military classified their orbits secret in 1983, none but those with a need toknow were supposed to find them. But their is a small, global group of satellitehunters and trackers who welcome the challenge of figuring out the orbits ofsecret military payloads and finding them with binoculars and telescopes.One of those men is a satellite hunter from Toronto, Canada named TedMolczan. He is an energy analyst and his hobby since the 1960s has been tocalculate satellite orbits with other independent satellite hunters. He has become"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"an expert on the secret U. S Navy NOSS satellites, which he is convinced is theanswer to our April 14 Dover, Arkansas triangle. This week I also called theNavy Department in Washington, D. C. to try to confirm with an official militaryspokesperson, but despite my repeated inquiries, no one has replied.What I have learned from Ted Molczan is that currently there are three groups ofNOSS triple satellite clusters orbiting earth moving at 4 miles a second at morethan 600 miles altitude, covering most of the planet every day. Usually theNOSS are around magnitude 6 in brightness, too faint for most human eyes. Butoccasionally, their brightness can increase depending upon sun angle andsurface glint and become more visible.Their job is to scan for radio signals coming from anywhere on the earth's oceansin order to find exact locations of ships at sea. Because the satellites work in atriangular formation, it means as each detects radio frequencies, each satellite isat a different distance from the transmission source. Taking the triangulated dataand using mathematical formulas, the exact latitude and longitude of the radiosignals can be calculated.I talked with Ted Molczan about our Dover triangle sighting and the modernpurpose of the NOSS. I began by asking him if I understood correctly, the secretNavy satellites are not being used to help American navigation at sea, but onlyto focus on radio transmissions from foreign ships. Interview:Ted Molczan, Energy Analysis Consultant and Satellite Tracker, Toronto,Ontario, Canada: \"Exactly, because clearly we would know, the U. S. wouldknow where its own ships are. So what they are after are ships these arecreations of the Cold War. So when they were first launched in the 1970s, it wasobviously a Soviet military fleet aircraft carriers, destroyers and even submarinesif near enough to the surface would have been their (NOSS) primary target.In 2002, who would be the primary target off NOSS satellites?Well, that's a darn god question because clearly some things have changed. TheSoviet Union no longer exists. Possibly the Navy might have adapted thesethings so they aren't just monitoring the oceans. They could well be monitoringon land. And if you think about it, a radio emitter, there is nothing special abouta radio transmitter being on an ocean. It can just as easily be on the earth'ssurface. So it could be that there is a broader mission for these things thatextend beyond their original purpose which was generally thought to be oceansurveillance.So, in 1983 when our government classified everything concerning anymilitary payload, how did you all continue to find them after that?The way the process worked in the case of NOSS, one thing that makes the taska little bit easier than average is that they are just high enough up that theirorbits remain pretty stable. The main thing that makes the challenge in keepingtrack of a satellite is that if it's in a low orbit, say below 500 kilometers (311miles), there is enough atmosphere at that height, tenuous as it is, that there is adrag on the satellite's orbit that causes it to slowly decay.How high are the NOSS satellites orbiting?When they are first launched, they are approximately 1100 kilometers (684miles) above the earth. And at that height under most conditions, there is a littleaffect from atmospheric drag, but not much. And that means we can go formonths without seeing a NOSS and often we do have to go for months withoutseeing them because they are not visible every night. We will go through periodswhen for a few weeks we can see them at a given latitude and then the orbitmoves out of range. For example, it's not that they don't fly over every day."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Every day a NOSS will fly over most places of the earth. But sometimes, thepasses will occur in the middle of the day when the sky is illuminated by thesun. Then we can't see them.Other times, it will come through in the dead of night when the satellites areentirely in the earth's shadow and again, we can't see them.We need to observe them near twilight, either early in the morning or theevening when we have a dark sky on the earth, but the satellite is in range of thesun and able to reflect light.OK, how did the eight of us see this triangle above Dover, Arkansasbetween 11:02 and 11:05 p.m. Central Daylight Time?Uh, mostly just good luck. You happened to be in a very dark location, as Iunderstand it, no moon and clear sky.It was the pilot. He was looking at the sky at the Auriga constellation andthat's when he saw the triangular formation moving very slowly.Yeah, and so it was just luck. And if he had not looked up at that time, it wouldhave gone unnoticed.Right. Is there anything about the Auriga constellation and that path fromAuriga to Leo - which was the pilot's estimate of the track above us - thatrelates to what you know about the orbit of the current NOSS 2-1 threesatellites?Yes, it does. The first thing that I did, once I had that description, was to get thelatitude and longitude of approximately where you folks were. I put that into mycomputer program. And I then went methodically through each of the threeclusters of NOSS that are in orbit. There are three clusters, each one havingthree satellites. And so it was just a matter of asking the computer, OK, for thisparticular date and time, were any of these passing within range. And with twoof the clusters, they weren't. But with one of them, it flew right over that area atjust about the right time.And the other key thing is that it did pass close to Auriga and the otherdescription that was given is that it was heading toward the Leo constellation.And indeed this thing was exactly on track for the Leo constellation. Those weretwo facts the date, time, direction of travel relative to constellations, those werekey pieces of evidence. And there was more than that.Meaning?The other thing that was interesting is that several of the observers noted thatwhen these things got overhead, they faded. Now, in one case, it was describedas they stopped, the way the observer perceived it.That is exactly the way it looked, as if it stopped and melted into the skysomehow.Yeah, so depending upon the circumstances. Different people will perceivephenomenon in a different way,. And in this case, it was perceived by manythere as a stopping and then I guess as you debriefed one another about whatyou saw, one of the observers gave a description that particularly matches what Ican compute, knowing the orbit of these things. And that is what each object didwas gradually over a short period of time, maybe a few seconds, they faded intoinvisibility. And they didn't fade simultaneously, but they faded in a sort ofstaggered effect. One of them faded and soon after another and then the other.And that's exactly what you would expect because what was happening is theywere entering the earth's shadow.Meaning each of the three NOSS satellites?Yeah, and because each are in different positions they are roughly 50 to 60kilometers apart from each other (about 37 miles) at the speed they are traveling"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"which is roughly 7 kilometers per second (about 4 miles/second) almost mindboggling to think of that kind of speed there could easily be a span of 5 to 10seconds over which different ones would hit the earth's shadow.Even at the 11 o'clock in the evening, central daylight time?Yeah, they are up quite high indeed orbiting, so for them it is from that vantagepoint, sunset is going to come much later than it is going to come for someoneon the earth. So that's how you get this circumstance that you are well into theearth's shadow, so you have a nice dark sky. And yet the satellite is just outsidethe earth's shadow fully bathed by the sun, and so you see its reflected light.Many people who have responded to the program - and there are hundredsof e-mail responses - are describing triangle patterns in which the starseven move apart and back together and rotate around themselves. Thatcannot be satellites.No, certainly not. Satellites, whenever you see one of these things, one of theways you can tell it's a satellite and not an airplane or anything else, is thatsatellites don't make any abrupt changes in direction.There are various data bases on the web where people try to compileobservations made of things seen in the sky that are unexplainable. And lookingthrough them, the impression I got is that only a small percentage of them arelikely to be NOSS. And that is based on the fact that some of them woulddescribe objects that make sudden changes in direction, had more than just 3points of light, or were the wrong color. Some of them would describe a redlight, for example. NOSS is not associated with any kind of redness. Somepeople would describe the object as solid. In other words, you couldn't see starswithin it. Clearly, that wouldn't be NOSS. So, just informally I've never tried tocompile any statistics - my gut feeling is that NOSS would not account for morethan 10% of the sightings around the world of unusual triangles.Only ten percent?Yeah, that's a guess.And what are those other 90%?I don't know. I've never had the good fortune to see one. So, with these things about all that anyone can do is try to have the presence of mind to make goodobservations and report them.\" We b s it e s :To read the archives of satellite observers and make your own reports, visit:http://satobs.orgTo report anomalous phenomenon not consistent with satellite motion, go to:http://www.narcap.org (National Aviation Reporting Center on AnomalousPhenomena)http://www.nwlink.com/~ufocntr (National UFO Reporting Center)http://www.mufon.com (Mutual UFO Network) And e-mail me, Linda Moulton Howe:earthfiles@earthfiles.com Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
