December 28, 2002 Broomfield, Colorado - For additional update, please seeMore Information below from Stanton Friedman. Since the mid-1990s,aerospace engineer, Robert Wood, Ph.D., and his son, Ryan Wood, a"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"mathematics and computer science professional, have taken on the challenge oftrying to prove - or disprove - the authenticity of several hundred pages ofallegedly leaked U. S. government documents about \"flying saucers,\"\"extraterrestrial biological entities,\" \"interplanetary\" technologies, andMajestic-12, a highly classified government unit set up by President Harry S.Truman in 1947 to study and keep secret the presence of non-humans on thisearth.The main source of the government papers which have alluded to an importanttechnology recovery in 1941 has been a man named Timothy Cooper whosefather worked at White Sands in the 1940s. Twice Timothy has found in hismailbox a large stash of alleged classified government documents from one ormore anonymous sources. The latest delivery was July 2001 and the postmarkon the package was \"from Virginia.\"Inside were 23 pages of new documents, not originals, but photocopies of oldonion skin copies of original documents. The tissue-thin onion skin paper hadbled through from the back side making them very difficult to read. Dr. Woodused a magnifying glass in the summer of 2002 to painstakingly translate all thepages into clean, easier to read copies at Bob and Ryan Wood'swww.majesticdocuments.com website.This weekend, I talked with Ryan Wood about one of the 5-page papers entitled,\"UFO Technology and the Imbalance of Power\" by Dr. Edward Teller, physicistand former director of the \"Star Wars\" Space Defense Initiative (SDI) program inthe Ronald Reagan administration of 1980 to 1988. Dr. Teller describes in hispaper an \"extraterrestrial scientific revolution\" and states the following:\"We are not engaged in an arms race, but rather in a race of perfecting anintegrated program of UFO technology (including extraterrestrial plasmaweapons and Electro-Magnetic Pulse devices.) ...But our scientists will notturn to national defense unless they perceive an actual danger to theUnited States. A danger was perceived in 1939, only two years before aUFO was captured (1941), and Pearl Harbor (attacked by Japanese).

Stanton first located and interviewed CharletteMann, granddaughter of a Southern Baptist minister, who allegedly said prayersin April 1941 over three non-human bodies at a crash site near Cape Girardeau,Missouri. Ryan Wood has also been able to confirm that there was a fire in theHouck Woods outside Cape Girardeau in April 1941, the same month thatCharlette Mann says her grandparents, Rev. William Huffman and his wife,Floy, had Charlette's father and pregnant mother as house guests beforeCharlette's sister was born in early May 1941.Interviews:Ryan Wood, President, www.majesticdocuments.com, Broomfield,Colorado: \"I think the 1941 reference in both Edward Teller's paper and theWhite Hot Intelligence Estimate are an extremely significant context for thetestimony of Charlette Mann that her grandfather, Reverend William Huffman,prayed over the dead and dying bodies of non-human beings at a crash site nearCape Girardeau, Missouri in 1941."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Southern Baptist Reverend William Huffman who began hisministry in Cape Girardeau, Missouri in 1941.

I've seen it many, many times. Andit was a picture of a little alien being that was held up under the arm pits. Therewas a man on either side and they had one hand under the arm pit and thenfurther out on the arm because the little guy had much larger, longer arms thanwe have. And I grew up seeing that occasionally at home. I didn't think muchabout it as younger. But as I grew older, I began to ask questions about itbecause I was always very fascinated with the eyes. I wasn't afraid of themexactly, but they haunted me.My grandmother became ill with cancer and so she spent a great deal of time inmy home taking chemotherapy and staying with us until she was a little bitstronger. That was shortly before her death that I began to ask her questions.And I tried to make them very open ended. I didn't want to lead her intoanything and I asker her if she recalled that evening when grandfather hadreceived a call. And it took me quite a few days to even convince her after allthese years and grandfather having passed away quite some time ago to breakthat bond or confidence that they had made. Grandfather and this is how it wasrelated by my grandmother and then I knew if it came out of my grandmother'smouth, I knew it was correct.WHEN WAS SHE ILL AND DYING, WHAT YEAR?It was in 1983 to 1984 and passed away I'm not good with dates it was in theyear of 1984, I believe. She was here at my home. She lived in Missouri at thetime, but I brought her here and she stayed in my home.IN TEXAS.Ye s .AND DURING THAT TIME IN 1984 BEFORE SHE PASSED, THAT'S WHENYOU WERE ABLE TO HAVE SOME KIND OF CONVERSATION WITH HERABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN CAPE GIRARDEAU, MISSOURI IN 1941.Right.DID SHE EVER SUGGEST A MONTH OR A DATE?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"We talked about it and she thought, and I still strongly believe, that it was thelatter part of April. The reason being is that my mother and father were therevisiting grandmother and grandpa and she was expecting my sister. My sister wasborn on May 3, 1941. And so, they had been there 3 or 4 weeks before Motherdelivered.OK, APRIL 1941. WHAT DID SHE TELL YOU ABOUT WHAT SHEREMEMBERED?Well, they were sitting around visiting and it was 8 or 9 o clock of the evening.The phone rang and grandfather went to the telephone. He talked for a little bitand hung up the phone. What was said at that time was that someone from, hadcalled the police department, or we assumed it was the police department, andthey had reported what they saw was a plane crash, that the person whoseproperty it was on had seen it. It had landed into a field and there was some fireassociated. So, they asked if grandfather would be willing to go out with them tothe scene in case there were some people who might need prayer or assistancebecause they weren't quite sure what they were headed to.So, he agreed to do that and a car was sent for him. They picked him up. I don'tknow how long he was gone. She didn't ever tell me that, but for awhile. It waslater because they stayed up late to wait. When he came back, he was veryshaken and it took a lot to shake my grandfather. She said that he set down andtold her, 'I'm going to tell you what has happened. You can never repeat it and Iwill never speak of it again.'And he said that when he got out there that it wasn't a crashed plane at all.There were some civilians. We assume probably people who lived near the farmwhere it had crashed, near the people who had placed the call. Neighbors. Ibelieve there was a newspaper man from the newspaper. I believe there mighthave been fire people at the time. But some civilian people.Grandfather described what he saw was a saucer-shape that had broken in halfand you could walk up to see inside. He saw a lot of panel of things he didn'tknow. Gauges, different things and small little seats that looked children-sized.The thing that seemed to impress him the most and intrigued him the most wasthere was a band around it of a type of metal that he was not familiar with. Itlooked as if it had hieroglyphic, like Egyptian-type, writing that he assumed waswriting.THE SYMBOLS WERE ON THE WALLS INSIDE THE CRAFT?On the inside. And that there were three beings, thrown. They were on theoutside and assumed they were thrown out (by the crash). One was stillbreathing, was not dead. Grandfather knelt down next to him and he expired,but he prayed over each and every one of them.\" 1999 Drawings by Charlette Mann Based on Her Memory of the 1941PhotographIn 1999, Charlette Mann drew what she remembered seeing in the photographthat her father kept of the 1941 incident. Around her drawing, she wrote: \"MyGrandfather stated that the being was not alive at the time of this picture beingtaken. The picture was approximately 9 inches by 9 inches and had scalloped(white) edges. This is how the little Alien was being held in the picture I saw ofmy grandfather's (incident). There were some trees. The grass was ankle high anddeeper in places. I was so fixed on his eyes I don't recall as much other details asI might have.\" She also noted that the man on the right in her drawing \"had ondress slacks, wide brimmed hat. They both had white shirts on.\" The man on theright had \"his sleeves rolled up. The other had a short waist coat jacket. Therewas no one else in the picture except these three.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Drawings Â© 1999 by Charlette Mann. It seemed to be a child-sized being, probably 4 feet tall, maybe. It was difficultto tell if it had on a metallic suit or if its skin it kind of looked like crinkledaluminum foil, but soft. I stated in speaking about it since then, he looked as ifhe had no bone structure, but kind of like octopus tentacles would appear softlike that. Very large oval eyes. I have never ever seen anything like it until at onepoint several years ago, I saw Whitley Strieber's book cover on Communion, andthat alien being, that face, was the first I had seen not exactly the same, butfairly close. Larger head. The dark oval eyes. Large eyes. It didn't really have anose. It looked like two little dots, like someone had taken a pencil. and markedtwo dots. I don't recall the mouth. It was more as if you took a knife and slitacross. No lips, nothing like that."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Artist's rendition of one of the non-human beings that abductee and author,Whitley Strieber, wrote about and featured on the cover of his book,Communion Â© 1987 by Whitley Strieber.I can't recall the feet because I never could hardly get past those eyes. I do recallit had a small framed body. The arms were much longer than our arms. Theirhands I don't know how many fingers it had exactly, but I do recall that it wasnot formed like our hand. But there were less fingers and much longer.DO I UNDERSTAND THAT THE MEN ON EITHER SIDE OF THISNON-HUMAN WERE NOT DRESSED IN MILITARY UNIFORMS?Oh, absolutely not. They were there before the military got there.WHO DO YOU THINK THEY WERE?They were local people. The photograph itself was in a rural field-like countrysetting. In other words, it was grass that is grown up, or wheat or whateverhappened to be in the field. I remember there being a large tree in one area of it.There were no other people who were visible. There were two men, one on eachside, that were holding the alien up. Each one of them had one hand under thearmpit and then had hold of the arm further out, not quite reaching the wrist,but fairly close.AS IF DEMONSTRATING HOW LONG THE ARMS WERE, AS WELL?I think so, because they went completely across their bodies and were stillextended further out.The alien, I don't know how to describe it exactly other than to say it actuallydid not look like it had on clothes, but there were no physical male or femalefeatures. And it looked crinkled, kind of shiny, if you will, as if it could havebeen aluminum foil and crinkled. So, I don't know if that was a suit or his skin,but it covered every part of him. You couldn't see seams or buttons or anythinglike that.WHAT ABOUT THE NECK AND THE HEAD? WERE THEY COVERED ASWELL?No, they were out just normal. As I said, the eyes were looked just huge ovalwith blackness. No expression.NO EXPRESSION. WHEN YOU SAY AN OVAL, IT COULD BE VERTICALIN THE FACE OR HORIZONTAL OR SLANTED. DO YOU REMEMBER IFTHOSE EYES WERE SITTING HORIZONTAL, VERTICAL OR SLANTED?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Vertical, up and down.I SEE, VERTICAL OVALS.Yes. And two little dots for what I would have called a nose and a slit for themouth.AND NO EARS?I don't remember no, no ears like we have ears. I can't say he had ears, no. Icouldn't see a side view of where the ear might have been, so I don't know if hewould have had the same little dots like for the nose. I don't know. But no, notears like ours at all.IF THIS CRINKLY PART THAT SEEMED TO BE SORT OF METALLIC LIKECRINKLED TINFOIL WENT UP TO THE NECK AND THE FACE, BUT DIDNOT COVER THE NECK AND FACE?It did not actually that's why I say it's hard to know what you were looking atbecause there was no seam. It wasn't like if you have a suit and there is a collarwith a seam. It just blended or moved into. I don't know how else to describe it.DID THE NECK AND FACE COLOR IN THE B&W PHOTO SEEM TO BESIMILAR TO THE COLOR YOU WERE SEEING AS CRINKLED TINFOILOR WAS IT DARKER OR LIGHTER?Being a B&W photograph, it's hard to distinguish. No, it was not darker. Ifanything, lighter.WITH THE DARK OVAL EYES. AND IN TERMS OF THE FACE, HOW BIGDO YOU THINK THOSE OVALS WERE IN TERMS OF THE AREA THEYCOVERED IN THE FACE?Most of its face.AT THE ENDS OF THOSE VERY LONG ARMS, WHAT CAN YOUREMEMBER ABOUT THE HANDS?I do remember as if he had I don't remember seeing more than 3 fingers and theywere very, very long, much longer than ours. I don't recall seeing any fingernails,but I can't swear to that because I was so taken with the face. But I do know hedid not have 5 digits. That I can tell you. It seemed to be more like three andthey were quite elongated and both hands were the same.DOWN THE LEGS TO THE FEET?I don't it's odd. I don't recall seeing his feet. I just was too taken with the face. Inoted that he was, I know he had legs. But I can't describe the feet for you at all.I'm sorry, but I just didn't focus on them.OK. DID YOUR GRANDFATHER SAY THAT HE KNEW THAT THIS BEINGWAS DEAD IN THIS PICTURE WITH THESE TWO CIVILIANS HOLDINGIT? OR WAS THAT AN ASSUMPTION THAT WAS MADE?No, because he I think the picture was taken while he was ministering to the onewho he said still seemed to be taking short breaths. And so, the other two were several said dead on impact. So, he knew it was one of those that the picture wastaken of. How he came about he wasn't aware that that picture had been taken.But someone came to the house, this gentleman came to the house two weekslater and he seemed, Grandmother said, 'Very, very frightened.' And he wantedsomeone that he trusted to have a copy. Hew felt like someone should have acopy of the picture and he asked grandfather if he would take it and he did. So,that's how we came about to even having it.\" Military Arrives and Orders Secrecy in the Interest of National Security"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"While this was taking place, all of a sudden, military just showed up,surrounded, and overran the place. Grandfather was taken aside as were severalof them and they were told that they had not seen what had taken place, that itwas high security as far as the government (was concerned) national security.So, they weren't to speak of it.Nowadays, we probably wouldn't (obey). But in that day and time, if you said tomy grandfather, 'This is about our country and this is important and it will bedetrimental.' He truly never did speak of it again to our knowledge.So, I think they (military) scared some of them much more than it did mygrandfather. My grandfather seemed to be more shaken with the fact that therewere alien beings. But anyway, they (military) dispersed them. Grandfathercame home. That would have been that, except one of the men, a photographershad taken I guess a personal camera one of his own in addition to hisprofessional newspaper camera. He had taken some pictures. That was the one Ilater saw.THIS WAS OF TWO CIVILIANS OR FIRE WORKERS ...No, they were not fire workers. They were definitely two civilian people holdingup one of the deceased aliens.THE BEING WAS DEFINITELY DECEASED?This one, yes.AND YET IT HAD ITS EYES OPEN?The eyes appeared just yes, they did. I don't know if they have eyelids. I don'tknow. I can only tell you what I saw. I can't explain it. I don't try. I don't want totamper with it. I just give the account that was given to me. The eyes were veryvisib l e.DID YOU EVER HEAR ANY DETAILS ABOUT WHETHER YOURGRANDFATHER COULD SMELL ODOR FROM THE BEING, COULD FEELTEMPERATURE, COULD HEAR ANY SOUNDS OR HAD ANY MENTALIMPRESSIONS AS HE BENT OVER THE LIVE BEING TO DO PRAYERS?I don't think any of that in that kind of order was ever discussed. So, I don'tknow about smell. He did say about the breathing, that's why he believed him(alien) not deceased. There were a few short, shallow breaths. He did mentionthat. I can only say that grandmother said he was forever changed by it. He wasa southern Baptist minister for 40 years of his life, but he became much lessrigid, much more accepting of unexplained things after that. Now, that wasrelayed to me through my grandmother and my father. But none of the otherthat you speak of, I'm sorry to say.WHERE DID THE MILITARY TAKE THE CRAFT AND THOSE BODIES?We never heard anything else after grandfather came home and gave his account.There was never anything else mentioned.BUT IF IT HAPPENED IN CAPE GIRARDEAU AND POLICE AND FIREAND MILITARY WERE INVOLVED, YOU WOULD THINK THE ENTIRECOMMUNITY WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SOMETHINGEXTRAORDINARY HAD HAPPENED.Well, I would have thought that until the last few years in finding out what Ihave about our government and our news media. If you can keep the bomb thatwas dropped on Hiroshima a secret with the number of people involved and thenumber of people who worked on that, then I'm convinced they can keep, theycan really quell a story if they desire to. And I think it wasn't just their ability,but how it was presented to the people and how they accepted thatresponsibility at the time. I don't believe it was covered in the newspaper as whatit actually was. I don't know if you went back and traced the papers if there"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"would be a mention of a plane crash or I don't know because granddad knew ithad happened. He didn't need proof for himself and he wasn't going to talkabout it. And my dad just didn't go after the facts. I'm not sure you have to bekind of a researcher to know how you do that and I just don't know that heknew. I guess it's just if you have seen the picture, and we had that, we didn'tneed any proof and we weren't, my intent has never been I'm not out to proveanything to anybody. I can't answer all the questions correctly. I can only givethe account of the picture I saw and what was related to me.\" Ryan Wood Finds 1941 Government Mapping Aerial Photographs of CapeGirardeauRyan Wood: \"I guess from an investigator's point of view, my next directionwith this is to continue to focus in on the historical aerial photography and lookat what is available in the National Archives and blow it up to meter by metersize and ultimately finer to systematically review, eliminate and isolate the crashsite. I'm confident that it's been captured on the photography either in the springor the fall.WHOSE PHOTOGRAPHY IN 1941?The government's photography. Of airplane overflights in 9-inch stereonegatives, all part of the geodesic survey process of the United States. It justturns out to be fortunate from an investigation point of view that they happen tohave overflown Missouri in the target area that we wanted right on time.Thequality is much better with airplane overflying and I've looked at and blown upsome and I can clearly see houses and roads and fields and wagons and lots ofdetail and the description is that there is a scar in the earth where this happened.I would think if this was done in the middle of a field, there would be tramplingand so forth that would not go away at all quickly.THE PHOTOGRAPHS THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT WERE DONE FORTHE U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY TO MAP THE UNITED STATES?Right.SO FAR, STARTING WITH JANUARY 1 OF 1941 AND GOING FORWARD,HOW MUCH OF THAT YEAR HAVE YOU SEEN SO FAR IN THESEPHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN FROM AIRPLANES?The photographs were done in I think October 23, 1941. I've just focusedaround this area in Cape Girardeau and studied the map and identified 4 or 5potential probable crash site zones.THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE TAKEN FROM AIRPLANES ONLY INOCTOBER OF 1941?Ye s .SO THE EVENT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE HAPPENED BEFOREOCTOBER 23, 1941 TO SHOW UP?Right. Remote Viewing of the Cape Girardeau IncidentFrom an investigation point of view, I have wanted to thoroughly vet the aerialphotography. I have some other intuitives (remote viewers) who have providedinformation that still needs to be run down.WHAT HAVE THEY SAID?The intuitives basically validated Charlette Mann's story. Two intuitives I haveused one is Joe McMoneagle, a famous remote viewer. He clearly found the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"crash site mentally and described what was there, the scene.WHAT KIND OF NON-HUMANS DID HE GET?I didn't zoom in on the non-humans. I focused on: Are there any artifacts there?Describe the area? How can I identify the area? It was more of a tool to validatethe ground truth somehow.DID HE REMOTE VIEW THAT IT WAS NOT A HUMAN TERRESTRIALCRAFT OR BODIES?Oh, yes. He clearly said it was the crash of an extraterrestrial vehicle.

Like the stuff about Charlette and her family. However,the document shown in page 4 is very definitely a fraud. The handwritten'Approved Harry Truman' was lifted from a letter to Truman from RobertLovett dated Sept. 26, 1947. The hand written 'I am keeping for furtherstudy' was lifted from a letter from Truman to Lovett dated Oct. 28, 1950.A little history: During a visit to the Marshall Archives in Virginia, Ichecked their card file under Truman and picked out 23 items that he hadsigned or signed off on. I sent copies of these to several people, includingTim Cooper. It took me a while to recognize the items a few years later on the TimCooper stuff. My computer guy fit the hand written stuff from the phonyright on the original in no time. This holds for a number of the other phonydocuments such as the supposed directive to Twining which is anemulation of the one to Wedemeyer. The original handwritten items arethere in the book by Wedemeyer. Bob and Ryan (Wood) have been shownand told. I discussed this in my MUFON 2000 paper 'Roswell and theMJ-12 Documents in the New Millennium' which show the original andphony items from this very document. I can send you a copy if you wish. I also have serious doubts about the genuiness of the Teller report as well"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"as all the other Cooper documents. I can't say who created the phonydocuments or even why.
