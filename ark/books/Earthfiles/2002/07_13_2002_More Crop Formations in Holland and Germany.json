Diagrams © 2002 by Robert Boerman, Dutch Crop CircleArchive.July 13, 2002 Ubachsberg, Holland On July 8, 2002, Robert Boerman andBert Janssen of the Netherlands learned about a formation of three circles inUbachsberg. Bert went to the wheat field and measured the diameter of thelargest circle to be 11.80 meters; the smallest was 6.8 meters. He noted thatmany plants were standing straight up among the downed plants and showed nosigns of damage on the stalks as might have occurred if boots, boards and othermechanical devices had flattened the circles.

On that field trip, Bert discovered yet another more complicated formation ofthree rings in another field about 800 meters away from the three circles. RobertBoerman visited the farmer to find out what he had seen in the field and wasstartled to hear the farmer say his gatekeeper was alarmed to find the three-ringformation only one hour after he had been in the field doing chores and the cropwas normal. Three-ring formation that farmer said was not in the field at 10 p.m. and was there at 11p.m.the evening of July 3, 2002 in wheat field near Ubachsberg, Holland.Aerial photograph © 2002 by J. de Jong.Pole shot of interior inside three-ring formation.Photograph © 2002 by Robert Boerman."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Plants laid down in various directions inside the three-ring formation.Photograph © 2002 by Robert Boerman.Interviews: Robert Boerman, Crop Formation Researcher and Chairman, Dutch CropCircle Archive, Brummen, Holland: \"The first formation of July 3 atUbachsberg is very interesting because we spoke to the owner of the field andhis gatekeeper. They know absolutely sure that this formation was not there lastWednesday, July 3, at 10 o'clock in the evening. But at 11 p.m., there it was!Within an hour, it formed.Between 10 and 11 p.m. in Holland, is it twilight or dark?It isn't dark. There is some light.Did anyone hear or see anything strange?Not that I know.Would you or anyone you know have been able to make the formation inthe hour it apparently occurred?Within an hour, maybe six or seven people, it might be possible. But the time ofthe day, it's not really dark, I don't think some guys did it.Anything unusual in the soil or plants?I thought my nephew found some longer nodes, but another strange thing wasnot in the formation itself, but next to a tramline there were some cutoff stalks,but some were as if burned on top.Have you seen that before?Yes, in several formations in Holland before. In the three circles of the secondformation, I think there were also some cut off stalks.\" Baden-Wuerttenberg, GermanyA couple of days before, on July 1, in the southwestern German province ofBaden-Wuerttenberg near Salsbourg, a German researcher was surprised to findseveral small formations in a field of ripe barley. He called his friend, AndreasMueller, a college student in Saarbruecken who maintains the InternationalCrop Circle Archive on the internet. Andreas called photographer FrankLaumen to see if Frank could get some aerial photographs of the large field.Then, Andreas took off for Baden-Wuettemberg to search the barley on theground.The land there is a mixture of small woods and cereal crop fields. It is a region"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"known as Hohenloe that is filled with burial mounds and stone circles, verysimilar to Britain's sacred sites. Andreas found nine different patterns thatreminded him of Celtic designs such as concentric rings and clusters of circles.After Frank Laumen got the aerial photographs, everyone agreed this was thefirst time in Germany perhaps in any country that so many small, individualshapes had been found in one field. Several were clustered around a power pole.I asked Andreas about the sizes of the small formations.Five of the nine small formations first reported on July 1, 2002 in the same large fieldin the Bade-Wuerttenberg province and its Hohenloe region filled with ancient burialmounds.Aerial photograph © 2002 by Frank Laumen.Andreas Mueller in the white shirt investigated the nine small formationsin the same large mature barley field in the Hohenloe region of the Baden-Wuerttenbergprovince. Photograph © 2002 by Andreas Mueller.Andreas Mueller, Student and Producer of the International Crop CircleArchive (I.C.C.A.), Saarbruecken, Germany: \"They are rather small. Youcould call them mini-formations. The biggest one, the straight path, is quite longabout 15 meters, almost 45 feet. The single circle is just a few meters indiameter. Everything is in the range of a few meters and the cluster of the littlecircles, the biggest circle was 3 meters and the other ones are much smaller. It'sreally something I've never seen before, this clustering of mini formations.What I suspect is that probably not all came down the same night. This is whatthe condition looked like. It could be that some were discovered before byfarmers and were not entered and destroyed by walking around in them. So whatwe have is we find clearly the expulsion cavities as we find them in manyformations this year in Germany and in Hessen, the other area close to Kassel,and even here and also on the Isle of Rugen. It's very interesting to see that in allthese areas, expulsion cavities of nodes just occur on the third node of theplants. If you count from the root. It's always the third node that is exploded andvery nice expulsion cavities. So, they are all everywhere present."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Examples of node expulsions from formation crop in which tissue and water inside thegrowthnodes have been heated by unidentified energy system.

They look pretty similarto each other. They vary these pendulum design theme and they include circles,rings and the straight long bars similar to the pictogram-pendulum formations wehad in the early 1990s in England. They have pretty geometrical on Rugen.These other ones at Hessen and Baden-Wuerttenburg are completely anotherkind of construction and shape the area where the nine formations are. Sinsheimis not far away where the strange fingerprint-like spiral was in May.\"In Sinsheim, Germany about 20 miles southeast of Mannheim, the \"fingerprint\"pattern below was found by the farmer in his young barley field on May 26.Andreas Mueller investigated and reported, \"At the standing plants forming thecentre of the little central ring, the seed heads of all the plants were taken andthe top leaves of many plants were physically damaged. The diameter was about35 meters (114 feet) and like a formation that was discovered just the yearbefore in 2001 not far away, this new one seems to continue a Celtic orpre-Christian style. But we have to wait for the aerials for confirmation.\"Formation in young barley field near Sinsheim, Germany discoveredMay 26, 2002.

Thisyear as Germany exceeds 30 formations more than England it seems as ifthe Isle of Rugen and Baden-Wuerttenberg are more the focus?Yes, that's right. But also in Hessen in the Kassel area, we still have sixformations which is quite a number. Some German researchers have a problemin counting these nine formations as 9 formations. They say, 'They are in onefield, so they count them as one.' But if you are there, you get a strong feelingthat is not the case. That's why I count them as nine separate ones.We have a shift of focus definitely to Rugen. But we have this is the first year wehave a very good contact who lives on Rugen and he is quite an eagle's eye. Hedrives a car which sits a little higher than a normal car. He has a good eye forformations that have sprung up again and nearly vanished in the young fields. Hediscovers them and we are happy to have him living there on the Isle of Rugen.Probably there have been more in the past and just simply were not discovered.We also don't know what is up in the north of Rugen. Rugen is quite a big islandand nobody can cover the whole thing each day or weekend. The whole islandis known for its many sacred and ancient sites from before Christianity. I don'tknow if the Romans went that far. But it also was not Celtic before theChristians. It is suspected to be something Slavic or more northern culture thatsettled there. There are many rings and earth walls and standing stones andhundreds of burial mounds on the island. It is like the area that had circles from1996 to 1999 in north Germany and former western Germany, and that alsoclosely filled with the burial mounds that even the official ministry forconserving and archaeology. They do not make any complete listings to avoidrobbery and destroying by hobby archaeologists. These areas are quiteimportant. And the whole lower area which is in Baden Wuerttenberg is alsoknown for its many sacred sites.It is the same in England where there are so many burial mounds and stonecircles, that if there was one common denominator to where formations go,it appears to be some place where there were ancient burial mounds, stonerings or something like that.Yes, and the geography is important, too. Limestone is everywhere. Andthroughout England there is limestone where we have the focal points forformations.Limestone is also present at the Baden-Wuerttenberg, as well as on Rugen.Rugen is also known for its white chalk hills.Chalk is limestone.This is a very important point, I feel. Isle of Rugen Investigation of Formation in Phacelia FlowersReported June 29, 2002Formation on the Isle of Rugen near Goetemitz in a thick field of purple phacelia,clover and camomile. Aerial photograph © 2002 by Frank Laumen."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"For me, one of the most impressive investigations this year was when I traveledabout 1000 kilometers to visit the Isle of Rugen the end of June. I live inSaarbruecken on the opposite end of Germany. At least this formation made itworth (the travel). It was a formation again in the same geometrical style, thependulum thing, but it was not placed in a crop field, or grain field. It wasplaced in a field of beautiful purple blooming flowers. The flower is calledPhacelia used in years between wheat as crop rotation to fertilize. It is beautiful.It is very small, but very thick flower, so the bloom is very thick and flashy.Then there was a lot of clover and chamomile. So, it was a beautiful odor in theformation. It was mesmerizing.Purple phacelia flowers mixed with clover and camomile reported June 29, 2002near Goetemitz on the Isle of Rugen. Photographs © 2002 by Frank Laumen. Then we approached the actual formation and we saw how soft these verydelicate flowers had been pushed down without breaking, no smashing. Therewere no traces and there was a beautiful carpet of flowers in front of us that hadbeen laid down. We realized already walking through the normal field that wecaused a lot of damage. Each step you took, it cracked underneath your feet andthe flowers get smashed. So this was so impressive.Again, you don't have to have academic validation or knowledge about spiritualor esoteric background. It was simply by being there and watching what damageyou caused and realized there was nothing comparative to your weight and theway you leave physical traces in the field that caused this formation. One cannotexplain it to someone who was not there, really.But also for us it was very important that inside there were several plants ofoilseed rape and wheat growing in between, probably from the years before orcame there by the wind or whatever. Those single standing plants have neverbeen flattened by the source, the energy that made the formations. Only thedelicate flowers. There were no signs that they (rogue standing plants) had beenflattened at all, so which gives the possibility that we have here pretty goodevidence that the force, the needed force to press down a crop formation, getwell adapted to the resistance of the crop's vegetable media.Yes, biophysicist Levengood thinks that the energy is specific to theparticular molecular structure of the plants in the field that is going down."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Yeah, and this is the reason why the robust plants like wheat and rape,compared to the delicate little flowers, were not affected at all. This is quite animportant insight and we have to do further research in here.\"More Information:The Isle of Rugen is 35 miles long, 25 miles wide, inhabited today by about70,000 people and sits in the Baltic Sea off the furthest northeastern corner ofGermany. It is not far from the famous Peenemunde site that Adolph Hitler'sNazi scientists worked underground on numerous technologies and aerial craft.The island is limestone and the promontory of Stubbenkammer has white chalkcliffs that rise to 400 feet, similar to the white cliffs of Dover, England. Its chiefmodern industries are herring fisheries and chalk pits.Rugen is rich in prehistoric remains. Near Hertha Lake are the ruins of anancient structure which some call a shrine to the deity Hertha or Nerthus. Thegoddess Nerthus, Terra Mater, was worshiped by tribes along the south Balticshore.The island is covered with burial mounds and stone circles which reachback into Neolithic and Paleothic ages. In Germanic mythology, the world is notseen to last forever. The cycles of history are described as a monstrous winter inwhich all life will perish or an heroic conflict at the end of the world whenmonsters such as the cosmic serpent Miogarosormr will break loose andoverwhelm gods and men. The stars will fall, the earth will sink into the sea andflames will rage to the skies. But from the destruction, a new earth emerges andpeace and prosperity will return to the world and the gods.One of the most intriguing research notes I have come across is in an internetarticle entitled \"The Runge-Syppiewski Family Exploring All Things Polish.\" Itstates: \"Some think Rugen island might have been the home of the Greek templeof Apollo, in 500 B. C. Apollo was the god of light and the sun-god who lovedamber and amber was thus considered sacred. The largest deposits of amber inthe world, and those exploited the longest, were on the shores of the Baltic Seain northern Europe.\" We b s it e s :http://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.invisiblecircle.dehttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://home.clara.net/lucypringlehttp://www.geocities.com/Heartland/Estates/9538/Rugen.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
