The Antarctic Peninsula hasone of the steepest warming trendsof anywhere on earth and this event,the collapse of the Larsen B iceshelf, was the largest event of itskind in the last 30 years.\"- Ted Scambos, Ph.D., Glaciologist,Univ. of ColoradoThe Antarctic South Pole is covered by a continent the size of the United States.The Antarctic ice sheet which is 1.5 miles thick in some places, contains over 90%of the world's fresh water. The Antarctic Peninsula ice sheets that extendinto the surrounding seas are melting rapidly, whether fromglobal warming or local climate variations.March 21, 2002 Boulder, Colorado - Scientists have been warning since 1997that the Antarctic Peninsula and its Larsen B ice shelf were melting, but no oneexpected that by March 2002 the Larsen B would have disintegrated to only40% of the size it was five years ago. But it has and in its collapse, one of thelargest floating ice masses of the past thirty years has broken off. Nearly twicethe size of Rhode Island covering 2,160 square miles (3,250 square kilometers)and 750 miles thick, iceberg B-22 was photographed on March 11, 2002 by theAVHRR satellite and reported by NOAA, the National Ice Center (NIC) and theUniversity of Colorado's National Snow and Ice Data Center. The ice shelf hasexisted since the last ice age 12,000 years ago, and yet it disintegrated suddenlyover a 35 day period that began the end of January 2002.According to the NIC, the shattered ice has set thousands of icebergs adrift in"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the Weddell Sea east of the Antarctic Peninsula. Scientists are not certain if themelt of Larsen B has been accelerating as a consequence of global warming ormore localized climate variations at the South Pole. However, at the same time,the North Pole ice cap is also melting more rapidly than anticipated and somescientists calculate there could be open water during Arctic summertimes by2015 to 2030.This week I interviewed Ted Scambos, Ph.D., a glaciologist at the University ofColorado's National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado who hasbeen studying Larsen B. I asked him to explain the controversy about whether ornot the sudden ice shelf collapse can be linked directly to global warming.The oval iceberg labeled B-22, larger than the state of Rhode Island,broke off the Larsen B ice shelf at the South Pole which is rapidly disintegrating.Image courtesy of NOAA's AVHRR satellite on March 11, 2002. Interviews:Ted Scambos, Ph.D., Glaciologist, National Snow and Ice Data Center,University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado: \"We use the term globalwarming to refer to average warming trend we have seen when we take all thedifferent regions of earth and try to determine an average or general trend. TheAntarctic Peninsula which has seen a very profound warming trend, one of thestrongest in the world and I guess the controversy is whether there is anyrelationship to greenhouse gas increases in the atmosphere. Now, what we areseeing is an unprecedented warming in the Antarctic Peninsula, but the thingswe can observe by watching the ice sheet itself and the sea ice around it don'tgive us the kind of information or proof that we need to relate it to a specificcause like greenhouse gas warming. We can talk about the immediaterelationships between what changes climate in the Antarctic Peninsula, butlinking it to some broader cause is going to be tough. It's going to be a topic ofresearch for the next couple of years.This was the warmest summer in the Antarctic Peninsula to date. The AntarcticPeninsula has one of the steepest warming trends of anywhere on earth and thisevent was the largest event of its kind in the last 30 years.Does that mean that there is accelerated melt at the Antarctic that couldcontinue and that more of these Rhode Island-sized icebergs could keepcoming off, even perhaps from the land of Antarctica?What we would expect to happen next if the warming trend continues on thePeninsula is that the ice shelves that are further south and somewhat larger tobegin to go down the same process.From where those ice shelves are currently, it will take a few years for them to"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"reach the point where the Larsen B reached. But more importantly, what wethink we understand now is how this process works, how the ice shelf isweakened, we understand pretty visibly how rapidly this can all happen.The ice shelf is floating, so what happens is that you'll get a little bit of meltpooling on the surface. What that means is that any small crack that forms onthe surface can fill all the way to the top with water. And because the water isdenser than the ice, you actually get pressure at the tip of that crack. And thatpushes these cracks deeper into the ice than they ordinarily go. And becausethere's actual ponds of melt, not just wet snow, but ponds of melt on the surface,you've got a reservoir of water so you can keep these cracks full as they start toopen. That seems to be the major step that sends all these rifts racing across theice shelf and fracturing it sort of in place. There are probably some otherprocesses that are involved as well, but once it is weakened like that, any stormor tide surge or wind surge comes along and just blows the smaller pieces out ofthe way. That's very different looking from how ice shelves normally behave.Normally they are sort of like this large fingernail growing off the edge of theAntarctic and every ten, thirty or fifty years, a large area will calve off into oneor two or three very large icebergs. But not when an ice shelf is just sort ofdisintegrating - then it just sort of splinters and shatters and it retreats all theway back to the coast line. What Larsen B just showed us is that it can happenreally very fast.So we want to take what we've learned from the Antarctic Peninsula where theconsequences of a real change in large masses of ice and sea level, theconsequences in terms of sea level are pretty small. We can take what we'velearned in the Antarctic Peninsula and look around the rest of Antarctica andsee how close other ice shelves might be to going down this same sort ofprocess.Is it true that the Larsen B Break-up and disintegration is not yetcontributing to sea level rise?That is true. What we will look for in coming years is the glaciers that used tofeed the Larsen B ice shelf, we will look for them to pick up speed as a result ofthem not having this large mass of ice in front of them. That's the process thatcan contribute to sea level rise. Now, in the Antarctic Peninsula, the amount ofice that's up on the peninsula is pretty small. So, we don't think there is any waythat sea level could change measurably even as a result of this particular breakup. Other ice shelves, even though they are not showing any indications of beingunstable, it's been fairly stunning what has happened in the Peninsula, so thiscauses us to take a closer look at what it would take to push those ice shelvesdown the same road. And they back up larger masses of ice that really wouldhave an impact on sea level.Meaning that ice is melting much more rapidly than anybody had everanticipated, right?In the Peninsula, I would say that is a fair statement. We're surprised at howquickly warm summers can lead to the break up of an ice shelf. I would say it'snot by direct melting that is part of the issue. It turns out that only a little bit ofmelting actually weakens the ice tremendously and then it fractures away.But I don't want to get too alarmist about this. I think it would take a trend ofseveral decades in these other areas in Antarctica to even begin to bring theother ice shelves to the point that the Antarctic Peninsula is currently at.But isn't that what scientists were saying just about a decade ago aboutLarsen B?We noticed there was some retreats of other ice shelves in the AntarcticPeninsula in about the mid 1990s. The pace and the areas that were beingaffected really started to pick up and in particular the Larsen B did a pretty fastturn around from what we call stable behavior to retreating all the back, well, todisappearing essentially. And that's a stunner. That's interesting, so we want to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"take what we've learned. We did have our eyes trained on the Larsen B and hadpeople out there in Argentina out there in the field in November makingmeasurements. They sort of alerted everyone that this might be the last year itwould be around.When do you think ice on land in Antarctica will perhaps start movingoutward and into the sea?Ice is fairly stiff, thick, cold substance you can't suddenly accelerate it by toomuch. There's just too much resistance to flow there. But within the next fewyears, you'll see the glaciers that fed the Larsen B begin to pick up speed. Whathappened in the Larsen B caused us to take a second look at areas that wethought were stabile because it turns out that the summer temperatures and thisvery minor amount of melt really can have a profound effect. That means thatthings progress more non-linearly than we thought before.What do you think is most vulnerable next in ice shelves?Well, the next ice shelf to the south is probably the next one that would beliable to go down the same road. There are also some ice shelves on the oppositeside of the Peninsula that have already shown signs of minor break up that maydo something dramatic again like the Larsen did. I think the next time we wouldmake any major announcement or attempt to call attention to what's going on,we'd need to see it in a different area because the story in the Peninsula is beingwritten down pretty well right now. We think we understand what's going onthere.Will Larsen B be gone completely in the next year or two?I don't know the remaining 40% isn't quite as close as the northern two-thirdswas. So, I think two, three, five more warm summers before that area disappears.Further to the south, maybe a decade or so from now, there might be a change.That's just me speculating. I wouldn't want to have anybody mark it on theircalendar or anything.When Larsen B is completely gone, what happens when that opens up moreof the remaining ice shelf to melt?It will change the climate locally. There will be ocean in areas that used to becovered with a thick plate of ice. It will change the climate on the glaciers thatused to feed the ice shelf. You might get some more snow fall which mightactually counteract any contribution to ocean sea level rise, at least partiallycounteract it.Because of more moisture?Right, reaching the coast line and blowing up over the colder, higher areas.Isn't that one of the confusions about the fact that the Ross Ice Shelf hasbeen building up snow and ice while icebergs still calve from it in a generalglobal warming?That's true. Most of the rest of the Antarctic is still reacting to more or less theend of the last Ice Age. It's a very slow moving, ponderous system. It takes a longtime to perturb it. As far as the (Ross) ice sheet is concerned, most of the thingswe are seeing are really inherited from climate, major climate change, thatoccurred 12,000 years ago. The point is that what happened in the Peninsulawith these ice shelves shows us a way where recent, fairly sudden climatechange could sort of reach out and upset that more slowly progressing systemand cause things to change faster than we had thought, well, faster than we hadseen up to now.But the main point about climate change in general and sea level rise inparticular is that it's going to be a very expensive thing to deal with. We're goingto have areas that are going to need to be protected more often than they used tobe. Or we're going to have to start thinking about building earthworks or dikes or"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"whatever in order to hold back areas that occasionally flood nowadays and theywill start to flood more frequently in the future.\"The North Pole Is Melting, TooThe North Pole's Arctic ice floats on water, so its melting does not contribute to sea levelrise.But if Greenland's land based ice sheet began to disintegrate and fall into the ocean, sealevel rise would accelerate.Since 1979 and improved satellite records for the Arctic, scientists have reporteda general decline in the extent of Arctic sea ice cover. That downward trend hasbeen roughly 3% a year. While the area of ice cover has gotten smaller, the icehas also thinned, losing an estimated 42% of its mass. The biggest change occursin the Arctic summer months which have been progressively warmer the past fewyears. Some scientists project that the Arctic Sea could be entirely ice-freeduring the summer as early as 2015 to 2030. I asked a research scientist at theUniversity of Colorado's National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) whostudies the Arctic if he agrees that an ice-free ocean at the pole is in the nearfuture and if so, what effect might that have on North American climate.Mark Serreze, Ph.D., Research Scientist, National Snow and Ice DataCenter (NSIDC), CIRES, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado: \"I amskeptical to see in 2015 to 2030 that we would see the complete ice coverdisappear in summer. It's still cold in winter so some ice is going to form. Andcertainly it will melt more if we continue current warming trends. But I wouldbe skeptical to see it happen that early.But, let's say we did lose the ice cover. One of the things it does is exacerbatethe warming, the global warming. Amplifies it.Meaning, increases global warming.That's right. It has a positive feedback process. For example, the ice is a veryreflective medium which means that most of the solar radiation hitting thesurface is reflected back out into space. This is one of the reasons why the Arcticis cold, along with its latitude.Because it's white and reflective.Because it's white and reflective, that's right.If that white reflection goes away ...?Then the warming becomes larger because there is a smaller area that isreflecting the solar energy.Another effect is that one of the important roles of the sea ice cover is toinsulate the relatively warm Arctic Ocean from the cold Arctic atmosphere."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Think of the situation in winter where the surface air temperature - that is the airtemperature a few meters in the atmosphere that we might measure with athermometer could be 30 degrees C., very cold. Now, underneath us is an oceanthat is basically at about minus 1.8 degrees C. Now, it's a little less than 0degrees C. because the salinity reduces the freezing point. But the point here isthat you have a huge temperature differential between the ocean and theatmosphere. The ice decouples energy exchanges that would occur. In otherwords, the ice acts as an insulating cover to inhibit these big exchanges of heatbetween the ocean and the atmosphere.If we were to have a thinner ice cover with more openings in it which might be aconsequence of more thinning and reduction of ice, we could have muchstronger release of heat and moisture into the Arctic atmosphere. Now whatdoes that do? We say warming, certainly, because we are releasing heat. Butwe're having other effects as well. For example, if we release a great moremoisture into the Arctic atmosphere, cloud cover is probably going to change.What will also probably change are participation patterns will change.Now the sorts of changes we might see in patterns of precipitation andtemperature would probably go well beyond the Arctic because the Arctic whenwe think about the tracks of storms, say. They are very strongly influenced bythe fact that the polar regions are cold and the latitude regions are warmer. Thisis what sets up your storm track which tends to steer your storms and allows thecreation of storms. If we change that equator to pole temperature gradient, wecould impact the circulation of the atmosphere on a much larger scale. So, thereare a number of effects that could be involved here.Can you say what might be the worst case in terms of North Americanweather?I think it would be extremely unpredictable, what would happen to NorthAmerican weather. It would be very, very unpredictable. It is very difficult tosay. I don't think it would be wise to say anything specific, but if you had acomplete loss of the ice cover in summer which meant that, for example, the iceis thinner and less extensive, that it has more openings in it, and it's thinner. Yes,you could certainly have some wide reaching climate effects, but I am notprepared to state what those would be in terms of like weather patterns acrossNorth America.You are a human being as well as a scientist living on this earth. What areyour greatest personal concerns as you look out into the future in thisglobal warming trend?I think it's just an arrogance in considerable part by the United States to inconsiderable part to ignore the problem, at least under the currentadministration. I think the evidence is there that humans are having an impact onclimate. It's difficult to say how much of an impact, but if you go with say, thefindings of the IPCC. I think we could, most of the scientists are convinced thereis a discernible impact of humans on climate. And we're conducting the grandexperiment and we don't know what the outcome is. And I think there is anunfortunate arrogance and reluctance on the part of the current Administrationto address the issue.From your point of view as a scientist studying at least the Arctic climate,what is the worst case you would present to President Bush if he continuesto ignore these patterns?Well, I think there are several things: one of them is sea level rise. This issomething that Mark Meyer from the Univ. of Colorado has done quite a bit ofwork on. If we would even raise sea level through the melt of glaciers and icesheets by half a meter, this could have very, very considerable effect.You're talking about only 18 to 20 inches rise?Only about 18 to 20 inches, but think about places like Chesapeake Bay, forexample. Great parts of that are essentially at sea level. A half a meter rise in a"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"mean sea level could basically lead to large reductions in coast line. It dependson where you are. Another problem would be larger storm surges, for instance.Take the case of New Orleans. New Orleans sits basically below sea level rightnow. Changes in storminess combined with even a modest rise in sea level couldhave quite considerable effects. I think there is a great deal of evidence as wellthat some of the effects of climate warming we've seen are being reflected in achanging frequency of extreme storm events. For example, extreme precipitationevents, things like this. So, one of the things I think we're starting to see is anincrease in these extreme precipitation events, extreme weather events, and weall know how economically significant these are.So, will there be a possibility of more super storms with higher winds, morerain, more severity?Yes, there's some evidence of that. Yes, there is a considerable body of evidencethat that could be the case. The argument for that is that if we warm up theclimate by a bit, the hydrological cycle becomes more vigorous. What I mean bythat is if we warm things up, then we'll evaporate more water into theatmosphere. when we have a moister atmosphere, there's a lot more that canhappen weatherwise. That's where that line of reasoning comes from.I understand that NOAA has recently changed - and it might be the IPCC -they have changed the estimate over this century to at least a meter rise insea level because of increasing global ice melts.That's right.That's about twice what you have just said.Yes, there have been some revisions on this and Mark Meyer at the Univ. ofColorado is one of the people involved in that, that the estimates we had couldwell be low. Let me reiterate that even a modest sea level rise could have verystrong effect. It depends on where you are. Here in Colorado, we're probably notgoing to worry about it too much, right?But if you're in New Orleans?If you live in New Orleans, this is something you might want to worry about.Do you think future sea level rise could make it impossible for NewOrleans to survive as the city it is?It's difficult to say. I'm sure they will try to make whatever adaptations they can.A lot of it reflects on our ability to adapt and one of the issues here is how rapidwill the change be? If the changes are slow, we can adjust, we can adapt.However, if we have a fast climate change that we can't keep up with, so tospeak, that's where a lot of the trouble may lie. It's our ability to adapt and a lotof that has to do with how rapid and how large will the changes be.Isn't that why this Larsen B break off is so significant - because ithappened so rapidly?That's right. That's right. We've been seeing worldwide what you call kind ofseemingly unique events, very unusual events. Now, are they happening morefrequently? Maybe so. You have to realize also with something like the Larsen Bor something like this that our ability to observe these things has increasedtremendously over the years. For example, before the early 1970s and even inthe mid-1970s, when we had satellite coverage, how much did we really know?so, one has to remember with respect in changes of extreme events, or eventslike Larsen B, one also has to remember that our ability to observe a number ofthese things has gotten a lot better.Is there any upside to global warming?You mean good parts about it?Right."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Well, you have to remember in any kind of climate change, there will be winnersand there will be losers. We talk about some of the doom and gloom, this iswhat you all hear in the newspapers. Sea level rise, coastal region inundated.Things like that. Not everyone is going to lose. Let's ask the wheat farmer inSaskatchewan, let's tell that wheat farmer that the temperature over the next fewdecades is going to rise by 5 degrees C.. That farmer would probably say, 'Well,bring it on! Bring it on! Because that means I have a longer wheat growingseason. That means I can increase my crop yield.'But it probably means there will be an accelerating extinction rate forpolar bears.Maybe so, but let's talk about another winner here. Let's talk about thereduction in sea ice. Let's say that in ten years, the shipping route along Siberiaopens up. In other words, the coastal route along Siberia will become ice free.Now, let's think about the Japanese. Now, that means if they want to get downto Boston, instead of having to go down through Cape Horn or the PanamaCanal, they could cut across the Arctic and greatly reduce their shipping time,greatly increase their profits by reducing their costs. So, there could be goodthings even there for some. So, there are winners and losers.Your own personal concerns?My personal concern is that I've said before I think that it's as a people, it's goingto be very difficult for us to change. And I think the current administration needsto take a great deal more responsibility and be a leader on the issue. What's thenumber? The United States has 5% of the population and uses 25% of the oil,something like that. That's arrogance. And I think if we are going to push theagenda further, try and really address the global warming issue, the UnitedStates must take the lead. There is no ifs and buts about that. The United Statesis going to have to take the lead. And I don't see that happening. And I think tome that's my greatest frustration as a scientist.If we don't and carbon dioxide increases beyond levels where it is now,what do you think will happen at those levels?If the model projections are correct and there is a lot of difficulty in interpretingthese models, we could be in for some very serious trouble. Global sea levelrises now by a few meters (with much higher carbon dioxide levels inatmosphere). Now, we're talking big numbers. If we start to see, for example,significant loss of mass from something like the Greenland ice sheet orAntarctica, we could have greatly altered patterns of precipitation, for example.Areas that were good farm land could perhaps turn into drought areas. Orconversely, large precipitation increases in others. We could be in for a roughtime. It's not going to be in my life time or your life time. But this is somethingour children and their children will have to deal with and it will be on us. It willbe, the fault will lie with us.The biggest problem is the unpredictability of what is coming.That's right. That's right. If we look at the climate models, they can give us ageneral picture of what the changes are likely to be. but it is very difficult fromthese models to make specific statements about the magnitudes of changes inparticular locations. We're not to that point yet in our understanding. And that'spart of the problem: general unpredictability of the issue. We are conducting agrand experiment and we really don't know what the outcome is going to be.\" We b s it e s :http://www.noaa.govCredits"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
