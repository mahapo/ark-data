What made this e-mail unusual were the photographs"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"attached: One showed the imprint of a human body on a bed sheet with rightarm extended and scorch marks on the pillow; another showed dark scorchmarks on the wood ceiling above the bed also in the pattern of a human bodywith the right arm extended; a third photograph showed a lot of small, roundstones that reportedly fell out of the sky around 7:30 p.m. on September 15,2002, for several seconds right before a man named Urandir Oliveiradisappeared from his bedroom for three days.Odd imprint of body on Urandir Oliveira's bed discovered by the two dozenfamily and friends forewarned by Mr. Oliveira. Telepathically, he said, he had been told bythenon-humansthey would come to take him at or before 10 p.m. on September 15, 2002. Thelocationwas the Urandir and Jessica Oliveira farm in Coruinho.

Photograph © 2002 by Flavio Mori, Jr.Mr. Oliveira is 39 years old and was born and raised in Sao Paulo southwest ofRio de Janeiro. But some of his family lives on a small farm in Campo Grande,state of Mato Grosso Do Sul where he frequently visits. In the 1990s, Mr.Oliveira began telling people that extraterrestrial beings were coming in aerialcraft to a particular valley 100 kilometers beyond the town of Campo Grande.But he said he first encountered tall, blond-haired \"extraterrestrial\" beings in1976 when he was 13 years old in the country outside Sao Paulo. TheScandinavian-looking entities took him into a craft and put objects in his neckwhich the beings told him would \"facilitate our communication and interaction.\"Then in October 1998, his second abduction occurred in the Campo Grande,Mato Grosso Do Sul, region near a flat-topped hill or mesa. The story is that 70people were there to watch because he contacted researchers to say theextraterrestrials wanted Mr. Oliveira to be publicly seen taken up in a beam intoone of their craft. That event was allegedly videotaped by a TV station, but notape was ever broadcast and no one at the station would even acknowledge sucha videotape had been made.Mr. Oliveira's third abduction there was allegedly on Sunday, September 15,2002 - the event that left the body prints on the bed sheet and the ceiling.According to businessman Felipe Branco, who has known Mr. Oliveira since1996, the abduction took place around 7:30 p.m., September 15, until the nightof September 18, when Mr. Oliveira suddenly returned back to his bedroom at 9p.m.Mr. Oliveira does not speak English, but Felipe Branco does. Mr. Branco, anexecutive of Castelo Branco, Ltd., was educated at the University of Londonand runs businesses now for his family's ranches and holding companies in Riode Janeiro, Italy and Campo Grande. Mr. Branco was driving to see Mr. Oliveiraon September 15. When he neared the house, small, round rocks fell from thesky onto Mr. Branco's car and the surrounding ground. What happened next,Mr. Branco will tell in his own words.But first, there is now controversy about what happened. In early December,Brazil's Mutual UFO Network Director, A. J. Gevaerd, who publishes and editsBrazilian UFO Magazine, told me on the phone that the alleged Oliveiraabduction was a hoax perpetrated for publicity in order to scam money frompeople and make Mr. Oliveira and his followers rich. On December 13, Mr.Gevaerd sent an e-mail addressed \"To the International UFO Community: VeryImportant.\"The e-mail begins: \"Please be informed that the story of a man abducted inBrazil, with dramatic photos of the scenario, is a campaign to promote overseasthe biggest UFO hoaxer of all times in Brazil, Urandir Fernandes de Oliveira,who has actually created a sect of fanatics around him, composed of people whoblindly believe in his alleged ET contacts and healing powers, none of them everconfirmed by anyone. The man has been repeatedly exposed as hoaxer bydozens of UFO researchers and many people even from his sect, after 'waking upto reality,' have come forward to describe Urandir's tricks and scheme.\"A. J. Gevaerd further states in his e-mail: \"His history is all fake and the man isfastly becoming a millionaire with his obscure agenda, supported by thousandsof fanatics. ... This story is NOT to be taken seriously, as no responsible UFOresearcher has been allowed to scrutinize the scenario and the alleged case.\"Felipe Branco had also received A. J. Gevaerd's e-mail when I reached him bytelephone on December 13, at his Campo Grande office. Here begins hisreaction to the hoax allegation and his description of what he says he saw andheard on September 15, 2002, at the alleged abduction location."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Large mesa above Urandir Oliveira farm in Corguinho, Mato Grossodo Sul, Brazil, a geographical area of iron-rich soil that has had unusual light phenomenareported for decades. Photograph © 2002 by Flavio Mori, Jr.Interview:Felipe Castelo Branco, Executive, Castelo Branco Ltd., Campo Grande(state of Mato Grosso Do Sul) and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: \"Mr. Gevaerd hasnever done research in the place. Once, he tried to cut a deal with Mr. Oliveirato be the only channel of information and events happening in this area ofCampo Grande. But Mr. Oliveira refused and said he wants to give all theinformation to anyone who is interested.This area is very difficult to access. It's about 100 kilometers (62 miles) fromCampo Grande. It's in the middle of nowhere. We formed a UFO researchassociation, all the people who have been traveling there and doing research, wehave been gathering all those people. We are about 1000 plus members. So, webuilt up facilities there so we can go there and stay in a house, have runningwater and all the minimum facilities, to do all the research and work there.Otherwise, it would be impossible. So, when Mr. Gevaerd alleges that Mr.Oliviera charges a fortune for people who come to visit, it's a ridiculousaccusation. You can come and see it for yourself. We have very basic facilities,minimum to be able to stay there for a few days and perform the research for thepast six years.DOES MR. OLIVIERA SPEAK ENGLISH?No. He is a man of simple background.WHAT KIND?He has done high school only studies and he used to be in construction. He is avery simple man.WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF STRANGEPHENOMENA AT THIS AREA IN CAMPO GRANDE WHERE MR.OLIVIERA HAS ENCOUNTERS?It was a very shocking experience. I was already doing research in CampoGrande with Urandir. I have seen the ships, everything, beings. I have had manyencounters there, incredible stuff! But I was very afraid because I could neversee myself involved directly with this because it is very difficult to believe. Eventhough you see it in front of you, it is strange. It's like you are in a dream, likeDisneyland. I don't know. It's very strange and very difficult to accept thisreality.This last abduction that he suffered, let's say. When he was in the ship, he sawmany of them (alien beings) there. He saw the reds, blonds, short ones, otherswith olive skin, chocolate kind of skin not black chocolate or cinnamon andthey are working together, these people. I think they more or less are doing ajoint venture here.WHY DID THEY TAKE MR. OLIVIERA, LEAVING THAT IMPRINT ON THE"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"BED AND ON THE CEILING OF THE ROOM?The imprint well, Mr. Oliviera was aware he was going to be abducted for athird time. They had warned him. In fact, he called a few researchers there. Icould count 28, but there were more. And we were staying there and waiting forthis to happen. But he did not know that these marks would be left. He did notknow that. We discovered after.WHAT WAS THE DATE THIS OCCURRED?September 15, 2002. It was a Sunday.WHAT TIME?Between 7 to 7:30 p.m. Campo Grande time.COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN AGAIN WHY IT WAS THAT YOU ANDTHE 27 OTHER PEOPLE WERE THERE WITH MR. OLIVIERA?Because he wanted witnesses. This ET said, 'We're going to come and we'regoing to pick you up and you are going to stay with us for some time. While wepick you up, we are going to materialize stones as if it is raining. You know,those round stones? And we want witnesses.'So, he (Oliveira) warned all members of the association 'All who don't havework engagements who can be here in Campo Grande, please come.' So theycame. And stayed there the whole week waiting because he did not know (whenit would happen). The window of time was one week. We did not know when.So, people stayed there and it happened exactly as he said.ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY OF SEPTEMBER 15, WHAT WERE YOUDOING THAT EVENING AND WHERE WERE YOU AND WHAT EXACTLYHAPPENED LEADING UP TO THE DRAMATIC PHOTOGRAPHS?I was arriving in the compound. Five minutes before this happened, I wasarriving there because I had come back to Campo Grande after doing some stuff(at my office) and then I came back again. When I was coming back, I could seethese stones coming down from the sky. That was amazing! I stopped the car andlooked. 'What's going on? What's going on?' All these people coming, running,shouting, 'There, there, there!' They were pointing.There were stones falling. It was night. It was dark (except for car headlights andhouse lights). And I could hear my car (makes loud sound to indicate stonesfalling on the metal.) I wondered what was going on? You could see the stonesfalling. It looked as if it was raining stones.I picked up many of them. The other people, the other 27, they were collectingthe stones themselves. They could see them falling. There are lights there. Theycould see them falling on the roof and making the noise there. (MAKESTERRIBLE NOISE). 'Oh, my God!' they were all screaming, like they wereafraid. 'My God, what is going on here?!'Seven of the stones Felipe Branco picked up the night of September 15, 2002,from the ground around his car at the research compound in Campo Grande only minutesbeforehe and the researchers discovered Urandir Oliveira was missing from his bedroom and therewere bodymarks on the bed sheet and ceiling. Arranged in size order and photographed © 2002 byFelipe Branco."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The stones fell for like a few seconds, ten seconds or maybe 15 seconds, but itwas prior to his abduction. Then I drove up the driveway of his house. We triedto open up his bedroom. It was locked and we broke in and when we cameinside, there was this strange ozone smell and a sour type of smell. Very strange!YOU MEAN SOUR LIKE VINEGAR?Not really. I don't know how to describe. I would say sour is the closestdescription I can give of the smell. The ozone was very strong, but also this kindof sour, strange smell that I cannot identify.And we were all this bunch of people walking inside the room and the hairs ofour bodies were raised, you know?WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING YOU SAW INSIDE THE ROOM?I saw the marks! I looked and was totally shocked. None of us expected it. Wewere all, 'My God, what is going on?' We were afraid and surprised at the sametime. We said, 'What if he disintegrated? Did he die?' They were not scorchmarks (on the sheet). It was not scorched.DID YOU TOUCH THE SHEET?Yes, I did.WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE?It felt strange. It didn't feel hot. There was no smoke involved. Nothing. Just thisstrong ozone smell and this sour-type of smell. It may have been coming outfrom the mattress.IN THE PHOTO, IT ALMOST LOOKS WET. DID IT FEEL WET?No, it was not wet. It looked like a stain, more like a stain, not wet.YOU TOUCHED IT WITH YOUR FINGERS?Oh, yes, I touched it.SO YOU DID NOT FEEL MOISTURE AND YOU DID NOT FEEL HEAT?No, no moisture whatsoever.AND NO HEAT?No heat.WHERE THE LEGS AND THE BODY IMPRINTS IN THE SHEET WERE,DID THE TEXTURE OF THE SHEET FEEL DIFFERENT THERE THAN ITDID WHERE THE BODY MARKS WERE NOT?Yes, they felt different. They felt rougher, the texture felt rougher.WHERE THE BODY MARKS WERE?Ye s .YOU ALL STAYED IN THAT ROOM UNTIL HOW LONG? AND YOUCOULD SEE THE CEILING MARKS?Yes, when you looked at the ceiling, that was the craziest because it was like amirror image, you know? We were like, 'My God, he went through the ceilingand the roof.' We were very impressed. We stayed there for half an hour takingphotos, filming, and then we locked the room. We locked the room and put apadlock on so no one could come in because we were waiting for this Americanscientist who came and collected samples and took them back to the UnitedStates to do research."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"AND HE TOOK SAMPLES FROM THE SHEET AND FROM THE CEILINGAND THE WOOD?He took samples from everything and took it to the United States to do theresearch and said when he has finished the research, he will let us know theresults.HE JOINED ALL OF YOU OUTSIDE THE LOCKED BEDROOM TO WAIT?The American was not there at the moment. He arrived, I think, a couple ofweeks after. He was not present.YOU ALL LOCKED THE BEDROOM DOOR AND THERE WERE 28 OFYOU. DID YOU ALL WAIT THERE UNTIL HE CAME BACK?Yes. But I returned. I went back to Campo Grande because I had importantbusiness engagements I could not postpone. I had to return. But they all stayedthere.HOW LONG WAS MR. OLIVEIRA GONE?He left on Sunday (September 15, 2002) around 7 p.m. and came back onTuesday (September 17, 2002) around 9 p.m.WHEN HE CAME BACK, WERE YOU THERE? WHAT HAPPENED?No, I was not there. They called me from the compound and said, 'Please comebecause he has just arrived.' It was funny because the room was locked withpadlocks. We all locked the room to protect it. And he returned to the sameroom. They dropped him there in the same place. And he was locked there like,'My God, what is going on? They locked me inside.' He had to call and say,'Please come and pick me up!'The people could not believe. They ran and said, 'My God, you are there.' Theyopened the door and he was there locked inside the bedroom.HE ACTUALLY CALLED PEOPLE ON A TELEPHONE TO SAY TOPEOPLE, 'OPEN UP MY BEDROOM AND LET ME OUT?'It is an internal telecommunications system (like an intercom). Not a normalphone.WHAT DID HE TELL EVERYONE THAT HAD HAPPENED IN THATSUNDAY TO MONDAY TO TUESDAY TIME?He said that he was laying on his bed and was reading a book. Then the roomfilled with this violet light and he felt a fever-type sensation, like his bodyheating up. Then he saw himself being lifted and then through the ceiling andthe roof and inside the ship there. When he got there, there was this being andhe showed him this cylinder, transparent cylinder. He was put in there and thecylinder closed and there was this smoke around him. Then he saw himself withthis strange nylon type of suit, jumpsuit. But these did not glow, this jumpsuit. Itlooked like nylon. (In other encounter experiences which Mr. Branco, Mr.Oliveira and others have experienced, tall humanoid beings have worn jumpsuitsthat \"glow like neon lights.\")THIS WAS SOMETHING THE BEINGS HAD HIM PUT ON?Yes. They showed him to this transparent cylinder that he had to lay downinside there. Then as soon as it closed, there was this smoke that filled thecylinder. Then it was as if this jumpsuit materialized on him. Then he came outof the cylinder and they brought him to the big room with other beings there andwere telling him things and showing him things on a screen.NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT IN A SECOND.

But he said it is not as dramatic as people are saying.It is much lighter, the event is going to be much lighter, not as dramatic aspeople are saying. He said there are going to be like 'ice rocks' falling to theearth.ROCKS OF ICE?Yes, rocks of ice. He called them 'ice rocks.'THAT SOUNDS LIKE A POSSIBLE ENCOUNTER WITH A COMET?Maybe. He lacks vocabulary, so it's difficult for him to understand. He describesthings in a figurative way. But it is going to effect certain cities. But he could notrecognize the cities. They showed me the screen of these ice rocks falling andhitting these cities, but I could not recognize them. I do not know where.

But he said later on, these beings will provide information to certain peoplearound the planet to heal this because we will not have technology to deal withthese diseases.IF THE EXTRATERRESTRIALS KNOW ALL THIS IS COMING AND KNOWTHAT THERE IS BIOLOGICAL WARFARE NOW AND IT WILL GETWORSE, WHY DON'T THEY STOP IT?I asked that to Urandir many times. He said it has to do with direct intervention.They cannot directly intervene. They can help in a certain way. Also, theinteraction between us and them is difficult. You have to have your energeticfields, your personal vibrational frequency very balanced in order to sustain acontact with them. It is a very difficult interaction.DOES MR.

X-ray provided by Felipe Branco.Oliveira's Second Alleged Abduction on October 21, 1998 At Campo GrandeResearch CompoundWHAT WAS THE SECOND ABDUCTION?It was in Campo Grande near this place. There were 70 people present and acamera crew from television here.WHY WAS THE TELEVISION CREW THERE?Because the ETs told him, 'We are going to show ourselves. Bring a camera crewhere from a television because we are going to show ourselves.' He did notexpect to be abducted. They told him that they would just fly-by the place, aspecific place in this compound where we are now. He called the TV crew andbrought them there and there were about 70 people, 70 researchers of ourassociation there. I was not there. They all went up to the mesa-type hill thereand this ship came, glowing, and threw this beam of light down and pulled him(Mr. Oliveira) up. And 70 people witnessed it. It was filmed by a camera crewfrom TV. We never heard of this. Tape, everything, just disappeared.THE TAPE DISAPPEARED. IT WAS NEVER BROADCAST?Never. Never broadcast. In fact, there was a big quarrel at the time because partof the camera crew they were so impressed. One of them was fired. It was a bigmess. There is an effort to keep this information out of the public. This is clear.HAVE YOU TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH MANAGEMENT AT THE TVSTATION?Oh, yes, at the time. Many of us in our group of UFO researchers - we havelawyers, we have judges, we have many people from many walks of life. Acouple of friends were lawyers and they asked, 'Please, you must provide us thetape.' And the TV station said, 'We were never there. There is no tape. There isnothing.'

My mother'sfamily practically founded this state (Mato Grosso Do Sul). They have extensivefarms all over the state and I've never seen the stones anywhere else exceptwhere they've fallen when craft are around.Urandir says this area near Campo Grande is like a vortex. The energy fieldsthere are very high because of the minerals in the natural rock there. I have neverseen the stones anywhere else in Brazil, actually. We need to study themgeologically, but haven't yet.\"A. J.
