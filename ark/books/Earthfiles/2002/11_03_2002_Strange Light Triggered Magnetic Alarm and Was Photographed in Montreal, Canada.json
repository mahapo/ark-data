The bright object was moving northeastaway from the camera. Photograph © 2002 by ASEPI member,Jean L. from Saint-Jean-de-Matha, Quebec, Canada.November 3, 2002 Montreal, Canada - The Association for the Study ofStrange and Unexplained Phenomena (ASEPI) in Montreal recently contactedme about their experimental efforts to electronically detect and photographunidentified aerial objects. ASEPI (Association Sciences de l'Etrange &Phenomenes Inexpliques) is a non-profit organization focused on the study ofhaunted places, esoteric and paranormal events and unidentified flying objects.Louis Yaksa wrote on October 29:\"We decided to investigate the UFO phenomenon by creating anetwork of computerized UFO detectors. We are currentlyexperimenting with magnetic, gravity and microwave detectors. Weare getting results from our magnetic and microwave detectors. Everytime we hear of an observation report, we check our computer filesfor any detection. We have several computers recording 24 hours aday, 7 days a week, minute by minute. This research is highlyexperimental. We do not know if it will detect anything, but it seemsto work! We detected and photographed one!!On August 20, 2002 at approximately 21:08 EDT (9:08 p.m. EDT),our member Jean L. and his wife, Lina, in Saint-Jean-de-Matha,Quebec, got an alarm on their computer from their magnetic detector.Jean grabbed his camera and ran outside and took the pictureattached. They saw a white sphere, reddish on the bottom, whichpassed over their house heading northeast. The sky was clear and themoon was visible behind. When the object was above the mountains,it changed direction. The observation lasted between 3 and 4minutes.The camera used was a PRAKTICA, Aperture:2.8. Time exposure:1/60 second, Film used: ISO 400. Distance of camera from object: weestimate the object at approximately one kilometer and at 20 to 30"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"degrees angle above the ground and camera.Here is the one picture & the computer graph. These are 3 scans ofthe original negative (only one photograph taken) at different contrastlevels.At the moment this picture was taken, Jean L. and Lina only saw onebright sphere. We noticed the (detail of) three spheres in UFO-C.jpegbelow ONLY after print enhancements.Picture UFO-B is the original print from the 35mm negative,printed by a professional photographer at a photo centre. Picture UFO-A was printed at density (-7) pale from the 35mmnegative. Picture UFO-C was printed at density (+7) dark from the 35mmnegative,which shows a triplicate of spheres."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The purple spike indicates that ASEPI's \"magnetic compass\" detectorsuddenly varied intensely and triggered an alarm in the computersystemwhich recorded the event.
