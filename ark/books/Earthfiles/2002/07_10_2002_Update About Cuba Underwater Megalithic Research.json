They really are not easy tounderstand and I do not have any easy explanation for them in a naturalgeological process.\" Manuel Iturralde-Vinent, Ph.D., Geologist,National Museum of Natural History, Havana, Cuba July 10, 2002 Havana, Cuba A year ago in May 2001, I first reported atEarthfiles.com the startling comments made by ocean engineer, Paulina Zelitskyin Havana, Cuba about her finding earlier in 2000 \"possibly a sunken city builtin the pre-classic period and populated by an advanced civilization similar to theearly Teotihuacan culture of Yucatan. ...Researchers using sonar equipment havediscovered at a depth of about 2,200 feet (700-800 meters) a huge land plateauwith clear images of what appears to be urban development partly covered bysand. From above, the shapes resemble pyramids, roads and buildings.\" (SeeEarthfiles May 18, 2001.)

(SeeEarthfiles June 13, 2001, November 19, 2001, December 1, 2001, December15, 2001 and December 28, 2001.) The couple operates the Advanced DigitalCommunications known as ADC in Canada and Havana which contracts toperform deep ocean research. Originally, ADC had hoped to have a robot on the ocean floor by the summer of2002, but its cost of $2 million has been an obstacle. So far, the NationalGeographic Society continues to express interest in adding its resources andmedia production efforts to the exploration, but to date no official contract hasbeen signed. So, Paulina and Paul have taken on other assignments to pay billswhile periodically sending remote operated vehicles known as ROVs down topick up small rocks that lay on thick sand around the large megalithic stone\"structures.\" Some of those samples have gone to geologist Manuel Iturralde-Vinent, Ph.D.,who works for Cuba's National Museum of Natural History in Havana. Sinceearly spring 2002, Dr. Iturralde-Vinent has studied side-scan sonar images andvideotape from the half-mile-deep site and has concluded that he cannot assign acompletely natural geological explanation for the large, rectangular-shapedrocks that stand up on a vast, white field of deep sand spread over 20 squarekilometers. However, he is waiting for the first analyses of rock samplesexpected around July 19th. Until then, he is reserving opinion about thecomposition of the megalithic structures. However, Paulina Zelitsky describesthe structures are polished granite not indigenous to either Cuba or the Yucatan. This week I talked with both Paulina Zelitsky and Dr. Iturralde-Vinent abouttheir current research and theories about what might have happened off theextreme northwestern Cuba peninsula known as Guanahacabibes.Interviews: Paulina Zelitsky at her computer in Havana studying a pyramidal-shaped stonevideotaped at the half mile deep site in July 2001 by her ADC remote operated vehicle(ROV).

Paulina Zelitsky, Ocean Engineer, Advanced Digital Communications,Havana, Cuba: \"Samples that we recovered from the ocean bottom havejustified our structures that we call megalithic structures. The samples aregranite stone, completely polished, with some incrustations of fossils. Fossils oforganic creatures that normally live on the surface, not on the ocean bottom.This is very interesting because this is evidence that the whole surface sank tothe depth of 700 meters (2,297 feet, or about a half mile down).The area has been seismically active for thousands of years. And what we findon the ocean bottom are fractures from which the magma and volcanic ash cameout. From these structures we were able to delineate a configuration of the land"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"that sank because you can see them clearly. The land that sank is very obviousfrom our image of the ocean bottom. And you can see bays, like harbors, and it'sall at the depths of 900 and 700 meters.Geologically, does Dr. Iturralde-Vinent and others have any idea whathappened volcanically? Was it one large eruption or series of eruptions?Series of eruptions and as he is saying, it is still active. A series of eruptions thatcreated major tectonic movement to such a degree that land is sinking. Forexample, Cuba has sank and re-emerged a couple of times! But that was longago, geologically. Now, what happened more recently geologically is that landsank that joined to Yucatan islands between Yucatan and Cuba, they sank.Also, geologically and botanically in terms of organic life, Yucatan and Cuba the extreme northwestern part of Cuba which is Peninsula Guanahacabibes(Gwan-uh-cah-BEE-buh) are completely identical. Completely identical. It's thesame limestone and the same organic life and the same botanic and animalrepresented. It's very obvious that land that was joining that is now on oceanbottom is land that was joining Yucatan and Cuba. But this land was sinkingbecause of tectonic movement which were occurring. Of course, earthquakesand volcanoes were accompanying the tectonic movements. Tectonic movementis not something that moves softly. It is always accompanied by dramaticvolcano and earthquake activity.But we saw on ocean bottom where the bays and coastal lines of the island thatsank. We think there was a series of islands between Cuba and the Yucatan.There could have been sinking 15,000 years ago.One area between the fractures. Not on the fractures. It is between the fractureswas left undisturbed and just sank flat without fractures. On this area, we canobserve those megalithic structures, or constructions. And they have completelydifferent and independent delineation from geological faults, from our geologyof the sunken land, or the geology of island Cuba. Completely independentdelineation of their own.As if they came from some place else?We don't know yet. But it obviously didn't come from Cuba. That's one thing.The stone we recovered from ocean bottom is very polished granite. All of thepeninsula of northwest part of Cuba, all of this peninsula is limestone, veryfractured limestone. So, geologically, it (megalithic granite structures) is totallyforeign to Cuba. But it's also not known in Yucatan because Yucatan is alsolimestone, not granite. Granite is found only in the center of Mexico.It covers approximately a beautiful, beautiful, flat, clean area. Nothing else inthis area. And it covers approximately 20 square kilometers of this area. It's flat,completely flat. Huge white silicon field. In the middle of all of that are thesemegalithic structures surfacing out of it.What is the scientific consensus so far about how 20 square kilometerscould get down a half mile?The whole island sank. Probably what we think happened is that Cuba andYucatan at one historical time were both joined. But little by little, this land wasfractured into islands and sank to the ocean bottom. So, the land on which wediscovered megalithic structures sank somewhere between 15,000 and maybe50,000 years ago, which is quite recent geologically.What for you is the next most important step you can take to collect one ormore samples directly from the megalithic structures?I wouldn't be able to do any serious work without a robot to that is working onocean floor because I need stability in order to be able to make an opening inthe megalithic structures. We need to make an opening to enter. NationalGeographic is interested in investigating the site with submersibles. So that mightbe another opportunity."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Do the submersibles have the ability to drill into stone?No. Submersibles don't. They just have the ability to observe with human eyes.Or videotape.Or video camera, yeah. But it must be operated by humans.If you can get the special robot constructed and down there that costs $2million, you would be able to photograph with good light and be able todrill into a megalithic structure?Oh, yes. I would be able to make opening and enter inside the structures. What Iam the most interested in doing is to enter inside because if there are someartifacts, they should be inside the structures and not outside.Then if National Geographic, or other interested organization, can getfunding together, you might be able to go forward full time on research andget the robot down to both photograph and drill into the structures?Yes, that's right. And discover a completely new page in our history.\" Manuel Iturralde-Vinent, Ph.D., Geologist, National Museum of NaturalHistory, Havana, Cuba, who presented a scientific paper about the deepwater megalithic structures in March 2002 at an International Geophysicalmeeting in Havana: \"I do not yet know if the megalithic structures are granite. Ihave been working with the data provided by Paulina for three months and Ihave been observing the side-scan sonar images, the video images with somesamples recovered from different places within the area with the megalithicstones are and also from an area located to the south of this region.My impression is first that the structures that are in the megalithic area at the600 to 700 meter depths, I cannot explain these structures by any geologicalmeans right now. So, I am not sure that I can find a geological explanation forthe origin of these structures.So I'm clear the structures don't fit into any natural explanation currently?Yeah, we think that in natural geological terms, I cannot give a logicalexplanation now. So, I am not telling that they are artificial, but what I say isright now I don't have a good explanation as to the origin by natural cause ofthese structures. They might have an artificial origin. But in this case, we areopening into a very interesting situation because given the depth of thisstructures and if we calculate the timing when these might have been uplifted, itwill take us up to 50,000 years ago. (Meaning, when the land mass now down ahalf mile might have been above sea level.)This is if we follow the rules of the normal tectonic movement as we have beenrecording them in the past 100 years in Cuba. But these figures are well knownin the world. More or less, the sea floor can move down as quickly as 16millimeters a year. That's one of the very interesting issues that are related to thisdiscovery.Meaning that the area is still active seismically and you are seeing thatparts of Cuba are still sinking.Current geological knowledge and data indicates that the area is still very activeand sinking even now. We are not done with this research. We need to still domore research, collect more samples, provide more observation to be sure aboutwhat we are talking about. But something is very safe to say now is that we arenot dealing with blocks that have been falling down from the slope. They(megalithic stones) are very unique structures. They really are not easy tounderstand and I do not have any easy explanation for them in a naturalgeological process. That's my conclusion now. I need more time and more data"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"before going forward.\"More Information:If any organizations or individuals are interested in helping fund the severalmillion dollars needed to accomplish the deep underwater research of theCuban megalithic site, Paulina Zelitsky and Paul Weinzweig suggest writing to:Sylvia Earle,Explorer-In-ResidentNational Geographic Society1145 17th Street N.
