Photograph © 1998 by Bill Hamilton.Bill Uhouse: \"I spent 10 years in the Marine Corps, and four years working withthe Air Force as a civilian doing experimental testing on aircraft since my MarineCorps days. I was a pilot in the service, and a fighter pilot; [I] fought in after thelatter part of WWII and the Korean War Conflict, I was discharged as a Captainin the Marine Corps.\"I didn't start working on flight simulators until about - well the year was 1954,in September. After I got out of the Marine Corps, I took a job with the AirForce at Wright Patterson doing experimental flight-testing on various differentmodifications of aircraft.\"While I was at Wright Patterson, I was approached by an individual who - andI'm not going to mention his name - [wanted] to determine if I wanted to work inan area on new creative devices. Okay? And, that was a flying disc simulator.What they had done: they had selected several of us, and they reassigned me toA-Link Aviation, which was a simulator manufacturer. At that time they werebuilding what they called the C-11B, and F-102 simulator, B-47 simulator, andso forth. They wanted us to get experienced before we actually started work onthe flying disc simulator, which I spent 30-some years working on.\"I don't think any flying disc simulators went into operation until the early1960s - around 1962 or 1963. The reason why I am saying this is because thesimulator wasn't actually functional until around 1958. The simulator that theyused was for the extraterrestrial craft they had, which is a 30-meter one thatcrashed in Kingman, Arizona, back in 1953 or 1952. That's the first one thatthey took out to the test flight.\"This ET craft was a controlled craft that the aliens wanted to present to ourgovernment - the U.S.A. It landed about 15 miles from what used to be an army"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"air base, which is now a defunct army base. But that particular craft, there weresome problems with: number one - getting it on the flatbed to take it up to Area51. They couldn't get it across the dam because of the road. It had to be bargedacross the Colorado River at the time, and then taken up Route 93 out to Area51, which was just being constructed at the time. There were four aliens aboardthat thing, and those aliens went to Los Alamos for testing.\"They set up Los Alamos with a particular area for those guys, and they putcertain people in there with them - people that were astrophysicists and generalscientists - to ask them questions. The way the story was told to me was: therewas only one alien that would talk to any of these scientists that they put in thelab with them. The rest wouldn't talk to anybody, or even have a conversationwith them. You know, first they thought it was all ESP or telepathy, but youknow, most of that is kind of a joke to me, because they actually speak - maybenot like we do - but they actually speak and converse. But there was only onewho would [at Los Alamos].\"The difference between this disc, and other discs that they had looked at wasthat this one was a much simpler design. The disc simulator didn't have areactor, [but] we had a space in it that looked like the reactor that wasn't thedevice we operated the simulator with. We operated it with six large capacitorsthat were charged with a million volts each, so there were six million volts inthose capacitors. They were the largest capacitors ever built. These particularcapacitors, they'd last for 30 minutes, so you could get in there and actuallywork the controls and do what you had to - to get the simulator, the disc tooperate.\"So, it wasn't that simple, because we only had 30 minutes. Okay? But, in thesimulator you'll notice that there are no seat belts. Right? It was the same thingwith the actual craft - no seat belts. You don't need seat belts, because when youfly one of these things upside down, there is no upside down like in a regularaircraft - you just don't feel it. There's a simple explanation for that: you haveyour own gravitational field right inside the craft, so if you are flying upsidedown - to you - you are right side up. I mean, it's just really simple, if peoplewould look at it. I was inside the actual alien craft for a start-up.\"There weren't any windows. The only way we had any visibility at all was donewith cameras or video-type devices. [See the testimony of Mark McClandlish.SG] My specialty was the flight deck and the instruments on the flight deck. Iknew about the gravitational field and what it took to get people trained.\"Because the disc has its own gravitational field, you would be sick ordisoriented for about two minutes after getting in, after it was cranked up. Ittakes a lot of time to become used to it. Because of the area and the smallness ofit, just to raise your hand becomes complicated. You have to be trained - trainedwith your mind, to accept what you are going to actually feel and experience.Just moving about is difficult, but after a while you get used to it and you do it -it's simple. You just have to know where everything is, and you [have] tounderstand what's going to happen to your body. It's no different than acceptingthe g-forces when you are flying an aircraft or coming out of a dive. It's a wholenew ball game.\"Each engineer that had anything to do with the design was part of the start-upcrew. We would have to verify all the equipment that we put in - be sure it[worked] like it [was] supposed to, etc.I'm sure our crews have taken these craft out into space. I'm saying it probablytook a while to train enough of the people, over a sufficient time period. Thewhole problem with the disc is that it is so exacting in its design and so forth. Itcan't be used like we use aircraft today, with dropping bombs and havingmachine guns in the wings.\"The design is so exacting, that you can't add anything - it's got to be just right.There's a big problem in the design of where things are put. Say, where thecenter of the aircraft is, and that type of thing. Even the fact that we raised itthree feet so the taller guys could get in - the actual ship was extended back to"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"its original configuration, but it has to be raised.\"We had meetings, and I ended up in a meeting with an alien. I called himJ-ROD - of course, that's what they called him. I don't know if that was his realname or not, but that's the name the linguist gave him. I did draw a sketch,before I left, of him in a meeting. I provided it to some people and that was myimpression of what I saw, an art picture of an alien that is working incooperation with earth-people as told here.Sketch of J-Rod wearing a human man's shirt.Drawing by retired mechanical engineer, Bill Uhouse, based on entity'sappearance at science meeting with physicist Edward Tellerand other scientists in the 1970s or early 1980s.\"The alien used to come in with [Dr. Edward] Teller and some of the other guys,occasionally, to handle questions that maybe we'd have. But you have tounderstand that everything was specific to the group. If it wasn't specific to thegroup, you couldn't talk about it. It was on a need-to-know basis. And [the ET],he'd talk. He would talk, but he'd sound just like as if you spoke - he'd soundlike you. You know, he's like a parrot, but he'd try and answer your question. Alot of times he'd have a hard time understanding, because if you didn't put it onpaper and explain yourself, half the time he couldn't give you a good answer.\"The preparation we had before meeting this alien was, basically, going throughall of the different nationalities in the world. Then they got into going into otherforms of life, even down to animals and that type of thing. And this J-ROD - hisskin was pinkish, but a little bit rough - that kind of stuff; not horrible-looking,you know - or to me, he wasn't horrible-looking.\"Some of the guys who were in the particular group that I was in - they nevereven made it. You know, when they gave you the psychological questions, I justanswered them the way I felt and I had no problem. That's what they wanted toknow - if you'd become upset - but it never bothered me. It didn't amount tomuch.\"So basically, the alien was only giving engineering advice and science advice.For example, I performed the calculations but needed more help. I spoke of abook that - well it's not a book; it's a big assembly with various divisions dealingwith gravitational technology, and the key elements are in there, but all theinformation wasn't there. Even our top mathematicians couldn't figure some ofthis stuff out, so the alien would assist.\"Sometimes you'd get into a spot where you [would] try and try and try, and itwouldn't work. And that's when he'd [the alien] come in. They would tell him tolook at this and see what we did wrong."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Over the last 40 years or so, not counting the simulators - I'm talking aboutactual craft - there are probably two or three-dozen, and various sizes that webuilt.\"I don't know much about the [ET] ones that they brought here. I know aboutthat one [craft] out of Kingman but that's about it. And, I know the companythat hauled it out of there - who is out here now - but But, there's one thatoperates with certain chemicals.\"I think these triangles that people are seeing are two or three 30-meter craft,that are in the center of it [the triangle]. And, the outside perimeter - well youcould put anything you want, as long as these particular ones meet the designcriteria, and they'll operate.\"You know, there were certain reasons for the secrecy. I could understand that;it was no different than the first atomic bomb that they built. But they aregetting so far ahead now with aircraft design. And, like I told you gentlemenearlier - that by 2003, most of this stuff will be out for everybody to look at.Maybe not the way that everybody expects it, but in some manner theydetermine appropriate to show everybody. You know, a big surprise.\"The reason why I said that is because the document I signed ends in 2003 andI'm not the only one who signed those. But, that gravitational manual - if youever get one of these volumes of documents, you'd be on top of the world. You'dknow everything.\"Background From Dan Burisch, Ph.D.:Dr. Dan C.
