Twenty-sevenyears later, in 2001 to 2002, Pondera County and surrounding region experienced morethan adozen animal mutilations associated with unidentified lights and other high strangeness.See Earthfiles 08/18/01. ere livestock mutilations in other states following the same pattern as thosein Montana? Had law officers in these states come up with any substantialevidence that might be helpful in solving the mutilations in Montana? These were some of the questions Captain Wolverton considered when hestarted contacting law enforcement agencies in other states where mutilationshad taken place. The replies were interesting, but did not solve the riddle. Somereports indicated a similarity in incidents while others introduced entirely newbits of information to add new and baffling parts to the puzzle. The reports of two mutilations in Meeker County, Minnesota, were particularlyinteresting. One involved a cow and the other a pig. The cow was mutilated withblood removal similar to those in Montana. The interesting aspect was that lawofficers arrived on the scene shortly after the cow was mutilated and althoughthere was about a half inch of snow on the ground, the area in a six-foot radiusimmediately around the cow was melted off. Officers were unable to find anyfootprints or car tracks. The pig mutilation also had a strange aspect. The farmer who owned the pig toldauthorities that his yard light had gone out and he had assumed that it had"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"burned out. About 20 minutes later, the yard light went back on. He wentoutside the next morning and found the mutilated pig in the barnyard. It wasmutilated in a manner similar to most incidents involving cattle. The officer who reported to Captain Wolverton said there had been 12mutilations south of his county toward St. Paul. It was noted that birds andpredators did not feed on mutilated animal carcasses. Until the pig mutilation,all information the Cascade County Sheriff's Department accumulated involvedcattle. However, shortly thereafter, in mid-August, a report was received thatnine sheep had possibly been mutilated near Red Lodge, Montana. The left earhad been cut off seven of the sheep. Two of them died, but the remaining lived. Interesting information concerning mutilations in Colorado was published by theColorado press. While investigating a cattle mutilation, a Sheriff in that statefound an Army bag containing a scalpel, surgical gloves, and a bovine penis atthe scene. It is possible that these specimens were purposely left at themutilation site. The Sheriff at Sioux Falls, South Dakota, shared a number of reports onmutilations occurring in late 1974, after the first incidents reported in north-central Montana, but before the major rash of mutilations. An incident in lateSeptember 1974, regarding a Black Angus heifer was similar in several ways tothe mutilations that later occurred in Montana. The heifer's tongue andreproductive organs were removed and the excision was completed in an almostperfect circle with no jagged edges. It looked as though a precision instrumentof some description was used. The right ear was removed in an unusual method. The report stated that the earwas not sliced off at the skull's surface, but the entire ear was excised from theskull. As in most Montana cases, no blood was on the ground by the animal oron the skull and no tracks were found around the animal. A tuft of hair,presumably the animal's, was found about two feet from the rear of the animal. Itwas in ball shape and approximately tennis ball size. Lawmen there contacted the Sheriff of another county in Minnesota whoreported two mutilations similar in appearance, except that these weremutilations of male animals instead of female. Another mutilation near Sioux Falls involved a one or two day old calf that hadall internal organs removed. All that remained of the calf were the backbone,hide, rib cage, head and legs. The tongue, the left ear, part of the nose, and thebull calf's testicles were removed. There was a hole about one-half inch indiameter wherein the hide of the left shoulder of the calf was removed.Investigating officers found no evidence of the internal organs being draggedalong the ground as would be the result if a predator had taken the organs. Apparently the absence of tracks puzzled the South Dakota officers, too, whoreported that in one investigation the mutilated heifer was found in the middle ofa soybean field which had been harvested. The ground was very soft, but notracks were found. A man in Texas who has apparently been assembling data to help law officers intheir investigations of cattle mutilations sent Captain Wolverton photostat copiesof reports and news articles collected from a number of states. The man said heworked with the knowledge and approval of his local sheriff and asked thatCaptain Wolverton send him information about mutilations in Montana. Among the information the Texas man submitted was a copy of the posteradvertising a $2,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and convictionof those doing the mutilations. The reward was offered by the WisconsinLivestock Protective Association, organized in 1970, and which has over 250members. He also submitted copies of news stories telling of the mutilation of acow in Kansas, the organization of a farmer-vigilante group in Nebraska and a$500 reward offered by the American Human Association in Denver, Colorado."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" A news broadcast over a Salt Lake City television station in the fall of 1975stated that there had been 1,600 mutilations in 28 states. Whether this figure isaccurate or not is not known, but newspaper stories have reported cattlemutilations in a number of states including Texas, Oklahoma, Washington,Oregon, Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Kansas, Colorado, Nevada, Utah,Wyoming and Idaho, as well as Montana. In addition to checking with law enforcement personnel in other states, CaptainWolverton contacted a man in Nebraska who is a doctor of pharmacology and abiochemist to get further information on the effects of certain drugs on livestock.The man verified that Ketaset is an anesthetic or tranquilizer. He said Ketasetwas the name used when the drug was still in the experimental stage. The man voiced the opinion that the two holes found in the jugular vein onmany mutilated animals could have possibly been used to inject a salt solutionthrough the one hole while pumping out the blood through the other. He addedthat the salt solution could not be detected after the animal was dead any lengthof time. Meanwhile, reports of mutilations continued to come in to the Cascade CountySheriff's Office. One report stated a calf was found dead in a remote area of theHighwood Mountains. The calf was missing both ears, its male organs, tail,rectum and tongue. Captain Wolverton cut its throat and found no blood in it oron the ground around it. There was no blood in this mutilated calf when the investigating officer,Keith Wolverton, slit its throat. Nor was there any blood on the ground around it.However, it was missing both ears, its male organs, tail, rectal, area and tongue.Photograph © 1975 Cascade County Sheriff's Office. On the ground directly in front of the calf was a white substance forming an Xmeasuring 10 by 17 inches and topped with a bar. Officers wondered if it couldbe some sort of a symbol, so they sent some of the substance to a Missoulalaboratory for analysis. Disappointingly, the substance turned out to be birddroppings. Directly in front of the mutilated calf, officers found a large (faint)X formed by some white substance. Thinking it could be a symbol, they sent asample of the white substance to a laboratory for analysis, but it turned out to be birddroppings.Photograph © 1975 Cascade County Sheriff's Office. Judith Basin County Undersheriff Jerry Skelton investigated the mutilation of a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"bull calf in which a hole had been drilled in the back of its head and the brainsremoved. In some cases, the cause of death was definitely not attributed tomutilation. For example, a cow and calf found near Simms. A veterinarian didautopsies on both animals and said the cow died of emphysema and the calfexpired due to intestinal blockage. The mutilation of a cow south of Stockett followed what seemed to be the usualpattern - rectal area, tail and one ear removed - but there was one difference. Awhite, filmy substance, similar to that discovered earlier on a mutilated calf nearUtica, was found on the hair of the cow's neck. It was sent to a laboratory foranalysis, along with samples of the soil around the animal at two feet, nine feetand twenty feet. Although extensive tests have been made at the lab, the whitesubstance has not been identified. Scientists did confirm that it is not petroleumdistillate, as in the other case. A mutilation with a different twist was investigated by officers February 20,1976. The cow, found northwest of Cascade, was dead an estimated one to twoweeks. Two circular patches of hide from the belly, one teat and one ear weremissing. Apparently the carcass had not appealed to birds of prey, as there wereno droppings or other evidence that birds had eaten on it. In examining the carcass, Captain Wolverton cut open the throat, revealing noblood, but he found an extremely foul-smelling, milky fluid which ran from theopening. Some of it was sent to a laboratory for testing, but the tests did notdetermine what the fluid was. However, a veterinarian later said it was possiblyputrefaction of tissue. As in most cases, there were no tracks around the deadcow. One of the greatest dangers in any investigation of strange or frighteningcircumstances is the panic it can cause when people hear about it. Such wasalmost the case at a rural high school in Cascade County one day in October1975. A rumor was going around the school that humans were to be mutilatednext and that on that particular night some residents of the area were to bemutilated. The Cascade County Sheriff's Office was notified. A special assembly was calledat the school and Captain Wolverton and Deputy Arne Sand drove to the schoolto speak to the students. They explained that there was no validity to the rumor.The deputies found out in questioning the students later that the rumor wasstarted by some students as a joke. The officers did not consider it funny, as theyknew what fear and panic can do to normally stable citizens.
