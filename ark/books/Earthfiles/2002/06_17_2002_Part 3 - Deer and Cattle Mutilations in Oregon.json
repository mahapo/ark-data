It's also where fourteen dead calves and a pig with its legscut off were found in March 1999. The circled X marks the area where eyewitness DwainWright saw mutilated bull and where a cowboy described having seen glowing discsthat lifted cattle up in glowing beams and dropped them back downthrough the trees in late 1970s to early 1980s. Christmas Valley Cattle Mutilations:June 17, 2002 Christmas Valley, Oregon - Jean Bilodeaux is a freelance fieldinvestigator and writer from Cedarville, California. She has been to severalmutilation sites in northern California and Oregon and in this report discussesher observations of the Christmas Valley bull that she examined with LakeCounty, Oregon Deputy Sheriff, Keith Bumpass, and a long-horn mutilation thatthe rancher said he found in early spring 2002, yet the animal is still wellpreserved without predation, its head propped up off the ground by one of itslong horns.Interview:Jean Bilodeaux, Freelance Field Investigator and Writer, Cedarville,California: \"The ground around the bull in the original site was still extremelypounded by the other animals' feet where there was no vegetation at all, justsoft, sandy ground around it. The bull where he left it laying showed the eyebeing cut. We couldn't see in the mouth to the tongue, but the rectum had beencored out and that was still visible. The rest of the animal's skin had dried anddesiccated. The bull's body seemed very collapsed for an animal that hadweighed 2400 pounds only five weeks before."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Mutilated Bull Discovered May 5, 2002Bull originally weighed 2400 pounds and after five weeks had collapsedon skeleton that was in abnormal deteriorated condition. For more aboutthe bull discovered May 5, 2002, see Earthfiles 05/18/02.Photograph © 2002 by Jean Bilodeaux. Mutilated Cow Discovered May 18, 2002Then we went to this rancher's cow mutilated approximately the same time, orwithin a couple of weeks. We examined that. (See 06/16/02 Part 2.)This is the one six miles from the site where the bull was found mutilatedon May 5?That's right. Again, the predators had not chewed on this animal at all andneither had they on the bull. This is in an area where the deputies and localshave all seen unidentified lights in the sky. Not very high in the sky, but lowenough to stop their cars and jump out and listen and look and not hearing anysound and observing erratic behavior from these objects. Comparison to Cow Death of Natural Causes Around Memorial Day WeekendWe then went to the rancher's home place and went to and looked at a cow thathad died of natural causes about two weeks earlier. This animal had beenchewed up by the coyotes pretty well and decimated. Pieces were dragged offinto the brush and everything. Mutilated Cow Found in December 2001Then we went off about a mile further down the road and the rancher took us tothe site of another cow that had been mutilated. The predators had not touchedthis animal. Again, the deputy and I began to realize something. This latest onewe were viewing had been mutilated in December of 2001. We realized that notonly had the cow that had died of natural causes two weeks earlier, but this cowthat had died of mutilation, both had their rib cages intact. The weather there isdry, even in the winter the humidity runs probably as high as 10%. So theanimals don't necessarily rot. They just dry out and desiccate and the connectivetissues on these animals just keeps the animal rigid and in the basic cow shape. Mutilated Long-Horn Cow Found in Spring 2002We then went out to a site that the deputy suspected was a mutilation afterhaving discussed it with me. We looked and this animal was a long-hornedspeckled type animal that had been mutilated some time in the spring of 2002. It"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"had the classic eye removed very precisely and the flesh was removed aroundthe jaw. And again no predators. This is a very harsh climate. Everything ishungry, especially by spring because there is not much food so anything that isedible will be eaten there. There's eagles, there's hawks, coyotes, lots ofmountain lions and everything like that. So everything dead is fair game to berecycled almost immediately.Carcass of mutilated long-horn cow has laid on the Christmas Valley ranch sinceearly spring 2002 without predators tearing the bones apart or damaging the head or legs.Eye removed and hide on jaw flesh cut away in precise oval pattern.Photographs © 2002 by Jean Bilodeaux.Oval of hide neatly removed from right side of jaw and right eye removed.Unusual to find a mutilated animal face down on side with excisions. More typically,mutilated animals are found with the cut side facing upward.Photographs © 2002 by Jean Bilodeaux.You found what appeared to be a mutilation from months ago that was stillintact without predation?Yes, that's true. There were some maggots working the animal and on all the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"animals, but the older they were, there wasn't much maggots. Still, coyoteswould have chewed the legs off, they would have chewed the ears off anddragged the legs off in the brush. They weren't, nothing had happened to them.We noted again that the long-horn's rib cage was intact. The flesh, theconnective tissue, had just desiccated and become hard. But the bull didn'tappear to have a rib cage. So we decided we would go back to the bull site.Ants Found Dead At Site Where Bull First Found Dead With Eye Removed onMay 5, 2002We also stopped at the original spot where the bull had been found. (The ownerdragged the bull 200 yards away from the water trough to avoid any potentialcontamination from the mutilated bull.) There are ant hills in the area. Therehad been an ant hill where this bull was originally put down. Now, there wereno ants. All the ants were dead on this ant hill. However, in the vicinity about20 feet away, the ants were still working on the ground. So, I don't know if thatconnects to what happened to the bull or not.Was there a pattern of distribution in the dead ants on the ground?No, I couldn't tell. Again, the ground had been trampled by the other cattle.They are still concerned. The other cows seemed to be concerned abouteverything. But the ant hill was no longer active.The deputy went to the bull again to check on the ribs. We couldn't, the bullwas still fairly big. We couldn't roll the bull. So, we took a hammer and shoveland started pounding on it trying to break the skin, but the hide had dried out somuch it was solid. But this bull that should have been very thick with a rib cagewas only about a foot high and it sounded hollow in there. So we were verypuzzled. Rib Bones Fall Out of Bull's Carcass, Sponge-like and BlackenedWe called the rancher and he came with a chain and we dragged the bull andimmediately when we pulled it loose, all of the bones fell out of the bull. thiswas quite puzzling because all of the other animals, the natural deaths and themutilation deaths of the animals always had the ribs intact. When we pulled it,immediately a big pile of ribs just lay there at the original site. These ribs hadnever been exposed to the air and for some unexplained reason, those rib boneshad already become disconnected from the bull before we even pulled on it.That would explain the bull's small chest width. It was collapsed becausethere were no ribs holding up the hide.Yes. That's right. That explained that. But when we pulled it, the rancher wasflabbergasted and the deputy and I were surprised that if there was anyconnective tissue in this animal and about the only we could see was on thespine it was black. The bones were hollow. They were like black sponges, onlysolid. Not soft like a sponge, but looking like a very porous sponge and blackcolored."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Bull's rib bones were filled with holes like a sponge and darkened, some almost black.Compare to more normal rib cage in carcass of mutilated long-horn cow above.Photograph © 2002 by Jean Bilodeaux.Jean Bilodeaux's gloved hand holding rib cut straight off and blackenedlike the surrounding bones from the bull that was found dead and mutilatedon May 5, 2002. Photograph © 2002 by Deputy Keith Bumpass,Lake County, Oregon Sheriff's Office.Your photograph shows both bones that appear to have been cut and onesthat are sponge-like and darkened.Ye s .Could something like microwave radiation that heats and cooks causethat?This would be a good thing to try to find out. The rancher said that when heburns bones, that's what they look like. They become extremely porous.The fact that it was only a half inch on the sternum part, there was a little bit ofcartilage left and it held the ribs to the sternum, a half inch up the ribs appearedto be cut straight off. This could possibly be attributed to the rancher jerked thebull too hard when he pulled it. Or maybe he rolled it, but he swears he didn'troll it. But the fact that the ribs were cut on both sides of the sternum wouldindicate to me that it was not just a chance breaking.How do you cut the ribs straight across inside a large bull in the firstplace?Yes, especially if the parts that would make the bull accessible is solid. There isno break in the skin there. So, you couldn't have cut the ribs because they wereinside the bull. The cowhide, bull hide, on the downward side of the animal hadkind of rotted away. But yet, nobody had moved that bull and he had ribs whenthe rancher dragged him to that spot. So whatever, it would be interesting to findout."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The bull bloated right at the beginning and had rigor mortis set in when it as toosoon. And the bull had never been moved, so how did those ribs get cut? Andwhen did they get cut?This animal could not have had naturally that porous a bone. It was a 2400pound bull. It could not have supported that weight with this porosity in thebone structure.This might be consistent with biophysicist Levengood's hypothesis thatsome kind of energy system containing microwave frequencies isinteracting with the animals, grass and soil.The connective tissue was black, all of it, not just on the spine. And usuallythat's kind of pink or a lighter color or even a reddish or white. This was allblack inside. The inside of the hide was slick, real clean, shiny. I don't knowwhat caused that.Meaning if you lifted up the hide, on the underside it was shiny?Ye s .Again, could that be caused by microwave heating?I don't know. It might have been maggots, but would they clean it that slick? Iknow the weather had been cold and snowy up to a week or so before I gotthere. At a certain temperature, you need a certain temperature for the maggotsto grow. It was warmish that day we were there, but not too warm. Wouldmaggots have had that much time to do that work?Besides these mutilated animals, have you heard about any new highstrangeness in Christmas Valley or Sand Springs the past few months?People do encounter strange lights in that whole area, and especially in theChristmas Valley where you have not only that huge radar site, but also thatdioxin dump.Can you explain more about the radar site - who runs it and what is itspurpose?It was built in either the late 1970s or early 1980s. Supposedly it was used foronly a few months before it was closed down. A terrible expense for somethingso short-lived. These are huge over-the-horizon back scatter stations. Thesending station is located near Tule Lake in Modoc County, California and itconsists of 3 big arrays and I believe it covers almost 360 degrees. These arraysare charged grids of wire that are maybe 45 feet in height and a quarter mile longand stretching along the ground 1000 feet out. You don't dare go near themwhen they are being used or tested. They say they are decommissioned, but theone at Tule Lake was using more electricity than a town of 3000 people. so, thatwould indicate to me it wasn't quite as decommissioned as they would like us tobelieve.Tule Lake does the sending and Christmas Valley does the receiving at thesehuge radar waves. Then the waves are downloaded and sent to Mountain Homein Idaho.Originally, it was stated they could track incoming missiles and according toKeith, the only thing they did was track a plane taking off from Japan and flyingto Hawaii. It had that ability to see over the horizon.Today it is not supposed to be in operation?Right, it's not supposed to be functioning today, but everyone I've talked to upthere at Christmas Valley, people have seen strange lights. Whether it's becauseof the radar station, I do not know.Christmas Valley and Sand Springs have had animal mutilations and"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"unusual phenomena for decades.Oh, yeah.
