The place was GreatFalls, Montana and nearby Malmstrom AFB with all its Minutemen nuclearmissiles waiting to launch during the Cold War with the Soviet Union. DeputyWolverton's collection of physical evidence and eyewitness testimonies indicatedthat the mutilators were not natural predators, disease or satanic cults. During my own animal mutilation research in the 1980s, I talked with DeputyWolverton about the odd serrated edge he had discovered and photographed inthe Montana cases and which was found in many other mutilations ranging fromOregon to Alabama. What was the cutting instrument? Did it cauterize as itmade its pinking shearer excision? Who - or what - was killing and mutilating animals around the world - and why?Keith Wolverton's 1976 book, written with Roberta Donovan, has long been outof print. But now with their permission, Earthfiles.com has produced anelectronic version of the original book.

In Appreciation We are deeply grateful to the people who assisted in various ways with theinvestigations and thus, helped to make this book possible. A special tribute goes to those individuals who reported to law officers thestrange incidents they witnessed. Without the cooperation of these conscientiouscitizens, there would have been no investigation. We sincerely appreciate the contributions by physicians, veterinarians,pathologists, toxicologists and others who shared their professional knowledgeand skill. Our thanks to the news media for the fine cooperation that made the task ofinvestigation easier. Most of all, we appreciate and want to thank those membersof the Cascade County Sheriff's Department who shared and are still sharing theburden of investigation. They are Undersheriff Glenn Osborne, Deputies KenAnderson, Arne Sand, Shirley Peterson and Clerk Elaine Anderson. R.D. and K.W. Roberta Donovan and Keith Wolverton, Co-Authors, 1976. About The Authors Mystery Stalks the Prairie was written by two Montanans, Mrs. RobertaDonovan of Lewistown and Captain Keith Wolverton of Great Falls, a deputysheriff for Cascade County. Roberta Donovan, a former newspaper reporter and editor, wrote this book andCaptain Wolverton, an experienced lawman and the officer in charge ofinvestigating reports of cattle mutilations, UFOs and hairy creatures, providedthe information and technical advice. This was the second book for Mrs. Donovan. Her fictionalized account of herfather's boyhood in Montana's early days, Ike - Boy of the Breaks, waspublished in November 1975 by T.H.A.R. Institute of Raynesford, Montana. Mrs. Donovan served for twelve years as editor of the Lewistown News-Argus,Montana. She continued to do freelance writing for a number of publications,including some of national scope, and was a correspondent for the BillingsGazette, Montana. Mrs. Donovan was a member and past president of Montana Press Women and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"in 1968 was named that organization's Montana Press Woman of the Year. Shewon more than 100 state and national awards for her writing. She is the motherof six grown children and seven grandchildren. Captain Keith Wolverton, a native of Great Falls, was a member of the CascadeCounty Sheriff's Office from 1965 until 1990 when he retired after 25 years inlaw enforcement. He was one of two men responsible for establishing theCascade County K-9 Academy where lawmen and their dogs are trained in aunique school. It was the only resident K-9 training academy in the UnitedStates. Captain Wolverton taught at the academy until 1975 when he wastransferred to duty with the sheriff's office in Great Falls. The events in this book represent countless hours of research and investigationon the part of Captain Wolverton and his fellow officers. Over the years, CaptainWolverton attended a number of seminars and special schools to continue hisspecialized training as a law enforcement officer. In 1972, the Great Falls Exchange Club selected Captain Wolverton as theirLaw Officer of the Year from all of the Great Falls, Cascade County andMalmstrom Air Force Base lawmen, as well as area members of the MontanaHighway Patrol. Captain Wolverton was active in the Cascade County Sheriff'sPosse which his father helped establish and has assisted in a number of rescues.He particularly enjoyed participation in that organization because it was horsemounted. Captain Wolverton was married and had two daughters and a son. Members of the Cascade County Sheriff's Department team look oversome of the information they have assembled in their investigations of cattlemutilations, sightings of unidentified flying objects and the appearance of strange bipedcreatures.Left to right, they are Deputy Ken Anderson, Undersheriff Glenn Osborne at map, ClerkElaineAnderson, Deputy Arne Sand and Captain Keith Wolverton.

Even though technological advances that boggle the mind with their intricacyare routine tools of scientists and a wealth of knowledge that includes theknow-how to put an astronaut on the moon is at man's command; still, man isfaced with some mysteries that defy solution. Among these mysteries are the many cattle mutilations reported recently innorth-central Montana. Investigating law officers are baffled by bizarre caseswhich seem to have no logical explanation. Diligent and intensive research byofficers, assisted by pathologists, veterinarians, toxicologists and others, hasfailed to unravel the mystery. Facts have been established, but the important questions ... who is doing thisand why? ...have not been answered. Some persons say the mutilations are caused by predators. This is occasionallytrue. However, it becomes difficult to blame a coyote or magpie predator whenan investigator finds an exact round patch of hide has been neatly removed by asharp instrument, or all of the blood has been removed from the animal, or the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"area around the animal appears burned, or all these incidents have occurred. The puzzle becomes more obscure when, in most instances, no tracks - animal,human, or vehicle - are found. In other cases, investigators have found horsetracks in the mutilation area, but the landowner swore no horses had been therefor many years. This book relates some of these strange incidents, but it does not attempt todraw a conclusion. The events are factual, based on reports on file in the officeof the Cascade County (Montana) Sheriff's office. These reports are used withpermission. Other mysterious events which may or may not be related to the cattlemutilations are also reported here. These events include numerous reportedsightings of unidentified flying objects (UFOs), unidentified helicopters andstrange hairy, man-like creatures. Incidents reported here occurred between August 1974 and May 1976 in afive-county area of Montana which has had an appreciably large number ofcattle mutilations. Several stories and books are being written about cattle mutilations, UFOs andhairy creatures. Some may be true. But there are others that investigation hasproven to be false. Some writings are dramatized and sensationalized, perhaps tostimulate greater readership. This is not our intention. As co-authors of Mystery Stalks the Prairie, we havebeen factual within the confines of our knowledge. And where there was achoice, we have chosen to underplay the situation, as there is no desire to createfear or panic. We had two purposes in writing this book. One is to let the American peopleknow what is happening. We believe, but cannot prove, there are those whoknow what is behind these bizarre happenings, but for various reasons they arekeeping silent. Others appear to ignore the situation, but it may be that they havenot had access to certain facts, such as those uncovered by the Cascade CountySheriff's Department. We believe the people have a right to know. Our second reason for writing this book is there may be a chance, however slim,that this information may help solve the mystery and may bring new evidence tolight. Mystery Stalks the Prairie may also aid public officials to have a betterunderstanding of what they are facing. Except for those who are presently serving as law enforcement officers, allnames of individuals have been omitted to protect them from implication in anyway. But the incidents are true - or as true as it is humanly possible to tell them. - Roberta Donovan and Keith Wolverton Table of Contents Chapter 1 A C ut wi th A Serra ted Edge 1 Chapter 2 Case of the Missing Calf 9 Chapter 3 Appeal Made of Public's Help 18 Chapter 4 Montana Is Not Alone 26 Chapter 5 The Montana Site 33 Chapter 6 Law Officers Go On Merry Chase 42 Chapter 7 Chasing Lights in the Sky 53"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Chapter 8 Teenage Girls Chased by UFO 60 Chapter 9 Egg-shaped Craft with Arms 68 Chapter 10 One Big One, Four Little Ones 77 Chapter 11 Hairy Creature, Eight Feet Tall 87 Chapter 12 False Story Fools Public 95 Chapter 13 UFO Reported in 1897 101 Chapter 1A C ut with a Serra ted Edge The close-up on the serrated edge (top photo) was found on the mutilated cowpictured above. The report of an animal pathologist ruled out any possibility of the cutbeing done by a predator. Lawmen have not been able to determine what type ofinstrumentmay have been used to make the cut. All mutilation photographs by Cascade CountySheriff's Office. ho?hy? From the beginning, these have been the two questions lawmen in a five-countyarea of north central Montana have asked as they investigated one cattlemutilation after another. Despite their best efforts, they have not yet found theanswer. Each baffling bit of evidence is scrutinized as they persist in their effortsto solve the mysteries and put an end to the bizarre incidents. One of the most startling clues might have gone undetected if it had not been forthe law officers' meticulous examination of the dead cow's carcass. The CascadeCounty Sheriff's Department had been called the afternoon of September 22,1975, to investigate the death of two cows on a ranch near Belt, southeast ofGreat Falls. A veterinarian, who had seen the cows earlier, suspected mutilationand had advised the rancher to call the sheriff. Initial examination of the first cow showed lawmen that the cow had obviouslybeen mutilated. Dead about two days, the cow's bag, teats, rectal area and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"reproductive organs were removed, thus making it possible to look completelythrough the bag area and out the rectal opening. What made this investigation different from those that had preceded it was thestrange way the hide had been cut in removing the bag. One of the deputies, inlifting some of the remaining hide, discovered that the cut, obviously made witha very sharp instrument, had serrated edges similar to those created with pinkingshears. This was the first time the officers had encountered this type of cut. Captain Keith Wolverton, Cascade County Sheriff's Deputy, who had beenworking on mutilation cases for several months, decided to seek an expertopinion on the cut edge. A sample of the serrated hide was taken to a Montanamedical pathologist, who confirmed the cut was made with a very sharpinstrument. Captain Wolverton then took a sample to a well known veterinarianpathologist in Colorado and received the following report: Veterinarian Pathologist Report: \"This strip of skin had a long, straight cut edge with regular serrations(approximately 3/16 of an inch in width). Hair in one area had knowingly beenclipped, but in untouched areas the hair had been cut at the laceration edge.Changes on the skin edge resembled neither tooth marks of a predator, nor thoseof wire lacerations. The changes were similar to those that could be made by aknife except the regular striations.\" The pathologist's reports were of primary importance to the small team of lawofficers investigating such incidents because the reports directly challenged thetheory frequently advanced by some people who said mutilations did not occur,but the severance of tissue from carcasses was the work of predators. Coyotes may feast upon a carcass, but they do not leave a neatly serrated edgewhere they gnaw away the hide! Colored photographs of the carcass, taken byDeputy Ken Anderson, provide additional evidence that the hide cut had aprecise serrated edge. The serrated cut discovery was considered a major breakthrough in a sometimesfrustrating and often perplexing investigation. Reports of possible cattlemutilations had been received in the Cascade County Sheriff's Office sinceAugust, 1974, but the number of such incidents began to markedly increaseduring the late summer and early fall of the following year. Although somemutilations were attributed to predators, it was obvious in other cases somethingelse had occurred. But what? Another clue to the mystery was added when a section of this cut area on the jawwas examined at a laboratory. It showed that the cut not only had a serrated edge,but that it had also definitely been burned. Each report was extensively investigated and bits of evidence were assembled,studied, analyzed. It was obvious that the cattle were dead. However, in manyinstances it was equally discernible that the cattle were mutilated. The questionof who or what is causing mutilations continues unanswered today. Many theories have been advanced. Some of them are proclaimed by concernedand reliable citizens who believe a wide spectrum of possibilities from Satancults to flying saucers. However, these associations have not been proven. Afteralmost a year of intensive investigation, Captain Wolverton remarked, \"I'm no"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"longer as eager to find out who is doing it as I am to discover why!\" Like working on a giant jigsaw puzzle, law officers have pieced together bits andscraps of information, but they are not always certain that they have aconnection with the complete picture. The officers always thoroughly investigatethe entire episode. An important puzzle segment was found just 24 days after the serrated cut wasdiscovered. On October 16, 1975, the sheriff's department was called toinvestigate the death of another cow in the Belt area. The perplexity of thesituation was increased by the fact the dead cow was found in a securely lockedpasture and there were no visible tracks in the area. The absence of tracks has consistently been one of the most baffling aspects ofthe cattle mutilations in Montana. The few tracks that have been found aroundmutilations were those of other cattle. The absence of tracks is unusual becausethe ground around the dead cows was often soft, muddy or covered with snow. Examination of this cow showed that its left jaw had been skinned, its tongueexcised and the right eye removed, not from the socket, but through the bonedirectly above the eye. A significant discovery was made by the veterinarian who removed certainorgans and other parts of the carcass for a toxicology examination. In skinningthe animal, the veterinarian found what appeared to be a needle mark on theupper left leg. The mark went through the hide and into the flesh. Did thisindicate that the animal was injected with a drug to either anesthetize or kill itbefore the mutilation took place? In skinning a mutilated cow, a veterinarian discovered what appearedto be a needle puncture wound in the upper left leg. The photo shows the wound(arrow) after the area around it was removed for analyses. Lawmen pondered whether thewoundmeant the cow had been injected with a drug to either anesthetize or kill it beforemutilation.The tissue around the mark was removed for examination, along with the heart,liver, lungs, skeletal tissue, and bladder. In addition, the cuts around the headand eye were removed for analyses. No drug was positively identified inanalyses, but laboratory examination identified another unique clue. Cut areason the jaw and around the eye not only had a serrated edge, but were burned. Immediately after the first discovery of a serrated cut, officers tried to duplicatethe cuts with various instruments, including a pizza cutter, leather stitcher andpinking scissors. The results were similar, but not identical. Perhaps, the lawmenjested, whoever or whatever was doing the mutilations had a giant cookie cutterthat made the serrated cuts! After discovery of the burned and serrated cut, officers learned from a visitor totheir office, who had had experience with laser beams, that this type of edgecould be produced in metal using lasers. As yet it has not been possible to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"determine if serration can be produced on cowhide with laser. Another mystifying bit of evidence surfaced when Undersheriff Jerry Skelton ofJudith Basin County investigated a calf mutilation near Utica. UndersheriffSkelton was called October 9, 1975, to investigate the death of the bull calf. Itstesticles had been removed, as well as the cords leading to them. The onlyevidence he found at the scene - and it seemed to have no logical explanation -was that several stones, weighing as much as six or seven pounds each, weremoved from a nearby rock pile. The rocks were turned over and moved around. This is bull calf in a photo taken ten days after mutilation first discovered.A white residue stretched from the calf to the ground like a cobweb.The substance proved to be a petroleum distillate.Part of the calf's male sexual organs were removed through this round excision.This mutilation took place in Judith Basin County. Undersheriff Skelton removed some parts of the calf for examination by atoxicologist and left the carcass at the place where he found it. Ten days later, atthe request of the rancher who owned the calf, Undersheriff Skelton returned tothe scene. During the ten days since the first investigation, a snow had fallen inthe area and later melted. The calf was found covered with a filmy whitesubstance that stretched from the carcass to the surrounding ground like acobweb. Laboratory tests identified it as petroleum distillate. No one seems toknow why the calf was shrouded in the substance. But perhaps the most unusual incident investigated so far has involved notcattle, but a Shetland pony. It took place in Teton County northwest of GreatFalls and Pete Howard, the Sheriff, asked the assistance of the Cascade CountySheriff's Office to investigate the possible mutilation."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The five Montana counties of Cascade, Chouteau, Teton, Judith Basin and Ponderahave been the focus of unusual animal deaths that law enforcement has long called\"mutilations\"since the early 1970s to 2002, a span of more than thirty years without a single arrestand arraignment on an animal mutilation charge. See Earthfiles 08/18/01. Captain Keith Wolverton and Deputy Arne Sand responded. The CascadeCounty officers and Sheriff Howard were joined by a veterinarian and twolivestock inspectors. They found the Shetland stud lying on its left side. All ofits male organs had been removed and it was evident a very sharp instrument hadbeen used in the tissue removal. When the veterinarian, in the course of his examination, opened the horse'sthroat, he discovered two puncture wounds with corresponding bruises. Themost surprising development came when the veterinarian cut open the horse'sbody and found that it contained no blood, except for a minute amount whichhe collected in two small vials. Since the horse had weighed about 600 pounds, the veterinarian estimated thehorse should have about 60 pounds (or 60 pints) of blood. He suggested thatremoval of this quantity of blood with hand-operated equipment would requirea minimum of 90 minutes. A battery-operated pump devise would have reducedthe time to approximately 15 minutes. In subsequent cattle investigations wherein all of the blood was removed, ananimal pathologist stated that it is usually impossible to remove all of the bloodbecause when a third of the blood is removed, the veins collapse. However, it could be done, he stated, by injecting a saline solution into the heart(while the animal is alive) to increase the heart action and pump the bloodfaster. He added that it is next to impossible to detect the saline solution duringautopsy. The Shetland pony was seen by its owner's neighbor about three or four daysbefore its carcass was found. The neighbor told officers he saw the small horselying on the bank above an irrigation ditch and thought it looked sick or dead,so he yelled at it. When it raised its head, the neighbor assumed it was all rightand went on. Later the same evening he saw the horse lying on the pasture sideof the irrigation dike where its carcass was found, but the neighbor was busyirrigating and he did not stop to investigate. The veterinarian was unable to determine the cause of the animal's death.Puncture throat wounds suggested the injection of drugs or another substance totranquilize or kill the Shetland pony. Through investigation, it was established that the Shetland pony was mutilatedduring daylight hours and yet no one saw it happen or even saw anythingunusual in the area. To determine the exact time of mutilations has not beenpossible, but it is believed most of them occur at night. Even though manymutilations are reported in Montana, not one person has ever reported seeingone take place. One of the few mutilation cases investigated so far that"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"has not involved cattle is this Shetland pony which was killed in Teton county.All of its male organs had been removed with a sharp instrument and the carcasswas completely void of blood. A pathologist stated that it is impossible to remove allof the blood because by the time a third of it is removed, the veins collapse.Close examination of the Shetland pony by a veterinariandisclosed two puncture wounds in the throat. Similar puncture markswere found later in the jugular veins of other mutilated animals and ineach instance, the two wounds were the same distance apart.
