Now in 2002,five domestic cats in Bellingham since September 2001 have been found slitfrom throat to pelvis and internal organs removed, all without blood.May 31, 2002 Bellingham, Washington - In the week between Thursday, May16 and Thursday, May 23, 2002, four domestic cats were found in the Fairhavendistrict of Bellingham slit from the throat to the pelvis. But there was no bloodon the fur or the ground. Bellingham Police Lt. Dac Jamison said, \"There ismethodology to what's going on.\" The speculation is that the cats are some howremoved from their home or neighborhood, taken somewhere for the cut andexcision of internal organs, and returned close to their homes. At the same time in Austin, Texas, the number of mutilated cats since March2001 climbed to 25 when residents near the 7900 block of Stone Cliff foundone dead cat on May 12 and another on May 16. The Austin Police Departmenthas taken over the investigation and are only saying the cats were cut in a\"meticulous and precise way. No blood.\" Other recent unusual cat deaths havealso surfaced in San Diego. This week I asked the head of the Whatcom Humane Society in Bellingham ifshe knew about previous cat mutilations in 1993 north of her in Vancouver (SeeMore Information below) or the current rounds of other cat mutilations inAustin and San Diego. She had no knowledge of the other cases, but explainedto me some of the details about what has happened in the Bellingham cases. Interview:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Penny Cistaro, Executive Director, Whatcom Humane Society, Bellingham,Washington: \"One was found on a porch; the other three were found in abackyard, but not the owner's.Nearby though?A couple blocks from home.Was the one on the porch at its house?No, it wasn't at its house.So, each one was returned nearby, but not at the exact property from whichthe cat was taken?Correct. We also had one in September last year (2001), for a total of five catswith this type of thing done to it.All five had the excision from the throat down to the pelvis, a clean,straight, bloodless cut. Upon examination have all the internal organs beenremoved?Not in all the cases and I don't want to specifically comment on these casesbecause this is still an open investigation.Would it be fair to say that some internal organs have been left?In a couple of cases, yes.Did anybody examine the hair along the cut to see if the hair or tissue hadbeen subjected to high heat that cauterized?The veterinarian has examined it and did not describe that as evidence.If no cautery, the implication is that if it were a normal kill and cut likethat with removal of organs, for the cat to be bloodless, it would have tohave been taken someplace else and cleaned up before being returned?Probably. That's what we are assuming.What is the current local police perspective?They are alarmed. They are investigating it with us. They are in a lot of waystaking the lead on it because we are turning information over to them and tipsthat we may be getting. They are following through on everything for us. We areworking closely to the police, but we turn a lot of information over to themdirectly anyway. They are taking it very seriously. They are concerned about themental state of the person or persons doing this.Do the police in Bellingham have any prior cases of these same kinds of catmutilations in years prior to 2001 to 2002?We, in June 2001, had one cat specifically that we believe it was done by aperson. There was an incision around the base of the cat's tail and it was aperfect circle, done with a very sharp instrument, probably a scalpel or knife ofsome sort. The cat was skinned and the tail was skinned.Then there were similar cats around the same time that had injuries to the rearend, the tail area, that could have been done by a person and veterinarians aresaying the cat could have gotten its tail caught in a garage door, that type ofthing.Then in the summer of 2000, a cat had been cut in half. And there have beencoming to our attention now people who are saying that a couple of months ago,or last summer, they found a cat that had been cut in half or a cat that had beenmutilated without any other information. There is nothing for us to follow up onbecause it wasn't reported when it happened. We don't have any information"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"other than they are reporting what they saw or found.In all the cases of the half cats, was it the front half of the cat thatremained?It was either the front half, or just the head. There have been a couple ofdifferent reports. The cat in the summer of 2000 that was reported cut in half, itwas the top half that they found.Were you aware that in the year 1993, there were many half catmutilations in Vancouver, B. C. north of you?No. I am speechless to realize so much has happened in other places.\" More Information:Since the 1970s, there have been waves of cat mutilations in such widespreadgeographic areas as London, England; Toronto and Vancouver, BritishColumbia, Canada; Bellingham, Washington; Tustin and San Diego, California;Plano and Austin, Texas; Pensacola, Florida; and Falls Church, Virginia.One cycle began in May 1992 in Vancouver, B. C. Typical was the purebredRussian blue cat that was put out in the evening and never came back. The backhalf of the cat was found three blocks from its owner's home without a trace ofblood. It was the fourth cat found cut in half in a two week period. The patternof only half cats persisted, either the back half or front half found at any onelocation. By January 10, 1993, Vic Warren, Supervisor of Animal Control forthe Vancouver City Pound, had opened a file on seven cats found cut in half.\"They're clearly being butchered by someone - it's a real surgical job,\" he said.\"All I hope is that these cats were already dead when they were cut in half.\"In March 1992, John Altshuler, M.D., Pathologist and Hematologist in Denver,Colorado, received one of the Vancouver half-cats for examination andconfirmed that the entire excision had been cut with high heat.Similar reports of cats cut in half were investigated by the Plano, Texas policedepartment in the summer of 1991 and the spring of 1993. Plano is an affluentsuburb north of Dallas. I talked with Plano Police Detective Mike Box. Inaddition to the mutilated cats, he said by August 1991, his station had missingreports on more than eighty domestic house cats with collars and I. D. tags.None of those cats were ever found. In 1993, other animals had disappearedfrom adjoining Creek-Forest neighborhoods. Detective Box and his departmentinvestigated satanic cult activities, but could find no hard evidence thatconnected satanists to the mutilated and missing cats and other animals, such asdogs.Half-cat photographed by Plano, Texas Police Officerfor Incident Report #91-44994, August 31, 1991.Thirteen years before in 1978, authorities in St. Catharines near Toronto,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Canada were also frustrated by more than one hundred missing cats and dogsand others found skinned and badly mutilated.Similarly, by August 1989, sixty-seven cats had been found in Tustin,California. The New York Times reported on August 13, 1989, \"Some of themwere cut in half with what some say is almost surgical precision, othersdisemboweled or skinned.\" Janet Hampson of Tustin summed up the eeriness ofit all: \"There is never any blood at the scene, the animals are often dismemberedwith surgical precision and paws and other body parts are often left on theground in strikingly similar arrangements. No one ever seems to hear anything,nor do dogs bark during the killing.\" She believed the cats are captured, takenelsewhere, their blood drained and organs removed, then replaced on theirowners' lawns.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
