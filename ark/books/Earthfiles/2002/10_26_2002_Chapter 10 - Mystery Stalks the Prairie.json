Although it was the season ofthe year for bright lights, she was in no way prepared for what she saw. As shetopped the hill where the airport is located, she saw a strange craft that waseither on the ground or barely above it. The size of the egg-shaped object, shetold authorities later, was \"as large as a two-story building.\" It had three redlights in a cluster on top, she said, and there were windows in the bottom part. Suddenly the strange object took off from in front of her car. It appeared to flybeside her for a time and then headed down the valley toward the city. She hadwatched it for a total of about ten minutes, giving her a pretty good opportunityto see what it looked like. When she related her strange experience to one of the men in the FederalAviation Administration tower, he admitted that he had seen it, too, but he wasnot going to talk about it! The young woman felt differently. \"I saw it and it was there and I don't carewho believes me!\" she told law officers. Less than an hour later, at 6:45 a.m., another woman who works at the airportalso saw something strange in the sky over the airport. Whether it was the sameobject as the previous woman had seen could not be established. The secondwoman said the craft had two bright white lights on each end and a triangularblinking red light in the middle. It seemed to be hovering a little higher than theairport tower and she estimated it was about three blocks away. After watching the object for about five minutes, she went on into work as itcontinued to hover over the area. Perhaps seeing UFOs was beginning to be \"oldhat\" for her because it was her second sighting that month and both times wereat the airport. On December 11, as she was coming to work about 7 a.m., shesaw a strange object ahead of her and beside the overpass. She said it seemed tobe about ten feet above the ground and was stationary. As she slowed down on approaching it, the UFO took off rapidly toward thewest and soon disappeared. She had observed it for about three minutes.Drawing a sketch to illustrate what she saw, the woman told officers the large,oblong object had red lights on the sides and threw light beams to the ground.She added that it was definitely not a helicopter. Reports of UFO sightings continued to come in and one of the most unusualincidents was that of a Fairfield area rancher who described a \"hotel-size\" UFOthat was accompanied by four smaller ones. The man told authorities that he"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and his family were returning to their home west of Fairfield about 9 p.m. thenight of January 21, 1976, when his two teenage sons noticed an object in afield near their home. Using two pair of seven-power field glasses, the familywatched as four separate craft, identifiable only as lights, seemed to cavortamong a grove of trees about three-quarters of a mile away. The rancher was interviewed by law officers and he related: \"By this time, theselights were coming back and forth out from behind this row of trees. And theyappeared at that time to be landing in the field and so forth. So we watchedthem for quite awhile, probably twenty minutes there with the field glasses on. \"About this time, we saw two red blinkers down on the highway and I said,'Well, somebody has reported it and the sheriff or somebody is out there nowwith a patrol car watching them, so we'll go on down, too.' \"So I took the two boys and jumped in the pickup and as we turned the cornerof our approach onto the main highway, why these red things that we thoughtwere patrol cars, they then floated off the highway over into this field stillblinking, or they were then. So we drove on down there and then as weapproached the field where they had gone, why we saw this structure thatlooked like a hotel - a two story hotel sitting out there in the field and theother lights were grouped around it. About four sets of lights grouped aroundit.\" The rancher said the larger object appeared to be sitting on the ground.Although he could not make out the outline of the smaller objects, he said withthe field glasses he was able to see the outline of the large UFO. He said it was arectangular shape about 300 to 400 feet long and 60 feet in height, with tworows of windows, five to six feet high and two to three feet wide. He added that he did not see anything moving inside the large UFO, but it gavethe impression it had a very brilliantly lighted interior. As he and his boyswatched, the smaller objects came close to the large UFO, hovered about it,changed places and darted away, only to return again. He said they seemed to beaffiliated with it, but he did not actually see any of them enter the large object orany come out of it. Occasionally some of the smaller objects would land in the stubble field. Whenthey did, their light seemed to fade and grow dim and they actually seemed toshrink in size. As they watched, the objects would flare up and become verybright. The rancher compared them with an acetylene torch and said that itwould hurt a person's eyes to look at them very long. At their largest size, thesmaller UFOs appeared to be ten to fifteen feet in diameter. At one point the man and his sons saw what they thought was a helicopter withflashing red lights approaching. \"We said, 'Well, here comes a helicopter to lookat this stuff,' the man told officers. So, it came right over the field and (it was)not a helicopter. And then my boy said, 'That ain't no helicopter. It's justanother one of those, isn't it?' And I said, 'Yes, it is.'\" As they watched, the newest arrival tilted on its side while flying, revealing thatit was flat on one side and round on the other, like a ball cut in half, or half asphere. Slowly and gradually, the \"hotel\" UFO started moving away from theviewers and disappeared over the horizon into the Sun River Valley. The smaller objects stayed in view for perhaps another 45 minutes as the manand his sons watched, and then they, too, disappeared in the same direction asthe larger UFO. The rancher and his boys got back in their pickup and drove father down thehighway where they came upon a group of six small UFOs in a field. Theybelieved this was a different group than the first ones they saw because theothers had gone directly south and these, when they left, went east and south."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"At one point, one of the objects started up the highway toward the pickup truck.\"My youngest boy said, 'Dad, that one's going to come right over us, right on thehighway,'\" the farmer related. \"But it didn't. It veered off and went back out inthe field again.\" He estimated that it came as close as 100 to 200 yards before turning. During allthe rest of the sighting, the closest the man and his sons were able to get to theobjects was about 500 yards. He was asked if the presence of the UFOs affectedhis motor, and he replied, \"Never affected the lights. Never affected the motoror anything like that.\" At one point, he shut off the lights to try to get a betterview of the UFOs. The incident was not the rancher's first experience with UFOs. He told officersthat about fourteen years ago, he saw one in approximately the same location.He said it was large and similar to the \"hotel type\" he had seen this time, but itdid differ in that its windows were round instead of rectangular. He said he didnot tell anyone except his family about it that time. But this time, he said, \"Idon't really care if anyone believes this or not. So I'm going to tell you what Isaw.\" A report of a UFO landing came in from the Simms area February 5, 1976, andfor the first time in their long and frustrating investigation, officers arrived on thescene in time to see the object for themselves. But they were thwarted in theirattempts to get a closer look. Simms, to the west of Great Falls, and all the yellow-colored towns and regionswere affected by whatever was stalking animals so intensely in 1975 to 1976 in Montana. The call came in from a woman who was caring for some neighbor childrenwhile their parents were on a trip. She said she and her own two daughters werereturning home from Simms when they saw a bright light behind the house andup on top of the hill. The woman stopped the car and they watched the light,which was very intense and pulsated when it was moving. It appeared to changecolor from a dull glow to a bright reddish orange. She described the object asabout 300 feet long with rows of continuous lights along the top and bottom.She said the bottom lights pulsated alternately from left to right. One of the girlsshe was caring for, a 16-year-old, saw the glow from a second floor window ofher home. After moving back and forth, the object left in a southwesterlydirection, disappearing behind some buttes. Shortly after officers arrived on the scene, they received a radio message fromSheriff Pete Howard, saying the lights were visible in the Sunny Slope area nearFairfield, not far from where the rancher and his two sons had watched theUFOs. They were able to see the light, but because of the hilly terrain, could notget closer to it. After two hours of trying to get closer, they lost sight of itentirely. Teton County Sheriff Pete Howard received a report approximately two weekslater from a family who lives in the Rocky Mountains west of Chouteau. Whiletelling Sheriff Howard about a UFO they had seen the morning of February 22,the couple also said they had seen UFOs on at least five other occasions and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"some of their employees had also seen some. Most of the appearances were around 7 o'clock in the morning. In the case ofthe February 22 sighting, the man had just stepped out on the upper deck oftheir home to put up the flag when he noticed a very large object moving veryslowly. It had apparently come out from behind one mountain and was startingto go behind another mountain peak. In his excitement, the man said he calledto his wife and children to step outside and see it, but there was some delay asthey didn't know at first what he wanted. Then they had trouble getting the dooropen. He estimated he watched the object for about 30 to 40 seconds, but therest of the family saw it only about ten seconds. The man said he didn't have an opportunity to get field glasses, but he describedthe object as large and elliptical in shape. He said it seemed to have a row oflights around the circumference. The incident was the fifth time since the first ofthe year that the couple had seen UFOs. In another instance, the objectappeared to be very low in a canyon. Three sightings were in the mountains andthe others on the flats below. The couple pointed out that each time they hadseen a UFO was on an extremely windy day with very little cloud cover. A Havre woman told how she and her son, while traveling near Chief JosephBattleground, saw \"an enormous ball in the sky.\" She described it as bright kellygreen with a tail of gold sparks like fireworks. A Helena woman wrote aboutseeing a gigantic light that lit up the entire western sky when she was drivingnear Helena. On the same Sunday evening of early March, 1975, two Belt women who werereturning home separately from Great Falls, each saw an unidentified flyingobject near the highway. The one woman, who was traveling alone, said she sawa white light as big as her car hovering over her about 20 feet above thehighway. She told officers she drove the rest of the way to Belt at a high rate ofspeed, hoping to attract a highway patrolman. The other woman had her two teenage daughters with her. At first she said theythought the bright light they saw was a helicopter, but when they got closer to itand it remained stationary, they decided it could not be a helicopter. Theegg-shaped object had two lights beamed from the front of it to the ground, butthe three people watching it were mystified by the fact there was no circle oflight on the ground where the beams were shining. The woman told Captain Wolverton that at first she was extremely frightened,but suddenly a strange feeling of calm came over her and the two girls. One ofthe girls even laid down in the seat of the car in order to look up under theobject which was close beside the highway. As suddenly as it had come, the feeling of calm left them and the woman saidshe \"floor boarded\" the car and got home as rapidly as possible. To corroboratetheir story, she had each of her daughters and herself separately tell her waitinghusband what they had seen. Each told the same story, although the girls had afew more minor details. \"I had to drive, you know,\" the woman said. Both women waited until some time later to report the sightings, but theincidents took on added significance when the dates were checked and it waslearned that calf as mutilated apparently one or two nights before. The place where the first woman saw the UFO was in the immediate area of themutilation, while the second sighting was about four miles away. Another unusual experience was related to law officers by a Bozeman man. Hesaid he was driving south of Augusta just before dark on February 6, 1976, whenhe noticed a car about a half mile behind him. He said the area was flat with noturnoffs from the highway. He had been looking into his rear view mirrorfrequently and this car seemed to \"appear out of nowhere.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"He said the car followed him for six or seven miles, so when he came to aturnoff, he pulled off to wait for it to go by. There was a dip in the highway justbefore the turnoff and he waited for the car to come out of the dip, but it didn't.He finally continued on down the road and the car appeared again. When hereached Bowman's Corner, he pulled off again and waited for it to go by, butagain it never appeared. By strange coincidence, the same thing happened to hisemployer on an earlier night in almost the exact same spot.
