May 11, 2002 Beckhampton, Wiltshire, England - Crop circle investigator,Charles Mallett, reports that the first formation in the British county ofWiltshire, famous as a crop circle hot spot since the 1980s, was discovered onMay 6 in flowering yellow oilseed rape. Charles wrote a report for thecropcircleconnector.com website which began, \"After a hellish struggle througha saturated field of Rape-Seed, near Beckhampton, Wiltshire, we came acrossthe formation laid out high on the slopes of Cannings Down, very close to thespot where in 2000 a large and impressive eleven fold design had appeared in afield of wheat.\"Charles reports this new \"eclipse\" formation spans about 135 feet at its widest in5-foot-high rape (canola). Outside the main formation are three grapeshotflattened circles of three different sizes and separated by about 30 feet from eachother in a triangular pattern. The smallest of those circles seemed pristine anduntouched by any visitors when Charles investigated.Wiltshire County's first 2002 crop formation, an 135-foot-diameter \"eclipse\"and three grapeshot in a triangle pattern nearby.

However,it had rained in the May 6-8 period the formation was found and Charles was"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"overwhelmed by the water when he investigated. The huge physical effort heneeded to simply work his way through the rape's thick yellow pollen and crisp,tangled stems made him wonder who, or what, could make any pattern in thewet rape field.Interview:Charles Mallett, Crop Formation Investigator and new Co-Owner withFrances Mallett of the Silent Circle Cafe, Cherhill, Wiltshire, England:\"It's set back from the road a good half mile or so and I had a half mile walkthrough this 5-foot-high rape seed to get to the formation and by the time I gotthere, I was absolutely soaked as if I had just jumped into the bath with all myclothes on. It's a hellish medium to operate in. Unbelievable! Whole buckets ofwater (in those flowers)! I was carrying a 20-foot camera pole and all myequipment. I had to hold them high because the plants were kind of bristlingaround my face and you can't see far in front of you at all. The tramlines areovergrown and if you can't part the plants with your hands, it's like a tangled you need a machete to get through it. It's a tangled mess and you are reallyfighting the plants to get through it. You are covered with the yellow flowers. Iended up in the formation completely yellow, completely saturated, and luckilyI chose the right tramline and ended up in the middle of the formation.May 6, when this 135-foot-diameter formation was discovered, and days afterward itrained.The stormy sky is evident in this May 8, 2002 photograph © 2002 by Charles Mallett.It's an absolutely kind of surreal experience. It's entirely different from walkinginto a wheat field formation where you actually see the formation as youapproach it. In this stuff, you actually you are looking at the plants 6 inches infront of your face and you kind of fall into the formation and Wow! It's a hugeopen space in this 30 acres of yellow. It is kind of pretty surreal. It's a crop circleexperience that has to be had really, but you don't get it any time of the yearexcept early spring.Unfortunately, we weren't there from the day it happened, so a lot of theevidence on the ground we had to pretty much dismiss because we don't knowhow many people have been there, what they had been doing once they gotthere. So, I stumbled into the formation. It looked quite neat on the ground at agl an ce."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Three grapeshots outside the main \"eclipse\" formation in floweringoilseed rape. Photograph © 2002 by Charles Mallett.At a closer look, at least half the plants were quite badly broken, kinked orbroken. It must be remembered that oilseed rape is a kind of succulent withhollow stems. I've tried it myself if you do bend them over, they do if you havehuman body weight on them they snap off cleanly or have a real ugly kink.There was a lot of that going on in this formation, but as I said, because weweren't the first people down there we didn't find it day one in the morning wecan't rule out that the damage was done by prior visitors in the course of thatday.Clearly people had been in there because there were tracks leading off to two ofthe outlying satellite grapeshot circles, so somebody had been there.The question is whether it was a hoaxer's operation, or something trulymysterious which people went into it afterward?Yes. It's extremely difficult to walk around in that medium without doing severedamage to the plants. I'm looking at the aerial shot on my computer screen rightnow, and I can see the tracks I made walking in the standing crop trying to findthe grapeshots. You know, it's bizarre that these three outlying satellites theywere all pretty close to the formation. But I mean, it's such an unbelievablemedium, we couldn't actually, you could only find one of them and they areonly about 30 feet apart.Charles Mallett mounted his camera on a tall pole to show \"eclipse\" formation inforeground and the three grapeshot beyond, © 2002 by Charles Mallett.Interestingly one of these grapeshots had no tracks leading to it. So, also, makeof that what you will. I personally can't walk in a rape field without causingdamage to the plants. It's just human body weight on a delicate stem will snap,crush, break or leave ugly scars on the plants. It's an unforgiving medium forcrop circles.That said, anyone who could go out into a field in these plants and make aformation, they would have to be really determined because it is horrible stuff to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"operate in. It really is! Bending over a large armful of that stuff is really hardwork. If people went out there and did that, they must be quite motivated.But I would like to make a comparison of how this formation was on the groundto other new formations we have found in oilseed rape in the past, most notablyin 1999 at Milk Hill at Alton Barnes, Wiltshire. We were sure we were the firstones down there. There were no tracks leading into that formation, no kind ofdisturbance at the perimeter of the field. And we knew it had arrived theprevious night and were down there pretty early. (For more about the Malletts'1999 experiences in the oilseed rape field at Milk Hill, see Mysterious Lightsand Crop Circles © 2000 in Earthfiles Shop.)Milk Hill, Wiltshire, discovered May 2, 1999, in yellow floweringoilseed rape, 250 feet long. Charles Mallett encountered a sphere of light insidethe circle at the far right. Photograph © 1999 by Steve Alexander.We walked into that formation and the plants there were about one foot tallerthan this stuff (at Beckhampton 2002). This stuff at the moment is some kind ofhybrid. But the rape at Milk Hill in 1999 was about 6 feet high, so the stemswere a quarter of an inch thicker, maybe. We walked into that formation andevery single stem was neatly bent over, no kinking, no breaking, no damage, noboard marks, nothing like that. Everything was pristine, clean. That arrivedunder similar conditions in terms of weather conditions. There is a kind ofinteresting comparison, really, in that we walked into one that we know wascompletely fresh and we knew we were the first people down there and everysingle plant was perfectly bent over, And as soon as we stand on those plants,we are crushing and causing really ugly dramatic trauma to the plants.In this (new Beckhampton) formation, all of that had already happened. So,either lots of visitors had been there, or it was a human-made formation.Oilseed rape plants propped up at center of one of the three grapeshotsoutside the main \"eclipse\" formation.

I don't have any answers for that at all, which is worrying because Ilike to have answers. But the crop circle phenomenon doesn't really give us thatmany answers. It just gives us a big mystery really, that we try to figure out inour little way.It's kind of telling in a rape field that we can't find one circle, one 15-foot-diameter circle, when people say they can go in there and make a geometricallycoherent pattern. I mean, it's almost beyond belief in some ways because youcan't see over the tops of the plants. So, how are you supposed to take down acoherent pattern. That is kind of beyond me.It also may be worth noting that we have visited formations in the past whichhave been pristine and then we've re-visited them a day or two later and theyhave been deliberately for whatever reason vandalized and kind of roughed up.The edges have been roughed up, someone has whacked post holes into it ormade stuff just to create the impression that it's another hoax. We can't rule outthat this is a genuine event, but also we can't rule out that it's a possible hoax. Itlooks good from the road, that's for sure.Just to be in one of those fields in a flattened area is a real surreal experience,especially under the circumstances we found ourselves the high pressure, thestormy sky. It had a real atmosphere about it. That generated it's own kind ofmagic.Charles and Frances Mallett will open The Silent Circle Cafe on June 1, 2002from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily on the A4 Beckhampton-Calne Road, below theCherhill White Horse and obelisk near Calne, Wiltshire.The Silent Circle CafeI understand that you and your wife, Frances, are embarking on a newbusiness venture that will be tied to the crop circles and the people wholove to go into Wiltshire and search for them.What we are about to do is open at Cherhill, Wiltshire, a cafe, The Silent CircleCafe, which is going to provide a selection of fine foods, cakes, soups, breadrolls, real wholesome English food. We are also going to have an entire cornerof the cafe dedicated to the crop circle phenomenon. This area receivesthousands and thousands of tourists every year and essentially there is no placefor these people to go to find unbiased, up-to-date, accurate information aboutwhere the crop formations are and what the condition of them is and imagery.Also we are going to have an internet access point. So essentially as well ashaving the cafe and fine foods and all of that, we are going to have the cropcircle information center which is freely available to anybody who comes tosouthern England to look at crop circles.Cherhill's White Horse is a real enigmatic spot. We have this huge Egyptian-styleobelisk standing on top of the hill near the White Horse and the cafe is downbelow the obelisk. You can see it from the front garden of the cafe where we will"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"have outside seating.
