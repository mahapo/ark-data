August 19, 2002 Pitt near Winchester, Hampshire, U. K. On Thursdayafternoon, August 15, 2002, editors Mark Fussell and Stuart Dike at thewebsite, www.cropcircleconnector.com, received an e-mail from a man who alsoe-mailed Lucy Pringle. The text said there was a \"new crop circle near"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Winchester\" and also gave street guidance to the farm location along theCrabwood copse in the village of Pitt near Winchester. The editors neededsomeone to fly over the formation which Julian Gibsone did on Friday morning,August 16. The editors also called Charles Mallett at The Silent Circle Cafe inCherhill. Charles and his wife, Frances, operate the cafe and have investigatedand photographed more than a hundred formations the past few years insouthern England. The couple went to Winchester also on Friday morning tostudy and photograph the ground lay of what Charles perceived to be an\"amazingly precise\" pattern. Charles learned from me that farm worker Sydney Collis described marks andlines that made up a partialy completed \"square\" (rectangle frame) in the fieldon Wednesday, August 14. Mr. Collis said he did not see the circle code and didnot think the face pattern was filled in at that time. But Charles Mallett wondersif Sydney Collis might not have seen or understood that a complete formationwas actually in place on Wednesday morning, August 14, 2002, the exact yearanniversary of the Chilbolton Radio Observatory humanoid face that appearedon August 14, 2001, followed by a rectangular pattern of binary code. Whoever, or whatever, made the Winchester 2002 face and code, Charles andFrances Mallett were impressed by the unusual way the crops were laid downand lack of normal hoaxing evidence. Interview: Charles Mallett, Crop Formation Field Researcher and Co-Owner withFrances Mallett, The Silent Circle Cafe, Cherhill, Wiltshire, England: \"We(with Frances) were pretty much one of the first people down there. Thelocation was actually withheld for a short time because the whole thing lookedextremely delicate and needed to be looked at quickly.How did you get information that it was there?Via the editors of the cropcircleconnector website. They had it reported to themby I'm not sure who. But they let us know just before they uploaded it to theinternet when it was reported on the 15th. But our feeling is that it was probablythe 14th primarily because the previous year, the Chilbolton face and codeformation happened on the 14th, one year to the day.The field is really hard to find. It's really out of the way. You can't see the thingfrom anywhere at all until you are pretty much right in the field. It's very flat ontop of a hill.So, we went in and had a really hands and knees job. We crawled all over thething and we couldn't find any board marks nothing. We did find some creases inthe plants from maybe one or two visitors before us, but we were the firstresearchers that we know of who went down there. We couldn't find anyevidence whatsoever of board marks or anything mechanical. In fact, the crop isso unbelievably mature. It's been really hot here for the last week or so. It'sbrittle, burned dry, ready to be cut."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Inside binary disc at Vale Farm, near Crabwood copse of trees, village of Pitt, Winchester,Hampshire, England. August 16, 2002 pole shot © 2002 by Charles R. Mallett.It wasn't put down mechanically with planks of wood like a conventional hoaxwould. We're certainly looking at something else. My initial impression fromlooking at the aerial image,is that physically it looks like it has been scannedinto the field digitally. It's amazingly precise. The subtle shading and the featuresare pretty incredible. It makes last year's events at Chilbolton look simplistic.On the ground, absolutely no sense of what is going on. It's too big.The farmer said his tramlines were 21 meters apart and that based on thatit was 280 feet wide by 350 feet long.Yeah, that could be wrong. It's much larger than the stuff that was happening atChilbolton last year, the 2001 face and code. It's totally related. There is nodoubt about that. On the ground, the construction was the same. There weresubtle differences. Obviously, it's a different situation. But just generally, theway the crop was put down, for us it was undoubtedly the same agency. Thatagency is the particular question which we would like to be answered and thereis a lot of speculation because we can't find any evidence on the ground offaking, I don't know.August 16, 2002, inside Winchester formation at Vale farm near Crabwood copse oftrees in Pitt village near Winchester. Pole shot © 2002 by Charles R. Mallett.This could possibly be a sophisticated hoax, perhaps satellite-basedtechnologies being used. I don't really know what these guys have at theirdisposal in their inventory. But I guess anything that we know about, they'veprobably got stuff that is 50 years ahead of that. So, it's within plausibleparameters that they could have technologies available which could dosomething like that. It's essentially a scary alien holding out a disc withinformation on it.For us, aesthetically, just looking at the image and even standing back six feet,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"this is probably the most audacious pattern, design, or whatever you want to callit, in a crop field in southern England that has ever happened. We cannot figureout how it was done. It literally looked like it had been scanned into a field, as ifyou scanned an image into your computer. It really does look like that. We can'tfigure out how it was constructed when we stood in that thing on the groundand what we were seeing was absolutely confusing. If we hadn't had an aerialshot first, we wouldn't have figured that thing out, no doubt at all. No idea. Wewould have located the disc and seen some kind of spiral with blocks on it, butthat would be about it. We had to see an aerial image. We would never havefigured it out.Circular disc of binary code, Vale Farm in Pitt village near Winchester.Pole shot © 2002 by Charles R. Mallett.To us, if it is a hoax, it would have had to have been done from air, even in theactual way the crop was laid. If you look at a formation that has been put downin a conventional hoaxing style which is with a 3-foot wide plank of wood, thenas we have discussed on occasion, it leaves marks on the actual laid crop in theform of creases across the crop where the plank has actually squashed down intothe wheat, leaving an obvious physical mark. That's common sense.In this formation, we could not find any of that at all. We were in there when itwas fresh and on our hands and knees looking hard for evidence that this couldbe manmade on the ground and we couldn't find any of that apart from thedamage we were doing with our feet.Also, the way the crop was laid was actually quite bizarre as if it had beenscanned into a field. That's kind of how it looked, with finger-wide hard toexplain. In the images I'll send you, you'll see what I'm talking about. There is nokind of plank width for lays of crop. It's as if something came down and draggedacross the field and just put the whole thing down quite quickly. I can't conceiveof any technology that could do that and I can't conceive of any human hoaxesthat could do that on the ground.So, I'm as bemused as everybody about this one. We just don't know. But itdoesn't fit with standard hoaxing criteria. It doesn't really fit with benevolentgenuine crop circle phenomenon either. So, it seems possibly there is a thirdagency involved here which is possibly government and military covertoperations: 'Scary aliens are coming. Do what we say and you'll be fine' kind ofscenario possibly. We just don't know. It's total speculation. At that moment thatformation is a major enigma and is certainly the most audacious and mostamazing pattern that has ever occurred in southern England.\"We b s it e s : http://www.yowusa.com/Archive/August2002/crabwood1/crabwood1.htm"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"http://home.clara.net/lucypringle http://www.cropcircleconnector.com http://www.cropcircleresearch.com http://www.temporarytemples.co.ukCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
