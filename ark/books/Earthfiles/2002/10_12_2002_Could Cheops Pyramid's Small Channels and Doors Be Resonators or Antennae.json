October 12, 2002 Athens, New York - In 1957, a brilliant analysis of Egyptianarchitecture was published by philosopher Schwaller de Lubicz in a 3-volumebook entitled, The Temple of Man, after his fifteen years of painstakingmeasurement work at Luxor and other Egyptian sacred sites. The miraculouspyramid and temple structures were, for de Lubicz, the end result of evolvedconsciousness applying the universe's rules of sacred geometry and Law of Onein which \"as above, so below\" provided an architectural blueprint for thesoul/spirit's evolution toward immortality.De Lubicz's groundbreaking work was in French and not read by most English-speaking people until writer and independent Egyptologist, John Anthony West,translated and synthesized De Lubicz's theories in John's book, Serpent In TheSky, published in 1993. Now, at a time when serious war threatens between theUnited States and Iraq and even safe travel in Egypt might be halted, John hasproduced a 6-part DVD and CD entitled Magical Egypt that takes the viewerinside temples and pyramids to see the secret and sacred science of the ancientsthrough the eyes and mind of Schwaller de Lubicz. See More Information andWe b s i t e b e l o w .With John's extensive experience in decades of travel and research in Egypt including his own groundbreaking geological research of the Sphinx that lead tothe hypothesis that it was weathered by water erosion more than 10,000 yearsago I wanted to find out what John thinks about the newly discovered littledoors, or blocks, inside the 8-inch-diameter \"air shafts or star channels\" of thegreat Cheops Pyramid that have baffled archaeologists for decades. His firstresponse surprised me: that the narrow channels might not simply be aimed atstars, but at star resonances.\"The figure is from the second golden shrine in the Tomb of Tutankhamen.It is one of a row of identical mummiform figures, part of a complex and particularlyenigmatic funerary test.

With Cheops, it might not be star light, but starresonances.My guess would be that the narrow channels are somehow meant to resonatewith the stars. In other words, it's resonating stellar energy. Now, of course, thisstellar energy can't be measured, but there are a lot of things that can't bemeasured.They knew what they were doing. We have to guess what they were doing. Butwhen they are going to that much trouble to do something or another with thatlevel of expertise, they've got something in mind that we don't understand.And the overriding issue for the Egyptians was immortality, eternal life, which isnot meant in some stupid way as wandering around in the afterlife drinking beer although that's not so bad. But it has to do with conscious spiritual developmentand at the culmination of that, having successfully carried out that enterprise,let's say, the lifetime of the seeker, the sugar plum at the end is a higher state ofconsciousness that is not subject to time.In some way, those pyramids facilitate that process. Those little star channelsmight tune the whole device to the stars in some way that we just plain don'tunderstand.Cheops King's Chamber, a temple of secret initiationwhere those chosen were taught how to experience the release of the soul fromthe body container. Source: The Secret Teachings of All Ages © 1925 by Manly P. Hall.Editor's Note by Linda Howe: In his book, Secrets of the Great Pyramid ©1971 by Peter Tompkins, he summarized theosophist H. P. Blavatsky'sdescription of the Cheops King's Chamber in her classic work about occultmysteries, The Secret Doctrine, this way: \"(She) says the Pyramid not onlyindicated the courses of the stars in heaven, but was 'the everlasting record andthe indestructible symbol of the Mysteries and Initiations on Earth,' ...a templeof initiation where men rose towards the Gods and the Gods descended towardsmen.\"According to Manly P. Hall in his extraordinary classic, The Secret Teachings ofAll Ages, he described an ancient Hermetic process in which the Great Pyramidwas used to teach initiates how to experience the release of the soul from thebody container. \"The candidate was laid in the great stone coffin, and for three"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"days his spirit - freed from its mortal coil - wandered at the gateways of eternity.His Ka, as a bird, flew through the spiritual spheres of space. He discovered thatall the universe was life, all the universe was progress, all the universe waseternal growth. Realizing that his body was a house which he could slip out ofand return to without death, he achieved actual immortality. At the end of threedays, he returned to himself again, and having thus personally and actuallyexperienced the great mystery (of consciousness continuing after the moment ofdeath), he was indeed an Initiate - one who beheld and one to whom religionhad fulfilled her duty bringing him to the light of God.\" TAKING YOUR IDEA THAT THESE CHANNELS IN CHEOPS MIGHT BEFOCUSED ON SPECIFIC STARS TO RESONATE WITH SOME KIND OFSTARLIGHT FREQUENCY OUT THERE WE DON'T FULLY UNDERSTANDAND THAT CHEOPS MIGHT BE LIKE AN INSTRUMENT DESIGNED TORESONATE AT A CERTAIN FREQUENCY OR FREQUENCIES BECAUSETHOSE LITTLE CHANNELS ARE THERE WITH THOSE BLOCKS.Well, that's part of it.IF WE BEGAN LOOKING AT CHEOPS AS A PIECE OF EQUIPMENT THATCAN RESONATE, AND CAN RESONATE AT CERTAIN FREQUENCIESWHETHER IT IS STARLIGHT FREQUENCY OR WHATEVER, THEN ITBEGINS TO MAKE YOUR MIND SEE THAT THESE LITTLE BLOCKSMIGHT BE IN THERE SPECIFICALLY FOR TUNING PURPOSES.Maybe. Along those lines, another John West hypothesis one of the bigmysteries about the pyramid is the that strange pit, the bottom most chamberthat's left unfinished. The usual explanation is that it was the original burialchamber and then it got to a certain point and decided, 'We don't want to dothat.' And then they changed their mind and decided to put the burial chamberup higher. But to me, I never bought that. I don't believe the pyramid is theresult of changes of mind. Although, I do believe it represents at least two ormaybe more stages of building. But anyway, John West's hypothesis's hypothesisis that the whole thing is intended as some kind of instrument and if you want totune a regular instrument, let's say a guitar - you tighten the frets so you get theright resonance. If you are trying to tune a stone instrument there's nothing youcan tighten.However, if you want to get it exactly right, you just hollow something out. Inother words, you remove stone until you get exactly the right resonance. Thatstruck me as a possibility. In other words, the whole thing is a resonantstructure, maybe tuned to the stars. I don't know. Maybe designed to attune usto the stars. Again, this is pure speculation, but it did cross my mind. I have thishypothesis that the whole pyramid is indeed tuned and even the unfinishedchamber down below is part of that process.WHEN WE MAKE ANTENNAS, WE TALK ABOUT A WAVEGUIDE. ISN'TTHAT THE WHOLE POINT OF CHANNELS IN ANTENNAS?Could be. Yeah. In other words, an antenna again, we're talking about a stoneinstrument. So how you can't put an antenna on a stone instrument. Actually, Ilike that, Linda, that these channels are sort of the negative of an antenna. Anantenna is a rod that goes out into the air and attracts certain sound waves. Ifyou have a stone instrument, maybe those little channels are reverse antennas,hollow antennas. I quite like that. These are among the huge mysteries to besolved.\"More Information:To learn more about John Anthony West's extraordinary DVD and CD,call toll free 800-757-6644.
