See Earthfiles report.I interviewed Prof. Douglas Causey, Ph.D., Senior Vertebrate Biologist, Museumof Comparative Zoology, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Hedoubted the estimated 14-foot-wingspan that residents described and suggestedthe answer could be a bird so rare it hasn't been officially observed for nearlyfifty years: the sub-species of the Steller's Sea Eagle known as Haliaeetuspelagicus niger. Niger is Latin for \"dark.\" Eyewitnesses stressed that the largebird seen in Alaska is all dark in color. The Niger Sea Eagle is all dark exceptfor its white tail; the Steller's Sea Eagle has white shoulders and tail. Neitherspecies of sea eagle reaches a 14-foot-wingspan. In this report, I have includedfor comparison photographs and information about other modern birds that havelarge wingspans.Dark \"morph\" or sub-species of the Steller's Sea Eagle(Haliaeetus pelagicus niger). Tail feathers are white and adult wingspans reach 4 to 5 feet.Since the bird has not been officially seen for half a century, it has been considered extinct.Drawing from Handbook of Birds of the World, Edited by Josep Del Hoyo.1) \"I was amazed recently to hear of the bird with the 14 ft. wingspan had beensighted by others in other States. It was back in November 1993. I took my sonhunting over at the area where Northern Nevada, Utah, and Idaho cometogether. It is a rather remote area of Utah at a place called Mahogany Springwith a few ranchers in the area, but little else except desert.My son and I were driving on a dirt road traveling back to an area we wanted tocheck out for deer, as that is what we were hunting, and off to the right of thevehicle about 100 yds., I saw this large dark animal sitting on a knoll, and Iremember saying to my son, 'Look at the bear, son, up on that small hill.' We"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"both watched it for a few minutes. I also made the remark that I didn't think thatthere were black bears in the west desert of Utah.Just as I said this, the so-called bear spread its wings and started to fly from thearea. We were totally flabbergasted when this happened, as I knew I had neverheard of a bird this large. It stood about four feet tall when it was perched onthe ground and I estimated that each wing was just shy of being twice that length(or about 14 feet across). I couldn't get this bird off my mind, and haven't since. Ithought it was just a gigantic Golden Eagle that was a freak of nature. It fits thedescription that was given in your report to a tee.

I saw it about a year ago. It flew over my home here in the SkagitValley in Washington State.I looked up to see a large object in the sky. About 700 to 900 feet up. Maybe1000 or so. It was hard to tell. We have a lot of eagles that fly overhead. Thereare eagle nests nearby in a grove of cedars. This bird was not an eagle, at leastnot the kind of eagles that we see regularly. After the bird was close enough forme to actually see that it was some kind of large bird, I became transfixed at thesight of it. It was colored similarly to what has been described in your report.Bronze is a good description. The head was a lighter color, like more tan incolor.The thing that set this bird off from the eagles was not only it's size, but alsosomething else that helped indicate the size of the thing. The wings. This thingwas moving on pretty well and the wings powering the flight were like an eagle,but at least twice the span of a mature eagle. Possibly three times the size.These wings beat slowly and with great power. This bird traveled through the airwith a consistency of velocity that appeared to match it's shear size and weight.I watched this large bird fly at between 800 & 1000 feet high, coming from theNorthwest, proceeded toward the Southwest. From my location it looked as if itwere heading toward the Olympic Mountains.Sincerely yours, Bennie Rawson\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3) \"Maybe in 1968-69, I saw film footage shown on a Detroit station of alarge bird that knocked a full grown ram mountain goat off of amountain ledge. They indicated that it was an Andes Condor. Andean Condor (Vultur Gryphus) flying. Center, is a female Andean Condor;far right is a male. Adult height reaches 4 feet and wingspans up to 10 feet,thought to be the longest-winged birds on land.The interesting thing about the film was that the bird held onto the ramas the ram fell down the side of the cliff. The bird had a hold of him behind theneck. The ram was falling under the bird. When the bird attacked theram, he had folded his wings back in the typical high speed angle andmaintained this posture during two thirds of the free fall down the faceof the cliff. The narrator said the cliff was maybe twelve hundredfeet down onto a rock strewn floor. Much to my amazement, the bird slowlyarched his wings back flying and pulled up from thevertical drop into horizontal flight while still holding onto the ram. Thebird and the ram glided off behind a fall of trees.I have just researched Andes Condors and the site indicates that they donot have the ability to grasp a pray as an eagle does with its talonsand then fly away. If that is true, the bird on the film was not a condor.The weight of the ram must have been at least 80 lbs. The forcessustained by this bird during the transition from the vertical drop to ahorizontal plane were enormous. This would take a very large and powerfulbird to accomplish this feat. This film was photographed during the time thatspecial effects were very crude and easy to spot. This film was not faked.Steve Bevington\"California Condor (gymnogyps californianus) is North America's largestterrestrial bird, weighing up to 22 pounds with a wingspan of 9.5 feet. It can reach altitudesof 15,000 and may fly 140 miles a day in search of carrion on which it feeds. Onendangeredspecies list. Photographs above and below courtesy of U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 4) \"I heard your report on the Art Bell show concerning the \"giant bird\" and canonly say it is more than likely a giant condor - they are dark brown to a sootyblack, with a lighter colored head and have a wing-span of ten to twelve feet.They can achieve heights of 23,000 feet, being the highest flying bird inexistence, and are capable of snatching up a sheep or goat and carrying it away.In fact, there is another bird that has even a larger wing-span than the condor -the wandering albatross, which is closer to 14 feet. The color favors the condorthough - and who is to say just how large they are capable of growing in thewild? Nick K.\"Albatross. The Royal Albatross (Diomedea epomophora) has a recordedwingspan of 11 feet 6 inches (3.5 meters) and the Wandering Albatross (Diomedia exulans)can reach 11 feet 11 inches (3.63 meters), the longest officially recorded wingsin a living bird in the modern world.More Information:In 1980, the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum displayed parts of askeleton of the biggest known bird that ever flew on earth. Its fossil remainswere discovered along the banks of Salinas Grandes de Hidalgo in the ArgentinaLa Pampa province 400 miles southwest of Buenos Aires. The huge birdskeleton named Argentavis magnificens had a 25 feet wingspan (8 meters) andwas 11.5 feet (3.5 meters) from beak to tail. This giant bird lived during theMiocene (23 to 5 million years ago).Other large Miocene birds were Teratornis merrami and Osteodotornis orri.We b s it e :http://www.clemetzoo.com/rttw/condor/allabt.htmhttp://www.defenders.org/wildlife/birds/calcondor.htmlhttp://fadr.msu.ru/o-washinet/spysnop.htmlhttp://www.earthlife.net/birds/intro.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"earthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
