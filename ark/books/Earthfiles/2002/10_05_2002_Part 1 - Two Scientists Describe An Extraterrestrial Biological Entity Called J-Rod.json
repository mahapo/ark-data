I had produced the 1980 documentary, A Strange Harvest,for KMGH-TV (CBS) in Denver, Colorado where I was Director of SpecialProjects. For the television film, I interviewed many people in law enforcement,including Lou Girodo, Chief Investigator for the District Attorney's Office inTrinidad, Colorado. He had been assigned to investigate mysterious, bloodless,trackless animal deaths in southern Colorado and told me on camera that he andother investigators had concluded the perpetrators were \"creatures not from thisplanet.\"The enormous public response to that broadcast eventually provoked Home BoxOffice to contract with me to produce an hour for HBO in which I could furtherexplore the issue of an extraterrestrial presence on earth. What happened duringthe challenge to develop that project is detailed in my first book, An AlienHarvest. (See Earthfiles Shop.) As I tried to go deeper into American militaryand intelligence knowledge about extraterrestrial biological entities and thestrict cover-up that kept such knowledge from the general public and media, Italked off the record with a few, some now dead, who described their first handknowledge of and experiences with extraterrestrial biological entities. Duringthis period, I also met Bill Hamilton, a computer programmer then living in thePalmdale, California area who was also trying to get to the facts of U. S.government knowledge and cover-up of one or more non-human speciesinvolved with this world and its solar system.In 1999, Bill told me that he was talking to a mechanical engineer named BillUhouse who had worked on a U. S. military program to build an advancedsimulator that could teach certain American pilots how to fly disc craft - eitherback-engineered or actual alien craft. The technical adviser on the project wasallegedly an EBEN called \"J-Rod,\" who had been working with a secret agencyof the United States government since 1953 at Los Alamos National Laboratoryin northern New Mexico and in a secret underground facility called Site 4"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"literally inside the Papoose Mountains near Groom Lake, Area 51 and NellisAFB.The S-4 facility inside the Papoose Mountain range is supposed to haveseveral levels, some designated for non-human craft storage, back-engineering research andapplications to modern human technologies. At least one level is said to be used formaintaining one ormore extraterrestrial biological entities (Ebens) in special environmental spheres designedto providea different, non-earth atmosphere for Ebens kept as a \"guest\" or in a \"captive\" status.Uhouse, now 78-years-old and knowing his non-disclosure agreement with theU. S. government expires in 2003, began speaking publicly about hisexperiences. Back then on June 14, 1999, I presented in Earthfiles.com with hispermission, \"The Strange Story of J-Rod, An EBE\" © 1999 by Bill Hamilton.Since then, Bill has had in-depth communications with a microbiologistoriginally named Danny Benjamin Crain who changed his name for personalfamily reasons, he says, to Dan Burisch. Dr. Dan Burisch (Ph.D., StateUniversity of New York, Stoneybrook), also describes an assignment to study thebiological fluids and tissues of an EBEN called J-Rod inside S-4 up to 1995.Then he was assigned to a new project called Star Flower in which he researchesmaterials allegedly related to panspermia, the seeding of life on earth fromextraterrestrial sources. Project Star Flower is ongoing.This week, Bill Hamilton and I discussed Bill Uhouse's and Dr. Dan Burisch'salleged experiences with one or more extraterrestrial biological entities referredto as J-Rods.Interview:Bill Hamilton, Programmer-Analyst 4, University of California, LosAngeles, and Executive Director, Skywatch International, Inc., Lancaster,California: \"Bill Uhouse's particular role in the secret government project wasto build and test what he calls a simulator, 'a flying saucer simulator.' The reasonfor this is that the simulator had built into it the standard avionics that, forinstance, our U.S. Air Force pilots are used to and they were taught with thesimulator how to fly one of these gravity field-driven craft.\"Summary of Bill Uhouse'sBackground: Born 1924.Ten years fighter pilot in the U. S."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Marine Corps.Fought in last part of WWII andKorean War.Honorable discharge as MarineCorps Captain.1954-1958, employed as civilianmechanical engineer by U.S. AirForce at Wright Patterson AFB,Dayton, Ohio, to do experimentalflight testing on various modifiedaircraft. Also asked to work on a\"flying disc simulator\" through acommercial civilian company calledA-Link Aviation whichmanufactured simulators.1958-1988, worked on \"flying discsimulators\" in which certain U.S.Air Force pilots trained. Firstfunctional simulator in 1958, copiedfrom a \"30-meter-diameterextraterrestrial craft retrieved in1952 or 1953 from Kingman,Arizona.\"Retired and living in Nevada.\"Part of Bill's story was that the technical knowledge, the physics, for theseparticular reverse engineered craft came from an extraterrestrial biological entity(Eben) which he said was 'J-Rod.' The entity was once said to have drawn asymbol that looked like our letter 'J,' followed by a straight line that looked likea rod.THAT IS SUPPOSED TO STAND FOR WHAT?We don't know what it stands for. Initially we took it to mean this was just somekind of a name that they gave this entity. In other words, instead of just saying,'Hey, you!' they called him J-Rod. What Bill Uhouse said initially is that thisJ-Rod is kind of head of the (flying saucer simulator) project.THERE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE WORKING TOGETHER IN WHICHINSTALLATION?Bill said he worked in two places: one was Los Alamos, New Mexico, and theother was at Site 4 (S-4), Papoose Mountain, Groom Lake, Nevada.WHERE WAS J-ROD SUPPOSED TO BE BASED?This is how we started to learn that J-Rod was a designation for this type ofentity because it turns out there were at least two J-Rods, at least two. Maybemore. But, the two J-Rods were located - one was at Los Alamos (NationalLaboratory) and the other - as we know now - was located in an environmentalsphere inside an installation known as Site 4, or some call it Sector 4. But it'sSite 4 within Papoose Mountain itself.AT AREA 51?In that general area.DID BILL UHOUSE DESCRIBE HOW CLOSE HE WAS TO J-ROD WHENJ-ROD WAS COMMUNICATING?All I remember was that he was in the same room with him.DID HE REMEMBER ANY KIND OF ODOR?I don't recall that he mentioned that, no.DID HE EVER TOUCH J-ROD'S SKIN?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I don't recall that he touched him, no.J-ROD WAS ABOUT HOW HIGH?Somewhere around 4 foot 9 and 5 feet tall.AND HE HAD REPTILIAN EYES?I don't know. The way he drew them, he had those dark, tear drop, large blacklenses, or whatever they are?COVERINGS.Coverings. So, I don't think he had any direct look at the eyes.SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT WHAT'S UNDERNEATH THOSE DARKLENSES LIKE SUNGLASSES ARE YELLOW EYES WITH VERTICALPUPILS. THAT'S WHY I WONDERED.I cannot confirm that as regards J-Rod.YOU AND I HAVE EXCHANGED A DRAWING THAT IS IDENTIFIED ASJ-ROD.Yes, that is the one that was drawn by Bill Uhouse.Drawing of J-Rod by mechanical engineer, Bill Uhouse, based on J-Rod'sappearance dressed in a human man's shirt in 1970s or early 1980s at a conference tablewith physicist Edward Teller and eighteen scientists, including Uhouse. The project thatlinked Uhouse to J-Rodwas a \"flying saucer simulator\" to teach certain U. S. Air Force pilots to flyback-engineered,and/or actual, extraterrestrial craft.THE BEING WAS WEARING A MAN'S SHIRT. WHEN UHOUSE DREWTHAT, WHAT WAS HIS RELATIONSHIP TO THE EBEN KNOWN ASJ-ROD?The only relationship was that Uhouse was part of the project team where J-Rodwas an advisor in terms of what he might need to know technically. Scientific Meetings Lead by J-Rod and Physicist Edward TellerTHAT UHOUSE WOULD HAVE TO KNOW TECHNICALLY?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yes. Apparently, Bill Uhouse was in attendance at a conference table with anumber of scientists at Los Alamos. At one end of the table was the head of theproject which by name, according to Uhouse, was Dr. Edward Teller. At theother end of the table was J-Rod. In attendance around the conference table, Iguess, were 18 scientists and engineers.WHAT YEAR WAS THIS SUPPOSED TO BE?Not sure of the year. It might date back as far as the 1970s, or early 1980s. ButI'm not sure.AT THIS TABLE IN WHICH J-ROD IS PRESIDING WITH EDWARD TELLERWHO MOST OF US KNOW WAS DIRECTOR OF THE STAR WARSPROGRAM UNDER THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION AND IF THIS WASIN THE 1970S, THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN BEFORE THE PUBLICANNOUNCEMENT OF THE REAGAN STAR WARS PROGRAM WHATWAS THE SUBJECT BETWEEN J-ROD, THE CONFERENCE TABLE OFSCIENTISTS AND EDWARD TELLER?I have no idea. That wasn't disclosed to me. I wish I knew! But Bill said it wasquite a scene (laughs).IT WOULD SEEM THAT DESCRIBING A MEETING WITH EDWARDTELLER AND SCIENTISTS AND AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICALENTITY DRESSED IN A HUMAN SHIRT IN THE 1970S WOULDCERTAINLY BE WORTH GOING INTO GREAT DETAIL ABOUT WHATWAS BEING DISCUSSED AND WHAT THE EBEN WAS SAYING.You have to realize that Bill came out with a story in the 1990s and he did it intalks that he gave that were probably limited to about one hour. And when hebegan to speak publicly, he said that his supervisors or managers or whoeverthey were I believe they were two different men from the National SecurityAgency (NSA) had OK'd his (Bill Uhouse) saying some of this in public.DID HE EXPLAIN WHY?I guess he thought perhaps the managers wanted to see how this all would fly inpublic and whether anybody would believe him. He was one of seven trainedindividuals who could work on the flying saucer simulator, build it and test it. Ihave a drawing somewhere of what that simulator looked like drawn by GlennCampbell, another Area 51 investigator."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"In September 1996, Area 51 investigator, Glenn Campbell, interviewed Bill Uhouse who hereferred to as\"Jarod 2.\" Working with Uhouse's direction, Campbell drew the UFO simulator graphicsabove © 1996.WHAT SPECIFICALLY DID BILL UHOUSE SAY IT WAS LIKE TO BE INJ-ROD'S PHYSICAL PRESENCE?To be in his physical presence, namely he said that what was odd was J-Rod'sway of communicating and that was, if Uhouse had a question on his mind,J-Rod would answer the question in his (Uhouse's) mind, using his own voice.YOU'RE TALKING NOW ABOUT TELEPATHY IN WHICH BILL UHOUSEWOULD HEAR HIS OWN THOUGHT VOICE IN HIS MIND, BUT IT WASBEING PROVOKED BY THE NON-HUMAN NAMED J-ROD?Yes. As far as Uhouse's own thought voice, I don't know it was audible orinaudible. (SEE: Part 2 for Uhouse's own description which does seem todescribe audible Q & A with J-Rod.)THE IDEA WAS THAT AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITY(EBEN) WITH ADVANCED KNOWLEDGE WOULD HELP OURGOVERNMENT BUILD SIMULATORS TO TEACH AMERICAN PILOTSHOW TO FLY DISC-SHAPED EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT?Essentially. In fact, not just from Uhouse, but from multiple sources, they painta picture that we have established some kind of exchange, scientific exchangeprogram, with these Ebens. This program has been going on since, I think it wasestablished sometime around the mid-1960s and has been going on since thattime with the arrival of a being they designated as EBE 2. Then, after EBE 2,one of the beings that arrived was EBE 3 and it was supposedly EBE 3 that hadtwo assistants that have different specialties or special knowledge and these werethe J-Rods. Zeta Reticulii 1 and 2 and Gliese 876-c Star SystemsDID HE HAVE ANY IMPRESSION FROM J-ROD ABOUT J-ROD'S PLANETOR THE WAY J-ROD LIVED WHEN HE WAS NOT IN THE CONFINES OFLOS ALAMOS OR AREA 51?No. He mentioned that J-Rod was originally from the Zeta Reticulum system.ZETA RETICULII I AND II, THE BINARY SYSTEM?Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The yellow binary star system Zeta Reticulii 1 and 2 is about 37 light years from Earth.Both suns are similar to the Earth's sun. The distance between the binary stars is estimatedto be nearly 100 times the distance from Pluto to our sun. Thus, a solar system around onestar is not expected to disturb another solar system around the second star. WHAT IS J-ROD AND HIS SPECIES, KIND, CIVILIZATION - WHAT ARETHEY DOING ON EARTH IN THE FIRST PLACE?Actually, I gained more information from Dr. Dan Burisch when I discussed thiswith him.\" Continued in Part 2.We b s it e s :http://www.skywatch-research.orghttp://www.skywatch-research.org/Journal.htmlhttp://www.skywatch-research.org/transcript.htmhttp://www.skywatch-research.org/ufo/levels.htmhttp://www.skywatch-research.org/ufo/Dans_timeline.htmhttp://www.skywatch-research.org/ufo/letters.htmhttp://www.skywatch-research.org/ufo/Saga.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
