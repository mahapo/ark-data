Ti mes reporter, Andrew Revkin, based his report on a 268-pagedocument quietly submitted earlier this spring by the EPA to the United Nationsentitled, \"U. S. Climate Action Report - 2002, the Third NationalCommunication of the United States of America Under the United NationsFramework Convention on Climate Change.\" In that agreement with the U. N.,the United States is honor bound to report every five years on the progress thiscounty is making on environmental issues. Reporter Revkin said the EPA report\"strongly concludes that no matter what is done to cut emissions in the future,nothing can be done about the environmental consequences of several decades'worth of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases already in theatmosphere.\" Further he summarized some of the negative consequences of a warmer earthfrom the Bush administration report: water shortages will become chronic. Rightnow drought is a threat nearly everywhere. No snow packs in the northeast orColorado mountains, for example, and rapid melting of glaciers in Alaska andelsewhere. Some alpine meadows, coral reefs and barrier islands might disappearentirely. Southeastern U. S. forests are threatened. Along coastal and Arcticregions, damage to buildings and roads is expected from storms, rising sea levelsand melting permafrost. Health problems to the public will come from heatstress, air pollution, extreme weather and diseases such as spreading malariathrough mosquito bites and other insects, rodents and ticks. On the positive side,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the EPA report points out, food supplies might increase in some areas withlonger growing seasons and some forests might expand. To better understand this sudden change in the Bush Administration'scharacterization of a growing global warming problem that it admits is here tostay, but we're going to have to get used to without the government offering anysteps to slow down greenhouse emissions, I called Dr. Kevin Trenberth, Head ofthe Climate Analysis Section at the National Center for Atmospheric Research(NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. He had read both the 268-page EPA report andAndrew Revkin's large article in The New York Times. Interview: Kevin Trenberth, Ph.D., Head, Climate Analysis Section, National Centerfor Atmospheric Research (NCAR), Boulder, Colorado: \" What the reportcertainly does is provide a nice compilation of everything that is going on andpulls together the fact that the National Academy of Sciences has stated that theclimate is changing and it is mostly due to human activities. And it also pullstogether all of the material on the emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere thathave occurred, especially in great detail the past ten years from 1990 to 1999,and also makes projections for the next 20 years.Do you think what is happening is that the Bush Administration is seeingdata which indicates global warming is not going to go away and they can'tdo much about it. So, the bottom line message is we're all going to have tolearn to live with it?There is a thread of that which comes through quite strongly in the report. Thereare clear statements that they have made before that they do not want to doanything that would harm the U. S. economy. I think that is a little bit of a falsedichotomy in some ways because it deals only with the effects of what wouldhappen if you try to cut back on carbon dioxide emissions what would that doto the energy sector and what would that do to the economy? But it doesn'treally take into account the costs of the disruption and potential damage thatclimate change would also bring with it, especially in the longer term.In the EPA report that you have read and which is behind The New YorkTimes headline today, does it indicate what likelihood there is that theaverage mean global temperature could increase by as much as 10.5degrees F. over this century?The range from the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change, hadthat as its top level. The more likely values are in the range of about 3 to 4degrees by 2100, but that is very substantial by historical standards. It's themagnitude of a change that occurs when you go from warm to an ice age, exceptwe're going in the other direction. As we go into a warming climate, we aremuch less concerned with things related to ice and snow. Instead, we are muchmore concerned about the availability of water because all of the snow and iceare mostly no longer part of the scene.Then you don't have snow pack and drought increases as it is this year.This year is a good example of the kinds of things we may see a lot more of inthe future. We have widespread drought in the west and southwest some of thedriest conditions we have ever seen. In parts of Colorado, there is no snow packleft at all. There is also a lot of fires and wild fires and it's only the 3rd of June.And so this is really quite worrying.The eastern seaboard has also had some very dry conditions. On the other hand,it's been very wet in between in Illinois and areas in the Midwest there and itrelates to the pattern of weather in part that has occurred."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Computers have long projected that with global warming there would bemore and greater extremes of drought in some areas and tremendous rainand flooding in others. But to grow crops satisfactorily, farmers need moremoderation.I think that is correct. Certainly for agriculture, moderate rains are much morebeneficial and these extremes are not good for many activities, for watermanagement and everything related to comfort, energy usage because you haveto have some people who are really baking and using air conditioning andputting more CO2 into the atmosphere. Then other people are trying to get rid ofwater out of their flooded basements.What could it be like in the United States by this August?Well, this remains to be seen. Certainly in the west, it is very worrying. The riskof some really bad fires is quite high this year. So, I'm hoping that everyone istaking prudent actions and trying to cut down on that by at least not leaving alot of litter and dry materials laying around waiting for a lightning flash orhuman activities to set something underway that can't be stopped.As an atmospheric physicist at NCAR, what was your personal reaction toreading the article in The New York Times today based on the BushAdministration's EPA report?I think the implication is that clearly there is a big problem here because U. S.emissions have gone up substantially what is the actual number? 12% is theestimate this is the 1999 value relative to 1990. Under the Kyoto Protocol, weare supposed to have a cut by some 7% by the year 2012. Instead, we are goingin the other direction.The other thing is that this document suggests it is likely that total U. S.greenhouse emissions will increase by 43% between 2000 and 2020. So, ratherthan holding emissions constant or decreasing, we're projecting a verysubstantial increase. This goes along with much greater global climate change inthe future. And so we are not putting the brakes on this at all.This EPA report is really quite frank and useful in that regard by saying that ifwe don't do anything or we just continue on our current path, this is what weexpect to happen. And so this provides the information for everyone to decidewhether or not, or how much to spend to stop this, or how much to spend to tryto adapt to this because I do think there will be various consequences, variousdisruptions, that will occur that are probably not very predictable. And therecould be some strong negative impacts of these kinds of climate changes as wemove into the future.If over the next twenty years there is a 43% increase in CO2 release overwhat it is now, just from United States traffic and industries, isn't thatgoing to accelerate the rate of average global warming temperatures?That's built into the Intergovernmental Panel On Climate Change projections. Ithink that is probably consistent with some of the predictions we were talkingabout earlier in terms of the changes in temperature. But yeah, it doesn't put anybrakes on it at all.If the United States is the greatest energy user and emitter of greenhousegases, but won't take global leadership on trying to do something about a43% increase in CO2 over the next 20 years, what is the consequence ofthat attitude from your point of view?Well, we're headed towards more use of energy in ways that I think are notsustainable. This is one of the things we can't simply keep doing that. Andcertainly if other countries around the world try to follow the U. S. leadership inthis regard and say, 'All right, we're going to keep increasing population andwe're going to increase our standard of living so we use the same amount ofenergy per capita that is used in the United States.' That is just not sustainable."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"As it is, the U. S. imports a lot of its oil and petroleum products from othercountries and this is a security concern as well. So, by not restricting our use ofenergy in some fashion and trying to rely more on renewables and increasingefficiencies to perhaps the maximum extent possible, then we also increase ourvulnerability in that regard as well. So, there are a number of reasons for tryingto do this (cutback CO2 emissions), but of course, this administration will notlast forever. That's something they also have to look forward to is whetherpeople think that their environmental policies are good ones or not.Could the global weather patterns get so bad that the earth itself, theatmosphere, could slow down the pace of industrial development?I don't think so. Bad is a value judgment. The weather patterns can changesomewhat and we might see more vigorous storms. And what happens if we haveanother Hurricane Andrew that causes tremendous amounts of damage. Thatheightens awareness for awhile. But I think the main thing that's really likely toput a stop to all of this would be a major war. And who knows? Maybe we'reheaded for one of those as well in India and Pakistan. That's the sort of thingthat could really make a difference.Heaven forbid!\"We b s it e :http://www.epa.gov/globalwarming/publications/car/index.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
