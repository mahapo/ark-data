Smith, Freedland Publishers Chapter 1, Part Two \"Dr. Urich, the county coroner, said:'The cutting (on the 1500-pound buffalo near NORAD)was done neatly, cleanly, obviously with a very sharp instrument.The dissection was of the type that would eliminate any type of predator.'He said the hide was removed by someone who did not puncturethe tissue layer directly under the hide. 'It was better than I coulddo if I were trying. It was really an expert job.'\"- The Colorado Springs Sun, October 23, 1975 elicopters have been reported acting suspiciously or even threateningly inranch areas. But no actual evidence of this or identification of the aircraft isavailable. Others feel that various factors such as noise, anger and expense ruleout the helicopter theory. Some of the beefs that have allegedly beentransported weigh half to three quarters of a ton or more, which would require avery large, noisy and expensive helicopter that requires specialized servicing. Inany case, the BLM (Bureau of Land Management) has canceled a helicoptersurvey of several rural counties because it could not guarantee the safety of theircrews from high flying lead (bullets). Interest in cattle mutilations, as might well be imagined, is not confined tolawmen. The following is a report from Steamboat, several hundred milesremoved from the Elbert County mutilation hot spot.Colorado U. S. Senator Floyd Haskell News Release, September 18, 1975 \"Routt County cattlemen were out in full force as several matters ofextreme importance were discussed at a special meeting last Friday night inthe District Courtroom. Sheriff Jay Kelton and Wildlife Conservationofficer, Joe Gerrans, along with two Colorado Cattlemen's Associationexecutive officers, addressed the group. CCA's executive secretaryexplained the legal ramifications of indiscriminate shooting at low flyingaircraft and warned the group against taking any action into their hands. \"Kelton told the group that the one positively identified case of cattlemutilation in Routt County did not follow the pattern that has beenreported in other counties. (FS Note: It was shot and the sex organs weren'tremoved.) Kelton was called out in the middle of the meeting to investigatea reported helicopter in the Twentymile area. Law officers found thesighting was, instead, a bright star shining through low-lying clouds in thatarea southwest of Steamboat Springs. \"State CCA officers told the cattlemen that there as yet has been no proofof helicopter involvement in any of the alleged cattle mutilations. The state"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"organization has posted a $5,000 reward for the apprehension andconviction of any cattle mutilator. In this area, the Routt cattleorganization has posted a $1,500 reward, and (the town) Sherrod hasoffered $1,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of thatperson responsible for the mutilation of his calf. \"The packed courtroom was alive with emotions and anger about whatseems to be a growing problem in the livestock industry in the RockyMountain states.\" Colorado's senior U. S. Senator, Floyd K. Haskell, has also been extremelyinterested in the phenomenon and has tried to get federal assistance. In hisSeptember 18, 1975 Haskell News Release, he said: \"I talked with FBI Director Clarence Kelley and also with his chiefassistant in Washington,\" Haskell said, \"and they looked into the possiblegrounds for the FBI to enter the case. But since there is no evidence ofinterstate movements in connection with the reported mutilations, the FBIconcluded that it has no jurisdiction.\" Unable to get FBI assistance, Haskell then asked the Interior Department tomake personal and other resources at its Denver Wildlife Research Centeravailable to help the Colorado Bureau of Investigation in its investigation ofcattle mutilation in Colorado. Haskell explained (his perspective) in a letter toInterior Secretary Thomas Kleppe, reprinted in Sen. Haskell's November 4, 1975News Release: \"A major hurdle in the investigation has been the lack of adequatemanpower to reach the cattle carcasses promptly and conduct thenecessary on-site tests to fully determine the cause of death, how themutilations were done and whether predators were involved. The ColoradoBureau of Investigation believes it would be extremely helpful to have thetechnical help and the specialized expertise at the center. \"Haskell told Kleppe that autopsies done at Colorado State Universityshow that sharp instruments were used on some of the carcasses, but thatother damage appears to have been done by predators. In cases in whichthe cause of death could be established, the CSU autopsies showed cattledied of natural causes. \"Upon Haskell's request, the Interior Department decided to make theDenver Wildlife Research Center available to investigate cattle mutilations.I (Haskell) hope we can determine what's behind the mutilations soon andlay to rest some of the bizarre rumors that are circulating.\" The question of possible UFO involvement has also called for radiationmonitoring. So far, no radioactivity above natural background has beenreported. Farmers and ranchers with many years of experience seeing sick, dyingand dead livestock, tend to be scornful of the idea that mutilated stock have diedof disease, accident, old age or other so-called natural causes. The Delta County Independent, Delta, Colorado, September 22, 1975 \"DENVER - Two Colorado legislators, concerned by the many conflictingreports being circulated with regard to the recent cattle mutilations, haveundertaken their own study of the facts involved. State Rep. C. B. 'Bev'Bledsoe of Hugo and State Sen. Ralph A. Cole of Littleton, bothRepublicans, said they have been working recently to compile establishedfacts regarding panic and the spread of unfounded rumors. \"Bledsoe, a cattleman himself said, 'Since much of the area involved lies inSen. Cole's district and mine, we decided that a simple compilation of theknown provable facts, scientifically gathered and considered in the light of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"existing laws, would be valuable to our constituents. Bledsoe representseight eastern Colorado counties and Cole five. \"In collecting their information, Bledsoe and Cole talked to area ranchers,citizens, sheriff's departments, other law enforcement agencies, and theColorado Bureau of Investigation, which is acting as a coordinating agencyin the investigation. \"According to Cole, 'The first question we asked was: Are there reallycattle mutilations?' The answer, unfortunately, was an unqualified, 'Yes.'Based on the scientific evaluation of the carcasses by veterinarians andanimal pathologists, it can be determined whether wounds are caused bypredators or by knives. A number of autopsies performed show woundsinflicted by knives. \"Bledsoe said that there have been 129 reported cases, but not all haveproven to be actual mutilations. A former president of the ColoradoCattlemen's Association, Bledsoe noted that of Colorado's approximatelythree million cattle, at least 30,000 could be expected to die of naturalcauses annually. \"'At this point,' Bledsoe said, 'there is no proof that any of these 129 headactually died of causes other than natural, so there is no real proof that themutilators kill the cattle involved. However, there are some drugs that willkill an animal within six minutes and be undetectable in the carcass 20minutes later,' he added, pointing out that it is difficult to determine if thecattle are mutilated immediately following death, or some time thereafter. \"Cole, an attorney, said that the possible penalties assessable in thissituation range from cruelty to animals to trespass to destruction ofproperty up to a Class Four felony for which the maximum is ten years inprison and a $30,000 fine. \"Cole pointed out that there has been much speculation that helicopterswere involved in the mutilations, with some of the reported cases showingevidence of helicopter use in the area. He noted, however, that helicopterpilots consider flying at night without lights in unfamiliar countryextremely dangerous and said that the authorities are certainly nohelicopters in Colorado are equipped with radar, other than those used bythe U. S. Army at Ft. Carson for sighting guns. \"'If an unmarked, unlit helicopter is apprehended,' Cole said, 'the pilot canonly be charged with relatively minor violations.' The two lawmakers saidthat the Colorado National Guard could be involved in the investigation toa slight degree, in that the Guard will report strange aircraft observed bymembers on their training flights. The Guard, like the Army, is prohibitedfrom other participation, although the Army can loan equipment for aerialreconnaissance of the area. \"'The mutilations started in Minnesota,' Bledsoe said, 'then spread toNebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, Wyomingand Montana. In the last five states listed, they are still going on, althoughthe pattern seems to indicate an abrupt ending, when they finally do stop.'\" Along with never having been surprised in the act, and not leaving any clueswhatever, perhaps the most amazing thing to ranchers and lawmen who examinethe carcasses is the beautiful precision with which the cuts have been made andthe skill with which the various organs are excised. \"Perfect\" is the only word toadequately describe the difficult skinning and surgery, which is alsounexplainably bloodless. Whoever sees the cuts knows that he could not evenbegin to do it that beautifully. Equally astonishing is what happens afterward.The Telluride Times, Telluride, Colorado, September 21, 1975"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\"Further adding to the mystery is the lack of rigor mortis in the deadanimals. According to one sheriff's office spokesperson, cattle that hadbeen dead for five days 'were as limber as you and I.' Rigor mortis normallysets in one hour after death. \"Equally as cryptic as the lack of rigor mortis is that none of the cattle havebeen picked apart by animals or birds in the days after their speculateddeaths. 'Nothing will eat them,' Ellis said (Gunnison Deputy Sheriff DavidEllis). 'We don't have any idea why (predators don't eat them). 'Not evenmaggots have appeared on the dead animals,' another sheriff's spokespersonsaid.\" The same phenomenon has been observed in other states where cattle have beenmutilated. Jim Hileman, sheriff of Adams County, Idaho, a rugged logginglivestock country in west-central Idaho bordering on Oregon and the famousHell's Canyon area, said, \"I've made it a point to go out personally on all thesecases.\" His report of the parts cut off the animals, including \"the complete rectalarea,\" tongues and udders, parallels the reports of Colorado sheriffs. Hileman said he was \"reluctant for some time\" to ascribe the killings to devilworshipers or cultists. But after seeing the mutilated animals himself andconferring \"with anybody that had information\" on the subject, he decided, \"ByGod, that's what's happening.\" The Denver Post, Denver, Colorado, July 11, 1975\"Hileman's county has a heavy bear population, and bears are notorious forfeeding on carcasses, especially ripe ones. But, says Hileman, bears haveshunned the mutilated carcasses. 'Our last case was a big cow a ripecarcass,' he said, 'and it was an odd thing. The sign showed a bear had beenup to her and turned her over, trying to check her out, then left her.'\"In his contacts with other officers who have had the same problem, hesaid he has learned of a similar case in Custer County, Idaho, about a yearago and a few recent ones in Montana and Wyoming, besides those inColorado. 'I've been around livestock all my life,' he said, 'and I've neverseen anything like this.'\" These are the primary facts surrounding the cattle mutilation phenomenon.What do they add up to? In spite of the unprecedented interest, curiosity,astonishment, indignation and detective work that's gone into clearing up thismystery, so far there hasn't been one solid bit of evidence or plausible theory, asfar as is publicly known, about who is doing this, or how, or why.
