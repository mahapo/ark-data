The stone circle is associated with a series offlat, carved stone structures, six lines of standing and toppled megaliths and two"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"buried megalithic sculptures in southern Egypt's Nabta Playa 100 kilometers (62miles) west of Abu Simbel. Radiocarbon dating indicated the structures were in4,500 B. C. sedimentary layers, at least a thousand years older than Stonehengein England. Nabta Playa is rich in prehistoric remains of the early Holocene agewhen there was rain and a lake, but no skeletal human remains have ever beenfound.The 12-foot-diameter stone circle contains four upright slabs shown above.Two sets of stones were aligned in a north-south direction, while the second pair ofslabs provides a line of sight toward the summer solstice horizon.

Brophy, Ph.D.Professor Wendorf and his astronomer colleague, Professor J. McKim Malville,reported that. \"Five megalithic alignments at Nabta radiate outward from acentral collection of megalithic structures. Beneath one structure was asculptured rock\" several feet down in the sand. Their speculation was that theNabta site was used for astronomical alignments.Many of the megaliths on the playa surface at Nabta were shaped or sculptedby the ancient megalithic builders. A good example is the curved and flat-ended stoneabove."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Photograph © by Juergen Kroenig.The Nabta discoverers also reported. \"The vertical sighting stones in the stonecircle correspond to the zenith sun during the summer solstice. An east-westalignment also is present between one megalithic structure and two stonemegaliths about a mile distant. There also are two other geometric linesinvolving about a dozen additional stone monuments that lead both northeastand southeast from the same megalith. We still don't understand the significanceof these lines,\" Dr. Malville said.The megalith alignments radiate out from one central point of at least thirtymegaliths that the scientists called a \"complex structure.\" The central megalithwas dubbed, \"Complex Structure A.\" To everyone's surprise, the surfaceComplex Structure megaliths marked a sculpture carved below at bedrock about12 feet below the surface sand.A California physicist now thinks he has some answers about the purposes of theNabta lines and megaliths and has written a new book entitled: \"The OriginMap: Discovery of a Prehistoric, Megalithic, Astrophysical Map andSculpture of the Universe.\" As the title implies, Dr. Brophy hypothesizes afterextensive measuring and calculations of star alignments that existed 6,500 to8,500 years ago, that the surface Nabta stones are a detailed calendar andastrophysical map that tracked the constellation Orion and its belt stars withastonishing accuracy. Further, Dr. Brophy thinks the Nabta megaliths couldmark the apparent motion of our Milky Way's galactic center every 25,900 years.Even more astounding, Dr. Brophy hypothesizes that the carved bedrock buriedbeneath the Nabta sand is an image of the Milky Way Galaxy as seen from agalactic pole position about 19,000 years ago.Essentially, that would be the outside of the galaxy away from earth, a cosmicperspective that humans have never had, except for modern astronomicalcalculations. If Dr. Brophy's conclusions are correct, the implication is that anintelligence sophisticated in astronomy was operating on earth long before theearliest known Mesopotamian civilizations.Interview:Thomas Brophy, Ph.D., Physicist, Educational Management ConsultingServices (EMCS), and Author, The Origin Map: Discovery of a Prehistoric,Megalithic, Astrophysical Map and Sculpture of the Universe, Encinitas,California: \"The calendar circle which models the Orion Stars is north of thecentral point from which the megaliths radiate, but it is essentially in the samecomplex of structures. So, the calendar circle is up there in the north and about1000 meters south is the central complex structure. From there are the 1000meter alignments to other megaliths which point to the stars.It's the calendar circle that I analyzed first and found the diagram of Orion's beltstars and head and shoulder stars."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Above, Dr. Brophy finds a matching line upin the Nabta stone circle with the Orion constellation's belt starsat the summer solstice sunrise of 4,940 B. C. Drawings © 2002 by Thomas G. Brophy.Above, going backwards in time to 16,500 B.C., both Orion's \"feet\"are on the Nabta circle with the left foot on the edge of the meridian window and hisup-stretched hand is on the stone circle as well, drawn by Dr. Brophy based on computerprojections. In his book, Dr. Brophy asked, \"How could 5,000 B. C. Neolithic wanderingastronomers have possibly figured out such a calendar without a computer toprecess the stars back to 16,500 B. C.?\"WOULD THAT TIE THE NABTA CALENDAR CIRCLE TO THE KHUFUPYRAMID WHICH ALSO ORIENTS TO THE ORION BELT STARS?It's logical to think that if there was such an importance to diagram the Orionbelt stars and if the Giza also monumentalized the Orion belt stars, it wouldmake sense there was some link, even though the Nabta site is much older.WHY IS IT THAT THE EGYPTIAN CIVILIZATION WHOEVER WAS THERE IN A PERIOD 13,000 YEARS AGO UP TO SAY 2 OR 3 THOUSAND YEARSAGO WHY WERE THEY SO OBSESSED WITH THE ORION BELT STARS?Yes, that's a good question. I don't really know. My approach is to really hithard and try to understand the astronomy first. Do that in an unbiased way andnot be thinking along the way, 'Well, this site is so old they couldn't have knownastronomy so well.' Just to see astronomically what these structures might mean.That's where I'm at. So, I don't have the answers to WHY they held Orion's beltso prominent.You can speculate on a few things: if they monumentalized the galactic center,Orion's belt happens to be in such a place in the sky that when it's at its southern"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"culmination due to the precession of the equinox, the galactic center is at itsnorthern galactic culmination. So, that could be one reason why they had thiscoherent meaning for our situation in the galaxy and the apparent motion of thecenter of the galaxy in the sky.IT COULD ALSO IMPLY THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THEORION CONSTELLATION AND THOSE BELT STARS THAT MIGHTRELATE TO THE INTELLIGENCE THAT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALLTHIS MATHEMATICAL ORIENTATION IN STONE ON THE EARTH IN THEFIRST PLACE.That's another possibility yes. Especially because the same stars seem moreextensively marked at the Nabta Playa site by the long baseline megaliths as wellin a very astoundingly sophisticated way.IN AS SIMPLE LANGUAGE AS YOU CAN DESCRIBE TO A LAY PERSON,WHAT IS IT THAT IS SO ASTOUNDING TO YOU?The same fixed stars that are diagramed in the calendar circle seem to be markedprecisely by the long baseline large stone markers nearby that radiate out fromthat central complex structure. They seem to be marked in a way that can markthem very accurately by doing it specifically when they had their vernal equinoxhelical rising, when they rose geometrically with the sun on the first day ofspring, which only happens once during the precession of the 25,900 yearequinox cycle.So, they did that for all six of the stars and that's a way of marking themprecisely because it marks them in two dimensions, not just the declination butalso the right ascension.YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY HAVING THE SOPHISTICATIONAND ASTRONOMICAL ELEGANCE TO DO THAT ON THE NABTA PLAYAAT LEAST 7,000 YEARS AGO?Yes, that's what I am finding.IN ADDITION TO THIS VERY PRECISE AND EXTRAORDINARYALIGNMENT IN THAT STONE CALENDAR WITH ORION AND THE BELTSTARS, IN THAT OTHER LOCATION BURIED UNDERNEATH THEGROUND, THERE WAS THE FINDING BY THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS OF ACARVED STONE THAT YOU RELATE DIRECTLY TO THE GALACTICCENTER.Figure 17, Page 52, Dr. Brophy's book, based on original drawing by R.

Dr. Brophy overlaid thetitles and arrowsafter his calculations of what astronomical bodies might line up with the carved features onthe rock at thevernal equinox heliacal rising 17,400 B.C.

Compare to moderncomputer-generatedMilky Way Galaxy below, as would be seen from a galactic pole.Electronic Sky drawing is based on astrophysical data in which the imageis flipped so that it is viewed from the galactic south pole.Titles superimposed by Thomas Brophy.Dr. Brophy: \"Yes. There seems to be a coherent complex of meanings that gothrough the whole Nabta Playa site. The bottom sculpture on the bedrock seemsastoundingly similar to a map of our Milky Way Galaxy and the stone thatmarked the central radiating point for all the other alignments was situated insuch a place above this sculpture that it would be consistent with marking whereour sun is known to be in our Milky Way galaxy.IF I UNDERSTAND, IT ALSO SEEMS TO BE FROM A POINT OF VIEW ASIF YOU WERE LOOKING AT OUR ENTIRE GALAXY FROM THEPOSITION OUT IN THE HUGE COSMOS.Yes, the orientation would be if you are looking down on the sculpture whatastronomers call looking from the galactic pole.NO HUMAN HAS EVER HAD SUCH A PERSPECTIVE. NOT ON THISPLANET.No, that's correct. That's correct. But we modern astronomers know what itwould look like from our study of the Milky Way and the star distributions andstar densities and all that.BUT THIS IS THE YEAR 2002, ABOUT TO GO INTO 2003 AND WE'RETALKING ABOUT SOMETHING 7,000 TO 19,000 YEARS AGO AND ITCOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A NEANDERTHAL OR PREHISTORIC BEING.IT HAD TO BE INTELLIGENCE BY SOMETHING ELSE THAT WASHIGHLY SOPHISTICATED.Yes. This sculpture on the bedrock at Nabta Playa is quite mysterious. Thearchaeologists who excavated it, they hypothesized in their book that came outrecently that the way it was constructed was that Neolithic humans somewherearound 5,000 B. C. were at the site. Now, at that time there is this 10 feet ofsediments and they somehow they knew there was a lumpy stone on the bedrock10 feet down and they dug down. This is a large, more than 2 meter diameterrock they dug down, according to the archaeologists, and then uncovered thislumpy stone and sculpted it more, shaped it. Then filled the sand back in, and in"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"the process, also sculpted this other geometric form and set that in there andfilled it all back in and covered the top with these megaliths. That's theirhypothesis as to how this was constructed.IF IT MATCHES WHAT YOU HAVE DRAWN IN YOUR BOOK, HOWCOULD THAT KNOWLEDGE POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN ACCESSIBLE TOMINDS OF THE EGYPTIANS 7,000 YEARS AGO?Yes. My hypothesis of the meaning of that sculpture as being a model of theMilky Way galaxy is a new finding that I set forth based on the astronomicalstudy I did. It's not considered yet by the archaeologists who discovered the site.They note that it might have astronomical meaning, but so far had notconsidered or found what the astronomical meaning of that sculpture could be.HAVE YOU RUN YOUR HYPOTHESIS BY OTHER ASTRONOMERS ANDHAD THEM LOOK AT PHOTOGRAPHS OF THIS SCULPTED GALACTICCENTER THAT YOU HYPOTHESIZE TO SEE IF THEY INTERPRET THESAME MATHEMATICAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT YOU HAVE?Yes, a couple. The response tends to be astonishment. I haven't had anybodytake the time yet to reproduce all the calculations. It's a little bit complicated tocalculate the exact locations of stars at that time because our standard programsonly go back to 4,700 B. C. because of the Julian dating method. It's just anartifact of the way astronomers count years. So, you have to reproduce theformula for calculating star locations.Yes, it needs more people to try to reproduce the calculations to make sure.IF IT IS. IF THAT ROCK THAT IS SEVERAL FEET DOWN BELOW THESURFACE OF THE NABTA PLAYA DESE RT IS TRULY A SCULPTURE OFOUR GALACTIC CENTER SEEN FROM A SOUTHERN POINT OF VIEW, IWOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE REVOLUTIONARY BOTHARCHAEOLOGICALLY AND ASTRONOMICALLY.Yes. It's really quite astounding. It still astounds me. I just report what I seewhen I see that sculpture and calculate where the galactic center was at the time.It follows the same system as the surface megalithic alignments, the vernalequinox helical rising, or the orientation of the galactic center at its own vernalequinox helical rising. So, it fits in several ways into this system of the way theNabta Playa alignments were designed.WHY IS KEEPING TRACK OF THE GALACTIC CENTER SO IMPORTANT?Well, I think that's the $64 million question. And we can hypothesize on variouspossibilities, but I think it could be an important question. That's why Ipublished this before taking the time that might have taken years to get otherastronomers to reproduce all the calculations and go through all the reviewprocesses and all that.I think it could be well an important question.The Nabta Playa site seems to be very old. Like I said, the archaeologistshypothesized it was Neolithics who dug down and then refilled it back in. But ifthese bedrock sculptures Occam's razor might not go with the archaeologistdescription. It might go with that the bedrock sculptures might even be older.They might have been sculpted BEFORE the sediments were laid down andtherefore, older than 10,000 to 12,000 B. C. If that is the case, these structuresare older than the other key megalithic structures that we know about likeStonehenge. They are much, much older.JOHN ANTHONY WEST THINKS THAT THE SPHINX MIGHT BEACTUALLY 36,000 YEARS OLD.Yes. That is another the Sphinx might be another very old distant prehistoricobject. It might be a similar time frame of the oldest part of the Nabta Playa.IN FACT, THE FIRST ESTIMATE FROM DR. SCHOCH WAS THAT THE"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"WATER EROSION ON THE SPHINX, HE THINKS, IS GOING BACK TOABOUT 11,000 YEARS AGO WHICH WOULD BE IN THAT SAME PERIODYOU HAVE TALKED ABOUT IN NABTA BETWEEN 7,000 AND 13,000YEARS AGO.SOMETHING MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IN THAT PERIOD WHEN THEEARTH WAS COMING OUT OF THE ICE AGE?Certainly that period would have had a large impact on human societies andwhat they were doing. Robert Schoch wrote a foreword to my book and JohnWest wrote an afterword. So, we are certainly thinking along these lines that thismay be another sculpture, megalithic construction, that is very ancient like theSphinx.AND PERHAPS RELATED MATHEMATICALLY AND ASTRONOMICALLYTO THE SPHINX AND WHERE THE PYRAMIDS WERE BUILT ON GIZA?Yes. If these galactic center meanings hold up in both sites, then that wouldindicate a common cultural source of whoever designed them.\"More Information:Book: The Origin Map: Discovery of A Prehistoric, Megalithic, AstrophysicalMap and Sculpture of the Universe © 2002 by Thomas G.
