Kilimanjaro, Tanzania,is Africa's highest mountain at 19,340 feet.\"Between 1912 and 2000, Mt. Kilimanjarohas lost 80 percent of the ice area on the mountain.\"- Lonnie Thompson, Ph.D., Geologist, Ohio State UniversityThis map by Ohio State University researchers shows the retreat ofMt. Kilimanjaro's ice cap between 1912 and 2000, an 80 percent reduction.October 21, 2002 Columbus, Ohio - The prestigious journal, Science,published \"African Ice Core Analysis Reveals Catastrophic Droughts, ShrinkingIce Fields and Civilization Shifts\" in its October 18, 2002 issue. A scientificexpedition in 2000 extracted six ice cores from the 19,000 foot summit ofAfrica's Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania. The mountain is legendary for its snowcap and draws hundreds of tourists each year. But according to the latestanalysis of the ice, in combination with satellite and aerial maps, Ohio StateUniversity's distinguished geologist (See More Information), Lonnie Thompson,reports that Mt. Kilimanjaro has been losing ice at the rate of a half-meter eachyear since 1962. Today in 2002, only 20% of the ice that was there at thebeginning of the 20th century is left. If global warming temperatures continue to"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"increase each year, all the great mountain's ice could be gone in ten to fifteenyears.A 12-meter-high remnant of ice is all that's left in one of the ice fields onAfrica's highest ice-capped mountain, Kilimanjaro, in Tanzania.

Photograph by Lonnie Thompson, Ph.D.In addition to the rapid melt down, the ice core studies reveal that the tropicallatitudes suffered three catastrophic droughts 8,300 years ago, 5,200 years ago,and 4,000 years ago. That last drought, according to the ice, was so severe itlasted for 300 years. In fact, historical records about the Egyptian empire at thattime indicate drought and food production challenged the rule of the Pharaohsand provoked people to move away from the overwhelming dryness of theSahara Desert into village groups close to precious waterIn the Science article, Dr. Thompson said, \"Whatever happened to cause thesedramatic climate changes in the past could certainly occur again. But today, 70percent of the world's population lives in the tropics. They would bedramatically affected by events of this magnitude. We have to find out whatcauses them to happen.\"I asked Dr. Thompson to summarize his research not only on Mt. Kilimanjaro,but in other tropical latitude glaciers such as Peru where ice is disappearing evenfaster than in Africa.Interview:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Ohio State University geology professor Lonnie Thompson, left,and research associate, Mary Davis, examine one of six icecores drilled during 2000 Mt. Kilimanjaro expedition.Lonnie Thompson, Ph.D., Professor of Geology, Dept. of GeologicalSciences and Research Scientist, Byrd Polar Research Center, Ohio StateUniversity, Columbus, Ohio: \"From the ice cores that we recovered in the year2000, we now know ice has been there for 11,700 years. With that, we alsoknow that through the maps and photographs that have been taken on themountain the first map being made in 1912 and the last map (ours) producedfrom photographs we had flown on Feb. 16 of 2000 - we know the ice fieldshave shrunk from covering an area of 12.1 square kilometers in 1912 tosomething less than 2.6 square kilometers in the year 2000. So, between 1912and 2000, Mt. Kilimanjaro has lost 80% of the ice area on the mountain.WHEN WILL IT ALL BE GONE?We have five maps that have been produced, including the 1912 and the 2000.And if you look at the decrease in ice area over that time and you just connectthe dots and project into the future, those ice fields will disappear sometimearound 2015, if conditions stay the same as they have been since 1912. And thatdoesn't call for global warming or any change. Just if they remain the same.The dark speck atop the glacier is the geodesic dome ice drill labDr. Thompson and his team worked in on Mt. Kilimajaro's remaining glacial ice in 2000.The ice core dated back to 11,700 years ago.

GIVENGLOBAL WARMING, HAVE YOU DONE A PROJECTION TO SEE IF ALLOF THE SNOW CAP ON MT. KILIMANJARO COULD BE GONE BEFORE2015?I would think that is certainly a possibility. We have been monitoring glaciersthroughout the tropics, some at lower elevations, such as in the Andes of Peruwhere we have monitored an acceleration in the rate of retreat of those icefields. Just to give you an example, the Qori Kalis glacier which is the largest"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"outlet glacier from the largest tropical ice cap on the earth - in Peru's Quelccayaice cap, Southern Andes.In the first period of measurements for those ice fields and that glacier, it wasdetermined that they were retreating between 1963 and 1978 at a rate of 4.7meters/year.Out latest map was made for the retreat from 2000 to 2001, and that is now upto 205 meters/year, which is an increase of over 40 times the rate of retreat inour initial period of measurement. Qori Kalis glacier in Peru's Quelccaya ice cap, Southern Andes.Image on top, 1978. Image below taken in August 2002, shows lake exceeding10 acres from ice melt. Ice now retreating at 205 meters per year, an increaseof over 40 times the rate of retreat first documented in 1963. Photographsin 1978 and 2002 by Lonnie Thompson, Ph.D.FORTY TIMES!Forty times. It's exponential in the rate of reduction.Now the reason we think that one is retreating so much faster is it's lower in theearth's atmosphere. It's 5, 670 meters above sea level (18,602 feet), whereasKilimanjaro is 5,895 meters (19,340 feet). But as temperatures warm, we wouldexpect to see the lower elevation glaciers disappear first. But it's quite likely thatif the earth continues to warm as is predicted, then we will see an acceleration inthe rate of decrease of ice on Kilimanjaro.AS OF SEPTEMBER, NOAA HAS DATA THAT 2002 IS THE SECONDWARMEST YEAR ON RECORD, EXCEEDED ONLY BY 1998. THERE ISSOME SPECULATION THAT BY DECEMBER 31ST, THIS COULD BE THEWARMEST YEAR ON RECORD, EXCEEDING 1998. THAT REINFORCES ATREND IN WHICH EACH YEAR THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR IT TOBE WARMER THAN THE YEAR BEFORE. I WOULD ASSUME THAT THISKIND OF GLOBAL PRESSURE ON RAISING TEMPERATURES IS GOINGTO ACCELERATE WHATEVER MODELS YOU HAVE FOR GLACIALMELT?I think that is exactly correct. In fact, we do have a satellite-linked weatherstation with our colleagues at the Univ. of Massachusetts on the northern icefield of Kilimanjaro. Since we drilled there in the year 2000, temperatures haveincreased over the past 2.5 years by 1 degree Centigrade. If that trend continues,we would expect that for ice throughout the tropics, the rate of loss willaccelerate."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Small remnant of rapidly melting glacial ice surrounded by soil on Mt. Kilimanjaro.Photograph in 2000 by Lonnie Thompson, Ph.D.DOES THIS RAPIDITY OF MELT SURPRISE YOU?It does. I think anyone who goes out in the field we just returned from theQuelccaya ice cap down in the Andes. I've watched what's happened with thatice field since 1974. And the rate at which the ice is being lost is astonishing.The thing that I think makes it even more important to take notice of is the factthat these glaciers are in the tropics, the area of the earth where the climate isknown for its stability. The temperatures between winter and summer, wetseason and dry season in tropics, it changes only one degree Centigrade. And yetevery tropical glacier on the planet is retreating and where we have these timelapse data, many of them show this marked acceleration in the rate of retreat.WHEN GLACIERS DISAPPEAR, ISN'T THAT ALSO JEOPARDIZINGHUMAN AND ANIMAL WATER SUPPLIES?Absolutely. The glaciers you can think of them as the earth's water towers. Theystore the water that comes in the wet season, or the cold season, and they meltin the warm or dry season. So, they kind of maintain water flow in the rivers thathave their origins at the base of these ice fields. So, the loss of ice is like tappinga bank account that has built over thousands of years and not replenishing it. Itaffects hydropower electric production downstream, it impacts irrigation forcrops, it impacts water supplies for municipalities that depend on water in thoserivers.So, it certainly has an impact on the people in those areas. It's already impactingthose people, whether you're in the Himalayas or in the Andes of Peru or at thebase of Kilimanjaro in Africa. As a scientist, the thing that really concerns usthat we are also losing an important archive of the earth's past history that ispreserved in the layers in those ice fields.IF THE MT. KILIMANJARO ICE DATES TO 11,700 YEARS AGO ANDTHAT WOULD BE WHAT WE GENERALLY SAY IS THE TRANSITIONOUT OF AN ICE AGE INTO A WARMING TREND GLOBALLY. IS THATCORRECT?That's correct.DO WE KNOW HOW LONG THAT ICE AGE LASTED?We know the previous cold period for the earth lasted about 90,000 years. Butthe ice that's grown on Mt. Kilimanjaro is a function of the increased water inthat part of the world that came with the Holocene warming. If you go back12,000 to 12,500 years ago, you could have walked across Lake Victoria. It wasdry. There was no water there. With no water, there can be no ice. As we'vemoved through the Holocene, those glaciers formed in that early African humidperiod and it's always amazing to me when we look at the natural changes thathave occurred in the climate in the past. In Africa, for example, Lake Chadwhich now covers 17,000 square kilometers back 9,500 years ago when theseglaciers were growing on Mt. Kilimanjaro, they covered over 35,000 squarekilometers. It was bigger than the Caspian Sea."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"So, there have been tremendous natural changes in the earth's climate as we'vegone through the last 10,000 years in the tropics.The lower portion of the outer margin of Kilimanjaro's northernice field shows the stratigraphic record of ancient climate trapped in the icedating back 11,700 years ago. Photograph in 2000 by Lonnie Thompson, Ph.D.I think the thing that really makes today's world different is that we've never had6.2 billion people living on the planet depending on the climate of the earth.And we've never occupied so much of the surface area of the planet so that ifyou had either climate change from natural or human-derived climate change,our options become less clear.DO WE KNOW WHEN THE LAST PERIOD ON THE EARTH WAS WHERETHERE WAS NO ICE AT THE NORTH POLE, ANTARCTICA OR ANY OFTHE MOUNTAINS AROUND THE WORLD?You have to go back a fairly long period. If you go back to the Cretaceus whenwe had dinosaurs on the planet, the planet was much warmer. There is noevidence of ice on the planet. It's also quite clear from evidence from that periodof time, the CO2 levels in the earth's atmosphere were much higher.I think another thing that really distinguishes the time we live in is that the CO2level in our atmosphere have never been as high as they are today for over thelast 420,000 years of record that we have of CO2 concentration from the airbubbles in ice cores from Antarctica. So, they've never been as high as they aretoday when we have so much ice still on the land. Of course, one of theconcerns is that with the melting of the ice, the water ultimately makes its wayinto the oceans and contributes to sea level rise.RIGHT. AND IF WE TALK ABOUT THERE BEING NOTHING OF APRECEDENT TO WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IN TERMS OF RATE OFWARMING SINCE THE DINOSAUR TIME MEANING WE'RE HEADINGTOWARD THERE NOT BEING ICE IN A LOT OF GLACIERS AROUNDTHE WORLD AND WE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE DINOSAURTIME THAT WOULD BE BETWEEN 65 MILLION AND 270 MILLIONYEARS AGO.Well, that was a long time ago. Of course, we don't know, we don't understandthe climate system well enough today to know what the future holds. What'sgoing to happen to the larger ice fields of Greenland and Antarctica as theclimate changes. So, we still have a lot to learn about how the system works.It's just that today the message is very clear from the glaciers, at least, and fromother lines of evidence that the earth is getting warmer and there is anacceleration in the rate of warming.SO I AM CLEAR, THERE HAS NOT BEEN THE AMOUNT OF CO2BLANKET SURROUNDING THE EARTH AS THERE IS TODAY SINCETHE TIME OF THE DINOSAURS?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"We don't know that. The longest continuous record of CO2 and the best recordrecorder of greenhouse gases in general on the planet comes from the airbubbles trapped in ice. And we have a record from Vostok in Antarctica thatgoes back 420,000 years. Now, that record is going to be extended here soon, sowe'll have a bigger perspective. Plan to Drill Deeper Ice Cores in AntarcticaMEANING THAT YOU'RE DRILLING DEEPER?Yes. There is a longer record coming out probably in the next year. But over420,000 years where we do have records of greenhouse gases and methane theyhave never been over 300 parts per million by volume. We crossed that in 1900.We're now at 370 ppm by volume and it's increasing by 1.2 to 1.5 ppm byvolume every year due to human activities.ONCE YOU HAVE GOTTEN THIS DEEPER CORE, IT MIGHT GO BACKTO THE 65 MILLION YEARS AGO TOWARD THE END OF THEDINOSAURS?Not likely. It won't go back that far. But it may double, we might be able to goback a million years. It's so important to understanding the relevant significanceof the modern change we're seeing today by putting that change into the longperspective of earth's history.IF THERE IS NO PRECEDENT IN THE NEW ICE CORE, THEN WE ARETRULY LIVING INSIDE THE WARMEST TREND GOING BACK PERHAPSA MILLION YEARS WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THE CONSEQUENCESWILL BE?Therein is the real uncertainty. It is what we don't know about the climatesystem. Certainly our records from the ice cores and other paleo-climate recordsshow the system is capable of very abrupt changes due to natural forces. Then,along comes the human race and we're now a factor in the climate on the planet.Issues like if you can have natural variability in the system occurring overdecades, then we can certainly have it tells us that the climate system is verysensitive and we should be very careful not to push it over thresholds. Becausethe changes can be and have been very rapid in the past.COULD IT GO EITHER WAY? ARE WE TAMPERING WITH THEPOSSIBILITY THAT NOT ONLY COULD WE THROW THE PLANET INTOHORRIBLE DROUGHT AND LACK OF FOOD IN WAYS NEVEREXPERIENCED IN CURRENT 5,000 YEAR CIVILIZATION? OR COULDTHIS ALSO TRIGGER ANOTHER ICE AGE WHICH COULD BE AS BADOR WORSE?All the evidence point to warming and until that trend changes, I think we arelooking more to living in a world that could be quite different and much warmer.Perhaps there will be more extremes in climate. But one thing is for sure. We aregoing to lose the ice fields on Kilimanjaro.Even if we were prudent and we decided to limit CO2, or even stop CO2emissions to the atmosphere tomorrow, this gas has a residence time of over 100years in the earth's atmosphere. It's almost a certainty we will lose the ice fieldson Kilimanjaro.PROBABLY ALSO IN PERU AND THE ANDES?I think that's what all the evidence points to.WHAT HAPPENS WHEN SO MANY GLACIERS ARE GONE?The impacts will come through water resources, stream flow that you see in thewet season, much more, and much less in the dry season. On Kilimanjaro, one of"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the big issues for the people there is this is the number one foreign currencyearner for the Tanzanian government.MEANING TOURISM?Tourism. It has its own international airport. The question that needs to be askedis: how many tourists will come if there is no ice on Kilimanjaro. You have thosetypes of impact in addition to water shortages.In Peru where the ice fields are retreating in an exponentially increasing fashion,there are issues of hydroelectric power production. You know, plants that are at100% capacity in the wet season, like the Rio Santa power plant, drops to 20%of production in the dry season. In order to make up for power loss, thegovernment. is forced to build fuel burning power plants. So, the impact onpeople are already being felt in areas where these glaciers are disappearing.WHAT ABOUT SCARCITY OF WATER IN THOSE AREAS?Very big issue. You look at cities like Lima, Peru, the capital of Peru. 55% of thepopulation of Peru, some 8 million people, live in this city in the desert. It hasone river, the Rimac, that has its source in the Andes Mountains. So, watersupplies become extremely important in these areas.In the 21st Century, certainly water resources are going to be number onepriority. People, animals, we have to have it. And if you don't have it where youlive, then you have to move to where it exists. That's the bottom line. So manyof the big rivers in the world the Yangtse, the Yellow River, those in India havetheir sources in the mountains and from glaciers. So, the loss of this ice waterresource is significant. Himalayas Are Melting, TooIS THE SAME THING HAPPENING IN THE HIMALAYAS?Yes. This is one of the areas where we work. The glaciers are retreating. Thereare lakes forming on them. There is on a global scale only one place where wehave documented growth of glaciers in today's climate and that is in Norway andSweden. The reason those glaciers are growing is that the storms that used tobring the snows to the Alps and the glaciers in the Alps have been deflectedfurther north, so they get more snow in the winter. The temperatures in Norwayand Sweden have actually increased. there is more precipitation, but in the shortterm, those glaciers are growing.COULD THERE BE A TIME IN THE FUTURE WHEN MT. EVERESTWOULD NOT HAVE ANY SNOW?That's difficult to say. It would have to be extremely warm. But I think longbefore that would happen, we would have a lot more serious problems of simplysurviving.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"One of the last remnants of Kilimanjaro's Eastern ice fieldis a six-meter spire that was much larger on previous expeditions.
