Atleast 35 genera of animals in North America alone were wiped out, including thehuge saber-toothed cat, woolly rhinos, woolly mammoths, mastodons, giantskunks, giant rabbits, camels and horses. Using modern DNA analysis, bodiesand bones found freeze-dried are being explored for signs of unusual disease.Did a deadly virus or bacteria infect and kill the animals? Or did a growinghuman population throughout the world exterminate species after species in itssearch for food and hides? The giant Irish elk on the left and the woolly mammoth on the right did not survive the endof the ice age.One anthropologist who does not think either disease or humans are responsiblefor the extinctions is Dr. Donald Grayson, Professor of Anthropology, Universityof Washington in Seattle. He thinks it was global climate change, specificallyrapid warming, that caused some kind of wide scale trauma that certain animaland plant species could not survive. If global climate change, why did an animal"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"like the woolly mammoth, that had lived for hundreds of thousands of yearsthrough previous climate changes, suddenly die out? Why did so many othersmaller animals prevail? What exactly happened to end the ice age and begin thewarming trend that has lasted for 12,000 years and is now accelerating under theinfluence of human civilization's greenhouse gas emissions? Just how vulnerableto extinction is earth life when this planet undergoes rapid climate change?Interview:Donald Grayson, Ph.D., Prof. of Anthropology, Univ. of Washington,Seattle, Washington: \"If you look at the radiocarbon dates we have for theextinctions, we can show that only about 15 of 35 extinct species even survivedafter 12,000 years ago. The rest were completely gone before the 12,000 yearmark.Also, if you look at the radiocarbon record for extinctions in Europe, it turnsout that different animals became extinct towards the end of the ice age atdifferent times and in different places. It could well be exactly the same thingwas happening in North America. In other words, not all these extinctionshappened all at once. If that's the case, then the kinds of explanations that weneed to look at are going to be quite different. In fact, one of the amazing thingsabout this big debate over the extinctions is that people have chosen theirexplanations based on the assumption that there was a major wave of extinctionsat 11,000. But that wave, while it may have occurred, has never definitivelybeen demonstrated to actually have existed.Is there anything in the physical evidence, whether it's in permafrost or icein which these animals have been found preserved, that would give insightabout what might have happened if there was some sudden event thatcaused the devastation of several species?There are 3 major causes that are being debated for these extinctions in NorthAmerica and some of these causes are also looked at in Old World Europe aswell.1) climate change;2) advent of human hunters in North America around 11,500 years ago, arguedby David Meltzer, Southern Methodist University;3) spread of a virulent disease. That last one is a relatively new hypothesisproposed by Roth MacPhee, American Museum of Natural History.The well-preserved remains of now-extinct mammals that are now available canbe used to test probably any of these hypotheses.If disease of some unusual nature is not found, then could climate volatilityhave caused the destruction of so many animals? And if so, could it happennow when we are challenged by global warming and its futureconsequences?You bet. If you look around the landscape today and see populations of animalsgoing extinct, it is hard today to be able to specify exactly what aspects ofchange in their environment drove those extinctions. That means that if it wasclimate at the end of the Pleistocene that caused these extinctions, it can be verydifficult to determine precisely what aspects of climate change it was. And wealso know, and this has become very obvious in the last 15 to 20 years, thatdifferent animals respond to climate change in different ways. That means that ifwe are going to figure out what aspects of climate caused these extinctions, thenwe need to look at the animals one at a time.For an example of wide variations in the time line of extinctions, there is a smallrabbit from the southern parts of North America. Paul Martin, argues that thesmall rabbit was driven to death by human hunters around 11,000 years ago.But we can't even show that this animal survived the late glacial maximum18,000 to 22,000 years ago! So, there are a lot of chronological mysteries hereas well. I think it is a mistake to assume that everything did go extinct at around"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"11,000. But even if it did, 11,000 years ago was a time of major climate change.You see extinctions not only in North America, that people have been blamedfor, but also in Europe where people have never been blamed for it.A huge animal called the Irish Elk went extinct in Ireland at about the same timeas the North American extinctions happened, even though in Ireland there wereno people at all. So, whether there were people present or not as with the IrishElk or whether people had been preying on an animal for tens of thousands ofyears like reindeer in southern France these extinctions occurred.What you are implying is that something about 12,000 years ago didhappen that affected the planet's Northern Hemisphere. Why do you thinkthe climate's warming could have caused the disappearance of so manydifferent species throughout North America?I have no idea. There have been a number of arguments made and none seem toexplain not only the extinctions in North America, but also the roughlycontemporary extinctions in the Old World. And there were also extinctions inSouth America and Australia. The extinctions in Australia seemed to be 15,000to 20,000 years earlier. Some are now arguing that the Australian extinctionsmay have occurred as early as 46,000 years ago.So, there are mysteries all over the place! None of these things have been wellexplained.There were 35 genera of animals that went extinct in North America, but therewere also lots of things that survived as well. Reindeer survived. Musk oxsurvived. Elk survived. Bisons survived. Lots and lots of small animals survived.Only one kind of tree is known to have gone extinct. So, lots and lots of thingssurvived. The extinction event, if we can call it an event, was selective in what itremoved.Why would so many large animals have been wiped out?It's the large things that tend to be most prone to extinction just in general.There are lots of reasons for that. Large animals tend to reproduce more slowly,they have fewer offspring per given period of time. They make heavier demandson their environment than do small things. So, for instance, toward the end ofthe ice age in North America, there was a small animal called the Yellow CheekBull. The Yellow Cheek Bull today lives in the Arctic and sub-Arctic, way farnorth. During the ice age, it was found as far south as Tennessee. Towards theend of the Pleistocene, its southern populations disappeared. But it did just finein terms of the longevity of the species itself. It is still very much around. That'sthe kind of pattern you expect to see in climate change. Large mammalsreproduce slowly and because they make such heavy demands on theirenvironment, they don't have the same ability to track and change withenvironmental change as the small mammals.But the mystery is that there were a lot of species that went extinct in asmall period of time and you and other scientists would like to understandwhat exactly happened that would cause catastrophic destruction?You bet. We can show that 15 of these animals went extinct between 10 and 12thousand years ago. That is a huge loss. So even if there were 15 losses in thatperiod of time, we are talking about a major extinction event.One thing worth remembering is that the cause of these extinctions has been ascientific issue since the early 1800s. That is, we are now entering the 3rdcentury of debate over the causes of these things. Darwin, in 1859, when he wastalking about extinctions in general said what I think is still an appropriate thingto say. He said, 'There is no reason to be surprised that we can't explainextinctions of this sort because in fact we are hard put to explain extinctions anytime, no matter when they appear.\" He pointed out the fact that during someperiods of time, some animals appear to be more abundant and during someother periods of time, they tend to be less abundant. It is very difficult to lookaround the landscape today and understand why a particular animal has in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"recent times in front of our very eyes disappeared from the landscape.It seems very relevant as we enter the 21st century.No question.There is now an accelerating extinction rate of species that some scientistssay we haven't seen since 65 million years ago, the end of the dinosaurs.The extinctions are linked to global warming and loss of biodiversity ascivilization spreads. So, to understand what might have happened at theend of the last ice age might give us some insight about where we could beheaded in this warming century.I agree entirely. And I'll come back to reindeer. When reindeer went extinct inFrance 11-12 thousand years ago, several things were happening. There wasgeneral atmospheric warming, so reindeer were living on a much warmerlandscape and there was vegetation change. If you look at the far north today,one of the animals that is of great concern in the far north under conditions ofglobal warming is in fact reindeer. And I think it is critically important for us tobe able to understand what happened in the past, why reindeer went extinct inthe deeper past so as to be better able to predict what might happen to themunder conditions of global warming in the future.Essentially with reindeer what happened is that their southern boundary movednorthwards. So, while they are no longer found in France, they are found inScandinavia and all across the far north. The question you can validly ask: ifglobal warming proceeds far enough, and the southern boundary of the reindeercontinues to move further north, how further north is it going to go? Is it goingto go too far north for them to survive?Which is the same issue with polar bears now as well.You bet.How close could we be to those kinds of extinctions now as earth warms soquickly?Sure, how close we are, I don't think anybody knows. That we could be comingclose is the reason for the tremendous concern over global warming amongbiologists who are interested in the welfare of the earth's biodiversity.When does Homo sapiens become threatened in its own survival on aplanet in which climate could change so rapidly?I don't have an answer to that and I don't know anybody who does have ananswer to that. But it's a good question. People are pretty plastic in theirbehavior and their adaptations. That doesn't mean we are necessarily in for a funtime, but no one has the answer to what is going to happen to us.Do you see any specific connection between climate change and the ice ageextinction of so many species?Assuming that Ross MacPhee's disease argument is wrong he may not be, but it'shard for me to see a disease vector causing extinction of so many large mammalsat the same time and causing the re-arrangement of so many small mammals onthe landscape that happened at the end of the Pleistocene in North America.Further, there is no reason to believe that people were the cause of theseextinctions. Then we are only left with one possible explanation and that'sclimate change. The real challenge for the future is figuring out what aspects ofclimate change caused these extinctions. And to do that, I'm convinced we'regoing to have to analyze data one animal at a time.\"We b s it e :http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/quaternary/ple.html"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
