Veillet, Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope.July 11, 2002 Baltimore, Maryland One of the most recent discoveries in oursolar system, NASA reports, is an \"intriguing new class of objects, dim andfleeting, which travel in pairs in the frigid, mysterious outer realm of the solarsystem called the Kuiper Belt.\" These Kuiper Belt Objects (KBOs), inhabit aregion that begins around Neptune and extends out more than nine billionmiles. At least half of the short-period comets that come through the solarsystem, around the sun and back out again are from the Kuiper Belt, named afterastronomer Gerard P. Kuiper who headed the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory atthe University of Arizona until his death in 1973.

Then only a year ago on April 16, 2001,Veillet and his colleagues announced the first discovery of the binary 1998WW31. Since then, with the help of the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomershave discovered seven pairs of small objects which revolve around each other inthe Kuiper Belt. No one yet knows why. Christian Veillet of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Corporation (CFHT) in Kamuela, Hawaii, reported in theApril issue of Nature that, \"More than one percent of the approximately 500known KBOs are indeed binary a puzzling fact for which many explanationswill be proposed in what is going to be a very exciting and rapidly evolving fieldof research in the coming years.\" This NASA composite picture at the beginning of this report shows the apparentorbit in blue of 1998 WW31 and its binary companion. The two objects revolvearound a common center of gravity, like a pair of waltzing skaters. Thiscomposite photograph shows six fainter points of light that are WW31 movingrelative to the other object which is the larger, brighter light. Astronomersassembled this picture from six separate Hubble Telescope exposures taken fromJuly to September 2001, December 2001 and January to February 2002.Scientists have been surprised that in one year, seven objects in the Kuiper Belthave been discovered orbiting in binary pairs. The objects are quite small, atleast 5,000 times less massive than Pluto, so small that the most Hubble can seeare white pinpoints of light.

Bacon of the Space Telescope Science Institute. The orbit of 1998 WW31 is the most eccentric ever measured for any binarysolar system object or planetary satellite. According to NASA scientists, \"itsorbital distance varies by a factor of ten, from 2,500 to 25,000 miles (4,000 to40,000 kilometers). The challenge is to understand how the KBOs end uptraveling in pairs. Did they form that way together? Or were they bumped intoeach other by other bodies passing through the Kuiper Belt?Ian Griffin, Ph.D., Astronomer and Head of the Office of Public Outreach at theHubble Space Telescope in Baltimore, Maryland, talked to me about thechallenge to learn more about the strange Kuiper Belt Objects, their binarynature and the evolution of our solar system.Interview:Ian Griffin, Ph.D., Astronomer and Head of the Office of Public Outreachat the Hubble Space Telescope in Baltimore, Maryland: \"The Kuiper Belt isa very mysterious region. It's a place we're still learning lots about. We know ofabout 500 objects in that region of the solar system which are outside the orbitof Pluto going outward. The first one was discovered back in 1992, so ourknowledge of this region only extends back about ten or twelve years.How far beyond Pluto?In the case of WW31, it's just a little further out than Pluto. Its orbital periodand its partner's is about 301 years. So, it's very similar in orbital period to theorbit of Pluto.What do you astronomers think the Kuiper Belt Objects are made of andwhy would seven of them be in a binary relationship with other objects?First off, they are most likely rocky and icy bodies. Secondly, the orbit ofWW31 is very, very strange. Because of this high eccentricity where the orbit isvery squashed, nothing this eccentric has been seen in the solar system before.And precisely how this object got into this strange situation is a subject ofintense discussion. When you think about satellites going around objects inspace, they tend to be fairly circular orbits. But this object has a very squashedorbit. It is very eccentric. Why it should be in that orbit is really unknown.It varies from 2,500 to 25,000 miles?That's exactly right, yes. It is a very interesting tiny world. If you were anastronaut standing on the surface of one of the members of the pair, you wouldsee the other member of the pair approach and recede dramatically during thecourse of the 570 day orbital period.Do you have any speculation?Oh, perhaps the bodies were split, maybe in a collision. Perhaps they came closeenough to each other and very loosely captured each other in a very loose wayand that resulted in the orbit we see. There are lots of different possibilities. As Isay, we really don't know which is right.There are now seven known binaries. that means scientists will have toexplain why there would be at least seven pairs of the Kuiper Belt Bodiesrevolving around the Sun.That's right. In fact, if we look in other areas of the solar system, we see thatbinary objects are pretty common. In the main asteroid belt, the one betweenMars and Jupiter, there are several known binary asteroids. Then there is"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"another set of asteroids that cross the orbit of the earth called Near EarthAsteroids. At least six of those are known to be double, too. So, it's notuncommon out there in space to have partners or binary companions.The really exciting thing for astronomers is that since the discovery of 1998WW31 in the Kuiper Belt only last year (2001), that really excited the field. Asa result of its discovery, other people went looking for binary objects in theKuiper Belt and seven have turned up. It's a very hot area of astronomy at themoment, trying to find these double objects.Does anybody yet know what the sizes are?Thanks to Sir Isaac Newton using the magic of gravity, we can roughly figure outthe masses of these objects and their densities. We've been able to figure out thatthe objects are not very dense at all. They are similar in density to comets andthat is interesting because we know outside of the Kuiper Belt there is a vastreservoir of comets called the Oort Cloud, named after the famous astronomerJan Oort. Maybe the Kuiper Belt is a transition region between the rocky stuffwe see in the inner solar system and the kind of more icy stuff we see out in theOort Cloud.This is the first time we have analyzed the mass and density of a Kuiper BeltObject and the only reason we can do that is because it's in a binary system. Andthe exciting thing is that as we turn up more of these binary systems and as wemeasure their orbits and understand their masses, we're going to gain insight intothe Kuiper Belt in a way we couldn't have done before.Will these icy Kuiper Belt Objects become comets at some point?They may be cometary in nature, but we won't see that because they are so farfrom the sun that the energy from the sun isn't enough to melt, vaporize their ice,to give them additional comet tails. So, because they are so far away wewouldn't see them as cometary type bodies.Why would there be comets come from the Oort cloud and not from theKuiper Belt?They could come from both regions. Some of these objects are comet-like,rather than rocky. Really we are going to need to look at a lot more to sayanything with any certainty. The field of binary Kuiper Belt Objects is only ayear old and we only have 7 objects and of those 7 objects, only one has had itsorbit really well determined. So, it's going to take a lot of work to understandthe story these objects can tell us about this interesting region of the solarsystem.What is the diameter of 1998 WW31?That's another interesting thing about it. The components are both about 100kilometers across. They are small compared to planets. Most planets aresignificantly larger than that. But both components of the binary system areabout the same size, one is slightly smaller by 20 kilometers or so than theother. But they are the same size and that's kind of interesting in itself.Implying that something in the process of solar system creation wouldproduce Kuiper Belt debris of similar size?I guess it's not that surprising that objects are similar in size out there. Much ofthis material is left over from the time the solar system formed roughly 5 billionyears ago.Are most of the KBOs 100 kilometers in diameter?No, the only ones we know their sizes with any certainty is this one pair, 1998WW31. The components of those are about 100 kilometers, or 70 miles, across.Until the other binary objects have their orbits measured, we won't know thesizes of them. So, the only objects we have any degree of certainty at themoment are this pair."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Hubble Photographed WW31 Over 8-Month Time Period"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Could you comment about the sequence of photos Hubble took of theKBOs?What you are seeing there is a bit like a time lapse movie being combined toshow the motion of one object around the other. There are six observationsabove from July 2001 through to February 2002 this year. On each occasion,Hubble took a picture and what we did to measure the orbit was to measure theposition of one object relative to the other object. You can see that it changesover time. That's because the two objects are in orbit around each other. Usingthose observations, we were able to calculate what the orbit would look like.From that we can measure the masses and get information about the diameters ofthe objects, too. The Object Perturbing the Oort Cloud (See Earthfiles 01/26/02)Can Hubble be used to search for the hypothesized brown dwarf that mightbe perturbing comet paths in the Oort cloud?One of the biggest problem with using Hubble to look for anything like that iswe don't know precisely where to look. Even with the marvelous new cameraswe have on Hubble, their field of view on the sky is tiny. It's a bit like having aneedle at the end of your arm and holding it up to the sky. That's how much youare looking at when you observe with Hubble.So, unless you have a very precise position for any suspected object, Hubblewouldn't know where to look. We couldn't point and look for the object. How Kuiper Belt Objects Were DiscoveredHow were the Kuiper Belt Objects first discovered?All of the Kuiper Belt Objects were discovered from ground based observations.Their orbits are pretty well known. For example, with 1998 WW31, we knowwhere it's going to be in the sky very precisely for the next few years. So, if wepoint Hubble to where we think the object is, we'll see something.Does that mean the KBOs give off enough light to be seen by ground-basedtelescopes?Yes, everything that Hubble looks at in the solar system shines by reflected light.What we are looking at when we look at the pictures of WW31 are two brightdots. The dots are made by ice and rock on the surface of these objects reflectingsunlight. So, when you look at 1998 WW31, what you are seeing is a reflectionof sunlight off the surface of the object.If the objects average only 100 kilometers across, how could astronomerswith ground-based telescopes ever find them in the first place?That is actually one of the most interesting things you can do as an astronomer isto hunt for new objects. And the way these things were found is to take a very"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"large telescope in the case of this object, WW31, it was discovered in 1998using a 4 meter telescope on the ground at Kitt Peak Observatory in Arizona.What happened is that the telescope was looking at a patch of sky and it took apicture. And then the astronomers would wait an hour or two and take anotherpicture. And in the time between the two pictures, the object moves. Andbasically, the way you look for these objects is to take a series of pictures of thesky and you look for things that move between the pictures.Astronomers were actively looking for new objects at the time because the firstKuiper Belt Object had been discovered in 1992. They were looking for newobjects. Since 1992, 500 have been discovered, but only seven are binary. Thenumber of KBOs keeps increasing by several per month.Going back to 1992, how did anyone even find the first object if the objectshad never been seen before?It's like all things in astronomy. Often times there are theories, and the KuiperBelt was a region of space that was theoretical up until 1992. It's an excellentexample about how theorists sometimes get theories right. The theory was outthere that there was this region of space that should have lots of objects in itformed when the solar system was formed, a bit like rubbish left over. And soastronomers decided to go looking for things out there. And it was only in theearly 1990s that the combination of a large telescope with a sensitive detectorand astronomers looking in the right place at the right time discovered the firstobjects. Pluto - Planet or Kuiper Belt Object?One of the interesting thing about the story is it relates back to the discovery ofPluto back in 1930. The way Pluto was discovered is that an astronomer wastaking pictures of the entire ecliptic, the region of the sky where the planets arefound, looking for faint objects. In 1930, using photographic plates, ClydeTombaugh turned up the planet Pluto appearing in different places on differentplates since it is an orbiting body in the solar system.There is still controversy about whether Pluto should be classified as aplanet or a Kuiper Belt Object, right?Yes, it's one of those debates where there is no real right or wrong answer. Plutois, in most people's minds, a planet. But when you look at it, it's quite differentthan the other planets in the solar system. It's significantly smaller. It is differentfrom the giant gas planets. So, some astronomers would say that Pluto is just thelargest member of the Kuiper Belt. Other astronomers say that it's so muchbigger than what we think the other Kuiper Belt Objects are, it really deservesthe title of a planet.I sit on the fence, but I remember growing up and learning Pluto was a planet, soto me it will always be a planet.Do we know if Pluto is nearly solid ice?Pluto is probably a mixture of ice and rock.It would be primordial, right from the beginning of the solar system'scooling down from gas to matter?That's right, material left over. Water ice could be there as well as other types ofice. Infrared Telescope (SCIRTF)Any possibility that with spectroanalysis, astronomers will be able to findout if Pluto and the KOBs are made of the same stuff?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Yes, over the next few years we are going to learn a lot more about the KuiperBelt, both through the simple use of the binary systems and weighing some ofthese objects and finding out how big they are. But there are going to betelescopes launched into space in the next few years which will revolutionizeour understanding of this region. Perhaps the most important telescope that'sdue to launch in 2003 is the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SCIRTF) whichis going to be an infrared telescope to one of the earth's LaGrangian points wayout in space. And this telescope will look at these Kuiper Belt Object and takespectra of them and those spectra will hopefully give us insight into thecomposition of the bodies. And we need to use infrared because these objectsare very cold and they are a long way out.The analysis that SCIRTF will give us will hopefully tell us a lot more aboutwhat these objects are, what they are made of and will help us understand thevery early solar system because we think these objects are pretty primordial.They are left over from very early in the solar system's history. Pluto might havecome from there.You're describing a new astronomical frontier that is only ten years oldand in Pluto's back yard.That's right. The Kuiper Belt and the Oort CloudWhat is the relationship between the Kuiper Belt and the Oort cloud?That's another good question. The two overlap and the two have different typesof objects. More than that, it's going to take us research to learn. There aredifferent scientists who say different things. If you really want to know theanswer to that question, you need to speak to one of the experts on the Oortcloud because they are better versed in the different types of objects than Iwould be.The main difference would be what?The main difference is that one is mostly comets (the Oort cloud) and one ismade up of somewhat more dense objects.The Kuiper Belt is more ice dense and the Oort cloud has more comets?Ye s .Do astronomers know if there is anything that ever comes out of theKuiper Belt through the solar system?I think the answer to that is no. We don't have any examples of objects. Thereare some comets, such as Halley's Comet its orbit goes out into the Kuiper Beltregion. It goes out beyond the orbit of Pluto and then back to the sun.Did Halley's Comet come from the Kuiper Belt?No, originally it probably came from the Oort cloud. These things get somewhatcomplicated.Would any of the known 500 Kuiper Belt Objects ever come through thesolar system?Collisions can certainly change the orbits of objects out there. But at themoment, all of the Kuiper Belt Objects are in very safe, almost circular orbitsaround the sun. They are not the source of objects that might hit the earth. Near Earth Asteroid Potential Collisions With Earth"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Of course, there is a large population of objects that cross the earth's orbit theNear Earth Asteroids. At the moment, there are about 1000 objects called NearEarth Asteroids that could cross the orbit of the earth. Those objects, the sourceof those objects was originally the main asteroid belt, the asteroids in that beltthat diverted somehow by gravity, collisions or whatever, to change their orbitand cross the orbit of the earth and they become dangerous. Now, that kind ofthing could go on out in the Kuiper Belt, but it is much less likely.Theycertainly do pose a threat to the future of the earth, a significantly greater threatthan the KBOs. When Will Astronomers Have Photographs of the Kuiper Belt Objects?Any future plans to take a closer look at the KBOs and photograph them?There were plans to launch a mission to flyby Pluto. That mission might havegone on close to one of the Kuiper Belt objects. Unfortunately, that mission isnot funded. It is still being developed. One of the problems with a mission likethat is it takes a long time for the spacecraft to get out to those parts of the solarsystem at least seven to ten years. Even if we launched a mission next year,which we won't, it wouldn't get any pictures back to us before 2010 or 2011. Soit's going to be a long time before we have any pictures of these objects inclose-up.In the meantime, Hubble will continue photographing them?Yes. We've got Hubble and ground-based astronomers with their huge several-meter-diameter telescopes can also give us useful information about theseobjects. When the Space Infrared Telescope is operational in late 2003,hopefully we will get much more information about the binaries.At that point, do you think the infrared telescope can search for thehypothesized brown dwarf that might be perturbing the comet paths in theOort cloud?Not unless we get more information about the position of the proposed object,no telescope will ever be able to look for it. All of these telescopes have verysmall fields of view. Unless we know pretty precisely where any object is, it'sgoing to be much worse than hunting for a needle in a haystack.\"More Information:The Martian Moon Phoebos Has Not Disappeared Martian moon Phoebos on the left, photographed in 1977,and Deminos on the right, photographed in 1974. \"What about using Hubble to confirm the Russian rumor that the Martianmoon, Phoebos, disappeared.
