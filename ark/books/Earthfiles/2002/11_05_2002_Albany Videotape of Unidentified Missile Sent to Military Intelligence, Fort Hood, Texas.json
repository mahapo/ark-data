They said someone hascaptured a picture before that they think a missile brought that plane down. So,I guess that's why they are investigating this so closely, the military is.THIS IS MILITARY INTELLIGENCE AT FORT HOOD IN TEXAS. AND IFTHEY HAVE THE VIDEOTAPE, THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE GOTTENIT FROM THE FBI.Yeah, probably.BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T ASKED YOU FOR A COPY?No. No. Yeah, they must have.WHO CALLED YOUR ASSIGNMENT DESK AT THE STATION TO TELLTHEM?I'm not sure. Let me ask him right now. ... OK, he won't tell me his name.REALLY?Yeah, he says he promised that this guy who called that it's all off the record notto give anyone his name or what he has done.IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S SERIOUS.Yeah. Yeah.\"Brandon also got an e-mail today from the Senior Editor at Defense Watch, anon-line periodical devoted to military matters and homeland security, planningto do a story about the Albany videotape later this week.FOX 23 is now preparing news specials to follow up on Brandon Mowry'svideotape which will be broadcast first on FOX and then UPN in Albany.

In addition to the North Dakota objectsabove compared to the Albany, New York object, Jose plans to send otherphotos referenced in his November 1, 2002 e-mail reply.Nov. 1, 2002Hi, Mr. Escamilla:Appreciate the work you have done on the mysterious \"rods\" phenomenon andknow you talked about the Albany, NY object with Art Bell on COAST. OnMonday, I had a follow-up with the FOX videographer on a COAST segmentwith George Noory. The cameraman thinks the object was at the cloud ceilinglevel of 5,000 feet and thus, quite long in relationship to the airliner that passedabove him at an estimated 300 feet altitude.Wondered what size parameter ranges you have found for \"rods\" in yourresearch?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Reply on 11/1/02 3:37 PM, Jose Escamilla wrote:> \"Hi Linda!>> Thanks for your message.
