New formations in all three countries have been discoveredsince the June 21st summer solstice. One of the most extraordinary was reportedyesterday in the North Farm near West Overton, Wiltshire, at the top of a hill. Itis like a labyrinth made of two coils winding around each other in oppositedirections. Each coil ends up with a 25-foot-diameter serpent head that containstwo eyes of standing crop.ENGLANDWest Overton, Wiltshire England, Reported June 23, 2002North Farm, near West Overton, Wiltshire, England, reported June 23, 2002.Photograph © 2002 by Steve Alexander. http://www.cropcircleconnector.com. That photograph was taken by professional photographer, Steve Alexander, whohas many crop formation photographs at the website,www.cropcircleconnector.com. The connector is an invaluable service foreveryone interested in following the crop patterns as they emerge and studyingall those in past years. Mark Fussell and Stuart Dike produce the website andmaintain its large archive, asking for only modest subscriptions and donations tokeep producing the extensive website. For only $23/year, a subscriber has accessto all of the archives and receives immediate news flashes by e-mail of every newformation reported to cropcircle connector.com.Part of the new double coiled serpent formation in West Overton's North Fieldgoes over the hilltop and part way down the hill. Yet, from the air, the patternseems to accommodate the irregularities of the undulating field so that the coilappears perfectly shaped.I talked about the new Overton formation with British crop formationinvestigator, Charles Mallett. Charles and his wife, Frances, operate the newSilent Circle Cafe near the White Horse of Cherhill. The couple visited theformation on June 23, the day it was discovered."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Pole shot of the double spiral © 2002 by Charles Mallett. Interview:Charles Mallett, The Silent Circle Cafe, Cherhill, Wiltshire, England: \"Itwas very impressive and rather large, somewhere in the range of 250 to 300 feetdiameter, spread across the field. A double coiling serpent, fairly original for thisarea. There were some very interesting features as can be seen in the aerial shotat the cropcircleconnector website. Each head are like polar regions. I got afeeling, even though I didn't have a compass, that they were north and south.You can see standing sections in each representation of the heads, standingsections like eyes from the aerial point of view, which is fairly interesting. Itseems to look like two serpents coiled together and meeting at a center.Looking straight between the \"eyes\" of one of the two serpent heads in theWest Overton double coil. Photograph © 2002 by Charles Mallett.To give you a sense of the size of this particular formation, each of the two headsspans something like 25 feet in diameter, as does the center circle. The actualpathway is almost exactly 6 feet wide consistently throughout the entire eventand consistently throughout the entire formation it is neat, clean, tidy. In someplaces, it is extremely fluid. Very neat. Very cleanly cut, almost cookie cutterstyle.It is fairly mature barley. It's probably about 4 feet high. I'm 5'9\", fairly averageheight. You can't really see much, just parallel lines receding off into thedistance. It was very hard to work out and particularly difficult to draw. Simplecircles are easy to draw. But try to draw two continuous spirals wrappedtogether, it is extremely difficult. And it has been executed in the field to a veryhigh degree. I've gone in hundreds of formations over the years. We're prettyfamiliar with looking at formations. If they are easy to figure out, we usually can"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"pretty quickly. This one, we're still not quite sure how we could actually do thatat all. How we could draw it on a large piece of paper on a table, let alone on asloping and undulating field in the middle of the night. It would be extremelydifficult and my experience at this time is telling me that formation is for real.Esoterically speaking, it is a very significant pattern for this area because it iskind of over the hill from the Avebury complex. The Avebury complexessentially being a huge serpent in the landscape. It covers an area somethinglike 5 square miles with the main Avebury stone circles as the body and there isa snaking serpent head that goes all the way up to Overton Hill and finishes atthe Sanctuary which was perceived as the head with the tail drifting off towardBeckhampton, another circle hot spot.The ancient Celts perceived the serpent as symbolic of energy flowing throughthe earth. Such energy lines in Great Britain are known as \"ley lines.\" Butserpent energy, from the dowsing point of view, is described in huge, coilingspirals of energy concentrated at Avebury. I guess that's why those places wereconstructed in the first place to concentrate this energy for ceremonial andmetaphysical purposes. Maybe one has just manifest in the field for, I'm notquite certain what reason, but there seems to be a kind of symbolicrepresentation up there in that crop circle as the ancient complex at Avebury.\"Longwood Warren, Cheesefoot Head, Near Winchester, Hampshire, ReportedJune 23, 2002Monday afternoon, June 24, British researcher and author, Lucy Pringle, flewover Longwood Warren in Hampshire to photograph another formationdiscovered there yesterday.

That formation also had six ringsthat contained 69 circles, of which 65 were counted on the outer \"asteroid\" ringalone. Now in June 2002 almost exactly seven years later, is this supposed torepresent another solar system?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"1995 - \"Asteroid Belt and Missing Third Planet,\" discovered at Longwood Warren,Hampshire,June 26, 1995.

This one is similar to other patterns in past years that haveoverlapping half circles inside the perimeter of a larger circle. To their surprise,the field was not in Holland. It was 50 meters across the border into Germany.Robert Boerman and Bert Janssen say it's a very puzzling formation because itlooks good on the ground. He and Janssen could not find any human or othertracks in the formation and the plants themselves seemed to have been put downso lightly that even the stalks did not leave imprints in the soil. Yet, from the airthe geometry is unfinished and sloppy not the perfection found in trulymysterious formations.While the men were studying the formation, a German TV crew showed up,interviewed them and later discovered something odd on the televisionvideotape.Robert Boerman, Crop Circle Researcher, Dutch Crop Circle Archive,Brummen, Holland: \"We did an interview for German television and radio andnewspapers. They called me a few hours ago, German television, and they saidthey recorded a very strange high sound on tape.That was during an interview at the formation today?In the formation, yes. When they were out of the formation, they didn't hearanything. But in the formation, there was a very high sound.That's like England in 1989 when the BBC recorded a strange, unidentifiedhigh-pitched trilling sound on videotape when they were inside a largecircle at Beckhampton, Wiltshire.Yeah. The German television people promised to put this sound of the newformation on CD and send it to my place. So if I have it, maybe I can edit it andput it to the website and anyone can hear it.In summary, what you've got is a formation that apparently emerged this pastweekend on the German side of the border beyond Groesbeek, Holland. On theground, the plants appear to have been pushed down by some kind of energybecause you cannot find imprints of the plants in the soil and no human or othertracks in it. But the geometry is confusingly sloppy and unfinished.Yes, in the photos you can see that one of the half circles inside the big circle, itisn't finished. We have absolutely no idea what to think about it. It's a very weirdformation.Could it be that this is only Stage One of something that is yet to come?Maybe. A very good dowser, he said to me he predicted this formation. He saidthere will be a formation at Groesbeek and we should go do some researchthere. He said that last week to me. And now there is a formation in Groesbeek.He was with me today and he said, 'I have a feeling there is more coming onhere.'\" Mysterious Lights Seen Near June 18, 2002 Hoeven, Holland Crop CircleRobert Boerman also visited Hoeven, Holland recently to see two circleformations in the wheat field near the home of Robbert van de Broecke.

Robert Boerman: \"I know Robbert has seen a crop circle formed in front of hiseyes. At the last circle formed on June 18. He gets the idea that he has to bikearound in the area there, in the neighborhood, and gets a feeling. And he thinksthat something has happened in this field and that's about the formation fromJune 18.He got the impression in his mind that something had happened in the field?Yes. Just a feeling. And then he biked around the neighborhood. And then hesays, 'Maybe this field.' And then he sees some lights above it. And he thought,'Wow, maybe it's a car.' But it wasn't a car because the lights came over the ditchand then hovered above the field and then they seemed, the lights, go together.And then become one light and then go smaller and smaller light and thendisappears.The next day, he found the crop circle.\"Continued in Update on German Formations"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"http://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://home.clara.net/lucypringlehttp://www.dcca.nl/update%202002-nl.htmhttp://www.invisiblecircle.deCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
