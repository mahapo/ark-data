Ideas that seem too far out are discountedas fantasy, labeled impossible or simply ignored. The Cascade County deputies, working to solve the rash of cattle mutilations,felt no idea was too weird to merit careful consideration. For this reason, theyhave considered the theory that the mutilations were the result of some cult andthey expended considerable time investigating reports that might indicatepositive confirmation of this theory. \"Some people believe the theory that mutilation is done by devil worshipers,\"Captain Wolverton said, \"and we don't discount it. It could be true.\" There has certainly been evidence that could indicate this is the answer. And if acult is responsible for the mutilations, it would explain in part why the blood isoften drained from the animal and certain parts of the animal removed. About two months after Captain Wolverton started investigating the mutilations,he discussed them with a law officer in another part of the state who had movedto Montana about two years earlier. The officer said he believed the mutilationsinvolved a cult of witches. He told Captain Wolverton that he had information,but was reluctant to talk about it. The officer's theory was that the cattle were being tranquilized with PCP, ahallucinogenic drug. The blood was then removed from the animal and given tothe witches of the cult to drink, which caused them to trip out. The time sequence when the mutilations take place has a significance, accordingto the theory advanced by the officer. He said he believed the cattle were killedwhen the sun and moon were in a certain phase which could explain why somany are during a full moon, or that mutilations occur on a cult member'sbirthday or on certain days such as the spring equinox. The officer's theory isshared by a police officer in another Montana city. However, at the time of thiswriting, it is not more than theory. The cult theory was also advanced in a report the Cascade County officersreceived from a sheriff's office in California. The officer there reported that therehad been mutilations in his area, but he did not know of any in which the bloodwas removed. However, he reported that a group of backpackers saw members ofa cult sacrifice an animal. He said the cultists were wearing hoods and robes andwere chanting. When law officers arrived later at the scene, all that they foundwas the remains of an animal which had been buried. There is a site in Montana, near Butte, which appears to be a location forritualistic ceremonies. Law officers have learned that the place is referred to as"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the Montana site. Some authorities believe a cult occasionally holds ceremoniesthere during the full moon and the members of the cult are dressed in longrobes. This is believed to be some kind of ceremonial site used by a cult or cults.It is located just south of Butte in the mountains. The area around the apparently naturalpit is outlined with rocks of various sizes. Some of them have inscriptions on themwhich could be interpreted different ways. Photograph © 1976 by Cascade CountySheriff's Office. Several law officers have visited the site, which is a short distance south of Butteon U. S. Forrest Service land. The turnoff from the mountain road to the site ismarked with a large stone with Nelo 5-15-29 painted on it in black. The site isabout 75 yards up the mountain from the rock. A report by Captain Wolverton and Deputy Ken Anderson, who visited the siteApril 14, 1976, states:\"Approximately 75 yards up the mountain from the rock is a complete circle ofrocks 61 feet in circumference (this is west of the Nelo rock). The rocks encirclewhat looks like a natural pit; it did not appear to have been dug out. The pit is 41/2 feet deep with a fire pit at the center. The fire pit was encircled with smallrocks about 18 inches in diameter. There was no indication of a recent fire andwhen it was used, the fire was very small. Inside the encircled area are two Lodgepole pine trees, one on the right and oneon the left. Each tree had a nail in it. If something was stretched between thetwo trees, it would be off center and be over the stone with ISIS printed on it.The stone with the inscription of ISIS favor us! Mother of moon lover ofgoodness, is resting on the roots of one of the trees. If one were standing in thecenter of the pit looking at the ISIS stone, one would be looking southeast andthe stone faces northwest. By drawing a straight line from the ISIS stone to thenorthwest, the line would be in the center of the rock that is inscribed withYHWH. There does not appear to be any relationship between the stones that havewriting on them and various rocks, selected at random, which have the paintingon them. None of the rocks that made up the circle were very large, the biggestbeing roughly 10 inches across; the smallest being a handful of rocks to fill upany gaps.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"This is the \"altar\" in the place near Butte commonly known as the Montana site.The stone, resting on the roots of the tree, is inscribed, \"ISIS favor us! Mother of moonlover of goodness.\" ISIS is Egyptian for mother of goodness, but it also stands for anancient cult in Rome believed to have been involved in cattle mutilations.Photograph © 1976 by Cascade County Sheriff's Office. Reports by officers who had visited the site earlier indicated there was a coyotetrap near the stone labeled ISIS, but it was not there when Captain Wolvertonand Deputy Anderson visited the site. ISIS is believed to be the name of anancient cult of Egypt, later worshiped in Greek and Roman empires, which hadas its symbol a cow. The cult was said to have utilized mutilations in ancienttimes. ISIS was an Egyptian goddess of fertility. The word YHWH on the rock opposite the one labeled ISIS is believed to be aforbidden pronunciation of the word God. The numbers 5-15-29 is numerologystanding for evil and Satan. A five-pointed star and a symbol similar to the Naziswastika were found on some of the stones in a circle. The star, called apentagram, is a symbol of the Devil, and the swastika is a symbol of a cult. Two stones bore the name Jesus. Another was labeled Ariel, which is one of thefive satellites of the planet Uranus, which some believe has an evil influence.Another stone bore the inscription Jehova, which means female demon, butcould also possibly be an abbreviation of the word Jehovah, meaning God.Several of the words had more than one translation and there are otherinterpretations that could be made of the site. One tube of black paint and apaint brush were found by one of the trees, but time and weather had eliminatedany chance of getting fingerprints from them. While captain Wolverton and Deputy Anderson were there, a deputy from Butteand his trained dog searched the site and the immediate area around it, butfound nothing. an interesting incident took place on Forest Service land in BlainCounty, Idaho, and may or may not have a connection with cattle mutilations.Two Forest Service men were placed on guard in a remote area to keep cattlefrom being illegally grazed on Forest Service land. Apparently one of the twomen left to go into town and the other was standing guard from a secluded areawhere he could not be seen. As he was watching about about 5:45 p.m., he noticed two men dressed in bodylength black, hooded robes, walking about 50 yards from him. the taller of thetwo men was carrying a bag, but the guard could not determine if there wasanything in it. Although there was a jeep trail about five yards from where the men werewalking, they apparently preferred to stay among some willows as though toavoid detection. Their pointed hoods apparently had a partial opening, but they"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"did not turn their heads so that the guard could see their faces. When theyreached a clearing, they hurried and gave the impression they did not want to beseen. They looked straight ahead and never turned their heads. One of the most unusual aspects of the incident was that cattle in the areabecame very quiet just before the strangely-garbed men appeared. The guardsaid he was expecting an elk to appear, but instead the two men appeared. Hetold authorities that he observed the men for approximately three minutes.Officers said no mutilated cattle were found at the time the two hooded menwere seen, but they added that there had been numerous cattle mutilationsreported in that county. An interesting theory was advanced by a young woman who was interviewed byauthorities in Montana. She claims to know that some very rich people arebehind the mutilations and that they pay less wealthy persons to do themutilation for them. She said they often pay from $500 to $1,000 for the partstaken from the animals. Authorities have not proven or disproven her theory. At one time during the investigation, Captain Wolverton corresponded with aman in Arkansas who has done extensive research in the field of ESP (extra-sensory perception). He had earlier helped the Cascade County Sheriff'sDepartment in connection with a homicide case, but at this particular time waswriting to Captain Wolverton concerning any possible connection betweencattle mutilations, UFOs and the occult. The man wrote that he had attended aconference on UFOs at which an investigator who was also a helicopter pilotstated that he believed the mutilations were the work of a fanatical religious cultequipped with helicopters and using special shoes which left no tracks. Commenting on this theory, the ESP expert wrote:\"While I have not put my mind on this mystery, I cannot conceive of anythingone could put on the feet which would not show tracks of some kind. Withouttrying to be psychic for the moment, the fact that this mutilation of cattle hasoccurred in a number of other states suggests quite a well-organized group forcultists, if they are the cause. This (has) happened enough times to give farmers achance to have caught them at it or to have sighted them.\" He asked the question that if helicopters are being used, how are they able to getin and out without being observed? Montana law officers have receivednumerous reports of unidentified helicopters in the area, including some that areall black with no markings. There have also been reports of people hearinghelicopters fly over their homes at low altitude during the night, but thesepeople were unable to see them.\"It would be some operation,\" the ESP man wrote, \"for a helicopter to hover afew feet above ground while some of the crew jumped out, did their mutilationof the cattle and then were hoisted aboard. That still does not explain nofootprints or tire tracks being left behind. And what about dogs who may havebeen watching the cattle? What would they have been doing meanwhile? \"Indulging in fantastic speculation,\" he continued, \"space ships with their powerto remain stationary in the air and occupants to float to earth, as has beenreported, leaving no imprints, taking specimens of animal parts and blood forexamination and so on could come closer at explanation. It would seem it wouldtake unusual instrumentation and devices for instantly making the cattleimmobile, to do such a job and get away with it, in an incredibly short length oftime. But who can accept such a speculation?\" The man asked if the farm area was being policed at night and if the farmersthemselves were concerned enough to set up watches. Captain Wolverton toldhim in his letter of reply that some ranchers had set up patrols, but nothing had"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"come of it. Law officers also patrol the rural areas, but so far they have not beenable to catch the mutilators. The ESP researcher, who is himself a sensitive, described the ESP impressionshe had received on the mutilations with these words: \"I feel that however it is being done there are bands of five - women as well asmen - involved. I see them masked, wearing black or dark jumper-like, tight-fitting clothing. Sinister appearing, highly trained in their operations, eachassigned certain duties ... armed with guns and instruments ... equipped withblack cases or specially prepared bags for carrying the animal parts ... containersfor blood ... they move in quickly, efficiently and are away just as quickly. I getthe feeling of air action ... what kind, I cannot 'see' ... but it seems silent ... theyhave somehow 'cased' the area and select time and place when they are almostcertain of no detection.\" The man admitted that the things he had heard or read about cattle mutilationscould have colored the impressions he received. But law officers wondered atthe strange coincidence of the black outfits with the black-robed men in Idahoand the black helicopters seen over Montana. Yellow indicates the towns, counties and areas affected by animal mutilations,unidentified helicopters and mysterious aerial craft during 1974 to 1976. Twenty-sevenyears later, in 2001 to 2002, Pondera County and surrounding region experienced morethan adozen animal mutilations associated with unidentified lights and other high strangeness.See Earthfiles 08/18/01.
