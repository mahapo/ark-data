Bothgroups discovered that the farthests points of the comets' orbits seemed tocluster along a particular path. In 1999, Dr. John Matese, Professor of Physics atthe University of Louisiana in Lafayette, lead his team to publish a paperentitled, \"Supportive Evidence for a Brown Dwarf Solar Companion.\" Hishypothesis is the comet orbit pattern is consistent with the gravitationalattraction, or \"impulse,\" of a large object that cannot be explained as a passingrogue star or the normal gravitational tugs and pulls of galactic matter. In otherwords, there is Something out there perturbing comet orbits in the Oort cloudsurrounding our solar system. He thinks it might be a brown dwarf, but so farthere is no visible evidence."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The dark blue, small circles represent 109 comet orbits observed by the end of 2001 in theOort cloud to statistically cluster along paths in a pattern consistent with the gravitationalattraction, or\"impulse,\" of an object not yet identified, but estimated to be about three or four times themass of Jupiter.Graphic courtesy John Maltese.John J.

The extra number of comets that we are seeing in this more recentenhanced data that we have, the enhanced track (perturbation) across the skystill persists. And we ask questions like: Can we reject the conjecture that anobject out there exists? And in essence, you cannot reject this conjecture. Infact, it is highly suggestive that you need an impulsive contribution to the Cloud.But does that mean that we have proven that such an object exists? That wouldbe a bit foolish to say. No one is going to accept this as proven until it isobserved.Can Hubble (Space Telescope) see this object possibly?Hubble probably cannot see this object because Hubble does not look at thewavelength range. If it has the properties that we infer, Hubble doesn't have thesensitivity in the wavelengths. The object we're talking about would be rathercold and dark. Dark in visible light. It would be relatively bright in certainregions of the infrared radiation band.If it is a very cold object, what is it?It would likely be an object that would be at the low end mass end of objectsthat we think of as 'brown dwarfs.'Why would a brown dwarf, a kind of dead star, be orbiting our solarsystem a half a light year (three trillion miles) from our sun?It's now fairly well believed that when stars form and when our sun formed thatthe environment is very complex. That the star doesn't form in isolation. That itforms in a dense complex of other stars, in a star-forming region, and we knowthat these brown dwarfs exist. Brown dwarfs are seen. Brown dwarfs are foundfreely floating in space, and we know they can be attached to other stellarsystems.These are basically stars that tried to become suns and for whatever reasonthey died.Yes. They didn't have enough mass to fuse hydrogen. They may be doing somesecondary fusion, so to speak, releasing energy, but not the hydrogen fusion. Sothey are not releasing enough energy to become a conventional star. And if theyare mass is only the size of Jupiter's mass, then even that secondary fusion won'tbe occurring. They will just be slowly cooling off from the collapse process.And these are the kind of object that we are thinking there can't be any fusiongoing on in the object we're talking about. If there was fusion going on, therewould have to be much mass, it would have to be more the size of conventionalbrown dwarfs and we don't think it can be that massive. It has to be more a fewJupiter masses.If I understand, you are describing that in the early solar system theremight likely have been something developing in the sense of a binary starsystem. There are many binary star systems in this galaxy. And thismystery object might have been the so-called twin or other star developingalong with what became our sun. But the one at the edge of the Oort clouddidn't have enough ingredients to get going as a sun?That's right. That's the conjecture. One of the reason why the whole thing is stillconsidered speculative is that nobody has seen such a system out there yet. Theyhaven't seen other stars that have a binary Jovian mass companion because theorbit we are talking about is very extended. And they have only inferred theevidence of Jovian mass objects around other stars when they are very close inplanetary orbits."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"That leads to another question I had. How could gravity from this solarsystem keep something that is several sizes of Jupiter attached to this solarsystem at a distance of half a light year from our sun?Well, if you accept that the Oort cloud of comets can remain attached to thesun, then anything closer in can remain attached to the sun. Our object wouldbe a thousand times further than Pluto.Scaled Distance Perspective If Earth Were One Inch From Sun:Pluto, the ninth planet/moon, would be a bit more than a yard fromthe sun.Mystery object, or brown dwarf, would be a half mile from the sun.The object, or brown dwarf, would be about a half light-year from the sun?(3 trillion miles. Closest known active sun is Alpha Centauri, 4 light yearsfrom Earth)Yes. And it doesn't matter whether it's a comet or whether it's a Jupiter massobject, the sun's gravity will tend to dominate if the object is moving slowenough, it will fall around the sun if it's inside that interval of distance we weretalking about.But if it were moving fast, it would have gone away from the solar system?Yes, I alluded to the fact that not too long ago, stars come zipping past us. Andthese stars sometimes come zipping relatively close, meaning as close as I'mtalking about this Jovian mass object being out there a thousand times as faraway as Pluto. Sometimes stars come zipping by and get that close to the sun.But because they are moving so fast, the gravity of the sun only deflects theirtrajectory a little bit and so instead of falling around the sun, they just getdeflected as they zip on by.This suggests that if there is a slow speed to this large object out there halfa light year from our sun, it might have been attached to our solar systemfor a very long time. Do you know what the length of time to revolvearound our solar system would be for this object?There are different time scales that might be discussed. If this object exists outthere, it probably formed along with the solar system, so it probably has beenaround for 4.5 billion years that the solar system has existed. And it probablyformed in this complex with all the other stars that were in this presumedstar-forming region.The time it would take to go around the sun if it is in its conjectured orbit, thetime is something of the order of 4 million years.It would take four million years?Four million years as compared to the life time of the solar system which is morethan four billion years.The idea that something could be orbiting at that distance every 3,000 to4,000 years is not feasible in terms of your calculations?Where does the 3,000 or 4,000 year orbit come from?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"There is a man named Zecharia Sitchin. (Author of The 12th Planet ©1976)Oh, yeah. I don't want to talk about that.But this is a book that is out there in the world in thousands of copies.I get an extraordinary number of e-mails and requests to talk about this thingand what he is talking about is in no way connectable to the object I'm talkingabout.Because a 3,000 or 3,600 year orbit would not apply?That is not consistent, it could not produce the effects I just got throughreferencing.Have you ever talked with a Sumerian academic scholar about theSumerian cuneiform that is supposed to suggest some sort of tenth planetthat revolves around our solar system?I have not talked in a conventional sense. I have had e-mail exchanges withpeople who have attempted to get me interested in it and I have read somematerial. But the extent of my reading didn't last past ten or fifteen minutes and Iconcluded that there was no chance that there could be anything scientificcoming out of these readings, so I am not knowledgeable about the subject.It's interesting that there are cuneiform tablets and seals with drawingsthat are about 5,000 years old from Mesopotamia. The seal drawings doseem to show a solar system with the sun and what appears to be not nine,but ten planets.

Sitchinsays,\"Mars is shown correctly as smaller than Earth, but larger than the Moon or Mercury.\"But the problem is that I've just described that the object I happen to be talkingabout can't be seen in visible light and the Sumerians just didn't have infrareddetectors back then. So, it's not likely we are talking about the same object. It'sjust not possible.5,000 years ago was it possible that something out in the Oort cloud, or atthe edges, might still have been seen in visible light?Nope, not if it's the object I'm thinking about. I mean, it's possible someone elsehas other ideas, but not my object. What we're talking about, if my physics iscorrect, their object cannot be my object.Because a brown dwarf would have been invisible and cold 5,000 yearsago?Ye s .When are we going to be able to look out there and try to find this object insome kind of infrared?In fact, they are putting up an (infrared) satellite (NASA Space InfraredTelescope Facility, SIRTF) in the next year or so that would likely detect thisobject if I could tell them precisely where to point. And therein lies theproblem. My analysis at the present time is only capable of giving a relativelyrough estimate of where we would look. And by that, I can do no better thandelineate 5% of the sky. The object that I'm thinking about, it should be foundin a portion of the sky that would extend up to 5% which is an awful lot of skyto be looking at.\"Future Infrared Research:Do the satellites with the infrared ability have to be pinpoint? Or can theydo a broad brush and still pick up heat sources?Dr. Matese: They are directional, that is, they aren't used in the mode for asurvey. They aren't just going to look at 50% of the sky and catalog everythingthey see for later use. Quite some time ago there was a satellite out there withlower sensitivity that did a survey called IRAS and there was a proposal to sendanother survey instrument up there to survey the sky in the infrared. And that isin fact the instrument that would be most likely to pick this object out of the skybecause it (mystery object) should be relatively bright in the infrared if you usecurrent technology and look in its direction. But unfortunately, there is nosurvey instrument out there and that's that.The current infrared instruments that are being constructed for launch areby NASA?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Yes, one which will be a satellite is called SIRTF (Space Infrared TelescopeFacility) and that's going to be operational this year, I think. And there isanother program called SOFIA (Stratospheric Observatory For InfraredAstronomy). Both of these systems have different capabilities, but I think bothwould likely be able to detect this object if it really exists and they knew exactlywhere to look. SOFIA: Based from a Boeing 747SP aircraft modified by Raytheon AircraftIntegration Services to accommodate a 2.5 meter reflecting telescope. SOFIAwill be the largest airborne observatory in the world and will makeobservations that are impossible for even the largest and highest ofground-based telescopes.

At this stage, serendipity is the only way this object would be seen which iswhy I have to be patient and hope that within the next ten years the governmentfunds an infrared survey. Several scientists are making such proposals, but it hasto be something that will be funded and the government has to make decisions.There are always competing requests for money.\"http://www.ucs.louisiana.edu/~jjm9638/matese.htmlhttp://sofia.arc.nasa.gov/http://sirtf.caltech.edu/http://www.ipac.caltech.edu/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"earthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
