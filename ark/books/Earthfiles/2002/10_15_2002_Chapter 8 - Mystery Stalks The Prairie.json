Twenty-sevenyears later, in 2001 to 2002, Pondera County and surrounding region experienced morethan adozen animal mutilations associated with unidentified lights and other high strangeness.See Earthfiles 08/18/01. uring their entire investigation, Cascade County officers have sought to verifyany possible connection between the cattle mutilations and the reports of UFOs,unidentified helicopters, strange lights and noises and the hairy creatures. Insome instances, there has seemed to be a connection, but it has beenfrustratingly difficult to prove. A case in point is a cow that was mutilated in late July 1975, on Ashlot Benchnorth of Fort Shaw. As in many other cases, the cow's teats had been cut off,apparently with an extremely sharp instrument. But in contrast to other caseswhere there was no sign of struggle, or tracks, or other evidence around theanimal, the grass this time was trampled down in a nine foot radius around thecarcass. Although a sample of the grass was tested at a laboratory, nothingconclusive was indicated.

But what particularly interested officers this time was the rancher's report thathe saw a red light blinking in a field where the cow was later found. He watchedthe light take off down a road. At the time, he said, he thought it was a highwaypatrol car. when officers checked, they verified that there were o highway patrolor sheriff's cars in that area at that time. A short time later, a rancher's young son was out irrigating on his motorcyclewhen he saw a red light going through a field. It aroused his curiosity because heknew there was no way for a vehicle to get into that field. Since his motorcyclewas running, the youth was unable to say whether there was any sound comingfrom the object with the red light. Shortly thereafter, the rancher discovered thattwo of his cows were missing. They have never been found. Later, one of their neighbors, who also had a cow mutilated, reported seeing ared light going down the road near the site. The records in the Cascade County Sheriff's Office are filled with numerousreports of UFO sightings. In a number of cases, the person reporting the sightingwas able to give officers a vivid description of the strange craft. These variedfrom a saucer-shaped craft or something that looked like a giant pear, to a largeobject that looked like a two-story building with lights resembling windows. Often the viewer could see nothing but the bright light coming from the object.Offices explained this would be like meeting a car on the highway at night andbeing unable to describe the car because of the brightness of its headlights.Sometimes a UFO seemed to chase cars or fly over airplanes. At times a strangeobject appeared to land, or to hover over a certain place. A Raynesford farmer, reporting a UFO he saw, estimated the speed at which it"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"ascended straight up at exceeding 5,400 miles per hour. When he first phoned inthe report, Judith Basin County authorities suggested it could possibly be abright star or planet in the sky. \"Then why can I see a mountain behind it?\" he asked. At least one person reported a daylight sighting of two UFOs and was even ableto draw a sketch of what he saw for officers. The man, who lives at Vaughn, ashort distance northwest of Great Falls, said he was driving on the interstateabout dusk when he saw two UFOs flying from south to north. He said eachobject had a domed top which glowed. There was a revolving blue and whitelight on the bottom of the craft and lightning bolts as long as the craft itselfcame out of the bottom of one craft at intervals. He said the two objects werenot traveling fast and he was able to observe them for about five minutes. Curiously, the reports of UFOs and the reports of unidentified helicoptersstarted coming in about the same time in the summer of 1975, although therehad been some isolated calls before that time. It is obvious that the two are notthe same thing, since eyewitnesses have described both the UFOs and theHelicopters and they bear little resemblance. Some of the bright lights, however,could conceivably be either one. Two teenage girls who live at Geyser, southeast of Great Falls, were sadlyfrightened when they were apparently chased by a UFO as they drove home onthe highway. They told Judith Basin County Undersheriff, Jerry Skelton, thatthey saw a strange object hovering over their car as they drove along thehighway. It continued to stay above their car as they hurried home. When the badly shaken girls reached their home, they ran inside and told othermembers of their family. All of them went outside and viewed the UFO stillhovering above the house. It left a short time later. Like some of the unidentified helicopters, some of the UFOs seemed to make nonoise. A Fort Shaw man who watched a strange blue and white light amongsome trees near his home told officers he heard no noise at all. A veterinarian, who incidentally helped investigate some of the cattlemutilations, was driving south of Bowman's Corner when he saw a strange whitelight in the sky that had a red light on the left side. He told officers the light keptdisappearing and then returning. He estimated his distance from the object atfive miles. An interesting and possible significant sidelight to the veterinarian's report washis comment that the cattle in the area started bawling \"louder than I have everheard.\" Two days later, a Great Falls man reported seeing a very bright light early in themorning, about 6:30 a.m. He said the light seemed to be just southeast ofMalmstrom Air Force Base. It reminded him of an aircraft's landing light, exceptit did not seem to be moving. He discounted the possibility of it being a star,since he could see stars behind it. He watched the light for about eleven cityblocks as he drove home. When his mother-in-law heard about what he had seen, she went outside andwatched it, too. Later, several other people viewed it. \"I don't know when the light left,\" the man said. The sighting may have been only a prologue because a little more than 36 hourslater, U. S. Air Force and law enforcement officials put in a night they will longremember. The series of sightings began about 9 p.m. the evening of October 18,1975, and continued until 7:45 a.m. the next morning. Base Operations at Malmstrom confirmed that they had reports on nine differentsightings in the Cascade and Eden areas just south of Great Falls. At the same"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"time, law enforcement officers were getting reports from north of Great Falls asfar as Shelby. The first report received by the Cascade County Sheriff's office was at 4:20 a.m.and came from the sheriff's office at Shelby. Officers there reported they had aUFO in sight and that it was moving from one location to another at anextremely high rate of speed. They estimated the altitude from 2,000 to 5,000feet. Malmstrom AFB officials were immediately notified and they replied that theyhad been receiving reports since 9 p.m. the previous evening. Both Malmstromand NORAD confirmed that the object was not a conventional aircraft and askedthat they be given all possible information on it. They had a description when a Shelby officer phoned in at 4:53 a.m. to say thatthe object was very close. He described it as a \"white light, red flame aft, greenlight on top, red lights on both sides.\" About fifteen minutes later, Shelbyreported that the UFO was climbing and headed west. At 6:04 a.m., an officer patrolling in the Power area, a short distance northwestof Great Falls, reported seeing the object over Conrad between him and Shelby.He said it kept changing color from red to white and kept changing altitudeslowly. The situation was growing tense and the sheriff's office sent an officer toBase Operations at Malmstrom to help as radio coordinator. In the meantime, the patrolling officer had reached Dutton as he traveled northtoward Conrad and Shelby. He reported the object was very low and thensuddenly shot straight up until it was fairly high. Eleven minutes later at 6:30a.m., he radioed that the object appeared to be heading east from Conrad andwas more brilliant in color. The sheriff's office at Shelby said the strange objecthad also been seen by Montana Fish and Game officials. Its location wasestimated southwest of Conrad. Twelve minutes later, the patrolling officer reported the object south and east ofChester, between that town and Fort Benton. This location is 40 to 50 miles eastof the area near Conrad where it was seen twelve minutes earlier. The officersaid the UFO was gaining altitude and appeared smaller. At 7:29 a.m., anotherofficer reported the object was still in view in the east. His sighting was the lastone reported during the hectic night. U.S. Air Force officials said the UFO seen in the Cascade-Eden area seemed tohave the same features as the one seen farther north, except at one time a flamecame from the bottom of the object, emitting small lightning bolt-type objects.This coincided with the description given earlier by the Vaughn man. This sketch was made by a Vaughn man of one of the two unidentifiedflying objects he saw as he was traveling on the interstate. He said the strange objectshad glowing domed tops and there were revolving blue and white lights on the bottom ofthe crafts.One UFO had lightning bolts coming out of the bottom of it at intervals. The man told lawofficers he observed the two craft for about five minutes. It was about dusk at the time."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Some Air Force personnel apparently got a good look at the object as theyreported that at one time their Air Force vehicle, which was in Cascade at thetime, was not more than a mile from the object. A woman who lives east ofGreat Falls near the Highwood Mountains also had a close-up view of anunidentified flying object. Her sighting was October 17, the evening before themany sightings that kept law officers so busy. Captain Wolverton interviewed the woman, who told of seeing a huge craft aslarge as a DC10 fly over her house about 10:30 p.m. She couldn't estimate itsaltitude, but said it was about as high as helicopters usually fly. She describedthe object as having lights all the way around it and said she could hear no noisefrom it. She watched it for about 30 seconds from a window of her mobilehome. The woman's neighbor said she did not see the craft herself, but her son did. Sheadded that the same evening between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m., she and fourother people saw something between her house and her neighbor's mobile home.She described it as a large green light with a white light behind it. She said itcame over a hill and down the valley by a haystack and then disappeared. thehuge size of the UFO coincided with a number of other reports from people whodescribed what they saw as being as large as a hotel.
