One of the many government documents is entitled UFOSighting At Rendlesham Forest and begins:\"We are aware that on 27 and 29 December 1980 a number of personnelfrom RAF (Royal Air Force) Woodbridge saw strange lights in the vicinityof the base, in Rendlesham Forest. \"Lt. Col. Charles Halt USAF, the Deputy Base Commander, submitted areport on these events, which was passed to the Ministry of Defence.\" Christmas week in December 1980 was a tense and confusing time for severaldozen men at the joint United States and English Royal Air Force Base atBentwaters near the southeastern coast of the British Isles. In the early morninghours of December 27 and 29 - and perhaps December 26 as well - odd lightswere seen moving in the Rendlesham forest. Various security and militarypersonnel investigated.The joint United States and British Royal Air Force Base at Bentwaters nearWoodbridge and the Rendlesham Forest on England's southeastern coast. USAF Lt. Col. Charles I. Halt, Bentwaters Deputy Base Commander, told StaffSergeant James Penniston, \"The reports will remain confidential and we shouldtreat the incident as Top Secret and not discuss it with anybody.\" Pennistonremembered being told there was radiation where the lights had been, a dosageequivalent to \"five or ten x-rays.\" (See Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II:High Strangeness for transcript of Jim Penniston's hypnosis session about the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Rendlesham Forest events, Earthfiles Shop.)

On thetape, the Colonel and other men describe lights as they move through the trees.The implication was that an unidentified and sophisticated technology had comedown in Rendlesham forest which could affect national security. Yet, the MOD'sdismissal of any national security concern can be found in several documents,including the following excerpt in the page entitled UFO Sighting AtRendlesham Forest: \"No evidence was found of any threat to the defence of the UnitedKingdom, and no further investigations were carried out. No furtherinformation has come to light which alters our view that the sightings ofthese lights was of no defence significance.\"Capel Green, a Rendlesham Forest field where an oval-shaped area was still discoloredin 1988 when former USAF Security Police officer, Larry Warren, returned to photographwhere he remembered a craft appeared during the December 1980 events.

However, todaywhen I talked with a Ministry of Defence FOI employee, she explained theevolution of the Rendlesham File release.Interview:Linda Unwin, Publication Scheme Unit, Directorate of Air Staff, Ministryof Defense, London, England: \"IS THIS THE FIRST RELEASE OF CLASSIFIED INFORMATION UNDERTHE NEW BRITISH 2000 FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT (FOI)?No, these papers were originally released in May 2001 under our Code ofPractice and Access to Government Information which is the forerunner to ourFreedom of Information Act 2000.THEN ARE THESE THE FIRST RELEASED PAGES SINCE THE FOI 2000IN BRITAIN?They weren't actually released under the Freedom of Information Act becausethat doesn't come into force in the UK until January 2005. These were releasedunder the Code of Practice and Access Government Information and then wereadded to the FOI Publication Scheme which went live for the first time on ourMOD website November 29.WAS THIS THEN A FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT INQUIRY IN THEUNITED STATES THAT LEAD TO THE MOD RELEASE? WAS THIS FROMAN AMERICAN INQUIRY?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"No, that has been incorrectly reported. The Halt report you are interested in,that one paper from the Rendlesham file, was requested by someone in Americain 1983 through the American government which was unable to find a copy.Your government asked the UK if we held a copy of it. It was then supplied byus to your government, who released it through your Freedom of InformationAct. So, the Halt report was released in 1983 under the U. S. Freedom ofInformation Act. The whole Rendlesham file was not released until May 2001 inthis country as a result of a request under the Code of Practice. And now it iswidely available because it is on the internet.SINCE 2001, IT REALLY HASN'T BEEN PUBLICIZED.No, not the whole file.IS THE ENTIRE RENDLESHAM FILE RELEASED IN THE 180 PAGES? ORARE SOME STILL RESTRICTED?No. That's the entire Rendlesham file.\" Unexplained Aerial PhenomenonIn March 1984, Britain's Sir Patrick Wall asked the Secretary of State forDefence how many people had reported alleged landings by unidentified flyingobjects between 1980 and 1983. The MOD's answer was that its files did notseparate out a category of alleged landings, but its numbers of reports ofunidentified flying objects were 350, 600, 250 and 390 - more than fifteenhundred in four years.More Information:February 23, 1981, Memo About \"Unexplained Lights\"and Radioactivity in Rendlesham ForestFebruary 23, 1981, memo entitled, \"Unexplained Lights\" from R.
