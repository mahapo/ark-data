(See: Earthfiles 12/8/01) Thismonth the journal Science published a report by the lead anthropologist anddiscoverer, Christopher Henshilwood, Ph.D., Adjunct Professor ofAnthropology at the State University of New York, Stony Brook, and the IzikoSouth African Museum in Cape Town.One of the remarkable finds, in addition to finely carved bone tools, are piecesof red ochre stone etched with X's. Some of the X's are placed between parallellines, all of which suggest intelligent design."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Engraved 70,000-year-old ochre stone from Blombos Cave, South Africa.

To count something? Or othercommunication? \"They symbolize something that clearly had meaning to thepeople who made them,\" answers Dr. Henshilwood. Whatever provoked thoseSouth African minds 70,000 years ago, there was also a large population ofNeanderthals living in Europe and Asia at the same time. The physical evidenceabout them indicates those ancient, thick-browed beings used tools, buried theirdead with ritual and had a language. Then suddenly about 40,000 years agothere was a dramatic and still unexplained change in the evolution ofhumanoids. Neanderthals died out and Cro-Magnon Homo sapiens sapiens roseup allegedly from Africa and took over the earth.The ochre and fine bone artifacts in Blombos Cave do not answer how thathappened, but show that modern human behavior was already in evidence inSouth Africa seventy thousand years ago."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Blombos Cave entrance 200 miles east of Cape Town, South Africa.Photograph courtesy National Science Foundation.More Information:See: Blombos Cave news report and other bone and ochre images at Earthfiles12/8/01.We b s it e s :http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/02/pr0202images.htmhttp://clasdean.la.asu.edu/news/images/boneCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
