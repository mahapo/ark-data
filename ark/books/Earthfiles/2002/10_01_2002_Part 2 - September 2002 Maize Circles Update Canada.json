Paul Anderson, Director of the Canadian Crop Circle ResearchNetwork (CCCRN) and I contacted the farm owner, Bobby Braich. Mr. Braichwondered from the condition of the plants if they had gone down even earlier atthe end of August. If so, it is strange that no one driving on the busy roadseparating the corn fields bothered to report the patterns before September 8.Mission, British Columbia pictograms in corn stalks on either side of highway.Aerial photographs taken on September 26, 2002 by Bill Dietrich and Alexander Burtonfor © 2002 by Paul Anderson, CCCRN, and Linda Moulton Howe."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Paul has been keeping records about Canadian crop formations for several yearsand says of the more than hundred formations in all the provinces, he has norecord of a pictogram pattern in maize before these two in Mission, BritishColumbia.Like Charles Mallett, Paul at first thought that any patterns in corn stalks musthave been produced in connection with the Hollywood thriller, Signs. But whenhe went there on September 22, to collect soil and plant samples forbiophysicist W. C. Levengood in Michigan, Paul was surprised to find the cornstalks splayed out as if \"a bomb had gone off in there,\" similar to the \"violentforce\" impression that Charles Mallett described in England.Paul Anderson talked with me after his investigation of the corn patterns inMission, British Columbia, about an hour east of Vancouver, British Columbia.Interview:Paul Anderson, Founder and Director, Canadian Crop Circle ResearchNetwork (CCCRN), Vancouver, B. C.: \"First of all, just to describe the kindof location, the fields are on each side of a busy highway. The fields are maybe20 to 25 feet below the road, so they are like in a valley of sorts on each side ofthe road.The highway coming into Mission, British Columbia an hour east of Vancouverseparates the two corn fields in which pictograms were reported on September 8, 2002.Photograph © 2002 by Paul Anderson, CCCRN."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"You have to go down a steep, if you go down into the fields from the highway,you have to go down a steep incline and then go through ten to twenty feet ofbramble bushes just to get to the field. The other way to get into them is to goaround to the opposite ends of the fields which we did, which is a lot easieraccess to get into them, except then that puts you approximately. severalhundred feet for each one away from the formation. So, then you have a longwalk you have to do through the corn field itself, which is what we did.We found that when you are walking through corn that is that tall , at least 9 to10 feet tall, you can lose your way pretty easily. It's hard to tell where you aregoing in terms of directions.Dave Pengilly, UFOBC, standing by 9-feet-tall standing cornwhile helping Paul Anderson sample plants and soil from Mission, B. C.pictograms on September 22, 2002. Photograph © 2002 by Paul Anderson.That's what Charles Mallett said, too, in England.That's exactly right. It was kind of like being in the SIGNS movie, you're walkingthrough the tall corn and then suddenly out in front of you, you have theseflattened areas that you walk into and it just kind of spreads out in front of you.That's exactly what it looked like.The first thing I noticed is that these were larger than the original estimates. Thefirst formation with the main circle in it, she estimated it to be 20 feet indiameter, actually turned out to be 60. And then the one long pathway, anL-shaped pathway coming off of one side of the circle, and a shorter curvedpathway coming off the opposite side. the longest pathway was approximately.45 meters or about 150 feet long, which was a fair size. It would rang as one ofthe largest formations we've had in Canada so far. Nancy Talbott was telling methese would be the largest formations known so far in corn fields. And we've hadthem in corn before in Canada, but not very I can think of one or two casesoffhand, but one was actually a random downed area from 1998. That was incorn in Ontario about the same height.But these were definite geometric patterns. There was no mistaking that whenyou saw them on the ground. One of the first things I did was go to the center ofthe main circle to inspect the center and didn't see any holes in the ground oranything like that. Nothing that looked like it had been disturbed too much.What I noticed about the plants themselves was a lot of them in fact, I would saymost of them were completely cut off, the stalks were completely cut off andlaying on the ground, completely like severed off. Some looked like they werebroken off, some looked almost like they had been cut off, like they had a fairlyclean, straight cut through the stalk."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Corn stalk cut off straight across stem about 12 inches above ground.Photograph © 2002 by Paul Anderson. How high above the soil were those clean, straight cuts?There were only a handful of stalks that I saw that looked like that and one inparticular that stood out. And that one I measured at about a foot and threeinches above the ground. And the stalk that was remaining, still standing firmlyin the ground, was still standing straight up. It didn't look like it had beentouched or bent over or knocked over or anything at all, still standing straightup, and yet the rest of it was just missing. But where the cut or break orwhatever you want to call it was, it was just like straight across and looked likesomeone had taken a knife and did that. Maybe they did, I don't know.A lot of the other stalks were just broken off and they looked like they werebroken more than I would expect from someone simply pushing them over,because they were like completely severed and just laying all over, like on theground, like the formation itself was generally clockwise lay, except with theexception that the stalks for the most part were completely severed from thebase.Some were broken off like that close to the ground, almost at the ground. Otherones, again like these other ones, were broken off as much as a foot or foot anda half above the ground. So, it was all kind of mixed. And then there were a fewother isolated ones I did find that were curved over close to the ground and thenlaying flat on the ground like that, but not broken. So, it was all kind of mixed.Some like this and some like that. and you would have some right beside eachother. There would be one broken completely off and one beside it that was justcurved over and not broken."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"All photographs of smoothly bent corn stalks like this one above, mixed with cutand bent over stalks © 2002 by Paul Anderson, CCCRN.Would you say that what you were looking at in either of the formations inMission could fall into the category of violent energy applied?That's a good question. That is a term I guess you could use for this certainlylooking at it. Again, going back the description I gave for the first formationapplied pretty much to the second one as well, even though that one was almosttwice as large as the first one. It was there wasn't any radial lay in either one ofthese. It was all just in both of them in the main circle just clockwise lay andthen in the pathways themselves, just straight lay, straight down to the groundgoing out away from the circle respective to each formation.But the way that the plants were all a lot of people would look at this and say,'Obviously, it was kids with planks doing this.' And yet, the way a lot of theplants were either broken off or completely snapped off, that might be a gooddescription (violence) to use because whatever , who or whatever did this, musthave used a fair amount of force. I would definitely say that just because when"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"you had stalks that were completely cut off, whether just at the ground or a footand a half above the ground like other ones, this laying, thrown onto the groundlike match sticks kind of thing yeah, I think that would be a good description,actually.Violence, violent energy?Ye a h . Corn Formations Added To LaterWe heard from another witness who actually lives in another town a bit furthereast from Mission and from the land owner himself, who also told us that theyfelt the formations had appeared approximately two weeks before September 8when first reported to us. So it could have been mid to late August sometimewhen they were actually created.But what also happened is that on September 20, the first woman who reportedthem to us then e-mailed me back to say the second formation had additions toit. And sure enough, when we went back out there to take a look, that's when ithad another much longer and much larger pathway added to it which is whatmade the formation as long as it is at 284 feet total length. The pathway itselfwas 149 feet long and 29 feet wide.The one that had been added?Yeah. Whatever or whoever did these, went to some effort, especially in 9 foottall corn. There wasn't a lot of publicity about these. Never heard of anything inthe local media, or anything like that yet.That's what the farmer told me - that no one had done a story. Therehadn't been anything in a newspaper. I find that amazing.I do, too. That's another aspect of this I find a bit puzzling these were two verylarge formations sitting out there in full view. When you're going along this roadand over that bridge, you can't miss them. It's not like you're looking directlydown on them and yet they extend out enough they are in full view. In all thistime since they were first reported by the other woman, she is the only one whoever reported them to us, or to anyone for all we know! There are people goingby all the time. People must be seeing them, and yet nobody even bothers toreport them to anyone.We're in a remarkable situation in which something from the unseen couldbe doing some of the patterns in the cereal crops of the world, but humansare being conditioned by humans to not pay attention.Yes, it's strange. I think, too, that a lot of people assumed it had something to dowith the movie. In the movie the formation was in corn, also. I can understandthat people driving by see these things in the corn and they assume it hassomething to do with the SIGN movie. It is possible that this was a prank doneby kids or whoever as a result because of the movie. But we don't know that forsure and that's why I'm anxious to get the testing back from Dr. Levengood onthese.\"Continued in Part 3More Information:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Measurement diagrams of the Mission, B.
