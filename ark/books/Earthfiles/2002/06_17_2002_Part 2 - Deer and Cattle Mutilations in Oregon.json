It's also where fourteen dead calves and a pig with its legscut off were found in March 1999. The circled X marks the area where eyewitness DwainWright saw mutilated bull and where a cowboy described having seen glowing discsthat lifted cattle up in glowing beams and dropped them back downthrough the trees in late 1970s to early 1980s. Christmas Valley Cattle Mutilations:June 17, 2002 Christmas Valley, Oregon Christmas Valley, Oregon is aboutsix hours northeast by car from Applegate Valley where the doe was found deadand mutilated by Dwain Wright. On Monday, June 10th, Lake County DeputySheriff Keith Bumpass showed field investigator and writer, Jean Bilodeaux,another mutilation about six miles from where the large 2400 pound bull wasfound dead and mutilated on May 5. (See Earthfiles 05/15/02) The name of themutilated cow's owner is withheld at his request. In the interviews below, firstDeputy Bumpass describes the mutilated cow discovered two weeks after thebull's unusual death, but thought to have been killed around May 11 based onranchers' experiences with deterioration in other dead animals.Jean Bilodeaux has been to several mutilation sites in northern California andOregon and discusses in Part 3 her observations of the bull she and the deputywent back to, plus another mutilated cow from December 2001 and a thirdlong-horn bovine that the rancher said died in early spring 2002. The two oldermutilations are still well preserved without predation."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Mutilated cow beneath big juniper tree discovered May 18, 2002,but estimated to have been dead since around May 11, 2002.

The cow was laying underneath a bigjuniper tree, one of the larger ones we have around here. The head was facingsouthward and it was laying on its right side.Cow laying mutilated beneath large juniper branchwithout surrounding tracks or signs of being dragged under the tree.The land was not being used to pasture cows. Photograph © 2002by Keith Bumpass, Lake County, Oregon Sheriff's Deputy.I noticed that the anal area had been really cored out big, a lot bigger than theother one (the bull) and went way up inside quite a ways. The udder area wasmissing all the way up into the lower hip area and between the legs, also quite aways. Also, the cow is actually sitting on its own tail. One thing that I havefound out since is a cow will not lay on its own tail at all. I didn't know thisuntil talking with some ranchers recently and the photographs definitely showthe tail curved under her body.As if she had been set down there on her tail while unconscious.Right. The farmers have told me there is no way you can make a cow do that.They just don't lay down on their tails."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Large, empty holes where rectum and and udder had been. Oddly,the cow was laying on its tail which ranchers say cows will not do on their own,suggesting the cow was not conscious when it was laid under the juniper tree.Photograph © 2002 by Keith Bumpass, Lake County, Oregon Sheriff's Deputy.Its left eye was gone completely through so you could see inside the skull area.the only thing that had been around it was some buzzards. No flies on it.Nothing had ripped any flesh off at all. No human foot marks. No tire tracks. Ilooked for drag marks. Maybe one of the farmers had found it and dragged itunderneath the tree. I did ask the ranch owner if he did do that and he said, 'No,found it just like that.' I took pictures of the area there. No drag marks, no footmarks, no anything.The cow's ears were there, but the left eye was removed;the tongue was removed deep within the throat; the udder was removedand the rectal/vaginal area was cored out deeply 8-9 inches wide and deep.Photograph © 2002 by Keith Bumpass, Lake County, Oregon Sheriff's Deputy.There seems to be a lot of sticks and debris right around where theanimal's head is that look undisturbed.Yes. In fact, that cow shouldn't have been out there where it was. The rancherwas not pasturing that area with his cattle. He doesn't use that pasture at all untilthe fall.Sticks and debris around mutilated cow's body appear undisturbedand Deputy Bumpass could not find any tracks or drag marks, nor signs the cow hadever moved its legs in a death struggle.

Just the dead and mutilated cow under the true.How long do you think that cow had been dead?Inside the udder area the sac that holds one of the stomachs there, the main one,the grass itself had lots of water in it. That shouldn't have been there if the cowhad been there for a long time. So we're guessing that cow died about a week orso before May 18.If you subtract seven days from the 18th, you would be at approimatelyMay 11 which would be about a week after the big bull was found.Yes, pretty close to that time. I showed the cow's owner some of the mutilationpictures from your books. He said, 'Yep, I've had animals like that back in the1980s and this year, two more cows up on the hill on the Derrick Ranch, theanal areas were missing also. But another deputy and I went up there and bothof those animals were eaten down to bone. So, we didn't think they were like thebull and this cow that have laid out here with nothing touching them for so long.And, man, we've got a lot of coyotes and other predators out here that arealways hungry! Again, I was just by the cow and bull a couple of days ago andnothing has eaten on these animals.What was amazing about this cow, though, is how it was underneath the bigbranches. That kind of baffled me because if it had been dropped from the sky,none of the branches up above the juniper where the cow was at were broken atall. No signs of it. Everything was full length. What got me is with no footprints,how did this cow get underneath these big limbs?Right. In looking at the photos, the legs look like they have settled into theground without a single bit of movement by the legs, no signs of deathstruggle, no signs of disturbance of any kind around the animal in thephotos.The photos don't do enough justice. If that cow was standing up on its feet, thereis a big branch right underneath it. The branch would actually be pushing on thecow's back. So for the cow to walk underneath there would be extremelyuncomfortable for that cow where she was laying. I was scratching my head onthat one.Again, there were no footprints around the whole area. No footprints even fromthe cow where it was standing there and fell over. You can easily see footprintsabout 20 or 30 feet away, you can see where lots of cows have been throughthere and you can see old footprint marks. But nothing where the cow was at.Even at the end of the hooves laying there, there are no depressions at all.Strange.Also, the tongue was out. I didn't mention that. The tongue was removed wayback in the back. I think all the teeth were there, though.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Tongue removed deep within cow's throat, leaving a cry cavity.Photograph © 2002 by Keith Bumpass, Lake County, Oregon Sheriff's Deputy.Continued in Part 3 with Jean Bilodeaux.More Information:See my book Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness inEarthfiles Shop for more information about unusual animal deaths linked toglowing aerial objects and beams of light in the Sand Springs, Oregon area northof Christmas Valley.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
