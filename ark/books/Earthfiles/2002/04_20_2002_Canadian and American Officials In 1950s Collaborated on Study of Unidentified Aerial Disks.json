They are a hundred feet or more in diameter; theycan travel at speeds of several thousand miles per hour; they can reachaltitudes well above those, which would support conventional aircraft orballoons; and ample power and force seem to be available for all requiredmanoeuvres. Taking these factors into account, it is difficult to reconcile thisperformanc with the capabilities of our technology, and unless thetechnology of some terrestrial nation is much more advanced than isgenerally known, we are forced to the conclusion that the vehicles areprobably extraterrestrial, in spite of our prejudices to the contrary.”- From an August 1952, classified report to Project Magnetfor Canada's Department of Transportation, by Wilbert B. Smith,Project Magnet Director, DOT, Ottawa April 20, 2002 Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada - Unknown to Canadian and Americancitizens during the Eisenhower administration of the early 1950s, the Project MagnetDirector of Canada's Department of Transport was working intimately with the highestoffices in military, intelligence and the White House in Washington, D. C. WilbertBrockhouse Smith was an engineer who organized Project Magnet, Canada's officialinvestigation of the “flying saucers” and the theory that their mode of propulsion utilizedthe magnetic fields of the earth and solar system.Not only was Wilbert Smith studying the physics of the craft, he was trying to communicatewith whoever, or whatever, might be in them. That lead Wilbert Smith to tryexperimentation with radio signals, other technology, and even telepathy through thechaneling of an Elliot, Maine housewife named Frances Swan. As it turned out, Mrs. Swanlived only a few miles from the couple, Betty and Barney Hill, who were abducted in 1961while driving through the White Mountains of New Hampshire.Wilbert Brockhouse Smith, born in Lethbridge, Alberta, Canadain 1910 and died on December 27, 1962 of cancer. He received his M. S.in electrical engineering from the University of British Columbia and workedfor Canada's Department of Transport (DOT) as a radio engineer, was the directorof ionospheric measurement stations across Canada and the director of ProjectMagnet which studied the physics of flying discs in the 1950s."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"At the same time that Wilbert Smith was meeting with American and Canadian officials tostudy technology and the messages coming from the non-humans, Dwight D. Eisenhowerwas continuing Harry S. Truman's MJ-12 Special Studies Group on extraterrestrial vehiclesand biological entities. Below is a November 4, 1953 SECRET memorandum fromPresident Eisenhower to the Director of Central Intelligence, who in 1953 would have beenAllen W. Dulles.Page 1 of two-page document received in late 2001 byBob and Ryan Wood in their on-going investigation of MJ-12.See: http://www.majesticdocuments.com.Page 2 of November 4, 1953 Eisenhower memo to Director ofCentral Intelligence about MJ-12/Special Studies Project.Interview:Grant Cameron, Canadian Researcher of Wilbert Brockhouse Smith, Director ofCanada's Department of Transportation and Head of Project MAGNET, Canada'sOfficial Investigation of Unidentified Aerial Disks in the 1950s: “President Truman andEisenhower both depended on scientist Vannevar Bush, an MJ-12 participant, to overseethe scientific retrievals and analysis of the extraterrestrial craft and entities. For the pasttwo decades Canadian researcher Grant Cameron has been collecting documents,transcripts and other materials about Wilbert Smith's communications with Canadian andAmerican government officials, including a link to Vannevar Bush."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"MJ-12's Vannevar Bushand Canadian Engineer, Wilbert SmithWhat we know about the connection between Vannevar Bush and Wilbert Smith is thatVannevar Bush was shown the concept of the geomagnetic propulsion. And we know thatan article that was written by Maj. Donald Keyhoe was re-written by Wilbert Smith.Wilbert Smith disagreed with Keyhoe's conclusions about what the Canadians were doing.this article was sent for clearance with, to Dr. Bush for clearance, whether this article couldbe made public.As to whether they ever talked, we do know that Smith was given access to the bodies andto the craft. Now, whether that was Bush or some of Bush's people, I really don't know atthis point. It was confirmed by his son and some of his inner circle people were rumoringthis for years that the bodies and the craft so Wilbert would have to have been at the levelof MJ-12 or Vannevar Bush or something to have been given access. This did occur outsideof Washington where the bodies and craft were seen and that's where Bush was stationed,in Washington, D. C.And it could have been some place like Andrews AFB?That's what I thought. I could probably clear it up. But it was stated right outsideWashington, D. C. And that story goes back, the first time I heard that was in themid-1970s. And there's also an interesting story connected to that which sort of ties in thefact that this is all very true was a story in a book 20 years ago that Silas Newton who wasone of the key people in the Frank Scully book had stated this bizarre thing that he hadseen the bodies himself and he had been given clearance to see the bodies by WilbertSmith. That's a very strange thing. And the book (Scully's) was seen as a hoax and Newtonwas seen as a big part of the hoax. And yet the strange thing is: why would an Americanclaim to see the bodies and then say that some Canadian gave him access to the bodies?You would normally pick a U. S. high official if you're going to make a story up.That sort of confirms the fact that Smith did have this very high level access. And up to1954. After 1954, he still had access to Canadian labs for running his experiments, but theCanadian Government. was getting pretty embarrassed by all the leaks that were happeninginside the program and they shut it down and I don't know if his access to highly classifiedmaterial was as great after 1954 was as great after 1954 as it was before when he wasDirector of Project MAGNET, the official project of the Canadian government.To study the aerial vehicles.To study what he called \"flying saucers.\" Wilbert Smith almost never used the word UFO.He always used the words \"flying saucers,\" \"craft\" he never got into using this bizarre wordthat could mean anything. He seemed to know the reality and he always referred to themwhat they were - flying saucers, crafts, spaceships, but never used the word UFOs. Wilbert Smith Shown Non-Human Craft and BodiesIn the papers you are studying, if he was shown these bodies of some taken out ofcraft, what was the physical description he gave in terms of hair color and skin color,eye color and so forth?All that was told to me by his son - and this is where we get the story confirmed - that whenhe (Wilbert Smith) was dying, he had cancer, and he was not too happy with how he hadbeen treated by the Canadian government. and he didn't really talk about it until just beforehe was dying and his son went to him and asked him some of these questions. And he said,'This is under the Official Secrets Act, but there is nothing they can really do anymore.'And he described them as typical of the descriptions of the time: that they weren't Greys.They were small people, looked like us, but very small people. That was the onlydescription as to hair color. It's the same sort of idea that he had when a number of times hedescribed the aliens as people who could fit in on the street. And the only differencebetween the bodies he had seen and the description he gave of the aliens is that they weresmall people.Why do you suppose there is that discrepancy with Mrs. Swan's description of a manwho was 6 feet tall?Yeah, that is a problem. Even Smith's own description that they could fit in on the street. Iguess the key is that the bodies were not Greys. A number of people have interpreted therewas one story going on that Mrs. Smith had described the aliens as Greys. But when we'vechecked, and this is from three different sources about the bodies, and it was human type,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"or humanoid. The metallurgist used the word, 'humanoid types,' like us. Different Extraterrestrial Typesfrom 1940s to 1960s and BeyondPart of the confusion could be that Betty and Barney Hill, abducted in the WhiteMountains of New Hampshire in 1961, lived only a few miles from Mrs. Swan inMaine which involved some form of Greys. That may have colored public discussion.But Mrs. Swan herself described AFFA as about 6 feet all, light skinned, dark haired,dark eyed. But Wilbert Smith said his alien contacts were small, human-like people.That description reminds me of the drawing and description of Frank Kaufmann, nowdeceased, who said he was on a security detail at a crashed disk site in New Mexico in1947 in which bodies were somewhat child-like.What I've always seen is a transition in ufology where you go from the Blonds - if you wantto call them that, or the human types - to the Greys. That after Betty and Barney Hill areabducted, then suddenly in ufology you see the blond or brown-haired humanoid types sortof disappear from the literature and the Greys seemed to take over.To bring up an interesting point: I asked Mrs. Swan that. I had always seen that as atransition between the Blonds and the Greys, if you want to call them Blonds. And the factthat these two women lived so close together and the fact that when Mrs. Hill wasabducted, NICAP even called in Mrs. Swan to talk to her. Mrs. Swan immediately said, 'I'mnot talking to this woman. She's in contact with the Evil Ones. I'm in contact with the GoodOnes. And I will not talk to this woman.'And now you take it 30 or 40 years ahead, now you have the predominant impression ofthe Greys is the evil aspect of them, where you never got that in the 1950s. They werealways seen as good guys here to save us and this sort of thing.I asked Mrs. Swan this in a letter. I said that I heard a story that the Greys were trying totake over the Blonds. And she said, 'Absolutely no. They tried to take over the Blonds. Andshe goes into this whole reaffirmation of the fact that there are good ones and evil ones andthat the Greys are trying to kill the Blonds and you have this sort of war between the aliens.And in terms of when she taught, in 1959, this Navy intelligence officer who was sent fromthe Director of Naval Intelligence to talk to her, she taught him how to do this. And whenhe wrote out the message, it was also signed in automatic writing and signed AFFA as well.But when she saw the signature, she said: 'This is not AFFA. This is one of the Evil Ones.'She told this fellow that this was not AFFA, 'you are dealing with Evil Ones, you have tostop this.' And he was so impressed by what he had done, that he was able to do this, hewent running off to the CIA to a high person in the CIA and showed them how to do this.And 20 years later which is sort of confirmed by Mrs. Swan to me and is also in a numberof articles, this fellow is still dealing with this AFFA he was in contact with and was literallygoing out of his mind. He said, 'They are here in the middle of the night. I can't get rid ofthem.\" They had destroyed his entire life.And when I asked Mrs Swan about whether this fellow had been in contact with her after20 years, she said, 'Yes, and I warned him he was in contact with the Evil Ones and hewouldn't listen to me. And now, it's too late. Now, he's in trouble.' So this concept of theBlonds changing to the Greys around the time of Betty Hill and the idea of the Good andEvil Ones is sort of epitomized by these two women who lived so close to each other andwho lived very close to two prominent nuclear sites: one being the Portsmouth NavalShipyard where the second atomic submarine was berthed and developed. And Pease AFBwhich was a nuclear base where the Strategic Air Command (SAC), if they were going tomove weapons up the coast, it would go Pease AFB and then Goose Bay, Labrador andthen over across the ocean if they were going to go to Russia. So, there were these twovery close nuclear connections. In fact, the Pease AFB was the one involved with the BettyHill case, picking it up on radar and she dealt with people at Pease AFB.You have all these significant connections in this very small area along the Maine/NewHampshire border. Government Concern About“Mental Phenomenon” of the Non-Humans"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"November 21, 1950 Canadian Department of Transport 2-page Intra-DepartmentalCorrespondence originally classified TOP SECRET about Geo-Magnetics.Paragraph excerpted from second page of DOT Memo about Geo-Magnetics.Apparently a difference between the good and evil comes back again to 'mentalphenomenon' that was listed in that Top Secret document. The Navy guy was beingaffected by what Mrs. Swan called the 'Evil Ones' who intruded upon his sleep, werein his mind, in his work and were driving him crazy.Yeah, and this was 20 years later that he came to her for help. He said, 'I can't get rid ofthem. They are in my sleep. I can't stop it.' He came to her in the 1970s, he came back toher for help, whether she could help him stop this from happening.Do you know what happened? How did she deal with such a situation?'No, I just told him it was too late.' That's what she wrote to me in a letter. 'He didn't knowhow to quit. At last he was asking for help.'Oh, yeah, she said, 'I told him how. But I think he was too late.'But it doesn't detail what she told him to do?No. The surprising thing with Mrs. Swan. There are two things so significant with her is thatshe picked up these 1954 satellites which was one story. But the other was the fact thatwhen she corresponded with me, she looked like she had a grade three education. Youcould barely read what she was writing. Everything was misspelled. I think one of thethings that impressed people I think the CIA dealt with her for a number of years, andNaval Intelligence for a number of years, FBI, the White House, there were a whole bunchof people involved with this woman. And what sort of impressed everyone was that shewas able to answer highly technical questions.For example, Arthur Lundahl who was the fellow who discovered the missiles in Cuba andwho briefed Pres. Kennedy on the missiles in Cuba, was asking questions of this Navyintelligence officer through this channeling thing and they were able to answer highlytechnical questions: like what is the orbit of Jupiter? How many miles are we from Jupiter?Highly technical questions.So, when they went in to talk with Mrs. Swan, they would ask her these series of questionsand I guess everybody was just sort of taken aback that she could answer mathematical andastronomical questions that were way beyond her ability to comprehend. This was one ofthe reasons why they were so interested in the fact that this woman actually was talking toaliens."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The interpretation might be that AFFA was somewhere either invisible in the room ora craft and could telepathically place this information in her mind?Yes. Some people called it sort of sound off/sound on device. There were a number ofdescriptions of this, but it was basically coming some how telepathically to her and asopposed to Wilbert Smith who used other techniques like radios, which is his expertisetrying to draw up a system there. But this was a basic, simple, almost like a medium type ofthing. Mrs. Swan Knows About MysteriousSatellites of Unknown OriginCan you please explain what happened about Mrs. Swan telling our governmentabout satellites of unknown origin orbiting this planet?OK, what happened is that in late 1953, the U. S. Air Force with their experimental longrange radar picked up two objects circling the earth: one was at 400 miles out; one was 600miles out. And it sent the Pentagon into a state of panic that these huge objects were goingaround the earth. They set up a number of stations to try to monitor this. And spent a lot ofmoney on it. They went all the way through 1954, they were tracking these objects untilAviation Week and Space Technology broke the story that they (U. S. govt.) was actuallymonitoring these objects.And Mrs. Swan's connection was as I stated before: in the fall of 1953 and the Halloweenparty, she started this contact with this AFFA. And in April 1954, she started getting themessages. And in May 1954, Admiral Knowles who lived close to both Betty and BarneyHill and Mrs. Swan was approached by Mrs. Swan saying, 'I'm getting these messages.'He started sending letters to the various agencies. He sent one to the Senator in Maine. Hesent one to the White House. He sent one to Naval Intelligence. And what he detailed inthe letter is that this woman was talking to two commanders of alien spacecraft that werecircling the earth,.So, the Americans became very interested, all the various agencies, in the fact that thiswoman was talking to two spacecraft going around the earth which was still secret. It wasnot open until August 1954 when Aviation Week and Space Technology broke the story.Even then in 1954, our government knew there was something orbiting the earth onradar, origin unknown?The Air Force was tracking them. They had White Sands Missile Range tracking them,trying to photograph these objects. They had a station outside Berlin, Germany trying totrack and photograph these objects. they were doing everything in their power to figure outwhat these objects were.The implication was even in Donald Keyhoe's books that they had suddenly picked upextraterrestrial satellites or probes orbiting our planet.Yeah. And they knew they weren't, one of the stories put out when the story broke (inAviation Week) was that they were probably just natural asteroids or satellites that hadbeen picked up by the earth's natural magnetic field. But Keyhoe's Air Force sources werestating that these things were not in orbit all the time. They would lose them. They couldn'ttrack them for very long, they would leave orbit. That would naturally indicate they werenot natural asteroids captured by the earth's magnetic field.They knew right from the word go that these were some sort of craft and it tied in with thefact that Mars was approaching and UFO sightings always went up as they did in the 1952flap which was at the closest approach of Mars. So, there was this panic going on. Thenyou get this woman out of Maine who suddenly is talking to two commanders flying giantspacecraft around the earth and they immediately they figure this woman is talking towhoever is flying these two objects we have picked up. And I think that is one of the keyreasons that the CIA and Naval Intelligence and the White House and all these differentpeople were so extremely interested in what this woman was saying (Mrs. Swan).Because they knew that she was describing what they had classified as one of thehighest secrets in the government.Yes. And there were a lot of tie ins. She seemed to know a lot of things that hadn't beenmade public yet. And I guess they went there to find out why she had this information orhow she was getting the information."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Did Mrs. Swan say specifically what these objects were?She described them as spacecraft. One she identified as M-4 which was commanded byAFFA, which is the same alien that was in contact with Wilbert Smith who was gettingdifferent messages from. And George Hunt Williamson, a famous contactee in the 1950swas in contact with AFFA.The other spaceship was known as L-11 and it was commanded, according to Mrs. Swan,by an alien by the name of Ponar. And she described them as, I'm not certain of the exactsize, but it was 150 miles across, just huge objects. And later in the 1950s, she describedthem as moving out to behind the moon. When Smith described in some of hiscorrespondence that the base, AFFA's base, was on the moon.On the back side of the moon.I don't know if they described the front or the back side, but he said there was a base on themoon, that's where AFFA was basing his earth operations out of.Now, what happened to the satellites, we really don't know. Whether they were able tocover it all up - we had stories, for example, that these huge objects were coming downover Washington. This was according to Major Keyhoe. And right over the Pentagon wherethey were tracking these objects and there was nothing they could do. The objects were up,the big object was up at 90,000 feet, and they scrambled the jets and they just flew aroundin circles underneath it and it was flying back and forth between Baltimore and Washingtonand they were able to cover up sightings on the 5th, 6th and 13th of May and on June the10th, the object came back at 79,000 feet. They couldn't, the Nike missiles couldn't reachthat high. The planes couldn't get there. And there was a lot of panic in 1954 over thesesatellites. There were numerous - Dorothy Kilgallen, the famous columnist, had written inFebruary of 1954 that her sources were telling her that the situation with the flying saucershad become so serious that they were going to gather all the world military leaders togetherin the summer of 1954 to discuss the problem. Most people have interpreted that as flyingsaucer sightings. But it doesn't make much sense that you would gather all the worldmilitary leaders to discuss flying saucer sightings and it indicated it might have to do withthose two satellites. Extraterrestrial Agendas On EarthWhat did the humanoid aliens tell Wilbert Smith and Mrs. Swan about what theywere doing with satellites and craft flying around the planet?They were basically the same content of messages that all the 1950s contacts had and itdealt very much with the fact that we are messing up the environment with atomic bombs.For example, they had an alien called Tyla who I was told was an alien called the 'garbagecollector.' He was flying around and mopping up radioactive fallout from the tests that werebeing done by the Americans and Russians.How would they do that?It was never described. But I was told the person who was in contact with the alien and thefact that this alien would be seen flying around - I think Smith in one of his letters refers tothe fact that this Tyla is flying around and cleaning up. And there was one interesting story- for example, it was told to me by one of the people who ran one of the big UFO groups.He told me he had talked to Smith and one of the messages that AFFA had given him wasthis idea of non-intervention. They would only step in if things actually got out of control.Otherwise, we were here to learn our own lessons and things will go the way they go. Wehave to learn on our own and they can't come here and do our homework for us. And whatthey had said was: if there was going to be a nuclear exchange - this is what AFFA toldSmith - they would step in. And if the world didn't believe they could do it, AFFA wouldtake the moon, split the moon in half in front of the entire world, and put it back together inmicroseconds to prove they could stop a nuclear exchange.That was basically almost the entire message that Smith had from the aliens - the atomicbomb tests had to stop and that we were on the verge of not only destroying our world, butthe harmony of the entire universe.It centered around the atomic thing - that they were here to monitor and control this. Forexample, AFFA on a number of occasions is described as being in the Pacific fixing faults.The fault lines had become unstable due to the fact that we were doing all this atomictesting. The interesting thing about that is it's plate tectonics, that at that time, people didnot know there were fault lines on the ocean floor and one of the people who developedthe theory of plate tectonics was a fellow by the name of Dr. Tuzo Wilson who later was"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the President of the Univ. of Toronto in Canada who was described by Major Keyhoe asone of Wilbert Smith's associates on this Project MAGNET, which was the officialCanadian project that Smith was running. We tried to talk to him (Dr. Wilson).He refused to talk to us or be interviewed and it's very strange that you have AFFAdescribed on a number of occasions being in the Pacific fixing these fault lines. And youhave Tyla flying around cleaning up the radiation. And they are basically here just sort ofkeeping things stable and trying to talk to people about the fact that we've got to stop goingdown this nuclear road.Did you ever ask Mrs. Swan about different alien types and what their differentagendas might be?I asked her that a number of times because I was always interested in this transition ofufology between the Good Ones and Evil Ones, the Blonds and the Greys, or whatever youwant to call them. I asked her, 'What is the difference between the Blonds and the Greys?'And I hoped she would go into the whole rendition of what each is doing and all she saidwas: 'It's very simple. The good ones work for God and the bad ones work for the Devil.Read your Bible.' So she would never elaborate on that. A number of times she said, 'Youreally don't understand what is going on, do you?' She would make little comments. I onlyhad two letters and she made a number of comments in those two letters. She would sendmy original letter back and just sort of write stuff in the margins. But she was very Biblicalin the way she looked at this sort of stuff. I don't think the people like the NavalIntelligence and CIA and those people looked at it in Biblical senses. They were after veryhard technical data they were trying to get out of her. And she even described, 'Everyonewas in this for their own thing. All Wilbert ever asked me about was how they flew. Andeveryone had their own little interest. And my friends wanted me to ask AFFA questions.'To her, it was very annoying, all these different people coming with different things theywanted AFFA to answer.Her impression was very simple: they were here to save us and these Greys came along andtried to take over the Blonds and knew right from the word go when she was asked to talkwith Betty Hill that these were evil little people and she wasn't going to have anything to dowith them and they came from the Devil. That was her impression.Did you ever ask her whether there was any truth to our government having analliance with greys, working elbow to elbow with them on technology in laboratories?No, she would never go into that. The only question I asked her about the government, andthis came from some for the articles that were done in the late 1970s in the interviews thatpeople had done with her - I asked her about a story that had gone around that she had analliance with the government, that she had agreed with the government. to cooperate in herstudy of her. I asked her if that were true and she said, 'Yes, there was an agreement to bestill,' is the word I think she used. An agreement to be still. She didn't elaborate on it. Shejust confirmed that she had been working with the government. as they studied her.Implying the U. S. government asked Mrs. Swan not to talk with anyone.Exactly. That was the story and that was the question I put to her, that the story was goingout that she had been told to keep quiet and they were talking to her and she confirmedthat. That was true. President Dwight D. Eisenhower -Meetings In Oval Office About Extraterrestrial PresenceAny direct links to President Eisenhower?The one very interesting story I worked on was the involvement of Pres. Eisenhower in thewhole affair. One of the people that Vice Admiral Knowles sent a letter to was thePresident of the United States. When I was at the Eisenhower Library in 2000 I went thereand I was looking for this letter. I was given the transfer sheet of the letter that was sentand the letter dealt with Mrs. Swan and the fact that she was talking to these two objectsmoving around the earth. And there were some of the actual messages, the automaticwriting that were attached to this letter, which is mostly what I wanted to see since I knewwhat the story was. I was given a transfer sheet that showed the letter had been transferredafter a month. It had been held in the White House for a month and then transferred to theSecret Service.There was a dispute with the Eisenhower Library about getting this transfer sheet, whetherI should have been told it existed and all this kind of stuff. But, anyway, when I trackedanother fellow who had been interviewed at the time of the satellites, a Capt. Orville, who"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"was - he had a post under Eisenhower - I came across a meeting that had taken place onJune 10, 1954 in the Oval Office. The fellow, this Orville, it was the only time he had anycontact with the President at all. And this is now, they held this letter for a month, and Iasked the Asst. Director of the Eisenhower Library if this was standard policy. Because hewas giving me the story that, 'Well, the reason this letter is probably transferred to theSecret Service was they considered the person crazy or a threat to the president.' I said ifthe person was crazy, they would have transferred it in the first hour and if the person iscrazy, why would you hold the letter for a month?He agreed with me that this was not standard White House policy to hold a letter for amonth. And it all lead to this meeting at 11:15 a.m. on June 10, 1954 where this Orville wasin the office. He had never written the president, he had never talked to the president onthe phone. He had one contact and that was one meeting in the Oval Office. And hisconnection is that he had done a big interview about the satellites and basically confirmedthat the government. was probably covering this up and this was probably realistic to saythese were not natural objects rotating around the earth.The other two people who turned out to be in the meeting were Donald Quarles who is theguy who was in charge of the Air Force Research and Development when they discoveredthese two satellites and was an expert on satellites and had briefed the National SecurityCouncil on satellites. The other person was Alan Waterman who was a National ScienceFoundation expert on satellites and you had all these experts on satellites in the Oval Officeon exactly the same day that they transferred this letter after holding it for a month.So, it seemed to indicate that even the White House took this whole Swan thing seriously.We're still working on that, trying to recover the letter and trying to get any otherdocumentation we can about what happened in this Oval Office meeting. But to me it wasa significant point that the White House even took interest in this woman who was justbasically a housewife in Elliot, Maine who just one day started getting messages. The nextthing you know, there were probably 8 U. S. agencies who were watching this woman andstudying her and dealing with her and some very high ranking people. For example, thehead of Naval Intelligence; J. Edgar Hoover, Head of FBI; the President of the U. S.;Arthur Lundahl who was the guy who ran the most highly classified lab in the country thatanalyzed all the U-2 photographs for the CIA; very high ranking people were dealing withthis woman, not just low level people in different agencies.Dwight D. Eisenhower was obviously getting briefings about her.It would appear that he would have gotten a briefing, especially at that time. What they didwith it? We know for example in the late 1940s a fellow named Stewart Alsop who was asyndicated columnist had written a story about the two satellites. And he had stated thathigh ranking sources that he had inside the government and inside the National SecurityCouncil had confirmed to him that these objects were not natural objects and thegovernment was watching them. And shortly after that, a week or two later, he wroteanother article that said Robert Cutler who was the Secretary at the National SecurityCouncil who was Pres. Eisenhower's National Security advisor, was so angry at the factthat the story about these two objects rotating the earth was leaking out and the fact theywere not natural objects, that the people who worked with him according to Stewart Alsop,the syndicated columnist, stated that he had been told the people who worked with himwere afraid to be seen with him. He was so angry.I recovered a letter at one time - Robert Cutler was fanatical about security. It was his keything he worked on, secrecy and security. And so you have a situation where the story isleaking and they are desperately trying to stop it.Through Bob and Ryan Wood's efforts, we now have documents with a Dwight D.Eisenhower signature space talking about MJ-12 and implications of great concernthat the technology and the intelligence behind it could be a national security threat.Right. The more you look, you can find a reference that it was considered a severe threat,that this could be an invasion. Like when they picked up the first satellites, they were big.If you take a look at the military mind, they would say, 'Well, this isn't exactly an alien andhis wife and kids on a holiday. This is a big object. This is like they are bringing the 8thArmy with them.'So, the military mind would see an invasion, the same as we see now - the possible invasionof terrorism. Everything you have to do that you can to try to stop this. Someone is coming,they are trying to attack us. And that's the way it appeared in the 1950s these things wereseen, especially as it related to these huge objects rotating around the earth. High Strangeness of Non-Human"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Technology and EntitiesIs there anything in Wilbert Smith's letters that indicate he was especially shocked orstunned by any of the alien artifacts he studied?In his description of the whole thing, he said it was basically like looking through a keyholeinto another world and then having to try to describe it. But his description was that thisstuff is so far beyond anything that we have. For example, he talked about crashedhardware and he said 'it might as well be in the 4th Dimension for what it's worth.' It wassort of like somebody a thousand years ago finding a 747. He said it was just so faradvanced that we are not even close to understanding this and that's where he made thedescription that it might as well be in the 4th Dimension for what it's worth.'That was sort of the point about how he got to talking with the aliens, there was this sort ofbrick wall. Even though they had the metal, the craft, the bodies, they were really at a brickwall. It really wasn't leading them anywhere or answering a lot of questions these peoplehad.In other words, if you have a lot of physical evidence that is incomprehensible wheredoes it get you if you can't dial up the non-humans that made the technology? If youcan't have a two-way dialogue, you don't know where they are from and you don'tknow why they are here, even if you have lots of their incomprehensible craft andbodies.Exactly. As I have always described it as all it basically does is confirm the reality of thephenomenon. Beyond that, it, for example, we talked to a Dr. Eric Walker who was a veryhigh level government official for about eight years. And that's what he told us: 'Leave italone. There is nothing you can do about it. You are up against windmills. Study somethingelse. Leave it alone. There is nothing you can do with it.\"And I never understood that until I correlated it with what Wilbert Smith was saying whichwas the fact that he had established the reality of the phenomenon, he had seen the craftand bodies, and yet he said at one point, 'Unless you have the mind of Einstein, you are notgoing to get anywhere with this stuff. It's that far advanced.'You can have a dead alien body, but a dead alien doesn't talk. A live one does. In order tounderstand the phenomenon of abductions, why they are abducting, in order to negotiatewith them to stop abductions or whatever we want to do, or to find out why they are, youhave to deal with someone who is talking. And Smith realized that very early on, around1952 probably when the contact stuff started, he realized very early on that he was at abrick wall and you had to go to the next level which was trying to make some sort ofcommunication with the phenomenon. And get the next level of answers that they sought.And at one point, he said, 'It was a good thing we didn't develop the technology because hesaid all we would use it for was to find a bigger and better way to drop bombs.' When hedied he was somewhat frustrated that he never found the answer, but he was happy in oneway that the world wasn't ready.For example, he had an anti-gravity experiment he was working on. When he finallydecided the government was going to try to steal it, he came home and his wife told me thathe took it apart and never said another thing about it until the day he died, and all he saidwas: 'The world is not ready for this yet.'We're at 2002 and I guess the world is still not ready.Yes, especially when you see what's going on in the Middle East today.”More Information:Wilbert Smith Quotes from Grant Cameron's ResearchAliens and Agendas\"It is my opinion that the people from outside are so much like us that they could minglewith us and we would be none the wiser.\" (Milne letter 1957)\"My own contacts as yet have been entirely indirect, and I would like to meet these peopleface to face.

Taking these factors into account, it is difficult to reconcile thisperformance with the capabilities of our technology, and unless the technology of someterrestrial nation is much more advanced than is generally known, we are forced to theconclusion that the vehicles are probably extra-terrestrial, in spite of our prejudices to thecontrary\"\"From the weight of the evidence, I think they come from outer space, but I can't prove it.The best I have is data on which you can put a probability figure - look at it this way, if astock promoter told you that there was a 60 per cent probability that a certain stock wouldgo up, I don't think you would invest with him. But if the weatherman told you there was a60 per cent probability that a hurricane was going to hit your area, I think you'd hurry upand bring in the lawn furniture. It's a question of viewpoint. You have to make up your ownmind how significant you think the matter is.\"Flying Saucer Observatory\"The deflection in the line (drawn by an electronically operated pen) was greater and morepronounced than we have seen even when a large aircraft has passed overhead. I ranoutside to see what might be in the sky. The overcast was down to a thousand feet, so thatwhatever it was that caused the sharp variation was concealed behind the clouds.

The equipment will detect and measure simultaneously gamma radiation, radio noise,magnetic variations, and gravity variations. It will also trigger the ionospheric recorder andget a trace of anything that happens to be overhead. According to the past statistics, weshould be pretty sure of a sighting here within a year.\" (Letter to military liaison inWashington 1953)\"We closed down the saucer station because it had served its purpose and was contributingnothing that we did not already know or could find out from other sources.
