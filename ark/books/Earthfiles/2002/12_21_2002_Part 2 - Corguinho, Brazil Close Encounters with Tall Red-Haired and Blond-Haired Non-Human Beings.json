It was bluish in color, violet. And it was verybright, but the light did not hurt my eyes. This light just transformed into awoman. She was about 2 meters 20, I guess. I was a small child, so it is difficultto ascertain the size.MORE THAN 6 FEET TALL?Yes. I am 6 feet 1 inches now. I think she was taller than I am today.COULD YOU SEE ANY COLORATION ON HER HAIR OR EYES?She had red hair. And her eyes. This recollection came through regressionbecause I did not remember this detail. I just remembered something strangehappened and scared me to death. I could see her eyes which were green, butwater green, transparent green, very strange, the eyes. Very white skin and thelips were pink, perfect, the features were perfect. I remember she leaned to meand said, 'Don't worry.' She said this inside my brain, inside my head. 'Don'tworry. Everything is going to be OK.' Then I found myself inside this room witha metallic bed and there was a bubble around me, like a soap bubble,transparent. And this same lady was outside this bubble looking at me. She wastalking to me and telling me that we are going to put something in you. 'Don'tworry, relax, everything is going to be OK. We are your friends.\" I was veryafraid, but when she started talking to me, somehow my fear diminished and Ibecame calmer. Then she could enter this bubble. Very strange. She could enterthe bubble with a very thin crystal, shining crystal in her hand, and she said shewas going to put that on me, on the back of my neck. And she did that. It hurt.HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANYONE EXAMINE THE HAIRLINE OF YOURHAIR OR NECK TO SEE WHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED?No, I have not. I was very afraid. I wondered if I was going crazy, what is this?! Ikind of held back. But they came back again.WHEN?November 1998.EXACTLY 30 YEARS LATER? November 1998 - Second Encounter ExperienceYes, it was a very shocking experience. In November 1998, I was laying down inmy bed alone. I was staying with my parents in Rio de Janeiro there, in theirvilla in Rio de Janeiro. I always keep a light on. I do not sleep in the dark. Ialways keep a light on. There was then a light on in the bathroom and the doorwas open. But I did not remember leaving the door open. I looked towards thebathroom and thought, 'My God, what happened? The door is opened. I did notleave it open. Strange.'"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"And then I blinked my eyes. After I blinked, I opened the eyes again, I wasstanding up beside my bed. The room seemed much larger, as if it stretched, youknow? I was like, 'What is going on?' Then I looked and there were two beingsbeside me. They were very tall, much taller than I am. They were dressed in thissame jumpsuit. They always dress in a strange jumpsuit, but the jumpsuit is litwith this strange glowing light, like a neon light.WHAT WERE THEIR COLORING? DID THEY HAVE HAIR?Yes, red hair. But they were two men, not women. No women involved. Twomen and they hold my hands and arms and then I froze. I was like, 'Oh, God,what is going to happen now?' And they talked inside my head again and said,'Don't worry. We are going to do something and you will relax. This is for yourgood.' They sounded like this. Then I started to move, to lean forward, butfloating.FLOATING.I was floating with my head, with my face towards the floor. I was floating likethis and I could see their legs. And then they said, 'We are going to putsomething in you. then we are going to make you sleep now because it is goingto hurt a little bit.' And then I blacked out and woke up the next day with a littlepain in my back and I was, 'Oh, my God!' And I stayed one month withoutsleeping. I was so afraid!And that was my second experience with these red-haired beings. But I hadother experiences near Campo Grande, this place.HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING MEDICALLY TO SEE YOUR HEAD ANDNECK IN X-RAY OR CATSCAN OR MRI?No, I did not, and I do not wish to do that. Early 1999 - Third Encounter ExperienceWHAT IS THE SINGLE MOST DRAMATIC PHYSICAL EVENTENCOUNTER THAT YOU PERSONALLY HAVE SEEN AND BEENINVOLVED WITH AT CAMPO GRANDE?At Campo Grande. I have two.

We had a doctor and one lady that, old lady, she was involved therewith the research.We were all (6 people) walking, strolling down this little path in this valleythere. Then all of a sudden we saw this strange light, like 20 or 30 meters awayfrom us, like a glow. We stopped. It was 5 p.m. It was still light.WHAT COLOR WAS THE LIGHT?All different colors, orange, yellow, blue all different colors. We we r e st a r t l e d !We said, 'My God, what is this?'

We could see it perfectly well becausethere was still some light.WAS IT A DISC SHAPE?Yes, a disc shape. The classic disc shape, metallic, silver color and the lightswere off. And I turned to this friend of mine and said, 'Please go and get Urandirso he can see this.' So he ran to the compound and he brought Urandir. When hecame, three beings came out from the ship: one lady and two men. And I had"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"binoculars with me and I could see them.HOW FAR WERE YOU FROM THE SHIP?30 meters. 20 or 30 meters.YOU NEEDED BINOCULARS TO SEE THEM AT THAT DISTANCE?No, I did not need. I had my binoculars on because I wanted to see a close-up oftheir face.WHAT DID YOU SEE IN TERMS OF COLOR AND EYES AND SHAPE ANDALL OF THAT?They were very similar to the ones that came to visit me before.

The red hairs, they had you know the square jaw, very wide?YES.Like Arnold Schwarzenegger you know, the face square with a jaw. These werethin, like Jody Foster. They looked like Jody Foster, more or less. Very strange.It's the only way I can describe it, an oval type of shape.SO, THE RED-HAIRED FACES WERE MORE SQUARE AND THESEBLOND FACES WERE NARROW CHINNED.Ye s . Ye s .NOW, WHAT ABOUT OTHER DIFFERENCES IN WHERE THEIR EARSWERE POSITIONED OR?I could not see the ears because the hair was on top of them. The hair coveredthe ears.

AND WERE THEIR ARMS ESPECIALLY LONG?No, the arms were just they would pass for a Scandinavian in a crowd.ON THEIR FEET, WHAT WAS ON THEIR FEET?I could not see their feet. I did not concentrate on the feet. I concentrated on theface because they were so amazing, very beautiful. My God! And the eyes arevery strange. I was amazed and affected by the eyes, the color of the eyes. Theshape of the face and tone of the skin very white, like porcelain. Very strange.SO YOU WERE JUST OUTSIDE WALKING WITH THESE OTHER PEOPLEWHEN YOU SAW THESE LIGHTS AND THESE THREE BEINGS COMEOUT AFTER YOU HAVE GONE TO GET MR. OLIVIERA AND HE HADCOME TO THAT SITE.Ye s .WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN THE BEINGS AND ALL OF YOU?One of the tallest one came a little bit closer to us and his forehead lit up andstarted flashing lights.HIS ACTUAL FOREHEAD LIGHTED UP AND WAS PULSING?Yes. The forehead lit up and flashed, flashed this light.DID YOU FEEL ANYTHING IN YOUR MIND WHEN THE LIGHT WASFLASHING?No, in my mind, no. But I felt in my stomach nauseated. You feel like you aregoing to faint. Very strange, with a strong nausea, like you are going to faint.Then it was like not paralyzed but like numbed, like we were drunk. I don'tknow. Very strange.AND THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO MR. OLIVIERA?To all of us, but Mr. Oliviera no. The forehead of Mr. Oliviera flashed just likethis being there.DO YOU THINK THAT MR. OLIVIERA IS ONE OF THESEEXTRATERRESTRIALS?No, I do not. Then Urandir's forehead lit up and started responding to this beingthere. And then, I turned to him and said, 'Can we approach them?'And he said, 'Do not approach them because the energetic field of the shipwould harm us.'And we remained kind of like numb, looking at the scene, looking at himflashing his forehead back to the being. Then they stopped, these lights theystopped, and the beings got inside the ship. The ship lit up again with the sameflashing lights and disappeared completely. POOF! All of a sudden, itdisappeared in a flash.WHAT DID MR. OLIVIERA SAY HE WAS GETTING IN COMMUNICATIONFROM THE LIGHT PULSES FOREHEAD TO FOREHEAD?He said it is a way of telepathy that he has with this.WHAT DID HE SAY THEY DOWNLOADED INTO HIS HEAD, THATPULSING LIGHT FROM THE FOREHEAD?He said they wanted to show themselves to us because it was sort of in thebeginning (of our research and we doubted) Is it true? We were a bit doubtful,you know? So, it was like a way to show themselves to us. Like we are here and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"we have contact with this guy and it is for real, more or less like this.DOES MR. OLIVEIRA HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT IS THAT THE BLONDSWA N T H E R E ?He says that they are slowly and gradually giving us information about theposition we are going to face and are already facing and also giving us like smallexercises to balance our energetic fields to feel better and be more in balancewith our energies. It's difficult to explain.WHAT HAVE THE BLONDS SHOWN MR.

In fact, he does not like to talk much about thisnegative aspect. What he wants to emphasize and our group, our research is this,there is the extraterrestrial. The phenomenon is real. They are here. They areinteracting with us and they are not at all negative as is widely spread about theGreys and all the traumatic abductions.
