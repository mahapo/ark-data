More than 100mutilated cows, and now horses, have been reported to local authorities in seven provincessince April. Image © 2002 by Rio Negro Online, Argentina. June 22, 2002 Buenos Aires, Argentina - This week, the unusual animaldeaths known as mutilations which have been making headlines in Argentina'sLa Pampa Province since early spring finally made the news on Americantelevision. The number of cases has continued to rise daily and is approaching100, according to local newspapers in La Pampa. Horses were also foundmutilated this week and the number of affected provinces has increased to seven La Pampa, Buenos Aires, Rio Negro, Santa Fe, Entre Roos, Chaco andPatagonia.

SENASA is similar to the U. S. Departmentof Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service. INTA is similar toUSDA's Food Safety Inspection Service.I called the American Embassy in Buenos Aires in an effort to reach one of theSENASA veterinarians, Dr. Daniel Belot, who has examined a dozen mutilatedanimals and sent tissue to the University of Buenos Aires School of Pathology.He told a reporter for the Nuevo Dia local newspaper that the University's onlycomment so far about the animal tissue has been that \"how the incisions weremade cannot be determined.\"Photographs here and below© 2002 by various Argentina media.The American Embassy gave me telephone numbers for various SENASAmanagers who might be able to speak in English on the record about the animalmutilations spreading beyond the La Pampa province southwest of BuenosAires.My efforts to call them gave me an insight into other headlines about Argentina'sfailing economy. Most of the telephone numbers have a recording that says thenumber is not in service. I called back the American Embassy to report theproblem. Then it was explained that SENASA has not paid its phone bills andservice to the government agency has been shut down to only a few lines. Thatwould be like the Department of Agriculture in the United States not paying itsphone bills and having most of its phone service cut off. Such a fate for agovernment bureaucracy in the United States does not seem possible. But inArgentina today, the economic crisis is that severe.Meanwhile, cattle and horses continue to be found in the La Pampa provincewith the strange, bloodless excisions of tissue that have been reported aroundthe world since at least the late 1960s, including other previous cycles of animalmutilations in South America. In the 1980s, I first reported that pathologystudies of mutilation excisions revealed exposure to high heat that cooked thehemoglobin and collagen in the tissues. (See my 2-volume book, Glimpses ofOther Realities in the Earthfiles Shop.) That cautery explained the lack ofblood along the cut edges. But when pathologist and hematologist, Dr. JohnAltshuler, compared animal mutilation excisions to known laser surgery, hefound something missing which puzzled him. Life on earth is carbon-based. Ifyou burn carbon-based tissue with a laser, there will be a carbon residue thatcan easily be seen under a microscope. Dr. Altshuler could not find carbonresidue on the mutilation excisions he studied. To this day, the cuttinginstrument in animal mutilations is unknown.Veterinarians in Argentina who have examined this recent cycle of animalmutilations there are saying officially that some of the cuts on the animals arecauterized, cut with heat. A veterinarian in Argentina today, in fact, talked aboutbloodless cauterization of a mutilated cow with reporter Reed Lindsay inBuenos Aires. Reed freelances for North American newspapers. This afternoon"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"he talked with two ranchers in the Rio Negro province who have discoveredmutilated cows recently. One is a veterinarian who described a cow he examinedon June 17th that had been dead since June 8, but was oddly preserved fromdecay and untouched by natural predators.Interview:Reed Lindsay, Freelance Reporter reporting for North Americannewspapers, currently based in Buenos Aires, Argentina: \"He (veterinarianand rancher near Choele Choel in Rio Negro) said one side of the head was likea normal dead cow. The other side had parts removed. The ear had been cut out.The tongue was removed and a part of the trachea. Also, muscles in the headand facial tissue had been removed as well. He said that one of the things thatstruck him was that the bones, there was no muscle or tissue on the bones. Theywere totally clean.Going to another part of the body, the rectum was cut out in a circular cut, aswell as the reproductive organ and the mammary gland.The udder on the cow had been totally removed?Right, not totally removed. He mentioned there were two holes where thenipples would be.One of the things that struck him was that there were no signs, no footprints ortracks or anything in the area. The soil is soft. Another rancher told me that thedirt there is very soft. There is no way you could walk through there withoutleaving some kind of a track.There were no tracks around this animal, including none of the cow's owntracks?Exactly. He said it's common if an animal is killed, it will kick out its knees andthere will be some signs of a struggle and there was none at all. It was as if it hadjust fallen from the sky."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"What about blood? Did the veterinarian make any comments about thebloodless condition of the cow?Right, he said no blood. No blood. This had been cauterized.Burned to seal off the blood vessels.Right. Another interesting thing he said was that there were no animals. Thereare wild pigs in the area and crows. The second rancher I spoke with who ownedthe land said that without fail within a day, the scavengers are there when ananimal dies. He said the animals are still there and no one has come to do anautopsy or look at them yet. The cows are still in the same places he found themon the 9th. So far, there has been no scavengers that have moved in.That's between June 9 and June 22, no predation on dead cows in an areawhere there are hungry predators.Right. And no bad smell. No rotting smell at all of the dead carcasses, which hesaid is strange and unusual.Also, the veterinarian didn't come right out and say it, but he said this is notnormal and not the work of humans. He said at one point that he had seen onhis ranch, a light on the horizon that was the size of the moon. A bright light.When he drove closer, it disappeared.\" Unusual Lights and Beams Seen In Mutilation AreasThe news source, Rio Negro Online reported that on Wednesday night, June19, at 9 p.m., an unidentified object was seen in the vicinity of Puente Diqueover the Rio Colorado in Catriel, some 25 kilometers from the province ofNeuquen. The object was seen by several truckers and traffic controllers andwas described as \"giving off a powerful red light that increased and diminishedin intensity.\"Jorge Hernandez, an operator in the Puente Dique, stated that \"the light wassuspended for more or less 20 minutes and we lost it from sight. ...the lightbecame very strong and then appeared to dim. It moved in bursts (of speed) andthen remained immobile. ...It couldn't be a plane or helicopter because of theway it remained still. Some say the lights are related to the dead animals.\"In General San Martin and other localities of the Province of La Pampa, severalresidents reported \"strange lights\" in recent days. Sheriff Gustavo Martinez, incharge of the Bernasconi section, says he saw a strange light in the sky afterneighbors told him to look. \"It changed color and size constantly, sometimesreddish and then blue. It was significantly larger than a star, more like the size ofa tennis ball\" in the sky.The Telam News Agency's Capital On Line of Santa Fe Province reported adead cow in Moises Ville and stated, \"Last Monday (June 17), in the vicinity ofLa Himalaya, going toward Azopardo, resident Ricardo Rodriguez saw a flyingsaucer over a nearby hill, beaming a strong white light and with a red coloredbottom (to the beam). His brother was able to see something similar in anotherfield on Tuesday night. He was plowing and saw a UFO in a different location,but in the same region.\"El Diario de Parana in the Entre Rios Province reported on June 21 that\"several people claim to have seen a strange luminous effect at the Las Lenas skiresort. The phenomenon occurred near the part of the hill known as La Antenato the locals since the internal radio communications transmitter for the complexis located there.\" One man on a snow rolling machine said he was amazed to see\"an intense multicolored light\" that caused his engine to stop running."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"E-mail from Reed Lindsay on June 22, 2002 after above interview:\"I talked with the journalist covering the story for the Bahia Blanca newspaper.He said 130 registered cases in the area up to this point, but he estimates therecould be as many as 300 because many ranchers are not reporting cases for fearthat the deaths are caused by disease and that could hurt their sales. He also saidthere have been many reports of sightings of strange lights, often in the sameplaces the cows were found, but nobody has seen a cow being lifted up by alight. Also, he said he read on the wires today of a case of a guanaco (a species of wildllama) found dead in similar circumstances in Santa Cruz province in southernPatagonia.\" Dr. Daniel Belot, veterinarian for SENASA in Salliquelo, Argentina, wasinterviewed by a local La Pampa provincial newspaper, Nuevo Dia, whichpublished the following excerpts in its June 15, 2002 edition. The news articlewas translated by Scott Corrales, Director of the Institute for Hispanic Ufologyin Derrick City, Pennsylvania.Daniel Belot, D.V.M., Veterinarian for Argentina's SENASA federalagency, based in Salliquelo, La Pampa, Argentina:6/15/02 Nuevo Dia: \"Dr. Belot is convinced that the perpetratorsarrived by aerial means and is certain that the animals were slainelsewhere and subsequently dumped in the field.Dr. Belot urged our region's cattlemen to report any anomalous caseimmediately, since he believes that the sooner investigations takeplace, there is a greater possibility of reaching a solution, which ishitherto completely unknown.Dr. Belot began his story by recalling that a \"cattleman (inSalliquelo) told me he had a dead animal in a field and his attentionhad been drawn to the fact the animal seemed to be skinned to thebone on one side. I thought this was impossible because it wassomething I was not familiar with, something utterly abnormal. Forthat reason I told him that some animal must have eaten it, which thecattleman completely rejected, saying that no animal eats in a straightline. Therefore, I resolved to go and see what was going on.\"\"I was confronted by an unnerving sight. Those who haven't seen itcannot understand the magnitude of the situation.\" Dr. Belotexplained that \"the animal lay on the ground like a rabbit and theentire left side of its face was skinned to the bone beneath the eye.All of its molars were visible. When we performed the necropsy wefound that it was missing its tongue, all of its vocal apparatus whichis to say the larynx and part of the pharynx and something very odd:there was no blood inside or outside the animal. It was perfectlyclean. That came as an enormous surprise to us.\"Dr. Belot confirmed that there was no tearing (of flesh) of any kindon the animal. Therefore, he discards the likelihood that predatorswould have attacked it. \"It is a deed that appears to have been carriedout by humans, but even so, it is something very hard to do.\" Whenasked if he was able to come up with any explanation whatsoever,Dr. Belot confessed that \"my curiosity has not yet been satisfied. I'vesent samples to the University of Buenos Aires School of Pathologyand the only response I've received is that how the incisions weremade cannot be determined.\"Dr. Belot stated that he did not establish the animal's cause of death,going as far as to state that blood samples taken from other animals todetect strange substances \"have yielded no results so far. The ones I"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"have received confirm that there is nothing strange in the animals'blood.\"Dr. Belot, who has analyzed more than a dozen of these mutilationcases, remarked that vital organs were missing in most of them. \"Inthe first case, which is the one I am discussing here, the animal wasmissing all of its maxillaries (jaw bones), but others were missingtesticles and penises. Others were missing ears, others were missingmammary glands, and still others were missing rectums and vaginas.All of this suggests some kind of scientific research, but don't ask mewhy a scientist is going to conduct research in the middle of differentfarms without asking for permission because I can't imagine why.\"Dr. Belot said he was astonished about the absence of tracks aroundthe mutilated animals and wondered how it is possible \"for no otheranimal to come near. ... (Normal) predators would not come close.\" For more information, photographs and drawings about unusual animaldeaths linked to glowing aerial objects and beams of light linked to theworldwide animal mutilation phenomenon, please see Glimpses of OtherRealities, Volumes I and II in the Earthfiles Shop.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
