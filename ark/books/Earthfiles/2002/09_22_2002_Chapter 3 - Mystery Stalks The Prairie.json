See Earthfiles 08/18/01. he first cattle mutilation reported to the Cascade County Sheriff's Departmentwas on August 14, 1974. While there continued to be isolated incidents in theweeks and months that followed, it was the following summer when the numberof mutilations started increasing at an alarming rate. But apparently whoever orwhatever was responsible for the mutilations was just beginning, as during theperiod from August 1975 to May 1976, over 100 possible mutilations werereported to the Cascade County Sheriff's Department. The bulk of the incidents occurred during warm weather, particularly in Augustand September. Records of investigations revealed that most of the mutilationstook place at the time of the full moon. Whether this has any specialsignificance, other than the fact the moon would provide light for the task, hasnot been established. If, as some people believe, some cult is responsible for themutilations, it is possible the moon's phase could have a bearing on it. It is difficult to determine the exact number of mutilations. Some of theincidents appear to be the work of predators and in other cases the animal hasbeen dead too long to accurately determine what has happened. On the otherhand, it is safe to assume that there are a number of other incidents not reported,either because of fear or because the rancher assumed the animal was killed bypredators. In many cases, the exact causes of death has not been established. Although it"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"appears that mutilations take place before death, there are some cases, accordingto pathologists and veterinarians, that cattle apparently died of natural causesand were mutilated after death. The mysterious episodes drew the interest of Captain Keith Wolverton, a deputywith ten years of experience in the Cascade County Sheriff's Department. Hehad transferred to the Sheriff's Great Falls office in May 1975, after serving atthe Cascade County K-9 Academy southeast of Great Falls, a training school forlaw enforcement dogs which he helped establish. When the mutilation reports began increasing, Captain Wolverton askedpermission of his boss, Sheriff John Krsul, to devote three weeks of his timetrying to solve them. \"I thought I could solve them in that time,\" Captain Wolverton said, \"but thetime went by and I hadn't solved anything. There's no school to train you in thiskind of investigation. So far I have just been trying to get the facts together, but Ihaven't solved it yet, so I must be missing some information.\" What started out to be three weeks of investigation has continued for almost ayear, with the full support of Sheriff Krsul. At times Captain Wolverton and themen working with him have become discouraged. But, since Sheriff Krsulconsiders the mutilations a law enforcement problem, the investigationcontinues. Every lead has been researched, every report investigated, but manyincidents have yielded no new clues. Innumerable hours, particularly at night, have been spent by Captain Wolvertonand Deputies Arne Sand and Ken Anderson patrolling lonely county roads,looking for cattle mutilators, unidentified flying objects or anything else thatmight help solve the puzzle. Sleep soon became a scarce commodity as the three men answered continuouscalls from troubled ranchers who were losing cattle or from frightenedindividuals who had seen strange flying objects, bright lights in the sky or hairycreatures eight feet tall. Even with the deputies' diligence in patrolling many miles of back country roadsin the sprawling county, the mutilations continued. Disappointingly, mutilationsalways happened in an area where the officers were not. \"We wonder at times,\" Captain Wolverton said, \"if those mutilating have someway of knowing exactly where we are.\" The growing number of people who have multi-frequency scanners has made itpossible for almost anyone to monitor law enforcement radio calls. One time thedeputies obtained two older cars and an old pickup truck, tuned them to runwell and equipped the vehicles with telephones in an attempt to patrolundetected. They used the vehicles six months, but were still unable to comecloser to solving the mysterious happenings. After his initial three weeks of working on the problem and realizing itscomplexity, Captain Wolverton called a joint meeting of the Great Falls newsmedia and requested their help. He asked the representatives of the localnewspaper, the four radio stations and the two television stations if they wouldbe willing to put out a story asking area residents to cooperate by reporting anyinformation they might have. The appeal gained support and produced at least one unusual lead. A man in anearby community phoned to say that his son in Minnesota was, as a sideline orhobby, assisting another man on research that might possibly link cattlemutilations with unidentified flying objects. Captain Wolverton called the son, who mentioned a convict in prison in theMidwest, who seemed to know quite a bit about it. After corresponding with theprisoner, Captain Wolverton and Deputy Arne Sand, who is a polygraph"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"examiner, traveled to the prison and talked with the inmate. The interview lastedsix hours, but it was not as fruitful as the lawmen had hoped. The prisoner failedsome of the polygraph tests Deputy Sand administered and a later investigationof the information the convict supplied proved that the information was false. Part of the story related by the convict was that a contract to kill severalMontana government officials was in existence. He said explosives were to beused to blow up a city block in the capitol city of Helena. Later the prisonerchanged the location of the predicted disaster to Havre. Although Captain Wolverton did not believe the convict, he took the precautionof notifying the Governor's office on his return. The explosion, which was tohave taken place before October 1, 1975, never occurred. Throughout their long months of investigation, the members of the CascadeCounty Sheriff's Department have had the total cooperation and assistance of anumber of professional men, each an authority in his own field. Theseprofessionals include several area veterinarians who went to the scene ofmutilations, examined carcasses, did autopsies and gave their professionaljudgment as to possible cause of death, methods of mutilation and otherpertinent information. Despite their professional skill, they were unable, in most instances, todetermine the cause of death. However, they were in total accord that a verysharp, possibly surgical, instrument was used to remove sex organs, the rectum,teats, lips and other parts of the animal. On more than one occasion, theytheorized that the incisions appeared to have been made by someone with anextensive knowledge of anatomy or medical training. Invaluable assistance in the investigations was rendered by a Montanapathologist who made numerous tests at the request of the Sheriff's Department.An animal pathologist in Colorado also was consulted on one occasion toexamine hide removed from a mutilated animal. These men verified someimportant new clues, but the significant question of who or what caused themutilations was still unanswered. A Montana toxicologist has made innumerable tests on specimens taken fromthe mutilated animals, as well as grass and other substances found in the area.When he determined further research beyond the capabilities of his laboratoryequipment was desired, he called on the assistance of a number of other labs inother parts of the United States. Laboratory tests were also made by the stateuniversity system and an area hospital. Although the sheriff's departments in each of the five counties have investigatedindividually, they have also shared information. In some instances, they haveassisted one another in investigations, mutually attempting to solve themysterious events. Leading the investigation in Teton County is Sheriff Pete Howard. UndersheriffJerry Skelton is handling mutilation investigations in Judith Basin County,Deputies Bob Blades and Tom Lee are working on cases in Chouteau Countyand Sheriff Walter Hammermeister is conducting the investigative work inPondera County. Other counties in Montana that have had isolated reports ofmutilations are also sharing information with Cascade County. Air Force officials have been cooperative, particularly since the rash of UFO andunidentified helicopter sightings began. The public, as a whole, has been mostcooperative since Captain Wolverton's public appear through the media. Thereare some persons, however, who have been reticent to report anything strange orunusual, primarily because they fear their friends' ridicule. The Cascade County Sheriff's Department has continued to solicit reports fromany residents who see or hear anything strange because each incident may addanother piece to the jigsaw puzzle officers are trying to complete."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Montana lawmen have also worked with officers in other states wheremutilations and strange sightings have occurred. They have wondered about thesignificance of the fact that most reported mutilations have been in westernstates. this may be because of the large number of cattle in these states and thedistances with low population density. Of all states, Colorado appears to havemore mutilations and Cascade County officers have conferred a number of timeswith Colorado lawmen. Of particular interest to the Montana officers was a news release concerning astatement by Governor Richard D. Lamm of Colorado. Dated August 25, 1975,the news story said in part:Governor Richard D. Lamm flew to Pueblo Monday afternoon to confer withthe executive board of the Colorado Cattlemen's Association concerning thewidespread livestock mutilations that have occurred throughout the state. Calling the mutilations 'one of the greatest outrages in the history of the westerncattle industry,' Lamm pledged the full resources of the state to help stop themutilations and arrest the persons responsible. 'It is no longer possible to blame predators for the mutilations,' Lamm said. 'It isclear from the evidence that only human predators can be responsible for theseterrible offenses.' The Governor noted that the School of Veterinary Medicine at Colorado StateUniversity had concluded that mutilations were being caused by humans usingknives. Reports from other states included mutilation of a pig in Minnesota and cattle inTexas and South Dakota. A sheriff in South Dakota wrote to the CascadeCounty Sheriff's Department asking for any information concerning offenses inyour area as to the modus operandi. Considerable information and copies of fileswere exchanged with law enforcement agencies in other states where mutilationshave been reported. Lawmen continue to ponder why almost all of the reported cattle mutilations inMontana have been in the five-county area around Great Falls, includingCascade, Chouteau, Teton, Judith Basin and Pondera Counties. Of course, theytheorize, it is possible that other areas are having the same problems, but theyare unreported. And in many areas, reported mutilations are labeled as predator-caused. When highly trained investigative officers work on a problem for almosta year and are unable to come up with a solution, there has to be a factor, yetundiscovered, which is necessary to solve the mystery.
