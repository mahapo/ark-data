July 6, 2002 Stonehenge, Wiltshire, England The greatest number of cropformations are now in Germany, not England. As of July 4th, England hastwenty. In Germany, new formation reports from Baden-Wurttemberg and theSaarland near the French border in southwest Germany will increase the numberof German crop patterns to more than 30. Photographer Frank Laumen is goingto fly over the Baden-Wurttemberg fields on Monday and I will havephotographs after he returns for a more in-depth look at three German cropformation hot spots. Stonehenge, July 4, 2002A formation discovered July 4th near Stonehenge, England is being described bymany seasoned crop circle researchers as one of the finest formations of all time.The crop is young wheat and the formation spans more than 700 feet, placedvery specifically between three burial mounds at one end of the field. Charlesand Frances Mallett, owners of The Silent Circle Cafe in Cherhill, Wiltshire,first saw an aerial image on Thursday night and were down in the field at 6 a.m.on Friday morning.Charles Mallett, Crop Circle Investigator and Co-Owner with FrancesMallett, The Silent Circle Cafe, Cherhill, Wiltshire, England: \"When we"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"saw it first on the computer, it was like, 'Jesus! That is something really amazingthere in the field!' You can see Stonehenge in the picture (Steve Alexander'saerial) it is adjacent and across the A-303 and a couple of fields back, half amile maybe, up a dirt track.What we were looking at is a formation 11 tramlines wide. Huge. We did a roughcalculation and it's between 720 and 750 feet, approximately. From a purelyaesthetic point of view, it is absolutely stunning!The approximately 750-foot-diameter Stonehenge formation is placedas if with precise purpose between the three ancient round burial mounds.Aerial photograph © 2002 by Steven Alexander.Also see http://www.cropcircleconnector.com.I would say something very interesting. We only determined this ourselves 15minutes ago sitting around our kitchen table which is: Do you remember theformation at Hackpen Hill in 1999, Linda?Absolutely.You've seen the resemblance at the center of this formation.Ye s .Hackpen Hill formation in wheat, discovered July 4, 1999,the center resembles the center of the 2002 Stonehenge formation.Speculation at the time was that Hackpen Hill resembled saros cycles ofsolar eclipses on the surface of the earth. Aerial photograph © 1999 by Steve Alexander.OK. Hackpen Hill 1999 happened on the Fourth of July. I think what we'relooking at is an aesthetically amazing elaboration on the Hackpen Hill. Thegeometry is essentially the same at the center so we're looking at almost acompleting of the task. If you remember that particular formation at HackpenHill, Wiltshire, was 400 and some feet in diameter, pretty huge and highlysophisticated for its day. An amazing formation. We went in on the first day itappeared and it was spectacular. No doubt about that one."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Stonehenge 2002 is a 6-segmented design as was Hackpen Hill. From the centerout, it's as if it is an open version of the same thing where Hackpen Hill 1999turned in on itself and kind of finished in a dead-end kind of path, folded intothe main body of the design.This one is as if the ends have been pulled out to produce huge, 3-dimensionalribbons splaying out across the field going on for 800 feet or so. It is stunningfrom the air. It looks like it is flapping in the wind. It's really effective.What were your very first impressions as you moved along the soil andplants?For the proceeding few days, the weather has been a typical English summer andhas been absolutely dismal. It has been raining every day essentially andpractically ever night. The conditions out there on the ground are horrific wet,boggy, muddy, terrible conditions. So we stepped into the formation with muddropping off our boots everywhere and leaving obvious traces, clearly apparentthat two people had just stepped into the formation. Apart from this, our ownfeet, and one other person we knew had visited the formation, we made our wayinto a formation where there was no mud. The whole formation was absolutelyclean. I can assure you, it was clean, smooth, consistent. No footprints. No mud.None of that. It was as if the thing had just arrived there and we had just steppedin. That was pretty impressive and fairly amazing in itself.We pretty much examined the whole formation. It is clean and consistent. It waskind of cookie cutter crispiness, you know? The immediate impression was thata single entity or single hand, whatever, had created this formation. Essentially,the whole formation looks as if it started in the middle as a swirl and splayed outin six elaborate directions to create something pretty spectacular which isabsolutely beyond our comprehension in terms of construction.Six-fold pattern 750-foot-diameter found at Stonehenge, Wiltshire, England on July 4,2002.This pole photograph and those below © 2002 by Charles Mallett."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Anything unusual about the plants themselves? Did you see any changes inthe growth nodes, soil, seeds, anything?A couple of credible researchers looked at it in detail. They spent two hours inthere on July 5 and what would be expected of a genuine formation was present;i.e., expansion and expulsion in the nodes, primarily in the growth nodes on theplants which is consistent with the work of (American biophysicist) W. C.Levengood.Just it's positioning alone adjacent to Stonehenge. As you would have seen fromthe aerial shot. It actually sits among three megalithic round barrows, burialmounds essentially. It could have been positioned out in the main body of thefield much, much easier. Just positioning that huge formation in amongst such atight area is quite a feat of engineering in itself. Why would it happen amongthree ancient burial mounds? It clearly is relating the entire formation to theland in some way, you know?Right. What might the relationship be between those burial mounds in that"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"particular field near Stonehenge and the field at Hackpen Hill?Yeah, I wish I knew. I would say, typically this area has received unbelievablysophisticated formations in the past. Remember the 1996 Julia Set? Highlysophisticated mathematical design of an order barely comprehensible to theaverage person. Just creating that single curve on a piece of paper is difficult, letalone doing it for 600 or 700 feet across a wheat field.The \"Julia Set\" discovered in a wheat field across the road from Stonehengeon July 8, 1996. The spiral measured 915 feet on its longest axis, covered a square acreand consisted of 149 circles. The center of each circle was twisted differently.Aerial photograph © 1996 by Lucy Pringle.This current formation has happened in very close proximity to that site andformation. I think it is one field out from that particular location. But this time,it seems to have chosen to lay itself down among the ancient sites as if to saythis is part of the land as well as part of everything else. It almost seems like aconnection thing with the earth.Does anyone know archaeologically what was buried inside thoseparticular round barrows at Stonehenge?I've never been on top of them, so I don't know if they have been excavated.Often, if they have been excavated, they usually have a shallow depression onthe top where they have been dug out and filled back in which sinks down. But Ididn't go on top of these and they are covered with weeds and brambles. I don'tknow.It was fashionable in the 16th and 17th centuries for the English gentry toexcavate these mounds in the hopes of finding treasure. More than not, theywould find a corpse or skeleton in a fetal position and a few personal treasures.The positioning of these mounds in relationship to the larger landscape isprobably far more significant than just having a place to bury a body. It's like thepositioning of Silbury Hill. That's regarded as a burial mound even though it hasnever been proven to be so. I'm sure it's there for a very good reason. And theway the crop circles appear in connection with these sites makes me think thatthis is very much not just aliens coming here and dropping circles in corn fields.It is very much related to the human consciousness, the earth and somethingelse. I'm just not quite certain what that something else is yet, but quite possiblyit is an interdimensional communication.Yes, and some researchers think it all has to do with those who have passedon of a particular intellect coming back to say or do something that isother-dimensional from our point of view. But from its point of view wouldbe an interaction with the earth from great knowledge about our past.I think it is entirely possible that these are reflections of our past, or as if we arecoming full circle (historically) and the crop circles are appearing because ofthat."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"As if that which knows our past is somehow responsible.Sure. A lot of the crop circles, the information presented within these formationsare mathematically, numerologically geometrically, can be looked at from twoperspectives:One, the most ancient forms of philosophy and spiritual belief, these formations,these patterns, have been used for thousands of years as almost magical tools.These particular shapes are not just pretty patterns. They are what would beconsidered sacred geometry, sacred proportions.On the other end of the scale are the latest technologies and sciences which aresaying that the non-linear dynamics of nature and reality seem to more or lesscollide with the most ancient concepts of spiritual belief. There seems to be akind of coming full circle.Look at the state of the world. Look at the state of the average individual. Do weneed to wake up and understand we are part and an important part of acomprehensive whole which is fundamentally spiritual? And I think that isessentially what the crop circles are about to wake us up to who we really areand to our potential as individuals and to us as a collective.Before we have destroyed everything.Indeed.Isn't it ironic that this season of more than 30 formations in Germany andthe extraordinary patterns in England, along with unusual formations inHolland, are occurring at a time that a Hollywood movie is about to comeout using crop formations as a kind of background for fear that hasnothing to do with the real crop formations? (Signs with actor Mel Gibsonopens in early August in the United States and in England in September.)Sure. My one hope is from this Hollywood movie that it will clearly Hollywoodnever makes realistic movies. They never have and never will. But there is thehope that it will put the thought in the consciousness of millions of people. Andthat is virtually been proven in the past that the thoughts of people effect thecrop circle phenomenon. So, the fact that millions of people might start thinkingabout the situation could potentially cause a massive explosion in numbers ofcrop circle complexities, sophistications, whatever. It's a theoretically possibleand it would be in keeping with how the phenomenon works.I think, personally, if suddenly millions of people really thought, 'Wow, this isquite amazing actually!' They would receive more amazing things just thinkingpositively about it. Our experience on the ground from a completely objectivepoint of view leaves us with no other choice but to conclude that this issomething entirely real, entirely needed, and it will continue until whatever itreally is doing is done. But my feeling is that it's fundamentally spiritual,fundamentally benevolent and it is very much for the good of the individual thatwishes to seek it and any individual that wishes to seek it will gain more thanthey could have believed simply by opening their minds to what is reallyhappening on the planet and where we are heading.\"More Information:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Stonehenge is the yellow colored figure in the bottomof the map and Hackpen Hill is colored yellow in the north, both in theCounty of Wiltshire, England.
