September 25, 2002 Boston, Massachusetts - In ancient Egyptian cosmology,after the moment of death there came existence in the afterlife where joys ofearthly existence were duplicated. One of the \"machines\" to get to that heavenwas the Great Pyramid of Cheops built 4,500 years ago for King Khu-fu in the4th Dynasty on the Giza plateau near Cairo. Some have called the pyramid alaunching pad for the King's \"ka,\" or soul, to travel to the circumpolar stars inthe north, known as the \"imperishable ones,\" and to the star Sirius and Orionconstellation in the south where Osiris, King of the Dead, reigned eternal. In aparadoxical way, the Egyptians thought that whatever worked in this life wouldnot work in the afterlife. So, in the burial chambers of noblemen, they carveddoors out of stone with locks that no human could use, but the ka of the deadcould move into and through the symbolic stone doors in a kind of Alice InWonderland way to activate life in the opposite hereafter. A scholar who has studied Egyptian concepts of life and death is one ofAmerica's most respected, Egyptologists, Dr. Mark Lehner, Ph.D. Dr. Lehnerdirected the Sphinx and Isis Temple Project from 1979 to 1983; was Director ofthe Giza Plateau Mapping Project in 1984; and is now visiting AssistantProfessor at the University of Chicago's Oriental Institute and is a ResearchAssociate at the Harvard University Semitic Museum in Boston. Yesterday Iasked him to speculate about the function of the narrow shafts and discovery oftwo more small, limestone blocks or doors in the northern and southern shaftsof the Cheop's so-called Queen's Chamber. (See Part I.) "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Doors 1 and 2 are in the southern shaft rising from the Queen's Chamber on the leftof the above diagram. The most recently discovered Door 3 is on the northern shaft risingfromthe same chamber. Both Door 1 and Door 3 have copper pins, staples or handles. Door 1and Door 3also block the two respective shafts at approximately the same distance from the Queen'sChamber: 210 feet.Door 2 is seven inches beyond Door 1. The actual path to Door 3 is now known to havethree turns in itto get past the Grand Gallery. No one yet knows what is behind Door 2 and Door 3. Interview: Mark Lehner, Ph.D., Research Associate, Oriental Institute at Universityof Chicago and Harvard Semitic Museum, Harvard University, Milton,Massachusetts: \"One suggestion which is perhaps one of the best goingsuggestions by Egyptologists is that these shafts are model corridors. ThePharaoh Khu-fu put his chamber so high in the Great Pyramid that in order forhis soul symbolically to get up and out of the pyramid, he had to go down andthen up in the actual passages, the ones that are big enough for people to first godown and then up into the burial chamber. So, some Egyptologists havesuggested that rather than going down and then up, the Pharaoh's soul wanted toget out of his sarcophagus, or in the Queen's Chamber, get out of his statue thatwas probably in that chamber, and go straight up to the southern and northernskies. So, they had these little symbolic, miniature passages, and in the realpassages that go into the burial chambers, there are what we call portcullis slabsjust before the King's Chamber. These are slabs (of stone) that slide in grooves.There are one, two, three of them.In the film that was broadcast on the 16th, they had a nice computer graphicwhere you see the big sliding blocks going boom, boom, boom down in thesesliding slots. Now, what these doorways Door 1 with the copper pins in thesouthern shaft and then Door 2, they may be little model portcullis slabs youknow, these big closure slabs.So, there could possibly be a third one if they are the modeling the portcullisslabs that are before the King's Chamber. So, in other words, they are littlemodel sliding blocking stones in a little model corridor for the King's soul toascend to the southern sky.IF CHEOPS WAS BUILT AS A KIND OF MACHINE FOR THE KING'SIMMORTALITY, YOU MIGHT SAY, TO LAUNCH HIS KA INTO THESEDIFFERENT AREAS WHEREVER HE WAS PERCEIVING HEAVEN, THENWHAT WOULD BE THE PURPOSE OF THE THREE LARGE SLABS ANDTHE SMALL DOORS AS THEY ARE CALLED IN THESE SHAFTS?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The purpose it's a good question the short answer is we don't know. We have tosurmise. The problem we are facing is that these are very unique features. Noother pyramid has them. That's one problem. So, we can't look at later pyramidswhere there is more hieroglyphic text, where they go further in explaining suchthings and say, 'Oh, that's what they mean later on, so this is what they musthave meant earlier on when the Great Pyramid was built.' We don't have suchparallels.But in terms of the meaning of these shafts, clearly it seems a reasonableinference based on what we do know of the ancient Egyptians that these shaftsare pointing up to the circumpolar stars on the north, both from the Queen'sChamber and the King's Chamber, that is to say the middle chamber and theupper chamber. It's a reasonable inference that if they are symbolic passages,they are pointing the King's soul towards the circumpolar stars, the stars thatnever rise or set. They go around the pole star. The pole star at 2,500 B. C.would have been Alpha Draconis, probably.Now, the southern ones (shafts) point up at the southern sky and it's veryreasonable guess that the destination there in terms of the stars was theconstellation Orion or what we know as the constellation Orion with the threestars in the belt. Orion was the symbol of Osiris, the Lord of the Dead. Or, thestar Sirius which was a very important star for the ancient Egyptians because itwas associated with the God of Isis. We know that because we have a traditionin later hieroglphyic text, religious text, that tells us about the King's soul, orKa, ascending to the circumpolar stars on the north and to Orion or Sirius in thesouth.The Ka, the immortal spirit said to dwell in every human,was drawn by the ancient Egyptians with arms upraised and a goddess standing on its head.IF THERE WERE TWO DIRECTIONS, NORTH AND SOUTH, DOES ITMEAN THE KING'S KA HAD A CHOICE ABOUT WHICH DIRECTION TOGO? OR THEY PERCEIVED THAT THE KA COULD GOSIMULTANEOUSLY NORTH AND SOUTH AT THE SAME TIME?I wouldn't be surprised. They didn't seem to have problems with contradictions.Probably both were destinations of the King as he basically communed with hisbrethren gods. The king was a god who ruled the Nile Valley as a god incarnatein human flesh, the god Horus. When he died, he became identified with Osiris.So, he became in one sense, one with Orion which is the stellar representationof Osiris. But of course, he could also go to the 'imperishable ones,' which iswhat they called the circumpolar stars. So he could go here and he could gothere.There are texts in the pyramid text I'm talking basically about the religious textin later pyramids where the first religious literature appeared spells, incantationssome of which we know came later as The Book of the Dead. In the pyramidtext which appeared in later dynasties on the walls of the burial chambers ofpyramids, one of the things they talk about are the locks like a lock on a door that a king goes through when he ascends to the vault of the sky. So, it could be"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"that these little doors, little portcullis slabs, little models of the closure slabs ina real passage that these are the locks that the King symbolically unlocks as hissoul ascends, whether it's to the south to be with Orion or to the north to bewith the pole stars.AND COPPER, COULD IT HAVE HAD ANY SIGNIFICANCE SINCE ATTHAT TIME THERE WAS GOLD, SILVER, BRONZE AND COPPER.COULD THERE HAVE BEEN A SPECIAL REASON WHY THE HANDLESOR LOCKS WERE CHOSEN AS COPPER?Copper that's the neat thing what are these copper pins? One of the suggestions Ithought of when thinking about the copper pins in the south and now also in thenorth is that they were U-shaped staples, or U-shaped nails. Why? Originally,were they U-shaped and then the U, the bend, broke and deteriorated and leftwhat look like two pins that kind of droop down with age and deterioration andcorrosion. The reason I thought of U-shaped copper staples is because theEgyptians made those and we have them in other contexts, including in the 4thDynasty. I'll mention one that is very well known, namely, Tutankhamen'sGolden Trines. You have a whole series of copper staples or U-shaped nails,probably to take ropes to tie the shrines to a sled. But it's interesting that theyalso used these U-shaped copper nails, or staples. In the case of Tutankhamen,they were probably bronze because they had evolved to bronze from copper.They also used them as the deadbolts, you know the slots for deadbolts, on thedoors of the shrine. That's why when I read about locks and locks of metal in thepyramid texts that the King symbolically unlocks on his way to the vault of thesky, I find it more compelling that these copper pins could be the U-shapednails.I don't know if a close look at the shape of the pins holds up that theory, but it'sthe best thing I can imagine. One other thing in response to your question, Iwonder if they are copper-coated iron because the Egyptians had very specialbeliefs about iron. In the Old Kingdom 4,500 years ago, we were not yet in theiron age. Iron did not come in a big way until some 22 dynasties later about 664B. C. in a big way, where it is ubiquitous throughout the technical system. Butin the Old Kingdom, iron was associated with the sky. As a matter of fact, theword for iron in one sense is 'bia em pet,' basically ''the metal from the sky.'If the copper pins actually have a core of iron and are coated with copper because certainly there is copper there or it wouldn't have the green corrosion.That would really add to these associations with the sky. And the reason theycalled it 'the metal from the sky' is because iron in the earliest period ismeteoritic iron, iron from meteorites that the Egyptians apparently recognized asbeing from the sky and meteoritic iron from meteorites is distinguishable by theamount of nickel in it. It would be nice to get a little bit of one of those pins anddo some x-ray diffraction or other kinds of analysis that would indicate whetherthere is any iron in there.IT COULD BE METEORITIC IRON COMING IN FROM THE COSMOSSURROUNDED BY COPPER PUT ON THESE LITTLE SLABS FORCOSMIC REASONS?Yeah, then it would begin to make sense. Although it's all an inference none ofthis is proven. We can only go on what is more probable than not, with the iron'bia em pet,' basically 'the metal from the sky,' the shafts certainly pointing to thesouthern and northern skies at an angle that makes them appropriate for thecircumpolar stars and Orion and Sirius and the later traditions of text, pyramidtext, that talk about the King ascending in those directions. I think that's the bestwe can do in interpreting this.WHY IN KHU-FU'S COSMOLOGY, WHY WOULD IT BE NECESSARY FORTHE SOUL OF THE KING TO EVEN HAVE TO GO THROUGH BLOCKSWITH THE COPPER OR POSSIBLY COPPER-IRON STAPLES?One of the things they had in almost any tomb of any size was whatEgyptologists call the 'false door.' And it's called that because it's not a real"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"door. In each and every tomb of any size we're talking about noblemen's tombs,not the King's - the false door was sometimes carved right into bedrock. Or itwas just made into a slab of stone and it's a dummy door. It's a symbolic door.It's kind of like a door in Las Vegas. It's not real. Or it's like a door in a UniversalStudio's set. Or Hollywood. It's a series of panels, like a series of receding doors,and above the center door there is a drum roll a round kind of cylinder that islike a venetian blind, but all modeled in stone. On the sides of the door are thedead person's titles. And on the drum roll, let's say the dummy venetian blindrolled up is his name quite often and maybe his principal title and in a littleplate or plaque above the drum roll there he sits at his table of offerings with thetitle.That is exactly where his relatives would come and leave offerings on an offeringslab carved in the shape of the hieroglyphs offerings and commune with thespirit of their dead relative. Probably the deceased head of their household. If itwere a real door, it wouldn't work.The Egyptians actually made what you could call simulacra, or model doors,when they wanted to effect something in the afterlife. If it was a real door, itcould be profaned by people walking back and forth through it and it wouldn'twork. It (solid stone) was a magical door. That is probably the best way to put itfor a popular audience. it was a magical door. By making it as a model, youeffected the magic that communed between this reality and the afterlife. So, yousee if you transfer that same set of ideas from the ancient Egyptian mentality intothe pyramid and into these shafts, you actually have to make a model door thatis sort of a dummy door closed in order to and the proper pins, whatever rolethey played in order to effect the very act of the King going up and with hispower opening doors and ascending to the southern sky or northern sky or both.SO, IT'S AS IF THE VERY OPPOSITE IS WHAT IS NECESSARY IN THEAFTERLIFE. WHAT WOULD WORK HERE, WOULDN'T WORK THERE?Right. There is an Alice In Wonderland kind of Through The Looking Glass kindof principle.The shafts in the Great Pyramid seem to have been for a very similar purpose.And there was a dummy it has to be a statue, it has to be modeled in stone asyou say, as a kind of non-functional thing in this reality to make it functional inthe other reality.This is sort of an ancient and very common principle, like in the Paleolithiccaves making an image of the hunter killing the mastodon helps make the huntsuccessful. So, by making an image in 3-dimensions with a door with a passageto the vault of the sky with doors that are dummy doors make it happens, maybewith the copper pins as locks makes it happen that the king can unlock thelocks, raise the doors and ascend to the sky.DOES IT STRIKE YOU AS ALMOST A PARADOX THAT KHU-FU ANDTHIS GREATEST OF THE PYRAMIDS WOULD HAVE THE SMALLESTCHANNELS FOR THE KA TO EXIT WITH THESE SMALL, STRANGELITTLE BLOCKS WITH THE COPPER PINS?Egyptians were very fond of miniatures. All the tomb scenes in a nobleman'stomb can be regarded in effect as sort of miniature models that help thingshappen in the afterlife. From the late Old Kingdom on into what Egyptologistscall the First Intermediate Period, the Egyptians carved little miniature models inwood of bakeries, of breweries, of butchery shops and buried them in tombs sothat baking and butchering would happen for the deceased head of thehousehold in the after life.In later times in the New Kingdom in various materials, the Egyptians wouldcarve little tableaus. There aren't very many of them, but there are some inmuseums, little tableaus of the King with the gods or various things happening they were very big on miniature form. It's almost this is sounding a little trite, butit's almost like voodoo. You make the miniature form, you make the image, and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the image has power and it has the power to make things happen. By making theimage of the door in solid stone, you are in effect kind of creating a kind ofconduit to the other side.I would look at it that Khu-fu more than any other pyramid was so daring andexperimental that he put his chambers higher in the body of the pyramid thanany pharaoh before or since. From those chambers in order to go straight up tothe cosmos, he had to have these symbolic shafts for the King to ascend.Because the actual passages leading up to his burial chamber are all going fromthe ground up. so, in order to go from that height in the pyramid even higher tothe vault of the heaven itself, he had to have these symbolic passages. I wouldlook at it as something like that.THE KA WOULD NEED THESE PASSAGES LIKE LAUNCHING PORTS OFSOME SORT AIMED AT WHERE HE WANTED TO GO?Something like that. That seems to be the image behind the statue of Djoser, forexample, in his serdab attached to the north side of the stepped pyramid.WHAT ABOUT THE SUBTERRANEAN CHAMBER AND THE ALLEGEDQUEEN'S CHAMBER WHICH DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE SHEHAD HER OWN BURIAL SITE? THEN THE KING'S CHAMBER WHERENO BODY WAS EVER FOUND? WHY WOULD THERE HAVE BEENTHESE THREE PLACES ALL HAVING SHAFTS OFF OF THEM?Well, I think the Queen's Chamber is probably the statue chamber in thepyramid because it has a deep niche in the eastern wall that is pointed out in thefilm where it would have been appropriate for the King's statue. I think all threechambers were planned together. What they mean again, we don't know for sure.All we can do is make inferences that are reasonable or more probably based onwhat we know from the entire Egyptian culture and belief.\"More Information:Archetypal symbols of remote antiquity, the pyramids have for centuriesinspired passionate theories about their origins, purpose, and method of construction.Now, in the first fully illustrated compendium of every major pyramid of ancient Egypt,Mark Lehner, Ph.D., a leading Egyptologist, surveys the history, building,and use of the pyramids in unprecedented detail. 450 illus. 100 in color.We b s it e s :http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/09/0923_020923_egypt.htmlhttp://www.cheops.orghttp://solos.users.netlink.co.uk/door.htmlhttp://www.magicalegypt.com"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
