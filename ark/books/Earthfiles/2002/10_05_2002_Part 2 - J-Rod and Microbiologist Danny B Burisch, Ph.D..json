Burisch, Ph.D., Microbiologist, with Bill Hamilton on left,in front of drawing board, summer of 2002, Las Vegas, Nevada.Photograph © 2002 by Bill Hamilton.\"WHAT DID DAN BURISCH SAY ABOUT THE ZETA RETICULII SYSTEM?Well, he did mention that what he saw in the documents was that the J-Rod typebeings were originally from a planet around one of the Zeta Reticulii stars andthat it, I believe, I don't recall exactly but it had a longer diurnal cycle than theearth. I'm not sure it was. It had a longer annual period in its orbit around thesun.Dr. Burisch told me that the J-Rods and other blond humanoid types used thestar, Gliese 876-c, as a kind of remote camp to study the earth. He told me that,'Gliese 876-c is the only one I have been given information about. It is not whatwe would consider habitable. However, it is the location that they selected fortheir remote staging base, the one that they use in a cooperative effort to studyand interact with us. It was described to me as being below the cloudy surfacelayer, as this planet appears to have a great deal of gas on the surface. Therationale behind this is that both Zeta Reticulii and Sirius/Orion (EpsilonOrionis star system) were too far to keep going back to. They needed to conserveenergy and time, so they established a cooperative base. When they need toreturn home, they use the Gliese 876-c as a jump-gate back to their respectivesolar systems.'Gliese 876-c, Red Dwarf in Constellation AquariusDistance from Sun: 15.4 Light YearsRight Ascension: 22 53 15.6Declination: -14 15 40Spectral Type: M4 VApparent Magnitude: 10.17Mass: 1.89 Solar MassesRadius: -1 Solar RadiiI know that Gliese 876-c has a wobble.WHICH MEANS IT HAS PLANETS.It has planets and apparently Gliese 876-c is where J-Rod actually transferredhis home base to in order to get more easily to earth. And it's maybe 15 to 16light years from earth. In other words, it's closer (than Zeta Reticulii which is37.5 light years from earth). But I understand it's not a planet that is, in ourterms, habitable. So, they must have made an artificial habitat of some kindthere.J-Rods Trying To Alter Earth Time Line"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"According to Dr. Burisch, the EBENs are here to try to alter our time lines, ourfuture. The reason for this is that they, according to him as fantastic as it sounds,they travel in time. So, they already know, or they know as a memory, whathappened here. There is a coming catastrophe that drastically reduces thepopulation of the earth and splits the earth into two populations and these twopopulations isolated from each other evolve from what we know as Homosapiens into two different species.ARE YOU SAYING THAT THEY KNOW FROM OUR PAST TIME LINETHAT THERE HAVE BEEN ASTEROID AND COMETARY DESTRUCTIONSOF THIS EARTH AND THEY HAVE GONE INTO THE FUTURE AND THEYSEE ANOTHER SIMILAR DESTRUCTION?What I'm saying is that they evolved in our future, according to the Doctrine ofthe Convergent Time Lines. In other words, they come from our future and theyhave traveled backwards to our past - or our current present.THEY ARE COMING BACK BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO PREVENTSOME TYPE OF CATASTROPHE?They are trying to alter the time line, yes. Apparently, whatever genetic traits thisJ-Rod inherited, they are suffering from some kind of defective gene which hascaused neural degeneration in their system or what Dr. Burisch calls a\"peripheral neuropathy.\" In fact, Dan was given the task of looking into thepossibility of genetic reverse engineering to repair the Eben's degenerate system.IS THE IMPLICATION THAT IF THEY CAME INTO THE HOMO SAPIENSFUTURE AT SOME POINT IN THE FAR DISTANCE, THAT THEY ARENOW REACHING BACK INTO OUR GENETIC BLOODLINES FORGENETIC MATERIAL THAT THEY THINK MIGHT HELP THEM IN SOMEWAY ?From what I understand, they are an altered form, a new species, that branchedoff Homo sapiens.IN WHAT WAS A CATASTROPHE OF WHAT WE WOULD CALL OURFUTURE?Ye s .DID DAN BURISCH HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE CATASTROPHE IS INTHE COMING FUTURE?He cannot specifically say what occurred. However, he places it as happeningapproximately a decade from now.Global Catastrophe and Human Depopulation in 2012?IN THAT 2012 TIME PERIOD THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE END OFTHE MAYAN GRAND CALENDAR?Yes. But it is not rigidly fixed. It could happen any time between now and then,or even a little past that time. I'm not certain whether it is something that is aninstant cataclysmic event of some kind. I have no idea. But of course, all of thisis subject to - we're going to find out one way or another. If we do have one ofthese catastrophes, that means they did not succeed in altering the time line,right? But if it does not occur, we can say either the information was false, whichof course skeptics will say instantly. Or we can say they did succeed in theirprogram of altering the time lines and averting a catastrophe.AVERTING A CATASTROPHE, IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'VE SAID,WOULD ESSENTIALLY KILL OFF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIRPARTICULAR SPECIES LINE AT LEAST IN A TIME LINE THAT THEEARTH WOULD CONTINUE ON. BECAUSE IF THERE IS NOCATASTROPHE, THERE WOULD BE NO BRANCHING OFF THAT WOULD"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HAVE PRODUCED THE SPECIES COMING BACK TO AVERT THECATASTROPHE?The thing is that there are groups of humans - who these groups are, I don't know- who survived by going underground.IN THIS ALLEGED FUTURE CATASTROPHE.Exactly, to shelter themselves from the effects of the catastrophe.J-Rods, A Homo sapiens Species From The FutureNow Moved Out To Zeta Reticulii 1 and 2, Gliese 876-c and EpsilonOrionis?YOU'RE SAYING THAT THESE UNDERGROUND EVOLVING SPECIESARE WHAT BECAME THE J-RODS THAT ENDED UP ON ZETA RETICULII1 AND 2 AND THE OTHER SYSTEMS?Yes. That's according to what Dr. Dan Burisch recalls reading in the briefingdocument.THAT'S WHY THERE WOULD BE SOME COMMON DENOMINATOR TOGENETIC MATERIAL ON THE EARTH AND WHY IT WOULD BEVALUABLE TO THEM?Exactly. And that would explain why the Greys are attempting hybridization andgat h erin g gen et ic mat erial .IN YOUR MIND, ARE GREY BEINGS ONE AND THE SAME AS THEJ-ROD SPECIES?J-Rod is at least one species of grey type being. I believe because of otherdescriptions, that there are other extraterrestrial types as well.SO THESE EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES THAT HAVEBEEN AT LOS ALAMOS AND AREA 51 AND WHO KNOWS WHEREELSE, THEY WOULD BE COMFORTABLE BEING HERE IN THE SENSETHAT WHATEVER WORK THEY DO TO HELP US WOULD BEMUTUALLY BENEFICIAL TO THEM AND US IN SOME FAR FLUNGFUTURE?Exactly. That would explain their motives for what they do. The explanation forwhy it is kept so secret is, I guess, you just don't want to announce to the worldat large that we're headed toward some kind of future catastrophe and unless weavert this catastrophe, a large percentage of the population is going to beeradicated. I mean, you just don't want to tell people that.Worldwide Animal MutilationsHOW WOULD ANIMAL MUTILATIONS PLAY INTO ALL OF THIS?The only thing I could determine is that there is something in the (food) formulathat these Greys use because they no longer ingest food through their mouth andtake it through the alimentary canal to digest it. Instead, they absorb thenutrients through their skin.NOW, IS THIS SOMETHING DAN BURISCH HAS CONFIRMED HE HASKNOWLEDGE OF?Yes, in fact, he even gave me a name for the process. I don't recall what it was.SO, THIS OLD STORY FROM THE 1980s ABOUT A GREY SPECIES OFNON-HUMANS PAINTING THEIR SKINS WITH BLOOD AND TISSUEFROM ANIMALS TO ABSORB IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE TRUE,ACCORDING TO DR. DAN BURISCH?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yes. Not only Dan Burisch, but other sources have given me this very sameinformation - including a retired Marine Sergeant who was active in crashretrievals.WHAT DID HE SAY?He said the same thing, but he called it 'osmosis.' When I mentioned osmosis toDan who is a microbiologist, he said, 'That is not exactly the process.' Then hegave it a name. I'm sorry I wasn't prepared and did not write it down because itwas technical. I'll have to ask him again.IS IT YOUR IMPRESSION FROM THE MILITARY MAN AND DANBURISCH THAT THE COLLECTING, OR HARVESTING, OF THE TISSUEAND FLUID FROM ANIMALS AROUND THE WORLD FOR HALF ACENTURY OR MORE IS A KIND OF FOOD GATHERING PROCESS FORTHESE BEINGS?Apparently. The hemoglobin is used in that formula that they use for nutrition.THAT THEY PUT ON THEIR SKIN.Right.THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER REASON WHY THESEEXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES COULD NOT MIX WITHHUMAN CIVILIZATION VERY EASILY.That's true! Also, at least the J-Rod kind needs to breathe a different atmosphere.AT LOS ALAMOS AND AREA 51, THEY HAD A DIFFERENTATMOSPHERE TO LIVE IN?They have these special (YY-II) facilities to house them, environmental facilities.Even EBE 2 was kept in a special environmental facility.J-Rod Upset At Being A \"Captive\" In S-4, Papoose Mountain RangeDan Burisch had an incident in which he entered the environmental sphere onetime. He was supposed to go through a protocol and raise his right hand and say,'I am a friendly human being who has come to conduct this procedure,' and thenstate what the procedure was. He thought that was silly because he was alreadyin communication with the J-Rod before entering the sphere. Well, one time heentered this sphere and J-Rod came up and kind of grabbed him. Dan was in asuit with hoses coming out of the suit.DAN IS SUITED UP BECAUSE HE IS GOING INTO THIS UNUSUALAT M O S P H E R E T H AT J - R O D L I V E S I N ?Right. And J-Rod grabbed him and circled his long arms around Dan's suit(apparently upset at being a 'captive\" in S-4?)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Drawing by Dan Burisch, Ph.D., of J-Rod suddenly encircling the microbiologistwith his long arms inside the special environmental sphere inside the Papoose MountainS-4 facility. Many images and thoughts flooded Dr. Burisch's mind until he lostconsciousness.Some of those thoughts were \"Look into the eyes of your own brother.\" \"A new heaven, anew earth?\"\"Find love.\" The residue of the experience in Dr. Burisch's mind was J-Rod's frustration atbeingheld a \"captive\" by a \"brother\" human, linked through past, present and future time lines.When J-Rod does that and is in that close contact with Dan, Burisch starts tolose awareness of his surroundings because his mind is being flooded withimages. As images flood his mind, at some point he passed out.DOES HE REMEMBER WHAT THE IMAGES WERE?He has attempted to draw them, but unfortunately he's not the artist that BillUhouse was. He has attempted to make drawings of these images.WHAT WERE THEY?One was an image of J-Rod as he perceives himself and calls himself a 'captive.'Then there were other scenes that would be seen in an off-world environment.One scene looked like a spacecraft. These were all jumbled up together alongwith some thoughts. One of the thoughts he strongly got was, 'You are looking atthe face of your brother!'YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE FACE OF YOUR BROTHER.Right.AND THAT MEANS DAN BURISCH TO J-ROD.It was overwhelming, apparently. Dan collapsed from either exhaustion orwhatever debilitating state he was in from this encounter.WHEN HE WOKE UP, WHERE WAS HE?I guess they had removed him from the sphere and he was in the infirmary orwhatever they have there. They do have quarters that people can stay in (at S-4,Papoose Mountain, Groom Lake near Area 51 and Nellis AFB, Nevada.)Current Relationship Between EBEN J-Rods and Earth HumansWE'RE TALKING NOW IN OCTOBER 2002, DO YOU HAVE THEIMPRESSION THAT J-ROD IS STILL WORKING WITH OUR SCIENTISTSINSIDE OF THE PAPOOSE MOUNTAIN FACILITY AND AT LOS ALAMOSAND PERHAPS OTHER LOCATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY?No, because in November 1994, EBE 3's visit came to an end. EBE 3 took theassistant J-Rod from Los Alamos and was to take the one from Papoose andreturn to home planet, now Gliese. What happened is that EBE 3 left with only"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"one J-Rod and the one (at Papoose) was held back for further studies, I guess.Whatever this agreement is, the negotiated agreement, is up for renewal,according to Dan, next year. It's renewed every 9 years. So, EBE 3 is due toreturn next year to renegotiate the contract or agreement. But since the J-Rodwas left here for further study and considers himself captive and not free to comeand go, I am just wondering what will happen when he (EBE 3) does return?YES.Now, there are only a few of these that are working with our secret governmenthere and the rest go about their own business. They don't even cooperate withour government.MEANING FROM YOUR KNOWLEDGE, THAT THERE ARE OTHEREXTRATERRESTRIAL ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT AT ALL INVOLVEDWITH THE J-ROD/EBEN EFFORT TO ADJUST TIME LINES AND TOAVERT SOME ANNIHILATION IN THE FUTURE AND SAVE OURSELVESAND THEMSELVES?They (others) are going on their own agendas, even if they are among the J-Rodsthemselves. What I'm saying, the greater population of these J-Rod entities doesNOT associate or cooperate with our government. Perhaps it is for this reasonthat our government is worried about what they may do, what their plan isbecause what we're not intimately associated with, we can't control. I can justsay that I don't know what the political organization is that these J-Rods have,what the nature of it, or how they negotiate these agreements or why there arethose who do not agree. All of these are big question marks.2003, 2012 and the Committee of the Majority (MJ-12)2003 IS A BIG QUESTION MARK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPENNEXT?Yes. There is something significant about 2003, according to other sources that Ihave, but I have not been able to determine what that significance is. Also, tryingto sort out all this information, I do not assume that the information I gather ismisinformation unless it shows up as falsified. I just assume that it is informationthat may be true or false and only further analysis and time will tell.Some of this makes sense. That's the part that gets to me. There is an intimaterelationship here with the human race because they are related to us, makessense.ARE THE PEOPLE OR OFFICE IN CHARGE OF OVERSEEING HIS WORK(BURISCH) AND REQUISITIONING EVERYTHING HE NEEDS AS ASCIENTIST RELATED TO MJ-12?Yes, but it goes up the actual authority that he gets approval from, he calls theCommittee of the Majority.THE COMMITTEE OF THE MAJORITY?Right.DOES HE REFER TO THEM AS MAJORITY 12?No. When he refers to Majestic, he just calls them Majestic.HE DOES KNOW MJ-12 AS A WORKING ACRONYM?Yes. And on his badge was 'MAJI.'WHO DOES HE PERCEIVE THAT MAJI REPORTS TO?The top authority that he reports to are the members of the Committee of theMajority. But the top independent person, individual, that he used to report to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"back in the early 1990s was this Vice Admiral J. M. McConnell who was head ofthe NSA.HEAD OF THE NSA.Right.WHERE DID MC CONNELL GO?He retired and went into civilian life. He does various types of security work.That's where an ex-NSA guy goes.Bill Hamilton Note: \"According to Dan, the officer he reported to was then ViceAdm. J.M. McConnell who was recently the Director of NSA. He is now retiredinto civilian life. Vice Adm. J. M. McConnell, Director,National Security Agency (NSA), 1992 to 1996.Mr. McConnell joined Booz·Allen in March 1996 after serving as Director,National Security Agency (NSA), the agency responsible for Signals Intelligenceand for all Classified Information Security for the U.S. Government. In additionto serving as Director of NSA, a position he held from 1992 to 1996, Mr.McConnell served as the Intelligence Officer for the Chairman, Joint Chiefs ofStaff (JCS-J2) during the dissolution of the Soviet Union and OperationDESERT STORM. While serving on the Joint Staff, Mr. McConnell regularlybriefed the President and his Cabinet Officers, international leaders, and theSenate and House of the U.S. Congress. He also appeared regularly oninternational television as the U.S. Intelligence Spokesman during the Gulf War.He achieved the rank of Vice Admiral in the U.S. Navy, where he spent morethan 25 years as an Operational Intelligence Officer.\"ANY FINAL WORDS FROM EITHER OF THESE MEN CONCERNINGWHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN 2003 AND NINE YEARS LATER IN 2012?No, I haven't. I've asked Dan directly what he thought might happen and he saidhe doesn't know. All he could tell me was that from what he had learned andagain, it wasn't first hand knowledge. I guess it was just something that he readfrom documents, that EBE 3 was scheduled to return in 2003 because theyfollowed this nine year cycle that was somehow important to them. Like therewere nine craft in the mountain. This number nine is somehow significant tothem.2012 is the termination point of another 9 year cycle. So, we're going accordingto their cycle of nine, according to Dan.But other than that return and renewal of this agreement they have, he did notknow what else is planned. Although I have heard from another source that oneof the things that is planned is possibly an announcement made by eithermembers of the United Nations or leaders of religion, that there areextraterrestrials here.Again, I have no way of evaluating this is stuff that has kind of flown around and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"don't know if it's misinformation or really is an acclimatization programunderway. If there is, why is there I don't know.IF THERE IS A CYCLE OF NINE, IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DOWITH THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT IT TAKES TO GO FROM WHEREVERTHEY ARE TO WHEREVER WE ARE.Yes. I don't know what it's tied to, except it's tied to some kind of system theyhave, some kind of system that they pay attention to that deals with cycles oftime.THEY CYCLE IN AND OUT OF THE EARTH EVERY NINE YEARS?I don't know how to answer that, except that EBE 3 left nine years ago in 1994.Mars and Blond HumanoidsDID EITHER DAN OR BILL UHOUSE TALK ABOUT HAVINGKNOWLEDGE SPECIFICALLY OF THE J-ROD SPECIES HAVING BASESUNDERGROUND ON MARS?No. However, Dan mentioned another type of being who was on Mars, but wentelsewhere. Their home is not there. Their home is close to Epsilon Orionis.These are described as the tall blonds, the Nordic types. But he has never metone, he's just read about them.DAN BURISCH HAS READ ABOUT THE BLONDS IN HIS WORK IN THEPAPOOSE MOUNTAINS?Ye s .DID HE CHARACTERIZE ANYTHING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIPBETWEEN THE TALL BLONDS AND THE J-ROD TYPE?They are just another branch that has evolved from Homo sapiens, but theywent along the spiritual evolutionary path, according to him.SO, DAN BURISCH SEES ANY EXTRATERRESTRIAL INVOLVEMENTWITH EARTH NOW AS VARIOUS BLOODLINE BRANCHES FROM HOMOSAPIENS AND THEY ARE BACK HERE BECAUSE OF SOME TERRIBLEPROBLEM IN THE FUTURE?Yes. But he admitted to me that his knowledge of extraterrestrial races is limited,very limited. the only extraterrestrial entity that he encountered was this J-Rod.He said he believes that there are other races out there. In fact, I have twoindependent sources which have mentioned the figures 167 and 169, so closetogether. I thought this was highly coincidental.OF VARIOUS TYPES OF SPECIES OR CIVILIZATIONS?Ye s .WAS THERE ANY CHARACTERIZATION BY DAN BURISCH OF THEGOVERNMENT'S RELATIONSHIP TO THE TALL BLONDS?No, he was not privy to that information. He had no need to know.IF THE BLONDS WERE ON MARS ONCE, WHERE DID THEY GO ANDWHY DID THEY LEAVE?They went to Epsilon Orionis and I don't know why. (Middle star in Orion'sBelt)THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE. HOW FAR IS THAT FROM ZETARETICULII I AND II?I haven't looked that up."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" How Could EBE J-Rods and Blond Humanoids Change Earth's TimeLine?CAN YOU ELABORATE ON WHATEVER DAN BURISCH'SUNDERSTANDING IS ABOUT THE CYCLES OF TIME AND HOW BEINGSTHAT WERE SOME EXTENSION OF HOMO SAPIENS BLOOD LINES FARIN THE FUTURE COULD COME BACK AND TRY TO CHANGE OURPRESENT TIME LINES?About the only thing he said was that he understood that the Nordic Blonds andthese J-Rods met and had decided they were going to attempt to change theirhistory because they had now learned how to travel in time and travel backwardsin time to some point that I would estimate is in our distant past. (Or 2012?)Again, we're talking about this fantastic subject of time travel and what it does toreality. And it's very complicated. A lot of scientists have toyed with these ideasand the paradoxes it presents. What I have studied are anecdotal stories ofpeople who have found themselves some how displaced into the past. This issomething not studied by the scientists, because they are always talking fasterthan light travel, worm holes, the theory of relativity, and that kind of timetravel, using a time machine of some kind.But I'm talking about a spontaneous paraphysical events that happen to peoplethat they report. An event would be like someone decides to go on a vacationwith their entire family. They stop at a restaurant and everything in therestaurant people are dressed like way back in the 1950s. The service is great,the food is great. Then the bill comes and it's only maybe $10 or $12 for six ofthem. And they go 'Huh? How can this be?' They happily pay it and leave anddecide to return on a trip to that same restaurant and find out there is norestaurant. Rumor has it there was a restaurant there 20 years ago and it burnedto the ground. Well, what happened?! I mean, their recollection is that they hadthis physical happening.RIGHT, AND IT IS AS IF THERE ARE THESE THREADS WOVEN JUSTLIKE WE WOULD THINK OF A BRAID WITH ALL OF THESE MULTIPLEPIECES OF HAIR, EACH HAIR BEING A TIME LINE. WHAT INTRIGUESME IS: IF YOU REACH A POINT IN TECHNOLOGY WHERE YOU CANMATCH OR EXCEED THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND BEGIN TO MOVE INTIME, WHAT CAN YOU ACCOMPLISH BY COMING BACK INTO YOURDISTANT PAST, WHICH IS WHAT THESE NON-HUMANS ARE SAYINGTHEY ARE DOING NOW IN ORDER TO AVERT A CATASTROPHE IN THEFUTURE? HOW DO YOU DO THAT?I don't know. But they have knowledge of what happens. They have greaterknowledge and apparently, they have a plan. That's the only thing I can think of.They have a plan in which they are going to try to change something andinterfere with our time line so as to avert a catastrophe.HAS DAN BURISCH SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST ASBEING INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH ALL OF THESE EFFORTS OFCHANGING TIME LINES?No, he has not.WE COULD BE SITTING ON THE PRECIPICE OF SOME KIND OFNUCLEAR WAR IN AND AROUND IRAQ WHICH COULD SOME HOW BEGERMANE TO EVERYTHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT?That's a possibility I cannot dismiss. We all have more questions than theanswers that have been supplied so far, I know that. I still have questions.DID DAN BURISCH HIMSELF SEEM TO BE CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT ITALL MEANT?"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"He did not seem to be totally knowledgeable. This was all something he said heread in briefing documents and could discuss occasionally with some of hisfellow workers. It wasn't like he had any direct knowledge of the whole schemeof things.
