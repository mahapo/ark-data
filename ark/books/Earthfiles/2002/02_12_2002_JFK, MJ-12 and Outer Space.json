S. government documentshe was using for a television interview about MJ-12, also known as Majestic 12or Majority 12. That Top Secret group of scientists, military officers andbusinessmen was allegedly appointed by President Harry S. Truman in 1947 tomonitor and research the activity of extraterrestrial biological entities on theearth while simultaneously manipulating misinformation to keep all facts andphysical evidence from the media and public \"in the interest of nationalsecurity.\" Jim's first book, Crossfire © 1989, was a national bestseller and usedas a basis for Oliver Stone's feature film, JFK. Other books by Jim Marrs haveincluded Alien Agenda © 1997 and Rule By Secrecy © 2000, each advancinginsights about the interaction of one or more non-human intelligences with thisplanet since at least the Sumerian domination of Mesopotamia (modern day Iranand Iraq).Jim and I also talked about my experiences back in the early 1980s after I hadproduced the television documentary A Strange Harvest for the CBS affiliateKMGH-TV in Denver, Colorado about the worldwide animal mutilation mysterylinked to alien life forms. I had been told by two different governmentintelligence agents in two different parts of the United States that John F.Kennedy had been assassinated on November 22, 1963 on orders of the CIAbecause after a long and tense period of grievances that included thecontroversial pull back of American air cover at the Bay of Pigs, JFK - based onsome firsthand knowledge from his service as a U. S. Naval intelligence officer -had demanded access to all files and images concerning an extraterrestrialpresence on earth.Jim showed me the following documents which first emerged in the MJ-12research of Robert and Ryan Wood, father and son, who have been studyingmore than 2,000 alleged U. S. government documents from various sources sincethe early 1990s. See their website at bottom of this report.June 28, 1961 National Security Memorandum Referencing MJ-12Signed by President John F.

It would be veryhelpful if you would have the high threat cases reviewed with thepurpose of identification of bona fide as opposed to classified CIAand USAF sources. It is important that we make a clear distinctionbetween the knowns and unknowns in the event the Soviets try tomistake our extended cooperation as a cover for intelligencegathering of their defence and space programs.When this data has been sorted out, I would like you to arrange aprogram of data sharing with NASA where Unknowns are a factor.This will help NASA mission directors in their defensiveresponsibilities.I would like an interim report on the data review no later thanFebruary 1, 1964./S/ John F.

I assume that you will work closelywith the Department of State and other agencies as appropriate.\"These proposals should be developed with a view to their possible discussionwith the Soviet Union as a direct outcome of my September 20 proposal forbroader cooperation between the United States and the USSR in outer space,including cooperation in lunar landing programs. All proposals or suggestionsoriginating within the Government relating to this general subject will bereferred to you for your consideration and evaluation.\"In addition to developing substantive proposals, I expect that you will assist theSecretary of State in exploring problems of procedure and timing connectedwith holding discussions with the Soviet Union and in proposing for myconsideration the channels which would be most desirable from our point ofview. In this connection the channel of contact developed by Dr. Drydenbetween NASA and the Soviet Academy of Sciences has been quite effective,and I believe that we should continue to utilize it as appropriate as a means ofcontinuing the dialogue between the scientists of both countries.I would like an interim report on the progress of our planning by December 15.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"President John F.

One unsigned document dated October 21, 1990and marked \"CONFIDENTIAL, 0 copies, No dissemination\" emerged allegedlyfrom a British and American think tank in England about a program to acclimatethe public to \"first-hand encounter\" phenomenon and \"crop circles.\" Jim Marrshas had a copy for several years and agreed its contents could be shared with thepublic, acknowledging that source verification is lacking.\"October 1990TO: Policy CommitteeSubject: Observations on Public Acclimation Program\"The metered release of information to the public through variousunofficial channels continues to generate much interest and anincreasing level of awareness, with little if any observableside-effects, other than healthy skepticism on the part of somepeople.We would like to suggest continuing the present approach, as it ismaking information available to those who are psychologically readyfor it, without causing stress on those who are not ready.The present approach is also proving helpful to those who are havingfirst-hand encounters. It is providing them with a context in which toput experiences they cannot otherwise explain or understand. Havingsome conception of this phenomenon is an enormous psychologicalrelief to these people - and helps them get on with their lives, as best"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"as possible. Providing information which helps people to cope willbecome increasingly important as the percentage of the populationhaving these encounters continues to rise. Some assistance in thisarea can be expected by various civilian support groups, which havebeen formed by interested parties.Over time, it may be appropriate to increase the accuracy and theconsistency of information in circulation. Possibly, as the public getsmore comfortable with IAC sightings (Identified Aerial Craft and/orIdentified Alien Craft) and 'crop circles,' additional types ofinformation can be released. It appears most of the researchcommunity is running one to two years or more ahead of themainstream media. this gives some timeframe for possible disclosuresto the general public - while providing advance details to those whoare ready for it now. Having a certain number of informed citizenscould well prove to be an invaluable resource in the face ofunpredictable future events. Indeed, history may record that it wasthese aware people who set aside their differences and workedtogether most to help humanity, their country and their governmentin the changing times and challenges ahead.\"For more information about MJ-12, see An Alien Harvest and Glimpses ofOther Realities, Vol. II: High Strangesness in the Earthfiles Shop.We b s it e s :http://www.majesticdocuments.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
