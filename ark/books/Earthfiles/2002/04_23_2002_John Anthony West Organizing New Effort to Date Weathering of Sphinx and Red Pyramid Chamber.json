Its height is 66 feet.The head measures 30 feet long and 14 feet wide.April 23, 2002 Athens, New York - In 1991, Egypt researcher John AnthonyWest joined Boston University geologist, Robert Schoch, Ph.D., to study theweathering on the base of the Sphinx. Dr. Schoch's academic opinion was waterdamage at least eight thousand years ago and the two men announced theirtheory which made worldwide headlines. Since then, two British geologistsnamed David Coxill and Colin Reader have independently traveled to Cairo tostudy the Sphinx and each has supported Dr. Schoch's conclusion that theweathering is from water. But no one yet has definitively proved how long agothere was enough rain to weather the Sphinx.Another weathering puzzle is a chamber deep within the \"Red Pyramid\" atDashur known for the rust color on its limestone blocks. It stands 343 feet abovethe desert sand and each side measures 722 feet. Inside it are three chamberswith elegant corbelled ceilings. The third and deepest into the pyramid appearsconstructed out of stones that appear deeply weathered. Are they remnants of avery ancient structure around which the Red Pyramid was later built? Or wereold and weathered stones from some revered structure reused to build the Red"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Pyramid. Whatever the original truth, the age of those weathered blocks wouldseem to be older than the outer structure of the Red Pyramid?North view of the Red Pyramid, Dashur, Egypt.The first Red Pyramid entrance and passageway descends at an angle of approximately27 degrees for 206 feet. The bottom of the stairs levels off into a 25-foot-long corridorthat leads into the first of three chambers.Above the third chamber, an elegant corbelled ceiling rises 50 feet."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The floor was removed to search for other passageways and chambers,but none were found. Researchers have puzzled over the ancient weatheringon stones in this chamber deep inside the Red Pyramid.John Anthony West thinks that eventually science will be able to prove the ageof the weathering and he thinks the age will exceed 10,000 years back to, oreven before, the end of the last Ice Age. I asked him why geologists today can'tpinpoint more specifically and agree on the age of weathering in ancientstructures such as the Sphinx and the Red Pyramid. John Anthony West, Egypt Researcher, Director of Ancient WisdomFoundation and Author, Serpent In The Sky, Athens, New York: \"Well, it'shard to date stone. You see, there is a method, but no one is really sure howaccurate it is. You can't carbon date stone. You can only carbon date organicmaterials and even in that, there is a question that carbon dating is open to lotsof questions. Lots of people challenge carbon dating. But you can't do that withstone.There is a technology in place called isotopic analysis in which you take asample of stone and when a bedrock is cut and exposed to the air, it getsbombarded by cosmic rays which gradually changes the isotopic content ofcertain of the trace elements in them. I think cadmium, cobalt, beryllium and acouple of different elements that will change, will start losing their electrons,once they are exposed to the air.In theory, it's possible to date stone. But you need three, you need to be able totriangulate. First, you need virgin rock. You need a core sample of virgin rock.And then you need a sample of a piece of rock of the exact same sort that youknow the date of, let's say something from the New Kingdom, 1200 B. C.,something like that. But then, the same rock, but rock X that you don't know.And then you triangulate and in theory, you come up with a date.But whether or not that technology is good enough to determine dates in termsof thousands of years? Or only good enough to date for tens of thousands ofyears? We don't know because we haven't tried it."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"A number of geologists, particularly at our first presentation back in 1991, werequite enthused about all this and offered to help and put our laboratories at ourdisposal. But, because of that prevailing hostility at the time, we were never ableto get back there to do any further work. We put that on hold and is still on holdbecause I know that probably the hardest thing to get permission to do in Egyptanywhere is to take samples. So, it's just something that somewhere along theline or someone will figure out another way to date the stones.Nabta stone circle in Egypt's Sahara Desert dated by scientists in 1998to be about 6,500 years old, the oldest known astronomical alignment ofmegaliths in the world. Some of the stone slabs are nine feet high andoriginated miles away from the constructed circle. Photograph courtesyJ. M. Malville, Univ. of Colorado and F. Wendorf, SMU.Normally, they date things like Nabta by the stratigraphy. You dig down and thearchaeologists can find things like pollen or organic material found aroundthere. There are a lot of ways of dating via stratigraphy, but dating stone directly- this is tough to do. The dating of the Nabta stone circle at about 4600 B. C.,making it the oldest, certifiably dated stone circle or megalithic structure in theworld is revolutionary in a sense. And even the people who discovered that,Fred Wendorf and a couple of other archaeologists who have been working on it acknowledge that it is oriented astronomically with the equinoxes, it's anastronomical orientation.This is a megalithic construction - not Stonehenge - the stones are roughly thesize of grave stones. But even that is not fooling around to produce that stonecircle.Then you have an astronomical orientation - this isn't done to calculate when toplant your seeds. Whoever the ancients were - and whatever their reasoning forpositioning temples astronomically, which we don't know, but can only surmise,this is of immense importance to them and it means there was careful enoughastronomy in place 4600 B. C. to precisely orient a stone construction. So, nowwe are talking about a different level of civilization and we're talking about 4600"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"B. C. and not our Sphinx age whenever that may have been.The whole issue of stone circles around the world, the concentration ofmore than a thousand in the British Isles, and a date of 4600 B. C. in Egyptwhich is approximately 7000 years ago - doesn't that mean there was aglobal pattern of stone circles in many areas? Where was the first built?Was it in Egypt or Great Britain?Who knows. There were loads of stone circles and megalithic constructions inAmerica which the stupid archaeologists keep calling \"colonial root cellars,\" asif the colonists were living in log cabins themselves, but were shifting aroundfour ton stones to keep their turnips through the winter. This is moronic. Butthere are tons of them in America. My sister lives right next to one in WhitePlains, New York. They are all over the place.There are loads of them in New Zealand, believe it or not, which is being keptquiet because the Maoris would like to say they are the first people, the settlersof New Zealand. And if there were stone circles, or megaliths already there, itmeans the Maoris themselves were not the first. But it's politically incorrect nowto talk about these stone circles in New Zealand. But it would appear thatwherever you look, there are these megalithic remains and I guess, since there isno dating them, no texts or documents, it's probably global and futile to see whois first or where. It's all over the place.The fact that the stone circles are global and go back at least 7,000 yearsand perhaps earlier makes me wonder what inspired the placement ofstone circles around the world in the first place?Exactly, Linda. See, my sense of it is that we're talking about a globalcivilization that is much older than that even. And that gets blasted out ofexistence whenever when the Ice Age melted, something catastrophic happened.This is not New Age thinking. This is solid anthropologists and zoologists andarchaeologists and paleo-climatologists who acknowledge that something drastichappened around 12,000 B. C. Everyone agrees with that.What they don't agree with is that there was an advanced civilization in place atthat time. But my sense of it is that our Sphinx the Sphinx is probably the singlemost important evidence in this whole puzzle because it is the most difficult toattack. The opposition arguments about the age of the Sphinx and waterweathering are absolutely they range from uninformed to more commonlymoronic. You get a good sense of what goes on there are a number of websites togo to about these arguments. That's the linchpin of the whole thing, sitting there,240 feet of Sphinx with a tremendously deeply weathered core body. And evenmore important, the deep and uneven weathering of its enclosure wall and thisdefies up to now any other explanation but water weathering in the distant past.Now, how distant that past this is a major bone of contention. And probablywill continue to be a major bone of contention, really until the case is proved.When I think about academic resistance to evidence and change, I think that forhundreds of years, there were dinosaur bones being found and everyone wasarguing. They were arguing whether these were hoaxes, or whether these weregiants, or whether something, a trickster played on them by God. And then in1838, one of the earliest geologists at exactly the right time, the argument wasright that this was an extinct animal and suddenly, the opposition caved in and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"said, 'Yes, this is an extinct animal' and within a couple of generations, themuseums of the world were filled with reconstructed dinosaurs.I think we are in something of the same position. That's why I think our geologistpanel is so important because I feel it can be the battering ram that bursts openthe door to the ivory tower once and for all. And if we get a panel of a dozen,credentialed, absolutely uncommitted geologists to go over there and say, 'Yes,this is the case. It's water weathering. It could only have been produced by rain,lots and lots of rain in the very distant past - we don't know exactly when, butcertainly not anything close to Dynastic Egyptian times. And these guys haveabsolutely no connection with us and no axe to grind.If a very ancient age was proved once and for all scientifically, wouldn'tthat be the biggest draw to tourists in the world?Absolutely! This is what I keep trying to tell people. Zahi Hawass, Egypt'sDirector of Antiquities, is more open than you might think, but some others havevery closed minds. And that's why you need something like a geologist panel - itis perfect for this because it is non-invasive, we don't need any seismographs, wedon't want any samples - we just want a dozen credible academic professionalsto look at this.Once it happens, like the dinosaurs, then progress is made in a hurry. But tobreak down that initial barrier, academics just don't like being wrong. Nobodylikes being wro ng.We know that in every direction our old academic perspective of thehistory of cultures on this planet is being pushed back and back every year.Absolutely. There is hardly a week that goes by that something doesn't show upin Peru or Australia or something that really forces a rethink. But each time, theestablishment acts as though it's a singularity, as though it doesn't really count.The age of the Sphinx is a strictly scientific question. And really a lot of peoplehave the right to ask: So what? What's the difference if it's 36,000 years old?That's what I think it is for a variety of complicated texts, partly from Egyptiantexts and partly because that was the Age of Leo, I think it's a Leo marker and Ithink knowledge of the procession of the equinoxes goes back all thosethousands of years and I don't think it refers to the 10,000 date that is favored byBauval and Hancock because the earth was in a state of ongoing cataclysm atthat period of time.The end of the Ice Age.The end of the Ice Age and the destruction of all the mammoths and stuff goingon all over the earth, so I think it could be the age before that whichcorresponds with certain enigmatic Egyptian texts themselves. Then were aretalking about 36,000 B. C. Then the question is: what does, so what? What'simportant about how old the Sphinx is? And in a way, people are correct to askwhen civilization started?The real point of all this, of all the work I've been doing on Egypt all of thesedecades, is that in my view the Egyptians had in place what Schwaller calls thesymbolist interpretation of Egypt they had in place a genuine civilization. Inother words, this was a long period of time not just Egypt, but everywhere else"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"besides that: Vedic India, China and so on. There was in place in the very distantpast a global civilization where human beings understood that they were on thisearth for some reason and their lives were devoted to the execution of thatreason. To put it in a word, it's what Hancock calls the Science of Immortalityand Schwaller calls the \"Doctrine of the Return to the Source.\" This is the basisof all the religions that ever were and no matter that most of them these days,you would never know it in their degenerate and corrupted state. But we're onearth for a purpose.The recycling souls in and out of container bodies?All of these things are connected with that understanding and the important partof Egypt, the Dynastic Egypt we all go to visit and are awed by, is that it is anexample of how civilized human beings once comported themselves. And when Itake these trips to Egypt, they suddenly understand the problems of buildingthem is pointed out and their significance....the philosophical, science andspiritual significance of these monumental structures.\" Egypt Virtual Reality Website:John Anthony West: \"I've been working for about a year with a friend of minewho is an animation expert and in the forefront of virtual reality technology andwe're putting out a set of DVDs and CD ROMS on magical Egypt, which iseffectively a tour, the next best thing We go in-depth precisely into thisphilosophy and all the things that are made relevant and demonstrable by thiswhole question of the Sphinx.Because proving that the Sphinx is that much older, or very much older, andthen understanding the implications of what's involved in not just the Sphinxitself which is arguably the most moving and certainly biggest statue on earth,but also the temples around it that are built with a technology we don'tunderstand and can't emulate. If this is correct, it is much older, it means thatnot only the ability to create this spectacular art masterpiece, but also tosurround it with temples made with a technology we don't understand and can'tcopy, means that tremendously civilized, far more civilized people thanourselves, lived in the very distant past.Our Sphinx theory is one of the wedges that can open the door to learn moreabout that advanced civilization and the fact that someone was buildingmegalithic structures in Egypt and around this planet long before 5,000 yearsago.\""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"An early 20th century photograph of the Sphinx in theGiza pyramid complex near Cairo, Egypt. http://www.magicalegypt.com (virtual reality tour)http://www.jawest.com (West's research and communications) Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
