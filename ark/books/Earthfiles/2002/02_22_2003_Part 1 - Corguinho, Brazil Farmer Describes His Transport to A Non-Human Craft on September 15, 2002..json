(See Earthfiles December 19 and 21, 2002.) Felipe had takendramatic photographs of scorched body marks on the bed sheet and ceiling ofUrandir's bedroom.

February 2003 photograph © 2003 byLinda Moulton Howe.Urandir Oliveira was born on March 14, 1963, in a rural area outside Sao Pauloand is about to have his fortieth birthday. He was born in Maraba Paulista in thestate of Sao Paula, Brazil, to Francisco Gomes and Joao Fernandes De Oliveira.His father was a city service employee in Sao Paulo. Urandir had five brothersand three sisters.By age eight, Urandir realized that when he fought over food with his brothersand sisters at the kitchen table, his hands could bend and twist the metalutensils. He remembers once throwing a fork that kept bending as it hit the tabletop.Urandir recalls physical abductions from Earth locations into an extraterrestrialcraft when he was 13, 23, 27, 35 and 39, plus an encounter in Sao Paulo withET humanoids when he was 23-years-old.Age 13, March 6, 1976, Urandir Oliveira's Extraterrestrial Abduction # 1, SaoPauloWhen he was thirteen on March 6, 1976, at 10 p.m. at his home in Sao Paulo,he had his first encounter with a craft. The beings were tall and blond-haired.Their eyes were like a cat's, vertical honey-colored pupils in blue, green oryellow irises. He understood that the frequency of his mind had been speeded"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"up by the blond humanoids to improve communication. Since then, one of theconsequences has been that Urandir Oliveira's mind control over matterresembles the powers of metal bender, Uri Geller, who linked his abilities to achildhood encounter with a glowing being.Age 23, 1986, Urandir Oliveira's Extraterrestrial Encounter in Sao PauloUrandir had been making money by entertaining people with his mental powersin Sao Paulo. Then one night, he came upon a beggar and child who were hit bya car and broken bones were exposed through their skin. Not knowing how orwhy, he bent down and placed his hands on their terrible wounds and thebleeding stopped. Shortly thereafter, tall blond beings approached him and said,'Now you know what to do with the light energy.'Age 27, 1990, Urandir Oliveira's Extraterrestrial Abduction # 2, Sao PauloThen in 1990, he and a friend were both lifted up in beams of light into a craftwhere Urandir remembers many crystals pulsating with light and \"lightning.\" Heunderstood that the pulsating crystals \"activated human force fields.\"Age 35, 1998, Urandir Oliveira's Extraterrestrial Abduction # 3, CorguinhoFarmIn 1996, Urandir bought 209 acres of farm land in Corguinho between hills anda mesa where local farmers for decades have seen mysterious lights and aerialcraft. His parents and in-laws also moved to the farm to help with the work.Over the next couple of years, Urandir appeared on several Brazilian televisionprograms to demonstrate his Uri Geller-like ability to use his mind to bendmetal, shut off and turn on lights, to move and control the direction of a smallmetal ball and to mentally break metal coins and glass dishes. By 1998, BrazilVerade TV traveled to his Corguinho farm because Urandir informed the stationthat the blond beings were coming back to get him again. The crew wasvideotaping when six lights in an arc appeared in the night sky and descendedtoward the ground. As the arc of lights seemed to lower toward Urandir, hewalked through them into a small beam of light that lifted him into adisc-shaped craft while the Brazil Verade television camera rolled. Some of thatvideo was broadcast in Brazil and the tape was sent to CNN for internationalbroadcast. But to date, Urandir does not think CNN ever aired any of it and hewonders what happened to that professional videotape of his second abduction.What no camera had access to was the inside of the craft. There, tall, blondhumanoids showed Urandir wall screens containing moving images of Earthdestruction by nuclear missiles and nuclear power reactors. Urandir understoodthat the destructions will be caused by changing Earth magnetic fields whichaffect the electronic systems in the missiles and reactors. The blond beings alsoshowed Urandir that three \"fully functional\" pyramids currently covered by sandwill be uncovered for the world to see.Age 39, September 15, 2002, Urandir Oliveira's Extraterrestrial Abduction # 4,Corguinho FarmHis fourth abduction encounter began after 7 p.m. local time on September 15,2002, in the bedroom he and his wife, Jessica, shared in their farm house.Urandir said he had received telepathic information several days before from thebeings that by 10 p.m. on September 15, another transport to a humanoid craftwould occur. So, anticipating another interaction, Urandir told his parents andin-laws, as well as local friends, to be ready for \"a rain of rocks\" that would lastfor seven minutes when Urandir was taken to the non-human craft. That sameweek, Jessica had traveled with their 2-year-old son, Aria, to Sao Paulo, to visitfamily and was not there when the drama unfolded.Interview:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Left to right: Urandir Oliveira, Felipe Branco and Linda Moulton Howe at Ecovila Farmon February 8, 2003 taping the first interview about Urandir's experiences with non-humanbeingssince he was 13-years-old.

Portuguese translation by Luciano Didier, Brazilian FiestaTours, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Felipe Branco, Fazenda Castelo, CampoGrande, MS. : \"He (Urandir) was very anxious because for three days alreadyhe was expecting to be abducted, and there were only three hours left to thetime the beings told him he would be abducted. (He thought it would be 10p.m.). He tried to prepare himself, so he went home and took a shower and puthis shorts on and laid down on the bed. He picked up a book and tried to relax.A few minutes later, he realized a flash in the room. Then he felt his body like afever warming up.WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THAT FLASH?The flash was sort of a light purple, or violet. He is describing it as violet. Theflash took the whole room and then was condensing in the form of the shape ofa tube that included the bed and himself all the way from the bottom of thefloor to the ceiling.Drawing by Urandir Oliveira of the violet light that paralyzed himon his bed and then lifted him through the ceiling © 2003 by Earthfiles.com.AT THAT MOMENT, WHERE IS THE BOOK?The book was in his right hand (extended in the air beyond the right edge of thebed) and when the light flashed, eventually he released the book. The book fellfrom his hand. And he felt sort of a paralyzing. He could not move.

Butknowing in advance already the beam process of abduction (from earlierencounters), he knew it was not going to be painful at all.WHAT IS HAPPENING AFTER THE HEAT AND GOING UPWARD?He felt himself rising up and going through the ceiling. From the point he wasparalyzed, he could not move so much, but from what he could see, he realizedeverything was like normal from inside the light as he is rising. Actually theposition did not allow him to see much, but what he could see are the normalthings like the walls, the door, the window.WHAT HAPPENS AS HE GETS UP TO THE WOOD CEILING?He saw himself going through the ceiling and he could actually see themolecules between the ceiling, like if he were going through foam.FELIPE: Not like a foam rubber, but like a soap, more like soap bubbles, likewhen you wash your hands and you produce the foam that comes out in thesoap.LUCIANO: And then he is turned upright so he is standing after he crosses thatpoint of the ceiling, going through the ceiling.IN THAT SAME VIOLET BEAM?In the same violet light.THE OTHER DAY, HE MENTIONED HE COULD SEE AND HEAR MORE?Even at the height and distance he was, he could see and hear perfectly well,even better than normal, as if everything was amplified. He could see the stonesfalling everywhere, he could hear peoples' conversations and see them downthere.COULD HE SEE THE CRAFT HE WAS RISING INTO?No, he could only see it at the moment he approached it.THE ROCKS ARE FALLING WHY?It was a signal, a sign, that the beings left so that everyone would recognize thatmoment and everyone would know he was being abducted. (Howe Note: Severalpeople on the farm told me during my February visit that Urandir explained theblond beings would produce small rocks falling from the sky for seven minutesas an 'announcement' that Urandir had been transported.)"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Three of the small, spiraled iron rocks found by a visitinggynecologist from Sao Paulo.
