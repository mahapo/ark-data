Strange lights continue to be reported in areas of mutilatedanimals,such as the one on the right videotaped on July 10, 2002 in Villarrica, Chile.Video frame © 2002 by Alberto Sandoval.Yellow areas indicate concentrations of animal deaths that arenow estimated to number well over 300 since april 2002. July 19, 2002 La Pampa Province, Argentina Argentina's recent federalgovernment assertion that red-nosed mice, Oxymycterus rufus, are the culpritsin the country's wave of animal mutilations has not stopped the unusual animaldeaths. On July 1, rancher Camilo Lisiardo near Rufino in Cordoba Provincewest of Buenos Aires, found one of his calves (sex not specified) lying on its leftside, dead. The right jaw was stripped of all muscle tissue, so cleanly the bonelooked like it had laid in the sun for weeks. Its tongue and right eye had beencut out, a 4 centimeter-diameter circle of hide was excised around the naval, andthe rectum was cored out. By Wednesday, July 3, veterinarian Hernando Brandino examined the calf. Heused a knife on the carcass and compared his cuts to the mutilator's cuts. Dr."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Brandino said his experiment supported the hypothesis that a sharp instrumenthad been used on the calf. On Friday, July 5, in San Francisco del Monte de Oro, a 5-month-old cowlooked \"as though a machine had gone into its mouth and sucked out everythinginside. In very fresh cuts, its ears had been removed and so had the tongue fromdeep within the throat. One eye was gone along with the intestines and anus. ElDiario de la Republica reported that all the cuts appeared burned and \"part ofthe tail has similar (burned) lesions.\" In Tucaman - a town famous over many decades for unidentified aerial lights -seven goats and eight cows were found dead and mutilated. Resident Maria delCarmen told Diario La Gaceta de Tucaman that she saw a bright light at night,followed by the discovery of the dead animals.Cow's udder cleanly excised without blood or fluid on a La Pampa Provinceranch in Argentina.

Professionals Reject the Argentina Government's Mouse Theory Tenured faculty at the National University of Rio Cuarto and the NationalUniversity of Cordoba rejected the government's mouse explanation, along withGustavo Siegenthaler, Director of the National Museum of History of La Pampa.He explained to reporters that the Oxymycterus rufus is not even known to LaPampa Province, based on a \"Survey of Vertebrates in the Province of LaPampa\" in 1986 to 1992. Siegenthaler said, \"We have placed between 70 and120 traps each night and have never found that species, and it does not appear inthe bibliography either.\" Further, the book Mammals of Argentina by Migule Lillo Institute says the\"red-muzzled mouse\" lives in the Mesopotamia region between the Parana andUruguay Rivers northeast of Buenos Aires Province. 19 Cattle Found Inside A Large Water Tank Perhaps the strangest event so far in the entire Argentina 2002 saga occurred atthe end of June, but has only recently been translated. The location was Sucowest of Rio Cuarto very near the border of San Luis Province. A well-knownlivestock producer found nineteen of his cattle inside a large water tank that hada sheet metal tank and a metal conical cap. Nine of the cattle were dead,according to a veterinarian who was called to examine the animals. Theremaining ten animals were alive inside the water tank, but near death from thefreezing cold temperature of the water. Police also investigated. So far, no onehas been able to explain how the 19 cattle were put inside the tank which waseven surrounded by a tall fence. If you consider eyewitness accounts in the United States over the past 30 yearsin which people have seen beams of light come out of glowing discs in the skyand have watched animals rise up in the beams and then be lowered bcak downinto pastures inside the beams, such a technology might be able to put nineteencattle inside the water tank. If that did happen, it still does not answer thequestion: why would anyone, or anything, want to put nineteen cattle inside a"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"large water tank? Strange Lights and Entities Are Being Seen On July 5, twenty-five people in the village of Carmen de Patagones inComarca Viedma, Argentina watched for nearly a half hour as a lightapproached and receded \"like some sort of zoom lens\" and changed colors fromred to blue to white as it moved. Eyewitnesses also said that the object moved ina zig-zag pattern and when it stopped mid-air, it went into a swinging motion. In Chascoumus, Argentina, residents called the police after a series of strangelights that changed colors landed on the edge of a lagoon and near the Fish andNautical Club. In Entre Rios Province, a resident in Crespo filmed fifteen aerial lights which\"spun around in circles for ten minutes.\" His home video was broadcast by localnews media as proof of the odd phenomenon. Police in two police cars saw apowerful light approach them on a road. The light sparked, \"similar to aphotographer's flash.\" The light's presence stopped the motors and electricalsystems in the police cars. When the bright luminosity vanished, suddenly policesirens and engines turned back on. One of the most bizarre cases was investigated by the C.O.R. Group in RioCuarto, Argentina. Its field investigators traveled on Sunday, July 14 to RioCuarto, a town of 7000 people devoted to farming and livestock. There, theinvestigators interviewed Pedro and Estela Moine who had a startling encounteron Wednesday, July 3. It was 9 p.m. when the couple walked along pathwaysthat wind through pastures and an old railroad yard once used for loading grain.What they thought were \"voices\" talking in a language neither understood,followed by \"strange 'O' sounds. They were like conversations in a strangelanguage,\" Pedro explained later. Then Pedro saw a \"a thing with human shape\" that lacked arms and legs, seemedto have a white glow and apparently could \"fly or float\" in the air. Rather thanretreat, Pedro and Estela ran after it. The entity hid behind the control room ofthe truck scale at the grain-loading dock. Pedro ran toward the area and wasamazed to see the entity \"rising as a plane taking off, flying at an altitude of fivemeters, and disappearing behind a large metal shed.\" As Pedro and Estela discussed more details afterward, the couple explained thatthe humanoid mass \"of the apparition appeared to be a body covered from headto toe in some sort of mantle, as if the entity wore a hat and long raincoat thathung down to its feet. The above report from C.O.R. was sent by Mario Luis Bracamonte to ScottCorrales, Director, Institute of Hispanic Ufology, Bradford, Pennsylvania, fortranslation. Two weeks later on July 16, El Diario de La Pampa reported that police werecalled when a young woman fainted after a \"close encounter with some sort ofgreen dwarf that appeared before her in the late evening as she walked in thevicinity of her home. This incident was further confirmed by personnel from anemergency ambulance service who said the woman was treated by a Dr. Brum. The same day, Diario La Manana reported that three residents and threepolicemen from the Mercedes Police Department in Gobernador Ugarte\"witnessed something strange over a farmhouse something that radiated a verypowerful white light from its lower section, making it difficult to see what wasabove the light.\" Villarrica, Chile on July 10, 2002"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Villarrica, Chile is highlighted in yellow, west of Bahia Blanca and General Roca.The La Pampa Province stretches across Argentina to the Andes. La Pampa has hadthe longest concentration of animal mutilations since April 2002. In the north near the Argentina and Chile border on July 10 in late evening, ElDiario Austral de La Arucania in Chile reported that dozens of families and acontroller at Radio Apumanque in Villarrica watched an unidentified aerialobject over the town. Patricio Castillo at Radio Apumanque said, \"I looked and saw a luminous objectwith three red lights in one of its sides. It was still for a few seconds and thenmade a very swift movement.\" Pilar Castillo, host of the \"Morning Talk with Pili\" was leaving a meeting andsaw an object that \"was like a shooting star that changed colors as it went away.It came from the direction of Nancul to Villarica. It was red for some minutesand then turned violet.\" Interview: Scott Corrales, Director, Institute of Hispanic Ufology, Bradford,Pennsylvania: \"Argentinian reporters I am in touch with say that almost everyprovince in Argentina is reporting animal mutilations despite the government'sodd effort to blame it all on the red-muzzled mouse that veterinarians in LaPampa have never even seen before. What is your perspective on the many reports of so many aerial lightsightings and encounters with humanoids and dwarfs? It's possible that whatever intelligence is behind this phenomenon has decided toput 'more toys on the board' to see how we (humans) react. Cattle mutilationshave gotten our attention and now we have the addition of lights. Further, weare getting cases involving the police and eyewitnesses. It seems almost as ifthere is a new emphasis on the lights and not the animals. But in Uruguay wherethe government tried to blame the mutilations on yellow jackets, there weresheep mutilations this past weekend. There certainly have been many new mutilations reported in cattle, goatsand sheep in Argentina since the Senasa announcement. Yes. The impression people there have is that the government had to bring thingsto an end for political reasons in order to reduce the impact on the commoditiesmarket. There had also been bloody political repression going on in BuenosAires at the time. In fact, there were stories of the police infiltrating rioter groupsin order to shoot them and that happened only three weeks ago. Meaning that the police were politically connected and assigned to killcertain groups of people threatening the status quo? That's correct. Given the nature of the economic crisis, Argentina is going backto a more repressive tone. Certainly this is being seen in Buenos Aires. The"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"impression that the Senasa report gave everyone was that the government wantsto bring this to an end. But the press conference did not stop mutilations. Their main concern was to give out an answer and then accuse the majornewspapers of, 'If you people pursue these stories, you're being sensationalist.You are creating the panic because we've already told you. It's the red-muzzledmouse.' The result has been that the main Buenos Aires media stopped reporting aboutanimal mutilations, even while the provincial newspapers and online media keepreporting them as they happen. There has always been the odd disconnect in the animal mutilation mysteryaround the world that has always been there between that which ispolitically unacceptable to discuss versus the truth. No matter what excuseis brought up by governments to explain away animal mutilations, it nevermakes them stop. One can't help but wonder why did SENASA come upwith the mouse story? It probably seemed the easiest. Any other answer such as satanic cults, voodo,santaria would have demanded expensive police investigations and arrests toquiet the public concern. So the government knew that was not the easy wayout. But if you say a mouse did it, no one expects anything from you except,'OK, you guys found an answer and that is fine.' Especially when the country isgoing through an economic depression which Argentina has not seen since the1930s. The mouse answer satisfied. Satisfied who? It satisfied the government. It did not satisfy the public at large, the vets, theranchers who lost the animals and lost the money tied up in those animals. Unlike the chupacabras cases in Puerto Rico, Mexico and Central America backin 1995, those were spaced out over time. In one week, you might have a coupleof cases and then nothing for another week or so. But in Argentina, you aregetting cases every day from different towns and it is difficult keeping them allstraight. That's my point. It is a massive phenomenon in a very large countrycovering at least eight provinces and maybe many more. The governmenthas not really done anything effective and veterinarians are embarrassedby the explanation of their own government because they know it is nottrue. The vets who have examined the mutilated carcasses have neverfound any mouse droppings. That's correct and they have come out and said so in the media. However, thevets are very deferential toward the universities and SENASA even though theyknow the mice are not the answer. Meanwhile, mutilated animals continue with more lights and entities beingseen. Right, there is no doubt about that. I think we're now waiting for the next act. Will it happen in the fall? Interestingly, compared to what happened in Chile back in 2000, everythingstarted back then in April also on Good Friday with a wave of animalmutilations. Mutilations started in Argentina with intensity this April 2002.Back in 2000 in Chile, the mutilations ran through the summer. Then inSeptember came the most dramatic cases involving chupacabras-type creatures.In one case, there were students returning home from school and they foundthemselves facing a small, red-eyed creature with wings that hovered off the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ground at eye level and stared them down. The boys ran off. There were othercases in which people were at home, heard something walking on the roof, wentdown and saw apelike, red-eyed creatures on the rooftops. Everyone wants something to blame in animal mutilations and the cause in Chilewere the strange entities. Finally, all the Chile phenomena faded out aroundNovember to December 2000. Now in Argentina, we're seeing the mutilated carcasses and people are reportinglights. But they don't have definitive eyewitnesses to something in the act ofmutilating the animals as people reported in Chile and the earlier chupacabrasreports. Without that, the mouse is a convenient answer to shut down theBuenos Aires media and say the government investigated and has an answer even if the answer is not true.\" More Information: Mutilated Calf \"Preserved\" for Fifteen Days On July 17, 2002, La Voz de Bragado, reported that a calf was found mutilatedin the Province of Buenos Aires near Bragado. Its tongue, jaw flesh, eyes, earsand rectal tissue had been excised.The cattle owner, Oscar Latorre, told reporters that the most extraordinaryaspect of the calf's death is the fact that the animal has been dead for fifteendays, yet \"does not present any signs of decomposition and has not beendevoured by vultures or foxes, who are frequently seen around this area.These photos of the mutilated calf's bloodless excisions below are all © 2002 byLa Voz de Bragado, Bragado, Argentina.
