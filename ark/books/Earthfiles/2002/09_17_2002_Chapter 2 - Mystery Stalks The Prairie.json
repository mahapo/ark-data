A veterinarian's theorythat the drug Ketaset could have been used for this purpose greatly interestedinvestigating officers. Deputies Experiment With Cattle Tranquilizer The lawmen decided to perform an experiment to observe the effects of Ketaset"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"on a calf. A Teton County rancher, who was interested in seeing the mutilationssolved, offered to donate a crippled steer calf for the experiment. A veterinarianconducted the experiment with lawmen from both Teton and Cascade Countiesobserving. The 250-pound calf was initially injected with 5cc of Ketaset. Seven and a halfminutes later, the calf still appeared normal. So, another 10cc of Ketaset wasinjected. Within three and a half minutes, the calf was down on the ground. Bythe time four minutes had passed, the calf's heartbeat had increased from 60 to120 beats per minute. During the rapid heartbeat, the veterinarian inserted a 12gauge needle in the calf's jugular vein and the blood pumped out rapidly andregularly. The calf's heartbeat slowed to 90 within 12 1/2 minutes and after 21 minuteshad passed, the calf was on its feet. Twenty-eight and a half minutes afterinjection of Ketaset, the calf was no longer under the influence of the drug. Thecalf was later returned to its owner. Those witnessing the experiment agreed that during the period of time when thecalf was rendered unconscious by the drug, it was unable to resist anything thatwas done to it. The experiment proved that Ketaset could be used to quicklyrender an animal helpless and that it increased the heartbeat which reduced thetime needed to remove the animal's blood. The experiment was but a part of the intensive efforts being made by law officersall over north-central Montana to solve the mysterious mutilations. With theadvent of August, the number of mutilations increased considerably and attimes, the officers were hard-pressed to follow up on all reports. Three Mutilated Cattle On One Night Pete Howard, Sheriff of Teton County, may have set some sort of record whenhe investigated reports of three mutilations in one night. The first report involveda 12-day-old heifer calf that had appeared to be in good health two days earlierwhen seen by the rancher. The calf was found in an isolated area lying on agrassy hillside about 50 yards from a stock pond. Sheriff Howard commented onthe fact that there seemed to be water nearby in most mutilation cases. This particular incident was one of the few in which tracks were found in thearea. A set of visible tire tracks in the grass indicated a vehicle had come downfrom the top of the hill, stopped on a small bench above the calf, and had laterturned around and gone back up the hill. However, there were no tracks visiblein the immediate area of the calf's carcass. There was no indication of a struggle and the investigating officers were unableto find any blood in the area. When the post mortem was done by a localveterinarian, he found the body cavity almost completely void of blood. Eventhe heart had very little blood in it. The vulva and rectum had been removedfrom the body, along with a piece of hide about one foot in diameter. Alsomissing were some of the internal organs, including the bladder."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Puncture wounds like these in the jugular vein of the animal have beenfound in a number of mutilation cases. The theory has been advanced that a salt solutionto facilitate blood removal was injected in the one opening while the blood was pumpedfrom the other.

Although the mother cow was in the area when lawmen arrived, she mad noeffort to go near the dead calf, nor would other cattle in the herd go near it. After delivering the calf carcass to the veterinarian for autopsy, Sheriff Howardasked Cascade County Deputies Captain Keith Wolverton, Ken Anderson andArne Sand to join him and assist with the investigation of the other twomutilated calves. Those two dead calves had been reported by a Fairfield area rancher. The areawhere they were found was quite remote with no houses nearby. As in theprevious case, there was a pond of water nearby. It appeared that one of thecalves had dropped into the water and had been dragged back away from thewater about 12 or 14 feet. The sheriff's report stated: \"It appeared that possiblytwo people had dragged the animal as there were no hesitation marks in the skidpath as would likely be present if one person had dragged it.\" This calf was a Black Angus heifer about four months old. It was missing the tipof its left ear, the vaginal and rectal areas had been removed, along with the tail.As noted in a number of mutilations, the animal's eyes protruded extensively. The second calf, a five-month-old Hereford heifer, had a large diagonal incisionunder the left rib section near the flank. The intestines were protruding from thewound through which the female reproductive organs had been removed.The incision in the side of this mutilated calf is the type used to performCaesareans on cows which cause lawmen to consider the possibility that those doingthe mutilations were familiar with anatomy and surgical procedures. The calf's femaleorgans had been removed and the intestines were protruding from the wound."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Again, the tip of the left ear was missing. The incision in the calf's side was thekind usually made when performing a Caesarean on a cow to deliver a calf,giving further credibility to the theory that whoever was doing the mutilationswas familiar with anatomy and surgical procedures. The carcasses of the twocalves were found about twelve feet apart. The owner said when he first viewed the dead calves, he noted that the herdfrom which they came was watering at the pond, but in an area they normallydid not use. He said the cattle appeared to be quite listless. But, shortly after theofficers arrived, the cattle spooked and ran off. A neighbor reported seeing a car drive through the herd a few nights earlier.Officers speculated about the possibility that the animals were selected beforemutilation. Just one week after officers investigated the three calf mutilations in TetonCounty, the Cascade County Sheriff's Office received two calls one day andanother on the ensuing day regarding cattle mutilations in the county. Each ofthe three incidents had unusual circumstances not encountered earlier and theseadded to the mystery. First, a unique mutilation method was revealed in an investigation north ofCascade involving a bull calf. The rancher found the dead calf while checkingcattle on top of a high butte. The calf was lying on its left side about forty feetfrom a stock tank. Again, water was near the mutilation site. The right hind legof the calf had been removed in a circular cut that appeared to be made with asharp instrument. The cut went completely through the leg bone just below thehip socket. Even though the bone was severed, investigating officers could findno trace of bone dust. The circular cut extended toward the midsection,exposing the stomach area. All of the sex organs had been removed, includingthe testicles, but the empty scrotum was still intact. Lawmen encountered something different when they examined this mutilated calf,as the hind leg had been removed in a cut that went through the bone as well as the fleshjust below the hip socket. Even though the bone was severed, there was no bone dust.When officersturned over the dead calf, they found that one of the calf's organs had been removed andthe calflaid on top of it, smashing it.

Officers agreed the organ had to have been removed first,placed on the ground and the calf turned over on top of it. Although the entirearea was checked, no footprints or other evidence were found. Five nightsearlier, a car had been observed at 7:30 p.m. and at 11:50 p.m. on the approachfrom the main county road. The top of the butte may also be reached byclimbing a pipeline drainage from a pump house 600 feet below to the top of thebutte. The absence of tracks baffled officers when they investigated another reportedmutilation the same week near Belt. Few tracks have ever been found atmutilation sites, but this time it was an even greater mystery because the deadcow was found in a plowed field. Mutilation In Plowed Field, But Still No Tracks A theory had been advanced earlier that whoever was mutilating stood on asheet of cardboard to avoid leaving tracks. However, in this case, the use ofcardboard as well as footprints or vehicle tracks would have pressed down thefurrows of loose soil. The cow was found three-quarters of a mile from the fenceline and road. When the rancher first found his cow, he noticed that one ear was missing. Afterdragging her out of the field, he noticed that the two teats on the right side hadbeen cut off and the rectal area removed, obviously with a very sharpinstrument. It was at this point he called the sheriff's office. This mutilated cow was found in a plowed fieldthree quarters of a mile from the fence line, but there wereno tracks in the area. The rectal tissue had been removed. Later examination showed that the cow had an incision underneath the front leg.Sgt. Les Bobier, one of the investigating deputies, cleaned the area and opened"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the wound. But no special significance was given to it until months later whensome deputies from Idaho were visiting the Cascade County Sheriff'sDepartment. In looking at the department's photos of mutilations, one of theIdaho deputies remarked about this cow's incision. He said there had been asimilar wound in a mutilated cow his department had examined. They had calledin a veterinarian to do an autopsy and the veterinarian inserted an instrumentinto the wound and discovered that the opening went all the way to the heart. This wound underneath the front leg in the mutilated cowdid not hold special significance at the time of the Montana investigation.Months later some deputies from Idaho remarked that they had found a similarwound in a mutilated cow in their region and a veterinarian had discovered the woundwent all the way to the heart.

Incidentally, this date was the exact firstanniversary of the first mutilation report received by the Cascade CountySheriff's Office. A writer of \"who done it\" stories might have dubbed this incident, The Mysteryof the Missing Calf. In this instance, the rancher found his mutilated Herefordcow in a locked pasture about one-half mile from the county road. Her calf,born earlier in the spring, was missing. Lawmen were unable to find any tracksexcept those made by the cattle. At the time of this writing, the calf has not beenfound. This cow mutilation differed from the other cases because the reproductiveorgans and teats were not removed. The cow's left ear, tongue and some hidewere missing. There was an attempt to skin the jaw. Examination showed thatthe gland behind the left ear had been removed. The fact that there were no tracks puzzled the officers. The gate to the pasturewas locked and anyone wanting to reach the cow would have had to walk about"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"a half mile from the county road after crossing the fence; unless a helicopter orsome other air or space vehicle was used - a theory which has been considered. Although this was Cascade County's first case in which a calf was missing,Chouteau County had one similar incident. It was reported earlier in the year onMarch 24, and was investigated by Deputy Robert Blades, another deputy and alivestock inspector. In that case, it was necessary for the rancher to take theofficers to the scene in a four-wheel-drive vehicle because of muddy conditionsnear the Missouri River. The rancher told officers he had discovered one of hiscows was missing that morning and that the rest of the cattle seemed to be verynervous and jumpy. A large heifer cow was found lying at the bottom of a coulee. Deputies couldfind no human footprints in the area and they could not find any vehicle tracks,except those made by the rancher. There was blood and signs of a scuffle in acircle about ten yards wide around the carcass. The mutilation had apparentlytaken place only a short time before, as the carcass was still warm and steamingwhere the blood was draining out. The udder bag was removed by a very smoothincision and the cow's intestines and internal organs were hanging out from therectal area. Dog or coyote tracks were found about 20 yards and farther from thecarcass, but not closer. In searching the area, the officers came across a newborn calf that had beenmutilated, but was still alive. Its tongue and one lip had been removed. This days old calf was found mutilated, but still alive.Its tongue and one lip had been removed.Photograph © 1975 by Cascade County Sheriff's Office.The mutilated calf did not belong to the mutilated heifer, according to therancher's records, but the mutilated heifer's calf, born two days earlier, wasmissing and it had a white face. The mutilated calf was brown. The entire area was searched for the missing calf, but it was not found. However,four days later, it mysteriously reappeared in the same pasture lying on a snow"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"bank. It was barely alive, but had not been mutilated. The rancher later told authorities that four of his calves were born deadfollowing the incident, although his cows had not had stillborns before. He saidhe put the four stillborn calves in a ravine and they were immediately eaten bypredators. However, the mutilated cow and calf were not touched by predatorsand finally deteriorated due to the elements. This is Square Butte north of Cascade where a mutilated calfwas found on top of the butte. The area would have to be reached either by acounty road or by climbing a drainage that went from a pipeline at the top of thebutte to a pump house 500 feet below. Although the area was carefully searched, nofootprintsor tire tracks were found. Photograph © 1975 by Cascade County Sheriff's Office. Another unusual aspect of the case surfaced when tracks resembling those madeby a horse were found in one part of the fenced pasture, but the rancher statedthere had been no horses in the pasture for 20 years.To be continued in Chapter 3 - Appeal Made for Public's HelpCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
