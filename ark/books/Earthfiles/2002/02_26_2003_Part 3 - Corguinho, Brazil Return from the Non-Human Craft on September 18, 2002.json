During our February 10,2003, interview about the experience, I asked Urandir if he and the others werein the same room all three days. He answered, \"Yes, it's like the walls wereendless. I walked, but never reached the walls, so it gave the impression that theroom was really big. I explained to him that other people have described\"infinite\" interiors in non-human craft and have been given information that timeand space are some how distorted within the craft. But Urandir did not havesuch knowledge.What he says he did understand was that the meeting in the \"endless\" room withmany other non-human beings was supposed to have lasted for fifteen Earthdays, not only three. But many of the people who had been at the Corghinhofarm on the night of September 15 2002, when the scorched body prints werefound on Urandir's bed and the bedroom ceiling told friends, relatives and theBrazilian media about what had happened. By September 16, 2002, Braziliantelevision reporters had traveled to Urandir's farm house to wait for a craft toreturn him. Felipe Branco and others who had been shocked the previous nightby the bedroom scene had already locked the bedroom and shuttered thewindows so no one could enter, including the curious media.When no dramatic aerial or beam activity was seen on September 16 or 17, themedia left the farm. Urandir said, \"In the end, the blond being told me that thetrip was going to be interrupted, cut short, because of all the movement downthere with the media which was not in accordance with what had beencommitted to me\" by the beings. He understood that the non-humans did notwant sensation, but left the physical evidence in the bedroom that unusualenergy had interacted there for researchers to analyze.On the evening of September 18, 2002, when the farm was relatively quiet, thetall blond being walked Urandir down the stairs in the craft to the place he hadentered in the violet light. There he went back into the bubble where the silver,glowing, leotard-like suit dematerialized from his body and his own underpantsmaterialized on him again.Urandir Oliveira, Farmer, Ecovila Fezenda, Corguinho, Mato Grosso doSul, Brazil. Portuguese translation by Luciano Didier, Brazilian FiestaTours, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; and Felipe Branco, Fazenda Castelo, CampoGrande, MS:\"The violet light was already there and a lot denser.DENSER THAN HE REMEMBERED COMING UP (ON SEPTEMBER 15)?When the violet transforms into a tube that comes down, the light becomes moresubtle.DOES URANDIR WALK INTO THE BEAM OR DOES IT COME DOWNAROUND HIM?At this point, he walks into the light. As he is going back down in the beam,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"about half way down, this light changes him from a standing position and putshim in the previous exact position when he was on the bed before (onSeptember 15, 2002). The very same position and he is paralyzed again to go allthe way through the roof and ceiling of his house and back to where he was.\"I later asked Urandir to check the roof and see if the same body print was on thetiles. He could not find any evidence there, but a more thorough examination isgoing to be made beneath the roof tiles and the upper side of the wood beneaththe tiles by a scientist in March who is also investigating the Corghinhophenomena.ANY DIFFERENT FEELING THEN?Like as if his bones are stretching.FELIPE: Like cracking joints.AS IF THE BONE JOINTS SEEM TO SNAP IN SOME WAY?The whole skeleton of all his bones go snap, snap.I WONDER IF IT HAS TO DO WITH MOLECULAR EXPANSION ANDCONTRACTION OF PASSING HIS MATTER BODY THROUGH THE ROOFAND ONTO THE BED?Yes, it does have something to do with expanded molecular structure so he caninteract with matter again. It's as if they are re-tuning the body.AT THIS POINT, IS HE LOOKING THROUGH THE COLORED LIGHT ANDCAN HE SEE THE ROOM LIKE HE DID BEFORE?Yes, exactly. He can see through the same light to the room.WHEN DOES HE KNOW HE IS BACK ON THE BED?He saw himself going through the ceiling and then he feels his body touch thebed. But before he actually approached the bed, he could not see that the bedwas burned because the way in which he was paralyzed would not allow him to.So the (violet) light goes off and everything comes back to normal and he standsup, switched on the room light, and then he is surprised with his bed because itis so burnt. He thought he had been melted there!WHAT ABOUT THE CEILING?There was some sort of smoke in the ceiling still coming out."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Photos above and below taken on February 9, 2003:Urandir Oliveira's body imprint on the blue and white cotton sheet,pillow and wood ceiling. Photographs © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe.White arrow points at the impression of an aurasurrounding Urandir's head scorch in the wood ceiling.I was puzzled when I realized three facts as I photographed and gathered clothand wood samples from the sheet and the ceiling.First, if a body leaves the bed on September 15, 2002 and goes through theceiling, that would seem to me to be the body exit marks. So, where were thebody return marks on September 18? Urandir said he understood that theparalysis of his body in the laying down position both leaving the bed andreturning were calculated precisely by the non-human blonds to be the same.Thus, no second set of marks. The molecular precision he says is related to thepassage of his body matter through other matter such as the wood ceiling. Arethe beings capturing time and playing it back, so to speak, to return him soprecisely? Urandir says he knows the beings do use and manipulate timelines,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"but he is uncertain if such use of time was involved in his particular September15, 2002, transport in and out of his bedroom.Second, I asked Urandir to lay down along the right edge of the bed so I couldcompare his body length and proportion to the body print on the sheet. As helaid down, I videotaped the comparison. I then realized that the scorch marks onthe pillow and the heavy scorch mark surrounded by the aura of his head in thewood ceiling were in different places. The head mark in the ceiling and the restof the torso and legs are further forward and more to the right of the pillowmark. A logical speculation about this difference is that Urandir's body wasmoving forward toward the head of the bed as it was lifted upward by the violetbeam technology.Third, neither the right hand nor the feet made any imprints on the sheet or inthe ceiling. The right hand was holding a book off the edge of the bed and bothUrandir's feet hung out over the end of the bed, he told me. I asked him why hethought there were no scorch marks of his hand or feet in the ceiling. He wasuncertain, but said he understood from the non-humans that the energy beamthat lifted his body was precisely tuned to the molecules of his body against thebed in order to separate them from the bed.Scorch marks where head was on pillow, right arm was extended, and torso laid on bed."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Torso, testicles and lower legs down to ankles.

The close-up below shows the variations in the affected cottonsheet where Urandir Oliveira's right leg experienced more scorching than the left leg,,as did the right side of the body in general.SO MUCH SCORCHING AND YET HIS SKIN NOT BEING BURNED, THATIS AMAZING.'Extraordinary technology,' he says.WHAT WENT THROUGH HIS MIND AS HE LOOKED AT THE SHEET ANDTHE CEILING?At the time, he started touching himself thinking, 'Have I melted?' And hewanted to know his weight, so he climbed on a scale and he lost 4 kilos (8.8pounds) in those three days.DID THE BEINGS FEED HIM ANYTHING?Some tablets with different flavors.DID THEY TASTE GOOD TO HIM?If he wanted a meat flavor, they would give a meat flavor. If he wanted a sweetor apple flavor, he would have an apple flavor.DID THEY GIVE HIM LIQUID?Water that was much lighter than our own water.HE FELT PERFECTLY FINE?Relaxed, peaceful, joyful.SO HE IS NOW STANDING IN THE BEDROOM. THE CEILING ISSMOKING. HE IS LOOKING AT HIS OWN BODY TO SEE IF HE ISBURNED.Then he tries to open the door of the room and it's locked. He opened thewindow and it is blocked from the outside. It is blocked with bars. Everyonelocked the room after he was gone (on September 15) after the abduction tomake sure no one would walk into the room."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THE BODY PRINTS HAD BEEN THERE FOR THREE DAYS.Yes, and he did not know.AND NO ONE KNEW WHEN HE WAS COMING BACK?Exactly.HE IS LOCKED IN HIS OWN BEDROOM.Ye s .HOW DID HE GET OUT?He has an intercom phone, so he called his parents who live on the farm andthey rushed to the room to open it.HE WAS GONE FOR AT LEAST THREE DAYS AND HUMANS GO TO THEBATHROOM ON A DAILY BASIS. WHAT DID THEY PROVIDE IN THATCRAFT?There was some sort of a cabin, almost transparent, a plasma material. And theonly need or urge he had was to urinate. He did not feel any other urge. Whenhe arrived at the plasma material, there was no hole, no basin, nothing. So, hethought, 'Well, I will just urinate here.'WHAT HAPPENED?So he starts urinating and when it is about 10 centimeters for the urine to touchthe ground, it would disappear.HE SAID HE IS STANDING BEFORE A PLASMA. IS IT LIKE FOG?Same material as the bubble.SO HE WOULD STEP INTO IT, BEGIN URINATING AND IT JUSTDISAPPEARS?Before it touches the floor.DO THE BLOND BEINGS URINATE?Yes, not as much as we do, but they do.AND EAT?The same tablets that they provided him.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Sampling process on February 9, 2003, where I measuredand removed sections from the body print along with normal controlsfrom the sheet, pillow and ceiling.
