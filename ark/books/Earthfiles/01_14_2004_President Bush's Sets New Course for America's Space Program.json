Manned mission to Mars by 2030. The President said that humans \"need to touch and see for ourselves. We do not know where this journey will end, but we do know this: human beings are headed into the cosmos.\" The robot rover Spirit rolled backwards today for about one foot and did a clockwise pivot of 45 degrees after NASA engineers cut the last cable that has linked Spirit to its air bag-covered lander. \"We're ready to roll,\" said flight director, Chris Lewicki. NASA's current plan is to start Spirit on its independent geology mission into the Gusev Crater in a few hours, beginning at 3 a.m. ET, early Thursday morning, January 15, 2004. The goal is to explore a crater and hills in the distance in its search for evidence that Gusev Crater once was filled with water. The trip to the crater will take about six weeks. Along the way, Spirit will photograph and take soil and rock samples. http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/home/index.html Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
