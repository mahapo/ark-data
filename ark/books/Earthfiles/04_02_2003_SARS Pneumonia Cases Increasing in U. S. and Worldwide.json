This new travel advisory is intended to limit the spread of SARS by reducing travel to high risk areas. This is the first time in the history of WHO that such travel advice has been issued for specific geographical areas because of an outbreak of an infectious disease. The SARS situation in Hong Kong is continuing with significant increase in cases and indications that SARS is spreading beyond hospitals. These developments raise questions about transmission, in addition to well-documented face-to-face exposure to droplets released when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Epidemiologists wonder if SARS is being transmitted in Hong Kong in other ways such as toilet water in pipes. Particular concern centers on 117 SARS cases in a high rise apartment complex in the Amoy Garden, Kowloon district of Hong Kong. Also, many questions persist about the large SARS outbreak in Guangdong"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Province, China which borders Hong Kong. The Guangdong outbreak is the largest reported and has also shown evidence of spread into the wider community. New information provided today by provincial authorities of more than 300 new cases in March alone indicates the SARS outbreak continues to increase. More Information: David Heymann, Executive Director of Communicable Diseases at the World Health Organization (W.H.O.) in Geneva, Switzerland, recommends that any person who has a sudden fever above 100 degrees Fahrenheit accompanied by difficulty breathing should go immediately to an emergency room. Patients who have received good hospital support care, including ventilators, have survived. In fact, the mortality rate of the SARS pneumonia is running only about 3 to 5 %, but the potential severe lung damage in some of the cases demands expert medical treatment and x-rays.
