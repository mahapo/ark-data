S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The bases are about 45 miles east of Philadelphia, 50 miles south of New York City, 60 miles north of Atlantic City and 10 miles west of the Atlantic ocean. The Fort Dix / McGuire Air Force Base / Lakehurst Naval Air Station complex covers 42,000 acres. Click back to Part I, Status Report IV To be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 3 of Status Report I V, written for the June 28-30, 1985, MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium Proceedings in conjunction with the national MUFON conference held in Saint Louis, Missouri. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report V begins at Earthfiles 012805 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Leonard H. Stringfield: \"3. The Retrieval Operation. It was maximum security, said Morse, who alone in his patrol car received word by radio that a state of alert was in effect at McGuire AFB as a result of the shooting incident. He was ordered to Gate # 5 to answer the request of a state police officer who had been 'running code' with the MP during his encounter at Ft. Dix and wanted admission to the airbase. Morse was ordered to 'comply,' but when the trooper wanted to get closer to the runway he was not allowed to do so, and he was angry. On orders by radio, Morse was told that all personnel - including other members of his security police unit and Morse - were restricted from entry into the roped-off zone. [After the shooting of the non-human entity], taking command was a new and unfamiliar team of Blue Berets that suddenly descended onto the scene, just moments after the runway had been cordoned off. With speed and efficiency, 'they took over,' he said, 'and when asked who they were, we were told nothing and ordered to stay outside the ropes.' Perplexed by this covert action, Morse noted that all of them were staff sergeants and up, wearing fatigues without patches or insignia. And for headgear, he said, 'they wore blue berets just like mine.' "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" In one letter, Morse vaguely speculated they were 'undercover cops' and by phone he said he felt certain 'they' were stationed somewhere at McGuire to account for their quick deployment to the runway. In support of this, when asked if helicopters were seen or heard overhead or landed on or near the scene, his reply was negative. This, it seems, would rule out any notion that they had been transferred from an outside base. It also strengthened his belief and mine that a UFO had not crashed or been disabled nearby requiring close tactical air support. But what of a landed craft, perhaps one that touch-landed earlier at Ft. Dix? Could it have deployed one or more of its kind to perform a duty, forever unknown, at one or both of the adjoining military installations? The book, Clear Intent © 1984 by Lawrence Fawcett and Barry Greenwood published by Prentice-Hall, relates many reports of UFO surveillance over airbases in 1975-1976 and I know of many more hidden under the lid of secrecy. At McGuire, once the sensitive area had been roped off and ECP (Entry Control Point) was established, a generator unit was brought in for better lighting. At least a dozen men, said Morse, armed with M-16s were assigned to guard at the ropes and no one was allowed to enter except the base commander, the security police squadron commander, 1st Lt. WS of the security police squadron, and a base photographer. While on patrol, Morse watched the Blue Beret specialists spray the corpse from a portable tank and cover it with a white sheet. Before daybreak, the body was carefully placed onto a platform and a wooden frame built around it. This was finally placed into a large square silver metal container about 10 x 10 feet with undistinguishable blue markings. Before going off duty, Morse and others watched the silver box forklifted into a C-141 which arrived about 7 a.m. from Wright-Patterson AFB (identified by special markings) and later at a distance, he said he watched the plane and its secret cargo soar aloft into limbo, presumed destination was Dayton, Ohio. For Sgt. Morse and others of the Blue Beret regulars at McGuire AFB, it was far from over when the C-141 with corpse took off. Two days later he and three others he named were also on a C-141 on orders to report to Wright-Patterson, the base of many sancta. The setting at Wright-Patterson was like that of a court martial. There were a table and chairs in an unadorned room which Morse described as follows: 'While there, we were all together except for actual interrogations. Mine had two men, one apparently a civilian with pipe and beard who never spoke. At one point, there were three men. One played nice guy and one mean guy, plus the silent civilian. All they wanted to know was the nature of the incident, what I knew and then told me about my duty to keep my mouth shut. ...I signed a form and it is supposed to bind me for life.' Never once, as Morse recalls, did any of the interrogators offer information or an explanation of the incident. Nor did anyone ever refer to the retrieved dead body or suggest that it might have been of extraterrestrial origin. Said Morse: 'They beat around the bush. All references to it were indirect.' The day after the interrogation, Morse returned to McGuire AFB, was debriefed by his Commanding Officer, Lt. Col. FM, and released for normal duty. The incident, he said, was not discussed again by anyone as though it never happened. The names of the officers at Wright-Patterson, including a Brigadier General who Morse had confirmed by a source still in the military, have been known to me since our first telephone chat. Although I agreed not to publish these names in respect to security, I did insist they be authenticated by someone other than myself in order to give credence to the case. With permission, I gave the names to Richard Hall, who had access to such records at the Library of Congress. For the most part, his time and effort were not in vain. Although the U. S. Air Force Register for 1978 was 'off the shelf,' he said he was able to find in the 1979 edition a status entry for each officer - except one: a Colonel B who Morse had said played the 'bad guy.' Hall speculated that Colonel B might have been with the CIA, but according to Morse, all the officers including the questionable Colonel were in civilian clothes. Each was identified with a name plate showing his rank in parentheses. Whatever the Colonel's role, we are left to conclude that the silent, bearded man with a pipe who - according to Morse was without a name plate - might have been with the CIA or another covert agency. To stem any suspicion, I had Morse check a picture of Dr. J. Allen Hynek, well-known for pipe and beard. His comment: 'Some similarities, but my man was about 50 and his beard was flat, not a goatee. Don't think it was Hynek.' ( Note 6: On my suggestion, Morse obtained a copy of the Feb. 1985 issue of OMNI magazine which featured an article about Dr. Hynek with current pictures. Oddly, a letter sent to Morse on January 12, 1985, with various enclosures - including pictures of Dr. Hynek vintage 1978 for his comments - was never received.)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" For the record, the officers at McGuire were also checked out and confirmed, but unfortunately as Hall explained, the assignments for the time and place of the Wright- Patterson officers were not obtainable in the U. S. Air Force Register nor in any other immediately available record. Also, it was disappointing that there was no direct way to check on the enlisted men named in the Incident/Complaint Report without having the identification of a social security or military serial number. 4. Surveillance? Morse believes that his problem of living under the burden of surveillance began with his first letter to me from overseas. If we can assume for a moment that Morse's story is true, then we can also assume that such UFO-related military incidents are safeguarded by any means necessary to maintain optimum secrecy. Thus, Morse was a risk and had his mail monitored. Needless to say, at this point when his breach of security was discovered, his mail and perhaps mine in 1980 suffered interference which led to his having visitors with warnings. An example of bugging Morse psychologically and/or electronically occurred January 12, 1984, when I called him and got only 'yes' and 'no' to my questions. In his letter written the same day to explain his evasiveness, he said: Morse Letter January 12, 1984: 'Sorry for waiting so long on reply to your letter. ...There was a Government car on the street the day I got it. I don't think it's related, but I don't want to take any chances. ...I don't know if it (surveillance) is relaxed anymore or if it ever was. ...I must also mention that we had much trouble with our phone in the past two weeks and several different repairmen have corrected the same problems each time. That is why I hesitated to speak to you today on the phone.' Leonard Stringfield: It is no wonder that Morse might have had some second thoughts about reaching me until 1983. But, his affairs were not to get better. In early 1984, I had expressed my desire again to visit Morse, but this overture fell short when he announced in March that he planned a visit to the West Coast. While there, he said he hoped to see someone who might provide the back-up information I needed. Seven months passed, again in silence. Finally on October 4, 1984, he answered my letter of September 4, and said briefly that he had a new problem. This time it was related to his application for a position in law enforcement with a Government service. Commented Morse, in part: '...the Government is giving me a hard time. ...First, they would not let me have the job. I took them to Federal Appeals Court and they were ordered to hire me. They're appealing the decision. I guess we know why this is happening. ...' Later by phone in December 1984, I was to learn that Morse had received a call from an attorney in the Justice Department (name on file), who stated during their discussion on Morse's employment: 'Your acquaintance with Mr. Stringfield did not help!' Then, by a December 31, 1984 letter, Morse wrote: Morse Letter December 31, 1984: 'I was approached by a person wearing a black suit in my parking lot who mentioned things might go my way if I deny this incident (McGuire alien shooting). I just received notice by registered mail that the Department of Justice has decided to make me eligible for hire. I feel these two things are related.' 5. Analogy: The Ellsworth Case. In a James Bond movie, we all can recognize James Bond. But in UFO research we cannot always identify the real Bond from a bogus Bond. For certain, however, intrigue is highly visible in Bond of fiction and in some areas of UFO research, especially in the sensitive area of crash/retrievals. While Morse's disclosures might seem fictitious, there is one parallel case of violence that probably is just that - fictitious - and it deserves a hearing in this report. This one is known as the Ellsworth Case because the missile site where it allegedly occurred is under the command of Ellsworth AFB near Rapid City, South Dakota. The story begins with an unsigned note directed to the National Enquirer on January 29, 1978. It reads, in part, as follows: 'The incident stated in the attached report actually occurred. The U. S. Air Force appointed a special team to investigate the incident. I was one of those individuals. I am still on active duty and so I cannot state my name at this"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"time. ...the incident occurred on 16 November 1977 ... was classified Top Secret 2 December 1977. At that time, I obtained a copy of the original report. ...\" At the National Enquirer, reporter and Ufologist Robert Pratt and a team of fellow reporters first thought the letter was a hoax. However, when they made a number of calls to Ellsworth and Rapid City to find that the men named in the report existed, they decided to fly to the site for a firsthand investigation. The case quickly collapsed. By the time they finished their interviews with all concerned in the report - with the help of Ellsworth's Information Officer - and checked on each person's story, they were convinced that the incident was a hoax. Never published in the Enquirer, the story was scrapped until it was revived by some UFO enthusiasts circulating rumors that it was true and cleverly covered up. To put it to rest, when Pratt was editor of the MUFON UFO Journal, he published his 'Anatomy of a Hoax' in the January 1984 issue. The Ellsworth case, although its Incident/Complaint Report predates the Ft. Dix-McGuire encounter, differs appreciably in that its source was so slipshod in handling of easily checkable facts about the personnel. Says Pratt in his expose, 'We found more than 20 discrepancies or errors in the report - wrong names, numbers, occupations, physical layouts and so on. ...It would be easy to say the Air Force falsified numerous documents, muzzled everyone on the base, published a phony high school yearbook. But that is highly unlikely. We spent a total of 44 man-days investigating this at a cost of more than $15,000. We had no doubt that the incident in the so-called report never occurred.' Morse, who has survived all of his ordeals since his story was published in Status Report III , remains openly agreeable to the investigation of his case. Cooperatively, he did not question my challenge to have the officers names at Wright-Patterson or the personnel at McGuire checked out. He welcomed the chance to meet and be interviewed on all issued by one of my more critical colleagues, Richard Hall. For the record, Morse was made fully aware of the Ellsworth case with a xeroxed copy sent to him for appraisal. He replied that the terminology used was pretty accurate, noting: 'The form you see is probably a back office copy. It could have been rewritten.' In a later comment he said, 'Without firsthand information, the case doesn't mean much.' In short, what Morse was saying was, 'Where's the source?' 6. Jeffrey Morse: The Person. In the Ellsworth case, the informant who never surfaced was remiss with facts in his Incident/Complaint Report. In the Ft. Dix-McGuire case, however, its bedrock of strength is not wholly reliant on the report, which was obtained for him by another source in his squadron. It is Jeffrey Morse himself. It is the Morse who once wrote to me: 'The public should know the truth.' Through many letters and mostly by phone, I got to know Morse as amiable, bright and alert and inclined toward reticence, never resorting to glib, idle chatter. When questioned on critical or touch issues, he was trigger-quick to respond in convincing detail. But in the main, he always spoke guardedly, revealing little personal emotion over his dramatic experiences. Sometimes I felt that behind this stoic reserve and his admission that he did not have answers to many of my questions, he might have known more than he was saying. Above all, however, Morse never once contradicted himself with the information he chose to offer. From experience, I knew all along that my one-to-one contact with my key source who would remain anonymous to research was not sufficient. I also knew for good reasons that my time to get a second witness with an objective appraisal was running out. Foremost in mind was the 'deal' proposed to Morse by a stranger in a parking lot which, if affected, could possibly stall or even prevent any further contact. Also, having selected Case A-3 as my topic for the MUFON symposium in St. Louis, I had no time to spare. My deadline for final copy was March 1st. Phone calls brought quick results. Morse and Hall met January 13, 1985, at a mall near Washington, D. C. Hall - with finesse in the role of playing 'devil's advocate,' agreed that the character of Morse was of greater importance than rehashing the details of the incident. In this manner, Hall watched and listened. Following are comments from his letter dated January 13, 1985: Richard Hall Letter of January 13, 1985: 'I did not pursue any hard line of questioning, mainly wanting to gain his confidence and form some impression of his credibility. I broke the ice by showing him the typed list of name checks which we discussed for awhile and he spoke easily after that. ...Personally, A-3 was well-groomed, friendly, relaxed, calm, articulate. He spoke confidently and without hesitation in answer to questions and did not come across at all as someone who has concocted a tall tale and might contradict himself or get caught in some sort of trap if he weren't careful. He showed no mannerisms that would betray any obvious"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"psychoses or 'hang-up.' Other than a healthy dose of disdain for authorities for which he apparently had good reason, he did not have any obvious axe to grind. 'He explained his personal situation and repeated to me what he told you in case he suddenly denied the story. ...He professes not to be interested in UFOs and that he put the experience behind him without any lingering trauma. ...Overall, I detected nothing in his manner or story to cause skepticism. To the contrary, he seemed very credible to me. He also spoke easily about his family and relatives toward the end of our interview, and was not at all 'full' of the story and wanting only to talk about it - no obsession. Pending further investigation, I would tend to give him very high marks. I kept a mental picture of other possible explanations, but they did not fit his image, style or demeanor.' SUMMARY COMMENTS Leonard Stringfield: In bringing my report to a close, I recognize the need for more information about the shooting episode at Ft. Dix and the nature of the body retrieved from McGuire. But for the moment, the testimony of the one and only available witness must carry the so-called burden of proof. Hall's informative meeting and my many exchanges by letter and phone certainly establish a strong base for Morse's integrity. In closing, I must note that in character with his downplaying of events, Morse never once stated to me that the entity he saw, despite its alien anatomy, was of extraterrestrial origin or that it might have come from one of the UFOs he saw overhead on that fatal night of January 18, 1978. At this point, with so much at stake on the testimony of one witness, we must go beyond the anecdote and the support data and take a closer look at the witness himself. What kind of person is Jeffrey Morse? Born September 10, 1958, he was 20 years old at the time of the incident. After high school he attended various universities taking prep courses, finally majoring in computer science. A Catholic by faith, he attends church regularly and in keeping with his interest in law enforcement, he is a member of the Fraternal Order of Police. Among his hobbies and for recreation, he is into video taping, foreign languages, plays softball, touch football and is a coach in youth sporting activities. Morse is not a UFO buff. He is not aware of most UFO events or nationally known researchers and authors. To this end, I submitted fifteen names to him for his comment, but he could not identify any one of them. When I mentioned this detail to one of my more perceptive contemporaries, he remarked, 'You should expect this kind of pretended ignorance from a plant setting you up with false information.' A point indeed, but it's a weak point. I know of no good reason for an undercover agent to continue to play games long after his story was published in my 19892 Status Report. Certainly if it were contrived to expose my gullibility and thus, discredit my work, why have the conspirators not unleash their stooges to flaunt their spoils of triumph by now? Moreover, Morse knows that I have no intention to present his case in this paper as proof. Status Report IV is purely an analysis of events encompassing one case worthy of serious review. I believe the data I present here offer substantially more than other encounters or retrievals published in my series of status reports. Significantly inadequate by comparison is the Nellis AFB affair in 1968 in Case A-5 Status Report II (to be reprinted in upcoming Earthfiles), and the Lumberton (or Wilmington), Ohio, skirmish in Case B-13 of the same paper and updated on Page 44 of Status Report III. The only commonality it seems is that they all carry a burden of proof as do all cases in UFO lore! Since 1982, new sources have emerged and vanished on the horizon of my research, none worthy of a monograph. I think Jeffrey Morse's case is special and, if we like to ramble in our thoughts seeking answers, or feel inclined to speculate into the shadowy realms of intrigue, perhaps there is another side to secrecy - the side that occasionally leaks the truth for the simple reason that it is long overdue.\" USAF and U.S. Army Replies to Leonard Stringfield's FOIA Requests "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" B eginning soon - Status Report III - UFO Crash/Retrievals: Amassing the Evidence Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
