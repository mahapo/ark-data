S. population.\" - The New England Journal of Medicine , April 10, 2003 In April 2003, actual SARS coronaviruses under electron microscope © 2003 by Erasmus Medical Centre Department of Virology, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. May 2, 2003 Hong Kong, China - Today, health officials in China reported another 176 new cases of the severe acute respiratory syndrome known as SARS, plus 11 more deaths. That boosts the world total to more than 6,000 cases and 402 deaths. That means the global average death rate for SARS is now about 7%. But in Toronto, Canada, which reports 147 cases and 20 deaths, the mortality rate is nearly 14%. As new SARS cases continue to surge in the countryside around Beijing where thousands fled trying to escape the deadly virus in the nation's capitol, health authorities are afraid the death rate will climb higher in China as well. Current Estimated SARS Mortality Rates: - Patients over 60, the SARS death rate is 20%. - Patients in Canada, SARS death rate is 13.6% - Patients in Hong Kong, Beijing, and Singapore, SARS death rate rose from 4% to 10% . Global average SARS death rate is 7%. - Patients in the United States, so far death rate is 0%. Influenza Mortality Rate: - In general, worldwide influenza death rates are around 2%. New complications are cropping up in Hong Kong. Doctors there say they have "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"discovered traces of the SARS coronavirus in the feces and urine of patients thought to be free of SARS and discharged from hospitals. No one yet knows how long the SARS virus can remain contagious in human feces and urine. If people are being released from home quarantines and hospital beds while the virus can still infect other people, then controlling the SARS spread will be even more difficult. Another new development: This week, Hong Kong health authorities found 12 previous SARS patients they thought had recovered, but who had to be readmitted to hospitals sick again with SARS symptoms. What no one knows is whether these patients were not fully recovered when first released from hospitals? Or if their weakened immune systems left them vulnerable to other infections? Or if the SARS coronavirus is mutating inside human systems into new strains that can re-infect, just as people get the common cold over and over again because that coronavirus keeps mutating into new strains. I talked about these new developments with Dr. Mark Jackwood, Professor of Avian Medicine and one of the world's experts on avian infectious bronchitis coronaviruses, at the University of Georgia's College of Veterinary Medicine in Athens. I asked Dr. Jackwood if he thought the new SARS coronavirus would be any different from coronaviruses he has studied for fifteen years? And if the SARS virus does mutate, how can a vaccine be developed that will cure SARS? Interview: Mark Jackwood, Ph.D., Professor of Avian Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia: Coronaviruses Mutate Into Different Strains That Require Different Vaccines \"Coronaviruses change and we can have multiple types that don't cross protect. So, one way you can get the common cold over and over again is that you get one coronavirus that makes you sick. Then the next coronavirus is different, so you have no immunity to the new one and you get sick again. MUTATIONS IN CORONAVIRUSES ARE BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE UP OF RNA WHICH CANNOT CORRECT ITS OWN MISTAKES AS IT REPLICATES? Right. THIS SAME THING COULD BE GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN CHINA, RIGHT? Sure. The same thing has been going on for years and years. That's the way coronaviruses have behaved forever and ever. But the other way you can get re-infected is you can actually get disease from the exact same coronavirus. The way that works is that when you get infected the first time, you develop an immunity to that particular strain of the virus. Then you recover and over time, that local immunity that has built up in your upper respiratory tract will begin to fade. When it fades to the point where it is low enough, that same virus can come back in and re-infect you. What we've recognized is that the immunity to coronaviruses in the upper respiratory tract is fairly short lived. IF IT IS TRUE THAT SARS PATIENTS WHO THOUGHT THEY HAD RECOVERED ARE NOW ILL AGAIN WITH THE SAME KIND OF SYMPTOMS, WOULD THAT SURPRISE YOU? No, that would not surprise me a bit. Not a bit. WHAT WOULD THAT BODE FOR THE FUTURE?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"That makes it very, very difficult to make a vaccine for a virus like this. The vaccines that we have for animals and the ones I work with in chickens we have several different vaccines against different types of the virus. We need to mix and match these vaccines depending upon the area and which viruses happen to be circulating in that specific area for those animals. We can properly vaccinate them against the strains that happen to be there circulating at the time. SO YOU ARE CONSTANTLY HAVING TO COME UP WITH NEW VACCINES AS YOU DID BETWEEN DELAWARE 072 AND GEORGIA 98 AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT DEVELOPS. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO KEEP DEVELOPING VACCINES PER NEW CORONAVIRUS STRAINS? That's exactly right. That is why a good diagnostic test that can distinguish between different strains of the virus and also can detect new variations of the virus is absolutely critical to control this disease. IN ADDITION TO THE QUARANTINE OF PROBABLY MORE THAN 10,000 PEOPLE IN THE CITY, THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS MORE FLED OUT INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE. NOW, THEY ARE SEEING ERUPTIONS OF SARS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE WHERE THOSE PEOPLE FROM BEIJING WENT TO. RIGHT NOW IN THE BEIJING AREA, THIS REALLY IS OUT OF CONTROL, ISN'T IT? It appears to be from the news reports, that's right. What we know about the transmissibility of this virus it's highly infectious, but you need fairly close contact between people to actually spread the disease. IF YOU TAKE THE NUMBER OF DEATHS AND DIVIDE THEM BY THE NUMBER OF CASES FROM PLACE TO PLACE: TORONTO, CANADA, FOR EXAMPLE, HAS BEEN 13.7%. THAT'S ACROSS THE BOARD IN THE POPULATION THERE. IN PEOPLE 60 YEARS OR OLDER, THE MORTALITY RATE OF SARS HAS BEEN AVERAGING 20%. IN CHINA AND HONG KONG, IT HAS BEEN AVERAGING 9%. THAT IS ACCORDING TO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL. So Little Is Known About Human Coronaviruses The problem here is that nobody has really done a lot of research on the human coronaviruses because they are so difficult to grow. We've got two strains that have been characterized in terms of sequence data and that kind of thing and they don't seem to be any closer to the SARS virus than any of the animal coronaviruses. Most of the work that has been done with mutation rates and the ability of the virus to change over time have been done with animal viruses. In particular, the mouse hepatitis virus which Dr. Michael Lai (Univ. of So. Calif.) has done a lot of that work. With infectious bronchitis virus, of which most of the work has been done in my lab and there are some folks who have done some work in Compton, England. THERE IS NO ONE COMPARABLE ON THE HUMAN SIDE? Not that I'm aware of. The reason for that is that we don't have very many isolations of human coronaviruses. They are extremely difficult to grow and they are very transient to isolate the virus from an infected person it's very difficult to get one. I think that if you think back about the SARS outbreak when they were trying to isolate viruses from those cases initially, it was very difficult for them to figure out which virus it was and find it in those people. THAT IS ALWAYS THE CHALLENGE WITH CORONAVIRUSES? Always. WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO GROW?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"We just don't have a really good system in the laboratory to grow it initially from that primary isolation from the individual. The virus is adapted to grow in people. It's not adapted to grow in cell lines that we have propagating in the laboratory. And we can take those viruses and 'blind pass' them several times where we pass them in the laboratory system hoping they will adapt to that system so they will eventually grow to a point that we can detect them. Indeed, we were very lucky that SARS did that in lab cells. Very lucky that we were able to do that with the SARS virus because it allowed us to sequence it and study it further. HAS ANYONE COME TO YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THE ANIMAL CORONAVIRUS SIDE AND SAID, 'CAN YOU HELP US?' No. They haven't and it's interesting that you would ask that. I contacted a friend at CDC who was actually working in the SARS group early on about three or four days that they found it was a coronavirus that was causing this and offered my services. I said we have a diagnostic test for coronaviruses. We've been working with it for 15 years and if there is anything at all we can do. We have a lot of sequence data and the computer data base for all these viruses, mutation rates and evolutionary trends of coronaviruses and all that. I said, 'If we can do anything, let us know.' And I have not heard back from them at all, not a thing. WHY DO YOU THINK YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TAPPED? I don't know, to be perfectly honest with you. I don't know. Apparently they feel they don't need help at this point. I really don't know. Maybe their hands are so full, that they have so many things going on that they don't have time to turn around twice to ask who can help. BUT THERE AREN'T THAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO HAVE DONE AS MUCH WORK AS YOU HAVE ON CORONAVIRUSES. On at least this coronavirus that we work with, yes. That's right. The Challenge of Producing A SARS Vaccine IF WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO COME UP WITH A VACCINE FOR THE COMMON COLD CORONAVIRUSES AS OF 2003, WHY DO WE THINK THERE IS EVEN A CHANCE AT COMING UP WITH A VACCINE TO THIS SARS CORONAVIRUS? I think what you said is in fact true, but I don't know there are too many people who are actually working on trying to develop a vaccine for human coronaviruses up to this point because coronaviruses traditionally caused a very mild upper respiratory disease in people. For a vaccine company or pharmaceutical company to make a vaccine for that would be extremely expensive to do, to get it licensed through FDA. It might not be to their advantage to do that economically because it (common cold) is such a mild disease. Having said that, we have the SARS virus that is a much more virulent form of that obviously and is killing people. We certainly can make a vaccine against that virus. There's no doubt about that. However, if there are different mutated forms of that virus out there and that's indeed why these people are getting reinfected and sick again then we're going to have to make a vaccine against that mutated form and against the next one and so on. THAT IS THE HUGE PROBLEM. CORONAVIRUSES MUTATE. YOU YOURSELF HAVE FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE ON THE ANIMAL SIDE THAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP COMING UP WITH NEW VACCINES TO NEW STRAINS. SO WHY SHOULD IT BE ANY DIFFERENT ON THE HUMAN SIDE?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I don't expect it would be different on the human side. I think it will be exactly the same. THEN IS IT FAIR TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS BRAND NEW SARS CORONAVIRUS, NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE IT BEFORE IS NOT GOING TO BE GOING AWAY. IT'S PROBABLY HERE TO STAY ON THIS PLANET FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE DOING HARM IN EXPLOSIVE WAYS AND LEAVING THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY WITH CONSTANTLY HAVING TO COME UP WITH NEW VACCINES JUST AS THEY DO WITH THE CHALLENGES OF NEW FLUES? In a way, you're right, yes, but not totally. I don't know that I could agree that the virus is going to be here to stay for ever and ever and cause all sorts of problems. From what we know about coronaviruses, some of them do that. Some of them don't. Some of them are here for a little while and then they go away and we don't have a problem with that particular strain again. But the issue here is that over time there will be - if not this (particular SARS) virus - other coronaviruses that can mutate and cause the same kind of disease. So, just because this one may or may not hang around does not necessarily mean there isn't another one out there that could not do the same kind of mutation and cause a disease situation like SARS. WE NOW HAVE A CLEAR DEMONSTRATION THAT WE HAVE A CORONAVIRUS IN THE HUMAN POPULATION THAT CAN BE LETHAL AND BASED ON THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE, THESE CORONAVIRUSES ONCE THEY ARE IN A BODY SYSTEM THEY KEEP ADAPTING TO THAT SYSTEM JUST AS YOU HAVE SEEN CORONAVIRUSES ADAPT IN AVIAN INFECTIOUS BRONCHITIS TO THE PRESSURE OF A VACCINE AND CHANGE SO THAT THEY CAN INFECT BIRDS BEYOND THE VACCINE. Yes, that's exactly right. So we develop a vaccine against this SARS virus and we start vaccinating people for it and they will be protected against that virus, but the virus will continue to mutate and can possibly mutate to the point that it can break through the immunity due to the vaccine and still cause disease. IT'S ALMOST AS IF THE COMMON COLD CORONAVIRUS HAS SUDDENLY BECOME A LETHAL COLD VIRUS THAT CAN KILL LUNG CELLS, AND IT'S LOOSE ON THE WORLD. In a way that's right. Yeah. That's what's happening with this particular (SARS) one. Yeah. It's scary. March 17 to May 1, 2003 increase in SARS cases. Source: The New England Journal of Medicine. Could SARS Become A Pandemic? COULD THE OUT-OF-CONTROL SITUATION IN CHINA LEAD TO AN"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"EXPLOSION BEYOND THE BORDER INTO ASIA AND EVENTUALLY GO INTO THE PANDEMIC STATE THAT EVERY ONE HAS WORRIED ABOUT AND TRIED TO PREVENT? I think that's possible, but I've never traveled to China. I don't know the situation at the border, what kind of control that they have. It's a huge country and it's easy to believe that it could get out of hand quite easily with a virus that is this infectious. quite frankly, I think that's what everybody at W.H.O. and CDC are very scared about and China's ability to handle this. Apparently, from the news reports I've been reading, this is putting an extreme economic burden on that country. IT'S COLLAPSED. BEIJING STREETS ARE EMPTY AND TODAY, THE OTHER NEWS IS THAT THEY HAVE RUN OUT OF BEDS. THEY DON'T HAVE THE HOSPITAL SUPPORT SYSTEM. THIS IS THE PUBLIC HEALTH NIGHTMARE. It really is, isn't it?! The only thing I can tell you is how we try to combat and control this disease and the best way is to get a rapid diagnostic test, which I think we have worked out now. But that needs to be made available in the areas where the outbreaks are occurring. We need to monitor not just the sick people, but the healthy ones as well and find out where this virus is. Then quarantine and isolation system that we already have been attempting to put in place needs to be used religiously where that virus is detected. And that's not just in China. That's all over the world. INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES. Oh, yes, ma'am, including the United States. But the hinge in controlling this disease in my mind is the diagnostic test to have that be extremely rapid and do it on across the board test everyone you can get your hands on in an area where you suspect the virus is. W.H.O. HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT IN CHINA, BUT UNTIL LAST WEEK, THE GOVERNMENT WAS STILL HIDING SARS PATIENTS. Well, that's the political issues I think I'm talking about. And just the logistics of going into a country like that with that many people and that widespread of an area and now you are saying people out in the country are having outbreaks. Boy! Can you imagine the logistical nightmare that would be to do what we've just talked about. Incredible! YES, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IN CHINA IS REALIZING THAT THEY HAVE ON THEIR HANDS IS A LOGISTICAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH NIGHTMARE AND THEY ARE NOT IN CONTROL OF IT. ANY CHANCE THIS CORONAVIRUS COULD GO AWAY? That's a good question. I don't know that anybody could predict that. I wish I could. We have examples in animals where we've had coronaviruses that have popped up in highly populated regions where we have a lot of chickens. The virus pops up and causes a lot of disease and then it just goes away and we never see it again. We've also had other situations where we've had a virus pop up like that and it spread throughout the entire United States. So, why one does that, why one is here for just a little while and then disappears, and why another one persists and continues to cause problems, I don't have any clue. I wish I did know. But it can go either way.\" SARS Is Causing Permanent Lung Scarring Doctors are now reporting evidence of permanent lung scarring. It's called \"pulmonary fibrosis,\" and occurs when lung tissues die and are unable to transport oxygen.
