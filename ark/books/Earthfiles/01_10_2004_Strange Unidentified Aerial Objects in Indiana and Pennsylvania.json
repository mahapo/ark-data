Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Strange Unidentified Aerial Objects in Indiana and Pennsylvania © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe January 10, 2004 Huntington, Indiana - On Sunday, January 4, 2004, The Herald-Press in Huntington, Indiana, published a front page story with the headline, \"The Object of Their Vexation\" and secondary headline, \"The day after Christmas (December 26, 2003), three Huntington law officers saw something moving through the sky over the city in broad daylight (around 2:30-2:45 p.m.) - but they can't explain what it was.\" Front page story © 2004 by The Herald-Press, Huntington, Indiana, on Sunday, January 4, 2004. City Editor Cindy Klepper began her article: \"Chip Olinger (Huntington Police Officer) was warming up his car when he saw it. He radioed for an extra set of eyes; he got two. Greg Hedrick and Randy Hoover looked skyward; they saw it, too. All three are Huntington law officers, guys who have seen just about everything. But this time they didn't know what they were seeing.\" Since that article, the Huntington Police Department was flooded with calls and CNN did a report. I talked with the Assistant Chief of Police, Tom Hughes, and one of the police officers this week who told me, \"We have two people who work the phones in our dispatch and this dang near shut the police department down. I've got a stack of papers where other people say they saw something, too. What is credible and what is not, I don't know.\" Contrary to some of the explanations of hot air balloon, child's toy mylar UFO balloon or debris floating in the sky, one of the Huntington police officers told me, 'To me it was a once in a life time deal, what I saw. I don't expect to see "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"anything like that again.\" J amison, Pennsylvania I also received a drawing of an unusual aerial object seen only a week later on January 1, 2004, in the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, suburb of Jamison. Bert Janssen from The Netherlands was visiting for the holidays. On New Years Day around 4:30 p.m., we both were amazed at a dark object moving slowly in the air not more than a thousand feet above us as we drove on Route 263 near the Almshouse Road intersection. We watched the object move slowly for nearly a minute and Bert drew the sketch below which closely matches what I saw as well. Unidentified black aerial object seen at 4:30 p.m. ET on January 1, 2004, in Jamison, Pennsylvania. Drawing by Bert Janssen . Bert, who is an award-winning documentary filmmaker and photographer, signed and dated a report for Earthfiles.com which reads, \"Unidentified black object was seen at approximately 4:30 p.m. ET moving slowly in the sky at an estimated height of 1,000+ feet, on New Year's Day, January 1, 2004. Length of sighting time was 45 seconds to one minute. I first thought the object was a microlight (motorcycle-like body with wings used in England to photograph crop formations and landscapes.) When we pulled over to the side of the road to watch, the object either changed in form or turned to reveal the profile indicated in the drawing. I thought the larger circles above the lower circles of the object were 'bat-man-cape shaped,' but did not know how to draw the slightly wing-like curves. The object seemed to slowly rise in altitude until it disappeared in the late afternoon blue-grey sky.\" Roger Sugden in Indiana, who researches crop and ice formations with Jeffrey Wilson and others in the midwest, called to tell me about The Herald-Press report on January 5. He had seen it at UFO researcher Kenny Young's website. Roger visited the newspaper and Huntington Police Department soon after. Roger had hoped to get a copy of the drawing that Huntington Police Officer Chip Olinger had done for his department, but was not successful. I talked with Asst. Chief of Police, Tom Hughes, about Bert Janssen's drawing and wondered if Mr. Hughes would compare it to Officer Olinger's and an alleged photograph from an Antwerp, Ohio, couple who told Antwerp police they, too, had seen an"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"unusual black object in the sky before Christmas. I faxed Bert's drawing to Tom Hughes who shared it with his police officers. Early Thursday morning, January 8, 2004, I was able to talk with one of the Huntington eyewitness police officers to compare his description with Bert Janssen's. I learned then that the Ohio photograph showed only a landscape and no detail in the sky. However, when the Huntington police officer saw Bert Janssen's drawing, he told me the following: Interview: Huntington, Indiana Police Officer: \"Comparison to what I have here in front of me, a drawing by Bert Janssen? Yes, from what I'm reading, it's a lot like that, yeah. WHAT IS THIS THING THAT HALF A DOZEN PEOPLE OVER A TWO WEEK PERIOD HAVE SEEN IN THE SKY? I don't know, but at first I thought it was a paraglider that's what it looked to me in the distance the size of it. It was a long ways off, but a beautiful day. I thought, 'No matter how nice and bright and shiny and blue sky it is, this is a heck of a day to be doing that.' (Such cold temperature.) TO BE UP PARAGLIDING? Yes, those parachutes you can steer. Not a round parachute, but the long, curved they do stunts with them and things like that. BERT JANSSEN'S FIRST REACTION WAS THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT SOMEBODY IN WHAT IS CALLED A MICRO-LIGHT IN EUROPE AND ITS' SORT OF SIMILAR. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT ELSE HAPPENED AS THIS THING SEEMED TO ROLL OVER AND CHANGE? It was a graceful, ballet-type move. There was no quick movement or anything like that. It was just a nice roll. WHEN IT ROLLED OVER, WHAT DID YOU SEE? It would turn to a flat line, just a small line in the sky, until it completed its roll. After that, it just gradually turned into a circle. IN THE NEWSPAPER IT SAID: \"FIRST, IT LOOKED LIKE A PARACHUTE THAT YOU CAN STEER, BLACK AND CURVED, BUT THERE WAS NOBODY IN IT. IT STARTED ROLLING, A SLOW ROLL, AND TURNED UPSIDE DOWN. THEN IT LOOKED LIKE A GIANT SET OF BIRD WINGS. IT DID MORE ROLLS AND TURNED INTO AN OBLONG CIRCLE THAT WAS ORANGE.\" Yes. The bird wing part another of my first impressions were that it was one heck of a big bird because it had tips (on the wings), like two fingers, like a big set of eagle wings or something. And it rolled and basically turned into an oblong circle. It was basically rolling all the time. IN BETWEEN, IT WOULD GO INTO A LINE? That's all you could see, a straight line. AND THERE WERE NOT MORE THAN TWO WINGS? No, just one solid there wasn't any body to it just a great big set of wings. If you cut the rest of the bird off in the front part and back part and just had a set of wings. That's it. AND THEN, WHAT WAS THE TRANSITION OR CHANGE FROM THE WINGS TO THE OBLONG ORANGE? It just did that when it was in its roll. It went from thin line and started gaining a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"round shape and reflecting sunlight, a blazing orange. At one point, it looked like a mirror reflecting light. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE OBJECT ITSELF COULD HAVE EMITTED THE ORANGE LIGHT? Well, I don't know because it was such a beautiful day. The sun was just as bright as could be and the sky was just blue. There wasn't a piece of white in the sky. It was just perfect blue sky, just as clear as can be. And the sun was very bright. I don't think it was emitting its own light. I think it was reflecting it. THIS HAPPENED AT 2:30 P.M. EASTERN TIME, RIGHT? It was between 2:30 to 2:45 p.m. ET. YOU WATCHED THIS FOR HOW LONG? Not very long. The whole thing might have lasted half a minute to 45 seconds. It wasn't anything fast. It was a graceful movement across the sky. WHEN OR HOW DID THIS DISAPPEAR? Well, it reached the church steeple and was going across the roof line headed east and when it got to the church steeple, I lost sight of it. Other people that saw it said it headed straight north from the church steeple. Well, that would have put the church steeple between me and it. And I never saw it again. DID IT PAUSE OVER THE CHURCH STEEPLE? No. It wasn't above the church steeple. I thought it was going to get wrapped around the church steeple. I thought it was going to hit it. It's a pretty tall steeple, but it wasn't that far off the roof line. THEN THE PART THAT TURNED FROM THE ONE SET OF WINGS AND IT TURNED, DID IT IMMEDIATELY FLASH OR BECOME THE ORANGE SUNLIGHT OR WHATEVER? Yes. Whenever it turned oblong, that's when it reflected light. But after it turned oblong, it only did that during three or four rolls, and then it turned to just a black spot, not reflecting anything. DID IT START OFF AS A BLACK SPOT WHAT WAS IT? A black parachute-looking paraglider type thing. The wing part was black. It was not until it turned oblong did it show any kind of color. Then once it got to a certain size, it turned into a black circle. IT STARTED OUT LIKE A PARAGLIDER LIKE THAT PART THAT LIFTS IN THE AIR. THEN WHEN IT TURNED, THE PARASHOOT PART SEEMED TO CHANGE INTO A SET OF WINGS? Yeah. It was after it rolled a few times like that. As it got closer, then it looked like it had two fingers on the end of it (like a bird). And it wasn't quite as square (or rectangular)-looking. It had rounded edges like a bird's wing. YOU SAW THIS THING ROLL HOW MANY TIMES? I'd say three or four times when it looked like a paraglider; three or four times when it looked like a wing no, maybe it rolled only two different times when it looked like a wing; then when it turned oblong. Basically that's what it did, just kept turning, just a graceful. Didn't go up or down, nothing fast. It just rolled like it was a ballet. It was something I like watching science fiction stuff. One of my favorite movies is The Day The Earth Stood Still. That used to scare me when I was a little kid. But I'd never seen anything like that. Basically I hoped other people would see it so we could find out what it was. But we never expected anything like the pages and pages and pages of calls our dispatch received! People have even ridiculed"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"us for reporting it. THE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT UNUSUAL THINGS IN THE SKY THAT ARE NOT EXPLAINED, ESPECIALLY IN A TIME OF TERRORISM IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY REPORTERS, POLICE AND CITIZENS SHOULD BE PAYING ATTENTION TO - WHAT IS IN THE SKIES AND REPORTING THEM. NOBODY SHOULD BE RIDICULED. IT IS SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE SHOULD KNOW ABOUT. AND HERE WE'VE GOT THREE STATES: OHIO, INDIANA AND PENNSYLVANIA IN A TWO WEEK PERIOD IN WHICH APPARENTLY PEOPLE HAVE SEEN SOMETHING ODD IN THE SKY. SO WHAT IS IT? I agree with you wholeheartedly. Everybody should be aware of everything that is going on around them. But things get so out of hand. At times, I wish I had never seen it because what it caused is just I've got people who are mad at me. It just caused more than what we ever anticipated. I'M GLAD I GOT TO TALK WITH YOU IN MORE DETAIL AND YOU GOT TO SEE THE DRAWING. There might be something related because this thing was headed east. Ohio and Pennsylvania are both east of here. THAT'S RIGHT. Where it originated from? Who knows. And it was absolutely calm that day. It was absolutely calm. I mean, it was a beautiful, bright, sunny pure blue day as pure as a robin's egg. There wasn't enough wind to push it along, I thought. But, up higher maybe there is. The church sits on a big hill, the highest point in town. And where I was sitting was one of the lowest points (police station parking lot in his car), right down at river level. So, we're talking 300 to 400 feet off the ground, probably. SO, THE TOP OF THE CHURCH STEEPLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN 300 TO 400 FEET HIGH? Well, the roof of the church compared to where I was setting down in the valley because we're in the Wabash Valley we're basically sitting on the riverbed of the Wabash Valley and the church is on one of the upper sides. Yeah, it was probably that high off the ground. If it was straight above me, it would have been that high above the ground, but seeing how it was to the north, the church was above me also. YOU THOUGHT THIS OBJECT MIGHT EVEN COLLIDE WITH THE CHURCH STEEPLE? Yeah, I thought it was going to get hung up on it, or run into it. But it didn't. It went behind it and partially disappeared. I mean, as it went behind it but it didn't come out the other side. That's what I should say. It just didn't come out the other side. SO YOU SAW WHAT SEEMED TO BE AN OBLONG OBJECT LARGE ENOUGH TO BE A PARAGLIDER AND IT SEEMED TO BE HEADED TOWARD THE STEEPLE AND YOU THOUGHT IT WOULD COLLIDE, BUT IT NEVER CAME OUT THE OTHER SIDE. No, it went to the church steeple and went behind it, but never came out the other side. I talked to another guy who called later a few days afterward. He is a pilot. He chased it. He saw basically the same thing and he compared it to the size of the model of some aircraft. I think it was a Cessna in comparison of size. But he ran out of road and lost it. SOMETHING THE SIZE OF A CESSNA IS PRETTY BIG. I thought it was pretty big. A back yard kid's trampoline is pretty big."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"What was printed by the Herald Press that reporter, they contacted the local airports which are basically about 25 miles east of here like around Fort Wayne, Indiana they have several smaller airports and their large one has radar capabilities. None of them said they saw anything. We saw it. One of the guys (police officer) here. He still thinks it was just a big piece of Mylar or something. WHAT DO YOU THINK? I don't know. I don't know. I don't think it was something being driven by anybody. I don't think that at all. It didn't other than being round at the end, it was round, but it had no thickness. There was no thickness. Just thick enough to see it looked like a straight line (before it rolled and turned into round black circle). Just enough to be visible as being black. There was no thickness to it. BUT WHEN IT HAD LIKE A BIRD WITH THE FRONT AND BACK CHOPPED OFF AND BIG WINGS, I WOULD ASSUME IT HAD SOME DIMENSION TO IT. It was a curved dimension. It was always curved at that point. It was either curved with a hump or curved with a belly. It was just like rolling a horse shoe. WHEN YOU FIRST SAW IT, DO YOU THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME ALTITUDE OF 300 TO 400 FEET? It never gained or lost or anything. It just stayed the same height. It changed shape as it got closer, but it was large enough that it looked like a paraglider off in the distance and I just thought as nice a day as it is, whoever that guy is doing that, they are crazy because I wouldn't be out there. It was fairly cold, you know? Even though it was beautiful out. We do have hot air balloon enthusiasts around here and they go up in those things all the time, but they are all real colorful. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE YOU WOULD MISTAKE A HOT AIR BALLOON WITH WHAT YOU SAW AND ARE DESCRIBING. No, I know what a hot air balloon is. There is a local group here called 'Cloud Chasers' and they go up all the time. THIS WAS NOT A HOT AIR BALLOON? No, it made no noise. There was no noise. There wasn't anything except for reflection. But then that stopped and it was just a big, black circle up there. Do you know what a kid's back yard trampoline looks like? RIGHT. That's about the size it gained, and it could have been a bit bigger than that. But that's what I'm guessing the size was. SO IT ENDED UP LOOKING LIKE A PERFECTLY ROUND, BLACK CIRCLE? Right. With no color other than dark. It wasn't jet black. It was just a deep, deep grey. There was no physical features other than a round dot. There was no depth to it. You couldn't see through it or anything like that. But there was no evidence of any kinds of lines in it or anything. WAS THE DARK CIRCLE THE PART THAT ENDED UP LOOKING LIKE IT WAS GOING TO COLLIDE WITH THE CHURCH STEEPLE? Right. It was like it rolled and turned sideways and then it just I thought it was going to get hung up on the church, on the steeple. But it went behind it and that's the last I saw of it. At that point is when the other fellow (pilot) chased it. He was headed north on a street. He had seen it coming and turned and he chased it until he ran out of road. He is the one who said it was the size of a"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Cessna or some kind of airplane. He said, 'I'm a pilot.' It interested him enough to chase it with his car. DID HE DESCRIBE THE SAME TRANSFORMATIONS, ROLLING AND CHANGING INTO THE SHAPES THAT YOU SAW? Yes. But he kind of thought it was some kind of reflective stuff. But he read what was in the paper and called in and said, 'I saw it and chased it.' I talked to him and it's nothing I can back up about exactly what he saw. He compared it to the size of an airplane. BUT HE AS A PILOT COULD NOT RECOGNIZE THIS AERIAL OBJECT, RIGHT? He could not recognize? No, he didn't know what it was either. But it was he didn't go into detail about what it did while he was watching it because evidently, he saw it come to the church area and head north and the street he was on was a north street only just a couple of blocks from me. And it goes up to the higher part of town the same level as the church and he just ran out of road. IN THAT WHOLE TIME THOUGH, HE NEVER RECOGNIZED IN THE AIR WHAT HE WAS LOOKING AT - BUT HE COMPARED IT TO THE SIZE OF A CE SSNA? Yes. He can't and didn't give any explanation. He said size-wise, it looked the size of a Cessna. Or I should say, a Cessna or whatever. Being a pilot, they talk in a different lingo, 'small passenger plane.' HE AT LEAST DID SAY HE SAW IT ROLL AND CHANGE SHAPE LIKE YOU DID? He saw it reflect color. I can't recall whether he saw it rolling or what. I don't think it was going any faster, or he wouldn't have been able to follow it. RIGHT, IT WOULD HAVE TO BE SLOW FOR HIM TO KEEP GOING ALONG IN A CAR, WOULDN'T IT? And it was a 30 mph zone. It's just a local city street. You wouldn't dare get any speed up. TO BE FOLLOWING IT TOWARD THE CHURCH, HE WOULD HAVE TO BE RISING IN ALTITUDE TOWARD WHATEVER THE OBJECT WAS. Right. I think that's why he said it was losing altitude. And he was going to tell his local flying buddies to keep an eye out for something flying around, to keep a look out for a big hunk of something in someone's tree or field or whatever. Also, a lady called in and said they had one of these child's toy balloons that had gotten loose from them. I guess they fill them with helium and it got loose from them and that's what we saw. But they are only about three feet wide. THAT WOULD NOT BE THE SIZE OF A CESSNA PLANE. No. SO, RIGHT THERE, YOU'VE GOT A CONTRADICTORY REPORT FROM A PILOT. Yeah. One of the other people down here who saw it said to him it just looked like a big piece of tissue. So, we didn't know what it was, but it's unusual. TISSUE WOULD NOT END UP BEING A PERFECT DARK CIRCLE. I can't explain all that. To me it was a once in a life time deal, what I saw. I don't expect to see anything like that again.\""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
