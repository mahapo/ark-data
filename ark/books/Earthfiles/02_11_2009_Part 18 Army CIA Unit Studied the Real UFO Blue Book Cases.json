We’re going to get one of the unidentified corpses that the local police department has and we’re going to put your CIA I.D. on the unidentified corpse and then cremate the body. ” - A nthony Barden, “Stein's” CIA Boss R eturn to Part 1 R eturn to Part 17 February 11, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - My June 29, 1998, interview with Stein at his Florida home continues from Part 17, in which he discusses what happened when he and his boss, Anthony Barden, returned to the southeastern military base and their highly classified CIA Project Blue Book investigations during the period leading up to the presidential election of John F. Kennedy. In June 1959, Stein and Anthony Barden were very surprised to receive a file from Argentinean intelligence authorities with a photograph of a mutilated steer and a request for whatever information the American CIA had about the animal mutilation phenomenon. Some background about Argentina animal mutilations. If you include Stein's account, there have been Argentina government investigations of the unusual, bloodless, trackless animal deaths since at least the 1950s to the current day. For reasons unknown, between 2002 and 2005, more than three thousand cases of animal mutilations were reported to Argentina authorities. Those reports included necropsies by veterinarians in which the unusual excisions of tissue were described as cut with high heat by an unknown instrument.

That was unusual because that was the first government paperwork we had received from Argentina’s version of their FBI. For some reason, that Argentina unit sent a report to the CIA headquarters in Washington, D. C., about a cattle mutilation and asked for more information from us. DO YOU REMEMBER ANY OF THE DETAILS AND IF THERE WERE PHOTOGRAPHS? Headquarters sent the file to us, but the only photograph was not very good. You would think the Argentina investigators would have done good close-ups, but the steer was only photographed in a wide shot with the abdomen facing the camera. You could see that the cow's tongue and eyes were out. The stomach, or udder, was removed. There was no walk around the animal to see different angles. There were no good, close-up photographs of the excisions. WHAT RESPONSE DID YOUR CIA TEAM GIVE ARGENTINA? We sent a person to Argentina who spoke Spanish. He called ahead of time and talked with the Argentina authorities. Our guy told Argentina what kind of information we were looking for and he was told by the Argentina office that the report sent to the CIA was not the first animal mutilation Argentina had. There were others, but the authorities there wanted to know what information the American CIA had on the animal mutilations. We told them that as far as American animal mutilations, we would have to turn the inquiry over to the U.S. Air Force and FBI as far as gathering information. We told Argentina we would do that and we sent the USAF and FBI a copy of the Argentina file with the statement that our CIA office would get back to the Argentina authorities after we learned more about how many American animal mutilations had been reported. We sent the Argentina file to the USAF and to the CIA Project Blue Book in Washington, D. C. We said that Argentina wanted more information because Argentina had several animal mutilations over some period of time and wanted to find out more about the phenomenon. 1959 Aerial Photos of Submarines On Argentina's Parana River At that time in June 1959, I did see aerial shots of Argentina and there were several submarines right along the main north to south river from Paraguay into Argentina. And the submarine location was north up the river, still in Argentina. [ Editor’s Note: Paraguay River and Parana River join together in Parana River in Argentina. Wikipedia reports: “The Paraná River in south central South America runs through Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina over a course of some 1,600 miles (2,570 kilometers). This length increases to 2,484 miles if the distance is counted from the headwaters of the Paranaiba River in Brazil. The Parana River is considered second in size only to the Amazon River among South American rivers. The name Paraná comes from the Tupi language and means ‘as big as the sea.’” ]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"On the aerial photos, we could see submarine pens and there were big hangar-type buildings, a big complex. OUR AMERICAN SATELLITE PHOTO? I think it was a U-2 photo at that time in June 1959. T he Lockheed U-2R/TR-1 took its first high altitude flight on August 1, 1955. Image courtesy USAF. YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE SUBMARINES IN THE AERIAL PHOTOGRAPH? Yes, I think it was four or five submarines, submarine pens and empty pens also. There were good-sized hangar and complex buildings and smaller office buildings. WOULDN’T THE CIA HAVE HAD FIELD AGENTS ON THE GROUND IN ARGENTINA WORKING TO IDENTIFY THE COMPLEX? We always had field agents investigating, but whatever was behind that Argentina installation had to have severe security measures around it to pick up anyone trying to approach from land, water or air. The only photographs we ever received were from high up, such as the U-2, and from a boat on the river. We never landed there because it was heavily guarded by people in Argentina uniforms, but we assumed the installation was Nazi-controlled. Were Submarines On Argentina River Under Nazi Control? IN 1959, AS FAR AS THE AMERICAN CIA AND OTHER INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES WERE CONCERNED, THE GERMAN NAZI CONTINGENCY WAS STILL PRESENT AND VIABLE IN ARGENTINA WITH SUBMARINES? Yes, but the submarines did not have Nazi symbols on them – only serial numbers. However, we knew they were definitely identified as German-type submarines from the end of WWII. WAS THERE EVER ANY INTELLIGENCE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE STRATEGY SHOULD BE CONCERNING GERMAN NAZI TECHNOLOGY?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"When we tried to get more information about the Argentina submarine complex, we were always shot down. The CIA wanted to keep flying U-2s over there, but we always were told by CIA headquarters that we couldn’t get the OK to do anything in Argentina. We assumed it was part of the secret agreement that Anthony Barden and I found in the basement library at CIA headquarters in Washington, D. C. - that essentially Argentina was off limits. That’s why we only had a few U-2 aerials and a few river shots taken by people who were CIA, but we always heard that the CIA headquarters said to our Blue Book superiors, ‘Don’t send anyone into Argentina.’ That’s why we were so shocked when we received the cattle mutilation photograph and file from Argentina and a disc photograph taken in Argentina, similar to the disc over Puerto Rico that we showed Eisenhower and Nixon. Remember that Eisenhower knew about the Hitler/Nazi disc craft and we operated with the understanding that it was still Hitler’s Nazi saucers and game in Argentina, no matter where Hitler was, dead or alive. Also, there was a big German population that moved to Argentina in the 1920s and 1930s and to Chile and other areas in South America. After JFK Elected President IN THE TRANSITION FROM EISENHOWER TO KENNEDY, DID ANYTHING SPECIAL OCCUR IN YOUR CIA GROUP? After Kennedy got in, we still kept getting UFO-related material in the same manner, but we had no more direct contact with the White House after our joint meeting with Eisenhower and Nixon. WHY NOT? We were told to call Nixon on any important photographs or anything else outstanding and nothing more really was. In that last year of 1959 to 1960, Eisenhower was leaving the White House. Anthony Barden and our group didn’t have any specific contact in the Kennedy Administration, so we reported only to CIA headquarters. J ohn Fitzgerald “Jack” Kennedy, 35th President of the United States, January 20, 1961, to November 22, 1963, when assassinated in Dallas, Texas. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - Allen Welsh Dulles (born April 7, 1893, and died January 29, 1969) was the first civilian Director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 1953 to 1961 and was the longest serving CIA Director and became a member of the Kennedy Assassination Warren Commission. Between stints of government service, Dulles was a corporate lawyer and partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, LLP."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"A llen Welsh Dulles (April 7, 1893 – January 29, 1969), first civilian Director of the Central Intelligence Agency following Gen. Walter Bedell Smith, from February 26, 1953, to November 29, 1961, under Presi dents Dw i ght D. Eisenhow er and John F. Kennedy. During the 1930s, Allen Dulles gained much experience in Germany. An early foe of Adolf Hitler, Dulles was transferred from Britain to Berne Switzerland during WWII where he became the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) station chief, the precursor to the CIA. Dulles spied on Nazi Germany plans and activities. Dulles established wide contacts with German émigrés, resistance figures, and anti-Nazi intelligence officers who gave him reports on developments in Germany, including accurate warnings about plans for Hitler’s V-1 and V-2 missiles. After the war ended in 1945, Dulles served for six months as the OSS Berlin station chief. By 1947, Congress created the Central Intelligence Agency to go beyond the OSS. Dulles was closely involved with its development. His translator at this time was Henry Kissinger, who worked for Army Intelligence. It was Allen Dulles's CIA Operation Paperclip that brought Nazi physicists and missile engineers to New Mexico's White Sands Proving Ground to create V-1 and V-2 missile technology for the United States. ] CIA Arranged Stein's “Death” AFTER KENNEDY BECAME PRESIDENT, HOW DID YOU GET OUT OF THE CIA UNIT? Anthony asked me in May 1960 what my plans were, was I going to re-enlist in the Army? I told him that I was not, that I wanted out. By that time, we had so many rotten apples in the CIA barrel – so many double agents – that I did not want to be part of ‘shooting pigs in a poke,’ I told him. You never knew who was going to try to wipe you out next. So, I wanted out. Anthony said, ‘I can’t blame you for that. If I could get out, I would.’ I asked him, ‘Why can’t you get out?’ He told me, ‘I could resign. I’ve been in there (CIA) long enough to retire, but I don’t want to retire,’ he said until a certain date – I think he said 1964 or 1965. ‘I want to work that length of time and then get out.’ But, Anthony Barden never did get out of the CIA. He died of a heart attack. DID HE EXPLAIN WHY HE COULDN’T GET OUT IN 1960? He just said, ‘Once you’ve been in this (CIA) too long – like I’ve been in this for so long – if you get out and you have all this information, your chances are slim. Do you know what I’m talking about [ implying his life would be terminated under orders ]? I said, ‘Yes, I can see that. I haven’t been in very long at all, but I think if I stayed in my chances of surviving would be less than slim!’"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Anthony said, ‘I’ve always had a plan and never used it. But we have a plan we can use when you get out. We’re going to handle it in such a way that you are officially dead.’ I said, ‘How are you going to make me officially dead? Are you going to shoot me in the head?’ He said, ‘No. You have your CIA identification. In July, in order to let you survive getting out of the Army and CIA, we’re going to find a derelict who has died of dehydration in the streets. We’re going to get one of the unidentified corpses that the local police department has and we’re going to put your CIA I.D. on the unidentified corpse and then cremate the body. We’ll also create a will to establish your request for cremation and your request to have your ashes spread in the (city's nearby river).’ I said, ‘That sounds like a good idea.’ Anthony said, ‘We’ll do this a few days or a week after you’re out of our CIA unit – that’s when you’ll be ‘dead.’ I told him, ‘Well, I might be really dead anyway!’ And we laughed, but he told me, ‘No, I don’t think so. When I got out on July 29, 1960, Anthony Barden did exactly his plan to have me ‘die.’ In fact, the police department had picked up an unidentified corpse and the policeman called Anthony to let him know they had a corpse. Then Anthony called a certain person in the police department to arrange placing all my identification, except my photo badge, on the corpse. What they put on the body was my social security card and a few other identifiers. The police department's inside plant then made a report about finding my identification inside the lining of the dead man’s coat, along with the CIA-prepared, phony will that said I wanted to be cremated and my ashes thrown into the nearby river. That body was cremated, the ashes were thrown into the river and an official death certificate with my CIA phony name was prepared along with my phony CIA social security number. DID YOU RECEIVE A COPY OF YOUR ‘DEATH CERTIFICATE?’ No. I WONDERED IF ANTHONY BARDEN SENT IT TO YOU? One time later, I decided to check on my phony CIA name in terms of death certificates. That was much later on when I was trying to get into the V. A. hospital for surgery. I asked a clerk who was there if he could check a service number of a friend of mine in service – that I had lost contact with him. I wondered if the V. A. could find an address for me. The hospital clerk said, ‘I’m not supposed to do this, but I’ll try to pull a file on the computer.’ He punched up my old fake CIA social security number and name and said, ‘I’m sorry to tell you this, but he died August 3, 1960.’ I told the clerk I appreciated knowing that and I further checked another way and found out that my CIA cover name was ‘officially dead.’ [ Stein went into private business and moved up north in the United States. ] LATER IN CIVILIAN LIFE, WHEN YOU TRIED TO GET YOUR CIA RECORDS, WHAT HAPPENED? I tried to get my own records with my real name to see if they had a file or DD-214 on my phony CIA name. DID YOU CONTACT ST. LOUIS? Yes, I did, and was told my records were lost in the 1973 fire. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - “The National Personnel Records Center, St. Louis, Missouri (NPRC-MPR) is the repository of millions of military personnel, health, and medical records of discharged and deceased veterans of all services during the 20th century.

Information from the records is made available upon written request (with signature and date) to the extent allowed by law. On July 12, 1973, a disastrous fire at the National Personnel Records Center"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"(St. Louis, MO) destroyed approximately 16-18 million Official Military Personnel Files. No duplicate copies of the records that were destroyed in the fire were maintained, nor was a microfilm copy ever produced. There were no indexes created prior to the fire. In addition, millions of documents had been lent to the Department of Veterans Affairs before the fire occurred. Therefore, a complete listing of the records that were lost is not available. ] Intimidation of “Stein” After I Contacted Him in May 1998 COULD YOU EXPLAIN THE SEQUENCE OF INTIMIDATION YOU HAVE RECEIVED SINCE I CALLED YOU IN MAY 1998? Episode 1 I got a call from you, Linda Moulton Howe, in early May 1998, in regard to my phone number you had gotten from a relative. You asked me if you could interview me for radio. I said I would have to give it some thought, whether I wanted to be on the radio or not. A month later, you called me again on May 30, 1998. At the time, I told you I would give you permission to interview me for radio (on May 31 to June 1, 1998, Dreamland and Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell) as long as my real name and location were not given and that you could not talk about three areas I was warned about in an anonymous phone call. WHEN I CALLED YOU ON MAY 30, 1998, I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR YOU TELL ME, ‘I THINK YOUR PHONE IS TAPPED.’ Yeah, I was trying to figure out how to get in touch with you to tell you your phone is tapped without letting the tappers know! I SAID, ‘WHAT DO YOU MEAN?’ I told you that I received a phone call from a male individual who did not say who he was and did not identify from where he was calling and said to me that he heard I had talked to someone in Pennsylvania in regard to some previously classified materials. [ Linda Moulton Howe lived and worked in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1998.] The caller told me there were several things that he hoped I would not elaborate about that I mentioned to (Linda Moulton Howe) on the phone. Those specifics were: The name of the military base in the southeastern United States. 1. The hit squad that worked for the CIA and was stationed at that base. 2. The routing of spy planes from that base to Cuba and back through Texas. 3. The anonymous caller said that discussion of those three issues publicly could cause considerable problems for ... (CIA?). BECAUSE? Reporters might try to reach the military base to dig into files and this could be a major problem. YOU TOLD ME BACK IN MAY THAT THE CALLER SAID THOSE PEOPLE ‘MIGHT COME TO HARM.’ Yes, anyone who tried to enter classified areas could be harmed physically. DID YOU ASK THE CALLER, ‘WHO ARE YOU?’ Yes, and he didn’t answer me, but he asked me if I would repeat to him what information ‘they’ did not want on the air. Then I repeated the three issues and said, ‘I can’t really see the justification about most of this because it’s all so old.’ He said, ‘There are reasons for why these three particular issues are sensitive and I can’t tell you. We would appreciate it if you don’t talk about those three things.’ And then he hung up. Phone Company Executive Confirms Caller Was from Wackenhut"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"I had a friend who has worked years for the phone company who found out that the call to me had come from the East Coast of Florida, from the Coral Gables area. The call was made from the Wackenhut Corporation in Coral Gables. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “The Wackenhut Corporation is a private security and investigation firm based in the United States with other headquarters in Europe and other international locations. Wackenhut was founded in 1954, in Coral Gables, Florida, by George Wackenhut and three partners, all former FBI agents. Wackenhut is now headquartered in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. In 2002, the company was purchased for $570 million by Danish corporation Group 4 Falck, now known as Group 4 Securicor. G4S plc (formerly Group 4 Securicor) is the world's largest security services provider. Its services include manned security, operation of criminal justice systems, electronic security systems, and financial services including cash transfer. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. At the time of this purchase, the Wackenhut Corporation operated in 54 countries, had $2.8 billion in revenue, and its founder had control over more than 50% of its stock. The company has supplied complete police services at the Tampa Airport and pre-departure security at several other airports, plus security for courthouses in Texas and Florida; armed patrols for the Miami Downtown Development Authority; guards to ride the Miami Metro Rail and the Tri-Rail from West Palm Beach to Dade County and other assignments. In addition to security, the company also provides fire and rescue services for some clients, including the Kennedy Space Center.” ] Then, when you did do the radio interview broadcast of me on May 31 and June 1, 1998, you did comply and blanked out all the specific information I had previously given you about the three issues the Wackenhut caller warned me about. That way, you and I were letting them know that we were following their instructions, but getting the rest of the story out to the public. THE CALLER NEVER REQUESTED THAT YOU NOT DISCUSS THE ALIEN BEINGS AND CRAFT? Nothing along those lines, just the three issues. May I give you my guess about why I think those three issues were still so sensitive in 1998? My guess would be because of the U-2 flights that originated in the southeastern state, which was TOP SECRET. That was from the very classified area, the little airport within the military base. Further, my guess would be that Wackenhut Corp. has a man working out of that classified southeastern military base as far as the black trucks, helicopters and retrievals of alien craft that might come down. In other words, Wackenhut is working with a TOP SECRET government operation to retrieve alien technologies and entities. Also, a friend of mine who was flying over within ten miles of our secret U-2 base back in the late 1950s, he was just looking over in that direction at a plane taking off. Then he saw flashes of light coming up tremendously fast into the air right from that area, so he wondered if there might were a Star Wars-type ground-to-satellite experimentation with a goal to shoot down satellites from the southeastern base. By 1998, that would still be highly classified. The airfield there is not known to most people and is well-hidden without access roads. Stein's Effort to Get Paper Copy of Wackenhut Caller's Phone Number IN THAT SECOND PHONE CALL TO YOU ON MAY 30, 1998, I SAID TO YOU, ‘YOU NEED TO TRY TO GET THE WACKENHUT SOURCE OF THE PHONE CALL ON PAPER IN A PAPER TRAIL WITH THE PHONE COMPANY.’ WHAT HAPPENED? Right. My long-time friend at the phone company got into the computer to print out a paper trail for me of the anonymous caller's number he had confirmed as Wackenhut, Coral Gables. But because my friend was not supposed to be in that particular computer area, he sneaked in again to retrieve the phone number of the Wackenhut person who called me. To my friend's astonishment, the phone number no longer showed in the phone company computer list."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"He called me back to tell me and I asked him if there was any way he could find other records that would show where the phone number originated on the East Coast. My friend had called someone who worked in his boss’s office and the boss’s office person said she would see what the East Coast operator might find. They did check and found nothing on that end. She said, ‘When this phone number was erased – which is most likely what happened – it would have been done by someone working right in the top echelon offices of the phone company, which is Sprint down here.’ No one else from an outside computer could get in to erase a phone number specifically because there are security systems that are regularly changed for protection. SO THE WACKENHUT SELECTIVE CHANGE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN DONE BY A MANAGER IN THE SPRINT EXECUTIVE OFFICES IN FLORIDA? I would imagine it was handled out of Ft. Lauderdale, which is a larger town. NOT CORAL GABLES? Maybe not. And knowing that all this was being done by Wackenhut and probably the CIA, you can conclude that Wackenhut and the CIA have what you can call ‘paid infiltrators’ on payroll inside phone companies. So, when emergency issues like this come along, the infiltrator that monitors would call whatever its headquarters and in a few minutes, whatever the issue is, it is taken care of. In my case, it was the anonymous phone caller. I DIDN’T ASK YOU TO GET A PAPER COPY OF THE WACKENHUT PHONE NUMBER UNTIL MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1998. THAT MEANS SOMEONE WAS LISTENING TO OUR PHONE CALL ON MAY 30TH IN ORDER FOR THE NUMBER TO DISAPPEAR. Yes, in our phone conversation on May 30, I mentioned to you that my phone company friend confirmed it was a Wackenhut phone number from Coral Gables, Florida. Assuming your? Mine? Both of our phones were tapped and someone tapping called right down to company headquarters. It’s possible some ‘insider executive’ working for Wackenhut/CIA went in at night and erased the phone number. THE FACT THAT CAN HAPPEN, WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT THE UNITED STATES? Wackenhut is a company that has been covering up a lot of classified things for years. DID YOU KNOW ABOUT WACKENHUT CORP. BACK IN THE LATE 1950s? Yes, I did. If we had some individuals that were coming in to our southeastern military base – because sometimes we had civilians that would sometimes visit, not in our classified files, but to do general work. We could call Wackenhut for background checks on civilians coming to do work. Wackenhut is a worldwide security firm with offices in Europe.” C ontinued in Part 19 - Other intimidations.
