One file that Ryan received contained photographs of unidentified hardware and people related to UFO back-engineering. And one of those photographs was a map of White Sands Missile Range with the Trinity site region highlighted in black ink and labeled 'Area 29.' For more than a year, Ryan Wood has been investigating the mystery of what Area 29 does. In the process, he has learned that north of Oscura Peak inside the boundaries of Area 29 is a USAF research lab which develops advanced missile tracking, laser and particle beam weapons. Oscura Peak is also referenced in some of the Majestic-12 documents as a geographical reference for at least one \"interplanetary\" crash site. N orth Oscura Peak is an Air Force Research Laboratory designed to assemble and evaluate advanced sensor, tracking and atmospheric compensation systems. The published goal is to improve the A ir Forc e ’ s a bility to tra c k mis s ile s a nd the n e f fic ie ntly tr a ns mit la s e r e ne r gy thr ough the atmosphere to destroy those missiles. Atop the 8,000-foot-high North Oscura P eak, a 30-inch telescope is used to send and receive laser light to and from Salinas Peak, another site approximately 35 miles away. Six to eight people work at the site with four of them there full time. North Oscura Peak was a former Army missile-tracking site. Designed to withstand rocket strikes, the walls at the site are 4-feet thick, with 1,200 tons of concrete embedded six feet in bedrock. Image provided by Ryan Wood. Interview: R yan S. Wood, Corporate Energy Engineer and Author, MAJIC Eyes Only, Earth’s Encounters with Extraterrestrial Technology © 2005; conference organizer of four crash/retrieval symposia; President and conte nt organiz er for www.maje sticdocuments.com and www.majice ye sonly.com, Broomfie ld, Colorado: \"Area 29 first came to my attention as part of the trove of photographs that came from UFO document leaker, Tim Cooper, in one of his mailbox drops. The photographs subsequently came to my father, Bob Wood, Ph.D., and to me to look at and analyze. There were many pictures of hardware and people. One of the photos was a little tiny 3 x 5 photograph of a microfilm reader projecting an image of the White Sands Proving Ground’s road map. Then in dark black pen put on by the leaker of the documents after the fact, was a black outline in the upper left hand corner of White Sands Proving Grounds with the label 'Area 29.' That's where the Trinity site is as well. WHEN WE HEAR THE WORD AREA WITH A NUMBER, WHAT COMES TO MIND IS AREA 51, WHICH IS AT NELLIS AFB IN NEVADA. SO FAR, HAVE YOU FOUND ANY LINK ADMINISTRATIVELY, MILITARILY OR OTHER WAY BETWEEN AREA 29 AT WHITE SANDS AND AREA 51 AT NELLIS? Nothing that I could credibly talk about. There seems to be some overlap from the remote viewers I have used about what the purpose of Area 29 is. I might also say that the use of the word 'Area' with numbers is very common military terminology used throughout WWII and I’m sure in the Korean War and probably now in Iraq. The military draws grids across certain areas and labels them. It’s not that unusual to have a section of a base called “Area 29” or “Area 51” or whatever. But the real question is: what does Area 29 do? What is its purpose? What is its mission? And that’s the hint that the document leaker was providing when he wrote with a big marker 'Area 29.' On other photographs, someone wrote with black pen 'MJ-12' across four people standing in a portrait shot. So he w as clearly providing hints. That’s w hat I’m starting w ith. SO FAR FROM REMOTE VIEWING, WHAT IS AREA 29 AND WHAT DOES IT DO? From remote viewing, I’ve gotten a lot of stuff. It’s a very big area, so there are multiple targets, which can be identified by overhead satellite imagery. Some have been mundane, ranging from a hazardous waste dump to others that are much more exotic such as lasers and advanced communications. But in general, this Area 29 seems to be related to deep space propulsion vehicles, ground-to-space aircraft, Mach-10-plus vehicles, negative gravity vehicles, high energy output devices. Those I think would be lasers and particle beam weapons. President Reagan did a lot of work in developing those technologies and so did the Soviets. Satellite Image Shows Large Trucks Going Underground"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"AS FAR AS YOU KNOW, AREA 29 AT WHITE SANDS IS VIABLE AND RUNNING TODAY? Absolutely! If you ignore the remote view ing which is speculative, just by looking at some of the overhead satellite imagery that’s available, by luck I found a convoy of at least 27 semi-tractor trailers meandering down a road into the side of a mountain into an underground facility. P artial photograph of 27 large trucks moving toward underground installation at Area 29, White Sands Missile Range. 1996 GlobeXplorer image provided by Ryan Wood. THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT AREA 29 IS PROBABLY COMPLETELY UNDERGROUND? It would imply that a substantial portion of it is underground. You don’t have 27 large trucks going underground unless there is something important there. Either they are digging things out or trucking things in. But it’s an awful lot of material to be moving! OUTSIDE OF THE MAJIC/MAJESTIC-12 NOTATIONS AND 'AREA 29’ BEING WRITTEN ON THE MICROFILM IN THE CONTEXT OF LEAKED INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL PHENOMENON, IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT HAS LINKED THE WORK OF AREA 29 SPECIFICALLY TO THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL PRESENCE? Specifically? Not really. This is a work in progress. What’s clear in my mind is that you have a leak who says there is something important here at Area 29. It’s clear from satellite overhead material that this is an important underground facility. We know they are very adept at using high technology at this base. It’s a very large base. It’s much larger than Area 51 at Nellis AFB outside Las Vegas, Nevada. The remote viewing is highly suggestive of all sorts of exotic, cutting edge, state-of-the-art systems and technologies that would apply to space defense. Another thing that’s come along is a book entitled, Code Names: Deciphering U. S. Military Plans, Programs and Operations in the 9/11 World © 2005 by William M. Arkin. There is a Top Secret OMEGA reference, which is a USAF Special Access program. He does not link it directly to Area 29, but through other intelligence sources I’ve linked it to Area 29. Top Secret OMEGA is the military code word and main effort around these deep space propulsion vehicles and Mach-10-plus vehicles and high altitude loitering surveillance systems and reverse technology and development of E. T. recovered materials. That’s my current w orki ng hypothesis."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Click Here for amazon.com link. WHICH U. S. ARMY LT. COL. PHILIP J. CORSO WOULD SAY WAS DIRECTLY RELATED TO TECHNOLOGIES RETRIEVED FROM EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITY CRAFT (author of The Day After Roswell © 1997.) IF HE WAS CORRECT, THE BACK ENGINEERING WOULD BE SUPPORTING SOMETHING LIKE TOP SECRET OMEGA. Right. And didn’t he have an unusual encounter at White Sands? AT TRINITY SITE, WITH A BEING THAT HE SAID WAS NOT HUMAN, WAS EXTRATERRESTRIAL AND SAID: ‘A new world is coming if you can take it.’ I remember that pithy statement and thought it was priceless. If you were speculating and said you had UFO crash hardware in 1947 at the Trinity site, or very near it, and you really did not want to move it very far you might just keep it there. IT’S LOGICAL THAT THEY PUT IT ALL UNDERGROUND. Right, or at least covered it up and dug something they can deal with. They already had the crash retrieval material on a private military base. Why risk the security of moving it elsewhere? They might have decided it was right to set up a dedicated effort right there and start building a bigger, stronger and more sophisticated reverse engineering center.” More Information: R yan Wood's 5th UFO crash/retrieval conference will be in Las Vegas, Nevada, November 10 – 12 at the Tuscany Hotel and Suites.
