Here begins Part 20 of Status Report VI, from July 1991. These status reports were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report VII begins at Earthfiles 12/15/03 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Michael Hesemann: \"He came to Munich, behaved excited and frightened and made copies of the paper for the Baron and me. This document is said to be a memorandum to South Africa's President, F. W. de Klerk, written by General T. H. Oberholser from the Bureau of State Security, Pretoria (written Beurau) and was classified RED - POSSIBLE WAR EMERGENCY. This classification based on the claim that '99% of all information stored electronically and on silicon slides inside the alien sp ace craft translates to a total collapse of all world governments and eventual ellimination (sic!) of the human race as we know it to exist today.' The 'real' important thing in this document was something else - a 'requested' list of all officers involved, including 'J. H. Van Greunen, Captain, Counter Intelligence.' some of the other names sound quite suspect, like 'Major Fielding' (the late husband of lady-contactee Elisabeth Klarer), 'Capt. Spaulding' (head of GSW, AZ), 'd. B. Labuschagne' (a friend of James living in Sedona, AZ) and 'Capt. Forbes' (Ann Forbes is a UFO book-shopkeeper in S. A. and a good friend of JvG). Furthermore, more than 16 spelling mistakes on two pages made us even more suspicious, as well as the mentioning of Dr. Henry Azahedel as a 'possible security leak in Europe.' In the meantime, I found out that the entire document is a fabrication, that James used a seal from his passport and the head and stamp of his birth certificate to do a 'cut and paste' job. Mentioning the many spelling mistakes, James told us that in South Africa nobody could spell correctly, that even advertisements on TV would have spelling mistakes. COMMENTS ABOUT THE CASE FROM ENGLAND: A) Timothy Good ( Above Top Secret ) called the entire S. A. case 'bogus.' B) Manchester-based solicitor, Harry Harris, said that he got confirming documents from an independent intelligence source, but did not want to reveal it because 'UFOlogists always exploited him.' C) Tony Dodd and Dr. Henry Azahedel still believe in the authenticity of the case, but named JvG a 'con-man' who got ONE original document from a friend, Capt. Henry Greef, S. A. A. F. Intelligence. They claimed that they got confirmation by an independent intelligence source. Before I went to England, James has told me that Tony and Henry still have 4 original photographs of the aliens. They denied this. After returning, I wanted to know the truth, taking James at the point of his weakness. I offered to publish his story and the alleged documents in my magazine, offering him DM 20.000 for everything. We signed a contract, including the two "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"dates February 15, 1990, for delivery of the documents, and March 15, 1990, for delivery of the manuscript. I offered James an apartment in Gottingen, West Germany, to stay. He was first accepting and then resisting 'because of fear.' He traveled around between Lindau (his 'wife's' place) and Munich where he first stayed in the free apartment of my friend, Robert Yazar, then for short times in my apartment together with his 'wife.' At that time, he admitted that he was not 26 ('that's my cover'), but 24 and that Marion is not his wife, but his fiance, that he already was married to Mrs. Janice Fugea, now living in Newcastle, GB with two young children who are not his and is getting divorced. He planned to marry Marion Wiegand from Lindau. Sometimes they had problems with their relationship. On February 2, we again tried to get the Zurich papers and failed. James claimed that he got a warning call from a friend from intelligence. On February 11, my pressure on him was so strong that he ordered a friend to bring the papers over to Germany. After resisting again, we finally got everything on February 15. The disappointment was unimaginable - such as papers by Bill Cooper, John Lear, Paul Bennewitz, which I already had for nearly 4 months. He tried to convince me that these were government retypes, that everything was TOP SECRET> But I had enough. Then he claimed that he sent the 'hot stuff' back to South Africa when the police arrived in Marion's house in Lindau. He ordered his people in S. A. to send everything to me - but I never received it. He told his former wife, Janice, to send me 'four photographs of the aliens and an original document,' but they never arrived. When I mentioned that the above-mentioned 'General Oberholser'-paper was a fake, he said he wanted to test the Baron and me and we failed because the Baron gave a copy to Tony Dodd. I ordered him at least to write down his 'experience' for documentation. At the end of February 1990 (I do not remember the date), James called me, claiming that 'everything is over with Marion' and that he wants to go back to South Africa. A few days later, he allegedly called me from South Africa, claiming that he is 'back in his office' at Valhalla, Swaartkoop Air Force Base, gave me his number 'there.' When I called a little later, the Corporal who answered the phone told me that 'Captain Van Greunen just went home.' Later, Dr. Azahedel found out that James had PHONED the corporal, told him that every incoming phone call for him should be answered in that way. The Corporal, I think 'Smith' was his name, did not know 'Capt. Van Greunen' personally. On another phone call, James connected me with his 'fellow officers' who 'confirmed his identity.' Later I got a phone call from 'a friend of his,' informing me that James was court martialled and sentenced to death. Later, the same person informed me that he (JvG) was shot. A little later, James called me and told me that he was back in Germany and that the reason for his 'South African' game was to bring 'death' to the UFO community. At that time, he told me that he sent original photographs from South Africa to Bill Knell in New York. We tried to call Knell, asked Christa Tilton and Colman VonKeviczky to get the pictures. They turned out to be nothing more than hoaxes (Stringfield note: photo shows primitive mummified New Mexican Indian infant). Claiming to be a UFO-contactee since the age of 11, James showed me his book The Aenstrian Revelations, published by a small press in Sedona, Arizona. He told me that his publisher, Gene Falk, produced a documentary movie about him in Sedona and actually filmed the landing of an alien spacecraft in the desert. Gene Falk denied this. Concerning James Van Greunen, four possibilities to consider: 1. James is a con-man, the entire Kalahari affair only happened in his fantasy. he is out for money and nothing else. 2. James is what he claims to be. His personal records were changed by the S. A. government, everything was done to discredit him. He did not send the fake Fax-photos to Bill Knell, but some agent in his name with the above mentioned intention. The only document he faked is the General Oberholser-paper with the intention to test me. 3. James is what he claims to be - BUT, after returning to S. A., he was put under highest pressure by his government, got the mission to go back to Europe to discredit everything. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"4. James who obviously was interested in UFOs for along time (according to Ann Forbes and Elisabeth Klarer who knew him since he was 13 or 14), had friends, most possibly his school friend, Capt. Henry Greef, who worked for Intelligence and gave him the authentic Kalahari briefing paper. James made his own story out of it and because of the lack of real evidence, started to produce fakes. 5) COMMENTARY: CYNTHIA HIND Leonard Stringfield: Cynthia, a long-time respected researcher and a MUFON continental Coordinator for Africa, resides in Zimbabwe, a northern neighbor of Botswana and South Africa. She knows the territory, so to speak: the terrain, the people, their customs - and she also is well-informed about UFOs, whether they're witnessed in the Kalahari or any other desert. Her report of February 5, 1990, recounting her experiences in trying to get to the bottom of the South African affair follows: Cynthia Hind: 'Two newspaper cuttings about an alleged downing of a UFO by a South African jet on May 7, 1989, was sent to me in November of that year. The stories referred to a Dr. Henry Azadehdel, who had the story disclosed to him by a south African Intelligence officer, unnamed, who had stayed with him in his home in Aspley, England. On the basis of these reports, I decided to write to Len Stringfield of UFO retrieval fame (and a member of MUFON) as I felt if anyone knew of such a report, he surely would. On November 30, 1989, Walt Andrus (MUFON Director) wrote to me and asked me to cooperate on this matter with Noel Herbiet in Port Elizabeth, who was the MUFON representative for South Africa. At the same time, Walt told me that he had heard from Azadehdel on the telephone on numerous occasions and that the Intelligence Officer contact in South Africa was James Van Greunen (sic). Van Greunen felt his life was in danger. I was also told that Tony Dodd, a reputable British UFO researcher, had spoken at the Frankfort UFO conference where he had given a lecture about the alleged South African crash and had talked about a 5-page official document about the incident. I must admit that I immediately felt suspicious of the whole matter. If UFOs were so technologically superior, how come a South African fighter plane could shoot one down when far greater nations had failed? I also know that for some time South Africa has been testing various devices, secretly, because of her political isolation, supplied by either the Americans, West Germany or the Israelis. What better place than the Botswana, South African border with its desert-like conditions, to test their weapons? Far away from large cities and the only human inhabitants, unsophisticated people like the Koi (bushmen) who would put down 'fire from the skies' to the temporary anger of their gods? Recently, I have been investigating a report in Cape Town (Christmas 1981-1982) where two witnesses observed a rocket-like object pass over the city in broad daylight, clearly marked with the USA name and flag. If anyone else saw the object, there were no public reports. The missile, or whatever, was controlled, and I am beginning to be more and more convinced that this indeed is what it was. A solid projectile perhaps gone astray? Prior to receiving Walt Andrus's letter, I had a phone call from my daughter in Cape Town to say that a James Van Greunen had been on a television programme Good Morning, South Africa. She reported him as a very personable young man who seemed to have a sincere interest in UFOs and had formed a group in South Africa called NUFORIN. Shortly afterwards, I had a phone call from Van Greunen saying he was interested in contacting a friend of mine (an investigator from Cape town, South Africa and at the same time, extending an invitation to me to speak to his group on my way through Johannesburg. He had 'heard' I was on my way down. I agreed, although we did not arrange a date nor a venue and he said he would telephone again and confirm this. Shortly afterwards, I heard from another source in Johannesburg, that apparently my talk would be given on December 29. I was surprised that Van Greunen had not contacted me, but as the date suited me I was not unduly worried. Within a few days, Van Greunen phoned again, confirming the date and mentioning the name of a hotel in Johannesburg where the talk was to be given. I did not take particular notice"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"as he said he would contact me upon arrival in Johannesburg and confirm all the arrangements. He knew where I would be staying and the time of my arrival. At the same time, he said that he might have to come to Zimbabwe for two or three days and could I recommend somewhere for him to stay as he was having difficulty in finding accommodations. It was over the Christmas period and the hotels fully booked. I said if it was only for 2 or 3 days, he could stay with me, but he must let me know in advance when he was arriving as I had numerous arrangements. A day later, I received a letter from a well-known British UFOlogist in which he warned me about Van Greunen, saying he was an Intelligence Agent (of what country?) and I should steer clear of him. I immediately phoned my British friend and told him what had happened. However, I also said I had nothing to fear from any country's Intelligence and would let Van Greunen come and try to find out what he was up to. As it happens, Van Greunen did not turn up, nor did I hear from him again. On the night of December 23, 1989, my telephone rang at about 9:30. I was surprised to receive such a late call and assumed it was something urgent. When I picked up the receiver, I knew immediately it was a trunk call due to the sound in the background. A male voice asked for me and when I identified myself, he said immediately (words to this effect): 'I believe you are expecting James Van Greunen?' 'Yes.' 'Well, I am warning you: If he sets a foot over your threshold, you'll be in trouble.' Of course, I was flabbergasted. 'What are you talking about?' 'I believe Van Greunen is on his way to you from South Africa to stay with you. If he arrives and you let him into your house, you will be in serious trouble.' I should have put the phone down, but I was intrigued. 'What is the problem with him?' 'He's a crook, a liar and a disgrace to South Africa. He's rubbish and has been putting down his country.' 'What has he done?' I asked. 'I've told you and you will be the worse off if you let him into your home,' the voice said. I could not place the man's accent, although it was not south African. The voice went on in this threatening vein if I played host to Van Greunen, so I asked who he was. 'Nothing to do with you!' 'Well, don't you threaten me. I am not a South African. I'm a Zimbabwean. You cannot tell me what to do.' He said, 'I know you are a respected lady.' 'Yes, I am, and don't speak to me in that tone of voice.' And then came his piece de resistance: 'You have recently received a letter from Walt Andrus of Seguin, Texas, in which he asks you to investigate an incident on the Botswana border. Leave well alone or it will be the worse for you!' I was taken aback. How did he know about Walt's letter which had come directly to me from the USA, together with copies of three other letters? 'What incident on the Botswana border?' I asked. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"'I am not prepared to say.' 'Do you mean the alleged crashed UFO?' I asked. 'I cannot discuss that. But I'm warning you, if you interfere ...' Here the call was abruptly cut off. The receiver was not replaced: the line just went dead.'\" Continued in Part 21 - More from Cynthia Hind and Henry Azadehdel Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
