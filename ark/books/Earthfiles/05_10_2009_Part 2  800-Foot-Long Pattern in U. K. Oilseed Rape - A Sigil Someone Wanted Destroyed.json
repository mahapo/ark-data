Interview: Charles Mallett, Silent Circle Information Center, Calne, Wiltshire, England: “I don’t know who would have done this. All I can say really is about the physical tr aces we saw in the formation on the morning of May 4, 2009, and the plants seemed to have been systematically trampled throughout the entire formation, especially in the central avenues. The pattern is so big it seems like it would have taken like ten people over at least an hour to cause that much vicious damage. It looked like a formation after a week old that had been trampled by several busloads of visitors, but in a systematic way. YOU’RE SUGGESTING IT WAS A RAINY NIGHT AND THAT THE MECHANICAL DAMAGE CAME AFTER SOMETHING TRULY MYSTERIOUS PUT THE PATTERN DOWN? Yes, between 6 and 7 AM. I believe that Clatford formation was a genuine event and the damage noted inside of it around 11 AM on the first day of May 4, 2009, was added about 5 to 6 hours prior to my visit, which means the damage occurred around 6 to 7 AM, May 4.

Clatford Pattern Overlaps A Hill The formation was discovered from the air by a Dutch lady that I know, Annemieke Witteveen, around 10 AM on May 4, 2009. She called me immediately and said she had just seen a huge pictogram over near Manton, but she really could not describe where it was b ecause the landscape looks really different from up there in the sky. She described roughly where it was and I went out and found it after some difficult looking b ecause it's in a fairly obscure location where crop circles don't generally happen - on top of a hill! The huge formation is literally lapping over the top of a hill. It’s hard to see it from anywhere in the surrounding landscape, so I had to go blindly into the oilseed rape field and walk up and down the tramlines. Then I was shocked to find all of the plants were broken pretty viciously and there were obvious trampled paths up and down the long avenues in the formation. Bearing in mind that this formation is 800 feet long and about 300 feet wide, you can only appreciate that by standing inside the pattern. The oilseed rape plants are 5 feet high, so from standing inside the formation, you can only see bits of the pattern disappearing down the field. It was a huge thing, it really was! Pattern Is Angled to Tramlines and 800-Foot-Long Central Corridor Curves The whole 800-foot-long formation has a slight curve in it. That looks in some way to be related to the curvature of the hill on which the formation is laying on, as if it got dropped from the sky and just plopped down in a curve. If you were making that pattern with lasers and strings, your lines would be straight. There would not be a slight curve going down 800 feet of that field of oilseed rape."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"E ighth formation in Wiltshire, England, seen in field from airplane on rainy morning of May 4, 2009, after a night of rain at Clatford near Manton, Wiltshire, England. The thick, yellow, flowering oilseed rape is tangled and yet this huge sigil-like pattern was neatly placed 800 feet long and 300 feet wide rising up and down over a hill in the big field at an angle to the tramlines.

IT GOES UP AND DOWN OVER THE HILL SO EVEN THE ENTIRE PATTERN ON THE GROUND CAN’T BE SEE FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER. Right. Even with my 5-meter camera pole that I used to take the photos on the Silent Circle web site to get an overview, even then you can’t see line of sight down the whole formation. It’s disappearing down the hill. The lowest point relative to the highest point in the formation is many meters lower. How could anyone make this huge thing in the dark while it was raining with the subtle curve and skewed at an angle to the tramlines? So, when one is considering the possibilities of human hoaxing of that formati on, one has to concede that there is no line of sight down the entire axis of the formation. And the way the pattern is skewed across the tramlines in the field is very awkward. The physical construction, I would say, is practically impossible, given the fact that there was light rain all night to make it miserable.

Image © 2009 by Charles Mallett. I spoke to two people who live in the immediate area ar ound the field who both confirmed there was light rain there and pretty windy and generally a pretty horrible, cold, stormy night. That means anyone who might be trying to hoax in that field would not be able to communicate beyond 30 to 50 feet b ecause of the wi nd, rain and closeness to local residents. Yet, we’re looking at something 800 feet long! CHARLES, DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR A TEAM DURING A RAINY NIGHT IN A 5-FOOT-TALL FIELD OF OILSEED RAPE TO MAKE THIS PATTERN? I don’t know if anything is impossible. I just think it’s highly improbable! In my twelve some years of looking at this stuff, I don’t see how it could be done. If I were to physically create something like that in that field, I would almost certainly have to run it parallel with the tramline so you would have your central axis laid out. If you just take a look at the overhead photograph of the formation, it is skewed across the field. You could not reasonably, especially in pitch dark and rain, wander around in that field without causing ridiculous-looking damage from the air. Half your team would be 800 feet away and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"would have to walk hundreds of meters down the tramline and half way up the field and would have to communicate with the people at the other end on the other side of the hill! I can’t figure for the life of me how that could be done, especially not having a line of sight down the central axis! That is as impossible as I can imagine it to be! Candy Bar Wrapper and Pen Light Left On Top of Downed Plants Subsequent to observing all the damage on the ground in the formation, one person with us found a small pen torch (flashlight), a key ring torch, placed in the center of one of the circles. It was clearly placed and not just dropped because when you drop something in laid down plants, a small, narrow thing like a small pen light would just fall through the plants. I’ve lost lots of things in crop circles and they are always very hard to find. But this small torch was placed across the stems and right nearby was a sweet wrapper (candy bar), which my partner found dry (no rain on it). The small torch was dry as well. That suggests both dry items were placed atop those plants some time after the early morning rain. Someone wanted to create the impression that Clatford was a hoax, but I can’t say myself that it’s hoaxed. Professional Tracker Says Damage Occurred 5 to 6 Hours Before Charles Mallett Arrived Also, I had a professional tracker with me, someone who is well-qualified and certified in tracking animals and how they break plants. He looked at the physical damage on the oilseed rape plants and the recovery of the plants and told me the damage over that formation had occurred 5 to 6 hours earlier than our visit at 11 AM, which made damage occurring between 6 and 7 AM. So, one has to conclude that a team of people went into that field after sunup and systematically trashed the formation to make it look like a hoax. But really, the damage is not consistent with standard hoaxing, in my opinion. HAS ANYBODY REPORTED IN THE LAST WEEK SEEING PEOPLE WHO MIGHT FIT INTO THE CATEGORY OF BRITISH OR AMERICAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Not recently aro und Clatford, that I'm aware. But I’ve spoken with a couple of people who live in the immediate vicinity of the field and asked them if there was any strange helicopter activity around that night of May 3 to early morning of May 4, 2009. No one has seen or heard anything, but most people are asleep before sunrise. Are Defense Satellites Monitoring Fields for Crop Formations? I think one way or the other, the formation was seen by Someone before it was seen by my Dutch friend who phoned me. Something overhead saw it first and I think that could be a geostationary satellite with the capability to pick up an electromagnetic field or heat burst or thermal imaging or who knows what? Something as big as that pictogram would give off a pretty huge signature, that a serious event had happened and could be one that would get a lot of media attention. So, if it is trashed, it will be reported as a hoax and that will influence everyone else who gets into the site to spread the word that it's a damaged hoax, even if that's calculated misinformation. Because you can’t see the thing in the landscape, I’m pretty sure we were among the first people in there. It had not been publicized and my friend phoned me right after seeing it from the air around 10 AM. Long History of Military Helicopters Over Crop Formations IT IS NOT THE SIGNATURE OF A TEAM SATAN OR ANY OF THE HOAXERS TO LEAVE A FORMATION COMPLETELY TRASHED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. IF THEY HAD BEEN HOAXING THIS, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SUBTLE, RIGHT? I would imagine so. It comes across as damage that was very intentional, systematic, more or less all over the formation to create an impression of hoax. I’ve been to many formations very early in the morning where all of a sudden, these military-type helicopters that you and I and others have seen over the years just suddenly show up. The helicopters fly right up to the new crop formation like on a mission and fly around them and look at them and then fly back the way they came. Clearly the pilot is being vectored into a location from a monitoring source. I’ve also found pen torches obviously pl aced on plants in formations before. I practically saw somebody once putting a pen torch in the middle of a circle in daylight. Back in 2002, I was with a Norwegian researcher and we went to a brand new formation very early in the morning and we found a pen torch. As we arrived, we actually saw somebody exiting the field in a very suspicious manner. We looked all around that formation and by the time we left, we decided it was a really genuine formation. Even more curious, by lunch time a visitor to the formation found another pen torch in the middle of the same formation that was added after we had been there! Other strange stuff Someone has used to salt crop formations with false hoax-artifacts are voodoo dolls and crucifixes, I guess to create a weird effect and doubt. Clatford Is Unprecedented Size in History of Spring Oilseed Rape Crop Formations Just in sheer physical terms, Clatford is unpr ecedented size in history of spring oilseed rape crop formations. This is by far the largest formation in oilseed rape. For that to happen at the first of May is really unusual and in the context of the other oilseed rape formations this 2009 season, it’s all been pretty impressive, especially Morgan’s Hill at 300 feet wide and Avebury at 290 feet wide. These have been really amazing designs that have no physical explanation for their presence whatsoever. And Clatford is a major anomaly and huge. IN 5-FOOT-TALL RAPE! Yes, pretty high, up to my shoulders, and really dense. It was a real tangle to get through. At first, I went up the wrong tramline and had to wade through it to get to the right tramline. It was very difficult to move in because the tops are all tangling together. The flowering oilseed rape flowers are coming to their peak and the plants are top heavy and starting to meld together and very difficult to walk through. Even the tramlines have plants falling into themselves, so I was really covered in yellow pollen to a serious degree when I left the field."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" “Sinister Situation”? “T he basic understanding I have from pretty reliable sources is that elements of the British government, or shadow government or special agencies in the M.O.D., are well aware that the crop circles are real, that the government is monitoring them and making sure that the stories that go out into the media are as silly as possible. ” It’s kind of a sinister situation in a way. I’ve had experiences where I’ve been asleep in a crop circle and been awakened at 6 AM by military helicopters that have been right on top of me only 50 or 60 feet above me. They were probably just as surprised as I was to see them. But they are clearly paying attention to crop formations. My information is from conversations I’ve had with people who have worked for the military and Ministry of Defence (M.O.D.) in various capacities. The basic understanding I have from pretty reliable sources is that elements of the British government, or shadow government or special agencies in the M.O.D., are well aware that the crop circles are real, that the government is monitoring them and making sure that the stories that go out into the media are as silly as possible. There are many elements about this Clatford pattern that do not make sense. I mean, why wouldn’t the ones who caused the damage – why not completely wreck the whole thing – send a tractor to wreck the entire field, rather than go in the field and break all the plants so it still looks perfect from the air? It’s like Somebody wants the public and media to believe that the Clatford crop circle was made by people, but I don't think so.” Glowing Orbs Photographed in Clatford Sigil-like Pattern A nd angry farmer - how much damage did he do? Beyond Charles Mallett's investigation in the first morning that the Clatford pattern was reported, a Cheltenham, England resident named Andrew Pyrka visited in the late day to twilight hours and was surprised to see faintly glowing orbs in a couple of his images. Here is Mr. Pyrka's report and orb images. Updated 05/11/09: Andrew Pyrka Field report about crop formation at Clatford near Manton, Wiltshire, May 4, 2009: “The biggest formation of the year by far. This giant of a formation is approx. quarter of a mile long. Standing at the edge of the field - Manton or Clatford side - you can not see it from either end of the field. Approx 50 meters into the field from Clatford side, the formation becomes visible. As always the perfection is clearly visible throughout the entire formation with swirls and twists everywhere you look. The characteristics what we are familiar with are present in every nook and cranny of the formation A clear construction line is also visible with plants showing a parting left to right as if something came through the centre forcing the plant to collapse in opposite directions. When standing at any point within - you can only see the nearest design - the rest is not visible at all."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"P athway in Clatford formation shows 5-foot-tall oilseed rape plants parted in the middle and laid down in opposite directions. Image © 2009 by Andrew Pyrka. There was also quite a bit of damage in certain places - but if you l ook at the photo of the larger circle you can clearly see that the farmer had driven through it. The photos also show the formation slightly twisted, this is due to undulating land. D ark green tractor tracks twisting through circle. Those markings were left by regular farm tractor activity.

As we arrived late we had little time to take day light pictures, hence some of the images are very dark, but I hope you can st ill clearly see the impression in the plant. As night time was creeping in fast, there was an eerie feeling of being watched. As I raised the camera pole to take the last few shots, four ORBs appeared out of nowhere and appeared to hover just above the plants. Andrew Pyrka emailed me on May 11, 2009: “There were 4 orbs - the main orb was clearly visible and was the size of a large beachball (far right in image below). The other 3 orbs were coming into view and becoming visible or as if coming in from another dimension, the size of a football. Quite a spooky experience.”"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Four faintly glowing orbs (inside Photoshop highlight circles) that appeared to hover above the oilseed rape after sundown on May 4, 2009, Clatford near Manton, Wiltshire, England. Arrow points at Andrew's colleague for size and distance comparison. Camera pole image © 2009 by Andrew Pyrka. Another ORB reappeared once again approx. 15 minutes later along the tramline. Quite extraordinary to think what these things might be doing. -Are they looking for our reaction? Listening, watching and cataloguing the event? We can only guess!! F ifteen minutes after the orb first appeared, a glowing orb showed up once more at a distance in the tramline beyond foreground circle (inside white oval) after sundown on May 4, 2009, Clatford near Manton, Wiltshire, England. Camera pole image © 2009 by Andrew Pyrka. Sadly the re-appearing ORBS were not the only thing watching us! As we made our way back to my car - a very angry farmer who arrived with screeching tires, nearly hitting the back of my car, stepped out of his truck with raised fists and full of abuse and started to thump my car with his fists. We stuck to all the guide lines of conduct and offered our apology in a courteous manner and left. So in this instance: THE FARMER DOES NOT WANT ANYONE TO ENTER HIS LAND.” R eturn to Part 1 C ontinued in Part 3 - Astronomical Information?
