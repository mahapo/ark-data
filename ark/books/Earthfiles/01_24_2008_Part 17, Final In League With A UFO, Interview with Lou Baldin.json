I was awake and they seemed to be in a big rush. There were two of them and they took me away.” - Author Lou Baldin I n League With A UFO © 1997 by Lou Baldin. Out of print. Return to Part 1 January 24, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Interview with author Lou Baldin continued in this final segment after the Earthfiles.com reprint of his 1997 book, In League With A UFO. hat is it we are trying to discover about ourselves? There are many levels of existence and there is the moving up and the moving down. We gain or lose energy on simple every day actions – integrity being very important. It’s like you’ve got to get through the 1st, 2nd and 3rd grades to get to the 4th grade. It’s not a shoot straight up. It’s not a word, it’s not a mantra that anyone can have and that’s the absolute. You have to get to Point A or B and "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"then you can move on to C. There is a process. YOU COULD SAY THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE TRUTH IN THE UNIVERSE: RESPECT ALL LIFE. DO NOT KILL. THAT MIGHT BE ONE UNIVERSAL TRUTH. Universal truth is not available necessarily at this stage because there are a lot of universal truths down here. Like, ‘I was born in India and I have this concept of life and this is how I was raised. Therefore, this is my universal truth.’ ON THIS PLANET, RIGHT OR WRONG ACTIONS ARE DEPENDENT UPON CULTURE. SO, WHAT DID THE ENERGY FIELDS COMMUNICATE TO YOU BEFORE YOUR BIRTH THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO COMMUNICATE IN YOUR HUMAN LIFE THIS TIME? I think the really important thing is to know that there is a lot of stuff going on in our galaxy, that there is a lot of life. We have this planet Earth and we just assume that life started from pond scum and then we came from the ape. So, a lot of people assume if there is a water on a planet, then certainly there is the possibility of life on other planets ar ound the galaxy - that the odds would favor other life because of all the billions of different star systems. The reality is that nothing happened by accident. Everything was created. Everything was put here. Earth is just one cherry on a cherry tree with hundreds of cherries all over the galaxy. That’s the message. Things don’t just happen. The cherry tree was planted and the cherry tree produced lots of cherries. The cherries are pretty much the same. Earth is not unique and neither are humans. YOU SAID THAT AT AGE 12, AND BEFORE AND AFTER YOUR ARMY ENLISTMENT, THAT SOMETHING NEGATIVE ENTERED YOUR LIFE? Some people would like to call it demons. But, there is a form of political squabbling at certain levels. Just like you go to a school board, you have people there trying to decide what is the best curriculum and how to deliver that curriculum. WHAT IS THE POLITICAL SQUABBLE ABOUT? The school board is probably a good analogy. How to best create the best conditions to expand the mind and spirit. Do you do it with brutality, wars and poverty? Or do you do it with a little bit of utopia? WHICH TYPE IS ARGUING ON WHAT SIDE? The energy beings I’m in contact with don’t think we need third world conditions around the whole world. They seem to be more pro-technology advances. WHO IS ARGUING WITH THEM? That school board part of people who think that the more pain the more gain. PAIN VERSUS TECHNOLOGICAL EASE – A POLITICAL ARGUMENT ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH LIFE, HOW TO GUIDE IT, TOWARD WHAT END?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"There is no end. As soon as you reach one peak, there is always a taller peak to climb. IN THIS SCHEMATIC THAT YOU HAVE DESCRIBED, WHICH POLITICAL SIDE WOULD HAVE PLACED E = MC2 IN EINSTEIN’S MIND THAT LED TO THE ATOMIC BOMB? My side. IT IS TECHNOLOGICAL. Right, brought here and placed in our hands. BUT I CAN’T THINK OF A MORE DESTRUCTIVE PAINFUL OUTCOME TO LIFE THAN ATOMIC BOMBS. Absolutely. THEREFORE, IT’S SCHIZOPHRENIC. Exactly. Life is schizophrenic. We cannot comprehend. We are asking a toddler to understand what an algebra major is doing in college. It just cannot be done. THEN WHY WOULD YOUR ENERGY BEINGS HAVE PRESENTED EINSTEIN WITH THIS INSPIRED KNOWLEDGE THAT ENERGY EQUALS MASS TIMES THE SP EED OF LIGHT SQUARED? THEY MUST HAVE KNOWN THE OUTCOME WOULD BE SOME HORRIBLE WEAPON IN HUMAN HANDS. There are two sides to every coin. That knowledge was very useful to advance the human race. There are developmental stages for all planets like Earth. It’s not a simple thing to explain why we have to have pain other than there is a war going on and it’s not necessarily a human war. You’ve got the school board, but you also have the thugs that are part of the mix. WHO ARE THE THUGS? The thugs are some of the entities that have been evicted off of this planet, but not all of them. They are a fluke of this whole process of spiritual development. Part of the free will thing, which gives each soul the ability to become more negative or more positive, more evil or more good. Without those thugs, it does not work. It’s like fire. Fire can burn stuff up, but it also cooks and heats. WHAT DO THE THUGS WANT? The thugs are kept alive by people who want to be thugs in the free will zone. WHAT WAS THE NEGATIVE INTERFERENCE IN YOUR YOUNG LIFE? I don’t know. I was being drawn to the dark side. IN WHAT WAY? The neighborhood I grew up in was a very tough neighborhood. IN KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI? Ye s . A lot of my friends ended up in jail. A lot of them have died doing certain things. So, I was being drawn into that lifestyle."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"OF CRIMINALITY? Right. SO WHAT HAPPENED? YOU WENT INTO THE ARMY TO ESCAPE IT? No, because when I came out of the Army, I was more vulnerable. HOW DID YOU GET INTO THE ARMY? I just joined. DID YOU JOIN BECAUSE YOU WERE TRYING TO ESCAPE SOMETHING? OR YOU REALLY WANTED TO BE IN THE ARMY? I did live in poverty and I did want to escape that. I also wanted to get away from some of the elements I was with. But I was intrigued by the military. BECAUSE? I just was for some reason. Maybe some of that evil pulled me in there. COULD IT BE SOMETHING THAT THE ENERGY FIELDS WANTED TO UNDERSTAND? No. I was being tested. DID THE ENERGY FIELDS SHOW UP IN ANY COUNTERBALANCING WAY FROM AGE 12 UNTIL YOU GOT OUT OF THE ARMY? I’ve always had them around me – both sides. WERE YOU CONSCIOUS OF THE ENERGY FIELDS WHEN YOU FELT LIKE YOU WERE FALLING INTO A LIFE OF CRIMINALITY AND GOING TO THE MILITARY AND BEING TRAINED HOW TO SHOOT PEOPLE? DID THAT ENERGY FIELD EXISTENCE EVER PENETRATE DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME? Often. HOW? For some reason, it seems like I was put into situations where I was able to help certain people. Like in the military, I saved my commanding officer from an attack. And there were several other situations in which it seemed my presence there negated a much worse outcome. I don’t know. Maybe they were using me. WHEN YOU GOT OUTOF THE ARMY, WHY DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU WERE MORE VULNERABLE TO CRIMINALITY? Because I went back to my old neighborhood and got back into the old routine. But similar situations occurred in which the end results were better. LIKE IN THE ARMY – THAT YOU WERE SAVING PEOPLE OR INTERVENING? Right."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WHAT WAS THE TRANSITION FROM CRIMINALITY TO A NON-CRIMINAL LIFE? It seemed like a finally entered a period that I was aware I was going to get married and have children. So, I went through a period where I completely changed myself from drinking, smoking, partying to preparing myself for my children. This was even before I had children. I never even thought about having children, but I came to a point where I knew things were going to change. I was rudely interrupted. BY? By certain entities. BY WHICH TYPE? They were not very nice, so I’m not sure which side they were on. But after that, I did a major turnaround. WHAT DID THE ENTITIES LOOK LIKE? I never really saw what they looked like. But they took me and were on me like a pack of wild wolves. YOU MEAN IN YOUR BED, YOU WERE ATTACKED? No, they took me into a ship. WHAT DO YOU MEAN, ‘ATTACKED’? It’s the best I can describe it. Very in my face, almost ripping at me. OVER WHAT? Over my way of life. It was an ultimatum like we try to quit smoking or go on diets, which never work. But it was a done deal that night. There was no ‘I’ll try to do better.’ It was a very traumatic encounter, cold turkey. One day I was this person. The next day, I was almost a completely different person. SO THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN EMISSARIES FROM THE ENERGY FIELDS? I’m sure they were. BECAUSE YOUR ENERGY FIELD WAS GETTING OFF TRACK FROM WHAT IT WAS SUP P OSED TO DO? That’s what I’m thinking. TODAY AS WE SPEAK ON DECEMBER 23, 2007, THE WHOLE PLANET IS WORRIED ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN 2008 TO 2012. GLOBAL WARMING IS SETTING IN WITH BOTH DISASTER IN SOME PLACES AND PERHAPS NON-DISASTER IN OTHERS. PEOPLE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT ASTRONOMICAL EVENTS THAT COULD COME AND WIPE OUT LIFE ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH. DO YOU FEEL THAT IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS OR SO THAT SOMETHING OF AN ASTRONOMICAL NATURE IS GOING TO IMPACT THE EARTH?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"No. A lot of things that are going to happen, but nothing astronomical. Nothing is going to wipe out all life on this planet. It will be a lot of more of the same: we are becoming a smaller planet and we are rubbing elbows with more friction than in the past as countries expand. So, we are going to have turbulence, but we’re not going to enter a ‘New Age,’ other than what we do every year. We become a little bit more aware of things around us on this planet. 2012 is just going to be another year with its ups and downs. Aliens are not going to come down here and make themselves known. WHY NOT? Because there is no point in their making themselves known. It would disrupt the schoolyard. BUT THEY ARE REPORTED IN THE SKIES, ON THE GROUND, IN THE WATERS AROUND THE WORLD! And they always have been. They’ve always been here and been called other things, but now we’re calling them aliens and reptilians and greys. I never clearly remember what the beings look like, except I do remember the reptilians. Those reptilians I have seen actually seem to have more light than some other beings. WHAT AGE WAS YOUR FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH THE REPTILIANS AND WHAT DID THEY LOOK LIKE? The reptilians I encountered, when it became very plain to me was only a couple of years ago in 2005. THE SKIN IS BUMPY? I wouldn’t say bumpy, but for some reason you could tell the texture was scaly. I didn’t touch them. A FINER KIND OF SCALES THAN A CROCODILE? Yes, that’s probably so. SNAKE SKIN IS OFTEN VARIED IN COLORS AND SHADES. IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT DIFFERENT COLORS? Kind of a green-bluish shade. HOW DID THE REPTILIANS COME INTO YOUR LIFE TWO YEARS AGO? They just showed up. IN YOUR BEDROOM? I had just turned the lights off and jumped into bed and they came just before I fell asleep. HOW DID THEY COME? The reptilians just came right through the wall. I was awake and they seemed"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"to be in a big rush. There were two of them and they took me away. The reptilians moved rapidly around each other and then when they took me, I was moving with them. I was elevated to their speed after they touched me and I was one with them. They just raced off and we went into what I think was a ship. WHAT DO THOSE INTELLIGENCES WANT? What do all these beings want? There are a lot of beings out there and there are a lot of agendas to go with them.
