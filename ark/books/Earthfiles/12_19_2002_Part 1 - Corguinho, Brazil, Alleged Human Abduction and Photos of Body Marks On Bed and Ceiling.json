Photograph © 2002 by Flavio Mori, Jr. December 19, 2002 Campo Grande, Brazil - In the middle of November, a Brazilian businessman named Felipe Castelo Branco e-mailed to various UFO researchers a brief description of an alleged human abduction in Corguinho, state of Mato Grosso do Sul two hours northwest of Campo Grande by truck. There have been hundreds of reported human abductions around the world since the early 1960s. What made this e-mail unusual were the photographs "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"attached: One showed the imprint of a human body on a bed sheet with right arm extended and scorch marks on the pillow; another showed dark scorch marks on the wood ceiling above the bed also in the pattern of a human body with the right arm extended; a third photograph showed a lot of small, round stones that reportedly fell out of the sky around 7:30 p.m. on September 15, 2002, for several seconds right before a man named Urandir Oliveira disappeared from his bedroom for three days. Odd imprint of body on Urandir Oliveira's bed discovered by the two dozen family and friends forewarned by Mr. Oliveira. Telepathically, he said, he had been told by the non-humansthey would come to take him at or before 10 p.m. on September 15, 2002. The location was the Urandir and Jessica Oliveira farm in Coruinho.

Photograph © 2002 by Flavio Mori, Jr. Mr. Oliveira is 39 years old and was born and raised in Sao Paulo southwest of Rio de Janeiro. But some of his family lives on a small farm in Campo Grande, state of Mato Grosso Do Sul where he frequently visits. In the 1990s, Mr. Oliveira began telling people that extraterrestrial beings were coming in aerial craft to a particular valley 100 kilometers beyond the town of Campo Grande. But he said he first encountered tall, blond-haired \"extraterrestrial\" beings in 1976 when he was 13 years old in the country outside Sao Paulo. The Scandinavian-looking entities took him into a craft and put objects in his neck which the beings told him would \"facilitate our communication and interaction.\" Then in October 1998, his second abduction occurred in the Campo Grande, Mato Grosso Do Sul, region near a flat-topped hill or mesa. The story is that 70 people were there to watch because he contacted researchers to say the extraterrestrials wanted Mr. Oliveira to be publicly seen taken up in a beam into one of their craft. That event was allegedly videotaped by a TV station, but no tape was ever broadcast and no one at the station would even acknowledge such a videotape had been made. Mr. Oliveira's third abduction there was allegedly on Sunday, September 15, 2002 - the event that left the body prints on the bed sheet and the ceiling. According to businessman Felipe Branco, who has known Mr. Oliveira since 1996, the abduction took place around 7:30 p.m., September 15, until the night of September 18, when Mr. Oliveira suddenly returned back to his bedroom at 9 p.m. Mr. Oliveira does not speak English, but Felipe Branco does. Mr. Branco, an executive of Castelo Branco, Ltd., was educated at the University of London and runs businesses now for his family's ranches and holding companies in Rio de Janeiro, Italy and Campo Grande. Mr. Branco was driving to see Mr. Oliveira on September 15. When he neared the house, small, round rocks fell from the sky onto Mr. Branco's car and the surrounding ground. What happened next, Mr. Branco will tell in his own words. But first, there is now controversy about what happened. In early December, Brazil's Mutual UFO Network Director, A. J. Gevaerd, who publishes and edits Brazilian UFO Magazine , told me on the phone that the alleged Oliveira abduction was a hoax perpetrated for publicity in order to scam money from people and make Mr. Oliveira and his followers rich. On December 13, Mr. Gevaerd sent an e-mail addressed \"To the International UFO Community: Very Important.\" The e-mail begins: \"Please be informed that the story of a man abducted in Brazil, with dramatic photos of the scenario, is a campaign to promote overseas the biggest UFO hoaxer of all times in Brazil, Urandir Fernandes de Oliveira, who has actually created a sect of fanatics around him, composed of people who blindly believe in his alleged ET contacts and healing powers, none of them ever confirmed by anyone. The man has been repeatedly exposed as hoaxer by dozens of UFO researchers and many people even from his sect, after 'waking up to reality,' have come forward to describe Urandir's tricks and scheme.\" A. J. Gevaerd further states in his e-mail: \"His history is all fake and the man is fastly becoming a millionaire with his obscure agenda, supported by thousands of fanatics. ... This story is NOT to be taken seriously, as no responsible UFO researcher has been allowed to scrutinize the scenario and the alleged case.\" Felipe Branco had also received A. J. Gevaerd's e-mail when I reached him by telephone on December 13, at his Campo Grande office. Here begins his reaction to the hoax allegation and his description of what he says he saw and heard on September 15, 2002, at the alleged abduction location."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Large mesa above Urandir Oliveira farm in Corguinho, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil, a geographical area of iron-rich soil that has had unusual light phenomena reported for decades. Photograph © 2002 by Flavio Mori, Jr. Interview: Felipe Castelo Branco, Executive, Castelo Branco Ltd., Campo Grande (state of Mato Grosso Do Sul) and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil: \"Mr. Gevaerd has never done research in the place. Once, he tried to cut a deal with Mr. Oliveira to be the only channel of information and events happening in this area of Campo Grande. But Mr. Oliveira refused and said he wants to give all the information to anyone who is interested. This area is very difficult to access. It's about 100 kilometers (62 miles) from Campo Grande. It's in the middle of nowhere. We formed a UFO research association, all the people who have been traveling there and doing research, we have been gathering all those people. We are about 1000 plus members. So, we built up facilities there so we can go there and stay in a house, have running water and all the minimum facilities, to do all the research and work there. Otherwise, it would be impossible. So, when Mr. Gevaerd alleges that Mr. Oliviera charges a fortune for people who come to visit, it's a ridiculous accusation. You can come and see it for yourself. We have very basic facilities, minimum to be able to stay there for a few days and perform the research for the past six years. DOES MR. OLIVIERA SPEAK ENGLISH? No. He is a man of simple background. WHAT KIND? He has done high school only studies and he used to be in construction. He is a very simple man. WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF STRANGE PHENOMENA AT THIS AREA IN CAMPO GRANDE WHERE MR. OLIVIERA HAS ENCOUNTERS? It was a very shocking experience. I was already doing research in Campo Grande with Urandir. I have seen the ships, everything, beings. I have had many encounters there, incredible stuff! But I was very afraid because I could never see myself involved directly with this because it is very difficult to believe. Even though you see it in front of you, it is strange. It's like you are in a dream, like Disneyland. I don't know. It's very strange and very difficult to accept this reality. This last abduction that he suffered, let's say. When he was in the ship, he saw many of them (alien beings) there. He saw the reds, blonds, short ones, others with olive skin, chocolate kind of skin not black chocolate or cinnamon and they are working together, these people. I think they more or less are doing a joint venture here. WHY DID THEY TAKE MR. OLIVIERA, LEAVING THAT IMPRINT ON THE"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"BED AND ON THE CEILING OF THE ROOM? The imprint well, Mr. Oliviera was aware he was going to be abducted for a third time. They had warned him. In fact, he called a few researchers there. I could count 28, but there were more. And we were staying there and waiting for this to happen. But he did not know that these marks would be left. He did not know that. We discovered after. WHAT WAS THE DATE THIS OCCURRED? September 15, 2002. It was a Sunday. WHAT TIME? Between 7 to 7:30 p.m. Campo Grande time. COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN AGAIN WHY IT WAS THAT YOU AND THE 27 OTHER PEOPLE WERE THERE WITH MR. OLIVIERA? Because he wanted witnesses. This ET said, 'We're going to come and we're going to pick you up and you are going to stay with us for some time. While we pick you up, we are going to materialize stones as if it is raining. You know, those round stones? And we want witnesses.' So, he (Oliveira) warned all members of the association 'All who don't have work engagements who can be here in Campo Grande, please come.' So they came. And stayed there the whole week waiting because he did not know (when it would happen). The window of time was one week. We did not know when. So, people stayed there and it happened exactly as he said. ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY OF SEPTEMBER 15, WHAT WERE YOU DOING THAT EVENING AND WHERE WERE YOU AND WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED LEADING UP TO THE DRAMATIC PHOTOGRAPHS? I was arriving in the compound. Five minutes before this happened, I was arriving there because I had come back to Campo Grande after doing some stuff (at my office) and then I came back again. When I was coming back, I could see these stones coming down from the sky. That was amazing! I stopped the car and looked. 'What's going on? What's going on?' All these people coming, running, shouting, 'There, there, there!' They were pointing. There were stones falling. It was night. It was dark (except for car headlights and house lights). And I could hear my car (makes loud sound to indicate stones falling on the metal.) I wondered what was going on? You could see the stones falling. It looked as if it was raining stones. I picked up many of them. The other people, the other 27, they were collecting the stones themselves. They could see them falling. There are lights there. They could see them falling on the roof and making the noise there. (MAKES TERRIBLE NOISE). 'Oh, my God!' they were all screaming, like they were afraid. 'My God, what is going on here?!' Seven of the stones Felipe Branco picked up the night of September 15, 2002, from the ground around his car at the research compound in Campo Grande only minutes before he and the researchers discovered Urandir Oliveira was missing from his bedroom and there were body marks on the bed sheet and ceiling. Arranged in size order and photographed © 2002 by Felipe Branco."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The stones fell for like a few seconds, ten seconds or maybe 15 seconds, but it was prior to his abduction. Then I drove up the driveway of his house. We tried to open up his bedroom. It was locked and we broke in and when we came inside, there was this strange ozone smell and a sour type of smell. Very strange! YOU MEAN SOUR LIKE VINEGAR? Not really. I don't know how to describe. I would say sour is the closest description I can give of the smell. The ozone was very strong, but also this kind of sour, strange smell that I cannot identify. And we were all this bunch of people walking inside the room and the hairs of our bodies were raised, you know? WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING YOU SAW INSIDE THE ROOM? I saw the marks! I looked and was totally shocked. None of us expected it. We were all, 'My God, what is going on?' We were afraid and surprised at the same time. We said, 'What if he disintegrated? Did he die?' They were not scorch marks (on the sheet). It was not scorched. DID YOU TOUCH THE SHEET? Yes, I did. WHAT DID IT FEEL LIKE? It felt strange. It didn't feel hot. There was no smoke involved. Nothing. Just this strong ozone smell and this sour-type of smell. It may have been coming out from the mattress. IN THE PHOTO, IT ALMOST LOOKS WET. DID IT FEEL WET? No, it was not wet. It looked like a stain, more like a stain, not wet. YOU TOUCHED IT WITH YOUR FINGERS? Oh, yes, I touched it. SO YOU DID NOT FEEL MOISTURE AND YOU DID NOT FEEL HEAT? No, no moisture whatsoever. AND NO HEAT? No heat. WHERE THE LEGS AND THE BODY IMPRINTS IN THE SHEET WERE, DID THE TEXTURE OF THE SHEET FEEL DIFFERENT THERE THAN IT DID WHERE THE BODY MARKS WERE NOT? Yes, they felt different. They felt rougher, the texture felt rougher. WHERE THE BODY MARKS WERE? Ye s . YOU ALL STAYED IN THAT ROOM UNTIL HOW LONG? AND YOU COULD SEE THE CEILING MARKS? Yes, when you looked at the ceiling, that was the craziest because it was like a mirror image, you know? We were like, 'My God, he went through the ceiling and the roof.' We were very impressed. We stayed there for half an hour taking photos, filming, and then we locked the room. We locked the room and put a padlock on so no one could come in because we were waiting for this American scientist who came and collected samples and took them back to the United States to do research."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"AND HE TOOK SAMPLES FROM THE SHEET AND FROM THE CEILING AND THE WOOD? He took samples from everything and took it to the United States to do the research and said when he has finished the research, he will let us know the results. HE JOINED ALL OF YOU OUTSIDE THE LOCKED BEDROOM TO WAIT? The American was not there at the moment. He arrived, I think, a couple of weeks after. He was not present. YOU ALL LOCKED THE BEDROOM DOOR AND THERE WERE 28 OF YOU. DID YOU ALL WAIT THERE UNTIL HE CAME BACK? Yes. But I returned. I went back to Campo Grande because I had important business engagements I could not postpone. I had to return. But they all stayed there. HOW LONG WAS MR. OLIVEIRA GONE? He left on Sunday (September 15, 2002) around 7 p.m. and came back on Tuesday (September 17, 2002) around 9 p.m. WHEN HE CAME BACK, WERE YOU THERE? WHAT HAPPENED? No, I was not there. They called me from the compound and said, 'Please come because he has just arrived.' It was funny because the room was locked with padlocks. We all locked the room to protect it. And he returned to the same room. They dropped him there in the same place. And he was locked there like, 'My God, what is going on? They locked me inside.' He had to call and say, 'Please come and pick me up!' The people could not believe. They ran and said, 'My God, you are there.' They opened the door and he was there locked inside the bedroom. HE ACTUALLY CALLED PEOPLE ON A TELEPHONE TO SAY TO PEOPLE, 'OPEN UP MY BEDROOM AND LET ME OUT?' It is an internal telecommunications system (like an intercom). Not a normal phone. WHAT DID HE TELL EVERYONE THAT HAD HAPPENED IN THAT SUNDAY TO MONDAY TO TUESDAY TIME? He said that he was laying on his bed and was reading a book. Then the room filled with this violet light and he felt a fever-type sensation, like his body heating up. Then he saw himself being lifted and then through the ceiling and the roof and inside the ship there. When he got there, there was this being and he showed him this cylinder, transparent cylinder. He was put in there and the cylinder closed and there was this smoke around him. Then he saw himself with this strange nylon type of suit, jumpsuit. But these did not glow, this jumpsuit. It looked like nylon. (In other encounter experiences which Mr. Branco, Mr. Oliveira and others have experienced, tall humanoid beings have worn jumpsuits that \"glow like neon lights.\") THIS WAS SOMETHING THE BEINGS HAD HIM PUT ON? Yes. They showed him to this transparent cylinder that he had to lay down inside there. Then as soon as it closed, there was this smoke that filled the cylinder. Then it was as if this jumpsuit materialized on him. Then he came out of the cylinder and they brought him to the big room with other beings there and were telling him things and showing him things on a screen. NOW, LET'S TALK ABOUT THAT IN A SECOND. BUT WHAT TYPE OF BEINGS WERE THESE?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"These were the blonds, the red hairs, the chocolate skin, the small hairy ones. All these sort of beings there.

He was standing there, just standing there with him. They were showing him stuff on a screen. Image of Destructive Earth Future Between 2003 and 2012 WHAT DID HE SAY THEY SHOWED HIM ON A SCREEN AND TOLD HIM? They showed him how he was to give information about the things that are going to happen and how he is supposed to aid in this and showed him images of this. What he told me was that between 2003 and 2012, he said there is this meteor not a meteor, but, let's say a meteor that is coming inside our solar system that is going to effect our electromagnetic field and it is going to effect the polar like the pole shift type of thing. But he said it is not as dramatic as people are saying. It is much lighter, the event is going to be much lighter, not as dramatic as people are saying. He said there are going to be like 'ice rocks' falling to the earth. ROCKS OF ICE? Yes, rocks of ice. He called them 'ice rocks.' THAT SOUNDS LIKE A POSSIBLE ENCOUNTER WITH A COMET? Maybe. He lacks vocabulary, so it's difficult for him to understand. He describes things in a figurative way. But it is going to effect certain cities. But he could not recognize the cities. They showed me the screen of these ice rocks falling and hitting these cities, but I could not recognize them. I do not know where. And he said that and about this - not a bacteria how do you say? biological war? YES. He said it is already going on secretly, let's say. It's already going on, a certain"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"bacterial war, a biological/chemical. It is going on already. I did not understand it very well what he meant by that. But he said it's already happening in a light way and will become very serious after 2004. As if it is going to be out of control. WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT THERE WILL BE MORE ILLNESSES ON THE EARTH THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE A CURE FOR? Yes. But he said later on, these beings will provide information to certain people around the planet to heal this because we will not have technology to deal with these diseases. IF THE EXTRATERRESTRIALS KNOW ALL THIS IS COMING AND KNOW THAT THERE IS BIOLOGICAL WARFARE NOW AND IT WILL GET WORSE, WHY DON'T THEY STOP IT? I asked that to Urandir many times. He said it has to do with direct intervention. They cannot directly intervene. They can help in a certain way. Also, the interaction between us and them is difficult. You have to have your energetic fields, your personal vibrational frequency very balanced in order to sustain a contact with them. It is a very difficult interaction. DOES MR. OLIVEIRA SAY TO YOU, 'THESE BLOND AND RED HAIRED BEINGS AND THE ONES THAT ARE DARK SKINNED AND SHORT AND ALL, THIS WHOLE GROUP, THEY ARE TAKING ME BECAUSE...' DOES HE EXPLAIN WHY A FOCUS ON HIM? On him. He said like this. 'They are doing this to many people, but he did not specifically explain why him. I don't know if he knows.\" More Information: Urandir Oliveira's First Alleged Abduction in 1976 When He Was Thirteen Years Old Outside Sao Paulo WAS IT WITH THE SAME TYPE OF BEINGS WITH RED HAIR AND BLOND HAIR? I think it was with the blond hairs. DOES HE REMEMBER WHAT THEY TOLD HIM THEN? They took him. They took him up and then they put an implant on the back of his neck. They told him, 'this is to facilitate our communication and interaction.' Since then, they have been interacting with him. I sent you the x-ray. THE THREE GLOWING, SMALL OBJECTS IN HIS NECK? Ye s .

He says the objects were inserted during his first abduction at age thirteen in 1976 'to facilitate communication and interaction' with the tall, blond humanoid entities who took him into their craft from the country outside Sao Paulo. X-ray provided by Felipe Branco. Oliveira's Second Alleged Abduction on October 21, 1998 At Campo Grande Research Compound WHAT WAS THE SECOND ABDUCTION? It was in Campo Grande near this place. There were 70 people present and a camera crew from television here. WHY WAS THE TELEVISION CREW THERE? Because the ETs told him, 'We are going to show ourselves. Bring a camera crew here from a television because we are going to show ourselves.' He did not expect to be abducted. They told him that they would just fly-by the place, a specific place in this compound where we are now. He called the TV crew and brought them there and there were about 70 people, 70 researchers of our association there. I was not there. They all went up to the mesa-type hill there and this ship came, glowing, and threw this beam of light down and pulled him (Mr. Oliveira) up. And 70 people witnessed it. It was filmed by a camera crew from TV. We never heard of this. Tape, everything, just disappeared. THE TAPE DISAPPEARED. IT WAS NEVER BROADCAST? Never. Never broadcast. In fact, there was a big quarrel at the time because part of the camera crew they were so impressed. One of them was fired. It was a big mess. There is an effort to keep this information out of the public. This is clear. HAVE YOU TRIED TO GET IN TOUCH WITH MANAGEMENT AT THE TV STATION? Oh, yes, at the time. Many of us in our group of UFO researchers - we have lawyers, we have judges, we have many people from many walks of life. A couple of friends were lawyers and they asked, 'Please, you must provide us the tape.' And the TV station said, 'We were never there. There is no tape. There is nothing.' So, what can we do? IN THAT SECOND ABDUCTION, DID MR. OLIVEIRA SAY THAT IT WAS BLONDS AND RED HAIRS AGAIN? In this second abduction, there were various beings there. He stayed for 22 hours away. I was there when he came back and he looked as if he had chicken pox. His body was full of these black dots. He was very lazy and stayed for a couple of days very tired and sleepy and feeling numb and eating a lot of chocolate. EATING A LOT OF CHOCOLATE?"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Ye s . WHAT DID HE THINK ALL THE DOTS ON HIS BODY WERE FOR? He said it was some kind of reaction. He does not understand what exactly, but it was some kind of reaction (to what the beings did with him). Oliveira's Third Alleged Abduction on September 15, 2002 At Campo Grande Research Compound Discussed in the above report. Are Circular Patterns In Stone Related to Extraterrestrial Landing Gear? \"Circular landing marks\" found frequently in the Campo Grande area of Urandir Oliveira's and others' encounters. Exact source of the circle patterns is not known. Photograph with camera for size comparison © 2002 by Flavio Mori, Jr. Felipe Branco: \"These are landing marks by ships, craft. They (extraterrestrials) constantly land in that region and many people have sightings. These are marks of their landing gear in stone on, and near, the mesa, melted in some how.\" Further Comment About the Round Stones Felipe Branco: \"We are cattle breeders. We have farms all over. My mother's family practically founded this state (Mato Grosso Do Sul). They have extensive farms all over the state and I've never seen the stones anywhere else except where they've fallen when craft are around. Urandir says this area near Campo Grande is like a vortex. The energy fields there are very high because of the minerals in the natural rock there. I have never seen the stones anywhere else in Brazil, actually. We need to study them geologically, but haven't yet.\" A. J. Gevaerd: \"A geologist told me these are naturally occurring rocks in Brazil and nothing unusual.\" To be continued in Part 2.
