November 7, 1999 Environmental Updates - Primitive Fish A Half A Billion Years Ago One of the challenges of science is to figure out the beginning of things, from the dawn of the cosmos to how long ago vertebrate animals with bones first appeared on earth. In this past week's journal Nature , two Chinese teams reported the discovery of fish-like fossils with primitive backbones that are about 530 million years old. That puts them in the middle of the Cambrian epoch when all kinds of animal life proliferated on this planet. For Cambridge, England scientist, Simon Morris, the fact there were primitive fish nearly half a billion years ago means that \"the so-called Cambrian explosion was more abrupt and dramatic than we thought.\" Radio Telescope Might See The Beginning of Galaxy Creation? The Hubble Space Telescope and the Chandra X-Ray Observatory have been \"seeing\" into the universe more clearly than any manmade device before. But even they can't see back to the first creations of galaxies and planets. Now, astronomers from around the world are designing a giant array of radio telescopes that might be able to. A big advantage of radio telescopes that capture short wavelength radio emissions is their ability to see through dust and gasses that block optical images. Astronomers met at the Carnegie Institution of Washington in October to discuss the project they are calling the Altacama Large Millimeter Array, or ALMA. It would consist of 64 receiving dishes or antennas spread over 6.2 miles. That is too large for a mountain top, so scientists have picked out one of the driest and most remote spots on the earth to build ALMA - the Altacama desert on a 16,500 foot plateau in the Andes mountains of Chile. If all goes well, construction will begin in 2001 and perhaps be complete around 2007. Mutilated Half Cats in Toronto, Ontario, Canada A $60,000 reward has been offered by the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals for any information about the current cycle of mutilated and half cats that began in August 1999. The reward offer has generated phone calls, but no suspects. The SPCA's lead investigator, Debbie Hunt, is now seeking help from the Toronto Police whose focus will be serial killers, and presumably an international ring of them. Similar cat mutilations have been occurring in London, England, San Jose, California, Ft. Worth, Texas, and Ontario, Canada all at the same time. In the past two weeks, the case number in the Ontario province climbed from seven to ten as three more mutilated cats were found beyond North York, a Toronto suburb where the first dead cat was discovered on August 12th. The most recent mutilated bodies were found in Mississauga, a "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"community west of Toronto, Parry Sound approximately 100 miles north of Toronto, and in Sault Ste. Marie at the western edge of the Ontario province. 27,000 Migrating Black Birds Dead in Mascoutah, Illinois Still no arrests have been made in the Mascoutah, Illinois deliberate poisoning of 27,000 migrating black birds with the insecticide Furadan. I talked with an Illinois investigator Friday who said his state is waiting for the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service to press charges. 250 Gulls Dead In Erie, Pennsylvania The count of dead Ring Necked and Black Backed Gulls at Presque Isle State Park in Erie, Pennsylvania is now about 250. The Madison, Wisconsin laboratory doing necropsies and microbe analyses have so far ruled out Kunjin West Nile Fever. This past week, there was confirmation of Type E Avian Botulism in some of the birds and in several hundred ducks on Lake Huron near Chattem, Ontario. But there are still unanswered questions about the extensive hemorrhaging in most of the gulls and whether that could be connected to a blood thinning poison used to kill rats. Bizarre Calf Fetus in Los Brazos, New Mexico Another unusual animal death occurred Friday, October 22nd about 10 p.m. MST on the Canones Ranch in Los Brazos, New Mexico about 25 miles southeast of Dulce and about 11 miles south of Chama. Rancher Joe Martinez and his grandson tried to help a pregnant heifer who went into premature labor, but the fetus was in a breech position and Mr. Martinez had to use chains to pull the fetus out. It was grossly deformed. Mrs. Cordy Martinez told me, \"The calf was coming tail end first. They really had to work to pull it out because it had a big, big head. There was no resemblance to a calf. It was just a big, round head, round and sunken. And when they opened the mouth, they found that the eyeballs were under the cheeks.\" White tissue was growing out of the back of the head, ears protruded from the neck, intestines were growing outside the abdomen, all four legs were stunted and misshapen and so was the tail.

Joe Martinez told me that the mother of this fetus was a young heifer in 1997 in the same pasture that another of Joe's cows was found dead and mutilated. But the mother belongs to a friend in Chamayo who pastures his animals at the Martinez's Los Brazos ranch. KOAT-TV (ABC) Reporter Marisa Maes from Albuquerque talked to me about what happened and what she saw Saturday morning, October 23rd, when"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"everyone converged at veterinarian Leroy Martinez's office in Cibolla. Gabe Valdez, a field researcher for the National Institute of Discovery Sciences (NIDS) headquartered in Las Vegas, was there to authorize a necropsy on the fetus. Interviews: Marisa Maes, Reporter, KOAT-TV, Albuquerque, New Mexico: \"When it was born, it was so grotesquely deformed that they (Martinez family) just kind of freaked out. And what they did was throw it into the back of Joe's truck and drove it, he and his grandson, to Chama and went to the local cafe where a lot of the police hang out. And he called everybody out and said, 'Hey, look at this thing!' They all said, 'Wow, we've never seen anything like that before.' And that was about it. The police then notified the Discovery Science... THE INSTITUTE FOR DISCOVERY SCIENCE (NIDS). ... and Joe took it home to his shed. After it had been in his shed for over 24 hours and the whole community came to his house to see it - so it became like a little local attraction - he then took it to a veterinarian in Cebolla. We spoke with the (NIDS) representative (Gabe Valdez) and two of the officers from the Rio Riba Sheriff's Department who saw it and they all declined to say what it was. All the said was, 'We've never seen anything like it before and we don't know what it is and we're not going to go on camera.' That's what they told me. I was saying to them that it looks to me like it's a genetic mutation and obviously this cow aborted it. They said, 'Well, we don't know what it is and we've never seen anything like it and we have to do tests first.' WAS THERE ANY EYES OR NOSE? I did not see any eyes and there was a nose. I was trying to give a scientific answer because I didn't want to make a bigger deal than it should be, with people going, 'Oh, my God, we have an alien cow!'

Another Eyewitness: Many photographs and some videotapes by various people were taken of the deformed fetus. I talked with one New Mexico resident who says she did see two eyes. Rebecca Minshall is a licensed certified neuro-muscular therapist in Albuquerque. Rebecca Minshall, Licensed Certified Neuro-Muscular Therapist, Albuquerque, New Mexico: \"For awhile they thought there were no eyes. The gentleman lifted up a fold of skin in the front of this round-shaped head and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"underneath this fold of skin were eyes. They were white with a vertical pupil that looked very reptilian. YOU COULD SEE THIS CLEARLY? Absolutely see this very clearly. Very white, as white as a human's eyes and a very small, very narrow slit of a pupil that looked reptilian. I have no other way to describe it. WERE YOU LOOKING AT THIS VERTICAL SLIT IN BOTH EYEBALLS? Yes. He lifted up the flap over both eyes. THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN IF THE CALF WERE STANDING ON FOUR LEGS WITH THIS BASKETBALL HEAD - WHERE WOULD THESE EYES HAVE BEEN IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE BODY? Fairly low on the head. And there was a mouth, but it looked like a gash in the front of this basketball-shaped head. And it was kind of bloody. It was red. And the gentleman in the videotape opened that jaw, brought the jaw down slightly and I heard him say on the tape, \"Yes, there is a tongue in there. That jaw was basically the only feature on the head. Now, coming out the back of the head - if this were a human being lying on its back where your head touches the bed or pillow - was a protrusion that was white and membranous and when we looked at it we thought perhaps it was part of the brain that developed outside of the head. It was right in the back of the head and white. It didn't have as many ridges as cauliflower, but it kind of reminded you a little bit of a bunch of cauliflower stems together. There appeared to be no cranium whatsoever. There appeared to be no bone in the top half of this head. It was just skin on the top of the head, so as he moved the head from one side to the other, you could literally see the fluid sloshing back and forth. This gentleman said that when they withdrew some of this fluid, it was blood. JUST BLOOD. Yes. I believe he said it looked to be 95% blood. There were four legs that were quite deformed. It appeared that if the creature had lived there was no way the legs would ever have held up this body. The back legs were short and bent and I'm not even sure there was any kind of a joint in the leg at all. Close-up stunted hind legs and feet of deformed fetus. Photograph © 1999 by Adam Vance. The front legs also appeared to have some hoof material on them, but it seemed to me I recollect that it was splayed in some way so that it almost appeared like claws - very unusual, very abnormal. CAN YOU TRY TO GIVE A LITTLE MORE WORD PICTURE ON WHAT YOU MEAN, THEY ALMOST LOOKED LIKE CLAWS? The hooves appeared to be - whatever was at the end of these front legs had"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"something on the very end of them that reminded you some how of claws.\" More Information: Rancher Joe Martinez confirmed that the unformed front hooves had little finger bones that normally develop inside hooves. I asked him, \"And the eyes were down below that red gash of a mouth?\" He answered, \"Right. They were a little below the mouth.\" \"An eye with a vertical pupil?\" \"Right.\" \"That's true?\" \"Right.\" \"And what color were the eyes?\" \"They were kind of like blue eyes. And they pulled one eye out and took it to the lab.\" \"NIDS took one eye to analyze?\" \"Yes, one eye.\" \"And where is the carcass of this fetus now?\" \"It's on my ranch.\" \"How are you preserving it?\" \"It's just hanging from a tree drying out.\" \"Did Dr. Martinez say he found anything unusual?\" \"No. He just said it was a deformed cow. But to me, it didn't look like a deformed cow. It looked like something I've seen a lot of deformed calves, but this one was way, way off! Really strange.\" In the necropsy performed by Dr. Leroy Martinez, the heart and liver were enlarged, but the rest of the organs were normal for a bovine fetus. As of Monday, November 1st, the Rio Riba County Sheriff's Department signed off from any further investigation. To date, NIDS has not scheduled DNA testing, but I will have further information about the fetus's eye from NIDS on or about Nov. 14, 1999.
