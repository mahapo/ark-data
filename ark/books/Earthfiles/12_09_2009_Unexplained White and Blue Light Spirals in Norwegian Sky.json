Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Unexplained White and Blue Light Spirals in Norwegian Sky © 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe “T he light stopped mid-air, then began to circulate (rotate around and around). Within seconds, a giant spiral had covered a large portion of sky. Then a green-blue beam of light shot out from its centre.” - U. K.'s Daily MailOnline D ecember 9, 2009, early morning close-up of the white spiral after a mysterious light rotated in the sky and from the center of the white spiral came a blue-green spiral. According to some eyewitnesses, the white and blue spirals remained in the sky for ten to twelve minutes before fading out completely. Image © 2009 by Svein-Egil Haugen. U nexplained white and blue aerial spiral lights were seen for several minutes between Tromso and the Finnmark region of northern Norway before sunup on Wednesday, December 9, 2009. Update 10:30 PM Mtn, December 10, 2009: “W e have seen rockets being launched from northwest Russia, and from the rocket range in Kiruna in northern Sweden, and from the neighboring Andenes in northern Norway, but nothing like this.” - Truls Lynne Hansen, Dir., Tromso Geophysical Observatory, Norway A fter the Russian government's denial on December 9, 2009, that it had not conducted any missile tests that could explain the white and blue light spirals over northern Norway, today on December 10, 2009, the Russian Defense Ministry now says a Bulava ballistic missile launch from the Russian Navy nuclear submarine “Dmitry Donskoi” in the region had failed. However, the Russian Defense Ministry would not confirm any connection with the white and blue spiraling lights over northern Norway. Adding to the mystery is Norway's concern that its government had no prior communication from Russia that any such missile tests were scheduled near northern Norway. Another speculation has been microwave tests of the ionosphere from Tromso, Norway, impacting the atmosphere in an unexpected way. But, ionospheric physicists in Gakona, Alaska; Arecibo, Puerto Rico; Tromso, Norway; and other facilities have been bouncing microwaves off the ionosphere for at least a decade of research. Any oscillation that humans produce in the ionosphere is immediately obliterated as soon as sun rays shine on any part of the ionosphere. However, spiraling lights phenomenon as seen and photographed over northern Norway yesterday has not been reported at ionospheric research sites.

See: VG-TV Video. See: YouTube videos. U. K.'s Daily MailOnline reports, “The phenomenon began when what appeared to be a blue light seemed to soar up from behind a mountain. The light stopped mid-air, then began to circulate (rotate around and around). Within seconds, a giant spiral had covered a large portion of sky. Then a green-blue beam of light shot out from its centre - lasting for ten to twelve minutes before disappearing completely. The Norwegian Meteorological Institute was flooded with telephone calls - which astronomers have said did not appear to have been connected to the aurora, or Northern Lights, so common in that area of the world.” First speculations were that the mysterious spiraling lights might have been a Russian missile test, but Russia denies it was conducting any missile tests in the Norwegian area. B efore sunup on December 9, 2009, residents in northern Norway were photographing, videotaping and describing a baffling aerial phenomenon that some said looked like a giant computer-generated graphic in the early morning sky.
