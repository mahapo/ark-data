Stringfield With permission, reprinted in Earthfiles.com © 2005 by Linda Moulton Howe. McGuire AFB and Fort Dix Military Reservation near Wrightstown, New Jersey, are near the U. S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The bases are about 45 miles east of Philadelphia, 50 miles south of New York City, 60 miles north of Atlantic City and 10 miles west of the Atlantic ocean. The Fort Dix / McGuire Air Force Base / Lakehurst Naval Air Station complex covers 42,000 acres. Click back to Part I, Status Report IV To be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 2 of Status Report I V, written for the June 28-30, 1985, MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium Proceedings in conjunction with the national MUFON conference held in Saint Louis, Missouri. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report V begins at Earthfiles 012805 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Leonard H. Stringfield: \"By March 1981, while preparing the text for Status Report III, I had decided it was time to take inventory; time for appraisal of the material on hand and of myself still in the midst of a heated controversy among researchers over the pros and cons of UFO crashes and retrievals. I needed outside thinking and assessment of cases, a new perspective. To this end, I invited to my home two trustworthy friends who supported and contributed to my endeavors: Dr. Peter Rank, Chief of Radiology at the Methodist Hospital in Madison, Wisconsin; and Richard Hall, former Assistant Director of NICAP and then Editor of the MUFON UFO Journal . ( Note 3: See statement in Epilogue, page 49, of Status Report III , signed by Dr. Peter Rank and Richard Hall.) During our long weekend chats, evaluating every case I planned to publish, we agreed that the Ft. Dix-McGuire encounter was among the foremost as to potential value - provided we could establish the genuineness of Morse. On this premise, I gave Hall his name and address, hopeful that new blood might stimulate a response. On April 10, 1982, Hall sent Morse a certified letter offering on my behalf to meet him anywhere, anytime, to discuss the incident and to provide professional services and funds, if needed. Curiously, the certified letter was received and signed for by Morse, April 12, 1982, but the silence continued. It continued for 17 months! Then on September 27, 1983, Hall received an urgent letter from Morse, quoted as follows: USAF Security Policeman Morse Reply on September 27, 1983: 'I am writing you in regards to your letter, 10 April 1982. I'm sorry that it has taken so long to answer your letter. I had to be sure about you and your organization. My mail has not been monitored for some time now. However, I must not express my information in the letter form. I have been warned, threatened and I have personally been "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"interrogated as recently as February 1983, in reference to the subject I discussed with Len Stringfield. I also have further information ... which I know will interest you ... I have the opportunity now to travel to D. C. area. So if you wish to contact me gain, you should still have my address. Hope to hear from you soon. If after 2 weeks, I have not heard from you, I will no longer acknowledge my participation with your group, nor will I answer any mail.' When Hall phoned the news to me I advised that he follow up quickly by letter and arrange for a meeting. Unfortunately, because of personal circumstances, Hall's reply on October 10, 1983, was sent a couple of days later than the deadline set by Morse. Again, silence. On November 30, 1983, I wrote Morse the following letter, quoted in part: Leonard Stringfield Letter to Morse on October 10, 1983: '... I held off writing until today, hoping that a little breathing time would give you the motivation to write. It is difficult to believe that the mail I sent you in 1980 and 1981 failed to reach you. Or, if you had received my letters that you were unable to reach me in some manner. Obviously, there was interference both ways ... I felt hopeful that Hall's letter could open a new door of communications - or, better still, a personal meeting with him.s have passed, I feel again concerned about your safety ... Assuming you are still a 'free' person, I suggest you simply call me, reversing the charges. ...Jeff, please respond in some way, if only to acknowledge you r eceived this letter.' More surfaced by phone on December 6, 1983, and I heard his voice for the first time. He called me at dinnertime, identifying himself by first name only. He said he felt safe now as enough time had passed since an official visitor warned him about his oath of secrecy. Talking cautiously for about 15 minutes, we covered the basics of many issues. Among his high points, however, were the disclosures that two days after the incident, he and others on duty at the scene were summoned to Wright-Patterson AFB for interrogation and that each was transferred promptly to a separate base overseas. His assignment was to a new Security Police Squadron in Okinawa. 'Others,' he said, 'went to the Philippines, Germany and Korea.' Finally, he promised to answer any questions I had by letter and he gave me his phone number. Morse's phone call opened the gates. I followed up the next day with a four-page letter in which I reiterated questions asked in 1980. Also, excerpted from my letter: Leonard Stringfield Letter to Morse on December 7, 1983: 'Your testimony is important. Of course, I'll need back-up witnesses such as Dick Hall, so that credibility is established. ...Enclosed is a copy of Status Report III . Your report, Case A3, is on Page 9 with my comments about our correspondence problems. At one point, I wondered if you really existed, or if your letter was a hoax. So, you can imagine my relief when I heard your voice.' Morse replied promptly, his letter post-marked December 14, 1983, included a map he sketched of the scene of action and a rough drawing of the body. (Answers to some of my key questions appear later in the text of this paper wherever the subject is appropriate.) Additional information came by phone, December 13, 1983. In this exchange, I got the names and ranks of the officers who were his interrogators at Wright-Patterson. These, he said, were obtained from a source still in the Air Force he preferred not to identify. December 14, 1983, Map of McGuire AFB and Ft. Dix Army Base, New Jersey, with Alien Body Sketch "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" With the Ft. Dix-McGuire case going from Square One to Square Two, my dialogue with Morse was not on a constant but cautious track, always mindful of surveillance. The next event came as a surprise by certified mail postmarked December 23, 1983. On the flap of the envelope it said, 'Merry Christmas. I hope you like it.' Inside was a xeroxed copy of the Incident/Complaint Report (Form 1569) that Morse had hinted by phone he might be able to procure as important back-up. The Report was brief, but essentially contained the same story told by Morse. Prepared by Desk Sgt. WC and signed by 1st Lt. WS, it was channeled to Col. Landon, Commanding Officer of McGuire AFB; Brig. Gen. Brown, Hdq., 21st Air Force (at MAFB); and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI). It contained the names of the security policemen involved, including Morse, and the name of the MP assigned to Ft. Dix whom Morse later identified as the person having shot the alien intruder.

However, as agreed in our ensuing talks, I have deleted the names of the persons in the document. Also, to protect the persons named, as he later confirmed when questioned, Morse had opaqued out the social security numbers opposite each name in the report. 'These numbers are private,' he said.\" Continued in Part 3 - USAF Security Policeman Describes Alien Body Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
