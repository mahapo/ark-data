Out of print. Return to Part 1 January 7, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - ***** Chapter 10 Back from Utopia Bill Smith returned from his two-month hiatus and found the committee swamped with material they received from Tim. The scientists were so busy with Tim's revelations that they had forgotten Bill was gone. He was not offended. Bill was aware of all that was happening with Tim and the committee while he was away. Bill gave the scientists time to assimilate all the information that Tim had for them before Bill divulged all that he had learned during his time way. Bill told the committee that he would take thirty days off and spend them with his family. His two children were in college, so he spent a weekend with them. The rest of the time, he and his wife took a cruise to a secluded island. Bill Smith never divulged exactly what he did at work to his wife. Curiously, she never pried or attempted to find out what his work involved. She was a petite, shy woman. She kept to herself most of the time and was the exact "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"opposite of Bill, who was outgoing and loved to talk. After his encounters with the Aliens, Bill was no longer as extroverted as he once was. He became quieter in the later years that he was with the program and only spoke when he had something to convey to the committee members. There was no more idle chat from him, which his colleagues missed because Bill was the one with all the good jokes. He was also good at telling some tall tales. That's why his colleagues did not believe him when Bill first disclosed that he had made Alien contact. Even though Bill was a “kidder,” his friends and colleagues had a deep respect for him. His knowledge and ability to grasp and understand concepts impressed everyone he met. He was talkative most of his adult life and only changed after his first few contacts with the Aliens. His personality changed drastically after that and his knowledge seemed to quadruple every day. His colleagues called him “Spock,” a character in the Star Trek TV series. Unlike Spock, Bill Smith showed compassion for all those around him while maintaining a “strictly business” mentality. Bill's wife told him that when he was away those two months, she did not miss him at all. She was not being insensitive to him. She told Bill she could feel his presence the whole time he was gone. Bill did not tell her that she was with him the whole time. An Alien that took on his wife's looks and personality was left behind in her place. Bill had asked the Aliens if he could take his wife with him. The Aliens had one condition: that she would not be allowed to remember and that Bill could not tell her that they went on a journey together to another planet. Bill agreed, although he would have preferred that this trip be the vacation of a lifetime for the two of them. But it was more important for him that he had his wife with him and was glad that he did not have to leave her at home for two months alone. While they were on the Earth island vacation after the long journey to another planet, Bill's wife told him about a strange dream she had while he was away. She told him that they were in a strange place, just the two of them. The kids were not with them. It was like another planet. She knew that because it had more than one sun. There were three suns all different sizes. One was a little bigger than Earth's sun. The other two suns were much smaller, but brighter, than Earth's full moon. That planet had several moons, all different colors. Unlike our Earth moon, the inhabitants of that other planet could travel to all its moons, as she and Bill did. “The moons had cities on them, cities that can only exist in dreams because they were too beautiful to be real,” she told Bill. “The cities were so clean that they sparkled like diamonds.” The dream was so real that she actually remembered how the food tasted. Again, the food was so incredible that it had to be a dream. She wished that she could share that dream with him. It was so hard to describe how wonderful it made her feel. If she didn't know better, she would have thought it really happened! Bill was surprised at how much she was allowed to remember “in a dream.” He thought the Aliens were going to mask what had taken place. Bill was pleased that his wife had the gift of a fantasy vacation after all! Bill wished that he could tell her about the remaining 80% of things the two had seen and experienced. Some of it was so fantastic that both Bill and his wife had to be sedated to keep their senses from exploding. The couple also had to wear a special suit and put on headgear equipped with a sun visor, similar to those used on Earth ski slopes. The temperature of that Alien planet was hotter than that of Earth and at least twice as bright. There was no night. It never got dark. Clouds did not exist there either. The variety of trees and plants, not to mention the colors and diversity of flowers, would have sent an earthly botanist into a frenzy. Bill was forbidden to reveal these experiences to anyone except the committee. The Aliens were not afraid that Bill would leak out damaging information about them to the general public or his wife. The Aliens were only concerned that Bill would look foolish to his wife and friends if he revealed even a small fraction of what he knew. Bill had enough discipline to keep himself from telling anyone in the community or the general public. But it took extraordinary discipline to keep some secrets from his family and closest"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"friends. The most difficult time for Bill came when the Aliens took his own daughter and she woke up with her nose bleeding. Bill knew what happened to her and what she had been through, but he had to pretend and make up some story about what might have caused it. When Bill was young, his parents told him nose bleeds were something that happened to children. So that's what Bill ended up telling his daughter. She was twelve when Bill came to know the Aliens personally. He was present one time when the Aliens abducted his daughter. After that, Bill asked not to be present at any more of her abductions. It was difficult enough for him to watch someone else's child crying during some of the procedures while having no way to console them. It was completely unbearable to watch his own child, especially when she looked up at him and cried, “Help me, Daddy!” Yet, Bill could do nothing but observe. He understood some of the things that took place and why. The things he did not understand were the most painful. If Bill woke up one day and discovered that the Aliens were doing evil things to him and his family, it would not matter. There is no way he could turn them off. The whole of the United States military, or of the whole planet, could do nothing to stop the Aliens. Bill Smith was glad that down deep inside, he believed the Aliens to be good and so he worked willingly with them. But Bill did have a twinge of suspicion in the back of his mind. He never felt like he was a slave to the Aliens, but because they were able to implant any reality into his mind, he was never completely sure of their true intentions. The Aliens understood his suspicions and told him that his ability to be suspicious of them was proof that the Aliens do not have control over him. If the Aliens did, they could easily mask over any doubts in his mind. Instead, since the Aliens have the upper hand anyway, they are able to work with humans without resorting to glossing over all feelings of mistrust humans have. The Aliens could turn all humans into zombies if they wanted to, but that's not their mission. Few humans are able to work with the Aliens in the capacity that Bill and Tim do. The Aliens go through an extensive process of elimination before they find a human they can reveal themselves to. Bill met others like himself while visiting the other planet. Not all of them were from Earth. Those who were not from Earth still had the same body and facial features as Earth humans. In fact, they were all from the same gene pool as Bill was. Bill only met with seven who were from other planets. They represented two planets that were exact duplicates of Earth. There are billions of planets that are similar to Earth. There are billions of planets that are significantly different from Earth. Since the planets that are different had no bearing for Bill Smith and the others, those non-Earths were not discussed. But the Aliens told Bill that non-Earths was something he might learn more about in the future. Ancient Language It was the strangest feeling for Bill and the others on the other planet when an Alien triggered a universal language in them. It was the first demonstration the Aliens did. It took place while he was with the first group, “the group of seven” as he called them. The first meeting was held in a magnificent courtyard somewhere in the main city. An Alien spoke a single word to them. That word was an access code that triggered something inside their human brains. Once the Alien spoke the code word, a small area of the brain that was previously dormant in all seven people became activated. At that instant, the group all began to talk to each other in the same language. In a second group of twelve, Bill Smith was surprised to find a dozen others like him from planet Earth. Although he and the committee had theorized earlier in the program that there had to be other countries on Earth which had an Alien spacecraft, the committee had no evidence of it, nor did they ever suspect there could be a dozen or more! Bill Smith was one of two from the group of earthlings who spoke English."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Aliens triggered that same language “ module” in them. One of the humans present asked the Aliens if each of the twelve could access that activated language part of the human brain on their own. The Aliens told them the humans could not. It was not a language that was currently being spoken on Earth, although it was used on Earth thousands of years ago. The intention of that visit was to broaden their human awareness and to learn a little more about what is involved in being a human in this Milky Way galaxy. And “little” was correct. The humans all left that place with more questions and fewer answers. Bill expressed his feeling to the Aliens that “much was shown to the human group, but little was given for them to understand.” The Aliens responded that not only do many levels of Aliens exist, but so do many levels of humans. “The understanding that any one human will have depends on what level he or she is at.” That alone determines what each can comprehend and keep for themselves when each leaves the other planet. On Earth, there are seven levels. On other planets, the range can vary from one to fifty-two levels. The level that a person is on is not determined by intelligence alone, but comes mainly from something much deeper inside the soul. It is something not easily obtained. It was not for the Aliens to elaborate about what that was - except something that had to be determined by each individual. Only two out of the twelve humans at that meeting were at level seven. The rest had achieved the rank of level five or six. Who was at what level was not disclosed. None of them could know at what level each was. Humans would only know their level after they died. That was all that the Aliens were able to tell Bill and the others. Once the people returned to Earth, it was unlikely that Bill would see or meet any of the other eleven again. Aliens recruited humans to do work for them throughout history. Bill and the others are only the newest members of that fraternity. One of the things revealed to Bill at the meeting was that not all Aliens are of the good kind. Some are evil and spend their time interfering with the human race. Bill was told that the craft he and the committee had in their possession was not damaged in an accident. In reality, it had been attacked by one of the ships belonging to renegade Aliens. The shipwreck could have been cleaned up with all signs of its existence kept secret by the Aliens, but they were directed by others in a higher level of the matrix “to let it stay.” The Aliens allowed the craft to come into the hands of certain chosen people, the committee, who the Aliens knew were going to be brought into their fold anyway. It also served to give the renegades a small victory, since they were determined to give the world a sampling of the “Alien terror that loomed before all mankind.” The Aliens let Bill Smith know that the renegades are only a minor irritation to them and that the renegades are responsible for many of the sightings reported by the general public. The Aliens are not here to make contact. The Aliens were here before humans were conceived and the Aliens will be here when time for humanity has expired. The renegades have taken people and have done harm to the human condition. The renegades don't always succeed with their plans, but have managed to plant their evil seed in every corner of the world! ***** C ontinued in Part 16 - Interview with author Lou Baldin.
