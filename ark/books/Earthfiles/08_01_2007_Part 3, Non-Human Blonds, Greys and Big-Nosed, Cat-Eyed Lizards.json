Return to Part 1 Return to Part 2 August 1 , 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Strange \"Moon Stone\" Ring My Dad went in for surgery on Nov. 9, 1980. The doctors said he had to have bypass surgery. The doctor was from overseas. FROM WHERE? The Philippines is what I was told. I never met him. During the surgery on my Dad, the Philippine doctor cut a vein and my Dad bled to death on the operating table. Two weeks after that, the doctor disappeared out of the U. S. All attempts by me – I could not find his name or anything. So, I kind of feel that my Dad’s death was not an accident. I inherited a ring my Dad used to wear. He and I had talked and he told me he was going to let me know everything he did in the military. TELL YOU EVERYTHING ABOUT THE E. T. SITUATION? Yes. That he would tell me about the blond ‘astronauts’ in my bedroom when I was a kid. DID HE MENTION EARTH’S SECRET WAR? Not in so many words. DID HE ALLUDE TO EARTH’S SECRET WAR? He said there were things going on that nobody knew about – things that could be detrimental. I asked him to talk with me then. He said, ‘No, I’ll do this surgery first. I’ve got five doctors telling me I need it. So, we’ll talk after the surgery.’ WERE THOSE WORDS SAID ON A TELEPHONE? Yes, because I had the flu and they did not want anyone to be close to a person who was going to have open heart surgery. So I told him I would be there after his surgery. A couple of days later, he had his surgery. But when I got there, I found out that things had gone wrong. There was a doctor who was supposed to do the surgery originally. But this Philippine doctor stepped in. Supposedly he was from the Philippines training and was supposed to be a very good doctor in surgery. But he made a mistake and my Dad died. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"WAS YOUR FATHER WEARING THE STRANGE METAL RING BACK THEN? Ye s . WHAT WAS IT LIKE? It was silver in color, about the size of a class ring. It had a large ‘moon stone’ in it - that's what he called it. That stone was probably as big as your little fingernail around and stuck up about ¼ inch. WHAT COLOR? It was a milky white color. WHAT FINGER DID HE WEAR THE RING ON? On his right hand ring finger. WAS THERE ANYTHING CARVED ON IT ANYWHERE, ANY SYMBOLS OF ANY KIND? Yes, on each side of the ring there was a triangle. In the center of each triangle was inset a small diamond. WHAT DID HE TELL YOU BEFORE HE DIED ABOUT THAT RING? Even growing up, I asked him about it. He told me it was a moon stone. I said, ‘Oh, I never heard of a moon stone.’ He said, ‘Well, it comes from the moon!’ So, I was always fascinated by it because I thought it came from the moon. WHEN DID YOUR DAD FIRST GET THE RING? He wore it for as long as I can remember. WAS YOUR DAD A MEMBER OF A MASONIC LODGE? No, not to my knowledge. I had two uncles who were 32nd degree Masons. Their rings had two eagles on them with a diamond in the center. My Dad’s ring was totally different. It was smooth silver and had a silver band that ran around the moon stone. Then there were the two triangles on each side carved out with what I thought were small diamonds in them. I’m not exactly sure, but a bright stone right in the center of each triangle. THEY WERE CLEAR LIKE DIAMONDS? Ye s . HE DIED FROM BLEEDING TO DEATH ON THE SURGERY TABLE ON NOVEMBER 9, 1980. Right. First thing was at my Dad’s funeral. There was more military brass there than I’ve seen when I was in the military. They were showing up in limousines. They all went over to talk to my Mom. Then, there were some guys there dressed in dark suits, dark hats, sunglasses. Mom asked me not to wear Dad’s ring to the funeral, so I did not. HOW DID YOU GET THE RING? WHEN DID YOU GET THE RING? AND WHAT HAPPENED? He gave it to my Mom to hang on to because you couldn’t wear any jewelry in surgery. He told my Mom that he needed to be buried with the ring. But my Mom said that I needed it. She gave it to me when we got home from the funeral and I put it on. DID YOU PUT IT ON THE SAME RIGHT HAND, RING FINGER? Yes. And I got pretty regular visits afterward (from non-humans). But I cannot recall by who. My mind is kind of a blank on that, but I do remember visits. I don’t recall any bad experiences. They left me feeling like I was put here for a reason, like there is something I’m supposed to do. I don’t know when or where. DID YOU EVER THE RING GLOW OR ANY OTHER ANOMALY? It would glow now and then. IT WOULD GLOW FROM THE MOON STONE?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Yes. It would glow sometimes when Dad wore it and he would just attribute it to the way the sun was hitting it or moon light was hitting it. WHEN YOU WERE WEARING THE RING AND IT GLOWED, DID YOU EVER GET ANY TELEPATHIC MESSAGES IN YOUR MIND? No. But, I saw a bright, metallic-looking object in the sky both times when I saw the ring glow. Moon Stone Ring Disintegrated WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR DAD’S RING? I was wearing it one day and it just disintegrated. Fell apart. DID YOU SEE IT FALL APART ON YOUR FINGER? Yeah, it was baffling! The moon stone hit the ground and went rolling and the ring just went to pieces. SO YOU HAD PIECES OF METAL IN YOUR HAND AND YOU COULD PICK UP THE STONE? Ye s . WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM? They are locked away somewhere safe. SO YOU DO HAVE THE PIECES? Ye s . WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED TO CAUSE THE RING TO DISINTEGRATE? The non-humans broke contact. THEY BROKE CONTACT, BUT WHICH ONES BROKE CONTACT? That I’m not sure. I think it was the blue-eyed blond-haired ones. WHY WOULD THEY BREAK CONTACT? I think for my safety. WHY? I’m not sure, but it’s just something I think I know. Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards WE WENT THROUGH THE IMAGES YOU WERE SHOWN ON THE CRAFT AND THE MESSAGE TO YOU WAS THAT THE 5-FOOT-TALL YELLOW-EYED, VERTICAL PUPILS, BIG NOSED CROCODILE/LIZARD TYPE HAVE BEEN WORKING UNDERGROUND IN TUNNELS ALL OVER THIS PLANET, I ASSUME? I’m assuming that, too. TO CREATE WHATEVER THE PRODUCT IS THAT THE LIZARD TYPES ARE COMING BACK TO HARVEST. Right. SOME ALLEGED GOVERNMENT INSIDERS HAVE TOLD ME THAT THE GREY TYPES HAVE PEBBLY SKIN LIKE A SNAKE’S. BUT SNAKE SKIN IS DIFFERENT THAN CROCODILE SCALES. THEY ARE BOTH REPTILES. Right."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"SO WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SNAKE-SKINNED GREYS AND CROCODILE-SCALY BIG NOSED ONES? The only picture I have is of an ant colony. You have your worker ants, your soldier ants – they all look a little different, but they are working together for the same controllers maybe? WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BLONDS ARE ABOUT? WHERE ARE THEY FROM? WHY ARE THEY MIXED UP IN THIS? I think they have been here all along as protectors of the Earth. HAVEN’T THEY FAILED MISERABLY? I don’t think they have failed. I get the feeling that the blonds are smarter than they are letting on. There is something else there, but what I don’t know. The battle scenes I was shown by them was just like the beginning and I haven’t been shown the end. HITLER WAS OBSESSED WITH A BLUE-EYED, BLOND-HAIRED SUPER RACE. THERE WERE SUP P OSED TO BE DISCS COMING UP OUT OF P ENEMUNDE, GERMANY. HITLER WANTED TO TAKE OVER THE EARTH. SO, WHICH NON-HUMANS REALLY HAVE WHICH AGENDA? I think each one has their own agenda. YOU DON’T REALLY HAVE A CLEAR PICTURE OF AGENDAS? Not consciously. INTUITIVELY, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO UNFOLD BETWEEN NOW AND 2012? Between now and 2012, I think there is going to be chaos. Terrorism is going to end up hitting the United States here pretty soon. It’s just going to be ugly. And I personally think that around 2012 is going to be the final battle between Good and Evil. BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN THAT THE BIG NOSED LIZARDS ARE SHOWING UP TO GATHER THEIR HARVEST FROM UNDERGROUND TUNNELS BEFORE 2012? I don't know and I didn’t see any weapons. That’s confusing and keeps sticking in my mind. IF THIS OCCURRED WITHIN THE NEXT TWO YEARS, WHAT WOULD BE LEFT FOR 2012? I don’t think the lizard things destroy everything, but they get their point across. But is it them that’s doing all the destroying? Like you asked, what if the images I was shown by the blonds were deceptive? I do know I saw images of the big nosed lizard things harvesting that cocoon stuff in those tunnels. I don’t know if that’s something to help us, hurt us, or they want to get those cocoons out of here before people do know what’s going on and try to destroy stuff in those tunnels? DO YOU THINK THE TUNNEL ACTION IS GOING TO HAPPEN BETWEEN 2007 AND 2009? I don’t know.
