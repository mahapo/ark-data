By October 8 when this photograph was taken by MUFON field investigator Lou Ashby, the jaws and neck had been stripped to the bone, the teats cleanly cut off at surface of udder, vaginal and rectal tissue cored out and half the tail removed. Photograph © 2000 by Lou Ashby. October 15, 2000 Boulder, Colorado - Since the 1950s, unusual deaths called \"animal mutilations\" have been reported around the world. Both domestic animals and wild game have been affected, especially horses and cattle. Ranchers and law enforcement have long been puzzled because animals are found with the same pattern of hide and tissue removed usually without blood from the head, sexual organs, and rectum with no signs of struggle or tracks around the dead animals. Not even the animal's own tracks which provoked law enforcement to wonder if perpetrators came in and out of pastures using aerial craft. Colorado has had hundreds of such cases, including a heifer found nine miles south of Boulder near Eldorado Springs on October 2nd. Eyewitnesses saw the cow alive the day before. The Boulder resident who first found the mutilated heifer is Lou Ashby, a former newspaper reporter, writer and MUFON field investigator for the past six years. I talked with her this weekend about her discovery near Eldorado Springs. Interview: Lou Ashby, former newspaper reporter, writer and current MUFON field investigator, Boulder, Colorado : \"As we were hiking back into the open country there, we saw a dead cow lying on its side with its legs sticking up very stiffly. So, we crossed the little creek to get over to it. When I came up to the cow, the wounds to its head were very strange. I looked at them closely. The hide and flesh had been taken off in a circular pattern along the jaw and the whole muzzle of the cow. The mouth was opened and I looked in and there was no tongue. The tongue had been removed way far from in the throat. I checked the udder. The teats were still there. They were intact. And I checked the cow's rear end and there was no damage there.

COULD YOU GIVE HIGHLIGHTS ABOUT WHAT KEPT CHANGING? On Tuesday, the owner found the cow. There were three witnesses there also. The excisions were also present that I mentioned: the tongue was missing, but in addition, the teats were now missing and the rectum and vagina were cored out. That was the morning of October 3rd. In the afternoon of that same day, the owner came back and dragged the carcass away to another site about 1/4 of a mile away and left it in a stand of small bushes. On Wednesday, the 4th, the next day, I went out with a team from MUFON and we investigated the site. When we arrived at the site, to our surprise the carcass was missing. We didn't know, of course, that the owner had dragged it away. But we took photographs of the site and soil samples and grass samples. ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THE GRASS AT THAT PLACE? We were impressed with the fact that there was a roughly circular patch that we measured to be 12 feet in diameter of grass that was more than a foot long whereas the surrounding grass was very short. And this grass was flattened and swirled. That was exactly where the carcass had been laying.

By Sunday, October 8th, I had found the name of the owner and we had talked to him and he told us where he had dragged the carcass. So, the same four members of MUFON and I went out again to what I call Site Number 2 and the body was there. What we found then was in addition to the previous wounds, the cow's neck was completely de-fleshed. All the hide and skin on the entire skin, including the eyes and ears and down the neck to where it starts joining with the body - all of that flesh was removed. And half the tail had been cut off. I saw nothing that looked like bite marks or tear marks or tugging or pulling. And the wounds we did see had precise edges."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"October 8, 2000, more tissue from the heifer had been removed including half the tail, flesh from the neck vertebrae and heifer's jaw. Photograph © 2000 by Lou Ashby. I UNDERSTAND THE OWNER HAD ANOTHER UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATH EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO? He lost a cow under somewhat similar circumstances and he said when he found that dead cow, it was lodged in a stand of trees and it was lodged so tightly they had to cut down trees to get the body out. What Mr. Hogan said to me was that he saw these excisions on the body of the animal, 'You could tell it had been done with a laser.' HOW DID IT COMPARE TO THIS NEW ONE? He said they were similar. AND TO HAVE AN ANIMAL LODGED SO TIGHTLY SUGGESTS THE ANIMAL WAS DROPPED FROM THE AIR DOWN INTO THE TREES. I can't think of any other explanation. It couldn't have been dragged there.\" Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
