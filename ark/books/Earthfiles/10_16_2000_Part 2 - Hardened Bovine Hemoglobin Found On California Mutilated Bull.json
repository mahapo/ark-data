C. Levengood, Biophysicist R eturn to Part 1. October 16, 2000 Grass Lake, Michigan: W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist and Owner, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, called me in early January 1997, to talk about his examination of black particles that rancher Jean Barton found on one of the several mutilated cattle she and her husband, Bill, have discovered on various pastures of their Red Bluff, California ranch. He read to me from his lab work book about the hard, dark particles found on the chest and testicles of a mutilated bull at the Barton ranch. W. C. Levengood January 1997 lab work book: “The particles were non-magnetic. They were hard, resinous black particles rather easily broken into fragments when crushed with forceps. The matrix color of these fragments was a deep red with a fine graine amorphous structure. There were no cellular composites whatsoever. There was a slow dissolution in water. It was not highly soluble. In the early stages of hydration, two to three hours, an occasional cluster of blue colored tissue was found in isolated patches on the slide. After 24 hours, the slide had dehydrated and there was an excellent example of uninterrupted mud crack-type patterns formed around the edge of the slide.” D ehydrated fragment from black particles found on chest hide of mutilated bull discovered in Red Bluff, California, January 17, 1997. This photomicrograph (450x) show s uninterrupted “mud crack”-type patterns and no indication of cellular structures such as erythrocytes and leukocytes. Analytical chemistry analysis determined this is pure bovine hemoglobin. Photomicrograph © 2000 by W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist.

In contrast to the homogeneous pure bovine hemoglobin, this normal blood sample is not homogeneous and has a different “mud crack”-type pattern. Photomicrograph © 2000 by W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist. Interview: W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandio Biophysical Laboratory, Grass Lake, Michigan: “When I took a sample of normal blood and did the same thing, the mud cracks were far less extensive. They were ragged and they did not have the long path lengths of the ones in the bovine sample. What this means is that the liquid from the anomalous substance is very homogeneous. There were no cell particles to interrupt the forces that caused these so-called mud crack patterns. That being the case, I went back and thought about this finding of the blue particles. The one thing that crossed my mind here is, although it seemed very doubtful at the time, the only way I could see that these blue clusters could form at the center of all this red liquid was if this were actually pure hemoglobin and still active biochemically. The blue particles, what they indicate, if this is hemoglobin and it formed carboxy- hemoglobin, then this means that you would see this blue color because without oxygen hemoglobin has a blue color. The iron at the center of the hemoglobin molecule is changed from the ferrous to the ferric state. In hemoglobin, the ferrous state of iron is more stable than in the other iron compounds. The reason is that there is a residue on the hemoglobin molecule which prevents it from being reduced to the ferric form. Any loss or deactivation of this residue in the process of creating the compressed, black particles could explain the blue colored tissue regions. The homogeneity of the thing - the fact that erythrocytes and leukocytes are missing - somehow they had to be extracted from the blood of the animal in order to obtain the very homogeneous hemoglobin. To do this, you need to break down the cell membranes to the erythrocytes and leukocytes to remove the hemoglobin molecules. To do this, requires a laboratory procedure with very precise biochemical steps. It's totally incomprehensible how the hemoglobin could be removed in the middle of the night out in the middle of a pasture and separated from all the other cellular components. Then, you have to consider the fact that it was also now formed into a solid compact form which retained the biochemical activities of the molecule. In other words, in this process of dehydration - if heat was involved, it was a very gentle heating because it would have to be gentle in order to not heat the liquid up high enough to get actual degradation of the proteins. If it were high, you wouldn't have hemoglobin any more. Here you have two basic enigmas: how was it removed in the fresh state and remained biochemically active in a very pure form? And second, how was this formed into a solid that looks like a piece of old, black Bakelite - a very black, hard substance. I sent the particles to several laboratories. They took one look at this and said, 'This sure isn't hemoglobin because whoever heard of hemoglobin in a solid, black form?' They dismissed it. Then a couple of years ago, I began working with a retired analytical chemist in Ohio named Phyllis Budinger. She has the latest state-of-the-art infrared spectral photometer. So, I thought it would be an excellent idea if we sent some of these black particles to her and see what she could find. To my great interest and delight, she came up with the conclusion there was not much doubt that this material was pure hemoglobin, bovine hemoglobin. She wrote a report on this dated July 31, 2000 to me and she has shown the infrared curves and there is no doubt."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I nfrared spectroscopy: “Bull Residue- Testicles” on top; “Bull Residue-Side” in middle; known samples of pure bovine hemoglobin purchased from Sigma Aldrich for “Hemoglobin Reference” on bottom. Spectra provided by Phyllis A. Budinger, Analytical Chemist. Further, she got some blood from steak and examined the infrared characteristics of that and, of course, it was quite different with all the other chemical cell components such as erythrocytes and leukocytes in it that were entirely missing from the bull's blood. With that analysis, it was very conclusive that the dark material at the bovine excision sites was very anomalous. So, what this does in my estimation, it takes it out of the realm of the predators, takes it out of the realm of devil worshipers. THAT RAISES THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BREAK THE BLOOD FLUID IN A COW DOWN INTO HEMOGLOBIN IN THE FIELD? Oh, absolutely! This has to be an extremely sophisticated process. And remember, the molecules are completely dehydrated, but they are not destroyed and not injured. They are still active hemoglobin with all the other components removed. Yes, I have no idea how this was done. Further, the hypothesis that everyone has had, or the assumption, that the blood is removed I don't think it's removed at all. I think this sample gives us a very good clue that the blood is disintegrated, maybe to its very elemental material. If that is the case, the only thing that would be left to look at is the iron that is left over from the center of the hemoglobin molecule. I think if someone would examine the arterial wall with an EDS (energy dispersive spectroscopy) to get some idea of the amount of iron on the arterial wall of one of these bovine excision sites and then get one from a slaughterhouse, from a normal animal, then you might find a much higher iron level in the veins and arteries than ordinarily. And another thing I think is interesting is that we've got this information from a number of sites now - that when people take a compass with them, they find that when they are right over the animal, they get a very strong deviation from the normal north position. Then a couple of days later, the magnetic abnormality disappears What that suggests is that there is something magnetic for awhile in the animal. Now, how do you explain that? It is quite apparent from the black particles that probably a non-oxidizing, maybe even chemically reducing, atmosphere was present at whatever process was carried out to break the blood down and remove everything but the hemoglobin. In that case of total blood disintegration, in a possible non-oxygen atmosphere, the iron would end up in the reduced state which would be in the magnetite form. If it is a high deposit in the arteries and blood cells, that could cause the deflection of a magnet. Conversely, over time all the oxidizing compounds and liquids inside the animal could, in a matter of hours, oxidize the concentrated iron residue to the non-magnetic form of hematite. So, it would not be surprising if that change could explain the disappearance of the magnetic effect after a day or so.\" Analytical chemist Phyllis Budinger's analysis is described in Part 3 of this report.
