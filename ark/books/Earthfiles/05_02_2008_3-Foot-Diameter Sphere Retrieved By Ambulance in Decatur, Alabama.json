May 27, 2008 - Update Email “Subject: Re: Pearl Marks on Google Earth - I know what they are. Date: May 27, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com To Whom It May Concern: I worked for the company, Aerials Express, that produced the imagery with the so called “pearl marks” from 2002-2007. The aerial photographs were taken in the winter months, and when the negatives were scanned (on a cool morning back in our office in Phoenix) small drops of condensation had formed on the glass of the scanner. These drops were so small, they went un-detected by the operator. They were on the underside of the glass, and so appear to obscure the photograph. At one point, I remember the CEO, Bill Lands, joking about them because a program from the Discovery Channel had contacted him directly. He planned on releasing a PR piece with a picture of the scanner, and operator in an alien costume. He had a great sense of humor. Sorry to dispel the myth, just a bit of water under the scanner.” "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" May 3, 2008 Update: Today I received the following email from an Earthfiles viewer and Dreamland/Unknowncountry.com listener about two, 2005 Google map images of a pearl-like, unidentified object over Mangonia Park, Florida, near Palm Beach: S ubject: The Decatur ‘White Pearl’ - previous sighting Date: May 3, 2008 3:37:59 PM MDT To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “I read with much interest the story of the ‘white pearl.’ Over at Whitley's (Unknowncountry.com) - some time ago - there was a picture - I believe it was taken by Google Maps, during the aerial mapping process over Florida. The picture inadvertantly captured an almost similar (pearl-like) item in flight. There was some discussion as to altitude, but the concensus was that it appeared to be ‘vibrating’ in flight. I've attached 2 pictures that were posted at Whitley's, but I cannot give a date for the event.” I emailed Whitley Strieber, Unknowncountry.com co-producer with Anne Strieber and Dreamland host to ask about their website report. Whitley emailed back the original May 18, 2005, story with these comments: “Unfortunately, looking at the (current) Google maps, I think that they have been reshot, which happens on a schedule, so the objects are no longer visible by clicking on the Google map. If you read the sightseeing report, it makes reference to a number of other UFOs that were in the area at the time. You'd need to find out Google's mapping satellite schedule to determine if the UFOs have disappeared because of new images, or if they were airbrushed out.” “Google Map Mystery © May 18, 2005 www.unknowncountry.com M angonia Park, Florida, near Palm Beach.

The Google Maps satellite map of Mangonia Park, Florida, shows a clear view of an unusual object floating above 39th Street in the town. The shadow on the object is similar to the shadows on the ground, meaning that it is in the atmosphere relatively close to the surface, probably no higher than 20,000 feet. “There are no towers or unusual objects in the area that could account for the formation, which appears to be in rapid vibrational movement. Because of the unusual motion visible on its surface, it is not likely that this is a balloon. “Without knowing its distance from the ground, it is impossible to determine the size of the object, but it would seem to be quite large, even huge. “Calls to individuals living in the area and a search of news sources for 2005 revealed no reports of UFOs over Palm Beach or Magnolia Park this year. The"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"last National UFO Reporting Center report for Palm Beach was in 1999. “This is a confirmed unknown object in the air above a populated area in the United States, recorded sometime in 2005.” Source: Unknowncountry.com May 2, 2008 Decatur, Alabama - On Saturday, April 26, TV stations in Huntsville and Decatur, Alabama, broadcast news about dozens of people the night before on Friday, April 25, who called Decatur police and fire departments about strange lights in the Decatur sky around 11 PM. Strangest of all was what happened over on 8th Street at the Brookhaven Middle School’s Aquadome parking lot. Police cars and fire trucks on the ground and at least three military helicopters in the air were all concentrated on a single ambulance that had a stretcher outside its open doors. On the stretcher was a 3-foot- diameter sphere that looked like a glistening pearl. One of two teenage eyewitnesses who got close to the scene is 17-year-old Codey Terry, a student at Madison’s Bob Jones High School. He explains what led to his being so close to the sphere on the stretcher that he could see that ambulance light “sparkled like a diamond” on the sphere’s surface as if it were a large, round crystal. Interview: Codey Terry, 17-year-old student, Bob Jones High School, Madison, Alabama: “Friday afternoon (April 25, 2008) when I got out of school, my girlfriend and I hung out and went to see a movie. Then we went back to her house. I left her about 11 PM and was going back to Decatur to my grandma’s house to spend the night. I was also going to pick up my friend, Zack, to spend the night with me. So, I got into Decatur and had just gotten past the Courthouse and on to Central Parkway. I was going down that road for – I don’t know – maybe three minutes and I saw this bluish-white light coming through my windshield. I thought that was weird because I did not remember seeing the moon out – plus, it just happened so quick. So, I leaned forward and looked out my window and it looked like an airplane was coming straight down towards me. It looked like two, big headlights. So, I slammed on the brakes and my car started spinning out of control. There were no other cars and I got out and was looking in the sky. I was also on the phone with Zack and I was yelling at him to get under his bed, to take cover, because a plane was about to crash. Then, all of a sudden, whatever I was seeing, it just stopped in the middle of the air. And it never was making a sound. I don’t know if it changed shape, but it definitely got brighter. Those two lights that were on it changed to one huge, big, solid, complete circle of light and it was blinding bright. So, I held my hand up in front of my eyes looking through my hand and the light picked up speed and went straight to the ground. I never heard an explosion. I didn’t see anything. And that’s weird! At that time, my mom was calling me because she wanted me to go to the store and get some milk. I told her, ‘I can’t believe what I just saw!’ She said, ‘Well, don’t freak out because on the news they were saying something about strange lights over Decatur.’ So, I get off the phone with my mom and I turned on to 8th Street, which is where it happened. 8th Street and Aquadome All of a sudden, a few fire trucks and ambulances and cops pass me, running through the red lights as quick as they can. That was weird, too! I figured they were going to whatever I had seen. So, I got to my friend’s house and told Zack. Then, (Codey makes sound of helicopter blades whopping) there was the sound of helicopters coming from everywhere. Zack and I go outside and I know for sure we saw one helicopter. But to me, it looked like there were two more beside it (total three) all black. We jumped in the car and hurried down there and by the time we got to the Aquadome, the helicopters had already landed. The fire trucks were in the middle of the road, so we parked in a driveway and jumped a fence. We were sitting there watching from beside an apartment that was so close, I was within fifteen feet of the action. A helicopter was on the ground in the Aquadome parking lot and it was a Med Fly helicopter (from Huntsville, not Decatur). There were at least two more helicopters in the air."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"WHERE IT CAME DOWN, WHAT IS THERE? That is a middle school, but where they picked up the sphere is a recreational center with a swimming pool and play ground and basketball courts. WHAT IS THAT SCHOOL CALLED? Brookhaven Middle School. WHERE WERE YOU SEEING THE AMBULANCE ON THE BROOKHAVEN MIDDLE SCHOOL LAND? Brookhaven is right next door to the Aquadome. They were on the Aquadome's back parking lot. Fire Trucks Circled Aquadome Parking Lot SO, FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW, WHERE THE AMBULANCE CAME ON THAT PARKING LOT IS WHERE THE SPHERE SOMEHOW ENDED UP? Right, and what was weird about it is that I sat there and watched the fire trucks pull up. Well, some of the fire trucks went straight and some took a right. They all came in the same way, but they branched out like they were circling – like the way the fire trucks went in, there is no road. They went down a gravel walking trail to the playground. The fire trucks were circling like in a blockade, do you know what I mean? BUT THE FIRE TRUCKS CIRCLED, THE HELICOPTERS CIRCLED. DID THE POLICE CARS CIRCLE AS WELL? They were in front of everything. I never saw which way they went, but it seemed like they branched off – like I didn’t even see them pull up and park. And then after we parked our car and came back, the police were there. ALL OF THE HELICOPTERS OR SOME CAME FROM HUNTSVILLE (20 miles east of Decatur)? All of them. YOU KNOW THAT BECAUSE? I saw them fly from that direction. And I know there is no military base in Decatur. Not only that, there is one hospital in Decatur and it’s called Decatur General and it has a Med Flight on top of it. But what’s weird is that the Med Flight helicopter did not come from that hospital. It did not come from that direction and it did not have Decatur Med Flight on it. IT DID NOT HAVE DECATUR MED FLIGHT WRITTEN ON IT. Right. DID IT HAVE ANY WRITING ON IT? I remember seeing Med Flight on it, but I don’t remember numbers and I’m pretty sure it was Huntsville. But I do know what the Decatur Med Flight looks like and that was not it. WHAT ABOUT THE POLICE, FIRE AND ALL OF THAT? They were all from Decatur. White, Shiny Sphere On Stretcher Was 3-Foot-Diameter There was also an ambulance and the back of it was facing the road and a stretcher behind the ambulance. I made sure to look at that stretcher because I knew at that point it was either going to be something that I saw in the air; or it was going to be somebody who got hurt. On the Med Flight stretcher, the best I can describe it is a giant pearl - a shiny, white"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"sphere. It looked like the color of a diamond and a pearl – I mean, it was really bright, reflected light. Two guys were there looking like they were dusting on it or doing something. S pherical white pearl jewel. The two men put sheets over the sphere, they stuck it in the back of the ambulance and the helicopter took off. What’s weird is that the ambulance and fire trucks were from Decatur. I recognized the fire truck because it’s the fire truck that’s down from my grandma’s house. And it went towards Huntsville, too. It went completely the other direction. That was kind of weird! The whole thing is weird, but that is especially so because it lets you know that something is up. WHAT WAS THE DIAMETER OF THE VERY SHINY SPHERE? It was small enough to fit on the stretcher. WHAT SIZE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT – 3 OR 4 FEET IN DIAMETER? I’d say three to four feet. OK, SO THERE IS A HOSPITAL STRETCHER AND ON IT IS AN APPROXIMATE 3-FOOT-DIAMETER PERFECT SPHERE. WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE SURFACE OF THE SPHERE WAS LIKE A MIRROR? Sort of. You know when you look at a pearl, it looked like that. But when the light hit it, it reflected off like a diamond does. SO IT WAS SORT OF WHITE . Correct. BUT WHAT LIGHT REFLECTED LIKE A DIAMOND? Just the light out of the ambulance – you know, when they have the doors open and there was that light. THEY OPENED UP THE AMBULANCE DOORS AND LIGHT CAME ON IT AND THEN YOU SAW IT SPARKLE LIKE A DIAMOND? Right. It looked sort of like a crystal. THE PEOPLE WHO WERE AROUND THE SPHERE – HOW WERE THEY ACTING IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE SPHERE? I don’t think any of the people there, besides the two men, saw the sphere. When all this happened, my friend, Zack, went and asked a woman there what happened. And she did not have a clue. She was like the closest one up there and she said, ‘I don’t know. They would not tell us anything.’ And a news reporter guy walked around door-to-door to ask residents, but nobody had seen the sphere. So, it was just me and my friend and he won’t say anything to anybody. He’s too nervous. DID YOU FEEL THAT ALL THE PEOPLE COMING TO THE AREA WERE TREATING THE SPHERE WITH DISTANCE AS IF AFRAID OF IT? I would say the distance, yes. Afraid, I can’t say that. For me, sort of. But when the two guys were in the back dusting the sphere off, they looked like they knew what they were doing. BUT SOMEBODY HAD TO GET THE SPHERE AND PUT IT ON THE STRETCHER?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I believe that was either the military or the cops, whoever got there first. White Contamination-Protection Suits On Two Men “Dusting Off” Sphere WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT YOU NEVER GOT TO SEE THE POLICEMENT OR MED TECHS OR ANYBODY INTERACTING WITH THE SPHERE? I don’t know who the two guys were (with the sphere). They worked for the city or government or military – whoever they were. They had on white suits, but they didn’t have on gas masks, I don’t think. LIKE YOU WOULD USE IF THERE WAS CONTAMINATION AND YOU MIGHT PUT ON BIOHAZARD OR RADIOACTIVE PROTECTION SUITS? Something like that. They didn’t have any gas masks, you know? They just had on these real long white suits all the way down to their feet. It looked to me like they were dusting the sphere. The only thing I can think of is that it was some kind of machine dusting dirt off the sphere. WHAT WERE THE TWO MEN DUSTING THE SPHERE WITH? I couldn’t tell. It did not look like a regular hand-held broom, but it didn’t look like anything too high tech. DID YOU SEE EITHER OF THE MEN IN THE WHITE PROTECTIVE SUITS EXTEND THEIR HANDS, OR GLOVED HANDS, ONTO THE SPHERE? No, I didn’t see them touch it, but I did see them rub it with whatever they were rubbing it with. And when they threw sheets on it, they never touched it. They threw the sheets over it without touching it and then wrapped it up and tucked in the sheet. THEY DIDN’T TOUCH THE SPHERE, BUT YOU ARE SAYING THEY MADE SURE THE SHEET WAS TIGHTLY HOLDING DOWN THE SPHERE? Correct. THEN, DID THOSE TWO MEN ON EITHER SIDE PICK UP THE STRETCHER WITH THE SPHERE ON IT AND PUT IT IN THE AMBULANCE? Yes, they picked up the stretcher and stuck it in the ambulance. DID THEY DO THAT EASILY AS IF THE SPHERE WERE LIGHT? OR DID THEY LOOK LIKE THEY WERE STRAINING AND THAT IT WAS HEAVY? Well, when they went to pick it up, another guy came to help them pick it up. So, I imagine it was too heavy for two men to pick it up, but not too heavy for three guys to carry. Was Sphere Taken by Ambulance to Huntsville, Alabama? THEN WHAT HAPPENED? They backed out and the ambulance and two fire trucks went toward Huntsville, in the direction there. They would either be going to the hospital or to Huntsville. But one of those fire trucks is based right down the street from where my grandma’s house is and that's the opposite direction of where it went toward Huntsville. And this whole thing, from the time I saw it in the air to the time they put it (in the ambulance) and left, was 20 minutes at the most. By then, it was 11:35 or 11:40 PM (Friday, April 25, 2008), getting close to midnight. So, whatever that sphere was, the military had to be tracking it on radar because nobody saw it crash and there were no crash marks on the ground. And there was no sound because I was there. So, no citizen knew about it. There is a military base right down the highway toward Huntsville (Redstone Army Arsenal). The sphere could have been something from the military. It could have been like a new top secret drone thing for a spy plane they don’t want us knowing about that got off course."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Whatever it was, they had to be tracking it on radar.

But there has been another development. A girl I know is supposed to have a videotape of whatever was in the air. Supposedly she was at her girlfriend’s house and videotaped the bright light stopping in the air and then going to the ground. She is scared someone is going to come and mess with her or take her away if she shows it to the public. [ Earthfiles will report more when available.] Military Top Secret Project? Or Non-Human Technology? WHAT IS YOUR REACTION TO THE IDEA THAT THERE MIGHT BE OTHER INTELLIGENT LIFE FORMS IN THE UNIVERSE COMING AND GOING ON EARTH? I think that’s awesome. YOU’RE NOT AFRAID OF IT AT ALL? No. I really want to know what it is. CAN YOU CONTACT ANY OF THE DECATUR POLICE OR FIREMEN AND ASK WHAT THE SPHERE WAS? I already have. WHAT DID THEY SAY? Well, that night, we called the cops. A dispatcher said they had been getting a bunch of calls. He did not have a clue what was going on. He just said that something major had happened.
