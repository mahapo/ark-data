Along Highway 259 near Smithville on Saturday, October 10, 2009, they found a deer with bloodless excisions from its rear. October 15, 2009 Mena, Arkansas - On October 13, 2009, I received the following email and two attached photographs from Howard Goins, a Mena, Arkansas, resident who frequently travels with his sister a few miles west into Smithville, Oklahoma, to care for their old family homestead. On Saturday morning, October 10, 2009, they discovered a deer lying along Highway 259 near Smithville. The deer looked like it should get up and run away, its body was so fresh and perfect - except for the bloodless, round excision of the deer's rectum. Upon examination, Howard Goins said the head and front of the deer's body appeared completely untouched. Since, they did not see the deer there near the highway exit the night before, their assumption is that the deer was perhaps killed during the early morning hours of Saturday. Subject: Mutilated Deer, Smithville, Oklahoma Date: October 13, 2009 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Reprinted with permission “ Hello, Linda, I live in Mena, Arkansas, just south of Eureka Springs. My sister owns our old family home in the small town Smithville, Oklahoma. It is pretty far out in the wilderness so-to-speak in SE Oklahoma. The house is along side Hwy 259. The place has about 1100 feet of highway frontage. We keep the right-of-way mowed and manicured. The first thing I do when I arrive there is to check to see how much trash I have to pick up. This last Friday evening, October 9th, my sister and I were to meet there. No one lives in the house except on holidays and long weekends. When I arrived that evening, I saw nothing along side the road that needed to "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"be picked up. The next morning, Saturday, October 10th, I got up and proceeded to mow the lawn and was about half through when the belt broke on the mower. We decided to drive back to Mena and get a new belt so we could finish the job. Driving back to Smithville, as we drove south on Hwy 259, just about 200 feet down the right-of-way, there was a deer laying there. We thought it might have been hit by a vehicle. I am attaching two photos to show that the animal had not been hit, but looked to be in very good health when it was alive and appeared to have had a fawn. But the noticeable thing was the missing anus. I forgot about it on Saturday evening, but woke up on Sunday, October 11, at about 4:30 AM thinking about it and finally got up at 5 AM and drove down to where the deer was. I looked specifically at the hole where the deer's anus should have been and it appeared to have been cut in straight lines around the anus without blood. However, after waiting until daylight when I took the photos, the opening appeared to have been tampered with, which I am thinking crows, for there were some in the vicinity. My photos don't have the straight line cuts like I saw at 5 AM. The animal could not have been there for more than 6 hours on Saturday when we first saw it and it definitely was not there Friday night because my sister arrived after midnight and she didn't see it then. I wanted to share the information with you, and perhaps add it to statistics if your keeping them and to see if you think this was alien-related? I cannot imagine anyone doing such a thing where most of the people in the area are hunters and certainly would not waste as nice an animal as she was for just a rectum.

Or was vaginal tissue removed as well? The dead deer was first discovered on Saturday, October 10, 2009. Both images were taken after sunup on Sunday, October 11, 2009, by Howard Goins.
