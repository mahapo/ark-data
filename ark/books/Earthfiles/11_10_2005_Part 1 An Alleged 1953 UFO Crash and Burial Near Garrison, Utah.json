Follow the red arrow in the map below from Kingman to the yellow marked location two hundred miles straight north. The yellow marks a dry lakebed east of Fishlake National Forest which the U. S. government photographed in a grid pattern on June 11, 1953. R ed arrow points 200 miles straight north from Kingman, Arizona, to the yellow-colored DRES facility near alleged lakebed crash site, perhaps in May 1953. Two dozen high altitude photographs were taken in a grid pattern of a large triangular feature in the dry lakebed near a government facility known as the Desert Research Experimental Station, or D.R.E.S. The triangle measured approximately 4,400 feet long and 2,700 feet wide. The measurements are from a 1999 geologist's analytical report. \"M 14 AMS 11 June 53 126.\" Aerial photograph taken on June 11, 1953, one of two dozen all focused on the region of the triangle feature which measures 4,400 feet long by 2,700 feet wide. The location of this unusual triangle feature is 175 miles south of the highly classified Dugway Proving Grounds. At least one former United States Air Force pilot says he has firsthand knowledge that a large aerial vehicle \" not from this world\" impacted in 1953 where "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the triangle was dug to bury the craft - and perhaps to provide a permanent marker in the lakebed for unknown purposes.

S. government history about the site, range lands during the severe drought years of the 1930s had deteriorated, affecting survival of livestock and ranchers. No one knew how to manage desert plants, so the Desert Experimental Range was created to learn. D ry, cracked lakebed inside triangle near DRES on July 17, 2005.

Two and a half decades later on October 26, 1976, the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization formally dedicated the Desert Experimental Range as part of the \"international network of biosphere reserves. This network of protected samples of the world's major ecosystem types is devoted to conservation of nature and scientific research in the service of man. It provides a standard which the effect of man's impact on his environment can be measured.\" Ordered by Amadon-Mahtai M'Bow, Director General of UNESCO on October 26, 1976, under the decision of the Bureau of the International Coordinating Council of the \"Program On Man and the Biosphere.\" Exactly why this occurred and what the legal implications are in making DRES a U. N. biosphere are still not clear."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"U nited Nations Biosphere Reserve Designation for DRES by UNESCO on October 26, 1976.

Today in 2005 from the outside, the DRES facility looks run down with paint peeling badly on all the buildings. But a strange juxtaposition to all the peeling paint and boarded up windows are new padlocks and many new doors with brand new solid locks. [ Editor's Note: Stan Kitchen, current manager of the DRES installation since 1999, says he has been forced to put on new doors and locks because vandals have broken into the facility. But he has no knowledge about the triangular feature in the lakebed. ] W eed-filled circular driveway ringed by deteriorating DRES buildings and empty flagpole.
