The bright object was moving northeast away from the camera. Photograph © 2002 by ASEPI member, Jean L. from Saint-Jean-de-Matha, Quebec, Canada. November 3, 2002 Montreal, Canada - The Association for the Study of Strange and Unexplained Phenomena (ASEPI) in Montreal recently contacted me about their experimental efforts to electronically detect and photograph unidentified aerial objects. ASEPI (Association Sciences de l'Etrange & Phenomenes Inexpliques) is a non-profit organization focused on the study of haunted places, esoteric and paranormal events and unidentified flying objects. Louis Yaksa wrote on October 29: \"We decided to investigate the UFO phenomenon by creating a network of computerized UFO detectors. We are currently experimenting with magnetic, gravity and microwave detectors. We are getting results from our magnetic and microwave detectors. Every time we hear of an observation report, we check our computer files for any detection. We have several computers recording 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, minute by minute. This research is highly experimental. We do not know if it will detect anything, but it seems to work! We detected and photographed one!! On August 20, 2002 at approximately 21:08 EDT (9:08 p.m. EDT), our member Jean L. and his wife, Lina, in Saint-Jean-de-Matha, Quebec, got an alarm on their computer from their magnetic detector. Jean grabbed his camera and ran outside and took the picture attached. They saw a white sphere, reddish on the bottom, which passed over their house heading northeast. The sky was clear and the moon was visible behind. When the object was above the mountains, it changed direction. The observation lasted between 3 and 4 minutes. The camera used was a PRAKTICA, Aperture:2.8. Time exposure: 1/60 second, Film used: ISO 400. Distance of camera from object: we estimate the object at approximately one kilometer and at 20 to 30 "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"degrees angle above the ground and camera. Here is the one picture & the computer graph. These are 3 scans of the original negative (only one photograph taken) at different contrast levels. At the moment this picture was taken, Jean L. and Lina only saw one bright sphere. We noticed the (detail of) three spheres in UFO-C.jpeg below ONLY after print enhancements. Picture UFO- B is the original print from the 35mm negative, printed by a professional photographer at a photo centre. Picture UFO- A was printed at density (-7) pale from the 35mm negative. Picture UFO- C was printed at density (+7) dark from the 35mm negative, which shows a triplicate of spheres.
