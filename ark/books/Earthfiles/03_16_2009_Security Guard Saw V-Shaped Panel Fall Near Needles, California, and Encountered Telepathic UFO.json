U pdated March 16 of original report March 14, 2009 Perris, California - A year ago on May 14, 2008, at 3 AM Pacific south of Needles, California, on the Colorado River near Topock, Arizona, a long-time houseboat resident calling himself River Bob was stunned to see a large, bright “fiery object” hurtling from the sky toward him. From the upper deck on his houseboat, he was puzzled by the vivid turquoise blue-green amid other more fiery red, yellow and orange colors. Despite the strange blue-green color, River Bob thought perhaps he was watching a plane about to crash. Whatever hit the ground was picked up within fifteen minutes by a large sky crane helicopter and carried away. What River Bob did not know was that 200 miles west of Needles in Perris, California, near Riverside, a night security guard was also watching a bright object flash through the sky with an odd blue-green color. He thought it might be the break up of a satellite or space vehicle because amid the colorful sparks, he could see the dark silhouette of a diamond-shaped object like the side of a nose cone. The security guard has asked me to call him “Shark.” On May 14, 2008, he was on his night security duty in Perris. I talked with him this week about what he saw that early morning headed towards the Needles, California, region and what happened four months later in August that convinced Shark that there are vehicles above Earth that can respond to human thought. First, the Needles object. N eedles, California, is the larger red circle; Topock, Arizona, is the smaller red circle.

Interview: “Shark,” Security Guard, Perris, California: “I noticed a bright object streaking across the sky. Amongst these sparks were heavier objects falling and catching the atmosphere and trailing away rather rapidly towards the ground, while the lighter sparking material was staying in an aligned, arcing formation trailing behind this object. COLORS? Colors near the back edge of the object were more bright orange, some blue and a unique teal color (blue-green), as if some type of unique metallic material was burning. T eal. The majority of the sparks trailing behind were lighter in bright white and some yellow trailing for many miles behind it. But as this thing arced toward the Needles, California, area, what I saw appeared to be some type of panel that had come loose and fluttered about in the trail of sparks, catching air and de-accelerating more rapidly than the minute objects behind it. The panel was large enough that as it sputtered in the sky, it blacked out the lighter objects behind it. Then the panel fell away rather rapidly. IN ADDITION TO THE UNUSUAL TEAL COLOR, YOU SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE AN OBJECT LARGE ENOUGH TO BE SILHOUETTED AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF THE BRIGHT, FALLING OBJECTS AND THIS WAS WHAT SHAPE? The falling black silhouette appeared to have a sort of V shape like some kind of side panel or nose cone. I couldn’t tell for sure what it was because it was too far away and too high, but it fluttered as it caught air and blacked out the lighted, spark objects behind it.

It appeared to be somewhat V-shaped, like it was part of a nose cone or capsule, but it was some type of panel, big enough to black out the lighted objects. DID YOU THEN DECIDE THAT WHAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT WAS SOMETHING STRUCTURED AND NOT A METEORITE COMING DOWN OUT OF"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"THE SKY? At first, I thought it might be a meteorite. But as it went by dropping heavier objects and had the unique colors to it and then this panel-type material came off of it and blacked out the light. I thought it was more than a meteorite – that it was some type of spacecraft debris. DID YOU CALL THE FIRE OR POLICE DEPARTMENT OR ANYBODY TO REPORT THIS? No, I didn’t. IS THERE ANY REASON WHY YOU DIDN’T CALL AUTHORITIES? Well, I thought it was space debris coming down and there would be no life form on it and it was probably maybe a busted up satellite re-entering and someone would be tracking it and find it. It wasn’t until the next night on the radio that I heard that other people around the Needles area saw something rather unique. Then I started putting it together that this was probably the same object. And people were being kind of discrete about their identities.

HE REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT IN WHICH HE COULD SEE A BRIGHT TURQUOISE COLOR CAME DOWN AND HIT THE GROUND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COLORADO RIVER SO HARD THAT HE SAW IT BOUNCE UP A LITTLE BEFORE IT FELL BACK DOWN.

Wilson Observatory in Los Angeles, California. Image source: Erickson Air-Crane, Inc. Right. I heard that report and I was pretty convinced the thing was being tracked. Somebody knew this was an incoming object and they were ready for it at that particular location (where it impacted near River Bob). They hustled out there and evidently picked it up. But with the secrecy around River Bob and others such as the radio station and other reports, I just decided to keep quiet because it sounded like they found most of it. But since the intensity of the investigation seems to have died down and what I ran into later with the UFO phenomenon prompted me to go forward with what I have about the panel part. There might be other parts out there at different locations. AM I THE VERY FIRST PERSON YOU HAVE TOLD ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW? Other than my brother and wife, I have not spoken to any other persons or media about this. August 2008, Perris, California - “Telepathic UFO”"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"P erris, California, is a Riverside suburb of about 46,000 residents southw est of the Mari ne Corps Ai r Ground Combat Center. YOU MENTIONED THAT AFTER MAY 2008, YOU HAD OTHER UFO SIGHTINGS THAT HAVE HAUNTED YOU. WHAT HAPPENED? Well, it was three months later after the May 14, 2008, incident in Needles, in the middle of August 2008, out here in Perris, California, that I was trying to observe the stars, which I do on occasion during my security guard night shift. It was about 2:20 AM. I have heard about night vision binoculars. I don’t have a pair. I have a pair of regular binoculars. I tried using my binoculars, but I just could not hold my hand steady enough to look at the stars and keep them steady. So, I put my binoculars away. Then what I do is just observe with my eyes unaided the night sky. I observe by picking out a particular lighted object that I believe could be in Earth-orbit range orbit out to 500 miles or so. Then I pick a star that is near it to use as a larger focal point to discern any movement on the closer object. I’m not looking around the whole sky. I’m concentrating on one, little, lit, faint object that I believe is in near-Earth orbit. I was doing that one night in the middle of August 2008, when there was this faint, lit object I focused on with a star right above it way out in the distance, but a bright star. I was thinking to myself that it would be nice to see a UFO one night. Within a few seconds of thinking that, this object moved from the 6 o’clock position below the star, arced to the right and up to the 5 o’clock position and stopped. The light that moved from the 6 o’clock to 5 o’clock position was lit the whole time. And I was thinking to myself, ‘Well, that is unique. That could be a UFO.’ It did not move much, but there might be something going on there. Then I thought if there would be more movement, I would be more convinced that this truly was a UFO. And right about that point, it arced up in a counter-clockwise motion in a perfect circle, went all the way up above the star and around in one solid motion. Then the light came back down to the 6 o’clock position. I said, ‘Well, that definitely looks like a UFO. I don’t know what more I can ask of it. I don’t know if it’s going to do anything else. I’ll watch it for another minute or two. Which I did and at that point, it did not move anymore. I didn’t hope that it would move anymore. I was just watching it, expecting it to maybe do something. But it didn’t.

Illustration © 2009 by Shark. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT HOW THE SPACE OBJECT COULD HAVE ISOLATED YOUR SPECIFIC THOUGHTS TO REACT TO? I’m not sure how it’s done. I know other people try to take photographs of space objects and the objects disappear or blink out. It’s like they are reading your mind. They are teasing you, playing with you. Their technology, their understanding of the communication of picking up the thoughts of somebody looking at them – I don’t know how they would do that! This is just way beyond my understanding. 2:23 AM , Large Rectangular Craft Emerges Silently from Cloud Bank I then turned and walked to my security vehicle, which was a pickup truck about ten feet from me. I rested my arms across the tailgate and I was facing south. About three-quarters of a mile away at about 1,500 feet altitude, there was a bank of clouds and beyond the edge were more clouds, all at about 1,500 feet going across the terrain. I decided to watch the clouds and see if they were moving to the east because if they were, that might mean cooler temperatures for us in California because this was a hot time of August days and nights out here. I was watching the clouds for about two minutes and I could not see them moving. They were just stationary. If there was any movement at all, I could not tell. But what I did notice was something coming out from the top of the clouds, slightly to my right and at the top of the clouds like the object was sitting up there. This object was elongated and was dark and black, but it had amber to orange color along its side edges and bottom edges mostly. The strong edges where points seemed to come together were holding the amber to orange glowing colors. The object continued up from above the clouds and not moving very fast. I estimate the speed to have been between 20 and 30 miles per hour, not fast enough for sustained flight of most aircraft. It had no wings on it. It was kind of shoe box style, but gem cut with facets across the top was flat and down the length of it on top and bottom was flat. But from the top on each side to the center was about a 15-degree angle. From the center to the bottom of the aircraft was another 15-degree angle. HOW LONG AND WIDE DO YOU THINK THIS THING WAS? The length was approximately 65 to 100 feet long and 15 to 20 feet wide and 10 to 12 feet high. M id-August 2008, 2:23 AM, only three minutes after the first UFO seemed to respond to Shark's thoughts, a large rectangular aircraft with glowing orange light dimly illuminating gem-like facets, emerged from cloud bank. Estimated length = 65 to 100 feet; width = 15 to 20 feet; height = 10 to 12 feet.

IS THERE REFLECTED MOONLIGHT? IS IT GLOWING? IS THERE SOMETHING EMANATING FROM THE CRAFT? HOW ARE YOU SEEING THIS? Well, behind me towards where the first lighted object in space was, there was a moon out in that area. That moon was about 40% lit. On top of the unidentified craft was some reflected moonlight highlighting the silhouetted edges and top of the craft, all of which appeared to be a flat black type of color with maybe some type of diamond pattern on it where the moonlight was catching some of the material, kind of like ripples on a lake at night. The bottom of it showed more of the orange trim along some of its leading edges. WAS THIS LIGHT OR SOMETHING ELSE? It appeared to be orange light because there was nothing in the area that could illuminate it at that altitude and just on those edges. And this thing was still at 1,500 feet and it was coming out from above the clouds with lighted edges on it of amber to orange, a little darker orange. S hark's illustration of orange light outlines and possible sparkling “diamond” pattern on top. Graphic © 2009 by Shark. DID YOU MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD SEE SOME KIND OF DIAMOND PATTERN ETCHED INTO THE TOP? You can’t really tell for sure if it’s a diamond pattern or not, but I’m assuming it’s some type of special pattern because the moonlight that was hitting it was not constant. As the craft pulled out from above the clouds, it immediately began pitching downward at about 10 to 15 degrees. The front of this craft became more prominent where from the top to the center front and from the bottom to the center front, it was chisel-shaped."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Then what I could see as it angled downward in the front is that the back end was coming up and where the top of the back was and where the sides of the craft ended also appeared that it would be chisel-shaped in the rear, the same as in the rear. As far as the orange goes, the orange trim also appeared on some of the top side-leading edges, too. But as this thing came closer and closer away from the clouds where it should be picking up more visible ambient light from the moon and ground, it seemed to be getting darker. The orange trim seemed to be disappearing more and more. It was not very prominent in the beginning and now what was outlining the craft was sort of disappearing. Cloaking Technology? WHAT DID YOU THINK AT THAT MOMENT? I thought it was trying to cloak itself, trying to be more invisible. It was above the clouds before and would then have been totally invisible to people on the ground, but now that it was leaving the cloud bank area and coming out over open terrain with highways and roads, it was doing something to hide itself. As it came out from that cloud bank coming in my direction at probably 20 to 30 mph, it was pitching forward and descending at the same time. I thought, ‘This is great, I’m going to get a good look at this.’ It kept coming forward and forward. At no time did I hear any sound from it and that made it rather eerie. And as it approached and was descending, it got down to about 300 feet from me, was on the other side of a highway. It was about 800 feet or so in altitude and it was leveling out. As far as sound goes then, I still could hear no sound. I would say that either this had anti-gravity capabilities or it had lighter-than-air-gas in part of its structure. This thing continued descending until it got to about 800 feet and then it leveled out at that point about 300 feet from me. It was still moving towards me and it was at that point that I thought, ‘This is going to be darn near right over me or right next to me and I don’t want to be directly under it.’ Shark Backs Up to Building for Protection I decided to back up next to a building that I was at and just keep my back up against the building and kind of be out of a lighted area and observe it from that point. So, I backed up against the building and looked up again when this thing should have been right over me, or nearly over me slightly to my right, and I could not pick it out from the sky no more. I don’t know what happened to it. It had either disappeared or had fully cloaked itself and was right there. At that point, I just felt an eerie sense. I was not sure of its intentions and I decided I had better be a little bit safer and I went and got into my vehicle. SHARK, WHY DO YOU THINK YOU FELT FEAR? Well, this was obviously trying to disguise itself, so I didn’t know what the intentions were. But I also thought at the same time that for me to be able to see two unique UFO oddities in one evening within a couple of minutes apart. Some kind of communication was happening that potentially went from my viewing and thoughts to the UFO in space to this object, which appeared less than three-quarters of a mile away and then comes towards me. There’s something going on here. It might cooperation and technologies for communications and guidance, or a whole lot of other things. But I had had just about enough of the UFOs for that night! And yes, mentally I was thinking it looked like a UFO, but to make me 100% convinced, I’d like to see this thing really move, you know, and do something. Right at that point, it continued on counter-clockwise and went right back to that 6 o’clock position making a perfect circle around that distant star that I was focusing on for a center point. WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE AFRAID OF THE FACETED OBJECT IF YOU HAD JUST HAD A POSITIVE, TELEPATHIC CONNECTION TO WHATEVER THE LIGHTED OBJECT WAS THAT DID THE 360-DEGREE-LOOP FOR YOU?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Well, from the time I saw that object in the 6 o’clock position in space to the time I saw the object above the clouds was only two minutes. For this to happen, I felt there was definitely some kind of communication going on from the space object to the other faceted craft, but what the other faceted craft’s intentions were, I still did not know. Just because one object is cooperating with me in some far distant way did not mean to me that it was still safe to be interfacing with the larger object, which was now hundreds of miles closer in my atmosphere and above my head. BUT I STILL WONDER WHAT YOU WERE AFRAID OF? Well, I was afraid of its intentions because it’s there and acting stealthy and a black color with the stealthy orange outlines kind of makes that pretty unusual. The flight characteristics of this was unlike anything we’ve had other than maybe a blimp. But there were no engine sounds, so this was truly a unique and different power source. Where that object is truly from, who is operating it, what their intentions are – I still do not know. Technologies Not From Earth? IF FOR A FACT YOU KNEW IT WAS FROM SOME OTHER PLACE, NOT THIS EARTH, WHAT WOULD YOUR COMMENT BE IF YOU HAD THAT KNOWLEDGE? I would want to know why it was here and what its intentions are. But I was in no position and didn’t know where to go with it from there. This is like in your back yard - OK, now what do you do with it? WHAT THOUGHTS HAVE YOU HAD SINCE AUGUST 2008 ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCES ARE OPERATING IN OUR SKIES ON EARTH IN KIND OF STEALTHY MANNERS? Well, I think these non-human intelligences are probably there. I think they are probably communicating with government military sources and are probably cooperating to some extent in the development of new technologies. ARE WE ALONE IN THIS UNIVERSE? AND IF NOT, WHAT DO THE INTELLIGENCES COMING TO EARTH WANT? Well, I don’t believe we’re alone in the universe. There has been too much happening, not just from my sighting, but from your work and other peoples’ work – there have been other objects filmed out in space that are pretty unique and unlike anything we have seen before.” I f anyone has more information or images of such changing aerial patterns, please email: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
