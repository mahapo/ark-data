Return to Part 1 December 29, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Chapter 8, Meat Market, continued. ill Smith was never sure if an Alien was standing in one of the dark corners in the room, just out of sight, waiting to come to the rescue if Bill or one of the committee members botched up a procedure. He had that strange feeling many times, especially when he was doing something that he knew was out of his league - yet succeeded as if he were a master at it. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Tim, who had volunteered to go through the out-of-body procedure, was asked to lie down on the surgical table next to the body that he picked from the five that were available. As the process began, Bill (who was doing the procedure) felt the sensation that time slowed down. At first he thought he was having a panic attack and was going to pass out. He had the sick feeling that one gets when subjecting a friend or family member to mortal danger. Bill was responsible for initiating something that only he, out of the four present, “supposedly” knew how to perform. Then, in the blink of an eye and to his relief, Bill saw the same two Aliens that brought him back days earlier. The Aliens appeared seemingly from nowhere. The beings quickly immobilized all of Bill's colleagues and performed the procedure on Tim. Bill was allowed to watch the whole thing, although he was in a semi-conscious state. The event lasted two or three minutes and then the Aliens disappeared as quickly as they came. Bill f ound himself standing in the same place were he was before the Aliens played interference for him. He was back to normal, composed and no signs of the stress he had moments earlier. His colleagues were not aware of what had happened, although the scientists were impressed that the procedure was done so effortlessly and congratulated Bill on his miraculous abilities. Tim was in his new body and walking around the room. He could not believe that it actually happened! Tim went to his old body and marveled at it. He “yelled” in disbelief as he looked at his old body and kept saying, “Is that what I REALLY look like?!” His excitement overwhelmed him and he passed out. No sooner than Tim was revived, he again worked himself up and fainted again. After the second time, the scientists decided to let Tim come out of it on his own, which he did after five minutes. During that time, Bill Smith asked his colleagues if they saw anything out of the ordinary? Did they feel anything different? The scientists responded with a negative. All three of them remembered watching Bill as he performed with the precision of a machine. The other men told Bill how impressed they were with the level of expertise he achieved from working with the Aliens. The men expressed admiration for Bill's know-how, but they also recognized that B ill's abilities were gifts from the Aliens. “ They had to be,” the scientists told Bill. His colleagues did not hide the fact that they, as well as others in the committee, were envious of Bill and still wanted to know why they were excluded from contact with the Aliens. Bill told his colleagues that he could not answer that question for them. Then he told them that he was not the one who performed “like a machine” and that whatever the others had witnessed, it was not him, Bill Smith. The scientists argued with Bill and swore that they saw with their own eyes that he and he alone worked at the table, although they acknowledged that being inside the Alien ship could easily fool the human mind. B ill told his colleagues that what they had witnessed was a vision. B ill said he was not even at the table when the actual procedure took place and neither were the other scientists! The Aliens had paralyzed them and moved them out of the way as one would move chairs away from a table in order to sweep under it. As a matter of fact, all three of the other scientists were put into one corner of the room facing away from the surgical table altogether. The men looked like mannequins bunched in the corner. Bill told them that he was allowed to watch, but the Aliens did not communicate with him. The Aliens did the job, moved the co mmittee members back to the spot they had occupied around the table and then left. Bill figured that the Aliens let him watch so that he would know what really goes on when the going gets tough. Though B ill was a super nice g uy, his ab ilities combined with the privileges that were given to him, made Bill feel a little superior to other humans. That's why the Aliens brought him down a few notches."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Tim told Bill and the others that he was able to read their minds. He knew what they had been talking about while he was unconscious, but thought he was dreaming. They determined after some testing that extrasensory perception (ESP) was enhanced when the soul is detached from its body. Apparently, when in a host body, the consciousness remained detached enough from the host body that their soul - or the essence of what the person's consciousness is - was free to roam the “psychic air waves.” The success that Tim had and the knowledge that the Aliens were keeping an eye on them gave the other three scientists the courage to jump out of their bodies and test the waters. The group experimented with four of the bodies. Since Bill was the only one with some knowledge of the procedure, he remained in his own body. The co mmittee members discovered that they could all communicate without talking to one another, except for B ill, who was in his own body. It was as if the men had two-way radios in their heads, with no way of turning them off. That was the drawback. Every thought they had was available to the others. It took discipline and some time before the scientists were able to l imit their thoughts to constructive and meaningful dialogue. Distance posed no barriers for them. They were able to communicate telepathically, regardless of the miles between them. Bill felt close to the Aliens, more so than did the others. He did not feel that the Aliens are capable of doing anything bad to humans, even though the Aliens revealed to Bill that all human bodies are under their ownership . “Whatever that meant,” he did not see that as a threat to humans. The scientists were concerned about where the Aliens acquire the human bodies that they use when the Aliens mingle ‘incognito’ among the human population. Bill told the committee that it was probable that the Aliens either grew the bodies in one of their ships; or at worst, the Aliens did what the committee was doing and harvested humans who are dying. With the equipment that the Aliens possessed, they could keep anyone from dying - so why didn't they? Bill had no answer. The Aliens told Bill that they did not interfere with the soul, but the Aliens had equipment that allowed them to remove the soul and place it into another body. Could the Aliens also store the soul outside of a human body - like in a container? If so, for what purpose? Are the Aliens God's little helpers? Bill Smith could not answer those questions for his colleagues. [ Editor's Note: The first week of March 1991, I received a brown, legal-sized envelope by Certified Mail postmarked February 28, 1991, from Porterv ille, California. The envelope contained an audiocassette, letter and drawings from a woman named Linda Porter then 45-years-old, having been born in 1946. The incidents and drawings from her life time of interaction with non-humans is detailed in my book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness - see Earthfiles Shop. One of Linda's experiences relates directly to Chapter 8 from In League With A UFO © 1997 by Lou Baldin. So, I want to share an excerpt from Pages 240 - 282 in my book Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness © 1998 by Linda Moulton Howe. ]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Linda Porter: “I was shown at some time a room with very tall, clear tube-like containers or cylinders on a raised platform, which seemed to be at the center of the room. Inside these tubes - standing upright, naked and appearing to be asleep - were humans, or at least they looked human to me. They looked like they were in some kind of suspended animation. “I don't think they were dead because their color was too good. They were floating in what appeared to be a purple gas. It was very thick and hard to see through, but it swirled around so much that you could see the people as it moved. I was never told anything, at least that I remember. It was just like I was taken into the room, showed them, and then brought back out, and that was it. I don't remember asking questions, and I don't remember the non-humans saying anything. L inda Porter said she was taken by a “grey-skinned scientist” to a room where three people were in tubes. She felt the people were alive, but in a state of suspended animation and that the man on far right in tubes was a younger clone she later saw activated by a “soul transfer” from his older body that died nearby. Drawing by Linda Porter for Howe © 1991. “ There was a praying mantis being and light-filled room. I remember the being slowly coming around the corner and facing me. He stood very st ill and simply waited, as if he knew how frightening he appeared to me. Eventually he began to talk to me, although as yet, I do not have any memory of what was said. He seemed to possess a great deal of dignity and gave the impression of being quite old. “After he finished saying whatever he had to say, I turned around and he walked me to this room (filled with dense light). The memory ends with me about to enter the room and the thought, ‘Translated into the Light.’ Whatever that means, it has to do with what happened.”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"L inda Porter's drawing of praying mantis being and light-filled room she remembered from a 1963 abduction experience in Covina, California, when Linda was 17-years-old. She thought what happened in the light-filled room was connected to her later \"soul transfer\" into a healthier clone of her body. Drawing by Linda Porter for Howe © 1991. Later, Linda Porter remembered that the praying mantis creature and the room of light were connected to the people in the tubes and sent me more sketches along with the following letter: Linda Porter: “ When I was twelve, I became deathly ill with a high fever and a badly infected throat. The fever was so high that I know, for at least one day, I was delirious. I have a memory of floating on the ceiling and l ooking down at ‘ myself ’ in bed. I was that sick. My parents did not believe in doctors, so I was left to recover on my own - which I did - or at least thought that I did! \"I was taken abaord the craft that all of this occurred on. Even though it began with the praying mantis type, the alien who was actually with me through all this was whitish, about five feet tall (maybe a little taller), and had huge eyes with black pupils. “I was taken into the ‘room of light’ and shown a man about 46-years-old who was very close to death. He was lying in a rectangular container. “I do not remember the mechanics of how this was done, but his soul was then lifted up out of his dying body! It left the body in the area of the solar plexus (abdomen). It was about two and one--half feet long, five inches wide and was a breathtakingly beautiful, soft, iridescent yellow with a white, glowing inner core that radiated a very gentle heat. There was a pastel orange layer around the yellow. “The soul floated across the room to another body taken from one"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"of the tubes. The tube body looked like the man would have appeared at about 25 years of age. The new body appeared empty. I don't know any other way to describe it - like an empty container. The 'old body' was now bluish in color and obviously dead. L inda Porter's depiction of dying man's bright “soul light” lifting out of his body, floating to younger cloned version of the man now in suspended animation outside the tube, descending through top of clone's head and settling into solar plexus. Drawing by Linda Porter for Howe © 1991. “The soul floated above the new body, which was standing upright outside the tube, unsuppported and slumping forward a little. The soul light then descended, entering the body at the top of the back of the head, moving all the way down to the area midway between the shoulder blades. It then merged into the body totally and settled in front of the spinal column in the area of the solar plexus (dense cluster of nerve cells and supporting tissue, located behind the stomach in the region of the celiac artery just below the diaphragm). “It then seemed to stretch itself out longer, a few inches up, a few inches down. The younger body then took on an ‘occupied’ look, as if the person were merely asleep. “The rectangular tube container that held the ‘old’ vacant body filled up with a liquid to preserve the tissues until it could be dissected. The non-humans wanted to find out how some kind of poison had entered that man's body, how it had progresssed through the bodily systems, and at what point the poison (contaminant) had reached a level that the body could no longer deal with the poison. “After the dissection, I was told that the body would be discarded. The non-humans seemed very surprised that I was upset that the body was just going to be tossed overboard! They told me it was only a container for the soul and of no other value. “The non-humans think our concept of funerals is barbarous. To them there is no difference between an empty beer can and an empty body. “I was told that the (resurrected) cloned man would be relocated elsewhere (maybe Australia) and would continue on with his life. Part of the reason the non-humans take tissue samples from abductees when they are quite young is to have this tissue in"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"reserve in case a new body becomes necessary later on. (Howe's emphasis.) “New bodies can be stored indefinitely. The containers in the sketch with the three people in the tubes are storage containers. There are 'activation' containers, which have a light in the top that must be on the person for (unknown) amount of hours before a body can be activated - if a body has been in storage. If newly made, it does not need light. In the sketch with the three people in the tubes, the body on the far right was the (younger) one given to the man. “I got the impression the non-humans do not like to do this soul transfer very often. Actually, I got the feeling they're not supposed to be doing this at all. “But they seemed to be backed into a corner and have no other recourse. The non-humans seem to be trying to hide all this from some 'higher' form of life. Whatever the ‘authority’ is that prohibits this soul transfer also prohibits the non-humans from interfering on this planet. (? Isn't there interference?) Whoever the authority, it is much higher evolved than the non-humans are and wields a great deal of power over many, many other realms of existence.” ontinued in Part 13 - More Alien Manipulation More Information: or further reports about extraterrestrial biological entities and technologies, please see my books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities in the Earthfiles Shop.
