In 2003, there were several complex crop formations in soybeans in the mound region east and south of Hillsboro. See 09-06-03 Earthfiles.

"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The Ohio Historical Society Marker at the foot of the mound next to the steps says: \"Miamisburg Mound, the largest conical earthwork in Ohio, originally was sixty-eight feet high with a diameter of three hundred feet. One excavating attempt in 1869 reduced the height to its present sixty-five feet. The mound was then partially investigated by means of a vertical shaft which extended from the top to the base and connected with two horizontal tunnels. The exploration revealed one burial eight feet from the top containing a bark-covered skeleton and a vault twenty-eight feet lower that was surrounded by logs but without a burial. Along the sides of the vertical shaft were found various layers of sand and stones implying that the mound was built in several stages. The entire construction, however, has never been systematically excavated. \"The conical shape, the types of burials, and the absence of associated earthworks indicate that the Miamisburg Mound was the work of Adena Indians, a prehistoric group that lived in the Ohio Valley between 1000 B.C. and 400 A.D. these peoples were the first in this area to domesticate plants for food, to settle in fairly permanent villages, and to make pottery. An important part of their way of life was the proper burial of the dead in graves that were covered with earth mounds, such as this one.\" September 2, 2004 Miamisburg, Ohio - Tonight at 9 p.m. Eastern Time, Jeffrey Wilson called me on his cell phone while standing in the middle of \"the most impressive corn formation\" he has ever seen. Yesterday he received a phone call from a Columbus, Ohio, resident who heard there was a large crop pattern in Miamisburg. Jeff is Director of the Independent Crop Circle Researchers Association (ICCRA) and two of his members - Ted Robertson and Doug McElwain - got to Miamisburg, but could not find the pattern from the ground. So, they got a plane and quickly saw the large formation in tall corn in a field not far from downtown Miamisburg. Late this afternoon, Jeff Wilson also got to see the pattern from the air and took photographs. Tomorrow I will update this report with the ICCRA aerial and ground photographs from Jeff, Ted and Doug. Interview by Cell Phone with Jeff Wilson from Miamisburg, Ohio Formation: Large 8-foot-tall corn field in Miamisburg, Ohio, bordered on two sides by residential developments.

Compare to the Serpent Mound, Ohio, pattern of 2003 below. Note the two \"grape shot\" small circles and \"rectangle\" outside the main formation, similar to so many crop formations in England. Aerial photographs © 2004 by Jeffrey Wilson. Measurement update from Jeff Wilson on September 3, 2004: Total length = 222 feet. Largest circle diameter = 124 feet. Smallest two outer circles beyond main pattern - Eastern circle (bottom left) diameter = 14 ft. 6 inches. Western smallest circle diameter = 11 feet. Vesica Pisces \"Eye\" = 56 feet long; Vesica inner circle diameter = 15 feet. Central downed circle diameter = 40 feet. Jeffrey Wilson, Director, Independent Crop Circle Researchers Association (ICCRA), Cincinnati, Ohio: \"We don't know how long it's been down. My first estimation is at least seven days old because there is some plant recovery that has taken place. Some of the stalks are starting to come back up. But it is by far the most impressive in terms of its lay of any corn circle formation that I've ever been to not just from the sheer size of it, but the way the corn is laid down in curves. THE IMPLICATION IS THAT IF THERE ARE A LOT OF CURVES IN THE LAY, THE STIFF CORN STALKS WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO SOME KIND OF HEAT ENERGY IN ORDER FOR IT TO SOFTEN AND CURVE? Yes. The smaller circles definitely have a curve to them. The way the circle was made, the stalks actually curve around inside the circle. So, it's not as if they are just laid flat in the approximation of a circle. They are actually curved to make a circle. Jeffrey Wilson reports: \"The corn stalks in the formation w ere found lying flat to the ground, but unbroken without any scuff marks on any stalks discovered (no mechanical damage discovered so far.) A modest amount of photo/gravi-tropism recovery has taken place, leading us to believe that the formation is at least a week old, and possibly older. The stalks in the smallest circles are curved to make the central sw irl of the lay. Each of the circles has a single, standing stalk of corn left in the center.\" Photograph © 2004 by Jeffrey Wilson. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Miamisburg, Ohio 2004 Reminiscent of Serpent Mound, Ohio 2003 WHAT KIND OF PATTERN IS THIS? It has design elements of the Serpent Mound formation from last year. There is an 'eye,' so to speak (Vesica Pisces). Soybean farmer discovered this pattern on August 17, 2003, near the ancient Serpent Mound in Locust Grove, Ohio. \"Eye\" is the Vesica Pisces created by overlapping circles. Aerial photograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson and Roger Sugden. Then there is sort of like a nested crescent up above that, very similar to the Serpent Mound formation. Then, there is a series of circles in alignment with that. All the single circles have standing corn in the centers of them. I have to say that the corn is about 8 feet tall at its maximum point, so for somebody to stand out here with a rope and try to maneuver around without damaging any of the corn that is standing is a pretty impressive feat if they could pull that off. Don't really see any broken stalks. The stuff is laid down pretty flat to the ground, pretty gently. A lot of the stalks are pulled out at the roots, but there aren't any abrasion marks that we can see so far on the stalks. \"Veil-like effects were noted in the adjacent sections of the corn formation - with a section of stalks only 3-deep left standing in this photograph.\" Photograph © 2004 by Jeffrey Wilson. Corn Field Near Miamisburg Residential Area"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Jeffrey Wilson: \"The formation is not aligned with the rows of corn in the field or with center of the Miamisburg conical mound, but is 'offset' by about 30 degrees. Aerial photograph © 2004 by Ted Robertson. YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT SOMETHING THAT LARGE NEAR TOWN WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN AND REPORTED BY PILOTS. Right, but for some reason it wasn't reported to us until yesterday. But, the Miamisburg News newspaper printed a story today on the front page with a headline asking, 'Did Aliens Visit Miamisburg?' So, somebody else apparently saw and reported the formation to the newspaper. HOW BIG IS THE CORN FIELD? I'd say it's probably in length about .4 miles, maybe half a mile. Width is probably a good quarter-mile across. SO IT'S A PRETTY BIG CORN FIELD. Yes, and you cannot see it from the road. It's near the back of the field I would say three- quarters of the way into the field. Ted and Doug McElwain both drove around and around looking for this and could not find it because it was so hidden. You can't see this pattern from anywhere around the edge of the field. It was difficult to figure out where in the field it was because when you are standing on the ground, if you climbed up on something, you can't really see it. It's really only visible from the air. There is nothing at all around it that would give you any perspective of this formation. IN TERMS OF NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST AXIS, WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THIS PATTERN? I haven't measured it yet, but my guess is that it's probably aligned east/west. IT'S 120 MILES AT LEAST FROM THE SERPENT MOUND LAST YEAR? Yes, around that. HAVE YOU BEEN ABLE TO SEE IF ANY OF THE NODES SHOW EXPULSIONS OR OTHER CHANGES? No. There doesn't appear to be any. I've looked at quite a few stalks and there doesn't seem to be any exploded nodes or anything like that at this point. WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THAT IS SO ANOMALOUS IS THAT FLUIDITY OF THE LAY IN CORN THAT WOULD BE THE MOST OUTSTANDING ANOMALY AT THIS POINT? Ye s . Field Investigation Instruments GIVE ME A LIST OF THE METERS YOU ARE GOING TO USE IN THE FORMATION?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"1) Tri-Field Natural Electromagnetic Meter, which filters out manmade electromagnetic sources and only picks up natural sources. It picks up electric field strength, magnetic field strength and radio and microwave emissions. 2) Broadband Meter, which has a wider spectrum in which it receives. That is also measuring magnetic fields, electric fields and radio microwave emissions. 3) Gamma Scout Geiger Counter which right now is set to detect gamma only. We're picking up somewhere around .18 to .24 micro-Sieverts per hour of radioactivity, which is probably above the background level. It's a European standard that has been used in the past few years to measure the affect of radiation on biological activity. It's sort of a new measure.\" Editor's Note: 1 sievert (Sv) = 100 rem The International System of Units Radiation Measurements: Radioactivity Absorbed Dose Dose Equivalent Exposure Common Units = curie (Ci) rad rem roentgen (R) SI Units = becquerel (Bq) gray (Gy) sievert (Sv) coulomb/kilogram (C/kg) \"We will double check that out here, but normally the background is anywhere from .09 to .11. So we could be measuring close to double the background, which would be significant. WHAT COULD CAUSE THAT? That's a good question. There are very few gamma sources besides cosmic rays and stuff being emitted from the sun and stellar sources. There are only a handful of natural gamma emitters that are on the ground and not too many in the sense they don't have a half life of a billion years or something like that. There are probably less than a dozen that have a half life of something we'd be looking at here. I can't speculate any further about what that source might be. Any Other Crop Formations in Miamisburg Region? IN RELATIONSHIP TO ANY PATTERNS LAST YEAR, IS THIS CLOSE TO ANY OF THEM LAST YEAR GEOGRAPHICALLY? No, I can't think of any. There hasn't been a formation in this part of Ohio that I've recorded. There was a formation up near Lima, Ohio back in 1999, which is probably another 60 to 70 miles north of here (Miamisburg). Oh, look the Miamisburg Fire Department has put their spotlight out for us. They have been quite cooperative with us. The department has the land right adjacent to the corn field. They put up their ladder and a giant spotlight shining over the field so we would have some light. I'M CURIOUS IF THERE HAS BEEN ANY DOWNED CROP IN THAT AREA BEFORE? I don't know. This area around the Mound has gotten a lot of development over the past 6 to 8 years. The last time I visited the Miamisburg mound was in 1996. At that time, there were just farm fields surrounding the whole mound except towards the city. Now, there are a lot of housing subdivisions that have gone up around the mound. In fact, directly behind this field in between the mound and the field is a new housing development. Although there is a line of trees that separates that development from this formation. HAS THE FIRE DEPARTMENT HEARD OF A SIMILAR REPORT OF DOWNED CROP BEFORE? No, they've never seen anything like it.\" More to come - Latest stunning evidence from Hillsboro, Ohio, corn formation.
