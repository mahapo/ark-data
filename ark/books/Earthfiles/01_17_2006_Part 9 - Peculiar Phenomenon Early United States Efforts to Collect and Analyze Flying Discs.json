Andrew Kissner Return to Part 1 Trouble All Over the World T he most controversial research finding will undoubtedly generate argument from both proponents and skeptics of the flying disc phenomenon. But it appears that flying discs very possibly behaved aggressively in 1947. It's also possible there was aggression before that year, but certainly after the May 29 detonation in Juarez, Mexico, and second explosion near Mt. Franklin in New Mexico. This possibly explains one reason why the U. S. government will not admit that UFOs and their occupants exist. Aerial events reported and explained away as the result of \"natural causes\" do not appear to have been \"natural\" in any respect. Have you ever wondered why in all of the instances that military units have been observed in association with this phenomena, no report has mentioned that military personnel shot at the objects? This author believes we definitely did in the summer of 1947. One of the many unanswered questions is how long was there an American military order to shoot down the discs described as \"enemy weapon systems?\" A lengthy series of mysterious and unexplainable civil and military air disasters occurred after the May 29, 1947, Juarez incident. My research in several local and national newspapers from that time period show that more than sixty U. S. Army and Navy aircraft - B-29s, B-17s, Corsairs, P-80s, P-84s, AT-6s, P-51s, C-47s, F-7s - were lost over a two month period beginning on May 29, 1947. One hundred twenty Army and Navy airmen were killed and 74 others injured in these incidents. Most of those airplane accidents occurred over the continental United States. By June 15, 1947, President Harry Truman commissioned a blue ribbon panel of experts headed by Civil Aeronautics Board Chairman, James Landis and Dr. Jerome Hunsaker (MJ-7), Chairman of the National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics (NASA) to investigate. On May 29, 1947, at La Guardia Field, New York, at 8:10 p.m. EST, a United Airlines DC-4 used all of the runway to take off, but failed to gain altitude, flipped over and exploded at the end of the runway. Thirty-eight people died. It was the largest commercial airline disaster in U. S. history at that time. [ The New York Times , May 30, 1947.] In the NYT 's article, an assistant New York district attorney who interviewed the injured pilot at the hospital reported: \"He said that he tried to get it off the ground, but nothing happened. The plane continued on through a wire fence and across a highway and crashed into a ravine. The next thing he knew, there were flames all around him.\" Further, a reporter at the scene said: \"Flames shot fifty feet or more into the air, forming a torch that could be seen for miles. The heat from the burning gasoline in the big plane's tanks was so intense that would-be rescuers on the scene ... could not help with their handheld fire extinguishers.\" A subsequent Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) investigation concluded that as the pilot was taking off and approaching 100 miles per hour: "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the aircraft's engines were operating normally the flight controls were free all systems on the plane were functioning but the airliner did not develop enough lift to gain altitude As the airplane neared the end of the runway, the pilot ordered the first officer to cut all power while the pilot applied the brakes, but could not stop suddenly enough. The Vice President of Operations for United Airlines said: \"A study of weather conditions which prevailed at the time indicates the probable cause of the accident was a wind shift (change in the direction of the wind) of almost unbelievable suddenness, which changed from the south blowing at 19 mph only a few minutes before takeoff to a northwest wind blowing at 23 mph. \"It is believed that a freak gust of wind, slightly in advance of an approaching squall line, was responsible for the accident. To my knowledge, this has never happened before to a plane of this type; or, in fact, to any large transport plane. Take-off accidents in themselves are extremely rare. This particular type in a transport is unheard of.\" [ Ibid.] Less than twenty hours later on May 30, 1947, an Eastern Airlines DC-4 flying above Aberdeen Proving Ground (another U. S. Army Ordnance/OSRD test site) at Port Deposit, Maryland, crashed. Fifty-four passengers and crew members died. According to eyewitnesses, the airliner: \"...fell apart in the air and nosedived into the ground,\" exploding on impact. That second crash then became the worst U. S. commercial airline disaster at the time. F ront page, The New York Times , May 30, 1947."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"F ront page, The New York Times , May 31, 1947. S taff of the Civil Aeronautics Board, returning from La Guardia Field after investigating the earlier United Airlines crash, \"watched helplessly\" as the Eastern Airlines DC-4, flying three to five miles ahead of them, \"nosed down,\" crashed and exploded. CAB investigators landed at Aberdeen Proving Ground and rushed to the crash scene. [ Ibid.] According to an eyewitness, \"I saw the plane in a steep glide and several gleaming things, like metal, fell away from the plane as it hurtled down.\" Were those \"gleaming things\" more peculiar phenomena? In the newspapers reviewed for this manuscript, I found worldwide that twenty-nine aircraft were destroyed within 72 hours of the \"Juarez Incident\" and 198 people died. Other air crashes included: A U. S. Army Air Forces B-29 bomber which crashed around midnight at the end of the runway at Ladd Field, Alaska, on May 29, 1947, when it failed to gain altitude on take off. Three died. The bomber lifted several feet off the ground and flew over a low rise right into a swamp next to the Chena River.

[ Ibid.] If this would have been a commercial flight, it would have replaced the La Guardia United Airlines crash as the largest air disaster in U. S. history at the time.

The New York Times reported on May 30, 1947: \"The Navy pilot said that he first saw the light plane flying about 500 feet above and 1,000 feet to his left ... and then he lost sight of it.
