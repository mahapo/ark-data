From Appendix 14 Pages 375- 391 An Alien Harvest: Further Evidence Linking Animal Mutilations and Human Abductions to Alien Life Forms © 1989 by Linda Moulton Howe Transcript: \"OPERATION UFO SEARCH,\" a radio interview on Houston's KTRH NewsRadio between host, Frank Haley, and Los Angeles script writer, Robert Emenegger. This rebroadcast of an earlier taped interview was heard in Houston, Texas, on Thanksgiving Day, November 1976. Radio Program Introduction HALEY: Hello, my name is Frank Haley. This is \"Operation UFO Search.\" On today's program, we are going to re-play an interview with a man we had as a guest on the program probably two or two and a half years ago and we're doing this for several reasons. First of all, because it's a holiday and most of you will be gathering around the dinner table or getting ready for the Thanksgiving meal. And also because it is rather difficult to get people to do live interviews on holidays. And also because this particular interview will be with Bob Emenegger, a man who researched the book and screenplay on the subject of UFOs and it is called, UFOS: Past, Present and Future. It is this program, the TV version of it, that is going to be shown tomorrow in Houston on Channel 13 and I'm not sure of the time, but I think it is four o'clock, possibly four-thirty, but you can check your newspaper TV listings for that.
