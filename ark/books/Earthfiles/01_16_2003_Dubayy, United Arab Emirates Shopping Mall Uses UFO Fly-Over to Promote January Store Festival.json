Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Dubai, United Arab Emirates, Shopping Mall Uses \"UFO Fly-Over\" to Promot e January Store Festival © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe Dubai, (Dubayy), United Arab Emirates, on the Persian Gulf. January 16, 2003 Dubayy, United Arab Emirates - On January 14 in North America, Canadian UFO researcher, Brian Vikes, received an e-mail from Dubai, U.A.E. resident, Maggie Jaber. She had translated to English the headline, text and photographs about a \"UFO fly-over\" from one of the leading newspapers, Al Khaleej, in Dubai (Dubayy), United Arab Emirates, on the coast of the Persian Gulf. The main headline was, \"UFO Over Alghurair City Dubai United Arab Emirates.\" Emirate refers to the office or jurisdiction of an \"emir.\" An emir can be an Arabian prince, chieftain or governor, a title of honor given to the descendants of Mohammed. Brian forwarded her translation and photographs to me and I called him to ask for Maggie's phone number so I could talk with her directly. Brian sent my inquiry to her. In a few hours, apparently after she did some checking herself, she e-mailed back that the word Alghurair refers to the Al Ghuraier City Mall, one of Dubai's oldest and largest shopping malls. Under the headline were the Arabic text and photographs shown below. But the whole story was in the Advertising Section of the Al Khaleej newspaper and was a promotion for a shopping festival that began on January 15, 2003. This science fiction advertisement, according to Maggie Jaber, was created and produced by Fadi Kashoukoush, Marketing Director, Al Ghuraier Group. I finally reached Maggie Jaber by phone in Dubai (Dubayy) today and asked her to explain on the record what she knew.

Interview: Maggie Jaber, Resident, Dubai (Dubayy), United Arab Emirates: \" On the 15th of January, it started the shopping festival in Dubai and the (newspaper UFO story) was part of the El Ghuraier City Mall's advertising. This guy sent to Brian a letter that they were working on the campaign and it was an idea they had and it worked. The people are members of the Ghuraier Mall's staff and the whole thing is just an advertising campaign for the Ghuraier Mall. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY THE MALL WOULD USE A FAKE STORY AND PHOTOGRAPHS IN THE REAL Al Khaleej NEWSPAPER ABOUT A FLYOVER OF A UFO OVER DUBAI? It's just an idea that UFOs are visiting El Ghuraier to go shopping, aliens come to earth and pass by Ghuraier Mall to do shopping. That's the whole idea. And the guy (who created it), by the way, I talked to him, the Marketing Director, and he does not believe in UFOs. HOW DO YOU SPELL HIS NAME? Fadi Kashoukoush, Marketing Director, Al Ghuraier Group. THEY RUN THE MALL? They run the mall. SO THE REAL DUBAI NEWSPAPER DID THIS AS AN ADVERTISING SUPPLEMENT? Yes, they put it in the Advertising Section. And it worked. They've had a lot of publicity.\" We b s it e s : http://www.alkhaleej.co.ae/ Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
