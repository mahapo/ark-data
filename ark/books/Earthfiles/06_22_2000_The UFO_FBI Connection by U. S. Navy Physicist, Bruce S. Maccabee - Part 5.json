Maccabee - Part 5 Â© 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe June 22, 2000 Sabillasville, Maryland - Part 5 of the interview with Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph. D., Research Physicist at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) in Dahlgren, Virginia begins with the complex politics of the USAF, FBI, CIA and one of the main reasons for their cover-up policy about the UFO mystery. On May 1, 2000, his book The UFO/FBI Connection, was released detailing his research since 1976 into FBI documents and knowledge about the UFO mystery. Interview: Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Dahlgren, Virginia: FBI, USAF, The CIA and the UFO Cover-Up \"But not for the FBI. In October of 1952, the FBI learned about the famous Newhouse Utah movie. And the FBI was told that all sorts of analysis had been done and it could not be explained. And the FBI also learned that top military officials were considering interplanetary ships. There are two documents in the Air Force file that indicate that. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"October 27, 1952 internal Office Memorandum from FBI Agent V. P. Keay to FBI Agent A. B. Belmont on the Subject of 'FLYING SAUCERS.\" Despite U. S. government propaganda to the media and public that UFOs were only misidentified weather balloons, meteors and swamp gas, the Synopsis of this memo tells a completely different story: \"Military officials are seriously considering the possibility of interplanetary ships.\" Document provided by Navy research physicist Bruce S. Maccabee. I should point out that I have other information in my book which suggests that the top Air Force officials assumed that flying saucers were interplanetary and that there was nothing they could do about them and that is why Project SIGN or Project BLUE BOOK were never high level projects. The top people knew what was going on and knew nothing they could do about it. They had a public relations problem which BLUE BOOK was designed to deal with. They did not want the general public to realize that something was going on that they had no control over, so the attempt was to damp it down as much as possible. IT''S BEEN A WAITING GAME LIKE THAT FOR FIFTY YEARS. Yes, and you asked what did the CIA have to do with it? I have a chapter called \"The X-Files, CIA Version.\" In August 1952, all these sightings were too much for the General Walter Bedell Smith, Director of the CIA, and he decided to have a little research group to find out what was going on. Where the CIA made their mistake was in going to Air Force Technical Intelligence Center there in Wright-Patterson AFB where they were told, 'Oh, by the way, we can explain all sorts of stuff.' The CIA was not told that 3% were unexplained. Remember, that the information that the FBI got came from the Air Force Intelligence in the Pentagon. However, the CIA went over to Dayton, Ohio, to Wright-Patterson AFB, to talk to the Air Technical Intelligence people there. It was there job by tradition, thanks to General Vandenberg, to explain everything! And so they basically told the CIA all sorts of things can be explained. And the CIA guy went back to Washington and told the Director that the Air Force seems to be handling the problem. However, they are not doing what we would like them to do. We would like to know why these reports are generated in the first place. And we want to know why there can't be more rapid identification. The CIA was worried about two possibilities: 1) A sudden flux of flying saucer reports at a time when an attack was imminent"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"could clog information channels. 2) And the second thing they were worried about was that if an object in the sky were not identified immediately, we might waste some of our precious aircraft sending them after this object and the airplanes would get close to the object and say, 'Oh, it's a weather balloon.' In other words, if Soviet agents suddenly started to sprinkle flying saucers and launch weird looking balloons, they might clog communication channels and they might raise spurious targets for our aircraft while their own aircraft were sneakily getting into our borders and dropping bombs. THIS IS THE CONFUSING PART OF THE HISTORY, BRUCE. WHY IS IT THAT THE UNITED STATES ALLOWED THE SOVIET UNION TO BE THE FALL GUY FOR THE PHENOMENON THAT WAS PUT IN THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING INTERPLANETARY, MEANING NON-HUMAN FROM SOME OTHER PLACE? WHY WOULD WE ALLOW EVERYONE IN MILITARY AND THE PUBLIC AND THE MEDIA TO KEEP ASSUMING THAT THIS WAS A SOVIET THREAT? THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS HISTORICALLY THAT IS SO SCHIZOPHRENIC. I know. But remember, the CIA was not saying there was a real Soviet threat. The CIA was not arguing that the Soviets were flying saucers over us. They were worried about the communication channels being clogged and the possibility of spurious targets, unidentified targets up there which we might be vectoring our jets toward and not vectoring our jets toward the real T-shaped aircraft flying along dropping bombs. REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE UNIDENTIFIEDS WERE, THEY WERE ACTUALLY WORRIED ABOUT A SOVIET INTRUSION USING THE PHENOMENON FOR ITS OWN COVER. Sure. And the Psychological Strategy Board says, 'Hey, can we take the flying saucer phenomenon and turn it around and use it against them?' That's NOT saying they think flying saucers were not interplanetary. But the problem was that the CIA went and talked to the ATIC people at Wright-Patterson AFB. Had the CIA gone to Air Force Intelligence in the Pentagon, they might have gotten a different story. But at ATIC where everything was supposedly going to be explained that's what they were told, everything could be explained. If you look through the CIA files for the fall of 1952, it becomes clear that this guy, Marshall Chadwell, who was in charge of the investigation of what the flying saucer stuff was all about, came upon some information. We don't know what it was exactly because it's not in the files that were released. But something apparently convinced him there was really something going on that was not just a problem of communication channels and not being able to identify things. But there was something really bizarre happening. The document in the CIA file indicates he was avid to set up a research group to find out why sightings were unidentified. Ultimately, he wanted to write a document for a National Security Council Intelligence Directive, a so-called NSCID, to have a special project set up. But then some other people argued to have a scientific panel first to find out what the probability is that there is really something unusual in these flying saucer sightings. And that's what ended up being the Robertson Panel. And of course, we all know what happened with the Robertson Panel. A bunch of gray beards, old guys well known in the fields of research, got together and stumbled in a field they really weren't familiar with, the flying saucers. Oddly enough in this case, the Air Technical Intelligence people, the Project BLUE BOOK guys, Ruppelt, we're talking about January 1953, put their best foot forward and tried to get the best 100 cases or what ever it was to present to these people. But the scientists were adamant that everything could be explained. The Newhouse movie that so impressed the Air Force and the Navy, the Navy photographic analysts, that it led to the document in the FBI file"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"saying that top Air Force officials are considering interplanetary spaceships - that film was explained as birds in the Robertson Panel. As seagulls! Totally ignoring Newhouse's own description when the objects were closer to him and that they were circular, shiny metallic things. So, after the debunking, the CIA got out of it. They weren't interested any more. They did collect some documents over the following years. There are some interesting UFO sightings in the CIA files. But they aren't really material I put in my book because I am primarily interested in what the FBI did. The FBI following the 1952 thing still continued to collect information at a low rate. There is a sighting in there by an FBI person, a lady who is described as \"one of our best employees\" and her boyfriend who worked for the National Security Agency (NSA). WHAT WAS THEIR SIGHTING LIKE? They were driving along early in the morning in North Carolina, according to the report. The lady made the report and then they interviewed her a second time. They sent all this information to the Air Force Project BLUE BOOK and it doesn't appear there. I don't know where it went. Anyway, they were driving along on a misty morning and some circular object went over their car. They both saw it and were obviously surprised by it. There is no indication that the Air Force took any interest or interviewed them in any more depth. All we've got on it is what's in the FBI file. April 24, 1964 - Socorro, New Mexico Policeman Lonnie Zamora's Film Went to USAF The last sighting in the file is the Lonnie Zamora sighting. In my book, the first thing I mention is the last sighting in the book which starts out with a teletype message from the agent in charge at Socorro, New Mexico. He was on the scene within 30 minutes of Zamora's sighting. And he did the most extensive interview with Zamora. THIS IS FBI? Yes, the FBI agent. I have one chapter in the book on the CIA and everything else is the FBI or Air Force. And this was the last sighting in the FBI file that was investigated. And it was not investigated on an official basis, according to the FBI agent. But nevertheless, he sent plenty of information to headquarters and it forms the core of the Zamora sighting. People who haven't read about that for years will probably find some interesting stuff in there. For example, another policeman's report that he arrived at the scene within minutes of Zamora's sighting and took pictures. He gave the film to the Air Force to be developed. When he asked them some weeks later, 'What happened to the photographs?' The Air Force said, 'The film was fogged.' FBI File Has a 1967 Abduction Report There is a document in the FBI file that was not investigated, but is related to abductions. In 1967, a guy called the FBI at 4 o'clock in the morning from Chesapeake, Virginia. He reported that he had been working in his store late that night. When he left the store, he thought he had been picked up by some strange creatures, taken away, and then brought back. He wasn't absolutely sure what had happened, but he was calling at 4 o'clock in the morning to report. So, the FBI agents checked through their files to see if they had a file on this guy and they wrote down on the bottom of the report that there was no file on this person. That's all they did. I bring that up because debunker Phil Klass has been noted over the past few years to say that if abductions were real, they would report them to the FBI"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"because it's a federal offense. So, now we know what the FBI will do about UFO abductions. THEY CONFIRM THEY DON'T HAVE A FILE AND CLOSE IT. That's right. They investigate the abductee as opposed to the abductor. HOW DID RON PANDOLFI AT THE CIA COME TO BE INVOLVED IN UFO INVESTIGATIONS IN 1984 ON? Kit Green, whom I had met in 1978 when I went to the CIA to talk about the New Zealand sightings, I went there with some fear and trepidation without knowing what the heck was going on. I knew they had radar experts and I thought maybe they could help me with some of the radar and if there was anything TOP SECRET that happened to be flying around in New Zealand at the time. But basically, what it amounted to was that I gave them a lot of information and they gave me nothing. But I did meet this guy, Kit Green. Well, Kit Green, who by the way has been 'outed' several times the past few years when it comes to paranormal and remote viewing stuff. Puthoff and Targ did remote viewing research at Stanford Research Institute twenty-five years ago or more. Kit Green was a medical doctor, but he headed the CIA weird desk. The main point is that Puthoff and Targ had worked with Ingo Swann and determined that something was really going on there with remote viewing. And a guy at the CIA took an interest in it, a man who is dead now. The Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) was also involved in funding remote viewing. There was an intersection point between remote viewing and UFOs. This has nothing to do with my new book, but the remote viewing they were doing involved putting a guy inside a room and asking him to identify or draw something that appears to be what someone else is either looking at or had taken a photo of. They seemed to be getting some success. In Ingo Swann's book, Penetration, he talks about finding that gantry or big crane thing in the Soviet Union. He did a drawing that looked very much like a perspective drawing of that big machine. And Ingo drew a UFO behind a submarine in one of his remote viewings. That's the kind of intersection I'm talking about. These guys who didn't believe in UFOs, but did believe strongly in metal bending, psychokinesis, remote viewing and all that mind research, were suddenly confronted with the UFO problem right in their face.\" And the CIA was putting money into remote viewing and they worried there was a remote viewing gap between the U. S. and the Russians. When I talked with Kit Green in 1979, he was aware of all this, too, but he wouldn't tell me anything. He would only suck up information from me regarding the UFO aspect. But there was this intersection point where the psychics started zeroing in on UFOs and the people in the paranormal side were saying, 'This can't be. UFOs aren't real.' So they had to start investigating what was going on in the UFO community. Green, as the head of the weird desk at the CIA, was aware of all this in the paranormal and remote viewing and he was part of the intersection with UFOs. When he was trying to analyze the New Zealand case, he was standing there talking about, he was wondering if the pilot and co-pilot had some kind of temporary insanity? Could the reporter have hoaxed the film? They were trying to come up with all sorts of explanations that I knew would be hokey explanations that made no sense at all. But from his point of view, he was trying to explain it away. Remember, these guys did not come from the point of view that UFOs were real. They came from the point of view that psychic stuff was real."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Kit Green left the CIA in the early 1980s and Ron Pandolfi took over what Kit Green was doing. Pandolfi is a very smart guy and he ended up doing a lot of different research. Being in charge of the weird desk was only part of it. But also he was worried about the laser zapping gap which is why he contacted me in the first place back in 1984. Presumably, if he had contacted the other guy who was working on it, Charlie Bell, he never would have found out about the New Zealand UFOs and me and there never would have been any connection. But because he called me and I happened to be the guy who answered the phone, I already had a reputation at the CIA because of the talk I'd given five years before. ABOUT NEW ZEALAND. Yeah. He started talking to me about UFO stuff. In 1987, we had the MUFON symposium at American University in 1987 and there was a lot of publicity about it. So, Ron Pandolfi invited me to give a talk at the CIA about UFOs. It was to be an open talk, that is in the sense that anybody at the agency could show up from secretaries, case workers and so on. And he told me that the room it was in was the Director's Conference Room. There was a big long table in it and so many people showed up all the chairs in the room were taken up. People were standing around the outside. And guess what I told them? I told them about their own CIA files. I carried coals to New Castle. I went through all the stuff we knew about the CIA and sightings and Pandolfi told me afterward that I created a lot of spies in the agency. People who were trying to dig up stuff that might be buried here and there. That's sort of how he got involved in this stuff. NOT BECAUSE HE HAD A SPECIFIC UFO ASSIGNMENT? It's a non-specific assignment. It's like the remote viewing. If there is a possibility that remote viewing is real and the Russians can do it, we had better be able to do it. So we put a few million dollars in over a few years. Pandolfi told me it was something like $5 million bucks over 10 years they had put in to remote viewing. Somewhere around the mid 1980s, it crashed and the whole program was declassified and articles have been written about it in the last five years. In fact, Puthoff wrote an article that appeared in the Journal of Scientific Exploration a couple of years ago where he said, 'Finally I can tell you what I was doing.'\" More Information: The UFO /FBI Connection by Bruce S.
