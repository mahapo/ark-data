There around 4:45 AM on Saturday, October 4, 2008, two hunters encountered strange lights and a lime green, glowing humanoi d “gl i di ng” over a grassy cl eari ng. October 10, 2008 Elk County, Pennsylvania - Western Pennsylvania has long been haunted by the mysterious phenomena of Bigfoot, large, black panthers, unidentified aerial craft in the skies and non-human beings on the ground – including most recently a lime green, glowing humanoid. Early Saturday morning October 4, 2008, two hunters were in the Clarion River Lake forest region of Elk County, Pennsylvania, about 60 miles northwest of State College. The sun was not up. One hunter had on a hat light and the other hunter had on a Mini-Mag light. Out of the darkness ahead appeared two greenish-blue lights. Over the next five minutes, the hunters were stunned by what happened. Eventually, their story reached Stan Gordon, who has lived in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, southeast of Pittsburgh since his birth there in 1950. By age ten, Stan was fascinated by UFO sightings in his western Pennsylvania region that kept being reported through the 1960s and the 1973 to 1974 Pennsylvania UFO wave. Stan Gordon’s professional work is selling advanced consumer electronics, but his passion has always been investigating UFO "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"reports in Pennsylvania. By 1970, Stan Gordon had organized the Westmoreland County UFO Study Group and established a UFO phone hotline for the public that is still active at 724-838-7768. Five years later in 1975, Stan expanded the group statewide as the Pennsylvania Center for UFO Research. By 1981, Stan founded the Pennsylvania Association for the Study of the Unexplained (PASU), which became a well known clearinghouse for high strangeness reports. Stan also served as Director of Pennsylvania's Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) from the 1970s to the 1990s and was the first MUFON member to receive the Meritorious Achievement in UFO Investigations award in 1987. One of Stan Gordon's most famous investigations is the famous December 9, 1965, crash of an unidentified aerial object near Kecksburg, Pennsylvania.

Stan says there has been an increase in UFO and other Pennsylvania high strangeness reports in 2008, and this most recent October 4th encounter by the two hunters is one of the most dramatic. Interview: Stan Gordon, UFO and Cryptozoology Investigator and Video Producer, UFO Crash Kecksburg: The Untold Story, Greensburg, Pennsylvania: “It was about 4:45 AM in the morning. It had been raining in the area and these two hunters were going out into the wooded area. As they walked further into the woods, they began to hear a coyote howling. It was not long after that the two hunters started hearing coyotes from all around that wooded area. It gave the impression that there were three groups of coyotes out there making a tremendous amount of noise with their howling. In fact, the two men even had trouble communicating at times because the howling was so loud. As the one man told me, ‘I have never heard so many coyotes howling like that ever before, even though I’m in the woods quite a bit.’ They are proceeding down into the woods and their only light is one Mini-Mag flashlight"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"and a hat with built-inlight. L eft: Hat with built-in LED lights. Right: Mini-Mag flashlight. At about 150 to 200 yards ahead of them on the other side of the field, the two hunters see two, dim, glowing lights. It was described to me by the eyewitnesses as about the size of a baseball, about two feet apart and about fifteen feet off the ground. The lights were giving off a glow that they said was similar to the Indigo glow of a watch or speedometer. Kind of a greenish Indigo color he has seen shine from a watch. They thought it was odd, but might be other hunters, even though they didn’t see signs of other hunters. They didn’t see other vehicles when they went into the woods. C entral ring glows the “Indigo blue” color of some speedometers and watches. So, they see these two lights and shut their lights off and are walking further back into the woods when they see a beam of light like from a flashlight flashing back and forth between the tree line. Once again, they are thinking, ‘Maybe there is a hunter there.’ Then within a few minutes of seeing the single beam of light, all of a sudden appears about ten individual beams of light that just suddenly appear. They are flashing around and seem to be originating from the same point in that area of the woods. What’s kind of unusual is that it didn’t give the hunters an impression of some one walking around as if trying to find their path through the woods. It wasn’t like someone was moving around carrying something. Those beams are about ten feet off the ground; they were projected parallel with the ground straight out projecting from the original point. The one hunter said, ‘How many lights are there?’ They thought it odd for so many to be coming out of nowhere. At that point, they are confused about what they are watching. As they are watching these beams of light, all of a sudden their attention is drawn to what appears to be a glowing, human-like figure that appears right in the area where the beams had originated. One of the hunters mentioned that one of the beams actually seemed to lead the glowing figure out into the field. The figure moved out about 20 feet into the field of grass that was about six inches tall. As the two hunters are watching the moving figure move pretty steadily and quick, suddenly all those other beams of light in the woods vanished. They just disappeared. Lime Green, Glowing Humanoid What was described to me was that the humanoid-shaped being looked like the silhouette of a person, but was glowing a light, lime green color. The witness said to me that the best way to describe the entity was if you got glow-in-the-dark paint and put it all over your body. He said that’s what the thing looked like. He said it was about three feet tall. The arms were hanging down to the sides and appeared to be longer than arms of a human"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"being. The legs were not very clear. The hunter said the glowing around this entity was kind of blocking out the shape, so it was hard to see the figure. The color, he said, was a light green lime color. He said he and his other hunter friend were walking through the woods at a pretty fast pace, and yet the way the entity was moving about twice as fast as they were and it gave the impression that it was actually gliding, rather than walking – gliding above the grassy field and there was no sound they could hear. At that point, they were both pretty shook up and one eyewitness was becoming nervous, not sure what was going on, and began to whistle out loud. When he whistled, he said, the glowing figure moving steadily across the grassy field suddenly stopped abruptly, ‘like stopping on a dime.’ The hunter said the green, glowing entity remained motionless for about 30 seconds. Then it began moving again about 20 feet deeper into the field and then suddenly vanished from sight. It disappeared and they never did see it again. Interestingly, he said about two minutes later after the entity in the field vanished, all the coyotes stopped howling. The coyotes had been howling the entire time. He did tell me later that day, as they kept trying to figure out what they had seen, they went back to the location to search for any footprints or evidence and found nothing. And they were very reluctant to tell anybody. One of the hunters told some people close to him and they made fun of him, so he said he just kept his mouth shut. IN ALL YOUR PENNSYLVANIA INVESTIGATIONS, HAVE YOU EVER HAD A CASE IN WHICH THERE WAS A HUMANOID FIGURE THAT APPEARED TO GLOW A LIME GREEN AND FLOAT OVER THE GROUND? I know I’ve had instances of entities in peoples’ homes that floated. In some cases, the people could not see the legs of the entities – the legs were not clear – but the entities were able to float around in the house. I can’t say in all cases, the entities glowed, but I have heard similar reports going back many years. THE GLIDING, FLOATING, HAS BEEN REPORTED OFF AND ON OVER AT LEAST HALF A CENTURY AND IMPLIES THAT WHATEVER WE’RE DEALING WITH, SOME OF THESE ENTITIES – ASSUMING IT’S A TECHNOLOGY – THEY HAVE THE TECHNOLOGY TO LITERALLY FLOAT ABOVE THE GROUND. Yes, not just here in Pennsylvania, but we’ve heard that historically from around the country and the world. In this particular case of August 3, 2000, around 10 PM, outside of Uniontown, Fayette County, Pennsylvania, where there were five witnesses and those people described seeing out in a rural area a being that they described as about 5 feet tall, human-like, very long, slender extremities, carrying a brown staff about five feet long. The eyewitnesses observed the entity from about 250 feet away, and there was no apparent ground disturbance, but they said this thing appeared to be gliding about 6 inches above the ground. They all got a pretty good look at the entity. Fayette County has a long history of all kinds of phenomena. One of the areas in Pennsylvania that has re-occurring reports of all kinds of phenomena is along the Chestnut Ridge. That mountain ridge runs from Preston County, West Virginia, through Indiana County in southwestern Pennsylvania. And year after year, we hear reports of strange animal sightings, UFOs, we have all kinds of unexplained booms and sounds along the ridge at times and all kinds of strange things that have been reported."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"H igh strangeness reports have had a long history in the Pennsylvania region betw een Uniontow n and Chestnut Ridge, i n Fayette County, Pennsyl vania south of Pi ttsburgh. Howling Coyotes THE AGITATION OF ANIMALS SUCH AS COYOTES HOWLING LOUDLY AND OTHER ANIMALS THAT ARE DISTURBED WHEN THE STRANGE LIGHTS AND SOMETIMES CRAFT OR ENTITIES ARE AROUND, HAS BEEN A PART OF THE UFO PHENOMENON FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY OF REPORTS. Oh, yes, it has been very prominent and especially in Bigfoot cases during that wave of sightings in 1973 to 1974. Many of those Bigfoot sightings were at close range - a lot of them, in fact, were daylight sightings. Sometimes there were multiple creature reports and many of them multiple eyewitness reports. Lots of them from Pennsylvania farm country. In a lot of reports, normally vicious, territorial dogs that bark and go crazy when something unknown or strange is around, when there were Bigfoot sightings, the dogs were hiding back in their pens. They would not bark. They would not move. Sometimes for days afterward, the dogs would not eat properly. I have witnessed that myself. Police officers working on Bigfoot sighting cases back then reported that to us. That's significant because people can be fooled, but animals cannot. August to September 2008 Pennsylvania UFO Reports I receive reports of UFO sightings every year all year round. In recent weeks, we’ve had a lot of reports of the bright planet Jupiter in the sky (laughs). But we’ve had some very interesting other reports that seem pretty significant in recent weeks and months. This August 12th sighting – this is a person who lives between Greensburg and Youngwood. It’s about 2 AM and the person is about to go to bed and notices this bright light shining in the window. He goes over to look out to observe what was described as like two, huge headlights side-by-side, kind of giving off a yellow cast, but it was right across the road at a neighbor’s house very low right above the ground. There is no sound. They are looking for rotor blades, but it’s close enough for him to see there are no rotor blades. After several minutes, the lights rose up very slowly and began to move off into the sky over the trees. September 5, 2008 Then we had a number of reports by independent people in early morning hours of September 5, 2008. We had reports that came in from Allegheny and Westmoreland Counties. One at 12:30 AM was pretty interesting. An eyewitness first observed in the sky in the distance what looked like some kind of fire in the sky above the tree line. Later on, I received another report of something similar. Then the person observed this object that"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"came in the western sky. It was round, glowing white, had flashing red and blue lights at the bottom and as he watched it, the light just suddenly vanished. It was described as if someone turned off a power switch. And then a short time later, a second object appeared to the south. This thing was larger than the other. It appeared to be football-shaped and moved quite fast and began to drop closer to the ground in the distance. With binoculars, the eyewitness could see this was a solid, perfectly round, glowing white object with glowing red, rectangular lights that did not flash. The rectangles were evenly spaced around the outside perimeter. Interestingly, almost at the same time, I received a report from a driver in the South Park section of Pittsburgh in Allegheny County. He was driving through an intersection when all of a sudden he caught these bright lights up in the top corner of his windshield. What ever they were, they were not more than 100 feet above his vehicle. He said the bright lights were evenly spaced. He said the best way to describe it is if you took a normal piece of typing paper and put a bright light at each corner, that would be the best way to mimic what he saw. The lights moved right in front of him right over his vehicle. He said each light was about 3 feet in diameter. The lights did not blink. There was absolutely no sound. At first, he wondered if it were a helicopter, so he put his window down and stuck his head out and there was no sound. He saw the lights go across (in front of him) and he estimated the lights were attached to an object that was maybe 20 feet wide and 50 feet long. At some point, it made a sharp bank and accelerated into the sky above the trees. Then at 2:50 AM (September 5, 2008), from outside Jeannette - again in Westmoreland County - another eyewitness saw a large, orange ball of light moving quite slowly. In fact, he said it was a very clear morning and he estimated the orange light was about 1,000 feet high moving east to west, almost like floating in the sky. He described it close to another eyewitness who said as he watched this thing, it just suddenly vanished right in front of his eyes like somebody turning off a switch. Source of UFO Phenomenon? STAN, YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS AND RELATED HIGH STRANGENESS PHENOMENA FOR 49 YEARS, SINCE YOU WERE 10 YEARS OLD. TODAY, IN OCTOBER 2008, WHAT IS YOUR OWN PERSONAL FEELING NOW ABOUT THE SOURCE OF THE CRAFT, THE ENTITIES AND WHAT IS GOING ON BETWEEN NON-HUMAN ENTITIES AND EARTH LIFE? My feeling on the UFO phenomenon is after you eliminate all the IFOs (identified flying objects), all the cases you can explain away, there is still that percentage of cases you cannot easily dismiss. My feeling has been for quite awhile now that there is no ONE origin for these unexplained phenomena. I think it’s possible that at least a small number of these might be extraterrestrial spacecraft. Some could be unknown natural phenomena. And some of these could be time travelers or could be inter-dimensional. But again, we have a lot of cases over the years we’ve investigated where we have an object, a solid craft, sometimes in broad daylight, where the craft physically changed form to a completely different form; or the craft has appeared and disappeared. Most people, when they are talking about UFOs, they are talking about very large cylindrical-shaped objects, dome-shaped objects, typical flying saucers; the cigar-shaped things; the rectangular objects – and people think they are all 20 to 30 or hundreds of feet in length. But, we’ve had many cases of these very small, spherical objects – a few inches to a foot in diameter, maybe as big as a basketball in diameter. I’ve had cases of these things coming into peoples’ homes and flying around. I’ve had cases of people in cars having their windows down and these spheres going inside the cars and floating around. There was a really interesting case years ago we looked into and a woman reported that one of the small spheres came into her kitchen and was floating around. She got a broom and smacked it. She said it actually split in two and the two separate, spherical objects floated around and went back out the kitchen window and disappeared.” Stan Gordon's Pennsylvania Hotline: 724-838-7768 Stan Gordon's Website: http://www.stangordonufo.com Stan Gordon's Email: paufo@comcast.net"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" C ontinued in Part 2 - “Thunderbird” Sightings in Pennsylvania More Information: I also welcome reports of such Thunderbird or other unusual creature sightings.
