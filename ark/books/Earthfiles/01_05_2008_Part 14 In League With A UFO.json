Out of print. Return to Part 1 January 5, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Chapter 9, Journey to Another Planet, continued. Primed for A Mission T he Aliens told Tim that his three scientist colleagues, who were previously primed for the bodies, were on the Alien craft the same night that Tim was. During that abduction, the Aliens helped the humans get over their fear of doing the abduction assignment the Aliens were preparing for them to do. After the four scientists entered into the new bodies for the abduction mission, they loaded up the van and headed to their destination. Tim was the only one who knew where the group was going. It was a 3-hour drive from the committee's base. The four scientists made two stops before they arrived. Although the newly inhabited bodies did not require food, the Aliens told Tim that the group could eat and function exactly like all other humans on Earth. Part of the experiment was to go among the public and become comfortable. After the scientists arrived in the town of their destination, they rented a room at a motel. The next day they toured the city in their new bodies. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The mechanics of the mission were revealed to Tim during that day. This was a covert operation within a covert operation. The committee members who remained at the base and their superiors had no idea where Tim and the other three members were going or what it was they were going to do when they got there. All the committee members, as well as everyone involved with the program, had a chip embedded under the skin. That chip was the main key to keeping track of all the people in the department (their whereabouts is always known. But the bodies that Tim and the other three were in had no tracking device embedded into them. ) It dawned on Tim that he and his crew were at last free from the watchful eye of his department for the first time in many years. There was no “clean-up crew” following them around. The scientists were free to do anything they desired. If Tim and crew messed up, or were involved in an accident, the Aliens would remove them from the scene in a split second. Tim was told to familiarize himself with the streets and alleys that intersected with the house that they were to enter later that evening. It was still daylight when the group located the house. That gave them a little time to make plans for how the scientists would approach the house without attracting attention to themselves. Working in the host bodies was an incredible experience. The bodies did not require sleep and still sustained optimum energy levels. As the four of them talked among themselves, their only regrets was that they could not keep the bodies they were using. Those bodies were truly temples of God. While in them, the scientists felt no pain, no fatigue and had no nagging desires for any earthly thing humans need, or are addicted to. Food, drink, smoking or sex had no hold on them. There was no experience like it on Earth - it was “complete freedom.” Later that evening, even though none of the four men knew exactly what their mission was, they headed toward their assignment. It was three in the morning when their van pulled into the driveway of the target house. The neighborhood was quiet and most people were asleep. The scientists took care not to make any unnecessary noise. The men entered the house going through the wall (alien technology) that was next to the driveway and the van. Once they entered the house, the group followed Tim, who somehow knew where they all were supposed to go. Tim led them up the stairs and he entered the second bedroom that he came to. Tim instructed two of his cohorts to stay in the hall to watch for any occupants who might get out of bed. If anyone did get out of bed, the scientists’ job was to “stun” him or her. All four of the scientists wore special shoes, which were part of the gear that the Aliens instructed Tim to take. The shoes made no sound and absorbed all sound around them, such as creaking floor boards. The men communicated telepathically to eliminate any possible verbal noise. Inside the bedroom, they found a young boy. He was one year old and sleeping peacefully. The scientists were tasked with placing a small object into the child's nose and one into his ear. Because it was a painful procedure, the men had to paralyze the boy first. Tim knew that when he inserted the objects that the boy could wake up and start screaming. While paralyzed, the boy could not scream, even though he felt pain. The boy did wake up. After the men were through with the procedure, the boy went back to sleep. The child did not remember what took place. It was revealed to Tim while he was still in that bedroom that some humans are prone to develop something akin to an allergic reaction when they come in contact with Aliens, especially if the human subjects are very young. When the Aliens identify a human with that kind of sensitivity, they enlist the help of humans like Tim. By having humans make the first contact and inserting some kind of Alien antihistamine into the human's body, as Tim and his colleagues did, the Aliens are free to come into the presence of those individuals without causing them unnecessary harm. The Aliens have used people like Tim and Bill Smith as intermediaries on Earth for thousands of years. Most people who are abducted do not require that procedure, but those who do number in the thousands. Seconds after Tim accomplished iinserting the implants, three Aliens appeared"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"in the room. Tim had a feeling that the Aliens might drop in, but still their sudden appearance caught Tim a little off guard. There is no rehearsal, no plans or blueprints. Everything that happened took place spontaneously. It was the best security system in the Galaxy. No one could leak information because there was no information to leak. Tim received information telepathically, and it came to him at the very last moment that he required it. Although Tim felt that the Aliens might show up, it was not part of the information that he was given. It was more like Tim felt a hunch. Tim knew that the moment the Aliens did show up, his job was completed and that he and his companions should be on their way back to the committee base. Tim did not know what took place in the boy's room after he and the others left. He assumed that the Aliens took the boy to their spaceship where he would experience his first Alien abduction. On the way back to the base, Tim told his three companions that the Aliens appeared in the bedroom as the men were leaving. Tim asked the others if they were aware that the Aliens showed up. The others were not aware, although the men said each felt a surge of energy in their body during the last few minutes of the operation. After the four men returned to the committee base, their discussion centered about how much the scientists would miss those new bodies. What they had accomplished on their mission was not even talked about. As they re-entered their own human bodies, it was like giving up a finely tuned hot rod and exchanging it for an “old clunker,” as the scientists now called their own bodies. Each man had to take time off to readjust to their old body that seemed to get tired quickly. While the scientists had been in the other bodies, their original human bodies had been kept in the incubator room attached to a system that was similar to cryonics, except that the body was not frozen. The system kept the body alive, but suspended all functions. Tim asked the Aliens if he could remain inside the host body for an extended period of time, “like a few months or so?” The Aliens told Tim that if he or any other human remained inside a host body for more than a few days, the return to their own body would be devastating. Tim asked whether he or other humans could have a host body permanently? If not, was it possible for humans to be fitted with one of those Alien organs that are in the host bodies? The Aliens explained to Tim that if humans were allowed that, Earth would be a Utopia! Turning Earth into Utopia was not yet on their schedule and whether it ever would be one of their tasks was not for the Aliens to disclose. Clones Tim asked the Aliens about clones and whether the non-humans cloned people? The Aliens told Tim that there are many clones on Earth. Aliens that take human form are not using the empty shells of dead humans; the Aliens use human clones. The Aliens clone cells taken from humans who are abducted, people like him and Bill Smith. Tim told the scientists that he had never run into himself and was not sure how he would react if he did. (Doppleganger syndrome.) The Aliens reassured Tim that since there are more than 5.5 billion people on this planet, his chances are slim (that he would run into a cloned copy of himself). This was especially true since the Aliens who reside in those cloned human bodies know when they are in the vicinity of the human from which they were duplicated. The Aliens divulged to Tim how the human clones are used. The Aliens showed how one Alien was able to operate several clones at the same time using telepathy. Each clone performed a separate task, or they could also be made to function in unison. The clones are used as laborers to do mundane and dangerous work such as digging trenches or working in and around nuclear and other exotic sources of energy that Aliens rely upon. Constructing functional infrastructure for villages and communities is another area where the clones have been used. The Aliens also use clones as formidable armies, especially was that true in ancient times, but also now in modern times. Because the clones look and act like the indigenous humans, the Aliens are able to place them anywhere in the world without anyone taking notice. The clones are not robots; they cannot work alone. The clones are under the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"influence and guidance of one or more Aliens who are nearby. The clones could be used and made to function like robots, but it's simpler to use humans. Humans are brought into the program, just as Tim was, because they can function on their own - or if need be, under the control and manipulation of the Aliens. Humans fit perfectly into that category (of controlled, but independent, biological androids). That is why the Aliens use cloned humans. Tim told the Aliens that they gave simple answers to all his questions, even questions Tim thought were much too profound for simple responses. The Aliens confirmed Tim's suspicions and added that many profound questions do have modest explanations. Others are much more than a human mind could ever hope to comprehend. That is why Aliens give naive responses to profound questions. The primary Aliens, “those who seemed to be in charge,” had neither male nor female features. Tim presumed that the Aliens are asexual. Among them, there are beings that looked as if they fit one sex or the other, but it was not made clear to Tim if those are functioning as sexual beings or if it's only “window dressing.” As far as Tim could tell, the bodies that he and the others inhabited (although anatomically correct males) are barren. They were unable to test them because the bodies could not be stimulated sexually. Aliens that looked as if they were patched together from more than one body did exist and so did short ones and long ones, big ones and small ones - like a circus, Tim thought. Some of the Aliens were pale in color. Others were pure black and some were tan. There were metallic ones that walked, while others flew and some hovered. There were humanoids that had the features of humans, but were distinctly not of this planet. There were those that looked very much like humans and could have been, but they never communicated with Tim, so he could not tell. The Aliens told Tim that their kind is only one of many different kinds of Alien species. There are layers of other Aliens that are above them and below them in rank, all with their own special tasks to carry out.
