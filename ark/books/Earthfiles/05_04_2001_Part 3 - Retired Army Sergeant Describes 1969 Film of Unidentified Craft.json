Disc with cupola on top as thick or thicker than disc. Cigar shape. \"Shoe heel \" shape. Crescent shape. Triangular shape. Interview: "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Sergeant Clifford E. Stone, U. S. Army (Retired), Roswell, New Mexico: Disc with Small Cupola On Top and Larger Cupola On Bottom THE FIRST UNIDENTIFIED CRAFT YOU REMEMBER IS? The first one I remember, and I may have them out of sequence, but I believe it to be the disc-shaped UFO with a cupola on top and a cupola on the bottom that is three times thicker than the one that is on top. WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS? IS IT MOVING IN THE AIR? ON THE GROUND? It's moving in the air. Disc with Cupola On Top As Thick Or Thicker Than Disc First of two disk photographs taken on May 11, 1950 at 7:30 PM by Paul Trent of McMinnville, Oregon. Physicist Bruce Maccabee, commercial photographers and the analyst for the Condon Committee at the University of Colorado, 1966-1968, studied the negatives and prints and concluded the photographs were genuine. See: Earthfiles.com 06/19/00, \"The UFO/FBI Connection, Part 2.\" Photograph © 1950 by Paul Trent. WHAT WAS THE NEXT CRAFT? The next craft was circular in shape. Had a cupola on top that was about twice the size of the thickness of the saucer itself. AND WAS THIS IN COLOR OR BLACK AND WHITE? Black and white also. CLOUDS? Not that I can recall. That doesn't mean clouds weren't there. MOVING? We got the impression it was moving. IN THE BLACK AND WHITE FILM, HOW DID ITS COLOR COMPARE TO THE CIGAR? Once again, it was a little shinier. Like you would have a gray tone in the B&W. But it was shinier. Also, it was reflecting on the lead portion - you could catch glimpses every now and then of what I would say would be the sun. Cigar Shape Then you go ahead and fade from that and go to a typical cigar-shaped UFO which the cigar-shaped UFO had no appendages, wings or anything of this sort. I don't remember any windows on it. There was a smoke trail. IN BOTH OF THESE, ARE YOU SEEING THESE IN COLOR? The saucer was in color. The cigar-shaped is in B&W. WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE DISC IN THE COLOR FILM?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"About the color of lead and shiny surface. A SHINY LEAD? It was reflective, but not like shiny aluminum. NOT LIKE SHINY ALUMINUM, BUT LIKE SHINY LEAD? That would be the best way to put it. WHAT DO YOU KNOW THAT IS MADE OUT OF SHINY LEAD? Nothing that I can recall right now, except that this had a reflective surface, a glitter to it is the best way to put it, but it was like a lead color, like the lead of a pencil. OH, I SEE, MUCH DARKER. Ye s . A LEAD PENCIL COLOR, BUT SEEMING TO HAVING GLITTERINESS TO IT INSTEAD OF SHINY REFLECTION? Right. It would reflect sunlight. IN THAT DISC, DID YOU SEE ANYTHING THAT WOULD RESEMBLE PORTHOLES OR WINDOWS? Solid structure. No portholes. Here again, it was in flight. Did not see any openings. DID IT SEEM TO BE MOVING AT A RAPID RATE ON THE FILM? It seemed to be moving at a rapid rate. It's hard to explain. It seemed to be moving - the camera seemed to be moving. There was a clear blue background. You could not see no clouds or anything of that sort. You had the impression that it was moving fast. You didn't see no turbulent of air or anything of that sort. I can't even tell you if there were any portions on the craft that were even moving itself, like something like going around the craft. There were no lights. I do remember that. WHEN YOU GO TO THE CIGAR IN THE B& W FILM, IS IT STATIONARY OR MOVING? I would have to say it was moving also, but it was not easy to make out any detail on it. IN TERMS OF THAT COLOR IN COMPARISON TO THE LEAD PENCIL? Being black and white, it was kind of grayish on the B& W film. That does not mean it was gray, but this one had like a surface a whole lot shinier than what the colored disc would appear. WERE THERE ANY CLOUDS OR ANYTHING TO INDICATE? There were clouds, but they were off in the distance. DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF THE SIZE OF THE CIGAR? No, and at that time we weren't really thinking it was a UFO film. \"Shoe Heel\" Craft THEN WHAT WAS THE NEXT CRAFT? The next craft after that was the heel-shaped craft. The heel shape craft was embedded in the earth. Like the heel of a shoe."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Unidentified \"shoe heel\"-shaped aerial object photographed on July 9, 1947 by William A. Rhodes of Phoenix, Arizona with a box camera. He was at his home when he heard a whooshing sound, got his camera and took two photographs of the object he estimated to be at 1,000 feet. Photograph © 1947 by William A. Rhodes. Once again, don't remember any trees, but you didn't get to see a whole lot of film footage of that. It could have been like the deserts we have right around here. There were several little entities lying around in that film footage. But again, that was only a couple of seconds. You couldn't make out much detail. WAS THERE ANY WAY TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF THE SHOE HEEL? The shoe heel I would say was 35 or 40 feet if it was a complete circle. FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW, IS THIS SIMILAR TO THE CRAFT THAT YOU WERE INVOLVED WITH THE CRASH RETRIEVAL IN PENNSYLVANIA AND THE KEWPER I'VE TALKED WITH YOU ABOUT AND FRANK KAUFMANN, THAT TYPE WE USED IN THE FRANKLIN MINT DESIGN? Yes, the one in the Franklin Mint is more like the heel shape. (See: December 14, 1999 Earthfiles.com Report, Real X-Files Section.) Artist composite rendering of three eyewitness drawings of \"craft of unknown origin\" associated with Roswell, New Mexico © 1999 by Tim Bauer. WERE YOU SEEING THE HEEL SHAPE STICKING IN THE GROUND WITH BODIES IN COLOR OR B&W? Black and white. COULD YOU COMPARE THE COLOR AND TEXTURE OF THE HEEL TO THE OTHER THREE IN ANY WAY? I can tell you on that particular film that the object would have been like a high polish. VERY SHINY. Very, very shiny."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"COULD YOU SEE ANY DETAILS ABOUT THE ENTITIES AROUND IT? No, you saw some which I have to be careful with what I say here, because I could be getting it wrong. But I would say like your typical Grey, like what's been reported by Whitley Strieber and other people who have been abducted. IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM THE PEAR-SHAPED HEAD? Yes, it is. THIS IS YET ANOTHER TYPE? This is another type. But here again, we didn't get to see them that long. The focal point was on the craft. And it was secondary to seeing the bodies. When you start seeing the bodies, they are now fading into the crescent-shaped UFO. Crescent Shape It immediately went from there to what we call to what I call the crescent shape. WHEN YOU USED THE WORD 'CRESCENT,' I THINK OF A CRESCENT MOON. Very similar to like what Kenneth Arnold drew what he saw. Page 162 in photo section of book, The Coming of the Saucers based on description of Idaho pilot, Kenneth Arnold, after watching nine crescent-shaped aerial objects on June 24, 1947 fly \"like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water,\" © 1952 by Ray Palmer and Kenneth Arnold. THE CRESCENT-SHAPED UFO, IS THAT COLOR FILM OR B&W? The crescent-shaped UFO is in color. There are clouds and it's moving at a fast clip. WHAT COLOR DID IT SEEM TO BE? It seemed to be a shiny aluminum, but not as shiny as the crescent shape. HOW EXACTLY DIFFERENT IS IT FROM THE HEEL SHAPE, THIS CRESCENT? The crescent craft is about the shape of like a crescent roll. THAT YOU WOULD EAT. That you would eat. Not as definitive as a crescent moon. Very smooth surface. DID IT HAVE THAT SWALLOW TAIL DEPICTED IN ONE OF KENNETH ARNOLD'S DRAWINGS, OR WAS THAT AN ARTIFACT ADDED BY THE ARTIST? I HEARD THAT IT WAS ADDED. Added by the artist. This had no aerodynamic characteristics or features such as stabilizer or aileron or anything like that. It was just a smooth craft. If we were to make something like that, we would have to put helium in it because it would be a balloon or dirigible. BECAUSE THERE WAS NO TAIL OR AILERONS OR WINGS OR ANYTHING - IT JUST LOOKED LIKE A CRESCENT IN THE AIR. Correct, a controlled surface. Now this did have right in the center of the craft a dark area that I could, I got the impression were windows of a cockpit area."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THE CRESCENT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE HEEL OF THE SHOE CRAFT? It's different in that the 'wings' would be long like a crescent roll. WHEREAS THE HEEL OF THE SHOE IS MORE LIKE A SOLID HORSE SHOE? Correct. IT WAS THE CRESCENT PART THAT CURVED. They would be much larger. This would be a much larger craft. THE CRESCENT IS BIGGER THAN THE SHOE HEEL? The crescent is bigger than the shoe heel. I would say it fit the dimensions of an F-94C. WAS THERE ANYTHING IN THE FILM THAT GAVE YOU THAT IMPRESSION? Why do you think I mentioned an F-94C? WAS IT IN THE SAME FRAME? It was in the same frame. SO YOU ARE LOOKING AT A F-94C THAT IS BEING FILMED CHASING THE CRESCENT? Comes up and flies along side of it. Then goes higher than what the crescent is. The crescent-shaped craft would be 6 or 7 times bigger than the F-94C. When it starts to go up, the crescent-shaped UFO is pulling away from the F-94. The (crescent) drops into frame from above, almost gets parallel to (the jet), but then the F-94 pulls up, but as it is pulling up you can see that the crescent-shaped object is accelerating and pulling away. WHAT HAPPENS? DOES THE FILM CONTINUING FOLLOWING THE CRAFT? Once this happens, the film is complete. The film is shut off. The lights go on down in the auditorium. The guy I told you was talking with the pointer, he comes ahead. Hits the podium with the pointer. At that time, we now know we have people behind us. Intensive Debriefing THEY RUSH YOU OUT THE DOOR INTO A VAN AND WHAT HAPPENS? They take us into the van. Once they put us into the van, they are letting us know that what we did was terrible and we were in a whole lot of trouble. Then they take us to a wooded area. Remember, the van is a panelled van and we have no windows. It is totally dark back there in the back. There is a light but it is purposely turned off and has the bulb missing. They take us to this one story building that is an old wooden frame building that they used to use as offices during the second World War. They put us in a room that has one lamp in it that might have a 15 watt bulb. And we tried to figure out what we had done that was so criminal and why were we being treated like criminals. If it was so classified, why didn't they have some kind of security system there? We still thought we were seeing trailers of science fiction movies and had no idea that these people I now know that what these people were being shown was actual film footage that was taken by the military. (In the briefing), they were showing what if you come up to something like this because there was a possibility that at some time during their career, they might actually be confronted with something like that. What I didn't know was that as a result of this, of the intensified briefing that followed, the airman got out on the evening of the third day after the intensified debriefing. For me it would not be until the evening of the 5th day."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THEY HAD YOU THERE FOR FIVE DAYS? You'll take water because you need that. But, Linda, you'd take sleep over eating. THEY WERE BASICALLY TRYING TO BEAT YOU DOWN AND BRAINWASH YOU? They were breaking you down for a reason. We went there on a Monday. I got back to my quarters on a Friday late evening. The only thing I wanted to do was get some sleep. Well, during the intensified debriefing in the room, you would have two guys that would ask you the same question over and over and over and over again. You had one guy with a clipboard that sat over in the corner. Never uttered a word. He would make notes on the clipboard. I think about it now and remember he used a pencil, not a pen. YOU THINK HE USED THE PENCIL BECAUSE? He was taking notes on our responses. I think what he was doing was more along the lines of a psychologist rating our answers. I think he was using the pencil because he was rating us and upgrading or downgrading depending upon our responses and our reactions to the questions being asked. HE HAD TO ERASE? He had to erase and I know he erased from time to time because I tried to keep my eyes on him trying to figure out who was in charge here.\" More Information: UFOs Are Real, Extraterrestrial Encounters Documented by the U.S. Government © 1997 by Sergeant Clifford E.
