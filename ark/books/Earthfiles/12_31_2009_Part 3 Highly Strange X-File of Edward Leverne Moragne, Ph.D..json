Moragne, Ph.D., Physicist R eturn to Part 1 December 31, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuation of Linda Moulton Howe's May 8, 1997, interview with Edward Leverne Moragne, Ph.D., at his Houston, Te x a s , h o m e : “I N 1964 AT EDWARDS AFB, YOU TOUCHED THE CRAFT ALL OVER AND WATCHED OTHERS TRYING TO BURN AND CUT THROUGH THE DISC'S SURFACE WITHOUT SUCCESS. WHAT ELSE DID YOU DO? Well, I tried a bunch of different acids that didn't do anything. I looked at the landing gears thoroughly. They weren't using hydraulics. It was a screw affair. SCRE WS? Like a turn thing operated from another arm. If one was sliding in one piece like this (demonstrates with his hands) and had a gear turning this up and down - and back here was a screw that turned that gear that brought those arms up and down. I could see a hole just big enough for the footing to go up through there. DO YOU MEAN ONE OF THE TRIPOD LEGS THAT SUPPORTED THE DISC? Yes, they were about 10-feet-long. SO THE THREE TRIPOD LEGS HELD THE BIG DISC UP TEN FEET OFF THE GROUND? Yes. I never did see them come in or out. They just stayed as a tripod support to the craft. The only thing that I saw go back into the disc was the staircase. SO WHEN THE MILITARY TRANSPORTED THE CRAFT FROM THE NEVADA DESERT, THOSE TRIPOD LEGS WERE STICKING OUT EVEN THEN? As far as I know, yeah. And they were still sticking out when they got to Edwards AFB and couldn't fit the craft into a hangar there, so it was hauled to Air Force 5 hangar in southern Nevada. WHAT DID THE SCIENTISTS, DAVID AND DAVIS, TELL YOU THEY LEARNED? It's not like metal as we know metal. It could be another type of material altogether. DID THOSE TWO MEN AGREE IT WAS AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT AND THOSE WERE EXTRATERRESTRIAL HUMANOIDS IN IT AND ON THE GROUND? They'd have to be from outer space somewhere. I got a report from someone in our government on robotics written by a very brilliant Chinese scientist. He worked for NASA. WHAT DID THAT SCIENTIST THINK ABOUT THE ROBOT HYPOTHESIS? He wrote a big article that said the only way we could hope to go to distant planets would be to produce robots that humans could control from Earth or from space stations that we might build in space. SO, THAT'S WHAT YOU, YOUR SCIENCE COLLEAGUES AND THE MILITARY WERE WORRIED ABOUT - THAT THE HUMANOIDS WERE ROBOTS UNDER THE "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CONTROL OF YET SOME OTHER INTELLIGENCE? Yes. They definitely weren't like people. They had to be robots, or androids. [ Robots are mechanical and controlled by outside programming; androids are biological and controlled by outside programming.] YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE THE HUMANOIDS HAD NO BLOOD VESSELS, NO HEART BEAT AND NO BREATHING? We discovered the humanoids had electronic units in their heads that resembled klystron tubes. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? We x-rayed them. The U. S. authorities took the x-rays and I was told the power that had to be put into the x-ray energy would kill a man in a few seconds. But they got pictures and those things looked like klystron tubes in those heads. [ Editor's Note: A klystron tube is used to produce microwave energy. In this application, it works in a similar manner to a pipe organ tube, except that the klystron tube uses electrons, while the pipe organ tube uses air. When the air in the organ tube vibrates, the pipe organ tube emits sound energy of a specific frequency that we hear as a single note. When the electrons in the klystron tube vibrate, the klystron tube emits high frequency microwave energy that can be detected by a radar receiver. Klystron amplifiers have the advantage (over the magnetron) of coherently amplifying a reference signal so its output may be precisely controlled in amplitude, frequency and phase. Many klystrons have a waveguide for coupling microwave energy into and out of the device, although it is also quite common for lower power and lower frequency klystrons to use coaxial couplings instead. Klystron combines a Greek verb referring to the action of waves breaking against a shore with the end of the word electron.] The wiring diagrams looked like they were similar because all the components were similar. YOU SAW THE X-RAYS YOURSELF? Yes. Dr. Graham, head of that military intelligence unit, showed them to me. He told me, 'I can't figure any of that stuff out.' I said, 'Well, in high frequency techniques, we use the klystron tube to send signals out on radar. And they are bounced back and picked up on a Fermi tube. I could give you your picture so it comes back. Then you have to condense it down into whatever form you want.' Dr. Moragne explained that he could make the radar machines show a real picture or just a 'bug,' like the white dots on radar today. Otherwise, we had a screen marked off in miles and if this thing is over here in a 50-mile-zone, they look at it and say it is so many degrees north of here or there and you can see the outline of a ship on there. HAVE YOU EVER SEEN DISKS OR OTHER TYPES OF NON-HUMAN CRAFT MOVING ON RADAR? No, but they showed me videos they had taken, on like what we would call today a camcorder-type device. The government was videotaping in 1964, when the rest of the world didn't know it. WHAT DID YOU SEE IN THE X-RAYS DR. GRAHAM SHOWED YOU? I saw a bunch of electronic parts. I could not tell you what they did because we had no wiring diagram to go by and the x-ray didn't even show the path of whatever wires were there. It just showed components. WHAT KIND OF COMPONENTS? They looked like tubes to me - they might have been metal. They could not have been glass because they wouldn't have showed up in the x-ray. But from the connectors on top of the tubes and on the two sides and the bottom, they looked like klystron tubes to me. YOU USED A KLYSTRON TUBE IN RADAR BACK THEN TO DO WHAT? To put out a beam that was a microwave and it would wave out and come back in. WHAT RECEIVED BACK THE MICROWAVE BEAM?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The Fermi tube. IF THE HUMANOIDS HAD KLYSTRON TUBES IN THEIR HEADS, DOES THAT SUGGEST THEY WERE SENDING OUT RADAR SIGNALS? They were sending a lot of information out of their heads. They could send out 10 million signals at one time with as many tubes as they had in their heads. With only one tube, you can send out several million signals - with each jolt of electricity. For instance, the authorities found that those klystron tubes were so fast and could handle so many signals at one time, that you could feed a bunch of mathematical formulas in there and punch the button and get answers. They really speeded up computation. DID YOU TALK WITH DR. GRAHAM OR DAVID OR DAVIS ABOUT THE BEINGS TRANSMITTING RADAR SIGNALS? You could not say what size or power or if there was one signal a month, a week or anything. DID YOU TRY TO MEASURE THE MICROWAVES COMING OFF THE BEINGS? We tried everything you can think of. We didn't know if it was short wave, short signal, long signal or what kind of signal they were giving off. SINCE 1964, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TOLD THAT LATER MEASUREMENTS WITH BETTER OR DIFFERENT EQUIPMENT CONFIRMED WHAT TYPE OF SIGNALS? I think the government would have turned to other people in NASA in radio signals and computers, not me. When I told them back in 1964 that the x-rays showed klystron tubes in those heads, the authorities asked me why I would say that. I told them the connections looked like they were wired up that way with eight connection points for wires. So I knew those tubes were getting signals from something and sending signals back to somewhere. WHAT DID THE AUTHORITIES TELL YOU? They said that makes sense if you're talking about the radar like we've got. I said, 'I'm not talking about what they DO have in those heads. I am assuming all this.' WHO WAS THE LAST PERSON YOU TALKED TO ABOUT THE CRAFT AND BEINGS? There was an FBI man who went out there. He asked me if I went in a spacecraft. And I told him I sure didn't. He says, 'You didn't go inside of one?' I said, 'Nope, never did.' Then he laughed and said, 'Well we've got information that you did.' I said, 'Your information is wrong. If I had gone inside, I'd be bringing information to you. I wouldn't be hiding it.' I think then he believed me. WHAT DID YOU TELL THE FBI MAN YOU HAD DONE? I told him I was all alone and looked at the craft to see if I could add anything to what they already knew. I said I checked a lot of things and wondered why the humanoids were doing what they were doing. We used hydraulic lifters to raise things up. I also wondered why extraterrestrials would use screws? DID THE FBI MAN TALK ABOUT OTHER CRAFT AND BEINGS? No. YOU HAVE PATENTS IN YOUR NAME, RIGHT? ARE ANY OF THEM RELATED TO WHAT YOU LEARNED FROM THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT AND BEINGS? I have 319 patents. Some relate to weapons systems and some not. But you can't get copies of them now because they are classified. ARE THE WEAPON SYSTEMS TO BE USED ON HUMANS OR SOMETHING IN OUTER SPACE? I can't tell you about that either, but some of them could be used in outer space.” T o be continued in Part 4.
