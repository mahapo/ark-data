October 25, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Since my October 23, 2008, news updates on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory about “Thunderbird” reports in western Pennsylvania gathered by UFO investigator and cryptozoologist Stan Gordon, I have received the following email reports about alleged large sky creatures. 1) Subject: Thunderbird ... I saw one, too, in New England Date: October 24, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “That Thunderbird that people have seen in Pennsylvania, well, I saw one, too, here in New England. About a year and a half ago I saw one and said to the people in my back yard, ‘Hey, there’s a pterodactyl out here! Really it’s huge, I can’t believe it.” Trust me I know this was not a bird of conventional design and I have seen plenty of photos of the prehistoric pterosaurs to know this thing at sight. No joke and I don’t drink. By the time I went to get my camera for a photo, it was gone. I was within 200 yards of it and I know what I saw. I am hearing the replay of your show on Coast to Coast and this is the EXACT same bird that I saw. It was last summer so that would be about 15 months or so ago. I could not believe it at first and I was taken back by it, but I know what I saw – no mistaking that thing. I know it was very real and it had a wing span of at least 15 feet. The very weird thing was that it was up against a pine tree. That is how I approximate the wing span, but it could not fly that way – straight up almost – but it did and it was flying that way. Actually I thought it was resting by holding onto the tree branches at first. After that I went to get the camera, but like I said, it was gone"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"by the time I came back out. Trust me this thing was a monster in size, huge, just huge! The head was same shape as you’d see in a movie, very strange indeed. I thought that I would have to pull out a rifle to get rid of it, it was that large. No one sees a bird that size and doesn’t think of self-protection. I would be a snake for that thing.” 2) Subject: Giant bird near Union City, Tennessee, 1998 Date: October 24, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “Thought you would like to know that I was watching thunder clouds off in the distance (in Union City, Tennessee, west of Nashville) and I saw what I thought was a small plane flying around the top of the the clouds. The wings of the 'small plane' began to flap and I realized it was a bird. It was black and had to be 20 to 30 feet across, its wings. This was in Union City, Tennessee, about ten years ago. I had a black triangle in my front yard also about 300 yards from my house.” 3) Subject: “Thunderbirds” on Coast to Coast AM (Oct 23/24) Date: October 24, 2008 7:11:53 AM MDT To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “I have studied martial arts for a good chunk of my life and have always been partial to the mythology and history of the styles. In Ninjitsu (the Ninja’s art), they believe that they were tested and eventually given their 'powers' (magical, invisibility, shape shifting, etc) by creatures that were half-man and half bird (raven) called 'Tengu.' These man-sized 'demons' (Oni) lived in the forest in large nests at the tops of the tallest trees. A young warrior would enter the forest to challenge one of these creatures and if they were victorious, the Tengu would teach them the 'higher ways' of martial power. Now, as the myth goes these creatures could disguise themselves as 'men' and the Yamabushi (mountain priests) there often thought to be Tengu in disguise. However, the only thing that these creatures could not disguise fully was their beaks, which were seen as an abnormally long nose (like Cyrano De Bergerac). There is even a very old text written by a man named Issai Chozanshi entitled 'The Demon’s Sermon on the Martial Arts (© 2006) .' It is a discussion on martial arts that this warrior 'transcribed' in 1729. The text even says where you can find these creatures (which forest and where....roughly).” [ Editor's Note: Tengu is a mythical creature in Japanese folklore. Tengu are usually described as either red-faced monks with long noses or half-man half-crow with a beak and small wings. Large wing spans are not a normal feature of Tengu.] "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"C enter figure in this Sumerian clay cylinder seal is the Anzu-bird, humanoi d w i th l arge w i ngs.

Sumerian Gods and Goddesses: “The Annunaki are sometimes depicted as humanoid; at other times they are bird-headed with wings. Often they are reptilian in appearance, especially when depicted as warriors. Sometimes they are shown as a combination of several types of entities as they all follow the same patterns that repeat in cycles or loops called Time. The patterns of their battles reflect reality as duality and the same characters play different roles.” More Information: or further information about Thunderbirds, Anzu and other unusual sky creatures, please see Earthfiles reports below in the Earthfiles Archive : • 10/12/2008 — Part 2: Pennsylvania High Strangeness - “Thunderbird” Sightings"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"• 06/08/2007 — Part 3: U.
