Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Triangles Over Wenatchee Valley, Washington, 1966 © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe March 28, 1999 - I have interviewed eyewitnesses about large triangle craft for years. In my book Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume II: High Strangeness (Earthfiles Shop ), I reprinted pages from a government document entitled Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery and Disposal\" classified TOP SECRET/MAJIC EYES ONLY and dated April 1954 by the U. S. War Department. In a section about different kinds of extraterrestrial craft, the U. S. government manual states: \"Airfoil or triangular shape. This craft is believed to be new technology due to the rarity and recency of the observations. Radar indicates an isosceles triangle profile, the longest side being nearly 300 feet in length. Little is known about the performance of these craft due to the rarity of good sightings, but they are believed capable of high speeds and abrupt maneuvers similar to or exceeding the performance attributed to disc or circular (shaped craft).\" In the past few years, aerial triangles ranging in length from 150 feet to 1.2 miles have been described by eyewitnesses all over the world. Could some today be advanced U. S. technology such as the new generation of Aurora craft that include the wedge-shaped Manta? The Manta, however, is said to be small and would not explain the government's own bafflement in 1954 about mysterious triangular craft defined in its own document as \"extraterrestrial.\" Nor would 1990s technology explain what a woman saw in the night sky over the Wenatchee Valley of Washington State in 1966 33 years ago on a camping trip with her daughter. Both want to remain anonymous, but I am very grateful to the mother who is 86 years old now, and was at least willing to tell her remarkable story in her own words. Interview: 86-Year-Old Female (Name Withheld At Her Request) Recalling Night time Sighting in Wenatchee Valley of Washington State in 1966: \"The most incredible thing I've ever seen in my life happened back in 1966 in the fall up in the high Cascades next to one of the beautiful lakes. And I thought, 'Oh, what in the world has ever happened to the moon?!' It was the biggest, reddest moon I'd ever seen. And it was bright red, fire engine red on the bottom and orange in the middle and on the top was a real deep pink. And so big. It was so big. And it was in the saddle of the mountain next to the dip. And I looked back over my shoulder and the moon was still there sailing right along. And I looked back up and thought, 'You have to give me some sign if you are what I think you are.' which I thought was intelligence flying in from outer space. And it stopped dead still wasn't going fast and it stopped dead still and then it slowly sailed away. Well, from then on, I couldn't sleep. And I looked up in the sky and here were these big triangles and before the night was over, and I was up for nearly all the rest of the night and they would change from fluorescent color to blue to green and gone so fast you couldn't even blink that fast. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"YOU WERE SEEING TWO, OR HOW MANY OF THESE TRIANGLES? Well, I was concentrating on watching two because these red dots in comparison to the size of the triangles these red dots look liked they came out of the bottom of the triangles. SO THERE ARE TWO TRIANGLES IN THE SKY AND RED GLOWING DOTS ARE COMING OUT OF BOTH TRIANGLES? Yes, at different times, but I'm going to describe the one furthest to the west and that's the one I first noticed what was happening. And these dots would come out and they were fire engine red and I judged them to be in comparison to the size of the triangle about the size of a fifty cent piece. HOW BIG WAS THE TRIANGLE? I don't know, but the red dots came out and up to ten, one right after the other and they would make what I would call a lazy J because they came down and they always made a little curve to fly away from the line that was coming down. And they would fly to the west. THESE ARE COMING OUT OF THESE TWO BIG TRIANGLES? No. I'm just concentrating on the one. But they would do that with any triangle in the sky. MEANING THAT THESE RED GLOBES OR CIRCLES YOU WERE SEEING AND ARE DESCRIBING NOW ARE COMING OUT OF ONE OF TWO TRIANGLES IN THE SKY? Yeah. The one furthest to the south. And they weren't that far apart. But the one I was watching so carefully. And they would fly away, but they always came down and went to the west and then go from there in every direction over the sky. And one of our jets came by, came over, and they followed that the one followed that back of it and up over. Not over the top of it, but up where they wouldn't be seen. But they followed it clear across the horizon and then came back. And came back and the triangles showed up again because they would blink on and off and come back. And it flew into the bottom of the triangle in the same place that it had come out. But this triangle I don't know how many because they disappeared so fast and come back, I don't know if it was the same triangle, but they dispersed these red -- I called them 'ships,' flying saucers because they were round. They would dispel so many at a time. LIKE DOZENS? Well, I would say up to ten. But the red dots, the ships, the little dots that would go out, would come back one at a time. They didn't come back like all ten at once. It seemed like they were scouting or looking for something. Well, that's what I thought they were doing. WHEN THESE RED, ROUND DISCS WOULD FLY OUT OF THE BOTTOM OF THE TRIANGLE AND THEY WOULD DISPERSE, WHAT WOULD THE TRIANGLE DO AFTER THEY HAD LEFT? Well, it would blink and disappear and come back and blink and disappear and come back. But it always changed colors. It wouldn't disappear until it made these different colors. And then Bingo! it was gone. THEN IT WOULD POP BACK IN? Then it would come back into sight. THERE IS A SECOND TRIANGLE THAT IS DOING SORT OF THE SAME THING? Oh, there were a lot of triangles. They would signal they were signaling back and forth to one another. LIKE WITH BEAMS OF LIGHT? Yeah. And the little red dots put out just as big a beam as the big triangles. And it was just like they were holding a conference. It was terrific! AS YOU LAY THERE WATCHING ALL OF THIS, WHAT WENT"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"THROUGH YOUR MIND? I think I was so excited. I wasn't even thinking about what was going through my mind. I was Oh, I think I was so blessed to be able to see that. I think I was one of the most privileged people. And granted, I was so afraid when I realized when it first started that it wasn't of this earth because as human beings we are so crazed for power that I figured what did come through my mind was I figured that it would have to be from outer space because any country in this world that had that power, that speed, back at that time would have, could have controlled the earth and they would have. I'm sure they would have because that was the fastest thing I've ever seen and the most fantastic. And it went for all night. ALL NIGHT? After they got through with their formation, then they went back like they were - not so much searching, maybe they were getting information or whatever. But it was absolutely wonderful! The next day, we were going up over the ridge and we hit a mountain meadow. And I said, 'Oh, look at this! Look at this circle. And the grass in the meadow had been I would say it was anyway 12 feet across in diameter. It was all crushed down and she said, 'Oh, that's just where the deer slept.' I said, 'Oh, but they don't sleep in a perfect circle.' And I said, 'By the way, where are all the footprints for the deer?' And she said, 'Come on! Come on! Let's get out of here!' She wouldn't talk to me about this trip. LIKE YOUR DAUGHTER WAS NERVOUS? I think she was scared. DID YOU THINK ABOUT THOSE RED DISCS THAT YOU HAD SEEN COMING OUT OF THE TRIANGLE? Did I think of them? Yes, I did and I hoped I would see somebody. But I didn't see anything other than what I told you. Then the next night, when we got into bed it began a misty rain and I looked up in the sky and there were two of those triangles doing like I've seen airplanes do a dogfight dashing at one another but I didn't see any red dots that time. DID YOU HAVE ANY IMPRESSION ABOUT WHETHER THE TRIANGLES DASHING AT EACH OTHER WERE IN CONFLICT OR WHAT? I didn't think about conflict. More, I thought if they were as fast as they could move, surely one could have gotten the other. But they moved at such speed. But they changed lights, too. MEANING COLORS? Colors, yeah. WAS IT LIKE SORT OF PULSING AND CHANGING FROM GREEN TO BLUE TO YELLOW TO WHITE SORT OF? Yes, but it was more like it was from I thought of it as white because when I first saw them the night before it went from like a fluorescent colored light, not white, but like fluorescent. And then it would go blue and then green or green and blue, whichever. It made three definite changes of color and then it was out of sight. THE WHOLE TRIANGLE WOULD PULSE A DIFFERENT COLOR AND THEN THE WHOLE TRIANGLE WOULD CHANGE COLOR AGAIN? It would pulse the three colors and disappear. And when it wanted to, it would come back. And I tell you, it is the experience of my lifetime. Now, I thought it was absolutely wonderful to have my children, my babies, the miracle of that. But it's different. It's one of the things I feel blessed with. YOU DIDN'T FEEL ANY FEAR? Well, not after I got over the first shock, no. BUT THE FIRST NIGHT YOU WERE A LITTLE AFRAID?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"When I first realized that it wasn't from this earth.\" More Information: Fiery orange-red discs were also associated with animal mutilation cases from the end of the 1960s on.
