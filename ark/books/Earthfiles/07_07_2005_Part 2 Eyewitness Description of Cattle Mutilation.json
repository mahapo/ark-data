Interview: Roger Vail, Musician, Mid-West: \"The snake-skin being said they use animal blood and tissues for food. They run the tractor beam down on them and bring the animals up into the ship. They had this big, circular table that had drains, places to drain fluids. They would drain the blood out of it and mix it with a powder, stir it up in like a blender and they'd drink it. Just reminded me of like a bunch of sailors that just found an island to get fresh meat. They were just using the protein to mix with their powder for food. They didn't have any teeth or chewing apparatus. It was more of a sucking-type thing. WHEN THEY MIXED THIS UP, DID THEY EXPLAIN WHAT THE POWDER WAS? No, it looked and smelled just about like the froth you get off of a hamburger when you cook it, you know? Like the spongy stuff that you cook that comes out of hamburger. It looked and smelled just like that. And that's probably what it was. The powder might have been some kind of additive to it. HOW DID THEY GET THE COW OUT OF THE BEAM OF LIGHT AND WHERE DID THEY PUT THE COW? They brought the cow in from up above. I'm not exactly sure how it came in from up above. It just sort of levitated down to the table where they would do certain things with certain machine-type things that would suck the blood out. Then what did not come out through the machines would drain out into the side, like a waste drain. They saved that blood, too. They cut out certain parts of the brain and internal organs and mixed that up in different formulas just using it for food. CAN YOU SEE THE COW STRUGGLING OR MOVING IN ANY WAY IN THE LIGHT? No. It was frozen (paralyzed), limp with all four legs touching. They (beings) proceeded to take these machines and go into different areas of the body and cut them and extract the blood out. What little blood that did drain out was cleaned up. It looked like it might have been a heifer. It was probably about 3 or 4 years old. It was reddish with white spots. YOU'RE WATCHING HOW MANY BEINGS WORK ON THIS COW? Two of them and three are waiting with the powder. IS THE BEING WITH THE SNAKE SKIN AND THE HOODED ROBE STANDING THERE WATCHING? Yeah, he's behind me at this time. I turned around and they stood behind while I watched what they did with the cow. Telepathic Communications About Heifer Blood As Food "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"TELEPATHICALLY, ARE YOU GETTING COMMUNICATION FROM THE TALL BEING OR ANY OF THE BEINGS IN THE ROOM ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE DOING? Everybody! It was like everybody was talking at one time, like dinner was served. He (reptilian being) kept telling me, 'You wanted to know. Here it is.' He was kind of like, 'Can you understand this?' I didn't say much. I just kept thinking like it was the same thing we do when we eat, which was pretty normal. DO YOU SEE ON THE ROUND TABLE THIS 600 TO 800 POUND HEIFER LAYING THERE AFTER THEY HAD USED THEIR EQUIPMENT WITH EXCISIONS FROM HER BODY? There were parts of the cow that were missing. One of the main things they did was something around the mouth. I wasn't completely sure what they did, but it might have been like cutting the tongue area or something and just sort of like vacuuming all the blood out. Then it would go down the tube and they warmed it up. I could see it was being heated up in some kind of heat exchanger type thing and they added this powder to it in like a blender. Then they would drink it, using a straw type, half-inch (diameter) straws. DID YOU HAVE A SENSE, OR DID YOU ASK, OR DID THEY VOLUNTEER COMMUNICATION ABOUT HOW LONG THEY HAD BEEN COMING TO THE EARTH TAKING BLOOD FROM ANIMALS AND USING IT FOR FOOD? No. I didn't ask how long they were doing it. I just asked what was causing all these animal mutilations and that's the basis of what got me aboard. That was it. Then they proceeded to show me around the place and show me different things. ET Communication and Propulsion in Space They showed me the communication banks and showed me how they communicate with others back home through thought processes being amplified out across (space) instantaneously. They compared it with electrostatic fields. They said something about changes in electrostatic fields was immediate. There is no wave action which is not like radio waves. Radio waves are real slow and they don't use radio waves. WHAT DID THEY SAY ABOUT THE CRAFT PROPULSION SYSTEM AND HOW THEY TRAVELED? They said they are using gravity waves and they create gravity waves by having two electrostatic fields turning against each other. That creates a standing gravity wave and they ride the resonance of the standing wave and it just takes away the inertia and doesn't take much energy at all to far surpass the speed of light. Rapid Motion Without Inertia They showed me how the craft moved without the beings inside it feeling any motion when they moved. They would go back and forth. You could see the skyline of the mountains in the Denver area, I guess it would be. It seemed like we went several hundred miles in seconds, but you wouldn't feel any inertia. I thought I was gone for like 15 minutes or so, but the person I was with said I was gone for two hours. DO YOU HAVE ANY RECALL HOW YOU GOT OUT OF THE SHIP BACK TO YOUR MEDITATION STATE? I was just sent back down the tube (of light) and I was standing up and watched the craft go take off. Silver Disc With Spinning Surface COULD YOU DESCRIBE THE CRAFT A BIT MORE? I'd say it was maybe 30 meters in diameter, almost like a standard flying saucer. 10 to 12 meters high and 30 meters in diameter. YOU MEAN IN DIAMETER?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Ye s . SO 30 METERS IN DIAMETER AND MAYBE 12 DIAMETERS THICK? About 100 feet in diameter by 15 to 25 feet thick. WHAT WAS THE COLOR? Silver, shimmering silver. It was like the outside was in constant motion. SO IT WAS SPINNING ON THE OUTSIDE? It was floating, shimmering. I don't know if it was spinning literally, but there was a spinning effect on the skin of the craft. COULD YOU SEE ANY MARKINGS ON THE DISK? No, you could see the main darkened window area where they were looking out about half way up the top part. Underneath was a place where the lights came out. Returned Heifer by Beam Technology to Ground DID THEY SHOW YOU AN IMAGE IN YOUR MIND OF THEM PUTTING THE COW BACK DOWN IN THE BEAM? Yeah, when I asked what they did with the animals after (taking blood and tissues), I just sort of got a telepathic flash of the light beam taking them back down and dropping them from about ten to twelve feet above the ground. I just thought they would drop them out (of the craft) and the animals would have damage from falling from huge heights. but I guess in that ten to twelve feet, they don't have that much damage. DID YOU ASK THEM SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHY THEY CONCENTRATED ON CATTLE? I didn't ask them, but it's something that the amount of blood in the size of the animal was more efficient. There was plenty of blood (in cows) with the right kind of protein. Different ETs, Different Mutilation Agendas? I WONDER THEN WHY THERE ARE SO MANY CAT AND DOG MUTILATIONS AS WELL? Those may be different beings. They did mention others. I asked them what other kind of beings were doing here. They told me to watch out for the small yellow ones. They kind of said, or I got the sense that everybody is not like them. They didn't operate on me (in an abduction). DID THEY SHOW YOU A PICTURE IN YOUR MIND WHEN THEY SAID, 'SMALL YELLOW ONES'? CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT THAT IS? I hate to say it but it was more like Chinese person almost like an automaton, mindless, soulless type being that didn't care about life. WHY WERE THEY HERE? They didn't say why. They just said watch out for them. They didn't specifically say they were from outer space or here already just that there were different kinds of beings. Some are good and some are bad, just like there are all different kinds of humans. That's what they communicated to me. ANYTHING ELSE YOU WOULD WANT THE EARTHFILES AUDIENCE TO KNOW? When people are having a difficult time believing that things are happening, just to know I didn't believe it until it happened to me. As soon as it happens to you, you just can't convince anyone else. It's like you are on the other side of the fence immediately. It puts a strain on you because you're te lling what happened to you, but for people because it didn't happen to them, they don't think it exists.\" More Information:"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"For more information about the animal mutilation and non-human entity phenomena, please see books An Alien Harvest and Glimpses of Other Realities, Volumes I and II listed in Earthfiles Shop.
