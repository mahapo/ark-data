Digital image © 2008 by Penny Rubsam. January 29, 2009 Reno, Nevada - The morning after my December 17, 2008, three hour news broadcast on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory , I received the following email from Penny Rubsam - a Reno, Nevada, resident - along with several photographs she had taken on December 10, 2008, after 9 PM Pacific over the Washoe Valley south of Reno. Penny is 52-years-old, has lived in Reno for twenty-three years and moved to her current home in 2005. Her photographs are very similar to the videotape by David Caron near the Stephenville, Texas, Airport on January 19, 2008. [ See a hot link to David Caron's videotape in the Stephenville section of this report below and other Earthfiles report links in More Information at the end of this report.] What are these multi-colored light patterns on video and still cameras? The Caron video (hot link after Reno images) shows an out-of-focus, disc-shaped object hovering in the sky from which the multi-colored patterns begin projecting outward for several minutes, changing shape every one-half second on the 30-frames-per-second videotape. Some dismissed the Caron videotape as an electronic glitch in his digital video camera. But the other multi-colored light patterns in the variety of geographical regions have all been photographed with digital still cameras. The Reno, Nevada, resident says in her email below, “I do know the light was there for several days before I photographed it.” R ed circle is Reno, Nevada. Straight south, the red star is the location of Washoe Valley. “Subject: Object Over Reno Date: December 18, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Hello Linda, I love your work and I thought that I would share this info with you to see if you might be interested. The photos were taken Dec. 10th, 2008, Wednesday night, and it was after 9:00 p.m. My daughter helped with this as she had just come back from visiting her boyfriend and saw me hanging off the second floor balcony. This angle looks southeast over the Washoe Valley. I haven't taken time to travel around the valley to see if the angle changes, too busy for Christmas. I do know the light was there for several days before I photographed it. The clouds are up and I can't tell if it's around now. But I can say the last time the night sky was clear, it was still there. My daughter and I had noticed a rather bright light over the Reno valley for several days. Thinking it may be a star we fairly ignored it until we noticed that it seemed to have different colors showing, but it was still hard to see. I finally photographed the mysterious light with my digital camera and was surprised to see colored light patterns similar to the ones that were taken in Stephenville, Texas during the mass sighting events in January 2008. I will attach the photos. I did take several shots and I also took shots of stars in the distance to judge if I were jiggling my camera around. That was not the case. The stars in the shots are just bright spots, but the object in question was squiggling all over the place. Last time I looked out the window this thing was still sitting over the valley. I cannot determine how far up it is though. Thanks for your time.

The camera has 4 megapixels and a zoom lens 8-24mm 1:2.8-4.9. Earthfiles did not enlarge any image, but cropped around each light pattern where there was a lot of black sky so the image of the pattern itself would be as large as possible without Photoshop enlargement.

You al so hear Davi d Caron speak peri odi call y with another person in the house. At one point, the two discuss that the pulsing multi-colored patterns in the sky look like “hieroglyphs.” [ Hundreds of image patterns in several minutes of digital videotape in which the pattern is changing twice a second.] The Caron videotape and the Reno photos are also very similar to other photographs taken in: Glen Rose, Texas, on January 20, 2008 O ne of many pulsing symbols watched by Joan of Glen Rose, Texas, at 5:30 AM Central, on January 20, 2008, seven hours after David in Stephenville videotaped pulsing symbols for nearly 13 minutes.

It was just something that you look up and see something that is unique and you know you have not seen something like that there before. The appearance of it was maybe a week or two before my photographs [December 10, 2008, after 9 PM Pacific, over the Washoe Valley south of Reno]. WHAT WAS UNUSUAL THAT CAUGHT YOUR ATTENTION? Oh, the different colors! You can look up in the sky and you can see white stars. You can see some that sparkle and you can see some stars that really super sparkle. But when you look up and see something that is sparkling brilliantly in red, blue and a green color. This is what I see. And I have seen this same thing a couple of times before in this location. DID YOU PUT THE CAMERA ON THE EDGE OF THE DECK OR ANY PLACE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT WAS STEADY? I did all of the above – in my hands, braced on the edge of the balcony, which is a large stucco wall. ANYONE WHO SAID THIS MUST BE SOMEBODY JIGGLING THE CAMERA – THIS WOULD NOT EXPLAIN IT? Right, and that’s why when I noticed that there were the other two stars in the background that were solid, that’s what was very interesting, I thought. This is a camera also that I use professionally for my business. I could see the stars off in the distance situated on either side of the flashing light. I knew that it was important if this were something other than a star, that I should photograph the stars for contrast [ to the multi-colored, changing patterns.] So, I did go out of my way to take the larger wide shot to get those two stars and then I just sort of cropped the photo down so you could see the two stars on either side. Penny Tested Her Nikon Cool Pix 4300 Camera In order to establish that her camera is not putting abnormal points of light or patterns on her digital images, I asked her to keep the lens cap on and click three times to see if any of the images had aberrations. Penny's camera results below are solid black frames."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Here again is one of her December 10, 2008, Nikon images she took of the colorful, pattern- changing object in the middle and two solid, unmoving stars she could see with her naked eye in the corners.

Image © 2008 by Penny Rubsam. WHAT WAS THE TIME, DO YOU THINK, BETWEEN EACH PHOTOGRAPH? Maybe about five or ten seconds because it is a digital and takes a little longer to recover between shots. WHAT WERE YOU SEEING WITH YOUR EYES AND WHAT WERE YOU SEEING WHEN YOU LOOKED THROUGH THE CAMERA? With my eyes, I simply saw a brilliant, out of the ordinary sparkle on an object that had different colors. I could actually see red and blue and green. Then with the camera, the same sort of thing. I could see the same sparkling. At the distance, it was a little difficult, which is why I ended up blowing up the shots. So, I would say it mostly looked the same through the lens as it did to my eyes."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"FROM THE VERY FIRST NIGHT THAT YOU STARTED PHOTOGRAPHING, HOW MANY MORE TIMES HAVE YOU SEEN THIS SPARKLING, PROJECTING COLORS OBJECT? AND HAVE YOU TAKEN MORE PHOTOS? I saw it a couple more times [four times in December 2008]. Why Aren't Military, Police or Homeland Security Scrambling After Aerial Unknowns? THE FACT THAT THIS HAS BEEN REPEATING AT LEAST FOUR TIMES IN DECEMBER, DO YOU FIND IT ODD THAT THERE HAVE NOT BEEN SCRAMBLED JETS OR HELICOPTERS AROUND THIS OBJECT? Well, yes! (laughs) I find that rather odd. But I get the sense that there is quite a bit up there. (laughs) You know, it’s there! They are there and why hasn’t anyone noticed? Why isn’t anyone saying anything? I mean, it is so obvious there are things there! AND WHAT IS IT DOING? I don’t know! It’s watching (laughs). I don’t know. All I know is that there are too many people seeing too many things, taking tons of photographs and videos. So that old argument doesn’t sit well any longer – ‘Why isn’t anyone taking pictures?’ Well, they are! They are everywhere. I’m a very logical person and I understand the logic of science. But I have gone past that into, ‘Oh, there’s other stuff. I better open up my mind to something here.’ IN THE FOUR TIMES IN DECEMBER 2008, THAT YOU HAVE BEEN AT YOUR HOME ON THAT DECK AND WATCHING THIS STRANGE OBJECT PROJECT THE MULTI-COLORED PATTERNS, DID YOU EVER FEEL NERVOUS OR AFRAID? No, never. It was more of a curiosity like, ‘Gee, what’s that? What’s it doing there?’ HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO CALL THE POLICE OR FEMA OR ANYBODY ...? No, no! WHY NOT? I would think their job would be to protect us and we are not being harmed, but I honestly don’t think they would believe a word I said. This would not matter to them because they have more important things to do. The governments have to know it’s happening and they are helpless and it’s getting more and more so. They can’t stop whatever is happening. AND THE FACT THAT JETS AND HELICOPTERS HAVE NOT SHOWED UP ONCE AT THE FOUR SIGHTINGS OUTSIDE OF YOUR RESIDENCE WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TO WATCH FOR MINUTES SOMETHING IN THE SKY THAT IS CLEARLY NOT SOMETHING ASTRONOMICAL IS A COMMENT ON THE GOVERNMENT HAVING KNOWLEDGE IN ORDER NOT TO SCRAMBLE. Yes. There are too many records now. It’s like everything is being recorded. People aren’t so afraid to speak up. My lack of wanting to call the police is not so much on fear of ridicule – because it doesn’t matter to me anymore, you know, I’ll speak openly on whatever. It’s mostly that I know there is nothing the government can do.” I f anyone else in the Reno and Washoe Valley, Nevada, region or any other locations has seen and/or photographed these changing, multi-colored light patterns, please contact: earthfiles@earthfiles.com .
