She is a founding member of the Center for Crop Circle Studies and Chairman of the Unexplained Phenomena Research Society in the U. K. She is currently coordinating research into the effects of electromagnetic fields on living matter and has over six hundred reports in her data base.

One such event goes back to 1981 in Westbury, Wiltshire. Retired aircraft engineer, Ray Barnes, told Lucy that his attention \"was first drawn to a wave or line coming through the top of the cereal crop\" as if some invisible object or force was touching all the seed heads making them jiggle, but not bending over. In addition, \"there was absolutely no wind, and the speed was constant. The line just appeared moving across the wheat and there was no disturbance of hedge or trees at the field boundary. The line almost disappeared where the ground dips so it would seem it was maintaining a constant height irrespective of ground contour. ... After traveling across the field at an arc, the 'line' dropped to the ground and radially described a circle in a clockwise direction in approximately four seconds. ...The crop in the circle went down as neatly as if it had been cut by a giant cookie cutter.\" The crops stayed flat to the ground. None sprang back. And that was ten years before the infamous hoaxers, Doug and Dave. In the1990s, biophysicist W. C. Levengood has studied hundreds of plants that show fundamental biophysical and biochemical changes that can not be hoaxed. This week, as her new book was released in North America, I talked with Lucy Pringle by phone at her Petersfield, Hampshire home about her research and Dr. Levengood's hypothesis that a spinning plasma vortex interacts with the plants. Interview: Lucy Pringle, Crop Circle Investigator and Author, Petersfield, Hampshire, U. K: \"You get this huge, enormous force that is not dissimilar to ball lightning. We don't know an awful lot about ball lightning. But as a result of this force that hits the ground, softens the plants at the base, we get microwave activity. What we don't know and what we can't explain and I think is the reason why we're still here examining this particular phenomenon, what is the guiding hand? Whose guiding hand is behind these formations of the enormously and increasingly complex shapes? Yes, and what is creating the spinning plasma vortices? Well, this is something that we don't have an answer to. I think this is part of the mystery. But also what is extremely exciting as far as I'm concerned is that my particular part of research for the past decade has been looking into how the electromagnetic fields or microwave radiation affects living systems. By that, I mean what happens to you and me and other animals when we go into genuine crop formations and what happens to inanimate objects such as videos, cameras, mobile telephones? It's been very fascinating. (Equipment shuts off and batteries drain down quickly.)What seems to be happening is that we know microwave radiation disrupts the central nervous system. What we don't know is the degree of disruption to the central nervous system and this is something that needs intense and much greater research. This takes us into areas of mobile telephones. Are they safe? There has been a lot of research done at Bristol University which indicates that they could possibly be a danger. In order to get this subject to stand up to the scrutiny of mainstream science, we have to have definitive figures. And we've got to be able to have tests that we can repeat year after year. And one thing that has shown up quite clearly is that our hormone systems is being affected when people go into genuine crop circles. And I keep on saying 'genuine' crop circles because we know that there are hoaxed ones and I've done scientific tests in the hoaxed ones. We don't get any of the scientific results that we get in the genuine ones. But going back to the hormone situation, this is exciting because we are getting definitive figures. We are getting repeatable figures. It's showing that melatonin is being increased which shows us that our pineal gland is being stimulated. The thyroid is affected which says that our pituitary gland is being affected. And the pituitary is actually the master gland which governs our whole endocrine system."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"We now know that there are impacts on humans, plants, soil, and animals. We also know this has been going on for decades, maybe centuries. But starting in 1990 and going through that decade, there has been an increasing proliferation around the world with greater complexity. At this juncture, even though no one has definitive answers, what is your own particular sense of what could be the intent in all this? Yes, I have a sort of gut feeling that it's communication. Over the years, we have sent up messages to Mars and other places in order to try to establish communication. We send up universal language like binary and the signs of male and female hoping they will be a universal language. I think the complexity - again, this is just a very personal observation or belief. Say, you know, when you are having a conversation with somebody and say they look enormously bored and their eyes start to glaze over, you very quickly change the subject. Or else, you move on and talk to somebody else. On the other hand, if you talk to somebody who is enormously interested in what you're saying, you expound, you elaborate, you go into greater depth. And this seems to me that the phenomenon is responding to human interest. Here, again we get the interaction of consciousness between humans and other intelligences. And I think the impact - the interest started to expand tremendously in 1990. And that was when these shapes started developing. And they became more and more complex and the interest grew. The investigation became more intense. More and more people were drawn into the phenomenon. Many (scientists) are fearful because this isn't accepted by mainstream science. They are fearful of their career prospects and that's why I have tremendous respect for Dr. Levengood who has shown his colors. He has been published in respected science journals. Absolutely. His hypothesis that spinning plasma energies are interacting with the plants and soil seems continually to be reinforced by new physical data. Isn't it ironic that in 2000 possible contact by another intelligence has focused on the earth's cereal crops? Further, that a story about two elderly gentlemen in southern England named Doug and Dave would have been accepted by mainstream media in 1991 as the explanation for a worldwide phenomenon. Why do you think that happened? (laughs) Well, I think the main reason for that is there was a general hysteria in England. It had reached almost fever pitch. And I think the powers that be were very frightened of this. They were frightened of the implications. If these are not manmade, then by whom or what? The intelligence behind it. What was going on? That's like the UFO scenario. This seems to be an area that is not supposed to be discussed, which I think is a very great mistake and the more you cover something up, the more likely it is to have frightening implications to people. I think this is what was happening. They tried to put a lid on it. And indeed, they were largely successful. I know my telephone calls was absolutely red hot. What's interesting is the complete dichotomy: 50% of people said, 'Thank goodness for that. Now we've got an explanation. Thank goodness for that.' Another 50% said, 'Could this be true? Could this really be true?' And I said, 'No, it can't possibly be true. You only have to look at the logistics. It's happened all over the world. All over England on the same night.' These two men had only claimed doing circles in two counties in southern England. That's right, but it took on. And I think a lot of people - if they don't understand something, they are extremely fearful. There are many people who can take this subject on board. And I just wish more people could take it on board without being fearful because if you read the Bible and other parallel histories in India"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"and going back right to the dawn of our civilization - you will hear stories that are really talking about visitors coming to this planet from somewhere else. Now, clearly they would have to have enormously good technology, far in advance of anything we have. And they could annihilate us. The very fact they haven't done so over the ages says to me that these visitors are beneficial. And we have many indications in books written about all strange things that have happened, all the technologies that appeared in the early days, that appeared from nowhere, to civilizations who up until that time had been primitive. And suddenly, they became advanced over night. How did that knowledge come? Who brought it with them? Where did those people go? It might even extend into other dimensional frequencies, time travel, other incomprehensibles to current human society. But if we don't open up our minds to all of the possibilities that could be behind this phenomenon, we could deny ourselves the ability to ultimately understand it. I think you're absolutely right. I mean, we must consider that there are parallel worlds, other dimensions and these again are not frightening things. Just as all the various levels of consciousness within our own physical. And again, I think you are absolutely right that we have to open our minds. We're dealing with issues which are introducing a new aspect to science, but they are also introducing a very spiritual level. I think science without the spiritual level or without the heart is a very empty thing. And we need to bring in our spiritual aspects and understand that we are very small beings in a very enormous universe. And this I think is one of the extraordinary things. I've heard it so often. I've experienced it myself. And it's what I call the 'cathedral effect.' When I go into certain formations, I feel that I'm in the presence of Something or Somebody enormous. Just like when you go into a cathedral. You go in and treat it with enormous respect. And you feel strangely humble in the presence of something pretty awesome and pretty almighty. What are you expecting to happen in the fields in 2000? I don't know! Each year I try and think of something that is going to happen. Each year I can't begin to match what actually appears. It takes us all by surprise. The ingenuity, the awesome geometry, the size, the imagination is quite beyond the scale of human minds. So, I don't know.\" More Information: See the Earthfiles.com Shop to order Lucy Pringle's new book and her new 2000 calendar.
