That was the thing that was the most disturbing because he showed me a progression through time. The whole scene was so disturbing that I remember when I got home, I just laid down on my bed and started crying because I was really, really afraid. I couldn’t believe this was actually going to happen. But we’ve seen a lot of these things already take place. Some haven’t yet because it isn’t time for those. CAN YOU GIVE SCENES OF WHAT YOU SAW PLAYED OUT IN THE BLACK CUBE AS OUR FUTURE - WHAT YOU’VE ALREADY SEEN OCCUR AND WHAT IS YET TO UNFOLD? What I was seeing in the black cube was first a picture of the Earth as though we were in orbit. While in orbit, I was seeing the Earth revolving like a big, 3-dimensional blue marble. I could see there were areas that were being shown to me where there were massive amounts of contamination. The things that were happening to people – they were being poisoned by industrial compounds, being poisoned by things in the water. Water was starting to become just bad and the air was becoming bad. And this was taking place in time a little later because that was 1969. And as I’m watching this, I’m seeing that in the next ten years (1970s), the pollution increased. It was shown to me the impact all this contamination was having on the human condition and the planet. It progressed, slowed down and then came back in different places. I was seeing things in China and the United States and Europe and all over the world. The next thing that was shown to me that I remember so clearly in a newspaper and the newspaper says, ‘The World Goes To Riyadh’ (capital of Saudi Arabia) and the date on the newspaper was December 1991. Then I was shown gas fields and the flames and the war and all the things we are familiar with now. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “ The Persian Gulf War (August 2, 1990 to February 28, 1991. On January 16, 1991, at 1900 EST, the George H. W. Bush White House announced that ‘the liberation of Kuwait has begun!’ The Gulf War was a conflict between Iraq and a coalition force from 34 nations authorized by the United Nations and led primarily by the United States (Pres. George H. W. Bush) and the United Kingdom in order to return Kuwait to the control of the Emir of Kuwait. The conflict developed in the context of the Iran-Iraq War and in 1990 Iraq accused Kuwait of stealing Iraq's oil through slant drilling. The invasion of Kuwait by Iraqi troops was met with immediate "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"economic sanctions against Iraq by some members of the UN Security Council, and with immediate preparation for war by the United States of America and the United Kingdom. The expulsion of Iraqi troops from Kuwait began in January 1991 and was a decisive victory for the coalition forces, which took over Kuwait and entered Iraqi territory. Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq, Kuwait, and bordering areas of Saudi Arabia. Iraq also launched missiles against targets in Saudi Arabia and Israel in retaliation for their support of the invading forces in Kuwait. U nited States military personnel search through rubble after a U. S. Army warehouse was hit by an Al-Hussein missile in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, on February 25, 1991. Original 1991 image source www.army.mil. March 2003 George Bush Invasion of Iraq - Riyadh compound bombings took place on May 12, 2003, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. These suicide attacks, attributed to al-Qaeda, were the first of several “spectacular attacks” carried out by that group in 2003, and the deadliest attack on Americans that year. Altogether, some 35 people were killed, and over 160 wounded. A smaller campaign of insurgency in Saudi Arabia had started in November 2000 when car bombings were carried out targeting and killing individual western expatriates in Riyadh and other cities.] R iyadh compound bombings took place on May 12, 2003, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. These suicide attacks, attributed to al-Qaeda, were the first of several “spectacular attacks” carried out by that group in 2003, and the deadliest attack on Americans that year. Image by U. S. State Department employee. DO YOU MEAN THE FIRST BUSH SENIOR'S IRAQ WAR AFTER IRAQ'S INVASION OF KUWAIT? Exactly. And I didn’t even know what Riyadh was in 1969. The war was supposed to take place in December 1991, because that’s what was the date on that newspaper. When did the first American war against Iraq happen? JANUARY 16, 1991. So, apparently it was earlier on the time line because the newspaper was near Christmas in 1991. [ William and I discussed the possibility that the black cube newspaper date was Christmas 1990, less than a month before the January 16, 1991, American attack on Iraq. He said it's possible, but that December 1991 is"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the date he thought he remembered seeing in the black cube.] SO, IN EARTH'S REALITY, THAT IRAQ WAR ACTUALLY HAPPENED NEARLY A YEAR EARLIER IN TIME THAN THE CUBE SHOWED YOU? Yes, and I was with Zo in the craft in 1969 seeing the December 1991 newspaper date in the black cube. I’ve never forgotten the word ‘Riyadh’ because when the world goes to Riyadh, that’s when all the war stuff starts - I think three wars in the Middle East. Zo and the black cube conveyed to me, ‘After the 1991 war, you’ve got 18 years.’ Another Middle East War in 2009? 1991 PLUS 18 YEARS IS 2009. WHAT HAPPENS IN 2009? I don’t know exactly. The black cube showed what happens in the future is another war eighteen years after the first Iraq war of 1991 - something bigger and worse than we’ve ever seen, unless humans seek peace and change the time line. SO, THE CURRENT GEORGE W. BUSH IRAQ INVASION OF 2003 MARCH TO 2008 AND ONGOING – IS THIS THE SECOND WAR YOU WERE SHOWN IN IRAQ? Yes, I saw this one, too. SO, IN THE BLACK CUBE YOU WERE SHOWN THE FIRST WAR IN THE REYADH, SAUDI ARABIA REGION WITH A DECEMBER 1991 START DATE. THEN YOU WERE SHOWN A SECOND WAR – DID IT SHOW IRAQ? Yeah, it showed that part of the world. DID THE BLACK CUBE HAVE A DATE ON THE SECOND WAR AS WELL? It did, but I have to admit that when I saw people hanging out of cars burning up, that just kind of flipped me out and I was not paying attention to dates. OK, WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF THE THIRD WAR AND WHAT WAS THAT DATE? It was eighteen years later in 2009. There is something nuclear that takes place. One of the things I saw in the black cube was an aircraft carrier and I saw there was something that happened that caused nuclear missiles going back and forth and this whole mess that pulled the whole world into it. THE MISSILES WERE GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN WHICH COUNTRIES? I think it must have been Israel. YOU THINK THAT BECAUSE? Its proximity to the mass of water that I saw. They didn’t show me a newspaper with this. Instead, they were showing me conflict and taking advancing steps every time it occurred until it got to this one event. Then there were nuclear weapons going back and forth and then there were things that started happening in the United States that were not good either. It just became an awful mess! ISRAEL IS LAUNCHING THE MISSILES? I think so. WHAT ARE THE TARGETS OF ISRAEL? I think Iran. ISRAELIS ARE ATTACKING IRAN IN 2009. WAS ANY MONTH GIVEN? I remember it was in the springtime. SPRING OF 2009. AND WITH THE LAUNCH OF MISSILES FROM ISRAEL"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"TO IRAN POSSIBLY, WHAT DID THE UNITED STATES DO? They were fighting back. That’s when things started happening here. It’s like everything happened at once in all these different places. WHAT DID YOU SEE HAPPENING IN THE UNITED STATES? Not good things. One of the things that was frightening to me was like the police were keeping all the people controlled. There weren’t a lot of people traveling around and then suddenly there were all these different explosions in different cities. And the only thing I’ve seen that reminds me anything of what I saw in the black cube is the TV show, Jericho. That’s kind of a similar scenario that I saw. MEANING THERE WERE MISSILE ATTACKS ON THE U. S.? No. They weren’t missile attacks. Whatever was being exploded was already here. SO, IS MARSHALL LAW APPLIED COAST TO COAST AND BORDER TO BORDER? OR ONLY IN SPECIFIC PLACES? I think it was only specific places. But there was enough martial law that you could not go any place. The black cube gave me the impression that the place to go was near the equator down south because that would be safe – there and south of the equator. North of the equator it would not be safe. The reason was because of the prevailing wind flow. ARE YOU WAITING FOR ZO TO RETURN TO TAKE YOU AND YOUR FA M I LY AWAY ? No, I was already offered that, but I turned it down. WHY? That’s not why I came here. I came here to help out as best I can. I do healing and try to bring people up to speed about what they can do to further their spiritual evolution and increase their awareness. IF YOU HAVE MADE A COMMITMENT TO STAY ON EARTH AND WE’RE ONLY A YEAR FROM A NUCLEAR WAR THAT STARTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND SPREADS TO MARSHALL LAW IN THE UNITED STATES, WHAT ELSE WERE YOU SHOWN IS GOING TO HAPPEN? There’s sickness and country-wide confinement. Meanwhile, technology goes forward. They told me that things could change and that was one of the reasons for showing me these things. And we should actively be trying to bring about changes if we wanted to avoid that kind of future. But past a certain point, the future would be decided to go in one direction or another. As I was aboard the ship in 1969, what I was shown in the black cube was the direction the world was going. But the future could be changed. WHAT DID ZO COMMUNICATE TELEPATHICALLY WOULD BE NECESSARY TO DIVERT THE NUCLEAR FATE? People would have to stand and be counted for wanting change to occur to demand peace. The thing I think is most remarkable is that the last time I saw Zo – or I was supposed to see Zo – he never showed up. It was when I turned 48-years-old on September 11, 2001, Zo never showed up. But that’s when the Twin Towers came down. I took that as a pretty dramatic signal of the way the world had decided to turn. NOT GOOD. Not good. And it’s not been anything but bad since then.” C ontinued in Part 6 More Information: For further information about the human abduction syndrome, please see my books and documentaries in the Earthfiles Shop and in the Earthfiles Archive:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"• 05/20/2008 — High Strangeness in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada • 04/29/2008 — Part 1: Insights from An Experiencer with Greys and Blond Humanoids • 04/06/2008 — Final Part 10: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 04/02/2008 — Part 9 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/30/2008 — Part 8 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/20/2008 — Part 7 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/15/2008 — Part 6 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/08/2008 — Part 5: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/04/2008 — Part 4: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/03/2008 — Updated Part 1: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/02/2008 — Part 2: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/02/2008 — Part 3: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 02/22/2008 — Updated: Three Eyewitnesses in Selden, Texas, Saw Two, Large Rectangles of “White Flames” in Sky • 02/14/2008 — Update: Mysterious Symbols Projected in Night Sky by Aerial Disc Near Stephenville, Texas, Local Airport • 02/08/2008 — Law Officers Describe Unidentified Shape-Shifting Aerial Craft in Stephenville, Texas, Region • 01/28/2008 — Updated 01-28-08: Viewer Letters About Aerial Craft and Military Flyovers Above Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas • 01/18/2008 — Updated: Huge Aerial Craft Over Dublin, Texas, “Longer Than 3 Football Fields” • 01/07/2008 — Part 15: In League With A UFO • 12/22/2007 — Part 10: In League With A UFO • 12/16/2007 — Part 8: In League With A UFO • 12/14/2007 — Part 7: In League With A UFO • 12/11/2007 — More Confirmation of May 1974 Discs in Albuquerque and Huge Cylinder Craft At White Sands Provi ng Ground. • 11/25/2007 — Part 4: In League With A UFO • 09/16/2007 — Part 5: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/11/2007 — Part 4: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/07/2007 — Part 3: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/05/2007 — Part 2: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 08/31/2007 — Part 1: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured! • 08/31/2007 — Part 2: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured! • 08/30/2007 — Part 1: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 07/31/2007 — Part 2, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards • 06/26/2007 — Part 1: Explanation of the Recent \"Strange Craft\" Sightings • 05/11/2007 — CIA Origin of National Enquirer? • 03/16/2007 — Tenth Anniversary of March 1997 Phoenix Lights: What Was the 2-Mile-Long Triangular Craft? • 02/18/2007 — Part 4: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 02/15/2007 — Grey Non-Human Floats in Air At New Orleans Defense Contractor Site • 02/14/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 02/12/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 02/11/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 01/26/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/26/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/26/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/08/2007 — Updated: Attorney Describes His Encounter with Non-Human Entities • 12/14/2006 — Abductee Jim Sparks's Encounter with Reptillian Beings, Their Warning and Possible Agenda • 10/11/2006 — Part 2: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee • 10/08/2006 — Part 1: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee • 09/29/2006 — Manipulation of Time and Matter by Non-Humans: The Experiences of Jim Sparks • 09/05/2006 — Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet? • 09/04/2006 — Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet? • 07/28/2006 — 1940s USAF Flight Surgeon's Account of E.
