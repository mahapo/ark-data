Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Evolution of Crop Patterns Near Britain's Chilbolton Radio Telescope Observatory, 1999 - 2002 © 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe December 7, 2002 Chilbolton, England - As I have investigated and reported about crop formations since 1991, I began to wonder if the patterns were connected over arcs of time at the same geographic locations. One example of what seems to be patterns related to each other year after year occurred near the Chilbolton Radio Telescope Observatory between June 1999 and August 2002. June 16, 1999, Chilbolton Observatory On June 16, 1999, the strange pattern in the foreground marked by a yellow arrow appeared near the observatory. The yellow arrow points at a 230-foot-wide crop formation that appeared on June 16, 1999 in a crop field near Chilbolton Observatory in Hampshire, England. Photograph © 1999 by Steve Alexander . There were 138 circles, each 10 feet in diameter, placed inside triangular sections that made up a diamond shape. Look at the branching pattern of circles flaring out in opposite directions from the center line. One hundred thirty-eight circles, each 10 feet in diameter, defined the triangle and diamond patterns. The flaring middle horizontal axis might be a forerunner to the larger pattern that appeared in front of Chilbolton Observatory the next year in 2000. Aerial photograph © 1999 by Steve Alexander.

This pattern was huge, demanding attention, and clearly anticipated the 2001 formation that would come in the same field and shock the world for awhile. August 2000, this enormous pattern emerged in front of the Chilbolton Observatory, closer to the observatory than the 1999 pattern. This formation also flares outward on two sides from the center, but with much more detail. Aerial photograph © 2001 by Ulrich Kox. This odd pattern would appear yet again in August 2001, but on a much smaller scale as part of another large, complex pattern that would also come down right in front of the Chilbolton Observatory windows. But in 2001, the flaring glyph would be embedded in a rectangle of binary code. August 14 - 20, 2001 First, on August 14, 2001, the Director of the Chilbolton Observatory, Darcy Ladd, said he and other employees noticed a \"shadow\" out in the wheat field. But no one went to investigate and no pilots reported seeing anything in the field. But on August 20, 2001, Darcy Ladd and all the employees at the observatory were stunned to look out their front windows at a large rectangle filled with \"bundles\" of standing wheat plants arranged in what looked like binary code. The rectangle of code was right where the large flaring formation had emerged in August 2000. Crop formation investigator, Lucy Pringle, received a call from a Chilbolton employee about the wheat pattern and Lucy quickly hired a plane to fly her over the wheat. In addition to the large rectangle, she was surprised to also find a humanoid face staring up at her from the place in the field that Darcy Ladd had called a \"shadow.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Aerial of humanoid face and binary code, both discovered in the wheat field near the British Chilbolton Observatory in Hampshire on August 20, 2001.

When Paul Vigay, Director of the Independent Research Center for Unexplained Phenomena in Southsea, Hampshire, England, first saw the aerial photograph of the \"code\" formation he immediately recognized it as extremely similar to the transmission encoded with digital binary information that was sent on November 16, 1974, from the Arecibo, Puerto Rico radio telescope out into space toward the star cluster, Messier 13, about 23,000 light years from Earth in the Milky Way galaxy. The Arecibo transmission was planned by astronomers at Cornell University, including the late Carl Sagan. Cornell University operates the 300-meter-diameter radio telescope built into a mountain under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation.

Aerial photograph © 2001 by Ulrich Kox. What Could The Patterns Mean? In the Arecibo message, starting at the bottom of the Arecibo transmission, the arc over the \"M\" represents the angle and curve of the telescope and its diameter. Above are nine variously sized circles that depict our solar system, beginning with the sun on the far right. The third planet from the sun (earth) is raised above the other planets indicating our planet, Earth, is the source of the radio transmission. Further, Earth is at the feet of a humanoid figure whose six foot height was indicated to the right in units of the Arecibo wavelength transmission, 12.6 centimeters. To the left of the humanoid figure is the binary code for the earth's 1974 human population. So, a logical speculation is that the strange pattern of 2000 and in the 2001 code represents some kind of transmitter. Arecibo sent out in radio waves; what kind of transmitter puts wheat down in binary code? If you look at the center of the Chilbolton \"transmitter,\" you find four little dots arranged exactly as the 5th planet from the sun is depicted in the Chilbolton wheat code solar system. I asked a Cornell University astronomer if he knew what a planet divided into four dots might mean? He said he had not seen that before, but speculated it might indicate four moons, or a planet divided into four territories. Again, it is logical to speculate that the four dots at the center of the bottom \"transmitter\" indicate the transmission source is from the planet depicted as four dots. August 15, 2002 Another year later, nearly to the day on August 15, 2002, a formation in wheat is reported 8.5 miles from the Chilbolton Observatory on a hill top farm near Winchester, Hampshire. A small woods that runs along the field is called Crabwood, so some people have called it the Crabwood formation."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The first photographs of this Winchester/Crabwood formation were taken on August 16, 2002, the day after an e-mail announcement from an unknown source on August 15, 2002, gave survey coordinates for the new crop pattern. Aerial photograph © 2002 by Steve Alexander. This time, there is another face and code, but the face is not humanoid like the Chilbolton one. The face is a characterization of all the \"grey alien\" faces that have been drawn over the past thirty years by people in the so-called \"human abduction syndrome.\" Allegedly, people are taken physically, mentally, or both, from their cars, bedrooms, or yards, into an extraterrestrial craft where extraterrestrial biological entities perform examinations and often extract sperm or ova. The creatures are generally described as grey-colored with faces very similar to the one patterned in the Winchester wheat field.

While the 2001 Chilbolton code was a large rectangle of binary code similar to the 1974 Arecibo radio telescope transmission, the 2002 code was produced in a spiral of 8 bit binary encoding in hexadecimal form with English alphabet letters represented by ASCII character sets used by computer programmers since the 1960s. To translate the code, you have to start at the center and spiral outward, counterclockwise, to figure out each English letter-by-letter to produce the message.

From the 1999 to 2002 sequence evolving from the diamond and triangle pattern of circles to the transmitter, to the humanoid face and rectangle of binary code, to the alien face and spiral of ASCII binary code, is their a \"logical\" next step in these patterns occurring in the same geographic area and on nearly the same dates?
