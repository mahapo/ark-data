Here begins Part 4 of Status Report II, written in January 1980. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report III begins at Earthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all the previous status reports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield: \" CASE A-7 This entry concerns the medical phase of my inquiry into the study of the alien occupants allegedly recovered from crashes of their vehicles. My first meeting with a prime medical contact came in June 1978, while working on my first status report (reprinted in upcoming Earthfiles) for release in Dayton, Ohio. It was arranged by a veteran researcher of long acquaintance who was aware of my quest for UFO crash/retrieval information. He also knew that I had acquired certain basic pathological information from other sources. Over our dinner, information from the doctor, who served on the staff of a major hospital, came slowly and cautiously. He made references to a colleague who performed an autopsy on an alien body in the early 1950s, but in the main, not much new data were revealed beyond general exterior anatomy. Significant, however, was that certain characteristics, some ambiguously described by other sources, were surprisingly corroborated. Of course, I asked many questions. Most were unanswered. Later that evening, I met my informant's charming wife and we all agreed that our subject was not only bizarre, but almost too incredible for the general public's acceptance. Departing, the doctor was agreeable to further meetings. Communications continued along with a developing mutual trust in our exchange of information. The doctor's next move was for us to meet privately in Dayton, following my scheduled talk. I met him briefly in the lobby of the Convention Center before the program commenced and agreed to rejoin him at a certain time in my room at the Stouffer's Inn. However, because of the intervention of the threats, which caused a sudden shift of my room for my safety, he was unable to reach me. I later learned that even his note that he had pushed under the door of my former room went mysteriously astray. It seemed logical that the new occupant, seemingly distressed by the transfer, could have notified the hotel of the note and they in turn could have made an attempt to reach me in the room to which I had been reassigned. But the new occupant did not and the Dayton affair was full of mysteries that might go forever unexplained. Soon, normal liaison with the doctor resumed. In time, as new information relative to UFO crashes reached me from several new sources, so did new vital data about the "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"alien's physiology. Emerging was a new source, a noted doctor, who was willing to receive and answer some of my questions. I was to know him as a specialist who, in his area of expertise, had performed an autopsy on an alien being in the early 1950s. From him over time, I was able to envision the body entirely. The more I learned of its internal chemistry and some of its organs - or by human equation the lack of organs - I realized that our captured mortal member of the universe was beyond the limits of my non-professional evaluation. During 1979, my sole objective in UFO research has been to release newly acquired data concerning whatever is obtainable from creditable sources about the continuing study of the recovered alien bodies. In the main, it has come from medical people. It is, therefore, important in this status report to first review the general data I have correlated collectively from several sources in the compendium that follows: Leonard Stringfield Summary of At Least One Non-Human Type As Described by Medical Doctors: - T he approximate height of the alien humanoid is 3.5 to 4.5 feet all. One source approximated 5 feet. The weight is approximately 40 pounds. - T wo round eyes without pupils. Under heavy brow ridge, eyes described variously as large, almond-shaped, elongated, sunken or deep set, far apart, slightly slanted, appearing 'Oriental' or 'Mongoloid.' - T he head, by human standards, is large when compared with the size of the torso and limbs. 'Take a look at a 5-month-old human fetus,' I was told. F ive-month-old fetus © Prenatal Section of the Life Exhibit, Chicago Museum of Science and Industry. - N o ear lobes or protrusive flesh extending beyond apertures on each side of head. - N ose is vague. Two nares are indicated with only slight protuberance. - M outh is indicated as a small 'slit' without lips, opening into a small cavity. Mouth appears not to function as a means of communication or as an orifice for food ingestion. - N eck described as being thin. In some instances, not being visible because of garment on that section of body. - M ost observers describe the head of the humanoids as hairless. One said that the pate showed a slight fuzz. Bodies are described as hairless. - S mall and thin, fits the general description of the torso. In most instances, the body was observed wearing a metallic, but flexible garment. - A rms are described as long and thin and reaching down to the knee section. - O ne type of hands has four fingers, no thumb. Two fingers appear longer than others. Some observers had seen fingernails; others without. A slight webbing effect between fingers was noted by three authoritative observers. (See Attachment 3 in Earthfiles Part 3 ).). Other reports indicate types with less or more than four fingers. - L egs short and thin. Feet of one type described as having no toes. Most observers describe feet as covered. One source said foot looked like an orangutan's. - S kin description is NOT green. Some claim beige, tan, brown, or tannish or pinkish gray and one said it looked almost 'bluish gray' under deep freeze"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"lights. In two instances, the bodies were charred to a dark brown. The texture is described as scaly or reptilian, and as stretchable, elastic or mobile over smooth muscle or skeletal tissue. No striated muscle. No perspiration, no body odor.* [ * In November 1979, additional word was received from the medical authority concerning the nature of alien skin. Under magnification, I was told, the tissue structure appears mesh-like or like a grid's network of horizontal and perpendicular lines. Clarifying an earlier reference which describes the skin of the entity as 'reptilian,' this new information suggests that the texture of the granular-skinned lizards, such as the iguana and chameleons, might be similar to at least one type of alien humanoid. ] - N o teeth. - N o apparent reproductive organs. Perhaps atrophied by evolutionary degeneration. No genitalia. In my non-professional judgment, the absence of sexual organs suggests that some of the aliens, and perhaps all, do not reproduce as do the Homo sapiens. Perhaps some of the bodies studied are produced by a system of cloning or other unknown means. - T o most observers, the humanoids appear to be 'formed out of a mold,' or share identical facial characteristics. - B rain and its capacity, unknown. - C olorless liquid prevalent in body without red cells. No lymphocytes. Not a carrier of oxygen. No food or water intake is known. No food found aboard craft in one known retrieval. No digestive system or GI tract. No intestinal or alimentary canal or rectal area described. - M ore than one humanoid type. Life span unknown. Descriptive variations of anatomy might be no more diverse than those known among Earth's Homo sapiens. Other recovered alien types of human or other grotesque configurations are unknown to me. Origin unknown. After several months of negotiation with my major medical sources, hoping to get more specific physiological data, I received the following typewritten statement in the mail on July 2, 1979. It was from the doctor who had performed the autopsy in the early 1950s. June 2, 1979 statement from doctor who performed alien autopsy in early 1950s: ' SIZE - The specimen observed was four feet, three and three-eighths inches in length. I can't remember the weight. It has been so long and my files do not contain the weight. I recall the length well because we had a disagreement and everyone took their turn at measuring. HEAD - The head was pear-shaped in appearance and oversized by human standards for the body. The eyes were Mongoloid in appearance. The ends of the eyes furthest from the nasal cavity slanted upward at about a ten degree angle. The eyes were recessed into the head. There seemed to be no visible eyelids, only what seemed like a fold. Oriental eyes without lids. There were no human type lips as such - just a slit that opened into an oral cavity about two inches deep. A membrane along the rear of the cavity separated it from what would be the digestive tract. The tongue seemed to be atrophied into almost a membrane. No teeth were observed. X-rays revealed a maxilla and mandible as well a cranial bone structure. The outer 'ear lobes' did not exist. The auditory orifices present were similar to our middle and inner ear canals. The head contained no hair follicles. The skin seemed grayish in color and seemed mobile when moved. The above observations are from general anatomical observations. I did not autopsy or study the head portion in any great detail since this was not my area of specialty. NOTE: Your drawing [ See in Earthfiles Part 3 ) of the head should have the cheek bones removed or a smoother contour. The eyes in the nasal cavity area are not right. The recess and fold is continuous across the forehead. The neck seems too long, but the shoulders do not slope as prominently. This might give"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"you this effect. The arms are oversized in length by human standards. There was no thumb. The index finger in your drawing is longer than the middle finger. I don't believe this is correct, but my memory is hazy at this point. The chest area contained what seemed like two atrophied mammary gland nipples. The sexual organs were atrophied. Some other investigators have observed female specimens. I have not had this opportunity. The legs were short and thin. The feet did not show any toes. The skin covered the foot in such a way that it gave the appearance of wearing a sock. However, X-ray examination showed normal bone structure underneath. ' STRINGFIELD COMMENT: The statement received from the doctor, which I had requested for this status report, is indeed a breakthrough. Knowing the doctor's area of medical expertise and the hospital in which he continues his specialized work, it is my belief that his claim to having conducted an autopsy is true. Knowledgeable of other activity at the medical center, plus his comments relative to a specific study, I hasten to say that I can find no hints or obvious loose ends that would indicate a hoax. Moreover, some of the information he had related in the past year, not included in his statement, was corroborated by another source, also a doctor. Although this latter source is secondhand, the information shared contains an important detail about a skin characteristic. Noteworthy is that many questions asked of my medical person have gone unanswered. For some reason, it took several months to get his response to describe the alien's foot. When it came to me through his colleague (prior to his written statement), he said that there were no distinct toes. Instead, a 'fusion of small bones that indicated evolutionary degeneration.' Later, when I pointed out that distinct toes had been mentioned in a report from another source, he checked with a colleague and got confirmation. 'There are more than one type,' he said. Significant, too, is that still another of my sources, the Air Force Major (See Status Report II, Case A-4) told me that the one body he had seen had toes 'like an orangutan.' Also relative to the foot, when I asked Robert Barry for information about the foot from his former C. I. A. source, I was told that he was unable to disclose that detail. Later, when I learned of this detail from my medical source, Barry was able to confirm it. Getting information about the brain, if any exists as we know it, is without results. No one seems to know. My medical source either doesn't know or is reluctant to comment. Other specific questions about the alien's internal organs, or specific details about its circulatory or reproductive systems are also circumvented. One exception, however, to a question I had relative to a device allegedly worn by some of the recovered alien entities concerned a so-called head band. Originally, I heard of it from a former NASA source as a 'translator,' used to communicate in all languages with people on Earth. The source, known through a technical person at Bell Laboratories, would not come forward for an interview. Barry's source referred to it as a 'transceiver,' adding cryptically that it was used in the 'projection of brain waves.' One sample of the band, he said, was procured in the 1962 crash, and has since been analyzed and developed by the Air Force in an attempt to 'talk them down (UFOs) into landing.' Finally, on this perplexing issue, I asked my medical source if such a gadget existed. In time, I learned that he was aware of it, but had not seen it. He offered no details. Of course, in research it is known that a head band, or similar unit, worn on the chest or waist, is described during encounters with live entities. Photographs showing the deceased humanoids have been seen by my medical sources. In these, a metallic, one-piece suit was worn. Also, in my first paper, a statement was reviewed from Ted Phillips, a prominent MUFON and CUFOS researcher, specializing in the investigation of physical traces at UFO landing sites, which states that he was privileged to have seen a photo showing the body entirely. At a meeting November 27, 1978, in New York during our visit to the United Nations (with Drs. Hynek, Saunders, Vallee, Poher, and Gordon Cooper and Lee Spiegel to present the UFO problem to Secretary General Kurt Waldheim), he told me that he was shocked when he saw my drawing of the alien hand. It was strikingly similar to the hand he had seen in the photograph. (See Attachment 3 in Earthfiles Part 3 ).
