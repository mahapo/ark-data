Len Stringfield - continued: THE \"ROSWELL\" ERA: INSIDERS BARE SECRETS Survivors in-the-know, going back to the \"Roswell\" UFO crash era, both before and after the established date of July 2, 1947, are thinning out. For most of the few remaining, so are their memories when they try to recapture the details of the role they played in the drama of events. While we might never be privy to the whole \"inside,\" unexpurgated story hidden under the lid of secrecy, I believe it should behoove all of us in research to get all the facts we can from these old-timers - now. The so-called Roswell era was a time when officialdom, already baffled by the foo-fighter of WWII, was suddenly faced with a new crisis of incalculable consequences - the crashes of alien saucers and crews in the New Mexico desert, circa 1947. Almost instantly after the first shock wave, secrecy prevailed, understandably, and up went the proverbial wall. Rumors and yet-to-be-proved documents have surfaced over the years about the early crisis, but the wall has held firm - never to be seriously breached,. Senator Barry Goldwater, with his political clout, tried. So did Major Donald Keyhoe along with a powerful NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena.) Both failed. But now the wall of secrecy weakens a little with some old hands emerging to tell about their part or knowledge of the untold story. Credit must go to them, of course, for their courage however. If there is praise, it should be shared by those who knew the value of time in relation to aging people and managed to get their \"pasts\" on record. To this end, Timothy Cooper - an energetic sleuthing newcomer who surfaced to Stan Friedman and me in the fall of 1990 - has performed well. A resident of Big Bear Lake, California, and a member of MUFON, Cooper is professionally an experienced industrial technical writer and works for a licensed private investigation agency. For this status report, Cooper shares information from four sources each delving into the crash/retrievals of yester-year. Since the name Roswell has become a generic name for any and all crashes in New Mexico, Cooper and I cannot yet determine if his collective information is applicable to the famous Roswell crash of July 2, 1947, or to crashes or landings in other areas in the same time frame. After receiving Cooper's introductory letter to which I responded by phone for an hour-long exchange of expressions of mutual trust, I soon received the following report, "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"properly edited, which he got firsthand from a life-long close friend: THE CLOSE FRIEND (submitted to Stringfield by Timothy Cooper) \"This is my interview on September 9, 1990, with a retired Air Force enlisted man who was stationed at Holloman AFB in the month of July, 1947. My source wished to remain anonymous and will be known as 'Bob.' Bob was a technical sergeant stationed at Holloman at the time when the U. S. Army Air Force recovered the wreckage of a craft described as a flying saucer. Bob's main duty was to oversee the printing for the Operations Section at Holloman. It was in this capacity that he became involved with sensitive papers and photos documenting the recovery of a crashed UFO in 1947. According to Bob, he was ordered by the Holloman Base Commander who was Colonel Paul F. Helmlek (confirmed by Stanton Friedman and the Alamogordo News, dated July 17, 1947) to print a typed report of 50-pages that included some black and white photographs. Bob told me what was unusual about this request was that the base commander pulled up at the printing facility with a complement of MPs armed with Tommy guns who surrounded the building. He lmlek came into the sergeant's office and ordered everyone to go home except him. After his order was carried out, Bob told me, Helmlek pulled out a portfolio containing a report and gave it to him and said, 'Print this.' Bob said he told the colonel that it would be difficult and would take a long time to do it without his staff. The colonel became stern with him and ordered him to do it now. Bob told me that the report basically contained information about the crash or landing of a UFO at White Sands Missile Range. He was ordered not to look at the contents and to forget what he saw in the photos. Bob said that he proceeded to shoot camera film of the report for off-set plates and to lay glass-dot screens for the black and white photos (st ills from a large format press camera, he believes). What he saw in the photos was amazing. They depicted a saucer-like craft on the ground. He doesn't remember how many photos there were. He said the craft was shiny and metallic with no apparent markings nor any visible propulsion system. Since this event happened back in 1947, he could not recall the features of the craft nor the contents of the report. I asked Bob how long this printing assignment took? Finished the same day, he said - adding that he was ordered to put the negatives and plates in the security safe and that some security personnel would come later for them. He did not say how many copies were made, only that each copy was numbered. Colonel He lmlek t ook all the copies and left. I asked if he could remember the precise date in July. He could not.\" Following up by phone on October 19, 1990, Cooper asked Bob once again if he knew the date on the report he printed for Colonel Helmlek. His source interrupted and said, 'That is secret.\" Cooper enclosed a second set of papers relating to his interview with Bob, most of it a summary of the foregoing information or a dialogue of instances where Bob, unable to answer questions, often resorted to speculation. But in every instance, from my point of view, his responses were forthright, honest and based on his keen knowledge of events in the Roswell era. One item, however, stood out, when Cooper questioned his source about MJ-12, Bob's response follows: \"He at first hesitated to answer for a few seconds; he said that there was a government and military working group in existence during his tenure at Ent AFB (Colorado). He knows this to be true because he said the classifications of printed material for NORAD was given priority of Above (Ultra) Top Secret with a '12'"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"designation. He did not know what the classification '12' was, but knew it was 'hand- carried by armed courier with military escort.'\" There was no question that Cooper's source, Bob, had an endless well of knowledge about UFO crashes in the summer of 1947 in New Mexico. Cooper's inab ility to extract definite locations from him might have been due to vague recall of available records. As we all know now, the \"Roswell\" at Corona is reasonably well established. However, Bob was unaware of it by either name. Yet, he is aware of a crash landing near White Sands. about which we in research have only the barest information. And there were other crash cases in New Mexico in the summer of 1947, the latest surfacing in 1990 with lots of details from a new firsthand witness, Gerald Anderson, who claims as a child with his fa mily he witnessed a crashed disc in the Plains of San Agustin. Still others, in the same time-frame, have been reported in New Mexico's remote and wild mountainous regions, places with strange names and hardly any details. Persistent, Cooper again tried his key source, Bob, and another well-informed contact, hoping to get more definitive answers about the crashes or at least some new clues. On April 28, 1991, he called to relate that he had new information from Bob which follows: Provided by Timothy Cooper Third interview with retired USAF M/Sergeant, April 6, 1991 Location: Confidential Tularosa west of Roswell near the eastern border of White Sands Missile Range. \"This interview was conducted under relaxed conditions as a social visit. The subject of my conversation with Bob was about the targeting method employed by the U.S. Air Force during the bombing of Iraq. We discussed the ability of the bombs to follow a laser beam to its target. Bob said that 'smart' bombs were developed at the Tularosa Bomb Range after WWII and was no great deal. I asked him about the activities at Alamogordo Field (Holloman) while he was stationed there. Eventually, Bob was in the mood to talk about a 'special job' he was personally asked to do by the base commander, Colonel Paul Helmlek. Q. Do you remember what was in the Top Secret Ultra report you were ordered to print by Colonel Helmlek? A. Yes. As I recall, it was a technical report of a radar target that was tracked and filmed over the North Range (Tularosa). It was a report of a landing of a saucer-type craft. There were Askania (movie) and still films taken. Q. Where was the filming taken? A. On the North Range (Area) of White Sands Missile Range. I believe it was near Tularosa, but inside the range."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Q. How were the pictures taken? What cameras? What unit? A. By Askania and Mitchell tracking cameras. A 1st Sergeant by the name of Paul, an Askania camera crew chief, told me that he shot some of the footage from a truck mounted tripod somewhere near Tularosa. The unit was the White Sands Tracking and Photographic section of the TOPPO Battalion. I remember a party going on at the Rocker Club (Staff NCO), I am sure it was on the 4th of July (1947). Paul was paged by phone to report to the base commander's office. I did not see him for over a week. This was unusual because Askania Ops did not work at night. I think on or around Friday next is when I was approached by Colonel He lmlek for a priority printing job (see my first interview). When I did see Paul, he was very quiet and seemed nervous. This was not like him. Paul was a robust and hardy fellow. A bomber pilot who saw much action and seen men die. He was not himself. He finally told me that all the tracking teams were sent out to the Tularosa area with their equipment. He said that S-2 sent photographers out into the North Range on July 4-8, 1947. Some of the Askania film was taken from a truck and on an airplane (trucks and aircraft appeared in some of the motion picture films). The stills were taken from the air and on the ground. I think various types of cameras were used. Some of the motion picture film was in color. They must have used flares or illumination r ounds from mortars. Q. What did you see in the pictures? How many were there? A. I remember a dozen or more 8 x 10 B&W glossies of the craft resting near a hillside. It appeared slightly tilted. The craft appeared to be a large, r ound dome-shaped, almost egg-shaped disc with a flat bottom. It looked bigger than a B-29 in size. The personnel in the foreground gave a sense of scale to it. I guess it was approximately 100 feet in diameter and about 15-20 feet high at the center. I saw a rim or a dihedral edge near the bottom of the craft in one photo. I saw no landing gear, exhaust ports or windows. I did see one access opening or door-like opening that seemed to open outward. Some stills are of the base technical personnel surrounding the craft. Some were wearing suits. They were c limbing on t op. There were some close-ups of the craft's structure, but can't recall what it looked like. Q. What do you remember of the technical report itself? A. It was a technical description of the craft. It was prepared for the AMC and the ATIC. It did not analyze, but recorded dimensional, structural and material specifications. The report also contained radar data. There was a section that included the possible flight path, guidance and navigation systems, propulsion theory and flight controls. Part of the report was done by a German scientific team headed by Ernst Steinhoff and Wernher von Braun. There were a few aeronautical engineers flown into Holloman (Alamogordo Field) from ATIC. I did not read the report per se, but recall some topics it covered. It was approximately 50 pages with a lot of photographs. I did not process any motion picture film at that time. Bob said he remembers another 1st Sergeant that was an A/E mechanic that also was a pilot. He flew in some top Air Force Generals (Twining, Canon, LeMay, Vandenberg, Doolittle, Wainwright and some other high-ranking brass) to Holloman AFB. His name was Robert G. Baines (was later assigned to fly generals of USAE). I think General Groves was flown in with Oppenheimer, Bush, von Neuman, von Karman I think (their names were mentioned in the report). I do not think anyone had any idea what kind of craft this was or what it was doing there. The base was sealed for a week or so. Even the airstrip and hangars were off-limits to most of the base. I did not see any reference to any 'astronauts' being taken into custody, but I heard there was an armored vehicle sent to the landing site along with some 'meat- wagons.' The base dispensary was under MP guard at one section of the building, but I think it was not related. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"There were a lot of former bomber pilots that got out of the Air Force after the war, but later came back in because there were no jobs. There were not airplanes either for them. So those pilots came back in the Army Air Force as Staff and 1st Sergeants. Some were unassigned. They came back in so they could complete 20 years and retire. Some were assigned to photographic units, parachute sections, crash and retrieval teams and so on. All of them were professionals. Highly trained and sk illed pilots and technicians composed most of the Alamogordo Field's White Sands Missile Range operations. Bob said in 1948, orders were coming in for a lot of people at Alamogordo. Bob stayed on there until 1952 and was assigned to Weisbaden, West Germany.\" Continued in Part 7.
