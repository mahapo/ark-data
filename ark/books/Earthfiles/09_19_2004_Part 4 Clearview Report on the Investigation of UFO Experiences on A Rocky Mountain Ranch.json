Don't Trust Senses Unless Two or More See Barbara: Really, we did not mention the fact that often when the wall pounding was going on, or when there would be a larger number of disks, or the animal would be around more quite often all the electricity would go off. I absolutely freaked out if anybody wanted to go out and check the breaker on the corral until after things had calmed down. We would check house breakers and eventually, go out to the corral and the breakers would be on out there. We developed a system of nobody going by themselves and nobody making a big issue out of something that at least two people did not see or hear. It was too easy to get paranoid. Once I went out the back door and heard this horrible sound in the corral and screamed and freaked out and came running in. Everybody went out with flashlights and it was a cow that had gotten trapped in the corral. It's very easy to get into that (mind set) and I could see my children doing it. Everything strange that happened a sudden wind storm that came up, a sudden fog that would roll in would be the space creatures. It was becoming an absolutely paranoid thing it was very frightening. Jim: I think we suffered as heavy on the mutilations as anyone I had heard of. We lost six cattle in two years. That is a pretty heavy amount of loss. In light of the fact that I was watching that land so carefully, I was determined to catch whoever it was. the reward was so high. I would not have minded at all. It now come close to half a million dollars. (Editor's Note: Colorado Cattlemen's Association had a $500,000 reward in the mid-1970s for information that would lead to the arrest and conviction of the cattle mutilators.) The paranoia has gone down now. Two years ago in the county, you did not dare stop on the side of the road. Those people were carrying high-powered weapons and they would shoot anything that moved. It was really tense and I can see the law officer's point of view, but I don't think you solve it by sweeping it under the rug when it is continuing to go on. The mutilations have not gone down at all. Remember when the big mutilation thing was going. Well, they have not gone down at all. Investigator: When you have a problem you don't know how to deal with, sweeping it under the rug is not good. But what do you do instead? Barbara: I wish someone would come up with a very neat package to answer that. 26. CE III (Close Encounter of the 3rd Kind) Jim: Will you remove me from my promise? Barbara: Oh, Jim! Jim: Trust me . Barbara: All right. Jim: Because I want to get it out of my mind, too, and then forget it. Barbara: All right, go ahead. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Jim: Because it's necessary to develop what particularly bothers me. Well, the night that we saw the box, I stopped at the top of the hill and looked down into the trees and there was a light in the trees. I told Joe to go on to the house, and I walked down into the trees. I think that's the closest I ever came to being afraid. I did not feel fear, in that sense, but my legs would not move. I had to force my legs to take me down because I did not know what I would see. I walked down to the light and there were two individuals waiting for me in the light. The light did not come from anywhere. I can't describe it. It was just light. They obviously were not nervous and as soon as I walked up, they spoke to me by name and told me: - I can quote that exactly 'How nice of you to come.' It was just as though I had been expected. Blond Male Humanoids, Big Foot and Lethal Black Box Down below, possibly 50 or 60 feet from us, was a disk on the ground. It was lighted, just light enough to see. I can describe it exactly because I've burned that in my memory. I was up there maybe five minutes. They apologized for the inconveniences they had caused us, told us that a more equitable arrangement would be worked out between us, whatever that means. I wanted to ask a lot of questions, but found that I did not you know, like ask where they were from. I did not ask any of that. There are several things they asked me not to repeat that have no significant meaning at all they are unrelated to anything. I think maybe they were just checking to see if I would keep my mouth shut. I told them that if they were mutilating cattle, it was very foolish to do so and draw that much attention to themselves. I complained about the damage to the cars. They never admitted doing any of it. One thing they did do was mentioned the box and that I did the right thing to back away from it. It was what I called an implied threat. They nodded and approximately 20 to 30 feet away, 'Big Foot,' as I call him, got up and walked toward the box. The box changed tone and the Big Foot dropped (to the ground). The beings said, 'As you can see, they (black box) are quite lethal.' The beings said that they would come back and talk again. There were no good-byes. I just some how felt it was time to go. They did tell me that my memory would not be tampered with. I think that is about it. I did not ask any of the questions that I had figured I would want to ask. Some how, they (my questions) seemed juvenile. I had no doubts that these were two men they were men I can describe them almost exactly. I had seen them before. This is the thing I had not mentioned. I had not gotten a really close look, but the two that spoke to me were not identically the same as those that I had seen before. They were similar. These were definitely humanoid. They were approximately 5 feet 6 inches tall, I would say. They had on tight-fitting clothing like a flight suit. I noticed the clothing changed colors, from brown to silver, but I don't know how. The men were very fair, had large eyes and seemed perfectly normal, completely relaxed. They had blond hair with something over the head, but I could still see their hair. They had something like a whole flight suit on, skin-fitted. The hair was obviously blond and was not long. It did not make much of an impression. The thing that did impress me the most were the eyes. If I were judging what they were, I would say they were humanoids. They were different than people, but not different enough that you could not call them people. Investigator: If you saw them on the street, you would stare at them as being different? Jim: Right, but not freaked out by them. Their facial features were finer; their eyes were larger; they would have been striking, but almost effeminate, almost delicately effeminate; completely self-assured. They obviously were handling the situation with me very well. Investigator: Did you turn around and walk away from them? Or did they go first? Jim: I went first. We talked. There were no good-byes. It was just like, 'Well we're finished,' and I just walked off. I thought about all of the things I would have liked to have asked, but I could not figure out why. Then I could not figure out why they had ever bothered to talk to me. It was obvious that I was supposed to come. They did not say anything that would indicate why, except a more equitable arrangement. Barbara: You were not feeling well that night, I remember."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Jim: I was feeling very badly. Barbara: Jim has a heart condition, too. Jim: A myocardial infarction. I did not particularly want to go up the hill, but I felt some how compelled to go up. Nothing that happened was phenomenal. I can't figure why or how. They did not give me any earth-shattering information or even admit they were mutilating the cattle. The only thing I found out for sure is that this big, fuzzy thing 'Big Foot' obeys their commands. I found that out. I found out the box can be lethal, if they were telling me the truth. It was, all in all, a very pleasant conversation we had. No trouble with them after that. This happened approximately in January of 1977. The part that was interesting was that they would see us again and I was really excited. I came back and told everybody that they would be down to the house to visit one day. It was a very pleasant conversation and I would define them as diplomats. They were very capable of handling what they had to. They were very smooth, and if I were judging by the ones that I have seen before, they were larger and were more humanoid. If anything, they were half-breed. They looked enough like people that in a laboratory, we could produce people that looked just like it. That was my first thought that some how the government was trying to do this. They were completely self-assured. They spoke vernacular English. I was pretty rocked because I did see the disk and it was quite clear. I walked on back to the house. It was not very long that I was gone, I'm sure. I was not with the beings very long. I was excited over the more equitable arrangement. I guess I had some illusion that they were going to give me the cure for cancer or a billion dollars or something. Or at least pay for the cars' transmissions. Shortly after that is when Barbara saw the other type of UFO the ice cream cone-shaped one. Ice Cream Cone-Shaped UFOs 27. Tall Creature With Helmet Jim: I was asleep on the couch. John was there because it was a weekend. It was about two in the morning. I sleep very soundly, as a rule. But I woke up completely awake wide awake and I could not move. I was lying on the couch looking out. There are French doors in front of it. I could not talk, but I could breath All right and I wanted Barbara and John to get in there and turn the lights on and see it. I was forcing the air out of my larynx and making strange sounds. They could hear me, but they were not coming. And this thing was just looking at me. I can describe it very vividly. All that was working was my eyes. I could not move. (This creature) was approximately seven feet tall, very skinny arms and legs, extremely skinny. It had an object on its chest. I could see the shaping of it very clearly, like a box, but it was not flat. It was pointed. It had like three hoses on each side. This creature had a thing over its head, like a space helmet with a plastic covering. It was not at all terrifying. It was more or less pathetic in appearance almost helplessly pathetic. It was just looking at me in the same way that you would look at a patient on the table not cruelly or indifferently, just looking. I kept making these noises and it just vanished. It just was not there anymore and I said, 'Oh, God, I'm hallucinating. I've lost my mind.' then I decided, 'No. It really could not be.' Barbara: John and I got in there just after it had disappeared, so we did not see it. The reason it took us so long was that John could not get me awake. He was torn between running to see what was happening and trying to wake me. And we lost a few seconds that way. By the time we finally got in there, it was all over. John has had some experiences on his own and I'll leave that to him. Jim: I think the reason that it is all so interesting to me is that we were headed toward a more amiable relationship with them after my talking with them. The disasters had stopped, the pounding on the house had stopped, the terrorism had stopped. After talking, I kind of liked them. They were pleasant and whatever they were I had not decided they came from space and I'm still not sure of that. But then again, after that, the hostilities started up again. That was extremely disorienting. The situation got extremely tense with no apparent reason. No disaster happened after that, but from the time that I talked with whatever it was on the hill until I saw the thing at the couch, everything had been running so smoothly."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 28. Decision to Leave Jim: It was almost exciting that we could live peacefully with whatever it was, from wherever they were from. Barbara: I think this is what finally broke me because everything was going so peacefully and I thought we were going to be able to stay. And I really love that place and I thought everything was going to smooth out. But then it did not. Jim: Then after whatever it was it obviously was not humanoid (tall, skinny creature) but it was not hostile, it wasn't threatening, it wasn't dangerous. After that, though, everything went back to double doses of tension. It got much worse the tension, not necessarily the activity. It was a thing of we knew we were unwanted. It's a gut-level feeling that's hard to describe exactly. We knew that something wanted us out. Barbara felt the same thing. Shortly after this sighting, we had an accidental fire with paint on the porch. It had nothing to do with them, but on top of all this feeling (of being unwanted), that was it. Barbara: I've often read about what they call the 'Fight or Flight' syndrome and I've often wondered which one I am. Well, I've decided I'm definitely flight. The only reason I did not leave right then was that the children were there and Jim was there and how can you leave someone? But it took me an instant to make that decision. It was not a gut-level decision. I froze instantly and then I very stupidly grabbed a candlestick and ran out to the porch. Naturally, what he needed was water, but I did not know that. I really thought we were being attacked. I just decided that I could not take that anymore because I had faced that fact that if I ran out there, I would probably die. I figured that I was getting far off the end of the stick when going out there to die did not seem that important. And I thought, it's time to leave before you lose it all.\" Continued in Part 5 Friend Loses Physical Control Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
