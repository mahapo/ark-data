Then something happens around 2012 and it all goes quiet.” - A rizona Abductee R eturn to: Part 1 July 13, 2008 Phoenix, Arizona - Interview with William continued: “SO WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN THE REST OF 2008 AND 2009 AND BEYOND? I think after the next President comes into the U. S., that’s when things are going to change dramatically. That president will step in and join the fight on the Israeli side. Whoever Israel is up against is a common enemy. DOES THE UNITED STATES LAUNCH NUCLEAR MISSILES? I don’t think so, not from here. But I think things happen here that are not good. EXPLOSIONS BY ENEMY TERRORISTS THAT ARE BLOWING THINGS UP ? Right. THEN MARTIAL LAW GETS PUT IN PLACE? DID YOU SEE ANY FURTHER INTO THE FUTURE? Past the 2008 presidential election, in the black cube I saw that things are quite a mess for two or three years. Then something happens around 2012 and it all goes quiet. WHAT WERE YOU SEEING IN THE BLACK CUBE? I saw lots of people without homes. That’s happening now, but I saw a lot of people without homes. Like you would expect to see people living in tent cities, but they weren’t tents even. I saw a lot of people in a very desperate situation. Then I saw others who were not. And these people were being well cared for and taken care of. It was like society had divided into two separate cultures and there were those in the United States living more like in a Third World country who didn’t have the things they need. And then, there was the upper class that had all the things they needed. The two types of social classes were not allowed to mingle. They were kept apart. THAT WOULD OCCUR BY WHAT YEAR, DO YOU THINK? By late 2010. International Airline Travel Ends? The other thing I saw was that travel between countries pretty much came to a stop. You don’t do it unless you have a reason to. There were several countries that polarized themselves against ours and did not want us there. So, the list of "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"places you could go to had actually diminished and where you could go, it might not be safe for you to be there. Disease Spreads Globally? I saw there were diseases and these diseases were very fast. It diminished the populations of the poor and hit some of the rich as well. WHAT KIND OF DISEASE? I don’t know except like the flu. When there have been reports about the bird flu, I thought maybe that’s what this was that I had seen. But I don’t know. [ Editor's Note: World Health Organization (W.H.O.) first reported in September 1996 a \"highly pathogenic H5N1 avian virus was isolated from a farm goose in Guangdong Province, China. By 1997, H5N1 outbreaks were reported in poultry farms and live animal markets in Hong Kong, China.\" Then came disturbing news that there were \"human infections with avian influenza in Hong Kong. Altogether, 18 cases (6 fatal) were reported in the first known instance of human infection by the H5N1 virus.\" The implication was that the avian flu virus was able to jump from animals to humans. The biggest fear was that the virus would mutate to go from human-to-human in a worldwide pandemic equivalent to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic that killed millions of people around the world. 2 003 to 2008 number of human H5N1 bird flu cases and deaths reported only as laboratory- confirmed cases to the World Health Organization as of June 19, 2008. Total number of 385 cases includes 243 deaths and all dates refer to onset of illness. Graphic from W. H. O . WHAT HAPPENS FOR EVERYTHING TO GO QUIET? WHAT DID YOU SEE IN THE BLACK CUBE? It’s like everything became exhausted. I don’t know if these diseases caused such a problem and that’s why there were so few people? I don’t know if something happened to the world’s food supply? But the conflict increased to an intense point and then it just all went quiet. There were places were there were people, but they weren’t worried, they weren’t hurting. They were fine. And these were places that were quite remote. The places where the cities were looked a mess. But in the other places where it was quiet, it was very nice."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 2012 to 2052 Then the world started changing again. There were issues that took place over the next forty years or so. Then after that, it seems like the chaos works itself out and goes even quieter all over the world – there weren’t as many people or problems. There was an understanding that we humans should never do this again. And it was remembered that way. DID YOU SEE ANY DISCS, CIGARS OR TRIANGLES OR OTHER AERIAL CRAFT IN THE SKIES OF THE WORLD INSIDE THE BLACK CUBE? No, I never saw any of those. No UFOs, nothing. SO FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, YOU DON’T THINK THAT ZO OR ANYBODY IS GOING TO INTERRUPT, INTERFERE WITH DEVASTATING NUCLEAR CHAOS AND STOP IT BEFORE IT BEGINS? The alien interference was something I was really concerned about because I was wondering if they would actually do something to keep this from occurring. Apparently, there is chaos going on in the other side of this imaginary fence (from Earth) that Zo’s people are on. There are those wanting to let this thing play out the way that it will and there are those who want to keep it from happening. And the ones that are wanting to let it play out are saying, ‘If we don’t let it play itself out now, it will just keep going this way.’ Then there are the others that say if we can just keep the collapse at bay as long as we can, humans will evolve to a point where they will understand this is not how you conduct yourself in a planetary society. So, you’ve got that conflict going on and I don’t know that one side is more right than the other. But I know there is that conflict out there. It’s not so much heated arguments as much as the rationale between one group versus another. What is the Tau Ceti Vested Interest in Earth? IF ZO IS FROM TAU CETI AND HAS SOME VESTED INTEREST IN THE EARTH, WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT VESTED INTEREST IS IN THE EARTH? Apparently we humans and Zo's people come from the same place. They just want us to catch up so we can re-establish the relationship that we used to have as two planetary civilizations. Other Non-Human Species Using Earth WHAT IS THE TAU CETI PERSPECTIVE ON THE GREYS AND THE STANDING UP LIZARDS? They told me and showed me the standing up lizard people are dangerous. They are very smart and to be very careful around them. As far as the greys go, they showed me two or three different versions of them. The ones that are more bluish-white looking are the ones the Tau Cetians work with. They have an affiliation, like they are friends. THE BLUISH-WHITE WOULD BE TALL, SHORT, WHAT? The bluish-white are two sizes. Some of them are tall and some of them are short – short meaning 4-feet-tall roughly. The tall ones are 6 feet tall. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHERE THE TALL BLUE-WHITES COME FROM? They come from the same area of stars that Tau Ceti is in. I’m thinking it was Epsilon Eridani that they told me these folks come from. But I don’t know absolutely. I know there are not any humans on Epsilon Eridani and I’m pretty"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"sure that’s where the tall and short bluish-white beings originate. B eads on thin strings in model prepared by amateur astronomer Marjorie Fish so that each star is suspended on a separate thread at its appropriate distance and position from our Sun. Colors denote spectral type. Our Sun below Sirius is a yellow G2. Tau Ceti and 82 Epsilon Eridani are left of the Sun. Photograph of Marjorie Fish's 3-dimensional star structure © 1974 by Astronomy. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Epsilon Eridani is one of the nearest solar-type stars to our Sun and is a main-sequence K2 class star at 10.5 light years from our solar system. “Epsilon Eridani has an estimated 85% of the Sun's mass and 84% of the Sun's radius, but has only 28% of its luminosity and is 10 light years distant. It is the second nearest spectral class K star after α Centauri B.] Compared to the Sun, this star is considered slightly low in the abundance of elements with atomic numbers higher than helium. Epsilon Eridani has only about 74% of the Sun's abundance of iron in its chromosphere. The star's most unusual characteristic is its extremely variable spectrum, with many emission lines. Furthermore, it has a very strong magnetic field and has been measured to rotate once every 12 days (roughly twice as fast as the Sun). The reason is its youth of about 800 million to a billion years old.” ] THE SANDY-HAIRED TAU CETIANS ARE ALLIED WITH THE EPSILON ERIDANIS. WHAT MORE DID ZO SHARE ABOUT WHY THE STANDING UP LIZARDS ARE DANGEROUS? He just said they would eat us. They would enslave us, use us for whatever tasks they might need us for. They have no perception of what it means to be hurt, the way we humans experience pain and mistreatment and that they would eat us. They would actually farm to collect babies to eat them. DID HE SHOW YOU ANY PICTURES? Yeah, because apparently they have done this in other parts of the galaxy. THAT COULD EXPLAIN SOME OF THE HUMAN ABDUCTION DRAWINGS OF ALL THE FOETUSES INSIDE OF CONTAINERS? That’s what came to mind, but there is another thing that’s going on as well because there is another race that’s involved and they are not even affiliated with the lizards. What these others are doing is harvesting from Earth to populate other worlds to do their work for them. WHICH ONES ARE THEY? Those are the guys with the little pointy chins that you see on the cover of Whitley Strieber’s book, Communion (© 1986). THOSE ARE THE STRIEBER GREYS VERSUS THE PEAR-HEADED EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGIAL ENTITIES, OR EBENS? AND YOU’RE SAYING THE POINTY CHIN ONES ARE INVOLVED WITH ANIMAL MUTILATIONS AND OTHER GENETIC HARVESTS?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"There’s also another race that look like black hairy things, but they are pretty damn smart and these guys are scary. WHAT DO THEY WANT? The black hairy ones are as advanced as Strieber greys. They are both involved together to harvest and create biospheres on other planets where they can use harvested people to do work. The harvesters adapt the humans to the atmosphere and climate of other planets. THE HUMANS ARE USED AS SLAVES OR ANDROIDS? They are still humans with souls, intelligence and ability, but their life span has been restricted and their ability to know more has been completely squelched. And one of the things I was told is that had happened here on Earth before. We had evolved as a species and started evolving out of that and caused the harvesters to leave. The harvesters left long enough that we humans evolved out of that slave state to a degree and started looking into greater and greater abilities within ourselves. YOU MEAN THAT THE BLACK HAIRY ONES AND THE GREYS WITH THE POINTED CHINS LEFT THE EARTH FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME? Yeah, they did. It was apparently quite a long time ago because when they came back, that’s when they had to start using fear tactics to control the human population, to knock the population down so they could then go in and start doing the harvesting activities they had been doing previously. Zo showed me was that there was a period of time in Europe that mankind had reached a pinnacle and was about to make the next dramatic evolutionary step with science, art and philosophy. That’s another point where the bad ones came in and wiped out the population with the Black Plague and then they went into the churches and started getting everyone rounded up and thinking in a certain direction. I llustration of the Black Death from the Toggenburg Swiss Bible. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia source - Black Plague, The Black Death was one of the deadliest pandemics in human history, widely thought to have been caused by a bacterium named Yersinia pestis (Bubonic plague), but recently attributed by some to other diseases. The pandemic is thought to have begun in Central Asia or India and spread to Europe during the 1340s. The total number of deaths worldwide is estimated at 75 million people, of which approximately 25-50 million died in Europe, 30% to 60% of Europe's population. By 1400, the pandemic reduced the world's population from an estimated 450 million to around 350 to 375 million. “The 14th century eruption of the Black Death had a drastic effect on Europe's population, irrevocably changing the social structure. It was a serious blow to the Roman Catholic Church and resulted in widespread persecution of minorities such as Jews, foreigners, beggars, and lepers. The uncertainty of daily survival created a general mood of morbidity.” ] "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"WHEN YOU SAY ‘THEY,’ YOU MEAN? The pointed chin greys and the black hairy ones. SO THEY ARE THE ONES BEHIND THE GREEN FOG AND PLAGUE THAT WIPED OUT A THIRD OF THE EUROPEAN POPULATION IN THE 1300S? Right, because that was the technological powerhouse of the world at the time and that was about to spread all over the world. Then the plague happened and it went into a very dark time. Then the church became the strength and the power simultaneously and that’s when it all changed because at that point forward, that’s when world domination was starting to take over again. G rim reaper figure originated from European villager eyewitness accounts during the 1340s Black Plague after seeing hooded figures swinging a rod back and forth that in some cases emitted a gaseous-looking substance and was also associated with low-lying green fog. See The Gods of Eden: The Chilling Truth about Extraterrestrial Infiltration and Conspiracy to Keep Humankind in Chains by William Bramley © 1989 and 1990. Illustration © by Cyril Van Der Haegen. THIS WAS DONE BY THE POINTED CHIN GREYS AND THE BLACK HAIRY ONES TO PREVENT THE HUMAN POPULATION FROM ADVANCING WITH TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE THAT WOULD UPSET THE ALIEN APPLE CART? If we, as a human species, were to advance past a certain point at that juncture in Earth history, I guess they were afraid we would then see who they really were. They had not made much mystery about the fact they were here. THESE THEN WERE THE DEVILS OF HISTORY? Yeah, exactly, and people would wake up to that and then there would be trouble for them. Instead, it was all thrown back into a pit full of myth and weak belief structures. Who Are the Archangels of History?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"A rchangel Michael painted by Guido Reni at Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini, Rome, 1630, and placed above altar of St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican by 1757. A rchangel Michael Slaying A Dragon by Raphael (1483 – 1520). FIGHTING THE DEVILS, DRAGONS AND BAD PEOPLE HAVE BEEN THE BLOND ARCHANGELS SUCH AS MICHAEL, GABRIEL, URIEL AND RAPHAEL. WHO ARE THOSE ARCHANGELS? I don’t know. I’ve often wondered about that and if they are extraterrestrials. LIKE TAU CETI SANDY-HAIRED TALL ONES. That’s how they look. Zo and the other Tau Cetians aren’t as swashbuckling as the paintings I’ve seen from history of the archangels, but overall, Zo and his colleagues look very similar. TODAY, DO YOU WONDER IF THE ARCHANGELS WERE THE TAU CETI BEINGS INTERFERING WITH THE GREYS? I think that those from Tau Ceti and their immediate alliances are trying to upset the apple cart of those who have enslaved this planet. THEY ARE TRYING TO FREE HUMANITY? Exactly! And I think that’s been their motive all along. FREE HUMANITY FROM THE CLUTCHES OF THE POINTED CHIN GREYS AND BLACK HAIRY ONES."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Right. Future Outcome of Earth's Secret War? IN THE BLACK CUBE, DID YOU EVER SEE ANY PROJECTION IN TIME OF THE OUTCOME? No, I didn’t. There was nothing like that shown to me. I was left believing that regardless of what happens, that humanity continues on and it’s important that knowledge be carried forward so that future generations have access to higher realms of knowing. THE PERPETUATION OF KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE THROUGH EVERY INDIVIDUAL SOUL? Through persons taking responsibility to make sure that what they knew is continued. DO YOU THINK IT’S POSSIBLE THAT SURFACE LIFE ON THIS PLANET COULD BE COMPLETELY ERRADICATED, WHICH WOULD TAKE WITH IT ALL OF THE HISTORY OF CIVILIZATION UP TO THIS POINT? I think it’s quite possible that could happen. It’s happened before, according to Zo. THAT’S WHY I ASK: WOULD THE PRESERVATION OF KNOWLEDGE BE LEFT ONLY TO THE SOULS SINCE THE BODY CONTAINERS WOULD NOT SURVIVE? Bodies will survive. There will be those humans who do survive. It’s not going to be that there is no one left. But the way the information is stored and is accessible – well, that’s why they wrote on rocks after things like the Great Flood. They wrote and carved on rocks because rocks are more indestructible. Reincarnation Is Real The thing that is missing is the way the soul remembers the last life time and the need to remember it. For most people, it’s not important. But after this, it might be very important. YOU MEAN, THAT SOUL MEMORY HAS BEEN LARGELY SUBJECTED TO AMNESIA, BUT NOW AS TIME GOES FORWARD RECYCLING INTO BIRTH MIGHT BE MORE PEOPLE WHO REMEMBER INTIMATELY THE LIVES THAT THEY HAD IN THIS CENTURY AND LAST CENTURY? Right. THAT WOULD HELP PREVENT THE REPEATING OF THE SAME TERRIBLE MISTAKES. Sure, and that is an imperative. Zo showed me that the safest place on Earth is just a little south of the equator. DID THEY SPECIFY A REGION? South America is what was given to me, through Ecuador and across to the east coast. ARE YOU CONTEMPLATING MOVING DOWN THERE YOURSELF? I guess Kathy and I are waiting until the last minute. When we were in Peru, we were pretty much doing what we are doing today – working on the computer, planning out trips, searching for places to videotape and make into programs and exploring. But one day, Kathy and I both had the urgent feeling to get out of there. We had just bought a new washer and dryer, a new stove, a new refrigerator and had all sorts of stuff where we were living in a Lima, Peru apartment. But suddenly it was, ‘We’ve got to get out of here.’"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"BECAUSE? We did not know. We just knew we had to go. Then it was within 24 hours that the first seismic tremors shook and we could not even walk in our building because it was shaking back and forth so badly. There were more tremors. Then we were walking on the street and it felt like we sank into the earth because of the tremors. It was just the weirdest feeling. So, we shipped everything we wanted out of there by air freight from Lima and flew back to Arizona. We weren’t back here for even a week when an 8.0 earthquake hit Lima and just tore the hell out of Ica and Pisco. That was in 2007. A n 8.0 earthquake struck on August 15, 2007, 93 miles (150 kilometers) southeast of Lima, Peru, killing at least 450 people. The center of the destruction was in the city of Ica and nearby port of Pisco, about 125 miles (200 kilometers) southeast of the capital, Lima. The above image was taken in the port city of Callao, Peru, by Juan Carlos Guzman, AP. So, we had that inner knowing and we acted on it. I guess the point is that we know things are going to happen up here in the United States as well, and we can feel it coming closer. When the time comes, we’ll act on it when it’s appropriate, but until then, there are so many people that need help. I still can help a lot of people with healing energy as I have been. Zo and the others told me that after all these revolutionary changes, the new religion is going to be technology and God, not technology or God. Will Zo Return? AT AGE 48 IN 2001, YOU WERE EXPECTING ZO TO COME BACK EVERY HOW MANY YEARS? Every ten years. AND TODAY IN 2008, YOU ARE 55? Ye s . SO, YOU WOULD EXPECT HIM TO BE HERE IN THREE MORE YEARS IN 2011 WHEN YOU ARE 58? Well, I’m expecting him to show up in 2011. That’s when he’s supposed to be here. The way it always worked – I’d have my birthday on September 11, and by the middle of November at least, they would show up since I first met Zo back in 1967 in Kentucky. But Zo and the others did not show up last time on September 11, 2001 - that was 9/11. I don’t know why he didn't return and I don’t know if he will come again around September 11, 2011, but I sure hope so. I have a lot of questions to ask him.” More Information: For further information about the human abduction syndrome, please see my books and documentaries in the Earthfiles Shop and in the Earthfiles Archive: • 05/20/2008 — High Strangeness in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada • 04/29/2008 — Part 1: Insights from An Experiencer with Greys and Blond Humanoids • 04/06/2008 — Final Part 10: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 04/02/2008 — Part 9 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/30/2008 — Part 8 - Real X-File, Source Unknown"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"• 03/20/2008 — Part 7 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/15/2008 — Part 6 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/08/2008 — Part 5: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/04/2008 — Part 4: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/03/2008 — Updated Part 1: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/02/2008 — Part 2: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/02/2008 — Part 3: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 02/22/2008 — Updated: Three Eyewitnesses in Selden, Texas, Saw Two, Large Rectangles of “White Flames” in Sky • 02/14/2008 — Update: Mysterious Symbols Projected in Night Sky by Aerial Disc Near Stephenville, Texas, Local Airport • 02/08/2008 — Law Officers Describe Unidentified Shape-Shifting Aerial Craft in Stephenville, Texas, Region • 01/28/2008 — Updated 01-28-08: Viewer Letters About Aerial Craft and Military Flyovers Above Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas • 01/18/2008 — Updated: Huge Aerial Craft Over Dublin, Texas, “Longer Than 3 Football Fields” • 01/07/2008 — Part 15: In League With A UFO • 12/22/2007 — Part 10: In League With A UFO • 12/16/2007 — Part 8: In League With A UFO • 12/14/2007 — Part 7: In League With A UFO • 12/11/2007 — More Confirmation of May 1974 Discs in Albuquerque and Huge Cylinder Craft At White Sands Provi ng Ground. • 11/25/2007 — Part 4: In League With A UFO • 09/16/2007 — Part 5: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/11/2007 — Part 4: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/07/2007 — Part 3: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/05/2007 — Part 2: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 08/31/2007 — Part 1: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured! • 08/31/2007 — Part 2: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured! • 08/30/2007 — Part 1: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 07/31/2007 — Part 2, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards • 06/26/2007 — Part 1: Explanation of the Recent \"Strange Craft\" Sightings • 05/11/2007 — CIA Origin of National Enquirer? • 03/16/2007 — Tenth Anniversary of March 1997 Phoenix Lights: What Was the 2-Mile-Long Triangular Craft? • 02/18/2007 — Part 4: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 02/15/2007 — Grey Non-Human Floats in Air At New Orleans Defense Contractor Site • 02/14/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 02/12/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 02/11/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 01/26/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/26/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/26/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/08/2007 — Updated: Attorney Describes His Encounter with Non-Human Entities • 12/14/2006 — Abductee Jim Sparks's Encounter with Reptillian Beings, Their Warning and Possible Agenda • 10/11/2006 — Part 2: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee • 10/08/2006 — Part 1: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee • 09/29/2006 — Manipulation of Time and Matter by Non-Humans: The Experiences of Jim Sparks • 09/05/2006 — Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet? • 09/04/2006 — Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet? • 07/28/2006 — 1940s USAF Flight Surgeon's Account of E.
