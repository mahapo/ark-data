There was no evidence of any sawing or jagged edges or tearing, or anything like that. It was done very cleanly and very precisely.\" - C herie Good, D.V.M., Bothell, Washington B othell, Washington circled on the map is twelve miles northeast of Seattle, Washington, has a population of 32,985 and 23 parks. S eptember 12, 2003 Bothell, Washington - Domestic cat mutilations have been reported since at least the 1970s, and now more have turned up in Bothell, Washington. Twelve miles northeast of Seattle, Bothell is a city of 32,985 people, 23 parks and the Bothell Police Department has case files on three cat mutilations in May and June 2002, and three cat mutilations between August 1 and September 1, 2003. Not far to the northwest, Animal Control for the Vancouver, B. C. City Pound filed several mutilation reports in 1992 to 1994 on domestic cats found neatly cut in half without blood. Two of the 2003 Bothell cats were cut up into thirds and the middle part taken. The cat body portions left behind show on x-rays that all internal organs are missing except for the bladder, all without any blood on the animal or in the owner's or neighbor's yards where the dead cats have been discovered. Over the past several months in Salt Lake City, Utah, a dozen cats have also been found cut up the same bloodless way. In Denver, Colorado, more than forty small animals have been mutilated over the past couple of years and the Denver Dumb Friends League is offering a $12,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone found responsible. In Bothell, Washington, a non-profit group known as Pasado Safe Haven now has a $5,000 reward there. In addition to Bothell, Vancouver, Denver, and Salt Lake City, hundreds of other cat mutilations over the years have been reported in Falls Church, Virginia; Lee, New York; Los Alamos, New Mexico; Ahwatakee Foothills, Arizona; Plano and Austin, Texas; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Navarre and Pensacola, Florida; Tustin, San Diego and San Jose, California, London, England, and Toronto, Canada. In 1978 in St. Catharines near Toronto, Canada, authorities were frustrated by more than 100 missing cats and dogs and many others found in their owners' yards skinned, decapitated, disemboweled, cut in half or paws removed, without blood at the site. The New York Times Reported About Mutilated Cats T en years later on August 13, 1989, The New York Times reported that 67 cats had been found mutilated in Tustin, California - a suburb of Los Angeles near Santa Ana. The NYT "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"wrote: \"Some of them were cut in half with what some say is almost surgical precision, others disemboweled or skinned. One resident said, 'There is never any blood at the scene, the animals are often dismembered with surgical precision and paws and other body parts are often left on the ground in strikingly similar arrangements. No one ever seems to hear anything, nor do dogs bark during the killing.' It was believed the cats are captured, taken elsewhere, their blood drained and organs removed, then replaced on their owners' lawns.\" Bothell, Washington Cat Mutilations in August to September 2003 N ow it's happening again in Bothell, Washington, and so far all the victims have been males. The first case was reported the first week of August and the most recent was found September 1st. This week I talked with a veterinarian there who has examined the three mutilated cats in the past four weeks. She is Cherie Good, D.V.M., who runs The Cat Clinic at Canyon Park in Bothell. She received her Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine from Oklahoma State University in 1995 and has been practicing in the Bothell area since then, now exclusively for cats. Interview: First Mutilation, Cat Bloodlessly Cut Into Three Parts C herie Good, D.V.M., The Cat Clinic at Canyon Park (exclusively cat veterinary services), Bothell, Washington: \"The very first one we had was cut in thirds. The middle section of the animal was completely missing and all of his organs were missing, the entire thoracic contents, the stomach, liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys. The only thing that was left with him was his bladder was intact and a small section of the colon. The remains, the front third and the remaining third were put back in the owner's backyard the following day. The first case shown below also had a tremendous amount of dirt in the oral cavity and several nails were shredded indicating to me some kind of a struggle. Also, the first and third cases both had a very similar bone break high up in the neck region at the atlanto- occipital joint, basically where the head attaches to the neck. But there was very little bruising or any other lesion associated with it. M utilated male cat found in the first week of August 2003, bloodlessly cut into thirds with the middle section gone. Dr. Good is holding the cat's head in this photo to show the dirt inside the cat's mouth. Photograph © 2003 by Cherie Good, D.V.M., Bothell, Washington. WERE THEY IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER AS IF YOU WOULD SAY IF THE FIRST THIRD AND BACK THIRD WERE PUT TOGETHER, SO IT WAS LIKE A SHORT CAT? OR WERE THEY SEPARATED? It was very close proximity. In fact, the owner didn't even realize. They were in such shock, they didn't even realize that there was any of him missing. They actually thought he had been cut in half and that he was placed back that way."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"A bove, first mutilated male cat found cut in three parts first week of August 2003. Dr. Good laid cat out to show the correct width of severed and removed middle section of the cat. Below is an x-ray of the same cat showing the dark space in the back half that indicates all internal organs there have been removed. Photograph and x-ray © 2003 by Cherie Good, D.V.M. Y ou can see there is a very clear demarcation where the cuts were made. Then there is an obvious section of the spine that is missing which should be connecting there and the entire abdominal and thoracic contents are missing and that's very clearly visible on the radiograph. Everything is missing from there. What you are getting is that entire space is filled with air as opposed to intestinal contents which would show up whiter or with tissue density like the muscles of the legs would be. If you are looking at everything else around the cat on the outside of the cat, it shows up black. That's just air. That's not going to radiograph at all. It doesn't have any density to it. So it's showing up dark in the central section because there are no contents in there except for the bladder in the very last part of the colon there. A rrow points at remaining bladder and small section of pink colon, the only organs remaining in the back half of the first mutilated male cat found in Bothell the first week of August 2003. Photograph © 2003 by Cherie Good, D.V.M. Second Mutilation, Only Back Third Found T he second case, we don't have quite as much evidence with him because what was found with him was just the back third and the owner had buried him. She knew it was a mutilation, but she hadn't thought that there was any pattern or had not heard about any of the other reports going on. She had a friend of hers exhume that part of the body and we did a necropsy on him, too, and that was a similar presentation: just the bladder and the colon were left in that back section.

Third Mutilation Case, Police Think Occurred Within Six Hour Time Period T he last case we had, the most recent one, was only slightly different, but the same kind of presentation that he was missing somewhere between the early AM hours and then was returned to the neighbor's yard where the cat would hang out quite often and visit the neighbor's kitten through the window. With his case, he wasn't cut completely in half, but there was one very precise incision made from the backbone down to the mid portion of the stomach, right behind the rib cage, and again, the entire thoracic contents were missing, including the diaphragm. Very clean cuts in the trachea and esophagus and then at the colon and the bladder was remaining and he was placed back in the neighbor's yard, too. They (police) are pretty sure this mutilation took place within a period of six hours. In the first couple of cases, the cats might have been gone for about a day, but not more than 24 hours.

X-ray © 2003 by Cherie Good, D.V.M. Precise, Bloodless Excisions F ROM YOUR PROFESSIONAL PERSPECTIVE AS A VETERINARIAN, WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT SURGICAL CUTS IN ALL THREE ANIMALS? They are very precise cuts. I don't know if surgical is the right term to use for it, but it's something that took what had to be a very sharp instrument with very precise cuts. What was done to the cats was done with three or four cuts and that was it. There was no evidence of any sawing or jagged edges or tearing, or anything like that. It was done very cleanly and very precisely. THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT WHOEVER DID THIS KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING MEDICALLY? Medically? For me, it seems you would have to know a little bit about anatomy to know what you were going after specifically. It wouldn't have to be specifically cat anatomy. It would be very similar with dog anatomy or other small animals, the same kinds of things missing would be pretty uniform from the cat to the dog. So, (the mutilators) have to have some kind of knowledge about what they are going for. The purpose of what they are going for, I don't know. WAS THERE ANY FLUID BLOOD IN ANY OF THE REMAINING PARTS OF THE CATS OR ON THE GROUND AROUND THEM? In the first two cases, there was not evidence of any. In the third case, there was maybe what I estimated to be about 20 or 30 cc's of blood remaining in the cavity. But there"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"wasn't anything else around the ground area that they could see. WAS THERE ANYTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT THE BLOOD IN THAT THIRD ANIMAL YOU EXAMINED? It was not clotted which indicated to me it was very fresh. Why Are Cat Remains Returned to Home Neighborhood? IN YOUR EIGHT YEARS OF WORKING AS A PRACTICING VETERINARIAN, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANY OTHER CASES LIKE THESE THREE BEFORE? No. And I never thought I would either. That's not something I fathomed. I've heard about cat mutilations and I have seen other animals that have been abused in various ways, but I've never seen something this deliberate and purposeful, especially with the remains being placed back to the owners to find it. THAT'S PUZZLING, ISN'T IT? WHY ARE THE BODIES RETURNED? Right. ANY SP ECULATION? I have no idea. There is obviously a point trying to be made, but it's something that's just very, very disturbing. I've heard cases before that are somewhat cult or Satanic-related or something like that and I don't even begin to understand what goes on with that. But I've heard about rituals before where they are using the heart for some purpose, whatever that might be, but I don't think in any of those cases that I've heard an animal has been placed back for the owners to find. AND IN SATANIC CULT OPERATIONS THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN INVESTIGATING REPORTS ABOUT SATANIC CULT OPERATIONS WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT, BLOOD IS ALWAYS INVOLVED. AND THE THING THAT IS EERIE ABOUT CAT MUTILATIONS AND SMALL ANIMAL MUTILATIONS AROUND THE WORLD, IS THEY ARE SO BLOOD-LESS. Right. Yeah, and these are very clean. Bothell Police Call in Federal U.S.D.A. Forensics Expert DID YOU EXAMINE IN EACH CAT HOW THE SPINE WAS SEVERED TO DIVIDE THEM INTO THREES? DOES THERE SEEM TO BE A GLASSY SURFACE AS IF THEY HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO HIGH HEAT? That, I did not get. I do know that all the bodies that are being examined by somebody else who is more or a specialist in that field. The necropsies we did initially. I mean we are no way a forensic specialist, so I wouldn't be able to determine that. All I can say is they were clean cuts, but I have no idea by what kind of instrumentation it was done. WHO IS DOING THAT KIND OF FOLLOW UP WORK? It's somebody that the police are dealing with. We are supposed to get the bodies back actually returned to the owners so we can have them for private cremation. But I believe that's in the police's hands right now. I know they are going with someone associated with the U.S.D.A., so it's a federal case at this time. DID THE BOTHELL POLICE CALL THE FEDS IN? Yes, they did after the third case, they finally started believing that it was more than just an animal attack.\" More Information: $5,000 Reward Offered in Bothell, Washington I n Bothell, the non-profit organization called Pasado Safehaven is offering a $5,000 reward for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone responsible for the cat mutilations."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"P revious Earthfiles.com Reports About Domestic Cat Mutilations.
