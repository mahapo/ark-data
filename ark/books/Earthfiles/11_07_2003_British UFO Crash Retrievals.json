His work has appeared in Military Illustrated , Eye-Spy , UFO Magazine and the London Daily Express . He is the author of four books: A Covert Agenda © 1997, The FBI Files © 1998, Cosmic Crashes © 2000 and Strange Secrets, Real Government Files on the Unknown , co-authored with Andy Roberts © 2003. In the Foreword of the latest book, Strange Secrets , Redfern wrote: \"It should be noted that the nature of intelligence work requires agencies to obtain information on just about anything and everything that might conceivably have a bearing on national security. Therefore, it is really not at all surprising that documentation on 'the unknown' has been created and studied at an official level. \"But for years, the official files on these and other mysteries were tightly held under the strictest security. With the passing of legislation such as the U. S. government's Freedom of Information Act in the 1970s and the more recent British government's Thirty Year Ruling, that security blanket has, to a degree at least, begun to ease - to the extent that we can now safely say that 'the truth is indeed out there.'\" In the process of filing for access to American and British documents concerning the UFO phenomenon and spending a lot of time in the British Public Record Office outside London, Nick Redfern has discovered evidence of both real crash retrievals of unidentified vehicles in England and disinformation by government and military officials which imply a psychological warfare operation that has been going on for at least half a century and which muddies the water for anyone trying to see clear facts about an alleged non-human interaction with Earth life. This week I talked with Nick about what he considers to be one of the hardest factual cases of a UFO crash retrieval in Great Britain.

"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Interview: Nick Redfern, Journalist and Author, Mederland, Texas: \"There is one case above all others I have investigated which to me suggests that something very unusual was recovered. The genesis of this case goes back to Leonard Stringfield and in his July 1991 UFO Crash/Retrievals: The Inner Sanctum, Status Report VI the biggest one he ever wrote. He included details of an alleged UFO crash in England in 1964 in an area near Penkridge, Staffordshire, which is an area of the Cannock Chase which is a huge forest in Staffordshire, England, which extends for miles and miles. In his report, Stringfield talks about how he was contacted by a source who knew about a crashed UFO incident in this Staffordshire forest in early 1964. Pages 72-73, UFO Crash/Retrievals: The Inner Sanctum, Status Report VI by Leonard H. Stringfield July 1991 \"OVER THERE\" Some time in 1964, \"somewhere at sea,\" between the Caribbean and the Atlantic, a specially rigged LST, a flagship (AKA, \"spy ship\") for a naval amphibious force, received a coded radio message in its \"crypto-machine\" room, which reported that \"artifacts\" had been retrieved with three dead personnel. According to my informant, former Third Class Petty Officer, S. M. Brannigan (pseudonym) who was a specialist trained to translate intercepted Russian transmissions, the decoded report stated that a UFO had crashed in two parts: the main section near Penkridge in Staffordshire, England; and the remains in West Germany. He further stated that the retrievals of the parts and the occupants were conducted by Air Force Intelligence and shipped to Wright-Patterson AFB. He added that U. S. and other NATO interceptors were involved. Brannigan admitted there was more to the incident, involving coded information, that he preferred to keep confidential. The Brannigan disclosure, while sketchy, might spotlight only the tip of the iceberg as to the scope of military crash/retrieval operations in foreign lands. Researchers know that reports of crashes are worldwide, from pole to pole, on every continent, and in many countries even in remote Madagascar. If such incidents are to be secreted, it is my suspicion that U. S. special retrieval teams have been, and still are, prepared to \"go into action\" into any crash location within its sphere of military or economic influence such as was exercised with NATO in the \"artifact\" retrievals in England and West Germany.\" Penkridge, Staffordshire, England, near the center of Great Britain. Several years ago I looked into this case when I was still living back in England around 1995 to 1996. Myself and a colleague began looking into the case and put adverts in local newspapers to see if anyone from the time recalled the incident. Several people came forward talking about how they recalled military roadblocks in the area and people being diverted out of the site where some sort of incident had taken place."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The most important eyewitness of all was a man named Harold South, who was working in the area at the time. He told us he witnessed the recovery of some sort of small triangular-shaped object that was loaded aboard a military transport vehicle and was taken out of the area. He also told us that shortly afterward, he was contacted in his home by the military and local police and had his camera confiscated. He had actually covertly photographed this object being recovered from the forest. He said his camera was confiscated which he later got back in the mail, but the pictures were never returned to him. This was one of these typical crash retrieval accounts that we hear on numerous occasions. What kind of set this one apart for me and convinced me there was a great deal more to it was the fact that when I and my colleague went to interview him at this house in December 1996, he was kind of perturbed and upset when we arrived. We asked him what was wrong. He said that in between us speaking with him on the telephone before leaving my house in the morning and arriving his house, he had received a weird phone call from somebody identifying themselves as working for the Ministry of Defence suggesting that he not talk to us. Now this guy has no particular interest in the UFO subject. He's now about 73, elderly and retired, and lives in a small apartment in central England. We kind of looked at each other and asked: Is this genuine or a fantasist? In England, you have something called a 1471 telephone system kind of similar to the States where you can dial and it will give you the number of the last person who telephoned in. So, what we did is ask him, 'Can we dial 1471?' He said, 'Yes.' We did that and lo' and behold, we got a number which was an internal British Army telephone number at a place called Whittington Army Barracks in Central England. We traced the call back to a division called the Ministry of Defence Guard Service and we were able to confirm that the call had been made to his home at the time in question from the MOD Guard Service. When we tracked it down to the internal department and got through to them, they wouldn't speak to us. But we were able to confirm at least that a call had been made. This kind of begs the question: what would be so important about the recovery of some sort of object in a Staffordshire field 40 years ago that today is requiring the MOD and the military to keep under surveillance the key witness to the case? That's the only time I've really been blown away by the fact that a 70-year-old witness seemed to be kept under some sort of surveillance for more than 40 years to the extent where within 10 minutes of us telephoning him, he received a call suggesting that he not talk about this case. And he described the object as a strange triangular-shaped thing which did not have any markings, was kind of a dull grey color, and seemed to be built out of one piece of formed metal without wings, without markings or anything like that at all. That case convinced me more than any other that there have been unusual recoveries within the U. K. of some sort of object. British Technical and Scientific Intelligence Branch Interested in Human Abductees WHAT IS THE VERY STRANGEST THING YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD, EVEN IF YOU COULD NOT VERIFY IT? I guess the strangest thing I've ever been told does not relate directly to crashed UFOs but I was told that there is a department within the Technical and Scientific Intelligence Branch of the MOD that had an interest in so-called UFO abductees. Apparently some paper or report had been put together. I'm not sure if this was an official report or put together by people within the technical division that had a personal interest. But nonetheless, it was co-authored by three or four people from within the TSIB and it dealt with fears or concerns on their part that a number of abductees if not all abductees have been kind of pre-programmed for some sort of future event that will involve a worldwide"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"catastrophe on the Earth like a nuclear exchange, or something like that. But afterward in the ruins of the planet, these people would have some specific task to perform on behalf of someone else. The fact they had been lined up to carry out this role concerned the Technical Intelligence people that this sort of nuclear holocaust was inevitable, preplanned and that these survivors would have some sort of role to play afterward. The whole angle was: if we can understand why these people will be involved, perhaps we can understand why this nuclear exchange is going to occur. So it's going to be some sort of Judgment Day type event in the near future involving UFOs and that alien abductees are somehow going to be involved in the aftermath of reconstruction or whatever happens to the planet afterwards. IF ANY OF THAT WERE TRUE, THEN GOVERNMENTS WOULD NOT WANT ANY OF THIS TO COME OUT UNTIL THE VERY END BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE THE PROBLEM OF CONTROLLING SOCIAL AND POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS. Yes, I think that is the case. And unfortunately in England, the whole government exists under this veil of secrecy and keeping information classified is very easy.. I'll give you a good example: back in 1980, I tried to access files of the British Air Ministry's old Scientific and Technical Division (STD) from the late 1940s. Although some files have been declassified in recent years, in 1990 I was told on the record in a letter from the Public Record Office which is the British equivalent of the American National Archives that some of the STD files have been classified for up to 100 years. There were no legislation back then to appeal the release of this material. It will be sitting on the shelf for 100 years and then whoever is around at that time can determine if it can be declassified. This goes to show that government secrecy is endemic and can be put into place very easily. Over the last few years, there have been Freedom of Information legislation in England and a number of files have surfaced from later years such as one file on the Rendlesham Forest case of December 1980, as well as the 1970s and 1960s. Contained within those files, there are quite a few reports of UFO encounters submitted by military pilots, airline pilots, radar operators. Significantly, this is something that will interest you even though it veers from the UFO crash angle. Crop Circles in Early 1940s A number of crop circle reports have surfaced, historical ones, contained within the official files. I talk about some of these files in Strange Secrets . The earliest ones I've been able to document officially date from the early 1940s when Britain's MI5 (FBI equivalent in U. S.) began receiving reports of strange crop formations found in mainland Europe at the height of the Second World War. The initial thought was that these were some kind of coded ground markings for German pilots informing them where to bomb, encoded messages. But this theory was not born out upon investigation. It's kind of left unknown beyond the fact that these weird formations were found in European fields. Nobody knew what they were. I guess the important point is that because these files had been declassified officially and could be verified as being genuine and from the time period in question we know these predate the modern day interest in crop circles and I guess the idea that somebody would go hoax crop circles in war torn Europe when bombs were dropping in those areas, defies belief. WERE THERE ANY PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE CROP FORMATIONS IN THE EARLY 1940S? There are references to photographs, but they aren't in the files. What is in the files are photographs of some British formations which turned out to have prosaic explanations where farmers had been driving tractors around a field. But British aircraft have been ordered to fly over mainland England and report any formations that have been seen in England and they reported back having found"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"several different formations in the south of England. British agents would go out and interview the farmers, but most of these came down to an explanation. But this goes to show that British intelligence was taking an interest in strange crop formations to the extent that they actually sent agents out to the homes and asked farmers if people made the formations for themselves and what does it mean? Or was it just that you were raking the corn? Or something else? That was kind of an eye-opening fact that surfaced directly as a result of the Freedom of Information legislation in England. One other case of a similar nature from 1964 that I found in the MOD files was a straightforward circle found on farm land in the north of England. The night prior to the formation having been found, the key witness reported seeing this strange column like electric blue light hovering above the field. Then the next day, he went down to see if anything was there and here was this big circle. This was 1964, 40 years ago, and again, shows that long before the modern day interest in crop circles surfaced, the MOD had quite a few records of this nature already on file.\" March 23, 1964 letter from T. R. T. Burbury, Rector, Clifton Rectory, Pearith, Cumberland, England to Scientific and Industrial Research, London, concerning blue light and grass circle.

More Information: 1948 - First Book About UFOs Was Published in England As A N o ve l Nick Redfern: \"In 1948 in England, a book was published called, The Flying Saucer . It is probably the first book ever published on UFOs, but it is actually a novel written by a man named Bernard Newman. Newman for many years had alleged links with British intelligence."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" The Flying Saucer © 1948 by Bernard Newman, published in England, is the first known book about the crashed flying saucer phenomenon, even though written as a fictional novel. How could Bernard Newman, known to have links with British intelligence, have written such a book and had it published in less than a year of the alleged July 1947 crashes of \"extraterrestrial aerial vehicles\" in New Mexico? When people actually see the book, people express amazement at the content of it because it deals with kind of a supersecret organization (MJ-12?) made of elite scientists and military people throughout the United States who staged three crashed UFO incidents. They actually built prototype flying saucers and crashed them. One crashes in New Mexico, interestingly enough. One in Britain and one in Russia. But these aren't extraterrestrial spacecraft. They are just mockups. The whole idea is to create a kind of New World order where the whole human race will be scared by this alien threat and we'll all unite in some one world go vern men t . To reinforce the reality of the crashed UFOs, the scientists actually fake and stage an alien autopsy which, of course, has a lot of tie-ins with what is going on today with the (Ray Santilli) alien autopsy controversy. Not only that, when the UFOs crashed, to make them look more believable, they paint strange hieroglyphics on the recovered wreckage. Of course, as you know, hieroglyphics, alien autopsies that may or may not be the real thing are staple parts of the whole UFO controversy. But the Bernard Newman book was actually written 55 years ago and includes all these key ingredients. MAY I ASK A QUESTION HERE: IF THIS MAN BERNARD NEWMAN HAD CONNECTIONS WITH COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE ON THE U.S. SIDE, OR BRITISH SIDE, OR BOTH: IS IT NOT JUST AS LOGICAL TO ASSUME THAT THEY WERE ANTICIPATING THAT THEY HAD A PROBLEM ON THEIR HANDS IN TERMS OF UNIDENTIFIED CRAFT AND ENTITIES INTERACTING WITH THE PLANET AND THEY WANTED VERY MUCH TO BE ABLE TO MUDDY THE WATERS AND TO PUT A BOOK OUT THAT WOULD PUT ALL OF THIS IN IT MIGHT BE AN ANTICIPATION OF WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE DEALING WITH AND IF IT WERE IN FICTION THEN PERHAPS IT WOULD BE DISMISSED AS GOVERNMENT CONTAMINATION? That's quite true, Linda. I think there are several ways of looking at this. The problem is that 55 (1948) to 56 years ago (1947), the key players in this aren't around any more. But I think it's intriguing that whatever happened in the New Mexico desert of 1947 that in less than 12 months, Bernard Newman had a book written and published that talked about the UFO crash in the New Mexico desert with strange hieroglyphics found on the object, followed by the creation of a faked alien autopsy to try to convince people that this is an alien spacecraft. I don't pretend to have the key answers about what really happened at Roswell"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"or elsewhere in the summer of 1947, but I think it's intriguing that 55 years after Newman's book was published that things like Majestic-12, the alien autopsy film are being discussed and look back at his book and see that it contains this supersecret organization involved in UFO incidents and alien autopsies, plus the whole hieroglyphic issue which I think I'm correct in saying: the issue of hieroglyphics being found on the debris at Roswell really wasn't emphasized until people like Jesse Marcel Sr. and Jr. began talking about it in the 1970s and 1980s. And yet, in Newman's book it was talked about as far back as 1948 when it was published. So, that would suggest that somehow he had information that whatever was recovered at Roswell or in the New Mexico desert did have hieroglyphics on it. I actually have done this. I have talked with several intelligence people. And the one story which is kind of unanimous in all accounts is this: if there ever has been a genuine UFO crash, then the best way to hide it is by releasing crashed UFO stories which upon investigation turn out to be bogus or questionable. If there ever has been a real one, then the bogus ones cast the seeds of doubt onto that one as well. The story that's been given to me is that the best way to hide a secret is among a whole mass of lies and disinformation.\" This 2003 book can be purchased through either: amazon.com or Paraview Pocket Books.
