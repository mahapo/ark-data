Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Large Triangle Over Albuquerque © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe April 22, 1999 Albuquerque, NM Very large, triangular-shaped aerial craft have been reported during the 1980's and 90's over the United States and other parts of the world. In 1997, several eyewitnesses in Arizona estimated that one unidentified aerial triangle was almost two miles long. (See 03/13/97 Earthfiles, Large Triangle Over Phoenix, Azizona.) Now, on April 22, 1999 just before midnight, Tony Chapparo of Albuquerque, New Mexico walked to the second story balcony of his house. He was facing east toward the Sandia Mountains when he looked up toward the zenith. Interview: Tony Chapparo, Albuquerque, New Mexico: As I was looking up toward the stars, I noticed three amber-colored lights that formed a perfect triangle. And they weren't there at first. As far as I could tell, they just appeared there. They didn't come from across the sky. DID THEY SEEM TO POP IN OR FADE IN? They seemed to fade in more than pop in. AND THE COLOR WOULD BE LIKE CANTALOUPE, OR WHAT? Yeah, that would be a good description. SO CANTALOUPE, THE FLESH OF A CANTALOUPE ORANGE. Right. AND AS YOU'RE STANDING THERE NOW TALKING TO ME ON THE PHONE, IF YOU EXTENDED YOUR HAND AWAY FROM YOU, WOULD THE LIGHT BE AS BIG AS THE END OF YOUR LITTLE FINGER OR SMALLER OR LARGER? I would say a little larger than my little finger. AND ABOUT HOW HIGH IN THE NIGHT SKY DO YOU THINK THESE LIGHTS WERE? That would be a hard thing to tell. That's not something I'd ever seen before. Just a rough guess, maybe 10,000 feet. Almost straight up, not quite straight up and I just saw these lights fade in, these amber colored lights fade in. I'd say the object stayed motionless for one or two seconds. And then, it took off in a northerly direction and I'd estimate the speed would be 4 or 5 times the rate of a commercial airliner. So, it took off pretty fast. NOW, IN BETWEEN THE THREE AMBER LIGHTS SORT OF THE COLOR OF THE INSIDE OF A CANTALOUPE, WERE YOU SEEING DARKNESS OR WHAT? Yes. It was completely dark. SO YOU WERE SEEING A DARK TRIANGLE THAT HAD THESE AMBER LIGHTS AT THE THREE CORNERS? "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Right. And I also wanted to add that this triangle had absolutely no sound whatsoever. It was completely silent which surprised me. I didn't really know what I was looking at at the time. I was just amazed at what I was looking at. It was nothing I had ever seen before. AND HOW BIG WOULD YOU SAY THIS TRIANGLE WAS UP ABOUT 10,000 F EET? The best way I could describe that would be if I were to stretch my hand out in the sky. It would reach from my index finger to my palm would be its length. And the width would be roughly from my little finger to my thumb. It was fairly large. THAT IS PRETTY BIG. That's the best I could describe the size. I really don't know what I was looking at at the time. AND WHEN IT MOVED OFF, DID ANYTHING CHANGE IN THOSE ORANGE LIGHTS? No, the color didn't change. They didn't flash. They stayed steady. The position of the lights didn't change at all. AND THE BLACKNESS -- YOU COULDN'T SEE STARS THROUGH IT IN ANY WAY? No, not that I could tell. IT WAS JUST A SOLID OPAQUE BLACK TRIANGLE, ALMOST NEAR ZE N IT H ? That's correct. IN YOUR GUT, DO YOU THINK YOU WERE LOOKING AT SOMETHING TERRESTRIAL OR NOT? I would say not terrestrial. And my gut feeling would be I don't think we have any technology that could duplicate what I saw.\" Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
