Here begins Part 1 of Status Report VI, from July 1991. These status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Status Report VII begins at Earthfiles 12/15/03 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994.

Through the Looking Glass Lewis Carroll PROLOGUE: If, And, But and Maybe Maybe we're on the edge of the beginning to end official UFO secrecy. Maybe, if I should be so bold to say, the probes of organized research are finally breaching its protective fortressed walls. Like some of my contemporaries, I believe I see signs that something big is happening, perhaps a re-shaping of policy, that has hidden Above Top Secret information, harking back to the days before the Roswell incident. But, considering all of the new information I have received in the past six months, I wonder who is really doing the breaching? Can it be the result of aggressive research with its ever-growing and powerful phalanx of professionals who are probing and banging at the Sanctum's door? Is it forcing a more lenient policy? Or, is the so-called \"breach\" coming from inside the wall? If so, we might ask, is officialdom's smug sanctity being jeopardized by some new and dire UFO development pressing a decision to go public? Or, maybe, there is an internal squabble that precipitated some of the leaks. Whatever the case, if indeed there is a case, there are enough other straws in the wind of an extraordinary nature that have come my way, some of which are published in this report. Speaking of \"straws\" - perhaps a controlled one - on July 19, 1991, five former astronauts appeared together on the popular CBS-TV show, Oprah Wi n f re y , in commemoration of the Apollo missions to the moon. One of the guests, Dr. Edgar Mitchell, pilot for Apollo Mission 14, commented, \"...I do believe there is a lot more known about extraterrestrial "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"investigation than is available to the public right now. Has been for a long time.\" Oprah asked, \"Why do you think it is kept from the public?\" Said Mitchell, \"That's a long story. It goes back to World War II when all that happened and is highly classified stuff.\" On the other hand, conceivably some of my recent input might be another clever ploy of disinformation carefully contrived to backfire. For those of us with suspicious minds, a close look into a number of disclosures in this report would easily find some questionable loose-ends; for instance, statements made by one informant that are in conflict with those made by others. Or a statement purported to be fact that does not jibe with a fact known by credible researchers. Any or all of those irregularities need answers, although we must also allow for human error, perhaps a rhetorical slip or a fading memory. Again, I regret - without apology for - the anonymity of some of the contributing sources. I have no choice; they make the rules. In this report is an abundance of firsthand and some secondhand information. Some of it is anecdotal. Some of it is substantive backup to key crash/retrieval cases such as Roswell and Kecksburg. Some of it recounts my own experiences, observations and misadventures in the pursuit of my special research. All of these pieces fit into the mystery matrix of the UFO. All of them should be made known to researchers. Somewhere in this broad spectrum lies the bedrock of proof. But for sure, no matter how much bona fide information is released here, or by others, it might forever remain in the realm of hearsay and disbelief until there is an official acknowledgement or admission that it is a fact. Leonard H. Stringfield July 25, 1991 INTRODUCTION It is a literary quirk, or a license, among writers to start off their story or essay or article or whatever, with a strong \"narrative hook,\" or something \"hot,\" to get instant reader interest. But my opening copy I had prepared for this report was low-key - perhaps \"ho hum,\" to some readers as I review the current status quo of research. Then when Robert Dean's statement arrived, which I had requested after our phone conversation on May 26, 1991, I thought his disclosures would be my narrative hook, which follows: Statement by Robert O. Dean, Command Sergeant Major (Ret.) was on NATO staff at Strategic Headquarters, Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE) in the mid-1960s. Dean claims he saw a \"Cosmic Top Secret\" briefing document on UFOs. No copy of the alleged \"Assessment\" has ever been seen in public. Robert O. Dean Statement: 1. A thorough and comprehensive study was established in early 1961 at SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters, Allied Powers Europe). SHAPE was and is the Military Arm of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization). 2. The study was directed by Air Marshall, Sir Thomas Pike (British) who was Deputy SACEUR (Supreme Allied Commander Europe). Pike was Deputy to General Lyman Lemnitzer, U. S. Army, who had the equivalent rank of five stars. 3. The study was titled, Assessment , with a subtitle of 'An Evaluation"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"of A Possible Military Threat to Allied Forces in Europe.' 4. The study was established and conducted out of frustration because no information was provided by either Washington, D. C. or London on the continuing problem of unidentified objects flying over the Soviet Union, Central Europe and NATO military installations at will. Several instances of massive formation flyovers had almost triggered hostilities between the NATO forces and the Warsaw pact forces. (Washington and London were purposely not providing information because everything that was given to NATO went directly to Moscow via an enormous French spy ring located in Paris.) This eventually was broken and several top French ministers either were eliminated or killed themselves (See the TOPAZ scandal and the Columbine group; i.e., URIS-TOPAZ.) 5. The assessment study was finally published in 1964. Only fifteen copies were ever produced. The complete package with annexes was eight inches thick. It contained testimony, interviews, photographs and in-depth studies by historians, theologians, atmospheric physicists, astronomers, astrophysicists, sociologists and psychologists. 6. The area studied covered all of the NATO theater of operations from northern Norway all the way south to Turkey and Greece. There were photographs of crash/retrievals, little bodies and some limited analysis of 'plasti-metals' which they didn't seem to understand, but human-types never crashed. (This was in 1964). It concluded that: a. The planet Earth was the subject of an extensive and very thorough survey by 'several' extraterrestrial civilizations. b. 'They' demonstrated extremely advanced technology - possibly a thousand years or more beyond us. (I personally think we are dealing with millions (of years in advance). c. There was a 'Process' or 'Plan' of some kind unfolding. The study demonstrated that a development of some process was taking place (one-on-one contact). d. Evidence indicated that this has been going on for several millennia. e. There did not appear to be a major military threat involved. If they were hostile, there was absolutely nothing we could do. Needless to say, Len, the study caused a few serious psychological reactions among several of the top generals. The Air Deputy, General Robert Lee, U.S. Air Force, was quite 'disturbed.' 7. The French government (Charles DeGaulle) withdrew France from the military alliance and we were forced to move SHAPE from Roquencourt (just outside of Paris) to Casteau (near Brussels) in 1967. At this point, the French copy of the Assessment was called back. We were pretty certain that they copied it because just after that, they established G.E.P.A.N. (French research of UFOs) under the gendarmerie. One French army source, it was recently confirmed, who knew about Assessment , was Colonel Jean Fauvre. 8. I was assigned to SHAPE in 1963 and helped move the headquarters to the new site in Belgium in 1967. During my assignment, I was a Master Sergeant with a Cosmic Top Secret clearance. I worked in the Operations Division and was a member of the Inner Command Staff, thereby working with and seeing General Lemnitzer almost every day. Len, I have names, dates and many details of the Assessment . I did not copy it because if I had, I would probably be in Fort"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Leavenworth right now. End of Dean Statement UFOLOGY'S HOT KITCHEN Len Stringfield: Triggered by the recent influx of information from new and trusted old sources, my saucer sleuthing spirit was once again aroused. When the war in the Persian Gulf ended, kindling new patriotic fervor in the USA, my buoyant response was to concentrate on following up on each and every new lead. The result: Status Report VI. My timing seems right, too, for some aspects of my newly amassed evidence might help to offset the recent signs of malaise, mixed with frustration, infiltrating the rank and file of research. At least it might provide some new digestible fodder for objective debate, a relief from the noise we are hearing about the rancors of in-fighting among our celebrated researchers, or the sensationalist tales predicting doomsday; or the latest inside stuff channeled from our space brothers; or perhaps, the alien takeover of a secret underground base at Groom Lake (Area 51, Nellis AFB, Nevada), ad infinitum. Typical of this trend of disquiet I quote, in part, from a letter received from a no-nonsense veteran, Herb Taylor, of Oceanside, New York, dated March 10, 1991: \"For all practical purposes, serious UFO research in the greater New York City area really does not exist. In general, with a few exceptions, I find myself appalled at the state of UFOlogy today. There seems to be an abundance of disreputable and dubious persons associated with the field. Wild and outrageous theories, spec ulations and al legations abound...\" Certainly other areas fare better. But, if we want to look for troubled zones which have caused doubts and misgivings everywhere, we need go no further than in the arena of abductions. This phase, in my view, where human rights are violated, and where unfortunately, anybody can get into the act for fame or fortune, is unquestionably serious business and deservedly our hottest topic. I do, however, question the fiery and unceasing disputes over the same blockbuster cases which hark back to the Betty and Barney Hill days, continuing on through the Walton and Andreasson affairs and now, the Walters' Gulf Breeze inquisition and the concern over the issue of whether or not Whitley Strieber's \"communion\" with humanoids was spiritual, psychic or physical. Each of these highly promoted cases might have their loose ends. But they also involve only one or perhaps a few persons. Whatever the eventual outcome - good, bad or inconclusive - it will not be a UFOlogical disaster. For the sake of statistics, each is important, but no more or no less so than the thousands of other cases which have not been promoted or published. But far more serious were the bitter clashes that had developed between the prime investigators of the Roswell crash event. While legal actions were threatened at one time by Bill Moore, author of The Roswell Incident, against Stan Friedman and, separately, against Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt, authors of UFO Crash At Roswell, the rehash of details is now pointless in light of new peace overtures. On August 4, Friedman - accused for breach of contract - called me to confirm that he and Moore had met and patched up their differences. I can only hope that any and all grievances can be amicably settled between all parties and that the credibility of the Roswell crash will be free of a polluted atmosphere. As in any scientific or professional endeavor involving the egos of humankind, the Roswell tiff is not alone in the broad sweep of UFOlogy. Until absolute, unequivocal proof surfaces, or the officials admit that Roswell is for real, the skeptics will be heard. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Animal mutilations, the crop circles (or as Dr. Bruce Maccabee suggests, agriglyphs), bigfoot, the face on Mars - they all have problems gaining acceptance because most people cannot face up to bizarre happenings that might cause their traditional beliefs to be shattered. Certainly, in retrospect, no issue has fared worse than the subject of crashed UFOs, which I initially presented in my paper, Retrievals of the Third Kind, at the MUFON Symposium in Dayton, Ohio, in 1978. Typical intellectual disbelief came in a commentary by Hilary Evans, editor of a British book entitled UFOs 1947-1987 , who had requested an article by me for inclusion. I entitled mine The Chase for Proof in a Squirrel's Cage. Albeit in his own literary contribution, he debunked UFOs suggesting that most, if not all, might be an illusion of sorts, perhaps a result of mass psychosis or a social mental disorder. Questioning the popular belief that a UFO cover-up existed, he took a swipe at my research papers. Thus, \"... the crash/retrieval syndrome has broughyt forth a tantalizing quantity of intriguing testimony. Unfortunately, every bit of it is either ambiguous or of uncertain provenance, and the possibility remains that it has all been fabricated by the alleged informants.\" In the United States, as my five status reports progressed from 1978 through 1988, reviews from writers who failed to understand why many of my sources were anonymous were warm to cool to cold. However, people's rationales sometimes change. Jerry Clark, for one, editor of the International UFO Reporter , who had taken me to task in my early days dramatically switched, changing his views from skeptic to a believer. Thanks to Roswell, other writers have also mellowed. I no longer feel alone. While I might feel relieved personally, it remains hard for me to believe that there is still a vocal contingent that follows the Phil Klass dictum which postulates that unexplained UFOs do not exist. Then there are others who will allow for an unidentified \"nut and bolt\" craft, but to them it is a secret U. S. aircraft of some sort - maybe something that the Germans developed during WWII. As the story goes, their top scientists who had experimented with a disc-like craft, were whisked away from their labs in Pennemunde when the war ended and smuggled into the United States (Project Paperclip.) While testing their machines, so the story continues, some aborted and crashed. Thus, the crashes near Roswell and so on. All skeptics dismiss out of hand any notion of an extraterrestrial visitation as astronomically improbable, if not impossible. In the forefront is astronomer Carl Sagan, Ph.D. For public consumption, he takes a dim view of the alien UFO from outer space. Space flight from any star system, he avers, is next to impossible and he uses figures in the \" billions and billions\" to establish rules for its incredulity. Extraterrestrially speaking, Jacques Vallee and Allen J. Hynek (both astronomers), also have spoken Saganese publicly. But the origin of their UFO, because of its paranormal behavior, is even more exotic. To explain these anomalies, they seek answers in extra-dimensional or in other parallel realms. While these erudite rationales might be mumbo jumbo to the general public, it is the kind of mystical package that has opened the eyes of many UFOlogists - especially those frustrated after years of waiting for proof of extraterrestrial visitors. I do not close my mind on the Vallee-Hynek rationale. I, too, wonder about some of the alien \"high strangeness\" actions, but I can just as easily attribute these anomalies to an extraterrestrial control system, or the ability of the alien mind to overpower its human counterpart for whatever purpose. Whenever I think of the options, the pros and cons of origin, I always think of Hynek. What did he really think? MY HYNEK CONNECTION"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Championing the UFO cause, after overcoming his \"swamp gas\" stigma while a consultant with the U. S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, Hynek set up the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) in Evanston, Illinois. After the great 1973 flap, when I still had access to many significant UFO happenings, I had reason to call Hynek on many occasions to share or exchange information. We met for the first time in Columbus, Ohio, in 1974, at the Marriott Hotel. In his gracious way, he extended a welcome to assist him with his new project and in more confidential tones, he told me that he still had contacts at Wright-Patterson AFB where he visited periodically. he gave no details. I explained again that I had good contacts nationally by Wats line and if any news of importance came my way that I would keep him informed. We departed mutually satisfied that we would be working together instead of at opposite poles. Notably, when I began my research into UFO crash/retrievals in 1976, Hynek showed a keen interest. I called him when a new firsthand source surfaced and he often would call back to check on my progress. I never gave names on the phone or in writing, and this I felt had become an irritant to him. On July 29, 1978, I was a guest speaker at the MUFON 9th Annual Symposium in Dayton, Ohio. For the record, other speakers were Ted Bloecher, Richard Hall, Major Donald Keyhoe and J. Allen Hynek, Ph.D. My subject of my own choosing was UFO crashes and recoveries. Its title was Retrievals of the Third Kind: A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody. Nobody knew what kind of material I had in my lengthy report and I could feel the tension as the media pressed in for quick on-the-spot interviews looking for a scoop. Also, I was ill at ease when it became obvious that I was being watched by \"company-type\" people in the lobby, on elevators and in the men's rooms. I thought I knew why. Unknown to anyone at the conference, except one person who claimed he was an intermediary for a CIA person (not present) - who the day before had advised me that if I had any information relative to a UFO crash in Mexico and a vague reference to an event in West Germany in my paper - that I had better delete them. He also advised me not to make any disclosures on UFO technology and that Russian agents might be present. He also warned me that there could be trouble. Chilling notions twirled in my head as I strode up to the podium. Turning once to look back, I caught a glimpse of my wife, Dell, and my son-in-law tom Stegmaier, sitting midway in the auditorium seats. And I saw Major Keyhoe give me a V for Victory sign (with his fingers). Dr. Hynek was slated to deliver his paper entitled, UFOs As A Space-Time Singularity in the late afternoon. He was in St. Louis, I had learned the night before, and would fly in on time to meet his schedule. But to my surprise, he had changed his schedule: he was sitting five rows back from the stage when I commenced talking. It was mid-morning and my presentation, which included a tape from a crash witness and a guest appearance by Robert Barry, went on for more than three hours. Fatigued, I was lifted by loud applause. Then, suddenly, there was a commotion beneath the stage. Men, bearing arms and barking orders into walkie-talkies, pushed away people trying to file up the stairway to see me. Others still seated or standing in the front rows, looked stunned. For sure, there was an emergency. I thought, maybe a fire. Then, two armed plainclothesmen leaped up onto the stage and whisked me away from the lectern and out through a rear door. \"Your life's been threatened,\" shouted one who promptly identified himself as a Dayton police officer. In the quiet of a corridor that led us to an exit,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"he explained that the police had received word of two threats - one made by phone during the night and another in the lobby just before I went on stage. As I was led through an outside garden path to the Stouffer Hotel, where I had lodging, other plainclothesmen joined in the escort. Identifications, inside large black wallets, were shown to me, but I gave them only a cursory glance. My mind was elsewhere. Continued in Part 2.
