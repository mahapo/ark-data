Earthfiles.com welcomes other eyewitness reports of unidentified sphere or cylinder aerial objects: \"We have never seen cylindrical objects. But it was in either August of '98 or '99 when my wife and I saw two black objects, looking like flying bowling balls but of an unknown size, flying silently from West to East over Broomfield, CO. A severe weather watch was out, and I was watching a tornado \"wannabe\" black cloud hanging quite low to the SE of our house where I was standing at the bend of our front sidewalk. I happened to glance to my left when the first black globe appeared from behind the pine tree of the neighbor across the street. I watched in amazement and yelled to my wife after I got over my initial astonishment. By the time she got outside, the ball had passed behind the sagging cloud of the tornado \"wannabe\" and then the ball was but a black speck in the sky to the East. She returned to the kitchen and about perhaps 15 to 20 minutes later, I saw another emerge from behind the pine tree and follow the exact same path. This time, my wife made it outside to see it for herself and watched in amazement as it also disappeared to the East.

I checked with the nearby airport control tower and they told me they never sa w or noted anything on the radar.

The objects were absolutely silent and on a determined path. Have never seen anything (like it) before or after since. Richard Becker Broomfield, CO 80020\" September 20, 2003 Hugo, Oklahoma - For at least fifty years, law enforcement, pilots, scientists and other credible eyewitnesses have described, sketched, photographed and videotaped a bewildering variety of shapes and sizes in unidentified aerial craft th at are completely silent. See: More Information at the end of this report. This past week on Tuesday, September 16, two employees of the Choctaw County, Oklahoma Sheriff's Department in Hugo, Oklahoma - northeast of Dallas, Texas, near the border - watched three objects in broad daylight which have left them both shocked and wanting to know where the craft came from and what were they doing flying over their small town of about 6,000 people? Larry Taylor is Deputy Sheriff at the Choctaw, Oklahoma Sheriff's Department and has been in law enforcement for thirty years. His wife, Darnette, is the dispatcher at the Choctaw Sheriff's Department. On Tuesday at 3 p.m., the couple were driving from downtown Hugo after lunch on a clear, sunny afternoon, when both were stunned to see what was in the sky.

Larry Taylor, 56, Deputy Sheriff, Choctaw County, Oklahoma Sheriff's Department, and his wife, Darnette, who is Dispatcher in the Choctaw Sheriff's Department, Hugo, Oklahoma: \"As we were leaving town and this was approximately a few minutes before 3 p.m. - leaving Hugo enroute back to our residence which is about 5 miles west we were still in town and my wife looked through the windshield and observed something up in the sky and said, 'What is that?' pointing upwards. I looked through the windshield and this was a very clear, sunny day. There was just a small amount of clouds and a slight br eeze from the north kind of a cool day. I observed a silver, round ball-like object high in the sky. I assumed this was about 5,000 feet up in the sky to th e west. This was a silver object like a round ball and very luminous and shiny silver colored."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Large, silver, luminous sphere that Choctaw County Deputy Sheriff Larry Taylor and Choctaw Sheriff's Dispatcher, Darnette Taylor, watched hovering silently high in the western sky aboveHugo, Oklahoma, for several minutes on September 16, 2003, until it changed colorto grey and disappeared. Drawing © 2003 by Darnette Taylor. We watched this for three or four minutes as I was driving west out of town. We got out of town and observed this same object turn to what I would call a dull grey color and then simply disappeared. At this point I had turned south on anot her road, a country road, and had started towards our house and my wife was sitting in the passenger seat. She pointed out her passenger door window and said, 'L ook at that!' I tried to look. I saw something above the trees, but I couldn't see good, so I stopped my car completely in the middle of the road a nd got out of my car. My wife stayed in the car. She was shocked and didn't get out. But I walked behind the car and looked over the trees and there were tw o what I would call cylinder-like objects, which was no more than 600 to 800 feet in the air, just to our west, and they were silently proceeding in a southwesterly direction. They were above the trees and I watched them maybe two minutes until they were out of sight. They were not going very fast. They were just gliding and there was absolutely no sound whatsoever. Two, large, tan-colored, cylinder-shaped aerial objects about 600-800 feet altitude drifting together slowly and silently in a southwesterly direction a few minutes after the silver sphere disappeared. Drawing © 2003 by Darnette Taylor. These objects I would describe as cylinder -like. One was a little bit in front of the other one and also probably either a light tan or very light brown in color. I did not distinguish any changes in color on these two objects. They stayed about"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the same color and drifted off to the southwest and because of the terrain, I could not see them anymore. WAS THERE ANYTHING IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT COULD GIVE YOU ANY SENSE OF SIZE, BOTH IN THE SPHERE AND THE TWO CYLINDERS? The silver orb, or ball, as I call it, it was huge. Because of the height and size of it and how high it was, it almost looked like a small moon. But I'm sure it was a lot closer. The cylinders themselves, I've flown in a 757, which is bigger than a 747. And each one of these seemed to me to be bigger than a 757 jet. SO, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REALLY LARGE. Very large. Very large. Darnette Taylor, Dispatcher, Choctaw, Oklahoma Sheriff's Department: \" DID YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND WHO IS A DEPUTY SHERIFF DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY THAT WHATEVER YOU WERE SEEING MIGHT NOT BE FROM THIS PLANET? We were in shock and we talked about it several times. It was really strange. All the objects were strange, unique. AND NO SOUND FROM ANY OF THE THREE? No, no, not that I could hear. They had to be really big, but they were close to the treetops and stayed real close to the treetops. WHICH SUGGESTS THEY WERE TRYING TO AVOID BEING PICKED UP ON RADAR? I would think so, because it's different to see you see planes, but these were not planes. There were no wings. Different. Just like the drawing. What I saw is what I drew.\" Dep. Larry Taylor: One of them (cylinders) nearest me, it had something on the side, but I cannot remember what it was, but the best I can remember, it resembled you know how these there used to be a show on television that had a drawing of Infinity, like a stretched out 8. It seemed like it resembled that sideways, not up and down, but sideways. LIKE AN INFINITY SYMBOL. Ye s . AND IF IT WERE MADE IN SOME ENGINEERING PLACE ON EARTH, WHERE DO YOU THINK THOSE AE RIAL CRAFT WOULD BE MADE? I find it hard to believe that they woul d have completely silent craft this size, our government would, that would be so silent. AND SO BIG."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yeah, and so big. I mean, that's incredible. And how is it tied into a large, round orb, object like we saw. It shocked me that I would see two at the same time. I saw one object. And then just a minute or two later, I see two more objects and of different configurations. Those cylinders could have fitted in it. It was that big But I don't know how to compute the size. It was very big, I'll put it that way. It reminded me of what the moon looks like in the sky. But this wa s broad daylight and it was not a moon, that's for sure. AND IT WAS SILVER. It was very silver. It was shimmering a nd shiny, silver colored until all of a sudden it went to a dull grey and then PO P! it was gone. And we couldn't see it. And if it was our government, I can't see th em flying it in broad daylight if they want to keep it secret. RIGHT. AND WHAT THE HECK ARE THEY USED FOR? Now, that I would have no idea.\" Deputy Taylor said he thought the two cylinder-shaped aerial objects could fit inside the huge, silver sphere. The size of the cylinder objects might have been known by the U. S. government as far back as the early 1950s. In the April 1954-dated \"Majestic-12 Group Special Operations Manual SOM1-01\" that was mysteriously distributed to some of us in the 1990s. The manual is subtitled: \"Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery and Disposal\" and further labeled \"TOP SECRET/MAJIC EYES ONLY.\" Alleged U. S. government training manual dated April 1954"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"concerning \"Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery and Disposal TOP SECRET/MAJIC EYES ONLY.\" Clean copy above reconstructed by Bob and Ryan Wood in their Majestic-12 Documents research. There is a section called, 'Description of Craft' and one of the extraterrestrial craft shapes is labeled: 'Fuselage or cigar shape,' which is identified in the training manual this way: \"Documented reports of this type of craft are extremely rare. Air Force radar reports indicate they are approximately 2 thousand feet long and 95 feet thick, and apparently they do not operate in the lower atmosphere. Very little information is available on the performance of these craft, but radar reports have indicated speeds in excess of 7,000 miles per hour. They do not appear to engage in the violent and erratic maneuvers associated with the smaller types of craft.\" There is no specific description in the SOM1-01 manual about perfectly round, gigantic silver spheres large enough to hold two of the cylinder-shaped aerial craft.
