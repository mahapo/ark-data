Over the past decade, she has buried bottles of water in crop formations, had seeds analyzed and collaborated with scientists to study changes in brain and hormonal activity of test subjects. With her 2003 data now summarized, Lucy Pringle described for me some of the measured, but unexplained, biochemical effects. Interview: Lucy Pringle, Photographer, Crop Formation Researcher and Author of 2004 book Crop Circles, Petersfield, Hampshire, England: \" My area of research is investigating of electromagnetic fields on living systems. What happens to you and me and our animals when we go into genuine crop circles. To this end, I work with scientists who do various areas of research one of which is measuring the hormone levels in humans. Always we do control samples and then do tests inside and outside certain formations and compare the results. Last year, we went into a formation that appeared on July 13, 2003, at Avebury Trusloe a circle with scimitars around the edge. There was a 5-pointed star in the middle. Five-fold geometry reported in wheat on July 13, 2003, at Avebury Trusloe, Wiltshire, near the ancient village of Avebury.

The first time I did not feel very well in the center. The second time I was taking in a group of visitors and I told them that if they did not feel well in any formation to leave. Well, I got to the center and I was the one who had to go. I felt violently nauseous and had to leave quickly which kind of proved my point. This was the only 2003 formation that I felt was new enough to warrant the scientific tests. So, I decided not to put any people in the center, but to do the tests on the outside around it. The woman, Ann Smithells, who was doing the hormone tests, she had never been in a formation before. We had done the control tests in a barn outside at Beckhampton where David Hughes very kindly loaned us his barn. We went in and after a few tests, she said to Christopher Weeks, a researcher, 'I don't think, judging by the results of these hormone levels, that we should be in this circle at all. I always thought circles were beneficial.' The results were really quite remarkable. There was a dramatic drop in the thyroid levels in everybody some more dramatic than others. Ann Smithells was explaining to me that where our adrenals they react very quickly because they are our fight and flight mechanism. But the thyroid gland reacts very slowly. In fact, Ann said if she tested someone today, three months later she would not expect to find a change in their thyroid levels. In one case, I think it was one of my 'guinea pigs,' there was as much as a 40% drop in their thyroid level in a time space between 2 to 2.5 hours. That was pretty dramatic. The pancreas beta cells secrete to principally the liver where it stimulates the conversion of glycogen into glucose and that was increased. Endocrine System Endocrine System includes pituitary gland in head, thyroid and parathyroid glands in neck, adrenal glands and pancreas in abdomen. Testes and ovaries are also part of the endocrine system. Graphic © 2004 by BodyTeen.com. DO ANY OF THE MEDICAL PEOPLE HAVE AN EXPLANATION FOR WHY THERE SHOULD BE SUCH A DRAMATIC CHANGE IN THE THYROID? No. This is the interesting thing because we know that the circlemakers are dealing with subtle energies. I think the general acceptance in the scientific world is that there is an awful lot that we don't understand about subtle energies. This is where there is a lot of ongoing research, especially in Russia, to try and gain a clearer understanding about how subtle energies affect people. Pineal Gland Also, in our tests, the melatonin increased. That's located in one's pineal gland. Brain Activity Tests"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Also, Isabel Maxwell-Cade and Peter Staples were doing brain activity tests. They found quite interesting results, too. There was some alpha blocking. The alpha is really the bridge between the conscious and the subconscious. You have the beta, alpha, theta and delta the four levels of brain activity. The alpha blocking was quite obvious. This was another unusual effect. I said afterwards that I felt quite badly that I had put them into that formation, but everybody said it was a very good test because it has shown before that some formations are not exactly negative, but the residual energies somehow don't react well with some individual human energies. But in saying that, I don't mean they are malevolent in any way. It's just the energies don't interact in a way that our metabolism can accept sometimes. Hot Feet in Crop Circles? There was another interesting result that I haven't had before. There were two people with me on a cloudy day and as we were walking toward the formation. One of them said to me, 'I have to stop and tell you,' he said, 'I feel absolutely wonderful! I've got the most amazing feeling of well being. I can't even describe it. It's the most beautiful feeling I've ever had in my life! But,' he said, 'the soles of my feet are burning hot.' He had had a problem with a strained muscle in his groin and it cleared up straightaway after that. Then we went into another formation. I always tell people, 'You must never walk against the flow of the crop because in a way you are walking against the flow of the energies.' Well, Dan was so excited that he set off all by himself, he walked against the flow of the crop and the pain in his groin came back. But I got another report from someone who had been in a crop formation on a cloudy day who had burning on the soles of her feet! WHICH IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH THE IDEA THAT MAYBE THERE IS A RESIDUAL ENERGY FROM WHATEVER THE PLASMA VORTICES ARE THAT MIGHT CONTAIN MICROWAVE ENERGY THAT INTERACTS WITH THE PLANTS. Absolutely! This is correct, Linda, because the residual energies are in the soil and the plants. In fact, this is the latent energy which is creating all the affects we are measuring. I was talking with a friend of mine who is a surgeon and she said that subtle energies often kick start the hypothalamus. This is important it's part of the fore-brain. It plays a major part in regulating the body's temperature, body weight, appetite, sexual behavior and so on. Some people even say it is the physical place of the emotions. She feels that these subtle energies might have in some way kick started this man's hypothalamus and the nerves running down his legs were stimulated because of the injury in his groin.\" Machines Are Affected by Crop Formations Page 18, Crop Circles © 2004 by Lucy Pringle: \"Crop circles appear to affect machines as well as people. Mobile phones that operate normally elsewhere fail inside the crop formation then work perfectly when outside again! Rolls of film in cameras whiz forwards or backwards; camcorders suddenly stop working; credit cards are wiped clean; wristwatches lose or gain time or the hands spin round! On several occasions, television crews filming formations have experienced technical failures they never encountered before, despite all the back-up precautions that professionals make. Batteries are especially vulnerable and tend to drain on entering some formations. \"Within crop circles, 'hot spots' of energy can occur where mechanical failures are particularly likely. One of the most expensive episodes involved Dr. Roger Taylor, a research immunologist, when using electronic equipment to measure changes in body vitality inside the 'Druid's Knot' formation at Alton Priors, Wiltshire, in July 2002. Despite the author's (Lucy Pringle) warning, he placed himself and his equipment in a 'hot spot' where several TV cameras had failed previously. He hoped he would get significant results, and did!"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"South Field near Alton Priors, Wiltshire, in wheat reported on July 22, 2004. From Crop Circles , aerial photograph © 2002 by Lucy Pringle. \"Because of previous electrical failures, Dr. Taylor was anxious about the safety of his laptop computer while inside the formation and wanted to monitor a separate battery to see if any change occurred. To this end, a chartered electrical engineer adapted a hand-held computer to record at 15-second intervals. All was quiet until around 16:20 hours when a significant voltage spike occurred, lasting approximately six minutes. \" Later, Dr. Taylor's laptop computer was seriously damaged and the implication was that the unexplained voltage spike might have been responsible.

Energy Impact on Seeds There is another very interesting result - I know I spoke to you about the Ogbourne St. George formation, which was to my mind the pearl of last year's (2003) formations. I took seeds from that formation and also buried bottles of water. The seeds were sent up to a firm called Pelican. They are agriculture analyzers and using near infrared spectroscopy they test for protein content and moisture content in grain. A lot of people in Australia use this method. The higher the protein content, the greater price they can demand from the grain merchants. Seeds from the Ogbourne St. George formation the results were fascinating. We just did three. These were tested blind. We did a control sample. We did the center and we did the perimeter. Now, Christopher Weeks and I were both of the opinion or gut feeling that the perimeter really that the major energy was at the perimeter of this formation. What was interesting was that the protein is created on a dry basis using a factor of nitrogen of 5.7. The control sample protein was 12.05. The center was 17.48. The perimeter was 18.15 That is a 50% increase in protein over the control sample. THAT IS BEYOND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT? Yes. When we did it the year before, the scientist said even 10% was beyond the normal range. DOES JIM LYONS THINK THAT THE IMPLICATION IN THE SEEDS IS THAT THE ENERGY INTERACTING WITH CROPS TO MAKE FORMATIONS IS ACCELERATING GROWTH OR AFFECTING THE GROWTH OF THE PLANTS? I don't know if he can say that, but we can certainly say that the protein content is higher than the control samples. IN TERMS OF BIOPHYSICIST W. C. LEVENGOOD'S WORK FINDING ACCELERATED GROWTH IN SEEDS THAT ARE UP TO 45 TO 75% ACCELERATED GROWTH COMPARED WITH NORMAL PLANTS, WOULD YOU TRY TO PLANT"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"SOME OF THE 2003 AVEBURY TRUSLOE SEEDS AND SEE IF YOU CAN GET THAT SAME ACCELERATED GROWTH? I'm sure we would find the same growth because everyone who has tried it has found this as a consistent result, haven't they? YES. Buried Bottles of Water I also buried bottles of water which I have been burying in crop formations now for 14 years and these are sent up to another laboratory, again in York. Jim Lyons organized all this for me. For the first time, we are trying to do a more complete chemical analysis, but unfortunately 25 milliliters was not enough. So we weren't able to do the entire spectrum. This year in 2004, I'm going to be burying bottles of 100 milliliters. But in 2003 we were able to do the PH, the electrical conductivity, ammonia bicarbonate and then Jim did the dowsing at the end. What was most extraordinary is that the bicarbonate has gone up. The control sample was 24, the one from the center was 24, but the one from the perimeter was 110. DOES ANYONE HAVE A HYPOTHESIS ABOUT WHY THE PERIMETER WOULD BE MORE AFFECTED? No, we don't understand. But I have to stress with this that it's the first time we've done the chemical analysis so we don't have a yard stick by which to compare these results with previous formations. We've got to repeat them. Summer 2004 EVERYONE WONDERS IF THE MADNESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST WILL SOME HOW MANIFEST ITSELF IN CROP FORMATION PATTERNS THIS YEAR? I think there was a deep seated unrest in the crop circle season last year people did not know why, but they just felt that something strange was going on. I think it was a reflection of world events what was happening in the Middle East, Iraq and in a way, the people who could recognize this were very sensitive. They were tapping into a larger picture, sort of universal consciousness that the crop circles were picking up on this the energy or the intelligence behind these formations last year seemed to reflect what was happening in the world. WHICH IS WHY EVERYONE WONDERS WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE SUMMER OF 2004? I just hope it's going to be a cleansing year for everyone and the whole world.\" Click here for more information about Crop Circles, The Pitkin Guide © 2004 by Lucy Pringle.
