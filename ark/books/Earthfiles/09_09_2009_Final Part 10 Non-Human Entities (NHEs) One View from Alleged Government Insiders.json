One was a psychologist who studied ancient sigils, symbols and the “alien writings” shared by so many people in the human abduction syndrome. He sent back a copy of an English translation by famous British archaeologist, Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, of The Bandlet of Righteousness, An Ethiopian Book of the Dead. Budge showed the evolution from talismanic drawings of humanoid eyes in a face to a geometric pattern of the eyes to the spaces in the geometry forming a religious Maltese cross that becomes a repeating flower petal pattern that becomes a plain 4-fold geometry that is repeated in linking decorative patterns reminiscent of the very ancient Flower of Life symbol. The psychologist wanted me to consider the many layers of hidden meanings in religious symbols through the centuries that might relate to deceptions in the battles between forces of light and darkness. E nglish translation of Ge'ez script by famous British archaeologist, Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, of The Bandlet of Righteousness, An Ethiopian Book of the Dead. The text functions as a passport to heaven and has been customarily buried with the bodies of deceased Christians in Ethiopia. It is apparently comparable to the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and its use in Ethiopia might have derived from ancient Egypt. The HMML manuscript text contains the basic legend as revealed by Christ, the prayer for the pain of death, the secret names of Christ, and prayers for the journey to heaven.

Other comments came from a Florida resident who has studied the UFO phenomena for most of her life. Her letter dated August 20, 1994, begins with her reaction to the content in the Writers two letters. “While I can agree a great deal with the idea that the phenomena is not exactly an ‘extraterrestrial’ source that stands behind the entire Ufological scenario, but something a lot less close to us in nature, I do think that there is also a very human factor of manipulation as Jacques Vallee concluded in his Messengers of Deception © 1979 . There is after all an incredible technology out there, psychotronic and holographic devices, among others. Somehow it is very difficult for me to accept the ‘Grey abduction scenario’ in the way it is exposed to us by the ‘victims.’ This is a very familiar interaction under a different disguise: All through known history and myth and folklore, we keep reading about women and men reporting sex with alien entities (whether they called them gods, incubus/sucubi, demons, angels, fairy folk, the devil). The result is the same: there were humans reporting alien entities seducing or raping them in their rooms or outside; having their children like in the changeling folklore with the fairies coming back to take their babies or exchanging theirs for the human one. Even today in far away rural areas, you have these reports from country people of an ‘invisible being getting into their beds and having sex with them.’ I just heard one of these stories happening in Ecuador. It's common place in certain unpopulated areas! You also have the reports of strange markings left by the entities, especially through the Inquisition records of the witches declarations. We even have paintings from the Middle Ages showing the demons pushing ‘spears’ through the navels of their victims like the needle-like device the Greys use to ‘examine their abductees’!?! Everything sounds so familiar that nobody can convince me that whatever is happening now has not been happening for centuries and even millennia! So real was this in the Middle Ages that the Christian priesthood had entire councils to decide if angels and demons had sexual organs and whether their nature could allow them to have sperm and to be capable of reproducing with humans. Could there be a baby as a result of carnal intercourse between two apparently totally different species? the church council asked themselves. Weren't the angels/demons made of an extremely subtle substance that would not allow them to deal with material bodies? I can see why the Writers referenced you to Vallee's Passport to Magonia © 1969 and the other titles. As soon as I saw the list, I researched in our Dictionary of Gods and Goddesses and Dictionary of Angels bibliographies and I can confirm for you that the titles exist: Angels and Demons According to Lactantius was published in 1944 by the Catholic University of America Press, Washington, D. C., by Emil Schnewis. The Devils and Evil Spirits by Reginald Campbell Thompson, 1903/04, probably London. Essentials of Demonology by Edward Langton was 1949 in London. The only one I couldn't find was the 1601 book, probably because it is too old, but I'm sure it exists and probably Jacques Vallee knows about it or even has it. Other points that I want to make briefly are: 1) I perceive also Rudolf Steiner's ideas in the Writers. I question the authority"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"of ‘orthodox Christian thought’ as a source of unique truth (after all from its beginnings it has been a mixture of several other religions and currents of thoughts such as Egyptian, Persian, Gnostic/Manichean and pagan, too). 2) The ‘Gods’ of a particular civilization/culture/religion becomes the ‘false Gods’ or demons of the next civilization. This is also related to WHO the ‘bringers of all good things to humanity’ really are. The first question I would ask of the Writers would be: If we are dealing with a non-human, other- dimensional intelligence, how come the Writers know about them and about their intentions? 3) I think the Jungian thought is relevant in this scenario. I once heard an interesting theory about a war that's going on between old Archetypes from the Collective Unconscious. I have come to understand that ‘archetypes’ are like an image that the people keep feeding until the thought form becomes real, more or less like the Tibetan Tulpas. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - In mysticism, a tulpa is the concept of a being or object which is created through sheer will power alone. It is a materialized thought that has taken physical form and is usually regarded as synonymous to a thought form.] 4) The idea that because we're living the end of a millennium and there is so much pressure in our psyches for the impending destruction of our ecosystem and the feeling of impending doom, the abduction scenario could either come from our own inner worlds (spiritual), and the Greys represent our egos or ‘demons.’ The whole thing could mean how we are being forced to look and search inside ourselves for the ultimate answer to everything that is happening. My Mexican friend, C. O., used to say that the UFO experience was our ‘entrance’ or initiation into the Magical World. It is a way to wake us up into the idea that there is something beyond the material world, there is something beyond those that are still sleep walking through life. 5) What happened with the so-called ‘Shaver Mystery’reported by Palmer should teach us a lesson. A mazing Stories, June 1947, Volume 21, Number 6, by Ziff-Davis Publishing Company. Cover art by Robert Gibson Jones. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - During 1943, Richard Sharpe Shaver wrote a letter to Amazing Stories magazine. He claimed to have discovered an ancient language he called “Mantong,” a sort of Proto-World"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"language which was the source of all Earthly language. In Mantong, each sound had a hidden meaning, and by applying this formula to any word in any language, one could decode a secret meaning to any word, name or phrase. Editor/publisher Ray Palmer applied the Mantong formula to several words, and said he realized Shaver was on to something. Ray Palmer wrote to Shaver and asked how Shaver had learned of Mantong. Shaver responded with an approximately 10,000 word document entitled “A Warning to Future Man.” Shaver wrote of extremely advanced pre-historic races who had built cavern cities inside Earth before abandoning Earth for another planet due to damaging radiation from the Sun. Those ancients also abandoned some of their own offspring here, a minority of whom remained noble and human “Teros,” while most degenerated over time into a population of mentally impaired sadists known as “Deros” - short for “detrimental robots.” These Deros still lived in the cave cities, according to Shaver, kidnapping surface-dwelling people by the thousands for meat or torture. With sophisticated “ray” machinery that the great ancient races had left behind, they spied on people and projected tormenting thoughts and voices into our minds (reminiscent of schizophrenia's “influencing machines.”) Though generally confined to their caves, Shaver claimed that the Deros sometimes traveled by spaceships or rockets and had dealings with equally evil extraterrestrial beings. Shaver claimed first-hand knowledge of the Deros and their caves, insisting he had been their prisoner for several years.] In this country, and probably in our planet in general, there are always people avid to be the actors of whatever bizarre scenario might show up. Do we believe today that there exist Deros and Teros underground hurting us with their deadly rays? I doubt it. But when Shaver published his account, Palmer received thousands of letters from people who allegedly were suffering the very same attacks reported by Shaver. That should make us think. Another phenomenon that the police know very well occurs when a horrible crime has been committed and the police receive dozens of calls from people declaring to be the perpetrators. What is that telling us? It is very difficult to know if the persons who sent you those papers are for real and are sincere. This field is too full of weirdoes and also of cruel jokers who want to have a little fun. The idea of psychological warfare (John Keel) and diversion is not new, but we do need to know WHO is behind it. Or is the Earth's subconscious mind trying to tell us something because it's being so badly hurt by us humans? I know you are taking your chances in trying to follow up on this, but I don't think you can avoid if it there is the minimal possibility that the whole thing is real.” Another colleague sent me an excerpt from a book by William Irwin Thompson entitled Evil and World Order © 1976. Thompson was born in 1938 and is known primarily as a social philosopher and cultural critic. Thompson founded the Lindisfarne Association in an attempt to help humanity avoid a potential dark age. Lindisfarne takes its name from a Viking-threatened Irish monastery which kept writing and knowledge of the classics alive during the European dark ages. More recently, William Thompson has expressed doubt that a dark age for humans has been avoided. “We are like flies crawling across the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel: We cannot see what angels and gods lie underneath the threshold of our perceptions. We do not live in reality; we live in our paradigms, our habituated perceptions, our illusions; the illusions we share through culture we call reality, but the true historical reality of our condition is invisible to us.” "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The August 16, 1994, floppy disc was the last physical communication I had from the Writers. But I kept sending them questions and excerpts from my evolving book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness, hoping the Writers would reply. Finally in April 2001, Ray Boeche received a message from the Writers for me: “It is too dangerous for Linda and us to have any further contacts.” R eturn to Updated Part 1 F or further reports about non-human entities, please see reports in the 1999 - 2009 Earthfiles Archive (partial list below) and my books An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities in the Earthfiles Shop. • 08/31/2009 — Part 9: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged Government Insiders • 08/23/2009 — Part 8: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged Government Insiders • 08/14/2009 — Part 7: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged Government Insiders • 07/20/2009 — Part 6: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged Government Insiders • 07/19/2009 — Part 2: 1980 RAF Bentwaters Lights and Craft Were “Extraterrestrial In Origin” • 07/17/2009 — Part 1: 1980 RAF Bentwaters Lights and Craft Were “Extraterrestrial In Origin” • 07/14/2009 — Part 5: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged Government Insiders • 07/06/2009 — Part 4: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): • 06/25/2009 — Part 3: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged Government Insiders • 06/21/2009 — Part 2: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged Government Insiders • 06/17/2009 — Part 1: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged Government Insiders • 06/01/2009 — Part 10: High Strangeness Files about EBENs • 05/26/2009 — Part 9: High Strangeness Files about EBENs • 05/13/2009 — Part 8: High Strangeness Files about EBENs • 05/05/2009 — Part 7: High Strangeness Files about EBENs • 04/29/2009 — Part 6: High Strangeness Files about EBENs • 04/21/2009 — Archive Reprint: Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell Says Governments Covering Up E.
