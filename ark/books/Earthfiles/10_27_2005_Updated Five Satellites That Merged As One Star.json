The physics was amazing! They stopped instantly all together and formed one point of light.\" - Eyewitness Brian Mihelic A ransas Pass at Port Aransas near Corpus Christi, Texas, is the entrance to 200 miles of white sand in the Padre Island National Seashore on Padre Island. Updated: October 27, 2005 Redding, California - Earlier this month at 100305Earthfiles , I reported about the lights that pretended to be stars before moving over Jackson, Michigan, on Labor Day weekend in 1967. Hundreds of people had reported that year and in 1966 - unidentified flying objects in the Michigan skies. For the first time in thirty-eight years, one of those eyewitnesses named John Dotson told me about the holiday night he and his father watched over four hours as \"stars\" moved around in the night sky forming geometric patterns, flying apart and forming more geometric patterns. After the Earthfiles report and our Dreamland broadcast of John Dotson's Michigan sighting, I received an e-mail from Brian Mihelic now of Redding, California. Six years ago in the summer of 1999, Brian, his wife, 16-year-old son and 11-year-old daughter lived in Texas. On a warm evening, they had all driven out to the Aransas Pass beach and gone south toward the end of Padre Island National Seashore. Brian loves to star gaze and teach his family about some of the astronomy he has learned since his childhood. He especially liked to see satellites travel overhead so he could teach his kids about the difference between airplanes and satellites. The family had driven to a dark part of the Aransas beach that was far from city lights. Brian thinks they were facing south over the Gulf of Mexico when one of them spotted a moving object high overhead in the sky. At first, Brian Mihelic thought the moving light was a satellite.

All drawings © 2005 by Brian Mihelic. Brian Mihelic, Musician with naval military training in aviation mechanics, Redding, California: \"This object seemed to come from the east and looked like a satellite. Then from the west, we saw another satellite. I said, 'Wow, this is really neat, kids! We're going to see them cross.' I'd never seen two satellites cross in orbit right above my head before. As we were watching these two objects converge, there were two more objects: one from the south and one from the north. It seemed like they were all going toward the same spot in the sky. When the four \"satellites\" got to a point where I thought they were all going to pass, they all just stopped! Like they all just met together and formed one larger spot of light in the sky. F our \"satellites\" merged into one bright, white spot at the zenith. COLOR? White. There was no form or shape to it it just looked like another star at that point. If you just looked up and saw it sitting there without them moving into that position, you would just have thought it was another star basically. So, I told everyone to keep their eyes on it because it was a really weird thing. One of the weirdest things about it was their relative velocity toward each other and they just stopped instantly. The physics was amazing! They stopped instantly all together and formed one point of light. I don't know if they were all touching, or looked like they were all together from our vantage point on Earth or whatever? But they were straight overhead, maybe a little bit south of straight overhead. Like I said, it just looked like a slightly larger star. As we were keeping our eyes on this point of light, another one came from a diagonal direction which would be the northwest and headed right for the other \"object\" (where four unidentifieds had merged together). It also linked up with them, or whatever, and just sat there."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"F ifth \"satellite\" object came in from northeast and joined the bright, white spot where the previous four \"satellites\" had converged. It didn't do anything. It did not pulse or make any kind of patterns. It just sat there like a star. We were all staring at it. No one took their eyes off it because if you did take your eyes off it, you probably would not be able to find it again because it looked just like another star. As we watched it for ten, fifteen to twenty minutes it was a long, long time our eyes were getting dry from staring at it so long. AND THERE ARE FOUR OF YOU WATCHING, RIGHT? Right, four of us. And they were asking questions: what is it? And I said, 'I don't know.' (laughs) I did not know what to tell them. They looked like satellites until they did that (converged). As we all sat and watched, they suddenly all broke apart again and traveled like in the same directions they were heading before: one north, one south, one east, one west. I don't know if it was the same object traveling north that continued on south? Or the one that came from the north turned around and went back north? We could not tell that from where we were: which object went which way. W hite spot separated again into five \"satellites,\" each moving back out in the north, south, east, w est directions from which the \"satellites\" had come together. A fifth object remained. THERE HAD BEEN A FIFTH ONE THAT JOINED THOSE FOUR. DID ONE REMAIN IN THAT POSITION? Yes, it did. The other ones took off (4) and one was still there and I told everyone to keep their eyes on that one because it was even harder to see since there was only one of them."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"It was a little bit dimmer. F ifth object remained in position after four other \"satellites\" moved away. As the other objects passed over the horizon and out of sight, the object that was remaining did like a little zigzag maneuver in the sky where if you had your arms out straight over your head, it looked like it moved about 6 inches in the sky. It zigzagged one way and then the other direction and then back again. Then it zoomed straight out, it looked like straight out into outer space. F ifth remaining \"satellite\" zigzagged in the sky before it \"zoomed straight into outer space.\" The kids, my daughter said, 'Dad, I'm scared.' And my son said, 'Dad, this is really creeping me out. Let's go.' And I have to admit that I felt like the hair stand up it was other worldly. I don't know how to explain it. I'm still not certain in my head whether it was extraterrestrials or something really advanced technology that was Earthly technology. All I saw were basically unidentified flying objects. I don't know what they are. But those this solidly made us believe in UFOs because seeing this with your own eyes, there was no mistaking it was something that was not normal. I was an aviation jet mechanic in the Navy and I've done a lot of studying on aeronautics and things like that. And I know what things (planes/satellites) can do, our technology, but this defied all the laws of physics that I know both in the way they came together and stopped instantly. There was no maneuvering or docking or anything like that as you have to deal with craft in space. They just all came together and stopped. When they broke apart, it was like someone turned a magnet on reverse and they just whew! kind of like let loose of each other and started going back the same exact speed as they had before. There was no acceleration or anything. Except that last object when it accelerated rapidly! Any Terrestrial Aerial Technology Capable of This High Altitude Stop? THE THING ABOUT THIS IS: WHEN YOU CONTEMPLATE TERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGY IN THE AIR, I WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO COME UP WITH ANY HYPOTHESIS ABOUT WHICH CURRENT TERRESTRIAL AERIAL VEHICLE IN 1999 COULD COME RAPIDLY FROM FOUR DIRECTIONS IN THE SKY LOOKING LIKE A SATELLITE AND STOP, AS YOU SAID, ALL CONVERGED TOGETHER AND STAYING THAT WAY FOR TWENTY MINUTES. Me either. (laughs) There is nothing that I know that we have that could do the things that we saw."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"If it is Earthly technology, it's something that no one has ever made public or anything like that because it did defy the laws of physics as I know them, let's put it that way. THERE WERE FIVE OBJECTS THAT CONVERGED. IT'S INTERESTING THAT FOUR CAME FROM FOUR DIRECTIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY, RAPIDLY, CONVERGING AT ONE POINT. AND THERE WAS SOME KIND OF TIME DELAY AND A FIFTH CAME. Right. It came from if the others were north, south, east and west it (5th) came from what would be the northwest, just diagonally. The others had come so geometrically straight toward each other, the other one was anomalous the way it approached the other (4) objects. YOUR TEENAGERS WERE UPSET. THEY EXPRESSED TO YOU THAT THIS WAS CREEPING THEM OUT. DID THEY ARTICULATE TO YOU WHY THEY WOULD BE AFRAID INSTEAD OF EXCITED? Well, I think it was that we were awestruck at first. This was an actual awesome sight that instilled awe in us. Until the other one did the little zipping out to outer sp ace thing, I think we were just all awestruck. I think it was at that time that the enormity of what we just saw hit us. The whole time we were watching, it was kind of really exciting But after it happened and we reflected on it for just a minute, the total strangeness of it just hit us. I know my kids, my daughter was pretty small, but she remembers it most things. My son remembers the thing zigzagging around. But I haven't really talked to them to see what they really remember about it. But I know we were all there and all saw it and there is no mistaking it. That changed our family's belief. I was always a skeptic. I wouldn't believe it (UFOs) until I saw it. And I saw it. Implication of Extraterrestrial Intelligence and Technology AS A FAMILY, DID YOU TALK ABOUT THIS TOGETHER ON THE DRIVE BACK HOME? Yeah, we did. It was really exciting, and I couldn't answer their questions because I didn't know what they were. I could have made up something just to make them feel better. But I just told them I had no idea whether it was aliens or some kind of really advanced technology that I don't know about. But it doesn't seem like it was anything that would come from the Earth that I know of, especially the one that took off to what seemed to us to be outer space. It just left! It didn't go back across the sky. It didn't go it just went straight out from where we were looking that looked like outer space. AND DID YOUR WIFE AND YOUR CHILDREN HAVE ANY REACTION TO THE IDEA THAT YOU HAD ALL SEEN SOMETHING THAT COULD BE EXTRATERRESTRIAL? As far as my wife is concerned, we discussed it and decided between ourselves that the alien phenomenon is real, basically. Although I'm not totally certain, that seems to be to me the best explanation because it seemed other worldly. WE'RE TALKING IN 2005, SIX YEARS LATER. IN YOUR OWN MIND, WHAT IS YOUR REACTION NOW TRYING TO ABSORB THE POSSIBLE IMPLICATION OF A NON-HUMAN WITH THAT KIND OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY MOVING AROUND IN EARTH'S SKIES WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION, AND GOVERNMENTS SEEMINGLY RELUCTANT TO EXPLAIN ANYTHING TO US ABOUT WHAT THEY KNOW? Well, I do believe there are aliens that have been visiting the planet for a long time and just the other day I contacted you because I heard another report on Dreamland about the man in Michigan in 1967, I believe it was. THAT'S RIGHT. He saw something similar, but I think those were geometric patterns. That made me want to e-mail you about my sighting because it seemed similar enough. And also, the 1967 one was a long time ago. The way that was so far in the past seems to reinforce the idea that it would not be terrestrial in origin. If these things have been happening for that long, I don't think we could have had that high a technology for that long and keep it secret. WHY DO YOU THINK THE GOVERNMENT WOULD REFUSE TO TELL THE PUBLIC THE TRUTH ABOUT WHAT THEY KNOW?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Well, I don't really buy the whole Brookings Institute report that everyone would go crazy or whatever. I think it's for control. I think they want to control what we know and only let out enough information as they have to because I don't think they want to say anything they don't have to any time, really. BUT WHY? WHY WOULDN'T THEY WANT THE WHOLE WORLD TO KNOW? I don't know. Either we have some kind of their technology that we're trying to keep secret. Or there is some kind of agenda that would panic the people if they actually knew what it was. High Strangeness of High Speed Convergence and Separation Was \"Creepy\" WHEN YOUR SON SAID THAT THIS WAS 'CREEPING' HIM OUT, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS EXPERIENCE WAS CREEPY? I think the high strangeness was the creepy part. It was just totally out of anything we would expect. We are all pretty intelligent people, I think, and have an open mind about stuff, and this was outside our realm of experience or even imagination that we would see anything like that. So, the whole strangeness of it made it creepy, I guess. But it's strange that they all had the same feeling. The kids both said, 'It's creeping me out, I'm scared,' and stuff like that. I wasn't really scared, but I could understand their calling it creepy. DID YOU HAVE THE PHYSICAL SENSATION OF HAVING YOUR HAIR GO UP ON THE BACK OF YOUR NECK? No, not fear. SOME PEOPLE DO, AND I'VE ALWAYS WONDERED IF IT IS AN ELECTROSTATIC EFFECT FROM BEING AROUND THIS TECHNOLOGY? I don't know. These were way up there like a satellite in orbit or something. They weren't just up in the atmosphere. They were out of the atmosphere, basically, or it seemed like they were. SO MANY PEOPLE OVER THE YEARS HAVE DESCRIBED THIS SAME KIND OF THING: THEY LOOK LIKE STARS, THEY MOVE TOGETHER, MERGE TOGETHER, FLEW APART. WHY? WHAT IS THIS ABOUT? I don't know, but I think there is Someone out there and they are probably watching us.\" I n the past two weeks, I received another e-mail asking me about so-called \"stars\" recently forming a diamond pattern in the sky. I would like to share my own eyewitness experience with \"stars\" that move - that left me also feeling that Something out there was monitoring me and knew my thoughts. It was June 1987 and I was in Peru headed for the yearly Koyllur Riti festival at 22,000 feet in the Andes Mountains. That name, Koyllur Riti, loosely translates as \"star\" and \"snow.\" The particular stars focused upon in that Incan religious festival are the Pleiades, a cluster of young blue suns which the Incas believe have long watched over and judged them with a ruling hand. The glacial snow, according to legend, is where heaven and earth meet. It melts and puts water into the ground to grow plants which feed bodies and babies, an endless cycle of transformation from life to life, mineral to earth to plant to body, sex, birth, death. Inside that sacred snow, the Apu gods reside. Climbing Koyllur Riti is a yearly ritual for several Inca tribes, actually a penance in exchange for redemption and renewal from the Apu gods while the overseeing Pleiades sink below the horizon in the June procession of the heavens. I was with half a dozen people and Inca guides and we camped the first night at 14,000 feet before changing over to horses the next day for the climb to 22,000 feet. That night, the temperature was below freezing. We had all gathered in the warm cook tent to drink cocoa tea and eat hot food. After dinner, in spite of the bitter cold, the amateur astronomer in me was drawn outdoors. No city lights, no noise, no Big Dipper, no Orion's Belt. It was an alien sky dominated by the large Southern Cross. Off to the right was a large triangle of stars. I stared at them thinking how fresh and beautiful the strange constellations were to my North American eyes. A bright light flashed from inside the triangle. Satellite? I waited for the next flash. It came below the first. Another white light flashed to the right. I realized the flashes formed the corners of a triangle that fit neatly inside the larger triangle of stars. I began yellowing to the cook tent. \"You guys, the stars are moving out here!\" People in the tent grumbled"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"that it was too cold to go outside. The flashes erupted again in a triangular sequence inside the star triangle. I wanted to run to the tent and pull people out as witnesses, but I could not take my eyes off that astonishing sky. Perhaps something up there responded to my awe. The next action began inside the Southern Cross. It was as if a large, unseen hand drew a perfectly straight and bright, white line from the Cross to exactly the mid-point of the star triangle. That long, white line stayed bright between the two star patterns for several seconds, like something you might see in a Walt Disney film. Was Something reading my mind? Had my thoughts about the beauty of the sky provoked Someone to respond? Was the white line showing me that another intelligence knew where my eyes and mind had been focused only minutes before? If so, how does it work? What technology can perceive human thoughts from high in the atmosphere? And why respond at all? Or perform the \"moving stars\" drama? I first heard about \"stars that pretend to be stars\" from a Wyoming rancher in the fall of 1979 when I was producing the investigative documentary for television that I called, A Strange Harvest. The crew and I were on a ranch in Bosler, Wyoming, where the rancher Patrick McGuire found several of his cattle dead and mutilated on a ridge above his barley fields. The night the camera crew and I arrived, Pat told us about \"stars that pretended to be stars\" until they moved. He pointed to a tomato-red glowing object rising over the ridge. Pat said, \"Watch!\" After several minutes, the glowing object that had been slowly rising, sank back down behind the ridge. Stars and planets do NOT REVERSE their positions. How much of any given night sky might have advanced craft pretending to be stars and satellites, while actually monitoring the Earth below?
