Belvoir photograph from Italy, that our CIA unit investigated, showed a saucer-shaped craft that had landed. There were two or three small, non-humans outside, like walking around.” - “S tein,” Former Army/CIA UFO Analyst R eturn to Part 1 November 5, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - After my initial phone interviews with Stern in May to early June 1998, recorded with Stern's permission, he and I decided that given the evidence that my phone was tapped by Someone, it would be better for me to travel to his home to speak in person. When I made the trip on June 29, 1998, no one knew my travel plans or location, not even my family. However, after three days of taping with Stern in much greater detail than inn the phone conversations, it was made clear that I was monitored, followed, because government agents showed face-to-face with Stern within hours of my departure, warning him “if you ever want to see your son married and have grandkids, we are here to tell you that you are never to speak to Linda Moulton Howe again.” The following transcript and other parts to unfold are highlights from those three days that totalled about sixteen hours of recorded discussions. Interview Inside Stern's Home June 29, 1998 “WHEN YOU GOT YOUR WHITE HOUSE TOP SECRET CLEARANCE AT THE REQUEST OF YOUR BOSS, ANTHONY BARDEN, DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT MONTH AND YEAR THAT WAS? Yes, that was end of June 1958. AFTER RECEIVING THE CLEARANCE, WHAT IS THE NEXT THING THAT HAPPENED? We started getting fed material from Project Blue Book, the real one, a CIA operation channeled through Langley and Ft. Belvoir, Virginia. HOW DID IT WORK? YOU ARE IN THE SOUTHEASTERN MILITARY BASE. YOU ARE TEACHING CRYPTOGRAPHY AND SIGNAL CORPS RADIO OPERATIONS. Right. WHAT DID ANTHONY BARDEN DO? HOW DID HE HANDLE HIS PARALLEL LIFE FOR THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY’S BLUE BOOK? By the middle of July 1958, I was through with my last NATO group that I taught. There were still other teachers instructing local troops, but I went on to the CIA Project Blue Book at mid-July 1958. And by mid-August 1958, my boss, Anthony Barden, and I packed up and took the trip to Area 51 in Nevada. BY THEN, YOU HAD SCREENED THE 16MM BLACK AND WHITE FILM THAT SHOWED THE AUTOPSY OF THE 6-FINGERED, 6-TOED ENTITIES? Ye s . "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Italian Photograph of Landed “Saucer” and Small, Non-Humans The very first international case that came to our desk by special classified messenger after I started with Anthony Barden's unit was a photograph of a UFO from Italy. It came to us from Ft. Belvoir, Virginia, with the analysis that the film negative was not doctored and they found no trace of double exposure of any kind and declared it authentic. The Ft. Belvoir photograph from Italy, that our CIA unit investigated, showed a saucer-shaped craft that had landed. There were two or three small, non-humans outside, like walking around. I don’t know if they were looking at the plants and soil or what. These were small aliens, probably only about three feet tall. The photo was a distance away, so you could not see any facial features on the aliens. WAS IT A COLOR PHOTO? No, it was black and white. It was a small photograph like you would take with an old-style Brownie Kodak camera. WHAT DID THE CRAFT LOOK LIKE IN THE PHOTO? It was a silver-colored disc. SHAPE? Round. It had a small raised area on top of the disc. There were a few outcroppings on the bottom. METALLIC, DO YOU MEAN? Yes, on the bottom, almost like warts on the thing hanging down from the bottom. DO YOU MEAN BALLS UNDERNEATH? Yes, three, round balls under the disc. I thought at the time they might be a device to look out from the inside, like a porthole? Or something to do with the navigation? And the uniforms the little aliens had on were light grey-colored and it looked like they had some kind of helmet device on – you couldn’t see a face, but it didn’t look like a bare head there. It was almost like they had a cloth type of helmet. WHAT WAS YOUR PERSONAL REACTION TO VIEWING THE NON-HUMANS IN THE PHOTOGRAPH? I saw these little child-sized beings outside the craft and wondered how they flew such an advanced craft! Also, based on what I was taught as a child about angels and demons, I at first wondered if the non-humans were demons. But spirit beings don’t need physical craft to move around. CIA Field Agents Investigate Italy Location Two of our CIA guys went over to Italy with just a copy of the photograph, not the original, and went to the village where the photograph had been taken and interviewed the photographer. The CIA guys were taken to the exact location where the saucer had landed and confirmed that the geographic location matched the environment in the photograph – the vegetation, trees and everything around. They also saw four indentation marks in the ground where the craft had landed. FOUR INDENTATIONS, NOT THREE? Right, four on that particular craft. There were three around inside the circle and one indentation in the middle. WERE THE THREE INDENTATIONS IN A TRIPOD PATTERN WITH THE FOURTH INDENTATION RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE? Yes. And they used plaster of Paris to make a mold of one of the holes. When the photographs the CIA agents took at the scene were returned to our southeastern military base, we had a photo lab guy with clearance to process and print the photos. Then we could all see how those photographs matched the original case photo. And we were able to look at the plaster of Paris mold."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHERE DID THAT PLASTER OF PARIS MOLD GO? That went back to Ft. Belvoir, Virginia, to the TOP SECRET files there and probably eventually ended up at CIA Langley in their vast files section that back then was at least half a block long. WONDER HOW BIG THE CIA FILES ARE TODAY? (Suitland, Maryland, is supposed to have a huge underground archive of American intelligence files as well.) Yeah! And all full of heavy shelves with file boxes on it. I was in there. That’s another story for later. WHAT DID ANTHONY BARDEN SAY TO YOU AND YOUR CIA TEAM ABOUT THE ITALIAN CASE? Anthony said, ‘As far as we can see, this is authentic.’ The team that went to Italy also recorded an interview at the original saucer location with the eyewitness couple that only spoke Italian. One of our CIA team spoke Italian and translated the interview. The couple said they saw the saucer craft come in the sky and hover closely over their house and they could hear a mild tone, like a harmonic tone. That was the only noise it made. Only when the craft was close over their house could they hear that harmonic tone. When it flew farther away, they could not hear that sound anymore. Then the saucer craft landed about half a block away in a little field next to a wooded area. The non-humans opened the hatch, got out of the craft and walked around different areas, reaching down and picking up small plants and grass, looking at them. One of the aliens broke off a limb from a pine tree and was carrying the little limb around, the couple said. Then before the non-humans went back into the craft, the beings were all looking at the limb like it was fantastic or something. I think the non-humans took the pinecones and some needles off the limb and then dropped the limb to the ground. After that, the small beings got back into the saucer craft, closed the hatch and flew off. Ft. Belvoir, Virginia Conduit for Real CIA Project Blue Book Cases WHAT WERE YOU AND YOUR CIA TEAM SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THE ITALIAN PHOTO? We were supposed to contact the nearest CIA field agent to make direct contact with the couple who were the eyewitnesses and took the photograph. In our southeastern base, we started working on the Italian case with two other civilians from the CIA, who wore civilian clothes. When I went out to Area 51, I wore civilian clothes also, not my Army uniform. And I used my phony CIA identity at Area 51. Even at the southeastern Army military base, I was asked to keep wearing my civilian clothes and phony nametag, unless I was teaching a class. For class instruction, I wore my Army uniform. WHY DID THE CIA NOT WANT YOU TO DRESS AS THE U. S. ARMY 1ST LIEUTENANT THAT YOU WERE? Because at the time, the CIA Blue Book project did not call for military ranking, only CIA people who generally came through the civilian ranks back then. There were a few who came out of the military into the CIA. But I never used my phony CIA identity in any of my teaching work. SO YOU WERE LIVING TWO LIVES IN TWO DIFFERENT ‘COSTUMES,’ SO TO SPEAK, INSIDE THE SOUTHEASTERN MILITARY BASE. Ye s . HOW EXACTLY DID YOUR CIA UNIT GET THAT ITALIAN PHOTOGRAPH? It came through Project Blue Book. Apparently, the individual in Italy heard about Blue Book and took the photo to an American embassy and someone there in turn sent it to probably the FBI and the FBI probably sent it to Project Blue Book and from there, it was sent to Ft. Belvoir, Virginia. Since it was foreign, the photograph was sent to us in the CIA Project Blue Book unit in the southeastern military base. ALL FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY MATTERS WENT THROUGH FT. BELVOIR, VIRGINA? Yes, everything that was not explainable. Project Blue Book first had a group of civilians"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"and officers who would contact eyewitnesses. When a foreign case came in, they didn’t have a way to contact international foreigners to check it out. So, such a case and paperwork would automatically go to Ft. Belvoir and on to us. If it was something that could not be debunked – real photographs like we were shown at Area 51 in August 1958, taken from jet airplanes and Super Sabres. After WWII, instead of gun turrets on them, a lot of Super Sabres had cameras. By flying to the general area where there were frequent UFO sightings, this one group of three pilots in F100s (Super Sabres), they were following half a dozen different saucer craft to get close-up photos. But when the jets got near the saucer craft, they would just dart away. At Area 51, we were told it was like entering the Indianapolis 500 (car race) with an old Model-T as far as our jets trying to keep up with the saucers. Ours could not! All of a sudden, the saucer craft would zip around and be BEHIND the jets, like playing cat and mouse games. MEANING THE SAUCERS COULD HOP BEHIND THE JETS BEFORE THE JETS COULD EVEN MANEUVER? Yes. Even now, my son-in-law recently told me about one of his military friends who once flew with a group of F100s that had cameras mounted and the jets flew right up through a group of saucer craft. The saucers veered off in all directions. The jets were trying to get close to the saucers to photograph, but the jets could not even get close. F 100 Super Sabre, first 1950s mass produced aircraft capable of routine Mach 1, plus speed in straight and level flight. Source: Jetplanes.co.uk [ Editor’ Note: F100 Super Sabres were the first mass produced aircraft capable of routine mach 1 plus speed in straight and level flight. The prototype for this century series aircraft first flew in May 1953, while the initial production example an F100a took to the sky later that year in October. Development of the aircraft was a priority at the time due to the Korean Peninsula troubles. The aircraft entered USAF service proper in September the following year. Propelling the F100 or the 'Hun' as it b ecame known was a single P&W J57 turbojet which in the version fitted to the F100d could produce 16,950lbs thrust on re-heat. This took the aircraft past the speed of sound and on to a top speed of over 840mph in the case of the F100d variant. ] DID ANTHONY BARDEN GIVE YOU ANY BACKGROUND INFORMATION ABOUT THE CIA KNOWING ABOUT OTHER SIMILAR UFO LANDINGS WHERE BEINGS COLLECTED SAMPLES? He did give us a briefing, but it was mostly about the CIA’s problem of separating real photographs from hoaxed photographs. He had some other genuine photographs of disc craft that had been taken by fighter jet cameras. Among the foreign photos he had, there were some from Mexico and Central America. Most of those were aerial photos of a saucer in the air, nothing landed. It took quite awhile to get a photograph like a landed craft with aliens outside. Small, Grey Non-Humans Linked to Incas DO YOU REMEMBER ANOTHER SUCH PHOTO? I remember one was from northern Mexico taken by a Mexican geologist who was out looking for oil and he had a camera to take photos of the terrain. He photographed a"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"saucer and our CIA group compared it to the Italian saucer. Anthony Barden said, ‘These sure don’t look the same.’ The Mexico saucer had a great big dome in the middle of it that stood up probably ten to twelve feet above the disc. That saucer craft, according to the hilly environment around it, was quite a bit larger than the craft in the Italian photograph. DID ANTHONY BARDEN HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SAUCER CRAFT? Yes. He had gone to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and then on to Ft. Belvoir, Virginia, where need-to-know people showed Anthony whatever they had so he would have a better overview. We only had the team that could go to Italy to investigate, but it was tough because those CIA people had tremendous cover in order to infiltrate governments and it was hard for us to contact them directly for discussions or to get such field CIA people to help us investigate UFO cases. 1958 CIA Had At Least Two Non-Human Categories: 6-Fingered Humanoids and “Greys” SO WHAT DID FT. BELVOIR IN 1958 TELL BARDEN ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE IN CRAFT? Just that there were different types and sizes of craft and at least two different types of aliens. One was the Roswell type, the smaller humanoid that had 6 fingers and 6 toes. The other was the large head with big eyes and pointed chin and could be three feet tall or five feet tall. WHAT DID ANTHONY BARDEN SAY ABOUT THE TALLER ONE? He said that the military referred to both sizes as ‘Greys’ because of the grey skin color. At that time, Anthony Barden asked where the Greys were from and the people at CIA in Langley, Virginia, told him they had no knowledge of actual origin. Anthony was told there were tremendous discrepancies. The Greys they had captured in crashes telepathically gave numerous different stories as to where they were from. So, the CIA did not really know where the Greys were from, but they thought it was outside our solar system. Grey Non-Humans from Aldebaran Solar System? One location the CIA wondered about was a planet described as orbiting the star Aldebaran. There were supposed to be two planets circling that star and the Greys might come from there. Aldebaran also comes up in the German Vril Society's supposed to have contact with tall, pale skinned beings from the Aldebaran system that taught the Vril Society how to build round craft that could neutralize gravity.

Source: Wikipedia. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - Aldebaran is a K5III type star, 65 light-years from Earth and is the brightest star in the constellation Taurus and is one of the brightest stars in the night sky. It's orange color means the star has exhausted its hydrogen fuel and burning primarily helium. The aging Aldebaran has expanded its diameter to about 38 times the diameter of our Sun. Aldebaran is one of the easiest stars to find if one follows the three stars in Orion's belt from left to right in the Northern Hemisphere, or right to left in the Southern Hemisphere. The first bright star found by continuing that line is Aldebaran. The name Aldebaran comes from Arabic and means, “the follower” and refers to the way Aldebaran follows the Pleiades star cluster in its nightly journey across the sky. Also, because Aldebaran is located in the bull's head of Taurus, the reddish star has historically been called the Bull's Eye. NASA's Pioneer 10 spacecraft, which flew by Jupiter in 1973, will reach and pass by Aldebaran in about two million years. Aldebaran has a dim companion M2 dwarf orbiting at several hundred astronomical units. Aldebaran is also alleged by the original German Vril Society of the 1920s to be the origin of space beings that taught the Vril Society how to build anti-gravity saucer craft. The Vril Society was the mother of the Nazi party. “Vril” in German means light force. The mystery persists about the Vril Society's origin and description of beings from Aldebaran teaching the disc technology.

DID ANTHONY BARDEN EVER MENTION ZETA RETICULII 1 AND 2? No, but he did say something about the Pleiades, a star group. It was amazing to me that the different beings, or Greys, could actually ‘speak’ English telepathically.

General Arthur Trudeau ANTHONY BARDEN WENT TO CIA HEADQUARTERS IN LANGLEY TO HAVE HIS OWN ORIENTATION ABOUT THE UFO PHENOMENON? He went to Langley first for a general meeting and I think he met Lt. General Arthur Trudeau. He was the General involved with Area 51 and technology things. General Trudeau was one of those in the meeting along with several other CIA top civilians Anthony met there. [ Editor’s Note : Lt. General Arthur G. Trudeau is linked to the Roswell, New Mexico, UFO crashes of the 1940s as described in the groundbreaking 1997 book, The Day After Roswell, by Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso who worked for General Trudeau in the Pentagon. The 1997 book by Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso (now deceased) is available at Amazon.com. Lt. Col. Corso said that General Trudeau was requested by President Dwight Eisenhower, a Trudeau colleague during WWII, to oversee a highly classified mission to distribute non-human technology gathered from crashed disks to select industries in the U.S. during the 1950s and 1960s. Lt. Col. Corso’s described his and General Trudeau’s efforts as responsible for the huge technology revolution of the 20th century. He said it was President Eisenhower’s goal to have trusted U. S. Army people get the advanced technology into American corporations for official patents in order to keep the technology out of the hands of spies that had infiltrated the CIA and other intelligence and military units. ]"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"L eft: Lt.

[ Further Editor's Note: Retired Army Lieutenant General Arthur G. Trudeau, 88, who commanded infantry units in World War II and Korea, died of heart failure June 5, 1991 at his home in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Born in Middlebury, Vermont, he graduated from West Point in 1924, and went into the Corps of Engineers. He received a Master's Degree in Civil Engineering from the University of California at Berkeley. In 1944, he was promoted to Brigadier General and in 1945 he assumed command of a secret base in the Philippines, assisting in the preparation for an invasion of Japan that never came. After the war, he served in Germany before becoming Deputy commandant of the Army War College in 1950. By 1952, he was assigned to the First Cavalry Division in Japan and commanded the 7th Infantry Division in Korea in 1953. He commanded U.S. and Korean forces in several battles, including the Battle of Pork Chop Hill. In 1954, at President Dwight D. Eisenhower's request, General Trudeau became the Chief of Army Intelligence at the Pentagon and in 1958, the Director of Army Research and Development (the period described by Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso in the 1997 book, The Day After Roswell. ) General Trudeau retired in 1962 and became President of the Gulf Research Development Company in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was later Chairman of the Board for North American Rockwell and continued as consultant for several defense contractors. He received three Distinguished Service Medals and the Bronze Star. ] WE’RE TALKING ABOUT 1958, ELEVEN YEARS AFTER THE ALLEGED ROSWELL CRASHES. ANTHONY BARDEN HAD SERVED IN THE OSS DURING WORLD WAR II AND BY 1958 WAS ADMINISTRATOR OF A CRYPTOGRAPHIC SCHOOL IN THE SOUTHEASTERN MILITARY BASE THAT COVERED UP THE TOP SECRET CIA PROJECT BLUE BOOK INVESTIGATIONS OF NON-HUMAN CRAFT AND BEINGS. CERTAINLY THE CIA WOULD HAVE BRIEFED HIM ON EVERYTHING THE CIA KNEW AT THAT TIME, RIGHT? It’s possible that Anthony Barden held some information back from us in our unit. He told us back at the southeastern military base, ‘If we get (shoot down?) enough of these craft and capture these beings and they talk to us, we’ll certainly know if there is such a thing as extraterrestrial life out there. Not long after he said that, we got the notice to go to Area 51 in mid-August 1958. He went to church every Sunday and he was raised with the idea that Earth was the only place where there was life in the universe. But when he finally interviewed the being at Area 51, he came out and said to me, ‘I think they made a believer out of me! This thing is not human, is not part of our human race and has to be from a different solar system somewhere.'"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"DID HE SAY ANYTHING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS AND THE GREY BEINGS? His general comment about that – which might have been his cover-up in the context of strict Need-To-Know security - he said all the aliens he knew about, that included the 6-fingered humanoids and the Greys that were 3 feet tall and 5 feet tall, telepathically communicated they were here to help and teach and had come in earlier centuries to the Earth. Barden said that one of the types had gone to the Inca Empire and was the one that taught the Incas how to smelt gold. WHICH ALIEN TYPE? The little 3-foot-tall Greys with the big heads, slanted large eyes and pointed chin. THE SMALLER GREYS WENT TO THE INCAS? Ye s . AND TAUGHT THE INCAS THE SMELTING OF GOLD? Ye s . WHY? I don’t know.
