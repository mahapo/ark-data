This Christmas week, astronauts were able to repair the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope with six new gyroscopes, a new computer, a new radio transmitter and more batteries. Hubble hasn't been able to work since November 13th. But now, the nine-year-old observatory should be back in service around the middle of January. NASA cut the repair trip short so the Discovery space shuttle and crew could land tomorrow, back in plenty of time before New Year's Eve and any possible Y2K computer problems. Gamma Ray Bursts NASA also had good luck this month with its gamma ray burst research. One of the most violent and mysterious events in the universe are sudden bursts of gamma radiation in the cosmos. For the first time on December 16th, instruments aboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory were able to lock onto a gamma ray burst only four hours after a powerful flash of radiation was picked up. Even the Chandra X-Ray Observatory was able to photograph the fading explosion four days after the gamma burst from an object identified as GRB 991216.

The BATSE team (Burst and Transient Source Experiment) at NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama said, \"The hunt for the December 16, 1999 gamma ray burst started with a low-intensity trigger, followed 20 seconds later by an intense blast of gamma radiation. The trigger event was a flash of radiation just powerful enough to switch on the BATSE alerting system. In about 20% of gamma bursts, a small precursor burst comes before the main event. No one yet knows why.\" Earlier this year, another huge gamma ray burst many light years away affected some of our earth-orbiting satellites. NASA says that \"one of the leading theories for the cause of gamma ray bursts is the collapse of a super-massive star\" in which jets of matter burrow out through the poles and then rip the star apart.

Exploded stars, or supernovae, are also helping scientists to understand that nearly ALL of the elements we know about - other than hydrogen and helium - were created in the interiors of stars.

The red, green and blue regions in this Chandra X-ray image of the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A show where the intensity of low, medium and high energy X-rays, respectively, is greatest. The red material on the left outer edge is enriched in iron, whereas the bright greenish white region on the lower left is enriched in silicon and sulfur. In the blue region on the right edge, low and medium energy x-rays have been filtered out by a cloud of dust and gas in the remnant.

Dr. John Hughes of Rutgers University in New Jersey has been using the Chandra X-Ray Observatory to study elements and says, \"In addition to understanding how iron and the other elements are produced in stars, we also want to learn how it gets out of stars and into the interstellar medium. This is why the study of supernovae and supernova remnants is so important. Once released from stars, newly-created elements can then participate in the formation of new stars and planets in a great cycle that has gone on numerous times already. It is remarkable to realize that our planet Earth and indeed even humanity itself is part of this vast cosmic recycling.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Image: Cassiopeia A as seen by the Chandra Observatory's Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS), 1999.

Interview: Unidentified Aerial Objects Another eyewitness report is in about a triangular or wedge-shaped object moving slowly in southern California skies. A peculiar aerial object shaped like an arrowhead with the rear curved inward was observed for nearly an hour on December 21st by Dominic Tavares, a water treatment technician, and his 11-year-old son. Below the \"arrowhead\" craft, five helicopters circled. They were traveling on the I-10 freeway just outside of Indio, California headed west towards the San Jacinto Mountains which rise above Palm Springs. Dominic Tavares, Water Treatment Technician, Bermuda Dunes, California: \"As I looked towards the mountains, I noticed a pulsating pale, light colored it was just a bright light. It struck me as unusual because I've never seen a plane pulse like that. It was a slow pulse. And my son said, 'Oh, Dad, it's probably just a star or something.' And I said, 'Well, it's too low in the sky to be a star because it's in front of the mountains.' Mount San Jacinto is a mile high. This was below the top of the mountain on the side towards you? Yes, on the west side of the mountain towards me. So, I drove forward and went ahead on I-10 and Indio from Palm Springs is approximately 25 miles east of Palm Springs. So, I caught up to this thing, whatever it was, some 25 minutes later down the freeway near Palm Springs, Calif. So, I pulled off the off ramp which would be Date Palm Drive and I got a look. We were right under it. I got a good look at it. It was shaped like a triangle. What I assumed to be the front of it was a green light. There were two more lights behind it which were a pale yellow. The middle was a pulsating yellowish light. And it had in each point of the craft, it had green it seemed to be fluorescent lights running to the middle of this pulsating light. The center of it. You mean like bands or rods of light coming from the corners to the center? Correct. My son, he was a little frightened. He said, 'Dad, I'm getting scared. I don't know what that is.' And it was there for just a few seconds, just floating and it moved to the north just a little and then you could see it in the northwest at the next city out of Palm Springs would be Cabazon and then there's Banning and Beaumont. So, I pulled over to get some gas and got back on the freeway and it was visible to me for another maybe 30 minutes until I hit Banning. And I lost it over the San Bernardino Mountains. We saw it for 45 minutes. We got a good look at it for maybe 2 or 3 minutes when we got right underneath it. And I followed it as far as I could until it was out of sight and I haven't heard anything from the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"newspaper or the news. I really don't know what it was. But I know it wasn't the stealth aircraft that we have because it was just floating there. When you were right under it, about how big was it? Oh, God. I would say it had to be a football field or two long. It was big! It was at least 3/4's of a mile up. The helicopters were well below it and this thing was quite a ways above the helicopters, but it had to be at least a football or two football fields big. The helicopters just circled below it? They were keeping their distance. There were five of them. They kept their distance. Didn't really approach it, didn't get too close to it. What did the light seem to do in relationship to the approach of the helicopters? I didn't see any change in the craft at all, in any of its lights or movement at all. How long were the helicopters circling below? Oh, gosh, it had to be for the whole duration, from the time I saw it, the point when I was in Indio until Banning and Beaumont. Other aircraft fly out of that area going to Ontario Airport. What you mean is that the helicopters were below this pulsing object for at least 45 minutes? Yes, but they were keeping their distance, though. Could you see detail on the bottom clearly? Yes. As I said before, it had a green light that appeared to be in front of it and two small tail lights at the rear of it. And these three green, I guess lines or something running to the middle of this pulsing light. And it was a triangle, but it was wedge shaped. It seemed to have concave at the rear of it. It was shaped like an arrowhead. If you were going to compare the color of the green at the front leading edge to something that we might all know, what green would you compare it to? I would say the closest thing that everybody would know is a green traffic light. But not exactly like it. A different illumination something about it was different.\" Round Silver Ball Craft and Bigfoot, December 6, 1999 Unusual objects that people see in the skies are still coming down towards the ground - like the large silver ball that Rosie Baney and her daughter saw near their North Baltimore home in northwestern Ohio at the end of September. The silver ball descended slowly between trees growing around a bean field about three-quarters of a mile from their house. Rosie Baney, North Baltimore, Ohio: \"It looked like it was real close to the top of the trees and it went down into the field. It didn't land, but it just stayed in one spot. And then it come up. And then all at once it disappeared. I don't know. How long did you and your daughter watch it? Probably about five minutes."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Was it like silver metal? Yes, it was silver. From where we saw it, it was silver.And it wasn't no airplane, no way! I mean it was round shaped, what I saw of it in the front part. I don't know what it looked like in the back part of it. It was huge what I saw and my daughter saw it, too. And this sounds really weird, too. But my husband and I was jogging one day and down that side where I saw whatever it was, across the road you're not going to believe this some great big, tall it looked like a big tall man that had hair he was taller than a man and he was walking across the road, come from the field across the road to the woods. Would he have looked like a Bigfoot with a lot of hair from head to feet? Yes, he was not white. What I saw was black. Or dark, the hair was dark. It come from the out of the field into the woods, that's all I can tell you. But it was not a person.\" In my book Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume II: High Strangeness , there is a report with drawings from a man named Steve Bismarck who lives in Snohomish, Washington. Back in the Easter weekend of 1977, Mr. Bismarck watched a dark-haired Bigfoot lowered down from a large silver disc hovering over woods near his rural home. He sketched the tall humanoid creature and wrote, \"This ape-like animal walked upright. It had extremely black hair about three inches long, or more. It had a big, cone-shaped head that extended down to a big hump on its back. Its legs were much longer than an ape's. I didn't draw them long enough. And the arms were shorter than an ape's. They seemed to swing to the extreme as it walked by.\" Drawing by Steve Bismarck for Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness Â© 1998 by Linda Moulton Howe. Another family in Elizabeth, Colorado back in the mid-1970s also associated the presence of Bigfoot in their yard with silver discs and animal mutilations on their ranch. See An Alien Harvest in the Earthfiles Shop. Many other eyewitness accounts from South Dakota, Montana, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Washington and other regions of the country have described similar hairy humanoids associated with sightings of unidentified aerial objects in the sky."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"More Information: I would appreciate information from anyone else who might have been on the I-10 freeway between 5 and 6 PM on Tuesday, December 21st and also saw the arrowhead-shaped object in the sky with the five helicopters below.
