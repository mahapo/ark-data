C. - What Caused Earthquake Storms,Global Drought and End of Bronze Age?Â© 2001 by Linda Moulton Howe The art of the Greek Mycenaens prior to the sudden and mysteriousend of the Bronze Age in 1200 B. C.December 1, 2001 New Orleans, Louisana - Recently I reported a newsupdate about the underwater megalithic structures discovered a half mile deepoff the western tip of Cuba by engineer Paulina Zelitsky and her husband PaulWeinzweig, partners in Advanced Digital Communications of Canada andHavana, experts in deep ocean exploration. Whatever the structures are down so"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"deep, Paulina Zelitsky told me that in recent months she sent a RemotelyOperated Vehicle to the site with a light and video camera. From the firstvideotape test, she described rock structures about the size and shape ofStonehenge, England. Carved in one of the rocks are a symbol of crossed ovals,hieroglyphs and lettering that looks like Greek, but is not Greek. (See: Earthfiles11/19/01).If there are carved megalithic structures, how did they get down in the ocean sodeeply? One of the many speculations is that this Cuban site might have someconnection to the story of a sunken island called Atlantis described by Plato inthe dialogues of Critias and Ti maeus. The concept of a large Atlantic Oceanisland civilization breaking up and sinking is one of the most controversiallegends of earth history. Plato described the destruction of Atlantis in this way:\"...there occurred portentous earthquakes and floods, and one grievous day andnight ... the ... island of Atlantis was swallowed by the sea and vanished.\"Did that happen 9,000 years before as Plato reported in the dialogue whichwould be 11,000 years ago? That was the end of the last Ice Age and hugeclimate changes were occurring whatever the cause. But could there have been atranslation error? Does the figure 9,000 refer to lunar cycles? If so, the timeframe might be more recent around three thousand two hundred years ago whena storm of earthquakes and severe drought destroyed at least 45 majorMediterranean and Asian cities that ended the great Bronze Age.In July 1997, astrophysicists, geologists, historians and other scientists gatheredat Cambridge University in England to talk about evidence of earth catastrophesduring the Bronze Age.First, history professor William Stiebing from the University of New Orleans hasstudied tree rings around the Mediterranean and Asia Minor and has foundevidence of severe drought that extended from that region to North America in1200 B. C.Bronze Age civilizations from Ugarit, Syria throughout the Mediterranean and Europebefore its sudden and mysterious collapse in 1200 B. C.Interviews:1) Drought Impact:William H. Stiebing, Ph.D., Seraphia D. Leyda Professor of History,University of New Orleans, New Orleans, Louisiana: \"There was a collapseof many of the cultures and civilizations. They were totally destroyed. TheHittite Empire disappeared. The Mycenaen kingdoms in Greece disappeared andthe cultures that replaced them were much poorer, usually small farmers ratherthan the large empires that existed before.There is some evidence for a lower Nile and levels of the Tigris and EuphratesRivers at that time which is where I suggest a drought. Whatever was causing it,when these population groups began moving and these empires begancollapsing, it did have a lasting effect for at least 300 to 400 years. It was a Dark"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Age that followed. Writing was lost in Greece because the Mycenaen kingdomsfor which the writing was produced for no longer existed so the writing was nolonger needed for scribes or keeping of records.WHAT CAUSED SUCH AN EXTENSIVE DROUGHT?That's a good question and we don't know. Weather patterns, a variety of thingscan cause them. Comet or meteoritic impact can be one of them.WHAT IS THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE YOU HAVE FOR A SEVEREDROUGHT IN 1200 B. C.?The low levels of the Nile and Tigris and Euphrates rivers around that time, aswell as just tree rings evidence from Asia Minor that shows around 1200 somevery narrow tree rings. Now, most, some of this, the tree rings could beinterpreted in your terms as well.IN TERMS OF COSMIC?Right, some kind of volcanic or cosmic collision that would block out sunlightfor a time and produce cold weather and make narrow tree rings. There isevidence in tree ring sequences in both the southwestern U. S. and England aswell. the Irish oak sequences in Britain and the bristle cone pine sequences inthe southwestern U. S. show very narrow rings for a time around 1200 thatsuggest there was some period of something there that was causing a change inclimate. But it doesn't necessarily indicate exactly what exactly was causing it.But it was harsher climate of the trees for that time, whether it as less rain orvery cold weather, or what. You can't determine that just from the tree ringsBUT SOMETHING THAT AFFECTED TREES GLOBALLYOCCURRED IN 1200 B. C.?Right.\"2) Earthquake StormsStanford geophysicist, Amos Nur, Ph.D., has also tried to understand whatcould have caused the simultaneous collapse of so many great cultures -including Troy, Mycinae, Agamemnon and Ugarit. He has focused his researchon earthquakes that shook the Mediterranean and Asia like a cluster of storms in1200 B. C.Amos Nur, Ph.D., Wayne Loel Professor of Earth Sciences, StanfordUniversity Department of Geophysics, Stanford, California: \"Because welook at the ruins that were left behind and the way walls have fallen andcolumns and faults. And it is so similar to the way these places have collapsedsince in large earthquakes that that's basically our evidence. And it includescrushed skeletons buried under the rubble in these collapses and that is verystrong indicator that there was a catastrophic collapse. And some of thesestructures are so huge that you couldn't possibly be manmade.WHAT MECHANISM IN YOUR RESEARCH HAVE YOU FOCUSEDON THAT WOULD CAUSE EARTHQUAKE STORMS?When I started looking at these things, I didn't even think in terms of earthquakestorms. But the storm concept is suggested since there are long periods of timewith a few earthquakes here and there. But once in awhile, a snapping in oneplace triggers the snapping in another place. So, it's not just a plate motion butsome interactions between segments of these plate boundaries and distant areaslike from say Lebanon to Sicily which is really a long distance.SOMETHING DRAMATIC DID HAPPEN FOR CERTAIN IN THEMEDITERRANEAN AND ASIA AT 1200 B. C.?Give or take, yes. I don't know if it all happened at once or scattered out over a50 year period, but definitely physical and political collapse of many of the bigcenters happened at that time. In fact, that defines the end of the Bronze Age.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Comet or Asteroid Interference?Could something like a stony asteroid or rocks from a comet have impacted theearth in 1200 B. C.? Could such rocks have hit and sunk one or more islands inthe Atlantic Ocean as described by the Greek, Solon, in Plato's Ti maeus? Iasked astronomer Bill Napier at the Armagh Observatory in Northern Irelandwho has written about cometary catastrophes, cosmic dust and ecologicaldisasters in history.Bill Napier, Ph.D., Astronomer, Armagh Observatory, Northern Ireland:\"Certainly the Solon quotation is very interesting because he does talk aboutcelestial fire coming at long intervals of time. And this is what I think we expect.Because there is the remains of a giant comet still floating around out there andevery 2,500 years or so, we run into this material. So, the earth has periods oflower risk and periods of higher risk. It doesn't seem to be randombombardments.THESE ARE CYCLES OF COMET ORBITS?Yes, we are talking about cycles here.WHICH COMET WOULD HAVE LEFT A LARGE DEBRIS FIELD 2.5THOUSAND YEARS IN CYCLES?Well, we have the remains of a comet known as Ecnencte's Comet after a 19thCentury astronomer, Ecnencte. It seems to be the remnant of a very much largerbody which might have been 100 kilometers across. And that must have given usa huge amount of dust when it was active which would be certainly over 10,000years ago, maybe 10,000 to 100,000 years ago.IT CYCLES EVERY 2.5 THOUSAND YEARS?Yes, it seems to be so. And the last time we ran through material from this cometwas around about the time of Christ or about 200 B. C. It's hard to be precise.IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE DEBRIS FIELD FROM THE COMET IN200 B. C. AND 2400 B. C. COULD HAVE HAD LARGE CHUNKS OFASTEROID AND METEORITIC MATERIAL IN IT THAT COULDHAVE BOMBARDED THE PLANET?I think very much indeed. But more to the point, I think, is that the dust thatcomes in with these intervals. We're looking for a 2.5 thousand year climaticcycle. We're looking for glaciers that come and go in 2.5 thousand year cycles.And there is evidence of this. And it's interesting that Russian astronomers havefound good evidence of climatic change with this cycle, as of others. And itmatches in period and phase of the times when we run through this cometarymaterial. So, it is interesting that this would be associated with fireballs in thesky for the most part and intense meteor storms, Leonid-like, but with the risk ofoccasional substantial impact, maybe something like 10 or 100 megatons on the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"planet.I am corresponding with an airline pilot right now who used to do a trip fromEgypt to Khartoum and he thinks he has actually flown over a meteor crater thatis 150 kilometers across.WHERE?In the Egyptian desert. He is getting out his maps now and he's going to tell memore about it. This is an exceptionally large crater and it's an important find ifit's confirmed. So, these big craters do exist and they all certainly haven't beenfound by any matter of means.HOW WOULD ASTRONOMERS TODAY IN 2001 GO ABOUTLOOKING FOR EVIDENCE OF COMETARY OR ASTEROID DEBRISAT THAT 1100-1200 B. C. TIME RANGE?What you have to do is map out the whole near earth asteroids with telescopicsearches. Such searches are underway, but so little is known about theenvironment. The trouble is that half the time you see a small body passing bythe earth, has actually passed by us by the time you discover it and you haven'tseen it coming. So, what is going on is that we are at less than a 1% discoverylevel of about 100-meter-sized bodies.What we really need to do is map out the whole environment of the innerplanetary system. And once we get a good picture built up, then we can doorbital calculations and back track the orbits and see where things were atvarious times in the past. And that way we can build up a picture and see atwhat extent we have that cometary material which is broken up to give us lots ofsmall bodies.What we have is a whole complex of debris a massive meteor stream called theTaurid meteors, that's because it comes from Taurus constellation, the meteorsseem to come from there. And embedded in this meteor stream are maybe adozen kilometer-sized asteroids all in a similar orbit with the Taurid meteors.And we also have E's comet which I mentioned as part of this complex, too. Thiswhole thing you can imagine as an elongated doughnut floating around insidethat. And spreading out from this material is a sort of disk of dust.All this has broken up from single large body and we can run things in reverseand we find we must have been dealing with quite a large body that came in. Wedon't know exactly when, but certainly more than 10,000 years ago, maybe100,000 years ago. It gave us a hierarchy of disintegrations, a lot of dust, andsmaller bodies. And this sort of precesses, wobbles like a plate and every 2.5thousand years that wobble intersects with the earth's orbit and that's when weget a maximum of the dusting of the earth.THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A MAJOR IMPACT SOMEWHEREAROUND THAT 9,000 TO 10,000 B. C. TIME PERIOD AND THENEVERY 2.5 THOUSAND YEARS SINCE, THERE HAVE BEEN, WEHAVE BEEN PASSING THROUGH DEBRIS THAT DEPENDING UPONTHE SIZE OF THE OBJECTS COULD HAVE CAUSED SOMEDAMAGE HERE AT 2.5 THOUSAND YEAR INTERVALS?Certainly so. It's a statistical thing. An impact can happen any time. But there isenhanced risk at these intervals. And one has the trends of climatic down turnsbecause you are running through a lot of material.IN 2002, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IN ANOTHER 100 OR 200 YEARS,WE SHOULD BE ENCOUNTERING AGAIN THE DEBRIS OF THOSEMAJOR COMETS?Yes, we shall begin to see a more active sky and many more shooting stars. TheTaurid meteors will become very strong as annual meteors. Yes, there is anenhanced risk of running through a cloud of material which can give us somesort of climatic effects.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"We b s it e s :http://www.knowledge.co.uk/sis/cambproc.htmhttp://www.oberlin.edu/~jlynn/courses/cla100/bronze/bronze2.htmlCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
