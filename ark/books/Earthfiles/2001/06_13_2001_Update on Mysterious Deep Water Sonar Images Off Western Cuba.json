C., whoconfirmed that the Society was aware of the deep water mystery off the westerntip of Cuba. She said NGS was communicating with Paulina Zelitsky and herhusband, Paul Weinzweig, partners in Canada's Advanced DigitalCommunications company, known as ADC. Last month, National Geographicwas trying to decide whether to help fund a dive in a remotely operated vehiclewith cameras to see what is down there. Today, I talked again with BarbaraMoffet and she confirmed that National Geographic has now made an agreementfor exclusive magazine coverage.Paulina Zelitsky is a former Russian ocean engineer who defected to Canadasome years ago and married Canadian businessman Paul Weinzweig. She hasbeen testing deep ocean equipment on a boat off the coast of Mexico since theReuters's story broke with her comments. In that May article, she said hercompany, Advanced Digital Communications, found \"a huge land plateau withclear images of what appears to be manmade large-size architectural designspartly covered by sand. From above, the shapes resemble pyramids, roads andbuildings.\" Four years ago, the couple joined other funding partners fromAustralia to create ADC in Victoria, British Columbia to work deep oceanwaters for science and underwater archaeology.Paulina Zelitsky is still testing equipment in Mexico for the ROV mission thatwill take video cameras down to the 2,200 foot deep site to see what is makingthe mysterious side scan sonar images.Recently, I was able to talk with her husband, Paul Weinzweig. At first, he did"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"not want to say anything on the record because he said that after the Reutersarticle, Cuban officials asked him to not do any more media interviews untilthere is hard photographic evidence of what's underwater. I said all I wanted onthe record for radio was a status report about what his wife, Paulina Zelitsky,had already talked about with Reuters. I also pointed out that ABC and Disneygot to use a clip from the ADC research ship to promote Disney's animatedfeature about Atlantis. Mr. Weinzweig finally agreed to say a few guardedcomments.Interview:Paul Weinzweig, Partner, Advanced Digital Communications, Victoria,British Columbia, Canada: \"We have some interesting sonar images which wegot last summer. And we are hoping to confirm speculation about these imageswith video cameras in an ROV this summer.DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT MONTH IT MIGHT BE?Sometime this summer. No, I can't say exactly.WOULD JULY ITSELF BE TOO EARLY?Don't want to say.IN TERMS OF THE PROMOTION FOR THE VOYAGE TO ATLANTISMOVIE WHICH WAS ON SUNDAY, JUNE 10, THEY DID DISCUSS ALITTLE BIT ABOUT CUBA. AND ON THE ABC STATION THEY SAID,'IT WAS MOST LIKELY THE SITE OF AN UNDERWATERCIVILIZATION SUCH AS ATLANTIS.' WHAT WAS YOURPERSPECTIVE ON WHAT ABC IS DOING WITH THE MOVIE ANDCOMMENT ON THEIR USING A CLIP OF YOURS?I haven't seen the film. I haven't seen the TV - well, there is obviously a lot ofinterest in the subject. There is a lot of interest in ancient civilizations and themysteries that surround them and in the idea of Atlantis which was supposedlyan advanced civilization which Mother Nature sent to the bottom of the ocean.And who knows, maybe Mother Nature will send a few more advancedcivilizations to the bottom of the ocean!YOU MIGHT BE IN A POSITION TO GET DOWN THERE ANDCONFIRM THE DISCOVERY OF AT LEAST SOMETHING THAT ISSTRUCTURED?That's right. Exactly.THOSE SHAPES OF THE PYRAMIDS AND RECTANGLES THATPAULINA ZELITSKY DISCUSSED WITH REUTERS, THEY MIGHTFIT WITH THE ANCIENT CULTURE ON THE YUCATAN? ORSOMETHING ELSE?Possibly. Possibly. We're not - nobody has seen these before, so it's very difficultto say what they are. But, they are interesting.IF IT DOES TURN OUT TO BE BUILDINGS OR SOMETHING MADESTRUCTURALLY, WHAT HAPPENS THEN IN TERMS OF CUBA ANDTHE LEGAL ISSUES OF UNDER OCEAN ARCHAEOLOGY?Well, I think it's in Cuban territorial waters. It belongs to Cuba if it's there. Itwould also have a status at some point as a world heritage site. Cuba is veryrespectful of these kinds of things. And there would be opportunities forscientists from around the world, I'm sure, to investigate further.WHEN YOU PUT DOWN THOSE MACHINES THAT CANVIDEOTAPE UNDERNEATH, WILL THAT THEN BE CONCLUSIVE?WE'LL KNOW THIS SUMMER?Well, scientists are always saying we need to do more research. But I think videocameras will tell us pretty conclusively whether it's some kind of weird geologyor formations from hot vents or something like that. Or whether it's manmade."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"BECAUSE IT IS SO EXTENSIVE COVERING KILOMETERS...Ye a h .DOES IT SEEM MORE LIKELY TO YOU THAT IT ISARCHAEOLOGICAL?Yeah, we think so. Yeah. We're operating on that premise, yes.THOSE PYRAMIDAL SHAPES ON THE SIDE SCAN SONAR AREPRETTY MUCH - THE SHAPES ARE PRETTY CLEAR, AREN'TTHEY?I wouldn't necessarily call them pyramids. I would just say that there aregeometries and symmetries that suggest manmade structures.THE VIDEOTAPE WILL BE CONCLUSIVE? OR THE VIDEO IMAGESWILL BE CONCLUSIVE?I think it would be for us, yes.\"What Can Sonar Images Show?What do the side scan sonar images show at 2,200 feet down off the western tipof Cuba? I have talked with a man who saw them. He is Dr. Frank Muller-Karger, Caribbean expert and Professor of Oceanography in the College ofMarine Science at the University of South Florida in St. Petersburg. He knowsPaulina Zelitsky and her husband, Paul Weinzweig and has worked with themon the study of ocean currents and plankton. That was the initial work thatPaulina Zelitsky was doing last summer when her ship's sonar showed peculiarimages covering several kilometers nearly one-half mile down on the oceanfloor.Frank Muller-Karger, Ph.D., Caribbean expert and Professor ofOceanography, College of Marine Science, University of South Florida, St.Petersburg, Florida: \"It looks very interesting and the fact that things havesuch sharp edges is very interesting, of course. And that is what is peaking somuch interest.WHAT IS UNUSUAL ABOUT SEEING SHARP IMAGES WITH USINGSONAR?Well, there is not too many sharp edges that Nature forms in such large scaleand over such a wide area. You might have a couple of rocks that may looksquare, but if you have so many square things thrown about in such a large area,it would be a very, very unique geological formation. Or it could be somemanmade type of construction. Now, that's the interesting part of it. Unless wego there and look, we won't know exactly what it is. So right now, all you cando is speculate and I would not want to just say that these are manmade objects.I have no clue what they really are.COULD YOU SEE LIETERAL PYRAMIDAL TYPE SHAPES IN THESONAR IMAGES?There are triangular type shapes and other types of geometrical forms. Butremember that sonar is just a tool and it's not a perfect tool. So what you arelooking at, if you can imagine what you would see with radar. If you havesomething that has a face that is pointing toward you, it will give you areflection. But then you have a shadow behind it. And it depends on the angleyou are looking at these shadows - they could be long or short. Shadows can beinterpreted as angular features and so you have to - it's very hard to interpretwhat is a shadow and what is not a shadow and what is a strong reflection andwhat isn't. And it's the combination of these things that looks very interesting.Yeah, you do see things that are, that have straight edges. That is the curiousthing about it. There are very few things that have straight edges that are naturalat those large scales.DID YOU TALK WITH PAULINA ZELITSKY AND PAUL WEINZWEIG"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE SHAPES ON THE SONAR IMAGESTHEY SHOWED YOU AS BEING POSSIBLY RELATED TOWHATEVER THE ANCIENT CULTURES WERE PRIOR TO THEMAYAN CIVILIZATION?It was sort of in a conversational form, not in any type of professional analysisform. We looked at the images. We were all very excited about what wasapparent there. But we're just standing in front of a picture and you know, likechildren speculating about what it might be without any clue as to what it reallyis. So, that's why they are going back there.WHAT WAS IT THAT AS YOU LOOKED AT THIS SONAR IMAGE,WHAT WAS IT THAT EXCITED YOU?When you look at sonar images, it looks sort of smooth, curved and shades -everything is sort of curvy and shades of curves. It looks smooth. So, when youlook at these, you do see things that have very strong reflections along straightedges. There are a lot of those things, like you said, over a field of severalkilometers, tens of square kilometers.THAT THESE STRAIGHT EDGES THAT ARE BOTH RECTANGULARAND SOMEWHAT PYRAMIDAL WITH STRAIGHT EDGES ARE ALLOVER THAT SEVERAL KILOMETERS AREA?Yes, but again, it could be a very unique geological formation. We just don'tknow. Until we go there and take a very close look, all it will be is speculationand I would hope that nobody - it's very romantic to think, 'Oh, a lostcivilization and ruins and all.' And we all would like to see something like that.But I don't think that it's the right thing to do without actually going there. Ithink it's great they are actually going to go there and take a closer look.Because just from a geological point of view, it would be very interesting also.\"What is side scanning sonar?It operates by sending out sonar pulses from what's called a \"fish.\" It looks sortof like a torpedo as it is dragged behind a boat. The sonar goes out either side ofthe fish and it hits the rock surfaces and the sand surfaces below and reflectsthem back to produce an image that archaeologists can then study to try tofigure out what they are looking at on the ocean floor.But it's not really so simple as I learned today in a conversation with MichaelArbuthnot who is working toward his Ph.D. in Anthropology and UnderwaterArchaeology at Florida State University. Michael works with side scanningsonar radar at an ancient underwater camp site that goes back to the last Ice Ageoff the coast of Tallahassee.Side scan sonar image of a submerged Ice Age archaeological site off the coast fromTallahassee,Florida.

You can"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"get similar readings from completely different types of materials under water. Itdoesn't distinguish between something that is made of metal or something that ismade of stone.EVEN IF YOU SEE SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK STANDS OUTON SIDE SCAN SONAR, UNLESS YOU CAN GET DOWN WITHVIDEO IMAGING CAMERAS, YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHATYOU HAVE?Absolutely. It can be very deceiving. I talked to you a little bit before how atone point we thought we were looking at a cannon. But when we dived the sitewe saw it was nothing more than coral growth.GOING TO THE RED AND YELLOW SHADES OF AN ACTUAL SIDESCAN SONAR IMAGE THAT YOU JPEGED TO ME BY E-MAIL, CANYOU BRIEFLY EXPLAIN FOR A RADIO AUDIENCE, WHAT THAT ISFROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND WHAT THE DISTANCE IS THAT IT ISCOVERING?Well, beginning with the red and yellow tones are basically contrasts that tellyou about the different reflecting signals you are getting. But what we arelooking at is the J. J. Hunt site. It is a submerged prehistoric archaeological siteoff northwestern Florida, near Tallahassee. The site has late Pleistocene and midto early Holocene which is anywhere from ten thousand to six thousand yearsold artifacts that have been found there. We are looking at a pretty largeperspective here. It's a composite mosaic of three different sites and sonar imagesthat covers about 1,000 square meters. You can see when you blend thedifferent sonar tracks together that you have a dramatic contrast, whether youare going east and west or north and south. Depending on different conditions,your sonar will give you different readings and feedback.WE'RE LOOKING DOWN LIKE FROM AN AIRPLANE?It's a birdseye view.The depth there is only about ten to fourteen feet, dependingupon the tide.IF YOU TOOK THAT SAME TECHNOLOGY DOWN 2,200 FEET TOTHAT SITE OF THE WESTERN COAST OF CUBA, WOULD THEIMAGE LOOK ANY DIFFERENT IN THE SIDE SCAN DOUBLEFREQUENCY SONAR THAT THEY ARE USING?Probably - it kind of depends on what is down there. If there is something moreto reflect the sonar, it's going to look different. What we're looking at here (inIce Age site) is a site that is fairly flat. I don't think there was anything more thanabout two or three feet high sitting up off of the fairly flat sandy, sea bottom. So,according to certain initial reports from Cuba, there are all kinds of high relief,what they are calling 'structures.' So, yeah, it would look different. But generallydouble frequency side scanning sonar is going to produce an image that's goingto give you generally similar to what we are seeing at our J. J. Hunt site.IT WOULD BE IN THE RED AND YELLOW SHADES?You can adjust the contrast to give you different shades that relate to differentintensities of sonar returns. The yellow in this case is sonar signal broken upmore. The red are smoother surfaces.IF YOU TOOK THAT SAME TECHNOLOGY DOWN 2,200 FEET TOTHAT SITE OF THE WESTERN COAST OF CUBA, WOULD THEIMAGE LOOK ANY DIFFERENT IN THE SIDE SCAN DOUBLEFREQUENCY SONAR THAT THEY ARE USING?Probably - it kind of depends on what is down there. If there is something moreto reflect the sonar, it's going to look different. What we're looking at here is asite that is fairly flat. I don't think there was anything more than about two orthree feet high sitting up off of the fairly flat sandy, sea bottom. So, according tocertain initial reports from Cuba, there are all kinds of high relief, what they arecalling \"structures.\" So, yeah, it would look different. But generally doublefrequency side scanning sonar is going to produce an image that's going to giveyou generally similar to what we are seeing there.WHEN YOU ARE USING SIDE SCAN SONAR IMAGERY, IT IS NOT"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"LIKE A PHOTOGRAPH?No, no, it is not. That's a misconception. Sometimes when you are looking at it,it looks as if you could interpret it like a photograph. But then when you'velooked at enough images over time and you can look at the same location, thesame coordinates from a side scan sonar images that are taken going say on anorth/south track line versus an east/west track line over the exact same locationand you're going to get feedback that could look very different.\"More Information:Plato Discusses AtlantisPlato, the great philosopher of Athens, Greece, was born in 427 B. C. Plato wasa great admirer of Socrates and founded the famous school of philosophy in thegrove Academus where Socrates and others would discuss the nature of man,earth and the cosmos.Plato wrote about those dialogues in a series of books. A continent of Atlantisthat sunk into the sea is discussed in Volume IX, Timaeus, Critias, Cleitophon,Menexenus, Epistles, Translated by R. G. Bury. Critias describes an ancient taleabout a great continent called Atlantis.He said, \"a mighty host, which, starting from a distant point in the Atlanticocean, was insolently advancing to attack the whole of Europe, and Asia toboot. For the ocean there was at that time navigable; for in front of the mouthwhich you Greeks call, as you say, 'the pillars of Heracles,' there lay an islandwhich was larger than Libya and Asia together; and it was possible for thetravelers of that time to cross from it to the other islands, and from the islands tothe whole of the continent over against them which encompasses that veritableocean.For all that we have here, lying within the mouth of which we speak, is evidentlya haven having a narrow entrance; but that yonder is a real ocean, and the landsurrounding it may most rightly be called, in the fullest and truest sense, acontinent. Now in this island of Atlantis there existed a confederation of kings,of great and marvelous power, which held sway over all the island, and overmany other islands also and parts of the continent; and moreover, of the landshere within the Straits they ruled over Libya as far as Egypt and over Europe asfar as Tuscany.\"Then there is a description of warring and slavery followed by this:\"But at a later time there occurred portentous earthquakes and floods, and onegrievous day and night befell them (the Atlanteans), when the whole body ofyour warriors was swallowed up by the earth, and the island of Atlantis in likemanner was swallowed up by the sea and vanished; wherefore also the ocean atthat spot has now become impassable and unsearchable, being blocked up bythe shoal mud which the island created as it settled down.\"After posting the above news story, I received the following e-mail on June 14,2001:Ms. Howe,I'm sure you are familiar with the Edgar Cayce Readings on Atlantis.He mentions: \"The sinking of Lemuria in the South Pacific at the timethe poles shifted; the destruction of the area now known as theSargasso Sea;....\" As you known, the Sargasso Sea is near Cubathough not necessarily western Cuba. However, Cayce purports this"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"area to be Atlantis. I came across the above as a footnote to Reading364-6.Mr. Cayce gave a talk to the Norfolk Study Groups on Atlantis onFebruary 19, 1932. To date, the following (published in the October1932 BULLETIN) is the only record of that talk. If a copy of theoriginal lecture in its entirety is found we will include it here.VOL. I - No. 2 OCTOBER, 1932B U L L E T I NASSOCIATION FOR RESEARCH AND ENLIGHTENMENT, INC.,Virginia Beach, VirginiaTHE LOST CONTINENT OF ATLANTIS:Edgar Cayce: \"The position as the continent Atlantis occupied, isthat as between the Gulf of Mexico on the one hand and theMediterranean upon the other. Evidences of this lost civilization areto be found in the Pyrenees and Morocco to the east and BritishHonduras, Yucatan and America to the west. There are someprotruding portions within this that must have at one time or anotherbeen a portion of this great continent. The British West Indies or theBahamas, especially in Bimini, would, upon geological investigation,show the most pronounced traces of the destroyed civilization.\"210-C-A [364-3](2/16/32) Further data discloses that Atlantian history covered aperiod of 200,000 years, as we would measure time today. Duringthis period there were many geographical changes in the earth'ssurface that directly affected this continent. The most notable ofthese were: The sinking of Lemuria in the South Pacific at the timethe poles shifted; the destruction of the area now known as theSargasso Sea; and the final destruction. In size, this country wasoriginally about that of Europeincluding European Russia. After the second great upheaval it wasbroken up into a group of large islands, Poseidia, Aryan, and Og.\"Before the final destruction, some ten thousand B.C., many of theinhabitants migrated to adjoining countries. The Inca and Aztec weredescendants of the resulting mixtures, as were the American Indians,though a little farther removed from direct descent. Archaeologicalwork will doubtless uncover within the next few years evidences ofthis direct connection with the ancient home of the red race.\"We b s it e s :http://www.teamatlantis.com/Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.ca"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"All rights reserved."}]
