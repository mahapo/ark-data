Photograph courtesy Sheriff Joe BradHudson,Grayson County Sheriff's Department.June 9, 2001 Washington, D. C. - This week President George Bush heard hisown personally hand-picked scientific panel tell him that global warming is real,man-made, poses threats in the future and that the global temperature could risebetween 2.5 and 10.4 degrees Fahrenheit over this century. When Bush createdthe panel in March, the President said he was unsure that global warming was areal phenomenon. Now his own panel of climate experts, including a NobelPrize winner and members of the National Academy of Sciences, has answeredwith these sobering words:\"Human-induced warming and associated sea-level rises are expectedto continue through the 21st century. National policy decisions madenow and in the longer-term future will influence the extent of anydamage suffered by vulnerable human populations and ecosystemslater in this century.\"In March, Bush dropped a campaign promise to restrict carbon dioxideemissions from older power plants that produce the most pollution because hesaid it was more important to have more electricity production. The UnitedStates now produces a quarter of the world's greenhouse gases and our carbondioxide emissions alone increased thirteen percent in the 1990s.Yet, the United States still refuses to support the 1997 Kyoto Protocolnegotiated by the Clinton administration which calls for a 7 % reduction inglobal warming gases by 2012 compared to 1990 emissions. European nationsstrongly support the treaty and are very upset over Bush's declaration tobusinesses that there will be no Kyoto Protocol. The chairman of a U. N. panelon climate change told reporters that there are enough countries outside the U.S. to ratify the Kyoto Treaty and he has asked European nations to give the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"United States one last chance to support the Kyoto Protocol next month inGermany during a U.

This week in the journal Science, two studies try to answer the oldquestion: What killed off the mammoths, mastodons and other large animals inNorth and South America and Australia?Researchers found that 55 species of every large land animal, reptile and bird inAustralia weighing more than 220 pounds disappeared within 10,000 years ofhuman arrival. And in the Americas toward the end of the last Ice Age, 73percent of large plant eaters, saber-toothed cats, wooly mammoths, camels,mastodons and large ground sloths were gone within 1200 years of humanmigration here.The author of the study, John Alroy of the University of California, SantaBarbara, writes, \"Human population growth and hunting almost invariably leadto major mass extinctions. The results show how much havoc our species cancause without anyone at the time having the slightest idea of what is going on,much less any intention of causing harm.\"Leitchfield farming community southwest of Louisville, Kentucky.Leitchfield, Kentucky -Many other large and small animals have died in the modern age from amysterious assailant that usually kills in the night and leaves cattle, horses,goats, sheep, pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs, elk, and deer dead and mutilated withoutsigns of struggle or blood. Usually an ear, eye, half the face, tongue, genitals andrectal tissue are cut away. Sometimes clean, bloodless holes are foundpenetrating an inch or two, \"like a biopsy plug was taken,\" as one sheriff said.Such a report was filed two weeks ago in the Grayson County Sheriff's office inLeitchfield, Kentucky between Louisville and Hopkinsville. The small horsefarm in Leitchfield has been run by Mike and Rose Downs the past four years.The couple was delighted when one of their mares gave birth to a healthy malecolt the first of March this year. Then on May 25th in the morning, Mike andRose could not find the 3-month-old colt and noticed buzzards circling in theair above their pasture. I talked with Rose Downs this weekend about what theyfound."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Colt laying dead and mutilated about 150 yards from house and barn at the Mike and RoseDownsfarm in Leitchfield, Kentucky on May 25, 2001.

And she was like sprayingmilk. And my husband said that was not right, she shouldn't be spraying milklike that. We looked right outside the barn and he said, 'The colt's not with her.'And he said something was wrong so we walked down through the fields andcame to where the colt was and I said, 'Something is wrong with the colt. It'sdown.'And then when we walked up to it is when we realized that it was dead. Myhusband got to looking at it and saw it had been shot.\"Sheriff Notified About Colt That Had Been ShotTHE DOWNS CALLED THE GRAYSON COUNTY, KENTUCKY SHERIFF'SOFFICE AND SHERIFF JOE BRAD HUDSON GOT TO THE PASTUREAROUND 1 P.M. ON MAY 25TH.Joe Brad Hudson, Sheriff, Grayson County, Kentucky (four years),Leitchfield, Kentucky: \"Mr. Downs thought it was a gun shot. He looked at itand it was shot right in the chest area right below its neck with what appeared tous to be a slug. It was a perfect circle about an inch in diameter, but there wasno exit wound.

But the neighbor come over while we were downthere with Mr. Downs looking at this horse and went over the incident and hesaid both the vagina and ears were taken off that cow about a year ago.YOU ARE SAYING GUNSHOT WOUND, BUT DID YOU RETRIEVEANY KIND OF BULLET?No. The only reason I was clued in to it being a slug is that a slug makes a cleanhole that stays open, whereas a normal gunshot wound would go in and tissuewould go back and wouldn't make a hole. This was a perfect inch circle hole.DID YOU HAVE VETERINARIAN OR PATHOLOGIST CUT INTOTHAT HOLE TO SEE WHAT WAS THERE?No, they opted not to. I left it with the owner who was willing to bury it. I don'tknow if he has or he hasn't. But we just did a criminal mischief report as wenormally would.SO ALL THE TISSUE ON THE HEAD ITSELF, THE EARS, EYES, THETONGUE AND SO FORTH, THAT WAS INTACT?That was intact.IN WHAT PART OF THE COLT'S NECK WAS THIS HOLE?It was right in the center.AT THE BACK OR DOWN BELOW AT THE THROAT?It's below the throat like where your breast bone. It was right there. If the horseis standing facing you, right between its legs where the chest first starts to rollup, that's where it was.AND RIGHT BELOW THERE NOT TOO FAR IS PROBABLY WHERETHE HEART MIGHT BE IF YOU KEPT GOING?Correct.NOW WHERE THE PENIS AND SCROTUM SHOULD HAVE BEEN CAN YOU DESCRIBE EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAW IN TERMS OFTHE DEPTH OF THAT EXCISION?It was just scalped.DOWN JUST TO THE MUSCLE?Ye s .IT WAS ONLY HIDE DEEP?Right. It was just the hide and what was hanging there was taken.WHAT EXACTLY WERE YOU LOOKING AT - AN OVAL OR CIRCLE?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"There wasn't a pattern to it. It was like someone just took a knife to it and startedcutting, picking up skin and cutting, until they got around to the anus and thenthey come back around the other side.THIS IS AN EXCISION THAT EXTENDED FROM THE PENIS ANDSCROTUM BACK AROUND THE RECTAL AREA?Right, but the rectum was intact.COULD YOU FIND ANY TRACKS OF ANY KIND AROUND THEHORSE?We looked for tracks. We looked for shotgun shells. We looked all around thecolt. We couldn't find nothing. There wasn't no blood drippings or nothing.HAVE YOU IN YOUR LAW ENFORCEMENT CAREER EVER SEENANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS BEFORE?No. Not to that extent.\"What Could Have Happened?Rose Downs: \"Really we don't know what could happen or why anyone wouldeven want to do that. I mean, that is sad. That was a sad situation to see that coltlaying there like that. I mean, it's very disturbing. It makes you feel scared. Or itdoes me. I'm a woman and I have a teenage daughter here at home with me. It'sputs a scared feeling in you knowing something like can happen that close toyou.HOW FAR WAS THE COLT LYING IN THE PASTURE FROM YOURHOUSE?I don't know how to measure, but it was laying just right over the hill fromwhere our barn is and our barn sets in our backyard.DID YOU HEAR ANY UNUSUAL SOUNDS OR HEAR ANYONEREPORT ANYTHING UNUSUAL ON THE NIGHT OF WHAT WOULDHAVE BEEN MAY 24TH BEFORE YOU FOUND IT ON THE 25TH?No, we didn't hear anything, but our neighbors reported to the police that theyheard gunshots the night before.YET A GUNSHOT WOULD HAVE LEFT BLOOD ON THE WOUNDAND THE SHERIFF SAID THERE WAS NO BULLET.I can't answer your question. I don't know.IF THE COLT WAS NOT SHOT, WHAT MADE THAT HOLE ANDWHAT DID EXCISE THE GENITALS?I know. Like I said, I have a teenage daughter and now she says she's scared towalk outside at night. I just don't see how anyone could do something like thatto a colt. Or anything else. It's just a baby.\"The colt mutilation is still under investigation by the Grayson County Sheriff'sDepartment and anyone with information is asked to contact the Sheriff's officeat 270-259-3024.

The sheriff says the bulls'abdomens have been sliced open and their genitals cut off. Sometimes thetongues and internal organs have been removed. Confounding the Texasinvestigations just as in the Kentucky colt mutilation, there are no signs ofhuman involvement such as tire tracks, shoe prints, shell casings, or cigarettebutts.

But we don'tand it is a mystery to me.\"To date after more than forty years of the worldwide animal mutilationphenomenon, no one has been arrested, arraigned and convicted anywhere onan animal mutilation charge.
