Associate Producer, Jax Hayes (glasses),listens.Photograph © 2001 by Linda Moulton Howe.The history behind the drawing is described in an article prepared for theVietnam Cryptozoic and Rare Animals Research Centre (CRARC) in Hanoi, butso far has not been published. The author is Helmut Loofs-Wissowa on thefaculty of Asian Studies, Australian National University, Canberra, Australia.His paper is entitled \"Wildman Research in Vietnam in Historical andGeographical Perspective.\"Prof. Loofs-Wissowa reports that as far back as the \"first centuries A.D. talkabout gigantic apes in the far south of China; a Ming Chinese dictionarymentions a yellow-haired ape with a human face and with human feet, calledSing-sing, known from Yunnan and Tongking; another Chinese dictionary alsomentions a huge (3.5 meters tall/ about 12 feet) red-haired ape with a humanface, Chan-tu, living in Tongking and southernmost China, which attacks peopleand eats them.\"American GIs See \"Bigfoot\" in Vietnam WarThe professor outlines other eyewitness reports in the 20th century, includingmany described encounters by American GIs. \"One occurred in late 1964 or1965 just inside Laos, about midway between Lang Mo (North Vietnam) andAng Kham (Laos) and involved a downed helicopter the four crew members ofwhich were found dead, obviously as a result of the crash. However, the bodiesof four North Vietnamese soldiers were also found nearby without any kind ofbullet or combat wounds: they seemed to have died of a broken back! When themontagnards of the rescue patrol saw this, they became very quiet, lookedsuspiciously around and murmured something about 'Hairy Man.'Prof. Loofs-Wissowa also describes another incident that occurred in late 1968\"in a mountain area near a village on the Song Giang in northern Quang BinhProvince, North Vietnam, only about 100 kilometers north of the location of thefirst incident. This time it involved a shot-down U. S. fighter plane the pilot ofwhich had ejected and was found hanging by his parachute in a tree above theriver, badly wounded, but semi-conscious. Here again, two North Vietnamesemilitiamen were found dead near the foot of the tree without visible wounds.When the pilot, a young Lt. Col., was cut down, he still had the force to say thatit was 'a big gorilla' that had killed the two Vietnamese below.\"The \"Minnesota Iceman\"The professor also describes the infamous \"Minnesota Iceman\" which wasstudied by the \"Father of Cryptozoology,\" Dr. Bernard Heuvelmans in December1968. Dr. Heuvelmans had been contacted about an unknown hairy adult male"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"human-ape creature frozen in a block of ice on a farm in remote southeasternMinnesota. The scientist traveled to the farm with science writer, IvanSanderson, to see for himself. Prof. Loofs-Wissowa summarizes what Dr.Heuvelmans wrote about the Minnesota Iceman in his 1974 book L'Homme deNeanderthal est Toujours Vivant that includes the drawings the scientist madeof the entity in the ice.Fig. 1: Rough sketch of the body by Dr. Bernard Heuvelmans in December 1968 of whathe calledHomo pongoides in the block of ice contained in a coffin-like freezer on the remoteMinnesota farmrun by a Frank D. Hansen, a former Captain in the 343rd Fighter Group of the USAFstationedat Danang, Vietnam. Fig. 2: Scientific drawing by Dr. Heuvelmans of the Iceman\"after rectification of optical distortions through the ice.\" Sketches from book L'Homme deNeanderthalest Toujours Vivant by Dr. Bernard Heuvelmans, Ph.D., and Boris Porchnev, Paris, 1974.Professor Loofs-Wissowa studied Dr. Heuvelmans's book and summarized thescientist's findings this way: \"(Dr. Heuvelmans and Ivan Sanderson) wereconvinced (the entity was) a recently killed (obviously by a bullet) unknownhairy adult male Hominid; the creature, frozen in ice in a supine position, waslying in a large coffin-like freezer through the glass top of which it could be seenas clearly as the varying opacity of the ice allowed.\"For three days, these two very experienced specialists, and in particularHeuvelmans who by then had already firmly established himself as one of theworld's best-known professional zoologists, photographed and sketched thecreature from all sides and angles, so as to be able to eventually produce areliable composite picture of it, including precise measurements\"The most basic one, its height, turned out to be 1.80 meters with knees slightlyflexed and 1.84 meters if totally extended, thus exactly 6 feet tall. ...There couldbe no doubt whatsoever that this was a genuine comparatively fresh body andnot a dummy as has been suggested by some ill-informed commentators as theputrid odor of decomposing flesh could be perceived. This had already beennoticed by earlier visitors amongst whom the professional herpetologist TerryCullen (he was the one who alerted Ivan Sanderson to the existence of thisstrange exhibit) who also observed plant matter in the teeth and shed skins ofektoparasites (lice) on the skin of this cadaver, things never ever found on adummy!\"Frank Hansen told Dr. Heuvelmans and Ivan Sanderson that he bought thecreature already encased in a block of ice from a Hong Kong curio dealer who"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"claimed he bought it from Russian seal hunters who found it floating off thecoast of the Kamchatka Peninsula. In fact, Hansen first exhibited the Icemanunder the name \"Sibirskoye Creature. \"But Dr. Heuvelmans decided that since Frank Hansen had been based in an airbase in Danang, Vietnam, and since New York's World Journal Tribune hadpublished a brief story in November 1966 about some kind of ape having beenshot by U. S. Marines - that Hansen probably shipped the killed creature hometo the United States in a GI coffin in hopes of making money off its exhibition.Instead, he began to worry about murder and illegal shipment charges andeventually the Minnesota Iceman disappeared, leaving behind only the precisedrawings and some photographs taken by Dr. Bernard Heuvelmans and themystery: was it one of the enigmatic \"wildmen\" of Laos and Vietnam?Later on, painter Alika Lindbergh worked under the scientific supervision of Dr.Heuvelmans to reconstitute a drawing of what the Homo pongoides might havelooked like alive and standing on its feet. The result is Figure 3 in Dr.Heuvelmans's book and the same drawing used on the leaflets that BangProductions Ltd. handed out at the market in Xepon, Laos.Reconstitution drawing of what Minnesota Icemanmight have looked like alive and upright,based on the scientific drawings andmeasurements made in December 1968 by Dr. Bernard Heuvelmans.January 1996 Wildmen Research in Ban Kador, LaosVillagers in Ban Kador, Laos near the Vilaburi (Vilabouli) region beyond Xepontalked to Prof. Helmut Loofs-Wissowa in January 1996 about the Heuvelmansdrawing below. The professor wrote about his trip to Ban Kador in a paperentitled \"Hard on the Heels of Wildman in Laos: A Report of Work in 1996.\"The village Headman talked with knowledge about a creature called Briau(BREE-ow) that \"walks upright on two legs like a man, has long arms, darkbrown to black fur with a reddish tinge and is very dangerous.\"When the professor spread out a dozen pictures and drawings of apes andprehistoric man, including the reconstituted drawing of the Minnesota Iceman,in front of Ban Kador villagers, everybody pointed to Dr. Heuvelmans's Homopongoides drawing as being the best likeness.Continued in Part 4: The Rugged Road to Vilabouli"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"More Information:Eyewitness of \"Iceman\" at Minnesota State Fair:I received an e-mail from a Minneapolis, Minnesota resident which reads:\"I'm writing because I saw the \"Iceman\" at the Minnesota State Fair.The year was either 1968 or 1969. I'm not exactly sure which year.I remember going into the back of small enclosed trailer or semi-truckand paying probably 50 cents to see this thing. I was very skepticalwhen I went in. Upon climbing up the stairs into the trailer, I wentinside to a single room. There was a large freezer on the ground.Encased in a solid block of clear ice was the \"Iceman.\"I really expected the thing to be a dummy made of wax. You couldwalk all the way around the freezer and gaze down on the thing.Press your nose up against the glass. What I remember observing wasmainly the face of the thing. I remember looking closely at the facialhair. Very closely I could look down on this thing from directlyabove the glass freezer case and see the tiny pores on the face. Andfrom each pore on the lower part of the face, there was a black haircoming out. The eyes were shut. The detail was amazing. It lookedreal. I was impressed. I remember thinking that this could be a realbody.I remember the facial characteristics were reminiscent of drawings Ihave seen in the past of what a caveman might look like. Wide face.Very hairy over the whole body and face. The skin color was of aCaucasian human. About five feet tall. I don't remember the lowerhalf of the body that well. I think the way the thing was set in the ice,the head was closer to the surface of the ice than the lower torso. Idon't remember seeing any genitals. Maybe this part of the body wasobscured by ice. The thing was quite hairy.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
