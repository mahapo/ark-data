Book published in 1998 by Beachcomber Books, Canada.September 29, 2001 - Two weeks ago there was a Bigfoot conference inJefferson, Texas. Two speakers presented two different sides of the hairy,hominoid mystery: the physical evidence and the connection of Bigfootcreatures with mysterious lights and sudden disappearances.First, there is all the physical evidence of footprints, hairs, and eyewitnesses whohave seen and described for decades very tall, hairy, hominoids that resemblehumans. A wildlife biologist who became interested in the Bigfoot phenomenonwhen he was in school in Ontario, Canada more than thirty years ago is JohnBindernagel, Ph.D. He is author of one of the best books about Bigfoot researchentitled, North America's Great Ape: The Sasquatch."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"John Bindernagel, Ph.D., a wildlife biologist with overthirty years field experience.

That closed mindedattitude puzzled and upset him.

Southeast is Everett., Washington near the Snohomish back country wheremany eyewitnesses have seen eight to 12 foot tall hairy hominoids and heard themmake high-pitched screams that have been recorded on tape.Interview:John Bindernagel, Ph.D., Wildlife Biologist, D. A. Blood Associates,Courtenay, B. C. Canada: \"We were able to get back and make a plaster castof those tracks. So, from that date on I had this large plaster cast of this hugehuman-like foot on my desk. And it didn't go away and I would raise it up oncein awhile and think: 'There is really an important wildlife subject to be dealtwith here.' But I was always trying to remain employable and credible and it wasnot a subject one could raise and not be laughed at or ridiculed. So I kept quiet,even with that for awhile.And now I guess I'm moving into that area that is almost, What is the philosophyof science? Why the resistance? Why the denial? And I am getting a fewthoughts on that now and realize that we North American wildlife biologists,we're not trained in Great Apes. We're trained in wolves, deer, moose, all thestuff we know is here. We don't think we have Great Apes, so we don't do theGreat Ape literature. If we did, I think we would see the photographs of thesetracks, we would see the plaster casts, we would hear the reports anddescriptions and we would realize that what's being described as an uprightgorilla is something very close to that.COULD YOU PLEASE GO TO, I THINK, ONE OF THE MOREAMAZING EYEWITNESS ACCOUNTS ABOUT WATCHING THEFAMILY OF WHAT APPEARS TO BE A MALE, FEMALE ANDPERHAPS A CHILD ON THAT HILLSIDE THAT HAD ALL THEROCKS.Sasquatch habitat in the Mount Hood National Forest in the Cascade Range, Oregon,near the feeding site of the three Sasquatch observed by logger Glen Thomas in November1967.Mt. Hood is in the background. Photograph © John Bindernagel, Ph.D.This is a very interesting report by a logger of the name Glen Thomas who hadbeen supervising construction of a road in the Mt. Hood area of Oregon. He leftthe work site because work was proceeding satisfactorily and walked up on arocky ridge and saw what he now describes as an adult male Sasquatch, an adultfemale and an immature. And they were walking across this rock slide and theadults were picking up rocks and sniffing them and putting them down again.But they didn't put them back where they had found them. They stacked themand it's almost the way we would build a cairn along a hiking trail."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"These are rocks sniffed and stacked by the two adult Sasquatches observed byGlen Thomas as they dug for hibernating ground squirrels near Mt. Hood, Oregon,in November 1967. Photograph © by John Bindernagel, Ph.D.So, they just left all these cairns behind, these piles of stacked rocks. And thenthe male smelled something he really liked and he began to dig in the rock slide.And after he got down about five feet, he began pulling up hibernating groundsquirrels in bedding of grass and ferns and other vegetation and they beganeating them with the male and female getting most of them. And I think theyoung one just getting one. And eventually, they spotted the logger and ran off.SO YOU DID GET TO SEE THOSE STACKED ROCKS FORYOURSELF?Yes, I did. I have a photograph of myself standing in that pit and looking at thoserocks and went there twice.John Bindernagel, Ph.D., standing in the 5-foot-deep, steep-sided pit dug by the adult maleSasquatch in November 1967 while observed by logger, Glen Thomas.

Photograph © John Green.WHERE IS THE ONE PLACE YOU THINK WOULD BE MOSTLIKELY TO SEE A BIGFOOT/SASQUATCH ALIVE WITH YOUR OWNEYES?I'm following up on reports on the British Columbia coast where clam diggershave heard calls in the night, found tracks on the beach in the winter during theclam digging season and that's my plans now with a boat I've just acquired to getout there in some of the worst weather of the year in December and January. Butit's a time that seems Sasquatches in that area do come down in the inner tidalzone to feed on shell fish. I think that is going to prove to be one of the besthabitats but it's also a very difficult area to work in.WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WILL TAKE TO FINALLY CONVINCETHE SCIENTIFIC WORLD THAT THIS CREATURE THAT HAS BEENDESCRIBED FROM CHINA IN THE 1ST CENTURY A.D. - THAT'SALMOST 2000 YEARS AGO WHAT WILL IT TAKE IT TAKE TOCONVINCE SCIENTISTS THAT THIS IS WORTH STUDYING ANDTRYING TO COMPREHEND?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I think it is going to take a carcass, a body. I keep hoping there will be a kind ofroad injury where one is kind of bruised and damaged, but is able to bephotographed, DNA taken and then it goes off again. That might be the best casescenario. But it might take bones on a table and a hide. For museum people,they have to be more rigorous than some others. I think intellectually we canexamine a lot of this evidence and make sense of it and make some conclusions,but that takes quite an effort. There is the problem that we don't have peopleworking in this area. There is technology available, but not a willingness toapply it to this subject.WHAT ARE SCIENTISTS AFRAID OF?Well, certainly from my profession of wildlife biologists, we have dropped theball on this one I would say big time! For years, people have been comingforward, not necessarily to biologists, but to police and conservation officersdescribing this apelike creature. And biologists are saying, 'No, you must bemisidentifying a bear. Bears get up on their hind legs and they look very muchlike a human.' Well, to anyone who has seen any number of bears, this simplydoesn't wash. It's a very poor explanation.From John Bindernagel's book, he writes, \"In the left side view, note the prominent snout(of the bear.) In the right front view, note the sloping or tapered shoulders and the shorthindlegs with a corresponding low crotch. The pointed ears are normally visible.\"Black bear drawings courtesy Wendy Dyck.Comparison of Bears to SasquatchDr. Bindernagel writes: \"In the left side view, note the relatively flat face (and absenceof a prominent snout seen in bear). In the front right view, note especially the prominent,squarish shoulders (compared with the sloping or tapered shoulders of a bear). Note alsothe long"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"legs and high crotch of the Sasquatch compared with the short hind legs and low crotch of abear.Sasquatch drawings courtesy Wendy Dyck. Outlines above based on the drawings of theSasquatch in the 1967 Patterson-Gimlin film by John Green, On the Track of theSasquatch.But again, it comes back to the authority of our field guides. The Sasquatch isnot in the field guides. Bears are. It's the closest image. So we have the authorityof these books saying, 'If this thing existed, it would be in the book and it isn't.Therefore, it doesn't exist.HOW CAN SOMETHING IN THE 6 TO 12 TO 13 FEET HEIGHT BEWORLDWIDE AND YET WE FIND NO SKELETONS. DO WE HAVESOME YET UNIDENTIFIED UNDERGROUND STRUCTURES ONTHE PLANET THAT THESE CREATURES LIVE IN?I can understand those questions being raised. I don't think we have to go thatfar. Being a wildlife biologist and knowing that I've only found two bear skullsin my whole thirty year career, only a few dozen deer skeletons, but having seenhundreds of deer and a lot of bears. Skeletons, bones, don't stick around quite asmuch as we think.Teeth might, but the skeletons would be dispersed by scavengers and breakdown. And teeth would sink into the soil. If we start accepting we are dealingwith a primate here, and I might say sort of fellow primate, we could sort ofunderstand that there is a lot of intelligence involved. This creature probablyobserves us and our habits and if it chooses to unobserved, is able to do so. Andmany of the observations that are made is when it feels safe for some reason orindifferent to the presence of humans and just sort of allows itself to be seen.\"Adult female Sasquatch observed by William Roeon Mica Mountain, B. C., Canada, in October 1955.This drawing is by Mr. Roe's daughter under his direction.It shows several anatomical features also noted by other observers.These include long arms, short neck and deep chest.The obvious breasts indicate that it is an adult female.Drawing from On the Track of the Sasquatch © 1968 by John Green.Continued in Part 2.More Information:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"To report Sasquatch tracks, sightings or other evidence,Call John A.
