Ted and his sons, Matt and David,experimented by flashingbright lights at the sky after the September 11 catastrophe in New York City, Washington,D. C. andPennsylvania provoked the U. S. government to ground all flights, except authorizedmilitary missions.This sequence of 9 selected frames shows the light in the lower left advance upward over afive minute perioduntil it flared twice and disappeared.

Ted Randall has lived andworked in the Nashville area most of his life and reported to me this pastsummer that he and others were trying to cope with mysterious power surges at aHartsville radio station and surrounding offices where more than sixty birds werefound dead and their feathers melted as if exposed to intense heat ormicrowaves. (See: Earthfiles July 14, 18 and 25, 2001) Puzzled by all theunexplained power surges, he and his sons wondered if there might be a link tounusual aerial phenomenon. Ted called me on September 12 to let me knowthat he and his sons, David and Matt, were going to try flashing lights at thenight sky that was supposed to be empty simply to see what might happen.To their amazement, for over two hours the three men watched lights appear,move slowly a small distance, stop and disappear or move in a zigzag pattern. Ihave seen 23 minutes of videotape Ted got with his Sony camera in its nightvision mode. In one sequence shown above, a bright object appears in the lowerleft frame and for about five minutes, works its way up toward another light thatis assumed to be a star. When the slowly moving light reaches a point above thebackground star, the mysterious light pulses off and on and then disappears. Theonly aerial craft approved to fly that night were U. S. military jets andhelicopters, but none of the objects on Ted Randall's videotape move across theframe as jets or helicopters would. Lights not only appear, move and thendisappear, many were appearing and disappearing in the same place.What were the strange star-like objects that appeared and disappeared in the skyover Nashville on September 12?Interview:Ted Randall, Matt Randall and David Randall, Radio Engineers, WJKM(1090AM), at Cedar Vine Manor, Lebanon, Tennessee: Ted Randall, ChiefEngineer, WJKM 1090, Cedar Vine Manor Studios, Lebanon, Tennessee:\"When I was probably in the eighth grade, I had an interest in ham radio. Andpart of ham radio is Morse Code. I had a friend across town and we hadfabricated some reflector dishes from metal snow slides and put car headlightsinto these dishes and flashed Morse Code on the clouds. Now, this allowed usto send messages back and forth.A DIFFERENT KIND OF TELEPHONE THEN THAT YOU GUYS HADFIGURED OUT HOW TO USE THE CLOUDS TO SHINE LIGHTS ON.Te d : Right. The clouds would reflect and we could communicate back andforth. It was just something fun to do, nothing serious. However, one night wewere experimenting and I was trying to get the light bright enough so we mightnot even need a cloud, more like a search light going into the sky. We had the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"light going straight up in the air and began to send the Morse Code and all of asudden, I noticed there was a light flashing back at me. It was motionless andthere was not a sound. Back in the time when I was in 8th grade, there wasn'tsatellites, helicopters and stuff like that in the skies.ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE 1950s?Te d : No, it would be in the 1960s. And I got frightened. This light would flashwhen we flashed and flash back. And I became frightened and ran in the houseand that was it! That was the end of the light flashing for me because it justseemed too weird! I couldn't imagine what was flashing back at me.WE ARE AT 2001. THE CATASTROPHE HAPPENED ON SEPTEMBER11. YOU DECIDED WITH YOUR SONS TO SORT OF TRY THIS OLDCHILDHOOD EXPERIMENT AGAIN. AND I'M CURIOUS, MATT,WHEN ALL OF YOU ARE OUT IN THE YARD, WAS EVERYTHING INTHE SKY PRETTY MUCH DARK AND SILENT? WHAT WAS THESKY CONDITION WHEN YOU FIRST WENT OUT AND WHOFLASHED THE FIRST LIGHT AND WHAT HAPPENED?I believe David was first.DAVID, WHAT HAPPENED?David: We both have a giant 2 million watt lights. And I started flashing it up inthe sky in a random order and wait for something to happen.WHAT WAS THE MOST DRAMATIC YOU SAW?David: Throughout the night, I would have to say the most dramatic thing I sawwere the lights that would zigzag. They would start in a forward motion, thenbacktrack and go into forward motion again.THOSE WOULD START AT A PLACE IN THE SKY, DO THE ZIGZAGAND WHERE THEY WENT OUT WOULD BE AT THE END OF AZIGZAG AND THEY WOULD THEN FADE OR BLINK OUT?David: They would most of the time blink out. But there was one that wasbrighter blinked twice.TED, ON THE VIDEOTAPE WE CAN HEAR YOU SAY MANY TIMES,'I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM LOOKING AT.' CAN YOU GIVE US AFEEL OF SOME OF THE ACTION THROUGH THAT LENS THATYOU WERE SEEING?Te d : The lights would appear. You could see the stars very clearly through thenight vision on the camera, a very amazing device. But then, all of a suddenthese unexplained lights would appear. Not only would they appear, but theywould appear to come and go out of focus. With the camera faced on stars, thefocus of the camera is going to be on infinity. So for some of those lights to go inand out of focus did not make any sense. What were we looking at?I CAN ASSERT FROM HAVING SEEN A LOT OF VIDEOTAPE OFPHENOMENA IN THE NIGHT SKY THAT I WAS LOOKING AT A LOCKEDOFF CAMERA ON A TRIPOD. THERE IS NO MOTION WHATSOEVER INTHE BACK STAR FIELD. BUT YOU DO HAVE THESE PINPOINTS OFLIGHT THAT SEEM TO BE STARS. BUT THERE IS THIS OTHER ACTIONOF LIGHTS THAT SEEM TO COME IN AND GO OUT AT THE SAMEPLACE.MATT, COULD SEE WITH YOUR EYES ANYTHING LIKE THATLIGHT ON THE LOWER LEFT FRAME OF THE VIDEOTAPE WHICHSEEMS TO MOVE TOWARDS A LIGHT THAT SEEMS TO BE A STAR?Matt: You could see the light with your naked eye. But through the camera, you"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"could see much, much more. As soon as you placed the camera toward the nightsky, there was more than you could see. It's mind boggling what's up there!DAVID, WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE NIGHTSKY WAS BLACK WHEN YOU FIRST GOT THERE AND ON THEVIDEOTAPE ITSELF, THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE ANYTHINGTHERE UNTIL YOU SEE THE FRAMES WASHED OUT BY YOURFIRST FLASHES OF LIGHT. HOW LONG AFTER THOSE FIRSTFLASHES OF LIGHT DID IT TAKE FOR UNUSUAL MOTION IN THESKY?David: I would say not more than five minutes. After I had flashed the light forabout five minutes, you could see things start to move around in the sky. Fatherstarted taping with the camera shortly after we started flashing with the light.THERE ARE 23 MINUTES IN THREE SEGMENTS AND I HAVE SEEN ITALL. AND WE KNOW THAT ON SEPTEMBER 12, ALL AIR TRAFFIC WASSUPPOSED TO BE DOWN AND NOTHING IN THE AIR EXCEPT FORAUTHORIZED MILITARY BECAUSE OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED IN NEWYORK, WASHINGTON, D. C. AND PENNSYLVANIA.WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR THREE MINDS WHEN FOR TWOHOURS OUTSIDE AND THE ONLY THING YOU ARE DOING ISFLASHING LIGHTS UP IN THE SKY AND GETTING THE TYPE OFREACTIONS YOU WERE SEEING?Te d : One thing I would like to say, Linda, is that the thing that was mostpuzzling was the fact that the lights would appear to respond to the flashing. Assoon as Matthew and David initiated the light sequence, these things wouldappear.SO THERE WAS A DISTINCT CONNECTION BETWEEN FLASHING THELIGHT AND THE MOTION IN THE SKY. THERE WAS A SIMILAR CASEIN MISSOURI. A BOOK WAS WRITTEN ABOUT IT. (See More Informationbelow: Project Identification by Harley D. Rutledge, Ph.D., © 1981)PROFESSOR RUTLEDGE (Chairman of the Physics Department at SoutheastMissouri State University) DID AN EXPERIMENT TO FLASH LIGHTS ATTHE SKY AND FOUND THERE WAS FLASHING BACK. AND NOW YOUHAVE GOTTEN A SIMILAR RESPONSE ON A CLEAR NIGHT WHENTHERE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY AIR TRAFFIC.I'M CURIOUS IN TALKING WITH PEOPLE IN YOUR GENERALAREA, WHAT DO THEY SAY IN THE CONTEXT OF ALL THEMYSTERIOUS POWER SURGES YOU HAVE HAD. HAS ANYONETRIED TO SUGGEST WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FLASHING BACKAT YOUR LIGHTS ON SEPTEMBER 12?Not really. We have been met with extreme skepticism and even anger by some.When other people experience anything like this, they just keep it all tothemselves.BECAUSE OF COMMUNITY REACTION OF DENIAL.Exactly.WHAT ABOUT YOU YOUNGER FELLOWS? HAVE YOU TALKEDABOUT THIS EXPERIMENT WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES AND HASANYONE ELSE AROUND HERE TRIED IT?Matt: I'm in high school and a couple friends of mine have tried flashing lightsand have seen some of the same things. Then there are other people who justthink you are absolutely crazy until they see it with their own eyes. I don'tknow. It's so strange and creepy when you see it with your own eyes. It reallymakes you wonder what is really out there."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"DOES THAT OLD ACRONYM 'UFO' CROSS YOUR MIND AT ALLGIVEN THAT NOTHING ABOUT THESE SEEMS STRUCTURED? BUTYOU CAN'T HELP WONDER IF THESE ARE THE TRAILS, THETRACKS, OF SOMETHING THAT IS EXTRATERRESTRIAL.David: It definitely makes you wonder. Before we tried this, I would justwonder, 'Is that an airplane?' But after September 12, when there was nocommercial airliners up there, what was it?!Matt: Also looking at the fact of the speed some of these things move in the sky.There is no way it can be a normal airplane.A LOT OF THEM. THAT ONE LIGHT IS MOVING A SHORT DISTANCEFOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES THAT I TRACKED OFF THEMINUTE:SECOND TIME ON THE TAPE. AND IT MOVES FROM ONEPLACE TO ANOTHER WITH A DISCERNIBLE MOTION. BUT IT STARTSAT A STANDSTILL AND THEN MOVES. AND WHEN IT FINALLY WENTOUT, IT DID SO WITH THOSE BLASTS OF BEING BRIGHT, DIM, BRIGHT,DIM AND THEN DISAPPEARING. AND IT DISAPPEARED AFTERMOVING FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES IN A LOCKED OFF CAMERAFRAME THAT IS FOCUSED AT INFINITY. AND A JET OR HELICOPTERGOING BY WOULD HAVE BEEN IN AND OUT OF THAT FRAME RATHERQUICKLY.SOME OF THE RAPIDLY MOVING LIGHTS, MIGHT BE METEORS.BUT FOR THE MOST PART, THERE SEEMS TO BE VERYANOMALOUS ACTION NO MATTER WHAT IT IS?David: Well, even with the zigzags that I saw. There are no aircraft that I haveseen in my life that can move like that. A lot of them look like falling stars, butwith the motions and tracking they go through, they can't be meteors.SOME OF THOSE THAT ARE FASTER THAN THE SLOWLY MOVINGOBJECTS SEEM TO HAVE A STARTING AND STOPPING POINT THATSEEM SHORTER THAN WHAT YOU WOULD ASSOCIATE WITHMETEORS.TED, WHEN YOU THINK BACK TO YOUR CHILDHOOD DAYS OFTRYING TO COMMUNICATE WITH CLOUDS AND YOU JUMP TO2001 AND YOU DID THIS AS AN EXPERIMENT BECAUSE THEREWASN'T SUPPOSED TO BE ANYTHING IN THE SKY WHAT HASGONE THROUGH YOUR MIND?Te d: I guess the thing that impressed me most using and looking through thecamera is that when you flashed the light, with your naked eye you might see alight come on and off. But with the camera and its night vision, you see not justone but several lights go on and off at the same time. This anomaly is occurringin the sky when no other aircraft except authorized military are supposed to bethere. And from 8th grade to now, it makes me wonder that someone has toknow something about what this is! I would assume that. If not, that issomething that makes you lay awake at night and wonder about.YOU ARE IN A RADIO STATION HERE BETWEEN NASHVILLE ANDLEBANON. DOES IT EVER CROSS YOUR MIND THAT WHAT YOUSHOULD DO IS CALL UP SOME OF THE MILITARY BASES AND TRYTO REPORT THIS? YOU COULD ASK IF THEY KNOW WHAT THISIS AND EXPLAIN TO THEM THAT YOU HAVE THIS VIDEOTAPETAKEN ON A NIGHT WHEN THERE WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BEANYTHING IN THE SKY. AND TELL THEM, 'YOU CAN LOOK ATTHIS VIDEOTAPE YOURSELF. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHATTHESE ARE.'Te d: To be honest with you, no, that has never crossed my mind. And I think thereason why is that in every case where we have tried to report about things,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"especially the situation in Hartsville (massive electrical surge See: Earthfiles July14 and 18, 2001), it's usually met with deaf ears.\"More Information:If any one has tried similar light experiments in night skies and videotapedsimilar light movements, please get in touch with me at:earthfiles@earthfiles.com.Or fax me at: 215-491-9842.Or write me at: P.
