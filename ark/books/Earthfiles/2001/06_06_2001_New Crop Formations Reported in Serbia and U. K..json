K.© 2001 by Linda Moulton Howe First week of June 2001 reported on television in Serbia, Yugoslavia.Photograph courtesy Milan Manchich.June 6, 2001 Serbia, Yugoslavia - Milan Manchich, grew up in Serbia, nowone of the two republics in the Federation of Yugoslavia. The other isMontenegro. Kosovo is a third political community currently under U. N.supervision. Milan reports by e-mail: \"Something or someone made this on theland near my home town. (Town name to be confirmed) This picture was on theevery TV station in Serbia. Local people noticed that animals was very disquietthe night before when in the morning people found this.Circle is about 50 meters diameter (162 feet) and bottom line (\"snail's neck\") isabout 100 meters (325 feet). Local police officer rejected that someone made ajoke. You may notice that figure looks lie snail, it is true.\"This Serbian formation is reminiscent of the \"snail\" discovered July 9, 1992 inan Alton Barnes, U. K. wheat field not far from Woodborough Hill. That 1992\"snail\" measured 414 feet long.\"Snail\" formation discovered July 9, 1992 in East Field wheat near Woodborough Hillin Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England.

Nelson.June 3, 2001 Wakerly village near Barrowden, Leicestershire, England -Nick Nicholson, Editor of The Circular Review in Calverton, Nottinghamshirereports that a new formation was discovered Sunday, June 3, at Wakerly villagenear Barrowden in barley. Nick writes in an e-mail: \"I found a major formationnear our last year's hunting ground (between Morcott and Seaton in"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Leicestershire County). No one locally knew of it before Sunday. It's made up ofan outer ring I estimate to be 120 feet in diameter and in the middle of thestanding crop is a 10-12 foot diameter circle surrounded by a narrow ring. Inbetween the inner and outer rings are a lot of lines and patterns which are hardto ascertain the exact design, but it sure looks good. Attached is ground imagewhich I took. Waiting for aerial.\"Second e-mail from Nick: \"I now have confirmation that this formation was notthere on Saturday, so that is three confirmations (that formation was freshSunday morning, June 3, 2001). We may fly it very soon. It looks to be veryinteresting. We have found out that the farmer is hostile (thinking hoaxers areinvolved.)\"June 3, 2001, Wakerley village near Barrowden, Leicestershire, England.Formation in barley was 120 feet in diameter. Discovered by Nick Nicholson, Editor,The Circular Review.

BiophysicistW. C. Levengood was involved in the Seaton, Leicestershire research andconcluded that formation was created with barley plants retarded in growth fromthe rest of the barley field and standing at least 6 inches shorter than the rest ofthe crop. The implication is that something interacted with the growing barley atleast a month before the formation was discovered in the Seaton field."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Unusual barley formation found at Wakerley village near Barrowden,Leicestershire County, England on June 3, 2001 by Nick Nicholas. The year before onJune 6, 2000, another unusual pattern was found in Seaton southwest of Wakerlydefined by retarded growth in only the barley plants that made up the formation.Levengood's hypothesis is that worldwide crop formations are the result of a\"spinning plasma vortex\" which contains microwave and other energies. He hasbeen able to affect plant growth in his laboratory using various microwavefrequencies. What he does not know is precisely the source of the spinningplasma vortices.We b s it e s :http://cropcircleconnector.com/column/review.htmlhttp://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.swirlednews.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
