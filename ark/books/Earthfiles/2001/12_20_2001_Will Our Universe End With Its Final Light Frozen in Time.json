Photograph courtesy Hubble Telescope.December 20, 2001 Cambridge, Massachusetts - In 1917, physicist AlbertEinstein wrote his General Theory of Relativity in which the speed of light wasconsidered the ultimate speed for anything in the universe. He thought back thenthat the universe was stationary, not expanding and not contracting. But sincegravity pulls things together, Dr. Einstein needed to explain why ordinary matterin the universe didn't collapse on itself. His answer was a repulsive force that hecalled the \"cosmological constant,\" a mysterious force that fills the vacuum ofspace balancing out gravity and keeping matter apart.Now in 2001, scientists say data from observations indicate that our universe isNOT stationary, but is expanding every second, every day, every year at anaccelerating rate. If so, why don't we notice changes in the world and skyaround us? Dr. Abraham Loeb, a theoretical astrophysicist at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Massachusetts, says it isDark Energy that is expanding at an increasing rate and taking matter along withit. What is Dark Energy? It's a modern term for Einstein's cosmological constant.But it's also the mysterious \"zero point\" energy in the vacuum of space whichmakes up two-thirds of the universe and scientists think it has become strongerthan the gravitational attraction of matter. The implication is that our universewill keep expanding more and more rapidly, forever.If so, what will happen as the clumps of matter we know as galaxies, includingour own Milky Way, recede further and further from everything else in theuniverse? Dr. Loeb, who grew up near Tel Aviv, Israel, did his post-doctoralwork at Albert Einstein's alma mater, the Princeton Institute for AdvancedStudies. He says that astronomers in the distant future will never see the end ofthe universe because light will \"freeze\" at a moment in time billions of yearsfrom now in a final frame, so to speak, that will never change, even when mostof the universe has receded so far from the Milky Way that only an empty voidwill surround what is left of matter as we know it. This week I talked with Dr.Loeb about why the universe will appear to end frozen in time.Interview:Abraham Loeb, Ph.D., Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Massachusetts: \"Thebottom line is that the universe seems to be accelerating now. We have knownfor several years that it is expanding, but its expansion seems to be accelerating.And that can happen if the vacuum itself contributes to the mass density of theuniverse.THIS IS WHERE THE DARK ENERGY COMES IN?Exactly. The Dark Energy seems to amount for about 70% of the density of theuniverse and the remaining 30% is matter, part of which is ordinary matter thatwe are familiar with in our daily life. And part of it is the Dark Matter which wedon't really know what it is, but we know it is other types of particles that areprobably very weakly interacting.OF THE 30% THAT IS DARK MATTER AND MATTER AS WE KNOWIT, HOW MUCH IS MATTER AS WE KNOW IT?Only 10% of that. So matter as we know it amounts to a total of maybe 3-5% ofthe total.OF THE TOTAL UNIVERSE AND ALL ITS CONSTITUENTS, THEMATTER WORLD WE ARE IN IS ONLY 3-5%?Yes, something like that, on average. Now, what happened here on earth and inthe solar system and so forth is that this matter segregated and formed theplanets and the sun, just like any other star. These objects are made of ordinarymatter. The other types of matter cannot segregate as efficiently. They cannot"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"cool and segregate and form objects like that.THEY MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF THE UNIVERSE?Yes, when you average the large volume, they make up the majority of theuniverse.IS IT TRUE THAT RIGHT NOW THE WORK YOU ARE DOING ANDOTHERS IS FOCUSING ON THE FACT THAT IT APPEARS THEDARK ENERGY HAS NOW WON THE BATTLE IN THE UNIVERSEOVER GRAVITY AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE A CONTINUALACCELERATING EXPANSION?Right. And it will become even more so in the future. The vacuum we believewill be more and more dominant as time goes on. And I was trying to think onemorning what the consequences might be for future generations of astronomers.You know, many years into the future, what will they be able to see from therest of the cosmos? What kind of sources (of energy such as galaxies, stars,x-rays, gamma rays) will they be able to see? Or if we monitor some of thesources in the sky, how would they appear in the more distant future? That'swhat my work is about.WHAT DO YOU SEE?I found actually to my surprise. Originally I was not aware of this. I found that ifyou extrapolate to a time when the universe would be ten times its present age,ten times older, then all of the sources that participate in the cosmic expansionwill be extremely dim. But in this process, their images will be frozen, fixed intime along their history.WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY?So, if you consider a given source in the sky - for example, a galaxy that is madeof stars like the sun. We consider that galaxy to follow the cosmic expansion. Itwill be pulled away from us by the cosmic expansion by an accelerated rate. Astime goes on, it will move faster and faster away from us and eventually, it'srecession velocity relative to us will exceed the speed of light. Radiation that isemitted by this (accelerating) source will not be able to catch up with the cosmicexpansion and we wouldn't be able to see how this galaxy evolved later on in itshistory.WHAT YOU MEAN IS THAT THINGS BECOME FROZEN IN TIMEBECAUSE PHOTONS CAN ONLY TRAVEL AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT.Right.IF THE RECEDING UNIVERSE AND ALL THE GALAXIES, SUNS ANDSO FORTH BEGIN ACCELERATING ULTIMATELY FASTER THANTHE SPEED OF LIGHT, AN ASTRONOMER ON EARTH WOULDNEVER SEE PAST THE PHOTON SPEED OF LIGHT.Would never be able to see past a certain point in time at which time the galaxyor source started receding faster than light away from us. So, one way to think ofit is that there is a horizon surrounding us and all these sources are exiting out ofthis horizon at some point along their history because they are being pulledaway from us at a speed larger than the speed of light. Now, this may lookparadoxical because Albert Einstein argued in his Special Theory of Relativitythat no object can move faster than light. So how is it possible to get this effect?Well, the point is that the speed of a particle is always defined locally, youmeasure it locally at a given point. And here we are talking about a global effectabout the source which is very far away. And space itself is expanding in thiscase. The source if you look at it locally, it doesn't move at all. But it is thespace of the universe that is expanding at an accelerated rate.ONCE THAT HAPPENS, WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IF I UNDERSTANDCORRECTLY, THAT THE EXPANSION OF THE UNIVERSE ITSELF,THE VACUUM, IN SPACE, WILL REACH AND EXCEED THE SPEEDOF LIGHT AND AT THAT POINT ALL STRUCTURES IN THEUNIVERSE BEYOND THAT SPEED OF LIGHT, WE WILL NEVER SEE"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"AGAIN AND WE WILL NEVER SEE ANYTHING CHANGE BEYONDTHAT WALL THAT IS THE SPEED OF LIGHT?Right. It basically means that when these sources reach a certain age and theycontinue to emit light or radiation, the photons that were emitted from themwere never able to reach us. We are still... For example, there are sources rightnow on the verge of becoming disconnected from us, causally disconnected.And these are sources that have the cosmological red shift which measures thedistance which is larger than 2. Now, these sources right now if they send asignal in our direction, the signal will never be able to reach us. And if we sendthem a signal, if there is an extraterrestrial civilization out there and we tried tocommunicate with it, we would never be able to do that because at this point intime they are already crossing this horizon. And the only reason we still seethem is that the radiation we see right now was emitted a long time ago. So, weare seeing them as they were a long time ago, but the radiation that is emittedright now in (real) time will never be able to reach us.ARE THOSE DISTANT OBJECTS THAT ARE ALREADY REACHINGTHE POINT WHERE WE WILL NEVER KNOW EXACTLY WHATHAPPENED BECAUSE THE LIGHT THAT GOES IN THAT FUTUREWE WILL NEVER RECEIVE. ARE THOSE AT THE EDGE OF OURUNIVERSE IN WHAT WE CALL QUASAR TERRITORY?Yes, some of them are quasars. Some are galaxies. They have to be above acosmological red shift of 2. So all the sources that have a cosmological red shiftof 2, of more than 2, they are at this point in time disconnected from us. So, ifthey emit right now a signal, we would never see it. The signals that we do seeright now were emitted a long time ago.HOW FAR DO THESE OBJECTS HAVE TO BE AWAY TO HAVE THATRED SHIFT FACTOR OF 2?They are very close to being 14 billion light years away. They are very close tothat, about 13 billion light years. The way we measure distances in cosmology isby the red shift factor. And the universe is expanding, so the farther an object isaway from us, the faster it is receding away from us. And so because of theDoppler Effect, if such an object is emitting photons, the wavelength of thesephotons will be stretched by the Doppler Effect. We will see it to be muchlonger than the emission by the source. And so, the higher the red shift is, themore distant source is because the recession velocity corresponds to the redshift.HOW LONG WOULD IT BE INTO THE FUTURE UNTIL THE SKY ONTHE EARTH, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD HAVE LESS STARS IN ITBECAUSE OF THIS ACCELERATION OF THE UNIVERSE AWAYFROM US?What we know about right now is that if the parameters of the universe remainfixed as they are right now, that the vacuum does not decay, then the universewill accelerate forever. And we live in a special time in the sense that we canstill see a large portion of the history of the universe. But if you wait 50 billionyears or so, then we wouldn't see much of the rest of the universe and we wouldbe forced to focus on problems closer to home.But if we exist as a civilization 50 billion years from now, we would have noidea there was a Big Bang, for example, because the cosmic backgroundradiation would be extremely faint by then.OUR SUN IS SUPPOSED TO DIE OUT IN A RED GIANT EXPLOSIONIN ABOUT 5 BILLION MORE YEARS.Yes, the sun will also die out, but there are lower mass stars that will prevail atthat time. And also new stars are being born all the time, so the sky would notbe completely dark. In fact, it's not only our galaxy that would remain attachedto us, the Milky Way galaxy, but also a few galaxies in the local group, such asAndromeda galaxy which is bound to the Milky Way galaxy. And also somegalaxies in the Virgo cluster. So the sky would not be completely dark. It's justthat all these other galaxies that participate in the cosmic expansion will"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"disappear out of sight. And their images will be frozen. So we would have afinite amount of information that we could collect about them.THAT MOMENT FROZEN IN TIME, WE WOULD BE LOOKINGTHROUGH TELESCOPES AT LARGELY A BLACK UNIVERSE WITHA FEW DOTS OF GALAXIES HERE AND THERE?That's right.AS THIS SOLAR SYSTEM AND THIS GALAXY PROGRESS IN THEFUTURE OVER TIME AND THERE IS MORE AND MORERECESSION OF THE REST OF THE MATTER IN THE UNIVERSE ASTHE DARK ENERGY CONTINUES TO ACCELERATE ALL MATTERAWAY FROM EACH OTHER...Right.WHAT CONSEQUENCES THEORETICALLY MIGHT THATDISAPPEARANCE OF OTHER GALAXIES AND QUASARS BEYONDTHAT FROZEN IN TIME MOMENT AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT HAVEON OUR GALAXY?It would be the sort of lonely corner of the universe. We would be embedded ina big void. We wouldn't be able to see anything coming in our direction from thedistant universe. There would be no radiation, no background radiation.NO STARS IN THE NIGHT SKY?There would be stars associated with the Milky Way galaxy and the local groupof galaxies. By the way, our galaxy by that time would probably merge withAndromeda galaxy and instead of being a disk galaxy it will become an ellipticalgalaxy because of this merger. But you would be able to see all these stars,especially with the naked eye or an amateur astronomer's telescope, you wouldbe able to still see the stars associated with this merger remnant of the MilkyWay galaxy. But you wouldn't see much beyond that and a few more galaxiesassociated with the Virgo cluster. If you were to use a big telescope likeprofessional astronomers use, it wouldn't be very useful because there wouldn'tbe any source to look at at that time. In some ways, we would have an enormousvoid around us, the void of matter because all these galaxies that were in thatvoid were pulled away from us and are pulled exponentially with time. So, theyare accelerating quite fast.HOW DO WE KNOW RIGHT NOW THAT THERE ARE ANY STARSOR QUASARS AT 12 TO 14 BILLION LIGHT YEARS? WHYCOULDN'T THAT BE AN ILLUSION OF THINGS FROZEN IN TIME?This light was emitted a long time ago, so all we can tell is that these sourceshad specific properties at that time when the light was emitted. We can't sayanything about the stars are like right now.THAT'S WHAT I MEANT. MAYBE THEY ARE ALL GONE AND WEARE STILL SEEING AND MEASURING AN ILLUSION.That's quite possible. The only way to find out is to wait and see what happensin the future. The light is on its way to reach us, but as I mentioned before, someof the galaxies are so far from us that they are already causally disconnectedfrom us.THEY ARE ALREADY DISAPPEARING.Exactly. These predictions are true if indeed the universe is accelerating the waywe believe it is.And future generations would have to believe us about what happened in theuniverse earlier on in terms of the Big Bang and so forth. They would not beable to test it for themselves, to look at empirical data. They would have to relyon records that we leave for them.ESSENTIALLY WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT IF ALL YOURTHEORIES ARE CORRECT IS THAT THIS ACCELERATION ANDEXPANSION BECAUSE OF DARK ENERGY MEANS THAT THERE"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"WILL COME A POINT WHEN NO CONSCIOUS INTELLIGENCE INTHIS UNIVERSE CAN SEE EITHER THE BEGINNING OR END OFTHE UNIVERSE?Yes. If the universe will accelerate forever, it may well be at some point in thefar future, the vacuum will decay, the cosmological constant will disappear andthe acceleration will be replaced by a deceleration. And then at some point, wewill start to see these things that escaped from us re-enter back into our horizon.It's possible in principle. But if the universe continues to accelerate the way it isdoing right now, what you said is exactly right.THAT YOU HAVE THE LARGEST PART OF THE UNIVERSE, DARKENERGY AND DARK MATTER, THAT STILL ARE UNDETERMINEDABOUT WHAT THEY ARE AND EXACTLY WHAT THEIR DESTINYWILL BE?That's correct. And it's quite humbling to me as an astronomer to confess that westill don't know what most of the universe is made of despite decades of studies.The conclusion that we reach is that the universe is dominated by some form ofmatter and by some form of vacuum energy that we have no understanding of.\"Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
