August 11, 2001 Wichita, Kansas - Sales executive Paul Corn was celebratinghis nephew's pending marriage with a backyard pool party around 4:30 p.m. onFriday, August 3. The nephew's fiancee was floating on her back in the waterwhen she called out, \"Look. There's something spinning down out of the sky.\"Everyone watched in amazement as first one pale object and then anotherslowly spiraled down to the yard. Warm to touch, the fragile objects were cornleaves. The group then realized that thousands of leaves were floating in an ovalpattern about a thousand feet up in the cloudless, blue sky.Paul Corn called the Wichita Eagle newspaper to see if other residents hadreported falling corn leaves. No one at the paper knew anything, but reporterBecky Tanner was sent to do a story. As she drove to Paul Corn's house, Beckysaw hundreds of corn leaves on the streets, lawns and houses. Reutersinternational news service picked up the story and called Weather Data Inc."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Meteorologist Chad Pettera said there had not been any unusual weather toexplain the phenomenon. \"It was a pretty large area where people reported (thefalling corn leaves.) I think it is very odd. In our area there has been no weatherto speak of, no high winds. It's just been very hot and dry.\" A National WeatherService meteorological technician, Holly Kreutzer, confirmed, \"There weren'tstrong winds. I don't see how (the leaves) could have gotten blown up in theair.\"Paul Corn holding some of the corn leavesthat fell from the sky into his Wichita, Kansas yardon August 2, 2001. Photograph © 2001 by Bryan Corn.Interview:Paul Corn, Sales Executive, Graphic Systems, Wichita, Kansas: \"At t hetime, when we saw the cloud and these first few starting to spiral down, we hadno idea what they were. We watched this for several minutes before one finallydropped on the house and the wind blew it off and we recognized it as a cornleaf. But we stood there in awe just watching this happen. I mean we were justpretty much dumbfounded. It's like nothing anyone had ever seen or evenimagined before.We could see that up there, but had no idea what they were, except there was alot of it. Then we could see there were thousands of these leaves!The leaveswere about 18 inches long, brown and kind of brittle. But there was just a cloudfloating up there in the air pretty calmly. I'm estimating up about 1,000 to 1,500feet vertically. And they would seem to get to a point and the air currentsseemed to change because it would reach this point and start tumbling down.They kind of covered a pretty wide area in the northeast part of Wichita.LIKE ABOUT HOW WIDE?Well, the newspaper later estimated it went between Center and 37th streetnorth, so that's probably about a 25 or 30 block area lengthwise and from thevarious reports about a mile wide. It was just a couple hundred feet above thehouse so we could see it. We had a fair number fall on top of the house and inthe back and front yards. And the majority of them went over our property andfell blocks north of us.DID YOU PICK SOME UP TO SEE IF THEY WERE COLD OR HOT ORSOMETHING?Yes, we got them and went out into the neighborhood and picked up some more,but they were very dry and a warm temperature.DID YOU CALL THE POLICE OR FIRE DEPARTMENT?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"No, we called the newspaper and asked if anyone had reported it.WHAT DID THE NEWSPAPER SAY?They said, 'No,' they hadn't heard anything about it. Then they called back andhad checked and hadn't heard anything so they sent a reporter out. And we toldthem the story and the reporter said while she was driving up here to our housethat she had seen a pretty fair number of them out in the streets, yards andgutters. Two of my nephews did find a spot that they said there were probably acouple hundred lying there in a small area.WHAT HAS BEEN SO FAR THE OFFICIAL EXPLANATION OF WEATHERPEOPLE OR ANYBODY AROUND YOUR AREA?There have been four follow up stories in the newspaper since Saturday whenthis story ran and they have talked to county agents and meteorologists andobviously this is an agricultural area, at least it is around Wichita. And no onereally has any explanation. No one had ever actually heard of or seen anythinglike this before. But the best explanation was like a big whirlwind. There hadnot been a tornado in the area, so that wasn't a cause of it. But they werespeculating it could have been a whirlwind.WHY WOULD THERE BE THOUSANDS OF CORN LEAVES ON FRIDAY?Well, there isn't any real explainable reason for that except the corn harvestsouth of us and around us, I understand, is finished. And the corn plants are leftstanding in the field and they just dry up and eventually - I'm not a farmer - theyeventually plow under or chop them up for silage and it just hasn't been done.There's probably just a lot of leaves laying around after harvest on the ground.BUT NOBODY SO FAR HAS ANY REAL EXPLANATION AND I KNOWONE OF THE WEATHER DATA METEOROLOGISTS, CHAD PETERRA,WAS QUOTED IN AN ARTICLE BY REUTERS THAT IT WAS VERY ODDAND SAID THERE WAS NO UNUSUAL WEATHER TO EXPLAINANYTHING LIKE FALLING CORN LEAVES OUT OF THE SKY.Exactly. The leaves were about 18 inches long, about the same length and theywere dry and curled. I guess that once they hit a draft that didn't hold them up,that's why they were spiraling down because of the way they were shaped.AND HOW IN THE WORLD DID ALL OF THEM GET UP THERE?(laughs) There has been a lot of discussion in the paper with people who shouldknow some of this, like meteorologists and county extension agents and thattype of agriculture people who aren't sure.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
