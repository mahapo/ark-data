Spacecraft altitude: 370.13 kilometers.Longitude of image center: 284.38 degrees West;Latitude of image center: 82.02 degrees South.Image by Malin Space Science Systems.April 8, 2001 Washington, D. C. - NASA successfully launched its Odysseyprobe to Mars on Saturday, April 7. The spacecraft is expected to reach the redplanet on October 24th after a 286 million mile trip. After aerobraking to getinto a lower orbit, instruments aboard will be able to analyze surface rockchemistry and take images in both color and infra red. One place that would bevery interesting to visit again is the South Pole where the Mars Orbital Camera(MOC) took the 1999 photograph above that provoked writer Arthur C. Clarke(2001 and 2010) to question if the images were biological and not geological.I asked Dr. James Zimbelman, Planetary Geologist and Mars specialist at theNational Air and Space Museum, Smithsosonian, Washington, D. C, to look atMOC image 08-04688 on the internet and talk with me about it by phone."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Interview:DR. ZIMBELMAN, DO YOU HAVE THE MO8-04688 UP ON YOURCOMPUTER?I do, and it's unlike anything I've seen on any of the other MOC images.WHAT ARTHUR C. CLARKE ALSO SAID AND THE QUESTION IS:WHAT IS IT?I can guess because it's such a high polar latitude and around the funny darksplotches with the little light lines in them are some smaller dark streakspointing in a particular direction. To me, this looks like it's defrosting. The lightareas have a frost covering and the funny black splotches are where that frost isgoing away. That's my best guess.THIS IS LIKE A FRACTAL PATTERN THAT WE WOULD ASSOCIATEWITH - WELL, IT'S A LITTLE LIKE LOOKING DOWN ON PALMTREES.On something very bizarre, yes. Fractal is probably the right way to describe it,but my guess is just from the fact that they are different sizes that it's an area ofgrowing defrosting. More and more of the surrounding brighter surface is losingits frost and turning into this funny appearance.IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY SINCE THIS COMES UP A LOT THATTHERE COULD BE ANYTHING OF A FUNGUS NATURE THAT WEMIGHT NOT KNOW ABOUT THAT COULD BE GROWING ON MARSAND COULD PRODUCE PATTERNS LIKE THIS?I seriously doubt it at this scale. The whole image is almost 3 kilometers wideand fungus just don't make patches like that. Even if they might look like thatsort of a hand specimen size, you don't get patches of fungi hundreds of metersto kilometers across.THAT'S HOW BIG EACH OF THESE CLUSTERS WOULD BE?Yeah. I looked up some of the information about the picture. If you keptenlarging this to the place that you would see the individual picture elementsand each of these funny fractal spots, whatever they are, are hundreds of thesepixels. Then each of those spots is 5.5 meters on the surface of Mars.THE PIXEL?Each pixel is 5.5 meters, yes. So one of those funny spots is many hundreds ofmeters across.THESE ARE VERY LARGE AND THEY DO SEEM TO HAVE A3-DIMENSIONAL QUALITY TO THEM. WOULD YOU AGREE?The appearance of it. I suspect that they don't have all that much relief, but thelights and darks you are seeing give the appearance of topography and that's justa brightness difference. If I'm right about this being defrosting, the groundunderneath is just a lot different brightness than the frost. In the processedpicture, it just turns out that way in the funny pattern.DOES THIS MEAN THAT THERE IS SOME KIND OF FOCUSED HEATCOMING UP FROM UNDERGROUND?No. There have been other places in the MOC images and in Viking as well thatjust because of very slight irregularities in differences in the ground, the frost iseither thicker or thinner in some spots. And so it sort of randomly starts indifferent places.COULD YOU SUGGEST A REASON FOR WHY IT WOULD HAVETHIS ALMOST PLANT-LIKE PATTERN TO IT?I have no reason to give you as to why it has that. It's just one possibility thatthey are all radially consistent in the sense that the little light and dark linesextend radially away from the center and that would be consistent with agrowing spot. That is, the spot gets larger as more and more frost disappears. So,whatever that linear pattern is a result of, it just keeps growing as the spot grows."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"And in the middle of the frame, it's like all the frost is gone and you've got thisaccumulated mess of what I think used to be a collection of these little spots.And it's just all grown to defrost to give you that funny pattern. It's a little bitpast the beginning of spring in the Southern Hemisphere, so you would have theaccumulated frost from all the winter going away. So, if I'm reading this right,this is sort of mid southern spring and at a high enough latitude that the frost isjust going away as the sun is getting higher.THIS WOULD BE A FREAKY LOOKING STRANGE KIND OFDEFROSTING ON MARS?Yes, that's my best guess. I would not at all attribute it to biology.LOOKING AT PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN FROM A SATELLITEORBITING MARS, DETAILS CAN LOOK LIKE 3-DIMENSIONAL,EITHER RISING UP FROM THE PHOTO OR GOING DEEP DOWN,OR IN THIS CASE, THE FRACTAL SHAPES SEEM TO HAVE A3-DIMENSIONAL TOPOGRAPHY THE WAY WE WOULD THINK OFPALM TREES. COULD YOU DISCUSS THE DIFFICULTY INASSESSING WHETHER SOMETHING IS LEVEL, DEEP OR HIGH INTERMS OF ALBEDO REFLECTION?It is a difficult problem. And looking at the information for this particular frame- the solar incidence angle is 79 degrees. What that mean is that sunlight wascoming in at only 11 degrees above the horizon, a very shallow angle. And Ithink because of that, that tends to exaggerate topography so that you have thisvery shallow illumination and even a very subtle feature casts a long shadow oris illuminated at its top very brightly even if it's a very subtle feature. And so thatis part of the problem. But that's also consistent with this possibly beingdefrosting because that would respond quickly like that to a shallowillumination. As the sun got higher and higher, this stuff would disappear fasterand faster. After awhile, you might not necessarily produce the patterns.AS SOMETHING DEFROSTS IN THE SOIL, DOES THE SOIL TENDTO EXPAND UP A LITTLE BIT WHERE IT IS DEFROSTING?It's possible, but that has less to do with the lack of the frost than whether or notthere is water in the soil. I wouldn't have any clue as to whether these picturesindicate that.MEANING WATER ITSELF AS WE KNOW IT MELTING ANDCREATING THESE PATTERNS?The difference between freezing and thawing can give you relief, yes. I wouldnot guess that just because I don't think the conditions are right to melt waterthere. In fact, I think it's a very good chance that this is carbon dioxide frost, butI'm not completely sure about that.IF THIS IS CARBON DIOXIDE FROST, DO WE HAVE ANY EARTHRESEARCH THAT WOULD SHOW WHAT CO2 OVER A WIDE AREAWOULD LOOK LIKE?No, because we on earth don't get carbon dioxide frosts. It never gets coldenough to do that and we don't have enough carbon dioxide at the rightconditions in the atmosphere to produce a CO2 frost. And with a Martianatmosphere mostly carbon dioxide, it does get cold enough to literally freeze outthat part of the atmosphere.\"We b s it e s :http://www.msss.com/moc_gallery/m07_m12/images/M08/M0804688.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Republication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
