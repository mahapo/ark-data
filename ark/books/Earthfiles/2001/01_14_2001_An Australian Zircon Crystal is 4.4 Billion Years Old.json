Peck.January 14, 2001 Madison, Wisconsin - Another surprising find on earth isrevolutionizing thinking about what the earth was like at its beginning. For thepast fifteen years, geologists have been studying very ancient rock outcroppingsin the Australian outback at a place called Jack Hills several hundred kilometersnortheast of Perth.Aerial of Jack Hills in western Australia outback northeast of Perth,an ancient crust known as archean craton in which rocks are older than 2.6 billion years."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Photograph © by Simon A. Wilde.Archean craton rock outcrop in which the zircon crystal had been collected in 1984 andlater datedby uranium and lead isotope analysis to be 4.4 billion years old, a \"Rosetta Stone\" of earlyearth history.Photograph © by Simon A. Wilde.This week in the journal, Nature, a team of scientists announced that a smallzircon crystal collected from Jack Hills dates back to 4.4 billion years. Thescientists used uranium and lead isotopes to determine that age. The earth is 4.5billion years old. That means the zircon was created only about 100 to 150million years after the earth started congealing into a planet from a ball of gasand dust. But that's also when scientists have long assumed the earth wascovered with hot lava, not crustal rocks forming zircon crystals.The zircon crystal also implies the earth was cool and had water where thezircon crystal formed. The lead investigator is Dr. John Valley, Professor ofGeology at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Until now, the oldest rocksever found were 4.3 billion. I asked him what his reaction is to the 4.4 billionyears age.Interview:John Valley, Ph.D., Professor of Geology, Dept. of Geology andGeophysics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin: \"I was blownaway twice by this sample. I was first very surprised by the age because we werehoping to recreate the age of 4.3 billion which has been found several times -first by Compston and Pigeon in 1986 from these samples. We weren't expectingto find an earlier sample because our prejudice said that the earliest part of theearth was so violent that no samples would be preserved.Now, we realize that is not correct. I suspect there are many of these 4.4 billionyear old crystals still to be found in the Jack Hills rocks of Australia. Thesecond most surprising thing which was perhaps the biggest surprise from thissample was when we measured the oxygen isotope ratio in Edinborough. Wewere doing this in 24 hour shifts around the clock and it slowly dawned on usthat we were seeing an abnormally high ratio of oxygen 18 to 16. And measuringoxygen isotope ratios in zircons is something that my group at the Univ. ofWisconsin have been doing for 6 or 8 years and we have a lot of experience withwhat to expect. When we turned up these high ratios, it forced us to reevaluatewhat we thought were the conditions. These high ratios are very common in themore modern earth. We find them in the last 2 billion years quite frequently. Butwe have never seen them in rocks older than 2 billion years. So, to find them insomething 4.4 billion years old was just a tremendous surprise and very exciting.THIS PARTICULAR OXYGEN RATIO MEANS WHAT TO YOU?The high ratio is indicative of processes that operate on the surface of the earth.So we're seeing surface processes. The rocks that experienced that were then"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"buried, they were melted. The melts then crystallized the zircons we have, so wehave this chemical signature that tells us about an early earth that wascomparatively cool, a relatively benign climate much like the climate we seetoday in several respects, and not at all like the fiery place that many of us hadthought. And so it's the oxygen isotopes that tell us about the presence of water.We are seeing the recycling of these surface materials, possibly even like soils orthings that have interacted with hot water and this tells us that the early earthwas very different from what we had originally thought. However thoseprocesses occurred, the earth had cooled off by 4.4 billion years, which is onlyabout 150 million years after it formed. That's pretty quick.WHY DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE SO DIFFERENT AFTER THESEMANY YEARS OF ASSUMING THAT THE EARTH HAD A MOLTENLIFE FOR A VERY LONG TIME. WHAT PROCESS WOULD HAVEGONE ON IN THE CREATION OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM THATWOULD HAVE HAD THE EARTH WITH A SURFACE THAT MIGHTEVEN HAVE HAD WATER AND WAS COOL AND LIKE TODAY'S,ONLY 50 TO 150 MILLION YEARS AFTER ITS BIRTH?Well, one of the things we're learning more about now are the timing of thesemajor impacts. In just the last year, it's been learned there was a major impactevent at 3.9 billion years and that a lot of the craters we can see on the moonwith a pair of field glasses, a lot of those big craters formed all at the same timein one event. And what this brings to fore is that even though the early earth wasa period of extreme and intense bombardment by meteorites and asteroids, therewere periods of relative quiescence between the big events. Just as life wasalmost wiped out 65 million years ago, what many people think was the eventthat killed the dinosaurs, and yet it seems very quiet now.So, it's quite likely that what we're looking at is a sample that represents theconditions between major impacts. Of course, one of the questions that alwayscomes up when we talk about liquid water is might there have been biologicalprocesses? And the essential conditions for the evolution of life is that you haveenergy, that you have organic molecules and you have liquid water. We'vealways known there was energy and organic molecules throughout earth'shistory, but it was always believed there was no liquid water for the first half abillion years, first 500 million years. Now, we know that happened and lifecould have evolved.THAT THERE WAS WATER BACK THAT FAR.Now, that we know there was water at 4.4 billion, it's possible that life couldhave evolved. We're not saying that it did. We have no direct evidence of that,but all the ingredients that we know about existed. If life evolved at 4.4, italmost certainly would have been extinguished by some of these major events.It's possible that life evolved more than once and was extinguished more thanonce and that the beings on the surface of the earth today are descendants ofonly the last and finally successful evolution of life.IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THIS 3RD PLANET FROM THE SUN COOLED"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"DOWN MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN SCIENTISTS USED TOTHINK WAS POSSIBLE?I think the evidence is that it did cool. There are many scientists who thought itwas possible to cool the earth off quickly, but the issue was: did it or not? Andwhat we have now is the first little glimpse of data that suggests that yeah, it did.MARS SUPPOSEDLY HAD A VERY WATERY SURFACE GOINGBACK AT LEAST THAT FAR AS WELL?We could spend a whole other period talking about Mars. Yes, there is verystrong evidence that Mars had a wet, warmer atmosphere at exactly the sametime we're talking about. The evidence from Martian meteorites suggest therewere oceans at 4.4 billion years on Mars as well.IT USED TO BE YOU HEARD A LOT OF TALK ABOUT THENECESSITY OF HAVING COMETS COMING THROUGH THE SOLARSYSTEM - THOSE BIG, ICY SNOWBALLS - AND SLAMMING INTOTHE EARTH IN ORDER TO PRODUCE ALL OF THE WATER ONTHIS WATERY BLUE BALL.Well, that certainly is a possibility. One of the things we don't have very perfectinformation on is how much water has been lost from the surface of the earth bydifferent processes. There is definitely a comet contribution.BUT COULD THE EARTH FROM THE BEGINNING FROM DUSTAND GAS ALONE EVER HAVE PRODUCED THIS MUCH WATERJUST FROM THE CREATION OF ITS PLANETARY BODY?This is a question of what the temperature of the earth was when it formed. Butyes, there is a large amount of ice that forms all of the planets as water ice. Andthen there is water that is chemically part of the minerals that formed in lowertemperatures to make the planet. So, yes, there could have been a very largeinventory of water right from the start.THEN WHY ARE WE SO FAR THE ONLY PLANET IN THIS SOLARSYSTEM THAT HAS ALL OF THESE VAST OCEANS?One thing you have to remember is the distance from the earth to the sun. And ifthe earth were moved about 20% towards the sun, we would then have anatmosphere and conditions more like Venus. And our surface would be heatedby the sun and our oceans would boil and so all of the oceans would be steam.We would have 100 atmospheres of atmospheric pressure and it would all besteam. Conversely, if we move the earth out and away from the sun into an orbitlike Mars's, then the surface would freeze. So, what the earth has going for itthat makes it unique in the solar system is its distance to the sun.\"Moon and earth.Moon's Creation: When and How?\"The most commonly held view has been that a series of very violent events tookplace during the first 500 million years of the earth's history and that the resultof these violet events was that the surface of the earth was melted most of thetime, forming oceans of molten rock - magma oceans. And the nature of thoseevents are:1) a major asteroid impact that would have formed the moon.2) The differentiation of metallic iron formed the core of the earth.Both of these would have caused widespread melting. What our results show isthat however those processes occurred, the earth had cooled off by 4.4 billionyears, which is only about 150 million years after it formed. That's pretty quick."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"IF IT HAD A COOLER, WATERY SURFACE WHICH THE ZIRCONCRYSTAL SEEMS TO BE IMPLYING, THEN WHAT I THINK I'MHEARING YOU SAY IS THAT IF THERE WERE VIOLENT IMPACTSLIKE A COMET OR ASTEROID HITTING THE EARTH ANDPOSSIBLY EVEN KNOCKING SOME OF THE EARLY EARTH OFF TOBECOME THE MOON, THAT IT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED WITHINTHE FIRST 500 MILLION YEARS OF THIS PLANET'S EXISTENCE?Even shorter than that. There were only 150 million years before our samplewas formed and so those events probably happened about 50 million years afterthe formation of the earth.Or, it is alternatively possible that our understanding of those processes isincomplete and that they actually happened differently. There is a hypothesisthat the moon was captured rather than being formed by impact. If the moonformed by capture, then the melting resulting from that impact never occurredbecause the impact never occurred. So that removes a great problem of thepresent data set: how do you cool the earth off so quickly?YOU'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THIS MATERIAL FOR A LONGTIME AND ONE OF THE BIG MYSTERIES HAS BEEN - WHAT IS THEORIGIN OF THE MOON? RIGHT NOW, FROM THE WORK YOUHAVE DONE AND PUSHING BACK THE DATE AT WHICH THESURFACE OF THE EARTH MIGHT HAVE BEEN COOL AND WATERYALL THE WAY BACK AS YOU SAID TO WITHIN 150 MILLIONYEARS OF THE BEGINNING OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM - WHAT DOYOU THINK IS THE ORIGIN OF THE MOON?I don't think the returns are in right now. I think this is going to be a matter ofconsiderable reevaluation and debate. There have been consistent proponents ofthe capture process.THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING COMING THROUGH THE SOLARSYSTEM AS LARGE AS OUR MOON OR THE SAME AS THE MOON,GETTING PAST JUPITER AND SOMEHOW BEING ATTRACTED TOOUR PLANET?I don't know where it came from. It could have been an asteroid in an orbit notthat different from the earth's. But it would be a distinct object within the solarsystem and then somehow became captured by the earth's gravitational field.This is certainly not an implausible process. The arguments against that modelhave been largely chemical in the past and our results are proposing a chemicalobjection, or something that needs to be explained by that model.YOUR CRYSTAL EVIDENCE SORT OF OPENS THE DOOR FOR NOTHAVING TO EXPLAIN THE MOON AS COMING FROM THE EARTHIN SOME KIND OF VIOLENT IMPACT BACK THAT FAR?I think that's right. If the moon was captured, then our sample doesn't provideany further restriction on how it formed. So, it might have been a little bityounger or older and that wouldn't effect what we see because there was nocataclysmic collision with the earth.BUT IF IT TURNED OUT THAT THE TRUTH WAS THAT THE MOONCAME FROM THE EARTH, THEN YOU'VE GOT THE PROBLEM OFTRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS OCCURRED IN THE FIRST 50TO 150 MILLION YEARS AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE SOLARSYSTEM AND OUR PLANET?Yes. We don't really know how big a problem that is. There are several variablesdepending on how you think about it. But, for instance, if the earth had a thickatmosphere like Venus, it would be insulated and it would be very difficult todissipate that energy. If alternatively, the earth's atmosphere had been blownaway by meteorite impacts, then the heat might be dissipated quite quickly.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund PolicyCopyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
