The other two cases are also the Ames strain which has been distributedover the past half century to many medical researchers to make anthrax vaccines.The 35-year-old woman is being treated with antibiotics. The FBI says there isno evidence to link the three anthrax cases to terrorists, but has now shifted itsinvestigation to a criminal probe. The consensus is that the anthrax bacteria havean \"unnatural source,\" which implies manipulation at least by someone withmalicious criminal intent, if not terrorists.American Media's Chief Executive, David Pecker, told CNN, \"I think this is anattack against America. The World Trade Center was attacked, the Pentagon wasattacked, and American Media was attacked, and I think this is the firstbioterrorism attack in the United States.\" His company publishes The Sun andNational Enquirer tabloids and the switchboard has received calls from readerswho are afraid to touch his newspapers for fear of anthrax contamination. Mr.Pecker explained there is no risk and that his newspapers are not printed in the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Florida editorial offices.Earlier today, Florida Department of Health spokesman, Frank Penela, said nomore traces of anthrax bacteria have been found beyond the computer keyboardused by Sun photo editor, Robert Stevens, who died Friday, October 5.October 8, 2001 Boca Raton, Florida - For the first time since the mid-1970s,two cases of \"inhalation anthrax\" caused by breathing in bacteria spores havebeen confirmed in two Florida men. First was 63-year-old Robert Stevens whodied Friday. He was a photo editor for The Sun, a tabloid newspaper publishedalong with the National Enquirer at American Media, Inc. in Lantana nearBoca Raton, Florida. Traces of anthrax were also found on the computerkeyboard used by Robert Stevens at his American Media office. His home wasclose to the air strip where September 11th hijacker, Mohammed Atta, rentedplanes.The second man who tested positive for exposure to anthrax is Ernesto Blanco,73 years old, who worked in the mail room at American Media.This secondanthrax case was confirmed after Ernesto Blanco was admitted to Cedars CenterHospital in Miami-Dade County last week and treated for pneumonia. He wenthome, but returned to the hospital. The fact that Blanco worked in the sameoffice building as Stevens caught the attention of investigators who werechecking intensive care units and morgues in southern Florida. So, they gave hima nasal swab test and it was positive for anthrax.Medical experts say that inhalation anthrax rarely occurs naturally. Morecommonly, humans contract anthrax bacteria from contaminated soils or animalsthrough skin cuts or in food or water. But with terrorism on everyone's mind,this afternoon I talked about these surprising cases with Dr. Donald Henderson,Professor of Medicine and Public Health, and Director of the Center for CivilianBiodefense Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.Donald A. Henderson, M. D., Professor of Medicine and Public Health,Johns Hopkins University and Director, Center for Civilian BiodefenseStudies, Baltimore, Maryland: \"We've got a strange phenomenon in a sense inthat we have an individual from whom anthrax has been isolated from his nose,nasal passages. He is ill, but the illness according to what I hear look at all likeanthrax.This is the second case?The second case. The first case died and certainly the clinical picture ofeverything I heard about there sounded very much like anthrax. I don't knowwhether an autopsy has been done, so I don't know what they have seen.This second case is very strange in that it's sort of like someone is carrying theorganism now. That information might be wrong in time, but at the momentdoesn't look like it. So, we have something that looks a little more ominous withthe second isolate. But on the other hand, it's such a strange phenomenon and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"secondly, we have now looked at the organism and it's a pretty commonordinary garden variety anthrax that we have out in the central plains whereanimals are infected. It's very sensitive to all antibiotics. It's not some weirdengineered bacterium at all. And one wonders at this point just WHERE thiscould possibly have come from or what might have happened.How it got there? How this particular strain got into one man's lung, intosomeone else's nose and on to a computer keyboard is what our mystery is atthis point in time. As I say, once we get a lot more in samples from around thatarea, we have a chance to look at each of those three strains and compare them are they the same? And I think we'll have more information as we look at thisparticular patient and get a little more sense is this an anthrax infection, or is hejust a carrier of it? And I'm not sure that given all of this that I'm at all sure justhow all this happened.If the man was breathing in anthrax in any amount, one would expect this wouldbe turning up in the lung. But it certainly does not seem to be. I think there are anumber of things yet that we need to wait to find out about before we're ready tojump to any conclusions.But he did go to the hospital with what they thought was pneumonia?That's right.Wouldn't that mean that whatever was found in the nose would be in thelungs as well?No, actually inhalation anthrax does not usually cause pneumonia. People thinkof this being anthrax pneumonia. In fact, it's a growth of the organism in thecenter of the chest outside the lungs. What happens is that the spore of anthraxgoes into the deep part of the lungs and is picked up by a white cell and migratesinto the center of the chest. And at some point, that spore begins to grow andgrows very rapidly and it produces poisons or toxins. And the individual mayfeel like he has pressure in his chest. He may have some trouble breathing, buthe does not normally have a pneumonia.The second man clearly had pneumonia by x-ray and clearly had somecomplications from the pneumonia. And the last I heard, the feeling was that itwas a different organism and not anthrax.Yet, he had a positive testing for anthrax in the mucous of his nose.That's correct.That's what is puzzling.That's right.The general audience is asking a question you can understand: Could thisbe related to the same terrorists that were planning to crash thoseairplanes into the buildings in New York and Washington, D. C.? Nobodyhas seen a case of human inhalation anthrax in the United states since the1970s.That's correct. The coincidence in time and place where these things havehappened is certainly something to be looked at with concern. But meanwhile,what has been done is that the building has been cordoned off so samples can betaken and they are being taken. The people who worked in the building havebeen started on antibiotics which is the proper course to take. Certainly, the FBI"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"is very active in this case as are people from the Center for Disease Control aswell as the local health department people who I have been told are very good.There is more evidence coming in yet. so I don't think we can make a judgmentat this point other than to say, 'Let's do everything we can to find out just howthis man got infected, two of them, got infected and how those anthrax sporeswound up on the keyboard.\"Bioterrorism?The FBI says so far it has not been able to link the two inhalation anthrax casesto any terrorist act. But Florida's Health Department is urging that all AmericanMedia employees who have worked in that building since August 1 report to thePalm Beach County Health Department in Del Ray Beach for testing. The healthdepartment is giving out an antibiotic that is effective in killing anthrax bacteria.The incubation period for anthrax from first inhalation to symptoms can be fromsix to forty-five days. Fortunately, it is not contagious from person to person.But these two cases underscore the importance of understanding and copingwith bioterrorist attacks in aerosols deliberately released from airplanes or othersprayers filled with biological weapons such as dry spoor anthrax or smallpoxviruses.I asked Dr. Henderson why some people argue that anthrax cannot bedistributed easily by spray planes or other mechanical spray devices.Dr. Henderson: \"It's just not all that easy to grow up the anthrax organism andto put it in the right kind of form and then to distribute it. I think they are right.This is true.On the other hand, let's recall that the people who flew the airplanes into theinternational trade center didn't make airplanes. I'm sure they didn't know howto make airplanes. They captured the airplanes. Could they go and buy anthraxspores? Well, there are a lot of countries, any number of countries, that have theability to make anthrax in the form that it could be used.That is back to Saddam Hussein in Iraq and Russian research prior to thechange from the Soviet Union?That is correct. We know for a fact that the Russians were turning out anthraxspores in tons and tons quantities. They even had an accident when one of theplants that was making anthrax in this form leaked from the plant. Somewherearound 100 people died as much as three miles away and it was just a minuteamount of these anthrax spores that escaped.The Iraqis had a very extensive operation producing anthrax. What we suspect isthat there are a number of other countries that have this capacity to produceanthrax in this form, including such as North Korea, Iran, Syria, Libya, so that itis not just Iraq and Russia. The point that people have been making is that itwould not be easy for you or I or even somebody with a fairly decent biologicalbackground to identify the right organism, to produce it, to put it in the rightform, to distribute it. But that's fine. I don't think they could."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Do we know in the United States where all of that anthrax researchproduct in Russia is today?No, we do not. Russia had fifty different laboratories where work was going onwith biological weapons. Some of those have been closed down. Some of themare ostensibly being used for domestic purposes now. There are at least four thatare under the Ministry of Defense and are still super secret laboratories. No oneis allowed into those laboratories except the people who work there.Could you please explain what the distribution problems are forbioterrorists to use planes to spray large geographic areas or targetsomething like a subway?The trick is to put out what we call an 'aerosol.' When you dust your roses, youhave a powder there. The organism that is used is about the same size as anthraxand it's a very fine powder and drifts out over the roses. There are various waysonce you have it in this powder form that it can be distributed. And what asknow - we talk about the crop dusters and people say, 'Well, it's very largeparticles and they don't normally spray with fine particles because it drifts away.'True. But you can change the adjustments on the aerosolizers. It's not difficult todo. Change a couple of nozzles. It's quite simple.We use aerosols for people who have asthma. they use inhalants. They inhaleand that's an aerosol and the reason it works pretty well is that it's in fineparticles and it goes right down into the lungs where they need it. So, there aremany ways to put out these fine spray and the technology is not thatcomplicated.If terrorists got a spray plane with the right dry, powdery anthrax sporesand distributed them over New York City, what is the worst case that couldhappen?There are several problems that have to be solved and you can't answer thatquestion easily. First of all, you've got a wind. And if the wind is very still, it'snot going to go anywhere. If the wind is too strong, it's going to blow it away. It'snot going to settle the way you'd like it to settle. If it's done with a brightsunshine, the sunshine itself may kill off the organisms.So ultraviolet light can kill an aerosol of anthrax?Ye s .Could it kill an aerosol of small pox?Yes, it could.Daytime distribution might not work, but night time would?Exactly.Smallpox rash that became infected and left pock scars.Photograph courtesy Center for Disease Control."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Small PoxSince we have a generation that has not been vaccinated against small poxand it's already been demonstrated that Osama bin Laden and the Talibanadvocate dying for their cause, all the terrorist cells would have to do isinfect some of their people with small pox here in this country and havethem walk around. Since it's highly contagious, that could spread thedisease throughout much of the unvaccinated population, couldn't it?Well, I think we need to put the small pox into perspective. I spent eleven yearsin the small pox eradication program, so I know small pox pretty well. Smallpox mainly spreads from an individual to people who are in close contact withthem; that is, within about 6 feet. And only after they get a rash. So, as we sawin country after country when we had outbreaks of small pox, the individualwould get this high fever at the beginning of this and it would go on for two orthree days and he would feel so miserable, he would usually go to bed. Andthen the rash would begin and at that point, he could begin to transmit infection.I think this is different from some other diseases we know. In measles, forexample, an individual who comes down with measles, gets sick with measles,may transmit the disease like one or two days before they have any symptoms atall. And often when they are walking around. but with small pox, you don't seethat.The patient gets very sick and usually takes his bed, so he is usually infectingonly household members or friends or family who come to visit him.Ring VaccinationsThat's why the public health focus on ring vaccinations?That's exactly right. Let us say you have a patient who is sick and has the rash.What you want to do is find out who has been in contact with him. And thenyou would immediately want to vaccinate those individuals and their householdcontacts.Small pox vaccine is quite unique in a way that many people don't realize. Smallpox vaccine will protect even if it is given two or three days after you have beenexposed. You may be exposed to an individual, may have even inhaled the virus,but if you are vaccinated within two to three days after that, you are stillprotected. With most vaccines, you have to be protected well before hand. Butthis is different. And even when it is given four to five days later, it has a majorinfluence in avoiding a fatal outcome.We could use ring vaccinations to help isolate an outbreak whether it wasterrorist-induced or some other contagion?Exactly. But what you do, you vaccinate the person who has been in contactwith the patient. You may be too late to have gotten to him (patient), but if youhave his whole family vaccinated, then there is nobody for the disease to spreadto and it dies out.If it were this simple, why would we have any concern about small pox oranthrax as a bioterrorist weapon?Well, let's take them one at a time because anthrax is not spread at all from"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"person to person. Small pox does, but anthrax does not.Now, this is where for most of the cases of small pox the individual who is ill isgoing to infect a comparatively small number of people. but there are somewhere we are going to have a bigger problem. And there is a very smallpercentage of cases of small pox that have a very severe form of the disease andthey spread it not by droplets from person to person, but goes up in a very finespray or mist into the air. Then it can spread over quite a distance. One outbreakwe had in the 1970s in Germany we had a patient who was isolated in a roomon the ground floor of a hospital and we had patients on the 2nd and 3rd floorsof the hospital that were infected, even though he never left that room.There are a few cases that are extremely dangerous who can spread the diseasemore than others and that can give you some difficulties in trying to control it.But the fact that the small pox is not going to spread like an uncontrolledwildfire or like influenza it's not going to go that fast. this is why we put a veryhigh premium on early detection and in getting vaccine out very quickly andthere is vaccine available on an emergency basis. This could be out in hours tothe place where it is needed.Has the bush Administration and Congress authorized an increase in thesupply of small pox vaccinations?Yes, they have, and that vaccine is going to be delivered. It will be awhile, it willbe some time next year before the first of those lots come off, but there are othersteps being taken to expand our vaccine supply.\"\"Nano Bombs\"The Bush Administration has authorized production of more smallpox vaccineswhich will increase U. S. supply in 2002. In addition to vaccines, there isanother discovery waiting in the wings which could neutralize the bioterrorismthreat by literally blowing up the germs, called \"nano bombs.\" Thedecontaminant is made up of microscopic droplets of oil layered with detergentand suspended in a watery solution. The oil drops are called \"nano bombs\"because they are smaller than anthrax bacteria or smallpox viruses. When thosetiny oil droplets come in contact with germs, they fuse to the surface of bacteriaand viruses. That causes the membrane surrounding the microbes to burst."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Dish on right contains bacteria. Left dish shows what happened to bacteria after treatmentwith nanoemulsion decontaminant developed by Dr. James Baker and NanoBio Corp.Photograph courtesy University of Michigan Center for Biologic Nanotechnology.I first reported in 1999 and 2000 about this breakthrough with its inventor, Dr.James Baker, at the University of Michigan. The last time I interviewed him, hewas getting ready to test his nano bomb solution for the U. S. Army. He alsotook his invention through the patent process and now has a company calledNanoBio Corporation affiliated with the university to produce and distributewhat could be a wonderful, non-toxic answer to bioterrorism. This week I talkedwith the Chief Executive Officer of NanoBio, Ted Annis.Ted Annis, Chief Executive Officer, NanoBio Corporation, Ann Arbor,Michigan: \"Dr. Baker's material took top honors and it was the only material,by the way, that was not toxic and not caustic or corrosive. You can actuallydrink this material. You can put it on your skin and you're OK.What was the Army's reaction to the fact that this oily water substancecould be so effective and non-toxic at the same time?They were very pleased and happy with this result. The part of the Dept. ofDefense known as DARPA which funded this research was extremely pleased.This was a DARPA success. They funded this research effort at the Univ. ofMichigan. Dr. Baker discovered or invented this material and it's regarded asquite a success. This material can be loosely described as a salad dressing thatkills anthrax. And people are skeptical when they hear that, including people inthe military, despite the military's own data.You would think that everybody would be enthusiastically embracing thisnow since Dr. Baker's last tests showed the oily substance could be sprayedon children, animals, plants and adults without harm, yet 'blow up' virusesand bacteria.Exactly. We are seeing some signs of interest from the Dept. of Defense and fromour government. We hope they embrace this enthusiastically. They haven't yet.Quite frankly, I'm expecting that to happen and I'm waiting for them to call andhave us go to Washington and sit down and talk about how we get this out intothe field and out into the population within 6 months.If the Army already knows it works in tests, why wouldn't your nano bombsolution be front and center for distribution in the U. S. right now in the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"face of bioterrorism?Very interesting question. I don't know. It isn't for lack of our talking to differentpeople in the Dept. of Defense. The only thing I can tell you at this point is thatthe only time table I had seen prior to Terrible Tuesday from the Army was atime table that would put this material, or some bio defense material, in thehands of the soldiers by 2006. Now, of course, after Terrible Tuesday this isclearly going to be accelerated.How do you accelerate the process if people are still not calling you toWashington, D. C.?That's a very good question. I only hope that we are called, that we go toWashington, that they listen to our requests for some emergency funding so wecan finish testing this material and get it through FDA and EPA registration andthen this can be available almost immediately.NanoBio Corporation is based on a patent that Dr. Baker filed after hisdiscovery?A little more complex than that. The NanoBio Corp. is a Univ. of Michiganspin-off and it was created to commercialize this technology because there aregreat applications from this technology from dealing with HIV to herpes tosanitizing surfaces to sanitizing skin, all of which would be either a product orend products you would normally buy from the store. And prior to TerribleTuesday, that was our mission: contacting the large consumer products andpharmaceutical companies in the world to let them know about this andsocializing the science with them. And that's what we were doing prior toTe r r i b l e Tu e sd a y.What is Dr. Baker's perspective on this product now in terms of immediateapplication in the event next week there was a bioterrorist attack withanthrax or small pox in an aerosol?Heaven forbid! but if there is an anthrax attack at this moment or within the nextcouple of weeks, there isn't a darn thing we can do because we cannot get thismaterial approved, manufactured and distributed that quickly.You wouldn't personally have any problems being sprayed with the nanobomb solution?No, as a matter of fact, I sent everybody in the company home with anassignment two nights ago. We have mocked up military decontamination kits,so we made military decontamination kits which basically consist of a small, flatpackage with a sponge in it impregnated with this material. And everyone'sassignment was to make sure it covered their entire body. There was enoughmaterial in the package to cover the entire body, so we all went and did that. So,we all washed down with a nano emulsion and there was enough to put it in ourhair when we were done. So, that's a wonderful example of how safe andcomfortable we are with it.Everybody in your company has washed down with this oily nano bombsubstance and everyone is fine?Yes, there wasn't a germ alive on my body when I got done.Because literally, these oily emulsions blow up viruses and bacteria oncontact?Yes, it is interesting how they work. They don't work like typical antibiotics orcomplex molecules. What they are essentially are these very small oil droplets"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"that fuse with the virus and bacteria. They fuse with them and by virtue of fusingwith them, they essentially blow open their membranes and that kills them. Andit's a very fast and effective process.Couldn't this also be applied to normal internal medicine in some otherway on flu bugs and other microbes?Interestingly enough, a follow on product that we've also been talking to thegovernment about is in fact a nasal spray that would act like a passive vaccinethat you would put this in your nose and these nano droplets would remain inwhat's called a mucosa for a period of time. And when you inhale a bad bug, itkills the bug on the way into your system. This particular use of the technologyhas shown great promise in a laboratory using mice and influenza.\"There are three categories of anthrax disease and none is infectious person-to-person:1) Cutaneous anthrax - bacteria or its spores (hibernating bacteria protected byhardened sheaths) naturally found in soil or on animals such as sheep get intocuts or scratches in skin and over two to six days spread into a pimple thatbecomes a blister that becomes a large, depressed black scab. The word anthraxis Greek for \"coal\" because of its blackness. With antibiotic treatment, cutaneousanthrax can be cured. Without treatment, the mortality rate can be 20%.2) Ingestion/gastrointestinal anthrax - bacteria form on spoiled, undercookedmeat which when eaten make people extremely ill and can cause death.Symptoms include nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, low energy and bloodydiarrhea. Antibiotics can help if treatment is early in the disease. But mortalityrates are high because early diagnosis is difficult. To date, no cases ofgastrointestinal anthrax have been reported in the U. S.3) Inhalation anthrax - dry anthrax spores can be breathed deep into the lungs.If enough - approximately 8,000 to 10,000 spores - are inhaled, the sporesgerminate into anthracis bacteria. First symptoms are like a flu with fever, drycough and chest pain anywhere from six to 45 days after exposure. The maturingbacteria produce lethal toxins that spread into the bloodstream and causesystemic shock and collapse of body systems resulting in death. Inhalationanthrax death rate exceeds 90%.More Facts about Anthrax from the Center for Disease Control:\"Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the spore-formingbacterium Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax most commonly occurs inhoofed mammals and can also infect humans.Symptoms of disease vary depending on how the disease wascontracted, but usually occur within 7 days after exposure. The"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"serious forms of human anthrax are inhalation anthrax, cutaneousanthrax, and intestinal anthrax.Initial symptoms of inhalation anthrax infection may resemble acommon cold. After several days, the symptoms may progress tosevere breathing problems and shock. Inhalation anthrax is oftenfatal.The intestinal disease form of anthrax may follow the consumption ofcontaminated food and is characterized by an acute inflammation ofthe intestinal tract. Initial signs of nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting,and fever are followed by abdominal pain, vomiting of blood, andsevere diarrhea.Direct person-to-person spread of anthrax is extremely unlikely, if itoccurs at all. Therefore, there is no need to immunize or treatcontacts of persons ill with anthrax, such as household contacts,friends, or coworkers, unless they also were also exposed to the samesource of infection.In persons exposed to anthrax, infection can be prevented withantibiotic treatment.Early antibiotic treatment of anthrax is essential - delay lessenschances for survival. Anthrax usually is susceptible to penicillin,doxycycline, and fluoroquinolones.An anthrax vaccine also can prevent infection. Vaccination againstanthrax is not recommended for the general public to prevent diseaseand is not available.\"http://www.nanobio.com/http://nano.med.umich.edu/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/Agent/Anthrax/Anthrax.aspCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":" Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
