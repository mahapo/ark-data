How high depends upon greenhouse gasbuild up, but the range will be between 2.5 and 10.5 degrees Fahrenheit. To putthat into perspective, if we go back to the last time the earth was 10 degreescooler than it is now, we have to go back at least ten thousand years to the endof the last Ice Age. So, it took 10,000 years for the earth to warm up 10 degreesF. since ice last covered North America, but may take only the next 100 years toheat up another 10 degrees.This past week in Geneva, Switzerland, the United Nations-sponsoredIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a serious warning.Many top world environmental scientists who have been studying theconsequences of warming temperatures, rising sea levels and shifting weatherpatterns now predict the following:More frequent and violent storms in LatinAmerica that will keep flooding low-lying areas.Declining rainfall and more drought in southern Europe will hurt farmersand food production.Deserts will spread in Asia while coastal monsoons will be stronger andcause more flooding.Drought will also cause deserts to spread in Africa. As rainfall lessens,food production will become even harder and electric power from damscould be threatened.European scientists are appealing to the U. S. government to join theinternational Kyoto Protocol effort to reduce industrial greenhouse emissions, areduction that so far neither the Clinton nor Bush Administrations have agreed"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"to.Over-fishing Oceans:Also this past week at the American Association for the Advancement ofScience meeting in San Francisco, Canadian marine biologist Daniel Paulywarned that commercial fisheries are depleting the world's oceans both downand up the food chain too rapidly from crabs and shrimp to sturgeon andhalibut. Dr. Pauly said the oceans are being treated like a strip mining operationin which everything is taken out with no planning or effort to replenish it.\"Through this policy, you render rebuilding depleted marine life impossible. Ifwe lose the invertebrates, what's next? If it's OK to move down the food web,what's the ultimate limit plankton? Is that what we want?\" Extinctions arethreatening many species, including the Beluga sturgeon and orange roughy fishwhich could be gone in ten years.Mt. Fuji, Japan Rumbling:There is an old Japanese proverb: \"Natural calamities strike about the time whenone forgets their terror.\" That proverb certainly seems relevant today as Japanesevolcano scientists finally have publicly confirmed that Mt. Fuji near Tokyocould erupt any day. Monitors have shown tremors around the mountain formonths, but government officials withheld the facts because they did not want toscare away the 2 1/2 million tourists who visit Fuji each year. The last time Mt.Fuji erupted was in 1707 and all of Tokyo was covered with ash. Today the cityis home to 11 million people who would all be affected if the volcano eruptswith the same force it did 300 years ago.Another Different CJD?And finally, in troubled earth news the top headline on the front page of today'sPhiladelphia Inquirer newspaper says: \"Routine symptoms, then a fatal medicalmystery. Doctors tested for viruses, bacteria and even the human form of madcow disease.\" The Philadelphia victim, Carrie Mahan, was only 29 years oldwhen she died a year ago in February 2000. She went from being a healthystudent working two jobs to nausea, fatigue, hallucinations, muscle tremors,coma and death within six weeks.When doctors examined her brain tissue, they found it full of holes like thosefound in spongiform encephalopathy diseases such as classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob(known since 1920 in Germany) and the new 1996 variant-CJD associated withmad cow disease in Europe. But what makes this story really spooky andbothers all the doctors and specialists who have tried to get to the bottom ofwhat caused all those brain holes is this. The young woman's brain tissue wassent to several laboratories including the U. S. national center at Case WesternReserve University which screens tissue samples for the misshapen proteinscalled prions that cause mad cow disease and both forms of known CJD disease.All the analyses were negative, even for the older form of CJD. That meanssomething else, maybe some other protein shape never seen before and notrecognized in any lab tests, is still lurking out there.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
