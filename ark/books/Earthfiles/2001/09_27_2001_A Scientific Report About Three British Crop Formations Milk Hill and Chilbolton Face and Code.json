At thetime, I interviewed British researcher, Paul Vigay, who compared the Chilboltoncode to the 1974 Arecibo, Puerto Rico radio telescope transmission created byCornell University astronomers to send a message about humans and the earthinto space.See: Earthfiles August 25, 2001.Upper left corner is Chilbolton Observatory, a British government-owned facility,was originally constructed in 1965 to study radio wave propagations from space andsatellites.The Observatory is off limits from the public. The wheat field that runs along its boundary,as shown in above photograph, is privately owned and operated by the Leckford Estate.The \"Face\" first appeared on August 14, followed by the \"Code\" on August 20, 2001.Aerial photograph © 2001 by Lucy Pringle.The week before the code appeared, people working at Chilbolton could seeanother dark area on August 14th in the wheat field. No one knew what it wasuntil aerial photographs were taken and there was a humanoid face. Only twodays before that, the enormous 787-foot-diameter six-armed formation of 409circles was discovered at Milk Hill on August 12."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"409-circle, 787-foot diameter formation discovered Sunday, August 12 after a night of rain.This wheat field is on the highest plateau of Milk Hill and the highest point in the county ofWiltshire, England. The field is not visible from any road and to get there, people mustwalk aboutfifteen minutes from the nearest place to park a car.

Levengood hisanalyses of plants and soil collected at the two Chilbolton patterns and MilkHill by Charles and Francis Mallett of Wiltshire, England.Milk Hill 409 Circle Formation Discovered August 12, 2001Nodes Lengthened and Expulsion CavitiesFirst, the Milk Hill formation of August 12th. Growth nodes werelengthened and had expulsion cavities. The cavities are small holes blownout of the stem nodes. Dr. Levengood has documented such expulsioncavities in other formation plants over the past several years. Hehypothesizes that cell water is heated by microwave energy in a \"spinningplasma vortex\" that interacts with crops to produce some - but not all -crop formations.Tiny expulsion cavities in crop formation nodes collectedfrom August 12, 2001 Milk Hill, England 409-circle formation.Magnification 40X.

C. Levengood.Dr. Levengood wrote in his report, \"These pronounced growth differences arenever observed under normal conditions. What we are observing here is thatseeds from the formation samples that show reduced seed weight are germinatingand growing at faster rates than seeds from the sample sets taken outside theformation. ...The enigma of lower seed weights and higher seedling vigor is dueto the fact that when the formation occurred, the seeds stopped development inthe presence of microwave energies. But the controls continued to fill out theendosperms during the following two week period before sampling.\"Dr. Levengood has frequently found increased growth rate from formation seedssince his investigations began in the early 1990s. He has demonstrated in his labthat controlled, short bursts of microwaves on cereal crops can produceaccelerated growth.Magnetic Iron Concentration Higher Than Normal SoilHe also found higher than normal deposits of magnetic material in the soilsampled from the Milk Hill formation compared to soil outside theformation. Dr. Levengood has seen such unusual concentrations ofmagnetic iron in other crop formations ranging in sites from Israel toEurope and the United States. The distribution of the magnetic particles isoften consistent with the \"physics of forces on magnetic particles"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"suspended within a rotating vortex system.\"The red arrow points to a magnetic iron particle in soil collected by dragging a magnetover the ground at the August 12, 2001 Milk Hill 409-circle formation.

Levengood.Milk Hill Summary:Dr. Levengood's bottom line assessment of the August 12, 2001 Milk Hillformation is that a spinning energy system involving microwave energiesinteracted with the wheat plants and caused biochemical and biophysicalchanges and a higher concentration of magnetic iron particles in the soil.Chilbolton Observatory \"Face\" Discovered August 14, 2001 and \"Code\"Discovered August 20, 2001Chilbolton SummaryDr. Levengood did not find any lengthened nodes, expulsion cavities, seedweight changes, increased growth rate or greater concentration of magneticiron in the soil of either Chilbolton formations.The absence of those findings might mean that the source of the Chilboltonformations was not the same as Milk Hill. Exactly which intelligences(human, non-human, other-dimensional) are behind the global cropformation phenomenon is unknown.We b s it e s :http://home.clara.net/lucypringlehttp://www.cropcircleconnector.com/c%26f/c%26f.htmlhttp://www.cropcircleresearch.com/http://invisiblecircle.de/http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expressly"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"prohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
