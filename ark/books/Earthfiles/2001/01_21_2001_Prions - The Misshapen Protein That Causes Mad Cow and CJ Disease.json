Photographs courtesy www.mad-cow.org.January 21, 2001 Europe - Mad cow disease once thought to be confined toEngland continues to be found in western Europe. This past week scientistsannounced the discovery of a diseased cow in Italy. The term \"mad cow\" comesfrom the shaking and stumbling of sick animals before they die. The scientificname is bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE, now thought to havespread by recycling meat and bone meal from infected animals back into cattlefeed. But even after strict measures were taken in England and other Europeancountries to eliminate infected cattle feed, mad cow disease cases have beenreported in several western European countries.Further, the human form of the disease known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob, or CJD,continues to be reported. Since medical experts are now convinced that CJD canbe transmitted from cows to people who eat meat products contaminated withthe mad cow disease infectant, the American Red Cross announced this weekthat it will ban blood donations from people who lived and traveled in Britain,France, Portugal or Ireland for six months or more between 1980 and 1996. InBritain, hundreds of cows and at least 80 people have died from the brain-wasting disease. Two people have also died in France and medical expertswonder if this is the tip of an iceberg of potential cases. Three Americans havealso died of CJD. All three victims hunted and ate deer and elk. In NorthAmerica, deer and elk are now associated with \"wasting disease\" that leads todementia and death similar to mad cow and CJ disease. Will cases keepincreasing because of a time lag between ingesting contaminated meat and whendisease emerges in people?The culprit in both the animal and human disease is called a prion. Prion standsfor proteinaceous infectious particles. More simply, prions start out as normalproteins that mysteriously change shape and then destroy brain tissue.This week I talked about prions with a medical researcher who is trying to findout how prions spread from cows to people. Dr. Jonathan Weissman, AssistantInvestigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and Associate Professor inthe Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology at the University ofCalifornia, San Francisco, said experts always thought there was a speciesbarrier that would protect people from animal diseases like the brain destroying"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"disease in sheep called \"scrapie.\" As far as scientists know, scrapie has notspread from sheep to people, but mad cow disease went from cows to humans.Interview:Jonathan Weissman, M. D., Assistant Investigator, Howard HughesMedical Institute and Associate Professor, Department of Cellular andMolecular Pharmacology, University of California, San Francisco (UCSF):\"The prion protein PrP-C, the non-infectious, the benign form, is in everymammal. It's in us. It's in cows. It's in sheep and other mammals. And in itsnormal form or shape, it causes no disease. But occasionally by a process thatwe only understand poorly, a prion protein will adopt a different shape. That initself wouldn't be such a problem. The problem is that this alternate shape, theprion form of the protein, is both toxic - that's why you get these diseases suchas mad cow disease - but even more remarkably, it can subvert the normalprotein in the body and change its shape so it makes more of the toxic form.That's why it is infectious. It kills the animal, but it also creates more of theinfectious form so it can then pass on to the next animal.On the left is the normal prion protein, PrP-C. On the right is the abnormal, misshapenPrP-SC.These diagrams are from Huang, Z., Prusiner, Stanley B. and Cohen, Fred E. from\"Structures of Prion Proteinsand Conformational Models for Prion Diseases in Prions,\" (ed. S.B. Prusiner) Berlin:Springer-Verlag, © 1996.HOW COULD PROTEIN WITHOUT DNA OR RNA MAKE ANOTHERPROTEIN CHANGE ITS SHAPE?Well, that's a very good question. Trying to understand the biophysical orstructural basis of this is a major topic of research. We really don't know thedetails.WHY DO THE PRIONS MAKE HOLES IN BRAIN TISSUE?That's another very good question. Why are these protein aggregates or alteredconfirmations toxic? And again, there was some work in laboratories here thatsuggested that it's a mechanism that interferes with the normal cell. But again,it's an area where we need to know more. It's not really clear why prions aretoxic.IN TERMS OF EXPOSURE IN ALL OF THESE PRESS STORIES FORTHE PAST HALF YEAR ABOUT THE SPREADING OF MAD COWDISEASE AND INCREASING NUMBERS OF THECREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE IN HUMANS IN EUROPE, WHENDID PEOPLE OR ANIMALS INGEST THIS PRION-CONTAMINATEDFEED OR MEAT? COULD IT HAVE BEEN 10 YEARS AGO ORWHENEVER AND THAT THERE IS SOME KIND OF LAG TIME"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"BETWEEN THE INGESTION OF THE PRIONS AND MANIFESTATIONOF THE DISEASE?Right. We know that there is a lag time between ingestion of the infectedmaterial and the disease taking place in people. And we know that when you goacross species, like from a cow to a person, that lag time can be quite long. Infact, before we knew these were prions, we called them 'slow viruses.'SLOW VIRUSES.Right. It was an old term. When people first saw them and knew they wereinfectious, they figured they must be some form of virus because they weren'tbacteria. We didn't know about prions. They called them slow viruses becausethey took so long to take place.Now, the real question is: What is the lag time? And the reason why this is soimportant is we have seen a few score cases, a hundred cases maybe in Europeof this prion variant called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that we are prettyconfident came from mad cow disease. The question is: Is this the tip of theiceberg? Or just a small number of very rare events?IN OTHER WORDS, IT MIGHT BE 100 CASES BY THE YEAR 2000.BUT IT MIGHT BE 10,000 CASES IN ANOTHER FIVE YEARS?Right, even if we stopped all exposure to people it's conceivable that many morepeople would get sick. Although that's not to say that's going to happen or thatit's likely. It's just that no one can say for certain whether that's the case.WHY IS IT THAT WE DON'T HEAR ABOUT PRIONS POSSIBLYBEING THE CAUSE OF SOMETHING LIKE ALZHEIMER'S DISEASEAS WELL SINCE THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME KIND OF DAMAGEAND DESTRUCTION OF BRAIN TISSUE IN ALZHEIMER'S ASTHERE IS IN THE SPONGIFORM?Right.COULD A PRION BE BENEATH THE MYSTERY OF ALZHEIMER'SAS WELL?Right. There is certainly a relationship at some level between prion disease andAlzheimer's or even Parkinson's disease. They all have these so-called proteinaggregates or misfolded proteins that seem to be intimately involved with theformation of disease. But there is fairly good evidence that Alzheimer's is notinfectious, that you can't pass it on from one person to another. So, if weunderstood better how mammalian prions are passed on, we might understandwhy Alzheimer's disease is not.But there is really no evidence that Alzheimer's, or the more common neuro-degenerative diseases such as Parkinson's, are infectious.THERE MAY BE A COMMON DENOMINATOR THAT IF WE KNEWTHE FACTS THAT PRIONS MIGHT BE AT THE BASE OF ALL THOSEDISEASES, BUT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT MAKES MAD COWDISEASE AND CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB INFECTIOUS, BUTPARKINSON'S AND ALZHEIMER'S SEEM TO BE MORE GENETIC?Right. You seem to only get Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease by some sort ofprocess sporadically in your cells and not due to any kind of exposure to theenvironment, which is fortunate.WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE MAD COW DISEASESPREADING AND THE RELATED CASES OF THECREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE TO IT?My specific research is on a similar phenomenon where you have inheritance orinfection based on changes in protein confirmation. We work in a very simplemodel organism: yeast. Actually baker's yeast, the same yeast used in beer andbread.It's made it possible to make very rapid process within our system. And one ofthe things we have looked at is to see if we have a species barrier like there is onthe mammalian side. And we found that is the case: different species of yeast"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"don't cross-infect each other. So, we're trying to use this system now tounderstand why you get a species barrier and how species barriers are overcome.CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT A LITTLE MORE CONCERNING THECOWS, SHEEP AND PEOPLE? WHERE ARE THERE SPECIESBARRIERS?OK, this again is talking in terms of my specific research. But typically it isharder to infect from one animal to a different type of animal. So, for example,Syrian hamsters aren't very good infecting mice and mice aren't very good atinfecting Syrian hamsters. And also, scrapie can go from one sheep to another,but because of the species barrier, as far as we can tell, has not passed on topeople.BUT ISN'T SCRAPIE A PRION DISEASE LIKE MAD COW DISEASE?Oh, it certainly is. It's a related disease. But scrapie is a disease in sheep and itdoesn't pass on to people. Or at least so far it doesn't seem to have causedCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease in people. And in fact, it was because of this speciesbarrier that was protecting people from getting scrapie, or getting CJD fromscrapie, that made the British government initially assured that people wouldn'tget mad cow disease. They felt, 'Well, people don't get prions from sheep. Sothere is a species barrier that protects us. And sheep are about as different fromus as cows are. So, we should be protected from getting mad cow disease.'WHAT HAPPENED THEN, BECAUSE THERE ARE DEFINITELYPEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN SICK AND DIED?Right and that's because these species barriers we have talked about are notabsolute. They can be overcome under some circumstances and understandingwhy and how you can overcome a species barrier is a critical question. I wouldhave guessed the consensus ten years ago would have been that the speciesbarrier should have protected man from being infected by cows. And now, it'sreally an important area of research to understand why this species barrier brokedown.DO YOU HAVE ANY EDUCATED SPECULATION ABOUT WHY THECOWS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INFECT PEOPLE THROUGH MEATAND BRAIN TISSUE?What we do know is that mad cow disease seems to be a different type of diseasethan the scrapie (in sheep). And so I don't think it's just that cows are moresimilar to people than sheep are. I think it's more that mad cow disease is adifferent type of prion, or maybe a different confirmation or shape of prion thatseems to be more readily passaged across the species barrier. There is somethingabout the shape of the prion in mad cow disease that allows it to pass across thespecies barrier.TO HUMANS.Yes, to humans.AMONG YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES AS YOU LOOK AT THECURRENT SCENE IN EUROPE IN WHICH THERE HAVE BEENCASES REPORTED COUNTRY BY COUNTRY SEEMINGLYINCREASING IN GEOGRAPHIC SPREAD OVER THE LAST SIX ORSEVEN MONTHS WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING ON?My guess is that a lot of this has to do with better reporting and people nowmore carefully looking for the disease. Whether there is a true increase, I don'tknow. But I do know that people are being much more vigilant about looking tosee if their cows are infected with mad cow disease. So, there was a sort ofcomplacency on the continent that it was England's problem and not theirs.IF THERE REALLY IS AN INCREASE, THAT THERE IS SOMETHINGTHAT IS SPREADING, WHAT WOULD YOU SPECULATE WAS ATWORK TO CAUSE THE SPREAD?That's really beyond by area of expertise and I'm not sure people know. But Ithink that is one of the frightening things about this continued existence of madcow disease in England and its presence in Europe is that it's now not entirelyclear how it's being passaged. Because they have taken very good measures in"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"England and they are starting to take measures in Europe as well. And onemight have guessed or hoped that would have been enough to prevent any newMad Cow from occurring. So, we don't really understand enough even abouthow it's passaged in cows to stop it completely.DO YOU THINK THEN THAT THE ONLY CERTAIN PROTECTIONWOULD BE TO GO TO A NON-MEAT DIET?Well, I think a non-meat diet is likely to be, to protect you. I think it's a prettysafe assumption that meat or some type of animal product has to be ingested toget infected. This is not something that is going to passage through the air. So,that's certainly one way of protecting yourself. Whether that's warranted is notclear to me.IT'S BEGINNING TO HAPPEN IN EUROPE VOLUNTARILY AS MOREAND MORE PEOPLE ARE CUTTING MEAT OUT OF THEIR DIETSAND THE BUTCHER SHOPS ARE FACING BANKRUPTCY.Yes, and it's understandable because there is uncertainty. It's not so much thatthere is real evidence that it's going to be a major health problem. It's very hardto be certain about anything in mad cow disease. In fact, it was sort of the unduecertainty in the early 1990s that lead to the problems starting in 1996.IN ENGLAND?In England. And I think there was some complacency. The science at the time,the best guess was that it should not have infected people. And that guess waswrong.MAD COW DISEASE DID INFECT PEOPLE.Yes. Well, there's very good evidence. There is pretty much consensus amongscientists and doctors that people have been infected with mad cow disease. Orhave a disease that is very similar to mad cow disease.But the more pertinent question is how long does it take for it to go from cowsto humans. And I think it's a safe bet that it's going to take longer than it took togo from one cow to another.ONCE IT IS IN THE HUMAN SYSTEM, EXACTLY HOW LONG DOESIT TAKE TO MANIFEST INTO THE PALSY AND BRAIN AND NERVEDISEASE AND DEATH?Again, that's a big question that we don't have a definitive answer to.ARE YOU PERSONALLY CONCERNED ABOUT PRIONS AND MADCOW DISEASE?Yes, I am concerned. I am concerned mostly because of the lack of certainty orthe lack of information because we don't know, we don't really know how theyare spread well enough. There is very good reason to believe that people can getMad Cow Disease. My guess and my hope is that it is a very rare event, but Idon't think we can be certain that that is the case.IF OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS, CASES KEPT INCREASING, ISTHERE ANY LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL IN TERMS OFMEDICAL RESEARCH AND HOW TO COPE WITH SOMETHINGTHAT IS NORMAL PROTEIN THAT CAN CHANGE SHAPE ANDTHEN BE DEADLY?There is certainly a lot of effort along this line. In fact, Stan Prusiner and FredCohen have started to get small molecules that at least in tissue culture in cellsgrown in isolation seem to be pretty good at preventing and even reversing thisspread of this altered confirmation. But I think we are a long way from having atherapy.What they have also made a lot of progress on is detecting the infectious form ofthe prion and I think the key, the immediate key, to containing prions is going tobe better detection. And that's where I think there is real progress."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"HOW DO YOU DETECT A PROTEIN THAT IS DIFFERENT FROMTHE OTHER PROTEINS?You have to deduce the fact that there are different physical properties. Forexample, it's much less susceptible to being destroyed by enzymes calledproteases. So, you can get rid of the non-infected form by breaking it up underconditions where the altered form won't be broken up. That way, you can detectonly the altered confirmation. The other thing is to hope to get antibodies thatrecognize only the pathogenic confirmation and not the non-pathogenic(proteins).But the problem that I alluded to is that of course everyone has PR proteins andit's chemically identical to the infectious form. You can't just look for the PRprotein. You have to make sure it's in the infected shape.THE MYSTERY REMAINS: WHAT IN THE WORLD IS IT THATCHANGES THE PROTEIN SHAPE IN THE FIRST PLACE?Right. How does it get started and how does it spread?IT'S EERIE, ISN'T IT, WHEN YOU GET INTO THE WORLD OFTHINGS LIKE VIRUSES AND BACTERIA AND NOW PRIONS THATARE PROTEIN OF WHICH WE ARE MADE. YET, A SIMPLE SHAPECHANGE CAN TURN IT INTO SOMETHING THAT IS SO LETHAL.Right. It's eerie and it was certainly unexpected.\"We b s it e s :http://www.thedoctorsdoctor.com/diseases/prions.htmhttp://www.mad-cow.org/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
