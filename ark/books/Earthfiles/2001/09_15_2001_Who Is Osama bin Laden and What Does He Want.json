Photograph from Middle East newspaper. September 15, 2001 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - The horror in New York,Washington and western Pennsylvania this week has not only changed thepsyche of our nation - it changed air travelers into potential enemies and airportsinto much less friendly territory. I know that from personal experience yesterdaymorning at the Philadelphia Airport. I was scheduled to fly to Dallas on a 9:17a.m. flight in order to attend a conference. But when my alarm went off at 5:30a.m., lightning and thunderbolts were dropping around the house like bombsand the hard rain turned the Pennsylvania Turnpike and I-476 to the airport intoa slow moving traffic jam. A trip that would normally take about 55 minutes,took 2 hours and 20 minutes.As I pulled up in front of the American terminal, a policeman immediatelystarted waving his arms toward me and shouting, \"Move that car! No cars areallowed here!\" I told him I knew I had to check in at the counter, but wanted toknow where to park given the new security restrictions. He motioned toward thenormal parking area several blocks away. Two American skycaps who hadshowed up without any work to do asked where I was headed. I told them andthey said the flight had been delayed so I had time to park and get my suitcase tothe airline counter. They also warned me that if I had any manicure scissors, penknife or anything with a sharp edge, I had better put that in my suitcase.Otherwise, it would be confiscated at baggage security. So, I unlocked mysuitcase on the sidewalk, took my manicure bag out of my carry-on and locked itback inside my hard suitcase.Then I drove off for the only parking lot I knew about. But it was blocked offwith a wall. There were no other instructions. I yelled to a passing car, \"Whereare we supposed to park?\" He pointed upward and as my eyes followed, I sawnew parking garage signs. The airport is undergoing expansion and everything ischanging. I found myself in a loop right back in front of the American Airlinesterminal. The policeman was outraged to see me. He yelled, \"I told you youcan't come here, not anywhere near here. Now move!\" I yelled back through my"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"open window, \"I'm not an enemy. I need guidance. Where do I park?\" As hemoved towards my car as if to physically push it, he yelled back, \"You park atArriving Flights.\" Park at arrivals? That's a first. And why didn't he tell me thatfirst time around?Again, I made the loop and finally found new parking still under construction,got my suitcase and started dragging it on a run toward ticketing, rememberingthe American attendant's words, \"The plane is delayed.\" But when I got to theticket counter, the agent said the plane had already left and the only optionswere standbys on sold out planes. So, I didn't get to Texas. Instead, I left thePhiladelphia Airport wondering if that first morning of getting airliners back intoAmerican skies again was only a taste of unfriendly police security to come?And a foreshadowing of protests that could inevitably arise as Americanexpectations of freedom and flexibility are curtailed?I also wondered how 19 Islamic fundamentalists, some with connections to thehead of the Al Qaeda worldwide terrorist group lead by Osama bin Laden, couldbe in the United States - some even learning how to fly airplanes in Florida -and not be under close scrutiny of the Federal Bureau of Investigation andCentral Intelligence Agency?In fact, one headline in today's Philadelphia Inquirer says, \"CIA reportedlywarned FBI about one suspect.\" The article from the Knight Ridder NewsService in Miami says the CIA, before the airliner attacks on the Pentagon andWorld Trade Center, told the FBI that Khalid al-Midhar was in the UnitedStates and was someone \"troubling enough to be on a watch list.\" Al-Midharwas one of the hijackers on American Airlines Flight 77 which hit the Pentagon.According to unnamed sources, the FBI did check out the information andconcluded that Al-Midhar had come into the U. S., but had left again. It's clearnow that Al-Midhar did not leave until his suicide bombing mission into thePentagon.The State Department and the Immigration and Naturalization Service which areresponsible for issuing and verifying visas on the passports of foreign nationalsdeclined to comment about the CIA warning to the FBI. Further, officialsfamiliar with intelligence matters say the CIA issued a secret report to seniorpolicy makers that Osama bin Laden was shifting his terrorist strategy fromattacking U. S. interests abroad to the U. S. mainland. Supposedly some of thoseCIA warnings were as recent as July. Now, Bin Laden is considered to be atleast one of the masterminds behind the insidiously evil and unimaginable use ofAmerican civilian airliners filled with people to attack American buildings filledwith civilians and military workers.A small section of New York's World Trade Center, fragile but still standing,after the two horrific airliner attacks the morning of September 11, 2001.The North and South Towers of the WTC both collapsedinto a pile of rubble 100 feet high.

One overall problem is competitioninstead of cooperation in the U. S. intelligence system. This problem wassummarized by an unnamed former Justice Department official: \"Not all of thelaw enforcement information systems are linked up and they don't all talk toeach other. You have to proactively call each agency and make sure they havethese names on these lists. It doesn't necessarily take the click of a button.\" Former State Department Counter-Terrorism Official CommentsOne former State Department official, Larry Johnson, who was Deputy Directorfor Anti-Terrorism Assistance Training, Aviation Security and Special Operationsin the U. S. State Department Office from 1989 to 1993, was interviewed for aFrontline program that was broadcast on September 12. His insights into Osamabin Laden and his connection to the Taliban leaders now in control ofAfghanistan include this revelation: \"When you step back and look over the last20 years at all the significant terrorist attacks against the United States in whichAmericans were killed or injured, roughly 72% (of those people harmed) arelinked to two individuals: Iranian Hezbollah security chief, Imad Mughniyah,and Osama bin Laden. ...The only one who's really been consistent with hisactions to kill Americans has been bin Laden, and those affiliated with him, overthe last eight or nine years. And when you realize you're dealing withindividuals who are willing to die and are willing to kill thousands of otherswithout any regard for the consequences, we have entered a new realm - they'veratcheted up their activity to a level that they want to make sure it succeeds, andwith the belief that in succeeding they're going to destroy the United States. ...Itis of a magnitude and a dimension that the world has not seen before. It is awake-up call for all the world. ...And if it is bin Laden's work, all he'sguaranteed himself out of this is not a victory in the Islamic world, butguaranteed the opposition of the rest of the world. And I don't care who you are.You cannot stand up against the world with that kind of pressure. ...He won abattle that will lead to his downfall.\" Who Is Osama bin Laden?Who is Osama bin Laden and what does he want? Here is a brief history. Osamabin Muhammad bin Awad bin Laden was born in 1957 in Ar-Riyadh, SaudiArabia where his father owns the construction company, Bin Laden Group.Osama bin Laden was the 17th of 52 children sired by Muhammad Bin Laden,considered Saudi Arabia's wealthiest construction magnate. At age 22 in 1979,Osama bin Laden graduated from King Abdul Aziz University in Jiddah, SaudiArabia with a degree in civil engineering. That December, he left Saudi Arabiato join the Afghan resistance known as the mujahedeen after the Soviet Unioninvaded Afghanistan."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Ar-Riyad, Saudi Arabia is the birth place of Osama bin Laden. Iraq, Iran,Afghanistan and Pakistan are neighboring countries.All five play pivotal roles in terrorist activities on the earth today.During the 1980s, Osama bin Laden was an aggressive fund raiser to provide themujahedeen freedom fighters whatever aid and military equipment he could. By1988, he established his now-famous organization, Al Qaeda (The Base), toprovide more military muscle and financing to the Afghan resistance. The nextyear in 1989 after the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan, bin Laden returned toSaudi Arabia a hero. There he worked for his father in the Bin Laden Group andbecame involved in political opposition to the Saudi monarchy. He also opposedSaudi alliance with the United States and was punished in April 1991 inconfinement at Jiddah, Saudi Arabia.That punishment for opposing Saudi alliance with the United States set binLaden on a series of moves that have continued to this day. First he traveled toAfghanistan. By October 1991, U. S. troops attacked Iraq's Saddam Hussein inthe Persian Gulf War under former President George Bush Sr. Afterward, the U.S. established a large permanent military presence in Saudi Arabia, a land thathas two of the most holy places in Islam tradition - Mecca and Medina. Thus,the American presence was a huge thorn in the side of not only Saddam Husseinin Iraq, but Osama bin Laden building his Al Qaeda terrorist organization inAfghanistan in the holy name of God to attack sin and evil in the world, namelythe United States and its allies. Ironically, bin Laden who fights \"in the name ofAllah\" has allegedly financed his terrorist efforts with drug-running money.Afghanistan in recent years has grown poppy crops that have produced morethan 70% of the world's heroin trade, including heroin sales in the UnitedStates.A year later in 1992, Osama bin Laden moved to Khartoum, Sudan which bythen was showing Islamic solidarity by allowing any Muslims into the country,those without a visa and hundreds of suspected terrorists and ex-mujahedeen.By then, the United States had produced an indictment against bin Laden forterrorist activities and was taking an aggressive stance to legally eradicate binLaden and his followers. What Does Osama bin Laden Want?In turn, bin Laden and his Al Qaeda members had begun to formulate theirgo al s:1) To join up with Iran's terrorist group Hezbollah and its security chief, ImadMughniyah, and other Shiite Muslim terrorist organizations against their enemy,the United States and its allies;"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"2) To attack U. S. military forces stationed on the Saudi peninsula, includingSaudi Arabia and Yemen;3) To attack U. S. forces stationed in the Horn of Africa, including Somalia.And attacks began. Many believe that bin Laden was linked to Ramzi Yousef,said to be the mastermind behind the first attack on the World Trade Center inFebruary 26, 1993. Yousef was believed to be financially linked to bin Ladenand his housing in Pakistan had been paid for by bin Laden. What Is the Taliban?The next year in 1994, members of the Mujaheedin the Afghani men who foughtagainst the Soviet invasion - raped three women. This enraged a religious teachernamed Mawlawi Mohammed Omar and he immediately organized his studentsinto a group to find and kill the Mujaheedin and his men who had raped thethree women. The Afghani word for students is \"taliban.\" Thus, Omar's Talibannow stands for \"God's students\" and Omar's mission is to return all ofAfghanistan to a pure, fundamentalist Islamic state.Osama bin Laden © 1996 by Reuters News Agency.Omar and his Taliban students of God, perhaps organized by Pakistan's militaryintelligence with Osama bin Laden's financial help, captured the Afghan capital,Kabul, in September 1996 and claimed the country as their own, imposing theTaliban's own interpretation of Islamic law. Note that date of the Taliban'stakeover of Kabul, September 1996, means that September 2001 was a 5thanniversary to celebrate in the attacks on New York and Washington.Omar's vision of that Islamic state means women are house-bound in service tomen; all girls schools have been banned; electronic equipment such astelevisions and radios are banned along with music in Kabul. Most internationalhuman rights organizations have condemned the Taliban's strict regime. But ithas been recognized by three governments: Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the ArabEmirates. CIA Authorized to Destroy Bin Laden's NetworkEarlier that spring because of terrorist attacks such as the truck bombing of theUS-operated Saudi National Guard training center in Riyadh that killed fiveAmericans and two Indians, President Bill Clinton signed a top secret order thatauthorized the CIA to use any and all means to destroy bin Laden's network.But that authorization did not prevent the June 25, 1996 large truck bomb thatblew up in the U. S. military residence of Khobar Towers in Dhahran. Nineteenservicemen were killed. The perpetrators were officially declared to be a SaudiShiite group, but U. S. investigators still think Osama bin Laden was involved."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"In August 1996, the United States convened a secret grand jury in New York toinvestigate and brought a formal indictment against Osama bin Laden for a list ofterrorist crimes. Osama bin Laden's Declaration of Jihad Against the United States and ItsAlliesIn turn, bin Laden on August 23, 1996 signed and issued a Declaration of Jihadoutlining his Al Qaeda organization's goals:1) To drive U. S. forces from the Arabian Peninsula;2) To overthrow the government of Saudi Arabia;3) to liberate Muslim holy sites;4) and to support Islamic revolutionary groups around the world. He declaredthat Saudis have the right to strike against U.S. troops in the Persian Gulf.Two years later, bin Laden issued a joint declaration with the Islamic Group, AlJihad, in Bangladesh and another in Pakistan under the banner \"World IslamicFront\" which stated that Muslims should kill Americans including civilians -anywhere in the world. And on August 7, 1998, two simultaneous explosions atU. S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania killed 224 people and injured more than4,500.By October 1998, the Arabic newspaper, Al-Hayat, claimed bin Laden hadacquired nuclear weapons from Soviet Central Asian countries using a networkof \"influential friends.\"In 2000, there was an attack on the U.S. S. Cole that U. S. officials link to binLaden. May 2001 - Bin Laden Followers Sentenced in U. S.On May 29, 2001, four followers of Osama bin Laden are found guilty ofcharges stemming from the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Kenya andTanzania, including murder, conspiracy and perjury. A death penalty and lifesentences were given. September 11, 2001 - New York World Trade Center Destroyed andPentagon AttackedThen on September 11, 2001, four hijacked American airliners become suicidebombers in the hands of 19 trained terrorists thought to have direct links toOsama bin Laden and his allies, including Afghanistan, Pakistan and the IranianHezbollah. As Larry Johnson told Frontline: \"Bin Laden is a symbolic head of amovement of religious fanatics who want to purge the world of evil. And theUnited States is the symbol of that evil. I think lurking in the mind of bin Ladenand the Al Qaeda group is the notion that you're going to strike a blow sodecisive, so terrible, it will cause the collapse of the society that they view ashollow. Western society is evil. It is based upon liquor and prostitutes and notbeing faithful to Allah, as they interpret Islam. And therefore, it's a shell thatonce you attack it, and hit it in its right spot, it will collapse....We know thingsabout bin Laden that we didn't two or three years ago. We now know, forexample, bin Laden was meeting with Imad Mughniyah, the Hezbollah securitychief. Mughniyah, until September 11, 2001, had killed more Americans thanbin Laden, had wounded more Americans than bin Laden. Mughniyah wasinvolved with the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon, thetakeover of TWA 847, the murder of Navy diver Robert Stethem and theabduction of several Americans held hostage in Beirut, Lebanon.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Is Imad Mughniyah of the Iranian Hezbollah the Shadow Behind Osamabin Laden?And about the connection between bin Laden, the Iranian Hezbollah and theAfghani Taliban that are supposed to oppose the Iranians: \"...I know theNational Security Council under President Clinton believed that someone like abin Laden would have no connection or ties to Iran and that he, bin Laden,would be diametrically opposed to Iran because the Taliban are opposed to theIranians. But when you see someone like Imad Mughniyah meeting with binLaden, and Mughniyah moves freely back and forth between the Bekaa Valleyand Iran - and the Bekaa Valley is where the explosives come out that end updestroying the U. S. housing complex in Saudi Arabia - and that the individualswho are involved in that bombing attempt in Saudi Arabia again show up havinglinks and ties with bin Laden, all of a sudden, you need to step back and say, IsOsama doing the bidding of Iran? That's a possibility....Whether he's doing it onhis own or with the encouragement of a state that's staying behind the scenes, heis willing to use violence to destroy what he genuinely believes is evil\" - theUnited States of America.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
