It started back in July2000 when four sheep on their Greensboro, Vermont farm tested positive forantibodies to Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy, or TSE, - a family ofdiseases caused by misshapen proteins called prions - the most famous beingBSE, bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or Mad Cow disease. The destructiveproteins attack the spinal cord and brain, literally eating holes in tissues whichdeteriorate to resemble a sponge, always ending in death.The BSE form of prions causes Mad Cow symptoms and death in bothEuropean cattle and humans. A different prion attacks deer and elk in theAmerican \"chronic wasting disease.\" A third kind of prion causes \"scrapie\" insheep. Other different prions are responsible for the fatal Creutzfeldt-Jakob andKuru diseases in humans.Since the 1996 epidemic of mad cow cases in England, all kinds of bans wereplaced on British meat products and animals. But that same year, the Vermontfarmers joined together to import the prodigious milk producers from Belgiumand the Netherlands to produce gourmet cheeses. By 1998, the USDA hadquarantined the flock after all the mad cow cases in Great Britain, worried thatthe imported sheep might have eaten feed in Europe contaminated by mad cowdisease.Then last July, four sheep culled from the Vermont flocks tested positive forantibodies to some kind of transmissible spongiform encephalopathy. No oneknows if it is BSE Mad Cow, scrapie, chronic wasting disease or what. That'swhen the USDA issued a declaration of extraordinary emergency to destroy thesheep, but the owners went to court and contested. Until today.This afternoon at a press conference in Montpelier, USDA Senior StaffVeterinarian Linda Detwiler of the Animal and Plant Inspection Service, told"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"reporters that the Federal District Court had ruled in favor of the USDA andordered the owners to comply. The owners will be compensated for the fairmarket value of their sheep. Today, the USDA entered the Greensboro farm andstarted trucking all 233 imported sheep to the National Veterinary ServicesLaboratories in Ames, Iowa where they will be killed and examined for spongytissue found in prion diseases. It will take two to three years before medicalresearchers know which kind of prion disease the Vermont sheep have.Interview:Linda Detwiler, D.V.M., Senior Staff Veterinarian, U. S. Department ofAgriculture, Animal and Plant Inspection Service, Robinsville, New Jersey:\"Based on the findings and all the information we provided, the science and thetest results, the Court supported the decision by the USDA to remove the sheep.Samples will be taken for diagnostic testing and then the carcasses will be safelydisposed of. The brain material of ones that test positive would be injected intothese five different panels of mice and then we would wait about two to threeyears for the mice to come down with the disease. And then there is a scheme orprocedure about how they characterize the disease in the mice to find whatstrain it is.IN MARCH OF 2001 WITH THESE ANIMALS THAT HAVE GONE TOAMES, IOWA TODAY, WILL THEY SOON BE ABLE TO IDENTIFYTHE PRIONS IN THE BRAINS OF THE ANIMALS THEY KILL?What they are going to do, the diagnostic test that is available to everybody inthe world that would give you if they have a TSE or not.BUT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT WE WOULDN'T KNOW FORTWO OR THREE MORE YEARS IF IT WERE ACTUALLY THE SAMEPRION THAT HAS BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BSE SYNDROMEIN EUROPE?Yes, that's correct.DOES THAT APPLY TO THE SCRAPIE PRION AS WELL?Yes, it does, it applies to all the agents that are in the family TSE.FROM A VETERINARIAN'S PERSPECTIVE, WHAT HAVE BEEN THESYMPTOMS IN THE FOUR SHEEP THAT HAD THE POSITIVEANTIBODIES?It's been kind of vague in the flock. We've just had kind of wasting conditions inthe flock which you can see with the TSEs.\"Prion-Contaminated Sheep Were Bred and Produced 27 More SheepA VERMONT NEWSPAPER REPORTER WHO HAS BEEN COVERINGTHIS STORY SINCE 1999 IS JOHN DILLON WITH THE RUTLANDHERALD AND ARGUS TIMES IN MONTPELIER. HE WAS AT THE PRESSCONFERENCE AND SAID DR. DETWILER EXPRESSED USDA CONCERNTHAT THE FARMERS HAD ALLOWED THE QUARANTINED SHEEP TOBREED."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"European ewe with lambs courtesy Cornell University.John Dillon, Reporter, Rutland Herald and Times Argus, Montpelier,Vermont: \"And the second thing she said was that the Faillace's animals havebred and produced 27 more sheep, which alarmed the USDA because they'vehoped they wouldn't have more sheep to kill and that they are concerned aboutthe potential spread off the farm if the animals keep breeding. So they thought itwas time to move them.She also said that other farmers in Vermont and around the country werepressing the USDA to do something, to just get rid of it.MEANING BECAUSE THESE SHEEP WERE THERE AS A BIGQUESTION MARK AS HAVING THIS STRANGE PRION DISEASETHAT NO ONE KNOWS EXACTLY HOW IT SPREADS OR WHAT ITCOULD DO?Yeah. There are other dairy sheep farmers in Vermont whose cheese and milksales have suffered because when people go to the supermarket they just think ofVermont and sheep cheese and they say, \"I've heard about that. I don't want tobuy that.\" So, they want these sheep gone, the people who make goat milkcheese want these sheep gone. The Vermont Congressional delegation wantthese sheep gone because they don't want a black eye on Vermont agriculture.The Faillaces and Houghton Freemen have their supporters, but there are manypeople who say: 'These are just sheep and this is too serious a disease.'\"We b s it e s :http://www.rutlandherald.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
