But this month as president, he has nowreversed himself saying there is a national energy crisis. At the same time, astudy was published in the journal Nature confirming unequivocally thatgreenhouse gases are increasing. Scientists at London's Imperial Collegecompared 1997 infrared reflections of carbon dioxide, methane and ozone fromEarth's surface and found less was escaping into space compared to satellite datain 1970. Atmospheric physicist John Harries said, \"We're absolutely sure; there'sno ambiguity. This shows the greenhouse effect is operating, and what we areseeing can only be due to the increase in the gases.\"Pliocene, 3 Million Years AgoCarbon Dioxide Levels During Pliocene Compared to Global Warming 2001The last time the earth was warmer than it is to day was at least 3 million yearsago in the middle of the Pliocene epoch. Then there was large warming at midand high latitudes with cooler, stable tropical temperatures. The cause forPliocene warming is still not understood, but its suspected there was acombination of ocean heat transport combined with an increase in carbondioxide. However, the carbon dioxide levels then were not much different thantoday.Carbon Dioxide in Warm Pliocene 3 Million Years Ago Appx. 380 ppm.Carbon Dioxide in Global Warming 2001 Appx. 315 ppm.As carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases keep increasing today, the earth isexpected to keep warming up over the next one hundred years anywherebetween 3 to 10.5 degrees Fahrenheit. We might gain some insights about whatcould happen by looking at what we know about the middle Pliocene. Manyocean and land-based core drills contain well-dated Pliocene sediments whichhelp.The NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York has looked at deepsea cores and pollen records and fed information into a computer to produce a"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"global climate simulation that compares the Pliocene with where we are nowand where we could be headed.Today scientists think the earth is warming because of the thick layer ofgreenhouse gases building up in the lower atmosphere, chiefly carbon dioxidefrom increased industrial emissions.The GISS model does not support the idea that Pliocene warming was caused bycarbon dioxide increase. What caused the warming is not clear, but deep oceancores indicate that water might have played a major role in warming thePliocene. The deep sea cores indicate sea surface temperatures were very highthree million years ago and were linked to the North Atlantic deep watercirculation which increased during the middle Pliocene.GISS Report About Global Climate Model of PlioceneQuoting from a GISS report about its Pliocene research:\"In our experiments we have found both consistencies andinconsistencies between model and data-generated paleoclimateestimates. Temperature estimates show the greatest consistency, withboth model and data indicating significantly warmer temperatures athigh latitudes and diminished warming nearer to the equator.\"The continental temperatures agree well with estimates frompalynological studies, especially in the circum-North Atlantic region.This is not unexpected since that region is strongly influenced by thedramatically warmer North Atlantic surface sea temperatures. Theglobal climate change model (GCM) also yields temperatureincreases up to 10 degrees Centigrade along the Arctic coasts andshows greatest warming in the winter.Pliocene and modern vegetation global albedo distribution.Graph courtesy of NASA GISS, New York City, N. Y.\"Although the original temperature increase is driven by warmer seasurface temperatures, much of the continental interior warming isgenerated by an ice-albedo feedback, as reduced snow cover in thewarmer climate reflects less solar radiation away from the surfaceduring winter months. Further warming at high latitudes comes fromthe increased levels of atmospheric water vapor (greenhouse gas)which results from the warm, ice-free ocean conditions."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"Despite the generally warmer climatic conditions, some areas showoverall cooling. Notably, East Africa cools by 2 to 3 degreesCentigrade due to increased low-level cloud cover, which reflectslarge amounts of incoming solar radiation back to space. Very fewpaleo observations are available for some remote parts of Africa, butour simulation is consistent with the single palynological record thatexists for that region.\"The most common discrepancy seems to be an underestimation bythe model of wetter conditions, as interpreted from pollen records,throughout the Northern Hemisphere. For example, the modelpredicts lower effective moisture (precipitation minus evaporation) inwestern North America, but geologic records indicate wetterconditions during the Pliocene. The root of the difference seems tolie in the northern summer season where the model's groundhydrology responds to the warmer ground temperatures by dryingout.\"Concerns About 21st Century Global Warming Hotter? Or colder?Investigators have found evidence that minor increases in carbon dioxide up to380 ppm did occur in the Pliocene. That raises the question about whether somekind of climate feedback was associated with small increases in CO2 that lead tolarger changes in ocean circulation.If so, what will ocean circulations do this time? Just as the Pliocene heated, itwas also a transition into cooling and the spread of glaciers over all of NorthAmerica. The last glacial period ended ten thousand years ago. Since then, theworld has heated up 10 degrees F., the same amount that the GISS computerssay the world could heat up in just the next 100 years. There is no precedent inany ice cores, tree rings, pollen or other physical evidence of such extremeheating in such a short time period.\"If the 10 degree F. projection happened, the consequences could be disastrouswith more unpredictable weather patterns and extremes,\" warns Drew Shindell,Ph.D., atmospheric physicist at NASA's GISS.We b s it e s :http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/paleo/pliocene/page2.html#simulationsCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
