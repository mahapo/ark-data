The IceAge site is filled with the bones of elephants, sloths, condors and a bird with a14-foot wingspan. The unidentified human hairs were found perfectly preserveda few feet underground and had enough follicles for DNA analysis. This week Italked with geology professor emeritus, William Orr, at the University ofOregon, about DNA efforts to match the Ice Age hair to any living hominoidspecies on earth today."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Evacuation units at Woodburn, Oregon Ice Age archaeological site were prepared andexcavated.Some units were skim shoveled and then troweled so that animal limbs and fauna could beextracted without harm.

DNA analyses of hair follicles found at the site haveso far failed to find a match with any known human racial type living on earth today.Photograph © 2001 by Alison Stenger, Ph.D.We found several strands of human hair, long pieces a foot and a half long,black, long pieces of hair. And then if you can find the root of the hair that stillhas a follicle, you can do DNA on it. So researchers immediately sent the (IceAge) hair off to a lab and they began to extract the DNA. Some of it was not sogood, but a lot of it was well preserved in the oxygen-poor bogs of Woodburn.The geneticists found the hair didn't match any Asian hair DNA. It didn't matchAfrican, European. It didn't match anything. Dogma would be that Ice Agehumans along the west coast of the United States would be from a Japanesepopulation that is alleged to have come over the Bering Sea back twelve tothirteen thousand years ago.So right now we have DNA we can't track. We can't figure out what it's from.Apparently from a population we don't have today. They are gone. And it's only"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"11,000 or 12,000 years old. About that time period, there was a huge crisis inanimals. The larger animals all disappeared and they disappeared in a wave.They disappeared first in British Columbia and then in Washington, Oregon,California and right on down. Some were still around until 10,000 years ago inTierra del Fuego. So, it was like a wave of extinction at the rate of about 10miles per year.THERE IS A MYSTERY ABOUT WHAT KILLED OFF ALL OF THESEMAMMALS IN WAVES TEN OR TWELVE THOUSAND YEARS AGO?Oh, yes. In fact for my money, it's far more profound than the crisis that killedoff the dinosaurs and a few other animals at 66 million years ago. This (westernNorth American) was more sudden, more pervasive. It kind of selectively tookthe large animals in a short period of time.HOW DEEP DOWN WERE THE HAIRS FOUND?The deepest ones were from ten to twelve feet, but a lot of them were frommuch shallower depths. It's an old stream bed and we just took a little auguringdevice to core down and began getting well-preserved hair out of the clays. TheWoodburn stuff it's like putting it in a deep freeze, or a glad bag and freezing it.It's an anoxic environment (no oxygen). You wouldn't believe the insects comeout with colors still. And as you watch them, the color changes from theiridescent blue-green back to a kind of dull black, just in the exposure as theyoxidize before your eyes. Even the butterflies come out with pigment and thenthey just change color.IT''S ALMOST AS IF THEY WERE QUICK FROZEN.Almost.\"Forensic expert examines specimens from 2001 excavation at Woodburn, Oregon Ice Agearchaeological site.

Photograph © 2001 by Alison Stenger, Ph.D.More Information:Professor Orr has even considered the possibility that the black hairs could comefrom a hominoid such as the mysterious Sasquatch long associated with thenorthwest. Whatever the hairs' source or sources, it came from someone whowas there when elephants, sloths and giant birds lived on the west coast ofNorth America.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expressly"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"prohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
