S. Fish and Wildlife, Alaska.February 7, 2001 Santa Cruz, California -Changing Environment and Impact On Animals The past ten years have been the warmest in a thousand years; the Arctic icecap has shrunk over the past three decades to about half the size it was. Polar bear survival is threatened as the ice shrinks. The hole in the ozone over Antarctica in Fall 2000 was the biggest it has everbeen. Increased ultraviolet exposure from thinning ozone has been linked toamphibian deaths. The temperature of the stratosphere is becoming much colder while the airclose to the earth continues to warm, increasing atmospheric instability andwind speeds. Sea Otters Near Extinction - Data analyzed from 1977 show the Gulf of Alaskawaters suddenly warmed up 2 degrees Celsius. No one at the time thought thattemperature change would create big problems. But today, researchershypothesize that those two degrees ultimately have produced the near extinctionof sea otters in the Aleutian Islands. Since 1992, the otter population fell fromaround 100,000 down to 6,000 - a decline of 94%. That rate of decline isunprecedented for any mammal population in the world to date."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands that curve northward around Bering Sea off the westcoast of Alaska.It is estimated that 90% of the world's sea otter population resides in the near shore coastalwaters of Alaska.But only 6,000 are left in the Aleutian archipelago down from more than 100,000.Scientists have been completely baffled about the sea otters' steep decline. Firstthey wondered if disease was sweeping through the marine animals. But if so,where were the thousands of dead bodies? It began to dawn on University ofCalifornia - Santa Cruz grad student, Tim Tinker, that perhaps the otters werebeing eaten. But by what? The surprising answer is a predator that until now hadlived peacefully with the otters for thousands of years: orca, the killer whale.Scientists now have watched the whales eat the sea otters. Marine ecologist, TimTinker, calculated that four killer whales could eat 40,000 otters in five years.But what would provoke the whales to turn to the sea otters for food? Scientistsspeculate that the sudden and unusual warming of the Gulf of Alaska killedtemperature-sensitive plankton. Then like falling dominoes, without plankton toeat, shrimp, crab, herring and other smelt fish starved and vanished. Smelt wasalways a major source of fat for baby marine animals, so when the smeltdisappeared it triggered the collapse of seal and sea-lion populations that killerwhales depended upon. Finally, the killer whales started eating the sea otters.As the sea otters began to disappear, one of the animals they fed upon - the seaurchin - had a population explosion. Scientists have recently counted as many as100 of the spiny creatures per square foot on the ocean floor. As the sea urchinsspread in such density, they destroyed kelp forests that in turn caused the rapiddecline of fish species that depend upon the kelp for protection.

Fish and Wildlife Service.Interview:Tim Tinker, Ph.D. Candidate in Marine Ecology, Dept. of Ecology andEvolutionary Biology, University of California, Santa Cruz, California: \"Itshows us that what might be perceived as fairly minor ecological changes, achange in water temperature by a few degrees or the change even in speciescomposition or prey composition in the diet of one species in response to overfishing or any other human-caused change in the ecosystem, can have reallyprofound and unforeseen consequences.IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT IT IS ALMOST SHOCKING TO YOU ASSCIENTISTS THAT SEA OTTERS WOULD HAVE A POPULATIONDECLINE THAT PRECIPITOUS?Oh, yes! Yeah! That was extraordinarily shocking! That was completelyunanticipated by us or anyone, really, that a population - that we could even seea decline both that extensive geographically and that rapid among, in a species, alarge mammalian species that does not typically undergo that sort of populationfluctuation of that magnitude. Again, as I alluded to before, that sort ofdemonstrates to us our very limited understanding of the linkages betweenecosystems and the complex relationships that exist both within specificecosystems and can link to ecosystems in ways we cannot anticipate and thesudden inclusion of sea otters as prey to killer whales was completelyunanticipated by us. And even when we saw it, we knew it was occurring forabout 4 to 5 years, we had been seeing this and were aware it was occurring andthought of it more as an interesting observation before it really dawned on usthat in fact this could have that sort of effect.BUT SOMETHING PROVOKED THE KILLER WHALES TOSUDDENLY START SWITCHING AND FOCUSING ON THE SEAOTTERS?Yes, that seems pretty clear just based on all the observations that , all thepeople who have studied sea otters throughout this century and all the peoplewho have spent a lot of time watching sea otters, predation events by killerwhales of sea otters were just completely unheard of or unwitnessed entirelyuntil our first observations in the early 1990s. Since that time, we've seen itfairly regularly. So it does seem clear that something caused them to add seaotters to their diet. We believe that a logical explanation of that would bedecrease in some of the other marine mammal species that we know wereincluded in their diet before, primarily stellar sea lions.IF IT''S DOWN TO 6,000 SEA OTTERS FROM OVER 100,000 NOW INTHE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS, AND IF IT KEEPS DROPPING, IT'SPOSSIBLE THAT IN THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS, THE SEA OTTERPOPULATION MIGHT GO TO ZERO THERE?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I don't really think that's likely to transpire. But it certainly is one conceivableresult. At this point, I don't think so. I think it's more likely that small localpopulations will continue to persist. However, when the numbers are that low,what certainly can happen is that at smaller islands that are only sustainingreally tiny populations that you could have local extinctions. So we could startto see fragmentations of the population. In fact, we already know that hasoccurred. There are a few islands during this past year that were surveyed onwhich no otters were found. So, it appears that some local extinctions haveoccurred.THE SIGNIFICANCE IS THAT IN THE LONG ANNALS OF HUMANRESEARCH, THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED EVENT AMONGMAMMALS?Yes, we aren't aware of any mammalian decline of either this magnitude orgeographic extent. It's really kind of mind boggling, actually. We think thesignificance is really more than that because attending the decline of the seaotters has been this whole suite of changes in the coastal ecosystem of theAleutian islands with a dramatic increase of sea urchins, their primary prey andresulting decrease in kelp forest stands. And we're only beginning to understandand document the changes that are occurring in response to decrease in kelpdensity. Another student of Dr. Estes is looking at kelp bed fish populations andjust based on her early analysis of her data, it looks like there has been reallydramatic changes in the fish population have occurred. And all this hashappened just within the last five years. So, we think this is a prettyextraordinary event and it definitely effects just more than the sea otterpopulation.THE CURRENT U. N. REPORT RECENTLY CAME OUT ABOUTGLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE PROJECTIONS OVER THE NEXT 100YEARS BASED ON DATA FROM SEVERAL INTERNATIONALLABORATORIES. THE DATA PROJECTS THAT THE GLOBAL MEANAVERAGE TEMPERATURE COULD RISE ANYWHERE FROM 3 TO10.5 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT OVER THE NEXT 100 YEARS.OVER THE 100 YEARS OF THE 20TH CENTURY, THE GLOBALTEMPERATURE ONLY ROSE 1 DEGREE. A 3 TO 10.5 DEGREEINCREASE IS ALMOST INCOMPREHENSIBLE. COULD WE BESEEING IN THE ALEUTIAN ISLANDS A SMALL PRELUDE OFTHINGS TO COME?I think that's probably a good appraisal of the situation. Whatever the wholesuite of causes for this change, it definitely appears that a change in temperaturehas played a part and it certainly gives us an idea of the really broad anddramatic changes that can happen in response to what we might think arerelatively minor changes. So, yeah, I think that does give us a good taste of whatmore we might expect to see.\"More Information:Tim Tinker, Dr. Jim Estes and their UCSC and USGS colleagues will travel tothe Aleutian Islands again in the 2001 summer to count sea otters on threeislands from a slow moving boat.We b s it e s :http://alaska.fws.gov/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
