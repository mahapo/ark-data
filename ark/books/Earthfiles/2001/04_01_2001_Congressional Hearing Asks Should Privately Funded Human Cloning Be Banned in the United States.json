S.?© 2001 by Linda Moulton Howe Since Dolly, the Scotland sheep, was the world's first cloned mammal in 1997,many other animals have been cloned and some scientists now want to clone humans.Graphic © 2001 by The British Council.April 1, 2001 Washington, D. C. - Representative James C. Greenwood (R.,Pa.) called a hearing to order on March 28, 2001 to consider human cloning andwhether it should be banned in the United States. Rep. Greenwood is Chairmanof the House Energy and Commerce Committee's Oversight and InvestigationSubcommittee. \"Although publicly funded human cloning research isprohibited,\" Rep. Greenwood said, \"privately funded human cloning research isnot.\"Two groups of privately funded scientists told the committee they expect tocreate a human clone within two years. One group is Clonaid which calls itself\"The First Human Cloning Company.\" Its cloning project is headed by Frenchscientist, Dr. Brigitte Bossellier, Ph.D., who is quoted at the Clonaid website,\"Who today would be scandalized to the idea of bringing back to life a10-month old child who died accidentally? The technology allows it, theparents desire it, and I don't see any ethical problems.\" Dr. Bossellier read aletter at the Greenwood hearing from parents who have invested $500,000 inClonaid in order to have a clone produced from their child who died. Clonaid'swebsite also says it \"will charge as low as $200,000 US for its cloning services.\"Clonaid © 2001.At the Clonaid.com home page, there are also links to Rael.org, Rael Press File,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and Ufoland. Rael is the founder of a religious organization called the RaelianMovement \"which claims that life on earth was created scientifically inlaboratories by extraterrestrials whose name is Elohim as found in the HebrewBible.\" Both Dr. Bossellier and Rael are promoting human cloning and willrelease a book in April entitled, \"Yes to Human Cloning - Eternal life thanks toscience.\"Several medical researchers argued that human cloning is not easy and willproduce serious defects. Dr. Mark Westhusin, a Texas A & M Universityveterinarian testified that most cloned animals don't survive and those born haveserious defects. He is also critical of Clonaid's promise to screen for geneticdefects in order to insure a healthy cloned human baby.I talked with both Rael and Dr. Westhusin this week after the Congressionalhearing and present here their two points of view.Interview:Rael, Founder of the Raelian Movement, Miami, Florida: \"Last spring, Dr.Brigette Bossellier was in charge of the project told me, 'Rael, we are ready. Wecan really do it. We have a team of scientists. We have an investor. We haveeverything.' So I say, 'OK, do it.' They created a new company in Americaespecially to do cloning. But it's separate from the Raelian movement.WHERE IS CLONAID IN THE UNITED STATES?I cannot tell you. I don't know where the laboratory is and I don't want to knowfor safety reasons.TO PROTECT THE EFFORTS, THEY DON'T WANT ANYONE TOKNOW?For the safety of the scientists and project.IN THE NEWSPAPER FOLLOWING UP ON REP. GREENWOOD'SHEARING IN WASHINGTON THIS WEEK, IT SAYS THAT CLONAIDHAS PARENTS, A COUPLE THAT HAVE PAID $500,000 FOR APROCEDURE IN WHICH CELLS FROM THEIR DEAD CHILD WILLBE USED TO CREATE A CLONE OF THEIR DEAD CHILD.Correct.IS THAT GOING FORWARD?Yes, absolutely. But they are not customers. Clonaid I think has a list of 200potential customers. But they are the first, they are more than customers. Theyare founders. They founded the company with Dr. Bossellier so they are part ofit. The Clonaid project has not accepted money from any customer to now.THE $500,000 WAS ON THE PART OF A COUPLE WHO WOULDLIKE TO HAVE THE CLONE OF THE CHILD WHO DIED AND THEYHAVE THAT VESTED INTEREST AND HAVE JOINED WITH DR.BOSELLIER TO CREATE CLONAID. THEY WOULD BE AT LEASTONE OF THE PROJECTS CLONAID WOULD DO IN TERMS OFCLONING A HUMAN?Yes, they are the first one and investors and they helped Brigette Bossellier tocreate the company.DO YOU NOW KNOW WHEN THE CLONING PROJECT OF THISCHILD MIGHT BEGIN?One of the first things I asked Brigette Bosellier, 'If you do it, do it in a perfectway, safe and healthy.' We are not creating monsters. No way. We want to havea project that has a smiling baby and happy family on TV as soon as possibleand not monsters. Some journalists are writing that we want to make monsterswith two heads. This is completely stupid. We are not creating monsters. Thereare a lot of technologies available which are at the very early stage ofdevelopment to be sure that the baby is normal. And if it is not and in the very"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"early stages, in the first few weeks, you can have an abortion of course.WOULD THIS WORK BE GOING FORWARD THIS YEAR?As soon as possible. They are just now training the team using cow eggs.USING BOVINE COW EGGS?Ye s .I WONDER IF YOU ARE GETTING ANY KIND OFCOMMUNICATION FROM THE EXTRATERRESTRIALS ABOUTCLONING OF THE HUMAN PROJECT? IS THIS SOMETHING THEYWANT TO SEE HAPPEN?Of course, because that is part of my book, at our website, www.rael.org - theysaid we are now becoming what the Bible said a long time ago 'equal to Elohim.'Thanks to science. It was written that human beings will become equal to them.So that's what we are doing now. And we are in fact in the process ofElohimization by slowly becoming able to create artificial life, by becomingourselves able to travel to other planets, and I'm quite sure that soon we willhave a team of scientists going to one of the planets.WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL ELOHIMCREATED HUMANS HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE?At the beginning, it was just scientific experimentation. But then, they realizedthat it was much larger than that and that it is Infinity taking consciousness ofItself. We are Infinity, but material infinity, the minerals, are not aware, have noconsciousness. So, by creating life we are changing the matter in consciousness.May I add something about the Congress? I think they will pass a law against it.My hope then is to go to the Supreme Court which 22 years ago it was the samething. They passed a law against IVF, in vitro fertilization. Then people sent tothe Supreme Court where people ruled in favor of IVF. And I hope it will be thesame. If not, we are on the same path as the Elohim and maybe the scientists,because of the various conservative visions imposed by primitive religion, willhave to create life somewhere else.YOU MEAN ON THE EARTH?On the Earth - I am sure they will try. But if it's complicated and if not possibleon the Earth, then we will have to do what the Elohim did for us a long timeago. Wait until a team of scientists do it on another planet. Like a cycle, if youwant. We may do the same thing. It's possible.LIKE MOVING TO MARS...And creating life far from public opinion. Yes.\"Model of DNA and sequence of genesin all earth life which can be manipulated and duplicated © 2001 Clonaid. Veterinarian Warns Cloning Is Difficult and Produces Birth DefectsIf the issue of banning human cloning in the U. S. does end up before theSupreme Copurt, there will be many medical experts arguing against humancloning. One of those is Dr. Mark Westhusin, Associate Professor in theDepartment of Veterinarian Physiology and Pharmacology at Texas A&M's"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"College of Veterinary Medicine. Dr. Westhusin has been trying to clone cows,dogs, cats and other animals for research purposes and stressed before Rep.Greenwood's Congressional hearing that cloning is difficult, inefficient andplagued with birth defects.Mark Westhusin, D.V.M., Associate Professor, Dept. of VeterinarianPhysiology and Pharmacology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Texas A&M University, College Station, Texas:\"There were really two main points I wanted to bring up at the hearing at theHouse of Representatives. One of those being that animal cloning per se is justan extremely inefficient process at this point and we really shouldn't be applyingit or using it to try and reproduce humans or human babies simply because ofthe risks that are involved in terms of high abortion rates and also for the risk itposes to the surrogate mothers if you.If it did make it to term, there's a significant chance that the baby that was bornwould have developmental abnormalities and also die. The abnormalities thatwe have seen in cattle includes such things as cardiovascular problems,pulmonary hypertension and other kinds of abnormalities that ultimately resultin their death. Some of them are fine, but a significant proportion of them doexhibit these developmental problems.WHY IS IT THAT CLONING SEEMS TO HAVE THESE KINDS OFPROBLEMS?We have no idea and we're still in the middle of research to try to understand it.One of the things we think is going on is that we get an improper reprogrammingof genes. So if you think about what happens in a normal process of fertilizationwith a sperm and an egg, you have a genetic reprogramming that goes on. So, theegg reprograms the sperm, for instance, and the egg itself cannot function as asperm or egg anymore, but can now function as a new embryo and can turn offcertain genes and turn on others to now develop into a normal embryo. Well, anegg knows how to handle a sperm and knows how to reprogram the genes in thesperm. What we think it does not know how to do, at least in the vast majorityof the situations, is to reprogram the genes from a skin cell so that it will in factdevelop into a normal embryo.The 2nd point that I brought up at the hearing was the concept or idea thatindividuals interested in cloning humans claim that what we can do is screen theembryos and determine which ones are going to develop abnormally. Well, thereason they can't do that is based off this statement that I just talked about withreprogramming. It is not a simple fact that they have an abnormal number ofchromosomes or they have some really obvious things you can detect with anykinds of technologies that we have today. There are very subtle kinds of thingsgoing on with gene expression and we really don't know what are the genes thatare being expressed properly and which ones aren't.There are a lot of genes that we would have to test. You can think about howyou would screen for 30,000 different genes and tell which are operatingproperly and which aren't? Those kinds of ideas that you can screen and tellwhich ones are going to develop abnormally - really, we don't have thetechnology today to do that.IS PART OF THE CONFUSION IN THE PUBLIC'S MIND AT LEASTTHAT THERE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL CLONINGS SUCH AS THESHEEP, DOLLY, AND OTHER ANIMALS HAVE BEEN REPORTEDOVER THE PAST TWO OR THREE YEARS. THE GENERALIMPRESSION IS THAT CLONING ACTUALLY DOES WORK.Right, and it does work. And it's a fascinating and remarkable situation that itdoes. It still dumbfounds a lot of us that it does work. But the fact of it is that it'sso inefficient that it's one of those situations where it becomes big news when aclone is actually born. But it kind of overshadows the inefficiency and all thetechniques and procedures that had to happen to get that one clone. Just theidea that it works at all is so remarkable that the rest of it gets overshadowed in"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"terms of the inefficiency. And people are really backing up and taking a look atit.DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER OBJECTION TO RESEARCHERSTRYING TO CLONE A HUMAN?From a personal standpoint, I have my own moral and personal objectionsagainst it personally. I don't think we should do it. But beyond that, I just don'tthink it is safe. If you just look at what I already mentioned that what thelikelihood is of having an extremely high abortion rate and extremely inefficientat getting pregnancies to begin with and that the majority of those will abort.Then a significant proportion of the offspring that may result would also havedevelopmental problems. So, it's just an irresponsible stance to take at this pointto say that we would try these technologies on humans.YOU HAVE BEEN CLONING DOGS?And cats and cows and goats and horses and a variety of different species.YOUR GOAL WOULD BE WHAT?The potential benefits of cloning animals are enormous. They range from beingable to reproduce superior livestock that are now deceased and we want to keepthose genes around in the genetic pool to replicating high-producing milk cowsand replicating great sires to genetically engineering animals, for instance, thatare disease-resistant to some of the particular diseases that are devastating thecountry right now, like foot-and-mouth disease and BSE and other kinds ofthings. And so, the focus of our research, is to try and understand why it is soinefficient and to improve the efficiency of the process.THE PEOPLE WHO SAID THEY HAD A CHILD WHO HAD DIED ANDIF THEY COULD FROM THE CELL OF THAT DEAD CHILD BE ABLETO BRING THEIR CHILD BACK, HOW IS THAT DIFFERENTQUALITATIVELY FROM PRODUCING CLONES OF ANIMALS FORBETTER STOCK AND BETTER MILK AND MEAT AND SO FORTH.WHERE DOES ONE APPLICATION STOP VERSUS ANOTHER?There is a real misconception in society that cloning is in some way a means ofresurrection. And it's not a means of resurrection! If you clone an animal, youget a completely new animal. And that new animal has the same geneticendowments perhaps. But it wouldn't even have the same genetic endowmentsreally as an identical twin would because you would use an egg or ovum youcollected from another animal that would have a new mitochondrial genotypethat codes for about 21 genes. So, in fact it wouldn't be as genetically identicalas an identical twin would be.But the real struggle that people need to think through in their mind and getover is this concept of the difference between resurrection and reproduction.This is NOT resurrection. If your animal dies, your animal is dead. You're nevergoing to get t hat animal back.This is not playing God. It's an assisted reproductive technology not that muchfarther away from basic things that are already used like in vitro fertilization,sperm injection, artificial insemination and other kinds of technologies that areused to assist people in reproducing animals or humans. But it's not resurrection.We are not gods and we cannot play god.WOULD RESURRECTION IN THE WAY YOU ARE DEFINING ITMEAN THAT THE SAME THOUGHTS, SOULS, SPIRIT, LIFEESSENCE FROM THE PREVIOUS ANIMAL THAT WAS CLONEDFROM WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE IDENTICAL IN A CLONE?Well, we're getting off into philosophical religious types of discussion which Ishould not go there. But, yeah, it's a new individual. It's a completely newindividual. You think we're cloning souls? We're cloning spirits? I don't think so!WHAT WAS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SHEEP FROMWHICH THE CELL WAS ERIVED TO MAKE THE DOLLY CLONE?\"The relationship is that she would be similar to an identical twin, but not really"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"as much as an identical twin because she has a new mitochondrial genotype. Shewas derived from a different egg. You know, Dolly is not even as close to beingan identical twin as an identical twin would be. It's basically that she representsthe genetic make up of the original donor, the original animal that donated thecell. They have the same genetic make up almost. If you don't include themitochondrial DNA, then they would be the same. But if you include themitochondrial DNA, she in fact is different.IS IT TRUE THAT THE TELOMERES AT THE END OF THECHROMOSOMES SHORTEN FROM CLONE TO CLONE MORETHAN THEY DO IN A NORMAL BIRTH POPULATION CAUSINGLIFE SPANS TO BE SHORTER?That's really all still unclear yet. The work that involved Dolly suggested thatsome of the telomeres were shorter. But in some work we recently publishedabout a bull we cloned suggests they were not shortened. So I think the jury isstill out on that one to see if that is really a problem or issue, but at this point itdoesn't seem to be really critical.\"We b s it e s :http://secularhumanism.org/library/fi/madigan_17_3.htmlhttp://www.clonaid.com/http://www.rael.org/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
