C. - Reporter Andrew Cawthorne reportingfrom Havana, Cuba for Reuters bylined a May 15 story entitled \"ExplorersComb Cuban Seas for Treasure, Mysteries.\" (See complete text below.) Heinterviewed ocean engineer Paulina Zelitsky, employed by Advanced DigitalCommunications and based in Tarara along the Cuba coast east of Havana.According to the article, Ms. Zelitsky said, \"We are the first people ever to seethe bottom of Cuban waters over 50 meters. It's so exciting. We are discovering...even possibly a sunken city built in the pre-classic period and populated by anadvanced civilization similar to the early Teotihuacan culture of Yucatan....Researchers using sonar equipment have discovered at a depth of about 2,200feet (700-800 meters) a huge land plateau with clear images of what appears tobe urban development partly covered by sand. From above, the shapes resemblepyramids, roads and buildings. \"Further, Mr. Cawthorne reported that \"ADC is excited but reluctant to speculateuntil a joint investigation with the Cuban Academy of Sciences and the U.

The following are the onlycomments that National Geographic spokeswoman, Barbara Moffet, would giveto date.Interview:Barbara Moffet, Director of Plans and Programs, Communications Office,National Geographic Society, Washington, D. C.: \"We know what the Cubanpeople have told us on the basis of a fairly preliminary survey that they did foranother purpose apparently, I believe, last year when they were working to testsome deep water equipment off Havana Bay. They found some things theythought were interesting, but it was a preliminary search. I don't even know thedetails of the type of equipment being used. But they agreed that much morespecific and different type of equipment would be needed to go back to the site.So they have made a proposal to us, I believe, that we get involved and helpthem explore the area. It's now just one of many proposals for such explorationthat we are considering at the moment.Who is Advanced Digital Communications?I don't know details on that.But does National Geographic Society have knowledge about AdvancedDigital Communications?I'm sure we do and yes, Linda, I could find out more on that if you need me tocall you back on that.Yes, I really do. I would like to talk to someone there. Now, in terms of theReuters story, they have talked with Paulina Zelitsky who is identified asan ocean engineer. Can you tell me about Paulina Zelitsky?I don't know too much except that she was born in the Soviet Union and isbased in Havana and she is someone very involved in underwater work in thewaters off of Cuba and we have known her for some time. Again, she is someonewho has made a proposal to us to do some exploration together.So you at the National Geographic are in communication with PaulinaZelitsky?That's right.The proposal she has made has been as an ocean engineer working withAdvanced Digital Communications?Yes, I believe she has made the proposal on behalf of the company that sherepresents, ADC. But I just would say again that it is just so early in this projectand frankly some of the things that Paulina has been quoted as saying are prettyspeculative. We just don't know that anything like that exists yet.In the Reuters article, she is quoted saying:'We are the first people ever to see the bottom of Cuban watersover 50 meters' (down at 2,200 feet). 'It is so exciting. We arediscovering the influence of currents on global climate,volcanoes, the history of formation of Caribbean islands,numerous historic wrecks and even possibly a sunken city builtin the pre-classic period and populated by an advancedcivilization similar to the early Teotihuacan culture of Yucatan.'Then she said that ADC was using and testing deep waterequipment off Havana Bay, as you just said, when they found"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"what she describes as clear 'high-resolution sonar images' thatare showing white sand and in the middle of the white side are'clear manmade large-size architectural designs. It looks likewhen you fly over an urban development in a plane and you seehighways, tunnels and buildings.'Yeah, I have a copy of a story that is similar to that. I know she is quoted assaying all that. She also said that we don't know what it is and we don't havevideotaped evidence yet. I think she would agree that it really is early tospeculate as she has here. I don't know. It would be great if it turned out to besomething that exciting. I would hope so if we want to get involved.Yes, this seems very important and the Reuters interview says that ADChas been using 'satellite-integrated ocean bottom positioning system,high-precision side-scan double-frequency sonar and remotely operatedsubmarine robots. They plan to add two submersibles to take peopledown.' And it sounds as if Paulina Zelitsky has been looking athigh-resolution sonar images.The copy I have said that ADC equipment includes those things. I don't know ifthey have had a chance to use them in the site yet. But I don't know. Obviously,there is a lot more to find out about this whole project and that is somethingwe're in the process of trying to do right now.Reuters says, 'ADC is excited but reluctant to speculate until a jointinvestigation with the Cuban Academy of Sciences and the U. S. NationalGeographic Society takes place early this summer.' Can you talk about thework that you are doing with the Cuban Academy of Sciences?Again, that paragraph assumes that we have a project and unfortunately, thathasn't been decided yet. There are many logistical questions that we are stillworking out. And as I said, it is one of dozens if not hundreds of projects thatwe're considering right now from all over the world. So it is even earlier thanthis story is indicating. I don't think we have anything official with either group.But there must be someone at the National Geographic Society who haseven images from the high-resolution sonar that Paulina Zelitsky isdescribing upon which to base a decision to do this underwaterarchaeological work?I haven't asked that. I haven't seen anything like that. I think it has been mostlyjust conversations. But I can find out and let you know.Also, this Reuters story quotes Paulina Zelitsky as saying, 'Our agenda ismuch broader. We are very anxious about global environmental changes.Archaeology is providing us with the means to conduct broader scientificocean exploration.' And that three other foreign companies, 'oneCanadian, one French and one South African operate in shallower watersthan ADC. Under contracts with Cuban state partner, Geomar, all thefirms have concessions to explore in different swathes of sea and wouldshare profits with the government.' Can you make any comment aboutthese other international efforts there off the coast of Cuba?\"No.The National Geographic Society is working only with ADC?As far as I know, yes.The Cuban Academy of Sciences?But we're not working with any of them for sure yet. It's just what we areconsidering.If you do, it would be this summer of 2001?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I don't know that that question has been answered, but I think we would like todo it as soon as possible if it does happen. But it's not definite yet.When do you think a decision will actually be made about NationalGeographic going forward with the Cuban Academy of Sciences and ADCto look at this underwater find more closely?I don't know that either. I know that we're seriously considering it though.\"An hour later, Ms. Moffet left this message on my phone's voice mail:\"Linda, it's Barbara Moffet at National Geographic calling back. I don't haveanything else for you, I'm afraid. The principals involved in this project, most arenot here today. But the ones who I have talked with, and my boss, say thenature, the status of this project and the place we are in this project, is still at avery confidential stage. There is nothing else we can release. We don't haveimages to release. I don't even think we have any images or any other phonenumbers. It's just that the information is confidential right now. I'm sorry I can'tbe more helpful, but I hope you are able to do a little bit with what I have givenyou and I am keeping your name and number to inform you once that daycomes. Thanks a lot.\"More Information:REUTERS TEXT ON MAY 15, 1999:\"Explorers comb Cuban seas for treasure, mysteriesBy Andrew CawthorneHAVANA, May 15 (Reuters) Barely touched since the colonial era of piracy andshipwrecks, sea bottoms around Cuba are an underwater fantasy worldpromising treasure-laden sunken ships, insights into times gone by - and maybeeven a lost city.Once a hub for shipments of gold, silver and other plunder from New World toOld, the Caribbean island's waters likely hide billions of dollars' worth oftreasure from hundreds of ships that sank after encountering reefs, storms orpirates.But that is not all that tempts foreign companies, which, in a joint venture withPresident Fidel Castro's government, are beginning an unprecedented, systematicsearch of one of the world's most-fascinating, least-explored undersea regions.As well as gold-laden Spanish galleons, important secrets and insights intoregional history, global environment trends, ancient geography and marinescience also lurk in the depths.\"It's a new frontier,\" enthused Soviet-born Canadian ocean engineer PaulinaZelitsky, from British Columbia-based Advanced Digital Communications,poring over video images of hitherto unseen seafloor taken by underwaterrobots.\"We are the first people to see the bottom of Cuban waters over 50 meters. ...It'sso exciting. We are discovering the influence of currents on global climate,volcanoes, the history of formation of Caribbean islands, numerous historicwrecks and even possibly a sunken city built in the pre-classic period andpopulated by an advanced civilization similar to the early Teotihuacan culture ofYucatan,\" she said."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ADC, the heavyweight among four foreign exploration firms here, was testing itsdeep-water equipment off Havana Bay late last year when its ship, 'Ulises,' foundthe century-old wreck of a U. S. battleship, The Maine, while surveying theseabed.The ship blew up mysteriously in 1898, killing 260 American sailors andtouching off the Spanish-American War.ADC has also been exploring a string of underwater volcanoes about 5,000 feet(1,500 metres) deep off Cuba's western tip, where millions of years ago a strip ofland once joined the island to Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula.LOST CITY OFF WESTERN CUBA?Most intriguingly, researchers using sonar equipment have discovered at a depthof about 2,200 feet (700-800 metres) a huge land plateau with clear images ofwhat appears to be urban development partly covered by sand. From above, theshapes resemble pyramids, roads and buildings.ADC is excited but reluctant to speculate until a joint investigation with theCuban Academy of Sciences and the U. S. National Geographic Society takesplace early this summer.\"It is stunning. What we see in our high-resolution sonar images are limitless,rolling, white sand plains and, in the middle of this beautiful white sand, thereare clear manmade large-size architectural designs. It looks like when you flyover an urban development in a plane and you see highways, tunnels andbuildings,\" Zelitsky said.\"We don't know what it is and we don't have the videotaped evidence of this yet,but we do not believe that nature is capable of producing planned symmetricalarchitecture, unless it is a miracle,\" she added in an interview at her office atTarara, along the coast east of Havana.ADC's deep-water equipment includes a satellite-integrated ocean bottompositioning system, high-precision side-scan double-frequency sonar, andremotely operated submarine robots. They plan to add two submersibles to takepeople down.On the treasure trail, it has already located some 700 target sites where historicwrecks are thought to lie and it recently videotaped and identified three of themas large, 17th century ships with valuable cargo.Bringing up treasure will finance the project. But Zelitsky said, \"Our agenda ismuch broader. We are very anxious about global environmental changes.Archaeology is providing us with the means to conduct broader scientific oceanexploration.\"The other three foreign companies - one Canadian, one French and one SouthAfrican - operate in shallower waters than ADC.
