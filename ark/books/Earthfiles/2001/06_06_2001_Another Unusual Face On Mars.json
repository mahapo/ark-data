Image released by MSSS on May 22, 2000.To find this feature, it is necessary to turn the original MOC image upside down.June 2, 2001 Tempe, Arizona - Unusual surface features on Mars imaged bythe Global Surveyor continue to provoke controversy among scientists andcivilians. One such image looks like a female face taken a year ago in May 2000in the valley of Libya Montes near the Martian equator, but not publicized untilthe New York Post featured the image on May 9 after a press conference byastronomer Tom Van Flandern, Ph.D. and former astronaut Brian O'Leary. Thisweek I discussed the face image with planetary geologist, David Nelson. Mr.Nelson is a Research Specialist in the Department of Geological Sciences atArizona State University in Tempe. His current work is to study the Mars GlobalSurveyor images and to contribute ideas about where the next NASA MarsExcursion landing sites should be in January 2004. Two rovers are planned forthat mission and one likely exploration site will be near sedimentary deposits inthe walls of Valles Marineris, the 3000 mile long canyon that runs near theMartian equator.This color coded map of Mars indicates highestaltitudes in red and lowest in blue. The deep gash of Valles Marineris,lower center, stretches nearly 3000 miles and as much as 6 miles deepalong the Martian equator, the largest canyon in the solar system.The white knobs west of the canyon are the large volcanoes in theTharsis Montes region, including Olympus Mons, the largest volcano"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"in the solar system. The white X marks the general region of Cydonia,site of the controversial 1976 Viking \"face.\" Map courtesy NASA/JPL.I e-mailed Mr. Nelson a jpeg of the female-like face in Libya Montes and askedhim if he and his planetary geology colleagues had seen and discussed it? As Ihave frequently discovered, even scientists officially studying Mars for upcomingmissions have seen only a small percentage of Mars Global Surveyor's more than65,000 images.Interview:David Nelson, M.S., Research Specialist Senior, Dept. of GeologicalSciences, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona: \"This is the first timeI've seen it and no one else has brought it to my attention, so I don't think we areaware of it here. But this looks like it's probably the inside of a valley wallwhere the sort of crown or crest where the hair would be looks like the valleytop, going from a slope to a flat surface. The sort of forehead part would be likethe upper layers of materials or upper strata. And in the bottom half would be asofter material down below and the dunes down below that.What I'm thinking is that this is a windblown, wind-etched interior of a valleywall that just the angle of light and the structure just happens to be very unique.I'm certainly not suggesting anything artificial. I just think it is an interestingperspective on how this thing was formed.YOU WOULD AGREE THAT THIS IS A VERY HAUNTINGFACE-LIKE LOOK, THOUGH?It is intriguing, but I still would be very skeptical that it's created by somebody.IF YOU TAKE THIS LIBYA MONTES FACE AND THE STRANGECYDONIA FACE, IT MAKES MARS SO PROVOCATIVE AT AMEGALITHIC LEVEL. ARE THINGS CARVED ON MARS THATMIGHT NOT BE NATURAL? THAT'S THE QUESTION THAT HASBEEN RAISED?I would be skeptical.THIS LIBYA MONTES FACE IS HOW FAR FROM CYDONIA?Libya Montes is located just about at the equator at about 275 degrees andCydonia is way to the west from that. I would say a couple thousand miles.Easily.The white X marks the general area of the Libya Montes valley region on Mars near theequator(and far east from Cydonia) where the MOC narrow-angle image M02-03051 was taken in2000which includes the female face-like surface feature. Map courtesy NASA/JPL.AS A PERSON LOOKING AT POTENTIAL LANDING SITES, WHAT ISYOUR PERSPECTIVE ABOUT CYDONIA?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Well, the main thing that drives the landing sites right now anyway is safety. Is alanding site going to be safe enough to put down a lander so we don't wreck it?And the second thing is that there has to be a scientific return. Now, a lot ofpeople would argue that if they think the Face is real that an archaeological sitewould obviously be a high priority. The scientific community as a whole,though, is very skeptical about the origin and nature of the Face up in Cydonia.So, it's not by us considered a high priority. So, the other things that come tomind are - since we know very little about the composition of Mars - is we areinterested in the mineralogy of a given landing site. We're interested in lookingfor water and the main driving factor for looking for water is a possibility for life,probably extinct life, looking for fuel and resources that can be used for humanexplorers when we eventually get there. And also, getting us a handle on theclimate of Mars, both now and in the past. So, the main goal for Marsexploration right now is looking for the water. In fact, the theme is called,\"Following the water.\"THE VALLES MARINERIS WOULD BE A LIKELY CANDIDATEBECAUSE THERE ARE SO MANY SEDIMENTARY LAYERS THATARE VISIBLE EVEN IN CURRENT IMAGES?Right. So there is a suggestion that water played a role in the formation of VallesMarineris and the features found there in the past and that would be a goodcandidate.IN TERMS OF LANDING DOWN THERE IN THAT VERY DEEPCANYON, IS THERE ONE PLACE THAT YOU HAVE ISOLATEDTHAT YOU THINK IS SAFER THAN OTHERS AND STILL HASINTERESTING THINGS TO SEE?There is no one place. There are a variety of places. The only problem is that ifwe land in a safe place, does that also mean boring? If it's just flat and no rocks,then we're not going to get a lot out of it. So the other thing we have to consideris: If we have a Rover, can we drive to where it is interesting?Right now, we are very much in the working phases of a lot of these things andthese are exactly the kinds of questions we are trying to answer right now.WHEN DO YOU THINK WILL BE THE NEXT LANDING SITE THATYOU'D BE INVOLVED WITH PICKING A PLACE AND ACTUALLYGETTING SOMETHING THERE?We have a Rover that is going to be launched in 2003. This is the MER, or MarsExcursion Rover, and that is going to be landing at the end of 2003, beginningof 2004, January of 2004. And that's actually two Rovers, two separatemissions.The two Mars 2003 rovers will extend the surface exploration begunby Viking in 1976 and Pathfinder in 1997. These new roverswill be able to travel 100 meters per day and will carry scientific instrumentsto determine the geological context of rocks and soil and measure their chemicalcompositionand fine scale structure, even scraping the surface off rocks to expose their unweatheredinteriors.Recreation courtesy NASA.WHERE WOULD YOU MOST LIKE TO SEE THAT LAND?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"There is a place called Terra Meridiani (also on the equator a little east of VallesMarineris) where there is a mineral formation called hematite. The reason whythat particular mineral is important is that the mineralogists believe that the onlyway you can form that is in a liquid water medium, like in a standing body ofwater. So, if we were to go there, we could potentially be landing on a lake bed.IF YOU WERE LANDING THERE, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THATWE WOULD BE ABLE TO ANALYZE THE HEMATITE AND MAKESOME INFERENCES ABOUT WHETHER H20 WATER HAD BEENTHERE?We would be using a variety of tools. First of all, we would be drilling below thesurface. We are talking about drills that might go as deep as two meters. So,that's about six feet and pulling up minerals, rocks and so on that could beanalyzed on board. And we have things like ovens and chemical analyzers andsomething similar on Pathfinder was an element abundance analyzer. That waywe could get a handle on what the material we are looking at is made of.WHEN WILL IT FINALLY BE CLEAR WHICH EXACTINSTRUMENTS ARE GOING AND WHEN THE EXACT LANDINGSITE WILL BE ANNOUNCED AND THOSE SORT OF DETAILS?They are working on a package of instruments right now that probably will beapproved in the next few months. Because if this is going to be launched in2003, they have to be putting it together pretty soon. And the actually landingsite - we are doing a variety of workshops right now because everyone has theirfavorite site. But I think that's supposed to be determined by the end of this year,early next year.IF THE CYDONIA FACE THAT IS SO CONTROVERSIAL HAS WHATSEEMS TO BE SUCH A REGULAR BOUNDARY AROUND IT - ITALMOST LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING MOLDED, EVEN IN THISMOST RECENT MALIN SPACE SYSTEMS IMAGE. WOULDN'T IT BEA PRIORITY ONCE AND FOR ALL TO GET SOMETHING THERE TOLOOK AT THIS ODD FEATURE AND IF IT WEREARCHAEOLOGICAL, IT WOULD BE WORTH DISCOVERING?It would be neat to go there and find out just to put the question to rest. Butthen you would have to consider how we would do that. If we were to send aRover that we've seen in the past like for the Pathfinder mission - would that beable to answer the question? It would have limited Rover capability. Remember,this structure is over 2 kilometers across, about a mile and a half wide. So, wewould need something that could drive all the way around it, preferably drive upon top of it and either probe into it with some kind of radar system or dig intothe surface with a deep drill.So, we would need to have a very sophisticated Rover in order to be able to dothat. Another possibility would be an airplane or balloon that could fly aroundit and so that way we could get multiple angles and perspectives on thestructure. And then if we wanted to use radar, maybe something from orbitwould be able to penetrate its surface to see if it is made out of rock orsomething else.IN TERMS OF CYDONIA AND THE FACE AND THE SURROUNDINGARTIFACTS BEING THE TARGET FOR ONE OF THE ROVERS THATCOULD DRILL AND ALL THAT, HOW LIKELY DO YOU THINKTHAT COULD BE A TARGET FOR HAVING A ROVER THAT COULDDRILL INTO THE FACE AREA?To be honest, I think it's a pretty low priority because in the workshops I havebeen to it has not been raised as an issue. Now, one of the reasons behind that isthat Cydonia is so far north in latitude. Most of the missions we are proposingare all solar powered, so to get the optimum amount of energy you need to bepretty close to the equator, plus or minus 10 degrees from the equator. So, ifyou consider that, it would knock Cydonia out of hand.IS THERE ANYTHING YOU HAVE TACKED UP ON YOUR WALL OF"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"AN IMAGE ON MARS THAT ESPECIALLY INTERESTS YOU?I guess the main things for me are the outflow channels. They are the mostintriguing.MEANING, ARE THEY WATER OR SOMETHING ELSE?Right. My suspicion is that they are probably water, or some water and CO2combination. It has a lot of implications. If it is water that created thesechannels, it suggests a lot about the past climate on Mars and whether there isliquid under the surface of Mars and whether there is a possibility of waterunderneath the surface of Mars today. If so, then there could be potentialreservoirs of life under the surface of Mars. Again, this is all speculation, butthat's what makes it intriguing for me.\"More Information:Triangular features at 263 degrees West and 79 degrees North near the Martian North Pole.Malin Space Science Systems MOC narrow-angle image M01-02950.David Nelson said about this image, \"These are likely to be barchan dunes,crescent-shaped dunes. We see these types of dunes on Earth in the SaharaDesert. What happens is that the wind is going in one direction prettycontinuously pushing small grains of sand along the ground. When the air hitsan obstacle, it builds up in one place. Wind velocity in the northern polar cap,especially in the winter time, could create pretty significant and constant windsof 60 to 100 miles per hour.\"We b s it e s :http://europa.la.asu.eduArizona State Universityhttp://www.jpl.nasa.gov/pictures/marsJet Propulsion Laboratoryhttp://www.msss.comMalin Space Science Systemshttp://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/marsurv.htmlMars Global SurveyorCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
