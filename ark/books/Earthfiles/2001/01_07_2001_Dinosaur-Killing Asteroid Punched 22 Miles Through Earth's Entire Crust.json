Asteroid, or comet, it punched through 22 milesof the earth's crust and is thought to be the extinction event that annihilatedmore than 75% of all earth life. Map courtesy of marine geophysicist Gail L. Christeson.January 7, 2001 Austin, Texas - Sixty-six million years ago more than 75% ofall living earth creatures died. It was the end of a warm period called Cretaceousand the beginning of another named Tertiary. At that \"K-T boundary,\" asscientists call it, there was a major, worldwide change that exterminated thedinosaurs. Experts have argued about the cause of the global extinction for atleast two centuries. Twenty years ago physicist Luis Alvarez and his geologistson, Walter, reported the discovery of a worldwide layer of clay that has a highiridium content right at the K-T boundary layer in the earth's crust. Iridium israre on earth, but abundant in some comets and asteroids, so the Alvarez teamtheorized that a comet or large asteroid must have hit the earth. When scientistslooked for the greatest concentration of iridium, the data took them to thenorthwestern corner of the Yucatan peninsula in the Gulf of Mexico. There theyfound the massive 60-mile wide underwater crater called Chicxulub nowthought to be the impact site.Scientists have new and startling evidence from seismic technology that showsthe earth's crust below the crater has been shattered and dented inward for 22miles down to the earth's mantle. It's the first time anyone has documented sucha deep impact. Recently at the December meeting of the American GeophysicalUnion in San Francisco, the new seismic data was presented by marinegeophysicist Gail Christeson from the University of Texas at Austin. I asked herhow such a deep puncture in the earth's crust can be defined.Interview:Gail Christeson, Ph.D., Research Associate, Institute for Geophysics,University of Texas at Austin, Texas: \"The Chicxulub impact crater was"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"formed by an impact that was 65 million years ago, but has since been very wellpreserved because it happened in shallow water and there is about a kilometer ofmaterial on top of it of sediment that was laid on top of it in the past 65 millionyears. So, even though it happened that long ago, the structure itself iswell-preserved. We think it is the best preserved large impact crater on the earthtoday.BUT FROM YOUR WORK, ARE YOU SAYING THAT IF ANY OF USCOULD GO UNDER THE WATER THAT WE WOULD BE SEEING AHOLE THAT WENT DOWN 22 MILES?No, the way we look at the structure, we use a seismic technique and it'sbasically the same technique that has been used to look for oil. There are twodifferent kinds, types of seismic techniques that we use: One is called seismicreflection and that's where you send a sound source into the earth and itbounces back and you get an image of the crust. And from that image, we cansee deformation and faults that go through the entire crust that we think arerelated to this impact.Two, and the other technique we use is called seismic refraction and that's wherewe do the same thing. We send sound into the earth, but we have receivers thatare located both close to the source and far away. And from that we get apicture of the velocity structure underneath the earth. That's what I've beenlooking at to see what's happened at the base of the crust from the impact.Line drawing of seismic reflection profile showing deep crustal faulting.Also shown is position of Moho (crust-mantle boundary) showing relief associated withcrustal deformation.Graphic courtesy Gail Christeson.THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE PRESENTED IN THE PAPER THAT THEIMPACT 66 MILLION YEARS AGO PENETRATED THE CRUST OFTHE EARTH DOWN 22 MILES, RIGHT?Yeah, the impact itself. It didn't remove material that deep, but faulting relatedto the impact did penetrate through the entire crust. It hit and was pulverizedand didn't remain a coherent object crashing through the crust. It's somethingthat kind of spread out, the shock waves from it spread out over a much largerarea and that's what caused most of the damage.Further out, we see underneath the ground, we see faulting that is out to 200kilometers diameter (121 miles) and these are the faults that go through theentire earth, the entire crust. So, from the ground all the way down 35kilometers (22 miles) to the base of the crust. And associated with thisdeformation, we see faulting down at the crust/mantle interface.MEANING LIKE IT'S SUNK IN?Yeah. Well, you see the faulting, inwards faulting, and where that comes in itlooks like the crust/mantle interface is depressed. And then inward of that at theepicenter of the crater it looks like the crust/mantle interface is uplifted a bit.And the 200 kilometer outer ring, we call it, seems to be equivalent to what we"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"see on the moon or other planets. The largest craters are called multi-ringedbasins like Orientale on the moon. So, this is the first time where we can seewhat this outer ring looks like underneath the other dimension. So, the faultingthat is linked all the way down to the crust/mantle interface will help usunderstand these other craters on the moon and Venus.IT IS EQUIVALENT TO THROWING SOMETHING REALLY HARDLET'S SAY AT ADOBE AND IT HITS AND ENTERS THE ADOBE ANDCRACKS FAR OUT WHERE IT HAS HIT?Right. The deformation extends much further than the actual excavation.HOW BIG AN OBJECT WAS THIS THING THAT COULD GO SODEEPLY AND CAUSE SO MUCH VIOLENCE IN THE CRUST?We think it was about 10 kilometers in size.THAT'S ABOUT 6 MILES.Ye s .TEXAS AND THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES - WOULD ALL OFTHAT AREA HAVE BEEN EXCAVATED BY THIS OBJECT COMING IN66 MILLION YEARS AGO?No, the part that is excavated is actually quite small, but the environmentalconsequences are very large because what would happen is, first of all, the heatof this large body traveling through the atmosphere would heat up theatmosphere and cause a fireball. So, you would have a burning of forests,certainly in Texas and across North America. So, first of all you have this heat.Then the material from the crater that is brought up into the atmosphere wouldchange the chemical composition and it actually ends up causing global cooling,the sulfur that is released. So, for about 10 years, it was quite a bit colder than ithad been.WAS THE SKY NEARLY DARK FROM ALL OF THIS?Yeah, I guess it's like what people call nuclear winter. So, that happened andlasted for about a decade where you have it much cooler. And then you haveglobal warming after that on top of the global cooling from all the CO2 that wasput in the atmosphere, the greenhouse effect. So, it's very hot. Then it's cold forabout a decade. And then it's warm for about a thousand, 2000 years. So, it's allof these effects together is what we think led to the extinction of the dinosaursand all the other extinctions that happened at the K-T boundary.DO YOU HAVE NOW SOME KIND OF 3-D GRAPHICINTERPRETATION OF THAT HOLE YOU'VE DONE FROM RADARIN A COMPUTER?Well, we're still working on the full picture, but we can see some 3-D structures.We see the uplift. You can imagine this impact comes in and it removes a lot ofmaterial and so the material that is deeper down is uplifted in response. So now,we are getting a picture of what that uplift looks like and even all the way downto the crust/mantle boundary in 3 dimensions.THE FORCE THAT IT WOULD TAKE TO LIFT THE MATERIAL 22MILES DOWN UP, IS THERE ANY COMPARISONS YOU CAN MAKETHAT WOULD HELP PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT KIND OFFORCE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT?What the press release said is that it's a force that makes a nuclear blast seemlike a firecracker. Because the amount of energy that's in a nuclear blast, thosetypes of meteorites enter the atmosphere quite often, but they are not big enoughto penetrate the atmosphere. So, these are really big events.IS ANYONE SPECULATING ABOUT WHETHER A COMET COULDDO THIS, OR WHETHER IT HAS TO BE SOMETHING EXTREMELYSTONY OR MADE OF IRON?People do, there is some controversy over whether it was an asteroid, meteoriteor comet, and that issue is still not resolved."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"YOU DO NOT YET HAVE A CORE SAMPLING DEEP ENOUGH FROMWHATEVER THE OBJECT WAS THAT MIGHT STILL BE THERE?Well, the problem is that the object itself is pulverized, so what remains is notthe object. What people do look at is things like the iridium layer that is foundthroughout the earth from this impact. They look at that and based on theiridium that's found, some people say it has to be a comet based on that. Butother people have found a little piece of a meteorite at the K/T Boundary andshow that as proof that it had to be a meteorite.MEANING THAT IT WAS MADE OUT OF IRON AS OPPOSED TOWHAT?Yeah, a comet is more...ICY SNOW BALL, BUT IT COULD HAVE DUST AND ROCK IN ACOMET, I THINK.Yeah, I think that's why it's still up in the air as to whether it was a comet or not.WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP OF IRIDIUM TO COMETS?Iridium isn't found on earth in the same quantities and ratios that you find in acomet or asteroid.THERE'S MORE FROM EXTRATERRESTRIAL OBJECTS?Ye a h .WHAT HAS BEEN THE MOST SURPRISING ASPECT OF DOINGTHIS RESEARCH FOR YOU PERSONALLY AS A MARINEGEOPHYSICIST?I think what surprised me the most about this research is that the faulting that weobserved that extends throughout the entire crust down to the crust/mantleinterface and seems to actually have affected the topography at that interface byseveral kilometers is definitely what surprised me the most.WHY WOULD THAT SURPRISE YOU?I guess that most processes that I've worked with are of a much smaller scale. So,to see something that has effected the entire crust is...ALL THE WAY DOWN 22 MILES.Yeah, it's exciting and surprising.THAT IS A HORRENDOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY RELEASED.Yeah, well, it gives you an idea of what happened to the dinosaurs.WHY IT CAUSED EXTINCTION.Yeah, and not just the dinosaurs, but all the other life on earth. Most of it waswiped out.\"More Information:Other Research:Gail Christeson: \"It's kind of a strange environment where it hit, a shallowunderwater sea. So, people ended up finding it by kind of zeroing in, by lookingat how thick these impact layers were. They are thickest around North America,Central America. They started looking around there. It actually shows up in thegravity signature over the Yucatan, it's a circular structure that people nowrealize is from that impact.You can measure very precisely the gravity and if you're over something hard,you actually have more gravity than over something soft. And with the craterbecause you have this big hole that was in-filled with soft sediment, you get thecircular structure."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The colors show the gravity field over the impact crater.

People are going to drill in certain spots on the craterand what you want to look at is the material that was replaced from the impactand see what's beneath that as well. Because the more we can tell about whatwas there helps us understand better in the modeling about the environmentalconsequences.\"More Information:In 2001, an international team of scientists plans to drill a deep hole into theChicxulub crater.Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
