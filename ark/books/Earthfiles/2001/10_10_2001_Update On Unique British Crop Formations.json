Aerial photograph© 2001 by Nick Nicholson, Editor, The Circular Review. October 10, 2001 Wakerley, Leicestershire, England - Nick Nicholson,Editor of The Circular Review in Calverton, Nottinghamshire, discovered anunusual crop formation in barley on Sunday, June 3, at Wakerley village nearBarrowden, England. Nick's first e-mail to me with a ground photograph said: \"Ifound a major formation near our last year's hunting ground between Morcottand Seaton in Leicestershire County.\"He's referring to a year ago on June 6, 2000 when Nick found another unusualformation in barley near Seaton southwest of Wakerly village and Barrowden.Biophysicist W. C. Levengood was involved in the Seaton research andconcluded that formation was defined by barley plants that stood at least sixinches shorter than the rest of the crop, an example of controlled and veryspecific retarded growth. The implication was that some kind of energy touchedthe growing barley in the pattern at least a month before the formation wasdiscovered in the Seaton field.Seaton Formation, June 6, 2000"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"June 6, 2000 barley field near Seaton, Leicestershire, England where delicate patternwas defined by plants six inches shorter than the rest of the field.Photograph © 2000 by Nick Nicholson.Diagram of Seaton 2000 formation© 2000 by Nick Nicholson.Barley plants six inches shorter than rest of field defined the delicate pattern of circlesdiscovered at Seaton, Leicestershire, U.

It's made up of an outer ring I estimate to be 120 feet in diameterand in the middle of the standing crop is a 10-12 foot diameter circlesurrounded by a narrow ring. In between the inner and outer rings are a lot oflines and patterns which are hard to ascertain the exact design, but it sure looksgood. Attached is ground image which I took. Waiting for aerial.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Discovered June 3, 2001 in barley in Wakerley village near Barrowden, Leicestershire,England.120 feet in diameter. Photograph © 2001 by Nick Nicholson.At the top of this report is the aerial that Nick later got. Along with thebeautifully detailed photograph, he sent me the following written report: \"I hadarranged to have a meeting of the local East Midlands Crop Circle Study Groupand on the afternoon of Sunday, June 3, 2001, we all sat down in the kitchen ofJane Bertrams house at Grimston near Melton Mowbray. A guest of Jane's, Iris,suggested we start the meeting with a meditation which we all agreed to do.After a few minutes this was terminated and we all were asked what we hadperceived. When it came to my turn, I said all I could see during the meditationwas swirling crop and then thought no more about it.\"When the meeting ended, I asked the others if they would be interested incoming to last year's area to look around (the site of the retarded growth patterndiscussed in Earthfiles June 6, 2001). Bearing in mind that last year in June wehad gone out as a group, at my suggestion, expecting to see three known cropcircles, but in the process of looking, found two brand new ones. So, I hadexpectancy of new discoveries that Sunday, June 3, 2001.\"However, everyone had other arrangements. So, I went alone. This was about 4p.m. on a lovely sunny afternoon and off I went down through Melton Mowbrayto pick up the A-47 Leicester to Peterborough Road, crossing it at Morcott.Nothing there. So, down the hill past Seaton. Still nothing around. So, I headedfor Wakerley village and up to the highest point beyond the church, found a pullin and got out of my car. I climbed the verge on the opposite side of the road (ahigh point) and looked to my left (West). To my amazement, there sat a circleabout a quarter of a mile away.Barrowden and Wakerley village are circled in red.Seaton is circled in black where the odd 2000 formation consistedof barley plants six inches shorter than rest of crop."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\"This discovery left me almost speechless and very excited. After all, inexpectancy and all the driving around had left me with spirits at a low ebb. Andso unexpectedly seeing this glyph so close was quite overwhelming. As I baskedin the warm glow of this turn of events, I heard the sound of a motor cycle overthe hedge and then a rider and vehicle exited the field. The young man crossedthe road on his machine and stopped near to my car. Calling out to him, Iengaged him in conversation and ascertained that he was not aware of theformation prior to this time. He was in fact the son of a local farmer. He alsoinformed me that if I followed his directions, a better view of that field would beavailable to me.\"This I did and within a couple of minutes was standing on the road opposite theformation which had a windmill on the horizon acting as a marker. However,despite the fact that the design was on sloping ground opposite me, it was notsloping enough to give me more than a tantalizing view of its composition. Evenusing binoculars, all I could make out was a series of dashes across the circlerather like perforations. I found that there was a road that ran across the top ofthe field, but this afforded no view at all. I should have been more audaciousand ventured in, but the foot-and-mouth disease was still in full swing and Ichickened out. (Police and farmers were patrolling fields, even with guns.)Subsequently because of the meditation, many people thought this formationwas for me.\"We b s it e s :http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/column/review.html(The Circular Review)Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
