The bright, white central light sourcewas produced by a huge X-ray flare thought to have occurred near ablack hole at the center of our galaxy approximately 93 million miles in diameter.Chandra X-ray image courtesy NASA/MIT/F. Baganoff et al.September 7, 2001 Cambridge, Massachusetts - MIT scientists have detectedfor the first time a rapid X-ray flare at the center of our Milky Way Galaxy nearwhat is thought to be a supermassive black hole. The observation was onOctober 26-27, 2000, but not reported until the September 6, 2001 issue ofNature. The lead author, MIT's Frederick Baganoff, said, \"This is extremelyexciting because it's the first time we have seen in our own neighborhood asupermassive black hole devour a chunk of material. This signal comes fromcloser to the event horizon of our Galaxy's supermassive black hole than anythat we have ever received before. It's as if the material sent us a postcard beforeit fell in.\"The scientists report that in only minutes, the galactic region known asSagittarius A+ became \"45 times brighter in X-rays before declining to pre-flarelevels a few hours later. At the peak of the flare, the X-ray intensity dramaticallydropped by a factor of five within just a 10-minute interval. This constrains thesize of the emitting region to be no larger than about twenty times the size of the'event horizon,'\" which is the so-called membrane around a black hole predictedby Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. \"The rapid variations in X-ray intensityindicate that we are observing material that is as close to the black hole as theEarth is to the Sun,\" said Gordon Gamire of Penn State University, principalinvestigator of the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) which wasused in these observations.So, even though Chandra and other telescopes cannot photograph the theorizedblack hole itself, the fact that X-ray emissions increased so intensely and rapidlyis consistent with the model of matter falling into a supermassive black hole.This new evidence is seen as more confirmation that a black hole sits at thecenter of our Milky Way Galaxy and its diameter is estimated to be the distancebetween Earth and our sun, about 93 million miles. Further studies in infrared"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and radio wavelengths indicate the presence of a large, dark object having a massof about three million of our suns.The scientists say that the energy released in the flare imaged by Chandracorresponds to something with the mass of a comet dragged into the black hole.Or, this flare could have been caused by the reconnection of magnetic field linesjust outside the event horizon, similar to phenomenon responsible for solarflares on our sun, but on a much greater scale.In either scenario, the energy released would be accompanied by shock wavesthat accelerated the electrons near the black hole to nearly the speed of light,leading to the outburst of X-rays.\"It's truly remarkable that we could identify and track this flare in such acrowded region of space,\" said Mark Bautz of MIT. \"This discovery would nothave been possible without the resolution and sensitivity of Chandra and theACIS instrument.\"False color image to enhance central flare region at Sagittarius A+.Chandra X-ray image courtesy NASA/MIT/F.
