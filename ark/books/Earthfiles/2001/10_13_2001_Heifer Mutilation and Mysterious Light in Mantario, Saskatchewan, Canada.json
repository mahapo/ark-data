He has ranched there his wholelife and added cattle to his business fifteen years ago. He had heard aboutanimal mutilations where ears, eyes, tongues, jaw flesh, genitals and rectal tissuehave been excised from thousands of animals worldwide since the mid-1950s.But until August 16th, he had never seen one on his own property.It started with a sick heifer. That morning he called his vet because she wasstanding with her head down and eyes closed and wouldn't respond to his voice.The vet suggested that she might be dehydrated and asked Bill Francis to put atube down her throat and pour about 5 gallons of water every hour for three orfour hours. He did that and she never protested or even moved. She just groundher teeth while he pushed the tube down her throat. He left her to fix fence andreceived a call from a neighbor about another heifer down.Interview:Bill Francis, Rancher, Mantario, Saskatchewan, Canada: \"We went outthere and I said to my son, 'What's wrong with these heifers? They are actingreally strange.' They had all their heads up in the air and kind of looking off inone direction.We went out to find this heifer. And in the meantime by the water trough, I hadto fix a piece of fence. And these other heifers came around us. They were reallyspooky. They almost ran over us, in fact."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"LIKE THEY WERE TRYING TO RUN AWAY FROM SOMETHING?They were just scared. They weren't trying to run from anything really. Theywere just milling around and scaring each other even. They were that spooked.And it was odd because we had been feeding them every day for a couple ofweeks.So, anyways, we fixed the fence there and then we went over to see the deadone. And I thought, to lose two in one day wasn't very good because I hadn't lostany for months. I thought maybe there was something wrong. And as soon as Idrove up to it, I said, 'This thing has been mutilated.'THIS WAS THE SAME HEIFER YOU WERE TRYING TO FORCEFEED THE WATER INTO?No, this was inside the fence. The other one (sick) was outside the fence.YOU'VE GOT A SECOND ONE THAT IS DOWN AND MUTILATED.Ye a h .CAN YOU TELL ME FIRST ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY WAS TAKEN?The lips and tongue and the genitals and uterus and the two front teats.THE TWO FRONT TEATS OF THE UDDER?Ye a h .WERE THEY CUT FLAT TO THE BAG OR CORED INTO THE BAG?Cut flat. In fact when they cut it, they just sliced the skin on the bag and the flapof skin was still hanging there.WAS THERE ANY BLOOD?No blood at all.DID THAT SEEM UNUSUAL TO YOU?Oh, yeah.HOW WOULD YOU CUT TEATS OFF WITHOUT THEIR BEINGBLOOD?Yeah, the whole thing was strange. We've butchered lots of animals and there isno, I don't know how you would do it without blood.WHAT ABOUT THE VAGINAL AND RECTAL AREA?The cuts were the same. I call it stepped, kind of.Drawing of the cuts on the mutilated heifer discovered onAugust 16, 2001 in Mantario, Saskatchewan, Canada.Drawing © 2001 by Bill Francis.THEY WERE GONE?Everything was gone and it was so clean and neat in there. Like the other fellowwas trying to tell me it was animals, and I said, 'Well, they could never do a joblike that.' It was just like a cylinder had been in there.WAS THERE JUST A CLEAN HOLE ALSO HAD TAKEN OUT THE"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"RECTUM AND THE VAGINA?Yeah, the uterus and all that was gone.A CLEAN HOLE.Ye a h .Bill Francis did not take any photographs, but here is an exampleof vaginal and rectal tissue removed in deep, bloodless holefrom cow found October 14, 1975 near Sterling, Colorado.Udder also removed with a hide-deep scalloped pattern.1974 Polaroid photograph by Logan County Sheriff Tex Graves.I'VE SEEN MANY PHOTOGRAPHS LIKE THAT BEFORE. ANYBLOOD AT ALL?None. No blood anywhere.THE GROUND WAS DRY?Yeah, bone dry.WAS HER TAIL INTACT?Ye a h .SHE WAS LAYING ON HER SIDE. DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHINGELSE UNUSUAL ABOUT HER?I did notice was that her (mutilated heifer) mouth was open. I've done taxidermyfor years and I know that any dead animal they bring, the mouth is alwaysclosed. So, the vet was at my neighbor's two days later and he asked her, 'Whenthese animals die, do they die with their mouths open or closed?' She said, 'Theyare always closed.' He said, 'Well, that's odd because this one has its mouthopen.'She said that rigor mortis causes them to close and they always close. She saidthey must have done something to it to keep the mouth open.So I went and checked on it (the dead heifer) and after four days, it started toclose. And after about eight days, it was fully closed.HOW FAR OPEN WAS THE MOUTH WHEN YOU FIRST FOUND IT?It was probably four inches. The front teeth were about 4 inches apart.YOU NOW YOU HAVE THIS ANIMAL THAT IS DEAD CLEARLYWITH THE CLASSIC MUTILATION CUTS. NOW, ON THE ONE THATYOU HAD LEFT TRYING TO FORCE FEED WATER, HOW DID YOUFIND HER? HAD SHE COLLAPSED ON TO HER KNEES? WAS SHEON HER SIDE?My son found her and she was laying on her side. Nothing was missing from her.the only thing was that she was grinding her teeth when I tried to get the tube inher mouth.WHAT IS PECULIAR IS THAT YOU WOULD END UP WITH THE"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"ONE CLASSICALLY MUTILATED HEIFER INSIDE THE PASTURETHE SAME DAY THAT YOU WERE TRYING TO FORCE FEEDWATER TO A COW THAT JUST STOOD THERE IN A STUPOR WITHHER EYES CLOSED.Yeah, it was really strange.AS IF PERHAPS WHATEVER IT WAS THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THEMUTILATION, THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME INTERACTIONWITH THAT OTHER COW AS WELL?Yeah, I'm assuming there was.THE ENTIRE HERD OF HOW MANY ANIMALS?160.ALL OF THE OTHER 160 HERD, THEY WERE ALL VERY UPSETAND GOING AROUND WITH THEIR HEADS IN THE AIR AND VERYSKITTISH AND SCARED.Yeah, they were.HOW LONG DID THE COWS STAY THAT SCARED?It took a few days. Probably 4 or 5 days.FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY CALM DOWN?Ye a h .Mysterious Light In The Sky A Week LaterDID ANY OF YOUR NEIGHBORS REPORT SEEING ANYTHINGUNUSUAL IN THE SKY?No.NO LIGHTS?Well, I saw a strange light about a week later. I was still baling and I have tobale at night to get enough moisture to make a bale. And I was coming backprobably at 4 in the morning and I thought I saw a falling star. It was big andreally bright and it came straight down and then just before it got to the ground,it stopped. And it started to flash. The light started to flash. And then it wentdown behind the hill really slowly.WHEN IT STOPPED, DID IT CHANGE ANY COLOR AT ALL?Nope.IT STAYED WHITE, BUT WHEN YOU SAID IT FLASHED, WHATHAPPENED?It just started flashing the light and then it went down really slowly out of sight.WHEN IT FLASHED, DO YOU MEAN IT WENT OFF AND ON?Ye a h .WAS THERE LIKE EVERY SECOND, OR A COUPLE OF FLASHES?Oh, it was quite... there would be 2 or 3 a second, quite fast.FAST PULSES.

Or even right there. I"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"didn't know for sure.DID YOU HAVE THE ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE ORANY LAW ENFORCEMENT COME OUT TO INVESTIGATE THEUNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS?I phoned them, but they wouldn't come.WHY?They didn't want to. They said first of all, it was probably just some kids. And Isaid, 'Well, I don't think so. For one thing, it's in the middle of nowhere. It's in ahollow and there aren't many kids around here, that's one thing.' There is noway.And then I had the inspector for brands because I happened to be talking to theAgriculture Rep and I told her. She told this inspector for the brands. And hetold me, 'Well, it was probably lightning that killed her.' And insects. And I said,'I don't think so.' I said, 'We haven't had lightning for a month. We're in themiddle of a drought. And it was not insects, I know that for sure.' He said, 'Well,we had some sent in and that's what they told us.'IN YOUR OWN MIND, WHAT DO YOU THINK COULD BEINVOLVED?Well, I think it's aliens.YOU DO BECAUSE?No other explanation that I can think of. Because nobody else can do this. Mypasture was a new pasture, too. A 4-wire fence. There was only one gate. Notracks. And everything about it I don't know how they killed it either. No blood.I don't know anybody that can do it nice and neat. Even if it did bleed, youcouldn't wipe the blood off well enough to cover it all up. And also, I talked toa fellow a week later who had one the same night as I did.ON THE AUGUST 16TH?Yeah, about 30 miles south of me. (Near Empress, Alberta) I'm right on theborder. It would be a little bit southwest.WHAT DID HE FIND?The same thing, except they took all four teats and the one was cut deep into thebag.\"More Information:Please see my books and documentaries concerning the unusual animalmutilation phenomenon in the Earthfiles Shop.An Alien HarvestGlimpses of Other Realities, Volumes I and IIA Strange Harvest (video)Strange Harvests 1993 (video)Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Refund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
