K. south of Andover. Crop formationshistoricallyfirst appeared in Hampshire and have continued to evolve repeatedly at places such as theChilbolton Observatory, Goodworth Clatford, Middle Wallop, and Danebury Fort.Chilbolton Observatory, a British government-owned facility, was originally constructed in1965to study radio wave propagations from space and satellites. The Observatory is off limitsfrom the public.The wheat field that runs along its boundary, as shown in above photograph, is privatelyownedand operated by the Leckford Estate.

Thewheat in which the formations appeared is owned by the local Leckford Estateand by Wednesday, August 29, the Estate had cut down the \"face\" and \"binarycode\" in its normal wheat harvest.The Chilbolton Observatory is now primarily focused on weather radar research.It is also studying higher frequency millimetric radio waves in the gigahertzrange. Britain hopes to open up more of the those higher, shorter radiofrequencies for commercial use to help relieve congestion in the lower frequencybandwidths.Since crop formations have appeared repeatedly in the field next to the radiotelescope, I wondered if the Chilbolton Observatory had any involvement withthe Arecibo radio telescope's 1974 transmission into space toward the Messier13 star cluster. To learn more about the history and current work of theObservatory, I talked with Darcy Ladd, Chilbolton Observatory StationManager. Mr. Ladd received is Master of Applied Science degree in ElectricalEngineering from the University of Ottawa, Canada and has been working atChilbolton since 1994. First, I asked him to confirm the dates that he and hiscolleagues at Chilbolton became aware of the \"face\" and \"code\" in the wheat.The \"binary code\" on the left and \"face\" to the right in the wheat field nearChilbolton Observatory between Andover and Stockton, Hampshire, U. K. were noticedby observatory staff on different dates. Aerial photograph © 2001 by Steve Alexander. Interview:Darcy Ladd, Station Manager, Chilbolton Observatory, Chilboltonbetween Wherwell and Stockton south of Andover, Hampshire, England: \"Ithink chronologically, the face appeared first on Tuesday, the 14th of August.That was when we first noticed it.How did you notice it since it was so flat in the wheat field?I think from one of our experimental cabins which is sort of close to theperimeter fence. You can go up on the roof. You could see there was a sort ofdisturbance in the crop, but you couldn't get sufficiently high to see what it was.So you knew something was there, but you did not know what it was?That's right. It did seem to have sort of a square pattern to it, so it didn't just looklike windblown crop.Did you get in touch with the ministry of Defence of the police to ask themto fly over it and see what it was?I didn't myself. And I'm not aware that anyone else did either."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"How did you become aware it was a face?I think what we did do was look on the internet. There is a fair amount ofoverhead traffic where we are anyway. And we had seen aircraft flying over. Ithink it was suspected that somebody had flown over with the deliberate attemptto photograph it. So we kept an eye on the internet doing searches andeventually it did show up. I'm not aware that anyone from this Chilbolton siteinformed anyone official of its presence.The other one, the digital message, was observed the following Monday, August20. There is no one here on site on Saturday and Sunday, so there is no way toconfirm which night or which morning it exactly first appeared.But the formations were a week apart and the face was first and then camethe code.That's right.Have any of you at Chilbolton Observatory studied the code in the fieldand compared it to the 1974 Arecibo transmission?I've seen a picture of the Arecibo transmission. Nobody recognized it until it wasfirst put on the web. Then I think someone said it was related to the transmissionfrom Arecibo (November 16, 1974.) So, I think somebody on site here went tothe SETI web page and found a copy of the original transmission. Then, I guesswe did do some qualitative comparison.Is all of the wheat field and observatory government-owned land?No, it's not. The Observatory is on government-owned land, but the field inwhich the crop circles were discovered is owned by Leckford Estate which isprivately owned. The Observatory is right on the boundary. Across the fence, itis privately owned land.When the observatory was built in 1965, what was its primary work?It was built for radio wave propagation studies.What was the observatory's main focus back then?They were using radio stars as sources of radio frequencies to study theinteraction through the atmosphere.Of radio signals coming from stars to here?Yes. They weren't interested in the radio stars themselves. They were interestedin the interaction of the radio frequency energy passing through the layers of theatmosphere. The principal aim was to study the effects that communicationsatellites would undergo, communication with satellites in space.Did Chilbolton send out transmissions?No. In those days, it was simply a receiving station. It could look at bothcelestial sources or terrestrial sources.By 1974 when Cornell University was at Arecibo and Carl Sagan and hiscolleagues were organizing that binary code transmission about humansand earth that went toward Messier 13, was Chilbolton Observatoryinvolved at that time?At that time, I think the 25 foot antennae had begun to be used for weatherradar. It was no longer principally involved in looking at space.But it had always had a capacity to receive signals from space?Yes, it would always depend upon which receiver equipment was installed.But essentially that has been the nature of Chilbolton Observatory - to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"receive signals from space?It's used now as a weather radar, so it does actually transmit. But it's never beenused for communications. When it was listening to radio stars, it was justlooking at the magnitude of the signal and seeing how that changed through theinteraction of rain and clouds and the ionosphere. And now it's used as a radar,so we're beaming pulses of energy out and listening for the return echoes.That is what you are doing now?That's what we do now.It's interesting that from its inception in 1965 to this day Chilbolton haseither been listening to space or sending into space and listening forreturns.It's radio wave studies.Is the only work that Chilbolton Observatory is doing now weather radar?Weather radar and other related propagation studies.Is that for the Ministry of Defence?No. It's commercial research. We are a government laboratory. Basically we dowork on a contract basis for various agencies within the U. K. I think the RadioCommunication Agency is one of our principal funders.What does the Radio Communication Agency do?They would be in a similar role to your department of communications (FederalCommunications Commission- FCC). They effectively license and monitor theuse of radio frequencies in the U. K. If anybody wants to set up a radio system,they need to get licensing and approval from the Radio Communication Agency.How does Chilbolton fit into those licensing processes?We're the research side. We use the weather radar to study the effect of rain andother sort of weather-related atmospheric elements on radio wave propagation.We're mainly interested in millimetric frequencies, a lot of frequency bands notyet in use, but it's foreseen that they will be in the near future, once technologyis suitably advanced to make them commercially viable.A millimeter wave is ...?Effectively in a gigahertz, from 10 gigahertz to 100 gigahertz.The idea would be that if you can use millimetric radio waves, you canexpand the amount of radio frequency space that can be usedcommercially?That's right. You can sort of put more information effectively into the radiospectrum. The bands that we use now are heavily congested, so rather than tellpeople that they have to stop using a particular band, the government is trying toopen up new bands higher out (beyond meter and centimeter wavelengths).What has prevented the gigahertz use up to now?It's the technology and the cost. I think it's much more complex and difficult andexpensive to build the equipment that would be required.I think a lot of people assume the Office of Science and Technology is underthe thumb of government intelligence. Is there any connection withintelligence?Not that I'm aware. I think we're getting into political intrigue.When somebody says Chilbolton Observatory reports to the Ministry ofDefence, it makes one wonder why?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I think people have sort of misconstrued our presence here. We're fairly openabout what we do. There is nothing secret that goes on here. Some of it might beproprietary because it's being paid for by companies, but there is nothing secretthat goes on here.Who is your parent agency in the Office of Science and Technology?Our parent agency is the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory.What does Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory do?It's a government laboratory. They do a lot of, all sorts of things. You want tofind out more about it, go to the web page at http://www.cclrc.ac.uk.
