Photograph © 2001 by Linda Moulton Howe.October 6, 2001 New York City - Thursday I went to New York's Ground Zerowith an attorney who represents some of Manhattan's fire and policemen. Weheard on the radio driving in that a Russian airliner had blown up in the airbetween Israel and Russia. When we reached the Holland Tunnel, it wasopening for the first time, and every car and driver was being stopped in onelane controlled by armed police who wanted to see a photo I.D. before allowingcars to enter the tunnel. When our turn came to proceed forward, we wereamazed to travel that long tunnel under the river completely alone, no other carsin front or behind. Usually, it is packed with cars and trucks.The Holland Tunnel comes out in Manhattan at the south end and as weapproached Canal Street a few blocks north of Ground Zero, we hit asuffocating odor of burning tires, burning electrical wires and burned flesh, allmixed together. The air stung my eyes, nose, throat and lungs."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"New York Police monitoring all the streets around Ground Zero and working shoulder-to-shoulderwith National Guard to examine photo I.D.s at check points to control who goes in and outof the gigantic crime scene. Photograph © 2001 by Linda Moulton Howe.Military personnel in desert storm fatigues were everywhere. So were New Yorkpolice, FBI and other government intelligence agencies. I learned that the CIA,Secret Service, ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) had offices near the WorldTrade towers and have files and equipment underground that the agencies areeager to get back if still preserved. Underground storage below the two towerswent down eight stories where even diamonds and gold were vaulted.We had to pass through check points of military and police and show photoI.D.s to get to offices and apartments near Ground Zero. Some stores south ofCanal Street are trying to open, but there are big signs that say, \"Cash Only\"because there are no phones or credit card processing ability.I talked to a mail man who said that there were huge piles of undelivered mailaddressed to the trade tower offices.In the attorney's building that overlooks a section of Ground Zero, a loudmachine was monitoring air quality. Everyone is concerned about the acrid air.Even though it's been nearly a month since Terrible September 11th, smoke isstill billowing up from Ground Zero. The size of the catastrophe isoverwhelming when you stand in front of it and the awful, burning odor willprobably persist for months to come. The heat and ash dust killed all the grass atbuildings around the trade towers. As we left the Ground Zero check point inour car, the police used high pressure sprayers to wash off the tires. I wonderedwhy our boots weren't washed off as well.Clearly, local and federal officials are very concerned about contaminants -whether toxins burning in the air or from aerosols deliberately poisoned withgerms or chemicals."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Until September 11th, the list of terrorist attacks on Americans included:- the October 1983 suicide bombing of the Marines in Beirut, Lebanon. Morethan 240 died.- The bombing of Pan Am 103. 189 Americans died.- The bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building.- The bombing of U. S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.- The attack on the U. S. S. Cole.- The first World Trade Center bombing.Who was most responsible for killing Americans in the international attacks?The answer, according to Larry Johnson, former State Department DeputyDirector for Anti-Terrorism from 1989 to 1993, is Imad Mughniyah, theHezbollah security chief. Today, Mr. Johnson is Managing Director of BERGAssociates in Washington, D. C., a firm that specializes in financialinvestigations and corporate security. Larry Johnson thinks that behind theSeptember 11th attack is a link between Mughniyah and Osama bin Laden.Interview:Larry Johnson, Managing Director, BERG Associates (Business ExposureReduction Group), Washington, D. C. \"When you look at who has beendoing the killing, Imad Mughniyah, the Hezbollah security chief, is a suspect atthe top of the list. And what became even more troublesome was at the start ofthe trial a year ago in New York City for the bombing of the U. S. embassies inKenya and Tanzania, one of the defendants, Allie Muhammad, who had been inthe U. S. Army, an Egyptian, pled guilty. And in his plea agreement, he testifiedthat he helped to arrange a meeting between Osama bin Laden, ImadMughniyah.He also testified that Iran was providing weapons, explosives and training to binLaden. That was the first direct, public link between bin Laden and the Iraniansand Mughniyah. And Mughniyah's significance, according to Allie Muhammad,was that bin Laden viewed Mughniyah as an inspirational figure, a mentor.Someone who demonstrated that you could use violence against U. S. targetsand compel a change in U. S. policy. In the case of Mughniyah, his attacks leadto the U. S. to withdraw its forces and presence from Lebanon. So, therefore,someone like bin Laden sees a similar opportunity in using this violence to drivethe United States out of Saudi Arabia.IF THERE IS THIS HISTORY OF A MENTORSHIP BETWEENMUGHNIYAH OF THE IRANIAN HEZBOLLAH AND OSAMA BINLADEN, WHY IS IT THAT THERE HAS NOT BEEN MUCHDISCUSSION BOTH BY ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS, OR EVENTHE AMERICAN MEDIA, ABOUT MUGHNIYAH AND THEHEZBOLLAH IN CONNECTION TO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN NEWYORK AND WASHINGTON?The simple answer is that it's basic cowardice. People who put political successahead of just pushing for what I would call the truth. To go after Mughniyahrequires taking some very hard steps regarding Iran and Syria and Saudi Arabia.Saudi Arabia is one of those countries, and the United Arab Emirates is thesecond, that we've really been unwilling to confront over the issue of theirsupport for those organizations, Hezbollah in particular. Consequently becausewe are so concerned about our oil dependence and not roiling the waters andnot wanting to make it a primary issue, we've just allowed it to slip through thecracks over the years."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I don't want to leave anybody with the illusion that it's going to be easy to getthe Iranians to give up Mughniyah. But there comes a point where you draw aline in the sand and you say this remains an ultimate affront to the security ofthe United States.Listen, before September 11th, people said, 'OK, you've had 300 or 400 peopledie and we'll just have to learn to live with that.' Well, no longer. We're now in acompletely different plane.YOU ARE SAYING THAT WE ARE BEING VERY DELICATE IN OURPOLITICAL COMMENTS ABOUT IRAN AT THIS POINT EVENTHOUGH IN THE LONG HISTORY GOING BACK INTO THE 1970STHE FIRST PERSON TO REALLY CALL THE UNITED STATES ASATAN WHO NEEDED TO BE DESTROYED AND ATTACKED WASAYATOLLAH RUHOLLAH KHOMEINI IN IRAN.Sure.TODAY IN OCTOBER AS WE ARE NOW IN THIS NEW WAR, WHATDO YOU THINK IT WOULD TAKE TO NEUTRALIZE THEHEZBOLLAH IN IRAN?Well, ultimately it's going to take going after the money the same way we aretalking about going after the financial resources of bin Laden and his network.And ultimately that's going to require the collaboration and support of othercountries.WHO WOULD BE PROTECTING MUGHNIYAH IN IRAN?The Revolutionary Guard. And within Iran, it's a bit of a troublesome situationbecause the President there had key members of his government were murderedlast year by members of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. So, it's not like he's infull control of that country.THE HEZBOLLAH IS MUCH STRONGER THAN AMERICANS HAVETHOUGHT?I wouldn't say much stronger than we thought. They are strong because they areallowed to operate virtually unchecked in Lebanon. Their major focus apartfrom Mughniyah's sort of Jihad against the United States Hezbollah per se hasgenerally shied away from targeting Americans, but has aggressively gone afterIsrael.IS IT STRETCHING TOO FAR TO SAY THAT THE OSAMA BINLADEN TERRORIST ATTACK ON NEW YORK AND WASHINGTONCOULD BE LINKED TO THE LONG ARM OF KHOMENI FROM THE1970S?What do you mean linked?MEANING KHOMENI WANTED TO DESTROY THE UNITED STATESAND THE WEST. HE DIED, BUT THE HEZBOLLAH HAS CARRIEDON HIS MISSION. AND IF THE MUGHNIYAH AND THE HEZBOLLAHHAVE BEEN A MENTOR TO OSAMA BIN LADEN, IS OSAMA AND ALQAEDA SORT OF AN EXTENSION OF EVERYTHING THATKHOMEINI WAS IN THE 1970S?I think bin Laden has more in common with the Ayatollah Khomeini thanHezbollah. Hezbollah their focus has been much narrower and it's concentratedon expelling Jews from Israel and capturing and retaking Israel. Mughniyah Iwouldn't even argue as mainstream Hezbollah. I know that sounds crazy and Idon't want to portray Hezbollah as some sort of social organization, but over thepast several years we have seen a tendency of Hezbollah to try to concentrate ontraditional military targets as opposed to going after civilians. The suicidebombers have tended to come out of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad factions asopposed to the Hezbollah. However, there are elements within Hezbollah andthey have ties to people in Iran who are extremely radical and who do not drawthose distinctions.So, ultimately the fact that they operate and are allowed to operate in Lebanon"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"means that they are going to continue to be a threat to Israel and it's going tomake peace very difficult until they are rooted out. And how do you root themout? Iran and Syria have got to stop supporting them.THE MONEY THAT THE HEZBOLLAH WOULD HAVE, WOULD ITBE SUFFICIENT TO BACK OSAMA BIN LADEN INDEPENDENTLYFROM ANY FORTUNE THAT BIN LADEN MIGHT HAVE?Possibly, but I think bin Laden not only apart from his own personal wealth,there are indications that he has been involved with getting payments frompeople linked to the Russian mob for protecting shipments of opium fromAfghanistan up into the illegal drug pipeline that threads through Russia andinto Europe and from Europe into the United States.IT'S LIKE A HALL OF MIRRORS AND I READ THAT UP UNTIL NOW73% OF THE HEROIN DRUG TRADE IN THE WORLD CAME OUTOF AFGHANISTAN.Yes. Supposedly they were scaling back earlier this year or late last year. Butsome of the folks I talk with are not convinced of their adherence to that.IF WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE IMPLICATION FROM WHAT YOUJUST SAID: IF OSAMA BIN LADEN IS COLLECTING MONIES FROMTHAT HEROIN TRADE AND APPLYING IT TO HIS AL QAEDATERRORIST NETWORK, IT IS A HEROIN-BASED MONEY.There is great irony to be found here that a religious zealot who opposes the useof drugs is one of those helping to ship the very thing he claims to oppose.IS MUGHNIYAH LIVING IN IRAN?I understand he splits his time between Iran and Lebanon.THAT IT WOULD BE JUST AS POSSIBLE FOR OSAMA BIN LADENTO BE HIDING IN IRAN REALLY THAN AFGHANISTAN?No, I doubt that bin Laden is going to go to Iran. He does not have the kinds ofties or relationships with the Revolutionary Guard that we saw, but withMughniyah and the Revolutionary Guard.EVEN THOUGH THEY MIGHT BE JOINED IN A COMMON GOAL TODESTROY THE UNITED STATES, IRAN WOULD STILL NOT BECOMFORTABLE FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN?I think that is correct. Bin Laden does not have a lot of good options right now.Let's face it. Nobody is going to mistake Afghanistan for Club Med!DO YOU THINK ON THE BASIS OF YOUR EXPERIENCE WITHCOUNTER-TERRORISM, DO YOU THINK THAT HE HAS ONLYAFGHANISTAN AND THE CAVES AND WILDERNESS LAND ASDEFENSE AND PROTECTION THAT THAT IS HIS BEST PLACE TOSTAY?Yeah, I do. I don't think he has a lot of other good options with the price tag onhis head. Some have talked about his going to Somalia, but if he's in Somalia, it'sa far easier place for the United States to conduct operations. We can parkaircraft carriers easily off the coast of Somalia and stage bases from Kenya. Andif he's there, we won't repeat the mistakes that we made when we sent the Armyrangers into Somalia several years ago to conduct snatch and grab in broaddaylight.Plus, someone of bin Laden's height he's fairly tall, about 6 feet 4 or 5 inches.So, he's going to stand out in Somalia.THERE SEEMS TO BE A CONTRADICTION IN THE BACKGROUNDOF HIS SAUDI WORLD VERSUS WHAT HE HAS BECOME.Not really. The Saudis unfortunately have been, I'll say, duplicitous in all this.They themselves continue many members of the Saudi government to this day continue to provide economic support to terrorist groups thruout the MiddleEast ranging from Islamic groups, Hezbollah, Egyptian Islamic Jihad. I mean,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"they are always hedging their bets.WHAT IS IN THEIR INTEREST TO BACK TERRORISTS?Because they don't want to be put in a position where they think the UnitedStates is going to pull out or lose that they are going to be left fronting the wrathof these people and they want to be able to say that they actually helped sustainthem.THE UNITED STATES AND GEORGE BUSH ARE ON A RAZOR'SEDGE IN TERMS OF SAYING THAT WE ARE GOING TOERADICATE TERRORISM WHEN AT THE SAME TIME WE NEEDTHE OIL FROM SAUDI ARABIA AND THE IRANIAN MIDDLE EASTAREA AND THESE ARE THE VERY NATIONS THAT AREHARBORING MOST OF THE TERRORISTS?Yeah. Look at most of the people involved in the September 11th attack wereSaudis.WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO PLAY OUT IN THE NEXT FEWWEEKS IN FINDING OSAMA BIN LADEN?I think the diplomatic efforts are going to continue and the U. S. has got to getforward-basing rights in some of the neighboring countries. Without that, it willbe very difficult for the United States to do anything of any significance in thecountry. I do anticipate at some point that there will be air strikes against someof the key, or what is left of Taliban military infrastructure and at the same timeprovide clandestine support to the Northern Alliance so they can go in and oustthe Taliban. And coupled with that and if they succeed in ousting the Taliban,then putting in substantial amounts of international aid to start rebuildingAfghanistan.WHICH WOULD BE A WONDERFUL PUBLIC RELATIONS STEPFOR THE UNITED STATES WHICH MIGHT HELP DEFEAT THETALIBAN EVEN FURTHER.Yeah. I think that's an important element.WHETHER OR NOT OSAMA BIN LADEN IS CAUGHT OR NOT?Well, he is openly going to have to be caught and destroyed.WE ARE UP AGAINST SUCH A SHELL GAME BECAUSE OSAMA BINLADEN CAN MOVE BETWEEN AFGHANISTAN AND WHOEVERARE HIS HELPERS SUCH AS THE HEZBOLLAH. HOW WOULD WEEVER BE ABLE TO NAIL HIM DOWN?Because he is a man. He's not a ghost. He's not a superman. And he does nothave unfettered access back and forth into Iran. He has limited areas in which hecan go. I think he will ultimately be caught. Part of the problem in the past isthat he was just not elevated to a high enough priority. I think that has clearlychanged now and his ability to use his economic largesse as a way of buyingadditional support is severely constrained as well. There is a coordinated effortright now to go after his money.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
