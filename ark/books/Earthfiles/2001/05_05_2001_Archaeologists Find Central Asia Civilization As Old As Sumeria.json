C.in the Kara Kum desert of Central Asia at Margiana, Turkmenistan (Russia) nearAfghanistan border.Photograph courtesy Prof. Fredrik T. Hiebert, University of Pennsylvania.May 5, 2001 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - A large, sophisticated civilizationequal to Sumeria and Mesopotamia and thriving at the same time at least 5,000years ago was lost in the harsh desert sands of the Soviet Union near the Iranand Afghanistan borders. But now details are beginning to emerge. This week Ivisited archaeologist Fredrik Hiebert at the University of Pennsylvania Museumof Anthropology and Archaeology. There he has some exquisite pottery shardsthe Russian government gave him permission to bring back to the United Statesfrom his recent excavations in the Kara Kum desert of Turkmenistan andUzbekistan on the Iran and Afghanistan borders.Map drawn by Ardeth Abrams.No American archaeologist had been there since 1904 when New Hampshirearchaeologist and geologist, Raphael Pumpelly, discovered ancient ruins atAnau in southern Turkmenistan near Iran. But the Soviets did not develop theAnau site. In the 1970s, Soviet archaeologists working west of Afghanistanreported vast ruins, all built with the same distinct pattern of a central buildingsurrounded by a series of walls. Several hundred were found in Bactria andMargiana on the border that separates Afghanistan from Russia's Turkmenistan"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"and Uzbekistan. But nothing was reported beyond a few Soviet journals thatwere never translated.Then in 1988 after the collapse of the Soviet Union, Dr. Hiebert first receivedpermission to travel to Anau. He has discovered it is about 2,000 years olderthan the Bactria and Margiana sites further to the east, going back nearly seventhousand years to at least 4,500 B. C., or the Bronze Age. Not only are theoldest shards from there of high craftsmanship, this past summer Dr. Hiebert alsofound a black rock carved with red-colored symbols that, to date, areunidentified but considered to be evidence of a literacy independent ofMesopotamia. The discovery is revolutionary to earlier academic thought thatSumeria was the first civilization with language. Dr. Hiebert will present hisfindings at an international meeting on language and archaeology at Harvard onMay 12.Interview:Fredrik Talmage Hiebert, Ph.D., Prof. of Anthropology, Univ. ofPennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology and AssistantCurator of Near Eastern Archaeology, Philadelphpia, Pennsylvania: \"Ourwork joins Mesopotamia and Sumeria in being one of the world's civilizations inan area we hadn't previously expected to find civilization. This is far to the northof the cities of ancient Mesopotamia, Iran and even north of the ancient cities ofthe Indus civilization. This is in an area that was formerly part of the SovietUnion, so most western scholars did not have access to this area.Then this last year during my excavations of June and July 2000, we cameacross a wonderful discovery: an inscribed stamp seal dated to about 2,300 B. C.that clearly had symbols on it. These symbols looked to us like writing. Welooked around at all the different systems in the area. Was it ancientMesopotamian? Was it ancient Iranian or ancient Indus? We even asked ourChinese scholars if it were ancient Chinese? And it was none of these.This small 1.3 by 1.4 centimeters shiny black jet stone carved with an inscriptionemphasized with a reddish pigment was found at the Anau site in June 2000 by Dr. FredrikHiebert.Carved stone was found in a layer of charcoal which radiocarbon dated at 2,300 B.C.Photograph courtesy Prof. Fredrik T. Hiebert, University of Pennsylvania.So, we are proposing that this one single stamp seal is the first ever evidence wehave of writing among the cities of central Asia that were found by our Soviet,now Russian, colleagues, and now where we are working as well. In otherwords, it's not just a linking area of the centers of civilization. But it now"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"contains characteristics of ancient civilizations itself - cities, monumentalarchitecture, a very elite society such as kings and courts, and now some form ofliteracy or writing system. This is very important because what it means is thatwe can re-write the history books about the ancient world. We are not reallylooking at separate, individually developing civilizations that weren't in contactwith each other or didn't know about each other. It seems quite clear that thisnew piece of the puzzle suggests there was a broad mosaic of cultures that knewabout each other and seemed to be growing in relationship with each other. Thisis the importance of our work.HOW DID YOU SPECIFICALLY DATE THAT SEAL THAT HAS THESYMBOLS?The way archaeologists would date such a single find like that would be toidentify what level exactly it came from in the excavation. And in this case, wewere very lucky. It was lying on the floor of a building and it was actuallystratified between different floors. And on the floor of that particular building,we found some charcoal. And charcoal allows us to radiocarbon date that level.We had four radiocarbon dates that allowed us to clearly say it was 2,300 B. C.(4300 years ago) that the charcoal was deposited (where rock seal found).ALL OF THIS SEEMS TO BE PUSHING BACK OUR BENCH MARKFOR THE BEGINNING OF CIVILIZATION BECAUSE YOU HAVE TOHAVE AN EVOLUTIONARY ARC TO GET UP TO 5,000 TO 7,000YEARS AGO OF A FULL BLOWN CIVILIZATION.Yes, and one of the methods we use in excavating is what we call stratigraphicexcavations where we do very small sized excavations which are very deep. Andthese small sized excavations allow us to compare the development in an opensite through time. And at our site in Central Asia called Anau - just across theIranian border in the modern state of Turkmenistan - we've documented almostcontinuous growth of the culture in this area for at least 6,500 years. And thatgoes all the way back to the earliest farmers we have in the area. And what'sunique and special is it's clear to see that they used the same forms of farmingand herding in central Asia as did the ancient Mesopotamian people. So, we'vegot clear evidence for the interaction and the co-development of farming levelsin central Asia, just as in Mesopotamia.So, we are looking at a part of the world, even though it had been forgotten bywestern scholars, which really takes its place as a partner in the developmentfrom the first farmers about 10,000 years ago up to early villagers when we seethe beginning of our settlement in Anau at Turkmenistan 4,500 B. C., all theway through the development of these large cities that we are finding out in thedeserts. And I am quite convinced that 5,000 years ago an ancient Sumerianwould have some understanding of what a central Asian was, or what centralAsian artifacts were and vice versa.HOW BIG IS THE SITE NOW SO FAR THAT YOU HAVEEXCAVATED?We've been looking at some of these large desert oasis sites in part of the KaraKum Desert of Turkmenistan which cover an area of 100 miles long by some 50miles wide. This is an area that is simply dotted with archaeological sites. Wecall this an 'ancient oasis.' It would have been an area watered in the past withirrigation canals and would have been a lush agricultural oasis where farmingwould have produced an abundance of wheat and barley.Today it's sandy. The sites are almost gone. It takes excavation to reveal theplans of these buildings. Once the buildings are excavated, we see they areunlike any other area that we have previously worked in Mesopotamia or Iran.These buildings tend to be in the 300 to 500 foot length on each side, oftenhaving many series of walls that enclose them surrounded by the fields, theagricultural fields. It's almost like a building complex with dozens and dozens ofrooms inside them. Quite unusual and apparently quite an organized society."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THAT SOUNDS LIKE IT WOULD SUPPORT A LARGE POPULATION.DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ANDWHAT WAS THE WATER SOURCE? WERE THERE ANY WELLSUNDERGROUND OR ANY KIND OF NEARBY RIVER SOURCE?It's really hard to predict how many people would live in a particular building orhow long a building was occupied, whether people living in one part and thenanother part. It seems that these large building complexes would supporthundreds of people. Probably not thousands. They are not as big as a traditionalancient city, but their organization and density of rooms in them suggest itwould be a fairly large population for that area.About the water source. Clearly, water was the key to life out in the middle ofthe desert. And the only way that people could have lived out there is if theytook a local river - and there were rivers that ran out into the desert - and modifythe delta of the river. In other words, where the river snakes out into the desert,rather than letting it form a giant jungle morass of thickets, the people must havecut down the thicket and cleared irrigation canals. Once they did that, they tookthat desert oasis and made it bloom. Can you imagine that, 4,000 years ago,making a desert bloom?IT HAPPENED IN EGYPT ALONG THE NILE?It certainly did. And in many ways, these central Asian desert oases are like theNile in which you could have one foot in a lush oasis and one foot in the sandright at the edge.AS IF THIS WERE HAPPENING IN MESOPOTAMIA, EGYPT,CENTRAL ASIA, ALL AT THE SAME TIME, ALL BACK MUCHFURTHER THAN ANYONE EVER REALIZED.Yes, this is one of the things that intrigues us all is to imagine a system that wehad previously thought may have existed only 2000 years ago when the Romanswere in power in the Mediterranean and the Han Dynasty was the great Imperialpower in China. Now we are pushing that thousands of years back earlier thanthat into the Bronze Age. One of our questions is about how much trade wasgoing on among them? Was there actually a Bronze Age Silk Road, a 4000 yearold Silk Road? I don't think we're yet able to answer that, but we can talk aboutthe importance of these desert oases as a pre-Silk Road civilization.Prof. Fredrik Hiebert holding oldest ceramic pottery chard dated around 3,500 B.C.from the Anau, Turkmenistan (Russia) archaeological site.

HOW DID THIS BLUE AND WHITE, DELICATEPATTERN COME TO BE IN CENTRAL ASIA ALONG WITH THESEOTHER PIECES? WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT? HOW OLD IS ITAND WHERE DID YOU FIND IT?On the table in front of us are a series of pottery shards. A pottery shard is a partof a pot that was broken. These pottery shards are the best thing we have inarchaeology because when they are broken, people throw them away. These are"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the remains we find most commonly on the dig. So, I have a selection of ceramicshards which represent the time scale we have from Central Asia.The first piece we have is the blue and white ceramic that has a bird or dragonon it and these curly designs that do remind us of Delft ceramics. This is a 15thCentury A. D. Silk Road pot. It would have been locally made, but it wouldhave been made in imitation of Chinese blue and white. And what's interestingabout this is that in central Asia, they are making imitations of Chinese blue andwhite. And in Europe they were also making imitations of Chinese blue andwhite. It was sort of the Coca-Cola signature of the past.Moving on chronilogically, we turn to another well-made pot. It's so thin(knocks on it), you can hear how finely made it is.One-eighth inch thin walls of finely made vase from Turkmenistan,circa 2,500 B. C. Photograph by Linda Moulton Howe.ONLY 1/8TH INCH THICK.Yes, this is a piece that is about 4,500 years old (2,500 B. C.), about 2,000 yearsearlier than the blue and white ceramic. Incredibly well made. It was obviouslydone by a master craftsman potter. this was made up in the desert oasis ofTurkmenistan and it reflects a certain style that the people had. They didn't painttheir pottery. You might think that had to do with the technology of the time,but in fact, it was their style not to paint their pottery. It's quite nice made. It'ssort of buff on top and on the bottom it's red. They distinctly and purposefullydid that. All of their ceramics from Central Asia is fine from this time period andit reflects the high level of crafts they had in the area.Then we move on to three artifacts, not pottery, but metal and bone artifactsdated to about 2000 B. C., so these are about 4100 years old. We are movingback in large jumps of time. And here we see a bronze ax in the form of a bird'shead with a feather going back and very clear eye.Bronze ax in form of bird's head with eye and feather,circa 2,000 B. C. Photograph by Linda Moulton Howe.And what we call a 'bone tube.' I wish we had a better name for it. They arealways polished very finely with eyes, headdress or hair and some form ofnecklace or some perhaps a beard. And these ancient tubes we think were part"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"of the ancient rituals of 2000 B. C. And the ritual life is another area we asarchaeologists can look at. So we can look at the nature of their houses, thenature of their trade with these stamp seals we find, the nature of theirproduction such as the pottery and even the types of religious objects they hadsuch as the bone tube.\"Bone tube\" carved with stylized head, circa 2,000 B. C.Photograph by Linda Moulton Howe.WHAT DO YOU THINK THE BONE TUBE WAS USED FOR?We're not exactly sure, but it was found in piles of dirt we have analyzed thathad a tremendous amount of ephedra. Ephedra is a type of plant that ancientZoroastrians used to create a ritual drink that allowed them to hallucinate andget closer to God. It may well be that the tube was used in some pre-Zoroastrianritual involving ephedra. Ephedra has medicinal factors. The decongestantSudafed is made from the same ephedra chemical. But if you take it in somequantity and mix it with a poppy or opium, it would have the effect of givingyou visions or hallucinations.WHAT ABOUT THE BEIGE POT?Thin ceramic vase on left about 2,500 B. C. On right is oldest pottery shard yet foundin central Asian dig, circa 3,500 B.C. Photograph by Linda Moulton Howe.We have two pots, each a thousand years earlier than each other. This one a verybeatuiful vase made out of buff ceramics only about 1/8th of an inch thick from2,500 B. C. This is, would have been made at the same time that thee greatCity/States of Sumer were in existence. This would pre-date some of the fineceramics that were in China. So it is very significant that we had a civilization inCentral Asia at the time. So we can date from the excavations to 2,500 B. C.This is at the time period of some of the earliest cities in central Asia.The last pot here is perhaps the most ornate. it's painted with absolutelygorgeous tree designs surrounded by squares have a step motif. it's very finelymade, only about 1/8th inch thick - a very fine ceramic - and it has this beautifulpaint. this is the oldest pottery we have from about 3,500. B.C. and representsthe type of ceramics just before people in central Asia began to build big cities.IN THE AREA YOU ARE WORKING, IF YOU WERE GOING TO TIETHEM INTO BLOODLINES OF PEOPLE ALIVE TODAY, WHICH"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"COUNTRY WOULD BE CLOSEST TO THIS GROUP?That of course is one of the questions we would like to know, but don't have themeans to answer right now. I think that if we used the old perspective insuggesting there were individual civilizations that developed by themselveswithout much interaction, we might say Turkish people in the area are thedescendants.DID YOU EVER FIND ANY SKELETONS DURING THIS WORK?Burials were very formally made. They would build a mud brick structure,construct a little house and put ceramics such as some of these pots here.Sometimes they would leave a ritual last dinner in with the burials. These havetaught us a great deal about the people. We haven't found as many burials as wehave found along the Indus River or in Mesopotamia, but we've found enough togive us an interesting idea about the funereal rituals and the afterlife that thecentral Asians thought (exists).IS IT POSSIBLE THERE ARE FEWER SKELETONS BECAUSE THEYMIGHT HAVE USED A FORM OF CREMATION AND BURNEDTHEM?That certainly is possible. There is a ritual in ancient Persian Zoroastrianism thatwe think would have an early form in the desert oases that would involveleaving the bodies out to return to nature.IN A DESERT CLIMATE, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN WINDBLASTED AND DISINTEGRATED?Yes, so the burial record might not reflect the size of the population, exactly.IT WOULD BE HARD THEN FOR ARCHAEOLOGISTS TODAY TOKNOW FOR CERTAIN WHAT THAT POPULATION SIZE WAS INCENTRAL ASIA?Yes, there are some things we can guess at, but we are never going to be able todetermine such as the exact size of the population.WHAT HAS SURPRISED YOU THE MOST FROM THE EARLY 1980STO NOW?Well, I think the thing that surprised me most was actually not thearchaeological remains themselves, but the reactions of our colleagues. As webegan to peel back the lawyers and reveal civilization in the desert oases, somepeople wouldn't believe us. Some people did believe us. Some people havechallenged the origins of this. Some people have simply ignored this. What weare really seeing is that now from the 1980s to the beginning of the 21st Centuryis finally an understanding that this area really takes its place in among the greatcivilizations of the old world.YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOUR OWN COLLEAGUE SCIENTISTSWERE NOT OPEN MINDED TO THIS DISCOVERY?I don't know if they weren't open minded. They hadn't taken into considerationthis new area of the world. And the more we work on it, the more we realizethat this is an important part of the world. It was an important part of the worldin the past and it was directly connected with the other areas. As we work moreon this and create a better understanding of it in English and western languages,the more we are getting the idea out that we have a large Bronze Age civilizationin central Asia.COULD THERE HAVE BEEN IN THE CELTIC WORLD UP IN THEBRITISH ISLES BUILDING THE MEGALITHIC STONE CIRCLESTHAT PRE-DATED ALL OF THIS?This question of the connection between the Celtic world and the ancient NearEast is one that's been suggested as much as 100 years ago. The erection of theselarge stone megalithic monuments has parallels in the Black Sea world wheremegalithic tombs are there and further west in the Mediterranean, and perhapseven on the Eurasian steppes.Nevertheless, to consider those monumental works part of a civilizationwouldn't fall into the same category as the types of societies we're talking about"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"in central Asia or Mesopotamia because the builders of the monoliths reallydidn't have - we don't have evidence of settled farming or urban life. No cities.None of the domestic animals and plants. It's a type of complexity that is verydifferent from central Asia, the Indus Valley and central Asia or China.So, I think to be open minded, we have to allow us to understand the deepcomplexity of building monolithic monuments, but realizing diversity is alsosomething very important. In central Asia, people built cities as they did inMesopotamia and the Indus Valley. But in the areas of Europe, farming tookmuch longer to get there. The farming that finally entered into Europe aftercentral Asia, thousands of years, and after the Indus Valley, represent a differenttype of culture.WHERE DOES YOUR WORK GO FROM HERE? WHAT'S NEXT?We're very excited about discovering the stamp seal at our site dated to 2,300 B.C. We're certainly going to go back and look for more evidence of literacy andadministration of trade from this time period. We hope to dig deeper to find outhow (far down) this particular civilization and site goes in this area. We haven'treached the bottom yet. We're still digging down. We really look forward togoing back for a couple more seasons at this particular site. Then we hope toexpand our research into looking at the ancient trade routes in the area.HOW DEEP ARE YOU DOWN?We have a site that is about 35 feet above the present surface and we've dugdown about 15 feet below the present surface. And we're still going down! Whatthat means is that the ancient surface has risen through time. There's beendeposits that have come from the mountains - silt, dirt, have been depositedaround this archaeological site raising the surface through time. So we don'tknow how much further we have to go down. And it's very exciting that it'scontinuing to reveal older and older strata to investigate. That's one of the joysof archaeology. You can never predict what you are going to find. Every seasonthere are new surprises.\"More Information:June 2001 - Dr. Hiebert and geological team return to Anau site to core downthrough archaeological dig to see how much further it is to natural geologicalstrata.
