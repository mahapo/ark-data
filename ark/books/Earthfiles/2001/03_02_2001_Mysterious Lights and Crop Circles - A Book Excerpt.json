According to oneeyewitness, it was not there on the morning of May 2. HelenRobinson, a member of the Wiltshire Crop Circle Research Group,had visited the beautiful, yellow field that morning. Helen left forlunch and returned in the afternoon. She climbed to the White Horseoverlooking the field. To her \"utter amazement\" there was the brandnew formation next to older circles from April 4th.Charles Mallett, a crop formation researcher from Horton, said, \"Iplanned to sleep in the end ring which had a large standing tuft in thecenter. Nothing in particular happened. It gets dark around half pastten. It's clear, nice night, dark. And then suddenly, it felt quitesurreal. I don't know why.\"\"What do you mean, 'surreal?'\"\"It's kind of like being detached. It's hard to explain. It's so internal.Just slightly out of sync. I could hear the roads about a quarter of amile out in front of me. I can hear the cars and animals all around,but it all feels slightly away, slightly detached in some way.\"I sit there for a couple of hours, up until around midnight or 12:30AM. I take a look up to Sirius, the brightest star in the sky. I lookdown and all of a sudden there's a bright, diffused luminosity. It's asphere about ten to fifteen meters in front of me. It's just aboveground level behind the standing center which is about two feetacross with thick stalks and I can see between them. The stalks are in"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"silhouette. This light is behind them and next to the back wall of thecircle. I sat and watched this fully up to a minute and a half. I had mycamera next to me and it didn't even occur to me to pick it up. Ishould have.\"Yellowish-white glowing sphere Charles Mallett saw suddenly appear behindoilseed rapein Milk Hill formation, May 1999. The light stayed for more than a minute.Drawing © 1999 by Charles Mallett.\"Did the light move at all?\"\"There was hardly any motion. Very, very slight, but really nomotion. And it was yellowish-white, diffused with a hint of orangeand appeared to be self-luminous. But it wasn't casting a bright lightat all. It was glowing, but very localized. I had enough time to shiftmy position, move away from the standing center so I could lookaround and it was definitely there. I'm actually sleeping in these cropcircles, hoping for some kind of direct interaction with whatever isdoing this stuff and my mind goes blank. All I seemed able to do waswatch and observe what was going on right in front of me. After aminute and half or whatever - long enough to be absolutely sure thatthis object is there - it just faded out over about two seconds tonothing.\"\"Did you ever feel like the light tried to communicate to your mind?\"\"No, no, I'm pretty sure I was in control of my mind. But I had ratherstrange, almost spooky sensations for about fifteen or twenty minutesbefore I saw anything. That was quite weird, a heady, slightly phasedout of reality feeling even before I saw the light. I considered leavingthe crop circle because it was so strange. Yet, I'm used to sleeping incrop circles and on the hills in this area. Even though sometimes itgets a little strange, I have never had any feelings of negativity fromwhatever is responsible for the formations. Quite the opposite, in fact.The crop circles seem to have a hugely positive affect on most peoplethat come in contact with them.\"I didn't feel I was threatened when this light was there. As soon asthe light showed up, I was transfixed and quite excited. It's right infront of me, what I've been looking for. I think it was like if you werein an enclosed space and you can hear things going on around yououtside, it's slightly worrying. But, it's not nearly as worrying whenyou can actually see what's going on. The feeling of a presence isquite strange. But if you can see, it's not nearly as strange.\"Frances added, \"The same night in May (1999) that Charlie saw hissphere, I was at the belly of the White Horse at Alton Barnes with afriend of mine and we were staying the night overlooking the fieldthat Charlie was in. About 10:30 PM or maybe a bit later, two lightsappear very bright in the field where Charlie was in the rape seedformation. And if you've ever been into rape, it is so difficult. Youmake so much noise. You can crunch the stems so easily. But that"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"night right above the rape, these two or three lights flashed on, wentoff, flashed on, went off. And that was it. Until about a half hourlater, I saw these streaks of light - a bit like smoke. They didn't have asource. They were just streaking down about the same place as theformation. The streaks were almost working their way down from thetop of the formation to the bottom.Three mysterious lights Frances Mallett and her friend saw to the left of theMilk Hill, Wiltshire,oilseed rape formation the same night in May 1999 that Charles Mallettencountered asphere of light inside this formation.

He said, 'You will not believewhat I saw in here last night!' We said, 'We saw some lights in thisfield, too!'\"More Information:Charles and Frances Mallett in the garden at the Barge Inn, Alton Barnes,Wiltshire, England, August 1, 1999.
