The mutilations had first made nationalnews in the fall of 1974 and continued without letup in many parts of NorthAmerica and other countries such as Australia, South America, Central America,Mexico, the Canary Islands off the coast of Africa and parts of Europe.Colorado Grazing Association cow discovered with strange, bloodless excisions on July 26,1977.This scene of a deputy sheriff examining the odd mutilation cuts has repeatedover the past decades in Montana and many other states, provinces and countries.Photograph by the Logan County, Colorado Sheriff's Office, Sterling, Colorado."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Close-up of the Colorado Grazing Association's mutilated cow found on July 26, 1977with jaw stripped in a fashion similar to the new round of mutilations occurring in Montanain the summer of 2001. Photograph by the Logan County, Colorado Sheriff's Office,Sterling, Colorado. In Montana, one county seemed besieged by the phenomenon in 1975-1976 andthat was Cascade County around Great Falls. My brother, Jim Moulton, wasthere at the time after his tour of duty in the Vietnam war working as ahelicopter pilot at Malmstrom AFB, an American military installationsurrounded by Minuteman nuclear missiles. He and some of his other militarycolleagues were also assigned to help the Cascade County Sheriff's Officeinvestigate many unusual deaths and mutilations of cattle, often associated withunusual aerial craft or lights in the sky. There were several incidents in whichlarge, glowing, red-orange discs hovered right over Minuteman nuclear missilesilos and caused great alarm.One day a rancher brought a mutilated cow to the base. A flight surgeonexamined it and told my brother that the excisions of hide were precise andsurgical. He also said that the cow had been so thoroughly drained of blood thatthe muscle tissue was a pale pink-white.\"It's happened all over again,\" Jan Elings of Browning, Montana told me thisweek. On Wednesday morning, August 15th at 7:30 a.m., Jan found one of theiryearling heifers dead and mutilated, similar to another young cow she and herhusband, Larry, found on their first ranch in Fort Shaw near Great Falls back inthe late 1970s. Jan and Larry knew for certain that this August 2001 yearlingwas alive and well on Monday evening with the rest of the 400 cows, yearlingsand one bull in the pasture.Jan and Larry Elings ranch northwest of Browning nearDuck Lake and Babb, Montana. Great Falls is southeast."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Interview:Jan Elings, Rancher and Wife of Larry Elings, Browning, Montana: \"Idrove up and seen the yearling and I got out and looked around and I realizedshe had been cut on.WHAT EXACTLY HAD BEEN REMOVED?The tongue and then it went up the right side of the jaw bone. The jaw bone wascompletely I mean, there isn't any meat left on it whatsoever. And then uptowards the back of the ears and the neck and the nose. It looked like it made aperfect triangle. And it's like they opened up the mouth and cut the tongue off.DID THEY CUT THE TONGUE DOWN INTO THE THROAT ?No, about 10 inches, I would say. Some would still be there.BUT MOST OF THE TONGUE HAD BEEN REMOVED?Ye s .A VERTICAL CUT, FROM THE TOP OF THE ROOF OF THE MOUTHDOWN TO THE BOTTOM?Yeah. As fresh as I found her, the flies were just setting in. There wasn't any birdcrap on her at all. Nothing.WHAT ABOUT THE GENITALS AND RECTUM?One teat was removed. And part of the rectum was cut out also.WAS THE TEAT CUT OFF FLAT FLUSH WITH THE SURFACE OF THEUDDER?Ye a h .IT DIDN'T BURROW INTO THE UDDER?No.WHERE THE TEAT WAS CUT OFF, WAS THERE ANY BLOOD OR FLUID?No, and that was another thing the cutting on the face. There was no bloodwhatsoever.NOT ON ANY OF THESE EXCISIONS?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"No.WERE THE EARS INTACT?Ye s .THE EYES WERE BOTH THERE?Ye s .WAS THE YEARLING LYING ON GRASS OR WAS IT POWDERY DIRT?Well, it's supposed to be grass, but with the drought here, it's getting powdery.We can see tracks very easily.COULD YOU SEE ANYTHING UNUSUAL?Nothing. The first thing the area we live in, Linda, the first thing you look for arepredators. Because we have it all up here. And that's the first thing when I seenher dead was to look for signs of coyotes. You know how coyotes chew onthem. And I looked for tracks. And nothing.DID THE YEARLING LIE THERE WITHOUT ANY LARGE PREDATORSTOUCHING IT FOR A DAY OR TWO?Well, like I said, nothing was there on Monday, so she had to have been killedon Tuesday morning, maybe, judging by the flies and what not.YOU FOUND HER WEDNESDAY MORNING, EARLY?Right.NOTHING HAD TORN HER APART?No, there was no predators whatsoever. And even now, the coyotes still havenot touched her.THIS IS FRIDAY.And I still haven't seen birds on her, either. Larry and I had a calf mutilated inthe late 1970s when we lived in Fort Shaw. We found that while it was still veryfresh and rigor mortis had not set in yet. We found that calf in the morning.WAS IT WARM TO TOUCH?Yes, it was, which a lot of people don't believe it. Back then, you didn't dare saymuch.HOW DID THE EXCISIONS IN THE 1970S COMPARE TO THIS ONE INAUGUST OF 2001?On the calf (1970s), the only thing they took was an ear and down the neck andback up. That's the only thing they took on the calf.THE JAW FLESH THAT WAS REMOVED ON THE YOUNG COW IN THE1970S, WAS IT VERY SIMILAR TO THIS ONE NOW?No, they didn't cut the calf's jaw. They just cut the calf's ear and down the neckand the shoulder and back up. They didn't touch the jaw.THAT REMOVAL OF FLESH BACK IN THE 1970S, WAS IT HIDE-DEEPONLY?Yes, it was.EXPOSING ONLY THE MUSCLE?Yes, pretty much the hide."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CLEARLY CUT?Oh, yes. My dad did taxidermy work and he come up there and said, 'Somethinghad to have done this.' He skinned the calf out thinking there had to be apuncture hole or something on the calf and he couldn't find anything. Andagain, no blood whatsoever.THAT'S ALWAYS A PUZZLING PART BECAUSE IT ALMOST IMPLIESTHAT WHATEVER HAS HAPPENED HAS BEEN DONE SOMEPLACEELSE AND THEN THE ANIMAL IS RETURNED.Yes. I really believe in that theory. With facial cuts like that, there should be ahuge amount of bleeding.AND NOTHING.Nothing.NOT EVEN THE SIGNS THERE HAD BEEN FLUID ALONG THE CUTS?No.IT SUGGESTS SOME TYPE OF CAUTERY AND WE HAVE FOUND SOMEEVIDENCE OF THAT IN SOME OF THE CASES, BUT WE STILL DON'TKNOW WHO, WHAT OR WHY?It almost has to be laser as even as the hide looks.OR SOME PEOPLE HAVE SUGGESTED CUTTING WITH SOME KIND OFSOUND.That could be.BUT IT IS EVEN AND REGULAR.It is so clean that you know that knife didn't do it by looking.DID YOU HAVE A VETERINARIAN COME OUT ON THIS YEARLING?No, we didn't.WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ANIMAL?She is still laying there.STILL NO PREDATOR?No, and that's very rare for this area.BECAUSE YOU HAVE COYOTES AND BEAR AND WHAT ALL ELSE?Lions, wolves. And I've seen kills by all.THEY ARE VERY BLOODY USUALLY, TOO.Yes, very definitely. And with the coyotes, they always start at the entrails. Bearusually starts at the shoulder. And lion. I found a fresh deer kill by a lion, andyou can still see where the jugular was cut, that kind of thing.WITH NATURAL PREDATORS SUCH AS COYOTES AND COUGARS,THERE ARE CLAW OR TEETH PUNCTURE MARKS.Ye s .ON THIS YEARLING, DID YOU FIND ANYTHING THAT EVENRESEMBLED TEETH OR CLAW MARKS?No."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"HAVE YOU TALKED WITH ANYONE AROUND YOU ABOUT WHETHERTHEY HAVE SEEN ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THE SKY?No, I haven't talked with anyone yet.IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW.Especially where this yearling is, too. It's not that far off from the highway.That's why she was so noticeable.YET THERE REALLY WEREN'T ANY SIGNS OF STRUGGLE OR TRACKSWHERE SHE WAS FOUND?No, and totally dust where she was.WHICH EMPHASIZES THE FACT THAT THERE SHOULD HAVE BEENCLEAR PRINTS IF ANYTHING HAD BEEN AROUND THIS YEARLING?Yes, and that's the first thing you look for is tracks.IT'S ALMOST AS IF SHE WAS LAID DOWN THERE?Yes. There was no sign of struggle. Nothing! She was just laying there.NOT EVEN SIGNS OF HER OWN TRACKS LEADING UP TO WHERE SHEWAS LAYING?No. And even now, when you go out there, any time you take a vehicle, it reallyleaves a definite trail. Where I drove there yesterday, you can see it plain today.THAT'S WHAT OVER THE YEARS HAS LEAD LAW ENFORCEMENTTHAT I HAVE TALKED TO SAY, 'WHATEVER IS DOING THIS, THEY'VEGOT TO BE TAKING THE ANIMAL BY AIR AND RETURNING THEMFROM THE AIR.'And why do they take one out of 400. How do they pick?WHY THAT YEARLING?Yeah. Why not a cow? Or even a calf again? Why do, how do they choose whatthey want?\" Continued in Part 2.More Information:See the books:An Alien Harvest andGlimpses of Other Realities, Volumes I and IIin the Earthfiles.com ShopCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.ca"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"All rights reserved."}]
