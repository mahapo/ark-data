Thirty-one people at the Capitol complex in Washington, including aidesto Sen. Tom Daschle and to Sen. Russell Feingold, and two Capitol policeoffiers, tested positive for exposure to a deliberately manufactured anddangerous anthrax strain. To date, four people have contracted anthrax (RobertStevens a American Media died on October 5 after inhaling anthrax spores;another American Media employee is being treated for inhalation anthrax; TomBrokaw's assistant and ABC producer's 7-month-old baby contracted skinanthrax) and 40 others have been exposed to anthrax spores, including thethirty-one in the Capitol.Update October 16 -Seven-month-old son of ABC producer contracted cutaneous anthrax within 24hours of a September 28 visit to the ABC news room in New York City. Baby'sill health is improving with antibiotic treatment.October 15, 2001 - A letter opened today in the office of U. S. Senate MajorityLeader, Tom Daschle, contained powder that tested positive for anthrax. Thepostmark was Trenton, New Jersey. Another letter that tested positive foranthrax was also postmarked from Trenton, New Jersey on September 18 toNBC News Anchorman Tom Brokaw and opened by his assistant, ErinO'Connor, who contracted cutaneous anthrax.Saturday, October 13,the governor of Nevada confirmed that an envelope postmarked from Malaysiasent to the Microsoft company in Reno, Nevada did contain anthrax spores. TheCenter for Disease Control first contradicted those findings and then furthertesting confirmed presence of anthrax.And five more people have tested positive for anthrax exposure in Boca Raton,Florida at American Media which publishes the tabloid newspapers such as TheSun and National Enquirer where two others also tested positive for exposurelast week. Robert Stevens who died in Boca Raton, Florida on October 5worked for The Sun in the American Media building. He had the most deadly"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"form of anthrax known as \"inhalation anthrax\" caused by breathing in dry sporesfrom the bacteria. Prior to this, there had not been a case of confirmedinhalation anthrax in the United States since 1976. Anthrax spores were alsofound on the computer keyboard Mr. Stevens used and in the mail room wheretwo other employees tested positive for anthrax. This brings the total to eightAmerican Media employees who have been exposed to the dangerous bacteria.On Friday, October 12,the FBI announced that both The New York Times and NBC had received mailcontaining suspicious white powder. There were at least two threateningenvelopes addressed to Tom Brokaw containing powder, the one datedSeptember 18 postmarked from New Jersey. A second dated September 25thwas postmarked from St. Petersburg, Florida. The September 25th letter washandled by Mr. Brokaw's assistant, Erin O'Connor, and she turned that letterover to authorities. Subsequently, she developed a huge, softball-size black scabon her arm which puzzled experts in a series of medical tests. Finally, the Centerfor Disease Control confirmed the black scab is cutaneous anthrax in which thebacteria gets into the skin through a scratch or cut. Ms. O'Connor has been onantiobiotics and is progressing well, but strangely the powder in that September25th letter has not yet tested positive for anthrax, perhaps because too muchspilled out when it was first opened.However, the second September 18th letter tested positive and another NBCemployee who handled it is now under medical treatment. At least 500 NBCemployees lined up for testing, and the affected third floor \"Nightly News\"offices at Rockefeller Center were closed off.Another suspicious package with a threatening letter was sent to writer JudithMiller at The New York Times, also postmarked from St. Petersburg, Florida.And on Friday in Washington, D. C, employees in a State Department office thathandles congressional correspondence discovered a white powder. The officewas closed off, but no evacuations were considered necessary. The powder isbeing analyzed.Suspicious Powders Around The WorldArgentina - At least a dozen people were overcome with eye irritation andcoughing at polling stations in Buenos Aires after white powder was found.Canada - An envelope received at the Parliament Building contained powder.Thirty-five employees were sent to medical authorities for testing anddecontamination.France - Suspicious powder was found in mail received at the French SpaceAgency and the College de France, a research institute. Hundreds of peopleevacuated by police went to medical authorities to be tested for anthraxexposure.Germany - White powder was found in the mail room where ChancellorGerhard Schroeder has offices. Schroeder has supported the U. S. strikes againstAfghanistan, but many terrorists sympathetic to Osama bin Laden have beentraced to Germany. Tests are being done on the powder.Israel - Six suspicious letters have been tested, but found to be negative foranthrax.

The word anthraxis Greek for \"coal\" because of its blackness. With antibiotic treatment, cutaneousanthrax can be cured. Without treatment, the mortality rate can be 20%.2) Ingestion/gastrointestinal anthrax - bacteria form on spoiled, undercookedmeat which when eaten make people extremely ill and can cause death.Symptoms include nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, low energy and bloodydiarrhea. Antibiotics can help if treatment is early in the disease. But mortalityrates are high because early diagnosis is difficult. To date, no cases ofgastrointestinal anthrax have been reported in the U. S.3) Inhalation anthrax - dry anthrax spores can be breathed deep into the lungs.If enough - approximately 8,000 to 10,000 spores - are inhaled, the sporesgerminate into anthracis bacteria. First symptoms are like a flu with fever, drycough and chest pain anywhere from six to 45 days after exposure. The maturingbacteria produce lethal toxins that spread into the bloodstream and causesystemic shock and collapse of body systems resulting in death. Inhalationanthrax death rate exceeds 90%.Facts about Anthrax from the Center for Disease Control:\"Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the spore-formingbacterium Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax most commonly occurs inhoofed mammals and can also infect humans.Symptoms of disease vary depending on how the disease wascontracted, but usually occur within 7 days after exposure. The"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"serious forms of human anthrax are inhalation anthrax, cutaneousanthrax,and intestinal anthrax.Initial symptoms of inhalation anthrax infection may resemble acommon cold. After several days, the symptoms may progress tosevere breathing problems and shock. Inhalation anthrax is oftenfatal.The intestinal disease form of anthrax may follow the consumption ofcontaminated food and is characterized by an acute inflammation ofthe intestinal tract. Initial signs of nausea, loss of appetite,vomiting, and fever are followed by abdominal pain, vomiting ofblood, and severe diarrhea.Direct person-to-person spread of anthrax is extremely unlikely, if itoccurs at all. Therefore, there is no need to immunize or treatcontacts of persons ill with anthrax, such as household contacts,friends, orcoworkers, unless they also were also exposed to the same source ofinfection.In persons exposed to anthrax, infection can be prevented withantibiotic treatment.Early antibiotic treatment of anthrax is essential - delay lessenschances for survival. Anthrax usually is susceptible to penicillin,doxycycline, and fluoroquinolones.An anthrax vaccine also can prevent infection. Vaccination againstanthrax is not recommended for the general public to prevent diseaseand is not available.\" We b s it e s :http://www.nanobio.com/http://nano.med.umich.edu/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/Agent/Anthrax/Anthrax.aspCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
