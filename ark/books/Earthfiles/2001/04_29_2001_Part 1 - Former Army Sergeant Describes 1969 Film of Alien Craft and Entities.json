Roswell, New Mexico - In 1997, a book was published entitled U.F.O.s AreReal, Extraterrestrial Encounters Documented by the U. S. Governmentcontaining documents assembled by retired U. S. Army Sergeant Clifford E.Stone of Roswell, New Mexico. He served more than twenty years as a specialistassigned to investigations of unidentified aerial vehicle crash and retrievals.Sgt. Stone was born in Portsmouth, Ohio fifty-two years ago and enlisted in theU. S. Army on July 8, 1968 when he was nineteen. From there he went toAshland, Kentucky and then to Fort Lee, Virginia.In early 1969, he was assigned to drive an Officer-In-Charge to Ft. Belvoir, Va.for a briefing. No one told him where to wait and no one said the briefing wasclassified off limits. So, he waited for his superior along with an airman in theupper balcony of the auditorium in which the briefing was held. There was aclear Plexiglas wall separating their balcony seats from the main floor below sothey could not hear what was being discussed. They also could not hear thesound of the motion picture film, both color and B&W, that was projectedduring the briefing. The film contained images of strange aerial craft and unusualbodies, both dead and alive. At first, Sgt. Stone and the airman wondered whytheir superior officers were being shown clips from science fiction films. Thensuddenly men approached them and forced them out of the building to adebriefing room where Stone and the airman were held for several days untilthey learned to answer their interrogators' questions with \"I never saw anything\"or gave only their name, rank, birth date and serial number.From 1969 to this date, Sgt. Stone never spoke about the details he saw in thatfilm. But now he agreed to tell me what he remembers seeing at the Army's Fort"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Belvoir, Virginia in March or April 1969.February 18, 1970 Certificate of Achievement for exemplaryU. S. Army service during the period December 1968 to January 1970,signed by John D. McLaughlin, Brigadier General.Interview:Sergeant Clifford E. Stone, U. S. Army (Retired), Roswell, New Mexico:\"Being there at Fort Belvoir, Virginia in early 1969 where we saw the filmfootage is the first thing in the Army that got my real attention.UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES DID YOU SEE THE FILM?I drove my Officer-In-Charge (OIC) to Fort Belvoir because he was going to getsome more on-going training that the officers needed to know for the quickresponse team. And I'm there as his driver. It was like a theater complex. It hadseats and a stage. They were using a projector and a screen. There was an AirForce person and myself who went up into the balcony.WHY WOULD YOU AS A DRIVER BE ALLOWED TO SEE HIGHLYCLASSIFIED FILM?There was nothing indicating that this was classified. No one told us to. We justwanted to save money, had sack lunches and the balcony had seats. We didn't goup there to be nosy or anything like that. But you can't help when they turn on aprojector, you start looking and seeing things that don't make any sense. Ithought I had seen a lot of science fiction movies, but these were nothing like Ihad seen in science fiction. But we were trying to figure out what scenes thesemovies were from. We couldn't hear what was going on because they had aPlexiglas (wall in front of us) where we could look down and see what theywere doing.DO YOU KNOW WHO WAS DOING THE BRIEFING ON THE STAGE?No, I don't. All I know is that I want to say he was a colonel, full bird, and I'mpretty sure the person was from military intelligence. Those are my impressionsand from my experiences after with UFO recoveries and recovering debris andinformation thereof."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"But our being there created a problem, because while we were intent on tryingto figure out the film, we didn't notice that people came in behind us. When werealized, they immediately said, \"What are you two doing up here?\" And weturned around and said, \"Nothing. We're just eating our lunch.\" They said, \"Doyou have any idea how much trouble you're in?\" Well, they took us downstairs.They grabbed us and literally pushed us down the stairs. As soon as the stairs,no one even bothered to open the door. We were pushed out the door, pusheddown the steps leading up to the auditorium. They opened up the van door andpushed us on inside.\"To be continued:Part 2 - Description of non-human entities in Ft.
