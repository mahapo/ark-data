July 21, 2001 Alayla, Ethiopia - A graduate student named Yohannes Haile-Selassie studying paleontology at the University of California, Berkeley, foundbones on December 16, 1997 at a site 140 miles northeast of Ethiopia's capital,Addis Ababa, Ethiopia which might be the missing link in evolving primates thatwent on to become humans. This creature, Ardipithecus ramidus kadabba,might have been the first primate to walk upright and the oldest human ancestorwho lived in Ethiopian forests, not grassy plains, as far back as 5.8 million yearsago. That's a million and a half years earlier than any other previous discoveryand challenges the long held theory that primates stood up when they movedfrom trees to grassy plains.This past week, Yohannes Haile-Selassie's research was published for the firsttime in the journal Nature. He is still in Africa, but anthropologist BrianRichmond, Ph.D. at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champagne is familiarwith the work and talked to me this week about its significance.Interview:Brian Richmond, Ph.D., Asst. Professor of Anthropology, University ofIllinois at Urbana-Champagne, Urbana, Illinois: \"First of all, it's a veryexciting find. One of the most important things about it is that up until this time,up until a year ago, we had absolutely no information for the human fossilrecord prior to about 4.4 million years, until we go way back into the early aperecord. So what was really exciting about this is that it's filling a critical gap inour understanding of the earliest parts of human origins.ALMOST 6 MILLION YEARS AGO.Exactly, almost 6 million years ago. And based on DNA evidence, we believe"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"that chimpanzees and humans split off from one another somewhere between 5and 7 million years ago. So, this is the critical time period at which we mightfind the common ancestor that gave rise to both chimpanzees that live today andhumans that live today.HOW WILL IT BE DETERMINED WHETHER THIS NEW FIND 5.8MILLION YEARS AGO IN ETHIOPIA IS IN FACT AT THE ROOT OF THEHUMAN EVOLUTIONARY CHAIN OR THE CHIMPANZEE?The one key trait that defines all modern humans and all our fossil relatives isthe ability to walk upright on two legs. So, out of all our varied humancharacteristics like our large brains, our ability to speak, our ability to make anduse complicated tools and things like that, as we go back in the fossil record,those things appear later in time than the ability to walk upright which issomething that frees the hands for us to do other things. So, if there is goodevidence in the skeleton of walking upright on two legs, that would be reallystrong evidence that the species was on the human line, not the chimpanzee line.In fact, one of the bones they found was a toe bone and they suggest that - youmight ask, what can you tell from a toe bone? Well, a toe bone is one of thebones you might get a hint about how it walked around in the world. And thereis some indications on it that it might have been from an upright walker.This toe bone discovered in Ethiopia has a slant that suggests a footthat walked. Photograph provided by University of California, Berkeley.NOW CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THIS BEING A FIND INETHIOPIA WHERE IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WERE FORESTDWELLING CREATURES AS OPPOSED TO THE GRASSY PLAINS IN SAYTHE OLDUVAI GORGE IN KENYA?Yes, that is probably the most important find that has come out of this discoveryis that these fragmentary fossil remains are not found on grasslands, but in aforest environment. So, if they do represent one of the earliest human ancestors,that upsets one of the long-standing theories in human origins that a transitionfrom a forest environment to a more grassy, open environment was critical to theformation of early humans. The idea went that there were global climate changesgoing on at the time that caused forests in some parts of the world to shrink andgive rise to open grass lands. And that shrinking forest caused the early apes tobe forced to come down to the ground and they had to walk around on theground some way and one of those ways might have been upright walking. Sothere was an idea about a shift to an open grassy environment as being critical tothe earliest lineages of modern humans.This discovery showing the forest environment means that the early transition toupright walking must have taken place in a forest environment. And so thatreally changes our ideas and we're going to have to create some new hypotheses- we're able to reject some old ones, which is nice. But we have to refine somehypotheses to explain how it is that this earliest nudge toward humanity started.THE BRANCH BETWEEN CHIMPANZEES AND HUMANS - HAS THEREBEEN A MISSING LINK THERE JUST AS THERE HAS BEEN A MISSINGLINK BETWEEN SAY MORE MODERN NEANDERTHAL TOCRO-MAGNON? DO WE HAVE SEVERAL MISSING LINKS?That's a very good question. On the human side of things, even though we have a"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"sparse fossil record, we have over a dozen species from which we knowsomething about our own past. But not all the species lead directly to us. Someof those species were side branches that went extinct. And several of thosespecies lived even at the same time. So, only one of those branches leadeventually to us.What's remarkable is that we don't have a single fossil chimpanzee and that'swhat is going to make it all the harder to identify whether or not these early 5.5million year old remains belong to the early human lineage or if they belong toan early chimpanzee lineage.IF WE WENT BACK 40,000 YEARS ON THE PLANET ANDNEANDERTHAL WAS LIVING AND EXISTING, WHAT EXACTLY WASTHE PRECURSOR TO WHAT BECAME CRO-MAGNON HOMO SAPIENSSAPIENS THAT WE ARE TODAY?That's a tricky question to ask. Like what is the exact precursor to Cro-Magnon?There are a number of fossils from Europe that are broadly ancestral enoughthat might have given rise to Cro-Magnon. We wouldn't be able to link themdirectly as the ancestral lineage, but there are pools of fossils that representpopulations that might have given rise to Cro-Magnon. It seems that modernhumans originated as a species around 100,000 years ago in Africa and thendispersed throughout the rest of the world. So, the earliest ancestors of theCro-Magnon would have occurred in probably southern or eastern Africa.AND IS THAT HOMO ERECTUS OR LATER?That would be the earliest members of Homo sapiens, of our own species. Webelieve around 100,000 years ago the fossil evidence suggests there was atransition to a much more modern human-like form. They weren't exactlymodern like we are today. We would still be able to distinguish them from us,but they are much more modern than anything else we see before that time.By looking at DNA of people from across the globe, it appears that the mostdiversity in DNA occurs in Africa. Based on the diversity that is there in theDNA, it suggests that around 80 to 100 thousand years ago is when modernhumans as a species originated.AND THIS NEW FIND THAT GOES BACK 5.8 MILLION YEARS AGO ISPLACING A POSSIBLE ORIGIN FOR THAT WHICH BECAME ANUPRIGHT PRIMATE IN ETHIOPIA AND NOT IN THE GRASSY PLAINS?Exactly. And that part of Ethiopia - what is interesting there is they actuallyhave fossil sites that were grassy plain, or more grassy areas, and they have fossilsites in more wooded areas in the same region. And they are not finding thehominids in the open grassy areas. So it's fairly interesting that they are onlyfinding the hominids which are the early human ancestors, if that's what theyare, that they are finding those fossils in more wooded environments.I'M ALSO CURIOUS ABOUT GIGANTOPITHECUS. I'VE RECENTLY DONESOME RESEARCH WORK ON A PROGRAM FOR THE DISCOVERYCHANNEL ABOUT BIGFOOT/SASQUATCH TYPE CREATURES THATHAVE BEEN REPORTED IN VIETNAM AND LAOS AND ALL AROUNDTHE WORLD. AND SOME SCIENTISTS WONDER IF THERE IS SOMEBACKWATER CONNECTION TO GIGANTOPITHECUS THAT COULDSTILL BE RANGING AND ROAMING IN VERY REMOTE AREAS. WHATCAN YOU TELL US ABOUT GIGANTOPITHECUS?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Gigantopithecus skull reconstruction on far right.Center is male gorilla for comparison and human skull on left.Photograph © 1992 by Grover S. Krantz, Anthropologist.I wish I could tell you more than I can. The unfortunate truth aboutGigantopithecus is that we only have dental remains and a few scrappy remainslike parts of jaw bone for the species. It's clear from the teeth and jaw bone thatthis was the largest primate or ape that we've ever known, up to twice the size ofa gorilla. They were really very large animals. And so they have really capturedthe imaginations of paleo-anthropologists and the public.Despite pretty intense efforts, we have not been able to find any good skeletalevidence of these things. So, that really limits our understanding of the paleo-biology of this species. Now, it's clear that they persisted up to about a millionyears ago and co-existed with early members of human ancestors, Homo erectus.That's very interesting to contemplate how there might have been interaction insome way between Gigantopithecus, this giant ground dwelling primate, andHomo erectus in Asia. But there does not seem to be any relationshipconnection other than one that might go back to the origins of great apes ingen eral .FROM THE PHOTOGRAPHS I HAVE SEEN OF RECONSTRUCTION FROMTHE TEETH AND JAW YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT, THE HEAD OFTHE GIGANTOPITHECUS WOULD BE ALMOST TWO OR THREE TIMESLARGER THAN HOMO SAPIENS SKULL TODAY. WOULD THAT MEANTHEY COULD HAVE STOOD 15 FEET HIGH? OR TWELVE?Possibly twelve. I don't remember the exact dimensions, but I believe thereconstructions were based on the size of the jaw and what we know about thesize of the jaw and teeth in relationship to the rest of the body in apes today - itwould have to be a very, very large individuals. Clearly, they were the largestprimates we've ever run across. So, that's given rise to the ideas about therepossibly being a Bigfoot or Yeti that could be the Gigantopithecus in some way.These claims, there still is no good evidence for it yet, but it still fuels a lot ofimagination - the mythical Bigfoot or Yeti could be this living relics ofGigantopithecus. It's a fascinating idea, but right now, there really is not muchevidence for it.WHERE WOULD GIANTOPITHECUS HAVE ROAMED FROM WHERETHOSE BONES OF THE JAW WERE FOUND?Gigantopithecus is mostly known from parts of Asia, particularly in areas likePakistan, India, parts of eastern Asia. That's where we know it from. Someresearchers believe they had a dietary specialization on bamboo. So, if that's thecase, they would have followed the distribution of bamboo.AND THIS RECENT DISCOVERY CHANNEL EXPEDITION WASFOCUSED ON THE VERY REMOTE BORDER BETWEEN LAOS ANDVIETNAM.Yes, those are areas also where they have been finding evidence.\"More Information:DNA Precursor to Modern Man?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE QUESTION OF THE CURRENT TRANSITION FROM SAYNEANDERTHAL TO CRO-MAGNON HOMO SAPIENS SAPIENS IN THELAST 35,000 TO 40,000 YEARS, THE WORK THAT PABLO SVANTES DIDIN GERMANY AND AT THE UNIV. OF PENNSYLVANIA ON THAT ELBOWTHAT WAS FOUND IN NEANDER INDICATED THERE COULD NOT HAVEBEEN ANY SEXUAL INTERCOURSE BETWEEN NEANDERTHAL ANDWHAT BECAME CRO-MAGNON HOMO SAPIENS SAPIENS. IS THATSTILL A MISSING LINK THAT WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHO OURPRECURSOR IS TO MODERN HUMANITY?\"That's a good question and this Neanderthal DNA study is probably one of themost important works to be done in paleo-anthropology in the last ten years.And it's really amazing that they are able to get a substantial amount of DNA outof a bone that is that old. What they found, as you mentioned, is that the DNAthat came out of that Neanderthal specimen was so different from a largecollection of over 100 modern human DNA samples that it could not have, itwasn't any more closely related to modern humans than humans are to eachother. That means that all the humans form a cluster to the exclusion ofNeanderthal. That doesn't quite mean they didn't interbreed in some way, butwhat it does suggest is that Neanderthals did not contribute to the modernhuman gene pool. And that is a very important finding because some peoplehave seen Neanderthals as possibly being ancestral to Europeans, for example.And this research shows pretty clearly that Neanderthals lived side by side withthe early ancestors of modern humans, especially in the Europe region.But we do have good fossil evidence of things that seem to have given rise toboth Neanderthals and modern humans. So, we have clear missing links there,but Neanderthal is not one of the links that lead to modern humans.WHAT WOULD BE THE COMMON ANCESTOR?There are a number of fossils. Some of them have been found in Spain in the last10 years. Some people have given them a new species name which is Homoantecessor, but it's not clear if those fossils represent a different species or not.But they seem to be distinctive and general enough that they could have givenrise to both modern humans and Neanderthals.HOW FAR BACK DO THOSE BONES GO?Those bones go back over half a million years, so they are old enough and theyare in the right place and time that they could have broadly given rise to bothlineages. There is still a lot of controversy about exactly how, which fossils andwhich lineages at which times give rise to modern humans. But we do at thatpoint in time have a pretty decent fossil record. It's almost a matter of anembarrassment of riches making it more difficult to find the answer because ifyou think about it, as we find more and more fossils, we are starting to get sucha high resolution that it's hard to tell species apart because you're getting on theorder of tens and hundreds of generations. At that point, it's hard to find wherepopulations split and gave rise to different species.WERE THE HILLS IN WHICH THE FRENCH FOUND THE BONESFORESTED OR GRASSY?Actually, the paleo-environment in which these remains were found - today it's afairly open desert landscape, but 6 million years ago this was a fairly wet forest.So this is also confirming the ideas that the earliest ancestors, if these are humanancestors. It's possible they are not. But if these are early human ancestors andthey are occurring in wooded environments again bolsters the idea that theearliest thing that happened in human evolution to walk upright occurred in aforest environment. So theories have to accommodate that.CHANGE THE OLD IDEA OF MOVING OUT INTO GRASSY PLAINS.Exactly. The only thing I would add is that just this last fall, there was anotherearly possible human ancestor discovery in the form of a fossil discovered by a"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"French team, Orrorin (local Kenyan name for root or base) tugenensis (placewhere bones found in the Tugen Hills of Kenya ). And they claim that it is theoldest human ancestor, right at the base of the human family tree. So at 6million years of age, it is very close in age to the 5.5 to 5.8 million yeardiscovery by the team in Ethiopia. So there is a little disagreement betweenthese two groups about which might be the oldest ancestor. Or is either a humanancestor? And it illustrates the difficulty in trying to distinguish what might behuman versus a chimpanzee ancestor versus an extinct line of apes at that pointin time.WHERE DID THE FRENCH FIND THE 6 MILLION BONES?The French team lead by a woman named Brigitte Senut and a professor by thename of Martin Pickford, they discovered these finds in Kenya just this lastOctober or November. They also claim this was an upright walker. They have ahip bone that is consistent with that, but right now the evidence is not 100%compelling. So there is still some more research for them to do to at least provewhether or not it was an upright walker. Right now, it's amazing. Ten years ago,we really didn't know much about this time period. And just in the last year anda half, there has been this real boom for anthropology.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
