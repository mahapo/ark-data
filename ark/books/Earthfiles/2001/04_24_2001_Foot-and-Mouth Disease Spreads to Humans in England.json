Photograph © 2001 by Associated Press.April 24, 2001 Plum Island east of Orient, Long Island, New York - Todayin England, three suspected cases of human foot-and-mouth disease are beinginvestigated by the British Public Health Laboratory. One of the patients is aman from Cumbria who developed blisters in his mouth and sore, itchy handswhile working on a crew slaughtering hoofed animals infected withfoot-and-mouth disease. Officials are waiting to hear from laboratory test resultswhich should be in next week. If the humans test positive for foot-and-mouthdisease, it means the virus moved from animals to people.This has happened before. Foot-and-mouth disease has been around the worldfor a long time. To date, medical authorities say there are at least 35 humancases of foot-and-mouth disease on record. However, in humans the virus is verymild. Symptoms of blisters last a few days and then the disease is gone. But inhoofed animals, the foot-and-mouth virus hits hard, is the most contagious virusknown and is hard to stop once it flares up, as Great Britain has been learningfirst hand since February.The total number of confirmed cases in the U.K. is 1,465, with 13 new onesreported today. To counter the virus epidemic, Britain has slaughtered1,974,000 cows, sheep and other hoofed animals. A quarter million animals areleft to slaughter.The Dutch Agriculture Ministry has also been slaughtering animals, at least80,000 after ten cases of foot-and-mouth disease were confirmed the end ofMarch. The Dutch tried to avoid Britain's dependence on slaughter and were thefirst to seek and gain permission to vaccinate animals around infected farms. Butas the virus spread, officials decided they had to kill potentially infected herds.In France where only two cases of foot-and-mouth disease were confirmed, thegovernment is waiting and monitoring to see if the virus has been stopped."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"63 grams of dioxins were emitted from burning dead FMD animals,which is nearly the total amount released from all of England's factories in a year.Photograph © 2001 by Associated Press.In England protesters are worried about airborne contaminations and pollutants.Many have challenged and blocked the burning of thousands of dead, diseasedanimals on huge cremation piles forcing the British government to try bury thecarcasses despite high water tables on the island. Some people claim their wellwater is now poisoned and the U. K. government has had to finally admit thatall the burning of dead animals covered with chlorine-bearing disinfectants,pesticides and other chemicals has now produced massive airborne emissions ofthe carcinogenic poison, dioxin. Scientists say that so far 63 grams of dioxinswere emitted from burning dead animals, which is nearly the amount releasedfrom all of England's factories in a year! Dioxins are so toxic that the WorldHealth Organization recommends that the average-sized person not be exposedto more than 30 billionths of a gram in any year. That means that burning all theslaughter foot-and-mouth carcasses has now delivered a dangerous dose ofdioxin throughout the English countryside.Making all of this even worse if possible, dioxin contamination of soil and watercan last for years afterwards. Environmental organizations are telling the mediathe dioxin levels are shocking and expect farmland to be \"unusable as a result ofthe Government's short-sighted obsession with slaughter.\"So, why is there an official obsession with slaughtering nearly two millionanimals in the face of a virus that does not usually kill and its victims eventuallyget well? Why not vaccinate instead?This morning I asked that question of Dr. Tom McKenna, Veterinarian andMicrobiologist who is Laboratory Chief of the Foreign Animal DiseaseDiagnostic Laboratory at Plum Island off the tip of Long Island, New York.Plum Island was originally used as a Department of Defense Army base. Then inthe early 1950s, it became the property of the U. S. Department of Agriculturein order to have an isolated place for scientists to work on many different anddangerous microbes without any direct bridge, tunnel or other connection to theAmerican mainland. The particular laboratory run by Dr. McKenna has beenstudying foot-and-mouth disease since outbreaks in the 1950s in Mexico andCanada put the U. S. on notice that it had to better understand the contagiousvirus to better protect domestic herds. Here is Dr. McKenna beginning with thequestion: why not vaccinate instead of slaughter?Interview:Tom McKenna, D.V.M., Laboratory Chief, Foreign Animal DiseaseDiagnostic Laboratory, U. S. Department of Agriculture, Plus Island,Orient, New York: \"The reason why vaccination is not done by many countriesis that if you vaccinate, then your livestock products will not be welcome incountries which are free of FMD. And the reason for that is that vaccinatedanimals can become infected and actually be carriers of the virus withoutshowing clinical signs. Because the disease spreads so fast and can be sodevastating, countries without FMD don't want to take that chance of importing"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"animal goods and live animals from countries which do vaccinate. So, if youwant to be active in the international arena of trade, you can'' afford to vaccinatefor FMD.AFTER THIS TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE IN ENGLAND OVER THELAST 2 OR 3 MONTHS, DON'T YOU THINK POSSIBLY THE ENTIREWORLD PERSPECTIVE ON HOW TO DEAL WITH FMD SHOULD BECHANGED AND THERE BE UNIVERSALLY VACCINATION?What we are seeing on the television, you know, it hurts your heart. Thesedecisions are not made easily and as we said earlier, with the world watchinghow this approach plays out, it may force some new dialogue in the future.And I think the countries around the world will probably look at how to handleit better in the future. There is new technology being developed, both in thevaccine field and the diagnostic field, which would allow the differentiationbetween vaccinated animals and infected animals. Once that science has beenproven, I think the trading people may be able to allow some vaccination in theface of an outbreak, but all of that will have to be worked out between tradingpartners and it won't happen in 2 or 3 months. It will be a longer process.ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME TYPEOF BLOOD TEST?Right, a test that will look at antibodies in the animals. And you could tell,differentiate a vaccinated animal from an infected animal. Or the otherpossibility is an animal that is vaccinated and infected. And it would beimportant to clearly tell one from the other if you were going to allowvaccination to proceed along with trade.YOU SAID THIS PARTICULAR STRAIN OF VIRUS - AND IUNDERSTAND THERE ARE AT LEAST 7 STRAINS OF FMD VIRUS. ISTHAT CORRECT?Yes. There are 7 major sero types of FMD and within each of those sero types,there are many sub-sero types. This particular virus is a sub-sero type of the Ovirus and it just seems to be a little more infectious, a little more virulent thansome of the strains we've seen prior to this.WE ARE DEALING WITH A VIRULENT STRAIN OF FMD CLEARLY,AND COULD THIS VIRUS BE AIRBORNE AS WELL ASBODY-TO-BODY CONTACT?Yes, there is some data that shows FMD can be spread by aerosol or on thewind. Exactly how much a role that plays, I'm not sure how far it could blowand still cause disease. I'm not sure, but that is one of the ways FMD can spread,through aerosols on the wind. But the primary way of spread is contact betweeninfected animals or the virus being moved on vehicles or people to susceptibleanimals.NOW HAVING THAT KNOWLEDGE IN ENGLAND, WHY DO YOUTHINK THE GOVERNMENT IN THE BEGINNING INSISTED THATPILES, LITERALLY OF HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OFANIMALS, BE PILED UP AND BURNED?Once the animal is dead, it is excreting very little virus. There is some virus inthe animal itself, the dead carcass. But the way the aerosol would be a threat isthe infected animal and primarily pigs are the ones that breathe out a lot of viruswhen they are infected. So with each breath, you would be throwing a lot ofvirus into the air and then theoretically, the wind could carry that virus to aneighboring farm. That's why there is such an urgency to kill infected animals toreduce the amount of virus that is in the environment. Once the animals aredead, the viral replication really stops and the production of virus and therelease of virus into the environment becomes virtually zero.DO YOU THINK THERE IS JUSTIFICATION IN KILLING 500 OR 1000SHEEP ESPECIALLY IN A FARM OR NEARBY FARMS WHERE"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THERE HAS BEEN NO EVIDENCE OF THE DISEASE, BUT BRITAINHAS TAKEN THE POSITION THAT THEY NEEDED \"FIRE WALLS\"TO STOP THE SPREAD OF FMD?I think the philosophy on this type of approach is similar to surgery for cancer.When you have a tumor in a body, when you do surgery, you take out a lot ofhealthy tissue around that tumor to make sure you have gotten all the tumor.And you are willing to sacrifice some healthy cells in order to protect the wholebody. If you were to get just the affected cells with the cancer, you might leavebehind some and then the cancer could flare up again. And I think that is a goodanalogy for this. When there has been exposure, you are taking a tremendousrisk if you wait for those animals to get sick and spread disease. Whereas if yougo in right away and kill all the animals that have been exposed, you have acertain peace of mind that the virus will not spread beyond where you havespotted it.\"WHY NOT LET THE HERDS GET SICK AND GET WELL AND HAVETHEM ALL HAVE THE IMMUNITY TO PASS ON TO THE YOUNGONES AND NOT GO THROUGH THIS HORRIBLE CRISIS OFSLAUGHTER?I think that cost of the animals being sick for two weeks that is an important costthat will be passed on to consumers. So if you can, the less disease that animalshave, the better their livelihood and ultimately the cheaper the product to theconsumer. So I think the goal of all producers is to reduce the amount of diseaseproducers can have in their herds and flocks.DID YOU EXPECT THERE COULD BE AN OUTBREAK IN A PLACELIKE ENGLAND?Because FMD is one of the most contagious agents known to man since it ispresent in other parts of the world, there is always a threat that it's going tospread. And beginning about 5 years ago this particular strain of foot-and-mouthseemed to escape from Asia and it has shown up in many countries. There havebeen outbreaks in countries that haven't had foot-and-mouth for decades. Thisincludes Taiwan, Japan, Korea, South Africa and Britain, of course.BUT WHY ENGLAND SO VICIOUSLY?It was a big surprise to us to hear that England had FMD outbreak. We havebeen surprised at how fast this virus has shown up in other countries. I think it isa combination of a large population of animals which are naive, because theyhave not been vaccinated and that's all tied up with international trade, and thenthe way livestock production where you have large numbers of animals and theyare close to each other and traffic between farms. As I said, this is one of themost contagious agents known to man and once it gets going it spreads likewildfire.\"More Information:Dr. McKenna said his Plum Island laboratory has tracked outbreaks of thiscurrent \"O\" strain of foot-and-mouth virus over the past five years in Asia,including Taiwan, Japan, and Korea; South Africa and Argentina. But he says heand his colleagues were surprised that the virus flared up so virulently in Britain.Dr. McKenna: \"I think it is a combination of a large population of animalswhich are naive, because they have not been vaccinated and that's all tied upwith international trade, and then the way livestock production where you havelarge numbers of animals and they are close to each other and traffic betweenfarms.
