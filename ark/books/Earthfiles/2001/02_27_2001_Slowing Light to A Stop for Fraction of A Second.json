One group is led by Lene VestergaardHau, Ph.D. of Harvard University and the Rowland Institute for Science inCambridge, Mass. The second group was lead by Ronald L. Walsworth, Ph.D.,and Mikhail D. Lukin, Ph.D. of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center forAstrophysics, also in Cambridge, with colleagues Dr. David Phillips, AnnetFleischhauer and Dr. Alois Mair.David Phillips, Ph.D., Alois Mair, Ph.D., Ron Walsworth, Ph.D., Mikhail Lukin, Ph.D.,physics teamin Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics laboratory, Cambridge, Massachusettswith laser apparatus used to slow down and \"stop\" light in glass cell of rubidium gas.Photograph courtesy Prof. Ron Walsworth and Dr. David Phillips.I talked with both Dr. Walsworth and Dr. Phillips about what was happening atthe atomic level between the rubidium gas atoms and laser photons. Physicists"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"call it storing information in the form of an atomic \"spin wave\" where therubidium atoms are excited into a new state. \"Spin\" is used to describe tinymagnetic vectors in each of the gas atoms.Dr. Walsworth provided his graphic which shows the first step is shining a\"control\" laser beam on a small glass cell filled with rubidium vapor which putsthe atoms in an altered state of spin in which they cannot absorb light normally.Then a second \"signal pulse\" of light is sent which contains the information thephysicists want to store in the gas atoms. As that second pulse enters the cellfilled with rubidium atoms, the photons slow down and interact with the atomschanging the atoms' spin states in a joint atom-photon system known as a\"polariton.\"If the second laser beam is turned off, the first beam continues trying to alter theatoms' spin patterns as if imprinted by the second signal pulse. As it does, thosephotons slow down and \"virtually disappear,\" or \"stop\" for a fraction of asecond. Then when the second laser is turned back on, the photons struggling toalter the rubidium atom spins are \"reactivated\" and go on their way.Graphic © 2001 by Ronald L. Walsworth, Ph.D.,Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.Physi cs News said this historic lab demonstration \"increases the promise forquantum communication, which may someday be used to connect potentiallyultrafast quantum computers in a large network analogous to the Internet.Usually photons (quanta of light) are absorbed by atoms, destroying theinformation carried by the light. With the present (Walsworth et al) method, inprinciple, no information in the light pulse is lost.\"Interview:David Phillips, Ph.D., Atomic Physicist and Staff Scientist, HarvardSmithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, Massachusetts: \"Whatwe do in our experiment is to actually store the information described in a lightpulse inside a cell full of atoms. What we do is start with a glass cell about 3inches long and 3/4 of an inch in diameter that's hollow on the inside and filled"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"with a dilute gas of rubidium atoms. We shine a laser on to the rubidium atomsthat puts all the rubidium atoms into one particular electronic quantummechanical state. Then with that first laser still on, we apply a pulse of lightfrom a second laser. As that pulse of light enters the cell full of atoms, it slowsdown due to its interaction with those atoms.It's as though the pulse were swimming through water. It has to push its waythrough and similarly, the pulse of light has to push its way through this cloudof rubidium atoms. And that slows it down. And it's not so much as bouncing offit as it is changing information between the two. While the pulse of light istraversing the cell, we turn the intensity of that first control laser down to zeroand the information contained in the light pulse is transferred from the lightpulse into the atoms. It can then sit in the cell for some length of time that wecontrol until we turn that first control laser back on. Then the pulse of light, orits signal retained in the spin of the rubidium atoms, is converted back into lightand leaves the cell.So what we've done is to store the information contained in the light pulse insideour cell. The nature of that stored information so far has been to preserve thewidth and height of the laser pulse.THE PULSE GOES INTO THE RUBIDIUM MOLECULES OF GAS?Ye s .WHATEVER THE SHAPE OF THE PULSE IS TRANSFERRED INTOTHOSE RUBIDIUM MOLECULES?Yes. The energy associated with those pulses, the energy in each photon - howwide the pulse was, how tall the pulse was, that there was a pulse there at all.For example, if you are imagining this as a storage device to send telephoneinformation you could imagine encoding the voice signals.Graphic by David Phillips, Ph.D. which shows: \"Converting a coherent light signal into acoherent atom state.(a) A light signal (consisting of information encoded in a laser beam) approaches a cellcontaining rubidium atoms.Normally the Rb atoms would absorb the signal light. However, a control beam (also laserlight) is adjusted to createa condition of \"electromagnetically induced transparency\" (EIT) in the cell, and the signalbeam is not absorbed.(b) As the signal pulse enters the cell, it undergoes a dramatic spatial compression since thefront edge is slowed first.At the same time atomic spins are being flipped: the signal and the spins form a coupledexcitation called a 'polariton.'(c) After the signal is entirely in the cell, one begins to reduce the intensity of the control"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"beam. As a result,the velocity of the polariton is being reduced, the amplitude of the signal light decreaseswhile more and more spinsare flipped. (d) Control beam is off. No signal photons are left, all information is stored inthe form of excited spins.(e-f) The process can be reversed. The light pulse departs at the normal speed of light,while the atomic vaporis left as it was before the signal pulse arrived.\"WHAT IS IT ABOUT RUBIDIUM GAS MOLECULES THAT WOULDHOLD THIS INFORMATION?It's the quantum mechanical spin of the atoms, primarily of the outer electron ofthe rubidium atom. So, what we do with the control laser is to put all therubidium atoms into one state, to make the spin point in one particular direction.And then as the pulse of light comes in, it rotates that spin and when the controllaser is shut off, the information describing the pulse is converted into thedirection the spins are all pointing. So instead of all pointing the same direction,the spins have been rotated a little bit and that represents the pulse.WHICH PART OF THIS NOW APPLIES TO STOPPING LIGHT UNTILPHOTONS ARE SENT ON THEIR WAY?We can leave the atoms sitting there with their spins rotated for some time thatwe control that might be 1/10,000th/second and then we turn back on thecontrol laser beam and it reads out the rotation of the spins and reconstructs theoriginal pulse. Then having had the information sitting in these atomic states, thecontrol laser extracts that signal and recreates the initial light pulse. So then wego back to the situation in which the atoms all have their spins in the samedirection. All the info has been removed from them and the light pulse has beenrecreated and propagates along its way.IT''S CONFUSING WHEN WE ARE TAUGHT THAT LIGHT, ATLEAST IN A VACUUM, ALWAYS TRAVELS AT 186,000 MILES PERSECOND. CAN YOU EXTRAPOLATE FROM THIS RESEARCH INTOSOME DATE IN THE FUTURE WHERE WE WOULD BE ABLE TOSTOP PHOTONS IN THEIR TRACKS?No. A photon will always travel at the speed of light. You can never bring aphoton to rest. That's certainly true. But what you can do is bring the light pulseto rest, bring the info describing that light pulse to rest. But the photonsthemselves propagate on their way and leave the cell, leaving only theirinformation in it.SINCE YOU CAN'T STOP OR STORE PHOTONS THEMSELVESWHICH ARE ALWAYS TRAVELING AT 186,000 MILES/SECOND,YOU ARE TRYING TO PUT INFORMATION ON PHOTONS THATCAN THEN BE IMPARTED TO A GAS LIKE RUBIDIUM AND THAT ISTHE GOAL?Yes, that is correct. So, instead of being interested in the energy of the photons,we are interested in the information. We want to take the info and encode it inthe photon and store that and extract it at some later time.Quantum ComputersThat has potential applications in ideas of quantum information processing andalso it helps us to understand interactions between light and matter which is athing that atomic physicists have been interested in for a very long time now. Wewant to understand in detail what really happens when atoms and photonsinteract with each other. How can we control those interactions in a verydetailed way?So those are the two motivations for doing this experiment, in addition to thefact that it was a lot of fun:1) to be able to understand how photons and atoms interact;2) to study possible mechanisms for transporting quantum information which ispotentially useful in quantum computers that people will try to build over thenext decades."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"HOW WOULD IT APPLY TO COMPUTERS?In a computer that sits on your desk today, the calculations are performed bytransistors which are collections of atoms in little films of metal through whichelectrons flow. That information has to be transported between differentelements inside the computer in order to be stored in memory, read back frommemory and returned back to a central processing unit. And that's done inside acomputer today by having electrons flow.In quantum computers - if physicists ever figure out how to build them - ratherthan using classical zeros and ones known as bits to store the information,quantum states will be used. That would allow you to use more than a singlezero or one. A quantum state can be several positions at once, a little bit of zeroand a little bit of one. Calculations with those can be done using ideas fromphysics about how atoms interact with each other.DO YOU MEAN THAT WHAT WE CALL THE ZERO AND ONESTORAGE IN COMPUTERS TODAY IN INTEGRATED CIRCUITS,THEN BECOMES ZERO, ONE AND SHADES OF GRAY ATLITERALLY THE ATOMIC LEVEL IN FUTURE COMPUTERS?Yes. That's correct.THE ATOMS THEMSELVES, THEIR SPIN DIRECTIONS, IS WHATYOU WOULD BE USING TO STORE INFORMATION AND RELEASEINFORMATION?Yes. A natural place to store quantum information is inside atoms, but it's hardto move them from place to place maintaining that information. It's much easierto transport information using light. And so this new research slowing photonsand transferring a signal to the gas atoms spin direction suggests how totransport quantum information from one ensemble of atoms to another. But westarted with light that went into atoms and extracted it back out again. In orderto transport info inside a quantum computer, you would have to start with infoin atoms and extract it out into light and then write it back into atoms. But thetheory that describes that is exactly the same theory that describes theexperiments we did.DOES THAT MEAN THAT COMPUTERS IN THE FUTURE WOULDLOOK LIKE THEY HAD CRYSTAL COMPONENTS THROUGHWHICH NOTHING WAS MOVING EXCEPT LIGHT?That's entirely possible. These ideas are all very speculative today and it's hardto imagine whether people will actually succeed in building quantum computersand if they do succeed, how long it's going to take. If they do succeed inbuilding quantum computers, will they sit on desks, or just be a few of them thatsit in big laboratories? If they work at all, it's going to take some decades andwill be used for very specialized tasks.THOSE QUANTUM COMPUTERS BY DEFINITION WOULD NOTHAVE WIRES AND INTEGRATED CIRCUITS IN THEM. THEYWOULD HAVE TO HAVE SOME SORT OF TRANSPORT MECHANISMFOR LIGHT?That's the most natural way we see to do it. Once again, what the future willbring, what new ideas people will have, I don't want to limit anything cleverabout what might happen. Maybe people will figure out how to transportinformation using electrons, or using something else. But the most obvious wayto do it at this stage is light. And so yes, you would imagine crystals in whichinteractions took place and in which light beams propagated around to transportthe information.WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CRYSTALSTRANSPORTING LIGHT IN A QUANTUM COMPUTER AND FIBEROPTICS TRANSPORTING LIGHT IN OUR TELEPHONES ANDCOMPUTERS TODAY?In a fundamental sense, they are not so different. One of the issues that we don't"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"have to worry about today in a light fiber transporting information via photons iswhether the quantum nature of things is preserved, or whether in the act oftraveling down the fiber that the quantum aspects of information are destroyed.HOW WOULD YOU DEFINE QUANTUM INFORMATION?One of the interesting things that quantum mechanics says is that you can havetwo atoms or two photons or two quantum mechanical objects that are separatedby great distances and yet are connected. So if you do a measurement upon one,that tells you what the answer of measuring the other will be.Bell's Theorem and the Spooky Connection of All PhotonsTHAT RELATES TO BELL'S THEOREM WHERE THEYEXPERIMENTED WITH PHOTON SPIN AND THE DEDUCTION WASTHAT IN SOME WAY EVERY PHOTON IN THE UNIVERSE KNOWSTHE SPIN DIRECTION OF ALL THE OTHER PHOTONS?Yes. And Einstein had some wonderful quote about spooky action at a distanceand that spookiness is the heart of quantum computing. And so in order totransport quantum information, you have to be able to transport that weirdconnection that quantum mechanics tells us can develop between pairs ofphotons or pairs of electrons or pairs of atoms. Potentially using these ideas thatwe are just beginning to demonstrate. We haven't done experiments trying toverify the quantum nature yet, because they are harder than what we've done sofar. But the theory says that we can use these ideas to create one ensemble ofatoms sitting in one of these cells on one table. We can then extract half of thequantum information from it and transport to a cell sitting on a different tablewhere information is simultaneously transferred into another set of atoms in thatstrange Bell's Theorem way.AND DO IT ALL WITHOUT WIRES.Correct.IT'S ALMOST AS IF IT IS SYMPATHETIC RESONANCE.Yeah, in a sense. And that's both interesting for elucidating the nature ofquantum measurement and quantum entanglement. It's also useful in trying tounderstand how to construct a quantum computer.YOU COULD HAVE A NETWORK OF COMPUTERS THAT WERENOT CONNECTED AS SUCH, BUT HAD CRYSTALS WITH LIGHTRUNNING THROUGH THEM WHERE THE PHOTONS THEMSELVESWERE IMPARTING ENCODED INFORMATION WITHOUT HAVINGANY PHYSICAL CONNECTION?Yes. You can have several quantum computers in separate locations all workingon the same problem at the same time because they are entangled in thatquantum mechanical way. I believe that is correct. Now, once again we are along way from even knowing how to build a quantum computer. So, these areall dreams of the future. But there are a lot of very smart people working onthese ideas and so probably these dreams will come true sooner than weskeptical physicists would guess.Future Photon ResearchWHAT'S THE NEXT STEP IN YOUR RESEARCH?There are two things we are setting up to do next. The first is to clean up ourexisting experiment and do it better than we've done it so far. In our current setup, we can only store about half the pulse that moves through our cell and wecan only store it for a few hundred microseconds. We'd like to be able to store itfor 10 to 100 times longer and we would like to store closer to 98% of it, or99%, of it rather than just 50% of it.The next thing we would like to do is demonstrate that we can transportquantum information as well as classical info. And that involves building a newand more sophisticated apparatus and we are just starting now to go out and getthe money to do things like that."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION IN SOME DISTANT FUTUREWOULD BE QUANTUM COMPUTERS IN WHICH LIGHT IS THEMECHANISM FOR MOVING INFORMATION?Yes, that's correct.\"More Information:See: \"Storage of Light in Atomic Vapor,\" Physical Review Letters, January 29,2001, Vol. 86, Issue 5, pp. 783-786.We b s it e s :http://www.aip.org/physnews/update/521-1.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
