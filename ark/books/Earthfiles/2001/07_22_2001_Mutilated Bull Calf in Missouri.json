And I had a cow that was bawling. She had a bag that waspuffed up and I knew she hadn't been sucked. So I started checking around andfound a dead calf.HOW FAR WAS THE DEAD CALF FROM THE BAWLING MOTHER?She was pretty close to him when I first saw her. But she did not stay aroundmuch. For some reason, she and none of the other cows came close. Usuallythey'll all stand around and bawl for two or three days (if a calf dies).DID YOU GET THE IDEA THAT THE MOTHER COW DIDN'T WANTTO GET CLOSE TO THE CALF?Right. She was strange. The whole herd was strange for a day or two. Theystood around in a bunch and didn't want to move out. You could tell thatsomething spooked them pretty bad that night, I'd say.THEY DID STAND AROUND IN A BUNCH?Right.THAT'S HAPPENED IN MUTILATIONS LOTS OF TIMES.It was not hard to tell that these cattle had seen something strange. I don't knowwhat it was, but they were shook up for two or three days.THIS WAS A 350 POUND CHAROLAIS BULL CALF. HOW OLD?He was born back in early February, so about four months old.WHAT WERE YOUR FIRST IMPRESSIONS AS YOU WALKEDTOWARDS IT?Well, after I noticed the mother cow hadn't been sucked, I figured I lost a calffrom black leg or something. You do that occasionally. But when I first walkedup there and seen the calf and it was mutilated I knew right then he hadn't diedof natural causes. As soon as I walked up there.HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG?I could see how he had been mutilated. His testicles had been cut out and hisrear end had been cut out and his tongue was half gone (deep in the throat) andhis ear was gone and one eye was plucked out. And his penis was gone. Noblood. There wasn't a drop of blood nowhere around him.THIS IS A WHITE HAIR.Right, white Charolais calf.DID YOU CALL A VET?No, I didn't.HAVE YOU EVER HAD A CASE LIKE THIS BEFORE?Yeah, I had one ten or twelve years ago.WAS IT ALSO A CALF?Yes, a heifer calf.WAS IT THE SAME THING WITH SAME PATTERN OF EXCISIONS?Yes, mutilated the same way.WAS IT IN THE SAME LOCATION OF THE PASTURE?o, not too far apart, but in a different pasture.DID YOU TAKE PHOTOS OF THIS NEW ONE?No, I didn't. But the cops did. (Dade County Sheriff's Department)WHICH SIDE WERE THE EAR AND EYE TAKEN FROM?It was lying on his right side, so that would be the left ear.WAS IT CUT DOWN TO THE SCALP?No, it was cut about half way down.ON THE EYE, WAS THERE ANY TISSUE REMOVED AROUND THE"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"EYE?No, that eye looked like it had been sucked out. There weren't any cuts aroundit. There wasn't a scar around it nowhere. It looked like it had been plucked outsome how. I don't know how.WAS ANY OF THE HIDE REMOVED FROM THE SIDE OF THE FACEOR JAW?Nope. But I've heard of them doing that, though.BUT WHEN YOU OPENED UP THE MOUTH, THE TONGUE WASREMOVED?Yes, as far down as you could reach the tongue had been cut out.AS YOU CAME DOWN THE NECK, DID YOU LOOK FOR ANY KINDOF PUNCTURE HOLES AROUND THE NECK OR THE CHEST?Well, I didn't look real close. The neighbors and I, we all looked around and wecouldn't see any sign that it had been punctured with anything.WHERE THE PENIS AND TESTICLES HAD BEEN, HOW WOULDYOU DESCRIBE HOW THEY WERE REMOVED? WAS THERE ACIRCLE OR OVAL ONLY HIDE DEEP?It was just like they had been cut off in a circle. Cut completely off. There was around hole where they had been. Wasn't no flesh, just the bag that the testicleswere in was gone and the penis had been pulled out, it looked like. Wasn't nomeat or anything there. Weird.YES, AND THE RECTUM?There was a perfect incision there. Looked like may be 5 or 6 inches had beenpulled out of it and cut off. Just a perfect circle around where it was.THERE WAS A HOLE THAT WENT INTO THE ANUS, LIKE A PLUGOF TISSUE HAD BEEN REMOVED?Yes, I believe so.SPRINGFIELD IS AN AREA WHERE THERE HAVE BEENMUTILATIONS BEFORE?Well, I know ten years ago when I lost that first calf, I heard about mutilationsquite a bit. But I haven't heard about it for the last few years, it seemed like.We've tried to find a place that looked like anything had landed in the pastureand burned the grass. I've heard of that. But we looked all over the pasture andcouldn't see no place where anything had landed. And where this calf was, thegrass was pretty tall around there. There wasn't a thing mashed down. The calflooked like he had just fell down there and there wasn't no dress stompedaround him or nothing! I mean it's unbelievable.DID YOU TALK WITH ANY OF YOUR NEIGHBORS TO SEE IFANYBODY NOTICED OR HEARD ANYTHING UNUSUAL THATNIGHT BEFORE?No, I don't think any of them had. If they did, they would have said somethingprobably.ANY OTHER MUTILATION REPORTS IN YOUR AREA IN THE LASTTWO OR THREE YEARS?There was one down around Stockton, I think, in 2000. In that one, our sonknew a man who lost a calf there and they must have done an autopsy on it andthe heart was gone and they didn't know how the heart was gone. I think the vetwas Max Smith.THAT HAS HAPPENED IN OTHER ANIMALS. NO INCISIONS ONTHE SURFACE OF THE BODY, BUT EXCISIONS OF INTERNALORGANS DISCOVERED DURING NECROPSIES.That's scary.WHAT'S THE STATUS ON THE SHERIFF'S INVESTIGATION? ANY"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"NECROPSY OR LAB ANALYSIS?No, they didn't say anything. He just laid there and eventually the varmints atepart of him, I guess. Predators won't hardly touch them mutilated animals fortwo or three days for some reason.DID YOU NOTICE THAT ON THIS ONE?Yes. In fact, I don't think the coyotes ever bothered him. The only thing that Ithink bothered him was the buzzards after two or three days. They pecked onhim a little. But he laid over there and nothing happened for quite awhile. That'sanother strange thing about it.WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FIRST MUTILATION, THE FEMALE?It happened the same way, just like this one. I just let it lay there, too. Hardlyanything touched that one. It finally just dried up.I THINK SOME KIND OF TECHNOLOGY IS USED ON THEEXCISIONS.And the coyotes and other cows can tell because they know something is wrong.That mother cow should have stood around and cried for a week, you know would have stayed right there with him. But she just walked off and wouldn'thave anything to do with him.DO YOU KNOW OF ANY CONNECTION IN THE BLOOD LINESBETWEEN THE BULL CALF THIS YEAR AND YOUR HEIFER CALFTEN YEARS AGO?No. I don't think so.WHERE DID YOU PURCHASE THE STOCK TO BEGIN WITH?I buy them at the sale barns around.YOU WOULDN'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT THE EXACTBLOODLINE WOULD BE?No, I wouldn't.\"More Information:If you have any information about this or other animal mutilations in Missouri orsurrounding region, please contact the Dade County Sheriff's Department at417-637-5344.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
