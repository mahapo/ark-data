I looked at a few pictures around (area)and couldn't find anything to explain it.Very puzzling! These are huge boulders.There are no indications of any outcropsthat could shed such boulders.\"- Michael Carr, U. S. Geological Survey -Scattered 80-foot dark boulders - from where?Nilosyrtis Mensae Valleys, mid-Martian latitude.High resolution image is 3 kilometers wide by 4.9 kilometers vertical(1.9 miles by 3 miles) taken on February 14, 2001 by the Red Rover Goesto Mars International Student Training Mission.Image courtesy of NASA/JPL/Malin Space Sciences Systems.February 25, 2001 Carlsbad, California - On February 14 while NASA'sNear spacecraft was making its historic landing on the Eros asteroid betweenMars and Jupiter, a camera on the Mars Global Surveyor orbiting the red planetwas under the guidance of an international group of four girls and five boys aged10 to 15 known as the Red Rover Goes to Mars team.\"The students were the first members of the public to direct a camera aboard aspacecraft orbiting another world,\" said a Planetary Society press release. Thenine students gathered at Malin Space Science Systems in Carlsbad, California.Planetary scientist, Michael Malin who built and operates the Mars GlobalSurveyor camera, opened his offices to the students from Brazil, Hungary, India,Poland, Taiwan and the U. S. as part of an educational opportunity sponsoredby NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and LEGOLAND of California.The students were allowed to target three high resolution images at threedifferent sites that \"coincided with the MGS spacecraft's orbital position duringthe February 11-16 week of their visit. Michael Malin, Ken Edgett and BeckyWilliams of Malin Space Science Systems personally supervised the StudentScientists.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"One of those photographs in the Nilosyrtis Mensae Valleys has surprisedeveryone at 31.2 degrees North and 289.5 degrees West. The students wroteabout their photograph, \"This image was taken in the fretted terrain area locatedin the middle latitude of Mars. Black boulders are as big as 15 to 25 meters (49to 82 feet). The puzzling position of these mysterious rocks and the lack of ourability to understand how they got there reminds us how much there is still leftto discover about the mystery planet.\"Larger surrounding region on Mars of Nilosyrtis Mensae Valleys,mid-Martian latitude.

Geological Survey.Dr. Malin said, \"The location and nature of these boulders is unusual, but theirshape and distribution - in respect to the slope upon which they sit - isconsistent with a boulder shattered by weathering. The fall to their presentlocation could also have broken the boulders apart. The mystery is why so muchof the rest of the slope is smooth and devoid of rocks.\"This weekend I asked Dr. Ron Greeley, a geologist at Arizona State Universitywho also worked on the 1976 Viking mission to Mars, what he thought aboutthe new photograph.Interview:Ronald Greeley, Ph.D., Regents Prof. of Geology, Arizona State University,Dept. of Geological Sciences, Tempe, Arizona: \"My first reaction is that Ireally don't understand what these objects could be! I still don't understandthem. They are very dark and appear to really be out of context with thesurrounding terrain. Most of the surrounding terrain appears relatively smooth atthe resolution of the images and would appear to be made of soft sediments,easily eroded. And yet here are these very dark features that look like boulders,huge rocks, that are either perched on or emerging from this soft backgroundrock. And this just doesn't make sense geologically, and that's the thing we allfind so puzzling about it.IF I UNDERSTAND FROM THE SCALE THAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBEDAT THE PLANETARY SOCIETY AND MIKE MALIN'S SITE, THESEOBJECTS RANGE IN SIZE FROM ABOUT 50 TO 85 FEET, WHICH IS"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"HUGE.It's huge, indeed! Those would be quite large blocks or rocks.THE CONTRAST IS SO STARTLING. DO YOU OR OTHERGEOLOGISTS HAVE ANY SPECULATION AT THIS TIME ABOUTWHAT MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED?We really don't. One has to remember that the contrast on Mars is pretty lowand these pictures have been what we called stretched in the computer toincrease the contrast. So, while they appear very dark, it's sort of a relative thingcompared to the background. Nonetheless, they are dark, darker than mostfeatures that we see on Mars.IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT AN ASTEROID, FOR EXAMPLE,MIGHT HAVE CRASHED INTO MARS AND BROKEN UPPRODUCING ALL OF THESE DARK FRAGMENTS ON THESURFACE?That's a perfectly reasonable hypothesis. We know that many categories ofasteroids are dark, composed probably of material we call carbonaceouschondrites, for example. And this is carbon-rich, very dark in appearance, andthe distribution of the features that we see there on Mars- there is a prominentcluster with the largest fragment and if you go up to the upper left from thatprominent cluster, there is a whole string of smaller dark spots. So, thesuggestion that this could be something that smacked into this part of Mars andbroke up and left those boulders behind is entirely reasonable.COULD YOU EXPLAIN TO A GENERAL AUDIENCE WHERE THEDARK OBJECTS ARE ON MARS AND WHAT SURROUNDS THEM?This area is in the Northern Hemisphere of Mars that is close to the boundarybetween what we call the Cratered Highlands and the Northern Lowlands. Thefeatures close by are the Nilosyrtis Mensae - a series of fractures where thecrater terrain has been broken by faulting and then the whole of the region hasbeen eroded into the softened terrain we've seen in this image. (NilosyrtisMensae is quite a distance east of the famous Cydonia Mensae region containingthe controversial Face On Mars.)DOES THAT MEAN THAT THERE ARE, OR HAVE BEEN, A LOT OFEARTHQUAKES ON MARS?We see a lot of places on Mars that have been heavily fractured and this wouldindicate extensive earthquakes. We don't know if earthquakes are taking placetoday, or not. This is why on one of the future missions we hope to place anetwork of seismometers to monitor the earthquake activity. Today we just don'tknow.ARE THERE GOING TO BE MORE ROVERS THAT CAN GO TO APLACE LIKE THIS FOR A CLOSE-UP LOOK?Yes, there are plans to have Rovers in the future. In fact, the 2003 launchopportunity will carry two Rovers to Mars. This would not be an area of highpriority for exploration by Rovers in the current scheme of things, though. Morelikely what we would plan to do would be to image this first with the currentorbiter and then later with orbiters that will fly with higher resolution camerasof the sort that's being discussed for the 2005 opportunity.WHAT WOULD BE THE PRIORITIES FOR 2003 AND 2005 LANDERROVER MACHINES ON MARS?Currently the 2003 Rovers on Mars which will involve two Rovers going to twodifferent places on Mars has the priority to go to an area that shows goodevidence of water activity, past water activity. This is consistent with thescientific goals of looking for past and present life on Mars. It's also important tounderstand how the climate has changed on Mars. So, water is an importantconsideration in the current exploration program.DO YOU KNOW WHICH LATITUDE LONGITUDE THE NEXTROVER ON THE GROUND MIGHT BE GOING TO?The latitude is fairly constrained to a narrow band around the equator about 14degrees North to 14 degrees South. This is the result of the lander systems being"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"powered by solar energy and we need a lot of sun to do that. The equatorialregions receive more sun and this would allow us to have a longer mission. Sothat's one of the main considerations.HOW DO YOU DECIDE WHICH SPOT TO GO TO?The other engineering constraints deal with the landing system and the missionoperations. Currently, all Mars landers have to go to areas of lower elevationbecause they use as part of the landing system a parachute. Because the air onMars is so thin, we have to have a lot of atmosphere before it reaches thesurface. And of course, that would be in the lower elevations on Mars. So thelanding sites tend to be restricted below a certain elevation level. So, it's notonly the latitude that constrains the system, but also the elevation.Then in addition because of uncertainties in geography and space craft systems,we have to have what's called a landing footprint or landing ellipse of a certainminimum size because we don't know where we are going to set down withinthat uncertainty. And currently those landing ellipses are fairly large. Thatmeans we need to have large, smooth areas that would be relatively safe to landin.IN TERMS OF THAT LOWER ELEVATION, DO YOU MEAN LIKE ONEARTH THAT DEATH VALLEY WOULD BE AT A LOWERELEVATION THAN SAY DENVER, COLORADO?That's absolutely correct. There would be more air for the parachute to operatein as the system reaches the surface in Death Valley than it would in Denver.YOU NOW HAVE TOPOGRAPHIC MAPS THAT ARE PRETTYACCURATE ABOUT WHAT ELEVATIONS THERE ARE AND THAT'SHOW YOU DECIDE?That's correct. The current orbiter has a laser altimeter that has given us our firstreally good high quality topography for Mars and so this is what is being usedfor mission planning.\"More Information:The students were also allowed to pick their choice for a Earth future missionlanding site and that image will be taken when the MGS spacecraft orbit takes itover the target area some time in the next five months.A manned mission could perhaps settle the water debate once and for all, butthere won't be any manned missions to Mars for the foreseeable future. Therewill be more camera orbiters and remote-controlled land rovers. April 2001 - launch of Mars Odyssey that will carry a camera known as\"Themis.\" The Themis camera will be able to photograph in thirty differentfrequencies, including infrared. That mission will arrive in fall 2001 with acamera able to photograph in color and carrying a thermal channel soscientists will be able to derive properties of the surface from rocks that aretoo small to be seen in areas covered by dust and sand. The 2001 missionwill also have instruments that can measure the chemical composition ofthe Martian surface. Dr. Greeley hopes that a wider color image of theterrain surrounding the mysterious dark objects can be taken.2003 - Twenty-six months later, two land rovers will be sent to Mars thatwill be able to move at least 1000 meters from the landing site.2007 - Three years after that, a mission will launch to put aerial scoutballoons in the Martian atmosphere that will fly low and take photographswhile an intelligently programmed Lander and Rover will dig around inwhatever site was selected from the previous mission as possibly havingwater. Those machines will have the ability to drill down at least a meteror so and examine rock cores."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"2011, the goal is to put a smart Lander and Rover down that can dig anddrill in the most promising site for water and microbes and return the soilfor the first time back to Earth. If there is no evidence of water, somescientists say humans won't be able to put any base colony on the redplanet. If water is definitely found, then a future manned mission mighthead for Mars in about 25 years from now.We b s it e s :http://planetary.org/html/news/articlearchive/headlines/2001/marsmystery.htmlhttp://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/redrover_2_01/http://www-pdsimage.wr.usgs.gov/PDS/public/mapmaker/mapmkr.htmhttp://planetary.org/html/news/articlearchive/headlines/2001/marsmystery.htmlhttp://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/redrover_2_01/http://www-pdsimage.wr.usgs.gov/PDS/public/mapmaker/mapmkr.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
