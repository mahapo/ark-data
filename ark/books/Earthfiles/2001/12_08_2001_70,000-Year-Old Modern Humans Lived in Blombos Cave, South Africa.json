Photographs in color and black and whitebelow © 2001 by Christopher Henshilwood, Ph.D. December 8, 2001 - The New York Times had a headline this week in itsScience section entitled, \"African Artifacts Suggest an Earlier Modern Human.\"The subject is an archaeological dig in a cave known as Blombos, 200 miles eastof Cape Town. There, a team lead by Dr. Christopher Henshilwood, anarchaeologist, has found polished and refined bone tools; beautifully carvedstone points, some so thin that they seem more art than functional; and redochre scratched as if cut to make powder, probably for color in cave drawingsand perhaps body decorations. All three physical artifacts represent humanability to manufacture and to use symbols in art and communication, functionsbeyond lower primates. Yet, the dating of the layer in which all these artifactswere found together is 70,000 years ago. Dr. Henshilwood said, \"We'reabsolutely convinced of the dating of the tools,\" and The New York Timesdescribed the Blombos discoveries as \"turning long-held beliefs upside down.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The reason? In the 20th century, Europe's prehistory and Neanderthal past wereconsidered by many archaeologists and anthropologists to contain the missinglink between evolving primates and Cro-Magnon Homo sapiens sapiens. Butwhen that missing link remained illusive, more research in South Africa began arevolution in re-thinking the early beginnings of humans. New facts such as theevidence in Blombos Cave indicate that both the bodies and behaviors ofmodern humans came from southern Africa and might extend back at least100,000 years ago, pushing the old academic thinking way beyond the 30,000year mark.Until these new discoveries at Blombos Cave, which will be reported in theDecember issue of The Journal of Human Evolution, the oldest bone tools inAfrica had dated to only 25,000 years ago. Some scientists argue that humanlanguage and modern behavior did not appear until 50,000 years ago, and thendid so suddenly because of a genetic mutation in the brain.This week I talked with a scientist who examined the bone tools by optical lightmicroscope to see how they were made and what their uses might be. He is Dr.Richard G. Milo, Associate Professor of Anthropology and Archaeology atChicago State University in Chicago.Bone ToolsPolished bone points found in Blombos Cave, South Africa.Photograph © 2001 by Christopher Henshilwood, Ph.D.Richard G. Milo, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Anthropology andArchaeology, Chicago State University, Chicago, Illinois: \"The largestnumber of tools are what we would call awls, and they were probably used forpiercing something. If I had to guess, I would say piercing hides prior to sewinghides together into clothing. If you look at these tools which a typical one isabout 5 inches long, it's made on a piece of a small antelope's limb bone thatwas broken off either in the process of extracting the marrow from the bone orperhaps deliberately to make a blank for the tool. The makers then took a sharpstone flake and began to work the narrower end of this blank into a point.Examined microscopically it is sometimes possible to see how the fingers,particularly the thumb and fore finger of the user began to polish the surface ofthe bone."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"BY USING.By using it. And these polished areas tend to be rather close to the point, on theorder of 3/4 inch back from the point and that suggests that the tool was grippedbetween the thumb and forefinger with the butt end of the piece resting againstthe heel of the hand and the middle finger, ring finger and pinkie applyingpressure to the tool to keep it firmly pressed. In fact, there is very circumstantialevidence that most of them were being used by right handed people because ofthe way one's fingers match up with the polished and, in some cases, stainedareas where the grip was.HOW WOULD YOU COMPARE THESE AT THE BLOMBOS CAVE INTERMS OF SOPHISTICATION AND STYLE TO OTHER OLDARTIFACTS?They clearly were made in a deliberate way for a deliberate purpose, but if youcompare them to bone tools by later people, you probably would not put one ina Plexiglas box and put it on your mantle piece. However, the symmetrical,highly polished points would stand as fine examples of the bone workers' art, ifyou will, from any time and any place.Polished bone awls with finely sharpened points, probably used to punch holes,found in Blombos Cave, South Africa.

There are also stone points quiteremarkable and exceedingly beautiful, very carefully made, highly symmetrical,very thin and those are also present in considerable numbers in the middle stoneage layers at Blombos. Some of these points are so thin that the argument couldbe made that they weren't intended for going out and hunting an animal orsomething like that. They would have fractured almost immediately uponcontact with the animal's skin. So, then we have to ask: if these weren't made fora strictly utilitarian purpose, why were they made?And the answer that immediately suggests itself is that these points were made todemonstrate something that had to do with other than a simple point. Now, whatmight they have demonstrated. Well, it might have been intended as ademonstration of the skill of the maker, which itself is a kind of symbolic actlike, 'Look at this. I bet you can't make one this nice.'Red OchreScraped ochre from Blombos Cave, South Africa.Photograph © 2001 by Christopher Henshilwood, Ph.D.Besides the stone tools and bone tools, I must also mention one other extremelysignificant find from the site that bares on the question of behavioral modernityand that is a natural mineral pigment called red ochre. Ochre, and particularlyred ochre, have been used by people for many thousands of years as a pigment,whether they ground it to use for paintings on rock faces or for personaldecoration.LIKE TODAY'S COSMETICS, SO TO SPEAK?In a sense, but with reference to living people who use ochre, their use of thecolorant of the pigment has a more broadly social function than our owncontemporary use of cosmetics. For example, a shaman or somebody imbued orendowed with the group with some special or extraordinary power mightdecorate her or his body or face with ochre as part of a specific social activity,perhaps a healing ceremony or an attempt to contact the spirits of the ancestorsor something like that. Again, we confront the symbolic use of this."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Four different scraped ochre pieces from Blombos Cave, South Africa.Photographs © 2001 by Christopher Henshilwood, Ph.D.Symbolic ThinkingTHAT IS WHAT LEADS TO DR. HENSHILWOOD'S QUOTE TO THENEW YORK TIMES SAYING THAT THIS IMPLIED \"SYMBOLICTHINKING AND SYMBOLIC THINKING IMPLIES THAT PEOPLEARE USING SOMETHING TO MEAN SOMETHING ELSE. THETOOLS DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE ONLY A PRACTICAL PURPOSEAND THE OCHRE MIGHT BE USED TO DECORATE THEIREQUIPMENT AND PERHAPS THEMSELVES. THAT IS A SYMBOL OFSOMETHING ELSE THAT WE DO NOT UNDERSTAND, BUT ITSUGGESTS THESE PEOPLE MUST HAVE HAD ARTICULATESPEECH TO CONCEIVE AND TO COMMUNICATE SUCHSYMBOLISM.\"Yes, that is exactly right. One does not make a symbol in the absence of someway to share with other people what the symbol means. The production ofsymbols, whether it's done by a group working together or an individual, impliesa shared understanding of what the symbol means.THAT IS A PROFOUND SHIFT, I WOULD THINK, IN THE THINKINGOF ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND ANTHROPOLOGISTS IN PEOPLE70,000 YEARS AGO BEING ABLE TO ARTICULATE IN SYMBOLICLANGUAGE.It is not only a profound change in the thinking of archaeologists and paleo-anthropologists. It also represents one of, if not the, most profoundtransformations in the human lineage. It was that change that - well, to beginwith enabled modern humans to grow so rapidly that they populated most of theworld within the space of 30,000 years or so.NOBODY TO THIS DATE FULLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT CAUSEDTHAT EXPLOSION OF HUMANITY AT A MORE SOPHISTICATEDLEVEL?That's correct. That's correct. It is one of the most enticing mysteries that remainin the study and understanding of our own origins.WHICH IS WHAT IS IMPORTANT ABOUT THE SOUTH AFRICANSITE BECAUSE THERE YOU HAVE AT LEAST THREE MODERNDEMONSTRATIONS OF TAKING PRIDE IN SOME KIND OF WORKTHAT IS TOOLS AND USING SOMETHING THAT WENT ON THEBODIES OR WAS USED AS ART. AND ALL OF THAT WAS IN ONEPLACE AT 70,000 YEARS AGO."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"That's exactly right. And consequently, it substantially pre-dates what has oftenbeen referred to as the creative explosion...THAT MEANS YOUR THINKING ON THE CREATIVE EXPLOSIONMIGHT HAVE TO BE REVISED?That's right, and that's what makes these finds so - I hesitate to overuse the word,but revolutionary - because they give us our first concrete indication that in factmodern human had been developing for many thousands, or even tens ofthousands of years in an incremental kind of way. It's very likely that if we wereto encounter the people who lived and worked at Blombos 70,000 years ago, wewould recognize them as human just as we are.Whereas if we encountered the group, or type of human ancestors who wereliving in Europe at the same time that people generally refer to as Neanderthals,contrary to some claims, we probably would not recognize them as humans.THE NEANDERTHALS.The Neanderthals.BUT THAT THE SOUTH AFRICAN SPECIES MAY BE EVEN MORERECOGNIZABLE?That's right. And that leads to another element of why these finds at Blombosare so important. There has been a growing consensus - and I won't claim that itis universally accepted, even today. But a growing consensus that the ancestorsof all the human beings alive in the world today spring from just one group ofhuman ancestors.IF WE ALL CAME FROM ONE PLACE IN SOUTH AFRICA, HOWWOULD WE END UP WITH A VERY DIFFERENT NEANDERTHAL INEUROPE AND A MORE MODERN HOMO SAPIENS SAPIENSCREATURE IN SOUTH AFRICA?Ah, well, that is an excellent question. The Neanderthals were the descendantsof very early human ancestors that began to move into Europe perhaps as earlyas 800,000 years ago. they were the descendants of a very early group of ourancestors who on present evidence appeared somewhere in east Africa. Theseeast African pioneers, we might call them. And now we are going back a millionand more years ago. They slowly filtered out into the rest of the world, adaptingto different kinds of environments, perfecting forms of mutual cooperation thatare distinctive to human beings whether modern or ancestral as compared to saythe living apes. And by at least 300,000 years ago, it's perfectly clear that theNeanderthals were a European endemic species of human beings.THAT IS WHY THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN DONE ON DNACOMPARING NEANDERTHAL AND CRO-MAGNON HOMO SAPIENSSAPIENS HAS SUGGESTED THAT THERE WASN'T SEXUALINTERCOURSE BETWEEN THE TWO SPECIES.That is exactly right. Which is not necessarily to say that such intercourse wouldhave been impossible. But the differences between the two groups, differences inbehavior, differences in appearance, we might say differences in approach tomating might have combined so they didn't really recognize one or another asthe same kind of being and so they didn't recognize one another as potentialmates."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"ISN'T IT IRONIC THAT WE ARE AT 2001 AND JUST DISCOVERINGFOR THE FIRST TIME SPECIES IN SOUTH AFRICA THAT GO BACKTO 70,000 YEARS AGO, WHEN IN THE 20TH CENTURY OURGREATEST ATTENTION WAS LARGELY ON EUROPE ANDNEANDERTHAL AS BEING A PREDECESSOR?It is ironic. It's also to a certain extent kind of sad because we now mustrecognize that so many of the ideas we held really had to do with a differentquantity and quality of archaeological and fossil evidence from different places.I fully expect that as archaeological research continues in Africa, andparticularly in southern Africa, that we will find that elements of modernbehavior appear, even earlier than 70,000 years.DO YOU HAVE ANY SKELETAL REMAINS OR FRAGMENTS FROMTHE CAVE IN SOUTH AFRICA?Sadly, we do not. That is one of the principal focuses of ongoing research. Thereare a hand full of teeth and the teeth appear like the teeth of modern humans.But needless to say, it would be instructive to find more complete skeletalmaterial, if only to demonstrate that the people creating these remarkableartifacts were in a sense sending a message to us 70,000 years in the future thatthey were us and we are them. It would be nice to be able to demonstrate thatthey looked like us, too.IN THE BLOMBOS CAVE AREA, HAVE THERE BEEN ANYSKELETAL REMAINS FOUND IN THAT GENERAL GEOGRAPHICALREGION?Well, there are skeletal remains from Klasies River which is not too far awayfrom Blombos. Klasies is a bit older than Blombos and it is from that site thatskeletal remains have been recovered going back into the late 1960s that prettyconclusively show that the folks there were not so different from us.Unfortunately most of the skeletal remains from Klasies are rather broken up, aconsequently of having been beneath rock and soil and all sorts of other thingsfor 100,000 years. But there are enough of them to show us that we are dealingwith very early anatomically or morphologically modern people.\"http://naples.cc.sunysb.edu/CAS/cape.nsf/pages/westernCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
