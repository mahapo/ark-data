Our goal was to fly to Hanoi, Vietnam andVientiane, Laos and then travel by road to Savannakhet and Xepon, working ourway towards the Laos and Vietnam border and a remote village called Vilaburiwhere wild \"forest men and females\" with human faces and large, hairy bodieshave been reported.Watery rice fields between Xepon and Vilaburi.

That region of Laos had bombs and shells dropped on it 24 hours a day fornearly eleven years. He told me he had worked with the Australian Air Forceduring the war to load ammunition and explosives and was now back for thehigh pay to clear land for mining.Interview:Tom Roberts, Explosive Ordnance Demolition Technician, Xepon, Laos: \"Iwork for a company called Milsearch. It's an Australian company originally setup by some ex-Air Force weapons engineers. They came up to Laos and starteddoing some clearance with some mining companies and they ended up becominga joint venture company with the Laos Army. So, the name of the company uphere is Milsearch BP KP. It's basically a private organization. We haveinternational insurance which makes us very attractive. Most of the aid agencieswho want clearances done want international insurance in case something goesoff some time. And we're the only company in Laos that has a license to doUXO clearance.Bomb labeled \"USA\" under tree along the road from Xepon.Photograph © 2001 by Linda Moulton Howe."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Skull and crossbones \"poison\" symbol above USApainted on unexploded bomb in Xepon, Laos.Photograph © 2001 by Martin Geissmann.Bombee cases along the road from Xepon to Vilaburi.Photograph © 2001 by Linda Moulton Howe.Laotian village houses supported by bomb casings.

Photograph © 2001 by Linda MoultonHowe.AS WE DROVE ON THIS ROAD FROM XEPON TO VILABURI, WESAW BOMB CASINGS BEING USED TO SUPPORT HUTS AND SOMEOF THE OPEN CLAM SHELLS AND YOU HAVE THE SENSE THATTHERE ARE BOMBS ALL OVER THE PLACE ON EITHER SIDE OFTHE ROAD. WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT THOSE COULDSUDDENLY GO OFF IN THOSE VILLAGES?Every chance in the world.WHY NOT OVER 30 YEARS?Well, weapons when they are sort of sitting in the ground - you've got heat andcold and contraction. They move around in the ground. As they get older andolder and older, the explosive tends to deteriorate. Sooner or later, you get littlecracks. When you get cracks in explosives, you start to get crystallization and atany given moment, that crystallization might move and create a little spark thatsets off the detonation. It's purely that it can happen at any time. Or it could nothappen at all. They could lie there for 100 years and nothing would happen.But they might go off tomorrow. You just don't know.HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THIS?Last 10 to 11 months. Before that, it was before 1984.THE FIRST ROUND, WERE YOU IN THE MILITARY?Yes, I was in the Royal Australian Air Force.YOU HAD WORKED DURING THE VIETNAM WAR?Yeah, I was at a big American Air Force base half way between DaNang andSaigon.WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE?I was an armory fitter with a squadron of aircraft from Australia. My job was tolook after all the weapons equipment, fix that, and make bombs up and loadbombs on the aircraft."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"30 YEARS AGO, YOU WERE LOADING BOMBS INTO AIRCRAFTAND 30 YEARS LATER TODAY, YOU ARE DIGGING THEM UPHERE?Yeah, that's about it. I don't know if they are the same ones, but they look thesame.COULD YOU EXPLAIN NOW FOR A NORTH AMERICAN AUDIENCEEXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE DOING IN LAOS?Initially I am working at a big mining site that explored and found gold andcopper and a few other type minerals. And because there was so much UXObeing dropped here during the Vietnam war, everywhere you walk or want totake a vehicle, you have to clear it first. So, I have been basically clearing roadsand living areas and all that sort of thing of UXO.Tom Roberts, Explosive Ordnance Demolition Technician from Australia, sitting onshoulder of Route 9 in Xepon, Laos and telling us about the dangers of the road toVilaburi (Vilabouli) and the Ho Chi Minh trail. Photograph by Lam Sae.WE'RE SITTING RIGHT NOW IN A LITTLE GUEST HOUSE ON AROAD THAT IS ONLY ABOUT 30 FEET FROM WHERE WE ARE ANDTHIS ROAD GOES UP TO VILABURI WHERE WE HAVE SPENT THELAST COUPLE OF DAYS ON THE SEARCH FOR THIS FOREST MAN.CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE CONDITION OF THISROAD WE HAVE BEEN GOING UP AND DOWN AND HOW MUCHMILITARY BOMBS, SHRAPNEL, EVERYTHING MIGHT STILL BE INTHAT ROAD?Well, there's probably a lot. Laos was bombed for almost eleven years, 24 hoursa day, or just about that. And they dropped a lot of bombs on all the tracks. Thisarea was originally the Ho Chi Minh Trail. In fact, it's not just a trail. It's about40 or 50 kilometers wide and comprises rivers, tracks, roads. All these trackswhen vehicles are on them when they are bombed, they left big bomb craters.So, when the aircraft went away and at night time, all the local people came outand filled in the holes up with whatever was there which might have been truckbodies, ordnance, anything, bombs, and just put them in the holes and filledthem over to make the road again so they could get their trucks moving and getmore supplies moving.WHAT IS THE CURRENT SITUATION ON SOME OF THESE BOMBSAND THINGS BLOWING UP NOW?Well, you never really know. Bombs can last for a long time in the ground orjust laying there. You can hit it with a hammer or give it a good kick and nothingwould happen, move it around and it would be fine. But you might sneeze atone and it could go off. You never know.WHAT'S THE MOST RECENT ONE THAT HAS GONE OFF HERE?We had one go off last October. It was right in the middle of the road. It was adeep bomb. I'm not sure what size it was. It must have been 750 pounds orbigger because it was a very deep hole and very big crater. But it was right in themiddle of the road and closed the road for three months."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THAT'S VERY CLOSE TO WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW?Yeah, that's about 12 kilometers away.HOW HAVE WE BEEN GOING NINE HOURS UP TO VILBURI ANDNINE HOURS BACK IN THAT SOVIET TRUCK - HOW HAVE WEDONE THAT AND OTHER PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FORTHE LAST THIRTY YEARS WITHOUT ALL OF THESE BOMBS ANDMATERIALS BLOWING OFF BEFORE NOW?I don't really know. It's just one of those things. They sit there until they decideto do it. With explosives, anything can happen. You cannot predict it at all.WE ARE IN A DANGEROUS TERRITORY STILL IN THE HO CHIMINH TRAIL AREA?Yeah, basically if you walk off the beaten tracks or get off the main roads andstart wandering through the bush by yourself, you are in dangerous territory.You can step on something that could go off.YOU'VE BEEN UP TRYING TO SURVEY WITH MAGNETOMETERSHOW MUCH METAL IS UNDER THE ROADS AND ALONG THESHOULDERS TRYING TO CLEAR IT FOR THE MININGOPERATION. COULD YOU EXPLAIN A SUMMARY OF WHAT YOUHAVE FOUND SO FAR?We've found all sorts of stuff. We've found big bombs, 500 pounders, 750pounders. Mainly small munitions like blues which are called \"little bombees\"that are like little baseball things that are armed and when they hit the ground,they go off. Anti-personnel weapons. We find mortars, rusty boxes ofanti-aircraft rounds, anti-aircraft rounds from about 12.7 up to about 5 or 6 inchwhole rounds or parts of rounds, parts of rockets and rocket heads, mortars, allsorts of mortars. Basically, anything that is Russian, North Vietnamese, French,American, and there's pieces of other stuff around, too.ONCE YOU HAVE USED THE MAGNETOMETER AND YOU FINDTHIS MATERIAL YOU WANT TO CLEAR, HOW DO YOU DO IT?Well, basically we go out to an area and we have a team of local Lao nationalmen and we have surface detectors that go down about 5 or 6 inches and wesearch the whole ground with that to pick up anything metal. In fact, they pickup copper, stainless steel, brass and other stuff. We'll pick up a lot of the thingslike little bombees and maybe bullets and small arms and all that sort of stuffthat is quite shallow. Once that's clear, we then go through with themagnetometer that goes down to about 3 meters depending upon what theground is like. If we get a hit, we start digging using the magnetometer and wealso use the metal detectors as we go down. And when we start getting a goodsound out of the metal detector, we know we are getting within about a foot orso of whatever it is and then we usually use that to go down and dig around andfind out what it is. With a magnetometer, say you've got a bomb, depending howit's lying - you can usually tell that it's something big and you can usuallypinpoint the ends of it if it's lying flat to the surface.Sometimes, they are inclined to the surface or straight up and down whichmakes it really hard. So, most of the time when you're digging you don't knowwhat you've actually got until you hit something, expose a bit of it. Then yourealize what it is and then you can sort of get on with it.BUT HOW DO YOU GET THEM OUT WITHOUT THEMEXPLODING?Most of the bombs - when we sort of look at them, we have a look at the fusesystem on them. Sometimes you can tell that they have been dropped safe. Itmight still have an arming wire on it. When bombs are dropped safe or jettisonedoff aircraft, the arming wire goes with the bomb. Sometimes, there is an armingwire there. Or sometimes, there are other indications that it's safe. If the fuses areall knocked off, we look at what type of bomb it is and try to decide what fuse itmight have been and then we work out what that fuse will do if the fuse couldstill work. Like, if it's a tail fuse - if the bomb hits head first, the tail fuse will go"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"bang that way. If the bomb hits the other way, tail first, the tail fuse won't workbecause the detonator is going the wrong way to get into the fuse. So, if we pickthat up and carry it a certain way and then drop it on its nose, there is a prettygood chance that it will be OK. So, we take it away.If we find a weapon that we can't determine what condition it is - we play safe100% of the time and blow it up on site.YOU JUST BLOW IT UP RIGHT THERE?That's right.IN THE SURVEY YOU HAVE DONE SO FAR ON THESE ROADS,WHAT IS YOUR ESTIMATION OF HOW MANY BOMBS ARE STILLWITHIN THE UPPER 10 TO 15 FEET OF THE LAND AROUNDHERE?I wouldn't have a clue! But a lot! If we talk about Route 9 right across Laos,there is probably hundreds. But you just don't know. A survey we do is only asample survey. In between, you might pick up a bomb on your sample andanother 500 meters down, you might pick up another one. But there might benone in between or there might be ten bombs. You just don't know until youactually go over the whole ground.COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT A BOMBEE IS AND HOW MANY YOUHAVE FOUND SO FAR?Bombee is sort of a French word that Laotians use for \"Blue 26's.\" There areusually 200 to 270 that come in a cluster bomb unit (CBU) - the container islike two big clam shells. When it comes off the aircraft, the clam shells areblown apart and all these little bomblets are thrown through the air in a greatbig pattern onto the ground. They air arm and when they hit the ground, theyare supposed to go off - except some of them are designed to go off maybe anhour later or maybe a couple of hours later. And on top of that, there is a veryhigh failure rate, probably up to about 20% of all the ones that were everdropped. So, there is still a helluva a lot of it lying around the place in the areasthat they bombed. In about 9 months, we have found about 1,000 plus in about46 hectares that were cleared.WHAT WAS THE CONDITION OF THESE BOMBEES?They could be in any condition. Some had rotted to pieces in the ground andyou just pick them up and they fall to pieces. Others were just sort of sitting halfin the ground and half open. They tend to open because there is a little metalring that holds the clamshells together on the little ones. Sometimes we findthem sitting on top of the ground with brand new paint and all their markings asif they were made in the factory the next day and someone just placed it there.IF A KID COMES ALONG AND PICKS IT UP TO PLAY WITH IT LIKEA BALL, WHAT HAPPENS?Oh, it's a bit dangerous. It will go off. Sure as hell.CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT THE INCIDENT THAT OCCURRED NOTTOO LONG AGO?There were a couple of kids that picked up one of these bombees and they wereplaying catch. And when one of them caught it, it went off and killed that kidand severely damaged the other little one.IN A WAY, THE WAR IS STILL GOING ON ALMOST LIKE A GHOSTECHO OF 30 YEARS AGO?Oh, yeah. It never stops here. Around all the villages, there is ordnanceeverywhere. Out in the rice fields even. What they usually do is gingerly pick itup and put it to one side, but they are all there. We found ordnance in old ricefields that haven't been used for two or three years. We dig down about 6 inchesand there we find UXO.LAST NIGHT YOU SAID YOU COULD WORK HERE FOR 100 YEARSAND YOU WOULDN'T CLEAR EVERYTHING."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"That's about right.
