Red Deer is south of Edmonton. The farmer,73-year-old Ken Bickford, became aware of the pattern as his combine moved next to alarge central circle. Later Mr. Bickford told a newspaper reporter that in 60 years offarming he has “never seen anything remotely like it.” The ripe spring wheat had beenflattened in a hexagram pattern of two overlapping triangles. Each triangle point had acircle at the tip and a large, seventh circle at the center of the hexagram measured 100 feetin diameter. The whole hexagram at its longest measured 422 feet in diameter. KenBickford looked for evidence of shoe tracks or other evidence, but could not find any.Reported by farmer Ken Bickford on September 16, 2001 after he discovered the hexagramin his Red Deer, Alberta wheat field from his combine harvester. The swath on the leftwas his first drive through. After that, Mr. Bickford drove around the formation to preserve it.Formation was 422 feet in diameter, Canada's largest so far. After news about it broke, a pilotacknowledged he first saw it from the air on September 2, but did not report it.Aerial photograph © 2001 by Lyle Ford, CCCRN.

And no one else had reportedthe huge hexagram formation. But finally after several news stories after September 16, apilot told Paul Anderson, Director of the Canadian Crop Circle Research Network, that hesaw the hexagram formation from his airplane on September 2, but didn't report it. So, thatmust be the first day of its creation since the farmer is definite nothing was there on Sept.1st. Solid Peach-Orange Glowing Triangular CraftA couple of nights after that, nurse's aide, Linda Fraser, and her colleague, Penny Pickett,were taking cigarette breaks outside the Lacombe Nursing Home where they work.Lacombe is near Red Deer. At 3:15 a.m., they both noticed three large triangular objectsmoving rapidly across the sky. Each triangle glowed a solid color like the inside of a peachor cantaloupe, were as large as a fist raised at arm's length distance, were completely silent,crossed the sky in a few seconds and were gone. Then two hours later at 5:15 a.m. duringanother break, the women were stunned to see six triangle-shaped objects fly over. PennyPickett said, \"Look, there they are! Only they started coming and there were six of them.And they weren't in the perfect little triangle (formation) the first time. The first three werein a triangle. But the second three were not in a line, but kind of like a triangle sidewaysbehind them.\"A week after that was the horror in New York City, Washington, D. C. and Pennsylvaniaon September 11. The skies over Canada and the United States were quiet as all aircraftwere grounded for four days, except for authorized military traffic. But on Saturday,September 15, Penny Pickett was taking a cigarette break with another nurse's aide, JudyMilne, at the Lacombe Nursing Home when they both watched seven, solid orangetriangles for over a minute change formations in the night sky. Judy Milne told me she wasnot certain how high the triangular craft were, but that each was at least as big as the palmof her hand extended at arm's length.Interviews:Judy Milne, Nurse's Aide, Lacombe Nursing Home, Lacombe, Alberta Canada: \"Wehad just stepped out. I was just lighting my cigarette and Penny said, 'Look!' They werecoming from the northwest and they were coming at a distance. They were very clear.How many were you seeing at that point?Seven.Seven orange, glowing triangles moving in formation fromnorthw est to southeast over Lacombe, Al berta, Canada nursi ng home.Six triangles formed the perimeter around a seventh inside the circleas shown in the above drawing by Judy Milne.Were they all clearly triangle-shaped at that point?All triangular. And first of all, it was almost like they started out in a star formation, likeway back. When we first saw them, they were in a group. Then they angled out, almost likein an arrow shape. There were two and then two more at the head of the arrow and thenthree came down the rod of the arrow. And they held that formation for, I don't know, Iwould say half a minute."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Then as they kind of arched and broke the formation they went in almost a half moon. Buteach triangle was completely orange on the bottom. There were no distinct lights of anysort. Each was just one mass of orange, the whole triangle.So you were seeing seven peach-colored triangles moving in the sky?Ye s .Not really like the way we would think of airplanes having lights at the corners ortips?No. There weren't little flashing lights, or going around it or anything. The whole bottom,I'm assuming it was the bottom, was a mass of peach.Airplanes in the sky make some sound. Did you hear any sound?No, absolutely no sound.These orange triangles were either big enough or low enough for you to say eachwould take one of your palms to cover one?Yeah. If I extend my hand, it would fit, a triangle would go in the palm of my hand.So it would take seven different palms to make the size of the formation in the sky thatyou and Penny were seeing?Ye s .That's pretty big.Yes, they were massive!You all watched them for at least a minute or so?Yeah, and how come it wasn't detected? (After the terrorist attacks,) all systems shouldhave been alerted to watch the skies and yet it had never been picked up. And there is justno explanation, none.No one in a military or defense position or government authority has tried to get intouch with you to ask about the orange triangles?Nope. Nobody has called.\" Government Knowledge and Cover-Up?Perhaps the Canadian and U. S. governments already have some secret inside informationabout large triangular craft. In my book Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume II: HighStrangeness (see Earthfiles.com Bookstore), I reprinted an alleged top secret documententitled: “Restricted SOM1-01 Majestic-12 Group Special Operations Manual:Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery and Disposal” dated April 1954 by theWar Department."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"In the SOM1-01 manual printed in my book, a section is labeled: Description of Craft. Itstates: “Documented extraterrestrial craft (UFOBs) are classified in one of four categoriesbased on general shape as follows:a) Elliptical or disc shape.b) Fuselage or cigar shape.c) Ovoid or circular shape.d) Airfoil or triangular shape.”From SOM1-01 Operations Manual for“Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery and Disposal.”Bottom text says: “Note: Illustrations in this diagram are gathered fromdocumented sightings in Air Force and Central Intelligence and from examinationof wreckage collected from various sources years 1947-1953 inclusive.”“This craft is believed to be new technology due to the rarity and (sic) recency of the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"observations. Radar indicates an isoceles triangle profile, the longest side being nearly 300feet in length. Little is known about the performance of these craft due to the rarity of goodsightings, but they are believed capable of high speeds and abrupt maneuvers similar to orexceeding the performance attributed to discs.”Is there a connection between the triangular craft and the huge hexagram near Red Deer,Alberta, Canada that emerged nine days before the catastrophes in New York andWashington? Several times over the past decade, large triangles have been seen over Britishfields around the time of major crop formations. In my book, I have photographs of severalspectacular formations and I asked these questions:“Could the crop formations be a warning, a mysterious language inmathematical code from an advanced intelligence which can see the futurefrom a timeless place, understands the repetitive patterns of our space-time,and knows mankind is at a dangerous, self-destructive moment on theevolutionary spiral? Could that intelligence be trying to get our attention in thecereal crops of the world to warn that food and life are not guaranteed if wecontinue industrial-technological-military development that destroys so muchof our planet's green oxygen-producing life? Are we altering our atmosphere somuch that one day we might not be able to breathe?”And in September 2001, we might ask: are we now setting foot on a war path headedtoward unpredictable bio-chemical contaminations and nuclear detonations? The Role of the Hexagram in HistoryThe hexagram of two overlapping triangles known in the modern world as the “Star ofDavid” has long been associated with the Jewish faith. However, the symbol's source isprobably Arabic. Hebrew scholars such as Gershom Scholem, who intensely studied theKabbalah early in the 20th century, concluded that “the hexagram is not a Jewish symbol.It goes back to pre-Islamic Jewish magic” where it “had one and only one purpose in itscareer as magic: to serve as protection against demons.”Further, Lenora Leet says in her 1999 book, The Secret Doctrine of the Kabbalah,Recovering the Key to Hebraic Sacred Science, “It has long been thought that thehexagram was from Arabic alchemy, (but it was) the West (which) most popularized thissymbol of equilibrium between the opposed spiritual forces of fire (expansive forcerepresented by the upward-pointing triangle) and water (the contractive force representedby the downward-pointing triangle). Since it was only in the early Middle Ages that thehexagram began to be featured prominently in Jewish magical texts and amulets, mostmodern historians have concluded that it was probably through the Arabic source that thehexagram was most directly transmitted to the medieval Spanish Kabbalists.”Anci ent Seal of Sol omon, a six-poi nted starformed by extending each of the sides of a regular hexagoninto equilateral woven triangles, likely of Arabic origin.Alpha and Omega are top and bottom points;Tau is centered w ithin the six-sided interior hexagon.Draw ing from Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles© 2001 by Linda Moulton Howe."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Stonehenge ground plan of large sarsen stones drawnwith superimposed hexagram. From New Light on the Mysteryof Glastonbury, © 1990 by John Michell.The hexagram is even implicit in the ground plan of Stonehenge. Ancient science andreligion researcher and author John Michell wrote about the squared circle around ahexagram in Stonehenge's 6,000-year-old ground plan in his 1990 book, New Light on theMystery of Glastonbury. Michell wrote, “The square, drawn with its perimeter equal inlength to the mean circumference of the outer sarsen circle, contains the circle of'bluestones.' Within this (implied), a six-pointed star contains a circle of the same width asthe inner bluestone formation.”More Information:The Red Deer, Alberta, Canada hexagram formation is reminiscent of the May 3, 1997,Kabbalistic Tree of Life discovered near Barbury Castle in the same field that a menorahand horned concentric rings was found on May 31, 1999.
