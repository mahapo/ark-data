C. - The United States now has one hundredfifteen million cell phone subscribers. In only three more years, global use ofcell phones is estimated to reach 2.1 billion . Yet, no one can guarantee theirsafety.Cellular phones use microwaves to transmit conversations and those microwavefrequencies are emitted by microwave antenna towers. Even if the phonesoperate in microwave frequencies that are lower than microwave ovens, cellusers still report burning on ears, cheeks and hands. Many think that theincrease in brain tumors in the past fifteen years is also linked to people cradlingcell phones between their shoulder and ear. The strongest radiation is emittednear a cell phone's antenna.Microwave News in New York reports that, \"In the United States, attorneys inseveral states have filed lawsuits alleging that cellular phone companies have nottaken adequate steps to protect people from possible radiation hazards.\"Given the intense public concern and scientific confusion about the safety levelsof radio and microwave frequency exposures, last year U. S. Senator JoeLieberman of Connecticut and Representative Ed Markey of Massachusettsasked the Government Accounting Office to review cell phone health researchand regulations. On May 22, the GAO released a report that said, \"it will likelybe many more years before a definitive conclusion can be reached on whethermobile phone emissions pose any risk to human health.\" The report also saidthat the Federal Communications Commission should standardize the testingprocess that determines whether cell phones comply with federal radiationlimits. The GAO also advised that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)report to the public what is learned in current research funded by the CellularTelecommunications and Internet Association.Sen. Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Rep. Markey (D-Mass.) recommended that theFCC and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) set up a website and call centerto make it easier for consumers to look up the radiation level of particular cellphone models. The lawmakers also suggested that people use headsets, keep thephones away from their bodies and make shorter calls to reduce microwaveexposure.Cell phone use by people driving cars has also been blamed for several fatalaccidents the past year. This week also, Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.),sponsored the first federal legislation that would require drivers to wear ahandsfree earpiece or use a speaker phone.Now California's Council on Wireless Technology Impacts (CWTI) is supportingthe National Toxicology Program's efforts to have radio frequency radiationdeclared a toxin. Yesterday I talked with the Council's Executive Director aboutthe GAO report and their human health concerns."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Interview:Libby Kelley, Executive Director, Council on Wireless TechnologyImpacts, Novato, California:\"We just learned that the National Toxicology Program which is at the NationalInstitute of Environmental Health Services (NIEHS) is now undertaking someanimal studies that have been requited in order to complete the body ofevidence needed for the National Toxicology Program to review radio frequencyradiation as an environmental toxin. This is extremely important and NIEHS hasjust received $10 million to go ahead and do this research. All these pieces haveto come together.But I believe the GAO is basically reporting the status quo. One concern I haveis that when they reviewed the epidemiology studies that have been produced inthe last several months out of Denmark and two of them in the Journal of theAmerican Medical Association and the International Journal of Oncology, theyseemed to emphasize the studies which many scientists believe are minimizingthe cell phone user link to cancers by using study samples of groups of peoplewho prior to 1986 were early adapters, but used cell phones only one to twohours a day or less. Not at all the type of use you see today. These peopledeveloped tumors, but there weren't that many of them and so the link is notvery strong.OF RESEARCHERS YOU HAVE TALKED TO, WHAT ARE THEIRGREATEST CONCERNS ABOUT THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMICMOVE TO PUSH THE RESIDENTIAL PERSON AND THE BUSINESSTO WIRELESS MACHINES THAT ARE GOING TO FUNCTION WITHMICROWAVES?That's a big question. I think on the international front, we are starting to see theindustry blink. I was invited to speak at a Fortune 500 international conferencefor journalists on public health points of view about the technology. There is aconference being planned for the fall in the United Kingdom which basicallywill do the same thing: training the telecom corporations about how to deal withperception of risk and opposition by community members, recognizing now thatthere are many environmental concerns out there that they are going to have toovercome.I think in 1994 when the GAO did their last report on cell phones and asked formore research, there were only about 16 million cell phone users then. Theywere using analog phones and not very often. Now here we are. It's 2001 with110 million cell phone users and growing every day. Globally, we're going to beinto 2.1 billion cell phone users by 2005. And yet, we still don't know whetherthere is a risk?! And we're still only working on anecdotal information about theaffects on peoples' health?!Well, that's why many schools and parents - especially parents - are involved atthe school level to ward off siting of cellular antennas on school buildings andto keep wireless internet out of the classroom. They don't want their children tobe a guinea pig.COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT ISSUE IN LIGHT OF THIS CHERRYCREEK SCHOOL DISTRICT BATTLE WITH SPRINT IN ARAPAHOECOUNTY, COLORADO?Yes, I've been involved in that. This is a fairly typical story of what parents needto go through in order to protect their children. Sprint came and signed acontract and the antennas went up during the summertime and the parents foundout. It was up and was a done deal. And they started investigating. They got onthe internet and started using the phone and e-mail like so many people do nowto find out what they could find out that was credible. And what they learned isthat the science is not certain., There is a high level of concern by independentparties and the industry's response is not very reassuring."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"So, they started a large public relations campaign. They formed committees.They set up a website. They have recommended that people boycott Sprint.They sent letters to Sprint. They held public hearings and had press conferences.And they got the school to recognize that the school, at a minimum, had a hugepublic relations problem with dozens of parents threatening to remove theirchildren from that school. So in the interest of keeping peace, the school hasjoined with the parents in requesting that Sprint now remove those antennas.Sprint has come back a few days later and said, 'No.' They do not intend toremove the antennas. And I was speaking with one of the parents this morningand asked her how it was going. She told me that they are waiting for the 30 daynotification period to be up and Sprint has advised them that if they removethose antennas, there will be a ripple affect elsewhere which is absolutely true.In fact, the ripple has come to them because this has been going on elsewhere inthe country where cell phone carriers have been asked to remove antennas orcease construction and the schools are actively working with parents to protectchildren.So, basically right now, they are in a waiting mode. The Cherry Creek parentsand the school realize that Sprint may not remove those antennas and they willthen be going into court.And this is happening in England and in Australia and other parts of the world.There is an enormous undercurrent of communications where people are tryingto help each other learn about and address this issue with a rapid deployment ofwireless technologies coming straight at them where they live which is invadingtheir privacy.WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE TO LISTENERS WHO ARECONCERNED ABOUT CELL TOWERS AND CELL PHONES INTHEIR AREA?I would advise them to phone the EMR website and read the information on thatsite. The address is http://www.emrnetwork.org. That site has credible scientificinformation that was provided to the EMR network. And I am a foundingdirector of the EMR network. We have sought to put together information that iscredible, that can be justified and supported. And we are also working onfederal public policy changes in the United States with the VermontCongressional delegation. I think that people need to realize that they have toget into this and stay with it - not just their own tower, but learn all they can,educate others, evaluate their local wireless siting ordinance. If necessary, callfor a moratorium to help their city leaders understand the health issues and notput them in a position where they are going to be sued but so that they canrewrite an ordinance just to be more protective just in case.IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS OF ALL THE RESEARCH YOU TRY TOKEEP TRACK OF, WHAT DO YOU THINK PERSONALLY IS THESINGLE MOST DRAMATIC CASE OF A HUMAN THAT IS SICK ANDLINKS DIRECTLY TO USING A CELL PHONE OR BEING EXPOSEDTO A NEARBY MICROWAVE TOWER?One of the individuals I got to know as we made out film: Public Exposure,DNA, Democracy and the Wireless Revolution - which by the way, you canorder through the EMR Network website. There is information on how to orderthat film from the Council On Wireless Technology Impacts. In the film, weinterviewed a gentleman who worked for a start up mobile phone company whowere developing a prototype of cell phone that had internet access capability.And it was pretty high powered. And this gentleman who lived in SouthernCalifornia started experiencing some symptoms fairly early on. He was using thiswireless device constantly. He was asked to use it as part of his job. Suddenly,he developed a tumor and it was a rapidly growing tumor. He was operated on 4times and he is now recovering at home, seeking workman's compensation for hisdiagnosis."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"WAS THE TUMOR EXACTLY WHERE THE CONTACT OF THEWIRELESS MACHINE WAS ON HIS BODY? WHERE WAS THETUMOR?The tumor was exactly where the antenna was and he held his cell phone by hishead in precisely that manner. And this will be born out by the medicaloncology tests which were done on his brain that shows the outline of theantenna. He talks about this in the film.IT WAS A BRAIN TUMOR THEN?It was a brain tumor, yes.And it's hard to know where to go to be away from this infrastructure because ittends to be everywhere we are so we can all be artificially connected in thiselectronic world.WHICH MAY BE DESTRUCTIVE IN THE LONG RUN?That is what Dr. Robert Becker says. He believes that electromagnetic radiationposes a greater health risk than global warming.\"More Information:The Food and Drug Administration has budgeted $10 million to try toscientifically prove if cell phones do, or do not, cause cancer in humans. TheNational Toxicology Program in North Carolina will expose rats to differentdoses of radiation, including levels emitted by cell phones. This study will bethe most comprehensive animal toxicology ever performed on effects from cellphone microwave emissions and is expected to take five years to get reliableresults.We b s it e s :http://www.emrnetwork.org/http://www.franklaumen.de/Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
