Dr. vanLommel has been a cardiologist for twenty-five years. He and his colleaguesbegan their article with this statement: \"Some people report a near-deathexperience known as an NDE after a life-threatening crisis. We aimed toestablish the cause of this experience and assess factors that affected itsfrequency, depth and content.\"For twelve years Dr. von Lommel and his team studied 344 patients who hadcardiac arrests and were successfully resuscitated in ten Dutch hospitals. Ofthose 344, eighteen percent reported a near-death experience. The researchersconcluded: \"Occurrence of the experience was not associated with duration ofcardiac arrest or unconsciousness, medication or fear of death before cardiacarrest,\" they wrote. Significantly more patients who had an NDE, especially adeep experience, died within 30 days of CPR, perhaps because those peoplewere not afraid to let go of life after their near-death experiences.Further, in a surprisingly firm conclusion, the doctors concluded: \"Our resultsshow that medical factors cannot account for occurrence of NDE; although allpatients had been clinically dead, most did not have NDE. Furthermore,seriousness of the crisis was not related to occurrence or depth of theexperience. If purely physiological factors resulting from cerebral anoxia causedNDE, most of our patients should have had this experience. Patients' medicationwas also unrelated to frequency of NDE.\"One of the most extraordinary cases studied was a 43-year-old man who hadcardiac arrest on a street. Dr. van Lommel explains what happened.Interview:Pim van Lommel, M. D., Cardiologist, Division of Cardiology, HospitalRijnstate, Arnhem, Netherlands: \"It was a 43-year-old man who had anout-of-hospital (cardiac) arrest and so when he was admitted to the hospital,they had been doing CPR for more than half an hour. So he was deeplyunconscious and cyanotic when he was admitted to the hospital. He was in verybad shape. He had no blood pressure, no heartbeat, and so they were performingCPR. And after 1.5 hours in the hospital at last he had blood pressure and heartbeat, but there was brain damage. So, there was no spontaneous respiration."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"So they had to intubate him and when the nurse intubated him, he had toremove the dental prosthesis and put it on the crash car. The patient had to beon artificial respiration for more than one week in ICU and then he came back tothe cardiac ward. The first time the nurse entered his room to give himmedication, the patient recognized the nurse and said, 'Oh, you was the one whowas there when I was admitted in the hospital and you took out my dentures, thedental prosthesis, to intubate me.'He could describe exactly what doctors were there, how they looked like, whatthe room looked like. And the nurse was so upset because he had never heard ofan NDE before. So, he rang us. We explained to him and we asked him to writedown everything that had happened.What is doing the perceiving since it is not a conscious brain, eye and earsystem?Exactly, exactly. That means when there is no activity in the brain, let's say a flatEEG, and people can still have their full consciousness with cognition, emotion,with memories from their youth, all for the possibility of perceiving. That meansthere must be something that can be received by your brain, so it is somethingoutside your body that you can receive in your body by your brain.Do you think that is indirect proof of a soul-spirit?No, I never use the word because everybody has their own ideas about it. So Inever use the word mind, soul or spirit because I think it's very hard to knowwhat someone else means. So I talk about consciousness and memories andself-identity.What you are saying is that the concept of soul and spirit becomes politicalbecause of different religious interpretations of them?Exactly. Exactly. Everybody has his own ideas and no one knows what anyoneelse thinks about it.Yet, something is perceiving the details of a room, people and those falseteeth. What is doing the perceiving?It is your consciousness with your identity and with your memories. And youcan give it a name, but I won't. You can call it mind or soul, but I won't becausesomebody else thinks perhaps something different.What you are saying is that your bottom line from doing this research isthat you have at least reported in 18% of the cases of the 344 cardiacpatients that you studied have some kind of recollection of somethinghappening after they were clinically dead for a few minutes?There have always been theories about NDE reports - that they are just aphysiological reaction of anoxia of the brain, lack of oxygen. Or it was somechemical reaction of endomorphines or it is a psychological reaction to death, orit is medication. So, what we did in this first prospective study was to look ifthere could be any explanation of having NDE. We looked at two groups ofpatients: 18% who did report some form of memory and 82% who didn't. Thereis no difference in medical, psychological, physiological or pharmacologicalthings. They are all the same.So, you tried to control for the conventional biological and chemicalexplanations that have been made. But then it seems you are left withanother question: Why did only 18% of the 344 patients report anear-death experience?Exactly. I don't know. But the only thing we can know is that when it should bea physiological reaction due to a lack of oxygen to the brain, then when youhave cardiac arrest, you have no blood pressure. There is no oxygen going to thebrain. You lose your consciousness. And your breathing stops. And yourreflexes stop. And everything stops. And then you have an 80% of people in thissituation who have full consciousness. So that is a mystery.Another part of your study was that after two years there seemed to be atransformation in the 18% who had the NDE memories. There was a"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"transformation in their relationship to their life and other people and theworld around them. After eight years, if I read your data correctly, theNDE experiencer described an even more increased transformation ofthought and appreciation of life without fear of death?Yes, one of the things is when you have a transformational change of people,you don't know if it's whether they've had a cardiac arrest or if it is because theyhave an NDE. So, what we did was do taped interviews lasting up to three hoursafter two years of all the survivors and eight years later, we had a matchedcontrol group of patients who had cardiac arrest as well without an NDE. Thetransformation, change in people who had the NDE is much more impressivecompared to other who did not have the NDE experience and the main thing isthat their life inside changes and their fear of death disappears.When you talk with that group, do you get any insights from them aboutwhy they themselves feel that some sort of philosophical, spiritualtransformation continues to increase eight years after an NDE?It's a process that they cannot talk about it. They are neglected or laughed at bydoctors, nurses and family. And what I saw is a society negative response to anNDE which leaves individuals to deny or suppress their experience for fear ofrejection or ridicule. So they cannot talk about it unless they trust somebody orfind someone who was open. Then they can talk about it and the integrationstarts of the change inside of losing the fear of death and what is important inlife, especially those people who have had a panoramic life review.In those panoramic life reviews, what has impressed you most?Well, that all thoughts and words and deeds have been kept somewhere and thatyou again feel what happened when you get something or saw something andyou feel the emotion of the other person who is involved. So you feel theemotions of somebody else, whether you gave love or just neglected him as well.You feel that as well and it gives you insight into what you did and what was theemotional impact on somebody else.Civilization the last five thousand years has had many past and currentreligions that say at the moment of death there is a transition ofconsciousness to God or Allah and a heaven. Why then would anyonedescribing a near-death experience be treated with ridicule or disbelief?Because they are trying to explain something, their experience, there are nowords for and they are talking about meeting diseased relatives, they are talkingabout celestial landscapes, they are talking about a being of light. And a lot ofpeople don't want to hear it.They don't want to hear it?They say, 'It's impossible! You have had a hallucination or it was the effect ofmedication or calm down.' So they cannot express what they want to about theirexperience because they cannot talk about it.What you are saying is that the western world has some how changed in itsperceptions so that a moment of death experience, as described in your18% population, has suddenly for some reason been relegated by society assomething that is politically not acceptable?Yes, and also by churches. Also in Holland there are churches that are veryconservative. And the people never dare to talk about it. They would not bewelcome any more in the church.But you can see why this is not only ironic, but contradictory if the churchtalks about praying and going to heaven upon death. Why would there beany ridicule of people who describe exactly such a process?Because for them, it is not a matter of belief. It is a matter of knowing.The NDE experiencer?Yes. They said dead, to our surprise, is not dead. I was there, still. People whogo to church say, 'You cannot say that.'But isn't that why people are in church to survive death and go to heaven?I think perhaps to believe, but not to know. I know. If you ever talk with people"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"with an NDE, whenever you talk to them - also I know psychologist Ken Ring aswell - and when he talked to people and we have it here - I have talked withhundreds of NDEs, they all have the same problem that the people know that itis not proven that it is something possible, else, or beyond the body. So, theyneglect it, ignore it and say it is not proven. But you cannot prove as a medicaldoctor. I don't know. But they know (the NDEs). They always say, 'I don'tbelieve in life after death. I know there is some continuity of me which survivesmy body.'And why is that memory in only 18% of the patients that you studied?I don't know. There are also a lot of people who do not have an experience, butfor me it is even a wonder that it happens at all. And I cannot explain it. It's amiracle. It's a miracle that it happens because I cannot explain it.\"We b s it e s :http://www.thelancet.com/journalCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
