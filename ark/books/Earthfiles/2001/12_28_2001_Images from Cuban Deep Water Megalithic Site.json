The ocean engineer who found the structures isPaulina Zelitsky who is a partner with her husband, Paul Weinzweig, in aCanadian company called Advanced Digital Communications, or ADC, withoffices in both Victoria, British Columbia and Havana, Cuba. Their specialty isdeep ocean exploration. Paulina told Reuters that she had high resolutionsidescan sonar images of \"a huge land plateau with clear images of what appearsto be manmade large-size architectural designs partly covered by sand. Fromabove, the shapes resemble pyramids, roads and buildings.\"On December 21st, one of those sonar images above was released by the PrensaLatina press in Cuba. The article was entitled, \"Geology or Archaeology?Which is it?\" referring to the structures in the sonar images. This articledescribed Paulina Zelitsky's efforts over the past year to get sonar and videotapeimages by a remotely operated vehicle known as an ROV. Prensa Lati na alsointerviewed Dr. Gabino La Rosa, an archaeologist with the Cuban NaturalMuseum of Sciences, who has been studying the ADC sonar and videotapeimages. In this latest article, he suggests that the megalithic structures could benatural rock; or natural rock used for construction by an intelligent civilization;or artificial structures created by intelligence.Only one week before this article, another controversial story had appeared onDecember 14th in Prensa Latina which announced that archaeologist Dr. GabinoLa Rosa calls for \"prudence\" about possible discovery of a submerged city in thewestern waters of Cuba."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Red circle denotes general area of deep water megalithicstructures 2200 feet down off the western tip of Cuba.Interview:Paulina Zelitsky, Ocean Engineer and Partner, Advanced DigitalCommunications (ADC), Havana, Cuba: \"The December 14 Prensa Latinaarticle was written by a person who never met or spoke to any of the peopleinvolved, to any of the scientists involved. So, this person, a woman, called meafterward to apologize, this person didn't have access to any of the information.She just interpreted it herself as she wanted.That's why Dr. La Rosa got so upset?Dr. La Rosa got upset and other people. And we are upset as well. We askedLatina to reconsider.Did Dr. Gambino La Rosa, has he seen the videotape you have of stonesappearing to have the carved ovals in them?Yes, he did. He studied the videotape.Gabino La Rosa, Ph.D., Archaeologist,Cuban Museum of Natural Sciences, Havana, Cuba.What was his reaction?It appears to him they are artificial because they are completely smooth,flattened, and constructed in different shapes as blocks on blocks. If Nature didsomething like that, it could have been, but it's hard to explain how Naturewould work this way. Plus, the inscription that he apparently sees. It's hard toread them because visibility is poor under the water. At these depths, it's alwayspoor. And we have a lot of currents. It's hard to read them and we needadditional investigations in order to take many more data.Right, and I'm curious if he could see the crossed ovals, the oval cross, thatwe had talked about? (See: Earthfiles 11/19/01)Yes. Cuban television now broadcast them. They are showing and describing the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"cross.Do they have videotape from you to show?Videotape and sidescan sonar, yes. It's a sidescan resolution, like video, butmade acoustically.But have you released some of that July 2001 videotape for broadcast?Academy of Sciences asked for a few photographs, a few pictures that I havereleased. But of course, I selected those pictures to present evidence.In the Prensa Latina on December 21 by Manuel Vazquez, there is an imagethat says it is from the original sonar in 2000.That's correct. That's one of the images. We have of course many of thoseimages. And the Museum of Natural Sciences published a number of thoseimages and the Museum of Natural Sciences is alleging that it is impossible toexplain by nature, naturally, how these structures could be aligned this way.It definitely looks like a street between buildings, doesn't it?Ye s .From the other images where there is the corridor going between thesestructures, were some of the structures the ones you thought werepyramidal-shaped?Yes, some of them are. And the one I am most intrigued of all is one with manywalls intersecting. When you have intersecting walls, many of them, - and in aperfect shape - then it's really impossible to explain by Nature. And that onestructure has many intersecting walls.Paulina Zelitsky at her computer in Havana studying a pyramidal-shapedstone videotaped at the half mile deep site in July 2001 by her ADC remote operatedvehicle(ROV).

This is video. The video was taken in 2001 and the sonarimages were taken in 2000. What is very important to point out is that wehaven't made any definite conclusions because we don't have sufficient data. Wehave a number of hypotheses and one hypothesis that is very strong in ouropinion is that these structures are natural, but re-shaped and accommodated byintelligent beings.That Dr. La Rosa himself feels that he is looking at data that suggestsartificial structure?Yes, he does because granite is not natural to the area.Granite has definitely been confirmed?Well, it's white. We couldn't take the sample because to take the sample youhave to drill in the granite and it is very difficult. But we are building a robotthat is walking on the bottom and this robot will have all stability required inorder to drill for samples, in order to carve, in order to remove, it will be first inthe world - a robot that is built for deep underwater archaeology. All kinds ofdifficult tasks for deep water and the robot is designed to work at a depth of2000 meters.A robot being built by ADC for deep underwater archaeology whichcan \"walk\" along the ground amid the megalithic structures, drill for samples,carve and suck up substrata for analysis. Image © 2001 by ADC with permission.You mean it will mechanically be able to roll along the bottom where thestone structures are?Actually, it will walk as insects. It looks like an insect, like a scorpion, becauseit has a manipulator that is 10 meters long. It's a manipulator that can swing 360degrees.At the end, is there a camera as well as the ability to drill?Yes, at the end, there is a camera and lights and in total there are three camerason this robot and many lights. And it has the ability to drill, to carve, to remove,to excavate, even to weld. The most for archaeology, it has the ability to washaway sediments and to suck in large amounts.To actually suck in for analysis?Ye s .When will this robot be placed down at the site, do you think?This summer.Any idea yet about approximately when?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"June or July.When you and Paul Weinzweig and I talked in November, you thought youmight be able to get down for more videotaping towards the end of Januaryor early February. Is that still on?Yes, we will attempt to do that, but you have to remember that it's winterweather and it's difficult with the system we have right now, as I told you, it's anavigating, flying robot. It's difficult for this kind of robot on tethered cable todo effective work because of sea conditions. In winter time, it's rare that seaconditions are quiet.Will National Geographic be involved at all?Yes, I would think so. They are media, aren't they?Yes. I'm referring back to last year when we I first talked with PaulWeinzweig and then National Geographic who said they were trying towork out an agreement. I think your husband said there were so manycomplications. So, I didn't know if anything had ever been resolved?Well, they expressed their interest for years now to partner with us in thisproject. But there are some governmental and political complications. You haveto remember that we are working in Cuban waters.Does that make everything more difficult in terms of working with anAmerican company?I know that everybody involved is aware of the fact that between Cuba andAmerica and the United States there are a number of political disagreements.So right now, you and your husband and your company, ADC, will be thesole controllers and distributors of the information?Yes, because our Canadian company is working under license in Cuba. And weare working jointly with numerous Cuban organizations in this field.What is your personal opinion of all the images you have seen so far?What is number one, that it could be made by nature. Then we can't explainhow such a complex architecture could be made by Nature. His number two isthat it's made by man, some ancient part of man. It is definitely not a civilizationthat we know in history, in present history. And Number Three, that these arenatural structures that were reshaped and accommodated by intelligent beings.Is ADC working with any other companies or countries to help finance allthis exploration?Nobody is helping us to finance this. No institutions are helping us to finance. Itis a completely private initiative. It's very difficult.We will welcome any private or institutional groups, as investors or contributors,to participate with us if they wish to and are able. The thing is, we need them tocontribute. We don't just want free passengers. We are privately financed andthese kinds of expeditions are costly. So, those who want to participate couldshare with us both the responsibilities as well as the benefits.More Information:If you are interested in communicating with ADC about shares or partnership inthe deep underwater research of the megalithic structures off the western tip ofCuba, Paulina Zelitsky and Paul Weinzweig have provided this fax number and"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"e-mail for communication:Advanced Digital Communications (ADC)FAX: 537-971690e-mail: adcmar@colombus.cuCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
