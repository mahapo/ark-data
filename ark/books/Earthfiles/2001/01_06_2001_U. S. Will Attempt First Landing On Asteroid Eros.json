The color is close to what the unaided humaneye would see.The butterscotch hue is typical of a wide variety of minerals thought to be majorcomponents of asteroids such as Eros.

Scientists on the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) team atJohns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Marylandhave been controlling NASA's NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft orbiting the asteroidEros since February 14, 2000. Now, nearly one year to the day on February 12,2001, NEAR's rocket engines will be turned on to slow the orbiter's descenttoward Eros at about 7 miles per hour.Robert Farquhar, NEAR mission manager told reporters, \"Who knows whatNEAR will do. Even if it's a crash landing, it's a first landing.\"The NEAR spacecraft was not designed to set down on the asteroid. Its missionhas been to photograph from high and low orbits every inch of the massive, 21mile long, foot-shaped rock out in the asteroid belt about 100 million miles fromearth. But the spacecraft's orbit control has been so successful that it seemedworth trying for close-up images on or very near the rocky surface, if only for afew seconds before bouncing back into orbit. Whatever happens, the NEARspacecraft camera will be taking pictures. Already 150,000 images have been"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"sent to the NEAR scientists.

Thestrange similar holes with consistent orientations have also been found in otherareas of the asteroid. According to JHUAPL, some contain unexplained, smoothpond-like material. \"Neither the surface sculpturing nor the pond-like materialsare well understood and both will be investigated in detail using even higher-resolution images from NEAR Shoemaker's low passes over Eros in January toFebruary 2001.The \"paw print\" crater on Eros known as Psyche, about 4.6 miles (7.4 kilometers) across."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"NEAR Shoemaker image on November 25, 2000 from 122-mile (197 kilometers) altitude.The white material is on Psyche's northern wall.
