This map showswarmerthan average temperatures were widespread across much of the United States and most ofEurope.Temperatures in the red areas were 1.8 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Centigrade)above averageglobal annual temperatures between 1961 and 1990. The only cooler place was Australiawheretemperatures were between 1.8 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (1-3 degrees Centigrade)cooler than average.

Oneof the presentations that made international news also appeared in a DecemberNational Academy of Sciences report. It warns that global warming, combinedwith increasing greenhouse gas pollution, could trigger a rapid climate changewith unpredictable consequences. Scientists who have been studying the icecores of Greenland and other regions of the world say the data indicates thatclimate changes in the past have included one sudden global temperatureincrease of 18 degrees Fahrenheit in only a decade or less.Current computer models project steady global warming over the next 100 yearsand indicate that sea levels will continue to rise and threaten coastal populationswith more flooding while many food-producing regions of the world will facepersistent drought. One of the leading atmospheric physicists at the meeting wasDr. Wallace Broecker, a professor of environmental sciences at ColumbiaUniversity's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory in New York. He compared thecurrent global climate threat to \"being blindfolded and walking toward the edgeof a cliff. We don't understand what causes rapid climate changes, so we don'treally know what to look for. Or when we reach the cliff.\"This week I asked Dr. Broecker if our planet were to be pushed into a suddenclimate change, given current greenhouse conditions, would heating escalate? Orcould temperatures unexpectedly dive toward a new Ice Age?Interview:Wallace Broecker, Ph.D., Professor of Earth Sciences, ColumbiaUniversity, Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, New York, New York:\"Well, I don't think we know. And one has to put this all in context. Theseabrupt changes occur only during glacial time. And they appear to have beentriggered by pulses of fresh water that went into the northern Atlantic ocean andeffected the large scale circulation in the entire world ocean.There were sharp changes in both directions, so it would jump from very cold tointermediate cold and then a thousand years later back from intermediate cold toextreme cold. So, there were sort of rectangular changes (meaning if data put ongraph.)With this warming trend and the increasing thickness of the carbondioxide blanket around our planet, what is your own projection for whatcould happen as we move through the 21st century?We are lacking some big parts of the puzzle, therefore, we have to be humbleabout what we are doing to the planet. We cannot really predict whether thiswarming is going to remain gradual or whether it's going to reach some criticalpoint where this system decides to reorganize into one of its other states. And alot of effort is now going into trying to get to the bottom of what is going on.That doesn't mean we are going to be able to make an accurate predictionbecause predictions like this are difficult.As I said in the press conference, it's somewhat like walking along with the fearthere might be a steep cliff you are walking toward. But Number One, you're noteven sure if the cliff is there. And if it is, you don't know where it is, so you don'tknow which step will take you over the brink. And that's the situation we are in.We don't know for sure whether CO2 warming will push us over the cliff. Andof course, if it is going to do that, I would say the likelihood is that it's not in thenext several decades, but rather something that might happen in a hundred yearsor so if we continue business as usual production of CO2 and don't do anythingto stem its build up in the atmosphere."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"What would you expect to be the first signs that we had pushed the earthover the cliff?Since in the past it appears the trigger has been in the ocean and in particular inthe production of deep waters in the cold polar regions of the earth, what Iwould do is keep my eye on as many details of the salinity, temperature, flowrates of the waters in those regions. That could give us a clue that the conditionsare changing such as there might be a reorganization. But as I said, we don'treally understand the phenomenon, so that it's not clear that that would help.But it would be foolish if we didn't look at that because that's the most likelyplace where this is going to occur.Changes in the North Atlantic drift would affect Europe's climate verymuch, wouldn't it?My original idea was that Europe would be the most affected by this. But I thinknow we have evidence that these changes are global. They appear to behemispherically symmetrical. In other words, they were just as big in NewZealand as they were in the Swiss Alps.So, one of the big problems in getting to the bottom of this is that we knowthese changes were really fast and they occurred all over the earth. But we reallydon't understand what the link is between changes in ocean circulation andatmospheric climate because it is the atmospheric climate that changed a lot andthat is what will affect us and we don't know what that link is. We think therehas to be a fast connection with the tropical Pacific, but we don't reallyunderstand what that connection is. And that's what scientists are struggling tofigure out.In the process as the earth has definitely been warming over the last 100years, we have been losing glaciers. We have lost at least 40% of the Arcticpole ice. We've seen increasingly large icebergs fall off Antarctica. Withthis decrease in the icy reflection from the earth's mountains and otherareas, does anyone have an idea what the consequence will be?Well, you are correct. The mountain glaciers are disappearing and presumably asgreenhouse warming continues, they are going to disappear in most placesaltogether. However, as far as the overall heat budget of the earth, since thosemountain glaciers are tiny compared to the rest of the continents, that effect willbe small.Also, the amount of fresh water they dump into the ocean is small because theyare small. We would, if the Arctic were to become ice free, of course that shouldin itself make a large climate change. I mean, especially at high northernlatitudes that open water would mean that everything was warm. So, again, youknow we are playing with a system that we really don't understand and that's theunfortunate part.People who don't think the CO2 problem is a serious one would say we have toprove exactly what will happen before any action will be taken. Well, that'sexceedingly unfortunate and that's exactly the opposite of our stance on mostenvironmental problems. Normally, you have to write an impact statementshowing there will be no serious consequences before you can do something. Inthis case, we are doing it and people want to turn it exactly around and say youhave to prove it's going to be a really serious problem to the economy andwildlife and so forth before anything can be done.The irony is that it could be potentially the most dangerous trigger to kickin that anybody could comprehend. And I'm curious if anyone has runcomputer projections now having to do with the total melt down of theArctic ice to clear water and what that might do to the global climate?People are doing that, that's for sure. But you have to remember that thesemodels are great for projecting weather for three or four days. But, they are veryfallible for projecting climate. People have made runs at what would happen ifthe Amazon Basin was totally de-forested. Would that make more or lessrainfall? Warm the planet? Cool the planet? And different models give different"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"results.What's the worst case?I think the biggest impacts will be on wildlife. We're already very concernedabout extinctions and demise of forest lands and everything. So, a major climatechange that's where the price is going to be paid and it's going to wreak havocwith environmental systems. Man can adapt. Environmental systems can't onthat kind of time scale.The United Nations 2001 Panel on Global Climate Change reportsuggested that all of the lab computers indicate that over the next onehundred years, the global mean temperature could rise as much as 10.5degrees Fahrenheit. that would be as much as the entire temperaturechange of the earth since the last ice age.That's right.The consequences would be what?It's going to change everything! If the planet warms up that much, it's going toslow down circulation in the ocean which will slow down the up welling ofnutrient elements which are necessary for algae and hence, fish production.Plankton.Yes. For plankton growth and hence, the food web that feeds off the plankton,that's going to be slowed down.You're talking about a decline of species in the ocean at an acceleratedrate?There will be less of everything in a broad sense because if you reduce primaryproductivity by 50%, then you are going to have to reduce everything along theline by 50%. Now, I don't think anyone knows how to convert that into thesurvival of species. It certainly isn't going to help. I mean those species which arethreatened, that will just put more pressure on them.Among the crises that we might face in the United States, is one of themincreasing drought?Ye s .NOAA reports that United States drought in 2001 affected about 20% of the nation.The areas most severely affected included much of the West, Texas and Oklahoma,and by November, most of the East coast. Map courtesy NOAA.I know that Pennsylvania and so many places have had droughts this yearof 2001. If it continues like this in a pattern, what will happen to our foodsupply?Well, you know, as it warms, the amount of rainfall isn't going to decreaseeverywhere on the planet. So some places are going to get more and some are"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"going to get less. That's what I said. We are going to have to adjust. So as it driesout in one place, it will get wetter in another and if that happens to have arableland, then one would shift. We grow grain near Denver because it is very dry andwheat can grow in a dry climate. Corn requires much more water. So, in Iowawe grow corn. Farmers are eternally resourceful and I would assume.As climate changes, they would change crops?Yeah. Or, you know, there is all kinds of genetic engineering and tools they haveto cope with this. But of course if the bread baskets of the globe all really driedout, then that would be tough because that is where all the agricultural land is.And to some extent, the models would reject that they will dry out. So that mayprove to be a very serious problem.This graph shows the percent of the U. S. mainland that was very warm or cold fromDecember 2000 to November 2001. During November 2001, two-thirds of the UnitedStatesaveraged very warm, which contrasts sharply with November and December of last yearwhen more than half the country was unusually cold.

Biologists and zoologists have beenwarning for several years that the earth is going through the 6th mass extinctionof plant, animal and insect species, comparable to the last global die off ofdinosaurs 65 million years ago. The cause? Human industrial pollution, globalwarming and destruction of natural habitats.The October 2001 issue of Nature contained a report entitled, \"CatastrophicShifts in Ecosystems\" by a consortium of international scientists. Their dataindicate that many of the world's ecosystems - including coral reefs and tropical"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"rain forests - are so fragile they could completely collapse if further damaged byenvironmental assaults such as chemicals, drought or fire. Until now, scientiststhought that ecosystems were more resilient and responded slowly, but steadily,to climate and environmental changes. The new research reported in Naturewarns of sudden collapses in animals and plants.'Dr. Jonathan Foley at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, a co-author of thestudy, says: \"Ecosystems might go on for years exposed to pollution or climateshifts without showing any change at all. And then suddenly, they can flip intoan entirely different condition, with little or no warning. The idea that naturecan suddenly flip from one kind of condition to another that is probablyirreversible is sobering.'The scientists point out that humans have assumed we can keep altering theearth with time to change things if we see negative results. But the research nowshows that we might see little effect 'until the breakpoint. Once the catastrophicchange has occurred, the way back is very difficult. ... Some of the rapidswitches might take us by surprise and cause not only a tremendous loss ofbiodiversity, but also play havoc with human use of nature ... And theproductivity of food and forestry systems upon which we all depend.'\"More Information:\"CO2 build up will remain in the air a long time, longer than 100years. If we want to stop CO2 rising, we pretty much have to shutdown the production of fossil fuels. If we want it to level off, wewould have to shut down emissions almost totally by 2060. And thenwe would still have a CO2 content approaching double what it wasin 1800. So, we are destined no matter what we do to have higherCO2. The question is whether we can level it off in the 600 parts permillion range or whether it is going to go up to 900 or 1000. Whenyou get up in that high range, every (computer) modeler would agreethere is going to be a very significant warming.\"- Wallace Broecker, Atmospheric Physicist, Columbia University,December 2001We b s it e s :http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/2001/perspectives.htmlU.
