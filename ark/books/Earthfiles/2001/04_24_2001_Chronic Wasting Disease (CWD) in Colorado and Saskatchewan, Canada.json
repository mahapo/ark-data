Various distorted prion proteinshapes are what cause diseases such as Chronic Wasting Disease in deer and elk;scrapies in sheep; BSE Mad Cow; Creutzfeldt-Jakob and new variant-CJD; and kuru -all attacking brain and spinal cord tissue in animals and humans and always fatal. Thesediagramsare from Huang, Z., Prusiner, Stanley B. and Cohen, Fred E. from \"Structures of prionproteins andconformational models for prion diseases in Prions Prions Prions(ed. S.B. Prusiner) Berlin: Springer-Verlag, © 1996.April 24, 2001 Denver, Colorado - Another infectious agent made headlinesin North America in April 2001. That is the fatal prion brain destroyer known as\"Chronic Wasting Disease,\" or CWD. The first case of chronic wasting diseaseconfirmed in a wild mule deer was shot by a hunter last fall in Saskatchewannear the border of Alberta, Canada. Over the past four years, dozens of CWDcases have been confirmed in Saskatchewan's 19 captive game farms. About3000 animals have been slaughtered there in an attempt to keep the dreadeddisease from spreading. Elk are raised on the game farms for their meat and theirantler velvet which is used in homeopathic remedies and to provide aphrodisiacsfor Asia. But now even Korea has banned imports of elk antlers from Canadabecause of concerns about spreading chronic wasting disease.In Colorado in January and February, hunters killed 206 deer that were testedfor CWD. Nineteen of them were positive with the prion disease, or about 8% ofthe herd. In an area north of Fort Collins and in southeastern Wyoming, as manyas 10 to 15% of the deer are testing positive for chronic wasting disease. So, theColorado Division of Wildlife decided to eradicate at least 300 of the infecteddeer and have been killing them this month. This week I talked with the WildlifeDivision's Chief Information Officer, Todd Malmsbury in Denver, who saidslaughtering animals to control disease is a decision no one likes."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Buck and doe mule deer in Colorado.Photograph courtesy Colorado Division of Wildlife.Interview:Todd Malmsbury, Chief of Information, Colorado Division of Wildlife,Denver, Colorado: \"This is certainly not a happy situation for anyone here. Wehave game managers who worked in this area, in some cases for more than 20 or30 years. They worked very hard to manage, protect and enhance the deer herd.Now we're faced with the situation in selected areas of having to decrease thatsame herd that they have worked so hard to increase in size. It's really toughduty for our folks, especially for those who have to actually go out and shootand kill animals.DO YOU TALK WITH PEOPLE ABOUT THE CONCERN IF BSEJUMPED SPECIES FROM BOVINE AND HOOFED ANIMALS INENGLAND TO PEOPLE THAT THE SAME THING COULD HAPPENFROM CWD IN DEER AND ELK TO PEOPLE?One of the places where the jump might likely occur might be from deer or elkto cattle, given they are more similar than people. We have studies underwayright now that are being conducted jointly by state, federal and universityresearchers. What they have done is take cattle that are healthy and put them inpens with deer that have CWD. After 42 months, none of the cattle havedeveloped wasting disease. We have also taken literally infected material and fedit directly to healthy cattle and after 42 months, none of those animals havecontracted wasting disease.In a similar situation, if healthy deer are associated directly with sick deer, thedeer in a matter of months or perhaps a year or so will contract the disease. Andif you feed the material directly to deer, again those deer will get sick. The cattlehave not. It's still an ongoing study and it's a 10 year study which in terms of adeer and a cow is a very long time because we want to be sure if there can be ajump in species barrier.So far, at this point, it's encouraging, but it's not completed. It would beconsistent with lab and other work that there is a very specific species barrier forthese TSEs, transmissible spongiform encephalopathy or wasting type diseases.But the research needs to be completed before we can say with more certainty.BECAUSE WE ALREADY KNOW THAT IT JUMPED FROM HOOFEDANIMALS IN ENGLAND TO PEOPLE.That's right. What occurred in England, and I'm certainly not an expert on this,but what we've been told by colleagues and others about what happened there -that a large amount of infected material, including both the brain and spinaltissue from infected cattle, literally hundreds of thousands of infected cattle,were fed in various meat products including sausages and other ground upproducts that include brain and spinal tissue directly to millions upon millionsof citizens of the U. K. and to some lesser stance, the Continent. That sort ofactivity has not occurred here. But that appears to be based on what we learnedoccurred there. For that reason we are urging people not to eat the brain orspinal tissue of any animal that appears to be sick or any animal under anycircumstances."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Fortunately, that's not a practice that occurs. I personally, nor anyone I workwith or associate with wildlife, knows anyone who eats deer brains or deerspinal tissue. The work done in the U. K. and on the Continent has shown thatthe disease is not in the meat of the animals. But still, our recommendation andof health officials is that even though there is no suggestion to date that thedisease has caused illness in humans nor will cause illness in humans, it is justsound basic common sense: If you are a hunter, don't take any animal that lookssick. If you take an animal that looks sick, don't eat it. And that's true of anynumber of diseases where we know there can be transmission such as tularemiain rabbits where a person can get quite sick from that.IF THE ANIMAL EVEN SEEMS TO BE HEALTHY AND IS A DEERAND ELK, DON'T EAT THE BRAINS OR THE SPINAL CORD?That's exactly right, and fortunately, that is not a common practice.And of course, people don't eat the rendered products of deer and elk as they docattle. But clearly the exposure that occurred in the U. K. there were hundredsof thousands of sick animals fed to millions of people, including not only themeat but also brain and spinal tissue and other internal organs.THAT RAISES AN INTERESTING QUESTION ABOUT THE DEERAND ELK IN NORTH AMERICA: DEER AND ELK ARE NOT KNOWNTO EAT THE BRAINS AND SPINAL CORDS OF OTHER ANIMALS, IDON'T THINK.Nope.HOW DID THE PRION DISEASE DEVELOP IN THE DEER AND ELKIN COLORADO AND WYOMING IN THE FIRST PLACE ANDCONTINUE TO SPREAD?We don't know why it developed her and not in other places. And when youlook at the various factors that are involved here in terms of the habitat, thepopulation of animals, there is nothing special about southeastern Wyoming andnortheastern Colorado certainly. We do know, based on what we've observed inour research, that the disease once present can be spread from animal to animal.That's how it's spread within the deer family. But specifically, why did it occurhere and not in western Colorado or Nebraska or Pennsylvania or Michigan. Wedon't know the answer to that.\"Another Strange Disease Has Shown Up In Pennsylvania CarpThe strangest microbe that might turn out to be yet another prion disease hasturned up in 10,000 coy carp that died in the summer of 2000 at a commercialfish company about 30 miles from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The beautiful andcolorful carp were being raised to sell for ornamental ponds. The water theywere kept in was raw Susquehanna River water that originates in the great lakes.the fish had been growing for a year in good health from inch-long babies whensuddenly they began to die in the hundreds each day. tissue samples were sentto many different labs and experts, one of which is Dr. Fred Rommel, Chief ofImmunology and Aqua Culture Services at the Pennsylvania VeterinaryLaboratory in Harrisburg. After a year of all kinds of tests, here is what Dr.Rommel has to say:Fred Rommel, Ph.D., Chief, Immunology and Aqua Culture Services,Pennsylvania Veterinary Lab, Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: \"At this point, westill have not been able to identify it. It is an extremely bizarre (laughs) - I don'twant to call it a \"creature\" - but an extremely bizarre agen to work with. It growsextremely slowly. It has very peculiar morphology and characteristics in tissueculture. But it is undoubtedly there. We have a lot of pictures of the effects ontissue culture. We have no electronmicroscopy images yet, but we hope in thenear future to get those.WHAT IS THE STRANGE MORPHOLOGY?The shape. It's very hard to describe. All I can say is that after the end resultafter a month or month and a half in tissue culture is a large, round body, manyof them in the tissue culture that has obviously begun and slowly destroys tissue"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"culture cells. It's a large, round body with no symmetrical internal structure, butrather just a lot of granular material inside this round body and there are alsobizarre shapes of this same thing I am describing.WHAT WOULD BE A BIZARRE EXAMPLE?Well, elliptical, round, they attach to each other. They are as what I woulddescribe as no particular shape at all.GOING FROM THERE TO WHETHER THESE PERHAPS COULD BEMISSHAPEN PRIONS HAS COME UP?Well, yeah. It's always a casual speculation. It's because of their very slowgrowth pattern. And coupled with that is the fact the tissue culture cells arederived from carp brain. And they are being investigated and their propertiesexamined in collaboration with some German workers by Dr. LaPatra at theClear Spring Foods in Idaho.WE'RE BACK AGAIN IN BRAIN AND PERHAPS SPINAL TISSUE INWHICH THIS STRANGE ORGANISM IS FOUND IN YOURCULTURE?That's right.THAT IS UNIDENTIFIED IN NORMAL FISH DISEASE, BUT DOES FITTHE SLOW GROWING AND DISINTEGRATING PATTERN OF PRIONDISEASE?Well, it could. Let's put it that way. I don't think anyone would be willing to callit a prion yet, but it's a very strange, slow-growing. It grows best in this newtissue culture cell line which is derived from carp brain.IF THIS CARP OUTBREAK OF DEATHS IN THE SUMMER OF 2000 INTHE SUSQUEHANNA PROVES OUT TO BE A PRION DISEASE,WOULD THIS BE THE WORLD'S VERY FIRST DOCUMENTEDLARGE KILL-OFF OF A SPECIES LINKED DIRECTLY TO PRIONDISEASE?Yes. It certainly would. It certainly would.\"We b s it e s :http://www.wildlife.state.co.us/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
