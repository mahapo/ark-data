Aerial photograph © 2001 by Frank Laumen.Zierenberg and Kassel, Germany have been the focus of crop formations through the1990s.May 19, 2001 Zierenberg, Germany - The fourth European crop formationsince April 26 was discovered on Sunday, May 13 at 7:30 a.m. by the farmer inyellow flowering oilseed rape not far from Kassel, Germany in the farmingcommunity of Zierenberg. Each year for the past several years from May 1 on,formations have emerged in Zierenberg crops. The sixfold formation in 2001 isone of the most intricate ever to appear in crisp, dense oilseed rape (canola). Oneither side of the sixfold pattern are \"signatures\" of an \"L\" an a crescent ring.The farmer told researcher and photographer Frank Laumen that he \"wassurprised to have found no signs of a human footprint on the soil and the plantswere pretty wet in the morning. It would have been impossible not to causesuspicious footprints, but there were none.\"Frank reported that several visitors to the formation reported to have felt astrong energy, so strong that some had to leave the formation after about twentyminutes."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Ground photograph with fisheye lens of Zierenbergoilseed rape formation © 2001 by Frank Laumen.Warnford, Hampshire, EnglandTwo mornings earlier on May 11 across the English Channel in Hampshire,England, another farmer tending his oilseed rape field found a large flattenedcircle surrounded by two rings right below the Old Winchester Hill.Old Winchester Hill, Hampshire, England, rings around a flattened central circlein yellw flowering oilseed rape. Discovered by farmer on May 11, 2001.Aerial photograph © 2001 by David Russell via swirlednews.com.The area is between East and West Meon which have had repeated formationsthroughout the 1990s. Like most farms in England suffering through thedevastating scourge of foot-and-mouth disease, all access to the fields have beenclosed off. Researcher and Lucy Pringle has asked the farmer for specialpermission to enter the formation to do plant and soil tests on Sunday, May 20.Afterward, she will fly over the formation and take photographs. I talked withher today.Old Winchester Hill between West and East Meon,an area of repeated crop formations throughout the 1990s."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Interview:Lucy Pringle, Photographer and Author, Crop Circles, The GreatestMystery of Modern Times (1999), Petersfield, Hampshire, U.K.: \"This oneis really very remote. And there is a track leading up to it, but it's a helluva longwalk. So I'm going in tomorrow at half past nine. One of the farm hands wasthere the night it formed and he heard absolutely nothing and saw nothing. Andwhat it appears to be is circular with a flattened center. Then a circle of standingcrop, then another flattened bit, then another standing crop and a flattened bitand then the perimeter.THAT MAKES UP THE TWO RINGS AROUND THE FLATTENEDCIRCLE?That is correct.DOES IT SEEM FROM THE PEOPLE SO FAR WHO HAVE BEEN INIT...No one has been in it.NOBODY?No.YOU'LL BE THE FIRST TOMORROW.Yes, and you know people are not being allowed into these things because of thefoot-and-mouth disease. And if anyone was so insensitive, so inconsiderate, as tojeopardize these poor farmers, I would be part of the lynching party! I feel verystrongly about it. Well, anyway I hope to fly over it tomorrow night and to seewhat it's like. I think it will be very beautiful because it is very close to a verylarge iron age fort which is Winchester Hill and so it will have a lovelybackground to it, a lovely setting to it.Also being oilseed rape, it's one of the easiest to detect as you know whetherany weight has been applied or not. And as I don't believe anybody has been inthere simply because it is so remote and with the limitations of not beingallowed in, I hope we will be able to tell fairly accurately if weight has beenapplied to it, any human involvement.ISN'T IT NOTEWORTHY AFTER LAST YEAR AND ALL OF THECONFUSION AND CONTROVERSY ABOUT HOAXING THAT HEREIN THIS SPRING AFTER ALL THE BSE AND FOOT-AND-MOUTHDEVASTATION AND PEOPLE STAYING AWAY FROM THE FIELDS INENGLAND THAT THE FORMATION THAT DID COME WAS NOT INWILTSHIRE WHERE ALL THE CONTROVERSY WAS?Yes, indeed. This is a beginning as you so rightly said, the beginning was inHampshire, so it's almost as though it's making its mark to say, 'Right. Yes, herewe are again. And we're back where we started in the original place as a sort ofconfirmation, if you like, of the existence of the phenomenon.'\"We b s it e s :http://www.franklaumen.de/http://www.invisiblecircle.de/http://home.clara.net/lucypringlehttp://www.cropcircleresearch.com/http://home.hetnet.nl/~cropcircle/crop2001/Zevenbergen05.htmhttp://home.hetnet.nl/~cropcircle/crop2001/Aalten05.htm"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"http://invisiblecircle.de/ser/d2001/d200105131-uk.htmlhttp://www.dcca.nl/http://www.swirlednews.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
