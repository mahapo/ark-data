Graphic courtesy LightningStorm.com and Global Atmospherics, Inc.July 25, 2001 Tucson, Arizona - Since several atmospheric scientists suggestedthat the abnormal power surge in Hartsville, Tennessee on July 6, 2001 at 10:45a.m. might have been a rare clear day lightning strike, I contacted the NationalLightning Detection Network (NLDN), the only national lightning detectionnetwork in the United States. The network has more than 108 sensors thatinstantaneously detect the electromagnetic signals given off when lightningstrikes the earth's surface. Each sensor transmits the lightning information viasatellite to the Network Control Center (NCC) in Tucson, Arizona. Using datafrom two or more sensors, the \"intersection\" of the data enables thedetermination of a strike location with a 15 mile radius.The strike locations are stored in the computer archives which are used toproduce StrikeNet fact sheets. I requested one for 165 Marlene Street (locationof WJKM Radio), Hartsville, Tennessee on July 6, 2001 at 10:45 a.m. CST. Thereport below states, \"Lightning was not detected within the search area and timespan.\"StrikeNet Lightning Storm Report for 165 Marlene St., Hartsville, Tennesseewithin a 15 mile radius between midnight to midnight, July 6-7, 2001."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"StrikeNet lightning search area, 15 mile radius around central Hartsville, Tennessee,from midnight CST July 6 to midnight July 7, 2001.

By recording eight to nine outof every ten cloud-to-ground lightning flashes, the NLDN achieves high stormdetection efficiency. ... A zero strike report is issued only whenLightningStorm.com can conclusively state no lightning was detected.\"Can lightning cause damage without directly striking the location of loss?NLDN says yes. \"Due to the intense power of a lightning strike, currents can becarried hundreds or thousands of yards, depending on the conducting surfaces.Electric utility, telephone and plumbing lines are widely recognized conductorsfor carrying surges into facilities.Controversy:Professor Michael Kelley, Atmospheric Physicist and Engineer at CornellUniversity, insists there is a rare phenomenon of \"clear sky lightning.\" However,Nancy Roth, Marketing Supervisor at Global Atmospherics in Tucson, Arizonae-mailed me the following comment: 7/25/01 E-mail: \"FYI, there is no such thing as a 'clear sky lightningstrike.'
