The word anthraxis Greek for \"coal\" because of its blackness. With antibiotic treatment, cutaneousanthrax can be cured. Without treatment, the mortality rate can be 20%.2) Ingestion/gastrointestinal anthrax - bacteria form on spoiled, undercookedmeat which when eaten make people extremely ill and can cause death.Symptoms include nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, low energy and bloodydiarrhea. Antibiotics can help if treatment is early in the disease. But mortalityrates are high because early diagnosis is difficult. To date, no cases ofgastrointestinal anthrax have been reported in the U. S.3) Inhalation anthrax - dry anthrax spores can be breathed deep into the lungs.If enough - approximately 8,000 to 10,000 spores - are inhaled, the sporesgerminate into anthracis bacteria. First symptoms are like a flu with fever, drycough and chest pain anywhere from six to 45 days after exposure. The maturingbacteria produce lethal toxins that spread into the bloodstream and causesystemic shock and collapse of body systems resulting in death. Inhalationanthrax death rate exceeds 90%.Facts about Anthrax\"Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the spore-formingbacterium Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax most commonly occurs inhoofed mammals and can also infect humans.Symptoms of disease vary depending on how the disease wascontracted, but usually occur within 7 days after exposure. Theserious forms of human anthrax are inhalation anthrax, cutaneousanthrax,and intestinal anthrax.Initial symptoms of inhalation anthrax infection may resemble acommon cold. After several days, the symptoms may progress tosevere breathing problems and shock. Inhalation anthrax is often"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"fatal.The intestinal disease form of anthrax may follow the consumption ofcontaminated food and is characterized by an acute inflammation ofthe intestinal tract. Initial signs of nausea, loss of appetite,vomiting, and fever are followed by abdominal pain, vomiting ofblood, and severe diarrhea.Direct person-to-person spread of anthrax is extremely unlikely, if itoccurs at all. Therefore, there is no need to immunize or treatcontacts of persons ill with anthrax, such as household contacts,friends, orcoworkers, unless they also were also exposed to the same source ofinfection.In persons exposed to anthrax, infection can be prevented withantibiotic treatment.Early antibiotic treatment of anthrax is essential - delay lessenschances for survival. Anthrax usually is susceptible to penicillin,doxycycline, and fluoroquinolones.An anthrax vaccine also can prevent infection. Vaccination againstanthrax is not recommended for the general public to prevent diseaseand is not available.\" Since this CDC release, more anthrax vaccine production has been calledfor to help prevent larger public outbreaks of anthrax disease. Call yourlocal public health office for updates on vaccine supply for both anthraxand smallpox.We b s it e s :http://www.bt.cdc.gov/Agent/Anthrax/Anthrax.asphttp://www.nanobio.com/http://nano.med.umich.edu/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
