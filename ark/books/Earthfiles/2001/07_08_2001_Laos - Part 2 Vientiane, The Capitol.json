The chief occupation in Laos isagriculture and an estimated 90 percent of the people farm rice. For centuriespolitical upheavals by powers mainly outside Laos have erupted, including theVietnam war of the 1960s to 1970s. Yet, Laotian culture has remained closelytied to Buddhist religions and its own traditions of art, literature, music anddrama that are largely free of western influence."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"After checking in to the hotel, Producer Denise Blazek and I took off on alocation scout to visit some of the Buddhist stupas by open air taxi.Denise Blazek, producer from South Perth, Australia in Vientiane taxi to scout stupalocations for Bang Productions Ltd.

Photograph by Linda Moulton Howe.In Hindu and Buddhist mythology, nagas are semi-divine beings, half human andhalf serpentine. Their race is said to be strong and handsome and the beings canassume either human or serpentine form. Nagas are superior to humans andconsidered to be potentially dangerous. Their location on earth is anunderground kingdom called Naga-loka, or Patala-loka, which is filled withpalaces decorated with precious gems. Brahma himself, the personification ofdivine reality in a trinity with Vishnu and Shiva, is said to have relegated thenagas to the underground after their population had grown too large on thesurface of the earth. Brahma also commanded the nagas to bite only the trulyevil and so nagas are frequently carved as door guardians.The snake king, Mucalinda, protected the Lord Buddha from rain during a sevenday meditation. Subsequently, when nagas are depicted as human beings there isoften a canopy of many snakes over their heads. Nagas are also depicted as halfhuman with the lower part of their body below the navel coiled like a snake anda canopy of snake hoods over their heads.More nagas guarding the doorways to other Vientiane stupas.
