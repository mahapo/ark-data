August 12, 2001 Navarre, Florida and Austin, Texas Since the 1970s, therehave been waves of cat mutilations in Canada, the United Kingdom and theUnited States. In the summer of 2001, more mutilated cats are being found.Navarre, FloridaOn Saturday, June 30, in the small beach town of Navarre, Florida about fifteenmiles east of Pensacola a cat was found strangely cut up near its home. Theowners, John and Pattie Goodfleisch, had two cats: one female all white and theother male all black. On that Saturday morning, after the couple had let the catsout and awaited their return, the black male cat did not come back. The couplebegan searching and found the cat's severed front body on a sandy path neartheir house. He had been sliced from just behind his front legs all the way backto his tail bone. The missing half was never found. The Tiger Point AnimalHospital was asked to do a necropsy to determine cause of death. Theveterinarian said the wound did not appear to be accidental and the assumptionwas that a human with specific intent had cut the cat lengthwise and removedone half."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Northwestern Austin, Texas law enforcement are investigating a dozen incidents sinceMarch 2001 in which the head, neck and front legs of domestic cats have beensevered bloodlessly through the spine by a sharp instrument and most of theinternal organs, rib cage and spine removed. Austin, TexasSince March at least a dozen cats have been found cut in half behind their frontlegs in the northwestern residential area of Austin, Texas. The internal organsand spine sections are cleanly severed, but there is very little if any blood at thescene and no signs of struggle, leading investigators to speculate that the cats arebeing cut up somewhere else and then returned to their home vicinity. TheAustin Police Department and the Travis County Sheriff's Office have beeninvestigating and a large monetary reward has been offered for any informationabout the perpetrators. Currently, there are no current suspects and lawenforcement officials are baffled.I talked this week with Deputy Jimmy Quick at the Travis County Sheriff's Officeabout the repeating pattern in the dozen unusual cat deaths he is investigating,the most recent being August 4.Mutilated half cat photographed by Plano, Texas Police Officerfor Incident Report #91-44994, August 31, 1991.Interview:Deputy Jimmy Quick, Austin Police Department, Austin, Texas: \"As apattern, exactly what you mentioned the first time being cut behind theshoulders and bloodless and organs missing.HAVE THE HEADS BEEN PRESENT HOOKED ONTO THE NECK ANDFRONT LEGS IN ALL TWELVE CASES?Not all twelve. In all but two. In ten of them, the head was present. The organswere missing. Then in the latest two, they were chopped up into pieces andsome legs were skinned, but some organs were still missing and still bloodless.DR. WILLIAM CAMPBELL WAS THE EXCEPTION IN THAT THEY FOUNDBLOOD.Yeah, his was one of those that they think might have happened in the yard rightnext door. They found blood and hair. But according to the Offense Report, theofficer said, 'No, it didn't happen there because of the lack of blood.' so, youknow I'm going with both.THERE IS A POSSIBLE CONFLICT THERE IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNTOF BLOOD.Yeah. Only one of those is a Sheriff's Office case. Eleven of them are city policecases. In fact, we're the one who put out the number and we started getting allthe information of people calling, filling us in on all the dates they have"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"occurred that weren't reported. That's when we discovered about eight more.YOU'RE UP TO ABOUT A DOZEN?The public wasn't aware and once they were, most people just thought it waslike an animal attack of some sort. They thought it was kind of strange, prettyclean cuts, and no blood, but they didn't think to call anyone.DR. CAMPBELL SAID THEY WERE ABLE TO VERIFY IN THENECROPSY ON HIS OWN CAT THAT IT WAS DEFINITELY CUT WITH ASURGICAL INSTRUMENT BOTH IN THE TRACHEA AND IN THE BODY.Right, that's correct.WHAT ARE YOU IN THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE COORDINATING WITH THEAUSTIN POLICE DEPARTMENT DOING? ARE YOU PATROLLING IN THEAREA?Oh, yes, we have already beefed up patrol in that area and in those earlymorning hours. And we're looking to send extra people out. We sent theinformation out to our troops that work the area and told them to be on thelookout for anything in those hours because we're kind of narrowing it down tobetween 4 and 6 a.m. - at least when they are being returned. We're not sure,being that it appears these are being mutilated elsewhere, we're not sure whattime that's occurring, but we know they are being returned between 4 and 6 a.m.HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?Because of the times of peoples' dogs, times that dogs are barking in theneighborhood. We've had one incident where a lady said the dogs went crazyand she had been out with her dog like an hour before. The dogs were goingcrazy and she went back out again a little after 4 a.m. and there it was and thedog hit on it immediately. so, that's how we're narrowing those times down.People go out and take their dogs outside. Now, a lot of those houses out thereare big houses on big properties and they are not fenced. So, they go out withtheir dogs. And they take them out about 4 in the morning. Even my dog gets upabout that time. I don't know what it is, but about 4 in the morning some aregoing out with their dogs and some have told us, 'At 4 a.m., there was nothingthere in my neighbor's yard because my dog always sniffs around and goes allover the place. I went out there again at 4:30 a.m. and my dog went right after it.'So, that's happened at least three or four times and that's how we're knowingthose times.WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS THAT HOWEVER THESE CATS HAVE BEENRETURNED, IT'S HAPPENING ION A VERY TINY TIME PERIOD WITHPEOPLE KNOWING IT WASN'T THERE AT 4 A.M. AND FINDING IT AT4:30 A.M.Either happening at that narrow time period, or happening, the cats are beingpicked up earlier, OK? - and taken somewhere and the parts are brought backbetween that time period. That's what I don't know. All I can tell you is that thecats are being dropped back off, if that's the case, during that time period (of 4-6a.m.)WHAT'S BAFFLING IS THAT IF PEOPLE ARE OUT WALKING THEIRDOGS AND ARE AWARE THAT THERE WAS NO CAT IN THE YARD AT 4A.M. AND THEY FIND IT AT 4:30 A.M., HOW DID SOMEBODY, ORSOMETHING, RETURN. HOW DID THEY RETURN THE CAT WITHOUTPEOPLE NOTICING THAT?I don't know. That's puzzling to us. And they've got up to a $6,800 reward rightnow and we still haven't gotten any calls. And I would think that if anyone hadany information because we've asked for anything. And no one has given usanything.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Necropsy on Cat Owned by William Campbell, D.V.M.On July 26, 2001 at 8 a.m., one of the Austin cats was found cut in half andboth front and back ends were in the neighbor's yard next door to the owners,Dr. William Campbell, a veterinarian, and his wife, Linda. The Campbells workat the Anderson Mill Animal Clinic in Austin. The police investigated and askedDr. Campbell to have a necropsy done on his mutilated cat. Dr. Campbell askedone of his colleagues in the clinic to do the necropsy. Jasen Trautwein, D.V.M.,studied both the front and back sections of Dr. Campbell's cat and made asurprising discovery.Jasen Trautwein, D.V.M., Anderson Mill Animal Clinic, Austin, Texas:\"What I found most interesting was that there were two puncture wounds rightunder the neck that were about 1/8th inch in diameter and about 1/8th an inchapart. I almost missed them just looking over the cat because there were no signsexternally. there was no blood or other evidence of trauma except for these twoperfect puncture wounds. And then when I looked from the inside, I couldfollow these tracks - I still can't figure out what this device is - made tracks upthrough the tongue, so they both went through the tongue in the same hole likeone long slice in the back of the tongue, and then up into the tympanic bulla,the inner ear on the base of the skull and it fractured the bone there. Fragmentsand clotted blood were in that area, but none on the outside of those wounds.WAS THE ENTRANCE AT THE FRONT OF THE JAW?If you were going to scratch a cat under its chin, it would be almost right wherethe cat's Adam's apple would be.WHERE IT ENTERED THE SKULL, DID IT PENETRATE THE BRAINTISSUE?Well, the inner ear is part of the brain, so technically, yes.BUT IN TERMS OF THE GREY MATTER?I wouldn't know that because I didn't cut it open any further than that. I sent thecat to the police pathologist. They might have cracked that skull open. I didn'thave any tools to really do that so I didn't do it.FROM A MEDICAL POINT OF VIEW, CAN YOU THINK OF ANYPRACTICAL PROCESS OR PRODUCT THAT YOU COULD GET BYDRIVING THOSE TWO HOLES THROUGH THE THROAT AND INTO THEAREA YOU SAW?The only thing I thought they might be doing was they were using that to like ifyou put it on some hooks to help you hold it still, like especially if it was oneperson. It might have been a device to give it some tension so it would be easierto skin or cut those other holes. It would make it easier to do the dissection.THOSE TWO HOLES MIGHT HAVE BEEN USED BY SOME INSTRUMENTTHAT WOULD HOLD THE CAT IN PLACE WHILE THE REST OF THEEXCISIONS WERE DONE?Yeah, that's the only thing I could come up.TO SEPARATE THE CAT AT THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS RIGHT BEHINDTHE TWO FRONT LEGS, WHAT KIND OF INSTRUMENT WOULD ITTAKE TO DO WHAT YOU SAW?It was a really clean cut. The trachea and esophagus were cut perfectly clean. Itwas cut behind C-2 which is the second cervical vertebrae and it was actually avery clean cut there. It would take a good necropsy knife or filet knife to getthrough the tissue there. It takes a little bit of energy.WAS THERE ANY BLOOD LEAKING FROM AROUND THE EXCISIONS?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"No, not really. There was a little bit of blood on the fur, on the paws. Buteverywhere else there wasn't really any blood. Not as much as you wouldexpect.DIDN'T THAT SEEM UNUSUAL?Oh, yeah, I thought that was kind of strange.IN THE BACK HALF OF THE CAT, WERE THERE ANY INTESTINALORGANS?The large intestine was still there and about half an inch of the small intestineattached to the large intestine. And it almost appeared as if it had been tied offas if to keep all the contents from falling out like the way someone would if theywere gutting a deer and they tie a knot around the intestines. that way, if theycut them, they don't spill everywhere.THAT MEANS THAT....the stomach, heart, lungs, pancreas, spleen, kidneys, bladder, rib cage and ribsand all of the vertebrae from - 8 cervical, 13 thoracic and 7 lumbar - all gone.WAS THERE ANY BLOOD AT ALL IN THE BACK HALF OF THE CAT?Only a small amount on the fur. And that was interesting. The legs were broken.They looked like someone had sort of cracked them with their hands.COULD THAT HAVE OCCURRED IF THE ANIMAL HAD BEEN DROPPEDFROM THE AIR?I wouldn't think so. Not the way cats fall, or the pieces fall. No, this was likesomeone was starting to skin it and it's almost like you would grab a turkey leg.If you grabbed a stick on both ends and trying to pull your hands together andhow the stick would snap in the middle, that's how the legs were broken. That'show it was broken. It had a force on both sides, I think. When cats are dropped,they usually crack their sternums. But this one didn't have a sternum. I wouldn'texpect it to break the way this broke. Some of the leg bone breaks looked likethey were cut almost with tree trimmers.WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU THOUGHT, 'WHYISN'T THERE MORE BLOOD?'I thought someone had drained it. Some sort of cult type thing. some sort ofritualistic killing. I don't know. What surprised me most is that I would haveexpected the animal to be a bit messier.BECAUSE TO GET ALL OF THAT INTERNAL STUFF OUT, YOU WOULDTHINK BLOOD WOULD HAVE SPILLED OUT ON THE FRONT AND BACKHALF OF THE CAT.Yeah, I would have expected it to be messier, exactly.DOESN'T THIS SEEM TO IMPLY THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED TO THISCAT, THEY CUT IN TWO AND REMOVED ALL THOSE ORGANS ANDSTUFF THAT IT HAD TO HAPPEN SOME PLACE ELSE THAT WAS NOTIN THAT YARD. AND THE CAT HAD TO BE DROPPED, THROWN,RETURNED SOMEHOW TO THAT YARD. BUT THE PROCEDURECOULDN'T HAVE BEEN DONE IN THAT YARD.I wouldn't say couldn't, but definitely it's less likely.IT' IS MORE LIKELY IT WAS DONE SOMEWHERE ELSE...And brought back. Yeah.\"More Information"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Authorities have asked anyone with information to call the City of AustinAnimal Cruelty Investigator, Roy Erwin, at 512-708-6022 or the Travis CountySheriff's Office at 512-473-9721.When there is a re-emergence of cat and dog mutilation cases, there is usually anupsurge in mutilations of larger animals such as cows and horses. And thisspring I've also reported about unusual deaths and mutilations of horses andcattle in Missouri and Kentucky. And recently the Saskatchewan, CanadaSociety for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) reported that it hasseen nearly 100 cases over the past decade in which cows, horses and otheranimals have been found with their sexual organs bloodlessly removed. Themost recent case was a mutilated cow on May 19. A veterinarian who examinedthe cow said the cuts were very clean, bloodless yet surgical and it was a \"weirdcase.\"Dave Long, coordinator of investigations for the Saskatchewan SPCA says thereis no evidence of tearing or pulling to remove the excisions. The tissue is nothacked out. It's done expertly, like expert incisions cut it out. Coyotes bite andtear. They can't use surgical instruments.\"If anyone has information about current unusual animal deaths in your area,including cats, horses, cows or any other domestic animal, please e-mail me at:earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
