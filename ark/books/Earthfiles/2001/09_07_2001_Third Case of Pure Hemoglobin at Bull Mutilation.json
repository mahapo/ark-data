Photograph © 2000 by FernBelzil.September 7, 2001 St. Paul, Alberta, Canada - Rancher Fern Belzil of St.Paul has been investigating unusual cattle mutilations in Alberta for the pastseveral years. On October 16, 2000, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police calledhim about the eerie death of a 2200-pound bull found at the Saddle Lake IndianReserve on October 12 about fifteen miles southwest of St. Paul in a rural areacalled St. Brides. The bull was a seven year old Semmental, a robust blood linefrom Europe, owned by rancher Marshall Kiziak.In addition to the dry, bloodless \"cookie cutter\" excision of the scrotum, the earhad been cut off, the tongue was excised from deep within the throat and acircle of hide had been removed from around the rectal area. Oddly, the penishad been stretched out of the abdomen towards the rear legs and three of thebull's four small nipples had been excised, leaving a triangular pattern of smallred marks near the penis.Penis stretched from abdomen towards legs through excised hide.Red marks in triangular pattern are three of four small nipples removed from the bull.Photograph © 2000 by Fern Belzil."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Bull's ear excised at scalp. Photograph © 2000 by Fern Belzil.The bull's rear was laying on grass and soil only about eight inches from a clumpof willow trees. Biophysicist W. C. Levengood of Grass Lake, Michigan hadasked Fern to collect grass and soil samples for study from the mutilation site.Recently, the findings were released in a report by Levengood and analyticalchemist, Phyllis Budinger, confirming the third case of pure, dried hemoglobinat an animal mutilation.Interviews:Fern Belzil, Rancher and Animal Mutilation Investigator, St. Paul,Alberta, Canada: \"As I looked around and took pictures, I found two spots ofblood. One was 5 feet north of the animal, just a little bit of blood on the grass.And I found another little spot on grass about 15 feet away in the same directionfrom the animal. There were a few willows in between that, but it was on thegrass. And then I found these blood spots splattered on the willows just a fewinches from the animal. The blood spots were about 4 to 15 inches up on thebranches of the trees. I had never come across a case like this where blood wassplattered on the trees or ground like that. So I took samples of the bark andcarefully packaged it and sent it to Dr. Levengood.Willows a few inches from bull's rear that were spattered with blood drops.Photograph © 2000 by Fern Belzil.Do you think the hemoglobin discovery indicates that whatever technologyis being applied to these animals that perhaps the animals are removedfrom the pasture to have tissue excised and then are returned for someunknown reason?Well, there are some cases where we think these animals are being picked upand brought to whatever a ship, UFO, or? where Someone does their thing andthen drops the animals back down again.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Scientific AnalysisBiophysicist W. C. Levengood has been analyzing plants and soil from bothmysterious worldwide crop formations and what he calls \"bovine excision sites\"since the mid-1990s. He has published studies in the respected botany journal,Physiologia Plantarum, that show biochemical and biophysical changes insome crop formations that indicate \"a spinning plasma vortex with microwaveand other energies\" have interacted with the plants and soil. He does not knowthe source of the spinning plasma vortex, but he finds the same changes at someanimal mutilation sites.In his August 8, 2001 report, \"Bovine Excision: Alberta, Canada 2000,\"biophysicist Levengood writes: \"This is the third discovery of pure hemoglobinat a bovine excision site. In the Canadian sample discussed here, the hemoglobinwas found adhering to grass and on the bark of willow branches. ...The purity ofthe hemoglobin was confirmed by an infrared spectral analysis conducted byMs. Phyllis A. Budinger at her laboratory in Ohio.\"Analytical chemist Phyllis Budinger showed in her report how closely the bloodspots collected from the grass and willows near the mutilated Canada bull matchthe 1997 California bull and the 2001 Alabama mutilated cow discussed inEarthfiles.com on July 28, 2001.Red line is the October 12, 2001 Alberta bull hemoglobin residue; green is the 1997California bull hemoglobin residue; black is a whole boine blood reference;and blue is pure bovine hemoglobin used as a control for comparison.Further, chemist Budinger noticed in her spectrum analysis that there were\"missing bands and less absorption compared to that of the whole blood. Thisshows other whole blood components are missing; e.g., lipids and otherunidentified constituents. This is indication that a separation of the bloodcomponents has occurred.\" W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, GrassLake, Michigan: \"There are two implications: one is that this is being used bysome one, by some other dimensional beings or maybe in our own environment.I don't know. I don't know anyone who could this type of removal of thehemoglobin out in the middle of a pasture. But be that as it may, someone wantsthis material and is going to the trouble of removing it entirely from the blood, itlooks like. I don't know that for sure, but certainly the indications are that theyremove it totally.The other implication is that we had better more completely understand therelationship of the energies involved and what the mutilators are doing in our"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"environment because they are presenting us with some real puzzles and enigmashere.The fact that this pure hemoglobin has been found on mutilated animals inCalifornia (1997), Alabama (2001) and Canada (2001) - those areextremely separated geographic regions.That is true and I would expect it's probably more pervasive geographically andin amount than what we've found so far in our sampling.I believe the blood is not removed. I think it is totally disintegrated. I mean ifthey can do what they do with hemoglobin - put it in this dry, compact solidform and yet keep it chemically reactive - then they probably can disintegratethe rest of the components of the blood. (Also implied in analytical chemistPhyllis Budinger's laboratory report discussed above.)One medical laser researcher suggested it was hypothetically possible at amolecular level to remove specific tissue molecules by an advancedtechnology that humans do not yet have. But he expects that in the futuresurgeries on humans and animals could be accomplished by molecule-specific technologies. If you had that, you could focus something on ananimal and remove just the hemoglobin or blood liquid and nothing else.That's very possible.We might be seeing the residue of such a technology on these animals inCanada, Alabama and California.That's true and I would like to see some sophisticated mass spectroscopy donewhere the isotopic ratios are measured in some of these - not just thehemoglobin which would be extremely interesting - but some of the grassesaround the animal. I would like to see where I have found respirationdifferences, I would like to see if the isotopic ratios in the plants have beenchanged.\" More Information:Other Two Hemoglobin Confirmation ReportsEarthfiles 07/28/01 and Earthfiles 10/15/00Biophysicist Levengood welcomes help from other scientists and can be reachedat:W.
