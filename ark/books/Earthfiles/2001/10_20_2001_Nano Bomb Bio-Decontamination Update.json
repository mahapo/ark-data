At least 37 others havetested positive for exposure to anthrax spores. The eight cases of disease include:Inhalation Anthrax (one death, one recovery)Robert Stevens, the photo editor of The Sun tabloid newspaper atAmerican Media in Boca Raton, Florida. Died of inhalation anthrax onOctober 5.Ernesto Blanco, a mail-room employee at American Media. Anthraxspores confirmed in the mucous lining of his nose. Treated early withantibiotics and is recovering.Cutaneous Anthrax (all six taking antibiotics and full recovery expected)Female letter carrier at a West Trenton, New Jersey post office contractedanthrax skin infection.Male postal worker who sorts and loads mail at the Hamilton, New Jerseyprocessing center near Trenton contracted anthrax skin infection.Claire Fletcher, a CBS employee in Anchor Dan Rather's office in NewYork, contracted anthrax skin infection.Erin O'Connor, an NBC employee who works in Anchor Tom Brokaw'soffice, contracted anthrax skin infection."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Johanna Huden, assistant to the editorial page editor at the New York Post,contracted anthrax skin infection.7-month-old son of ABC News producer contracted anthrax skin infection.How does America cope with the threat of microbes from insidious terroristattacks? We need decontaminants that will kill the germs without hurting peopleand the environment. I've had many questions from Earthfiles viewers and radiolisteners about the \"nano bomb\" bio-decontamination solution I reported abouta few days ago. Further, this week on television, a bio-decontaminant called\"Sandia foam\" was demonstrated. It is made by Sandia Laboratories inAlbuquerque, New Mexico. This is not the nano bomb solution. Sandia foam isa caustic solution, similar to bleach. The white foam itself does not killanything; it is simply the visible part. The wet solution underlying the foam isthe bleach-like killer.Would the oily nano bomb solution invented at the University of Michigan workas well as the Sandia foam? Laboratory tests and field trials with the U. S. Armyat Dugway, Utah indicate the answer is yes for application to human skin andsurfaces.Is the nano bomb oily substance safer? According to its inventor, Dr. JamesBaker, Director, Center for Biological Nanotechnology at the University ofMichigan Medical School, the nanoemulsion material is so safe it can besprayed on children, animals, plants, structures - even mail - without harm.\"Nano bomb\" oily nanoemulsion liquid in laboratory beakers.This non-toxic bio-decontaminant will destroy anthrax spores. smallpox viruses andother microbes by blowing them up from the inside out. Photograph courtesy the Center forBiological Nanotechnology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan.Could the nano bomb solution be applied inside nostrils as a prophylactic to killgerms before microbes get into the body? That's a different medical category thatrequires at least two more years of testing and FDA approval in contrast to usingthe nano bomb solution now to decontaminate skin and surfaces.Why isn't the nano bomb bio-decontaminant already in the arsenal of agenciestrying to cope with bioterrorist threats? Dr. Baker and his new company,NanoBio Corp in Ann Arbor, Michigan, say the answer is lack of federalfunding to ramp up production from laboratory quantities to huge industrialamounts that can produce oil droplets in the nano size, smaller than the virusesand bacteria they are designed to kill.I talked this week with Ted Annis, CEO of NanoBio Corp, about the current"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"status of his and Dr. Baker's efforts to get the Nano Bomb bio-decontaminantworking in the U. S. I asked him how long it would be from now in October toget the material into the hands of military, police, fire, and health departments.Interview:Ted Annis, Chief Executive Officer, NanoBio Corp., Ann Arbor, Michigan:\"If I can get some help, I can do it well under 6 months. I need money from thegovernment. And I need someone to stimulate the FDA and the EPA to processour application which isn't filed yet. When it hits, I need them to fast track it.The funding would be used to complete some final testing to hire the army ofconsultants I will need to fast track the application and to hand carry theapplication, both applications, over to the EPA and FDA and the funding wouldalso be used to do pilot production, what they call scale-up. If I can come upwith the funding, I can deliver.THIS IS FOR SURFACE DECONTAMINATION?Ye s .IS SOMEONE IN THE MICHIGAN POLITICAL ORGANIZATION ATTHE STATE OR FEDERAL LEVEL HELPING YOU ON THIS?Ye s .YOU HAVE NOW AT LEAST A CONSCIOUSNESS AT THEPOLITICAL LEVEL ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE AND THAT AS FARAS ITS BEING A SURFACE DECONTAMINATE THAT IT HASPROVED TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN ARMY TRIALS AND YOU NEEDTO GO THIS LAST STEP TO DO TESTING AND RAMP UP FORBIGGER PRODUCTION AND IF YOU COULD GET THIS NOW, YOUWOULD HAVE THIS SUBSTANCE AVAILABLE TO VARIOUSAGENCIES IN THE PUBLIC IN 6 MONTHS OR SO?Yes. Hopefully less time. That's the plan. And given this bio attack we aresuffering, we will do everything in our power possible to expedite this. And Ihave done a fair amount. I have a whole lot of people waiting in the wingswaiting for me to pull the trigger on starting this.IS THIS NANOEMULSION INVENTED BY DR. BAKER - IS THISUNIQUE ON THE RADAR OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE WORLDRIGHT NOW?Yes, it is unique. But what distinguishes it from other things that kill this terribleanthrax spores is that it's not corrosive to the environment, to your skin.LIKE BLEACH IS?There are other things that kill spores. They would kill you, too, if you usethem. This (non-toxic) is what is unique about it. You have to use it in a specificway for decontamination. If you are decontaminating for smallpox or some othervirus or bacteria, you kill virtually upon contact. If you are decontaminatingagainst spores, you have to leave the surface wet for four hours. Wet with thenanoemulsion. Then you can come up and wet vacuum the stuff away.IT WOULD BE LIKE THE WAY THEY ARE ROPING OFF CRIMESCENES NOW, EVEN AS BIG AS WHERE THE WORLD TRACECENTER WAS. YOU WOULD ROPE OFF AN AREA AFTER YOU HADAPPLIED THIS NANOEMULSION AND YOU WOULD KEEP PEOPLEAWAY FROM THERE UNTIL THOSE FOUR HOURS HAD PASSED?xactly. Again, by the way, this is some of the things that money would be usedfor. To develop a decontamination procedure, what I'm talking to you about arelaboratory results. And then when you translate laboratory results to the realworld, then you look at things in a different scale and way and you have tocheck it out. this is what we have to do. But your audience will understand thatI'm speaking to you about laboratory results, the notion would be that youwould wet everything down with this stuff. Let it wait a minimum of 4 hours andthen you would wet vac it up. there will be some oil residue when you're done."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"That can be cleaned up with soap and water and you are essentially haveperformed bio-decontamination.\"This week, more positive lab results on the nano bomb solution's effectivenessagainst anthrax spores and other microbes were confirmed at a major university.Now, Ted Annis and Dr. Baker hope that within two weeks their NanoBio Corp.will receive federal funding to do final larger scale testing and ramp up for largeproduction beyond the laboratory.More Information:Bacillus anthracis, anthrax bacteria, can form stable sporesthat are resistant to harsh conditions and extreme temperatures.Photomicrograph courtesy University of Michigan.There are three categories of anthrax disease and none is infectious person-to-person:1) Cutaneous anthrax - bacteria or its spores (hibernating bacteria protected byhardened sheaths) naturally found in soil or on animals such as sheep get intocuts or scratches in skin and over two to six days spread into a pimple thatbecomes a blister that becomes a large, depressed black scab. The word anthraxis Greek for \"coal\" because of its blackness. With antibiotic treatment, cutaneousanthrax can be cured. Without treatment, the mortality rate can be 20%.2) Ingestion/gastrointestinal anthrax - bacteria form on spoiled, undercookedmeat which when eaten make people extremely ill and can cause death.Symptoms include nausea, abdominal pain, vomiting, low energy and bloodydiarrhea. Antibiotics can help if treatment is early in the disease. But mortalityrates are high because early diagnosis is difficult. To date, no cases ofgastrointestinal anthrax have been reported in the U. S.3) Inhalation anthrax - dry anthrax spores can be breathed deep into the lungs.If enough - approximately 8,000 to 10,000 spores - are inhaled, the sporesgerminate into anthracis bacteria. First symptoms are like a flu with fever, drycough and chest pain anywhere from six to 45 days after exposure. The maturingbacteria produce lethal toxins that spread into the bloodstream and causesystemic shock and collapse of body systems resulting in death. Inhalationanthrax death rate exceeds 90%.Facts about Anthrax from the Center for Disease Control:\"Anthrax is an acute infectious disease caused by the spore-formingbacterium Bacillus anthracis. Anthrax most commonly occurs inhoofed mammals and can also infect humans."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Symptoms of disease vary depending on how the disease wascontracted, but usually occur within 7 days after exposure. Theserious forms of human anthrax are inhalation anthrax, cutaneousanthrax,and intestinal anthrax.Initial symptoms of inhalation anthrax infection may resemble acommon cold. After several days, the symptoms may progress tosevere breathing problems and shock. Inhalation anthrax is oftenfatal.The intestinal disease form of anthrax may follow the consumption ofcontaminated food and is characterized by an acute inflammation ofthe intestinal tract. Initial signs of nausea, loss of appetite,vomiting, and fever are followed by abdominal pain, vomiting ofblood, and severe diarrhea.Direct person-to-person spread of anthrax is extremely unlikely, if itoccurs at all. Therefore, there is no need to immunize or treatcontacts of persons ill with anthrax, such as household contacts,friends, orcoworkers, unless they also were also exposed to the same source ofinfection.In persons exposed to anthrax, infection can be prevented withantibiotic treatment.Early antibiotic treatment of anthrax is essential - delay lessenschances for survival. Anthrax usually is susceptible to penicillin,doxycycline, and fluoroquinolones.An anthrax vaccine also can prevent infection. Vaccination againstanthrax is not recommended for the general public to prevent diseaseand is not available.\"We b s it e s :http://www.nanobio.com/http://nano.med.umich.edu/http://www.bt.cdc.gov/Agent/Anthrax/Anthrax.aspCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
