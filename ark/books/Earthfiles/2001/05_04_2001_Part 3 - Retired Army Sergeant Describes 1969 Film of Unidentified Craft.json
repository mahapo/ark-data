Stone, U. S. Army (Retired), Roswell, New Mexico:Disc with Small Cupola On Top and Larger Cupola On BottomTHE FIRST UNIDENTIFIED CRAFT YOU REMEMBER IS?The first one I remember, and I may have them out of sequence, but I believe itto be the disc-shaped UFO with a cupola on top and a cupola on the bottomthat is three times thicker than the one that is on top.WHAT HAPPENED TO THIS? IS IT MOVING IN THE AIR? ON THEGROUND?It's moving in the air.Disc with Cupola On Top As Thick Or Thicker Than DiscFirst of two disk photographs taken on May 11, 1950 at 7:30 PM by Paul Trent ofMcMinnville, Oregon. Physicist Bruce Maccabee, commercial photographers and theanalyst forthe Condon Committee at the University of Colorado, 1966-1968, studied the negativesand prints andconcluded the photographs were genuine. See: Earthfiles.com 06/19/00, \"The UFO/FBIConnection, Part 2.\"Photograph © 1950 by Paul Trent.WHAT WAS THE NEXT CRAFT?The next craft was circular in shape. Had a cupola on top that was about twicethe size of the thickness of the saucer itself.AND WAS THIS IN COLOR OR BLACK AND WHITE?Black and white also.CLOUDS?Not that I can recall. That doesn't mean clouds weren't there.MOVING?We got the impression it was moving.IN THE BLACK AND WHITE FILM, HOW DID ITS COLORCOMPARE TO THE CIGAR?Once again, it was a little shinier. Like you would have a gray tone in the B&W.But it was shinier. Also, it was reflecting on the lead portion - you could catchglimpses every now and then of what I would say would be the sun.Cigar ShapeThen you go ahead and fade from that and go to a typical cigar-shaped UFOwhich the cigar-shaped UFO had no appendages, wings or anything of this sort. Idon't remember any windows on it. There was a smoke trail.IN BOTH OF THESE, ARE YOU SEEING THESE IN COLOR?The saucer was in color. The cigar-shaped is in B&W.WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE DISC IN THE COLOR FILM?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"About the color of lead and shiny surface.A SHINY LEAD?It was reflective, but not like shiny aluminum.NOT LIKE SHINY ALUMINUM, BUT LIKE SHINY LEAD?That would be the best way to put it.WHAT DO YOU KNOW THAT IS MADE OUT OF SHINY LEAD?Nothing that I can recall right now, except that this had a reflective surface, aglitter to it is the best way to put it, but it was like a lead color, like the lead of apencil.OH, I SEE, MUCH DARKER.Ye s .A LEAD PENCIL COLOR, BUT SEEMING TO HAVINGGLITTERINESS TO IT INSTEAD OF SHINY REFLECTION?Right. It would reflect sunlight.IN THAT DISC, DID YOU SEE ANYTHING THAT WOULDRESEMBLE PORTHOLES OR WINDOWS?Solid structure. No portholes. Here again, it was in flight. Did not see anyopenings.DID IT SEEM TO BE MOVING AT A RAPID RATE ON THE FILM?It seemed to be moving at a rapid rate. It's hard to explain. It seemed to bemoving - the camera seemed to be moving. There was a clear blue background.You could not see no clouds or anything of that sort. You had the impressionthat it was moving fast. You didn't see no turbulent of air or anything of thatsort. I can't even tell you if there were any portions on the craft that were evenmoving itself, like something like going around the craft. There were no lights. Ido remember that.WHEN YOU GO TO THE CIGAR IN THE B& W FILM, IS ITSTATIONARY OR MOVING?I would have to say it was moving also, but it was not easy to make out anydetail on it.IN TERMS OF THAT COLOR IN COMPARISON TO THE LEADPENCIL?Being black and white, it was kind of grayish on the B& W film. That does notmean it was gray, but this one had like a surface a whole lot shinier than whatthe colored disc would appear.WERE THERE ANY CLOUDS OR ANYTHING TO INDICATE?There were clouds, but they were off in the distance.DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF THE SIZE OF THE CIGAR?No, and at that time we weren't really thinking it was a UFO film.\"Shoe Heel\" CraftTHEN WHAT WAS THE NEXT CRAFT?The next craft after that was the heel-shaped craft. The heel shape craft wasembedded in the earth. Like the heel of a shoe."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Unidentified \"shoe heel\"-shaped aerial object photographed on July 9, 1947 by William A.Rhodes of Phoenix,Arizona with a box camera. He was at his home when he heard a whooshing sound, got hiscamera and took twophotographs of the object he estimated to be at 1,000 feet. Photograph © 1947 by WilliamA. Rhodes.Once again, don't remember any trees, but you didn't get to see a whole lot offilm footage of that. It could have been like the deserts we have right aroundhere. There were several little entities lying around in that film footage. Butagain, that was only a couple of seconds. You couldn't make out much detail.WAS THERE ANY WAY TO ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF THE SHOEHEEL?The shoe heel I would say was 35 or 40 feet if it was a complete circle.FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW, IS THIS SIMILAR TO THE CRAFTTHAT YOU WERE INVOLVED WITH THE CRASH RETRIEVAL INPENNSYLVANIA AND THE KEWPER I'VE TALKED WITH YOUABOUT AND FRANK KAUFMANN, THAT TYPE WE USED IN THEFRANKLIN MINT DESIGN?Yes, the one in the Franklin Mint is more like the heel shape. (See: December14, 1999 Earthfiles.com Report, Real X-Files Section.)Artist composite rendering of three eyewitness drawings of \"craft of unknown origin\"associated withRoswell, New Mexico © 1999 by Tim Bauer.WERE YOU SEEING THE HEEL SHAPE STICKING IN THE GROUNDWITH BODIES IN COLOR OR B&W?Black and white.COULD YOU COMPARE THE COLOR AND TEXTURE OF THE HEELTO THE OTHER THREE IN ANY WAY?I can tell you on that particular film that the object would have been like a highpolish.VERY SHINY.Very, very shiny."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"COULD YOU SEE ANY DETAILS ABOUT THE ENTITIES AROUNDIT?No, you saw some which I have to be careful with what I say here, because Icould be getting it wrong. But I would say like your typical Grey, like what'sbeen reported by Whitley Strieber and other people who have been abducted.IS THAT DIFFERENT FROM THE PEAR-SHAPED HEAD?Yes, it is.THIS IS YET ANOTHER TYPE?This is another type. But here again, we didn't get to see them that long. Thefocal point was on the craft. And it was secondary to seeing the bodies. Whenyou start seeing the bodies, they are now fading into the crescent-shaped UFO.Crescent ShapeIt immediately went from there to what we call to what I call the crescent shape.WHEN YOU USED THE WORD 'CRESCENT,' I THINK OF ACRESCENT MOON.Very similar to like what Kenneth Arnold drew what he saw.Page 162 in photo section of book, The Coming of the Saucers based on descriptionof Idaho pilot, Kenneth Arnold, after watching nine crescent-shaped aerial objects on June24, 1947 fly\"like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water,\"© 1952 by Ray Palmer and Kenneth Arnold.THE CRESCENT-SHAPED UFO, IS THAT COLOR FILM OR B&W?The crescent-shaped UFO is in color. There are clouds and it's moving at a fastclip.WHAT COLOR DID IT SEEM TO BE?It seemed to be a shiny aluminum, but not as shiny as the crescent shape.HOW EXACTLY DIFFERENT IS IT FROM THE HEEL SHAPE, THISCRESCENT?The crescent craft is about the shape of like a crescent roll.THAT YOU WOULD EAT.That you would eat. Not as definitive as a crescent moon. Very smooth surface.DID IT HAVE THAT SWALLOW TAIL DEPICTED IN ONE OFKENNETH ARNOLD'S DRAWINGS, OR WAS THAT AN ARTIFACTADDED BY THE ARTIST? I HEARD THAT IT WAS ADDED.Added by the artist. This had no aerodynamic characteristics or features such asstabilizer or aileron or anything like that. It was just a smooth craft. If we wereto make something like that, we would have to put helium in it because it wouldbe a balloon or dirigible.BECAUSE THERE WAS NO TAIL OR AILERONS OR WINGS ORANYTHING - IT JUST LOOKED LIKE A CRESCENT IN THE AIR.Correct, a controlled surface. Now this did have right in the center of the craft adark area that I could, I got the impression were windows of a cockpit area."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THE CRESCENT IS DIFFERENT FROM THE HEEL OF THE SHOECRAFT?It's different in that the 'wings' would be long like a crescent roll.WHEREAS THE HEEL OF THE SHOE IS MORE LIKE A SOLIDHORSE SHOE?Correct.IT WAS THE CRESCENT PART THAT CURVED.They would be much larger. This would be a much larger craft.THE CRESCENT IS BIGGER THAN THE SHOE HEEL?The crescent is bigger than the shoe heel. I would say it fit the dimensions of anF-94C.WAS THERE ANYTHING IN THE FILM THAT GAVE YOU THATIMPRESSION?Why do you think I mentioned an F-94C?WAS IT IN THE SAME FRAME?It was in the same frame.SO YOU ARE LOOKING AT A F-94C THAT IS BEING FILMEDCHASING THE CRESCENT?Comes up and flies along side of it. Then goes higher than what the crescent is.The crescent-shaped craft would be 6 or 7 times bigger than the F-94C. When itstarts to go up, the crescent-shaped UFO is pulling away from the F-94. The(crescent) drops into frame from above, almost gets parallel to (the jet), but thenthe F-94 pulls up, but as it is pulling up you can see that the crescent-shapedobject is accelerating and pulling away.WHAT HAPPENS? DOES THE FILM CONTINUING FOLLOWINGTHE CRAFT?Once this happens, the film is complete. The film is shut off. The lights go ondown in the auditorium. The guy I told you was talking with the pointer, hecomes ahead. Hits the podium with the pointer. At that time, we now know wehave people behind us.Intensive DebriefingTHEY RUSH YOU OUT THE DOOR INTO A VAN AND WHATHAPPENS?They take us into the van. Once they put us into the van, they are letting usknow that what we did was terrible and we were in a whole lot of trouble. Thenthey take us to a wooded area. Remember, the van is a panelled van and we haveno windows. It is totally dark back there in the back. There is a light but it ispurposely turned off and has the bulb missing. They take us to this one storybuilding that is an old wooden frame building that they used to use as officesduring the second World War. They put us in a room that has one lamp in it thatmight have a 15 watt bulb. And we tried to figure out what we had done thatwas so criminal and why were we being treated like criminals. If it was soclassified, why didn't they have some kind of security system there?We still thought we were seeing trailers of science fiction movies and had noidea that these people I now know that what these people were being shown wasactual film footage that was taken by the military. (In the briefing), they wereshowing what if you come up to something like this because there was apossibility that at some time during their career, they might actually beconfronted with something like that.What I didn't know was that as a result of this, of the intensified briefing thatfollowed, the airman got out on the evening of the third day after the intensifieddebriefing. For me it would not be until the evening of the 5th day."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THEY HAD YOU THERE FOR FIVE DAYS?You'll take water because you need that. But, Linda, you'd take sleep overeating.THEY WERE BASICALLY TRYING TO BEAT YOU DOWN ANDBRAINWASH YOU?They were breaking you down for a reason. We went there on a Monday. I gotback to my quarters on a Friday late evening. The only thing I wanted to do wasget some sleep. Well, during the intensified debriefing in the room, you wouldhave two guys that would ask you the same question over and over and over andover again. You had one guy with a clipboard that sat over in the corner. Neveruttered a word. He would make notes on the clipboard. I think about it now andremember he used a pencil, not a pen.YOU THINK HE USED THE PENCIL BECAUSE?He was taking notes on our responses. I think what he was doing was more alongthe lines of a psychologist rating our answers. I think he was using the pencilbecause he was rating us and upgrading or downgrading depending upon ourresponses and our reactions to the questions being asked.HE HAD TO ERASE?He had to erase and I know he erased from time to time because I tried to keepmy eyes on him trying to figure out who was in charge here.\"More Information:UFOs Are Real, Extraterrestrial Encounters Documented by the U.S. Government© 1997 by Sergeant Clifford E.
