Onthe southern edge of the thicket is a town called Sourlake. That's wherejournalist, Rob Riggs, spent his childhood and heard stories of the hairy \"wildman\" that had been seen in the Big Thicket woods. In the 1990s, Rob Riggspublished the Lake Travis View newspaper in Austin and the Fort Bend Sun inSugarland, Texas.Before then, he had written for various southeast Texas newspapers, includingthe Kountz News back in 1979. That year, he started investigating the famousghost lights on Bragg Road in western Hardin County and asked readers to sendhim any unusual experiences they had had in the woods. He was surprised whenletters started arriving about wild men seen with mysterious lights. That set himoff on two decades of research now published this year in an excellent bookentitled, In the Big Thicket, On the Trail of the Wild Man."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Rob Riggs holding his book at 2001 Texas Bigfoot Conferencein Jefferson, Texas north of the Big Thicket National Preserve.Photograph © 2001 by Andy Abercrombie.Yellow area shows Sourlake north of Beaumont where Rob Riggs grew upand heard local stories about the \"wild men\" in the Big Thicket woods nearby.Interview:Rob Riggs, Publisher and Author, Austin, Texas: \"The first story I got fromone of my readers was a lady named Sharon Votaw and she was a resident ofthat area and had lived there all of her life. She told a story of a group of highschool kids and they used to go out and do what they called \"booger hunting.\"That meant they would go out in the woods and try to scare each other. Well, onone of their trips, they used to go to this cemetery where there was a statue of anangel in one of the mausoleums and they would go there just to try to spookeach other out and talk to the angel.One time they went there and heard this ruckus in the maintenance shed of thecemetery, looked up and there was this huge, apelike creature. They made theirretreat, but they were curious enough because they couldn't believe what theywere seeing. So, they came back and there it was again. They made three tripsand brought in more and more people, all of whom saw the thing.I got another report from another individual who asked not to be named whosaw the Wild Man on the Ghost Road itself. It actually appeared on the GhostRoad right after they had seen the ghost light. The thing jumped on the hood oftheir pickup howling. It was a couple and the gentleman involved happened tohave his deer rifle with him and just unloaded right through the windshield andthe thing went howling off in the woods and left claw marks on the hood of the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"pickup. There have been a number of instances where these things have actuallyjumped on cars. Apparently the creatures in the Big Thicket are capable of beinghostile, aggressive.WHAT ABOUT TRANSFORMATION IN AND OUT OF LIGHTS?OCCASIONALLY IN MY OWN INVESTIGATIONS, THERE HAVEBEEN REPORTS OF PEOPLE, A RANCHER REPORTED TO THECASCADE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE THAT HE WAS OUTHUNTING AND ENCOUNTERED AN 8 FOOT TALL REDDISHBROWN HAIRY PRIMATE STANDING UP, SHOT AT IT WITH ARIFLE AND IT 'DISAPPEARED IN A FLASH OF LIGHT,' ASWRITTEN IN THE SHERIFF'S OFFENSE REPORT.Well, Linda, I got more responses of people having seen the creature on BraggRoad and this was some 20 years ago when I began this investigation. I gotstories just like what you are describing. At the time, I could not believe them. Ithought these people are putting me on. I had a story of some people who sawthe light on Bragg Road and they said there was a carload of them and theywould swear on a stack of Bibles that they saw that light turn into the WildMan.A map shown at Texas Bigfoot Conference, Jefferson, Texas, on September 15, 2001.Black dots indicate Bigfoot reports. Photograph © 2001 by Andy Abercrombie.Since that time and since my book has been published, I go there frequently. Myhome town is in that area. I have interviewed other witnesses who have had whatwere frightening experiences. A truck load of kids from Newton, Texas which isa small town in southeast Texas said that they were on the road, they were all intheir vehicles, they saw the light and as it was approaching them, what theydescribed as a black shadow of a human being came out of the light. And theywere visibly shaken by it. And they said what terrified them is that it was like asolid shadow of a person without the person being there.Now, it's interesting if you go just across the border from southeast Texas intosouthwestern Louisiana, the Cajun people have a very established folklore thatalso associates the appearance of the hairy humanoids with lights. They call thehumanoids the loup garoux (werewolf) and they call the lights the \"fifolet.\"(French feu foulais, or \"compressed fire.\") And the Cajun folklore whichoverlaps somewhat with the voodoo traditions, there are stories of lightstransforming itself into the loup garoux. So the folklore of people who havelived in those swamps for centuries and until only recently very isolated fromthe outside world, very much corresponds with the experiences of witnesses onthe Ghost Road.IF SOMETHING TRANSFORMS IN AND OUT OF LIGHTS, HOW CANIT BE STRICTLY BIOLOGICAL?Well, that's a good question. Now, I want to say something. I have photographsof some of these lights. I do not have a photograph of a light becoming a WildMan or Sasquatch. I read your book recently, Mysterious Lights and CropCircles. And noted with interest that a number of photographs that weresubmitted to you from people you have interviewed had lights that showed up"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"on the photographs that were not visible at the time they took the photographs.And among those were what you call the translucent orbs and the mysteriousmist-like photographs. Well, on the back cover of my book is a photograph ofwhat we call a luminous mist that my colleague, Bill Fleming and I took onJanuary 20, 1996. A luminous mist very similar to what I saw in the photographsin your book showed up on film. It was never visible to us. We took thephotograph in pitch darkness without a flash and the fog thing showed up on thefilm.Luminous mist with hidden face photographed on Bragg Road,January 20, 1996 © by Rob Riggs and Bill Fleming.Now, what it looks like is apparently these lights can be just outside the visiblelight range. And at other times, through whatever frequency shift or whatever,they enter the visible light range. I have had a number of people describe havingseen the lights on the Ghost Road that were similar to what our photographshowed. And the way it was described is as a small fog bank with a bright spotin it. And that's what is shown on the back cover of my book.I also have had witnesses say that they saw the fog bank with the bright spot in itand the fog bank would collapse into the bright spot forming a distinct brilliantsphere about 6 to 10 inches wide. That is the typical description of the lightwhen it is visible and many people have seen it in that phase. So apparently thelights can go through different phases of manifestation.The reason I'm bringing this up is that I have numerous photographs of areaswhere there had been alleged Bigfoot or Wild Man in the big thicket where Ihave gone and taken photographs and the lights were not visible and yet theywould show up on film similar to the pictures in your book.And just as these spheres can sometimes be invisible or visible, apparently thecreatures can do the same thing. How that works is a mechanism we don'tunderstand. To me, one of the most interesting things about this wholephenomenon is what it suggests about mechanisms of human perception. Why isit that these lights can be right in front of our face and we can't see them? Arethey outside the visible range? Or are we somehow psychologically not allowingourselves to see them?I THINK IT DOES MAKE A GREAT DEAL OF SENSE THAT WE SEE AVERY NARROW RANGE IN THE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUMAND THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT RESEARCH IN CROPCIRCLES OR THE NON-HUMAN CATEGORY OR THE SASQUATCHCATEGORY CONSISTENTLY BRINGS UP IS THAT OTHER THINGSARE OPERATING OUTSIDE OUR ABILITY TO SEE WITH OURRETINAS AND THAT THIS PLANET, IF WE COULD SEE IN THESE"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"OTHER FREQUENCY RANGES, MIGHT BE MUCH MORE FULL OFACTIVITY THAN ANY OF US GUESS.I absolutely agree. Absolutely agree and to me that is the profound significanceof the Bigfoot and Wild Man research. It's not just whether or not these animalsexist, but some how the mode of their existence implies a much deeper,profounder, richer experience of nature than we imagine. There are wholedimensions of reality right at our fingertips, so to speak, that we might not beconscious of, but that we might be able to have some kind of conscious accessto.THE CONFUSION AND THE MYSTERY IS WHY IS THERE SO MUCHPHYSICAL EVIDENCE IN TRACKS, EVEN HAIR, AND THEREMARKABLE SIGHTING IN THE LATE 1960S THAT DR.BINDERNAGEL HAS DESCRIBED OF THE LOGGER WATCHINGTHE THREE UPRIGHT PRIMATE HUMAN-LIKE SASQUATCHDIGGING DOWN FOR THOSE HIBERNATING GROUND SQUIRRELSTO EAT - THAT IS SUCH A PHYSICAL PRESENCE AS WE WOULDUNDERSTAND ANIMALS AROUND US AND OURSELVES.

THEY ARE BOTH THERE IN AVERY ODD, CONFUSING MIX.Well, that's right. And for that reason, a lot of people don't want to look at theassociation with the lights because they think it reduces the Bigfoot to the typeof paranormal phenomena that don't lead objective existence. But to my mindthat is a very interesting situation because you do have the physical evidence andyou do have these aspects of the paranormal as if it were some type of bridgebetween the subjective and objective world. And to me, that's what is reallyinteresting. That is the profound significance of these and of my interest in thesephenomena.\"Bigfoot track cast by Rick Noll of Washington State on display at2001 Texas Bigfoot Conference, Jefferson, Texas.
