Charles Mallett, CFPR Field Report,Gog & Magog Hills, Cambridgeshire July 25, 2001:\"Gog and Magog Hills have once again been chosen to receive arather simple, but incredibly stunning crop circle event, this time ofsuch majestic beauty and harmonious proportion that, for this writer,it's set far apart from the bulk of the English crop formations in 2001....(It is made of) two chunky crescents and a standing circle of wheatpositioned within a flattened circle. Seventy-five thin paths ofdowned crop slice through the largest crescents with dramatic effect.From an aerial perspective this formation must be considered,without doubt, one of the finest of the season.75 thin \"rays\" radiate from the ring around the thick crescent.Photograph © 2001 by Charles Mallett.\"All the standing sections are placed within the outer circle with aprecision that is beyond reproach. Throughout the whole formationthat razor sharp look is consistent to the degree of obsessiveperfection.The floor construction is also extremely fluid and neat,very bouncy."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Upper crescent from which the 75 thin rays emanate.Photograph © 2001 by Charles Mallett.\"At several locations within the laid crop areas there were poppyflowers in full bloom, standing out of the laid down stems of wheat,giving the whole formation a delicate yin flavor. This is interestingwhen one considers how fragile these flowers are, surely anymechanical device would have caused these plants huge trauma. Tome it seems as if the agency involved in the creation of the real cropformations can be so effective and so subtle at their high craft thatthey can, with no problem, skirt around small flowers and otherplants without causing any damage whatsoever.Poppy untouched by the force that created the Gog Magog Hillsformation discovered July 25, 2001.

Each oneis approximately six inches wide and it looked as if they had been putdown in the crop with great care and softness. The way this maturewheat was laid is also rather interesting. Down the length of each ofthe paths the crop has been whipped up from one side, it looked as ifa small tube-wave had gone through, leaving the wheat gentlybrushed up one side of the wall of standing crop. This effect isconsistent throughout all seventy-five avenues."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Top of crescents.

When I measured the July 25th formation's diameter, the tapepulled tight at exactly 237 feet. The amazing labyrinth within theJuly 11 huge ring measured exactly the same, 237 feet diameter. ...Ileft the formation in no doubt that the same circle making agency wasresponsible for the 666 feet ring, the maze and the square templeformation over the hill.\"Gog Magog Hills formation discovered on July 25, 2001.Aerial photograph © 2001 by Andrew King.http://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.uk"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
