S. Fish and Wildlife -Dead Atlantic brant geese collected for lab studies by U. S. Fish and Wildlife Serviceat Forsythe National Wildlife Refuge, Oceanville, New Jersey. Photo courtesy USFWS.February 18, 2001 New York City - Increasing carbon dioxide and othergreenhouse gases in the earth's atmosphere ARE raising the global average meantemperature, physicists say, and 100 nations have ratified the Kyoto Protocolthat requires a cutback in emissions. But none of those nations are industrial likethe United States, which is responsible for 25% of the world's atmosphericpollution. So far the U. S. refuses to ratify the Kyoto Protocol becauseAmerican industry argues it cannot afford the economic costs of complying withemission cutbacks. This week the United Nations agreed to delay greenhousetalks until June or July, hoping for American involvement. But this delay furtherfrustrates environmental groups who argue that President Bush was quick tocreate a high-level team to develop new sources of oil and other fossil fuels thatwill put even more CO2 into the atmosphere, while ignoring the consequencesof burning fossil fuels.While this tension about global climate change continues to fester, the U. N.'sEnvironment Program also announced that global warming is melting theArctic's permafrost, causing it to release even more greenhouse gases that canfurther raise global temperatures. For thousands of years, Arctic soil remainedpermanently frozen and dead vegetation decomposed very slowly, keeping CO2release to a minimum. But now the melting permafrost is not only releasingpreviously trapped gases, and is also causing serious damage to buildings, roads,pipelines and other structures in Alaska and Siberia and is threatening theexistence of reindeer and polar bears.Next month, the U. N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"includes hundreds of scientists, will suggest one practical step to reducinggreenhouse gas emissions. That would be for all nations to protect existingforests and to plant lots of trees which breathe in carbon dioxide and breath outoxygen. But while scientists appeal to the world to stop cutting trees and plantmore, Portugal just announced a huge tree cutting project and the rainforests ofBrazil and Malaysia continue to disappear at an alarming rate. Trees are alsobeing cut down rapidly in China's Sichuan province, the only home of about1000 giant pandas left on earth. In the past 12 years, 30% of forest areas werecleared for logging and agriculture, forcing the bamboo-eating pandas intosmaller and smaller ranges. Is extinction next?Pacific North WestMelting ice and permafrost might also be related to climate change and lack ofrainfall in the northwest. Mt. Hood in Oregon has only half its normal snowdepth. Snow pack is so low in Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming and partsof California and British Columbia that government officials already warn ofpre-drought conditions. Hydroelectric plants need lots of snowpack water tokeep producing sufficient electricity in summer months for energy-starved statessuch as California. So, when air conditioners next turn on, there could be morerolling brown outs on the West Coast.Then there are the mysterious die offs of animal species that raise red flags aboutwhole ecosystems threatened like dominoes to collapsing environmentalconditions that no one fully understands.Great LakesOne die off is happening in the Great Lakes. What is disappearing at a rapid rateare tiny shrimp-like crustaceans called diporeia. These have been a primarysource of food for young fish, but now there are none in Lake Erie and the littleshrimp are disappearing fast from Lakes Michigan, Ontario and Huron. Onetheory behind the die off is that zebra mussels got into the Great Lakes from shipballast water and are competing too aggressively with the same food needed bythe diporeia. Eventually even the trout and salmon could decline from adwindling food chain.Oceanville, New JerseyAnother mystery is the die off of Atlantic brant geese at the Edwin B. ForsytheWildlife Refuge near Atlantic City, New Jersey. Wildlife experts built dikes andlevies to hold fresh water in large impoundments safe from the ocean's saltwater.Scientists worldwide consider the Forsythe wetlands to be of internationalimportance because so many birds go there for food during migrations. One ofthose species is Atlantic brant geese. Their total world population is only about150,000 and they basically live on two plants: eel grass and sea lettuce. Sowhen 2000 or more suddenly died in November and January, wild life officialswere shocked and puzzled. The sanctuary is where at least 80% of the Atlanticbrant geese winter each year for food and protection. Yet ironically, that's wherethey began to die, and were still dying three weeks ago - and still no one knowswhy.This week I talked with Tracy Casselman, Deputy Project Leader for the U. S.Fish and Wildlife Service at the Forsythe Refuge in Oceanville, New Jersey."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Atlantic brant male goose courtesy feathersie@cyborganic.net.Interview:Tracy Casselman, Deputy Project Leader for the U. S. Fish and WildlifeService at the Edwin B. Forsythe Wildlife Refuge, Oceanville, New Jersey:\"We didn't find any birds north of us, a few south of us, but everything seemedto be concentrated right around the impoundment.WHICH IS IRONIC BECAUSE THE IMPOUNDMENT WAS DESIGNEDSPECIFICALLY TO PROTECT THE BIRDS AND PROVIDE FEEDFOR THEM.Right. And when you are a manager of a facility like this and you spend a wholeyear to get the impoundment in shape for birds that migrate and they come downand start dying, it really takes you aback. It's really a strong impact when you arespending day after day picking up dead birds out of this impoundment thatshould have healthy feeding birds.SYMPTOMS?What I've seen with these birds is that when they get sick, they seem to isolatethemselves from the flock probably because they can't keep up or perhapsbecause they can't handle the pecking order. They tend to swim off bythemselves which brant do not do. They are a very gregarious species this timeof year. But these (sick) birds isolate themselves. They swim around and towardsthe end of their life, they may swim in circles. They may swim up against thebank and just paddle in place like they are trying to go somewhere, but the bankis stopping them. Sometimes they flap their wings. Sometimes they will floptheir heads from side to side. And then they just usually seem to slump over.THERE IS DISORIENTATION?There definitely seems to be disorientation and loss of muscle coordination.Definitely.IT SUGGESTS THAT SOMETHING IS AFFECTING THE BRAIN ANDNERVOUS SYSTEM?Right. That's correct.HOW DO YOU INVESTIGATE TO FIND OUT WHAT IS CAUSINGTHE SYMPTOMS?When you see a large number of one species drop very quickly, the first thingthat comes to most peoples' mind is that they got into some type of pesticidewhen they were feeding that really knocked them off. We tested for the commonpesticide applied to lawns and fields and we found no signs of that. We alsolooked at other things such as rodenticides and rat poisons and they came upwith nothing there."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"When the second outbreak occurred, they had already looked for the commonthings. We started spreading things out even thinner, collecting water samples,vegetation samples, mud samples. We started looking more at what we werefinding in the stomach channel of these birds and we were finding they weren'teating much which indicated to us that they weren't dying within a couple ofhours. It was something that was taking 6 to 8 hours, maybe up to 24-48 hours.These birds are also very healthy. They had good amounts of body fat. So it'snot something that is affecting them today and they are dying 2 weeks laterbecause they have good healthy fat reserves. If it was something that was taking2-3 weeks to process through their system, we would see a rapid loss of bodyfat.WHICH AGAIN FOCUSES ON THE REFUGE IN SOME FUNNY WAYTHAT WHATEVER THEY ARE EATING THERE OR WHATEVER ISTHERE, IF IT IS AN IMMEDIATE KIND OF IMPACT ON THEM, ITSEEMS IT'S HAPPENING AROUND THE REFUGE?Well, that's correct. And that's why we started looking at plant samples andwater samples and vegetation and mud samples in the areas where they werefeeding and where we were finding them dead.WHAT ABOUT INTERNAL ORGANS?Their internal organs were what we looked at initially when we suspected thingslike avian cholera. We were finding some hemorrhaging of blood vessels in theheart. We were finding little necroses in the liver. That's one of the things yousee with avian cholera, but we didn't see some of the other things we shouldhave seen. And when we tried to isolate the bacteria and culture it, we were notable to do it. If it had been avian cholera, there would have been thousandsupon thousands of bacteria in these birds and you would be able to culture veryeasily.COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT SEEMS TO ME A VERY ODDMYSTERY THAT ONLY THE BRANT GEESE SEEM TO BE DYINGAND YET YOU HAVE A REFUGE WITH ALL THESE OTHER BIRDS?If I could explain that I would probably be about 90% to the answer of why thebrant are dying. We don't know. We're starting to focus on what brant dodifferently than the rest of the waterfowl species. Where do they go that theother waterfowl don't go. What are they feeding on? What is happening to themthat doesn't happen to black ducks and Canadian geese and mallards andpintails and green wing teal and shovelers? There is some overlap in where thesebirds go and where they feed. And that is the biggest mystery. In talking with Dr.Kimberly Miller who is the disease specialist from the Madison lab that isworking with us on this and all the other folks, they can't remember ever seeinga situation like this where we've just had one species die, especially in this largea number.Occasionally, you see 20 or 30 birds die all of one species, but when you see2000 die and you're only looking at one species, that is a big part of the mystery.I think if I knew the answer to that I would probably have the key to solving thewhole thing. And we don't. So we focused more on what they are feeding onand where they've been, what they are doing, to try to key in on this. To this daywe have not been successful.COULD THERE BE ANY LINK TO GLOBAL WARMING CHANGES?I think we're going to find out, if we ever find the answer to this, is that there isprobably more than one causative agent. The folks doing the histological andvirology are convinced that the birds are suffering from some type of infectiousdisease based on the hemorrhaging of the heart, some of the thinning of theblood vessels and some of the things they are seeing. But that alone doesn'texplain the massive mortality and it doesn't explain why it isn't being passedfrom one water fowl species to another. So, my speculation is that we're going tofind more than one causative agent. And that's probably why we haven't been"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"able to pinpoint it now at this point. If it were one disease that was knockingthem back, I think we would probably have isolated it. It's possible that thesebirds have an infectious disease and something in the environment is just puttingthem over the edge. But we don't know. Why did it happen over Martin LutherKing weekend? Why did it seem to stop when it got cold in November and flareup again when we had the first 40 degree day? We don't know. These are allsmall pieces of the puzzle we are trying to assemble to come up with the bigpicture and hopefully the key as to the cause.IS ANYBODY AWARE OF ANY SPECIFIC DIE OFF OF BRANT GEESELIKE THIS SEPARATE FROM OTHER BIRD POPULATIONS AT ANYOTHER TIME IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY?No. No. We've even looked broader than the U. S. There are severalinternational websites where we posted information and we've gotten a little bitof feedback from the French that have seen some die offs of geese due to a virusand we passed that info along to the Madison lab virologist. But that was with adifferent species of geese and it seemed to cover more than one species at a timewhen they saw it.THIS IS A UNIQUE EXPERIENCE IN THE HISTORY OFORNITHOLOGY?You could say that. Unfortunately, it's not a positive unique experience.\"More Information:The sanctuary's impoundment water where most of the brant geese died isdominated by sea lettuce. So Tracy Casselman and his U. S. Fish and Wildlifecolleagues continue to sample the plants and water for signs of any unusualsubstances. Also, many laboratories are now involved, including the Madison,Wisconsin Wildlife Disease Lab, the Department of Agriculture, SoutheastCooperative Disease Control and the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration. All are trying to figure out what is killing the Atlantic brantgeese.If anyone finds a dead goose on the New Jersey coast, please call the ForsytheNational Wildlife Refuge at 609-652-1665.We b s it e s :http://www.greatnorthern.net/~dye/featured.htmlhttp://www.fws.gov/http://www.usgs.gov/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
