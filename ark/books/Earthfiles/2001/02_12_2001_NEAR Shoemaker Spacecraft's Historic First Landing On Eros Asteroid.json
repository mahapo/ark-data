So NASA announced that NEAR's work on the asteroid will beextended for up to 10 more days to gather more science data, around February22.One of the project scienctists is Lucy McFadden, a geologist and Professor ofAstronomy at the University of Maryland. I talked with her about the historicEros landing.Interview:Lucy McFadden, Ph.D., Associate Scientist and Professor of Astronomy,Department of Astronomy, Univ. of Maryland, College Park, MD: \"Theengineers and navigation team here at APL did receive communications from thespacecraft. They did get information which allowed them to assess the healthand state of the spacecraft and we weren't expecting that, so it was all veryexciting.Then the Mission Director, the person responsible for driving the spacecraft, gotexcited and said, 'Wouldn't it be great if we could launch again from the asteroidand look back at where we landed?!' But his engineers did an assessment fromthe telemetry packet which has information about the spacecraft in it and theydetermined they only have about 1 kilogram of fuel which is not enough to doanything. So, basically we're sitting there.Meanwhile, the other team leaders said, 'Wait a minute! We're sitting here righton the surface and we can detect gamma rays.' That's the natural radiation fromthe soil surface itself and maybe we can make some measurements if weintegrate it for a week, turned our gamma ray spectrometer back on and integrateit for a week, we would get an improved signal and get a very good measurementfor this part of the soil.WHAT WILL THE GAMMA RAY INFORMATION TELL YOU?Tell us about the elemental composition of the soil.FROM THAT WHAT COULD YOU LEARN?I'm particularly interested in that because I've been analyzing reflected sunlightin the near infrared which gives us signatures of metal, minerals, which are theminerals in the rocks. If we can get the abundance of the element of iron, forexample, that will constrain our analysis. The iron has to exist in a certain state"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"and it allows us to determine whether all of the iron is in the crystal structure Imeasure in the near infrared spectrum or whether some of it is metallic iron,which I don't measure in the mineral spectrum. And that's a very important pieceof information. Whether it's all in the mineral structures, or whether some of it isin the metallic state.IF YOU CAN REFINE WHAT THE MINERALS ARE ON THESURFACE OF EROS, WHAT WILL THAT TELL YOU ABOUT THEBIGGER PICTURE?The composition of the minerals, there is a reflection of the processing that hasgone on on the surface, whether it's material that condensed at the early time ofthe solar system or whether it has been partially heated or heated since itformed. So, the knowledge of the minerals and the distribution of metallic ironor iron in other minerals tells us whether Eros is primitive and has beenunaltered since it formed at the beginning of the solar system, or whether it mayhave experienced some subsequent heating in its course through the solarsystem.We don't have any evidence that there's been a melting like a volcano. Some ofmy team mates are starting to model mechanisms that would move some of thedust and fill in the craters. We see a lot of filled in craters. But there's aquestion. Are these deep craters filled in with a lot of stuff? Or are they flatcraters that aren't very deep that don't have much stuff in them?We're trying to figure out how this material moves around on the surface - howparts of Eros are smooth, filled in. We're actually calling them 'ponds.' Theyseem to be filled in and smooth. But when you get up there, there are rocks allover the place.WHY ARE THERE SO MANY MORE ROCKS PER SQUARE AREATHAN EVEN THE MOON?That's another question we're trying to quantify. That's our first assumption, orour first sense when we look at it. But you know what? We have to actually sitthere and count the rocks per square area and compare it to the rock count onthe moon. Before we spend a lot of time trying to explain the difference, we'restill getting our facts straight.WHAT ABOUT THE MYSTERIOUS SQUARE LOOKING CRATERSTHAT SEEM TO BE REGULARLY SPACED OUT. I'VE STUDIED ONEOF THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS AND THAT REALLY IS PECULIAR.Yes, but there's also one of those on earth - a meteor crater that's actually squareand that's because of the structure of the bedrock around it. It controls the cratershape so it just means we are impacting into something that has some strength toit.ANY IDEA WHAT THAT MIGHT BE AT THIS POINT?Nope! (laughs)BUT YOU'RE STILL LEFT WITH A MYSTERY ABOUT WHY THEREARE THESE UNUSUAL SMOOTH AREAS ON EROS, RIGHT?I think our mystery is what's the distribution of the boulders and the craters? Arethere small craters? Is there an absence of small craters? We've looked all overEros and there's been a lot of activity. We've gotten down to things that areinches across and so it doesn't look smooth anymore. There's always rocks andboulders there. It's pretty rough. There are places that are relatively smoother,but that's inside one of the larger features. We're debating whether it's a crater ornot. We think it's a crater.IS THAT THAT SORT OF CRADLE-SHAPED PLACE WHERE YOULANDED?Right. That area is now called Himeros.THAT IS VERY UNUSUAL TO LOOK AT IN THE AERIALPHOTOGRAPH."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Right, and from a larger distance it looks relatively smoother. But when we getdown there and we landed in that area, it's still very rough. There's a lot ofdebris spread out all over the asteroid.\"We b s it e s :http://near.jhuapl.edu/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
