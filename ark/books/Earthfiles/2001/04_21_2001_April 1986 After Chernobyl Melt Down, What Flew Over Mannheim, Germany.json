Mannheim, Germany housed about 60,000 American military at thetime,including a National Security Agency unit that passed out all the secret military codes. Notfar awaywere the huge American Ramstein AFB in Kaiserslautern and Rhein-main AFB inFrankfurt.April 21, 2001 El Paso, Texas - Sergio Arellano was born in El Paso fiftyyears ago, graduated from high school there and then joined the U. S. Armywhere he earned a degree in transportation. By the end of April 1986 - and afterthe awful nuclear melt down at a Chernobyl, Russia power plant on April 26,1986 - Sergio was a Master Sergeant in Mannheim, Germany working in the28th Transportation Battalion. In 1996, he retired from the Army and returnedto his hometown to work for a commercial trucking company.As we near the 15th anniversary of the Chernobyl nuclear reactor melt down,Sergio remembers how the Mannheim base was put on restrictions to lessenexposure to dangerous radioactivity spreading over Europe. No physical exerciseoutdoors. Stay away from the contaminated Rhine River. Cut down vehicleactivity to reduce radioactive dust in the air. Don't eat or drink food and wateroff the base. Eat only American canned foods or in the base commissary. Don'tbuy local produce. Keep pets indoors.Sergio particularly remembers one of those early mornings around 7 a.m. whenhe had reported for duty without the normal 6 a.m. run. He was at the TruckMaster's Dispatch Office in the Motor Pool that overlooked downtownMannheim. The sun was shining and the sky was blue. Some 30 soldiers wereoutside the office waiting for their orders from Sergio and half a dozen of hiscolleagues inside the office. Suddenly people began yelling and pointing at thesky."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Interview:Sergio Arellano, Retired Master Sergeant (1996), U. S. Army, El Paso,Te xa s : \"What we saw was a big old ship of some type, an aircraft. Well, it didn'treally resemble an aircraft. It looked like one of those old German helmets. Ithad the shape of a German helmet or modern Army helmet. And it was flyingpretty low, maybe between 5,000 and 6,000 feet. And it was going maybe at100 knots, based on the fact that we parachute a lot and that's about the heightthat a helicopter flies when we parachute out of it. And it was going not too fast.The colors were sort of yellow. It had some green on it, dull green. Blue. And itlooked like a liquid and a solid material at the same time. And it didn't seemsolid. It looked more liquid like mercury, like when you grab a piece of mercuryand move it in your hand and you stab it with little things. It just looked liquidyand solid at the same time. It had a streamer on the back that it would get biggerand smaller, but it was a constant stream.Helmet-shaped aerial craft traveling silently south to north over Mannheim, Germany U. S.ArmySpanelli Barracks at 7 a.m. on a morning in late April 1986. Sergio estimated the size to befive stories high,150 feet wide and somewhere between 300 to 500 feet long. The craft moved slowly injerky motions trailing materialbehind that had the same dull, mustard-yellow and blue-green mixed with light brown andaqua turquoise colors.Sergio thought the craft's appearance seemed almost like liquid, or like the soft metalmercury. Three small, white objectsflew at high speed from three different directions and merged with the craft at the sametime.Drawing © 2001 by Sergio Arellano.DID IT HAVE A COLOR?It was the same color as the object which was the same color and it would getlong, get smaller and go out. And the craft seemed like it was hesitating, likestalling. It was not an even, fluid flight. It was like moving sort of slow like whenyou let a clutch out too quick on a car and it sort of jerks forward.HOW BIG DO YOU THINK THIS WAS?Well, based on what we all decided it was, it was about the average size of oneof our barracks. Our barracks were five stories high and maybe about 300 to 500feet long.THIS WAS PRETTY BIG.It was a big thing and the sun was hitting it. We had a clear view and besides us,on the battalion parade field, the battalion was having a formation. So maybe90% of the battalion was present.HOW MANY PEOPLE WOULD THAT BE?That would be maybe 1500 men and women.IF YOU ADD THOSE 1500 AND ABOUT 100 OF YOU UP WHERE YOUWERE, YOU'RE GETTING UP TO ABOUT 1600 PEOPLE IN THAT"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"ONE AREA WHO WOULD HAVE HAD A CHANCE TO SEE THISOBJECT?Oh, yes, because immediately after that formation and when everybody gatheredtogether, that was the topic of conversation in the dining facility and everywhereelse. We all saw it.WHAT DID YOUR SUPERIORS SAY THAT THEY THOUGHT THISOBJECT SHAPED LIKE A MILITARY HELMET THAT SEEMED TOBE BOTH LIQUID AND SOLID WITH THESE ODD COLORS OFGREENS AND SO FORTH, 5 STORIES HIGH, COUPLE OF HUNDREDFEET LONG, WHAT DID THEY SAY IT WAS?Well, nobody seemed to know. Everyone was saying it was a UFO because noone knew what it was. I mean, it was just shocking that it would fly right overour military area. And our military area in Germany there, we had 5 or 6 bigbarracks which is one of the largest concentrations of soldiers in Germany. Someof it is a No Fly Area. We contacted the Intelligent Section of our battalion tolet them know to report a craft flying over us to see if anyone knew what it wasbecause it was not supposed to be flying on top of us.WHAT WAS THEIR RESPONSE?By 6 o'clock that evening, the official report was that there was no such craft butwas maybe space debris that had come down and fell on earth.ARE YOU SAYING THAT BY EVENING FROM THE MORNING THATTHE OFFICIAL EXPLANATION FROM THE MILITARY WAS THATTHIS WAS SOME KIND OF SPACE DEBRIS?That's exactly what they reported. They also reported on the Stars and Stripesthe following day. But earlier at noon, they had reported it was a UFO and thatit came in from The Netherlands towards Germany and that they had sentinterceptors from The Netherlands. Now, we sit between two air bases, one inFrankfurt and one in Kaiserslautern, and both are like the biggest air bases inEurope: Ramstein AFB and Rhein-main AFB. So it was shocking to us that wedidn't see aircraft chasing it. It took a long time. We observed it for maybe 10 or15 minutes. It took a long time to pass over us and go over Mannheim and kepton going.SOMETHING THAT WAS THAT BIG AND WOULD TAKE 10 TO 15MINUTES THAT YOU WOULD ALL WATCH, 1600 OF YOU, THAT'SNOT SPACE DEBRIS, IS IT?No. Space debris. We as military personnel have seen a lot of shooting stars andmeteorites that travel because most of our training was at night.THEY TRAVEL FAST.Sure! We see a lot of it and a lot in the early dawn. Those things are fast andhave a lot of light. This was dark in color. As it was going over us, there werethree little white lights of some type, but they weren't like bright lights. Theywere just dull white objects. All three came from different directions and theysort of merged into this thing and went right into it without any doors opening oranything, just like they came in and swooped right into it and that wassomething we all discussed and we all saw it. When we saw those things comingat it, we all said, 'What the heck was that?' It just went right in it.TELL ME MORE ABOUT THOSE WHITE OBJECTS.They looked like little baseballs. They were white. I want to say they wereglowing, white lights, they were just white like very clean baseballs. And onecame in from the east and they all came in more or less at the same time. Andone came in from the southwest and the other came out of the north towards thesouth. And they all sort of merged into this thing. They went right into it andbecame one with the big ship there.DID THEY ALL SEEM TO MERGE AT THE SAME PLACE?No, they came in at different places. They came in at three separate angles, or atthree separate directions and they all went right into it. They didn't slow downor nothing. They were coming in at a pretty fast rate of speed and went right intoit. We all saw it. At first we thought maybe something was shooting at this thing"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"because of all the military bases. So, we said, 'It looks like someone shot at thisthing.' But no, it was no shot. These things came in and went right into it. Thecraft didn't stop. It didn't slow down. It just like swallowed these things up andkept on going.DID ANY OF YOUR SUPERIOR OFFICERS TALK WITH ANY OFYOU OFF THE RECORD ABOUT HAVING ANY OTHERKNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHAT THIS UNIDENTIFIED CRAFT MIGHTBE AND WAS THE TERM EXTRATERRESTRIAL EVER USED?We were all sure because the Commander also witnessed it we were sure it wassomething we had never seen and it was a craft of some kind, or object of sometype, being self-propelled. But no, nobody asked nobody. No one evermentioned it. And the word was, that was that and it was the end of the story.MEANING THAT IT WAS JUST 'SPACE DEBRIS?'Yes, that it was space debris and that was the end of the story. After that, no onementioned it because being in the military, if you keep on harping on something,all of a sudden doors start closing on you.SO YOU KNEW, ALL OF YOU AND THAT'S A LOT OF GUYS - ATLEAST 1500 TO 1600 RIGHT THERE AT MANNHEIM - THAT THISWAS SOME KIND OF A COVER UP, RIGHT?Well, we knew exactly that was it. And we talked about it all that night becauseeveryone sort of hangs around. There's only one bowling alley, one NCO club,one PX, one commissary. So everybody was talking about it and how silly theywere by saying it was space debris when in fact we all saw it.\"SEEKING MORE EYEWITNESSESIf anyone reading this report from Sergio Arellano was also in Mannheim theend of April 1986 and who might be able to add their own eyewitness accounts,please contact me at Earthfiles@earthfiles.com.More Information:Another unidentified aerial craft of a similar shape but not as big - andseemingly tipped vertically on a side compared to Sergio Arellano's horizontal\"helmet\" - was photographed on April 2, 1966 above the Melbourne, Australiasuburb of Balwyn. The polaroid photograph below was taken a few minutesafter 2 p.m. by a businessman from his garden.
