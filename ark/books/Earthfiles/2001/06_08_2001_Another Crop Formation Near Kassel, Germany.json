Photographs © 2001 by Frank Laumen.More Information:The Kassel, Germany area has been a repeated focus of the crop formationphenomenon each May since 1998. In addition to this June 1 formation, onSunday, May 13 at 7:30 a.m. a farmer found a complicated pattern in yellowflowering oilseed rape not far from Kassel, Germany in the farming communityof Zierenberg. (See: May 19, 2001 Earthfiles news report.)The farmer told researcher and photographer Frank Laumen that he \"wassurprised to have found no signs of a human footprint on the soil and the plantswere pretty wet in the morning. It would have been impossible not to causesuspicious footprints, but there were none.\"For my book Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles, (Earthfiles Shop) I askedMichael Hesemann, publisher of Magazine 2000 in Duesseldorf, Germany,author of The Cosmic Connection, and long time student of ancient historiesand religions why Kassel would play a pivotal geographic role in Germany, asAvebury and Silbury Hill have in England. He responded with the followingletter:Michael Hesemann Letter to Earthfiles:\"In my opinion, it is no coincidence at all that Kassel became theGerman center for crop circle activities. It is indeed, next toKarlsruhe and Schleswig-Holstein (which are the other areas withfrequent circles in our country), the land which comes closest to thesacred landscape design of the sanctuaries of Avebury andStonehenge.\"Kassel is also the birthplace of Rosicrucianism in the 17th Centuryand the center of Masonic activities in the 18th Century. In 1614, theKassel printer Wilhelm Wessel published two books which becamethe 'Bibles' of Rosicrucianism: the anonymous General Reformation"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"of the Whole World and the famous Fama Fraternitatis or theDiscovery of the Commendable Order of the Rose Cross. It waswritten by Johann Valentin Andreae, son of a Lutheran priest withthe reputation of being an alchemist, born and living near Tuebingenin Wuerttemberg.\"One year later, Andreae published his second book ConfessioFraternitatis or Confessuin of the Commendable Brotherhood ofthe Venerable Rose Cross, Addressed to the Intellectuals of Europe,again in Kassel. The fact that Andreae spent all his life inWuerttemberg, but published his books in Kassel/Hessen indicatesthat there was indeed a secret society already active at that timewhich coordinated the publication. With a very high probability,Andreae's friend, Rudolf August von Braunschweig-Wolfenbuettel,was another member of this Rosicrucian order. Its center of activitiesat that time was obviously already the city of Kassel.\"Mentioned for the first time in 913, Kassel obtained its town-rightsby the end of the 12th Century when it became seat of a Germanchapter of the Knight Templars. Since 1277, it is the residence of theCounts of Hessen. At that time until 1848, Germany consisted ofover a hundred independent states or counties ruled by Counts,Barons, Princes and Kings, united within the Holy Roman Empire ofthe German nation. In 1527, Hessen introduced the LutheranReformation as one of the first German states. The Counts of Hessenwere proud of their French ancestry, sharing with the Kings of Francea remote descent from Pippin, the Short, the father of Charlemagne.\"In 1717, the very year in which Freemasonry went public for thefirst time with the foundation of the Great Lodge of England inLondon, the Count of Hessen-Kassel, one of the first GermanFreemasons, completely changed the design of his residential city,Kassel. With the help of Italian architects, he designed it as 'the cityof man,' a model of the human energy body with its seven chakras.For this, he erected a network of fountains and monuments along astraight line, the city's new axis, ending on top of a mountain. There,he erected an octagonal structure corresponding with the eight-petaled lotus of the Buddhist model of the Kundalini, crowned by astructure which is half obelisk and half pyramid, with a bronze statueof Hercules on top: the God-Man of the Greek/Roman mythologyleaning on his club. Hercules stands for the perfect man. Seen frombelow, the whole structure resembles a Tibetan stupa. At his feet inthe octagon, Count Hessen-Kassel placed the defeated GiantEncelados, symbol for the ungodly 'old man.'\"Interestingly, Carl of Hessen-Kassel, who ruled from 1767 on,became one of the closest friends and disciples of the mysteriousalchemist, Comte du Saint Germain. Although Hessen preferred toreside in Gottorf near Schleswig, the capital of his land was Kassel.He hosted Saint Germain in the nearby castle of Louisenlund, wherehe allegedly died in 1784. In 1774, Carl of Hessen-Kassel wasreceived as a Freemason in the lodge at Schleswig. In 1782, heorganized the first national conference of Freemasons inWilhelmsbad near Kassel.\"In conclusion, I can say that Kassel was Germany's most importantcenter for Rosicrucianism with a ruling family deeply involved inalchemy, freemasonry and sacred landscape design. There is a directconnection between these ancient crafts and occult sciences andancient Egypt as there is one between the stone temple of Aveburywith its Silbury Hill pyramid and the land of the Pharaohs. Therefore,it does not seem to be a coincidence that right here in Kassel thecircle makers focused their enigmatic activity.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"We b s it e s :http://www.franklaumen.de/http://invisiblecircle.de/http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/http://www.cropcircleresearch.com/http://www.dcca.nl/http://www.swirlednews.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
