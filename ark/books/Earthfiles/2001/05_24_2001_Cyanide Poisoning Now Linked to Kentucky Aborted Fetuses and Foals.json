The main suspectfor the cyanide source remains the Eastern Tent Caterpillar combined with thecyanide in wild cherry tree leaves containing more cyanide than normal becauseof the freeze after record high temperatures in mid-April. Still unknown isexactly how the caterpillar cyanide gets into the pregnant mares. While scientistsbegin more tests on pasture grasses, Lexington horse breeders are going to cutdown wild cherry trees near their pastures and spray the Tent Caterpillar mothsbefore they lay eggs that would hatch next spring.May 23, 2001 Lexington, Kentucky - The University of Kentucky LivestockDisease Diagnostic Center reported today that since April 28th, the total numberaborted fetuses and foals examined in its laboratory has climbed to 532. Theseunexplained deaths of first trimester and third trimester unborn foals areunprecedented in the history of horse raising anywhere in the world.Last week several experts thought the answer was mycotoxins - poisonousresidues left by fungi and molds on grasses. Scientists thought that thecombination of very hot weather in the first two weeks of April followed by twodays of freezing temperatures stressed the grasses so much that the parasiticmolds and fungi took over and concentrated toxins that the horses ate.But this week laboratory results were negative for mycotoxins. So now the focushas shifted to the lowly Eastern Tent caterpillars and the wild black cherry treesthey live upon each spring. Tent caterpillars make silken tents to live in whilethey feed on their host trees."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Hundreds of Eastern Tent Caterpillar larvae live together in \"tent webs\" spun fromsilken threads produced by the insects. These collective nests are homes to the caterpillarsfrom 4 to 6 weeks before the cocoon and moth stages.Photograph courtesy University of Kentucky College of Agriculture.There were so many caterpillars in Kentucky this year that whole cherry trees onfarms were stripped bare. Wild cherry trees are known to have cyanide in theirleaves. If the trees are stressed while protecting themselves from wildlyfluctuating temperatures as occurred in April, the leaves will produce even morecyanide. The Tent caterpillars can eat the leaves without getting poisoned andcarry the cyanide in their own guts for awhile. Scientists now wonder if thepregnant mares might have eaten some of the many caterpillars moving inpastures? Or eaten a cyanide residue on the grass as the insects moved from treeto tree?Today, I talked with two men involved in the Kentucky investigation. One is anentomologist who has studied the Eastern Tent caterpillar. The other is an experton horse nutrition. First, Dr. Lee Townsend, Extension Entomologist in theCollege of Agriculture at the University of Kentucky in Lexington. I asked Dr.Townsend if horses have ever been known to eat caterpillars?Interview:Lee Townsend, Ph.D., Extension Entomologist, College of Agriculture,University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky: \"That's a good question. Notthat I know of. Tent caterpillars are pretty hairy and active and you would thinkthat horses would be leery of them.AS AN ENTOMOLOGIST, IS THERE ANY REFERENCE ANYWHEREIN ANY LITERATURE IN THE WORLD OF THESE KINDS OFCATERPILLARS EMITTING ENOUGH CYANIDE ON GRASS THATTHEY HAVE KILLED OTHER ANIMALS OR CAUSED CYCLES OFINTENSE ABORTED FETUSES?There is nothing that I'm aware of that points to that. There is some informationin the literature on a completely different caterpillar in a completely differentpart of the world whereby when it feeds on particular grasses, the response ofthe plants is to increase the protective chemicals in the leaf. Subsequently,animals that graze on this grass can become ill. But in terms of depositinganything on the leaves, there is not anything that I have seen in the literatureabout it and specifically with the Eastern Tent Caterpillar, the information thatis available in terms of cyanide and the protective chemicals that are associatedwith the caterpillar are limited to the gut content as it's feeding on the foliage.IF THE CATERPILLAR/TREE CONNECTION ACTUALLY HADSOMETHING TO DO WITH ALL THE ABORTED FETUSES ANDUNBORN FOALS, THEN IT SEEMS FROM WHAT YOU ARE SAYINGTHAT YOU WOULD HAVE SEEN THAT LAST YEAR AND THE YEARBEFORE WHEN YOU HAD INTENSE NUMBERS THEN AS WELL?That is correct. The complicating factor to this is the early spring weatherpattern of 2001 with that early warming and then the freeze which potentially"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"can effect plant chemistry with the wild cherry and some of the pasture grassesas well. While the caterpillar numbers are roughly the same or somewhatequivalent, the environmental conditions between the two years are different. Itlooks as if whatever the cause of this particular syndrome is, it seems to beassociated with a particular set of circumstances that all came into place at theright time.IF THERE HAS EVER BEEN A WORRY ABOUT CYANIDE INCHERRY TREES, WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD KENTUCKYTHOROUGHBRED FARM RAISERS HAVE SO MANY CHERRYTREES ON THEM TO BEGIN WITH?That is a good question. Many of those trees I suspect are outside the fence lineof the farm. Most trees on farms and pastures that I've seen have been fenced offso the animals don't have direct access to the trees and foliage themselves.THAT EVEN REDUCES FURTHER THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANYDIRECT CONTACT BETWEEN THE HORSES AND THECATERPILLARS.It does, except for the wandering activity of the caterpillars when they are forcedto leave trees or when they naturally leave them. The opportunity is there. Thequestion is: did that actually take place and that's a tougher link to establish.IT SEEMS LIKE A BIG LEAP.It is a big leap. Yeah. So that's what this team of people will be looking at andalso consider that the picture could change. Results from other tests could openup other avenues to follow.\" Why Aren't the Mothers Affected?ANOTHER QUESTION RELATES TO THE HEALTH OF THE MARES. IFCYANIDE POISONING KILLED THE UNBORN FETUSES AND FOALS,WHY WEREN'T THE MOTHERS AFFECTED? THAT QUESTION ALSOPUZZLES ONE OF LEXINGTON'S WELL KNOWN HORSE NUTRITIONEXPERTS, STEPHEN JACKSON, PRESIDENT OF THE BLUE GRASSEQUINE NUTRITION CENTER IN VERSAILLES, KENTUCKY ANDGRADUATE OF BOTH TEXAS A& M AND THE UNIVERSITY OFKENTUCKY. I ASKED HIM IF IT'S TRUE THAT SO FAR THERE HAVEBEEN NO REPORTS OF MAJOR HEALTH PROBLEMS WITH THE MARES.Stephen Jackson, Ph.D., President, Blue Grass Equine Nutrition,Versailles, Kentucky: \"That's correct. And although there were some instancesof pericarditis and other problems in yearlings and other classes of horses, thegeneral population of horses did not seem to be affected. Nor do cattle, at thispoint, seem to be affected. If you operate under the theory that caterpillarscould be involved, then you have to come back and titrate a dose of cyanide thatwould be adequate to cause hypoxia in the developing fetus, but inadequate tocause severe signs in the mare.WOULDN'T THAT IMPLY THAT SOME HOW THE HORSES WOULDHAVE TO BE EATING THE CATERPILLARS?Exactly. And that's the big stretch right now. Being a nutritionist, that's what mymajor field is, I've watched horses graze and eat for hours and a horse can spitout a pebble. If you put a pebble in their feed trough with 5 pounds of feed,when you look after they are through eating, that pebble will be there sitting onthe bottom of the trough. They are just very selective about what they ingest. So,it was inconceivable to me - and still is somewhat inconceivable that a danghorse would eat a caterpillar! You know, a bird won't. And the caterpillars dohave high levels of cyanide in their gut and that is their natural protectionmechanism. So, it's still somewhat of a reach to get the cyanide into the horseand then to titrate the dose of cyanide that it would take to make the fetalinjuries. But there are lots and lots of dead ends here and there is a highcorrelation between the presence of these defoliated cherry trees and the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"incidence of problems on farms. And several farms in fact where they've had noproblems and they've had no cherry trees. And no caterpillars. So there is a lotof circumstantial evidence that would indict the caterpillars, but it's going to beawhile before people can put all the pieces together, if they fit, to sayconclusively that it is either cyanide or some sort of metabolite or precursor ofcyanide that is causing the problems in these mares.BUT DID YOU FIND ANY ELEVATED LEVELS OF CYANIDE IN ANYOF THE ANALYZED FETAL ABORTED FOALS?That's again... cyanide is very labile. It turns gaseous. Hydrogen cyanide is asmall molecule. At this point, there has been no cyanide per se found, but whatwe have to look at now is not cyanide itself, but enzymes in the liver tissue ofsome of the animals that were posted that could indicate the cyanide was there.And that's what the people in the veterinary science department are doing now.BUT IT STILL IS A MYSTERY.It is very much a mystery. Luckily, we appear to be out of the woods in terms ofthe early fetal losses and late term losses and more mares that were bred laterare ultrasounding still pregnant than in the past.The problem with the diagnostic laboratory numbers is that the late term lossesare fairly accurate in terms of establishing how many foals are dying in centralKentucky, because most of those late term foals that die would be submitted forautopsy or necropsy. But the early term pregnancies, I would suspect that lessthan 5% of those early fetal losses would be submitted for necropsy because alot of times you can't find them. These are tiny little embryos and you go in andultrasound the mare and see the embryo is in trouble, there is a lot of echogenicflocculent material on the screen, on the ultrasound, and then you come backand it's gone. So it's not like you can harvest that embryo. It's only in a few caseswhere they look at the mares they can see a discharge and fetal membrane. Butvery few of the early embryonic deaths are actually going into the diagnosticlaboratory because you can't find them at that stage.WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT THE NUMBER OF 520 OR SOCOULD EVEN BE MUCH GREATER?Oh, there is no doubt in my mind that the number of 500 doesn't represent 10%.That 500 number is extremely misleading. I have clients that have lost 80 to100% of the early embryos, the early breedings they have had from Februarybred mares. I know one owner who had 72 mares bred in February and 72 mareshave slipped. And they have submitted probably 4 of the early embryonic lossfetuses to the diagnostic laboratory.WHAT KIND OF IMPACT ARE YOU GOING TO SEE NEXT YEARFROM THESE LOSSES AND WHAT HAPPENS IN 2002 TO 2003?Well, I think that is somewhat up to conjecture. It is a huge economic loss.Estimates have been from 200 to 250 million dollars and I think that is probablysmall.THE ASSOCIATED PRESS ARTICLE ON MAY 22ND SAID,'ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT KENTUCKY'S $1.2 BILLIONTHOROUGHBRED INDUSTRY COULD SEE A 30-40% REDUCTIONIN THE NUMBER OF HORSES BORN IN 2002 AND THE LOSSES OFHUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OVER THE NEXTSEVERAL YEARS.'And that's not even considering the trickle down effect. I know farms that belongto friends of mine that have already laid off half of their staff because mares haveleft the state and they don't have any work for them to do. That probably doesn'taccount for the labor and economic effect on labor or the effect on feedcompanies that will sell less feed, or for agents fees that are going to sell fewerhorses and collect fewer commissions. The trickle down effect is really huge.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"We b s it e s :http://www.ca.uky.edu/Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
