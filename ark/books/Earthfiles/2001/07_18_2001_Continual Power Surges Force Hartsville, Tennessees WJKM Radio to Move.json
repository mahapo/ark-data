July 18, 2001 Hartsville, Tennessee Today I learned from Ted Randall thatdead birds with burned wings were found all over Hartsville's city park, adiameter of at least a mile. In fact, in the afternoon of that same day, powersurges and dimming lights were reported at an insurance company more than amile from WJKM. This afternoon, I talked with Ted Randall and Dave Fluehe,owner of Dave's Covert Surveillance in Hartsville who provides electroniccamera and video security monitoring equipment to businesses. On July 6 in theafternoon, Dave Fluehe was in an insurance company more than a mile awayfrom WJKM when more electronic interference occurred.Interviews:Dave Fluehe, Owner, Dave's Covert Surveillance (electronic camera andvideo security monitoring for businesses), Hartsville, Tennessee: \"The onlything I noticed was that the lights dimmed once and the computers kind offlickered. And I said, 'What in the world was that?!' to one of the girls in there.And she said, 'Oh, we've been having this problem all day!' I don't really knowwhat time that was, probably some time in the late afternoon when thishappened. She mentioned something about the electrician had been out hereonce and while I was there, the electrician had come in and looked at thebreaker box.THIS INSURANCE COMPANY IS HOW FAR FROM THE RADIOSTATION AND NEWSPAPER?Maybe a mile and a half.DID ANY COMPUTER EQUIPMENT GO OUT?No, it wasn't smoke. Nothing there was smoked. There was a real groaningsound like Ted had described. It was a ZZZZZZ sound.THERE WAS A MORNING IMPACT OUT THERE AS THERE HADBEEN AT THE NEWSPAPER AND RADIO STATION IN THE CENTEROF THE TOWN. AND THEN YOU ARE THERE IN THE AFTERNOONAND EXPERIENCING FIRSTHAND LIGHTS FLICKER."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I'm also hearing what the electrician had to say. They couldn't figure it out, itbaffled the heck out of them.TED, WHY DO YOU THINK THE GROUNDING EFFORTS YOU HAVEDONE ARE NOT WORKING?Ted Randall, Chief Engineer, WJKM-AM, Hartsville, Tennessee: \"I believethe grounding at the station and elsewhere - the grounding was burned in two.We have a static drain choke on the tower. We also have the lighting choke.DID IT BURN THOSE UP?No. I believe a lot of the energy entered through the antenna system, but it's notjust a cut and dried thing. In other words, you're not just dealing with -everything is properly grounded. Dave will account for that.Dave: Yeah, it is. Everything is grounded and grounded and grounded andbypassed and grounded some more. So, it's not a lack of a ground.I don't think so either. It was also suggested by a physicist that it was probably alightning strike that would do this. I've dealt with lightning over and over again,putting stations back on the air and repairing all sorts of damage from lightningand I've seen dead animals around tower sites.BUT THERE WAS NO LIGHTNING ON FRIDAY.They were talking about clear day, clear sky lightning, a phenomenon that takesplace. But even then, these birds were from one end of city park to the otherwhich is...AT LEAST A MILE IN DIAMETER.Right.One of the sixty some dead bird's burned wings after mysterious power surgehit WJKM and surrounding city park region in Hartsville, Tennessee at 10:45 a.m.on July 6, 2001. Photograph © 2001 by David Randall.Dave: I actually picked up one of the dead birds several days later - I wentdown there and did some investigating and it didn't look like a lot of the treesthat had been burned - it looked kind of like sunburn, is what it looked like. Itdidn't look like microwave radiation burns because I've done a lot ofexperimenting with that.IT DID NOT LOOK LIKE MICROWAVE?No, it did not look like microwave radiation. It looked like there could be apossibility of electrostatic discharge. When I looked at the bird, it looked like ithad been fried.TED, THIS MORNING AT 4 A.M. ON JULY 18, YOU HAD ANOTHERPOWER SURGE AT THE RADIO STATION THAT CAUSED MOREPROBLEMS?Te d : Right, and I'm very curious, Dave, did you lose power in Hartsville thismorning or no?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Dave: Yes, as a matter of fact I did and I called the sheriff's office on it. Itknocked out all my video cameras and I had to reset my clock. It was about 4 or4:30 in the morning when that happened. I called the sheriff's department andshe said it only went off for a couple of seconds. Over here, it went off for abouta minute.DID ANYBODY KNOW OF ANYTHING THAT OCCURRED AT 4 a.m.?No. The sheriff's department didn't know, either.Te d : And there was a gentleman from Tri County Power out at the station todaywho said they are replacing all the wires, all the feed to City Park. And he couldnot tell me why they were doing that. I asked him why the power went out thismorning at 4:30 a.m. and he didn't know anything about it.But we've made a decision that we are moving all the computers and everythingto Cedar Vine Manor because we can't continue this. This morning we lost acouple of network cards and we were down for a long period of time. And Dave,you know what it caused you with the cameras and what not.Dave: Oh, yeah!Te d : So, we've got to move. We've got to get it out of there so we can figure outwhat the problem is.THE BOTTOM LINE OF THIS IS THAT THERE WAS A DRAMATICSURGE ON JULY 6 THAT CAUSED SO MANY PROBLEMS, BUT YOUHAD BEEN HAVING THESE POWER SURGES BEFORE JULY 6.YOU'VE BEEN HAVING THEM SINCE JULY 6. FRANKLIN HADSOMETHING THAT FALLS IN THE CATEGORY OF SEISMICACTIVITY, WHATEVER THE SOURCE WAS. AND EVEN TODAY,JULY 18, YOU HAVE YET ANOTHER POWER SURGE THAT CAUSESEVEN MORE EQUIPMENT PROBLEMS AND YOU ARE GOING TOHAVE TO MOVE AND YET NO ONE HAS ANY ANSWERS TO THEPOWER SURGES BEFORE AND AFTER JULY 6.Maybe it's because we haven't asked the right questions or tickled the rightperson to get the right answers. Someone knows what is going on, and it wouldtake an astronomical amount of energy.\" A Cornell University Physicist CommentsToday I talked about the July 6th incident with Professor Michael Kelley,Electrical Engineer and Physicist at Cornell University who researches theEarth's ionosphere and was a consultant on the construction of the HAARPfacility in Gakona, Alaska built to transmit bursts of microwave energy at theionosphere in order to study it. Prof. Kelley looked at my Earthfiles.com newsreport about Hartsville while we were on the phone and this was his firstreaction:Prof. Michael Kelley, Electrical Engineer and Physicist, CornellUniversity, Ithaca, New York: \"I don't know. That's pretty mysterious.\"HOW MUCH ENERGY WOULD IT TAKE TO CAUSE ALL OF THEEFFECTS THAT WERE NOTICED IN BOTH OF THOSE BUILDINGS?About the only thing I can think of that would have that kind of energy densityis lightning. Not manmade, excluding nuclear weapons. That's a lot. That took alot of energy to do that. That would not be so easy to calculate that.SO, WHATEVER HAPPENED IN HARTSVILLE, TENNESSEE WAS ALOT OF ENERGY CONCENTRATED WHERE THOSE TWOBUILDINGS WERE?It looks like it to me.IN THE WORK YOU'VE DONE EXPLORING THE IONOSPHERICLAYER FROM ARECIBO AND OTHER PLACES, HAVE YOU EVER"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"BEEN CONSULTED OR INVOLVED WITH INFORMATION ABOUTWHAT THE PENTAGON MIGHT BE WORKING ON WITHELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE (EMP) WEAPONS?No more than you would by reading the paper.DO YOU KNOW OF ANYBODY WHO HAS EVEN EXPERIMENTEDIN A MILITARY WAY WITH PULSES OF ENERGY FROMSATELLITES OR PLANES?No, just to the extent that there are directed energy weapons programs and thoseare, I guess, thought to be related to space-based weapons. See, a lot of this stuffdoes not work unless it's in a vacuum. So, directed energy beams - they don't dogreat (in air), so they are sort of vacuum-related sorts of things. You could put alot of energy into something like that, but it's pretty hard to propagate it in athick atmosphere.Laser beams you could use because they are light and it goes through theatmosphere. This was not a laser beam.IT WOULDN'T BE A LASER BEAM BECAUSE?Well, laser beams, if they are going to be energy intensive, they've got to be tiny.And this obviously wasn't tiny. This covered a big area.THE LASER ITSELF COULDN'T BE USED TO TRANSMIT ANENORMOUS AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT COULD SORT OF BURSTOVER A WIDER AREA?No, the laser beam can carry its energy and the reason it's affective is that theenergy is focused in a very tiny place. That doesn't mean there is a lot of energythere. If you focus a joule of energy down into a few microns, it will burn a holethrough anything. But it's not going to have a huge effect except in that one littlespot. So, you have to be careful when you talk about energy density. There canbe high energy density, but almost no real energy.IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE WITNESS'S DESCRIPTIONS INTHE NEWSPAPER BUILDING AND THE RADIO STATION OFHEARING WHAT SOUNDED LIKE A POWER HUM SURGEFOLLOWED BY THE LIGHT AND THEN ANOTHER POWER SURGEFOLLOWED BY LIGHT AGAIN?The only thing it sounds like to me that I've heard is ball lightning. That's alocalized plasma ball that, God knows, how they form. It's a real mystery. It cansort of waft around eerily supporting itself by electromagnetic forces. It's a verymysterious thing to me, anyway. And I wouldn't be at all surprised if that made asound.WOULD IT CAUSE A FLASH OF LIGHT IN THE BUILDING AS THATWOMAN SAID - IT WAS LIKE SEEING A BLOCK OF LIGHT ON THEWALL OPPOSITE OF HER?That sounds more like a flash of lightning. Ball lightning, though, if it's movingaround, it could go in and out of your field of view and create that effect.WHAT WOULD PROVOKE THE FORMATION OF BALL LIGHTNINGON A CLEAR, SUNNY DAY?It's happened. It's rare, but sitting there with a lightning rod 400 feet in the airwhere all that power is - if it's ever going to happen, it would happen on a radiostation, I would think.ANY REASON WHY THE BIRDS' WINGS AS OPPOSED TO THEIRFEET, WHY THE BIRDS' WINGS WOULD BURN OFF?Well, you know like a lightning rod itself or any object that is pointed like thetip of a tree, anything that has any pointedness to it - when an electric field isaround it, it concentrates on that point. And you can imagine that these featherswould have that property. So, if this was some sort of discharge, then the tips ofthese wings would be more susceptible and the top of a radio tower. Becausethe energy is concentrated by the fact that there is a point.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Earthquake Hits Franklin, Tennessee Day After Power Surge in HartsvilleIn a further development, reporter Christy Overstreet at Channel 5 in Nashvilletold Ted Randall that on Saturday, July 7, - the day after the mysterious powersurge in Hartsville - an equally mysterious seismic disturbance was confirmed inFranklin, Tennessee about fifty miles from Hartsville:Christy Overstreet, Reporter, Channel 5, Nashville, Tennessee: \"Th eTennessee Valley Authority yesterday reported to the Tennessee EmergencyManagement Agency that there was indeed seismic activity in WilliamsonCounty on Saturday, July 7. Between 10 and 10:30 that night, hundreds ofpeople called authorities to report what they thought was either an earthquakeor an explosion. TVA reported that seismic activity registered 2.6 on the Richterscale with an epicenter 4 miles southeast of the city of Franklin. And ithappened at exactly 10:05 p.m.\" At least sixty birds were found dead with feathers burned and melted, scattered all overthe mile diameter city park on July 6, 2001 in Hartsville, Tennessee.
