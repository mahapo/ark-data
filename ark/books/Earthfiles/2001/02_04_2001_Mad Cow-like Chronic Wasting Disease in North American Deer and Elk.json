In a formal statement, FAO said: \"All countries which haveimported cattle or meat and bone meal from Western Europe, especially Britain,during and since the 1980s can be considered at risk from the disease.\"The disease is not caused by a virus or bacteria. It's caused by a normal proteinprion found in all mammals. But when that prion protein changes shape, itproduces Mad Cow Disease in cattle and a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakobdisease in humans which is 100% fatal. It's a fact that the destructive prionsfound in sick cattle in England, Ireland, and France match exactly thedestructive prions found in about 90 people who have contracted and died fromvariant-CJD in Europe. In both cattle and people, prions make sponge-like holesin brain and nerve tissue. The time between onset of first disorientationsymptoms and death is about six months to a year. But it's thought that peoplecan carry the destructive prion for several years before full blown symptomserupt. So if a person ate contaminated British beef in 1986, for example, he orshe might not get sick for ten or fifteen years, or longer. That's why healthofficials wonder if we're seeing the tip of an iceberg of cases yet to emerge. Andwhy the American Red Cross has banned blood donations from people wholived and traveled in Britain, France, Portugal or Ireland for six months or morebetween 1980 and 1996.Until 1996, medical researchers did not think prion disease could cross from onespecies to another. The very rare Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease first discovered inGermany in 1920 was thought to affect only people past fifty. So alarm bellswent off in 1996 when dozens of young people in England under age 30 wereconfirmed to have a new variant CJD disease that matched exactly the prions insick and dying cattle.Since 1996 in the United States, three young people under age 30 have alsocontracted CJD disease and died. However, the destructive prions in thoseAmerican victims did NOT match the variant CJD prions in European victims.That is one of the many confusing mysteries that now challenge prion"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"researchers around the globe.If destructive prions can move from infected cattle to humans in Europe, whynot in North America, South America and everywhere? That exact concernprompted Canada and the U. S. this week to announce a ban on several morebeef imports from Brazil even though, to date, no cases of Mad Cow Disease inBrazilian cattle have been confirmed.No Mad Cow Disease has been confirmed in North American cattle. The U. S.and Canada acted quickly back in 1986 to ban British meat and animal feedimports when mad cow disease first emerged in Great Britain. But there areanimals in North America that are suffering a very similar brain and nervedisease also caused by misshapen prions that wildlife specialists call \"ChronicWasting Disease,\" or CWD. Fifteen percent of wild deer and some elk in a hotspot between Ft. Collins, Colorado and the Wyoming border have the disease.Other cases have been reported in Nebraska and at breeding farms from NewEngland to Canada. Researchers wonder: Can CWD cross species from deer andelk to humans as mad cow did from cows to people in Europe? So far there is nolaboratory evidence that eating venison has caused a variant Creutzfeldt-Jakobdisease in humans. But no one yet knows how chronic wasting disease is eventransmitted among deer and elk.I talked this week with Todd Malmsbury at the Colorado Division of Wildlifeabout why northeastern Colorado might be the epicenter of chronic wastingdisease and what the symptoms are.Interview:Todd Malmsbury, Chief of Information, Colorado Division of Wildlife,Denver, Colorado: Todd Malmsbury, Chief of Information, ColoradoDivision of Wildlife, Denver, Colorado: \"Chronic wasting disease - theclinical symptoms of chronic wasting disease involve an animal in which itsbody condition is not in very good shape. It seems to have what we would callan almost 'spaced out' look. It can salivate excessively. Drink excessively.Stumble about. There is a glassy-eyed look to the eyes. The body conditionbecomes poor fairly quickly. And usually with a matter of weeks, or a fewmonths, after the onset of first symptoms the animal does die. It is an incurabledisease. If an animal does develop the symptoms, it does die from this disease.IT IS A MISSHAPEN PRION-BASED DISEASE EXACTLY LIKE THEPRION BASE IN MAD COW DISEASE AND CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB,BUT THE DIFFERENCE SO FAR IS THAT THE SHAPE OF THEPROTEIN IN CHRONIC WASTING DOES NOT MATCH WHAT HASBEEN FOUND IN THE THREE PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED OFCREUTZFELDT-JAKOB WHO ARE YOUNG. THEY DON'T MATCHUP, THE MISSHAPEN PROTEINS BETWEEN DEER AND PEOPLE.There have been no cases in the United States of the new variantCreutzveldt-Jakob disease which has been found in Britain and Ireland and onthe continent of Europe.WHY DO YOU THINK THAT 1967 AND FT. COLLINS IS SORT OFTHE BEGINNING AND EPICENTER DISCOVERY OF CHRONICWASTING DISEASE?Looking today at where the percentage of animals with the disease is highest, thelargest incidence of the disease, it would appear it might have started very closeto the Colorado-Wyoming border. But we'll probably know the answer to that.I'M READING FROM SOME INFORMATION ABOUT CHRONICWASTING DISEASE THAT WAS PUT OUT BY APPARENTLY OFSERIES FROM MONTANA, WYOMING, COLORADO, NEBRASKA,DIFFERENT WILD LIFE DIVISIONS. AND HERE IS A QUOTE: \"Thefirst case of chronic wasting disease was seen in 1967 in a captive mule"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"deer at the Foothills Wildlife Research Station operated by the ColoradoDepartment of Wildlife in Ft. Collins and was attributed then by stationemployees to close confinement of deer to former scrapie pastures or tohorizontal transmission from sheep allowed into the pens.\"WHAT WAS THE FOOTHILLS WILDLIFE RESEARCH STATIONDOING IN 1967?The same thing it does today. What it is is our research facility where we do alot of our different studies on deer, most of them involved with nutritional work.And for example, it's a place where we developed the specific food pellets thatare used in emergency times when we have severe winter weather. It's that typeof work that goes on routinely there and has for many years.IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE FOOTHILLS WILDLIFE RESEARCHSTATION IN FT. COLLINS MAY HAVE BEEN WORKING WITHGROUND UP BONE, GRISTLE, CARTILAGE FROM SHEEP, CATTLEAND SO FORTH AT THE TIME WHILE THEY WERE TRYING TOWORK UP A FOOD SUPPLEMENT?So far as I know, they were not working with any animal by-products fromdomestic wildlife. In fact, the supplements we use are from grain.THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CHANGE IN THE PROTEIN PRION INSHEEP, SOME ABERRANT FORM, THAT HAS BECOME THECHRONIC WASTING DISEASE PRION. BUT NO ONE YET HAS BEENABLE TO MAKE THAT KIND OF DIRECT LINK?There has been no direct link to our knowledge between scrapie and chronicwasting disease.IN TERMS OF THE STATISTICS THAT YOU HAVE IN COLORADOAND WYOMING - HAVE YOU FOUND THAT YOU HAVE CASES INANIMALS THAT EXTEND BEYOND THE DEER TO OTHERANIMALS YET THAT HAVE COME UP WITH CHRONIC WASTINGDISEASE?Bull elk in Colorado courtesy Colorado Division of Wildlife.No, the only animals we have seen with chronic wasting disease in Colorado inthe wild would be in deer and elk. Certainly in a laboratory setting where youare literally injecting the disease pathogen into the body of, into the brain of, atest animal there have been occasions where test animals have become infected.Specifically what we're looking at right now in conjunction with some otherstate and federal agencies and universities is a study in which we are trying tosee what sort of transmission there would be between deer that have CWD tocattle because clearly cattle are known to get bovine spongiform encephalopathy(BSE), or Mad Cow Disease.What we found to date after the 4th year of the studies and again, these arecooperative studies is that direct exposure of diseased deer to a healthy cow hasnot been found to spread the disease. They've even taken a pathogen andliterally put it right into the cow's mouth or into its eyes or nose and it has notcaused the spread of the disease. The only way they have been able to induce a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"chronic wasting disease-type ailment into cows is to literally take a syringecontaining the pathogen and inject it directly into the brain of the animal (cow).On several occasions after many tries, they have been able in that case to inducethe illness in cows. But even then, after they have done injections, the animal(cow) has not come up with the specific chronic wasting disease infection. So,the transmission appears to be extremely inefficient even when a healthy cow isin close proximity for an extended period of time with a diseased animal.ISN'T IT TRUE THAT DEER AND ELK FROM THE AREA OFCOLORADO AND WYOMING AND MAYBE NEBRASKA DO GETTRANSPORTED TO FARMS IN NEW ENGLAND AND OTHER PARTSOF THE COUNTRY THAT DO HAVE VENISON FARMS?There have been animals found in captive breeding farms for elk predominantlyin several states and in at least one Canadian province. It's possible that theorigination of chronic wasting disease in captive herds may have come from aherd in Colorado or Wyoming, but that is not known. It may be it came fromsomewhere else. But there is speculation that it did come from Colorado orWy o mi n g.WHAT ABOUT CHRIS MELANI? HE'S THE HUNTER IN THELONGMONT AND FT. COLLINS AREA OF COLORADO. CBSFOCUSED ON HIS EXPERIENCE. I'VE TALKED WITH HIMBRIEFLY. HERE'S AN EXAMPLE OF A HUNTER WHO WENTTHROUGH THE PROCESS OF TURNING IN THE HEAD TO THEWILDLIFE COMMISSION AND WAS TOLD THAT UNLESS HERECEIVED A WARNING THAT THERE WAS CWD IN THIS DEERTHAT HE HAD SHOT AND HE GOT A NOTICE WITHIN 3 WEEKS -THAT HE COULD GO AHEAD AND EAT THE MEAT, PROCESS IT.HE AND HIS FAMILY MADE SAUSAGE AND DISTRIBUTED IT ATCHRISTMAS. TWO MONTHS LATER HE RECEIVED THE FORMALLETTER CONFIRMING THE DEER DID HAVE CWD.The test was not completed as quickly as we had hoped it would be. The testwas completed. They did not, as far as I know, contact us to check on it. Theywent ahead and did process the animal.IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT ANY HUNTER HUNTING DEER AND ELKIN THE FT. COLLINS, WYOMING AND NEBRASKA AREA -WHATEVER THEY SHOOT IS NOT GUARANTEED TO BE HEALTHYUNTIL THEY HAVE A STATEMENT FROM LABORATORYANALYSIS?Anyone who hunts deer and elk in northeastern Colorado, particularly deer,should submit that head as we request and as we ask them to do in writing, andif they choose to - and we recommend that they do this - they should wait untilthey receive notice from us whether or not that animal has the disease. But weare already telling people and have told them for some time that they should noteat animals that are diseased, that the animals they kill - the head should besubmitted for testing and we will notify them. If they don't get an answerimmediately or want to check on it, they should give us a phone call.\"We b s it e s :http://www.dnr.state.co.us/wildlife/hunt/huntereducation/chronic.htmCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Republication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
