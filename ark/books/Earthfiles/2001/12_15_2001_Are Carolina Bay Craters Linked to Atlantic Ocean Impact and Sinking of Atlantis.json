(See: Earthfiles.com 5/18/01)\"It is stunning. What we see in our high-resolution sonar images are limitless,rolling, white sand plains and, in the middle of this beautiful white sand, thereare clear manmade large-size architectural designs. It looks like when you flyover an urban development in a plane and you see highways, tunnels andbuildings,\" Zelitsky said.Then in November, she and her husband and business partner, Paul Weinzweig,told me that in July they sent a Remote Operated Vehicle down to the site andvideotaped some large rock structures that appear to have an engraved symboland lettering resembling Greek, but not Greek. (See: Earthfiles.com 11/29/01)Nothing is confirmed until clear video images are presented which can bestudied by language experts and other scientists.But one word keeps coming up with a big question mark: Atlantis? Could theCuban deep underwater site have anything to do with a remnant of the fabledcivilization discussed by Plato?In 350 B. C., the famous Greek playwright, Plato, wrote a dialogue about thecreation of the universe and the earth called the Ti maeus. In that work, Platowrites about cyclic destructions on the earth from \"...the occurrence of a shiftingof the bodies in the heavens which move around the earth, and a destruction ofthe things on the earth by fierce fire, which recurs at long intervals.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Recently on Dreamland radio, I interviewed North Ireland astronomer, WilliamNapier, who has studied such a cycle in the Ecnencte's Comet which left a verythick, rocky, dusty debris field through which our solar system and planet passevery 2.5 thousand years. (See: Earthfiles 12/1/01. The last time was about twohundred years before the time of Christ, so we're expected to pass through therocks and dust again in a couple more centuries. Was that comet the cycle Platowas referring to? Or something else?Plato's Description of Atlantis LocationA few pages later in the Ti maeus, Plato describes an island continent calledAtlantis and its destruction this way:\"...in front of the mouth which Greeks call 'the pillars of Heracles' -today we call it the Straits of Gibraltar - there lay an island whichwas larger than Libya and Asia together; and it was possible for thetravelers of that time to cross from it to the other islands, and fromthe islands to the whole of the continent over against them whichencompasses that veritable ocean, (the Atlantic). ...Now in this islandof Atlantis there existed a confederation of kings, of great andmarvelous power, which held sway over all the island, and over manyother islands also and parts of the continent; and, moreover, of thelands here within the Straits they ruled over Libya as far as Egypt,and over Europe as far as Tuscany. ... But at a later time thereoccurred portentous earthquakes and floods, and one grievous dayand night befell them when the whole body of the island of Atlantis... was swallowed up by the sea and vanished; wherefore also theocean at that spot has now become impassable and unsearchable,being blocked up by the shoal mud which the island created as itsettled down.\"Where is that \"impassable\" and shallow sea filled with mud? British historianAndrew Collins has written a book entitled Gateway to Atlantis in which hehypothesizes that what Plato's sources were referring to is the Sargasso Sea onthe west side of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that stretches from the Azores to theBahamas and Cuba. Further, Collins describes 20th century research into half amillion shallow craters called \"Carolina Bays\" in the southeastern United States.Collins thinks the craters are linked to a comet's collision at the end of the IceAge around 8,500 B. C. that could also have caused the destruction of Atlantis.Interview:Andrew Collins, British Historian and Author, Gateway to Atlantis, Leigh-On-Sea, Essex, England: \"Atlantis researchers have been saying this from the1870s at least that we're talking about the Sargasso Sea. The Sargasso Sea is ahuge area of free floating seaweed that stretches from the Azores in the east allthe way across (the Atlantic) to the Bahamas in the west. The Bahamasthemselves, if we look at them, is a great area of shallows. In some places, thewater is as shallow as 3 or 4 feet deep.What I show is that the early myths and legends of almost all the Mesoamericantribes of Central America talk about an original homeland that existed quiteclearly in the region of the Caribbean. I mean it goes under different names:Chulan; Xtalan. But they say at this island described in the middle of the sea isthe place of their origin where humanity rose for the first time. They call it 'TheSeven Caves.'DO YOU THINK THE 1200 B. C. END OF THE BRONZE AGE WHICH"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"IS 3200 YEARS AGO COULD HAVE BEEN RELATED TO SOME SORTOF DEVASTATION THAT MIGHT HAVE SUNK AN ISLAND ORSOME?It was originally said that all of the islands in the Caribbean and Bahamas weretogether. They were one, one land mass. A number of folk tales from the islandstalk about this. And that suddenly, one day the waters rose up, covered theislands and that when the waters retreated, the islands had been broken up. Thepeoples on the islands had been destroyed and the only ones that got away wereeither in caves or went to the top of a mountain, the Noah-like figures who wereable to continue on.DOES ANYONE HAVE A SENSE OF A TIME LINE FROM THOSELEGENDS?It's impossible, really. The only thing you can do is take some of the clues. Oneof the stories talks about at the same time the old moon broke and fell.WHAT WOULD THAT MEAN?I think if you take it in the context of another story that says the serpent flewthrough the air and fell that we might be talking about some kind of cometary orasteroid type of thing. So, then you have to say, let's look at all theoceanographic records for the Caribbean and find out if there is anything therethat suggests a cosmic event in the last 12,000 years. So, this is what I did. Andthe only one event which seemed to make any sense is that of the CarolinaBays.\" (See more information at end.)Carolina Bays: Aerial photographs taken in 1930 for the Myrtle Beach (South Carolina)Estates lumber company byFairchild Aerial Survey.

The other interesting thing is that all the craters are oriented northwestto southeast. Every single one. There are variations on this, but that is it. And atthe southeast corner of many of them, there is a raised bank suggesting thatwhatever caused them the trajectory was coming in from the northwest anddown towards the southeast, hitting and causing these banks.ANY IDEA WHEN THIS OCCURRED?OK, well, initially it was assumed that it was an event in the great distant past,maybe millions of years ago. But when a lot of core samples were taken at thebasins particularly of the ones that had become filled with water that are nowponds, it then suggests that they were actually formed around the end of the lastIce Age.THIS TIME FRAME WOULD BE 9,000 B. C. OR ELEVEN THOUSANDYEARS AGO WHICH WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH THE GREEKSUSING THE TERM 9,000 IN THE DIALOGUES. AND THERE HASBEEN SOME CONTROVERSY ABOUT WHETHER THEY MEANT9,000 SOLAR YEARS OR SOME OTHER TIME FRAME BECAUSETHE EGYPTIANS MIGHT HAVE CONFUSED THE DATE.It definitely would have been thousands of years the Egyptians would have beendating with. They were not dating with lunar months.Satellite photograph by Donnie McKish which show meteor/asteroid/cometimpact craters near the island of Bermuda. Exact age of impact unknown.YOU DO NOT THINK WHATEVER THIS WAS OCCURRED AT 1200 B.C.?No, not at all. I think this was much much earlier. We certainly know in theCanary Islands, we find evidence of advanced civilization that might go back to6,000 to 8,000 years ago. Carvings.DO WE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THAT CANARY ISLANDCIVILIZATION?There are two carved heads that are very serpent like in appearance, but alsovery Mesoamerican. They were discovered there by archaeologists in the lastyear and they have been given a date in about 6,000 to 8,000 years old from thecontext in which they were found. This is great because we really could startseeing evidence of maritime exploration from the Americas across to Africa andinto Europe.COULD YOU TALK ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE OF COTTON INTHE NEW WORLD, PERU, MEXICO AND WEST INDIES?The strains of cotton found in the countries you mentioned are a hybrid form ofa strain that originated in the ancient world. And quite clearly it has been"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"developed for the purpose of cultivation in the Americas. In other words, it'sclear that whoever put it here, it was not natural. It was brought across anddeveloped in the Americas by someone else.DO WE KNOW ANY SENSE OF TIME FRAME HOW FAR BACKCOTTON WAS HERE?I think around 1500 B. C.THAT WOULD PRE-DATE THE END OF THE BRONZE AGE?Oh, yes.THAT MEANS YOU HAVE RIGHT THERE HARD PHYSICALEVIDENCE OF A CONNECTION BETWEEN ASIA, THEMEDITERRANEAN AND THE SOUTH AMERICA, CENTRALAMERICA AND WEST INDIES ON COTTON FIBER ALONE?That's right.WHY ISN'T THAT STORY ALONE ENOUGH TO KICK OUT THE OLDSTORY OF COLUMBUS?I suppose the obvious answer is that it doesn't come from the right source. I'm ahistorical writer and I can make 2 + 2=4, or even 5. But if this doesn't come froman academic with clout and influence, then it's never going to take hold. You cancome up with as much evidence as you like to support something, and if it doesnot fit the existing paradigm, then it's going to be rejected.I believe the greatest potential we have been given so far of finding evidence of acivilization that could link to Atlantis is Paulina Zelitsky's Cuba discovery. Fromthe evidence that I've accumulated and presented in Gateway to Atlantis, all ofthe clues point towards Cuba and the Caribbean as some how holding the finalkey to the mystery of Atlantis.\"More Information:Carolina BaysFacts:An estimated half a million (crater) depressions, in at least six states thatcover around 160,000 square kilometers.Aside from Georgia, North and South Carolina, they are also to be foundin other bordering states such as Maryland Virginia and Florida.Their (craters) frequency is astonishing. One area of Bladen County, NorthCarolina that measures 8 kilometers by 6.4 kilometers has a 67% coveringof bays. Other areas of the Carolinas have as much as 50% bay cover.No fewer than 140,000 of these are of moderate to large size, with lengthsof more than 152.4 meters. One of the biggest depressions is Big SwampBay in central South Carolina which is six kilometers from one end to theother. Some bays over 11 kilometers long.Many craters possess magnetic anomalies.In Camden, South Carolina, close to some of the bays, drainage ditchexcavators found at a depth of 4.3 meters a mass of downed trees, all in thesame alignment as if there had been a massive blowdown in the distantpast.Andrew Collins, Author, Gateway to Atlantis: \"In the 1930s, aerial surveyswere done for the first time of the Carolinas and when these pictures weredeveloped and printed off, it was noticed what appeared to be hundreds orthousands - and we now know there are as many as 500,000 elliptical craters -"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"some filled with water, some just dry land across the Carolina states. But alsowhen it was traced further, it was noticed they went as high as New Jersey anddown south to Florida. And they covered, I think, six states. \"And this was quite clear that when you started plotting the position of thesethat you are dealing with a much larger event which would have entailed - theones that remain. Ones that went into mountain areas obviously disappeared.Those that went into the water were not traceable. So, right from the earliestpoint, it was suggested these were the result of meteor showers. But some of thebays or craters were several miles long. Some of them were only a few hundredyards. There was no consistency to what had happened.\" Gateway To Atlantis © 2000 by Andrew Collins, published by Carroll & Graf Publishers,Inc.From the Ashes of Angeles © 2001 by Andrew Collins, published by Inner Traditions Bear& Company.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
