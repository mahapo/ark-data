Photograph © 2001 by owner who requests name and location not beused.July 28, 2001 Grass Lake, Michigan - On October 15-16, 2000, I reportedabout the discovery of hardened bovine hemoglobin on a mutilated bull in RedBluff, California. (See: Earthfiles 10/15-10/16/00.) Since the 1950s, unusualdeaths called \"animal mutilations\" have been reported around the world. Bothdomestic animals and wild game have been affected, especially horses andcattle. Ranchers and law enforcement have long been puzzled because animalsare found with the same pattern of hide and tissue removed - usually withoutblood - from the head, sexual organs, and rectum. There are no signs of struggleor tracks around the dead animals, not even the animal's own tracks. Thatpeculiar fact provoked law enforcement to wonder if perpetrators came in andout of pastures using aerial craft, picking animals up and dropping them backdown after taking tissues and fluids.Many ranchers have also speculated that their mutilated animals have been cutwith lasers because of the bloodless nature of the excisions. In fact, pathologyexams over the years have confirmed that cuts in some mutilations were madewith high heat. (See:An Alien Harvest and Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I:Facts & Eyewitnesses in Earthfiles Shop.) Biophysicist W. C. Levengood inGrass Lake, Michigan thinks a very complex set of energies are involved. Hebegan studying soil and grass samples from mutilation sites to compare with soiland grass from mysterious crop formations. In both phenomena, he has foundthe same pattern of respiration changes in plant cell mitochondria. He hasexperimented with microwaves and has reproduced some of the biochemical andbiophysical changes to plants in his lab.In addition to the 1997 California bull mutilation and pure, dried hemoglobindescribed in the October 2000 Earthfiles.com reports, this week I received newsfrom biophysicist Levengood about another confirmation of pure, dried"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"hemoglobin on a mutilated cow in Alabama.

It involves separating red bloodcorpuscles from the lighter plasma components by centrifugation.The plasma is siphoned off and ether is added to the corpuscle paste,causing the cells to burst. Another centrifugation removes theruptured cell envelopes and leaves a clear red solution ofhemoglobin. It is unlikely that a procedure such as this would bedone on site. It is unknown how or why this occurred.'\"4) Biophysicist W. C.

Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, GrassLake, Michigan:\"I think there are a number of implications (to finding a second case of pure,dried hemoglobin on mutilated cow). First of all, I think the discovery of thesame pure hemoglobin on the Alabama excision site was important in the effectthat it showed that the 1997 discovery of the pure hemoglobin wasn't just somewild, freaky thing, you know. It was very real.NOW WE'VE GOT TWO.And now we've got two that show very, very pure hemoglobin which to mepresents very striking anomalous situation.The discovery of this pure hemoglobin - a scientist probably recognizes the factthis is more astounding than a layman because if you know how hemoglobin isproduced in the pure form, it entails a number of very, very precise and ratherprolonged biochemical steps. In other words, you can't do this in a matter of afew minutes.PURE HEMOGLOBIN IS NOT FOUND NATURALLY IN NATURE.No, it isn't. It's in the red blood cells, the erythrocytes, and it can only beremoved by breaking down the cell walls by using a lysing agent. And then onceyou do that, then the hemoglobin comes out of the red blood cells, but so do alot of other blood components such as leukocytes, fat bodies and otherconstituents of blood that then have to be removed by further precise steps ofextraction and centrifuge.THIS TAKES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO DO?Yes, right. This takes a biochemical laboratory.THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT SOME ONE IS GOING TO SET UP IN APASTURE AND REPRODUCE THERE AND DAUB PURE HEMOGLOBINAROUND ON BRANCHES?Oh, no. No. No. And then, of course, there is another step that is taken in thiswhole process done by whomever and that is that the hemoglobin is now putinto a compact, solid form.WHICH IS THE WAY WE HAVE FOUND IT.It's dehydrated, exactly.YOU HAVE WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT INBOTH BOVINE EXCISION SITES AND CROP FORMATIONS THAT SOMEKIND OF SPINNING PLASMA VORTEX IS THE MECHANISM FOR THEENERGY TRANSFER. HOW DOES THAT RELATE IN YOUR MIND TOWHAT COULD BE HAPPENING THAT COULD PRODUCE THIS PUREHEMOGLOBIN ON BRANCHES OR ON THE GROUND AROUND THESEUNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS.Well, first of all, if you go to the Red Bluff, California report I sent you recently,what I found there is the same tiny micrometeorite-sized pure iron oxideparticles are found around many bovine excision sites.Now, we find that the distribution of the particles are distributed in a veryprecise manner. In other words, the quantity drops off linearly from the origin ofthe animal outward. So, if it fits this earlier model that I worked out in cropformations where we know we have tremendous vortex energies involved, then itkind of follows that probably the same type of magnetic vortex was involvedhere, although the way it's distributed would indicate that it's not as energetic asfound in the crop formations.THINKING ABOUT THAT, DOES THAT SUGGEST ANYTHING TO YOUABOUT WHAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY OR ENERGY SYSTEM COULD"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"BE INVOLVED?It is sure a pretty sophisticated one, that's for sure. Because if you take just thefact that I always find the grass is injured by the microwave radiation. And thatwas true here also. And particularly, the hairs that were standing up on the backof the animal?RIGHT.And the fact that they could be plucked out with the hands real easily.THAT WAS IN THE RED BLUFF, CALIFORNIA CASE.Yeah, as Jean Bilodeaux (field investigator) pointed out - that hide was cookedin a very precise manner in a very local manner by some sort of very, very rapidand very transient type of energy.WHICH MOST LOGICALLY IS MICROWAVE ENERGY WHICH COOKSWAT E R .Yeah, that's right, because the grass was effected, you see, they had high redoxratios right at the back of the animal.THAT'S RIGHT.And you moved out a ways and the grass had a normal level. Well, that highlevel always indicates that the grass has been severely injured in terms of themitochondria, the tiny organelles inside the grass that, inside the cells of thegrass blades, that are involved in respiration.THAT YOU HAVE REPEATEDLY FOUND FROM BOTH FORMATIONSAND AT BOVINE EXCISION SITES THAT THERE IS ALMOST A SIMILARPATTERN (OF DAMAGE) FROM CASE TO CASE ALMOST AS IF THEYHAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO SOME KIND OF ENERGY THAT HAS ALMOSTEXHAUSTED THEM.Yes, you go back a week later and you find the grass, even though it looksnormal when they took the sample, the grass is dead in that very local regionaround the animal. So that means the grass has been severely injured and therespiration has been impaired to the point that the grass just expires.FROM THE WORK YOU HAVE DONE, YOU LINK THAT TO EXPOSURETO MICROWAVE FREQUENCIES?Yeah, I have been able to simulate that in the laboratory. If I take ordinary grassfrom my own yard and I expose it very briefly - if I recall, it was less than 15seconds - to a microwave, I can produce the same kind of energy by looking atthe redox ratios, I can see the same kind of mitochondrial energy (damage) thatI'm finding at the bovine excision site in the grass there.THE DISTRIBUTION OF BOTH THE CHANGES IN THE REDOX IN THEMITOCHONDRIA AS WELL AS THE DISTRIBUTION OF SAY MAGNETICPARTICLES IN THE SOIL, IT HAS A CENTRIFUGAL DISTRIBUTIONPATTERN AND THAT IS WHAT HAS CONVINCED YOU THATWHATEVER THE ENERGY IS, IT HAS TO BE SPINNING IN SOME KINDOF A VORTEX?That's correct, yeah. It looks very likely, yeah. At some sites, it is more obviousthan others. But I would say there are many similarities between the vortex kindof motion you get around bovine excisions and in the crop formation patterns.THE PURE HEMOGLOBIN HAS BEEN FOUND EITHER ON BRANCHESOR THE GRASS OR THE HIDE OF ANIMALS. DOES THAT SUGGEST TOYOU THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ANIMALS HAVE BEEN LOWERED INTHE AIR DOWN AND THAT THESE DROPS OF THE HEMOGLOBIN HAVECOME FROM THE ANIMALS THAT WAY?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Well, I don't know - it could be. There is no question that this Alabama bovineexcision, the recent one, was dropped from a considerable height.And even though this was an area where there was no grass, the person thatsampled this was kind enough to get me leaf samples from the trees close to theanimal. And I found that they had not been changed at all in terms of the redoxpattern, which indicated to me that with these kinds of severe excisions that Ishould have seen some indication of an energy effect. But I saw none. Therefore,the excisions were probably done before the animal was dropped back down toearth.WHICH WOULD BE VERY CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THEEYEWITNESS CASES OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS IN WHICH PEOPLEHAVE SEEN - A RANCHER, IN FACT, IN OREGON WATCHED SEVERALANIMALS BE DROPPED FROM UNKNOWN OBJECTS DOWN THROUGHTREES. (See: Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness inEarthfiles Shop) AND WHEN HE WENT TO SEE THE ANIMALS, THEYWERE LYING ON THE GROUND WITH THE EXCISIONS FROM THE EAR,EYE AND SO FORTH.WHAT DO YOU THINK COULD BE BEHIND THE PRODUCTION OF PUREHEMOGLOBIN IN WHATEVER PROCESS IS CARRIED OUT? WHY PUREHEMOGLOBIN?I've been studying a little bit the effects of pure hemoglobin and its energy in thelab and it looks to me like this solid material has properties that would be veryinteresting to someone. This is certainly not done in a haphazard manner. It's avery directed, very precise series of biochemical steps that take place here. So,this must have some very important function in some other, some other processsomewhere.COULD IT BE THAT THE BLOOD IS BEING SEPARATED IN ORDER TOTAKE OUT CERTAIN INGREDIENTS LEAVING BEHIND THE PUREHEMOGLOBIN?No, no, no. These pure hemoglobin particles are not easy to find. You find just afew compared to the tremendous amount that would be in a cow, or bovine, cowor bull. You find just a few particles, probably less than 2 grams are ever found.And yet, I'm sure the total amount in a bull might be a pound. I don't knowprecisely what it would be, but a lot (of hemoglobin).So, this looks to me like it's a spill over effect. They were sloppy and left somebehind. Or maybe intentionally. Who knows?BUT IT STILL, THE IMPLICATION MIGHT BE, THAT THERE WAS ALARGER PROCESS OF EXTRACTION OF THINGS FROM THE BLOOD INTHESE ANIMALS AND THE PURE HEMOGLOBIN, THE LITTLE BITTHAT IS LEFT AND YOU HAVE FOUND AND ANALYZED, COULD BETHE RESIDUE OF A MUCH LARGER PROCESS THAT EXTRACTEDMAYBE A VARIETY OF THINGS FROM THE ANIMAL'S BLOOD?That's possible. The reason I don't think they are interested in any othercomponent of the blood is that you don't find any in the solid form. Andsecondly, you don't find any blood at all. Why wouldn't that just be dumpedsomewhere if it's waste?What I feel happens is every other component of the blood is totallydisintegrated with the exception of the hemoglobin. It's turned into its elementalform. This is why I have been trying to encourage people like NIDS (NationalInstitute of Discovery Science) who have the money and facilities and interest inthe pathology of this to take a look at the level of iron, using EDS (electrondispersive spectroscopy), in a slaughterhouse from a normal animal. And thenlook at the level of iron in an arterial wall of an excised animal compared to thenormal cow's (arterial wall iron) constituents."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I'm betting that you might find a much, much higher level of iron (in animalexcisions) because if the blood is disintegrated, this (iron) would be the onlyatom that would not be converted into another liquid, steam or blood, water,nitrogen and oxygen.I WONDER WHY WE HAVEN'T FOUND MUCH OF THIS PUREHEMOGLOBIN AT MANY OF THE ANIMAL MUTILATION SITESBEFORE?This has to be not only a unique process, but it's got to be damn efficientbecause it's not easy to remove that hemoglobin. Like I say, there are a numberof biochemical steps that have to take place. So I don't think they leave muchbehind. That's the part they are really interested in getting as much as they can.FOR SOME APPLICATION WE STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND.That's right. Yeah, I have no idea what they would use that for. Perhaps it mightbe more compatible with their system of physiology. I don't know. It almostforces you - as a scientist, you know, you don't want to think about that - but bygolly, it forces you into thinking about other entities and dimensions. Becausewe just can't do this - pick a cow up, drain or disintegrate all the blood in it,produce pure hemoglobin, and then drop it back down!RIGHT.And why would you want to?\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
