This wheat field is on the highest plateau of Milk Hilland the highest point in the county of Wiltshire, England. The field is not visiblefrom any road and to get there, people must walk about fifteen minutes fromthe nearest place to park a car. Photograph © 2001 by Lucy Pringle.August 22, 2001 Alton Barnes, England - Author and researcher, Lucy Pringle, has beenflying over crop formations to take aerial photographs and to investigate the plants andsoils of English crop formations since the mysterious patterns began evolving from simplecircles and rings in 1989. She has been in hundreds. But this formation that was discoveredin Ron Read's wheat field on a high plateau of Milk Hill, Wiltshire on Sunday, August 12,overwhelmed her. After measurements were made, there were 409 circles of varying sizesdivided into six curved arms stretching 240 meters (787 feet) from one side to the other.The largest central circle was 72 feet in diameter and the smallest little circles that dottedalong the large arms were no more than 40 inches in diameter.Interviews:Lucy Pringle, Crop Circle Researcher and Author, Petersfield, Hampshire, England:\"When I went in with Denni Clarke (from California), we were both completelybewildered and disoriented because as far as we could see in any direction there wasnothing but circles. We didn't know where we were. We couldn't find the center. We said,'What's happening to us?' We were just completely bewildered!Then somebody who had been in there longer got us and said, 'I know there are 13 circles(on each arm) from the tip right into the center.' So she started off ahead of us and she justdisappeared from sight on the horizon. And then she reappeared to wave from what seemedmiles away to say, 'I'm in the center!' So we made our way towards it, but you know whenyou are on the ground, you have no possible means of deciphering the shape of theformation, especially when you're confronted with 409 circles. Where the hell are you?!?Close-up center of Milk Hill, Wiltshire formation.Center circle was 72 feet in diameter. The smallest circles"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"were only 40 inches across. Photograph © 2001 by Lucy Pringle.It's quite impossible when many of them measure 70 feet in diameter. You just don't knowwhere you are. Totally mind blowing I've never seen anything like it. I mean, as far as youcould see on the horizon there were circles. I've never seen anything so big in all my life. Ihad to go up to over 2000 feet to get it in my lens!HOW DID IT COMPARE TO OTHERS YOU HAVE SEEN?Well, I can tell you that it was not like the triple spiral (Windmill Hill 1996 Triple Julia Set).In that triple spiral, every single circle was different. And I have to say in this particularone, the lay was very uniform. They are all clockwise.HAS ANYBODY BEEN ABLE TO GO TO EVERY CIRCLE?Not that I know of. I can't say I've been in all 409! I can't even tell you which ones I'vebeen in, to tell you the truth!! It's so confusing. I know I've been in the center a couple oftimes now. But every single one I went into, and I think it was a wide variety, they have allbeen clockwise.\"Giant 409-circle, nearly 800 feet diameter, formation discovered Sunday, August 12, 2001,in Milk Hill, Wiltshire, wheat field. Andreas Mueller of Saarbruecken, Germany measured everycircle, large and small, in one of the six arms. Photograph © 2001 by Lucy Pringle.A Researcher Who Measured Every Circle In One ArmANOTHER CROP CIRCLE RESEARCHER WHO HAS MEASURED AND DRAWNDETAILED DIAGRAMS OF DOZENS OF CROP FORMATIONS THE PAST THREEYEARS IS ANDREAS MUELLER FROM SAARBRUECKEN, GERMANY. HE HADBEEN IN SOUTHERN ENGLAND TRAVELING FROM FORMATION TO FORMATIONFOR ABOUT A MONTH IN THE SUMMER OF 2001. SATURDAY NIGHT, AUGUST 11,WAS HIS LAST NIGHT AND HE AND HIS FRIENDS LEFT EARLY THE NEXTMORNING FOR GERMANY. WHEN HE ARRIVED, HE ALREADY HAD AMESSAGE ABOUT THE HUGE MILK HILL FORMATION DISCOVERED THAT SAMEDAY, AUGUST 12. SO HE TURNED AROUND AND WENT BACK TO WILTSHIRE TOEXPERIENCE IT FOR HIMSELF AND MEASURE AS MUCH AS HE COULD. Andreas Mueller, Student, School of Fine Arts, Saarbruecken, Germany, andproducer of The International Crop Circle Archive (I.C.C.A.): “When you startsurveying, you look for symmetry and we have that in this formation. Of course, I didn'tmeasure all 409 circles. Entering it the only thing I can explain is that you were surroundedby circles. This was unbelievable. You made a 360 degree turn and circles were all aroundyou. And without an aerial picture, you simply would not know what's up there.But I measured each diameter of each circle of one of the six arms, even of the smallcircles on the side. And took some control measurements in other arms. So, this gives youquite a workable basis for doing the survey work. The biggest circle was in fact the centralcircle with 22 meters in diameter. (72 feet) And the smaller circles that were the caterpillarlike arms on the sides of the six arms which had the smallest was like 1 meter and 50centimeters. (40 inches or 3 ft 4 inches).The thing is that what was of very impressive detail in this formation is that it was placed ina field that was very sloping. There were many ditches and some in the field. Those ditcheswere very deep. I was once standing in an outer circle of one of the arms looking in the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"direction of the very center and I saw some people that I thought were sitting in a circlebecause their heads were just showing out of the standing crop. When I approached them, Irealized they were actually standing in a circle that was in the lowest part of the ditch. So,you can imagine how bumpy the whole area was. And this was very difficult for mebecause those irregularities in the crowns and in the topography did not cause anydistortion or irregularity in the formation itself which is a basic problem for architecture.What they have to do is make the foundation for a house, they have to create a flat andright angle platform where they can start on. Or they have to do a very detailedtopographical survey of the whole ground to be able to put down a building. And this issimilar - architecture makes the same as crop circles do - they bring geometry on theground, basically. And so, something was able to avoid all these known problems bycreating this amazing and the biggest formation we've ever had. Not the longest, but thebiggest we've ever had on such a hard terrain.And the night it had formed (August 11) it rained and and we can also confirm a witnesswho is credible, a crop circle man from Wiltshire. He was there on Saturday at the field andthere were no circles. So it had to have happened that night.It is something someone really has to experience in the field. This sheer scale, this sheerlarge scale. It's mind blowing. And to say it in an experienced circle maker's words whowas baffled by it and just kicked away by this formation, he said: 'My brain hurts.'THIS IS A GUY WHO HAS MADE CROP FORMATIONS, SAID TO YOU ABOUTMILK HILL, 'THIS MAKES MY BRAIN HURT.'Yeah. And I remember that we were out with a cropcircleconnector guy because it was ourlast night in England. When we drove home, rain started and the whole, or big part of thenight, we were covered in rain. And it was that humid in the air until 11 the next morning,the whole area was covered in very thick mist and fog and so we went home to Germany.But the basic thing I want to tell is that the night was covered with rain. And people whowere first in the formation said the lay was nice and clean and with no footprints on it andeverybody who knows what it is to walk in a wet field - you know this from England - it isnot possible to avoid that your feet and shoes get clumpy with tons of earth and mud andyou spread this all over in the formation. And nothing was there.WHAT KIND OF GEOMETRY ARE YOU FINDING AS YOU ANALYZE THISFORMATION?Many people compare this, of course, to the Julia Set. But the difference between thisformation and the Julia Set we had (in 1996). Julia Sets follow a spiral path. those 6 armsare not spiral. They are arcs as parts of circles. So, it's like in your book, you show theprocedure how to make a 6-fold geometry. And this is basically the idea that is shown - a6-fold geometry made out of circular elements. So, there are no spirals, just circles. Or ringsor arcs.FROM THE CENTER CIRCLE, COULD YOU SEE OUT TO ALL THE FORMATION INALL DIRECTIONS? WAS IT HIGHER IN THE CENTER?No, but it's a good question because it was actually the highest point in the field, or nearlythe highest point. Probably there was also another highest point at the other end of thefield. But it was really like a good place to put the highest point as the center point becauseit was slightly the highest point, but because of the topography of the field, you could notsee in all end of the arms because they were sometimes lower or hidden by the ditches inthe field. And sometimes they were too far away.STANDING IN THE CENTER, YOU COULDN'T SEE ALL OF THE ARMS TO THEEND?No.HOW DIFFICULT WOULD IT HAVE BEEN IN THE DARK TO LAY OUT SUCH AFORMATION AND PRODUCE IT?The thing that takes the time is the survey and the positioning and marking the geometricalrelevant points. And this really takes hours. And based on experience, I think the only wayit could have been made by people in several stages over several nights. But we knowdefinitely that did not happen. On top of that, it appeared on a night of pouring rain andthere was only a few hours between sunset and sunrise.It is something someone really has to experience in the field. This sheer scale, this sheerlarge scale. It's mind blowing."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Intelligent Consciousness Sensed in the Milk Hill FormationAFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF GOING EACH SUMMER FROM GERMANY TOENGLAND AND GETTING INTO THE FIELDS, ARE YOU LEFT WITH ANY SENSEINSIDE YOURSELF OF WHAT COULD BE BEHIND SOMETHING LIKE MILK HILL2001?I think a good word that explains what I feel is 'consciousness.' And 'intelligence.' But notfixing those two words to aliens from outer space. I see the intelligence and consciousnesseven in Nature, but not in simple nature as we are used to experiencing it each day. It issomething hidden in Nature. Probably it can be explained with Hyper-Nature. I don't know.I don't want to exclude aliens, but it's not what I personally feel. I feel after all these yearsthat we are facing a phenomenon that teach us again the basic teachings on ourself, ourenvironment and our nature. And so I see more hints for linking the phenomenon with aconsciousness and intelligence which is in nature itself.CLOSE TO THE MIND OF GOD, SO TO SPEAK?So to speak, but this brings crop circles in the religious and I don't think they are religious.And in the same way that I look at a flower and suddenly realize what a wonder it is. Whatbig and complex geometry it includes and this is something we need to wonder about andthis is something I think the crop formations teach us.\" What A Professional Land Surveyor Says:GIVEN THE IMMENSE SIZE OF THE MILK HILL 2001 FORMATION AND THE 409CIRCLES, I ASKED A PROFESSIONAL LAND SURVEYOR IN THE STATE OF NEWJERSEY TO STUDY PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE PATTERN AND ESTIMATE HOWLONG IT WOULD TAKE HIS SURVEY TEAM TO MARK OUT THE FORMATION.Vincent Creevey, Professional Land Surveyor, Southern New Jersey: \"To stakesomething like this out in the field from a surveying perspective, it's probably going to takea better part of a day and a half to two days work. Because you've got 409 points. Youwould have to lay out the radius point of every circle in that formation to get it perfectlysymmetrical. And the office calculations you would need for something like that wouldprobably take also the better part of a half a day with a computer. And the way this wouldbe laid out would be with an electronic distance meter and a data collector that wouldalready have the coordinates of all the points stored into it. That's how it would be laid outin the field.A TWO MAN TEAM WORKING WITH THOSE CONDITIONS WITH THE MOSTADVANCED SURVEYING COMPUTER KNOWLEDGE, WOULD TAKE MAYBE UPTO TWO DAYS EVEN TO LAY IT OUT?That's correct.WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU LOOKED AT THE PHOTOGRAPHAND YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD APPROACH A HILLSIDEWHEAT FIELD THAT UNDULATES AND IS ON A SLANT AND PUTTING DOWNCIRCLES IN A PATTERN THAT SEEMS TO BE THAT MATHEMATICALLYACCURATE?My personal opinion is that I think the thing is fantastic and absolutely amazing! And Ishowed this to a couple of my colleagues at work and they said, 'Yeah, it would be a bigjob!' And I don't know how you would explain it.I wouldn't know how to go about putting down the circles themselves. From a surveyingstandpoint, what we'd be looking at staking out would be the center of each circle, theradius point. So, then from there by whatever means, the circle would be flattened fromthat central point. I can't even venture a good guess as to how long that would take.AFTER TWO DAYS OF WORKING IN THE FIELD, WORKING OUT THE CENTERSOF THE CIRCLES AND DOING THAT WITH AT LEAST A HALF DAY OFCOMPUTER TIME DATA, YOU HAVE 2.5 DAYS THERE. THEN LAYING THE CROPDOWN WOULD BE AN ADDITION TO THOSE 2.5 DAYS?Yeah. And I would imagine that would take some time as well. It certainly would be adifficult task to lay this thing out. And a costly one. In the United States your survey crewsrun anywhere from $800 to $1,000/day. Also, I'm speaking of doing this work in the day"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"time. It would be very, very difficult to do this survey work at night time.WOULD IT BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO LAY THESE 409 CIRCLES OUT ATNIGHT?It would be extremely difficult. You would have to have some type of surveying equipmentwith an optical laser site on board. That does exist, but it's pretty expensive and mostpeople aren't using it because it's not necessary for a lot of current construction layoutwork.Another possibility would be to lay it out with the Global Positioning System (GPS)equipment. Once again, that is even more costly equipment, but that works by usingsatellites to determine your position on earth. And you would have to have the time to layout those using the satellite positions.COULD YOU GUESS HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE TO LAY OUT THAT 409CIRCLE FORMATION?With the very best GPS equipment available, you might be able to lay out each point inabout 2 to 3 minutes, and with some of the less expensive equipment, it would probably beabout 45 minutes per point. That would still be about twelve hours of laying out pointsbefore any crop could be laid down.”More Information: Lucy Pringle has produced this 2002 calendar with three glossy photographs per page,showing the classical crop circle formations, plus associated sacred places, cathedrals,villages, flowers and animals.Her price in U.
