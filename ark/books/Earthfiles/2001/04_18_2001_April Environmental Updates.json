C. - The Bush administration, under fire fromenvironmental organizations and foreign governments for recentanti-environment decisions, has now overruled business objections and upheldtwo Clinton administration regulations that Bush had suspended shortly aftertaking office. One is to restrict development on thousands of acres of wetlands.The other will require thousands of manufacturers to publicly disclose leademissions totaling 100 pounds a year from industrial production, includingmakers of batteries, circuit boards and pipe organs. That is one-tenth the currentamount allowed of 10,000 pounds of lead emissions.Jeff Wise, Policy Director of the National Environmental Trust, commentedabout Bush upholding the regulations, \"The bar can't be much lower for Bushwhen he makes a big deal out of the fact that he is not going to block a Clintonadministration rule to require polluters to report on the amount of lead they putinto the environment.\"In March, Bush dismayed environmentalists and foreign governments when he:Blocked tighter limits on arsenic in drinking water;Suspended cleanup requirements for mining companies;Abandoned U. S. participation in the Kyoto global-warming treaty;Renounced a campaign promise to restrict carbon-dioxide emissions fromutilities.First CDC National Study of Environmental ToxinsThe lead decision comes at the same time that the U. S. Centers for DiseaseControl and Prevention reported about its first national study of 5,000 men,women and children. The results show that traces of toxic metals, pesticides andplastics are in the blood and urine of most Americans. CDC found that womenof child-bearing age are frequently exposed to phthalate, a chemical used inplastics and cosmetics. Phthalate can cause birth defects and reproductiveproblems in mice.John Balbus, Director of the Center for Risk Science and Public Health said,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"This report should serve as a wake-up call. It is the first time the governmenthas made an inquiry into the level of contaminants in human bodies, and thepublic has the right to know this.\"Foreign Reaction to Bush Retreat from Kyoto Global Climate AccordThe Prime Minister of Norway, Jens Stoltenberg, told NRK public radio thatNorway and other nations would now have to cut back their efforts to combatglobal warming by reducing carbon-dioxide emissions. The problem is the U. S.refusal to join the global climate accord effort. Stoltenberg said, \"It's clear (U.S.refusal) will brake work over the whole world, so it's important to get theAmericans along.\"Stoltenberg is now criticized for using the Bush withdrawal from Kyoto as anexcuse to change Norway's earlier commitment not to raise emissions ofgreenhouse gases by more than 1% between 1990 and 2012. The EuropeanUnion has already said it will go ahead with Kyoto goals of cutting CO2emissions without Washington support. But Norway is not a member of the EUand is the top non-OPEC oil exporter, a fuel that is a large contributor togreenhouse emissions.More Evidence of Human Influence on Global WarmingIronically, as the U. S. withdrew from participating in the Kyoto global warmingaccord and Norway appeared to back off as well, the April 12, 2001 issue of thejournal Science contained two new studies that provide the strongest evidenceyet that greenhouse gases are causing the Earth's oceans to warm. One of thestudies was headed by Sydney Levitus of the Commerce Department's NationalOceanographic Data Center. The other lead author was Tim Barnett of theScripps Institution of Oceanography whose research was funded by the NationalScience Foundation.Their new studies used computer climate models which showed that thewarming of the oceans that has been measured over the last fifty years isprecisely what would be expected from the additional greenhouse gases emittedinto the atmosphere. Dr. Levitus said, \"I believe our results represent thestrongest evidence to date that the Earth's climate system is responding tohuman-induced forcing.\" Dr. Barnett added, \"This will make it much harder fornaysayers to dismiss predictions from climate models.\"Droughts and Floods At Same Time in U. S.Other computer model projections of global warming show more severe swingsin temperatures and rainfall. Perhaps one example now are the severe droughtsin the northwest U. S. and Vancouver, Canada along with Florida which issuffering the worst drought in 106 years of weather records. Oregon officials in"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Klamath, Jackson and Josephine Counties say they are getting ready for theworst drought conditions in years. Bruce Sund, the Watermaster of JosephineCounty, says wells in rural areas are drying up and residents will have to begintrucking water soon. The Great Lakes are at all time lows and expected to getlower.Mississipi River Crested Near Historic HighsThe Mississippi River crested April 25 at 22.29 feet continuing to flood surrounding landand tributariesas shown in the dark blue of this NOAA OSEI satellite image. Intense sandbagging effortsin Davenport, Iowahelped reduce water damage in the only river town without a flood wall. Photographcourtesy of NOAA.Violent tornadoes, heavy snowfall and more flooding assaulted the Midwestagain this past weekend. One person was killed when an F-4 tornado with windspeeds between 207-260 mph cut a path three-eighths of a mile wide and fivemiles long through Hoisington, Kansas shortly after 9 p.m. on April 21st. Aquarter of the town's buildings were smashed and 26 residents were injured.At the same time, the Mississippi River in the Midwest is flooding four statesand provoked Governors in South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michiganto declare states of emergency for areas along the great river spilling over itsbanks. NOAA's Climate Prediction Center is predicting heavy rain and floodingbetween April 20-24 in much of western South Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsinand Michigan. Also, strong to severe thunderstorms are forecast through muchof the central Plains and Ohio River Valley for April 21-24.Radioactive Ground Water in Fallon, NevadaA 1994 U. S. Geological Survey analysis of 73 wells in the Fallon, Nevada areashowed that 31 of the wells exceeded federal standards for radioactive minerals,mostly from naturally occurring uranium in the water. But no one bothered toinform the public. In fact, Assemblywoman Marcia deBraga (D-Fallon) did notlearn about the report until April 17 and is outraged. She and other officialshave been concerned about a cluster of 12 childhood leukemia cases diagnosedin Fallon since 1999.\"This could turn out to be significant in terms of the leukemia cluster,\" she said.\"Clearly, radiation is one of the listed causes of leukemia. The researchers needto follow up on the radiation levels in the wells.\"We b s it e s :http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s625.htmhttp://enso.unl.edu/monitor/monitor.html"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"http://www.nasa.gov/http://www.noaa.gov/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
