But fire from God in heavenwill flash down on the attacking armies and consume them.\"The Revelation in the Bible 20:7-9 July 11, 2001 began the first formation that unfolded in three stages, followed by asecond formation in a nearby wheat field on July 25, 2001 southeast of Cambridge,Englandat the Gog Magog Hills near an ancient Neolithic circle of stones called Wandlebury Ring. September 18, 2001 Gog Magog Hills, Cambridge, England - Two monthsto the day before the horrorific attacks on New York City's World Trade Center,the Pentagon in Washington, D. C. and the airliner over Shanksville,Pennsylvania, an unusual series of evolving crop formations occurred in wheat atthe Gog Magog Hills southeast of Cambridge, England near an ancient Neolithiccircle of stones called Wandlebury Ring.First Crop Formation Began Emerging on July 11, 2001at Go g Mago g Hil l s, Camb rid ge, E n gl an d :"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The big ring, 666 feet in diameter, came first by itself on July 11, 2001.

With his permission, I am excerpting from his July 2001 reportsand ground photographs. Charles Mallett, CFPR Field Report,Gog & Magog Hills, Cambridgeshire July 11-18, 2001: Stage One - The Ring Measured 666 Feet In Diameter\"What started life on the 11th of July as a vast but neverthelesssimple ring of flattened corn in a Cambridgeshire wheat field has nowmorphed several times into what can only be described as amind-stretching, paradigm-shifting, orgasmagram of the very highestorder. ...First came the big ring ... spanning a massive and potentiallyrather ominous 666 feet diameter. (This is a definite figure, not anapproximation). Most of the field has been used in the creation ofthis formation making it one of the most expansive crop glyphs in thebrief history of the circle phenomenon. ...To my amazement, the ringitself repeated the same numbers in its width that were found in theoverall diameter of the formation, with the tape measure pulling tightat exactly 18 feet. At the center of the mighty ring is a beautifullyswirled circle with a diameter of 45 feet. This also arrived as part ofthe initial Stage One event.Stage Two - The Labyrinth Measured 237 Feet In Diameter"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Second stage, center of 237-foot-diameter labyrinth.Photograph © 2001 by Charles Mallett.\"About a week later, the Magog field took its second hit with thearrival of a most elegant 237 feet diameter labyrinth that is positionedjust inside the inner edge of the Stage One ring. A very fine wall ofstanding wheat, only a few stems thick, separates the maze from thering itself. This labyrinth seems to be crafted out of the ripe wheatwith an attention to detail not seen for some years in the crop fieldsof England. Every aspect of the winding walkway has been finishedwith a razor sharp edge that gives one the impression that whatever isresponsible for this awesome creation has a fanatical zeal forabsolute, total perfection.\"At the center of the labyrinth is a standing ring of crop positionedwithin the central circle, offset from center by a considerable degree.The purpose is not clear, but nevertheless is a fine detail worthy ofour admiration. Walking through this network of 3 feet diameterpaths left me in no doubt that the agency that created this marvel isable to gain absolute control over the chosen area and seeminglydoes with ease what I would consider nearly impossible.Gog Magog Hills labyrinth pole shot © 2001 by Charles Mallett.\"On the ground, the entire laid crop area has the appearance of aslightly rippling carpet flowing throughout the whole maze with aconsistency and fluidity that is obviously the result of a single andmasterful hand, not a stalk out of place. This effect is consistentthroughout the whole three stages of the overall formation and was,for me, an excellent example of what a real crop glyph looks andfeels like. ..."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Circles in center of 666-foot-diameter ring with labyrinth in background.Photograph © 2001 by Charles Mallett.Stage Three - The \"Step Pyramid\" Measured 225 Feet In Diameter\"Some days later, the third addition arrived on the scene. ...From anaerial perspective a kind of step pyramid is now seen rising out of thefield next to the maze. At ground level, this is a bizarre sight. Sixstanding square-like walls of wheat with rounded corners, eacheighteen inches thick, fit together to produce a most amazing design,very much in keeping with the uniqueness and originality of theoverall formation. The quality of construction, as with the labyrinth,shows absolutely no compromise whatsoever. There is no doubt thatthe same agency that produced the ring and maze has returned to thefield to work the same magic once again. Stunning. At the center ofthis crafted temple, the crop has been laid down in such a way as tocreate a shining, four-sided apex stone. ...Third stage, 225-foot-diameter \"step pyramid.\"Photograph © 2001 by Charles Mallett."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"\"Step pyramid\" defined in wheat at Gog Magog Hills southeast of Cambridge,England.Photograph © 2001 by Charles Mallett.\"It is rather interesting to note the positioning of the two majorformations within the ring. First, the maze arrives and takes up aquarter of the inner expanse of standing crop. Next the steps comedown, or possibly up, next to the maze, thus using up another quarterof the available space. This suggests that we are possibly in foranother couple of major events at this site.\"But after Stage Three, the wheat patterns in the Gog Magog Hills stoppedchanging. Then came the second formation in a nearby wheat field. Continued in Part 2.
