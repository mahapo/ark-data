He spoke thispast weekend at the Earth Mysteries Conference in Sedona about the power ofEgyptian talismans, physical objects that through magic and rituals were thoughtto bring the power of stars and gods into them; and his theory that the pyramidsof Giza have the same alignment as the stars in the belt of Orion. He wrote abook about it with Adrian Gilbert in 1995 entitled, The Orion Mystery,Unlocking the Secrets of the Pyramids.The Greeks looked at the pattern of bright stars dominated by Betelgeuse andRigel and saw a great hunter who claimed superiority over all Earth creatures.Nearby was the brightest star, Sirius, in Canis Major, one of the two faithfuldogs that the Greeks said traveled with Orion. The other is Canis Minor. But theEgyptians considered Orion and Sirius to be the home of Isis and Osiris, godsthat came to earth and created a kingdom in Egypt from which they also createdhumankind. After Osiris and Isis departed Earth, each Egyptian king wanted tofollow and return his soul to Orion and Sirius upon death. The Giza pyramidswere built on strict alignments with those stars, and Sirius was the star of rebirthdepended upon to breathe new life and resurrection into dead kings.Mummification was part of the complex ritual of magic that linked terrestrial lifeto an eternal life with Osiris and Isis.Reinforcing the idea of that intimate relationship between the pyramids and theOrion constellation are shafts inside the largest pyramid at Giza. Two carvedchannels come out of the Queen's Chamber and two out of the King's chamber.At first, archaeologists thought the shafts helped ventilate the pyramid. Butcontradicting that theory is the fact that the two channels leading from theQueen's Chamber are blocked at both ends. Other theories suggested the shaftswere used like telescopes to observe stars from within the pyramid. But theshafts go from a horizontal level and bend upward making line of sight throughthem impossible. In 1981, while working with another engineer in Saudi Arabia,Robert Bauval had the sudden inspiration that the the three Giza pyramids seenfrom above had the same slightly offset alignment pattern as Orion's belt.Interview:Robert Bauval, Construction Engineer and Author of The Orion Mystery,Unlocking the Secrets of the Pyramids, Beaconfield, Buckinghamshire,England: \"I saw three stars that looked like three pyramids and it completely"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"changed the course of my life! As simple as that. I was working in Saudi Arabiaas a construction engineer and as I have explained in my talks is that myspecialty in my engineering profession started with a setting out engineer. I wasaligning monuments. And therefore I was very interested in this aspect ofengineering. And took it further and became very interested in ancientmonuments, particularly pyramids, and tried to explain their alignments. Onething lead to another and eventually while in Saudi Arabia, I made thatcorrelation with the stars of Orion.It so happened that I was into that strange problem of trying to explain thealignment of the three pyramids of Giza and it so happened that - it's exactlyhow it happened. I was visiting some friends in Saudi Arabia and had justreturned from Egypt and they had brought with them a coffee table book withlovely pictures of the pyramids. One of the captions next to the pyramid was aquotation from the pyramid text which incidentally I had not read then. I'mtalking about 1981. And that text simply said, which I know now by heart, thatthe king became a star and the king went to Orion. And it stuck in my mind.A few days later, I happened to be in the desert and a friend was with me. Andwe were talking about the stars and he happened to be a navigator. It was justone of those flukes. He explained that if he didn't have charts, he would use thestars as all navigators do. He said the easiest way to quickly chart your way inthe skies was to look at the constellation of Orion, that you could draw a linefrom the belt to Sirius and find that star's position and then find certain otherdirections. And then as an after thought, he said, 'The three stars of Orion arenot straight. One is off set.' And bang, for me, that did it. I saw it then.Some people have said, by the way, that you cannot see the Orion correlation ofthe pyramids, you cannot see the pattern of the Pyramids, from the ground.Indeed, you can't. But a lot of people forget that you can go to the top of theGreat Pyramid. From there you can actually see it. It is very striking. But it ismuch more striking from a high distance.BUT WHY WOULD EGYPTIANS HAVE ANY SPECIAL PERCEPTIONOF THE ORION BELT?Taking it from a completely simplistic level, Orion is an extremely bright andnoticeable constellation. In the times when the pyramids were built, theconstellation of Orion would appear at very important times of the year. Itwould rise sometime, some 20 or 25 days before the summer solstice and anhour or so before the appearance of the star Sirius. So in a sense, Orion was theherald, the announcer, of the great event of the Summer Solstice and theappearance that the star Sirius brought about which, of course, was the floodingof the Nile. So, Orion in the sky was a signal for rebirth, the rebirth of Egypt.One can see how this archetypal image in the sky, the concept of forthcomingrebirth, was associated with the god of resurrection and rebirth of the Egyptians.It's important to realize that all Egyptian monuments, and particularly thepyramids, are astronomically aligned, are astronomically oriented. And thepyramids, particularly the Great Pyramid, are aligned to the cardinal directions.That means, north, east, south and west. The alignment is so precise that inorder to achieve this alignment, you need to, they had to aim their sightinginstruments to the stars. So, that's the first thing that these monuments aresurveyed and aligned using the stars. And that's the stellar connection, if youlike.But more importantly within the Great Pyramids, there are two chambers withinthe superstructure: we call them the King's Chamber and the Queen's Chamber.And from these chambers emanate two shafts. In each chamber, there are twoshafts. One shooting north and one shooting south. On the basis that thispyramid has astronomical connotations, both physically in the sense of itsalignment, and symbolically in the sense of the religion it is based on, thereligion of the stars and Orion and Sirius and so forth - it is very tempting to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"assume that these shafts had a ritualistic function. There is a great misconceptionabout these shafts because it has been thought for a long time that they might beventilation shafts. This hypothesis has long been discounted for various reasons.first, it wouldn't make sense that ventilation would be necessary in a monumentwhere supposedly a dead body was placed.In any case, the shafts in the Queen's Chamber were shuttered at both ends. So,they couldn't possibly have served the purpose of ventilation. So, we must lookfor another purpose. And because of the intense astronomical qualities of thesemonuments, it is correct to assume the shafts might have had astronomicalimplications. Well, the fact that they are inclined, that they rise on an inclinedslope and each of the shafts has a different slope, ranging from about 30 degreesto 45 degrees. These slopes to an astronomer, especially as the shafts pointnorth and south, are indicative of a region of the sky that is very rich with theseconstellations that the Egyptians speak about. And a quick calculation usingprocession has shown since the early 1960s, that first the upper shafts of theKing's Chamber had stellar alignments. The southern one pointed to the belt ofOrion, the three stars in the belt of Orion. and the northern one more than likelywas aligned to the North Pole of the sky, and probably to the star Thuban,Alpha Draconis, which was the polar star at the time.Now, to what purpose? One, in the southern direction, we knew there was somekind of connection to the pyramids, the mummification rituals, the rebirthrituals, to these particular stars of Orion that the King longed for his soul to goto. So, that made sense. The other was that the Egyptians speak in great quantityin the texts about the so-called indestructible stars, the circumpolar stars in thenorth.THAT WOULD NEVER RISE OR SET.That would never rise or set and therefore, to them, they were stars perpetuallyin the sky and indestructible. However, the axis, the alignment of the northernshaft of the King's chamber points very close to the celestial pole and it indicatesto me that the pyramid is literally anchored to the axis of the sky. In short, it is amonument that is locked into a cosmic order. This is precisely what I think theyare: these structures are integrated into a cosmic order with the stars of Orion,the polar star and so forth.Later on, I came into the picture and worked on the alignments of the lowershafts and discovered that the southern shafts pointed to Sirius, the star of Isis.And the northern shaft probably pointed to one of the bright stars in Ursa Minorwhich the Egyptians referred to as the \"Opener of the Way.\" It is known in thezodiac as the Little Bear, but it's in the form of a jackal in Egyptian iconography.There, too, there is a meaning to these alignments ritualistically to do with apyramid cult.We are told of a ritual known as the Opening of the Mouth. The mummy wouldbe given, ritualistically given the breath of life again by cracking or inserting aninstrument in the mouth of the dead and giving it breath again. This instrumentwas in the shape of that (Ursa Minor) constellation. We know for sure becausethey called it the same name as the constellation and it had that peculiar shapelike a spoon, like a bent spoon. So, in a sense, the pyramid becomes integratedwith the astral link of that ritual, that some how from the stars and rebirthprocess, the deceased would be given the breath of life again. And Sirius, ofcourse, is the star of rebirth which the king originally had been associated withat his physical human birth on earth. We know that they associated the birth ofkings with the appearance of the star Sirius at dawn of the summer solstice. So,all this makes sense to me.They are not, as many people have suggested or argued, that they areastronomical shafts. They are not meant to look through. You cannot, in fact,see through them. Parts of them are running horizontally and then on an incline.It's impossible to see through them. They are ritualistic, magical devices, thatneed to be understood in that sense. That's what these shafts mean."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WHY MAGICAL?Because the rituals are magical. The whole process of Egyptian religion thatpoint needs to be stressed again. The Egyptians did not have a religion. There isno such thing or word in ancient Egypt as a religion. The nearest thing thatcomes close to what we would call today religion was a word that meant magic.They believed that one could learn to bring down the powers of the cosmosthrough rituals, through alignments of monuments. They believed they coulddraw down the powers of these stars, the powers of the gods, into physicalthings like statues and pyramids.The pyramids to them were imbued with stellar power. This is the kind of magicthey practiced. There are other words for it. Some people have called it astralmagic. Some people have called it \"talismanic magic\" which is my favoritedefinition. It is the understanding that spiritual ideas can be incorporated inphysical things, very much like we are spirits in a material body. So can otherthings in nature have spiritual power and hence, the pyramid itself is given asoul, if you like, through these kinds of rituals. It's something that needs to beunderstood because there is so much talk about Egyptian religion, but there isno such thing. There is Egyptian magic.IN A SENSE, IT'S AS IF THE GODS THAT THEY PERCEIVED WERELIVING WITH THEM ALIVE IN LIFE OR AFTER DEATH IN ALL OFTHEIR EFFORTS TO MUMMIFY IN ORDER TO BE RESURRECTEDWITH THE SAME KIND OF SURROUNDINGS THEY HAD HADHERE, BUT IN ANOTHER PLACE. WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE,THOUGH, FROM A STUDY OF THE BEGINNINGS WOULD HAVEPROVOKED THE EGYPTIAN MIND TO THINK THATMUMMIFICATION WOULD GIVE THEM A GUARANTEE OF LIFEBEYOND DEATH HERE?Mummification as you know, Linda, is associated through an archetypal story ormyth which is the myth of Isis and Osiris. The Egyptians fervently believed thatthe gods had once come down to earth and that they were descendants of thelineage of divine beings from the source of Orion, Osiris and Isis. Osiris and Isisrepresented the archetypal king and queen that had come down from the starsand had begun a terrestrial kingdom in Egypt. This is at the very root ofEgyptian magical religion. And that events that followed in the lives of Isis andOsiris which lead eventually to the mummification of the body of Osiris.Osiris is killed at the ripe age of 28, so we are told in some of the texts. Again,we have astronomical symbolism here, the phases of the moon. What follows isthat Isis left without child or replacement or heir to this kingdom that was begunby Osiris, follows a magical ritual of mummification by bringing back themutilated corpse of her husband that was cut to pieces by his brother, Seth, andthrough some sort of magical rituals which we call the mummification rituals,brought back the mummy to life. And it is for the sole and unique purpose ofbeing able to give life to Osiris in order to become pregnant from him. AndOsiris having been brought temporarily to life in terrestrial existence again, hissoul is released in this process and his soul returns to the stars and to theparticular stars of Orion.From this archetypal story which is in a sense drafted in the sky, the skybecomes sort of a book where the story of Isis and Osiris are written, the kings ofEgypt believed they were reincarnations of the son of Isis and Osiris, theposthumous son who was born called Horus. Kings of Egypt were absolutelyconvinced of this idea that they were Horus's kings.WOULDN'T THIS BE SIMILAR TO THE REINCARNATION OFSOULS, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE BUDDHAS?Absolutely. The Egyptians had absolutely no doubt that their kings, at least,were part of a perpetual system of reincarnation that went from son to father,son to father, which meant to them that in a living physical form, the king was a"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"reincarnation of the son of Isis and Osiris. But in his death, he became releasedfrom his physical body, left his terrestrial role to his successor, and he becamehimself Osiris. And the whole process is to create an Osiris, a mummification.We call this mummification. I don't like this term because it implies thisgruesome idea of taking bodies, drying them and wrapping them. We begin tolook at them too mechanistically.The best term that would define this is the Osirisization of a corpse. That kingbecomes, is made into another Osiris, in the same sense that Osiris was made.And by doing step-by-step the process the process that happened to Osiris, theywere certain that the same results would occur - the soul of the king would bereleased and would depart into the sky from whence it had originated and rejoinits place in the sky which is among those stars (Orion's Belt and Sirius). This wasan absolute belief for the Egyptians. They believed it as much as we believe weexist on this earth. This was a fundamental aspect of their belief system.IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THEIR PERCEPTION OF THE UNIVERSEAND ESPECIALLY THEIR FOCUS ON SIRIUS AND THE ORIONBELT STARS WAS PROVOKED BECAUSE THEY LITERALLY WERETAUGHT BY NON-HUMANS WHO CAME FROM THAT PART OF THEGALAXY AND TAUGHT THEM, JUST AS THE SUMERIANS HAVE AVERY SIMILAR KIND OF CONCEPT OF THOSE WHO CAME FROMTHE STARS AND TAUGHT THE SUMERIANS?If one accepts what the Egyptians tell us in their texts literally, then what theytell us is precisely what you just said. They say that the gods came from the starsand established civilization on earth and then re-departed to the stars andprepared for us, or their progeny, which is us, a place among the stars for us toreturn to. In a curious way, this is in metaphoric language not very different fromwhat astrophysics tells us today.I remember the famous statement by Carl Sagan that we are star stuff. We areindeed made out of star material, whether we like it or not. We are children ofthe stars. Our earth is a product of a star. And indeed, the question is which starwhich makes it even more interesting. And the Egyptians are not saying anythingthat we cannot accept today as modern thinkers. Whether the events can betaken literally in the sense that beings from these specific star systems actuallycame down is a matter of speculation.BUT WHAT IF IT IS TRUE? WHAT IF THE REASON THAT THEDOGON TRIBE IN AFRICA HAS ALL THIS ESOTERIC KNOWLEDGEABOUT SIRIUS AND THE PHYSICS OF THE BINARY STAR SYSTEMBECAUSE THEY WERE DEALING WITH EXACTLY THE SAMEINTELLIGENCE THAT EGYPT AND SUMERIA WERE DEALINGWITH THAT LEFT A LEGACY OF ALL KINDS OF KNOWLEDGEABOUT ASTRONOMY AND MATH?Yes, you've said the magic word 'What if?' Of course, with what if, we can do alot of things. But let's go on the assumption that such a thing might havehappened. Then if it did happen, perhaps the goal is to find out if it really didhappen. Although some people - and I throw myself in this camp, may bereluctant to take that step. Nonetheless, if it is true, then truth will emerge. I'm agreat believer that truth eventually emerges. And perhaps all these studies weare undertaking from different points of view will lead to this one conclusion. Iwould be the most thrilled to know this was a truth! But at the moment, like Isaid, in a sense it is academic whether it is true or not. What is important is whatthey believed to be true or not. For me, that is sufficient to pursue this line ofstudy.I KNOW THAT IS ONE PARTICULAR HYPOTHESIS, BUT ONE THATIS GROWING, I THINK, AMONG SCIENTISTS I TALK TO IS THEPOSSIBILITY THAT THERE ARE ADVANCED CIVILIZATIONSBEYOND HERE AND THEY DO TERRAFORM AND SEED PLANETSAND THAT THIS PLANET MAY BE AN EXPERIMENT.I'm open to the possibility that if comets can deliver the seed of life to otherparts of the universe, then they might have been used as vehicles for"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"terraforming. So the visitation if it happened, let's keep it as a hypothesis, couldhave been through a cometary messenger rather than in the manner that othersvisualize - some sort of star ship or craft has come here. We have evidence ofcomets coming here, exploding, of meteorites landing on the earth. We evenhave evidence of fossilized microbes and microscopic creatures being brought tothis planet. We have evidence of that. That is sufficient.But we do not have evidence of a star craft. We do not have evidence ofinterspace travel. Some people think they do. I know that Sitchin does.WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON ZECHARIA SITCHIN'STRANSLATION OF SUMERIAN CUNEIFORM THAT SEEMS TO VERYDETAILED AND SPECIFICALLY DESCRIBE A NON-HUMANEXTRATERRESTRIAL SPECIES COHABITING WITH HUMANS ANDTEACHING THEM EVERYTHING THAT THE SUMERIAN CULTUREKNEW?The same can be said for the Egyptians. The Egyptians say the same thing. Butyou must accept that in order to reach the conclusion that Sitchin arrives andothers arrive, there is a point where there is a leap of faith. It's a question aboutwhether you want to take that step. Do you want to accept that what is beingsaid there in those ancient texts is literal truth. It's a question of how you wantto take it.Cydonia and MarsIN YOUR WORK WITH GRAHAM HANCOCK ABOUT MARS ANDTHE CYDONIA 'FACE' AND PYRAMIDS (The Mars Mystery: The SecretConnection Between Earth and the Red Planet), DID YOU FIND IN YOURRESEARCH THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONNECTIONSPHYSICALLY WITH THE EARTH?What we faced there is that in a nearby planet of our solar system might be anartificial monument. Lo and behold, these monuments appear to be pyramids.So, it would be foolish if the possibility of monuments on a nearby planetexisted, then we should be open to the possibility of monuments of a similardesign and similar caliber might have a connection. So we explored. We wereopen to the possibility. We weren't afraid to go in this direction. I call thisPlatonic investigation. If the clues are there, if the evidence is there, then you arejustified to follow it. But you must be brave enough that if it is not leading towhere you hoped it leads, you must abandon it or modify it.DID YOU FIND THAT THE PYRAMID THAT IS PART OF THECYDONIA COMPLEX SEEMED TO HOLD UP IN THE ANALYSIS AS ATRUE PYRAMID?At the time it did, to be honest. At the time, we were getting more and moreconvinced that we might have artificial structures there. the only way toconclude this was to send another probe there to get clearer pictures, or tophysically go there.Now, it so happened the book in late 1997 just at the time that the latest probeswere being sent there and we had to admit that from at least the photographicevidence that was being published by NASA that suddenly the needle swungtowards non-artificial structures.BUT THAT WAS ONLY ON THE FACE. THAT WAS NOT LOOKING ATTHE COMPLEX OF THE PYRAMIDS IN WHAT HAS BEENDESCRIBED AS THE CITY?I fully agree that to me the matter may not be closed in the minds of a lot ofpeople. We took it as far as we could take it, short of physically going there andhaving a look physically."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"IF THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN PYRAMIDAL STRUCTURES ONMARS AND ON THE EARTH, WOULDN'T THAT SUPPORT EVENFURTHER WHAT THE EGYPTIANS AND THE SUMERIANSTHEMSELVES SAID THAT A NON-HUMAN STAR PEOPLE FROMPERHAPS ORION AND SIRIUS CAME TO THIS SOLAR SYSTEM ANDWERE NOT ONLY INTERFACING AND INVOLVED WITH EARTH,BUT WITH MARS?The simple answer to this is yes. But you said 'if.' The implications of artificialstructures on Mars would completely change our perception of our existence.And indeed with a big if, if these structures had proved to be artificial, then wewould be obliged to consider an interstellar visitation.NOTHING HAS PROVED AGAINST THERE BEING PYRAMIDALSTRUCTURES ON MARS.I agree it has not been totally disproved. What I just said earlier, that we are atthe position where we need the next step. That is to physically go there. That'sit. We wrote our book after we investigated and we concluded that from theevidence that has been provided so far from NASA that the needle has swungtowards non-artificiality. But it doesn't mean that it has reached the fullconclusion. There is still the possibility and we would be foolish as a race onplanet earth, that the possibility even though remote that artificial structures areexisting on a nearby planet, we would be foolish to ignore it. But I myself thatwhere I stop, there are others waiting to carry on.Could we be, in the panspermia hypothesis, from somewhere else and are weadapted here? In fact, the more one thinks of it, the more one is inclined to thinkso. We are extraordinary creatures. We seem to be at odds with the naturalworld here. And if so, we are from somewhere else, sooner or later we willdiscover it. My way of approaching this is saying that perhaps the means toknow this is through an ability we have not put into full practice which theEgyptians perhaps had, or at least developed much more than we did.That is that the knowledge is within us. That this information is inside. We areencoded with it. But we are not reading it. We are looking outside. We are tryingto explain by sending probes to outer space. Perhaps that knowledge is in thereand let's say that this form of knowledge does not require the kind of evidencethat science is looking for.DOES THAT TRANSLATE INTO MEDITATION THEN?There are many ways. I'm trying to learn the language of the soul that theEgyptians did. I spoke a lot about what I call that talismanic language orwisdom. I believe we can talk internally by using another language of symbols,sensation and feelings encapsulated in symbols.In our almost finished next work, Graham Hancock and I call it Talisman (to bepublished in 2003). We believe there was a talismanic science. Basically ourmind thinks in those terms and responds to symbols and signs. We read naturethrough a language that is a talismanic language. We absorb the knowledge ofnature through that. and the stars.So we have tried to explain what this is, how it was applied by the ancientEgyptians, how it was revised in the Hermetic texts in Florence, how it served asthe base of several reformation movements and in the modern times Masonic,Rosicrucian and Hermetic movements. This interests me because it seems we arelacking the ancient science and wisdom. Today we have it in a puzzle form andwe need to put it together. That's what we are trying to do in this book. There isa language of the soul, a language of internal self, the talismanic language, andpeople will feel that there is a search to do within. Other things come in the toolkit meditation and other things. I am pursuing it through the talismanic language.We need to understand why the monuments, symbols, star lore and processes ofritual. I don't believe it was hocus pocus. I believe it was part of a verysophisticated science of the soul.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"More Information:Click to connect to Amazon.comWe b s it e s :Stars & Signs II Egypt tour with Robert Bauval - Here's the info/link:http://www.ancientquest.com/travel/starsandsigns/press.htmlCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
