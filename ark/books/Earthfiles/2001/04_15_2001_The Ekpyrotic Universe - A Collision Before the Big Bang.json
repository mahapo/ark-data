Ovrutat the University of Pennsylvania Physics Department to \"work in\" the theoretical 5thdimension.Photograph © 2001 by Linda Moulton Howe.April 15, 2001 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - A brand new theory about thecreation of the universe emerged recently from cosmologists and particlephysicists at Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania andCambridge, England. The new theory is called the Ekpyrotic Universe, from aGreek word meaning \"conflagration\" used to describe the universe's creationfrom a huge fireball that cooled down. Periodically, the Greeks thought, theprocess could repeat itself.The new Ekpyrotic theory has grown out of super string and M-theory that saythere have to be eleven dimensions. We live in the first four: three dimensions ofspace plus time. The 5th dimension is the one in which, the new theory goes, acataclysmic event took place that ended up creating the universe we are nowliving in. Dimensions 6 through 11 are like scaffolding behind the scenes uponwhich our 3-dimensional theater plays out. Dimensions 6 through 11 are verytiny and curled up into a little ball which is too small to see, but without whichthe universe could not exist.String theory says that dimensions 1 through 4 \"float,\" so to speak, in the 5thdimension. The new theory suggests that not only is our universe floating in the5th dimension, but the 5th dimension can have waves in it just like the ocean.Further, one or more of those 5th dimensional waves can become a soliton -meaning, a wave can form that keeps on going as a wave and does not collapse.If such a 5th dimensional soliton wave should come in contact with a4-dimensional universe such as ours, what would happen? That's what thesecosmologists and mathematicians have been working on. Rather than calling thisa universe and the soliton wave a wave, theorists today now refer to large scalemathematical features in different dimensions as \"branes.\" The term originatedfrom discussions about \"membranes\" in different dimensions.Recently in a meeting at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Maryland, thisnew theory about the creation of our universe from a 5th dimensional brane"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"slamming into a 4-dimensional matter universe was presented by Princetonastrophysicist, Paul Steinhardt. He worked out the mathematical details over thelast year and a half with Princeton graduate student, Justin Khoury; Cambridge,England physicist Neil Turok; and University of Pennsylvania particle physicistand mathematician, Burt Ovrut.I visited Dr. Ovrut at his Penn Physics Department office this week to talk aboutthis new theory of universe creation from a collision between different branes.He began by describing his concept of the 5th dimension.Particle physicist Burt Ovrut talking about parallel \"branes\" floating in the 5th dimension.Photograph © 2001 by Linda Moulton Howe.Interview:Burt A. Ovrut, Professor of Physics, University of Pennsylvania,Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: \"This 5th dimension one might view as being anocean. It's an ocean in the following sense: it's more or less pure gravitation, butgravity like water has waves in it, so there are gravity waves. It's just a field likewater is in a sense a field and it can wiggle and wave and things move along.And gravity can do the same thing.Now, when I was a small boy, perhaps 8 years old, I remember my father takingme down to see some of the ships in New York. The ocean liners existed thenand they used to come into the west side of Manhattan. And I rememberstanding with him on the docks to this day - it really had an effect on me - inseeing a beautiful ocean liner called the Michelangelo which was one of thegreat ships of the time. And there was something wrong with the Michelangelo -the entire superstructure all the way to the bulkhead and all the way up to thebridge was completely destroyed. It was twisted and wrecked and the windowsof the bridge were blown out. And I emphasize that the windows on the bridgemust have been 200 feet above the surface of the water. These were giganticocean liners.What had happened was that the Michelangelo had run into what is called aWhite Wave. It's some enormous wave that is formed in the ocean and then cantravel very, very long distances without dissipating very much. It's what we mightcall a soliton, a technical term that people use in field theory. Waves can behavelike this to some extent. One can have rogue waves, white waves, that travelacross the surface of the ocean. In fact, the Michelangelo had hit one of thesewhich must have been several hundred feet high and completely destroyed thesuperstructure of the Michelangelo. I will never forget that. And from time totime, you hear about these things. They exist.Well, this is what you should conceive of happening inside this 5th dimensionalocean. You can imagine there is a solitonic wall, a big wave in the middle that is3 + 1 dimensional. It's a big wall that runs across the sea and is either moving, orstationery, across the sea just like a wave. And the question is: what happens ifone of those big babies comes in and slams into the walk way on which we are"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"standing, slams into our visible world? And that can happen.We find that there can be waves in the 5th dimension that can come in and hitour visible world and when they do, they hit it with a big bang. And that is ourorigin of the Big Bang. We claim that the Big Bang Theory of the Universe, thevisible world, in fact happened precisely when a brane from the 5th dimensioncame and crashed catastrophically into our physical world.I UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF OUR GALAXY, ALL THE GALAXIES,THIS UNIVERSE THAT IS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 12 AND 16 BILLIONLIGHT YEARS ACROSS DEPENDING UPON HOW IT'S MEASURED ORWHEN. AND WE CALL THIS THE MATTER UNIVERSE. AND WHAT ITHINK YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT EVEN IF WE DON'T SEE IT ANDWE'RE NOT AWARE THAT WHICH WE THINK OF AS THE WHOLECOSMOS IS SOMEHOW SURROUNDED BY THIS OCEAN OF THIS 5THDIMENSION AND THAT THE 5TH DIMENSION CAN HAVE THESE WAVEDYNAMICS IN THEM.SO WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT THERE WAS A UNIVERSE OF3-DIMENSIONAL MATTER THAT WAS EXISTING BEFORE THEUNIVERSE WE ARE IN THAT WAS SLAMMED BY ONE OF THESE 5THDIMENSIONAL WAVES. AND THEN SETS OFF AGAIN WHAT WE HAVEBEEN CALLING THE BIG BANG WHICH WAS THIS ENORMOUS, RAPIDEXPANSION OF HEAT AND ENERGY BEFORE THE CURRENT MATTERUNIVERSE. CAN YOU TAKE US BACK TO THAT MOMENT - THE WAVEIS HITTING A YET PRE-EXISTING UNIVERSE? HOW DO WE END UPOUT OF THAT COLLISION?What you said is exactly correct. There is going to be some pre-world that isprior to that collision. It was in fact a boring place. Our universe is hot andlively and filled with people and art and whatever. The universe before thesecollisions was cold as far as we know. So it was a cold, dark place in which youhad branes moving around in this 5th dimension. It is the energy that weimported from the colliding brane wave when it slammed into us that created theheat, light, matter and all of the world we see around us.When it slammed into the pre-existing universe, it hit quarks and leptons andvarious kinds of gauge fields, photons and so on. It takes at least a part of thatenergy of collision and imparts it to them. That's what happens when one carhits another. It will take a certain energy. Even if one car is stationary, all of asudden that car begins to move a little bit. So it hits the quarks and leptons andradiation and imparts kinetic energy and the motion in those particles is what wecall 'heat.' So, it is precisely the heat of the Big Bang. Now we understand whereit comes from. What we say is that the heat and the Big Bang are precisely acertain fraction of the energy that was the kinetic energy of motion of the 5thdimensional brane when it slammed into us - the motion of slamming into usreally is true and it imparts all that slamming energy as heat and particles.AS YOU WORK WITH ALL YOUR MATHEMATICAL THEORY AND YOUARE FINDING THAT YOU HAVE MATHEMATICAL FORMULAS THATARE MATCHING UP TO THE WHOLE CONCEPT OF A WAVE COMINGTHROUGH THE 5TH DIMENSION AND SLAMMING INTO AN ALREADY-EXISTING UNIVERSE AND CREATING A NEW ONE THAT IS THE ONEWE ARE LIVING IN - COULD THIS HAPPEN AGAIN?This is very interesting. Of course it's quite possible that there are other waves ofthis sort out there. We are looking at the possible effects that if there are otherbranes, could they possibly effect our present world in some measurable way.And we've thought about it and have nothing much to say about it at themoment, although we certainly are looking mathematically at such things.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Ekpyrotic Theory Matches Observed Background Microwave RadiationTHE MATHEMATICAL ANALYSES BEHIND THE EKPYROTIC THEORYSURPRISED DR.

THAT'S WHY PHYSICISTS LONGAGO DEVISED THE THEORY OF INFLATION TO EXPLAIN THEUNIFORMITY. BASICALLY, THE INFLATION THEORY SAID THATEVERYTHING BEGAN FROM A BIG BANG OUT OF A TINY SPOTCALLED A 'SINGULARITY' - A MATHEMATICAL CONCEPT THATSTARTS THE UNIVERSE FROM SINGLE PLACE FROM WHICH ALLHEAT, LIGHT AND MATTER HAVE CONTINUED TO EXPAND FOR ATLEAST 12 BILLION YEARS.DR. OVRUT SAYS HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES HAVE COMPUTED THATA BRANE MOVING THROUGH THE 5TH DIMENSION HAS AFLUCTUATION SPECTRUM WHICH IS PRECISELY THE SAME AS THEBACKGROUND MICROWAVE OBSERVED SPECTRUM OF OURUNIVERSE. THAT DISCOVERY OF SUCH A CLOSE MATCH BETWEENTHEIR NEW THEORY'S DESCRIPTION OF THE BACKGROUNDRADIATION AND THE ACTUAL UNIVERSE IS WHAT PROVOKED THESCIENTISTS TO PROMULGATE THE EKPYROTIC COLLISION BEFORETHE BIG BANG.\"What excites us is that we find that a brane moving through the 5th dimensionhas a fluctuation spectrum which is precisely the same with a few smalldifferences with the observed spectrum of the universe. It is the same spectrumwith a few small differences from what the inflationary picture would haveshown and it is not at all obvious that there was any other way other thaninflation to ever produce a Harrison-Zel'dovich scale. We have shown, if nothingelse, that moving branes do produce that spectrum. That to us is very important.It means that if this collision took place as we say, not only do we understandimmediately why there is the same universe, even parts that are not in causalcontact, but we also understand the large scale structure of the universe ratherwell and we are very pleased by the fact. And that's what leads us to promulgatethis as a theory of the Big Bang. So that's really the important issue and we havebeen able to get quite far with that.Now, there are some differences and these are very important to us. Again, onemay worry about 5 dimensions and strings and how abstract it all sounds - wefind this fluctuation spectrum generated by a brane moving in the 5th dimensionis not quite the Harrison-Zel'dovich spectrum. It slightly has more power, isslightly stronger in the wavelengths that are shorter. That is, as things becomemore blue - blue has a shorter wavelength than red - as things become blue,there is more amplitude in those waves. Now, it's not enough to violate what ispresently known about the large scale structure, but it is the kind of thing that isconceivably measurable. Now, inflationary theories also tend to be not quite aHarrison-Zel'dovich spectrum. However, they tend to produce spectrum thathave more power in the longer wavelengths which are red. There is a realdifference there.Generically speaking, there is a difference between our Ekpyrotic fluctuationsand the fluctuations of inflation which has to do with our fluctuations being"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"more blue and theirs being more red. We hope that experiment in the not toodistant future will begin to distinguish between these. So these are measurable,testable events, objects and theories and that's very important.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
