The one fromAugust 2000 now seems linked to the August 2001 formations. Last year's wasone of England's largest 2000 formations in terms of square footage andappeared next to the Chilbolton government-owned land upon which the radiotelescope complex was built in 1965. The facility is sectioned off from thepublic and is surrounded by a high barbed wire fence. The estimatedmeasurements of the code formation is 200 feet long and 85 feet wide; theestimated face measurements are approximately 160 feet wide and 180 feet long.Both are framed by wheat laid down in almost identical fashion, according tofield researcher, Charles Mallett, from Roundway, Wiltshire."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"August 2000 aerial photograph of the large formation that emerged in wheat field next toChilbolton Observatory, Hampshire, England.

The Arecibotransmission was planned by astronomers at Cornell University, including thelate Carl Sagan.

I won't know for certain untilI've decoded the center bit. Because if you look down between the two strands,there's like a vertical bar in the middle between the two. Now, the originalArecibo transmission that corresponded to the number of nucleotides in theDNA itself as a binary code. Now that was subtly different on the ground. Soobviously that could give a key to why the strands are different on the outside.Because if they have a different number of strands in the DNA itself, then thatcould account for the off balance as it were.On right: Bottom half of transmission code: the DNA symbol, humanoid, solar systemand Arecibo transmitter are depicted in descending order in the 1974 Arecibobinary transmission in black and white. The humanoid standsbetweenbinary information about its height on the left and the earth's humanoidpopulation in 1974 on the right. Below the humanoid, the sun is depicted as a squarewith its 9 planets.

The dish diameter of 300 meters is in the bottom line of binary code.On left: The Chilbolton wheat formation for comparison.Is that what you were able to confirm today in the field?Yes, I confirmed that on the ground. There is a single dot. It's a single digit thathas been changed in the middle."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A single digit?Basically where you've got the binary code where you have the zeros and ones,the squares and empty squares in the vertical bar between the two sides of theDNA. There's actually change in the original in the middle there. But I won'tknow until I actually count those on the computer and run it through tocalculate the DNA sequence. Then hopefully that may give an indicator as towhy the outside is different.There is something indicating a difference in DNA between the two codes.there is also a difference in the solar systems. The Arecibo transmissionshowed earth as the third planet from the sun raised toward the humanoidfigure.Right.In the Chilbolton wheat field, the solar system goes over two planets andthen three planets are moved up the way the Arecibo transmission raisedup earth.The third one is moved up. The fourth one is also moved up. The 5th one ismoved up, but it is also changed from a single dot into four little dots, forming asort of cross.What do you think that means?That one is interesting. It could mean that there are three planets in their solarsystem are inhabited and they actually come from the 5th planet. Because itlooks like they've indicated three planets raised up as we did the earth, but theyhave also indicated that 5th is special some how because they have highlightedthat all the more with that division into four parts. Or it could mean thatpossibly the 5th planet could have three moons around it.If there is a one-to-one relationship between the new code and the 1974earth code, where we put a human figure, there is what could be perceivedas a figure in the Chilbolton code. It looks like it has a very large head withprotruding eyes and a short, thin torso. Is that a fair description?Yes, some people have likened it to a gray alien or something. Whatever it is, it'sa lot shorter than the human.It's confusing because if it were a code transmission reply to the 1974Arecibo message, why would the sender put a human-like face in theChilbolton field instead of the strange, big-headed entity depicted in thecode?I wouldn't like to speculate on the origin of that face. I like to focus on myresearch and let people come to their own conclusions by showing them theresearch. But I can't for the life of me see how you would go about hoaxing thatface. You can't see the pattern at all from the ground. It's very neat and tidy, butit looks a mess if you follow in terms of the shape. You can't say, 'Oh, yes, this isa circle and crescents' like you can in a normal crop circle. It just looks like aload of random dots. And yet to get that effect from the air, which it is obviouslydesigned to be seen from, it's quite incredible. I can't see how you could hoax itwithout someone in a helicopter speaking to you on a radio or something saying,'Left a bit. Right a bit.' Because it's just so complex and unrecognizable on theground. And you can't see how you would, especially in the dark, go from oneto the next and not make a mistake. To get that full effect from the air is actuallyquite incredible.Let's talk about the bottom segment of both transmissions. In 1974,Arecibo sent out an arc over a binary code indicating the diameter of theArecibo radiowave dish. In the Chilbolton code, that same bottom spacehas the identical pattern of a huge formation that appeared right next toChilbolton the year before in August 2000. The implication is the bizarre"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"pattern depicts a transmitter.Right. The key to understanding the code is that underneath the representationof Arecibo is the size of the dish which ultimately affects the transmissionfrequency that it goes out from. That was another discrepancy in this newAugust 2001 code in the field because the actual size indication is different. It'sa different code and I need to find out how the original wavelength was encodedin the original (Arecibo) transmission and then apply to the new pattern and seewhat that yields. Because I have a suspicion that might give a key implying thatthe previous crop circle (August 2000) was some form of communication oforigination or has relevance to decoding it all. When you transmit the signalfrom the Arecibo one, if aliens had picked it up on the other side of the universe,then obviously they got as far as decoding our signal and they set down into thebox there about where it originates. You might find the frequency that theypicked it up on.There is one other discrepancy and it's encoded in the atomic numbers. At firstwhen I saw it on the aerial photo, I thought it was an error or a smudge on thephoto that you couldn't make out. That is one of the main reasons I drove upthere (to Chilbolton, Hampshire) today to have a look. But it's not an error; it'sprecisely encoded in the sequence.This is in the sequence of the elements?Right at the top, you've got the bit that's the sequence of the numbers 1 to 10 inbinary code. But immediately beneath those, you've got the atomic numbers forbasically the main elements on earth, the building blocks that support life.That's the P.O.N.C.H. sequence?Yes, that stands for Phosphorus, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Carbon and Hydrogen. Nowyou can decode that. The one that corresponds to the \"P\" is a complete line.Like it's all there, which in binary would be 15. It would be 1111. The followingone, if you read it vertically, would be 0001. So that corresponds to 8. If youright down 0001 in binary, you get 8. And of course, the 8 corresponds to theoxygen. Then the next one would be 1110, which is 7, which corresponds tonitrogen. The next one is 011, which is 6 in binary, which is carbon. And thenthe very last one is the single 1 which corresponds to 1 which is hydrogen.You're saying that in the Chilbolton code formation, it's changed?Yes, in the Arecibo transmission, you've got the five columns going across,hydrogen, carbon nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorous. But on the ground whichyou can't see unless you analyze it in detail - and I did confirm it today - thereare actually 6 columns. So whoever did this code formation inserted an extraelement.Now they have inserted it between the oxygen and the phosphorous. so insteadof going 1, 6, 7, 8, 15, they've actually coded it as 0111, which is 14. So, it thengoes 1, 6, 7, 8, 14, 15 in the code.Then, if you look up the atomic number for 14, you get silicon. That is veryinteresting because lots of people have speculated that if there are alien lifeforms, which are not carbon-based life forms as everything is on Earth, thenabout the only other element in the entire periodic table that could possiblysupport life is silicon-based life forms. So you could theoretically have a planetthat could have silicon as its dominant element. If it's genuine binary codecommunication, I think the insertion of silicon in there is possibly a significantfind.\"More Information:The new updated 2nd Edition of my book, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circlescontains a new chapter on the 2001 formations, including detailed photographs"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"and text about the Chilbolton and other formations. See Earthfiles Shop.To help clarify the world of binary numbers, the following is submitted byDonald Lortie, a New York City computer consultant and former IBMprogrammer.NOTES ABOUT BINARY NUMBER SYSTEMS\"We use the decimal number system based on the 10 digits 0 through 9. This is asystem with a base of 10.Computers use the binary number system based on the digits 0 and 1. This is asystem with a base of 2.Programmers read binary numbers by using the hexadecimal number systembased on the 16 digits 0 -15. There are no symbols to represent 10 -15 so theletters A through F are used to represent numbers 10 through 15. This is asystem with a base of 16.Hexadecimal numbers are needed to simplify the reading of long strings of 1'sand zeros which computers produce. Everything in a computer is represented bystrings of 1's and zeros in binary.The binary number system works just like the decimal number system in that:When you need to represent a number one larger than the highest digit, youplace a zero in the right column and a 1 in the column to theleft i. e. 9 plus 1 is 10 in the decimal system and 1 plus 1 is 10 in the binarysystem.10 in binary equals 2. Adding 1 to 10 equals 11. But in binary that is 3, noteleven. The nextbinary number is 4 (100) and the next is 5 (101); the next is 6 (110) and so on.All these binary numbers are derived by following the rule: Zero plus one equals1 and 1 plus 1 equals 10. Remember 10 is 2 in binary, 11 is three in binary andso on. When you add 1 and 1, you get a carry just as in the decimal system.The numbers get larger when the addition causes a carry to the next column onthe left, just as in the decimal system 9 plus 1 equals 10, or 999 plus 1 equals1000. Now try adding 1 to the number 1 in binary and continuing counting to15. You should get 1 (one), 10 (two), 11 (three), 100 (four), 101 (five), 110(six), 111 (seven),1000 (eight), 1001 (nine), 1010 (ten), 1011 (eleven), 1100(twelve), 1101 (thirteen), 1110 (fourteen), 1111 (fifteen). Actually it is simplerthan decimal because you only have to carry 1, never more than 1.Converting these 15 numbers to hexadecimal, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A,B, C, D, E, F. How would you read a number like 1100101000111001? Firstseparate the digits in groups of 4 starting at the right: 1100 1010 0011 1001.Then substitute the hexadecimal number for each group of four. A, B, C, D, Eand F are substituted for 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111 respectively. Sothe number is CA39 in hexadecimal. CA39 is a lot easier to read than the binarystring, 1100101000111001.To understand the value of a decimal number as a base 10 number (i.e.powers of10 in each column), we multiply the number in each column by powers of 10and add the results of the calculation for each column. The power for the rightmost digit is always zero and each position to the left increases the power byone.For example the number 847 is the sum of 7 x 10 to the zero power (= 7) plus 4x 10 to the 1st power (= 40) plus 8 x 10 to the 2nd power (=800). That is 7 plus40 plus 800 = 847. The same method is used in calculating the value of binarynumbers except that powers of 2 are used instead of 10 because binary is base 2.847 =7 x 10 to the zero power = 7 (0 power for rightmost digit)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"4 x 10 to the 1st power = 40 (1st power for middle digit)8 x 10 to the 2nd power = 800 (2nd power for next digit)An example converting the number 100 in binary to decimal:100 in binary is equal to 0 times 2 to the zero power (= 0) for the rightmostposition, zero times 2 to the first power for the middle position (= 0) and 1 times2 to the second power (= 4) for the leftmost position. 0 plus 0 plus 4 = 4.Therefore 100 in binary is 4 in decimal.Finally, 1111 in binary =1 times 2 to the 0 power = 11 times 2 to the 1st power = 21 times 2 to the 2nd power = 41 times 2 to the 3rd power = 88 plus 4 plus 2 plus 1 = 15, so 1111 in binary is equal to 15 in decimal. Now tryconverting the number CA39 in hexadecimal to decimal using a base of 16. It's alittle more difficult. Clue: it's a larger number in decimal than you think.\"We b s it e s :http://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://home.clara.net/lucypringlehttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
