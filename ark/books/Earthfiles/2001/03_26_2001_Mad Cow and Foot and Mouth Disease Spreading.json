The European Union quickly imposed a ban onlivestock exports from the Netherlands and on exports of meat, dairy and animalproducts from four Dutch provinces. About 17,000 animals within a 1000 yardradius of the three infected farms will be killed.Similarly, a small region in France is battling the disease. Ireland tried hard tokeep the British hoof and mouth epidemic from spreading into its herds - evencanceling St. Patrick's Day celebrations. But now there are three groups ofinfected sheep and on Friday, Ireland began slaughtering thousands of livestock.Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have also confirmed the first knowncases of the highly contagious virus in the Middle East. Those governments havebanned imports of all animals and birds without prior permission.Great Britain is where the epidemic began and by this weekend, more than half amillion animals have been killed in the past month trying to stop the diseasespread. But computer models at the Imperial College in London predict that theepidemic will continue beyond June to infect perhaps 5000 more animals,making this the worst English hoof and mouth epidemic on record, doubling theseverity of the last one in 1967. It's so bad that Prime Minister Tony Blair sayshe might postpone the May 3 general election."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Several hundred British livestock sick with thefoot and mouth virus have been killed and incinerated.Photograph © 2001 by The Associated Press.The disease has been around for centuries and is not very fatal, killing onlyabout 5% of its victims. But like a bad flu in humans, the animals become sosick they stop eating and lose weight, stop producing milk and often abortunborn calves. Vaccines against the seven known types of the virus have beenmade, but the foot and mouth viruses can mutate. There are recorded instancesin which a virulent strain broke through the protection of a vaccine.That's one of the reasons since the last American outbreak in 1929 that the U. S.policy has been to kill and incinerate all cases of foot and mouth. But ranchersin the United States are now very worried that international travelers could bringthe virus in on shoes, clothing, suitcases or other gear. The foot and mouth virusis resistant to destruction and has been known to remain active in hay for 30days.Mad Cow (BSE) DiseaseCow infected by Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) that destroys brain tissue, onright,with a myriad of holes that resemble a sponge. Photographs courtesy www.mad-cow.org.The foot and mouth virus has been an especially hard blow to Great Britainwhich is still reeling from the impact of another very different disease: BSE,bovine spongiform encephalopathy, also known as Mad Cow Disease. That isnot a virus. BSE Mad Cow is caused by a natural part of every living mammalthat suddenly goes haywire. And that is a protein called a prion. What has madethe British Mad Cow Disease so dangerous is that 90 people also contracted thesame exact misshapen prion proteins and died of what is now called NewVariant CJD disease. The destructive prions are concentrated in the brain andspinal cord.The theory is that the British Mad Cow proteins are passed on to humans andother animals through meat products that contain destructive prions. Great"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Britain used to grind up all parts of dead cattle, including brains and spinalcords, for livestock feed, sausages, hotdogs and other products.The first evidence of BSE in the U. S. was confirmed this week. In Vermont, twoflocks of imported Belgium and Holland sheep were taken by the U. S. Dept. ofAgriculture because several tested positive for antibodies to BSE. Now the fourhundred sheep originally purchased for a gourmet cheese business will be killedand their brain tissue analyzed at the National Veterinary Services Lab in Ames,Iowa. The lag time in prion disease emergence means that scientists won't knowwhich specific prion infected the European sheep for at least two to three years.Making things worse in Britain, some butchers used to split the skulls of wholeanimals and remove the brains with knives and their bare hands. That means theknives, butcher blocks, counters and towels in their shops could becomecontaminated by destructive prions which are almost impossible to destroy.Such butcher techniques were used in a Northern England village where fivepeople all died of new variant CJD linked to meat ingestion. All five lived in thevillage between 1980 and 1991 and all five died between 1998 and 2000. That'sa lag time of 10 to 20 years. Scientists predict that if prion incubation turns outto average 20 years, the worst outbreaks could yet come.Then in Denver, Colorado on Friday evening, March 23rd, there was a pressconference at St. Joseph's Hospital to quell rumors that two people had died ofMad Cow Disease. What the two people did die from in December and Januarywas the standard form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. But a third CJD victim inBoulder, also in January, adds up to a lot of cases for a prion disease that issupposed to be so rare that it affects only one in a million people.The three Denver/Boulder victims were between 50 and 70 years of age, whichis typical for Creutzfeldt-Jakob, a prion disease that was first discovered inGermany in 1920. The symptoms are very similar to what happens to cattle inMad Cow disease: a rapid deterioration of muscle coordination and mentalability, not being able to walk or talk, and always ending in death. And inautopsies after death, both Mad Cow and CJD show sponge-like holesthroughout the brain and spinal tissue. But the new variant CJD Mad CowDisease in Britain and Europe seemed to affect people largely 30 years oryounger and is traced to ingesting BSE-infected meat products. No one knowsfor certain where the original CJD prions came from, but they have not yet beenlinked to ingestion. The bottom line: all are prion diseases. Prions are not easilykilled and can be passed from one surgical instrument to another. In fact, CJDcontamination from surgical instruments used in a CJD biopsy is now an issue atSt. Joseph's. Friday night after the hospital's press conference, I talked with PatBarker of the hospital's media affairs office.Interview:Pat Barker, Media Affairs Officer, St. Joseph's Hospital, Denver,Colorado: \"We had two patients who had traditional CJD, not related to BSEor new variant CJD.WHEN WERE THERE SYMPTOMS CLEARLY CJD?Both patients were determined to have CJD by brain biopsy.HOW LONG AGO?One was in December and one was in January.DECEMBER 2000 AND JANUARY 2001.Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE BRAIN BIOPSIES WERE DONE AFTER THEIR DEATHS?No. They were both done prior.CJD WAS CONFIRMED. WHAT WERE THEIR AGES?I don't have that information.ONE OF THE TELEVISION REPORTS SAID THAT ONE WAS ATEENAGER.No. No. I can tell you they were between 50 and 70 in the traditional age rangewhere traditional CJD usually occurs. I don't know the specific ages.THE REASON THAT YOU HELD THE PRESS CONFERENCE?We were getting calls from people saying that they heard we had Mad CowDisease at St. Joseph's Hospital which was not true. So one reason we held thepress conference was to be sure that people understood that there was not MadCow disease, but Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease - every indication being that it wasthe traditional disease that occurs in about one in a million throughout thepopulation.THERE HAVE BEEN THREE CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE DEATHSNOW IN COLORADO THAT I'M AWARE OF - ONE IN BOULDER INJANUARY. IT WAS IN THE PAPER THERE. AND NOW YOU HAVE THESETWO. THAT'S THREE REPORTS OF CJD IN A THREE TO FOUR MONTHPERIOD IN THE SAME STATE IN THE SAME AREA.I'm not a clinician so I can't talk about that. It's my understanding that it's notunusual in a rare disease to see sometimes a disease happen like that.ONE OF THE REASONS THAT PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED IS THAT THEPRION PROTEIN IS AT THE ROOT OF ALL THESE DISEASES. THE BSEIN COWS AND HUMANS IN EUROPE, CREUTZFELDT-JAKOBWHEREVER IT IS IN THE WORLD, THE CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE INDEER AND ELK IN NORTH AMERICA, THE KURU DISEASE IN THEPACIFIC. THEY ARE ALL PRION PROTEINS. SO THAT IS THE COMMONDENOMINATOR. NO ONE REALLY UNDERSTANDS THETRANSMISSION. AND IF I UNDERSTAND FURTHER, THE SAMESURGICAL INSTRUMENTS WERE USED IN DECEMBER AND JANUARYON THE BRAINS OF YOUR TWO PATIENTS.That's not the case. Those two patients, their disease was in no related. The firstcase, the CJD was not suspected at the time of the biopsy. So, those instrumentswere sterilized and re-used.IN AUTOCLAVES?No, I cannot tell you because I am not a clinician. I cannot go into the detailabout the sterilization. I can tell you the sterilization procedures are state of theart and that they are very stringent sterilization procedures. So we are nottalking about minimal sterilization.THE PHONE CALL I GOT WAS THAT SIX OTHER PEOPLE WEREOPERATED ON WITH THE SAME SCALPELS?That is what we said.WHAT DID YOU SAY AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE?We said that we had told six other people that we don't know positively thatthey were exposed. We think there may be a very slight possibility of exposure.BECAUSE THE SAME INSTRUMENTS FROM BIOPSIES WERE USEDFROM ONE PATIENT TO ANOTHER?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yes. But the second patient who had CJD was not related to that issue at all.WHY? WHAT WAS DIFFERENT WITH THE SECOND PATIENT?The patient was admitted with suspected CJD that was confirmed by biopsy, butthat patient had no relationship to those other incidents. That patient wasadmitted after those instruments had been taken out of use.IS ST. JOSEPH'S USING WHAT EUROPE HAS BEEN USING THAT ANYINSTRUMENTS THAT ARE USED IN A PATIENT WITH PRION DISEASEARE LITERALLY DISCARDED AND THROWN AWAY?They are destroyed.\"More Information:The McDonald's fast food corporation which has more than 28,000 restaurantsworldwide warns that its 2001 first-quarter earnings have fallen because of theMad Cow disease scare in Europe.
