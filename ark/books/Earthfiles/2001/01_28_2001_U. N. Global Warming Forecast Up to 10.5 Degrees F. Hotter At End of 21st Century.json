Hotter At End of 21st Century© 2001 by Linda Moulton Howe Lightening in violent thunderstorm courtesy National Severe Storm Center, Norman,Oklahoma.\"The idea of having a planet that really warmed 10 degreesFahrenheit is rather baffling. That's the same change wesaw back to the last Ice Age. And obviously that was ahugely different kind of world to live on. So, if we reallyexperience something at that high end of temperaturewarming, it sounds like there is a possibility forwidespread disaster.\"- Drew Shindell, Ph.D., Atmospheric Physicist,NASA/GISSJanuary 28, 2001 New York City The largest decline in a mammal populationever recorded by modern scientists has occurred in the otter population of theAleutian Islands off the west coast of Alaska. In the 1980s, as many as 100,000otters inhabited the islands. Today, there are only about 6,000 left. And 70% ofthat decline occurred between 1992 and 2000, a rate of decline that scientistssay is unprecedented for any mammal population in the world. Researchers havebeen trying to find out what happened. And the answer seems to be globalwarming. Warmer ocean currents in the Aleutians have driven out the hugepopulation of seals and sea lions that used to be the staple food of killer whales.When the seals and sea lions disappeared, the whales turned to otters for food.As water temperatures increased, so did the salmon population. Salmon haveattracted sharks. So, in a few short years a warmer water temperature hastransformed the once safe mammal sanctuary of the Aleutian Islands into afeeding ground for predators.Just how bad could global warming be over the next several decades? This pastweek, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change releaseda 1000 page volume entitled \"Climate Chnage 2001: The Scientific Basis\" aboutwhat could happen based on computer projections from atmospheric physics"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"laboratories around the world. The study has taken five years of new data andinput from global scientists to help understand what the consequences ofgreenhouse gas build up will be. The bottom line is that every computer modelprojects the same outcome: this planet will steadily warm up over the nexthundred years from 3 to 10.5 degrees Fahrenheit.To put those numbers in perspective: Scientists thought it was alarming to learnthat in the 20th century the global annual mean temperature had risen 1 degreeFahrenheit. That means all the world's sophisticated climate modelingcomputers agree that the next hundred years could warm three to ten times asmuch. Greater extremes of drought and flooding along with accelerated sea levelrise are some of the consequences.Oklahoma drought courtesy Farm Security Administration.Feather River flood in Yuba County, Calif., January 4, 1997.Photograph © 1997 by California Dep. of Water Resources.I discussed the climate change report with Dr. Drew Shindell, AssociateResearch Scientist for Global Climate Change at the NASA Goddard Institutefor Space Studies known as GISS. He is also Adjunct Research Scientist at theCenter for Climate Systems Research at Columbia University's Dept. of Earthand Environmental Sciences in New York City.Interview:Drew Shindell, Ph.D., Atmospheric Physicist and Associate ResearchScientist for Global Climate Change at the NASA Goddard Institute forSpace Studies (GISS): \"It's a frightening thought if we were to really hit thehigh end in the projections. And there is a lot of uncertainty, so we end up witha range from a maximum of 10.5 degrees or so down to only a few degrees. Buteven the lower end is still quite a large amount of warming and a few degreeswarmer is more than we saw during the 20th C. The possibility for changes insomething like rainfall especially is rather alarming. Rainfall is a very difficultthing to predict, or precipitation in general. But most of the models indicate thatthe largest decreases in rainfall would be in the tropical areas which are alreadyrather limited in the amount of rain they get."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"What we are talking about is that the areas up in the north and mid latitudeswhere the countries are fairly well developed and can cope more readily withclimate change would not suffer nearly as much as the developing world whichwould be large changes in precipitation, more droughts, more floods, a lot moreweather extremes. And of course, those areas are not well equipped to cope withthat. So we see a lot of possibility for the developing world to suffer much moresevere weather and damage to crop yields especially which is a frightening thing.WHERE FOOD IS ALREADY A PROBLEM, FOOD WOULD BECOMEA GREATER PROBLEM.Exactly. And the infrastructure in those countries are the least equipped to copewith that kind of change. Just having a warmer planet means that the water inthe oceans will expand just because the air is warmer and the water itselfbecomes warmer. There is also the possibility of the melting of ice sheets in thepolar regions which is quite uncertain. If such a thing were to take place and allof that water that's now locked up in the fresh water in the big ice sheets were toslide into the ocean, we would have a much larger rise in sea level. But evenwithout that, it seems extremely likely that sea level will continue to rise as ithas been doing during the 20th century just due to the thermal expansion ofheating the water. So that is one quite probable outcome or impact of thewarming temperatures.WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AT LEAST A 3 FOOT SEA LEVEL RISEAND IF THERE WAS A 10.5 FAHRENHEIT INCREASE GLOBALLY INTHE NEXT 100 YEARS, THAT THREE FEET RISE MIGHT GO FIVETIMES HIGHER?It could be something like that. It could be a very large increase. That wouldrequire something like a very large melting of the ice sheet in Greenland or avery large portion of the ice sheet over Antarctica sliding into the ocean. Theseare things we don't have a lot of confidence in our ability to predict.IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THE GENERAL CONSENSUS OFSCIENTISTS WHO ARE STUDYING CLIMATE CHANGE TODAY ISTHAT WE ARE IN A GLOBAL WARMING TREND IN WHICH WE DONOT HAVE ANY DATA TO SUGGEST THAT THAT GLOBALWARMING WILL END OVER THE NEXT 100 YEARS?I think that is quite accurate. I think the data that we have is quite clear inshowing that the surface temperatures and temperatures in much of the loweratmosphere have increased. I think the majority of evidence in all scientists'minds points to human activities as having been responsible for a large portionof this increase. And we don't see any likely drastic change in these activitiesand furthermore, there is a large time lag of several decades in how long it takesfor the entire planet to respond to the changes. So, we're still going to be feelingthe effects of what we did in the 20th C. when we know there were very largeemissions of greenhouse gasses well into the 21st C. regardless of what we do inthe 21st. So, I think most people, most scientists would agree, that almost allscientists would agree that the earth is almost without question is going to warmduring the 21st C.WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO LOOK AT THIS WINTER OF2001 AND SAY THIS IS AS COLD AS IT'S BEEN IN 10 YEARS ORWHATEVER AND THEREFORE, THERE IS NO GLOBAL WARMING?One year or even several years don't prove the point. It's a long-term trend inclimate that we're worried about rather than short term fluctuations of theweather. And just as the warm years of 1998 and 1997 and 1999 which were allrecord warm years. Those didn't prove by themselves global warming. So, theyear 2000 being a cold winter, doesn't prove there is no such thing as globalwarming. It's a long term change that we're interested in here.WHEN YOU ARE CONSIDERING 3 TO 10 DEGREES WITH AS MUCHAS YOU KNOW ABOUT CLIMATE AND ATMOSPHERIC PHYSICS,AND YOU ARE SITTING THERE AS A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL ONTHE EARTH AND YOU ARE CONTEMPLATING A 10 DEGREE"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CHANGE AS A POSSIBILITY OVER THE NEXT 100 YEARS, WHAT ISYOUR PERSONAL REACTION TO THAT?Well, my personal reaction is that I hope we don't end up at the high extremeand I hope that either the range of model results. The idea of having a planetthat really warmed 10 degrees is rather baffling. That's the same change we sawback to the last Ice Age. And obviously that was a hugely different kind of worldto live on. So, if we really experience something at that high end (of globaltemperature increase), it sounds like there is a possibility for widespreaddisaster.DO YOU GET TOGETHER WITH POLITICAL LEADERS WHO ASKSOME OF YOU TO COME AND DISCUSS WHAT THE REALISTICCONSEQUENCES OF 3 FEET OR ABOVE SEA LEVEL RISE WOULDDO TO THE COAST LINE AND WOULD OFFICES LIKE FEMA HAVETO CONTEMPLATE THERE MAY HAVE TO BE EVACUATIONSFROM COAST LINES?Well, I think agencies from around the U. S. are beginning to become moreaware that they should consider adaptation strategies to the things that weconsider more likely outcomes. And one example of that is the AmericanNational Assessment of the Impact of Climate Change that came out last yearand was designed to have scientists to work in partnership with local agenciesand governmental bodies to try to decide about the possible impacts and whatkinds of things we need to worry about. One example here in New York is thatwe worked with the Port Authority that runs a lot of transportation facilities andtried to look at what might happen to the ability of trains, tunnels and so on assea level rose around the harbor. So, I think people are starting to look at thepossible consequences and try to figure out ways they can adapt by anticipatingwhat's likely to go wrong.COULD NEW YORK END UP HAVING TO HAVE DIKES BUILT UPAROUND IT LIKE HOLLAND?Well, certainly some areas quite low to the water would be likely to either gounder or have to be protected.ARE THEY TALKING ABOUT DIKES?I don't think that is something that's going to happen in the immediate future, butI think protecting at least crucial areas of infrastructure is something they arestarting to plan for.WHICH MEANS THERE IS ENOUGH OF A WATER RISE TO BEPOLITICALLY CONCERNING.Yes, I think so. It's quite clear that sea level has risen during the 20th C. And thisrise in sea level is something that we have a great deal of confidence in ourability to predict, assuming we know the temperature change. So, if you assumea 3 to 10 degree warming, it's quite easy to say what that will do to water. And ifyou stick water on your oven, you can warm it up by a few degrees and measurequite easily it expanded. So, it's quite a straightforward process.RIGHT, AS WATER INCREASES IN TEMPERATURE, IT EXPANDSAND THEREFORE, IT GETS HIGHER.That's right and that's something we fully understand, so we can predict withpretty high confidence what will go on.IN THE PAST COUPLE OF WEEKS PRIOR TO THE RELEASE OFTHE U. N. INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGEPRESS RELEASE, SOME PEOPLE SAITHAT GLOBAL WARMING ISPHONY, GLOBAL WARMING IS NOT REAL. WHERE DO YOUPERSONALLY THINK THOSE KINDS OF STORIES AND HEADLINESCOME FROM?There are a few scientists out there which legitimately question some of theuncertainties and are not convinced that global warming is due to humanimpacts. Part of the scientific process is that not everybody agrees with anyparticular. proposed theory or explanation for any given thing. But eventually,we tend to come to a consensus and the vast majority of scientists working inthis area are now quite convinced that in fact the global warming we have been"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"seeing is most likely due to human activities.There is also a group of people who do not publish in credible scientificliterature who make personal attacks on authors, attack the scientific process ingeneral as being biased, and generally it seems to me these people have apolitical agenda which is overriding their desire to really evaluate what thescientific evidence is saying.\"More Information:The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) hasproduced a 3-volume report. The first volume concerns the science of climatechange with an evaluation of data from past climate information and projectionsof future climate. It has been summarized in 18 pages at the websitehttp://www.ipcc.ch based in Switzerland. The other two volumes detailassumptions about human impacts such as industrial and agricultural emissionsthat go into making projections about what could happen in 21st Centuryclimate change.U. N. Also Reports Global Warming May Be Especially Hard On AfricaKlaus Toepfer, Executive Director of the U. N. Environment Program (UNEP)told reporters, \"It is a very dramatic situation. The evidence is absolutely clearthat the speed of global warming is going faster and faster. Africa's share of theglobal population is 14%, but it is responsible for only 3.2% of global carbondioxide emission. Yet, (Africans) face the most direct consequences with regardto extreme weather conditions with regard to drought and storms.\"An example of those weather extremes occurred in 2000.
