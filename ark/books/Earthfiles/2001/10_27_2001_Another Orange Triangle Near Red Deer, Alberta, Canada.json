It would take just over one fingerwidth to cover it from the ground looking up at it. (If finger tip extended at armslength.) And there wasn't a sound. No other lights or anything. It went justsmoothly, so nice through the sky.HOW HIGH ABOVE YOU DO YOU THINK IT WAS?I can't tell distance, really, but probably about 5,000 feet. Like it flies higherthan the birds do, but it's lower than jets are.BUT THIS TIME INSTEAD OF BEING A COMPLETELY SOLIDTRIANGLE, IT HAD THIS ORANGE LIGHT MORE AROUND THEEDGES?Yeah, like it glowed in the middle, but the outside edge was more prominentthan the rest of it.HOW LONG DID YOU SEE IT?We watched it for probably 15 seconds. Once in a life time is something to seethese things, but to see them four times in two months is just like mind boggling!I'm really glad we got to see them again! Because now that I've seen them, I wantto see them again.AND WHAT IS IN THEM?Yeah, what is in them and what are they doing and what are they looking for? Isthere something they know that the rest of us don't know? Are they good? Arethey bad? You know. Are they laughing us because we are letting our world goto pot, or what?\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
