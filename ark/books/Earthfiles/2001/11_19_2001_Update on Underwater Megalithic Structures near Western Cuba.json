C., Canada and Havana, Cuba, announced the discovery of megalithicstructures 2,200 feet down at the western tip of Cuba.November 19, 2001 Havana, Cuba - The story about a possible megalithic sitehalf a mile down off the western tip of Cuba first broke this past May when aReuters News Service reporter interviewed the deep ocean engineer who firstreported unusual sidescan sonar of the discovery. Her name is Paulina Zelitsky.Ms. Zelitsky was born in Poland, studied engineering in the Soviet Union, wasassigned to work on a secret submarine base in Cuba during the Cold War, andeventually defected to Canada. There she met her current husband, businessmanPaul Weinzweig. Now the couple own and operate a company called AdvancedDigital Communications, or ADC, with offices in both Victoria, BritishColumbia, and Havana, Cuba. Their specialty is deep ocean exploration. ADCmade news in November 2000 when Paulina Zelitsky found the wreckage of thefamous U.S.S. Maine that blew up and sank in 1898. It was three miles off theHavana coast and two-thirds of a mile down. Her team videotaped the battleshipwhich matched old photographs.Now this year, Ms. Zelitsky reports that about 2,200 feet off Cuba's western tipshe has found \"a huge land plateau with clear images of what appears to bemanmade large-size architectural designs partly covered by sand. From above,the shapes resemble pyramids, roads and buildings.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Mayan Acropolis at Piedras Negras, Guatemala.Drawing by Tatiana Proskouriakoff from Breaking the Maya Code © 1992 by Michael D.Coe.This week I talked with both Paulina Zelitsky and Paul Weinzweig and learnedthat in addition to the sonar images, this late summer they were able to get somelight and a videotape camera down to the underwater site in a Remote OperatedVehicle known as an ROV. Over the past several months, I have had anagreement with Mr. Weinzweig in which I can discuss their progress with thesite, but will only report publicly when I have permission. The following is theportion of our most recent discussion on the record for broadcast that includesthe surprise of Paulina Zelitsky joining the interview.Interview:Paul Weinzweig, Partner, Advanced Digital Communications, Victoria,British Columbia, Canada: \"IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU CANSAY ON THE RECORD THIS MORNING THAT I CAN DO SOMEKIND OF AN UPDATE?For the record you can say that the Center for Marine Archaeology andAnthropology at the Cuban Academy of Sciences is currently analyzing videodata which we have from the perimeter of the site from megalithic stones. Theyare working on inscriptions that they have detected on these stones and they areanalyzing them at this time.WHAT ARE THE ESTIMATED SIZES OF THESE STONES?The estimated sizes of these stones - they are roughly about two by five meters.Very large stones. That's about six feet by fifteen or sixteen feet, something likethat (six feet on each of four sides and sixteen feet high).YOU MENTIONED POSSIBLY THE SAME KIND OF LOOK AS THEPERIMETER STONES AT STONEHENGE? THAT KIND OFRECTANGULAR LOOKING?Yes, the same kind of stone that you see on Easter Island and in Stonehenge.Very large and smooth and light colored that bear no relationship to thesurrounding ecology. And also there is evidence of smooth cut and fit, that isone on top of another, as if the basis of a pyramid or large building.ON THOSE STONES, WHERE ARE THE POSSIBLE INSCRIPTIONS?YOU KNOW, LIKE TOP OR BOTTOM OR MIDDLE OR?They are not anywhere specific on the stones, these inscriptions. They could bein the middle of the stones and various parts of the stones across. One thing wefound, the anthropologist found, was an American cross. It's a Central Americancross.IS THAT WHERE TWO LINES ARE CROSSED PERPENDICULAR TO"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"EACH OTHER WITH ANYTHING SPECIAL ON THE ENDS?No. They are not two lines. They are two oval shapes crossing each other.TWO LONG OVALS CROSSING EACH OTHER THE WAY A CROSSCROSSES?Yes, The way a cross crosses, only the shape is not a single line. It is a flattenedcircle.DO THESE SO FAR FROM WHAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON THE VIDEOSEEM TO BE INSCRIBED INTO THE STONE LIKE A QUARTER OFAN INCH OR HALF AN INCH?Yes, we can't tell really the depth. There is limited lighting and limitedperspective as well because of the - we had technical problems with the ROV.IT IS REALLY DARK AT A HALF MILE DOWN, ISN'T IT?Well, there is no light at all except for what we provide.SO YOU ARE LIMITED IN ONLY WHAT YOU CAN GET IN THATLIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU?That's OK. We have good lighting now and we have a low light camera to add toour two or three other cameras we have there as well. To our zoom camera andwe have several cameras that work down there and we have good lighting.There was a lot of debris in the water at that time, created by a strong current,probably by plankton.WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GO DOWN WITHALL THE CAMERAS FUNCTIONING?Well, hopefully, if we get all our systems back together within the next twomonths and we get a break in the weather.THE MUSEUM THAT IS TRYING TO ANALYZE THESE CARVEDINSCRIPTIONS YOU HAVE SEEN SO FAR, HAVE YOU HAD ANYINDICATION THAT THEY THINK IT MATCHES ANY KNOWNANCIENT SCRIPT?We don't have any conclusions yet. They are, the analysis is still in process.HAVE THEY MADE ANY COMMENT ABOUT THEM, THE SYMBOLSOR CARVINGS?Greek-like inscriptions.GREEK LIKE?Well, hieroglyphic-like inscriptions.HIEROGLYPHIC LIKE EGYPT?I said the lettering is Greek-like. Hold on just a minute. Why don't you talk tomy boss.OK, I WOULD LOVE TO.Her name is Paulina Zelitsky.Paulina Zelitsky, Ocean Engineer, Advanced Digital Communications,Havana, Cuba: Hi, Linda.HELLO. I'M SO HAPPY TO MEET YOU ON THE PHONE.Yes, thank you. I was overhearing my husband and I don't want you to make anybad mistakes mixing Greek, because it is not Greek. It has the same tendency,but it is not Greek. We don't know what it is and scientists are trying to decipherit.RIGHT. IT HAS SOME RESEMBLANCE IN LETTERING TO GREEK,BUT IS NOT GREEK. AND THERE ARE SOME LIKE PICTOGRAPHS"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THAT WOULD FALL INTO THE HIEROGLYPHIC CATEGORY ASWELL?Yes, and symbols as well. There are different signs, more like American nature,like they have found in Central America. Pyramids. And strong delineation ofthe structures which suggest pyramidal type, American pyramidal type, notEgyptian pyramidal type.YOU MEAN BY THE GLYPH SYMBOLS THAT WOULD BE FOUND INMESOAMERICAN PYRAMIDS?Ye s .AN EXAMPLE IS THAT CROSS MADE OF OVALS CROSSING EACHOTHER?That's an example. That's correct. And that type of cross is called an Americancross. We find it in Cuba in a variety of caves and on the island. They are veryancient, pre-Columbian, probably thousands of years before Columbus. Youknow, Cuba has submerged three times in our information of the islands.SO CUBA HAS GONE UNDER THE WATER THREE TIMES?Ye s .IN CAVES UNDERWATER AROUND THE ISLAND, THE AMERICANCROSS HAS BEEN FOUND CARVED?Yes, and other symbology, other cosmic type depictions. And you find this inCuban caves around the island, not only in the south but in the north. Andthose caves are underwater caves. One cave I know of is on land and it has thistype of symbology as well.WHEN ARCHAEOLOGISTS HAVE STUDIED THE CARVINGS IN THECAVES ON CUBA, HAVE THEY BEEN ABLE TO MATCH THOSESYMBOLS AND GLYPHS TO ANY OTHER PRE-EXISTING KNOWNLANGUAGE?They are trying to match it to Central American, but it is distinctive on its own.It's very difficult to say that ancient American symbology is identical to this. It isnot identical. It's similar, but not identical.\"Is There Any Other Culture That Use Crossed Ovals As A Symbol?After hearing about the symbol of crossed ovals and mysterious lettering, Ibegan searching. I called the Archaeology and Anthropology Department at theUniversity of Pennsylvania which has one of the finest collections of Olmec,Mayan and other Mesoamerican artifacts in the world.This weekend I spent several hours searching the library's rare books of Mayanand Mesoamerican glyphs. I could not find a single cross of ovals until I openedup a book called The Language of the Sea Peoples. There in a section comparinghieroglyphs from the Minoan island of Crete with hieroglyphs known as 'LinearC Language\" used by an ancient Minoan culture called 'Luwian,' I found it."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"See crossed ovals next to 186/445 above fromThe Language of the Sea Peoples © 1992 by Fred Woudhuizen.I also found a more complicated crossed oval in Assyrian hieroglyphs.Identified as Assyrian \"solar cross\"in The Mammoth Dictionary of Symbols © 1996 by Nadia Julien.I sent both of those symbols to Paulina Zelitsky for comment. She e-mailed backtwo color photographs she had taken inside a Cuban cave that included yetdifferent crossed symbols.Paulina Zelitsky wrote about the crossed oval symbol above and spirals below:\"The image is from the Cuban Isle of Youth and restored by archeologists. Butthere are a number of similar (Cuban) caves: one in Matanzas and one inQuanacabibe which were not restored. The age of these nobody knows. But thescientific community believes they belong to the 'Sea People.'"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Cuban cave photographs © 2001 by Paulina Zelitsky.How would an ancient Minoan symbol end up a half mile down amid otherapparent megalithic structures off the western tip of Cuba?I took that question to the Editor-In-chief of Ancient American magazine, FrankJoseph. Frank has studied the end of the Bronze Age around 1200 B. C., whichwas three thousand two hundred years ago. He is also the author of a 1998 bookentitled Atlantis In Wisconsin. He has another new book about to be releasedentitled Edgar Cayce's Atlantis and Lemuria. That book will be in stores bythe first of December. And a third book to be released in 2002 is called TheDestruction of Atlantis. Frank Joseph has devoted more than two decades tostudying physical evidence of a global Atlantean culture which he believes wasdestroyed in a worldwide catastrophe in 1200 B. C. that ended the Bronze Age.In the September/October issue of Ancient American magazine, there is a briefarticle entitled 'U. S. Navy Atlantis Cover-up?' It says that on September 7,2001, a team from Spain and the U. S. looking for oil have been \"250 milessouthwest of the Azores equipped with bathescape and two submersiblesresearching a 90-kilometer ledge with a central temple supported by three standsof nine pillars about 3 feet in diameter supporting a flat stone roof about 20 feetwide and 30 feet long. There are the remains of five circular canals and bridges,plus four rings of structures like the temple in between. It is roughly 2,800 feetdeep in the Mid-Atlantic Trench and stable at this time.\" According to theresearchers, when they tried to send photographic images from the site, theirsignals were jammed by a U. S. Naval exercise nearby, perhaps inadvertently.Frank Joseph and I are still trying to confirm this report, but the depth of 2800feet is around that half mile depth in the Cuban site. This weekend I asked Frankabout the crossed oval symbol in the Linear C language of the Luwian.Frank Joseph, Editor-In-Chief, Ancient American, Archaeology of theAmericas before Columbus, Colfax, Wisconsin: \"The Luwians were apeoples who lived about the same time as the Trojans that lived in what is nowTurkey. They were either an ally of the Trojans, a close ally during the TrojanWar and before. Or else in fact, they were Trojans. Some Luwian script hassupposedly been found in Italy and they think that is an important link betweenthe Etruscans and Asia Minor, or what is now Turkey. And the Luwians weremaritime people, very proficient at sea.THIS CROSSED OVAL SYMBOL OF THEIRS RELATED TO WHAT IS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"LETTERED AS 'LU' IS ALSO GOES ACROSS ALL THE COLUMNS INCOMPARISON TO OTHER LANGUAGES WHERE THE SYMBOLAPPEARS TO MEAN 'STAR.\"A star, yeah. But maybe. That \"lu\" that is repeated is like they are identifyingthemselves, the Luwians. They might have called themselves the \"lu.\" It is veryinteresting. That whole cultural context is Atlantean because the Atlanteanswere plugged into the Trojans. The Trojans themselves had a story of Atlantis.Their founder was Dardanus who came from Atlantis. Elektra, when she wassinking into the sea.This is highly complex, thinly woven stuff, you know!!CAN YOU PLEASE SHARE THE STORY FROM THE TROJAN POINTOF VIEW ABOUT ATLANTIS?The Trojans were a people who built their city around 3,000 B. C. And theychose that spot at the Dardanelles because it was a very valuable place for tradebetween the East and the West. You had access then to the Black Sea. Whoevercontrolled the Dardanelles controlled trade. So Troy over time became a verywealthy city.And the myth of Dardanos is that he was born on an island far away to the West.And his mother was Elektra. Her father was Atlas, the name of the island thatAtlantis was on. She was the daughter of Atlas and her mother was Clione.THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT PLATO TALKS ABOUT.And Clione was the sea goddess who produced what is known as the Pleiades.And Pleiades means daughter of Atlas which is Atlantis. That's what Atlantismeans, daughter of Atlas.PLEIADES MEANS DAUGHTER OF ATLAS?Pleiades means daughter of Atlas. It is a poetic way of saying this is on Atlantis.THE FACT THAT THERE COULD HAVE BEEN AN ATLANTIS THATHAD BASES THAT SPREAD ALL THE WAY FROM WEST OF THESTRAITS OF GIBRALTAR THAT MIGHT HAVE INCLUDED THEAZORES, THE CANARY ISLANDS AND DOWN ACROSS THEATLANTIC IS WHAT BEGINS TO EMERGE AS A GREATER TRUTH.Absolutely.NOT ONE SINGLE ISLAND.Right. Now, the relationship between Atlantis and Troy is not the same as therelationship between say Atlantis and the Yucatan, for example, where they hadan allied kingdom. They really owned the Yucatan. Or they would own parts ofIreland and Spain. That was really plugged in tight to the Atlantean Empire.HOW FAR BACK WOULD YOU PUT THIS SINCE PLATO SAYSGOING THROUGH SOLON AND IN THE CRITEAS '9000 YEARS'AND THAT WOULD PLACE IT AT ABOUT 11,500 YEARS AGO?No, that's another story altogether. My colleagues and I have worked very hardsince the 1980s on these dates. And those dates are a mistake, that was a mistakein translation. The Greeks used a calendar that was very similar to ours. Theyused a solar calendar of about 365 days. A standard solar calendar. TheEgyptians used a minimum of five different calendars and their, including a solarcalendar. Their priests and holy places where they had the story of Atlantiswhich was at the holy place called the Temple of Knife in Egypt. They used alunar calendar.We concluded that the Egyptian priest, when he said 9,000 years, is talkingabout lunar years and not solar years. There is abundant evidence to show thatis exactly what he was saying. And the Greeks, when they heard this, theythought solar years. So when Plato all of the numerical values in the Criteas andthe Timaeus are totally inflated beyond reality. They do not work with thedescription that Plato gives. Plato describes a late bronze age citadel or city."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"There was a huge gap in knowledge between Plato's and Solon's time and whathappened in Atlantis. Because we now know that when the Bronze Age stoppedsuddenly around 1200 B. C., that for the next 400 years at least there was aperiod of profound Dark Age. There was no more writing. There was no morebuilding of cities. The population of the world had decreased phenomenally.There was widespread burning. The entire Black Forest of Germany wasincinerated. Every, not virtually, but every known archaeological site in the NearEast and Asia Minor were burned. It is now understood that there was a majorcatastrophe of which Atlantis was only a small part that whipped around theworld in a band literally from about Iceland to oh, say, the middle of NorthAfrica. It affected North America, went right through the Pacific.There was a symposium of archaeo-astronomers back in 1997, not New Agepeople at all, in England, in which they found that probably the greatest naturalcatastrophe human beings ever witnessed was around 1200 B. C. And that waswhen two or more comets, including Haley's Comet, converged in the skies overearth and showered the world with a barrage of asteroids and meteors thatpushed human beings to the brink of extinction.And Atlantis was especially hard hit because there are two Swedish physicists,Thomas Larsson and Lars Franzen, who established in 1997 that severalasteroids - I'm not talking about meteorites - several asteroids! collided in theeastern Atlantic precisely in the location of Atlantis and that is why we canexplain why an island the size of Atlantis which was 6,000 square miles - it wasnot a continent, it was a big island. And it was destroyed. If you have an islandout in the middle of the water and it's hit by several nuclear blasts at once, thechances of that thing being around are slim.WHAT YOU MEAN IS THAT THE IMPACT OF THESE BREAKING ORCOLLIDING ASTEROIDS WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUIVALENT TOATOMIC BOMB FORCES HITTING ON THE ISLAND?Probably H-Bomb forces. And they didn't even have to hit the island itself. Theisland was part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge which is a very unstable part of theplanet geologically. You could have an asteroid collision hundreds of milesaway, but if it hit the Mid-Atlantic Ridge - that's the end of that island.THE BRIEF ARTICLE YOU HAVE IN THE SEPTEMBER TOOCTOBER ISSUE OF ANCIENT AMERICAN ABOUT A SPANISH OILRESEARCH GROUP BEING IN THE AZORES AND FINDING DOWN2800 FEET NINE COLUMNS SUPPORTING SOME KIND OF STONESLAB ROOF....Ye a h !THAT IT MIGHT LITERALLY CONNECT TO THERE HAVING BEENSOME KIND OF STRUCTURE THERE IN THIS 1200 B. C. TIMEFRAME?Yeah, I think so. It works out real well. Unfortunately, I have not been able toverify that report anymore than you have seen. But I would bet that it was partof the 1200 B. C. destruction because it was so massive at that time. We knowfor example that many parts of the world like Britain and Germany lost 9/10thof their population all at once. So, we're dealing with a massive, almost anextinction, human extinction, in various parts of the world all at the same time.And I think that's entirely possible.That would explain also perhaps how this structure now found off Cuba iswhere it is. We understand that possibly that it was part of a much largercomplex. I'm beginning to think that what they are finding there was much largeroriginally, and what they are finding now is only a small part, a remnant, thatwas perhaps on a kind of shelf which sank vertically. That is not impossible.Things like that have been known to happen before in the Atlantic and that thispart remained upright and that's what they are finding.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The EtruscansOne of the most mysterious cultures on earth are known as the Etruscans.Twenty-five hundred years ago they lived in a region of Italy known as Tuscany.No one knew who they were or where they came from. The Etruscans wereskilled sailors and craftsmen and they left behind carved in stone blocks,columns and other artifacts a language that no one has ever been able totranslate. It resembles Greek, but is not Greek.Etruscan lettering carved in stone from the bookThe Language of the Sea Peoples © 1992 by Fred Woudhuizen.Frank Joseph: \"I haven't seen what they found down there. It sounds like if itlooks Greek, but isn't Greek, that might be that it's Etruscan. I'm not saying thesite underwater is an Etruscan site. That's probably unlikely. The Etruscans didnot build things that look like Teotihuacan, that's for sure! But the Etruscans,where did they get their written language? It's possible that what we're looking atin Etruscan is a variation of the Atlantean language.We don't know what the Atlantean written language looks like. But it appears tobe the precursor, not just of Greek, but other written languages in other parts ofthe world. So, it's possible that if they look to Etruscan, they might be able tosee some similarities. That's not much help though. Even if they identify it asEtruscan, they won't be able to read it because the Etruscan written language asnot yet been deciphered. They've gotten some names off it and little snatches ofthings, but the language itself is really bizarre because it is a Greek type writtenlanguage, but the language itself is more like Turkish or something. It's reallyvery perplexing.The Etruscans are far more directly connected to Atlantis because Plato in hisdiscussion of Atlantis mentions the Etruscans specifically as being an outpost of"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Atlantis, that the Atlanteans came to western Italy and set up their estate thereand sort of inter-married with the people and created what became known as theEtruscans.FROM THE WORK YOU HAVE DONE ON ATLANTIS RESEARCH -AND I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY YOU ARE CONVINCED THATPLATO'S DESCRIPTION AND HERODITUS OF THIS ATLANTEANCIVILIZATION THAT IT REALLY DID EXIST. WHAT DO YOU KNOWABOUT THE ATLANTEAN CULTURE IN THAT PERIOD FROM 3,000TO 1200 B. C. BASED ON WHAT YOU'VE STUDIED?What I can tell you is that the Atlanteans who developed on an island outsidethe Straits of Gibralter developed an extremely powerful sea civilization. Theywere great seafarers. Plato described the Atlanteans as great seafarers and greatminers. And that works out extremely well with the copper mining that tookplace in North America - I'm not going to get into that, but there was a majorcopper mining enterprise that involved a minimum of half a billion pounds ofraw copper being removed and disappearing during that time period. And Ibelieve the Atlanteans fit the bill for that.THIS WAS THE 5,000 MINES OF THE NORTHERN PENINSULA OFMICHIGAN THAT ARE EACH ABOUT 60 FEET DEEP?Well, the average depth is probably like 20 feet deep for the pit mines, but therewere many pit mines that were excavated through solid rock 60 feet down. So,whoever did that obviously had a technology far beyond anything that wasknown to the native Americans at that time who were not interested in anythingmore than float copper, copper they picked up off the ground. But this is one ofthe great - I hate to use the word conspiracy, but it certainly is suppressedevidence that American scholars have known about for more than 100 years thatthere was a huge copper mining enterprise in upper Michigan that lasted from3,000 B. C. to 1,200 B. C. - those magic dates again - in which a minimum ofhalf a billion pounds of the world's highest grade copper was excavated anddisappeared.Meanwhile on the opposite side of the world, the Bronze Age erupts and bronzeis only made through high grade copper combined with zinc and tin. So, I thinkthat what Plato was talking about are these ancient copper miners who wereable to mine through their tremendous technological development and ship thishuge prodigious amount of raw copper to Europe where it became themerchants, the copper barons, of the ancient world and that is what made themso phenomenally wealthy and powerful.AN INTERESTING POSSIBLE DISCOVERY IN THIS UNDERWATERMEGALITHIC SITE THAT'S UNDER RESEARCH IS THAT IN SOMEOF THE SONAR DATA, NOT THE VIDEOTAPE, BUT THE SONARDATA, THERE ARE SOME RETURNS THAT SUGGEST THAT THEREMIGHT BE METAL, LIKE METAL ON THE TOPS ON SOME OF THEOBJECTS. WOULD THE USE OF METAL AS SHEETING ONSTRUCTURES BE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE ASSOCIATEDWITH THE RESEARCH ON ATLANTIS?Well, now we are getting really close to the Atlantean realm. Plato tells us thatat the height of their prosperity to show off their wealth, would actually sheettheir outer walls of the city with great sheets of what he called 'orichalcum.'Orichalcum means nothing more than high grade copper which didn't exist inEurope in large numbers like North America. So, here were people who used adesign technique, an architectural technique of including sheets of preciousmetal in their walls and now we are finding this supposedly at a site underwateroff of Cuba. I would say now we are beginning to narrow in on a culturalcommonality."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Map of Atlantis based on Plato's descriptions, published in the New York Americanon October 20, 1912 from Imagining Atlantis © 1998 by Richard Ellis.FRANK, WHERE DO YOU THINK ALL OF THIS IS HEADED?I know exactly where it is headed. Some time this century, the greatestarchaeological find in history is going to be made when identifiable remains ofAtlantis are going to be found. And the beginnings of that began in 1968 whenthey found the Bimini road or wall or whatever they refer to it as. It's still highlycontroversial, but that place has been thoroughly established as artifactual. Thestructure in Cuba may be part of that. It's very possible it's part of it.They are bread crumbs on the trail and the final discovery of Atlantis is going tobe made because the technology now for underwater research is developing atsuch an extent they are turning the oceans transparent. And what's under theoceans, what's actually hidden under the silt. And I think a lot of Atlantis is notonly buried under the water, but under the silt and so on. That discovery isgoing to be made. That's where it's headed, hopefully in our life time, but Iwould say definitely in the 21st century Atlantis will be found. I am reallyconfident that is going to happen.WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ACADEMIC WORLD THEN?It is stood on its ear because the academic world has been demanding for the last100 years that anybody who believed in Atlantis believes in fantasy, they don'tknow what they are talking about, they are very unscientific. And beyond that,they say civilization just began 5,000 years ago very slowly in Mesopotamiabetween the Tigris and Euphrates. Well, all of that is going to have to be thrownout! We are going to be looking at something completely different now. In otherwords, all of the textbooks, our entire concept of where we came from is goingto have to be changed.\"We b s it e s :http://www.knowledge.co.uk/sis/cambproc.htmhttp://www.ancientamerican.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
