Bobbink and his uncle, Robert Boerman,first visited the site soon after discovery to measure and sample plants. In addition to theirdiagram around August 1, the aerial photograph also shows eight circles in the tail. August 9, 2001 Stadskanaal, Holland On August 1, 2001, Robert Boerman, cropcircle researcher and producer of a Netherlands website, www.dcca.nl, received areport of a new formation in Stadskanaal shaped like a \"scorpion\" with an eightcircle tail. This was the second formation in the 2001 season discovered inStadskanaal. Boerman went to the farm owned by J. A. Adams with his nephew,Jan Willem Bobbink, to measure and sample crop. Jan Willem used dowsing rodsto determine energy ley lines. He drew a black and white diagram of the \"scorpion\"and the energy lines in red shown above. Boerman and Bobbink thought theformation was at least a week old at the time and concluded it first emerged aroundJuly 24, 2001.A week after that first visit, Dutch physicist Eltjo Haselhoff, Chairman of the Dutch"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CCCS crop circle research organization, called Boerman to ask about another visitso that Eltjo could do his own sampling and measurements. So, on Tuesday,August 7, 2001, Boerman and his nephew, Bobbink, returned to the latestStadskanaal formation with Haselhoff.In his website report about what happened, Robert Boerman wrote: \"After we wereready with the sampling, we took some nice photos (of) ourselves for the archiveand I had to go to the tail to take some pole shots of the head of the formation.When I entered the 8th circle, I was stupefied to see that there was a brand newcircle added to the tail! I counted and re-counted the circles of the tail. There were9 circles instead of the 8 we counted before. During our research, there was anextra circle added. Just like that, and we didn't see or hear anything. About tenminutes before, Jan Willem had taken some samples from the last circle, the 8th ofthe tail, and he didn't see a new circle. He is 200% sure that there wasn't a newcircle at that time.\"Pole shot of the \"scorpion\" crop formation tail photographed by Robert Boermanduring his first trip to Stadskanaal August 2, 2001.

We found some blown (growth) nodesand we think, 'That's nice that we find something like that.''"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Blown node in a wheat stem found in the \"scorpion\" formation at Stadskanaal, Holland.Photograph © 2001 by Jan Willem Bobbink. See his website below.Biophysicist W. C. Levengood of Michigan was the first scientist to study cropformation plants and report in the respected botany journal, PhysiologiaPlantarum, that one of the physical effects found repeatedly in unusual cropformations were brown holes in growth nodes that he linked to heating of plant cellwater by microwave energy causing the cell water to explode from the growthnodes. Biophysicist Levengood's hypothesis is that a \"spinning plasma vortex\" ofcomplex energies including microwaves interacts with plants when the formationsoccur, but he does not yet know the source of the spinning plasma vortices.'The second day when we entered the formation together with Eltjo Hasselhoff andmy nephew, Jan Willem Bobbink, we did some samplings as Eltjo Hasselhoff does.We measured again the complete formation which was about 40 meters (130 feet)long and the largest head ring was about 22 meters (72 feet) in diameter.ACCORDING TO THE NETHERLANDS NEWSPAPER Het Nieuwsblad Van HetNoorden, SOMETHING UNUSUAL HAPPENED TO YOUR BODIES. WHATHAPPENED?My nephew was again at the tail of the formation to take some samples in the 8thcircle, the last circle of the tail. He came back to us, Eltjo and me, and we decided,'OK, gu ys, we h ave go t everyt h in g. Let 's go h o me.'Then I had the feeling that I had to go again into the formation to take some poleshots (camera up on a pole to image more from above) and I walked to the tail. Isaid, 'What is this? A ninth circle!' A complete new circle appeared there during ourresearch.Ninth new circle added to the \"scorpion's\" previoustail of eight circles at Stadskanaal, Hollandaround 3 p.m. on August 7, 2001.Photograph © 2001 by Robert Boerman."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Center of eighth circle previously at the end of the \"scorpion's\" tailbefore the ninth circleappeared on August 7, 2001.Photograph © 2001 by Robert Boerman.DID YOU HAVE SOME PHYSICAL EXPERIENCES ON YOUR ARMS ANDLEGS?Yes, when I saw the 9th circle, I was completely astonished. I counted andrecounted the circles in the tail and there were nine, including the new one. Then Ishouted to Eltjo, 'Come over here. A new circle!' And he looked very amazed. Thenwe took some photos and one or two minutes later, I feel a pain in my legs.PAIN?Ye s .WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE PAIN IN YOUR LEGS WAS PRICKLY, OR LIKEA NUMB FEELING OR LIKE A HOT FEELING OR...?Like prickling feeling. I don't remember it very good because we were completelyastonished about the discovery of the new circle. And then the feeling that I had togo out of the field. I don't know why, but I just ran out of the field. And then about30 minutes later we entered the formation again and then my legs feel OK. The painwas gone.AND WAS IT IN YOUR ARMS AS WELL?Eltjo had it in his left arm and left wrist and I feel it in both my legs up to myknees.YOU KNEW YOU HAD TO GET OUT OF THE FIELD? DID ELTJO FEEL THESAME WAY?No, Eltjo was only completely astonished as a Dutch scientist. He said, 'Wow, itcannot be!'THAT IT COULD NOT HAPPEN WHILE YOU WERE RIGHT THERE?Right, it cannot be.AND YOU HAD NOT SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING UNUSUAL?We had not seen or heard anything abnormal. Nothing.YOU GO BACK A HALF HOUR LATER AND YOU FEEL BETTER, HOWDOES THIS CIRCLE LOOK IN TERMS OF THE WAY THE CROP WAS LAIDDOWN COMPARED TO THE OTHER EIGHT PREVIOUS CIRCLES?Beautiful! Really, it was a beautiful circle. A diameter of about 1.40 meters (4.5feet). And the center of the circle was standing crop, but it was bent inside thecenter, bent down.DID THE NEW 9TH CIRCLE CROP SEEM TO BE LAID DOWN MORESMOOTHLY OR MORE FLUIDLY?Yes. Yes. You looked at the other circles and they were about a week and a halfold. But the new one, it looked real nice. Very beautiful."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"AND DID YOU TOUCH THE PLANTS AND SOILS IMMEDIATELY WHENYOU DISCOVERED THE CIRCLE AND NOTICE ANY HEAT?My nephew, Jan Willem, he felt with his hands and he told us that they felt warm. Itried, but I was completely astonished so I didn't feel it. But he told me it felt warm.And then I had the feeling that I had to go (because of the leg pain). So I didn't feelit any more.DID ELTJO, A PHYSICIST, DID HE FEEL THE PLANTS AND SOIL ANDNOTICE ANY HEAT?I thought he said to me that he felt warmth also. We were just looking at each otherand saying, 'It is impossible!' That is the only thing we could say. This can't behappening while we were there. This is impossible. So we didn't talk about how itmaybe came there or what reason or how or why. We just looked at each other andsaid, 'This can't be!'But we are working on a theory that we think can explain the blown nodes, howthe crop is laid down, how it is bent, how it is broken, the balls of light.IS IT CONSISTENT WITH DR. LEVENGOOD'S WORK THAT DESCRIBES ASPINNING PLASMA VORTEX THAT HAS MICROWAVE ENERGY IN IT THATINTERACTS WITH THE CROPS AND THE SOIL?Yes. We think we know why most of the worldwide crop circles appear in England.BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH LIMESTONE THERE?Yes. That's one of the reasons you get.BEYOND THE LIMESTONE AND CHALK, WHAT DO YOU THINK ISRESPONSIBLE FOR, OR BEHIND, THE CREATION OF THE SPINNINGPLASMA VORTICES?That we try to find out. We will finish our theory this winter and the next step isnext year to do a lot of measurements and research on frequencies and everythingwe can measure inside crop circles.And then the next step is a lot of clues to make a crop circle without entering thefield. That's our next step. If we succeed making a crop circle without entering thefield and we find the blown nodes and all the other stuff, then we know whichtechnique the crop circle makers use. After that, we want to try making formationswithout being in the field.The next step after that is communication and maybe in the future, we meet some ofthe 'guys' (crop circle creators). I don't know, but that's a far away future.DO YOU THINK THIS IS A NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE THAT WOULDFALL INTO THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL CATEGORY? OR AS SOME THINK,THE ANGELIC CATEGORY?I don't know. I don't have the answer to that, but as I said, we will try to finish ourtheory. If we are right, we want to create crop circles out in the field. If we knowthe technique, then the next step is communication. Then maybe we will beallowed to ask, 'OK, guys, who are you?'AND IF YOU CAN DO IT NOT BEING PHYSICALLY ON THE SOIL ANDPLANTS IN THE FIELD, WOULD YOU BE DOING THIS FROM SOMETHINGABOVE THE FIELD PUTTING DOWN A PATTERN OF ENERGY ONTO THEFIELD?Yeah, you can compare it to that.AND I'M ASSUMING IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH RESONANCEFREQUENCIES AROUND THE GLOBE?Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"WHAT DO YOU AND THE PHYSICIST, ELTJO HASELHOFF, THINK IS THECONNECTION BETWEEN THE MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS AND THE CROPFORMATIONS?Eltjo's research connects spherical energies above the crop to plants going down informations. I don't know what the balls of lights are. Maybe it's intelligence that iscontrolled? Or maybe the lights are on their own. I don't know that. But there is arelationship. Absolutely. And as Levengood told us about the plasma vortextheory, it fits exactly our theory.\"We b s it e s :http://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.mysteriesoftheunknown.cjb.netCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
