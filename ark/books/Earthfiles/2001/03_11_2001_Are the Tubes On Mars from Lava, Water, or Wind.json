Spacecraft Altitude was410.24 kilometers.Image by Malin Space Science Systems.March 11, 2001 - Planetary scientists, geophysicists and astrogeologists will begathering in Houston this week to discuss our solar system. It's the 32nd Lunarand Planetary Institute meeting at the Johnson Space Center. One of the mostpuzzling planets is Mars and recently I talked with two scientists who will bepresenting papers about their work on the red planet. Dr. Maria Zuber isProfessor of Geophysics and Planetary Science at MIT in Cambridge,Massachusetts. She is also Deputy Investigator of the Global Topography MapMission now underway on Mars. Dr. Bob Craddock is a geologist at theSmithsonian Institution Center for Earth and Planetary Studies in Washington,D. C.I asked both to look at the above high resolution photograph of unusual surfacefeatures in the Martian northern hemisphere that some have described as \"tube-like.\" In fact, Arthur C. Clarke who wrote 2001 commented that the tube-likefeature is \"one of the most incredible images that's ever come from space andthere have been no official comments on it whatsoever.\" Planetary geologists,however, say there is nothing special to explain because the photographs simply"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"show sand dunes collected along fissures.First, I showed Dr. Craddock from the Smithsonian a wide shot and close-up ofthe Martian area called Acidalia Planitia covered with cracks and fault lines.The strange tubelike features are along some of the cracks.Wide view of Acidalia Planitia region in Mars Northern Hemisphere filled with polygonalcracks.Closer view of polygonal cracks in whichsome tube-like structures have been found.Images from Malin Space Science Systems.Interview:Bob Craddock, Ph.D., Geologist, Smithsonian Institution Center for Earthand Planetary Studies, Washington, D. C.: \"What they look like to me are"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"features called wrinkle ridges. They are actually a pretty common planetaryfeature. For example, we see them in the mare deposits on the moon in the darkoutflows that have occurred on the moon. And the further south from thisparticular south from this particular area is a basin called Chryse Planitia andthere are a number of wrinkled ridges that cross that valley as well. And mostpeople think they are probably due to some sort of compression associated withthe volcanic rise on Mars that is hundreds of kilometers to the west. And this isjust the result of the build up of the build up of stresses on the surface becausethat is such a large topographic structure.THE VOLCANO OLYMPUS MONS?Right, Olympus Mons and the other volcanoes nearby in the Tharsis Montes,there are three that line up. There is a huge extent of volcanic lava flowsassociated with that thing that represents a huge bulge on the planet's surface.And those stresses caused the surrounding crust even for hundreds of kilometersaway to buckle and bend. And those wrinkle ridges, I'm pretty sure continue upinto Acidalia Planitia, too, as a result of the volcanoes. And we're looking at oneof those in detail.Some people think that because they are so common on volcanic material thatthey are indicators of there being some sort of lava flows. But in the case of theNorthern plains, it might actually be sedimentary deposits - as a result of theglobal ocean that a lot of people are proposing. You can get compressionalfeatures like wrinkle ridges in sedimentary material as well.IN LOOKING AT THIS PHOTOGRAPH (M0400291 top of this report) INTHAT BRANCH THAT COMES DOWN TOWARDS THE FAR LOWERRIGHT CORNER, THERE IS WHAT LOOKS LIKE A WHITE DOT ORA REFLECTION ON THERE. WOULD THAT BE A REFLECTION ANDWOULD THAT MEAN THERE WAS SOME KIND OF GLASSYSUBSTANCE THERE?It's probably a camera artifact because this looks like a fairly unprocessed oruncalibrated image. Or it could be the result of some sort of albido. You have alot of different variations in light and dark material on Mars and that could be avery small and fresh impact crater that's just thrown up a bunch of brightmaterial on the surface.COULD YOU EXPLAIN FOR A LAY AUDIENCE HOW THESESTRIATIONS ARE CREATED IF THESE ARE PRESSURE MARKS IN AVOLCANIC SYSTEM?They are pressure marks and some sort of deposit. It could be volcanic. It couldbe sedimentary. But it's essentially a result of the surface buckling from stressesthat are induced - on earth, it could be because two plates come together. OnMars, it could be the result of loading the crust with the formation of volcanoes.So, it's just sort of a response of the surface to those stresses.\" Martian Sand Dunes?DR. MARIA ZUBER, PROFESSOR OF GEOPHYSICS AND PLANETARYSCIENCE AT MIT, SAID SHE THOUGHT THE TUBE-LIKE FEATURESWERE LONG SERIES OF SAND DUNES FORMED BY THE MARTIANWINDS. I ASKED HER WHY THE DUNES WOULD PILE UP WITH SUCHREGULAR STRIATIONS.Maria Zuber, Ph.D., Prof. of Geophysics and Planetary Science,Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts, andDeputy Investigator of the Global Topography Map Mission now underwayon Mars: \"Think about the Sahara, you get the dunes all in a row. It's acharacteristic about how the wind blows and material gets transported becauseit's related to the density of the atmosphere and the velocity that the wind isblowing. And the ability of the atmosphere to entrain material of different sizes,it can carry so far and then dumps it. So it's not evidence of extraterrestrialintelligence or anything. It's just the way the physics of the atmosphere works."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"WHEN YOU LOOKS AT THAT PICTURE, IT APPEARS THAT THESTRIATIONS GO DOWN INTO DEEP CREVICES AND THEN COMESBACK UP....But you don't know that because you are assuming that you know what thetopography looks like when you look at that map. But Mars has all sorts ofshading and albido variations that aren't associated with topography. You areassuming that you are seeing shadows in certain places, but you could belooking at areas that are just dark. You don't want to over-interpret what you seethere unless you know the topographic context is. And that's what my altimeterexperiment provides.More dune structures near eroded impact craters.Image by Malin Space Science Systems.CAN YOU EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR ALTIMETERWORK AND WHAT YOU ARE DOING?We shoot laser pulses 10 times a second at the surface of Mars and we producethe map of the elevation of Mars that I guess right now we are closing in at 600"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"million points on the topography of Mars on 100 meter size spots and we have aglobal map of Mars that has a horizontal resolution of about 1 x 2 kilometersright now and its accuracy is about 90 centimeters. So, globally we know thetopography on Mars right now better than we know the topography on earth ona global basis. There are places on earth that we know better than Mars, but interms of global mapping, Mars is better known.WHAT ABOUT EARTHQUAKES ON MARS CURRENTLY?We don't have seismometers there. Well, the two Viking landers hadseismometers that didn't work very well because they were mounted on the baseof the Lander and so they tended to pick up shaking whenever the wind blew.So they were good wind devices, but they weren't coupled to the ground verywell and didn't tell us very much about Mars quakes. The thought is that there isprobably about one 6.0 Richter quake a year on Mars at least. There are plans ofputting a joint French-U.S. seismometer on a future Mars Lander. It has to last ayear to make sure you get a big quake. If you have a small quake near by, youwould measure that.WHAT HAS BEEN THE BIGGEST SURPRISE YOU HAVE FOUND INYOUR ALTIMETER RESEARCH?Oh, well I think the biggest surprise for most people has been how flat thenorthern hemisphere is. It's the flattest large scale surface in the solar system ofanything we have measured the topography for. You can go for hundreds ofkilometers on Mars and the elevation doesn't change by more than two meters(about 6 feet).I mean it's as flat as the Bonneville Salt Flats in a lot of areas of Mars in thenorthern plains. So that was not something anybody expected. Having the largeparts of the northern hemisphere be flatter than the Midwest, so there was someprocess early on Mars that flattened everything out. So it's why people havespeculated about oceans or massive lava flows. There was certainly a lot ofwater flowing early in Martian history.THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THEHEMISPHERE THAT HAD THE MOST WATER POSSIBLY?The Northern Hemisphere is a lot lower. It's 6 kilometers lower in elevation thanthe South Pole is, so pretty much everything in the Southern Hemisphere flowedto the north. So yeah, the Northern Hemisphere is where all the water collected.THAT COULD EXPLAIN WHY IT IS SO FLAT THAT FOR 150KILOMETERS YOU WOULD FIND NOTHING RISING MORE THANABOUT 6 FEET?Yeah. That's one of the things people talk about. So, it's possible. Certainly thatwas not what anyone expected.IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE, HAVE YOU FOUND ANYALTIMETER RESEARCH SURPRISES?Well, one of the interesting things in the Southern Hemisphere is we have a hugeimpact basin called Hellas which is about 2200 kilometers across and it lookslike there was enough material thrown out of that basin to put a layer on the U.S. a couple of kilometers thick. So one of the questions people have asked aboutMars is why is the Southern Hemisphere higher than the Northern Hemisphere.So it looks like a lot of the material was excavated out of that basin is one of thereasons the Southern Hemisphere is high.MEANING THAT SOMETHING IMPACTED THE HELLAS BASIN ANDALL OF THAT DEBRIS WAS THROWN UP IN THE SOUTHERNHEMISPHERE?Yes, because most of the material is around the basin.THERE IS OLYMPUS MONS, THE BIGGEST VOLCANO IN THESOLAR SYSTEM, IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE, BUT WHATYOU ARE SAYING IS NOT ONLY IS THAT VOLCANO THERE, BUTTHE REST OF IT IS SO FLAT THAT THERE IS THE SPECULATION"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE AREA THAT WAS UNDER WATER?It's possible that was the case. People argue about this. Did it get flat by anocean being there and sedimentation. Or whether it got flat by massive lavaflows. People will continue to argue until we find out what was really going on.One of the things that argues against an ocean in the Northern Hemisphere is ouroceans, you find whenever carbon dioxide - Mars has a carbon dioxideatmosphere. And when ever CO2 mixes with water, you get calcium carbonatewhich is limestone. It precipitates out of the water and people have not foundcalcium carbonate on Mars in the Northern Hemisphere. That would be theproof positive that people need to demonstrate there was a hemispheric scaleocean early in Martian history.BUT THERE ARE ALL THOSE RIVULETS AND CHANNELS.Well, there was certainly a lot of water flowing. Now whether it was an ocean orlots of lakes, goodness knows. But unquestionably there was a lot of water earlyin Martian history.WHY WOULDN'T THERE BE LIMESTONE?Well, the optimistic people say it's there and it's just covered up by dust becauseMars is so dusty. There are experiments planned to go and dig through the dustlayer and look for it. It should be there. If you take carbon dioxide and mix itwith water, you get calcium carbonate. So it should be there. If there was anocean, it should be there.BUT IT MAY BE BURIED UNDER ALL THIS DEBRIS THAT MAYHAVE BEEN BLASTED OUT BY THE HELLAS BASIN CRATER. HAVEPEOPLE SPECULATED ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE OBJECT THATIMPACTED?This happened early in Martian history when there was still a lot of junk floatingaround the solar system that didn't get swept up into planets. So, it wassomething a couple of hundred kilometers across that hit probably.THAT IS HUGE.That is huge, yeah. I think it is the biggest basin we know of in the solar system.MARS HAS THE BIGGEST CRATER BASIN, THE BIGGESTVOLCANO, THE FLATTEST NORTHERN HEMISPHERE.Right! It's either a very special planet or we just haven't looked at other placesclosely enough. Certainly Mars gets a lot of scrutiny.\"More Information:Of all the planets in the solar system, Mars has the biggest volcano (OlympusMons), the biggest crater basin (Hellas), the flattest hemisphere (Northern), andthe largest canyon (Valles Marineris). Among its many mysteries, could blacklava basalts and white limestone be hidden beneath its oxidized red sands?We b s it e s :http://www.msss.com/moc_gallery/ab1_m04/nonmaps/M0400291.gifCredits"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
