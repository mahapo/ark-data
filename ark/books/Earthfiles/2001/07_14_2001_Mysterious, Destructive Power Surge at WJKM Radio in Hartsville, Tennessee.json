Photograph © 2001 byDavid Randall.July 14, 2001 Hartsville, Tennessee - Friday, July 6, was a clear and sunnymorning. But at 10:45 a.m., something very odd surged through the air, radiotransmitter, power and phone lines at country music radio station WJKM (1090AM) near the city park in downtown Hartsville, Tennessee. It also affectedtheVidette newspaper office next door and shocked one of the employees sittingat her desk.Employee, Vi d et t e Newspaper, Hartsville, Tennessee: \"I heard this, it soundedlike a surge of electricity running through the building. And the lights went offfor a second. And I looked up real quick when I heard that and saw light - aflash of light on the front wall there in front of me. Lights came back on. Then itdid that again and they stayed off. And again, I saw that flash of light and heardthat sound. I don't know how else to describe it, except that it sounded like asurge of electricity coming through the building. It was just like a big old blockof light, like it came in through that window.\"Next door at country radio station WJKM (1090 AM), the sales manager alsoheard a strange, powerful sound and the whole building shook.Sales Manager, WJKM (1090 AM), Hartsville, Tennessee: \"The lightsflickered a time or two and then there was kind of a low level rumbling kind ofnoise. It sounded like an electric current (mimics sound). It lasted only two orthree seconds tops, two maybe. Then the lights were down. I never heardanything quite like it. It was quite unusual. It sounded like somebody, orsomething hit something and there was a charge go off or something like arumbling like an electric current kind of thing.\"WJKM's General Manager, Ted Randall, talked to me this weekend about theshocking chaos of at least 60 birds dead with charred and melted wings aroundthe radio station and the damage to his transmitter, phone lines and most of thestation's computer equipment."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Hartsville, Tennessee, about 30 miles northeast of Nashville, where mysterious,destructive power surge killed dozens of birds and damaged transmitter, phone lines andcomputer equipment at country music radio station WJKM (1090 AM) on Friday,July 6, 2001 at 10:45 a.m. CST.Interview:Ted Randall, General Manager, WJKM (1090 AM), Hartsville, Tennessee:\"So, these birds were burned very badly. With the wings, you can actually seethe bone structure where it curled from the heat.I LOOKED AT THE PHOTOS ON YOUR SITE TODAY.I just told my son, David, 'Shoot some pictures because it was just too weird.'DOESN'T THAT SEEM STRANGE?The whole thing seems strange.Another burned wing on one of dozens of dead birds found all around the Hartsville,Tennessee radio station. Photograph © 2001 by David Randall.Melted feathers around bird's head at Hartsville, Tennessee's WJKM radio station.Photograph © 2001 by David Randall.It's a disturbing thing, and I just don't understand it. Now, the phone companyreported to the editor of the newspaper that the ground wires on all of the linesfrom the radio station, from the newspaper and from the co-op had been burnedcompletely in two. So, birds flying into a transformer the central office for thephone company is about three blocks away from the radio station. But all thephones were not out. I called the Chamber of Commerce. Their line wasworking. Their answering machine was working. They had power and phones."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"So, if indeed, something that powerful blew the grounds out of just thosecircuits, I would have thought - I don't know, it just seems like it would havetaken out the central office. But it didn't. It just bothered the specific lines thatwere effected. Now, of course, the lines are extended above ground on poles.Power lines are extended above ground on poles. Our antenna system outsidewhich is an AM antenna system is in the air.So it seems like it bothered anything that was suspended above the earth and itgot the birds. Because I thought everyone else felt the shake or felt something -Steve and the editor from the newspaper, but they - no harm came to them. Butthe birds obviously took a major hit and so did the electrical system, theelectrical power, and the telephone lines. So this remains a very big mystery.We've had a lot of power surges. We've had to replace a lot of equipment. We'vegot circuit protectors I should say, surge protectors. We've got surge protectorsplugged into surge protectors plugged into surge protectors. We've doneeverything we know how other than enclosing the radio station in a Faradayshield or something.HAVE YOU HAD ANYBODY FROM THE FEDERAL OR STATEGOVERNMENT CONTACT YOU ABOUT THIS?No. And I placed some calls to the TVA and they didn't return my calls. Theonly reason I called them is that we have a nuclear power plant that was nevercompleted, according to what they say, and it's supposed to be completelynon-operational. It's supposed to be a storage facility for TVA junk, discardedstuff that they don't have any use for. Occasionally they have auctions out there.But there's been a lot of things reported in regards to this nuclear plant that arejust abnormal. Sound strange.WHAT HAS BEEN THE STRANGEST?The thing started off with a farmer who called me one day. He's a very countryfellow, obviously an elderly gentlemen, who told me his beagles had gottenloose and they had wandered off and a friend had called and said they had heardor seen the beagles over by the cooling tower. So this old gentleman got in hispickup truck and drove over there and when he got near the area, he jumpedover the fence and could hear the dogs out in the thicket, as he said. He said hewas out there 10 or 15 minutes and a helicopter came over head and the nextthing he knows, he's got about 30 people on the ground escorting him off theproperty. He said he had to take a nitro tablet he was so upset. And so I thought,'Boy, for a place where nothing is going on, that's really overkill.'But we've been told stories of black, silent helicopters coming in and out atnight; C-130 transports coming in and out; shiny 18-wheel rigs coming in at 3o'clock in the morning, three or four of them in a row going out to the site.People who live in the area who are up high enough that they can see the placesay it is very, very active at night, a lot of activity.HOW FAR IS IT FROM YOUR RADIO STATION?By air, I would say no more than 3 to 4 miles at the most.VERY CLOSE.I don't know. Not to blame the nuclear power plant or say that's what the causeis, but when people call up they report strange humming sounds that occur inthe middle of the night and are usually accompanied by helicopters. And thehumming sound is nondescript. We've had a couple of callers say they can feelit, that it raises the hair on the back of their head, that type of thing. But they(TVA) will tell you that nothing is going on out there.And we got on the air and said, 'If nothing is going on and the TVA ismaintaining this ungodly piece of land which is hundreds of acres, then whydon't they just turn it over to the county for development and bow out of thesituation and then it's no longer an expense.'They don't have all this liability they claim they have. And as soon as we began"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"to talk that, they (TVA) scheduled a press conference and they went on and saidthey were going to donate this land to the county and that the local electriccompany and TVA were going to develop a power park where you can go in ifyou are operating some kind of industry where you need some kind ofguaranteed flow of power and current with no outages, they were going to putsomething like that together.And all of a sudden, they (TVA) came back and made the announcement that itwould be at least three years because they had to do an environmental study.And I said, 'Now wait a minute. They did a study that said they could put anuclear reactor on the banks of the Cumberland River where Nashville,Tennessee gets its water supply. They have approved this property for nuclearfission and then they decided they are not going to build it?!'Now they say they simply want to put an industrial park in. What kind ofenvironmental study could they do that would exceed what they did to approvea nuclear power plant?!ANY ANSWER?No. No, of course not. I attended a meeting where they were at and I asked themabout the helicopters and all such as that and the guy that was talking, he gotvery nervous. And he stayed nervous through the remainder of his speech. Butnever so much as a clue.I went for a drive out there with my sons one day. When I first moved into thecommunity I was just curious what was out there because there were a bunch ofbuildings that looked like Army barracks. And they have an incubator set up outthere supposedly for new businesses. And there are some businesses operatingout there. But there's a good portion of that property that does not meet the eye.And all of a sudden here comes the nose of a C-130 pops up over the top of ahill, very close to the ground. I said, 'That thing must have just taken off.'I began to ask questions (in town) and everyone said, 'Well, there's no runwayout there. There's no place for a C-130.' And I said, 'Well, what in the world what did we see?' And you're constantly seeing three and four of these C-130sgo out in that direction.So, interestingly enough after all this took place, we had some satellite photosthat my son Mat had gotten off the internet. We put them on the (radio) website.And I've had two or three people e-mail those satellite images back to me witharrows on them all pointing to a strip that each one of these people e-mailingsay the strip is at least 7,000 feet long, or something like that, and it would bean ideal place. A C-130 would have no trouble taking off or landing there.Satellite photograph of the allegedly undeveloped Hartsville, Tennessee Valley Authority(TVA) nuclearreactor. Cooling tower is near center. The black arrow to the left points at long, flat stretchof land. Imagewas e-mailed to WJKM General Manager, Ted Randall, by a listener who wanted to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"indicate possible airstripthat could accommodate large C-130 transport planes. Satellite image provided by TedRandall.IS IT VERY FAR FROM THE SO-CALLED COOLING TOWER?No, it's right in that same complex. There must be, I don't know how manyhundreds of acres there are. It seems to me they had talked about turning 700acres over for development to the county. But then, there's always some reasonlike this environmental study.But the helicopters, I've seen those myself. We're a good distance away fromFort Campbell, Kentucky, built a lot of people say they do maneuvers from Ft.Campbell and fly the C-130s from there and turn around and go back inhelicopters and what not.IT WOULD NOT EXPLAIN THE 30 MEN SUDDENLY TURNING UPWHEN THE MAN WENT AFTER HIS BEAGLE DOGS.No, it would not. And there are a lot of stories similar to that.There's a radio tower that they mysteriously claim is being used by NOAA. Afriend of mine has a spectrum analyzer, has monitored the area pretty closelyand says the tower is never used during any sort of a storm or tornado activity.So there is a lot of mystery about the place.And I guess what bothered me when this happened with the birds and all that, Ilook at the community of Hartsville and I say, 'How far are we away from amilitary installation?' Well, it's a long ways.And yet this place is surrounded by a lot of mystery and there are a lot of oddthings going on surrounding the place and that was my first suspicion. I wonderif they are playing with something out there? Is something going on?HAS ANYONE RESPONDED TO YOUR CALLS SINCE FRIDAY, JULY6, WHEN ALL THIS STUFF HIT YOUR STATION?No. I haven't heard a word from anyone.DOESN'T THAT SEEM STRANGE?The whole thing seems strange.BUT I MEAN ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT THIS MUCHDAMAGE OCCURRED AT YOUR STATION AND YOU AREINQUIRING. WOULDN'T SOMEONE CALL YOU?I would think so. But see, in the past I've called because I've had listeners callme and say, 'We've heard this humming sound at night. What's with these black,unmarked helicopters? They don't make any noise until they are right overhead.'You hear these stories and I would call as a public relations person from theradio station and say, 'Well, I've got listeners calling and they are asking thesequestions.' I would always get a voice answering machine and I would leave amessage, but never a call back.Now, these people have showed up at public meetings. Now, I'll tell you a verystrange thing that took place right after all of this happened. I believe this lastweek, the supposed director of the area stopped in to talk to our lady over at the(Hartsville) Chamber of Commerce.THIS WOULD BE REPRESENTING WHAT AGENCY?The nuclear site. And he said, 'I need to tell you what's going on. You need toknow. Every week now, we're going to be bringing in 150 people for trainingpurposes each week. And we're not going to do this over a short term. We'regoing to do this over an 8 year period.'TO TRAIN FOR WHAT?I don't know. She mentioned something about fossil energy and some other kindof energy."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"So, we have a partially constructed nuclear power plant that was scrapped.There is supposedly nothing there except junk and what remains of theconstruction. What would they be training people for in an area like that? Whaton earth could they possibly have to train someone? Maybe I'm just crazy andstupid and don't know. I mean, I think it is a legitimate question. But 150 peoplea week?!FOR EIGHT YEARS?Yeah! What are they doing? Maybe it was a little target practice and those birdswere .....? I mean, I just don't know. I think what ever happened to those birdshit them in the air.WHAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE VERY LOUD BUZZING THAT SHOOKTHE BUILDING, FOLLOWED BY THE FLASH OF LIGHT AND THENTHE HUMMING AGAIN?And the ground wires being burned off the phone lines. All of that is - I don'tknow. What really bothers me over there is playground equipment. And itextends up in the air quite a little ways. You know, monkey bars and stuff. Superpark for kids to play. And I thought, 'If a child were elevated up there 15 or 20feet off the ground...WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED?Yeah, what would have happened then? And that makes me angry. Whateverthis is, unless it's a natural occurrence that we can explain somehow, ...IF IT IS A MILITARY EXPERIMENTATION, IT'S IRRESPONSIBLE.Absolutely. If that's the case. But, you know, who's to say what it is.And I would say this: if when you call government agencies they would at leastrespond and return telephone calls, you wouldn't be nearly as suspicious ofthem as you would as they are now, totally silent and just ignore you.\"At least sixty birds were found dead with feathers burned and melted, scattered all overthe yard around country music radio station WJKM (1090 AM)on July 6, 2001 in Hartsville, Tennessee.
