Dr. Thompson has completed 37 expeditionssince 1978 to collect and study perhaps the world's largest archive of glacial icecored from the Himalayas, Mount Kilimanjaro in Africa, the Andes in SouthAmerica, the Antarctic and Greenland.Dr. Thompson reported to AAAS that at least one-third of the massive ice fieldon top of Tanzania's Mount Kilimanjaro has melted in only the past twelveyears. Further, since the first mapping of the mountain's ice in 1912, the ice fieldhas shrunk by 82%. By 2015, there will be no more \"snows of Kilimanjaro.\"In Peru, the Quelccaya ice cap in the Southern Andes Mountains is at least 20%smaller than it was in 1963. One of the main glaciers there, Qori Kalis, has beenmelting at the astonishing rate of 1.3 feet per day. Back in 1963, the glaciercovered 56 square kilometers. By 2000, it was down to less than 44 squarekilometers and now there is a new ten acre lake. It's melt rate has beenincreasing exponentially and at its current rate will be entirely gone between2010 and 2015, the same time that Kilimanjaro dries.In the Himalayas, a recent ice core in fall 2000 from the Dasuopu Glacier at"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"26,293 feet on top of Mt. Xixabangma on the southern edge of the TibetanPlateau indicated that the last 50 years have been the warmest for that ice cap inat least 9,000 years. That conclusion is based on oxygen isotope measurementsfrom the Tibetan ice cores that indicate what the original temperatures of thesource waters were before freezing.Interview:Lonnie Thompson, Ph.D., Professor of Geological Sciences, Ohio StateUniversity and Senior Research Scientist, Byrd Polar Research Center,Columbus, Ohio: \"We have drilled four sites in Tibet. We have drilled inRussia, Tanzania, Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia in South America. We also haveongoing programs in Greenland and down in Antarctica. So we have drilled onjust about every continent.FROM ALL OF THE ICE CORES, WHAT IS THE CURRENT STORYABOUT GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE?The earth is getting warmer. There is no doubt about that. You see it whetheryou are looking at the oxygen isotopes which are one of the parameters that wemeasure on these ice cores that we collect. Oxygen isotopes are a proxy fortemperature in ice. They record a temperature of the source area - the oceanswhere the water vapor comes from that makes up the snow as well as thetemperatures at the area where condensation takes place that forms theseglaciers. And from those, you can see the seasonal temperature variations inwinter, summer.So, when you analyze the cores, they are layered very much like a tree and youstart with the year you do the drilling and count the layers back in time. And inTibet, for example, every site - all 4 sites we have drilled - the real consistentstory in the records is the enrichment, the warming, that the isotopes show overthe last 200 years, starting about 1800 and coming up to the present. So, it's avery consistent signal there, and also very consistent with the meteorologicalstations from the Tibetan Plateau. There are about 178 stations up there atdifferent elevations.If you look at the temperature records from those stations, you'll see thattemperatures have been warming on average about .16 degree Centigrade perdecade. Those records stand from 1955 up through about 1996. And theinteresting thing about those station records is that the stations from the highestelevations show the greatest warming. At the highest sites right at the top of theplateau, temperatures have been warming at about .35 degrees C. per decade.The highest ice cores ever recovered on earth come from the top of theHimalayas at 23,500 feet. There we have the greatest isotopic enrichmentoccurring in the last 50 years and that enrichment is greater than anything in thelast 1000 years for that site. And in fact, greater than since these particular icefields started to form.WHICH WOULD BE BACK HOW MANY THOUSAND YEARS?At least 8,000-9,000 years.IN THE LAST 9,000 YEARS THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A PERIODTHAT HAS WARMED UP AS RAPIDLY AS IT HAS IN THE LASTFIFTY YEARS?That's correct.HOW DO YOU EXPLAIN THAT AT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS THATTHERE WOULD BE MORE WARMING?That's a very important question and one that we have been looking into becausewhen you look at the details of the glaciers in Peru, for example, they are notonly retreating but the rate of retreat is accelerating. We are trying to figure out"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"what is driving that and one theory is that what is happening in the Tropics -that's where the energy that drives the climate system comes into the planet. It'salso where water vapor is evaporated from the earth's oceans and goes into theclimate system.We think as the earth warms in the Tropics, we are getting greater evaporation atthe surface down where most of our instrumental records, meteorologicalstations, are located. Evaporation is a cooling process, but it's really a transfer ofheat from the surface of the ocean and water vapor gets tied up in these deepconvective cells that make up the inter-Tropical convergence zone and have veryheavy rainfall. And when you have condensation taking place, this heat isreleased.Tibet Glacial RetreatIf we start in Tibet - the last glacier we visited in the central part of Tibet. Wewere the first westerners, the first people to go into that area. Very remote. Noroads. But we had a map. The map of the glacier, Puruogangri, was made fromaerial photographs that the Chinese took back in 1974. And in the year 2000, allthe lobes coming off of that ice cap onto the plateau had retreated 1 to 2kilometers since that map had been made.Africa's Mount Kilimanjaro Glacier Melting RapidlyMount Kilimanjaro, Tanzania, Africa.Photograph of disappearing glacier taken in 2000by Lonnie Thompson, Ph.D., Ohio State University.If we go to Kilimanjaro where we drilled in the year 2000 also, as part of theproject we recovered six cores to the bedrock from the ice fields on top ofKilimanjaro. But on Feb. 16, 2000, we also had aerial photographs taken of theice fields. And from those, we were able to make a map of the area of ice that'son the mountain in the year 2000. And that turns out to be 2.2 squarekilometers.The first map of the Kilimanjaro ice field was made in 1912 and there have beenfive maps, including ours, that have been made from 1912 to 2000. In 1912,there was 12.1 square kilometers of ice on the mountain. So, that means thatsince 1912, 82% of the area of ice has disappeared. The last map that was madebefore we made ours was in 1989. In 1989, there was 3.3 square kilometers ofice which means that 33% of the area has decreased from 1989 to the year 2000.You can take all five of those maps, map out the area that existed as you comeforward in time, and you get a line that if you project it into the future will showthose ice caps disappearing around 2015.COMPLETELY GONE.Completely gone in another 14 years. And that is assuming there is no increasein the rates of the warming of the atmosphere.THE U. N.'S INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGESAYS THAT PLANETARY WARMING WILL KEEP INCREASING.We believe that's what will happen, yes."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THAT MEANS THAT THE GLACIER ON TOP OF MT. KILIMANJAROCOULD BE GONE SOONER THAN 2015?That's correct. We think that's a conservative estimate. But if it just maintains therate of retreat that we've seen since the first map was made in 1912, it will begone by 2015. So it's remarkable when you think about the history of that area,Ernest Hemingway and The Snows of Kilimanjaro and the like. For the peoplewho live there, of course, it has tremendous implications for tourism. Some20,000 tourists come to Kilimanjaro every year. It's the only mountain in theworld that I know that has its own international airport. So, the local hotels andtourist industry are very concerned about what's happening in that area.But it also has implications for the local towns like Moshe and Arusha becausethe mountain serves as a water source. A lot of that water comes from the rainsthat occur on the lower levels of the mountain. But glaciers kind of serve like anatural dam. They accumulate snow in wet periods and when there is anabundance of precipitation and it kind of waste melts when it's drier, so theykind of maintain water flow in the stream in dry periods. So, when the ice capsare gone, we would expect greater variability in water supplies in that area.Rapid Retreat of South American GlaciersIf you go to South America where we have our longest documented records andthat's because it was the first place that we went to drill tropical ice cores. I firstwent to Peru in 1974 and we went to look at this ice cap called Quelccaya thatat that time covered 56 square kilometers. It's probably the only true ice cap inthe tropics - very flat body of ice on the basalt flow, some at elevation 18,700feet. As part of our ice core drilling program there, way back in 1978 we set up abaseline, a line where we measured the distance very carefully where we couldtake terrestrial photographs of the largest outlet glacier, the Qori Kalis, whichflows to the west off of the Quelccaya ice cap. We could take photographs andmap that glacier not only at its terminus, but also map the volume changes of icethrough time. We did that back in the 1970s when no one was talking aboutglobal warming and no one was talking about global change. But we haverevisited Quelccaya repeatedly to get a documented record of the change takingplace there.Our first map of this Qori Kalis glacier comes from 1963 aerial photographs andour first terrestrial photographs were in 1978. And if you look at the rate ofretreat from 1963 to 1978, it was 4.9 meters per year. We went back andre-photographed the glacier in 1983. Between 1978 and 1983, the rate of retreathad increased to about 8 meters per year. We went back again in 1993 andphotographed Qori Kalis, and from 1983 to 1993, the rate of retreat hadincreased to about 14 meters per year. Then from 1993 to 1995, the next timewe measured it, the rate of retreat had increased to 30 meters per year. Thenfrom 1995-1998, it had increased up to 49 meters per year. And from 1998 toAugust 2000, the last time we mapped it, the rate of retreat had increased to 155meters per year.IT'S ALMOST AN EXPONENTIAL MELT RATE.It is an exponential melt rate. It's 32 times faster today in the rate of retreat thanit was in that first period from 1963 to 1978. Since 1963, the Qori Kalis glacierin Peru's Quelccaya ice cap in the Southern Andes has shrunk by at least 20%.The rate of retreat has been 509 feet per year, or 1.3 feet per day! You canliterally sit there and watch it retreat. And if you assume that the current rate ofretreat will continue, this ice cap will disappear some time between 2010 and2020.THE SAME TIME PERIOD AS THE DISAPPEARANCE OF MT.KILIMANJARO.That's correct."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"HOW MANY OTHER OF THE WORLD'S GLACIERS THAT YOUHAVE BEEN DEALING WITH WILL ALSO BE GONE BY 2015?The power company in Peru, Electric Peru, has been monitoring the terminus ofglaciers since 1945 on about six other glaciers in northern Peru. Every one ofthose glaciers show retreat and they show the same acceleration in the rate ofretreat that we have just talked about on Qori Kalis and the Quelccaya ice cap inthe south. And so, already in Peru, the power company is worried abouthydroelectric power production. In the dry season in the Rio Sante River Valley,the plant produces 100% of capacity in the wet season and that drops to 20%capacity in the dry season. In Peru, there is a very strong dry season in June, Julyand August and the only water comes from the melting of these glaciers. So,once the glaciers are gone, there will be very little water in those valleys.HOW ARE THEY GOING TO GET POWER?In cities like Lima, Peru, a city out in the desert, coastal desert, has 9 millionpeople - they've already started to build fuel-burning power plants to make upfor the loss of power and the extra need of power because population continuesto increase.BUT THAT CONTRIBUTES MORE CARBON DIOXIDE INTO THEATMOSPHERE AND ACCELERATES THE WARMING.That's exactly right. And we believe that in ten to 20 years, a lot of these icefields - if you want to see and look at tropical ice - you'll have to come to thefreezers here at Ohio State where we have an archive. We are storing an archiveof these cores frozen at 40 deg. C. because we know that there will be newtechnologies and advancements in understanding that you won't be able to goout into the natural world in the tropics and recover some of these archives.BECAUSE ALL THE ICE WILL BE GONE.Ye s .WHAT IS YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE ABOUT BOTH THE POLARMELTS AND WHERE THINGS ARE HEADED AND WHAT COULDHAPPEN IN ANTARCTICA?We have two big ice sheets on the earth, Greenland up in the Arctic regions andthe Antarctic ice fields. These are where most of the fresh water on earth iscontained. And for sure, the Arctic sea ice has been thinning and as thetemperature of the world continues to warm, I believe that one of the things weneed to be concerned about is - We know for example, that 1998 was thewarmest year on record. That's the warmest year since we've had instrumentalrecords on the planet. We also know that the decade of the 1990s was thewarmest on the planet. We also know from our proxy records - tree rings, icecores, corals and the like - that the 1990s was probably the warmest decade inthe last 1000 years, at least. And we know the glaciers are melting andretreating. But we also know that the glaciers and oceans of the world serve as abuffer. As the temperatures warm, that energy, some of that energy, is going intomelting the glaciers and warming of the oceans. But once the glaciers are gone,then you don't have these buffers for future temperature rises. So we have to beconcerned about the natural balance that exists on the earth for trying tomaintain the ways it maintains its temperature.IF WE LOSE ALL THE ICE, THEN WHAT HAPPENS?Then we would expect temperatures to accelerate. You have to alwaysremember that the earth's climate has changed through time. There have beenwarmer periods. There have been colder periods. Natural variations in climatesystems. The difference is as we go into the 21st Century, there has never been 6billion people on the planet. There has never been a time when we were adding200,000 people a day to that number. And probably even more telling is the factthat most of these people on the earth are poor. Most of them are striving tohave a life style like western cultures and you can't blame them. But to do that,they must increase consumption. To increase consumption means you mustproduce more product. To produce more products, you must burn more fuels.So, it's not only the fact that the population is increasing and we're at theserecord levels in the history of the planet, but the fact that is our rate of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"consumption is increasing even faster.We know from the ice core studies that have been done in Antarctica that if youlook at the long term history of CO2 in the earth's atmosphere, it varied due tonatural changes and during glacial periods it's very low - on the order of180-200 ppm by volume.During warm periods, it gets up to 280 ppm by volume. But we crossed 300ppm by volume in 1900. We're now at 370 ppm by volume. Sixty years out, ifwe go about business as usual, we'll be at 600 ppm by volume.So, we've entered what at least in the history that we have good CO2measurements, a period that there is no analog in the natural system.NO PRECEDENT EVER?No. So, we don't know exactly how the system will respond to this. But we doknow these gases have long residence time. Again, another argument why - ifyou don't know how the system is going to respond to something like this, thenwe should be taking the first steps to reduce those emissions until we betterunderstand how the climate system works.That's why when you do the businessas usual projections, you see the CO2 doubling, tripling in the earth'satmosphere.WITH NO PRECEDENT FOR THAT, AND SCIENTISTSINCREASINGLY SAYING THAT WE ARE HEADED INTO SUCHUNKNOWN TERRITORY WITH SUCH UNPREDICTABLECONSEQUENCES THAT IF THE PLANET DID WARM ANOTHER 10DEGREES IN THE NEXT 100 YEARS, THE CONSEQUENCES COULDBE SEVERE.If that's where we're headed, yes. But any time you look at a model prediction ofthe future, it's based on what we know today and what we know from the past.But we always have to remember that the earth's climate system has alwayschanged. There have been periods when it has warmed and cooled. If all theevidence we have was only the ice, I wouldn't be so concerned. But it comesfrom our instrumental records. It comes from tree ring data. It comes from oceantemperatures. From corals. That when you look at the balance of that evidencethe earth is getting warmer and there is no reason to believe that it's going toreverse in the near future.\"Antarctica Warming"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Larsen B Ice Shelf in Antarctica has experienced major retreatsin 1995 and 1998. Satellite image courtesy NASA.DO YOU THINK AS A PERSON STUDYING ICE CORES THATTHERE IS ANY CHANCE THAT SOME OF THOSE BIG ICE SHELVESTHAT ARE ON LAND IN ANTARCTICA COULD SLIDE OFF INTOTHE OCEANS IN THE NEXT 100 YEARS?Certainly in the Antarctic peninsula area, these ice shelves have been breakingup here recently. Unfortunately we don't have a long term history to know if thishas happened in the past under natural conditions. But we know that in the areain the peninsula since the first meteorological station was put in there,temperatures have increased 2.5 deg. C. And we have the break up of the iceshelves taking place.The big ice sheets in the interior - they have a much longer response time totemperature changes. You have to look at Vostok in central east Antarctica.Temperatures there are minus 55 deg. C. So, if you raise the temperature 10 deg.C., or 5 deg. C., it's still cold. And so the response time there is slower.But I think that we expected to see the first changes taking place in the tropicalglaciers because they set right at the snow line, zero isotherm, and therefore, iftemperatures of the earth rise, they will respond. They will see it first. I refer tothem as the \"canary in the coal mine.\" In the old days they used to take canariesdown in a cage and if that canary died, it meant there was methane in the mineand the miners got out. I think the tropical glaciers are in a way the earth's earlywarning signal of the increasing temperatures of the earth.WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THAT ANTARCTICA HAD NO ICE ONTHE LAND?That's debated. But it's on the order of 30 million years ago. You'll find otherpeople who say it was only 3 million years ago, but a long time ago. Butcertainly a time when we didn't have this human population on the planet. It's afact that you can look at these glaciers and we have these series of photos wehave collected over so many years that is so compelling because glaciers have nopolitical agenda. All they do is respond to their environment. That's what theyare doing.AND THEY ARE MELTING.And they are melting!\"We b s it e s :http://www.acs.ohio-state.edu/units/research/archive/glacgone.htmCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
