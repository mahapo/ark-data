C. - Astronomer Gerald S. Hawkins, Ph.D.,educated at Manchester University in England and now retired in Washingtonand Virginia, wrote a book in 1973 entitled Beyond Stonehenge. The DailyExpress in London wrote about it, \"If Hawkins is right, and most experts nowagree that he must be, then Stonehenge is the Eighth Wonder of the ancientworld.\"Dr. Hawkins had already proposed in an earlier work, Stonehenge Decoded,that the massive, circular stone structure on the gently rolling pastures west ofAndover, Wiltshire functioned like a computer to keep precise track of the moonand sun. Then, he traveled to Peru and Upper Egypt to study the mathematicalconfigurations in the architecture of those cultures. In addition to markers of sunand moon cycles, Dr. Hawkins discovered architectural orientations focusedaround the brightest star, Sirius, the Pleiades constellation and otherastronomical bodies. The result of that research is Beyond Stonehenge whichestablishes archaeoastronomy as an important tool in comprehending ancientmotivations for building megalithic stone circles, pyramids, mounds and oddlyangled street grids.Beyond Stonehenge has been printed in a new 2001 edition (See: MoreInformation below) at a time when enigmatic crop formations have beenemerging in England and worldwide since 1990 with geometries that haveprovoked Dr. Hawkins to also wonder about the intellectual profile of the circlemakers. Great Britain has more than 2,000 stone circles, the most of any land onEarth. Why? Who put them there? Is there a connection between the stonecircle makers and the crop circle makers? Dr. Hawkins describes in BeyondStonehenge how the megalithic builders were extremely intelligent monitors ofcosmic cycles:\"Knowledge of periodicities gave power power to predict eclipses, to predict thebright shining of Venus, the future movement of the planets and it gaveconfidence in the sky environment, the cosmos, in the reliability of nature, ofgod.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Interview:Gerald S.

Theywould be leaders and they would be reporting on the movement of the sun andthe moon almost as a calendar and as various events took place. They would beable to announce that we have reached the highest point of the sun atmid-summer and they would be able to announce that we have reached thelowest point of the sun in mid-winter. And they would be able to announce thatthe moon perhaps this month will be, as we would say, eclipsed. They wouldhave the power of the cosmos, or the universe, at their fingertips.What I found at Stonehenge was also an intelligence in understanding cycles.There is a ring of 56 filled chalk holes called the Aubrey holes (John Aubrey,16th Century British Stonehenge investigator) which completely describes themovement of the moon over an 18 or 19 year period and all of this wassomething well beyond what we would have expected from people who werenot literate.Aerial photograph of Stonehenge showing circle of 56 white chalkAubrey holes that form a ring around the great sarsen stone \"computer.\"From Page 53, Beyond Stonehenge © 1973 and 2001 by Gerald S. Hawkins.The problem with the Stonehenge people is that they didn't write. Therefore,they are pushed aside. But I always say they wrote in stone. I can read what theywere doing and science, you see, has enabled us to find out a lot about the mindof people in the past. And, of course, it raises the question: what will we learnabout ourselves in years to come?THAT'S WHAT INTRIGUES ME - THE MIND BEHIND THECREATION OF STONEHENGE AND ALL OF THE STONE CIRCLESIN ENGLAND AND THE POSSIBLE CONNECTION TO ALL OF THECIRCLES IN THE CEREAL GRAINS ALSO FOCUSED IN THEBRITISH ISLES.Yes, your very fine book Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles deals, of course,with the present and my book, Beyond Stonehenge, deals with the people of thepast. Now whether we can connect the two geographically, Stonehenge peoplewere interested in the sky, the sun and the moon. And the crop circle mind is"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"interested in very esoteric mathematics. You see, I am interested in intellectualprofiles. I study the intellectual profile from the past of what remains and I dostudy the intellectual profile of the crop circle people. You kindly have anaccount of what I found in your book. And what I found is beyond thetextbooks and beyond the normal thinking of mathematicians or architects, but astrange sort of mind that is maybe too clever for its own good. (ironic laugh)YOU'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET INSIDE OF THE MIND ATSTONEHENGE AND YOU HAVE BEEN STUDYING THE CROPFORMATIONS FROM THE EARLY 1990S ON. IF YOU WERE GOINGTO DESCRIBE HOW THEY ARE SIMILAR, WHAT SIMILARITIESWOULD YOU FIND?We have two connections on page 243 in my book. I show the flattened stonecircle where the ancient people presumably were trying to make a circle wherethe pi came out equal to 3. Of course, in your book Mysterious Lights and CropCircles, you've got the Hackpen Hill formation which is exactly that curveHackpen Hill, Wiltshire, England formation in wheat, 120 meters (394 feet)diameter, discovered July 4,1999. Aerial photograph © 1999 by Steve Alexander.There is another correlation between the ancient past and the present and this isa very delicate one, Linda. At Silbury Hill, you may remember the formationthat had five stars, each with six arms, and one arm was broken off. We thoughtthe crop circle makers never make goofs like that. And there was that floatingarm. But in Beyond Stonehenge on page 24, I speculate that the Stonehengepeople knew that 29 and 30 were the key numbers for following the months andthe calendar, 29/30. Well, if you count the arms of the stars, you get 29. Thenwhen you add the one that's off to the side, you get 30. So you've got a patternthat is 29/30. That's a very strange correlation. I don't know how the patterns aremade. You have done a wonderful piece of work in Mysterious Lights and CropCircles to describe all the mysterious effects that exist in the crop circles. But Ionly study the intellectual profile and these are two places I see a connection -the 29/30 and the Hackpen Hill curve.LOOKING BACK SO MANY THOUSANDS OF YEARS TO THATANCIENT MIND, HOW COULD THEY HAVE WORKED ALL THATOUT?The ancient mind mathematics is different from the crop circle mindmathematics. We feel that they were very interested in geometry in those stonecircles. As you know, the circles at Stonehenge are perfect circles to withininches. But what is in the crop circles, the mathematics I found there is not inthe text books. It is beyond Euclid and Euclid was 300 B. C. And one could sayit is very ingenious application of mathematics that is not in the mainstreamnow.It was something I realized was behind the crop patterns. We found Theorems 1,2, 3 and 4 which were just simple ideas of a triangle with a circle around it and asquare with a circle around it. But these gave musical notes, that is - diatonicratios.And so they were very understandable, although nobody that I could find in thehistory of mathematics had ever coupled a geometry and music. And I think, ofcourse, in Glimpses of Other Realities, you have a lovely title for your chapter"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"what is it, frozen music. Geometry is frozen music. And so, that is what I found.And then there was a 5th Theorem which would swallow up all those 4theorems and I had stumbled across that. I was sort of advised, 'Don't publish it.'But look, if Doug and Dave are doing it, let them come forward and say theyknow the 5th Theorem. But of course, they didn't come forward to say theyknew the 5th Theorem.New geometry theorems I-V discovered by astronomer and mathematician Gerald Hawkinsin the July 1988-1993 crop formations. Diagrams © 1995 by Gerald S. Hawkins.NO ONE DID.That's right. We tried Science News and 250,000 circulation and no one cameup with the 5th Theorem. We tried the Mathematics Teacher journal and their50,000 high school math teachers could not come up with the 5th Theorem. So,it was a terrible embarrassment.FOR PEOPLE. BUT IT SAYS TO YOU AND ME AND OTHERS THATTHERE IS SOMETHING AT WORK IN THE INTELLECTUALPROFILE BEHIND THE CROP FORMATIONS THAT IS CAPABLE OFTHAT KIND OF SOPHISTICATION.It is stunning to realize that it's there. These are not just trampled masses ofwheat. There is a mind behind it, of course. There is an intellectual profile andthat's the one I'm tracking, tracking, tracking all the time and I tell you the truth,Linda. I've learned a heck of a lot about mathematics in studying crop circles.Euclid stopped short with Book 13, Proposition 12. If he had continued, hewould have got the four crop circle theorems and perhaps because he didn'tknow the musical ratios as we do today, he would not have even got that. Butthe 5th Theorem has turned out to be a most amazing geometrical theorembecause it's in Science News on their web page and it's also in the MathematicsTeacher from literally 1998. The theorem involves circles which expand andcontract and as they pulse, they make these shapes - the triangle, the square andthey hit musical notes.Now, I've never been able to see it done, but you could put the 5th Theorem ona moving screen and it would pulse like a heart beat and at certain points, amusical note would come out and a crop circle theorem that's appeared in thefields of England would come out from this. Geometry does not move. It'sfrozen, as you say. But now you have to alter your chapter next time and it'smoving geometry now, not frozen.WE SEE SLICES OF IT.Yeah, I know. We see a little window here, a little window there. But whathappened when the Litchfield thing came down is that I realized the 5thTheorem involved concentric circles expanding and contracting and that the 5thTheorem was a general theorem."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Aerial photograph of Litchfield, England wheat formation discoveredJuly 6, 1995, about 200 feet in diameter, © 1995 by Lucy Pringle.Theorem V geometry behind Litchfield, England wheat formation.Diagram © 1996 b Gerald S. Hawkins and Freddy Silva.You could describe it this way: geometry drawn inside targets, inside concentriccircles. I think that was the final version of the 5th Theorem that you haveprinted now.IN MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS.Yeah. We got it in Mathematics Teacher in 1998.THAT'S RIGHT. AND EVEN THEN, PEOPLE HADN'T SPOTTED THECONNECTION.Ye s .I'M LOOKING AT THE (LITCHFIELD 1995) GEOMETRY AND IREALIZE THERE WAS A THREE YEARS DISTANCE BETWEEN THELITCHFIELD FORMATION WHICH IS SO EXTRAORDINARY ANDYOUR NOT PUBLISHING THE 5TH THEOREM UNTIL THREEYEARS LATER. SO, THIS COMPLEX FORMATION ENDED UPPROVOKING YOU TO SEE EVEN YET A FURTHER REFINEMENT.Absolutely. I've learned a lot from crop circles, but, Linda, I've learned a lotfrom studying Stonehenge. We didn't know there was this 56 year cycle. Wedidn't know about the effect of the high moon and the low moon. And I wasable to help Prof. Alexander Thom (Chair of Engineering Science, Oxford) a lotfrom my work on Stonehenge in interpreting his. So, one does learn by studyingthe present and the past. And I have learned a heck of a lot from the crop circlesfrom the mathematical point of view.And of course, the trouble is with skeptics and people who are alwaysembarrassed about new things that there is always an escape hatch they will use.And of course, the escape hatch for crop circles is, 'They are all made byhoaxers. Hoaxers can do anything. Hoaxers are smart.'And to close the lid down on that escape hatch and keep the skeptics quietabout it, we have to dispose of the hoax theory. And that of course is not up tome. All I do is study the intellectual profile and say that the crop circles and, ofcourse, ancient stone circles themselves show an intellect which is verysurprising.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"More Information:New Printing.
