August 24, 2001 Depuyer, Montana - The first mutilated cow in Montanaofficially reported to law enforcement this summer was discovered on June 12on the Don Reishus ranch in Depuyer between Conrad and Great Falls. DonReishus, Sr., is in his seventies now and could not believe he was seeing anotherjaw stripped to the bone, eye removed, teat removed and rectum cored out - allwithout blood like others he had seen in the 1970s on his same Montana ranch.His neighbor, Karl Rappold, could not believe that the same day, June 12, hefound one of his older (5 years) 2000 pound bulls alive with its huge tail cutcleanly and bloodlessly off about six inches from the base of the bull's spine.The cut was smooth \"like you would take a circular saw through it,\" but noblood, no fluid of any kind. Completely dry.\"Unfortunately, neither rancher took any photographs at the time. But in myinvestigations of unusual animal deaths, there have been several incidents inwhich tails of cattle have been removed. Three examples shown below werediscovered in Oakley, Idaho on October 8, 1989; Sterling, Colorado on April20, 1976; and Motcombe, England in July 1993.

Photograph © 1993 by owner,Brian Cherrett.Karl Rappold's grandfather began homesteading the family's Depuyer, Montanaranch in 1882. In the past 120 years, nothing like what happened to his bull onJune 12 has ever happened. Karl, who is now 49-years-old, has always workedthe ranch and talked to me about finding his mutilated bull in a state of shock. Interview:Karl Rappold, Rancher, Depuyer, Montana: \"It was early morning when ithappened. When I went over to salt the cows, the bull was missing. And I wentlooking for him and found him standing there in the corner of the fence and histail had been amputated, but there was no blood or signs of anything other thanit had been completely cut off - the bone, the tail and everything. It was cutprobably 4 or 6 inches from the base of the spine. He didn't move or anything.He let me walk right up to him and he just stood there."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"FOUR INCHES OF THE TAIL WAS HANGING THERE?Ye s .WAS IT CUT THROUGH AS YOU WOULD A SAUSAGE?Yeah, it was cut straight through. It's very smooth.IF YOU WERE GOING TO CUT THROUGH A BULL'S TAIL FOUR INCHESFROM THE SPINE, COULD YOU DO IT?Well, not while he was alive without having him in captivity.BECAUSE THE BULL WOULD JUST GO CRAZY?Ye s .WHAT KIND OF INSTRUMENT WOULD YOU USE IF HE WASANESTHETIZED?Well, you'd have to have some kind of very sharp instrument. To get through thesize of the bone that was cut, it would almost take a saw which would leave arough edge. But this had no rough edge at all. There was no ragged meat oranything. Everything was just completely smooth where it was cut - the hide, thebone, the meat and everything.NO BLOOD AT ALL?No blood at all.HAD YOU SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS BEFORE?Well, we did have a mutilation of a 2-year-old heifer about ten years ago, butwhen I first seen this I couldn't figure out what happened to him until I ran intodon Reishus in town and he told me his cow had been mutilated and then Ifigured it was the same thing that had happened down here.IN THE OTHER MUTILATION 10 YEARS AGO, WAS THE TAIL ALSO CUTOFF?No, the sex organs were removed. The left eye and part of the skin, the hide wasskinned up from the backside in between her legs. Her udders were removed andup to the naval.DID YOU HAVE SUCH MUTILATIONS OF YOUR ANIMALS BACK IN THE1970S WHEN THE GREAT FALL AREA HAD NEARLY SEVENTY CASESIN TWO YEARS?No, we didn't have any in the 1970s. We didn't have any until it was 1991 or1992.WHEN YOU WENT UP TO HIS HEAD, DID HE ACKNOWLEDGE YOU INANY WAY LIKE TRY TO MOVE WHE N YOU WE RE THE RE ?He followed me when I started to walk away to go back to the vehicle. Hefollowed me all the way back to the vehicle sort of like a dog would.IS THAT NORMAL?No.BECAUSE A BULL DOESN'T USUALLY FOLLOW ANYBODY?Right.WHEN HE FOLLOWED YOU BACK TO YOUR TRUCK, WHAT HAPPENEDTHEN?I just got in and left and that's when I went to town and ran into Don Reishus"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"and he said about his cow.WERE YOU GOING BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO FIND OUT FROM AVET ABOUT WHAT TO DO ABOUT THE BULL?No, I was just coming back to the ranch and had to go through town to get backfrom that pasture to the ranch here. Bull Goes Blind A Week LaterWHAT DID YOU THINK SHOULD BE DONE FOR THAT BULL?Nothing. There was no bleeding, so there wasn't anything that could be done.He just seemed to be in shock and when I checked on him that night, he wascoming out of it. And approximately a week later, he went blind.HOW DID YOU KNOW HE WENT BLIND?Because I brought him home here to the ranch and I put him in a pen down herewhere I could keep an eye on him. And in about a week he went blind.WHAT WAS THE FIRST SYMPTOM?I just went down one morning to feed him and he couldn't see. He was walkingalong bumping into the walls.COULD YOU SEE ANYTHING ABNORMAL IN HIS EYES?Yeah, his eyes had turned blue.SOLID BLUE?Yeah. The pupils were blue.THE SAME COLOR OF BLUE IN BOTH THE RIGHT AND LEFT SIDES?Yes, the one eye had less coloring than the other eye. He could see just a littlebit out of the one eye.IF YOU WERE GOING TO COMPARE THE BLUE COLOR THAT THOSEEYES TURNED, WHAT COLOR OF BLUE WOULD IT BE?Probably like a robin's egg - a real light color blue.THAT IS A COLOR THAT CAN HAPPEN TO EYE TISSUE IN THEPRESENCE OF HEAT OR RADIATION. I HAVE SEEN EXACTLY THATCOLOR ON OTHER CASES OF ANIMAL MUTILATIONS. AND YET YOURBULL WAS ALIVE AFTER THAT REMOVAL OF THE TAIL. DID YOULOOK AROUND TO SEE IF YOU COULD FIND ANY REMNANTS OF THETAIL OR TAIL HAIR?I couldn't find anything where he was at. He was in a big field, but in the generalarea where he was at I looked to find the tail, but I could not find any sign of it.IN THAT WEEK BETWEEN HIS LOSING THAT TAIL AND THE EYESGOING BLUE, WAS THERE ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THAT WEEK THATYOU OR ANYONE ELSE MIGHT HAVE HEARD OR SEEN, MAYBE EVENLATE AT NIGHT?No.NOT ANYTHING?Nope.WHAT ABOUT FROM THE OTHER RANCHERS AROUND YOU? ANYREPORTS OF ANYTHING UNUSUAL?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"No.I GUESS THE QUESTION IS: WAS THIS A RESIDUE OF SOMETHINGFROM THE FIRST ASSAULT ON THE TAIL? OR DID SOMETHING ELSEHAPPEN LATER THAT PRODUCED THE EFFECT OF HEAT ORRADIATION ON THOSE EYES?Yeah. That I could not tell you.WHAT HAPPENED TO THE BULL?He was put down.YOU HAD HIM PUT TO SLEEP?Yeah, he's been destroyed.TO PUT HIM OUT OF HIS MISERY.Yeah, he was blind so he was no good to us.WERE YOU CONCERNED THAT WHATEVER HAD HAPPENED TO HIMMIGHT CONTAMINATE HIS MUSCLE TISSUE?Yes. We could have gotten $1,000 for him as hamburger. But who knows what'shappened to that meat?IN TALKING WITH OTHER RANCHERS, HAS ANYBODY ELSE HADANYTHING QUITE LIKE THAT HAPPEN BEFORE?Not that I'm aware where the animal lived.THEY'VE LOST TAILS ON DEAD ANIMALS THAT WERE MUTILATED?Ye s .DID YOU TALK WITH YOUR SHERIFF?Yeah, we talked with him some.WHAT DID HE SAY?Well, at first they weren't too sure about what was going on until the one atTaliaferro's. (Mark Taliaferro cow mutilation. See Part 3) When they got thatone, then they started an investigation. The deal with the bull is pretty hard.They don't know what to think of it, whether it's part of the same (mutilation)deal or not.THE UNSOLVED MYSTERY WOULD BE: WHO WAS CUTTING THROUGHTHAT BULL'S TAIL AND WHERE AND WHY DID THEY STOP AT THEREMOVAL OF THE TAIL ONLY?Yeah. I haven't been able to figure that out and I don't know how - this bullweighed 2000 pounds and you just don't walk up to a 2000 pound bull and cuthis tail off.YES, HOW WAS HE KEPT IN ANY KIND OF CONDITION THAT THE TAILCOULD BE CUT OFF CLEANLY? AND BLOODLESSLY?Yeah, I was talking to my veterinarian about it and he doesn't have a clue either.DID HE SAY THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BLOOD?Yeah, definitely when a tail is removed up that high and on that big of a meatbase, there has got to be blood. Or there should be blood.DID THE VET EVER SEE THE BULL HIMSELF?No."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INTERESTING FOR HIM TO SEE THAT CUT.HE MIGHT HAVE DONE AN EXAMINATION TO SEE IF IT HAD BEENCAUTERIZED SOME WAY THAT PREVENTED THE BLEEDING.WHEN YOU'VE GOTTEN TOGETHER WITH OTHER RANCHERS TOTALK ABOUT THE MUTILATIONS, WHAT DOES EVERYBODY SAY?They just can't figure out what the deal is and how this can be happeningwithout someone seeing it because this time of year, we're all out there baling atnight and the night the end of June that the Taliaferro's lost their cow, I was outhere bailing most of the night and never seen anything. And I'm right next doorto them only about a mile away.\" More Information:Current List of Cattle Mutilations in Great Falls, Montana area in summer of2001:1) Don Reishus, mutilated cow in Dupuyer discovered June 12.
