Solar radiation heated the comet's iceand rocks causing an outgassing of water and dust. The water molecules brokedown in the sun's ultraviolet light into oxygen and hydrogen atoms. Thehydrogen atoms interacted with the sun's coronal plasma and glowed brightly.The dark circle in upper left corner is the sun masked by an instrument thatblots out sunlight. The white circle within the disk shows the size and positionof the actual sun.During SOHO's operations the past six years, it has discovered more than 365comets, the most of any instrument in astronomy's history. Most of those havebeen discovered by amateur stargazers studying the SOHO Sungazer website,not professional astronomers.The Chandra X-Ray Observatory operating since 1999 continues to giveastronomers unprecedented images of, and insights into, some new and oldcosmic objects. The following are summaries of recent Chandra news releases.Supernova of G292.0+1.8"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"G292 is a young, oxygen-rich supernova remnant with a pulsarat its center surrounded by outflowing material.Photo courtesy Chandra/NASA/CXC/Rutgers/J. Hughes et al.NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory captured this rapidly expanding gas shellfrom an exploded sun (supernovae) known as G292.0+1.8. The gas shellmeasures 36 light years across and contains large amounts of elements such asoxygen, neon, magnesium, silicon and sulfur. In fact, G292 is one of threeknown oxygen-rich supernovae in our Milky Way Galaxy. Scientists areintrigued by them because they are one of the primary sources of heavy elementsnecessary to form planets and life forms. G-292 exploded some 1600 years ago.Embedded at the center of this cloud of multimillion degree gas is a point-likesource of high x-ray energies suspected to be a rapidly spinning neutron star.\"This finding is very important since it would allow us to conclusively associatethis young, oxygen-rich supernova remnant with a core collapse in a massive starsupernova explosion,\" said John Hughes of Rutgers University in the October 1,2001 Astrophysical Journal. Astronomers have been trying to confirm that thetrigger for supernova explosions in oxygen-rich stars is due to the collapse of amassive star into a neutron star, one of the most dense objects in the universe. Inthat collapse, tremendous amounts of energy and gasses are released.First X-rays of Herbig-Haro Objects RevealShockingly High-Speed Gas Jet from Young StarFirst x-rays detected on October 8, 2000 in Herbig-Haro (HH2) object on left, ahigh-velocity gas jetwhere new stars are forming in Orion Nebula.

HH objects are found in regions where new stars areforming and it's hypothesized their origin is in collisions of high-velocity gasemitted from young stars with clouds of dust and gas. But only recently on"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"October 8, 2000 with the refined resolution of the Chandra X-ray Observatory'sCCD Imaging Spectrometer have x-rays finally been detected.The image on the left is a Palomar Digital Sky Survey of the region in the OrionNebula that contains the Herbig-Haro objects known as HH1 and HH2. Theenlargement on the right shows a green circle around X-ray source HH2. Thex-rays indicate a gas jet moving at the shocking speed of 600,000 miles per hour.At that speed, you could go from Los Angeles to San Diego and back in onesecond. It is thought that in this instance the high-speed jet is slamming into aslower moving cloud of gas. The resulting shock wave heats gas up to a milliondegrees Fahrenheit.Mysterious M87 Gas JetNASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has given astronomers their most detailed look to dateat the X-ray jetblasting out of the nucleus of M87, a giant elliptical galaxy 50 million light years away intheconstellation Virgo. The extreme left bright object shown in the above images is the brightgalactic nucleusof what is thought to be a supermassive black hole. Image courtesy Chandra/NASA/MIT.A team of astronomers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology inCambridge, Massachusetts used the Chandra X-ray Observatory on July 17-18,2000 to observe M87, a giant elliptical galaxy 50 million light years away in theconstellation Virgo. There astronomers have puzzled over an irregular series of\"beads\" that blast out of the nucleus of M87. The MIT team's leader, HermanMarshall, says that one of the remarkable findings of the investigation is that thebeads, or \"knots,\" near the M87 core are much brighter in X-rays than thefarthest beads, relative to the radio bands and the optical discovery of theintense jet by the Hubble Telescope. While the exact reason for this progressiveX-ray dimming is unknown, it is likely to be related to the slowing of the jet as itmoves outward.The extremely bright bead to the far left in the above images is the brightgalactic nucleus of what is thought to be a supermassive black hole. The jet itselfis perhaps produced by strong electromagnetic forces created by matter swirlingtoward the supermassive black hole. These forces pull gas and magnetic fieldsaway from the black hole along its axis of rotation in a narrow jet. Inside the jet,shock waves produce high-energy electrons that spiral around the magneticfield. As they do, there is a \"synchrotron\" process that creates the clumps orknots. Synchrotron radiation is caused by high-speed charged particles, such aselectrons, that emit radiation as they are accelerated in a magnetic field.The spectrum and intensity of the X-rays from the galactic nucleus also indicatethat this radiation is not caused by hot gas from material falling into thesupermassive black hole. Instead, scientists think that a high-energy outflowclose to the black hole could be producing the X-rays by a synchrotron process."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"We b s it e s :http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/http://chandra.harvard.edu/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
