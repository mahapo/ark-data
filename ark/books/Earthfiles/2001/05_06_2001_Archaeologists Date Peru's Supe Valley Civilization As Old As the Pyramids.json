Now Caral, Peru is the oldest city in theWestern Hemisphere. Even though the site and seventeen others were firstdiscovered in 1905, age was never precisely dated. Now Jonathan Haas, Curatorof Anthropology at the Field Museum in Chicago and co-author of the report,says that disintegration of carbon in plant fibers in the ruin walls definitely datebetween 2627 B.C. and 2020 B. C. That makes the Peruvian Supe Valley hometo a civilization as old and advanced as those in Egypt where the pyramids werebeing built, to Mesopotamia where the Sumerian culture dominated, to theIndus Valley, China and the newly discovered Central Asian civilization nearIran and Afghanistan which was making fine ceramics and had its ownindependent writing symbols. See: Earthfiles Science report 05-05-01.The new dating on Caral \"changes history as we know it,\" said Ruth ShandySolis, Excavation Chief at Caral and Director of the San Marcos NationalUniversity's Archaeological and Anthropological Museum in Lima. Perhaps3,000 people lived in Caral and 32 flutes made from pelican and condor boneswere found together in a shallow, sandy pit. Shandy said, \"They were foundtogether. That makes us think the instruments belonged to an orchestra. Theyare different sizes and with different decorate designs.\"So much of the Caral site is still buried in the sand. Some archaeologists thinkwhen more is known that the Supe Valley people could be older than 3000 B.C. Still standing are two huge stone structures weighing a ton or more that seemto be an entrance to the largest mound that is 60 feet high and 500 feet across.There are symmetrical staircases on the big mound which is surrounded bysmaller mounds and ruins covering about 200 acres.One of the mysteries is that most ancient Peruvian towns grew very slowly. ButHaas says that Caral emerged \"like a big bang. It was very rapid.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
