Since the end of April 2001, pregnant mareshave lost 477 fetuses and stillborn foals. Last year, only 46 aborted foals orfetuses were reported to the University of Kentucky Livestock DiseaseDiagnostic Center. That means something has caused a 700% increase in fetaldeaths.The phenomenon is now called Mare Reproductive Loss Syndrome. Sixteendifferent breeds of horses have been affected from thoroughbreds to QuarterHorses. And this week dead fetuses were also reported in some female mules.The weather was very strange in Kentucky this year going from very cold anddry in March to record breaking warm temperatures the first two weeks of Aprilthat were interrupted by a severe freeze followed by more warm and dryweather. According to agronomy experts, the unusual heat in drought conditionscaused rapid growth of grasses and a concentration of molds and fungi that liveon grasses which can produce toxins that cause fetal abortions.One well known veterinarian, Tom Riddle, D.V.M., of the Rood and RiddleEquine Hospital in Lexington, has worked for twenty-three years caring forKentucky thoroughbred horses, was the first doctor to report an unusual numberof deaths to the University of Kentucky Gluck Equine Research Center and"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"described for me today how it all began three weeks ago.Interview:Tom Riddle, D.V.M., Rood and Riddle Equine Hospital, Lexington,Kentucky: \"I saw my first two cases on April 26 and I identified those when Iwas ultrasounding mares to determine the sex of their fetuses. And this is aprocedure that is done between 60 and 70 days of gestation. I went to a farmjust to fetal sex six mares and two of the six mares on rectal palpations, palpatedto be pregnant. But when I ultrasounded them, the fetus was dead and the fluidappeared to be almost like a snowstorm.Ultrasound of developing horse fetus, courtesy Univrsity of Kentucky, 2001.WHEN YOU'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?That's actually something we haven't seen before. It was a very unusual finding.I've seen somewhat similar cases when the fetus is decomposing and themembranes are breaking down and there is some material in the fluid. But Ihadn't seen this exact thing in the past. I wasn't sure what to make of it. Findingtwo dead fetuses in a single day doing these fetal sexing exams was veryunusual. Last year, I did about 400 fetal sexings and during the whole year Ithink I found only five dead fetuses out of 400. So, two in a single day was veryunusual.And then the following day on April 27, I was in another county doing morefetal sexings and two of those six had dead fetuses in them very similar inappearance. By this time, I was becoming very concerned. I talked with the farmmanager, told them I had seen two cases that were comparable the previous day.I was concerned they might be related and didn't know what was going on.The following day I found three more cases and immediately phoned thediagnostic laboratory to tell them we would be sending some fetal material in.And I called the Univ. of Kentucky Gluck Research Center to tell them Ithought there was a previously unrecognized disease syndrome going on. Theysaid they had not had any previous reports. They would make note of it andwould visit the initial farm to collect data."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Veterinarian pathologist examing placenta containing dead horse fetus,courtesy University of Kentucky, 2001.As far as I know, it's unique in the Kentucky breeding history. I'm not aware ofany other situation that is comparable. Many veterinarians started ultrasoundingand found many mares had either aborted or were carrying a dead fetus.ALL HAD AN ULTRASOUND \"SNOWSTORM\" IN THE AMNIOTICFLUID?Yes, common.HAS ANY LAB DETERMINED WHAT IT IS?No, not to my knowledge. No significant results from that fluid.FROM YOUR VETERINARIAN POINT OF VIEW, THE POSSIBILITYOF HIGH TEMPERATURES IN APRIL FOLLOWED BY A FROST IN ADROUGHT CONDITION THAT COULD CAUSE SOMETHING TOXICTO ACCUMULATE IN THE GRASS AND CAUSE THIS. DO YOU HAVEANY COMMENT ON THAT?It certainly makes good sense to me that it could be the situation. Our weatherhas been very unusual. We've had extreme drought in the last 6 weeks and wedid have a heavy frost in mid-April.RIGHT AFTER VERY HOT DAYS, ISN'T THAT TRUE?Yes. And talking with agronomists, they are telling me that conditions were ripefor a mold or fungal growth to become prevalent.IS THE FACT THAT WHATEVER IS HAPPENING IS AFFECTING SOMANY DIFFERENT KINDS OF HORSES AND MULES DOES THATGIVE YOU ANY INSIGHT IN ANY DIRECTION IN YOUR LONGEXPERIENCE AS A VETERINARIAN ABOUT WHAT COULD BEHAPPENING?It certainly makes you think that it's something likely in the environment. Itwouldn't be limited to a feed or a hay because there are so many managementprograms, so many different types of horses effected. And the one thing we havein common is the weather. And the one thing we have in common is that thesehorses are grazing in pastures.IF IT IS A TOXIN OF SOME SORT, WHY ARE THE FOALSAFFECTED AND FETUSES AND NOT THE MARE MOTHERS?My feeling on that is we know fetuses and young foals are going to be muchmore susceptible to toxins than adults. Adults are going to be able to deal withthose, but in foals the toxin is going to be more than that young age can handle.HAVE YOU SEEN ANY SYMPTOMS IN THE MARE THEMSELVES?There is a syndrome that has become apparent in the last 2 or 3 weeks that isrunning concurrently with early abortions and late term still births withpericarditis, inflammation in the sac that contains the heart.IN THE MARE MOTHERS?We're seeing it in all ages. We've seen it in foals, yearlings, all the way up tomares.WHAT WOULD CAUSE INFLAMMATION IN THE SAC AROUND THEHEART?I'm not an internal medicine person and that's a question that is being studiedvery careful. We're not sure. We're not sure. Some of these mares havepneumonia changes in their lungs. But they are also developing a lot of fluidaround their hearts. We are strongly suspicious that it's related to the syndromeof all the reproductive problems.OF ALL THE ABORTED FETUSES AND FOALS.Right.DOES THIS MEAN THAT THESE MARES THAT HAVE CARRIED THEFETUSES AND FOALS THEMSELVES, THEIR HEALTH COULD BE"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"AT DANGER IN THE FUTURE?We don't know how big the risk is, but certainly since we've seen pericarditiscases, it's possible the mare could be at risk.HOW MANY?In my practice, I have only seen one case of pericarditis.BUT OTHERS HAVE BEEN SEEING THE SAME THING?Ye s , t h e y h a v e .WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW TRYINGTO COME UP WITH AN ANSWER?I'm relying on the team of sciences assembled by the Gluck Center to analyzethe data. A survey is being compiled to send to all the local farms to better studythe epidemiology of the disease. Data is being submitted daily and analyzed. So,it's a daunting task. There is so much material to analyze. I'm having to haveconfidence in the researchers that they will be able to analyze the data and comeup with an answer.\" Perspective of Veterinarian EpidemiologistTHE VETERINARIAN EPIDEMIOLOGIST IN CHARGE OF TRYING TOFIND OUT WHAT HAS CAUSED ALL THE FETAL AND STILLBORNDEATHS IS DR. DAVID POWELL AT THE UNIVERSITY OF KENTUCKY'SGLUCK EQUINE RESEARCH CENTER.David Powell, D.V.M., Veterinarian Epidemiologist, Gluck EquineResearch Center, University of Kentucky: \"I think the climatic data indicatesthat the conditions were conducive to a very rapid growth of pasture, coupled tothe drought situation that has also developed. Whatever is in the pasture couldbe concentrated and this is one of the factors that is leading us to concentrateour investigations on the role of some form of pasture contamination.IF IT WERE SOMETHING IN THE GRASS THAT THE HORSES WEREEATING THAT WAS RELATING TO SOME KIND OFMETEOROLOGICAL ASPECT, WOULDN'T YOU HAVE SEENSOMETHING LIKE THIS IN PREVIOUS YEARS?The pattern that was seen in 1981 is very reminiscent to the pattern we areseeing at the present time, but not to the same scale. Unfortunately, in 1981 andalso in 1980 when this was investigated, they were unable to come up with asatisfactory answer about what was causing the problem.I BELIEVE IN ONE OF THE PRESS CONFERENCES THAT YOU SAIDSIMILAR CASES OF ABORTED FOALS WERE ALSO HAPPENING INILLINOIS, OHIO AND PENNSYLVANIA?Certainly the evidence from reports that we are reporting is that this problem isnot restricted to Kentucky and is occurring in states around Kentucky,particularly to the north.DOES THAT CONTRADICT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THERE WASSOME METEOROLOGICAL UNIQUENESS IN KENTUCKY TIED INWITH THE TEMPERATURES THAT WOULD HAVE CAUSEDMYCOTOXINS?Not necessarily, because all these states are on the eastern side of the UnitedStates and are very close to Kentucky. So we feel that climatic patterns couldrelate to those states.WHAT ABOUT AN INFECTIOUS AGENT?We have done exhaustive tests to look at all the common infectious agents thathave been identified previously with this type of syndrome and all those testshave come up negative.HAVE YOU HAD ANY RESPONSE FROM ANN VENEMAN WHO ISTHE AGRICULTURE SECRETARY?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yes, we have been liaising with USDA and a number of experts in various fieldswill be coming to Kentucky over the next few days to help in the investigation.HOW WILL THEY DO THAT BEYOND WHAT YOU ALL AREDOING?They have expertise in epidemiology to help us with a survey we are going toestablish to get a better handle on risk factors on farms involved in thisinvestigation.\" Could Toxins from Molds and Fungi Be the Culprit?THE PRESIDENT OF THE KENTUCKY VETERINARIAN MEDICALASSOCIATION AND THE KENTUCKY ASSOCIATION OF EQUINEPRACTITIONERS ALSO THINKS TOXINS FROM MOLDS AND FUNGIARE THE CAUSE OF THE DEATHS. HE IS ROGER MURPHY, D.V.M.,WHO DESCRIBES MEDICAL FINDINGS IN AFFECTED PLACENTAS,LUNGS AND HEARTS.Roger Murphy, D.V.M., President, Kentucky Veterinarian MedicalAssociation and Kentucky Association of Equine Practitioners, Lexington,Kentucky: \"I would say the predominant insult is to the placental tissuesthemselves because they are the first line, they are extremely vascular. Anddopamine that is associated with most of the toxins that have such a devastatingeffect on the microcapillaries of tissue would be obviously show a major effectin the microcapillaries of the placenta.WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT WOULD CUT OFF OXYGEN TOTHE DEVELOPING FETUS OR FOAL ...Exactly.THEY WOULD THEN DIE OF ASPHYXIATION ESSENTIALLY...Or, the placenta gets so inflamed and lets go that they die of asphyxiation. Andthey are delivered early or delivered compromised when the placenta doesn't letgo .ARE DEAD.They are compromised, unthrifty, and they are whacked because they have notbeen nourished. They are extremely malnourished and immuno-suppressed andsubject to a lot of other outside influences when they do come live.YOU'VE SEEN WEAK AND SICK FOALS THAT HAVE NOT DIEDBEFORE BIRTH IN ADDITION TO ALL THE DEAD THIRDTRIMESTER FOALS?Right. They are either born dead or live several hours and die. Or live severaldays being treated and die. Or they live at this period six or eight weeks and theyare just unthrifty, but are going to make it. They just aren't going to be the mostrobust foals. To foals that came perfectly normal with the placenta completelycompromised and are doing well. So, we've seen the whole gamut.WHY DO YOU THINK THERE WOULD BE INFLAMMATION IN THEPERICARDIUM OF THE MARES THAT HAD DELIVERED THESEDEAD FOALS?For the same reason that would be in the yearlings that are out grazing this grass.If the toxins are creating inflammation of the membrane, the pericardium is athin membrane. The lungs have a thin walled membrane. The fetal tissues aremulti-layered membranes and highly vascular and they secrete fluid. So if thosemembranes are inflamed, the natural response of the body is to bathe that areain fluids to try to reduce the inflammation.THE FACT THAT IT'S HEART, LUNG AND THE AMNIOTIC SACWOULD ALL THREE AREAS OF GREAT BLOOD EXCHANGE INTHE BODIES?Right.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"More Information:Some Toxin Producers:1) Ergot is metabolic byproduct of fusarium mold.2) Phytoestrogens are the toxin produced by the white clover mold or fungi.3) Cyanide is another toxin produced in Dutch white clover.4) Endophyte = toxin produced by fescue grass in response to the fusariummold.Fescue is an indigenous Kentucky grass.
