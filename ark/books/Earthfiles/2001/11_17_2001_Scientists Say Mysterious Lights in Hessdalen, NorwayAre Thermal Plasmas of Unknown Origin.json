Teodorani.Red arrow points at Hessdalen in northeastern Norway.November 17, 2001 Hessdalen, Norway - Over the past decade, many eyewitnesses inthe valley of Hessdalen in northeastern Norway have reported flickering, pulsing, lights thatchange shape. Norwegian engineers in 1984, lead by Prof. Erling Strand of ProjectHessdalen, demonstrated that the light phenomenon is indeed measurable. Since 1998, thescience team has taken automatic video frames of the lights in real time. But the researchstarted to assume even more physical relevance in August 2000 and August 2001 whenItalian astrophysicists joined the Norwegian engineers in a joint study with radio spectrumanalyzers, photographs, videotape and spectroscopes. The results can be broken down intotwo groups: 95% are thermal plasmas and 5% are unidentified solid objects.

His missionwas financed by the Italian Committee for Project Hessdalen. He says there are at leastthirty regions on the earth today in which similar mysterious lights are reported. Some ofthose are the Marfa lights in Texas, the Ontario Lake lights in Canada, the Ural lights inRussia, and the Victoria lights in Argentina. He is also aware that mysterious lights havebeen associated with worldwide crop formations. In the mid-1990s, biophysicist W. C.Levengood of Michigan published his discoveries about changes in formation crops andsoils which indicate that rotating plasmas are involved.No one yet knows the source of such thermal plasmas and their existence has not beenacknowledged by main stream physics to date. But physicists have been coming to Dr.Teodorani since he released the 2001 Hessdalen study. This week, I talked with him aboutthe lights he and his team monitored.One of a red and yellow light's several changing shapes on August 18, 2001.Video frame by S. Righini. Processing and analysis by M. Teodorani. Interview:Massimo Teodorani, Ph.D., Astrophysicist, Naples Observatory, Bologna, Italy: \"Wesaw two types of targets. Most of the ones are plasma-like lights. So, nothing with structure,but just like balls of lights with no geometry or so. This is 95% of the things we saw withour own eyes.These plasma balls could last up to two hours?Yes. They could last up to two hours according to reports by Dr. Erling Strand who is theprofessor directing the project in Norway.That would exclude ball lightning?Absolutely, yes.That is a very short phenomenon?Ye s .Please describe what you've seen and what the characteristics are that make the lightphenomenon so amazing to you scientists and why you are investigating.Yes, what is amazing is the fact that the phenomenon is very energetic. And so, with ourmeasurement we want to understand what is the physical mechanism with which thisenergy is emitted. This is the scope of our investigation.What we have seen is that the phenomena is very complex. It is not simple light balls, butwhen we process the data we see that many small light balls vibrate around a commonbarycenter. So it is something like a center force that is ejecting balls or the mini-balls aregoing around the center body. It is quite complicated."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Structure of a blinking light is shown in this processed frame that isthe summation of 30 contiguous video frames (1/25 sec each).

We don't know yet the reason about that yet, but we sawsomething that was like a rectangle. It suddenly changes from an amorphous plasma to arectangle. It happened transiently and we saw it and it is in my paper, EMBLA 2001: TheOptical Mission."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"An enlarged picture of the rectangle after change from sphereand the corresponding 3-D Point Spread Function (PSF) in orderto obtain simultaneously the peak intensity and the apparent dimension in pixelof the target. Date: August 18, 2001. Image processing by M. Teodorani.So you were watching something round like a sphere of plasma and it suddenlytransformed into a rectangle?Absolutely. At first we thought it was a sort of instrumental effect due to the video camera.But after we compared the photo of this same phenomenon with the video of the samephenomenon, we saw that they were the same thing.That is a plasma in spite of that geometrical shape because we can do certain analyses bystudying the distribution of light. And also by taking the spectra. We see that one is aplasma. So, it is strange. A plasma phenomenon that we can describe, but not yet tell whatis the main reason that is causing it.Is it fair to say that none of you or any other astrophysicists have ever documentedthis kind of plasma interaction and transformation before now?No (we haven't). To me it doesn't result that other astrophysicists have found this. I knowthat some astrophysicists have seen the light phenomenon as amorphous light balls, but it isthe first time that we saw that this year.You have concluded in your scientific paper that these are 'thermal plasmas ofunknown origin.' Why?Because if I take spectrum and I plot the spectrum in a flux wavelength, that spectrumresembles typical Max Plank curve which is typical of a cocktail of ions and electrons. Thatspeaks very clearly. And we can also measure the temperature and the temperature was inthat case a little bit higher than the solar temperature; 6,500 Kelvin degrees.Would this be considered a low energy plasma or a high energy plasma?It is a quite high energy plasma. If you have some triggering cause that is creating theplasma, we expect that the plasma expands. This is a cooling mechanism. We expect that itexpands and in that case a temperature must drop. But we saw that those lights werechanging shapes suddenly from very big to very small and the phenomenon was therestanding still. But the temperature was just constant because we measured the temperaturein both phases. So, there must be some kind of self-heating mechanism that keeps thetemperature constant. This is highly anomalous.It is highly anomalous because you are defining a plasma that is self-sustainingtemperature in a way that you have neveer identified before?Yes. Absolutely yes. I don't know how it is possible that Nature is spontaneously is able todo that. Anyway, we deduce that the plasma is trapped inside a sort of magnetic cage andthe magnetic cage closes around the plasma and keeps it fixed in some way, prevents itfrom expanding. But where does it come from? We don't know. In a way we have ameasured correlation between magnetic perturbation and the apparition of lights. This isanother discovery.Lights On Radar But Not Seen by Human EyesSometimes the lights are not lights, but invisible. In fact, Prof. Erling Strand, my friend andcolleague from Norway, in 1994 got about 34 radio tracks of phenomenon that sometimes"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"were visible, but sometimes were not visible. So, the radar was giving exactly the positionand velocity, but it was not visible. So, we have a big suspicion that this kind ofphenomenon can shift into low energy and so become invisible.So it shifts to a lower frequency that the retina of the human eye cannot see...A lower... yes,And yet on radar, it is still there?Ye s .That is consistent with at least twelve years of eyewitness accounts in England, myselfincluded, in which through an infrared scope or starscope I have been able to seewhat looked like an oval of light change into a square of light that was pulsing. I sawthis along with six other people and we could only see the pulsing light in thestarscope with infrared. We could not see it with our eyes.This is very interesting. We also used the infrared detector, but we have it pointed it at thelights themselves. But how were you able to point if you were not able to see?We discovered it totally by a fluke. I had this instrument and somebody yelled thatthey thought they saw a flash of red which we all seemed to see at the same time. Thatwas the only thing. And just as you can lift up something in a direction, I lifted thescope and saw the oval that had a pulsing to it, very bright, in the infrared starscope.We passed the scope around and no one could see anything in the dark with their eyes,but through the instrument there was the pulsing oval. We were all shocked when ittransformed immediately into a square of pulsing light similar to what you havedescribed.Absolutely. Very interesting. Next year we are also going to use a more sophisticatedinfrared detector. This is very interesting because we are going to use sensors to track thephenomenon with infrared, optical, radar and so on, so we can track them everywhere. Butwe need some money for that yet.A Few Solid Objects Amid the Thermal Plasmas - What Are They?I have become convinced as an investigative reporter that a lot is happening outsidethe range of the human retina.Yes, for sure. And I didn't tell you the other thing besides those plasmas which were 95% ofthe events. But we saw also in two or three cases compact (solid) objects. One appearedsuddenly when we were taking a photograph of each other on top of a mountain. It was aremembering photo and when the flash was activated, the object appeared. But it was not aplasma object because I analyzed it. It was just a polished surface, very clear.Mysterious object floating in sky appeared in a digital photo taken on August 19, 2001.On left is processed enlargement of the object that Dr. Massimo Teodorani concluded has a solid,polished surface. PSF of object on right. Processing and analysis by M. Teodorani.It is present in my paper and last year, we had one very small sphere. I could measure it. Itwas about 40 centimeters, sort of a probe. It arrived over our head. There were about three(of us who saw it) at night. It stopped 90 meters far from us near the trees and there itfloated standing still for a long time, about 15 minutes. I took a photograph of that and byanalyzing the frame, I could see that it was a solid. It was like alabaster (glowing) and I wasable to follow it with my binoculars very well.When you are describing the surface, you saw one that had a smooth, shiny surface.This one, did you say, was like alabaster glowing from the inside out?Yes. Yes. In that case, it was a sort of low luminosity, like a 100 watt bulb. Not more. Sowe don't know why in this valley there most are plasmas. In other cases, there are otherthings. So there is an overlap of the two phenomenon and we don't know if this overlap isby something different or by behavior of the same phenomenon. We don't know yet.An Unidentified Triangular Craft Hovers Over the Hessdalen ScientistsLast year we also saw a triangle in the sky."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"A triangle?Yes, you can get information on this by reading my EMBLA 2000 report indicated in thebibliographic reference of the last EMBLA 2001 study. Last year we saw the triangle, butwe couldn't document it because that day we didn't have a videocamera with us. It wasimpossible to follow it with a normal reflex camera. But it was just a triangle with threelights on the vertices. The lights were fixed, not blinking, and it was coming from northtowards us and it did stop exactly over us. There were five of us and when it was over us itstarted to make a rotation around its axis while it was standing still. And after someseconds, about 15 seconds, the lights faded very gradually and the triangle disappearedover our heads. This is a story, but unfortunately we couldn't document or takemeasurements. But it happened.That took place this past summer of 2001 and those triangles with the lights at thethree vertices have been reported in Belgium and England since at least 1990.I know, yes.How big would you estimate the size of the triangle you saw?It was practically impossible to understand. It was very big and I can only say that the sizewas about 10 times the moon. Probably more. I could see with my binocular that there wasa dark surface very well. But differently from the Belgium cases. There was no blinkingcenter light. There were only three lights fixed and then afterward fading gradually anddisappearing.I tell you that my friend is director of a radio astronomical station. He is a radio astronomerand I am an astrophysicist. There were two professors there who are engineers and anotherprofessor. And it was in fact incredible!You have five scientists who are all working in universities out trying to understandwhat these plasma spheres in the Hessdalen valley are and this object of triangle lights- you all see it and it stops right over you as if aware that you are there?Yes, yes, yes, it is exactly so. Of course, I have to tell what happens. I am a scientist andmy duty is not to select what I don't like or what is not convenient for me. We have to findout what it is. But we cannot document with data this. We were just witnesses because noone of us had a video camera. But we were 5 and we were all scientists. And one of them -I cannot tell you the name - felt a little bit like a sort of rocking motion.In himself?Yes, and it is very well known that very low frequency can interact with the human brain.You already have documented that some of the phenomenon associated with theplasma lights are long frequency radiowaves?Yes. but sometimes we see them and we also have cases we see only long radio waveswithout seeing anything. And of course, we could exclude any kind of manmade radiowaves, but what remained was one sort of Doppler waves if we interpret it in theastrophysical way, it is like a fast rotating ball which is accelerating high energy particles.The velocity was 100,000 kilometers per second and of course, this can be due only toparticles which are channeled along the magnetic field. This is the only interpretation thatwe can do.In the case of lights that don't appear in the photo, the temperature must be very low,something like 100 Kelvin or so.How high does it have to go to break into the frequency that the eye can see?I think it should reach something like 1,000 Kelvin probably, maybe 2000, the eye shouldbe able to see. But I haven't calculated precisely.That would mean that you have been able to document what seems like a temperaturerange that would go from 100 Kelvin to 1000 Kelvin out of the invisible range into thevisible range.Ye s .Yet, your instruments keep showing there is no temperature change from these plasmalights?Yes, this is when the phenomenon is inside, the temperature remains constant. This I candocument. We didn't use very much infrared detector, but in the case of the lights whenthey were on, they were just lighting, the temperature was established at a constant level.This is what I can say in spite of the fact that the phenomenon was changing dimension(size), but the temperature was always constant. We don't know why. We don't know thephysics that is behind all this."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Then this would be a huge physical anomaly because in the physics world that weunderstand so far, frequency of temperature and vibration you would think wouldbecome lower if it disappeared.Yes, when it disappeared, the frequency becomes lower.But you are saying that the temperature does not become lower, even when theseplasma spheres disappear?No, the temperature was not changing at all when the plasma was always there.Did the temperature go down when the plasma sphere disappeared to your eye, butwas still there on radar?This is a good question. My problem is that the spectrum we took when the plasma wasdisappearing was too weak. So, it was impossible to process it with good signal to noiseratio. So we cannot tell this yet.So it might have gone from 1000 degrees Kelvin in the visible range suddenly down to100 degrees Kelvin in the invisible range, but so far you haven't been able to getcontinual linear data?No, we have not. But I can tell you anyway that the phenomenon is not turning ongradually, but it turns on in a matter of 1 second. Just like when you turn on or turn off thelight. It goes away immediately. So, it's very difficult to see the shift in temperature unlesswe use a high speed photometer.Possible Sources of Plasma SpheresWhat would be the source behind these plasma spheres that have the ability totransform in shape and still don't lose their temperature?I am not able to tell this, but I can only deduce indirectly that the only way to keep aplasma self-consistent, self-contained, the only way to do that is we need a center force.We don't know yet the nature of that center force, but as an astrophysicist I can predict theexistence of some kind of mini black holes. In that case, if you take a mini black hole insidethe atmosphere, our atmosphere, what you have is a sort of potential well and the gas fallsinto the potential well. It gets very hot and remains there. If the mini black hole has angularmomentum, it can make also the shape of a disc, for instance, because it is rapidly rotating.Mini black holes have been predicted by theoreticians and they could be a component ofthe cosmic rays. This is one way.Another way, I don't know frankly what can it be if not a gravitational singularity whichsuddenly occurs in our atmosphere. Of course, the theory of wormholes has been settledtheoretically. But we are scientists, not engineers, and we have to imagine what can it be.What do you think it is going to take to get other astrophysicists around the world topay attention to not only your work, but the fact there is increasing evidence thatsome kind of unidentified plasma spheres with all of these strange characteristics areon this planet and scientists should investigate more?Yes, you are right. In fact, the scope and goal of this work with my colleagues was totrigger, to provoke my colleagues in order to give funds and to involve many otherscientists.\"Image Sources: All photographs and spectra used with permission of Dr. MassimoTeodorani.More Information:"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Websites:http://www.itacomm.net/PHhttp://hessdalen.hiof.nohttp://hessdalen.hiof.no/pict/1999/991204-7Mbyte.movCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
