Stringfield With permission, reprinted in Earthfiles.com © 2005 by Linda Moulton Howe. Pages 41-65 of the MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium Proceedings are entitled, \"The Fatal Encounter At Ft. Dix-McGuire: A Case Study: Status Report IV\" © 1985 by Leonard H. Stringfield. To be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 1 of Status Report IV, written for the June 28-30, 1985, MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium Proceedings in conjunction with the national MUFON conference held in Saint Louis, Missouri. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report V begins at Earthfiles 012805 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. \"ABSTRACT Leonard H. Stringfield: New testimonial evidence and a document are bared in Status Report IV, following the re-emergence in 1983 of the informant whose experience, as a witness, was first disclosed three years earlier and published as Case A3 in Status Report III, 1982. The source, a sergeant in the U. S. Air Force Security Police at McGuire AFB, adds substantive information relative to the reported fatal encounter on January 18, 1978, between an alleged alien entity and a Ft. Dix MP and relates his firsthand observation, while on duty, when the slain entity was found on an abandoned runway at McGuire AFB. The source also reveals his sensitive involvement with authorities in various agencies following his discharge from service because of his disclosures to this writer. Also reported are the communications with the source since 1980 and an arranged meeting between the source and a colleague to lend back-up credibility to the case. Investigation continues. PROLOGUE: THE BURDEN OF PROOF Proof! The burden of this one word, and perhaps its ambiguity, has haunted and frustrated UFO research since businessman-pilot, Ken Arnold, sighted nine saucer-like things over Mt. Rainier in 1947. Proof! Its implications burden all of us who try to convince the skeptic that unidentified objects, flying under apparent intelligent control, have intruded into Earth's air space and sometimes allegedly land and, on rare occasions, crash. All factors considered, I believe we, in the domain of public research, do not have that exalted proof to exhibit for any of the foregoing anomalous UFO events. As Dr. J. Allen Hynek of CUFOS would say, we do have 'reports' describing such events. And as we all will agree, many are made by credible people. Yes, our research treasury has thousands of reports of UFO encounters of all kinds providing stacks of "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"circumstantial, but highly suggestive evidence. Alas, these are not proof. Nor do affidavits, nor 'leaked' government documents, nor photographs constitute proof. Regrettably, experience has taught us that any of these so-called proofs might well be fakes. Even a released document through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIAS) is not proof, for the subject it treats too often contains precious little of value, due to censored deletions, vague phraseology, or references rendered meaningless without additional support data which are never made available. So, what is that proof that remains so elusive from public view? According to scientific discipline, proof - in the case of UFOs - -can be reduced simply to the possession of a captive craft or artifact or a cadaver that can be seen, touched, and smelled. To please Phil Klass, the world's foremost debunker, we might include even 'tasted.' I must, therefore, face the inevitable questions in my special research: Has such a nondescript craft been retrieved and studied and, to stretch a point, duplicated at some secret base? And has a crew member of exotic anatomy been secretly examined and maintained in chemical preservation at some medical facility? In spite of all the known evidence, including the testimony I have published in my series of monographs, I can offer no proof, by my definition, of the recovery of an alien craft or its occupants. So be it for me in the public sector. Then there is the 'official' sector whose military spokespeople from the outset have denied the existence of the UFO. Why? By now, it should be obvious to every researcher that behind the denials, something 'above top secret,' as Senator Barry Goldwater has said, is being hidden. Perhaps it is something big enough to shake up our societal patterns. Whatever we might think of its implications for mankind, we do know that much information has been bared since World War II by credible military sources about UFO intercept missions, aircraft losses, visual sightings confirmed by radar and, yes, UFO landings on military installations and a crash - among several - one dating back to 1947. On the other hand, if all UFOs have simple explanations as the U.S. Air Force contends (and as a Wright-Patterson AFB spokesman once commented: 'We are hiding nothing.') - then why enforce such high degree of secrecy to hide nothing? Logically, we might ask: What is it that must be hidden at all costs? Is it alien hardware? Alien cadavers? If so, why not tell the world? Why the long, agonizing secrecy? Here again, we can only guess, but a likely one is that to face the media of the world, they had better have answers for the UFOs' origin and intent. Without answers after so many years, the credibility gap of our Government and its scientific advisers would greatly suffer. Without answers, the experts in the military, the CIA, the NSA, NRO and NASA, who help form policy, will continue their secret probes in silence. It seems fair to say that we all have our proof problems. I would like to be assured that governments worldwide, including Russia, and especially our own National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) are working on these problems. In good faith, I address these problems with new evidence for Case A3, published in Status Report III, UFO Crash Retrievals: Amassing The Evidence (1982) . THE EVIDENCE AND ITS BURDEN OF PROOF September 23, 1980, was to become more than just a typically busy day for me in UFO matters. According to my UFOLOG, I note that I had communications by phone and mail with Joe Brill, Michael Dougan, Bob Gribble, Diane Saghe, and a journalist in Japan. There was also an envelope with an APO San Francisco return address. Of interest, of course, was Gribble's call concerning a new source, a trucker who reported that he had transported something secret for the military from Aztec, New Mexico, in the late 1940s, and a response to a letter I had sent to Saghe seeking information from a source she knew who had seen a captured saucer at a Texas airbase. But, standing out above all else, was the letter, APO San Francisco, dated September 16, 1980. It was typed in proper military format on stationery with official letterhead. See Figure 1 below. Note that I have deleted the Security Police Squadron number. The name of the sender has been changed to 'Jeffrey Morse' in this Status IV report. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Figure 1: U. S. Department of the Air Force Security Policeman's letter to Len Stringfield, dated September 16, 1980, San Francisco APO postmark. McGuire AFB and Fort Dix Military Reservation near Wrightstown, New Jersey, are near the U. S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The bases are about 45 miles east of Philadelphia, 50 miles south of New York City, 60 miles north of Atlantic City and 10 miles west of the Atlantic ocean. The Fort Dix / McGuire Air Force Base / Lakehurst Naval Air Station complex covers 42,000 acres. Needless to say, I was stunned by the sergeant's bold disclosure of a military incident of fatal consequences at McGuire AFB, New Jersey. My first reaction was that it was a hoax, perhaps designed - if it were published - to embarrass or discredit my probes into UFO crash/retrievals. Still fresh in mind was another episode in 1980 involving questionable photographs received from a source under clandestine arrangements requiring my travel to another state. In this case, although my initial role was to have the photographs studied and authenticated, I made the mistake of announcing their acquisition at the 1980 MUFON symposium in Houston. Thanks to a swift and well-orchestrated smear campaign, researchers by and large became confused and questioned both the photographs and my credibility. A hoax? A stratagem to set me up? Probably, but a lesson was learned. ( Note 1: See Status Report III , 1982, pages 40-41; also articles published in MUFON UFO Journal, Dec. 1980 and Sept. 1981.) During this fragile period, being suspicious of any stranger with information to offer, I read Morse's letter over and over, and in between the lines, looking for anything detectably wrong. But I could find nothing wrong. The letterhead was real, the military format was correct, the writer told his story as fact without emotional embellishment. Maybe, I reasoned, it was the sobriety of the official letterhead that made the story itself seem out of place with the real world. Like so many other stories of UFO close encounters, it sounded like borderline fantasy. Other cases also involved the military, such as the British Rendlesham Forest Case. ( Note 2: Also known as the Bentwaters Case, site of U. S. air base in the Rendlesham Forest. See Sky Crash by British authors Brenda Butler, Dot Street and Jenny Randles © 1984,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"published by Neville Spearman, U. K. I must, however, note that these authors are in error on page 213 where they state: 'Stringfield was too scared to travel to the conference [at Univ. of Nebraska, Nov. 1983, where my paper UFO C/R Update was read by Ray Boeche.] He (Stringfield) believed he was in danger following his research.' Not true. There was no basis whatsoever for being scared. My reason simply was that I had no important information in my brief report that warranted my presence or the expense of travel.) Time will tell, I assured myself. Soon, Sgt. Morse would return home and if he had something of substance to back his claims, it would be the big breakthrough. I was determined to see this one case through, disregarding time, energy and cost. Proving it, however, would be a monumental burden. To better understand the incident and its ramifications, some of which later followed my source into civilian life, I believe it is essential to report verbatim most of my early exchanges of communications with him (USAF Security Policeman). This covers a span of time from Morse's initial letter in 1980 into a period of apparent mail interference and then through his long interval of silence into his re-emergence in 1983. As advised in Morse's overseas letter, my reply of September 27, 1980, was mailed to his home address. In the main, it was a message to establish a rapport of trust between us, one in which he could feel comfortable in sharing the burden of his experience and to allay any anxieties he might have had about my research background. My questions were few and simple. One, for instance, asked for more descriptive detail of the recovered body. Another asked how the body was removed from the scene and by whom. Still another, if he could reveal any names of the personnel assigned to the area. I ended my letter with this thought: 'Hope to hear from you soon and will follow your mailing instructions. Your letter will remain confidential at this time and, of course, your name will not be used in anyway.' Sgt. Morse, who was to be discharged and back home in November 1980, did not acknowledge my letter. Considering the time lapse as critical, I sent another letter on November 18, 1980, quoted in part here: Stringfield letter excerpts dated November 18, 1980: '...Hope by now you're out of the service as you indicated in your letter from APO address. ...On September 27, I sent you a letter concerning my research endeavors which I trust you received at your home address. The incident you describe is, indeed, of interest to me and I hope you may find time soon to reach me by letter or phone, or, perhaps, to meet me at your convenience. You are certainly welcome to visit my home. ...I tried reaching you by phone last week, but your number is unlisted. ...' Morse's reply to Stringfield dated November 27, 1980: 'Sorry to have had such a delay in my response to you. I'm sorry to say I did not receive your letter of 27 September 1980. I haven't received any mail since August 1980. I don't know why. I am now out of the service and am home. I am prepared to answer your questions. I believe, however, I told you everything I know, but I'm not sure it was much to go on. But, I hope it leads you to someone who knows more about it. I'm sorry I can't recall too many names. The desk sergeant that night was Sgt. C (last name only) and he would know much more as fact. That's all I know of his name, however, I do remember that he was rather dedicated and may still be in the USAF. Well, I would like your next response ASAP and will try to give you my phone number by then.' Stringfield memorandum to Morse dated December 4, 1980: 'Your letter of November 27, arrived yesterday. I was surprised to learn that my letter of September 27 did not reach you. Fortunately, I kept a xeroxed copy which I have duplicated and enclosed for your consideration. Hope you can send me your phone number. Enclosed is a gratis copy of my recently published Status Report II, [to be reprinted in future Earthfiles] which shows the scope of my research.' Again for unknown reasons, Morse did not answer. Considering his expressed interest in my research and even allowing for other personal diversions, I thought that 2 1/2 months were enough time for him to respond. On February 16, 1981, I wrote again, expressing my concern and asked for a prompt reply as evidence of his sincerity. No answer. Had it not been for Morse's brief letter of November 27, in which he asked for me to respond 'ASAP,' I would have dismissed his disclosure of the incident as questionable. But something was amiss. Or was the mail sent to his home being lost"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"through negligence? Or lifted t his post office by directive to the Postmaster from one of the intelligence agencies? Whatever the method used to silence Jeffrey Morse, I reasoned, it was effective. All communications ceased. Like so many other informants in 1980, Morse became a phantom.\" Continued in Part 2 - Morse Makes Another Contact Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
