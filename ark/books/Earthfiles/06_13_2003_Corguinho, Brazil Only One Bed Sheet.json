Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Corguinho, Brazil: Only One Bed Sheet © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe Frame from videotape running at 8:00:38 p.m. on September 15, 2002, at the discovery of the body pattern in the bed sheet, pillow case and on the wood ceiling of the Urandir and Jessica Oliveira bedroom, Corguinho, Brazil. Videotape by Fabricio Da Silva. June 13, 2003 Corguinho, Brazil - On September 15, 2002, at around 7:30 p.m., Brazil businessman Felipe Branco was driving his truck into the Urandir Oliveira farm when he was stopped by rocks falling on his truck. Felipe could see small, round stones bouncing off the hood into the beams from his head lights. Felipe had driven from his Campo Grande fazenda (cattle farm) because his friend, Urandir Oliveira, had told him he expected to be taken by blond- haired extraterrestrials into a spacecraft before 9 p.m. on September 15th. A signal of that event, Urandir had said, would be a \"rain of rocks\" on the farm. At the same time that Felipe Branco stopped his truck, stunned by the sound and sight of the stones falling on his truck, another friend of the Oliveira family was reading in his rented bed and breakfast room about a quarter of a mile from the Oliveira home. \"It sounded like hail on the tin roof,\" Fabricio Da Silva told me in Corguinho in February. Fabricio grabbed his digital video camera and ran outside with the camera running. Urandir Oliveira's teenage son, cousins and half a dozen other visitors were outside, too, some pointing at the sky while a few rocks continued to fall with a knocking sound on the metal roofs. Fabricio kept running his camera as people picked up small, round stones from the ground. Eventually, Felipe Branco joined them and everyone headed for the Oliveira home. There, they found in the bedroom the pattern of a body with its right arm outstretched, seemingly melted into the bed sheet and pillowcase on the bed and another similar body pattern darkly scorched into the wood ceiling.

Both Felipe and Fabricio began videotaping the startling scene around 8 p.m., while others took still photographs.

The videotape clearly shows the pale blue cotton and white polyester bed sheet has a woven pattern of repeating white squares."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" On Friday, June 6, 2003, after filing reports at Earthfiles about what scientists have learned so far about the bed sheet, pillowcase and small stones that fell from the sky, there was another round of attacks from A. J. Gevaerd in Brazil and Charlette LeFevre in Seattle with a laundry list of allegations. I called Brazilian businessman, Felipe Branco, this week for his comments on the allegations, and specifically in this report the false accusation that there was more than one bed sheet containing a body pattern. Interview: Felipe Branco, Owner, Fazenda Castelo, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil: \"ONE OF THE ALLEGATIONS IS THAT URANDIR OLIVEIRA HAD TWO OR THREE BED SHEETS AND GEVAERD IS SHOWING THE PHOTOGRAPHS ON A WEBSITE SAYING, 'LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE IN COLOR.' CHARLETTE LE FEVRE AND GEVAERD ARE ALSO SAYING THAT URANDIR OLIVEIRA BEAT UP HIS FIRST WIFE. THEY ARE SAYING THAT HE IS A CROOK, THAT HE IS GUILTY OF LAND FRAUD, THAT HE WAS PUT IN JAIL, THERE IS THE PHOTOGRAPH OF URANDIR BEHIND BARS, THAT IT'S BEEN A CULT, LIKE A JIM JONES CULT.... (Felipe begins laughing.) \"This is ridiculous, this! This is ridiculous. My God! Beating up the ex-wife. I know her personally. I've known her for the past seven years. They are divorced, but they are still very good friends, she is a friend of Urandir's. She is (also my) very close friend. I have been to her house several times, even after the separation. She is a lovely person. When I spoke to her about this, she was so upset! She said, 'My God, this A. J. Gevaerd, he never stops persecuting Urandir. It's incredible! I want to testify. I want to clear this up because this is a lie, a total lie, you know!' She was amazed. SO URANDIR OLIVEIRA, FROM HIS EX-WIFE TALKING TO YOU, NEVER BEAT HER UP? Never! This is a lie. ALL RIGHT. TAKING SOME OF THE OTHER ACCUSATIONS, THAT HE MADE TWO OR THREE BED SHEETS. It's a lie also because first of all, Gevaerd, he has never been there to his room"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"(Urandir's bedroom.) He has never seen it personally. He has never taken a sample, nothing! The only researcher who has gone inside to look was you. Nobody else. WHERE DID HE (Gevaerd) GET THE PHOTOS OF URANDIR SITTING ON THE BED MAKING IT LOOK LIKE IT'S A DIFFERENT COLORED BED SHEET IN ONE PHOTO VERSUS THE WOVEN BED SHEET? This is easily done using PhotoShop or any digital manipulation, easily done. These photos went around the world because many people took photos there, may 8, 7, 10 people who took photos there. DO YOU REMEMBER TAKING PICTURES OF URANDIR SITTING ON THE BED ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2002 AFTER HE GOT BACK? DID SOMEBODY DO THAT? Oh, yes.\" Linda Howe's Digital Video Frames from February 9, 2003, Show Bed Sheet Pattern Wash ed Out by Daylight Coming Through Western Window. The pattern of white polyester threads cross woven with pale blue cotton threads in the bed sheet is subtle and glare of a camera flash or daylight coming through the window on the west side of the bedroom washes out that pattern. An example below are frames from my own digital video camera taken on February 9, 2003, when I was in the Oliveira home to collect samples from the bed sheet, pillowcase and ceiling. Digital video frames above and below of bed sheet in Urandir and Jessica Oliveira bedroom, Corguinho, Brazil, taken on February 9, 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe. The daylight from the western window washes out the woven pattern in the bed sheet. In an upcoming Earthfiles.com and Dreamland Online telephone conversation with Urandir Oliveira, his lawyer, his ex-wife and Felipe Branco, Whitley Strieber and I will ask about all of the Gevaerd/LeFevre allegations.
