Photo © 1982 by rancher Linda Dzuris. R eturn to Part 1 November 5 , 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - The following continues from Parts 1- 7 about the 1980 animal mutilation high strangeness summary I typed up for my private research files and am now sharing for the first time in this Real X-Files series. This segment continues on September 22, 1980, after the high strangeness at Iona Hoeppner's Briggsdale, Colorado, high school lab. G rover, Colorado, near Pawnee National Grassland is northeast of Greeley and Fort Collins. September 29, 1980 - Phil McKinley ranch south of Grover, Colorado. On September 29, 1980, Phil McKinley found a 4-year-old cow dead and mutilated 100 feet from Crow Creek in deep grass. The last time he saw the cow healthy and alive was on Friday, September 26, and he estimated she had been dead two days when he found her. a) Right ear taken clear to skull. Cow had a thick, hard rubber, marker tag that pierced the ear. McKinley found half of the tag was about 2 to 3 feet in front of the dead cow. The other ear tag half was never found. Why both to cut tag in half if taking whole ear? \"I thought maybe coyotes had done it, but no teeth marks in the rubber,\" Phil McKinley told me. Sheriff Andrews in Weld County has the tag half now. b) Hide on right side of nose and up over nostrils was excised along with upper and lower jaw so that cow's mouth was outlined "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"by hide stripped clean, leaving all muscle tissue underneath in tact. Phil McKinley told me, \"That's what is really peculiar, no flesh was taken. If coyotes get to a dead animal, they will go for the soft parts first like the nose and rectum and eat to the bone. But no flesh at all was taken from this cow.\" c) Tongue taken, cut from deep in throat. d) Udder removed - looked circular and smooth as if cut with very sharp instrument. \"Removed whole thing and hole went clear into belly. You could see the intestines. I wonder if that's because some varmints got to the mutilator's cut?\" e) No bloat; some swelling. f) Rectum cored out - one side showed signs of coyote chewing, but the other side was smooth, no bite marks. Hole was 4 inches across and 6 to 8 inches deep into cow's abdomen. \"Just looked like a big, deep hole,\" said McKinley. g) Right eye gone - \"but think bugs did it because there wasn't any evidence of eye being cut out.\" h) \"We had just vaccinated, cleaned and worked over our cows pretty good one week before and none of them were sick. So, those cows had been in that pasture only one week when I found her. As far as I know, she was a healthy cow and I don't have any idea why she died.\" i) \"There were no signs of struggle where she was in the grass - no disturbance at all. No signs of thrashing. She was dead or unconscious when she hit the ground.\" j) Little patch of skin behind her right front arm pit about 3 inches long and 1 inch wide was missing. Looked sort of like a skinned up place where black skin was kind of rectangular. k) Tassel on tail was gone, leaving clean tail stump. \"Looked like it might have been chewed on, but coyotes don't eat hair and if they had chewed on the tail, that hair would still have been there. But it was not. I've never seen coyotes take a tail or an ear before.\" Other McKinley comments: \"Coyote damage is pretty rough looking - they go clear down to bone. Her nose really puzzled me. That hide on the nose is thin and it was so carefully taken that her nostril holes were untouched. Everything was there but the hide skin.\" Saturday night, September 27, 1980, a neighbor heard a noise at 10:30 PM like a helicopter. The neighbor went out to see, but could not see anything. Back in the summer of 1975 or 1976, Phil McKinley remembers watching a light circle in the sky and shining a beam onto the ground about 3 miles north of his place. Then pretty soon, there was a second light that circles, shining a beam on to the ground. Then a third light circled, shining a beam on the ground while all three lights kept circling. He never heard any sound, but 3 miles is pretty far to hear noise. He thought the lights were near Kiowa (see map below) and drove on roads to get closer. But when he got where he thought the lights were, they disappeared. Phil drove on to Kiowa and then saw a light east of town. Later, Phil learned that in Buckingham north of Kiowa, people called authorities about seeing lights in the sky there that night, too. At midnight a week later after he saw the three circling lights, Phil heard something that sounded \"just like it was coming right through the house.\" The dogs went crazy, but when he got outside he could not see anything, even though the noise was still there. Phil said it sounded like a low-flying helicopter had gone right over the roof of his house at a terrific speed. He told me he is used to low-flying pesticide spraying planes around his area that don't set his dogs barking. But that night, his dogs went crazy barking even though he could not see any lights - only heard the loud helicopter sound. McKinley asked, \"Why wouldn't coyotes have touched that cow's nose if they went into the cow's belly?\" Phil speculated that something didn't smell right about the nose because coyotes, dogs and other animals will stay away from anything that does not smell right to them. Phil said he asked the sheriff what would happen if he or one of his deputies caught one of those helicopters down in a field and shot at it to keep it from"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"flying away? Sheriff Andrews said he did not know because it had never happened. Sheriff Andrews also told McKinley that the only crime they could book anyone on was malicious mischief and trespass because no one was rustling the animals. they were just leaving cut up dead bodies. So, some law enforcement doesn't take the whole matter very seriously. \"I don't think law enforcement is going to spend any money on these mutilations because it's not a big crime,\" Phil McKinley said. Phil McKinley mentioned another strange thing that happened back in 1975-1976: a local farmer was out riding when he saw a helicopter flying real low along Crow Creek making loud noise and said it \"scared the hell out of him.\" Rancher said he heard it before he saw it. McKinley also recounted something Sheriff Andrews told him: a man south of Briggsdale, Colorado, looked out of his window late one night and saw what he thought was a helicopter down in his pasture. He called the sheriff and told him it was still there and to get out there as fast as possible, which the sheriff did. The sheriff drove into the pasture fast, never stopping, with his high beams on. He drove all over the pasture and never found anything. Phil said, \"Maybe they aren't helicopters after all because I've heard the chopper sound right above me when I couldn't see anything!\" In 1975 to 1976, August and September were the peak periods for animal mutilations in northeastern Colorado and that pattern is repeating in 1980. Another Grover, Colorado, case - ranch of Vic Hilman 12 miles east of Grover: He had a bull mutilated back in 1975 - 1976. Tongue, eye, penis, testicles, rectum \"all cleanly cut out.\" Hilman said, \"No animal can do that. The cuts were smooth, very precise and perfect. A coyote's just like a dog - they tear things apart.\" Since then, he has not had any more mutilations that he knows about. \"It's very weird. It makes you stop and wonder what is going on because I know it is not predators!\" Vic Hilman told me. Tuesday, September 30, 1980 - Charlotte and Bob Smithburg and their children were driving along I-70 around 7 to 7:30 PM toward their home in Arriba, Colorado, when they saw something very bright in the sky. At first it was a bright yellow color and the family talked about what it could be. Then they watched it come down out of the sky, maybe two miles from where they were in the car. As it moved downward, the light changed to a green, then a red and then it disappeared. The parents estimated they all watched for two or three minutes, \"but we did not see it hit the ground.\" Could not hear any sound. That same night of September 30, 1980, near Lindon, Colorado, 3 miles southwest of the Phillip Scott ranch, a neighbor heard dogs howling at night, which was not normal. K iowa, Arriba and Lindon, Colorado, east of Denver, have had animal mutilations reported since at least the early 1970s. October 1980 October 1, Phillip Scott ranch, Lindon, Colorado - The next day on Wednesday, October 1, Scott found one of his black Angus cows dead and mutilated. The animal was 9-years-old and had given birth to a calf probably the day before. The cow was in the bottom of a sand creek in a very narrow place. No water. She was on her right side. The entire udder had been removed in a smooth oval shape about 2 x 2.5 feet of excised hide. The excision went toward the cow's chest and up toward her left"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"leg and up to a point on the flank. \"There was definitely a knife cut around the rectum,\" Phillip Scott told me. \"It was a 4 x 6 inch diamond-shaped cut.\" When Phillip Scott found his cow, she was bloated and the intestines had out-pouched a bit, so he's not sure what happened to the afterbirth. \"I don't know - was it still there or what?\" No blood anywhere on the cow or around her on the ground. No tracks. Tail, tongue and eyes were intact. A local veterinarian was supposed to visit to check the cow over, but he never showed up. Scott said in June 1977, three years before, another of his black cows was mutilated. But she was a sick and old animal in a different pasture. In that case, he found what he described were \"helicopter pad tracks 1.5 inches across in loose dirt and a cactus was knocked flat to the ground.\" Also, the grass near the mutilated cow was swirled flat in a big circle. Deputy Sheriff Bob Jones of Washington County in Akron, Colorado, took some polaroid photographs of Scott's cow, but Scott did not have any photographs himself. Also October 1 - Orvil Harms in Pine Bluffs, Wyoming. On his buffalo grass pasture on a high ridge, right in the middle of the pasture 18 miles straight south of Bushnell, Nebraska, or 15 miles east and 1 miles south of Hereford, Colorado - Orvil Harms found a 5-month-old steer calf, 450 pounds, dead and mutilated. Orvil was working in his pasture on Monday, September 29, 1980, at noon time where he later found the male calf two days later on October 1st. The calf was not in that pasture location on October 1, so Orvil figured the mutilation happened Monday night, September 29. a) Where sex organ had been, there was a 24-inch-long and 3-inch-wide oval of excised hide. \"It was definitely cut with a knife because it was sort of jagged like they had stopped and started over at places trying to cut.\" The skin in the oval was pinkish-white. b) Rectum was cored out 6 to 8 inches deep, a dark hole, and could not see any organs inside. Definitely no out-pouching of intestines. c) Animal was bloated with feet sticking up in air, lying on left side. d) Both ears cut off \"like they'd done it with a scalpel.\" e) No blood visible anywhere. f) Eyes were there and no skin missing from around them. g) Nose - 6 inches up the nose, hide only was missing in an oval shape 6 inches by 6 inches up between eyes. h) Tongue was in place and was not protruding even though animal bloated. i) Tail was there. j) Sheriff Andrews investigated and took flesh samples from the rectum. A Lt. Deputy and another officer with Andrews dismissed the animal as a predator attack, but Sheriff Andrews thought it was a genuine mutilation. k) No sign of death struggle. Buffalo gras untouched and could not see any tracks around the steer. l) There were signs that coyotes had been there. Scott saw where the natural predators had pulled chunks of hide and dropped them on the ground. He thinks the coyotes \"were suspicious of something\" - maybe the scent of whoever did the mutilation. \"The coyotes tried to eat on that steer, but they didn't want to get too close. We've got a lot of coyotes out here and they are starving all the time.\" m) \"There was a liquid on the ground.\" I figured it was coming out of the steer's stomach from the bloat. [ But see Roland Ball and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Iona Hoeppner case of September 16, 1980.] n) No bird droppings anywhere. Orvil told about how he had another cow mutilated in 1975-1976. He said it was different than the steer in that the cuts were oval and \"real smooth,\" not as jagged as this current oval. In the cow mutilation, the jaw was stripped, tongue gone, bag gone and rectum cored out. When I asked Orvil if anyone had seen or heard anything unusual on Monday night, September 29, he said no. Then he continued that there were lots of helicopters flying around over his place at night in 1975 to 1976. \"You could hear them and see the flashing lights on and off.\" DO YOU SEE HELICOPTERS NOW? \"No, but the mutilations are still going on.\" IMPORTANT CONTRAST: Orvil told me that the day before finding his steer on October 1, 1980, an antelope had been killed along side the road near his place. The next day on October 1, only twelve hours later (overnight), the coyotes had \"eaten everything but bones and a little patch of skin.\" So, the fact that the steer would be in his pasture for 36 hours untouched is quite unusual. Orvil described another incident: Around October 9, 1980, one of Orvil's calves got pneumonia and died. He and a vet cut her open to find out exactly why the calf died. They they left her carcass out in the pasture. One day later, coyotes had not touched the calf \"because of our human smell on it.\" Friday, October 10, 1980 - Rented pasture in Westminster, Colorado, suburb northwest of Denver. A horse owned by Manford Uevelhoer was found dead by a girl walking through the pasture. The girl called the police. Animal Warden Shelly of the Westminster Police Department soon arrived and found the horse completely intact. She thought it appeared as if the horse had run hard before it died because of sweat deposits around the horse's neck. Warden Shelly left to get a camera to take photographs and when she returned 30 minutes later, the left eye and 9-inich-long piece of hide down the horse's muzzle had been ripped out, apparently by a dog. But the rectum was still intact. At 8 AM, Saturday, Karen Priest, another Animal Warden, went out to see the horse because the animal's owner, Mr. Uevelhoer, arrived in the pasture with his saddle to ride the horse and found it in terrible condition. Mr. Uevelhoer was shocked because he had seen the horse alive and well Friday morning and no one from the police department had been able to get hold of him to tell him his horse was dead. When Karen Priest arrived at 8 AM, the horse's rectum was \"definitely cut out in a cylindrical cut about 8 inches wide. You could see the interior organs.\" The left side of the horse's face was completely excised. She wondered if dogs could do that? Magpies were standing around the horse's face and at the back of the horse, but Karen said it was impossible as far as she was concerned for the magpies to have cut the 8-inch hole. Both Karen Priest and Shelly took photos when they visited the horse. The horse had only been in the pasture for one month. She was the newest horse there. No one understands why the horse died - especially not Karen Priest who is baffled by the cleanly cored out rectum. One of Most Haunting Mutilations Was Yet to Happen September 9, 1982, 30 Miles East of Colorado Springs, Colorado"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"T his pregnant, six-year-old cow was alive and well at noon on September 9, 1982, but found by rancher Linda Dzuris to be dead and mutilated at 5 PM, only five hours later.

Similar eyeball enlargements were described by Deputy Sheriff Keith Wolverton, Cascade County Sheriff's Department, Great Falls, Montana. I n September 1982, two years after the first broadcast of my Emmy award-winning documentary, A Strange Harvest, about the animal mutilation phenomenon, I received a call about an unusual cow mutilation south of Denver that haunts me to this day. The ranch owners were Bill and Linda Dzuris, who had been raising cattle on the same land 30 miles east of Colorado Springs for years. On September 9, 1982, what happened to one of their cows was not like anything they had ever seen before."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"A 6-year-old pregnant female was alive and well at noon that blue sky, sunny day in a herd of about thirty other pregnant females that Bill and Linda were keeping close to their ranch house waiting for births. The pasture was less than one-half mile from where the couple were painting their house exterior. Neither of them heard anything unusual the whole afternoon after checking on their pregnant cows at mid-day. Then at 5 o'clock, Bill Dzuris got in his semi-truck to go for a load of hay and saw a black and white cow lying down in the pasture. He assumed she was giving birth and called his wife from a phone down the road and asked Linda to go check on the cow. Linda Dzuris was stunned by what she found. \"Half of the udder was gone. You could see into the stomach cavity. The eyes were bulging out. I was horrified at the thought of what could do this in broad daylight when we had checked the cows only a few hours before!\" The rectum was also cut out in an oval about 18 inches wide. Was the unborn calf removed through that large opening? There was no examination of the cow by a veterinarian. Deputy Kelso from the El Paso County Sheriff's office responded on September 10, 1982, to the Dzuris phone call and filed an offense report. He was puzzled and wrote in his report, \"...cut by some type of instrument.\" Before then in 1980, the Dzurises reported two other mutilations on their ranch that the El Paso Sheriff tried to dismiss as the work of natural predators. But the sheriff's office could not dismiss the September 9, 1982, cow mutilation as predator. Did a UFO hover unseen and silent over the Dzuris ranch that afternoon, send down a pale yellow beam as described by other eyewitnesses over the years, take up the pregnant cow, excise the unborn calf and other tissues, and then let the cow silently back down into the pasture so close to the Dzuris ranch house without detection, even on a sunny day?
