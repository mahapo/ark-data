But you have to live it.” - E be, Los Alamos, New Mexico R eturn to Part 1 April 5, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuing in Part 2 with Linda Moulton Howe's 1983 to 1987 High Strangeness Files about EBENs. F rom Linda Moulton Howe's High Strangeness EBEN files, 1983 - 1987. EBEN CLOTHES: They don't wear any.They have a thick hide of two layers, which changes color and temperature in varying light intensities. One photo in USAF files shows Ebe (1949 retrieval?) in a human male's dress suit and tie, apparently USAF's effort to make Ebe appear more normal for communication with visiting scientists and government agents. SLEEP: EBENs start sleeping in a sitting position as if in meditation and then lie back to sleep deeply for four to five hours. Allegedly on their home planet orbiting one of the Zeta Reticuli binary suns, their normal day is 30 hours. HOUSING: EBENs live in “pueblos” and in a desert-like atmosphere. There are rivers and plants, but mostly arid. Ebe was afraid of Earth's oceans. FOOD: EBENs eat mostly vegetables and fruits. Ebe could not digest meat or most fats, which made Ebe sick. But the USAF officer who stayed with Ebe, mostly at Kirtland AFB and in Los Alamos National Lab, said Ebe's favorite Earth food was strawberry ice cream. Is that deliberately planted and seemingly ridiculous misinformation to track how information spreads through what people from official leaks - either misleading info or real? Ebe also was taken to Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio and Walker AFB in Roswell, New Mexico. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Walker Air Force Base was the largest Strategic Air Command (SAC) base of the United States Air Force at the time of its closure in 1967. It is located three miles (5 km) south of the central business district of Roswell, a city in Chaves County, New Mexico. From 1941 to 1948, the facility was known as Roswell Army Air Field. It is also known for the Roswell UFO incident, an event that supposedly happened on July 4, 1947. It is alleged that a “flying disk” crashed during a severe thunderstorm near Corona, New Mexico, north of Roswell Army Air Field. ] ATMOSPHERE: HOW COULD EBE BREATHE OUR AIR? At first, Ebe would breathe from a tank containing his planet's atmosphere about every hour. After a while, he did not seem to need it. Adaptation to Earth's atmosphere? Allegedly gas composition of Earth atmosphere and EBEN atmosphere not hugely different. Is that possible? ARE THE EBENS OUR FOREBEARS? "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Ebe said, ‘Yes. We made you. We put you here. But you have to live it.’ Project GARNET: “All questions and mysteries about the evolution of Homo sapiens sapiens have been answered and this project is closed.” In alleged briefing paper for an American president shown to me on April 9, 1983, Kirtland Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) by Special Agent Richard C. Doty. According to the USAF officer who stayed with 1949 retrieved Ebe, the EBENs were astonished by all of Earth's different races. The EBENs claim responsib ility for manipulating DNA in already-evolving primates to create standing up hominids on Earth, but the EBENs expected more homogenous Earth humanoids - more like their civilization where everyone looks the same and telepathically think a like. Supposedly, there is no war, no struggle, no money in the EBEN Zeta Reticuli planet - all is programmed and well organized. Ebe communicated difficulty understanding Earth concepts of money and stores. There are several different versions about timelines of EBEN interaction with Earth. Some insiders say the EBENs first came to Earth before the time of the dinosaurs and were in fact responsible for manipulating DNA to create the dinosaurs. That would be at least 270 million years ago. Other versions place EBEN first Earth arrival in time for the manipulation of DNA in Neanderthals to create Homo sapiens sapiens, which would be at least 35,000 years ago. Subsequently, there were allegedly other genetic experiments 15,000 and 5,000 years ago such as manipulating DNA in some people selected in Bhutan that became an E. T.-created group of humans transported in disc craft from the Himalayas to the Yucatan Peninsula, Guatemala and surrounding region. That specific E. T.-created human group were what became the Mayans until their sudden disappearance in 850 A. D. [ Medical fact: Mongolian and Mayan babies at birth sometimes have a blue spot at the base of their spine. ] Then most controversial of all is the EBEN assertion that their genetic manipulation program of Earth life included the creation “of a being 2,000 years ago to be placed on Earth to teach Homo sapiens not to war, but to love each other.” Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. The “immaculate conception” was EBEN control of matter; i.e. fertilization of human egg inside Mary without sperm. If true, it means there is no patriarchal bloodline for Jesus. Mother Mary would be his only human source. The U. S. government agents with need-to-know about EBEN/Other issues are afraid that any public disclosure of Christ being created by extraterrestrials to try to homogenize human thinking and make humans less violent would knock Catholics and Christians into a tail spin. [ Editor's Note: Confusing the issue after the 1983 to 1987 period have been people in the human abduction syndrome who say they have been told the Talls - blond, red and dark-haired - genetically created Christ to cause a time line change for Earth from a catastrophic future to a more peaceful future. So in this hall of mirrors with a quicksand floor that is the UFO phenomenon emerges the peculiar contradiction of two competing? warring? non-human groups both claiming to have genetically produced Christ.] Holloman AFB Incident Date I was given was April 25, 1964. Three EBEN ships arrived in a deserted area of base. All three were white and egg-shaped. One landed while two others hovered above as if to protect the landed craft. At least three humans were in a greeting party, including the same USAF Captain who became a Colonel and who stayed with Ebe between 1949 and June 18, 1952, when the alien died of unknown causes at Los Alamos National Lab. IS THIS WHEN THERE WAS AN EXCHANGE OF THE DEAD ALIEN BODIES FROM THE 1949 AND OTHER UFO CRASHES? Yes. The contact lasted only three hours. Two grey-skinned EBENs stepped out first followed by the taller, beak-nosed non-human with reptilian eyes, ropey headdress and holding the rod communicator in its left hand.

"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"1955 Hill AFB EBEN Craft Linked to 1980 Cash-Landrum UFO Encounter Nine years earlier in 1955 at Hill AFB, Utah, the EBENS allegedly left a “gift” of an alien craft in perfect condition and all systems on and operating. Military and scientific investigators were baffled by “hockey pucks” floating in the air inside the craft as if defying gravity and some how interacting with columns of light generated by “computer” control panels. The panel instruments have symbols most similar to Tibetan script. The panel instruments are activated by touch. To \"steer\" the craft, you place a hand over a column of light and turn your hand which ever way you want to go. Light is the key to their technology and every different color of light means something significant. S ample Tibetan text. Source Wikipedia. According to sources, how the craft operated was a mystery for at least two decades of intense human study. Allegedly hydrogen ramjet fuel processed through crystals. A standard ice hockey puck is black vulcanized rubber, 1 inch (25 mm) thick, 3 in (76 mm) in diameter, and weighs between 5.5 and 6 ounces (156–170 g). Source Wikipedia. On December 29, 1981, outside Houston, Texas, the U. S. government was testing the Hill AFB, Utah, craft in which the complex and incomprehensible crystal system was bypassed with a nuclear powered system constructed by human engineers. Allegedly, that night was the third test to see if humans could fly and control the extraterrestrial craft modified with nuclear powered engines when something went wrong and the nuclear device was leaking radiation. According to sources, that is the diamond-shaped craft coming down near the highway in front of the car containing Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum and Colby Landrum, Vickie's 7-year-old grandson on their way home to Dayton, Texas. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “At about 9.00 p.m., while driving on an isolated two-lane road in dense woods, the witnesses said they observed a light above some trees. They initially thought the light was an airplane approaching Houston Intercontinental Airport (about 35 miles away) and gave it little notice. A few minutes later on the winding roads, the witnesses saw what they took to be the same light as before, but it was now much closer and very bright. The light, they would claim, came from a huge diamond-shaped object, which hovered at about treetop level. The object's base was expelling flame and emitting significant heat. Vickie Landrum told Cash to stop the car, fearing they would be burned if they approached any closer. However, Vickie's opinion of the object quickly changed: a born again Christian, she interpreted the object as a sign of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, telling her grandson, ‘That's Jesus. He will not hurt us.’ Anxious, Cash considered turning the car around, but abandoned this idea because the road was too narrow and she presumed the car would get stuck on the dirt shoulders, which were soft from that evening's rains. Cash and Landrum got out of the car to examine the object. Colby was terrified, however, and Vickie Landrum quickly returned to the car to comfort the frantic child. Cash remained outside the car, ‘mesmerized by the bizarre sight.’"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The UFO Encyclopedia: The Phenomenon from the Beginning, Vo l u m e 1 : A-K (second edition) © 1998 by Jerome Clark: ‘The object, intensely bright and a dull metallic silver, was shaped like a huge upright diamond, about the size of the Dayton water tower, with its top and bottom cut off so that they were flat rather than pointed. Small blue lights ringed the center, and periodically over the next few minutes flames shot out of the bottom, flaring outward, creating the effect of a large cone. Every time the fire dissipated, the UFO floated a few feet downwards toward the road. But when the flames blasted out again, the object rose about the same distance.’ I llustration of diamond-shaped craft emitting flames from bottom as it descended towards road in front of Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum and Colby Landrum, Vickie's 7-year-old grandson, on their way home to Dayton, Texas, at 9 PM Central, December 29, 1980. Wikipedia: “The witnesses said the heat was strong enough to make the car's metal body painful to the touch. Cash said she had to use her coat to protect her hand from being burnt when she finally re-entered the car. When she touched the car's dashboard, Vickie Landrum's hand pressed into the softened vinyl, leaving an imprint that was evident weeks later. Investigators cited this hand print as proof of the witnesses' account; however, no photograph of the alleged hand print exists. The object then moved to a point higher in the sky. As it ascended over the treetops, the witnesses claimed that a group of helicopters approached the object and surrounded it in tight formation. Cash and Landrum counted 23 helicopters, and later identified some of them as tandem-rotor CH-47 Chinooks used by military forces worldwide. Despite their claims that they knew nothing of the UFO, the U.S. military tried to buy Betty Cash's car on a number of occasions. The roof of the car was damaged by the heat from the UFO. About 3 weeks after the incident a number of men in unmarked trucks arrived at the scene of the UFO sighting and repaired the heat damage of the road. Several weeks later they returned and removed 6 inches of the surface material before repairing the road again. In the hours that followed their UFO experience the trio developed painful swellings and blisters on their skin. They also suffered severe headaches and upset stomachs and Colby developed a sunburn-like rash. Vickie’s hair began to fall out and Betty had to be admitted to hospital as her eyes became so swollen that she could not see. Over the weeks that followed their UFO experience all three of them lost some hair and developed eye problems. When their hair grew back it was different from their original hair. Vickie Landrum was convinced that they had come into close contact with a secret military craft which was responsible for their injuries and medical experts confirmed that the symptoms that the three unfortunate victims suffered were consistent to intense electromagnetic radiation in the ultra- violet, microwave and X-ray bands. Both Vickie and Betty Cash sued the U.S. Government for $20 million but in 1986 the case was dismissed on the grounds that ‘no such object was owned, operated or in the inventory of the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force or NASA.’ ”]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Since the diamond-shaped aircraft's test flight gone awry in Texas, sources say the same craft was flown to Nevada where it has continued to be secretly tested at Nellis AFB.
