Here begins Part 7 of Status Report VII, from February 1994. FBI Confiscates Newspapers and Magazines About UFOs According to several sources, there were instances when news of a UFO crash broke through the censors and reached the newsroom of a TV or radio station or a newspaper['s city desk. With firsthand facts and photos, the big story was released and then, presto! squashed. In one case in 1952, a New York daily newspaper headlined a crash story in its \"bulldog\" or 9 PM edition. Copies were delivered as usual to newsstands, the first loads going to a neighborhood in the Bronx. Official reaction was swift. Agents, thought to be the FBI, took the remaining copies at the newsstands and made a door-to-door sweep in all the nearby apartments to round-up any of the bulldog strays. \"Most of the copy about the crash, I've forgotten,\" lamented Robert. \"I do remember that three bodies were recovered: two were dead, one injured, still alive. The crash site, too, is not clear. I believe it occurred in New Mexico or Arizona because the terrain was sandy like a desert.\" Also, the name of the newspaper is disputed. Joe thought it was The Daily News . Robert thought it was The Daily Mirror . \"Both formats were similar,\" said Robert. But most of the key questions might never be answered. Probably all the copies of the bulldog edition were confiscated, either on arrival at the newsstands or earlier at the newspaper offices and distribution center. I also wonder if the source of the story was UPI or AP news wire services and if so, what happened at the various other media nationally? Or, was it an independent scoop? Whatever the case, it was a matter of national security to squash a UFO crash/retrieval incident. Other early examples of a submissive media to UFO censorship were published in my Status Report III, UFO Crash/Retrievals: Amassing the Evidence. One, occurring the same year, 1952, as in the Oliveri case, was reported by Richard Hall, then editor of the MUFON UFO Journal at the Fifth Annual Mufon Conference in 1981. Said Hall, \"I personally heard a radio news report about a crashed saucer and occupants - one said to be still alive - about 1952, while I was working in a general store. Being young and naive in those days, I made little effort to document the story beyond listening for additional news on following newscasts, which of course, never came. I should have called the radio station, talked with the wire service persons, checked newspapers in a library and so on. Since I didn't, the story remains only an interesting anecdote.\" In 1980, George Fawcett, veteran researcher in Lincolnton, North Carolina, gave me the name of Leon Crice to call who distinctly remembers TV Station WDEL-N, Wilmington, Delaware, being cut off the air when showing a newsreel about a crashed UFO. I called Crice in April 1980 and quote part of his story here that was published in Status Report III: \"It was about 1948,\" he said, \"when my wife and I were watching the news on our new TV set that a disc-shaped object was shown stuck, slightly tilted, in a sand dune. It had a "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"dome at the top and no windows,\" adding, \"I recall that the narrator said that it crashed on the Mexican border near the Rio Grande (river).\" As the film rolled, Crice said, it clearly showed soldiers moving around the object and in the background were jeeps, a low-boy rig and crane and some Mexicans watching.\" He also remembers that when the narrator mentioned bodies being recovered and that the craft had been shipped to an air base in California, his voice was cut off and the TV screen went black. There was no station apology and seconds later, the news continued on another subject. Then there remains the unsolved mystery about an issue of a popular magazine in 1948 that published an exclusive story about a crash incident - with photo - and, lo and behold, it vanished. Well, almost vanished, except for a few copies that slipped into the hands of researchers. At first, claimants said they had \"seen\" the ill-fated story in the Coronet. But none was able to furnish a copy. Unfortunately, this story of confiscation was published in Status Report III which evoked a lot of interest. As a result, many dedicated researchers spent considerable time in libraries hoping to find the prodigal issue. Their search was futile. Then from out of the woodwork, other deep-throaters surfaced with a new twist. They contended that the expose was not in Coronet , but in Pageant . Of course, it is possible that Coronet and Pageant did actually publish the taboo UFO crash story and were forced to make a hasty replacement. In that event, all the public and academic libraries would have the corrected issue. But to balance out all the claims that postulate censorship and confiscation, I question the Coronet or Pageant case. Probably the most brazen incident of censorship happened in January 1957 when the voice of NICAP's Donald Keyhoe, appearing live on CBS-TV's Armstrong Circle Theater was cut off the air before a large national audience. Pitted against the Air Force's Spencer Whedon, Chief of the Air Technical Intelligence Command's Information Services, Keyhoe had deviated from the prepared script advocating a Congressional investigation to look into the UFO cover-up. I watched the TV program and the unbelievable sight of Keyhoe's lips moving without sound. For the record, I had interviewed Whedon in August 1957, at his ATIC office in Wright-Patterson AFB. He was a tough, unbending anti-UFO spokesman with a booming voice. My interview was published in Inside Saucer Post 3-0 Blue. In spite of all the negativism, Keyhoe stood his ground, undaunted until his death, maintaining that UFOs were \"interplanetary\" - the word used in the early days - and that the public was being deceived by officialdom's \"silence group.\" The Clovis Crash Conundrum A large \"something\" crashed near Clovis, New Mexico in 1957, a year when UFO activity nationally was moderate to heavy depending on geography. It was also the year of Sputnik and feverish U. S. experiments to catch up with the Russian space exploits. For me, it was the last of a three-year stint of working in cooperation with the Air Defense Command screening and reporting to them through a coded phone system the UFO activity that I received \"live\" from police departments, sheriff's offices, the media and public percipients. In this capacity - and in spite of being advised that any Air Force counteraction once a UFO was confirmed became \"classified\" - I still got \"privileged\" or off-the-cuff information of intercept missions. UFOs were serious business in 1957. Although Clovis is well beyond the rocket and missile test ranges, its general locale cannot be ruled out that it was safe from incidents when an experimental device failed and strayed off its prescribed course. Clovis was not immune to the pervasive UFO either. I remember shortly after I stopped publishing my monthly newsletter, Orbit, in March 1957, that I got a call from a man aware of my publication who claimed that he and his wife had seen a domed disc land at"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"dusk in a rural Clovis schoolyard. Although my notes detailing the case are lost, the schoolyard factor stands out because such incidents were occurring frequently nationwide. Continuing through the years, I expressed my concern for the selective schoolyard target and made reference to this syndrome in my book, Situation Red: The UFO Siege , published twenty years after the Clovis incident. Frankly, based on reports I received in the 1950s, anything with or without a U. S. identification could have landed or crashed anywhere in the busy hub of New Mexico. The 1957 crash incident, based on information that researcher Debbie Valerio of Mansfield, Ohio, got from her source, Jake, was published in Ohio UFO Notebook in July 1993, edited by William Jones, Director of Mid-Ohio Research Associates in Dublin, Ohio. Later, Debbie and a co-researcher, Berta, visited me in Cincinnati to relate additional details and brought me a sample of the retrieved metal taken from the scene of the crash. On August 21, I talked with Jake at length and found his story essentially the same which appeared in the Ohio UFO Notebook. It follows. \"Clovis, New Mexico: Another UFO Crash Site? Recently Mid-Ohio Research Associates (MORA) investigators interviewed a man we shall give the pseudonym, Jake. Jake served in the United States Army/Air Force from 1951 through 1960. At the time of his experience near Clovis, New Mexico, he was a Master Sergeant serving as a crew chief on fighter aircraft. He was on leave, traveling with two Air Force buddies from Kansas into New Mexico. They had no particular destination in mind; they just wanted to get away from work for awhile. The specific time period involved is uncertain, but it was in July or August of either 1957 or 1958. They had heard rumors about a crash of some kind in New Mexico shortly before going on leave, mostly from pilots who had flown over the reported site. There was speculation among these returning pilots that the crash was unusual because no tail section could be seen among the wreckage. When they left on their trip, starting from McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita, Kansas, they did not set out in an attempt to find the site. But as they got into western Texas, they began to hear further rumors about the crash as they talked to people they met along the way. So, they decided to see if they could find out more. The site, as best as Jake can remember, was 30 to 35 miles southwest of Clovis. It was on a ranch. They found the site rather easily, first locating a couple of military vehicles out on the highway and then following them in. They encountered no road blocks. When they arrived at the site, on a dirt road just off a small two lane paved road out in the country, they noticed a number of military vehicles parked near the top of a small rise. Included were a number of jeeps and trucks, a Buick staff car (one of the vehicles they had followed), a C-2 wrecker and two or three 0-10 fire trucks. Since the area was supposedly an aircraft crash site, Jake thought it was strange that no ambulances were there. He stated that ambulances are usually kept near aircraft crash sites, even after bodies are removed, in case they are needed for the treatment of injuries incurred during the investigation and cleanup process. Jake and his friends were spotted soon after they arrived since they were in a civilian car and wore no uniforms. However, just before this occurred, one of his friends noticed a small piece of material on the ground which he picked up. The material was grayish-charcoal in color. It was oddly shaped and slightly bent, but it had not been broken. It was approximately 18 inches long, 10 to 12 inches wide and 5/16 of an inch thick. He remarked that it"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"was the same color all of the way through. It was light in weight, perhaps 3 to 4 ounces. Neither of the three had ever seen any material like it. The friend scraped the material on a rock which created a scratch on the material's surface. An Air Police officer came up and demanded that they put the piece back where they had found it. Jake's friend threw it to the ground. It hit a rock. The sound this made was not metallic, but more of a light thud. The police officer told the friend to pick it back up and place it back where it was originally found. This he did. The officer then demanded to know who they were. When they identified themselves, they were told to leave the area immediately. Several other Air Force personnel had come up to them at this point, one being a 'full bird colonel.' This individual ordered them, 'What you see here, you forget.' They got back in their car and left the area. The Air Police followed them for some distance. The three never did identify what had crashed. There were small pieces of wreckage around the area and ground marks that indicated that something large had impacted in the area, possibly having gone over the small rise in the land. The sparse bushes and trees in the area had been crushed and disturbed and a telephone pole near the road was broken off. Scuttlebutt, picked up both before they arrived on site and later, led them to conclude that the crash had occurred perhaps 3 to 5 days before, but the inspection team had arrived within less than twenty-four hours before their arrival. Neither Jake nor his friends were ever approached later about the event. They never saw the crash referred to in the newspapers. The rumors around their base about the event died out soon thereafter and that is where the story ends. This event cannot be identified as a crashed UFO, but is clear both from what Jake and his friends had observed and heard that a crash of some type of aircraft had occurred and it was apparently being treated somewhat differently from a regular plane crash. Unless more is learned from other sources, this is all that can be said about the incident.\" To be continued in Part 8. Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
