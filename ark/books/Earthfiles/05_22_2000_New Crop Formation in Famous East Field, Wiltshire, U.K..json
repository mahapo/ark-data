May 22, 2000 East Field in Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England - Photographer Peter Sorensen e-mailed me the following report before Lucy Pringle was able to fly over the East Field on May 23, 2000 and take the aerial photograph above: \"I got a pole shot before Noon on Sunday (May 21, 2000) from below Woodborough Hill, the best angle possible from the ground. I tried to figure out the design, walking around the perimeter of the formation which is a bit under 200 feet in diameter. I sketched on a bit of paper as I went. But beyond suspecting a pentacle was part of it, I was befuddled. Then my friend, Nick, borrowed my pen and standing in the center, he sketched for awhile and concluded it was a ring with a 5-pointed star in the middle. But the star i bisected and those bits flattened or standing in the left side half of the design are just the opposite on the corresponding bits in the right hand side. Not only that, but the confusing part is that the lower portion is quartered. That's what threw me off. Possibly, when it's seen from the air, the geometry will consist of a pentacle and an equilateral triangle overlapped and bisected. The formation is now a day old (came down on Saturday, May 20, 2000) and the barley is springing back up. What appears to be lots of 'magically standing stems' are actually stalks which were never totally flattened and are now the first to be standing right straight up again. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I also received a message that a formation in barley has been discovered on the Morested Road in Hampshire. The formation is in barley and is rising up fast. It consists of scalloped edges approximately twelve inches wide that are like eyebrows over seven circles. In the middle is an eternity symbol. It measured approximately 60 meters diameter in total.\" 5-pointed star in circle discovered on May 20, 2000. Pole photograph © 2000 by Peter R. Sorensen.
