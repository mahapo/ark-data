Ministry of Defence Shut Down UFO Office? © 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe “T here are objects in our atmosphere which are technically miles in advance of anything that we can deploy, that we have no means of stopping them coming here, and that we have no defense against them, should they be hostile.” - L ord and Admiral Peter John Hill-Norton, former U. K. Chief of Defense Staff and Chmn., NATO Military Comm., 2000 TV interview before his death in 2004 Click for podcast. December 20, 2009 London, England - The British Ministry of Defence (MoD) has confirmed that on December 1, 2009, it has suddenly and mysteriously shut down its UFO phone hotline and email address for public reports at the time of a UFO flap in the U.K. The MoD originally in November 2009 explained its surprising cutoffs this way: “The MOD has no opinion on the existence or otherwise of extra-terrestrial life. However, in over fifty years, no UFO report has revealed any evidence of a potential threat to the United Kingdom. The MOD has no specific capability for identifying the nature of such sightings. There is no Defence benefit in such investigation and it would be an inappropriate use of defence resources. Furthermore, responding to reported UFO sightings diverts MOD resources from tasks that are relevant to Defence. Accordingly, and in order to make best use of Defence resources, we have decided that from the 1 December 2009 the dedicated UFO hotline answer-phone service and e-mail address will be withdrawn. MOD will no longer respond to r eported UFO sightings or investigate them. The ongoing programme to release Departmental files on UFO matters to the National Archive will continue. Any legitimate threat to the U. K.’s airspace will be spotted by our 24/7 r adar checks and dealt with by RAF fighter aircraft.” [ The MoD said the elimination of the UFO office would save about $73,000 a year that would be better spent on Afghanistan troops where Britain has about 9,500 soldiers.] This is a remarkable statement in light of the U. K.’s former Chief of Defense Staff, Lord Peter John Hill-Norton who was concerned about the national security implications of the December 1980 unidentified lights and craft intrusions at RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge. Lord Hill-Norton told documentary filmmaker James Fox in July 2000: “I have frequently been asked why a person of my background ... thinks there is a cover-up of the facts about UFOs. A number of explanations have often been put forward. The most frequent, and perhaps the most plausible, is the government’s concern over the public’s reaction if told the truth — which is that there are objects in our atmosphere which are technically miles in advance of anything that we can deploy, that we have no means of stopping them coming here, and that we have no defense against them, should they be hostile. I believe governments fear that if they did disclose those facts, people would panic.” "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"L ord Peter John Hill-Norton. February 8, 1915 - May 16, 2004.

[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Lord Peter John Hill-Norton (Feb. 8, 1915 to May 16, 2004) was a five-star Admiral of the Fleet, was Chief of the Defence Staff of the United Kingdom and Chairman of the NATO Military Committee. In later years he took an interest in UFOs, which included inquiries to Parliament about the December 1980 RAF Bentwaters and Rendlesham Forest light, beams and craft encounters.] One former U. K. Ministry of Defence staffer who was hired right out of high school back in 1985 at age 20 is Nick Pope. His father also worked for the MoD and was instrumental in Nick’s recruitment. During his 21 years inside the Ministry of Defence Secretariat Air Staff 2a, Nick was officially assigned in 1991 to 1994 to run the UFO project that included a UFO phone hotline for public sightings reports. He retired from the MoD in 2006 and since has worked as a freelance journalist to write about UFOs, other unexplained mysteries, and conspiracy theories for various newspapers and magazines. Nick has also done public relations work for film companies such as 20th Century Fox and Sony Pictures to promote TV series, including the X-Files program. Recently I talked with him by phone in his London home office and asked him why the MoD would suddenly suspend the very UFO project it has publicized in its ongoing release of UFO files? Interview: N ick Pope, born in 1965, joined the U. K. Ministry of Defence in 1985 at age 20, worked in the Secretariat Air Staff 2a and retired in 2006. From 1991 to 1994, he managed the MoD's UFO Project that was officially closed on December 1, 2009. Image © by WordPress.com. Nick Pope, former Secretariat Air Staff 2a and head of UFO project, Ministry of Defence, London, England: “Speaking as someone who worked for the MoD for 21 years, they are not actually out of the game. This is the big story here, I think. Publicly they say they aren’t investigating these sightings anymore. The MoD is not going to respond to queries from the public about UFOs. They are not going to investigate sightings, but I can absolutely guarantee that if a pilot sees a UFO and reports it, that will be investigated. If an air traffic controller sees something unusual on the radar, that will be reported. WHAT WOULD YOU SPECULATE MIGHT BE THE REASON FOR THE U. K. TO DISENGAGE FROM THE PUBLIC NOW ON UFO REPORTS? I think what’s happened is that the powers that be have decided to cut out the public. It’s time to simply say, ‘Yeah, we’re not in this UFO game. We’re not interested in John Smith out walking his dog at night, seeing a bright light in the sky and phoning it in.’ Actually what the MoD is interested in is pilots seeing these (UFO) things and air traffic"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"controllers seeing something on radar and reporting that up the chain of command. I go back to the point that this is a big story and people think the British government is out of the game. But you know what? They are not! Absolutely behind the scenes, the British government is still looking at this issue. As to the timing, I don’t know. In most issues – whether it’s Iraq, Afghanistan or whatever – you will find that the British government slavishly follows the U. S. position. So maybe the answer is that we have been told to do this. But I don’t know. What Could Be Behind the MoD Dismissal of the UFO Project? WHICH WOULD MAKE IT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT AND IMPLYING PERHAPS SOMETHING BIG IS AROUND THE CORNER AND THE LESS THE PUBLIC KNOWS UP UNTIL SOME POINT, THE BETTER? Yes, I can’t disagree with that. As someone who served for 21 years in government, this sort of behavior is often indicative of some great policy initiative, some revelation, some announcement, something. So, I would urge everyone to watch this space. Just when they try to tell you that this is not an issue – you know, UFOs are not important and we are closing the UFO project, move along because there is nothing to see – just when they tell you to do that, it’s the very time that you should be paying the closest possible attention! The UFO Project never really appeared on the radar of our government financiers, but it did recently. Obviously in terms of our having huge commitments in Afghanistan, it was always going to be a very easy target if we had a UFO project at the same time as you’ve got men and women putting their lives on the line in Afghanistan and people saying, ‘Isn’t this time that you should cut the UFO project?’ That’s what people said and that’s what the MoD did. U.K. UFO Project Shut Down Like America's 1960s Project Blue Book IT IS A REPETITION OF THE 1960S AMERICAN PROJECT BLUE BOOK, WHICH WAS REALLY ONLY WINDOW DRESSING AND OUR GOVERNMENT DIDN’T WALK AWAY FROM UFOS AT ALL, WHICH YOU HAVE SUGGESTED IS EXACTLY THE CASE IN THE U. K. NOW - TO CONCENTRATE ON THE UFO PHENOMENA BEHIND THE SCENES. I don’t have any direct inside information about that. If I did, I probably could not say so anyway. But it’s quite possible, yes. There’s no smoke without fire. When you get these sorts of situations, when you have these sorts of announcements, it does suggest that there is something going on and I don’t know what it is. I honestly don’t, but there is something going on behind the scenes. Britain's Own Military Leader Admiral Hill-Norton Took UFOs Very Seriously IN THE CONTEXT OF MILITARY CHALLENGES AND THE POSSIBLE POLITICAL EMBARRASSMENT OF A UFO DESK IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE AT THE SAME TIME, ISN’T THAT CONTRADICTED BY THE FACT THAT LORD HILL-NORTON – YOUR VERSION OF THE AMERICAN CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF STAFF – THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE 1990S, CORRECT? Yes, correct. THE VERY FACT THAT LORD HILL-NORTON TOOK THE UFO/EXTRATERRESTRIAL PHENOMENA SERIOUSLY IN HIS MILITARY CAPACITY WOULD CONTRADICT ANY EXPLANATION THAT THE MoD WOULD DROP THE UFO DESK BECAUSE IT WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO A MILITARY OPERATION. I agree with you totally. The Ministry of Defence’s public position that the UFO phenomena is of no defence significance is, I think, completely blown out of the water by the testimony of people like Lord Hill-Norton. The MoD has for many years tried to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"downplay this subject out of embarrassment, out of the lack of knowledge and understanding and ‘How the heck do we play this issue?’ Then along comes someone like Lord Hill-Norton – former Chief of the Defence staff; former Chair of NATO’s military committee. So, this is the equivalent of someone like Colin Powell in the U. S. coming out and saying, ‘I believe UFOs are extraterrestrial and I believe that the government is covering up the truth about this.’ That is dynamite – it’s absolute dynamite! And the fact that Lord Hill-Norton said that was a story here in the U. K. and arguably it wasn’t the story it should have been all around the world. YOU WERE WORKING IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE UFO PROJECT AT THAT TIME, CORRECT? That’s correct. Lord Hill-Norton phoned me up and asked me to brief him on this subject. Now, technically speaking, when somebody is a 5-star military officer, they never retire. They are always regarded as being on the active list. So, when Lord Hill-Norton phoned me up and asked me about UFOs, to me this was an order! I was working for the government and at the time I was a comparatively junior managerial rank. Somebody at 5-star level phones me up and asks me to do something, my response is, ‘Yes, sir!’ WHAT IS IT THAT YOU COMMUNICATED TO LORD HILL-NORTON THAT CONVINCED HIM THAT THIS WAS SERIOUS? Well, I’m not sure it was my advice that convinced him. I briefed him on various UFO investigations that I was involved with, but he was a 5-star military officer and Chairman of NATO’s military committee. I mean, I can’t overstate the importance of Lord Hill-Norton’s rank in regard to this UFO issue. WHAT DO YOU THINK CONVINCED LORD HILL-NORTON THAT THE UFO PHENOMENA AND EXTRATERRESTRIALS WERE SERIOUS AND NEEDED TO BE INVESTIGATED? I don’t know. As a former Chief of the Defence staff and Chair of NATO’s military committee, his security clearance was stratospherically higher than mine. So, it might well be that Lord Hill-Norton was privy to things that I simply was not briefed on. You’re taking me into very difficult territory here. There might well be things that he knew that I just was not briefed on. DID YOU EVER HAVE A PRIVATE OFF-THE-RECORD CONVERSATION WITH HIM ABOUT WHAT HE WORRIED ABOUT? Yes, I certainly had a private off-the-record conversation with Lord H ill-Norton and he was absolutely convinced that some UFOs were extraterrestrial. And he was also convinced that some elements within the government and military and intelligence agencies – that even he at his level, 5-star military, Chair of NATO’s military committee, Chief of the Defence staff – could not get access (to classified UFO files). He was convinced that some people knew things and were not sharing them. But even I could not get access to that. Sadly, he passed away a few years ago and those secrets – whatever he knew – he took to the grave. What Power Structure Could Deny Lord Hill-Norton Access to UFO Information? SO WHAT POWER STRUCTURE WAS HE IMPLYING WOULD BE ABLE TO DENY HIM ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT UFOS AND EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES? He was saying that he, as a 5-star military officer, and as a man who literally could have picked up the telephone and spoken to the Queen, the Prime Minister, the U. S. President, anyone! That was the level of access that Lord Hill-Norton had. But even he said that there was a level – I’ll have to choose my words carefully and I’ll get into trouble for this probably – but he said there were levels that he could not access even at his level of rank and seniority. He said there were places he could not go. There was information he could not access. There were people he could not go into see. You can use phrases like ‘secret government,’ ‘cabal’ - I don’t know. DID YOU EVER ASK HIM STRAIGHT OUT IF HE WAS REFERRING TO THE MAJESTIC 12 GROUP SET UP BY TRUMAN IN THE 1940S AND IF THE UNITED"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"STATES WAS IN FACT IN CONTROL OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN HUMANS AND NON-HUMANS? There is an old joke here in the U. K. and the joke goes like this. People ask the Secretary of State or Defence, ‘Are there any circumstances when you wouldn’t go along with the American policy on anything?’ And the answer comes back, ‘Only if they tell us not to.’ (laughs) We in the U. K. are very much the junior partner here of the U. S. Basically, Britain does what America tells Britain to do. THEN IS THE CANCELING OF THE UFO PHONE HOTLINE AND THE DISCONNECT FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM TO THE U. K. PUBLIC AS OF DECEMBER 1, 2009, AN ORDER FROM THE UNITED STATES TO THE U. K.? I don’t know that. I genuinely don’t know the answer to that, but one important thing to say in relation to the way this story has been played in the media. It’s important, I think, to make the point that this is not just the cutting off of a phone line. This is not just the termination of an email address. However this has been spun and played in the media, this is nothing less than the termination of the British government’s UFO project. This is 50 years of research and investigation that we’ve done in this country terminated at the stroke of a pen! This is Britain formally disengaging from the UFO issue for whatever reason and I do not know what that is. 2009 British UFO Reports At 10-Year-High The ultimate irony is that here in the U. K. UFO sightings are at a 10-year-high. There might be an element of what I call corporate irritation. The MoD has been looking at this for over 50 years. The MoD gets more Freedom of Information Act requests on UFOs than almost any other subject. So, actually there is a lot of work. Pulling out of the UFO Project does, I guess, enable the MoD to disengage from a subject that has given it all manner of difficulties for the last 50 years. SO WHY CLOSE DOWN THE MoD UFO PROJECT NOW? I don’t know. You could say that UFO sightings are at a 10-year-high, so actually this is a difficult issue that the MoD wants to disengage from. The MoD is mid way through a 3-year program of declassifying and releasing the entire archive of UFO files – literally tens of thousands of documents, some of which were classified at very high levels – SECRET U.K. EYES ONLY. So, just when UFOs are big news, the MoD takes a step back and says, ‘No, we can’t deal with this. We don’t know how to respond to it. We don’t know what this is. These things are in our air space. Pilots see them; they are tracked on radar. We’ve seen them for 50 years performing speeds and maneuvers that we can’t even conceive of let alone match. It’s a difficult problem and it doesn’t surprise me that they have walked away. Most Impressive 2009 U. K. UFO Case WHAT 2009 CASE HAS IMPRESSED YOU THE MOST WITH THE MOST SUBSTANCE? In early January 2009, we had a wind turbine about 300 feet tall designed to generate ecologically friendly power. It was hit by something. Local people described lights in the sky. Then they heard a huge bang at about 4 AM. The following morning when they looked at this thing, they found that one of the blades that was 65 feet in length had been ripped off. One of the other blades was bent out of shape and the third blade was intact."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"O n right is one of the damaged wind turbine's 65-foot blades that came off and a second blade was crumpled. The site is two miles northeast of Louth, Lincolnshire, England. Residents reported unidentified aerial lights in the night sky nearby, which provoked Britain's The Sun to headline on January 8, 2009, “UFO Hits Wind Turbine” with a special feature quote below by Nick Pope, former MoD manager of UFO Project. Image © 2009 by MSNBC. My View By NICK POPE UFO expert THIS could be one of the most significant UFO incidents for years. If something collided with the wind turbine - as seems certain - there may be residue on the damaged parts that could help solve this mystery. In the last few months there have been two near-collisions between UFOs and police helicopters - and now this. There's a public safety issue here, whatever you believe about UFOs. The Ministry of Defence's standard line on UFOs isn't good enough. The MoD and the Civil Aviation Authority need to investigate as a matter of urgency. People speculated that something had hit this wind turbine and what was very interesting – and this was a front-page news story in The Sun, Britain’s best selling daily newspaper. What was really interesting – and this has never been really explained – was that somebody at the MoD phoned up The Sun and tried to suggest that this was some secret prototype drone code named Taranis (Celtic god of thunder), manufactured by British Aerospace Systems, Ltd., one of the U. K.’s leading defence contractors. But on January 9, 2009, the MoD denied the Taranis had been flying near the site of the smashed wind turbine.

Now, what’s extraordinary about this as you well know, normally the U. K. Ministry of Defence would bend over backwards to avoid any public speculation or discussion about prototype for military aircraft or drones and Black Projects and that sort of thing. YES, I REMEMBER. I DID A SHORT STORY AT EARTHFILES WITH THOSE PHOTOGRAPHS THAT THE SUN RAN AND THOUGHT AT THE TIME, ‘IF THIS IS NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE AND THESE WIND TURBINES HAVE BEEN OUT AROUND THE WORLD FOR A LONG TIME, WHY SUDDENLY AT THAT MOMENT IN THAT PLACE IN ENGLAND WOULD THERE HAVE BEEN A VIOLENT AGGRESSION ON THE PART OF A PHENOMENON TOWARDS THAT WIND TURBINE? Yes, this is clearly a mystery. And something very interesting happened here and the fact that the Ministry of Defence would contact a national newspaper and effectively start leaking stories and hints and suggestions (it was a BAS drone) suggests to me that someone somewhere knew a little bit more about this than they were letting on. I don’t know what that thing they knew was, but I would like to know it. WHAT IS YOUR PERCEPTION OF AGENDAS? ARE WE DEALING WITH INTELLIGENCES THAT ARE AGGRESSIVE? OR NOT AGGRESSIVE? AND WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT THE TURBINE INCIDENT THAT MIGHT SUGGEST TO YOU WHAT EVERYONE WANTS TO KNOW – ARE WE DEALING WITH SOMETHING THAT IS GOOD? BAD? NEUTRAL? I WONDER WHAT YOU THINK AT THE END OF DECEMBER 2009? To me as someone who worked for the Ministry of Defence for 21 years, the UFO issue is something that is self-evidently of concern. It raises defence, national security and air safety issues. I say the last point because of there have been numerous near-misses between UFOs and commercial aircraft some of which have involved pilots having to take evasive action. This is not the UFO community saying this. This is the government saying this on its various websites if you look hard enough. The best place to hide a book is in a library. The information is out there, but it’s hidden among the more obscure stuff. But bottom line, I do not know. I’m the guy that did this for the government and I’m going to be honest with you and say hands up, I do not know what is going on. Honestly, I don’t. It might be hostile. It might be benign. But bottom line, I don’t know. DID LORD HILL-NORTON EVER SUGGEST TO YOU THAT HE HAD INSIDE INFORMATION ABOUT AGENDAS, POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE? Lord Hill-Norton was furious at what he felt was an attempt to cut him out, as a 5-star military officer, of this UFO issue. They did not brief him on something that he, as Britain’s most senior military officer – had a right to know. He believed that UFOs were extraterrestrial. He believed that some people in government knew about it and were covering it up. But as far as I can recollect, and we corresponded for a while and I met him one or two times, but I don’t think he expressed an opinion"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"about whether this phenomenon was malevolent or benign.

Either they know something or they very strongly suspect something, but for the Catholic church to be talking in the terms that they are about some of these things possibly being extraterrestrial and saying if we are not alone, it’s not counter to church doctrine – I don’t think you come out with a statement like that unless you either know or very strongly suspect.” Vatican: “Believing in Aliens Is OK” I mage © 2009 by Chris Stanfield, AP. The Vatican in Rome released two statements in 2009 about extraterrestrial life in our universe. The first was in early May 2009 from the Reverend Jose Gabriel Funes, the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Vatican’s chief astronomer and scientific adviser to Pope Benedict. Rev. Funes said in an interview with the Vatican newspaper, “How can we exclude that life has developed elsewhere? Just as there is a multiplicity of creatures on Earth, there can be other beings, even intelligent, created by God. This is not in contrast with our faith because we can’t put limits on God’s creative freedom. Why can’t we speak of a ‘brother extraterrestrial’? It would still be part of creation.” This refreshingly open minded statement was quite different than earlier arguments with scientists about evolution versus creationism and whether the Bible should be read as literal truth versus interpretive history. Then seven months later in November 2009, the Pontifical Academy of Science hosted a gathering of leading scientists from around the world to discuss possible discoveries of bacterial life forms on another planet such as Mars and the search for life in the larger cosmos where more than 400 planets have now been discovered beyond our solar system. Prof. Chris Impey from the University of Arizona told the Vatican-hosted meeting: “ Microbial life is not likely to challenge the world’s major religions, but if we find creatures that rival us or exceed us in intelligence ... then I think that’s going to be very interesting.” More Information: F or further information about the UFO phenomena in the United Kingdom, please see Earthfiles Archive (partial list below): • 09/03/2009 — Part 1: RAF Bentwaters Feedback from Viewers and Listeners • 08/30/2009 — Part 7: UFOs and the National Security State with Historian Richard M.
