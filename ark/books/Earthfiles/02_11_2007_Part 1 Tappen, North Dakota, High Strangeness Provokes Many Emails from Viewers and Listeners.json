That night on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory , I also reported about the Tappen, North Dakota, cattle ranch family that have had an extraordinary series of events occur since October 2005. Farmers in Tappen, with a current population of about 200 people, have been challenged by mysterious deaths and disappearances of livestock. One of those families is Myra and Torrey Briese, both in their late forties, who have lived in Tappen all their life. Their five children are Tessa 23, Trista 20, Evan 16, Tia 11 and Marshel 3.

In October 2005, high strangeness descended. Torrey Briese found one of his cows dead that coyotes would not touch. In April 2006, 16-year-old Evan encountered a wedge- shaped craft emitting blue beams at the water pond not far from the dead cow. Afterward, the Brieses found an odd disc-shaped pattern cut into the dead cow's hair. By June, Torrey Briese and one of his neighbors watched a blue light make right angles in a midnight sky as if looking for something. In August, Torrey and the family saw several lights over their ranch making a grid pattern as if searching. Then on September 11, 2006, Evan encountered tall, thin, non-human creatures in the pig corral dragging off his sister's dead, pet sow. A couple of weeks later, a neighbor raising sheep found his breeding buck mysteriously dead without signs of blood, tracks or struggle. A veterinarian was hired to do a necropsy and found that one of the testicles had been surgically removed through a straight line in the bottom of one testicle sac. On December 5, 2006, a large male boar disappeared from the Briese pig corral. After my January 26th Earthfiles and Coast news updates about the extraordinary Tappen, North Dakota, events, I have received hundreds of emails from viewers and listeners who have also encountered lights, craft and creatures. In this Part 1, and subsequent reports, I am sharing some of those many emails without name attribution. My hope is that others will come forward with firsthand experiences about interactions with non-humans. My email address is: earthfiles@earthfiles.com .

It sounds like a credible story. You asked for people to come forward with their stories. I have debated this in my mind, but I think I need to tell you what has happened to me. In the last five years, I have experienced some major changes in my body and my life. Whatever happened to me as a child has manifested now. I feel as if something inside me has been awakened. Here is my story. This is circa early 1970s in the days of Bobby Orr and the Big Bad Bruins: When I was a kid, I played ice hockey (still do). My friend, Jackie, slept over one night and my father was driving both of us to the rink at 5:30 in the morning for our practice. We got dressed in our equipment (except skates) and uniforms. My father went out to start the car and then he came back in. When we were ready, he sent us out to put our equipment in the car. We went out to the door and were putting our bags in the trunk when we looked up in the sky. Above our heads no more than 100 feet was a flying craft. We could see the bottom of it and it looked like panels formed together. It was shaped like the letter D. The flat side of the D was the front of the craft. There were brilliant white lights emanating in front of it. No other lights. It was moving incredibly slow. Jackie and I were afraid and jumped into the back seat of the vehicle. I remember looking out the windshield and seeing the houses and backyard all lit up with white light. Eventually, we saw the craft still moving slowly in the same direction. Eventually, it went over the distant tree line and out of view. The event sent me on an interesting path. I became very interested in space and science fiction. I saw my second UFO when I was in the car driving on the highway a few years later. I was in the backseat and I was looking out the window at a light in the sky. I kept watching it and eventually my mother, who was in the back seat, started looking in the same direction trying to figure out what had captured my attention. Suddenly, the light, which was probably five to ten miles in the distance, shot across the sky in an instant. It appeared far to our right. It must have covered 10-15 miles in one or two seconds. That means about 180,000 miles in an hour. That's fast. I asked my mother if she saw it and she said yes.\" 2) Medina, Texas - 1970s - Female \"I really enjoyed your interview with the sixteen year old boy in North Dakota and the pictures of his farm. What a brave young man who came to the defense of his animals. I pray those entities will leave him and his family alone. And leave ALL of us alone! Want to tell you about a mysterious object I saw at the ranch back in the 1970s. I was on the screened-in porch looking up the north draw towards the old chicken house, about half a football field, or less, away. I saw a brightly colored object with many pretty lights on it resting on the ground. It was maybe 12 feet high, a balloon-shape on top appeared to be attached to a square shaped base. Thought it must be a weather balloon and I'd investigate it later. The ranch was on land in Medina, TX and is no longer in the family. It was about 10 miles out of town and was over 600 acres.\" 3) East Lansing, Michigan - July 1960s - Female 9 to 10-years-old \"Please allow me to relate to you an experience I had as a 9 or 10 year-old child. My neighborhood abutted a series of undeveloped farm fields in Michigan. We kids made a baseball diamond in a clearing, and there were various paths and trails through the surrounding woods, much favored by children out to escape parental control or boredom. On a humid July day in the early 1960s, I took a walk in that area, following a path down a ditch, on my way to the woods. Always fascinated by nature and wild animals, I thought I knew every bird and beast that frequented the Michigan wilds. Some movement on the other side of a very dense brush made me stand stock still to see what it could be. Instead of an animal or human, a being with leathery grey skin came out of the brush ... it seemed to materialize rather than have to part the branches to approach me."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The being was about the same height as I was, 3 - 4 feet tall, what I now can call a typical Grey, though at the time it was totally unlike anything I ever remembered seeing. The being was of a gentle and friendly demeanor. S/he had large, slanted, black, shiny eyes. It communicated to me telepathically, told me it had been my friend for a long time. As the shock of seeing it wore off, my natural curiosity overcame my fear. I asked the being where it was from. It responded: 'From here, from this Earth.' I asked if I might touch the being's skin, and it allowed me to touch its forearm. It felt like I thought a shark's skin would have felt: thick and leathery, but pliable. Then I did something very childish: I stuck a finger directly into one of the being's eyes ! It reacted with pain, flinching away. I stammered 'I'm Sorry! I thought they might be sunglasses' -- only half truthfully. I was genuinely dismayed that I had caused pain to this being. I had not been convinced it was really alive until then. Then it telepathically gave me a long conversation. It asked me if I was curious to see a different kind of creature, one I had never met before. I said yes. The being told me to follow close behind it, and it proceeded into a different part of the woods than I usually went. We came to a hummocky area where a tree had fallen, and some sunlight filtered down to the ground. At first I saw nothing but the trees and vegetation undergrowth. The Grey stood by me, and before I saw the other creature, my friend said s/he would protect me from being permanently damaged by what I would see next. My mind raced, and I asked if it was the sight of the other creature which could damage me: the answer was yes. I looked over at the fallen tree, and saw a small swirl of fog or dust, beginning to take form into some solid being. Like a blast of searing pain through my forehead, my mind perceived an intelligence more powerful than my Grey friend, which my human eyes could not focus on or describe in any way. The new creature was so alien to anything I had ever encountered, that the brain failed to register it as any corporal form that could be described. There was an incredibly strong mental blast of evil and hatred for the human race coming from the new entity. My eyes wept and I fell to my knees and then covered my face and cowered to the ground. Time seemed to speed up. The new creature told me things which were to happen in the future. My best friend was to die in a car crash before he reached adulthood. I protested and wept. The creature told me that I would not have any children of my own. I screamed at it that it was wrong, that it was a liar, and wept in pain. The entity reveled in my despair. Then a telepathic disagreement broke out between my friend the Grey and the other entity. In a split second, a heavy mental veil fell over my mental processes, and I was shielded from any further contact from the evil entity. My Grey friend led me back down the path, until I could find my way back home. There you have it: my recollection of an encounter with two different species of trans-dimensional beings. Needless to say, despite my protests, the events predicted by the evil entity did occur. My best friend died at the age of 19, in a car crash. I am in my fifties now and do not plan to have children. Whether that idea was my own or was planted by another, I leave up to speculation.\" 4) Englewood, Colorado - January 15 to 16, 2007 - Adult Male \"Just last week probably the 15th or 16th of Jan, 2007, I was brushing my teeth and looking out our bathroom window. So it must have been about 9 PM, I saw this craft w/ this extremely bright light on the part facing me. It was so bright I almost had to shield my eyes. I opened my window to see if I could hear anything - thinking search helicopter. There was absolutely no noise. It was zigzagging fairly slowly at a low altitude meandering northward at a (probable) distance of a half mile to a mile away. When it would turn more north, I could see that it was triangular and had dimmer lights on each of the opposite ends. I yelled for my wife, but she didn't get there in time to see anything. Because"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"it was just too far away by then and we have lots of trees around us. I have also seen a circular craft that I could probably have hit with a rock. It was as big around as a 1200 sq ft house but only about 4 to 5 ft thick in the center which was a dome that was possibly a yard in diameter. The craft narrowed to about a foot-thick at the edges. I seriously doubt if a human could have been piloting. It came right down the center of the rooftops at treetop level. It was on the east side of the block. I was throwing newspapers and it was about 4 AM December of 1999. This one made no noise and came in very rapidly and slowed rapidly to less than 5 miles an hour. Basically floating. It was ringed w/ flashing type of lights. I was at a dead end so I could not follow it. I guess I got a little creeped out when it made an adjustment to it's direction it was going. When it did it simply went in another direction - but nothing turned.\" 5) Anonymous Source \"I wanted to describe two different instances where I believe to have had contact with greys, two different type of greys from my recollection. To this day it almost seems as if it never happened. I think back to those instances and kind of ask myself if I was dreaming, if indeed it really happened for it now seems a bit like a blur. The first instance happened two years before the second. I was up late, which of course always seems to be the case. I was chatting with a friend using a chat program. Nothing else was on - no lights, no tvs, no radios, the only light available was the computer monitor. After awhile online, I started hearing what sounded like tapping. The tapping was more or less like someone tapping their fingers on a hard surface. I looked around the room which was fairly open and saw nothing. I did not think to look directly behind me. But eventually I found myself having to do just that. On the other side of the room between the front door and the steps that led to them, I saw what looked like at first to be a floating mask. I found it odd and continued to stare at it. It seemed roughly to be about three feet off the ground. I then came to the conclusion as to what it was when my sight changed to the wall directly to the side. I saw what looked like fingers and they where moving as if gripping the side of the entrance. The mask moved a bit and I froze. I continued to stare and it continued to stare back as well. I asked myself what it was doing and why it was there? After a few more minutes, I got the nerve to turn around. When I turned to look back again it was gone. This was the first time. I believe it to be a small grey. The second time around was two years later and yet again I was at the computer. I noticed out of the corner of my eye that where was flashing going on in my kitchen. I had no lights on and the lights in the kitchen where off. I wrote it off as lightning, but when I looked out the window I saw no clouds. Turning to get a better look, I was about to get up and see what was giving the light show. It was the back yard, so I suspected it could not be a police car or any other emergency vehicles. As I went to get up, I saw something move in the door way and it seemed the lights had stopped. I this time instead of freezing grabbed up something. I can't remember what it was and was prepared to defend myself for I thought I was being robbed. But what I got instead was this tall skinny grey just as tall as the doorway. It stepped right into the doorway and it looked at me. Its expression looked as if it was angry as if it had a really angry glare. Unlike the first time, I did not freeze and instead was deciding how to handle the situation. But as I did this, it took a step back and faded into the darkness - no flashes, no noises, it was just gone. I got the nerve to walk into the kitchen and flip the light switch and indeed it was not there. What I don't understand is why neither the small rounded-face grey nor the tall sharp angry looking grey did anything, just stared.\" 6) Vine Grove, Kentucky (near Fort Knox) - 1965 to 1966 - Female 13 to 14- Years-Old \"When I was a teenager in the the 1960s we lived near Fort Knox, Kentucky. It was little rural town, Vine Grove. I was about 13 or 14 so it was about 1965 or 1966. I don't remember exactly date now but I do remember the encounter. I have not really talked about it since then. My friend and neighbor and her brother and I were walking around the neighborhood at just about dark time (not much to do there, very rural area). Anyway we were just walking and talking and were close to our homes. All of"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"a sudden there was an object just over our heads, just a little higher than the the light poles. It made no noise at all. It was round with lights around and dome on top. We could see that it was some type of aircraft. It just stopped above us and was stationary but still made no sound. It scared us to death! We all had lived near military bases and were familiar with military aircraft and this was nothing we had seen before. I think there was some being in the dome. It was dark but I could see movement in it. My friend and her brother ran to her home to get their parents and I stayed for a few minutes and watched the object. It moved slightly and then aimed a beam of light in the open field behind our homes, still no sound. When it did that, I ran home and got my parents. By the time our parents got outside it was gone and no trace of it in the sky. Our parents knew we really saw something strange because we were so frightened. My father worked at Fort Knox and one of the Generals was a good friend of my father. So the next day Daddy asked him about any military things that may have been in the area. He checked, but nothing was suppose to be there. Anyway I just wanted to tell someone about this. I have always wondered what we saw.\" 7) Lake Tahoe, California - Summer 1980 - Adult Male \"In the summer of 1980 while traveling to Lake Tahoe from June Lake, my girl friend and I saw a large UFO - larger than a 747 airliner - just north of Mono Lake a quarter mile off Hwy 395. It was saucer-shaped with blue and orange colored lights. As we got close, it vanished, except that we lost 15-20 minutes or more. I woke up on the top of the pass driving towards Bridgeport, California, not knowing how I got there after what had to be a 15 mile drive. I was freaked out! I was driving and refused to stop. Everything looked spooky and I was scared to death. It took me until Topaz Lodge on the border of Nevada and California to calm down. We told some people, but they thought we where nuts. So, then we decided not to contact the Military. My mind was so clouded until the following day. Two months later my girl friend Debbie got extremely ill, and was in a coma in Mammoth Hospital for 10 days. They discovered an unknown virus in her bone marrow. They treated it like encephalitis, but it didn't work. They could not isolate what is was - it kept eating the glucose in her bone marrow. Finally, she got better. In Sept of 2006, I saw blue white orbs above San Clemente, California. At first there was 2 than 5 then 0 then up to 8 then a triangle formed. They looked like they where having fun, they then just disappeared. Later that night, a family in Dana Point had these objects above their house doing the same thing. They reported that to UFON. In Orange and San Diego counties, I have seen big holes in the clouds like what you described! I have seen more different types of UFOs over San Clemente, including a diamond-shaped object over TRW in 1997. Also I have seen 3 lights that looked like a beam of energy transferred from two objects into one and then disappeared. That was also above TRW area in 1998. I also lived in Fallbrook for 5 years where I saw a jet fighter chasing a small red object at under 10,000 feet. The jet came from Miramar Base and chased it over Camp Pendleton (Marine Base north of San Diego) in 2001. As it got so close, the object just turned left and was gone over the ocean in a blink of an eye. The jet shut down the after burners and turned back towards Miramar. In 2001 to 2003, I saw two barbell-shaped UFOs in the same place over a year and half apart. The first one my wife watched it through binoculars. It was there 10 minutes, then it just faded in to thin air. The same area a year and a half later, same shaped object in same spot, except I heard a large military jet - probably a Wart Hog from Miramar - getting closer. As the sound came closer, the object just blended into the sky and vanished. I will end with when I was 3-years-old 1957 to 1958, there was a crash of some sort in New Jersey near Livingston. (I looked for it on the Internet but could not find anything.) My dad took me there. I remember it looked like silver pieces on the side of a h ill off the turnpike. My Dad had a PHD in physics and worked for Westinghouse at the time. All I remember is the silver"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"shiny pieces and he never talked about again. Losing that time in 1980 and waking up 15 miles away driving still haunts me.\" 8) Wisconsin - Date Unknown - Male 8-Years-Old \"I live in Wisconsin and I have had at least two UFO Alien experiences. When I was a little kid, around the age of eight, my friend and I used to play in a huge wooded cow pasture that did have a large forest-like area. We had seen a few things that we couldn’t explain from time to time. We sometimes felt like we weren’t alone, but didn’t think much of it. Then one morning we had a life changing experience that changed my life forever. It was a nice summer day, normal like many summer days - nothing was abnormal. My friend and I were in the woods exploring and climbing about the fallen logs in a wooded are. We had been here before. All the sudden we became captivated by a vibrating and low humming sound. The was buzzing like it was electric. We were both scared and aware that something was going on. We were both powerless to do anything. Our ability to flee was frozen, we were frozen, and suddenly we both were under complete control of something up in the tip top tree area. Our vision was totally impaired, we couldn’t run. We were frozen, yet aware of the buzzing, and knew we were under control of something very powerful, not of this earth. We couldn’t see what it was. I was terrified and paralyzed with the most fear I had ever experienced. We were informed that we were not going to be hurt, and we would only be a little bit uncomfortable. Whatever the thing was that had kidnapped us, assured me we would not be hurt. Whatever this thing was, it was not speaking out loud, but it was communicating telepathically. I could feel it was deep inside my mind. I felt it had wisdom and age far beyond anything of this planet. There was no doubt I was in for an experience that I had no control of. I was terrified. This thing was doing an examination of me and something was going on with my genitals. It seemed that there were others aliens present. I screamed and struggled in terror and I went into like a drug induced coma. I was powerless to run, scream, or do anything. For the alien it was just like business as usual. They had a job to do, and they were going to complete the assignment. They proceeded in a very cold manner, like they had done all this stuff many times before. The beings were not doctors, but they were doing 'doctor-like-procedures.' I was told that the more I struggled, the longer these procedures would take. Eventually I became more comatose, like I was given more of whatever it was that was paralyzing me. I was totally powerless. Mentally I was still aware of the telepathic communication among the beings doing the procedures. It was all very medical like. I was relaxed. I couldn’t make out what the beings were conversing about telepathically. Some of the beings, one or two I think were female. They were mentally speaking a language, not spoken on this planet. The language was alien and they were speaking telepathically!!! There was no doubt. I could hear them! The beings were very kind and reassuring. All was going well, I told that I was a good patient, and soon this would be all over. I think a female was communicating with me now. I was not so terrified, I started to believe the abductors. After all they haven’t given me any reason to not believe anything they told me. I felt that they had a wisdom and powers way beyond anything people of this planet were ever aware of. Later that evening, my buddy and I awoke out of a drug-like induced coma. We laid on the ground trying to regain our faculties. This took hours. We lay near each other, tired and unable to function normally yet. We were aware of our earthly environment now. The ordeal was now over ...or was it? Twelve hours ago, my buddy and I were playing around at 8:00 PM; it was now 8:30 PM. Now, we are mangled physically, and hung over from an alien"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"medical examination. We both knew a lot had gone on. Neither I nor my buddy could speak for what seemed to be an eternity. Whatever it was that had examined us, was gone now. We were close to the spot where we had been abducted. We didn’t say much. I was wondering what I would say to my parents. I did not know if I had been gone for hours, days or weeks. I knew I had been somewhere, and something strange had happened. Something strange had happened, but how do you explain something not of this earth? Who would believe a kid like me? We were both very tired and hungry. Unknown to us, we looked like we had been through the wringer. We slowly walked back to the residential area where we both lived. It was a struggle for me to walk. My crotch hurt, my head hurt, my eyes hurt. Something had been down my throat. My belly- button area was very painful. Something had protruded into my belly-button and it hurt a lot. Later there was evidence of blood and bruising in the abdomen and belly button area. My whole body hurt. I wanted to cry, but I was unable. I knew the adults would be adding more to my pain. No, the worst was not over. Soon the inquisition would start. As tired and beat-up as I was; it would be hours more before I could finally rest, in a heap, and have some peace. This had been a very bad dream, I thought; but it wasn’t a dream. It was a real life terrifying nightmare. Both of us had suffered a bloody nose and our faces hurt. Both of us had blood-shot eyes, so red that we both received a medical examination the following day. I think my buddy first went for the medical exam that night. Our parents were furious with us. My buddies’ parents had called the police. Now we were separated, nobody believed our stories. The adults seemed to get angrier, the more I attempted to tell the truth. I had been molested by something not of this world. My account is real, I am not making any of this up. Keep up the good work. Like they say, the truth is out there.\" C ontinued in Part 2.
