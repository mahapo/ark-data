S. Intelligence Source July 30, 2009 Yatesbury, Wiltshire, England - Being back in Wiltshire reminds me of the night back in the late 1990s when I was doing a live COAST report to Art Bell from a red English telephone booth in the countryside. With me were others who had joined me at the East Field silage pit for a night watch after a very rainy, stormy day. I had a powerful infrared scope that had been loaned to me by a former military friend - which was possible then before 9/11- and we had been looking into the dark mist over the East Field toward Golden Ball Hill to see if any mysterious lights might show up, since the small, glowing orbs have been seen before, during and after crop formations are created. I was passing the scope around to the others and at one point when the infrared scope was back in my hands, we all thought we saw a flash of red out in the darkness. When I focused the infrared scope on where I thought I saw the red flash, to my astonishment, there was a bright, white oval at the center of the scope that began to move jumping side to side. All of us watched it at various times through the scope. When I had the infrared back again, I called out to the darkness, Come closer, were not afraid of you. Instantly, the infrared object began to flutter in brightness, changing intensity more and more rapidly and suddenly changed from the white oval into an even brighter square that reminded me of a mirror glinting under a noontime sun. But none of us could see anything in the darkness with our eyes. The pulsing oval that transformed into a glittering, fluttering square mirror all happened in an infrared frequency. Back then, none of us had a way to videotape or film through the military infrared scope. This week I have viewed an extraordinary videotape in visible light range taken on June 14, 2009, by Paul Jones, a researcher for the Open Minds Forum Research Team. Pauls crop research colleague is Andrew Pyrka, a taxicab driver. Both are from Cheltenham, Gloucestershire County, about 50 miles west of Avebury, Wiltshire, and both are fascinated by crop formations. Paul and Andrew have been trying to make the hours drive from their respective homes to Wiltshire on weekends for night watches. June 14, 2009, Barbury Castle Aztec Bird and UFO "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"B arbury Castle \"Aztec Bird\" reported June 14, 2009. Aerial image © 2009 by Lucy Pringle. On Sunday, June 14, 2009, the two men had their respective visible light video cameras with them when they visited what was known as the Aztec bird below Barbury Castle, first reported that morning north of Marlborough. Paul Jones had a tripod mounted with his JVC Hard Disk Camcorder and its 32 times Mega Pixel Optical Zoom. Andrew Pyrka did not have a tripod for his older hand-held Panasonic Video camera. The two men encountered an angry farmer who told them they could not enter his field containing the Aztec Bird. So at 8:30 PM, June 14, 2009, the two men were driving down a hill away from Barbury Castle when they both saw a dark, swirling mass near the horizon. Paul Jones and Andrew Pyrka stopped their van and each got a pair of binoculars. I could see a silver disc that either had a bright white light or the sun was glinting off. Andrew thought it might be a helicopter, Paul told me. I have watched a half-hour of their visible light videotape and the aerial object appears to be silver metal with a bright, white light at one end that at first is shining toward Paul's camera on the tripod. Then the unidentified aerial object rotates so that the white light moves to one side and the strangely shaped object - not a perfect disc shape, but almost trapezoid - hovers without moving for ten minutes. Then the silver object began to descend for ten seconds until it goes behind the horizon hill down toward land between Barbury Castle and Swinden."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Andrew Pyrka decided to take his hand-held camera out into the field in the direction that the craft descended, while Paul stayed with his tripod and camera. For fifteen minutes, nothing was in the sky. Then suddenly, Paul spotted the silver craft back pretty much where it had been before and started videotaping a second segment with his camera on the tripod. “Andrew seemed to be walking around looking as if he could not see it! So, I called"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"him on my cell phone and asked him, ‘Can't you see the silver craft in front of you?’But Andrew could still not see it!” Andrew Pyrka was very confused. He was looking all around him, but could not see anything in the sky in any direction! So, Paul began trying to guide Andrew by phone closer and closer to the silver craft above him. At one point, Paul yells in the phone, “Andrew, you're so close, put your arm up and see if you can feel anything.” Andrew Pyrka lifted his left arm straight up toward the sky. “Instantly, when I put my arm up, there was a huge jolt of electrical current that went down my raised arm. I don't think I touched anything solid,” he told me, “but I definitely interacted with some kind of strong field the UFO must have been giving off. But why couldn't I see it where I was, while Paul could not only see it, he videotaped it for another fifteen minutes?”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"This is the only color, visible light videotape I've ever seen amid crop formations in which a silver aerial craft can be seen for such a long time stationary, then descending, and then back again while one eyewitness can see the second re-appearance of the aerial craft whiile the second eyewitness can't see it. Back in the mid-1980s after I had produced the TV documentary A Strange Harvest, a man who had worked for an American intelligence agency told me the U. S. government was well aware that UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin and had a technology that could deflect photons. He said, “You can have 100 people in a park and this alien technology can control photons to such a point that only one person out of the hundred might see a craft right above their heads. That also could explain the cases of people driving cars on a busy freeway and are confused after stopping to stare at a UFO in the sky that all the other cars keep rushing by.” Andrew Pyrka plans to release his videotape in a television documentary special some time in the future. Other UFO Eyewitnesses On June 14, 2009 Near Barbury Castle Charles Mallett, Director of the Silent Circle Research Centre in Compton Bassett, received two emails from other eyewitnesses near Barbury Castle on June 14, 2009: Debs Marriage emailed: We estimate the time of our sighting as between 7:55 p.m. and 8:10 p.m. My friend and I had visited the new formation at Waylands Smithy on the evening of 14th June. We left Waylands Smithy at approximately 8 p.m. and drove east towards Wantage. We were just past the Westcot turn when I exclaimed to my friend, who was driving, Theres two black UFOs! I saw two, thin black UFOs on the eastern horizon. We dipped down below the hill line (the road is undulating here) and as we drove back up, the UFOs had disappeared. We turned up the next farm track and parked up to see if we could spot them again, but to no avail. At the time I said that I thought they were the classic triangle shape , but I was seeing them edge on and traveling towards us; i.e. east to west, so they appeared as thin, black shapes with a slight bulge in the middle. I estimate they were a long way off when I saw them, at least 5 miles, but they were still large shapes, much wider than an aeroplane or the hot air balloon we had seen earlier. And very black against a sunny blue sky. Paula Dugani emailed: Here is a brief account of what I experienced on 14th June at"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Barbary Castle. At approximately 8:15 p.m. on 14th June 2009, my brother James and I visited Barbary Castle to watch the sunset. We entered through the East gate and walked towards the ring fort. We were facing West. At approximately 8:20 p.m., I looked up and saw something glinting at the edge of a cloud. On closer inspection It looked like a bubble or an orb. I stared for a number of minutes, pointing it out to James who could not see it although he was looking in the direction I was pointing. After about 2 minutes the orb seemed to disappear. I continued to walk around the ring fort but when I looked back, the orb was again visible. This time James saw it, too. We watched it for several minutes as it glinted in the sun (like a light going on and off). Now you see it now you don't!! The orb, once again disappeared, but shortly afterwards we saw a small, black object emerge from the same cloud. It looked like an aeroplane, but was traveling very slowly and made no noise that we could hear. It flew overhead and eventually disappeared into the distance.
