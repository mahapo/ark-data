Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 1 - UFO Crash/Retrievals, Status Report VII by Len Stringfield © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Now, on the tenth anniversary of his passing, I would like to honor Len Stringfield's pioneering spirit and courage to research the politically unacceptable topic of crashed aerial vehicles and entities of unknown origin and to report what he learned - even in the face of threats. Earthfiles will reprint all seven of his famous \"Status Reports\" about alleged UFO crash retrievals covering the period of 1978 to 1994. This reprinted series will begin with Status Report VII , first published in February 1994, and will go backward in time to the first report in 1978. This is done with the permission and cooperation of his surviving family. Leonard H. Stringfield 1920-1994 Background Leonard Stringfield was born on December 17,1920, in Cincinnati, Ohio. He attended the University of Cincinnati in journalism and served in the U. S. Army Air Force from early 1943 until his discharge in November 1945 as a Private First Class. He married Adella Romero in 1947 and they had three daughters. In 1950, Len began working in public relations and marketing services for DuBois Chemicals, a division of Chemed Corp., in Cincinnati, Ohio. Len told me that he knew in the early 1950s that there was a standing military order to try to bring down \"flying saucers,\" whatever they were. But he said the United States lost a lot of good pilots trying to carry out that order, so it was eventually rescinded. Len Stringfield wanted to understand the truth about the UFO phenomenon and became director of the Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects (CRIFO), one of the world's largest research groups during the mid-195Os. Len also published CRIFO's newsletter, ORBIT from 1953 to 1957. During that same time period, he also helped the United States Air Force investigate and report UFO activity. Len was even assigned a special code number, \"3-0 Blue,\" with which he could report by phone to the Air Defense Command in Columbus, Ohio. Eventually, he gathered his CRIFO reports to the USAF in his first book, Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue, published in 1957. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"From 1957 to 1970, he was public relations adviser with the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). Later on he was director of public relations and board member of the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON). He was also regional investigator for the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) directed by astronomer, Dr. J. Allen Hynek. From 1967-1968 he served as an Early Warning Coordinator for the University of Colorado UFO Project, screening UFO reports for possible scientific study. Stringfield was also advisor to Sir Eric Gairy, former Prime Minister of Grenada, 1977-78, during his efforts to establish a UFO research agency within the framework of the United Nations. In 1977, Len's second book was published, Situation Red: The UFO Siege, which set the stage for his continued investigation into alleged crashes of UFO craft and their occupants - and U. S. government retrievals of those craft and entities. Stringfield continued that research after his retirement in 1981 as Director of Public Relations and Marketing Services for DuBois Chemicals until his death on December 18,1994.

Stringfield February 1994 I cannot tell how the truth may be; I say the tale as 'twas said to me. Sir Walter Scott Acknowledgements A special thanks to the major research organizations, such as the Fund for UFO Research for past funding, the cooperation of the Mutual UFO Network, the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies and the Mid-Ohio Research Associates. Also, thanks to all the contributors, entrusting me with material they submitted for my critique and use in this Status Report. Also, special recognition to Chris Coffey for her help in coordinating my roughly-typed copy to its final rendition on the word processor. During the summer of 1993, notably after the MUFON Symposium in Richmond, Virginia, a surprising number of new sources emerged, some making significant disclosures, or providing leads about UFO crash/retrievals. s my probes deepened into several cases, I was pleased to find corroborative data that supported an event I had learned from a source in my earlier years of research. One case, however, stood out as a potential breakthrough with a promise of supporting evidence. The informant, a lady scientist, alleged that she, as a student, under the tutelage of one of the world's greatest scientists, accompanied him to a secret location to see the alien craft and bodies. But, the evidence never materialized, though it provided, with other equally provocative cases, the impetus to work on another Status Report, herewith my seventh. Many contacts were newcomers; others came through trusted intermediaries and there were the usual few who made brief disclosures about their knowledge of crashes or alien anatomy, but faded away like Cheshires. Through September, pondering this new collection of data, my thoughts soon drifted into my many years of investigations into the crash/retrieval syndrome. As I got deeper into case histories, new and old, I found myself inexorably drawn into UFOlogy's infamous Hall of Mirrors. Like my contemporaries devoted to serious specialization, such as abductions, animal mutilations, crop circles and so on, comes a time of reckoning. Around me, in this abode of the surreal were a mix of people, facing mirrors, seeming both real and unreal. Some looked frightened, some staunchly authoritative. Somewhere in this mix, all showing distorted images in mirrors, were surely pawns, working with suspect agendas, better known as misinformants. I cannot make a final rational judgment when I look at distortions in mirrors, but despite the surrealism, I think that I can pick out some of the real that I can trust from those of the unreal, the tricksters. At this writing, I have 45 firsthand sources who claim to have witnessed the alien craft and/or the bodies in government custody. This is a large"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"number of independent sources since I started my research in this realm in 1976. I reiterate, I believe that most are telling the truth. Following are the new data from sources I met in the Hall of Mirrors from which to make a judgment. New Source Confirms Arizona 1953 Crash In spite of interruptive moments of feeling subservient to the negative influences of UFO crash/retrieval surreality, there are moments of reward, too. One, euphorically happened March 24, 1993, when I spoke before an open-to-the-public meeting at the Milford Public Library near Cincinnati. This meeting was initiated by Pat Packard, the new MUFON Section Director in Southwestern Ohio which got a lot of widespread publicity. In my extemporaneous talk, I reviewed my crash/retrieval research in which I cited the first of my firsthand sources in 1977 who revealed that he had witnessed three alien bodies arrive at Wright-Patterson AFB fresh from a crash in Arizona in 1953. This revelation prompted a member of the audience to stand up and ask that I repeat the place and time and the number of retrieved aliens. When I had finished my talk, he took me aside to reveal that he had information that would back up my 1977 source 100 percent. The case in question, published first in the paper I had presented at the MUFON Symposium in Dayton, Ohio, in 1978 and republished in greater detail as Status Report II in 1980, is excerpted as follows: \"In September 1977, I was invited to speak before 25 pilot members of the Cincinnati Chapter of the World Wings at Lunken Airport, Cincinnati, Ohio. Once the crowd milled away, a former U. S. Army Warrant Officer who had been a helicopter pilot took me alone into the large map room of the administration building. With a pointer, he indicated an area in Arizona where a UFO crash had occurred in 1953. \"I have seen the bodies,\" he said, which had arrived at night by a DC-7 at Wright-Patterson AFB where he was on special duty. The pilot at that time in 1977, who worked as an engineer, recalled that he stood inside a hangar at a distance of about 12 feet peering at five crates on a forklift. Inside of three of smaller size were humanoids about 4 feet tall lying enshrouded on a fabric which he explained prevented a freeze burn from the dry ice packed beneath. A number of air police stood silent guard nearby the crates. Before the cargo was whisked away, he said he got a good look at two of the cadavers closest to him. The pilot said, 'Their disproportionately large heads, by human standards, were hairless with skin that looked brown under the hangar lights. The eyes were large and dark; the mouth small and an indistinct nose.' Asked about their attire, he said they were wearing tight-fitting dark suits. He said he had no idea what was inside of the two additional crates. I had about a dozen private chats with the pilot since we met at Lunken Airport. Once on my request, I asked if he would sign a posthumous statement describing his experience. When he checked with his security office, he was advised to decline. In the fall of 1978, still serving as flight commander in the national guard, he strangely became unreachable by phone, leaving no forwarding address. Two UFO Crashes in Arizona I have heard of a number of stories about UFO crashes in Arizona, but it was not until the meeting at the Milford Library that I got reliable confirmation to back up the pilot's claims. My new source, JLD, a resident of Ohio, north of Cincinnati, in a surprising disclosure claimed that a close relative - the late Mr. Holly, who had"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"served in the top command in a defense department capacity at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1953 - told him about one of two crashes in Arizona. He also told him three bodies, one severely burned and parts of the wrecked craft, were delivered to that base. On July 16, 1993, when JLD and wife visited me in Cincinnati, he told me that Holly had seen the bodies that were maintained in an off-limits building - and it was not the legendary Hangar 18. Of note, he also learned that the aliens were free of harmful bacteria and suffered no teeth decay. In trust, JLD gave me his relative's name, title of his position at Wright-Patterson and, having the highest security clearance, was informed with 'eyes only' details of the Arizona incident. Said JLD, as a young teenager when he was told about the crash, his interest was airplanes, making models of World War II aircraft and admitted that he had a curiosity about flying saucers. However, in later years when he asked for more details, his relative did not wish to discuss the subject. American Jet Disintegrated in Presence of UFO During our meeting at my home, I got another item of concern which came from his relative. With the highest security clearance, he had access to Project Bluebook personnel from whom he learned some details of an air force intercept mission on the east coast near Langley, Virginia (site of CIA headquarters) in the late 1950s. According to the story, there were four fighters in a landing pattern. Two were out of fuel and one had landed. But the fourth was vectored in for the chase, which on close approach with the UFO, disintegrated. There was no trace of the pilot or the ejection seat.\" (End of excerpt) Military aircraft encounters with UFOs occasionally end in disaster. Some lose their electronic control systems, causing crashes or forced landings, or they are suddenly banished from the skies without a trace. This activity since WWII has indeed complicated the UFO agenda factor. Major Donald Keyhoe, a former head of NICAP and the premiere pioneer of the 'outer space' hypothesis, shared a few details of one encounter in the early 1970s when three U. S. jet interceptors disappeared without a trace. I recall asking him if I could publish the full story in my book, Situation Red: The UFO Siege. But he agreed only to the barest details, declining to name the coastal location where the incident occurred. He said he feared he might compromise his Pentagon source. I know of a number of off-the-record encounters with UFOs, both old and new, most of which I never published. In one recent incident in Arizona, the instruments of two fighter jets went dead and crashed. Others, to name a hot spot, is in Puerto Rico. Three such incidents have been investigated and released by researcher and journalist, Jorge Martin, which he published in a lengthy report covering intense activities on the island released at the MUFON Symposium in Richmond. World War II's Foo Fighters: A 1942 Crash Case Revealed The following UFO crash/retrieval case, occurring in 1942 during WWII, is so shrouded in super secrecy that persons and places involved are not for me to know except for the identity of my informant, Mary Nunn. Using this pseudonym, and in respect to her source, she also prefers that her location not be identified in this report. Serving in a key civil capacity at the time of the incident, she said that her source could suffer severe penalties if certain details were divulged."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" However, to soften the stigma of no-no's, my informant seemed to shy away from the glitzy fringe in her UFO research and has felt free, in the past, to pass on other important and sensitive information to me without too many restrictions. Some of it concerned Roswell from a former military source, but his guarded disclosures - minus name - are already in public domain and I find no need here to review them lest it may compromise her link with her deep-throat source. Nunn's revelations about the 1942 case are sketchy, mainly dealing with the description of the retrieved bodies and some general input regarding the craft. She hopes that others, still alive, may share additional information or at least, confirmation of the event. The spacecraft, she said, is still held at the army base where it crashed causing damage to a building on the premises and minor ruptures to the one side of the craft. According to her source, the crash occurred in a state \"north of Georgia,\" but there was no explanation given for the reason why Georgia was named. Unless it was a deliberate cover, it suggests that it may have been in the Carolinas or somewhere north along the Atlantic seaboard. The craft generally round in shape was described as 15 feet wide and 10 feet high divided into three main sections, a control room, a compartment with four seats and a bottom bay equipped with a trap door exit. In the control section was one large window and a number of smaller windows around the sides. The craft, she said, was silver in color which exhibited markings on its exterior as well as inside. The four crew members taken alive, died about two weeks later of apparent starvation. Described at 5 feet tall, weighing about 90 to 100 pounds, the skin also - unlike the little greys - was a milky white, smooth like a baby's and without hair. Facial features were generalized. The eyes large and black like bug eyes. Ears were small, lips thin slits. The fingers, numbering five, were long, bony; the feet flat, about size six with half inch bony toes. The female had small breasts and, according to the source, the race could reproduce, but there was no hint as to their genitalia. Then came the shocker: They had teeth, very white, wide and short. With teeth, I asked about nourishment, how it was digested and eliminated. No answers. Like the greys, communications were telepathic, but when I asked about other details such as anatomical, organic or emotional or about their craft, propulsion and all the other usual questions, came silence. That was it. Perhaps my friend, Mary Nunn, knows more, but I am thankful for that which she had trustingly shared. The 1942 crash incident, whatever the explanation, as a precursor to the Roswell affair, according to Nunn's source, happened in the summer at a time when the United States armed forces were in action worldwide. But it still was not an historical first. In the Spring of 1941, an alleged crash and recovery occurred in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, which is described in my status report, UFO Crash/Retrievals: The Inner Sanctum. Pre-WWII UFO activity, especially crashes, are a rarity and getting details from a firsthand, or a support, witness is indeed an achievement. Walter Webb, an astronomer and veteran UFO researcher, gets an \"A\" for his extensive investigation into a UFO incident, possibly a crash involving an army serviceman, the late Guy Simeone, who was with the 26th Infantry Division prior to the U. S. entry into the war. According to Webb, who wrote an in-depth monograph for CUFOS about the alleged incident entitled, An Anecdotal Report of a UFO Crash/Retrieval 1941, Simeone, who was one of 400,000 troops involved in a massive war-game maneuver"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"in the Carolinas, informed his family cryptically, that he was restricted from discussing his \"secret assignment\" during operations. Later a witness told Webb that she overheard Simeone's mother talking about her son being in a situation involving a crashed round metallic object and a reference to little dead bodies from space. However, there are conflicting details, said Webb, from family members and friends. The best guess, said Webb, is that something crashed in North Carolina where his unit was active during the month of October in 1941. Concludes Webb, \"Taking everything into account, I believe the Simeone episode should be classified as a tentative unknown.\" To be continued in Part 2.
