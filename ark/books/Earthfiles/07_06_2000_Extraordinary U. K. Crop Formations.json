Crop Formations © 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe June 18, 2000, this extraordinary 270 foot diameter formation in wheat was discovered at ancient Windmill Hill (3700 B. C.) not far from the sacred Avebury stone circle and avenues. Aerial photograph © 2000 by Francine Blake with her permission. July 6, 2000 Wiltshire, England - By the first week of July 2000, with so much of the summer yet to unfold, the crop circle mystery has been more global than 1999. Thirty-six crop formations have been reported in England, eighteen in Germany, three in The Netherlands, two in Spain, two in Italy, two in the U. S., one in Russia, one in Canada and one in the Czech Republic. In the past two weeks in England alone, two of the most extraordinary formations of the past decade appeared. The checkered one featured at the top of this report emerged in a field of very green immature wheat. Researcher Charles Mallett of Horton, Wiltshire discussed the Windmill Hill pattern at the web site where he and his artist wife, Frances, produce C & F Phenomenon Research Field Reports. Interview: Charles Mallett, C & F Phenomenon Research Field Reports, Horton, Wiltshire: \"The scale and scope of the design had us, to say the least, rather baffled. Standing on the ground in this maze of standing and downed squares and rectangles was, for quite some time, incomprehensible. This is not a formation to be viewed from ground level. Because the wheat had been brushed down so gently, most of the crop had returned to an almost upright position very soon after the formation was discovered. When we arrived on the scene, all we could see was a vague and rough chequer board pattern that had a strange order within the chaotic downed sections. \"What we have here is a square sectioned into various size chunks of alternating standing and downed crop that give the effect of stretch and perspective in various directions. The sides of the internal square measure 200 feet in length. This checkered square shape sits uniformly inside the 270 foot diameter circle of downed crop that creates a very imposing crop circle indeed.

There is no way we would have expected this effect from the impression we had at zero elevation.\" June 19, 2000, this 220 foot diameter circle of elegant spokes was discovered in barley across the road from the famous East Field at Alton Barnes, Wiltshire.

The next day on June 19, 2000, sixteen elegant spokes around a rose-like center were discovered carefully crafted inside a 220 foot diameter circle in barley across the road from the famous East Field at Alton Barnes. Charles Mallett noted in his C & F Phenomenon Research Field Report: \"The paths between the sixteen fans of this design have a very impressive fluid look and feel about them that continues beneath the downed central area to the very centre of the formation. \"As we studied and took time to examine the formation, we came across numerous examples of severe distortion to some of the seed heads of the barley. One in particular was so affected by whatever process caused the barley to lay down that it had become twisted and distorted, almost beyond recognition. Another seed head had a very well-cooked young snail welded to the scorched bristles of the affected plant. Most of the heat damage and distortion we observed was found on the edges and corners of the standing sections that create the elegant spokes of the formation.\" July 1, 2000, a 6-petalled flower inside a circle in wheat below the Milk Hill White Horse in Alton Barnes, Wiltshire.

If there are two different intelligences, are there two different agendas? There have been a series of 6-petalled flowers over the years in English crop fields, but this is perhaps the most elegant of all. Charles Mallett and I talked about the new Milk Hill formation by phone and he wrote in the C & F Phenomenon Research Field Report: \"This formation is situated in almost exactly the same spot as the 1997 fractal snowflake glyph, give or take a few yards. ...Between the large petals that extend almost to the edge of the inner downed circle, there are six additional shorter petals that give added body to an otherwise quite simplistic design. \"The lay of the wheat around the flower and throughout the whole formation was clean and precise. In some areas, we came across junctions in the lay that were very tightly woven and bound into knot style twists. Quite impressive. At the very centre of the formation where the construction circles cross, there were seven stalks that had been left standing in a rather delicate little bunch.\" July 2, 2000, this amazing 250 foot diameter formation of 1600 little squares of standing wheat was discovered at East Kennett near Avebury. Aerial videograph © 2000 by Peter R. Sorensen. The next day on July 2nd at East Kennett near Avebury was a shocker. Sixteen hundred little squares of standing wheat on downed crop were neatly ordered inside a circle. Photographer Peter Sorensen took both a wide shot aerial videograph and a close-up on the squares and wrote in an e-mail: \"This new formation to the South East of the West Kennett Long Barrow has a new kind of 'weave,' very unlike last summer's 1999 'Basket.' This looks more like some kind of cloth.\" Close-up aerial image of a portion of the 1600 little squares that make up the East Kennett formation near Avebury. Aerial videograph © 2000 by Peter R.
