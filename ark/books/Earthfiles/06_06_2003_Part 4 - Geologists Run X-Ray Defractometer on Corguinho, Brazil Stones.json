Right: Stone 1, in profile to show disk-shape. Stone 1 is 16mm in diameter and weighs 3.2051 grams. Stone 2, before being broken in two, was also 16mm in diameter and weighed 3.3068 grams. Both Stone 1 and Stone 2 were collected by Brazil businessman, Felipe Branco, on September 15, 2002 after the \"rain of rocks\" on the Urandir Oliveira farm in Corguinho, Brazil.

Levengood's observations about the titanium and magnetic quality of the Corguinho, Brazil stones were reinforced by the x-ray diffractometry (XRD) work done May 22-23 at the University of Pennsylvania. Prof. Johnson, whose field is soil analysis, had selected nine objects from my rock trays and collection bags. I also gave him two halves of Stone 2 that Phyllis Budinger had split open. During the first XRD run, he was joined by Prof. Gomaa Omar, an eminent rock expert, and another "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"geologist who specializes in rare earth isotopes. First up was one half of Stone 2, which they called the \"button\" on the XRD analysis shown below. Second was a piece of the melted rock that local Corguinho eyewitnesses found in October 2000 after a light came down to the top of a hill and took off again. That rock was arbitrarily labeled \"lightening strike\" because Dr. Omar said very high temperature had to have been involved.

X-Ray Diffractometry At the University of Pennsylvania, after six minute runs on May 22, 2003, there were two unresolved peaks in the \"lightening strike\" rock and it was decided to run both Stone 2 and the melted rock all night so the x-rays deflecting off the atomic planes in the mineral crystals of each rock would be able to make more \"counts\" for better accuracy. The XRD results are shown below with the melted rock on top and Stone 2 afterward. The graphics are on their side in order to accommodate larger size and reading clarity at Earthfiles.com. I apologize that my html software does not allow subscripts for the numbers in the chemical formulas as they should be subscripted."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The melted rock still has two unresolved peaks in addition to the three elements on the Peak List that make up probably 99% of its minerals: Quartz, Albite and Microcline. Rare earth isotope analysis might resolve what the unidentified peaks are and that research is underway.

It's Peak List arranged by quantity starts with Quartz, Goethite, Hematite, Rutile (which contains titanium), Albite and Cubanite. XRD was done across the interior of one half of Stone 2. It's Peak List arranged by quantity starts with Quartz, Goethite, Hematite, Rutile (which contains titanium), Albite and Cubanite. That last name on the Peak List, is Cubanite (CuFe2S3 and I apologize my software won't make subscripts of the numbers), a copper-iron sulphide mineral that occurs in copper-zinc deposits and is named after its first discovery in Cuba. Prof. Johnson told me he had never heard of Cubanite before and it was not familiar to the geology group running the XRD. In an article entitled, Canadian Rockhound Geological Magazine at canadianrockhound.com, David Joyce and Dirk Schmid wrote, \"The mineral (Cubanite) is rare and can be differentiated from chalcopyrite on the basis of magnetism, which is strong in Cubanite. As a crystal, Cubanite forms a 6-pointed star with the points radiating from a common center.\" Cubanite, CuFe2S3, crystal from the Thompson Mine in Thompson, Manitoba, Canada, a large nickel mine. Another form of Cubanite, Pyrrhotite, Dolmite (CuFe2S3) was found in Brazil"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"at the Morro Velho mine, Nova Lima, Minas Gerais, Southeast Region, which is the opposite from Corguinho in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul in north central Brazil.

Levengood is right about the magnetic field he has discovered in the Corguinho, Brazil stones he has been studying in his laboratory. But it is rutile on the XRD Peak List that contains the titanium, not ilmenite. The geologists are intrigued by current data from both samples and now rare earth isotope and other studies are ongoing. Professor Johnson told me this week, \"You have presented us with objects that are well outside the things we have encountered before, outside our experience.\" We b s it e s : http://www.canadianrockhound.com Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
