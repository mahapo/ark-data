D., Microbiologist, working in Las Vegas, Nevada in the 1990s. Photograph by BJ. September 15, 2003 Las Vegas, Nevada - The past year since September 2002, computer analyst and UFO phenomenon investigator, B ill Hamilt on, has talked to me about the frustrations of microbiologist Dan Burisch. Bill was given permission by Burisch to make on-the-record video and audio recordings about Burisch's inability to lead a free life and his desire to no longer work for the U. S. government on microbiology matters of the highest strangeness. Currently, neither Dan Burisch's parents nor Bill or friends have any communication with the scientist who is supposed to be living and st ill working for the government under a house arrest arrangement organized with Burisch's wife, Deborah. The couple married in 1990 when he was Danny Benjamin Crain. Because Deborah Burisch already had a child who had her last name and bore another child in their marriage, Dan requested a legal name change to Burisch which was granted in 1995. Why would his wife cooperate in a house arrest arrangement? Allegedly Deborah Burisch works for the same black operations group funded by the U. S. government to study biological tissues and survival questions concerning humans and the entities referred to as \"J-Rods,\" which Bill Hamilton also heard about from retired mechanical engineer, Bill Uhouse.

"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" In 1999, B ill told me that he was talking to mechanical engineer, Bill U house, who had worked on a United States military program to build an advanced simulator that could teach certain American pilots how to fly disc craft - either back-engineered or actual alien craft. The technical adviser on the project was allegedly an extraterrestrial biological entity, or EBEN, called \"J-Rod,\" who had been working with a secret agency of the United States government since 1953 at Los Alamos National Laboratory in northern New Mexico and in a secret underground facility called Site 4 (S-4) literally inside the Papoose Mountains near Groom Lake, Area 51 and Nellis AFB. The S-4 facility inside the Pa poose Mountain range is supposed to have several levels, some designated for non-human craft storage, back-engineering research and applications to modern human technologies. At least one level is said to be used for maintaining one or more extraterrestrial biological entities (Ebens) in special environmental spheres designed to provide a different, non-earth atmosphere for Ebens kept as a \"guest\" or in a \"captive\" status. Uhouse, now 78-years-old and knowing his non-disclosure agreement with the U. S. government expires in 2003, began speaking publicly about his experiences. Back then on June 14, 1999, I presented in Earthfiles.com with his permission, \" The Strange Story of J-Rod, An EBE \" © 1999 by B ill Hamilton. Since then, Bill has also had in-depth communications with microbiologist Dr. Dan Burisch (Ph.D., State University of New York, Stoneybrook), who alleges he has had assignments to study the biological fluids and tissues of an EBEN called J-Rod inside S-4/Area 51 up to 1995. Then he was assigned to a new project called Star Flower in which he researches materials allegedly related to panspermia , the seeding of life on earth from extraterrestrial or time traveler sources. Project STAAR Flower is ongoing to date, according to Burisch. Bill Hamilton gave me permission to transcribe the audio from his on-the-record interview that occurred in a Las Vegas library room last September 19, 2002, with colleague, B.J. Wolf. At the time, Dr. Burisch said he was protesting new work assignments, wanted out of his government work, had deep concerns about the future of this planet and wanted the public to know what he knows. The following transcript is provided with Bill Hamilton's permissi on, his introduction to the interview, and with the implied permission of Dr. Dan Burisch who wanted to speak out publicly before something happened to him. Introduction to September 19, 2002 Interview By William F. Hamilton \" There have been many whistleblowers over the last fifteen years who have come forth claiming to be involved with a highly secret American UFO program involving"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the reverse engineering of extraterrestrial technology and contact with extraterrestrial life forms. When Robert Lazar first divulged his involvement in such a program on Las Vegas television Channel 8 in 1989, his revelations seemed grounded in science fact. The allure of his story put an obscure top secret fac ility called S-4 on the map. Bus loads of visitors flocked to a little-known dirt road marked by a cattle rancher's mailbox on the edge of Nevada Highway 375 to see the test flights of a flying saucer emerging from behind the hills in the Tikaboo Valley. Though later discredited when investigators could not confirm Lazar's degree in physics, Las Vegas journalist, George Knapp, seemed to find some merit in his story and found some evidence that Lazar had worked at Los Alamos National Labs as he claimed. In 1999 I decided to focus on a common element to see if I could validate some aspect of the tales about Area 51 and S-4. That was when I ran across a draft document known as \"Q94-109A,\" a biological briefing document signed by one Dr. Danny B. Crain, microbiologist. The technical language in the document seemed to indicate that Dr. Crain had extracted over 200 tissue samples from a live EBE (Extraterrestrial Biological Entity), an assertion, if true, that would reveal an amazing depth to the secret U. S. government program. The EBE was known as J-Rod, a designation used previously by another whistleblower, mechanical engineer Bill Uhouse. Through a contact in Las Vegas, a meeting was arranged so that I could interview Dr. Dan Crain who had legally changed his last name to Burisch for purely personal family reasons. On our third meeting, after I had been informed that Dan had been taken to another underground fac ility in New Mexico, I had the opportunity to interview him on camera using my Sony 8 mm videocam. What follows is a transcript of that interesting interview prepared by Linda Moulton Howe from an audiotape dub. Dr. Burisch's parents both support his claim of having worked at the Nevada Test Site which makes this case unique in that respect. I have only been able to confirm a few facts about Dan himself through documents I have in my possession, but it is unlikely that Dan's story w ill ever be authenticated completely. Many will relegate it to the same bin they have for Bob Lazar. Whatever the outcome, the mystery surrounding Dan Burisch continues and the desperate measures taken by mysterious agents to keep him from living and speaking freely also continues.\" On right, Dan B.

Photograph © 2003 by William F. Hamilton. Dan B. Burisch, Ph.D., Microbiologist IV, formerly Nevada Test Site/Area 50 Sector 2/ Area 51 Sectors 3 and 4, Las Vegas, Nevada: BH: \"YOU WERE TAKEN TO - THIS WAS UNUSUAL, RIGHT? TAKEN TO THE DULCE (NEW MEXICO) FACILITY? This was the first time I was ever taken to the facility at LANL, yes. GO AHEAD AND JUST DESCRIBE. Well, I was just initially, I was not told I was being taken up to - first to Watertown and then over to the Sector 4 Facility [???????? (words unclear) facility]. I was asked to research slides at the Sector 4 Facility [???sec ond fourth ??? facility] See footnote: **(1) which showed papilloma virus. These slides were set up under transmission electron microscope. They were in mounts. They asked me what my knowledge was of pap illoma virus. I told them it was limited. They told me they needed to take me to another location. So, we boarded an aircraft, a very small Lear jet. We flew to a small airstrip. I think we had to go east. After landing, I boarded a chopper. It was a Black Hawk chopper, to the best of my knowledge. I'm not an expert in military aviation. The Black Hawk was blacked out. We flew out from the airstrip into what I was told would be part of LANL. From there, I was loaded into a light (or white?) van, taken up the road which was very bumpy. Then finally about 15 to 20 minutes, maybe 15 minutes - that includes the loading time and all that - (I was) allowed to raise the blinds on the van. I saw a couple of the road signs. One was a square sign with black lettering on a white background that said \"R-4.\" I was then told that we would be taken into (something about cell phones?), taken into a facility which is code named \"Sweetness.\" They asked me if I had ever heard of the Dulce facility or the alleged \"Section B?? or Section D?\" that you mentioned the other day. I believe that is what you are referring to. YES. I told them I had heard of it only briefly, that it allegedly existed and that a lot of genetic tinkering went on in the biological field of that facility. We r ounded to the left in the van, taken to a large door. The door opened and we were met by two gentlemen, one of which was wearing a U. S. Marine Corps (laughter about????), a Marine Corps uniform. Another was wearing a Polo shirt which was a grey Polo shirt with a black collar. There was a red cap with a very prominent red patch. It was a black triangle and something written in the triangle. You'd asked about the orientation of the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"triangle. One of the main points is that it was an equilateral triangle. One of the main points was down, so it had a flat top. Again, as God as my witness, I'm trying to remember what was inside. It bothers me when I can't remember a pattern. But we went inside. They greeted us. We went around to the left. There was a guard that provided us an orange badge. We then went in a series of roll-up doors which exited to a small foyer over to the right where there was an elevator. The elevator took us to the first level down. While we were going through the foyer, I noticed there was an \"FM-1\" sprayed on the door. The FM-1, I don't know what that meant. I was never told. If it's anything like the Sector 4, Level 1 at Papoose Lake, then I would make the assumption that the \"1\" stood for \"Level 1.\" The FM, I don't know. See footnote: **(2) After traveling down to another floor, we exited - this turned into basically a ???? business - we exited the elevator and we changed our (orange) badges to a blue badge. We re-signed in. We were fingerprinted at that point, brought into a small room and were told that they had some business that they needed to attend to with us regarding the papilloma virus. They asked if we had been briefed over the papilloma virus. At that point, myself and two other gentlemen, looked at each other and said (He kinds of shrugs like not much.) We were asked a few hours ago. They basically looked disturbed. They looked as though somebody had dropped the ball. We then went with our blue badges in hand to a second set of elevators, went down one more floor, exited where they gave us our orange badges back - or it looked like our orange badges. Following our orange badges, we entered into - it looked like - well, I've never been to the New York City subway, but it looked like a small monorail system, something like Disneyland like It's A Small World little monorail. We traveled probably several hundred yards in the monorail, exited, were greeted by a staff scientist who then told us he would escort us down a hallway to show us our areas of responsib ility. At this point, they had a near civil rebellion on their hands because we didn't know what the hell they wanted us for. I was started to get worried at this point that they were just taking us further and further into a facility and that gradually doors were going to lock. But given the number of guards they have in the facility, I s hould have said all along the way there were people who looked like they had R-15s. (spelling?) Not a place to fight a nybody. So we went down the hallway into the briefing room, at which point we were requested to perform an analysis of a plasma (??) recombination involving restriction enzymes on a variety of tissue, to remove segments of a retro-virus fragment from a variety of tissue, and if possible, associate that retro-virus fragment with the genome of the papilloma virus. WHAT WAS THE SOURCE OF THE TISSUE? DID THEY GIVE THAT? The source of the tissue was listed with a J number and a K number. The two scientists that were with me did not immediately know what that meant, given my experience at Sector 4, I knew fairly quickly that I was dealing with a J-Rod sample. OF AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL SOURCE? Yes, J-Rods are still defined - even though what we know concerning the issue of the Paradox - they are st ill defined as extraterrestrial biological entities, given the disassociation time between the Earth and where they end"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"up. RIGHT. I don't do things without reason. The two scientists who were with me, I didn't know them from Adam previous to the meeting, but I sort of sp illed the beans and let them know about the K.4 samples at Sector 4. The K.4 samples at Sector 4 specifically involved the research project having to do with Project Aquarius, in which I was one of the Working Group Leaders. Pardon me, these are difficult things to say to the camera. I UNDERSTAND. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN PACE. I have no choice. (laughter and pause) Following spilling the beans, we were separated into three separate rooms. Then proceeded the interrogation. They wanted to know why I told them about the K.4 samples. And it's the old axiom: if you are asked why, you ask why not? The interrogation ceased fairly quickly at that point and we were brought into a clean sphere environment, external capsule clean sphere environment, where we were told what the real purpose of the project was. Now, I have to be very careful. Having had no previous experience with biological warfare - I don't have a polygraph hooked to me here - having had no previous experience involving biological warfare materials, it came as quite the surprise to me that they could possibly be considering the usage of an alien retro-virus recombined with a terrestrial viral genome for possible use in biological-chemical warfare activities - or at least possible use in activities which could move towards biological warfare as applied terrestrially. But this was inconsistent - the potential, I should say, the potential, or its use in that type of environment - was inconsistent with my ethical boundaries. It would have exited the ethical boundaries that I place upon myself as a scientist and I believe that society places on me as a scientist. It also would divert from moral boundaries that I think my Creator places upon me as a human being. Therefore, my answer was no. And I thought that was it, no more participation. I thought that would have been all she wrote. They agreed to house me in the fac ility where I went with my cute little orange badge to a residential unit a little further down the tramline and one level below that. They did not change my orange badge when I went one level below. My experience in the time that I think I stayed in a residential unit there was horrifying. You know when you hear human beings screaming in pain? YES. (long pause) I think I said what I need to say.\" ** (1) Dan called S-4 either Sector 4 or Site 4 variously.
