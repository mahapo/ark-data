Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The bases are about 45 miles east of Philadelphia, 50 miles south of New York City, 60 miles north of Atlantic City and 10 miles west of the Atlantic ocean. The Fort Dix / McGuire Air Force Base / Lakehurst Naval Air Station complex covers 42,000 acres. Click back to Part I, Status Report IV To be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 3 of Status Report I V, written for the June 28-30, 1985, MUFON 1985 UFO Symposium Proceedings in conjunction with the national MUFON conference held in Saint Louis, Missouri. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report V begins at Earthfiles 012805 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Leonard H. Stringfield: \"The document is avowedly not proof. For it to be established as bona fide would, in turn, require additional irretrievable reports, memoranda, tapes, ad infinitum. In this regard, however, Morse said on several occasions that he had attempted to obtain a later Form 1569 Report mentioned by the desk sergeant, but was unsuccessful. Nevertheless, the Incident/Complaint Report, as it stands, is a strong link of evidence not easily dismissed, even if denied officially or by any of its named personnel who might be coerced to do so. ( Note 4: See Incident Complaint Report, Item 11, where the box for 'Unfounded' is checked. Inasmuch as 'Unfounded' suggests that the incident was baseless, I asked Morse to explain this classification. He said that it referred only to the limited information available to his security police squadron, which was not in a position to evaluate the incident. Also note that the check in Item 13 indicates that the case was referred to 'Other agency' (AFOSI - Air Force Office of Special Investigations) for final disposition, including 'One body of unknown origin ...' released to other authorities. The security police squadron had no basis for any other 'Evaluation.' "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Front page, January 18, 1978 Incident/Complaint Report Form 1569, prepared by Desk Sgt. WC and signed by 1st Lt. WS, it was channeled to Col. Landon, Commanding Officer of McGuire AFB; Brig. Gen. Brown, Hdq., 21st Air Force (at MAFB); and the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI). The Genesis for Case A-3, as it is designated in Status Report III , [to be reprinted in future Earthfiles] is a taped rebroadcast over the Armed Forces Far Eastern Radio Network of an interview conducted by Charlie Tuna of KATZ, Los Angeles, July 28, 1980. I remember the interview well which concerned my UFO crash/retrieval probes at which time I was promoting Status Report II , [to be reprinted in future Earthfiles] published by MUFON. At the close of the interview, I gave my home address for listeners who might contribute information. By chance, Morse (with his new Security Police Squadron in Okinawa) heard it as did others in the U. S. Armed Forces in the Far east. As confirmation of this, I have a letter of inquiry from a serviceman, D. N. Cook, stationed in Korea who mentioned the broadcast. (Letter on file.) To establish how it all began is important, I believe, for it diminishes the chance that Morse might have acted in collusion with a Stateside hoaxer. Also, to verify that he was stationed in Okinawa, I asked questions about the island's terrain and its little-known offshore island, Ie Shima. His answers were right on target as I knew these islands well, having been there myself with the 5th Air Force in World War II. For the incident itself at McGuire AFB, we have only Morse's word and his word only that it happened the way he described it, based on his recall of his own experience and observations. Other than the Incident/Complaint Report which produced names, no other person has responded to Morse's request for back-up testimony. One letter he addressed to another member of his unit on patrol went unanswered. Still another refused to surface to his request fearing for his career in the services. 'No way,' was the response. Additional details about the affair came bit by bit based on specific questions by phone and letter during 1984, which are broken down for simplicity into categories as follows: 1. The Humanoid Factor. At varying times during his patrol duty, Morse was within 40 to 70 feet from the prostrate body on the abandoned runway #5. Never close enough to observe details such as facial features or its hands and feet, Morse did recall that under the glare of truck headlights the skin of the unclad, hairless body was wet, shiny and snake-like. As reported in his initial letter, the entity was about 4 feet in height with large head, slender torso, thin arms and legs, and overall was of grayish-brown coloration. Unquestionably it was not human and was however of humanoid stature, fitting the anatomical description so often heard from military sources who have made claim to"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"having seen entities at crash sites and by a medical source who allegedly performed an autopsy on a specimen in the early 1950s. ( Note 5: See Case A7 in Status Report II , 1980, which includes letter from medical source describing in layman's terms his observation of alien specimen. See also analogous description by a former CIA person in Case A6, same report. Always pressing for more detail, I once proffered the notion that the McGuire corpse could have been that of a wild animal, a deer perhaps, or an escaped ape from a military experimentation lab, or a zoo. To this Morse replied, 'No zoo nearby. We did have a problem with deer on the runway, but no one ever made such a big fuss over a deer.' The only other anomaly that Morse attributed to the presence of the body was the strong smell of ammonia in the cold night air. I note here that the same odor also prevailed at the alleged crash site in Case A-2 of Status Report II. 2. UFO Reports. Morse, who never sighted a UFO before or after the incident, was among many on duty who witnessed the bluish-green lights flying high and in tight formation over the adjoining Ft. Dix-McGuire bases. And in the Incident/Complaint Report is the confirmation of their flight by the radar operator, A/1C R, on duty at the airbase control tower. Also, he had learned from the state trooper and later from his desk sergeant, WC, that one of the UFOs had come in at low level over the Ft. Dix MP's patrol car, causing temporary failure of his radio transmission. See below drawings of UFO flight formation and map of Ft. Dix-McGuire showing sites of shooting and location of body, based on sketches by Morse. December 14, 1983, Map of McGuire AFB and Ft. Dix Army Base, New Jersey, with Alien Body Sketch "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Although he never was able to see or talk with the Ft. Dix MP named JS, Morse did seek confirmation after his military service from the New Jersey State Police for their part in the incident. But he got nowhere and claimed the State Police would not cooperate. Also, attempts to locate the state trooper he met at Gate # 5 were futile. In this runaround, I recall Case A-8 in Status Report III where the police personnel involved in the 1966 Hillsdale-Dexter, Michigan, encounter were immediately transferred to new posts in the county and all records on their blotter regarding the incident were removed. My search for UFO reports coincidental to the January 18, 1978, event indicates that mainly in the eastern part of the U.S.A. there was no national flap and no concentration of sightings in the New Jersey area at that time. A check into the reports collected and evaluated in the International UFO Reporter (CUFOS) for that time period show that 82 reports (according to editor Allan Hendry) were judged to be 'unidentifiable or inappropriate.' However, five were selected for review in the March 1978 issue of International UFO Reporter. Those occurred in Toledo, Ohio on January 23, 1978; Williamston, North Carolina on January 27, 1978, Key West, Florida on January 27, 1978; Montvale, New Jersey on January 31, 1978; and Peoria, Illinois on February 5, 1978. The only case possibly akin to the Ft. Dix-McGuire encounter is the January 31 report in Montvale, New Jersey, which involved humanoids. This story was reported in the February 1978 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal with drawings of the entities, bearing little resemblance to the biped described by Morse. It was also fully reported in the April 1978 issue of the International UFO Reporter. Only because the encounter happened in New Jersey and within a reasonable time frame is it of relative interest. Another case occurring January 15, 1978, three days before the incident, involved a pilot, Roger K, and passengers flying in a Sundowner from Evansville, Indiana to Lunken Airport in Cincinnati, Ohio. I received the pilot's call who got my telephone number from the Control Tower, explaining that he had a harrowing experience 20 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky, at 5,500 feet when he observed two white lights. One was moving back and forth and the other was stationary. Watching the one object make a circle, he said that all of a sudden it headed for the Sundowner on a collision course. To escape its path, he dove 1,000 feet and watched the lights pass overhead and out of sight. Calling the Control Tower at Stanford Airport in Louisville, he heard they had received calls from people in the area who saw a UFO. In early January 1985, my hopes to get a back-up UFO report were heightened when a letter from Morse stated that he had traveled to Baldwinsville, New York, to see a friend retired from the U.S. Air Force, a former M/Sgt. HPS who had served in the 21st Air Force Headquarters at McGuire in the late 1970s. Morse said that he briefly mentioned the incident to HPS and learned that he recalled a night in 1978 when he took an urgent call from a C-141 pilot reporting a UFO while flying near McGuire. Morse said that HPS was vaguely aware of his incident and suggested I check further, giving me his address. I called HPS the day I got Morse's letter. HPS confirmed that he got the call from the pilot in 1978, which he said was 'quickly squelched.' But he could not pinpoint the date. 'Too long ago and I kept no records,' he said. He added, 'I don't recall a base alert, but the call I got from the pilot could have happened the same night of the other incident.' While on the phone, I asked HPS about Jeff as a person. 'He was always friendly. I lived with my family on the base and he would often stop by in his patrol car and play with the kids. We got to know him well.' HPS added that he had no reason to question his honesty or sincerity. In my opinion, had Morse been a shrewd hoaxer, he could have inveigled someone else into adding spicy details to the incident instead of HPS, who in all honesty, provided little of real substance to support his case. But my call was worth the cost. HPS vouched that Morse was at McGuire AFB in 1978 and that he was a likable person."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The most significant event of UFO activity, pinpointing the exact date of January 18, 1978, is a report I received from a police officer, Ron Jones, while on duty in Erlanger, Kentucky. His UFO was a large lime green, egg-shaped object that flew erratically across Kentucky skies. Other reports of a green object were also reported that night in northern Kentucky and into Cincinnati, including one coincidentally that flew low over the home of the Jones family. It caused a moment of terror. The story made big news on the local radio stations and in the headline of the Kentucky edition of the Cincinnati Post. S aturday, January 21, 1978, The Kentucky Post (regional edition of The Cincinnati Post. ) [ Editor's Note: Entire text of The Kentucky Post newspaper article by reporter, David W. Brown: \"The man in charge of reporting sightings of UFOs in northern Kentucky and Cincinnati says he believes the stories told by Erlanger Pd. Ronnie Jones and his niece. 'These are credible people. I have no reason to doubt that they saw an object in the sky that can't be explained,' said Leonard Stringfield. Stringfield of Marlemont, Ohio, a DuBois Chemical Co. official, was especially excited by the account of Melody Harris, 20, of 6960 Shenandoah, Florence. 'I would classify her experience as a Close Encounter of the First Kind,' he said, adding data he is collecting from Melody and Jones will be sent to the national Unidentified Flying Objects Research Center in Evanston, Illinois. (UFORC) For a technical reason, Jones's experience won't be classified as a Close Encounter. 'A Close Encounter of the First Kind must be within 500 feet and the object was apparently further away from the patrolman than that,' Stringfield said. Up Close 'But the girl is another story. She apparently saw it up close - it was just above her.' Jones says the flight of the UFO was erratic. He said on the face of a clock, it plotted a course from 3 o'clock to 9, up to 12, down to 6 - roughly making the figure of a numeral '4.' James E. Brown, 26 Franklin, Ft. Thomas, is sure he saw the same UFO while watching TV. 'I saw a flash out my living room window right before 9:30 p.m.,' said the 58-year-old Brown. 'It looked something like a shooting star, but much larger and differently shaped. I told my wife (Ellen), but she just laughed.' Brown, a barber in Campbell County for 27 years, said he thought people would think he was nuts if he reported the sighting. 'But after reading your story Friday, I'm convinced now I saw the real thing,' he told reporter Tim Stein. 'It had to be the same UFO because I saw it at the same time.' Jones's niece was playing in the snow outside her apartment with Jones's son, Ron II, 4, at roughly the same time. She described the object as green and in the shape of a light bulb. She estimated it was about (number not clear in reprinted newspaper article) feet above her and was the size of a car. 'Nothing to gain.' Melody said the object appeared to land somewhere in the vicinity of the Florence Drive-in, which is closed for the season. Stringfield said UFO landings are reported to him almost as often as sky sightings. 'This may sound strange,' Stringfield said, 'but these things do come in for touch landings quite often.' Story continued on Page 6: Stringfield believes in UFOs. He says he has seen one and has talked to many people whom he thinks also have had Close Encounters. At the same time, he says many reports aren't believable. 'That's why it's extremely important,' he says, 'to determine the credibility of the persons making the reports.' Stringfield says Pd. Jones is credible 'because he stands everything to lose, nothing to gain.' Jones has aid he has been ridiculed and laughed at since his sighting. He says he hopes to get more reports from persons who might have seen a green object in the sky Wednesday night. 'Sometimes it takes a few weeks for people to report these things. Often, people don't report them for obvious reasons of being laughed at.'"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Stringfield agrees with Jones and Melody that the object probably was not a plane. 'These people live near the airport. A plane would not frighten them. And don't forget that little boy cried. He was really scared.' Stringfield planned to interview Melody at length about her encounter Friday. He also was preparing for a tape session at his home for a program to be aired in the future by WLW-TV. Nine-year-old Lisa Purnell called The Kentucky Post late Friday night to report her sighting of the egg-like UFO. 'I was looking out the window around 10 p.m.,' said the Ockerman Elementary fourth grader. 'It was green, with flashing lights, and an antenna on top.' Lisa is the daughter of Edward and Uvonna Purnell, 28 Grand Avenue, Florence. Edward is a self-employed contractor.\"] Leonard Stringfield: Of pertinence in this event is that the UFO was green as were those observed by Morse. Despite a variance in shade perhaps, in my research green is among the least common of colors in the spectrum reported for UFOs. Most often reported is white, yellow, orange and red. Considering that Erlanger, south of Cincinnati, is as the crow flies a short hop for a UFO to New Jersey, the two events might be plausibly linked.\" Continued in Part 4 - Alien Retrieval Operation at Ft.
