Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 4: Unusual Animal Deaths - March 21st Walsenburg Cow © 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe “I think it’s something extraterrestrial. That’s all I can assume it could be – whether it’s a little green man or what, I don’t know. But I don’t believe that either human or animal as I know them could accomplish this (mutilation).” - J im Garren, Walsenburg Rancher T hree cattle mutilations discovered in southern Colorado between March 8 and March 21, 2009. The three sites form a triangle (yellow circles) on the map starting with We ston about a half-hour west of Trinidad, which was the 28-year-old cow found March 8, and probably killed on night of March 6, 2009, because she was seen alive March 6. Hoe hne is about 15 miles northeast of Trinidad, where 1-week-old calf was found eviscerated on morning of Tuesday, March 17, 2009, and known to be alive Monday afternoon, March 16, 2009. Third mutilation, a ranch about 12.5 miles southeast of Walse nburg (20 miles northwest of Hoehne) where 2.5-year-old heifer found Saturday morning, March 21, after giving birth to male calf Friday night, March 20. 2.5 -year-old English Angus and French Gelbvieh heifer crossbreed gave birth to calf Friday, March 20, 2009, and was found dead under juniper tree with udder removed without blood or milk fluids visible next morning, in Walsenburg, Colorado.

One of his Colorado ranches is twelve and a half miles southeast of Walsenburg and only about twenty miles from Tom Miller's ranch in Hoehne where the 1-week-old calf was found bloodlessly eviscerated on March 17, 2009. Three days later on Friday, March 20, 2009, Jim Garren's ranch helper, Tim Meyers, was checking on one of their 2.5-year-old heifers pregnant for the first time and late in giving birth. Jim has been crossbreeding pure bred Angus bulls and French Gelbvieh cows to produce a stronger, more muscular cow that has good marbling in its meat. The heifer was a healthy 1100-pounds, one of his best crossbreeds and Jim Garren was eager to see her first calf. During Friday night, it now appears she gave birth, licked her new male calf clean and he probably sucked his first colostrum “immune milk” that strengthens newborns. The mother had him hide under a juniper tree, flat to the ground - perhaps because she wanted to graze for more strength before returning to her newborn calf. Or perhaps, she sensed something dangerous. On Saturday morning, March 21, around 11 AM, Tim Meyers was feeding range cubes to the herd and realized the special, pregnant cow was missing. He went looking for her and found her dead. He called ranch owner Jim Garren in shock. Interview: Jim Garren, retired CPA and owner of ranch 12.5 miles southeast of Walsenburg and 20 miles from Hoehne: “He said, ‘Her bag is missing!' And I said, ‘What?' He said, ‘She doesn't have a bag, but there isn't any blood!’ (laughs) Ted didn't understand that and I couldn't either. So, we started making some calls. Tim called the sheriff in Las Animas County and he recommended we call the brand inspector. An hour or so later, the brand inspector joined Tim who took him to the site of the death. The two men looked all around the ground to see if they could determine what might have happened. They could not find any tracks. They could not find any blood. They did not see any trauma on the cow. About 5 PM Saturday afternoon, March 21, 2009, they were walking circles around the area where we found the cow and lo and behold, we found the baby calf hid out under a tree. The calf had been cleaned up, which a cow does after birth. The placenta afterbirth was not too far from the calf and had completely dried up. The calf was bawling and in apparent good health. So, Ted took the calf and we have some milk supplements we are able to give the calves and he fed the newborn male. He’s eating it and to this day, he’s eating the heck out of that supplement and growing good. So, we believe from that, the calf had sucked the mother and got his first colostrum (first “immune milk”), or else he would have died. So, we believe she had nursed the calf before her death and the mutilated mother was found about 50 yards away from where we found the calf. THAT MEANS THE COW GAVE BIRTH SOME TIME IN THE NIGHT FROM FRIDAY, MARCH 20, TO SATURDAY, MARCH 21, AND APPARENTLY LICKED THE CALF CLEAN AND FED HIM. THEN AFTER THAT, COMES THIS TERRIBLE THING THAT TAKES AWAY HER UDDER AND KILLS HER. That’s my supposition and I believe that to be right because of the attitude and ab ility of this calf. He is doing real good and you would not expect a calf that never got the first colostrum from the mother to do that well. No Unusual Tracks or Signs of Struggle At Calf and Heifer Sites COULD YOU DESCRIBE BOTH GROUND SCENES AROUND THE CALF AND HEIFER? Well, where the calf was found, a few yards away from the calf, we found the afterbirth that the mother had sloughed off. We saw tracks of the mother cow. We didn’t see any other tracks at all. The calf was more or less underneath a juniper tree. There was no disturbance other than the afterbirth being close by. We did see one little spot of blood, but"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I think that’s where the cow had laid when she gave birth to the calf. THAT WAS CLOSE TO THE CALF UNDER THE JUNIPER TREE? Yes, pretty close. Not right in the same spot, but reasonably close. What I’m saying happened is that the calf was probably born there, was cleaned up there, and there was some blood there from the mother – which is natural – and then I think the calf got up and nursed and I think the mother hid the calf underneath the branches of the juniper tree. Then around the mother, she was also under a juniper tree, although the branches were about three feet above her. The only blood I saw was a little on her hind leg that would be consistent with her dropping, sloughing off, the afterbirth. It was dry and caked and normally a cow will have some blood on her legs from that. Saturday Morning, March 21, 2009, Photos by Rancher No Evidence of Natural Predators Around where the udder had been removed, I could find no traces of blood at all. The cuts were just perfect. They were bigger than the actual udder would have been and they just cut the hide and pulled the udder out. What is left is just some tallow – she was a good, fat heifer – and some raw meat (muscle). But none of that has been cut! Her stomach had never been torn open. Her rectum had not been torn open. 2.5 -year-old English Angus and French Gelbvieh heifer crossbreed as she was found beneath a juniper tree with udder bloodlessly removed, vaginal tissues reddened and expanded from having given birth earlier Friday night, March 20, 2009, to male calf.

Her head – I could not find any signs of trauma, which you would look for if a lion had killed her or something like that. I could not see where her feet had moved the ground in any fashion. She was laying on her left side and her feet/legs were sticking straight out front and back. Under a normal tranquilization or attack, a cow will move her feet before she goes under. Nothing! I could not see any sign she ever moved her feet at all. T ongue, eyes and ears intact on 2.5-year-old English Angus and French Gelbvieh heifer crossbreed .

We couldn’t feel any holes or outside entry points (for bullets) to indicate she had been shot, but I don’t believe there is a human alive that could cut that udder off that cleanly without spilling some blood. ESPECIALLY IF SHE WAS PREGNANT AND HAD JUST GIVEN BIRTH AND THAT UDDER SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENGORGED WITH MILK AND BLOOD. The udder would have been plumb full of milk. AND THERE WAS NO FLUID? No fluid. There was not a wet spot on the ground. We circled all around looking for anything we could find, like a bare spot where grass had been killed or whatever. We made several circles around at least as far as 50 yards out because we went that far where we found the calf. There were four of us doing that and no one has seen any tracks or anything other than cow tracks.

I WONDERED IF EVEN THAT IS NORMAL THAT BIRDS OR OTHER PREDATORS HAVE NOT REALLY DONE ANYTHING TO HER BODY SINCE FRIDAY NIGHT? Well, my experience with dead cows – and we have had some in the past with poison weeds. My experience is that shortly after they die, the crows will peck their eyes out and a coyote will tear out the rectum. Now, as of Saturday evening (March 21, 2009), none of that had happened. We went back out there on Sunday, March 22, 2009, about 9:30 AM, and the right eye was still intact (cow was laying on left side with right side of face skyward). That tells me crows never got on her. But, a coyote had eaten out her rectum. So, there was a pretty good hole in there on Sunday. It was not there on the first photographs that we took on Saturday, the rectal skin had not been broken.

THE MOTHER IS LYING 50 YARDS AWAY FROM HER NEWBORN ON HER LEFT SIDE WITH NO APPARENT SIGNS OF STRUGGLE, NO TRACKS, NO BLOOD AROUND THE EXCISIOIN OF THE BIG UDDER THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ENGORGED WITH MILK AND BLOOD. MY QUESTION IS: WHATEVER CAME"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"FOR THE MOTHER, WHY WOULDN’T IT HAVE GONE AFTER THE NEWBORN CALF AS WELL? I can’t answer that. It puzzled us, too, except that I’ve observed over the years that when a cow – particularly after she has just had a calf and the calf has had its first nursing – will do what we call ‘hide a calf.’ The mother cow will pick a spot and the calf will lay down and the calf will not raise its head, it will not move. It virtually is invisible. That’s the nature of the cow and that’s the way we found the newborn calf. The way we found him actually was that Tim’s wife heard it bawl and I suspect it was getting hungry and was bawling for the mother, which under normal circumstances, after a calf has eaten, it won’t bawl, it won’t move, it will just lay as flush to the ground as it can lay. That’s the nature of the mother cow protecting the newborn calf. Normally, the mother will stay pretty close to the newborn and she usually will get some help from another cow to baby sit when she needs to go get some water and that sort of thing. How the cows communicate all of that, I can’t tell you, but that’s what we have observed. Maybe the cow was possibly out away from the calf grazing when her death occurred. IS THIS YOUR FIRST MUTILATION ON THIS PARTICULAR RANCH SOUTH OF WA L SE N B UR G ? Ye s . HAD YOU EVER HAD ANIMAL MUTILATIONS ANYWHERE ELSE YOU HAVE RANCHED? No, I have not. This was my first. WHAT IS YOUR REACTION? Well, I’m sickened because I put in a lot of effort to raise these particular heifers through the genetics I am using to grow them and I have some theories that I’ve exercised about how fast I breed them. And this mother cow was just perfect, all ten of the special cows were just perfect. I just hate like heck to lose one like that! Her calf was approximately 80 pounds and he was just in super health and super strong for just being as young as he was. That’s the way all of these heifers calves are. So, I’m having great expectations for the production of this animal I’m developing, so I’m very sad that I lost her. WHAT WAS HER ESTIMATED WEIGHT AT DEATH? When she was preg-checked on October 21, 2008, she weighed 1,070 pounds. So, I’m guessing that at the time of her death, she weighed about 1100 pounds. The combination of the cow and calf were worth at least $1,250. She was a very classy-looking cow. But I can't afford mortality insurance, so it's pure loss. Who? or What? Killed and Mutilated Walsenburg Heifer? “I think it’s something extraterrestrial. That’s all I can assume it could be – whether it’s a little green man or what, I don’t know. But I don’t believe that either human or animal as I know them could accomplish this (mutilation).” - Jim Garren, Rancher My own impression today is that the cutting off of the udder, I don’t believe there is a human alive that could cut it that cleanly and not cause some blood to flow. I just don’t think it’s possible. A second observation I had was that I don’t see how an animal or human could cause that cow to die as big and strong and young as she was without tearing up, or having some marks visible on the ground. I don’t believe there is a man or horse alive that could have roped her and made her go down without showing some signs of the struggle. I certainly don’t believe it was an animal because we have lost cattle – mostly calves to lions – and to what we believe were coyotes – and in all cases, meat was eaten, the lion ate into the calf stomachs to get its dinner and the coyotes go through the rectum to get to theirs. None of that was on my cow on Saturday. So, I have to eliminate animals as I know what they do and I’ve kind of got to eliminate man because I don’t think there is any way that could happen. We don’t have any electricity on the ranch. There are no signs or tracks. We’re so remote, it would have been virtually impossible for someone to have"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"walked to where this happened. You could have got there on horse back – we do that all the time – but we found no horse tracks at all. I think it’s something extraterrestrial.

Beam Technology? G reeley Tribune, Greeley, Colorado, Sunday, November 2, 1980, article by Bill Jackson, Tribune Staff Writer, entitled: “Mutilations - Predators ... or UFOs? What's the answer?” EYEWITNESSES HAVE DESCRIBED SEEING BEAMS COME DOWN FROM THE SKY INTO PASTURES – AND I HAVE HALF A DOZEN EYEWITNESSES WHO SAY THEY HAVE SEEN ANIMALS RISE IN THESE BEAMS AND OTHERS HAVE SEEN ANIMALS DROPPED TO THE GROUND FROM THE BEAMS, OR PLACED ON THE GROUND BY THESE BEAMS. WHAT IS THIS BEAM TECHNOLOGY, I DON’T KNOW, BUT THE BEAM TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANIMAL MUTILATION PHENOMENON AROUND THE WORLD FOR AT LEAST HALF A CENTURY. THAT WOULD AT LEAST EXPLAIN HOW YOUR WONDERFUL COW MIGHT HAVE BEEN SELECTIVELY TAKEN VERTICALLY FROM THE PASTURE AND THEN RETURNED VERTICALLY. Yeah, that would explain why we don’t see any tracks or signs. Of course, if the surgery was done somewhere other than where she was at (when taken), that would explain why we don’t see any blood. RIGHT. I’ve talked with some of the neighbors and Tim has talked to quite a few of our neighbors. I have a couple of partners that partner on some cattle with me and I’ve talked with them. And I’ve talked with some veterinarians. Really, no one has a clue! (laughs) They just say, ‘I can’t believe it.’ DOES ANYBODY BRING UP THE POSSIBILITY OF SOMETHING FROM OUTER SPACE? Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Most of them say it’s got to be something that we don’t know what it’s about. WHEN PEOPLE SPECULATE AND CONTEMPLATE SOMETHING EXTRATERRESTRIAL FROM OUTER SPACE, WHAT DO THEY SAY TO YOU? Basically, they say it’s technologically above our ability to understand it and shrug their shoulders and say, ‘I don’t understand it, but it has to be something like that that could accomplish what happened without leaving any signs or traces.’ HAVE ANY OF YOUR NEIGHBOR AROUND YOUR RANCH SOUTH OF WALSENBURG HAD ANY ANIMAL MUTILATIONS IN THE LAST YEAR OR TWO? The closest one would be this Tom Miller that you’re talking about. IN HOEHNE, COLORADO."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Yes, Hoehne is probably 20 miles from our ranch. I don’t know Mr. Miller and could not call him my neighbor, but that’s the closest of anyone I know of. WHEN YOU SAW THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT CHUCK ZUKOWSKI TOOK OF THE 1-WEEK-OLD CALF LAYED OUT ON TOM MILLER’S FLATBED TRUCK, WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST REACTION AND THOUGHT? I just could not understand it. I mean, I just saw a head and front legs and two hind legs with a gap in the middle – that’s what I saw. I could not understand. There wasn’t even any hide between the head and the hind legs. I’ve never seen anything like it.” O n Tuesday morni ng, March 17, rancher Tom Mi l ler picked up the strangely mutilated, bloodless carcass of a 1-week-old male calf from beside the feed bin and placed what was left of the body on his flatbed truck, shown above.

F rom the Hoehne 1-week-old calf above, investigator Chuck Zukowski cut out both unusual ear excisions and hand-delivered to the Colorado State University Veterinarian Diagnostic Laboratory for analysis. Final test results pending. Chuck did not sample tissue from the Jim Garren mutilated heifer near Walsenburg on Sunday, March 22, because too much time had elapsed since her death on Friday night, March 20, 2009. Historically, when there have been animal mutilations in one geographic region, there might be several more over the next few months.
