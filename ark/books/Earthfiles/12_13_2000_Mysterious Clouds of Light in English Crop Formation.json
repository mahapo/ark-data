Photograph © 1994 by Chad Deetken. The following is an excerpt from the new book Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles © 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe: \"On August 3-4, 1994, Werner Anderhub from Bern, Switzerland and a friend decided to visit a crop formation at midnight several days after it had been discovered on July 23rd. Researchers called it the \"Galaxy\" at West Stowell, a little east of Alton Barnes Inside Galaxy formation at West Stowell, Wiltshire after its discovery on July 23, 1994. Photograph © 1994 by Chad Deetken. \"As the two men entered at the southeastern corner of the field about 150 meters from the Galaxy, a very large and bright light seemed to come from the ground inside the crop formation and rise into the sky. Werner told Bert Janssen and Janet Ossebaard in their 1999 documentary Crop Circles, The Research, \"It was so bright, it lit up the hills in the background. It was bluish-white in color and about as big as the formation, fifty to sixty meters wide. The bright light formed some sort of cloud and it changed shape continuously as it hovered over the formation. After a couple of seconds, it rose at slow speed and disappeared into the darkness. My friend and I were totally flabbergasted!\" Drawing by Werner Anderhub for Linda Howe © 2000 with this note: \"The five sequences of the light encounters began all in the same way as a fluid light came out of the Galaxy, forming a cloud above the field, stayed there for several seconds, moved slowly up into the sky, and then disintegrated into nothing visible.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"The 'cloud' disintegrated by moving up into the sky and lighted up the Vale of Pewsey. We could easily see the Golden Ball Hill with its bushes and sheep. Please note this was not a UFO. I have seen those. This was a totally different event.\" Drawing by Werner Anderhub for Linda Howe © 2000. \"As we stood in the dark night, a second light emerged from the formation, repeating exactly the same action and movement as the first one. And after about a minute, there was a third light. And then a fourth light appeared. This fourth one did not just form a cloud. It formed a perfect rectangular shape, like a big shoe box hovering only a few meters above the wheat and measuring five by twenty by sixty meters. It was transparent like a jelly fish. And it didn't just hang there. It started to float towards us. At that point, my friend began to get really scared and wanted to run away, but I asked him not to go. At that instant, the light stopped. It floated back towards the formation where it transformed into another cloud and moved slowly up into the dark sky. \"After the fourth 'light cloud' was formed above the Galaxy formation, in an instant that light cloud became the form of a 'shoe box' hanging over the field for awhile. Then it moved slowly in our direction.\" Drawing by Werner Anderhub for Linda Howe © 2000. \"At that point, two other friends arrived and a fifth light emerged from the formation, forming another bright cloud that hovered for a couple of seconds after which it moved upward and disappeared into the sky. We had witnessed something that could not be easily explained. What struck us most was the strange rectangular box, how it approached us and then how it left when my friend got really scared. It was as if the light were intelligent, or guided by an intelligence.\" More Information:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The above excerpt is from Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles - 1st Edition © 2000 and Updated 2nd Edition © 2002, expanded to 400 pages with more photographs, including the Gog and Magog Hills and Chilbolton formations of 2001.
