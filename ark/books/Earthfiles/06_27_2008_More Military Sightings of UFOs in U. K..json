Map © 2008 by The Sun. June 27, 2008 Shropshire and Bromsgrove, United Kingdom - On Friday, June 20, 2008, only a few days ago, a 29-year-old British woman named Bonnie Lewis from Bromsgrove, Worcestershire, was walking her dog when she saw four spinning, multi- colored cylinders in the sky, which astonished Bonnie. She grabbed her cell phone and "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"took video of the spinning cylinders. Bonnie contacted authorities about her videotape and told reporters, “They weren’t from this world. They made no sound and had flashing dots inside.” Then on Wednesday, June 25th, the U. K. Sun newspaper headlined in huge letters, “Army Spot UFOs Over Shropshire.” The story was that on Saturday, June 7th, a little after 11 PM local time, at Tern Hill barracks near Market Drayton, Shropshire, Corporal Mark Proctor of the 1st Battalion Irish Regiment, videotaped two of thirteen zig-zagging, unidentified aerial objects on his cell phone. Only two hours later on June 8th, at 12:40 AM local British summertime, helicopter police officers reported a near-collision with a huge disc-shaped aerial craft near Cardiff, 80 miles away from the Tern Hill barracks. And that near-collision between a disc and the helicopter police had been the biggest U. K. story of 2008 – until now as more and more sightings are being reported. One man who has been at the forefront of the British UFO investigation scene began his research in 1991 to 1994 officially, when he held the job of Secretariat Air Staff 2a at the Ministry of Defence in London. Nick Pope went right from high school into government service at age 20 back in 1985. He retired from the M.O. D. in 2006 and has been pursuing answers to the UFO mystery on his own. Because of his Ministry of Defence background with UFO investigations, he is often called in on cases – including this week when the Sun asked him and reporters to go to the Sun editorial offices to screen the Tern Hill barracks and Bonnie Lewis videotapes. I called Nick to find out what he has been learning and what he saw with his own eyes on the cell phone videotapes. Interview: Nick Pope, former U. K. Ministry of Defence Secretariat Air Staff 2a, now independent investigator of the unidentified aerial phenomenon, London, England: “The military sighting was taken by three soldiers on guard patrol on a military base here in the U. K. They got it on their cell phone. They had the presence of mind to do that. There were a number of objects. Looking at the color there, it looked like a blue-white light, which is interesting. Again, it’s not the standard color of anti-collision lights on aircraft. Clearly you can hear – I don’t know if they kept the soundtrack on (the web), but you can hear some colorful language. ARE THEY SAYING, ‘WHAT THE --- IS THIS?’ Absolutely, they are! WHAT WERE YOU SEEING WITH YOUR OWN EYES AS YOU WATCHED THAT CELL PHONE VIDEO? I was seeing blue-white lights hanging directly over the military base. These things seemed to be spinning. It sounds extraordinary, but they seemed to be rotating on their own axis. They seemed to be cube or cylindrical-shaped objects flashing through many different colors of the spectrum. But appearing as blue-white lights (thirteen were counted). THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CUBE AND A CYLINDER. BONNIE LEWIS WAS CLEARLY VIDEOTAPING VERTICAL CYLINDERS. Ye s . HOW WOULD YOU COMPARE WHAT YOU SAW IN THE MILITARY FOOTAGE FROM TERN HILL TO A CUBE OR CYLINDER? WHICH IS CLOSEST? Bonnie Lewis’s footage is more cylindrical shaped. Looking at what she’s captured, those lights seem to be pink. Pink is the predominant color. Of course, that’s interesting in itself because these are not colors you see in aircraft and collision lights. So, Bonnie Lewis’s Bromsgrove footage from Friday, June 20th, seems to be pink, cylindrical-shaped objects. Corporal Mark Proctor and his two colleagues – the footage that they captured on June 7 seems to be more blue-white and seems to be more cube-shaped. There may or may not be a connection in this. We don’t know. That’s one of the reasons why I’ve called for a full, official inquiry. Police Helicopter Nearly Collides with Disc-Shaped Aerial Craft Near Cardiff"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"June 8, 12:40 AM (2 hours after Tern Hill spinning cubes) O n June 8, 2008, at 1240 BST (40 minutes after midnight, British Summer Time), a police Eurocopter was returning to the Ministry of Defence military base at St. Athan, near Cardiff, Wales. The helicopter crew of three were hovering at 500 feet, waiting for clearance to land, when a “flying saucer-shaped” aerial craft came rapidly on a collision course with the helicopter. The pilot swerved away and gave chase of the UFO as far as the North Devon coast before running low on fuel, which forced the police helicopter to return to the St. Athan military base. Graphic images © 2008 by Telegraph News and Wales Online. Nick Pope: “But the other important point here is that what started this whole story was the spectacular near-miss between a police helicopter coming into land at an air force base, RAF St. Athan, near Cardiff, Wales. I think the Tern Hill footage was 11 PM on Saturday, June 7, whereas the near miss with the police helicopter was about 12:40 AM on the Sunday, June 8, on or about the same time just after midnight, 12:40 AM. IF IT’S 12:40 AM ON SUNDAY AND THE TERN HILL BARRACKS VIDEO IS AROUND 11 PM SATURDAY, WE’RE STILL TALKING ABOUT ONLY TWO HOURS LATER THAT THE NEAR COLLISION TOOK PLACE. Exactly, yes. And I believe that there needs to be an inquiry, probably led by the Ministry of Defence but also involving the civil aviation authority, our equivalent of the FAA. The reason I say that is when you have a near-collision between a helicopter and a UFO, whatever one believes about UFOs, one has to accept there is a flight safety issue here. So, I called for an official inquiry and that call has been picked up by much of the media here in the U. K. What Should U. K. Government Do To Investigate June 2008 UFO Events? WHAT WILL THE GOVERNMENT DO? Well, I think the government needs to do four things: Firstly, they need to actually confirm they will launch an official inquiry and make their findings public because there is a huge interest and concern about this in the United Kingdom. After the investigation itself, I think three things need to happen: Firstly, they need to interview all the witnesses – the personnel onboard the police helicopter and the military personnel who took the cell phone video at the military barracks and all the other members of the public who have reported. So, they need to interview the witnesses. Secondly, they need to analyze all the still photographs and the videos that have been taken – and there are many of those. We have been discussing a few of them, but many more have been sent to the Sun today because they asked if anyone else had seen it and requested footage be sent in. Obviously, the Ministry of Defence has all sorts of technical specialists and equipment expertise to enable them to enhance and analyze the imagery. That’s something that can be done. Critically, the third thing is radar. We need to urgently look at the radar tapes from all the civil airports and military bases to see if anything unusual was tracked."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I think if all these things are done together, we can have a meaningful inquiry and find out what on Earth is going on in our air space in the U. K. What Provoked So Much UFO Activity On June 7, 2008 [ See Websites below] WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING AROUND THE WORLD ON JUNE 7TH BECAUSE IN THE UNITED STATES, IT TURNS OUT THAT PHENOMENA- GATHERING WEBSITES HAVE MANY REPORTS FROM THIS COUNTRY. Well, you’ve just made a really interesting point. It’s always been a concern of mine that investigations of UFOs have been carried out on a very narrow nationalistic way. Of course, actually one needs to look at the wider picture and it just seems to me about what you just said – here in Britain we have a part of the puzzle. Here in Britain we have a piece of the puzzle. Maybe there are other countries that have had sightings, too, on the same June 7 to 8 dates. WERE YOU ABLE TO INTERVIEW ANY OF THE THREE MEN – THE PILOT OR OTHER TWO – THAT WERE IN THE POLICE HELICOPTER OUT OF SOUTH WALES ON THE EARLY MORNING OF JUNE 8, 2008, THAT HAD A NEAR-COLLISION WITH WHAT THEY SAID WAS A DISC-SHAPED AERIAL CRAFT? No, I have not yet managed to do that. It’s very interesting that when this story broke, we heard that there had been this near-collision. Then the story was that the helicopter – because these people were police officers and because there had been this near-collision – the police gave chase. They wanted to find out who? or what? had nearly blown them out of the sky. But within about a day of that, the story had slightly changed and was being downplayed. While the police confirmed the incident had taken place and yes, the three people on the helicopter had seen a UFO, they denied that a chase had ensued. They started using the phrase ‘unusual aircraft.’ That is odd. I’m not saying there is a cover-up here, but it does seem at the very least that this story has been downplayed. “These People” and “Extraterrestrial Biological Entities” WELL, NICK, YOU AND I CERTAINLY HAVE ENCOUNTERED WHAT IS CALLED ‘MUDDYING THE WATERS’ AFTER TRUE EVENTS IN WHICH THERE HAVE BEEN PHENOMENA DESCRIBED BY MILITARY OR CIVILIAN IN WHICH THE STORY BEGINS TO HAVE DETAILS ADDED AND CHANGED. EVENTUALLY, YOU REALIZE THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT A REAL PHENOMENON AND THEY COME IN WITH THESE MISINFORMATION EXPLANATIONS. SO, THEY ARE COVER-UPS, FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, BECAUSE IN YOUR COUNTRY AND MY COUNTRY – I’LL CALL IT WHAT OUR GOVERNMENT HAS IN ITS OWN DOCUMENTS: ‘EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITY’ PHENOMENON THAT IS STILL CLASSIFIED IN A POLICY OF DENIAL IN THE INTEREST OF NATIONAL SECURITY. Well, here in the U. K., we don’t use the phrase, ‘extraterrestrial biological entities.’ But some colleagues and I used a rather amusing phrase. It’s very British, very sort of sober and serious. But I heard in an official briefing on the UFO phenomenon use the phrase, ‘these people.’ (laughs) And I remember my very skeptical boss coming out of a meeting once, coming out of a (UFO) briefing, and saying to me on the way back to our own office. He said to me, ‘Nick, that was an interesting briefing. But what did they mean when they kept saying, ‘these people’? Who are ‘these people’? NICK, YOU INTERPRETED THAT TO BE A COVER WORD FOR WHAT PRECISELY IN YOUR OWN HEAD? The officials giving us the briefing – and these were people on the Defence Intelligence staff – were clearly, clearly speculating about extraterrestrials."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"YES, AND I WONDERED IF IN YOUR M.O.D. WORK, DID ANYBODY ON OR OFF THE RECORD IN A BRIEFING OR OUTSIDE OF A BRIEFING, SAY TO YOU VERY SPECIFICALLY, ‘WE ARE DEALING WITH OTHER INTELLIGENCES FROM OTHER SOLAR SYSTEMS IN THIS UNIVERSE?’ No, they didn’t. But, having said that, while there was no direct confirmation of that, there was certainly speculative discussion. Certainly there were a number of people, including those at very senior levels in government and military, who were prepared to entertain that possibility and were prepared to say that on the basis of some of the things in the M. O. D.’s UFO file that that might be one explanation. So, the way I characterize this is that I say that I see no proof of this, but I have seen some intriguing evidence – some very serious players in government who were talking about this and believed in it. THE BRITISH ARE USING WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A PSEUDONYM CALLED ‘THESE PEOPLE’ FOR WHAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS IN CLASSIFIED AND LEAKED DOCUMENTS WRITTEN OUT AS ‘EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES.’ Yes. I mean, I’ve heard a number of different phrases. I’ve heard ‘E.B.E.s,’ ‘extraterrestrial biological entities.’ I’ve heard ‘the visitors.’ I’ve heard ‘the children’ even. There are all sorts of bizarre euphemisms and code names – but yes, the phrase we tended to use in England was just ‘these people.’ NICK, WHERE DO YOU THINK THIS IS HEADED? I don’t know, but it’s extremely interesting. In all my time having been involved in this subject officially, and then privately after I left government, I don’t think I can recall a time when this subject has generated quite as much mainstream media coverage as it has at the moment. We’ve seen the story about the release of M.O.D. UFO files, which happened last month. this was again global coverage, including shows like Larry King Live and in most of the mainstream newspapers and TV stations. I SAW SOME OF THAT COVERAGE AND SAW SOME OF YOUR INTERVIEWS AND I CAME AWAY WITH THE IMPRESSION AS AN INVESTIGATIVE REPORTER MYSELF THAT NOTHING NEW HAD BEEN RELEASED IN THAT FIRST M. O. D. BATCH OF DOCUMENTS. What conspiracy theorists have suggested is that the M. O. D. deliberately picked the most unexciting, mundane files to release. There were about 2,000 pages of documentation and several hundred UFO cases – probably no more than half a dozen interesting ones. But they were in there, but you had to look for them. Most of the released files misidentifications of aircraft lights, satellites, meteors, stars and planets. But there were UFOs tracked on radar, seen by commercial airline pilots, that sort of thing. But the other interesting thing that happened recently was the statement by the chief astronomer at the vatican. THAT IT WOULD NOT BE A THREAT TO THE CATHOLIC CHURCH’S CONCEPT OF THEIR HOLY FATHER IF THERE IS OTHER LIFE IN THE UNIVERSE. THAT WAS A MAJOR PHILOSOPHICAL CHANGE. It was. If there is confirmation of an extraterrestrial presence, however that comes – whether there is a landing, or picking up of a signal through radio astronomy – it doesn’t matter. One could say the Catholic Church is just trying to cover all the bases. WHY IS THE M. O.D. GOING TO TAKE THREE YEARS TO RELEASE THE UFO FILES? Because there are so many of them. The Ministry of Defence has received, since the 1950s when we started looking at this, over 11,000 UFO reports. So, there are tens of thousands of document pages. And it’s not just the UFO sightings, but it’s policy papers, correspondence with the public, media inquiries. There is so much material that it’s a massive job (to release it). BUT, NICK, DON’T YOU THINK IT’S FAIR TO SPECULATE THAT NOTHING THAT IS TRULY SERIOUS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND THE U. K. IS BEING RELEASED – ONLY THOSE DOCUMENTS THAT THEY CONSIDER NOT TO BE A THREAT TO THEIR POLICIES OF DENIAL IN THE INTEREST OF NATIONAL SECURITY."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I don’t know. I honestly don’t know. I think that certainly when I was doing the UFO job, I attempted to make contact with my opposite number in the U. S. and I was simply given the party line: ‘We closed down Project Blue Book in 1969. We are no longer interested in this.’ Well, that did not satisfy me, but that’s as far as I got. AND IT WOULD NOT SATISFY ANY OF US WHO HAVE HAD FACE-TO-FACE WITH PEOPLE OFF THE RECORD IN THE MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE IN THE UNITED STATES WHO KNOW A GREAT DEAL ABOUT NON-HUMANS INTERACTING WITH OUR PLANET.
