Beyond Tulio's farm are more mesas. All the rock outcroppings and soil are rich with red iron. Photograph © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe. Tulio Costa and his family have lived on their Corguinho farm for 24 years and have seen many mysterious lights rise from the ground, move around in the air, disappear inside the big mesa and come back out again. On November 24, 2001, after a day of many strange lights over his farm, Tulio and others saw a large light explode above the mesa. Map sketch by Tulio and Linda Moulton Howe.

March 8, 2003 Corguinho, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil - On November 24, 2001, a farmer named Tulio Alves Costa who has lived on the eastern side of Corguinho, Brazil's big mesa for twenty-four years, saw mysterious, bright, white lights he estimates were about six inches long move in the air over his land throughout the day. Eventually after sunset, at least one of the small lights grew very large. Tulio, not understanding what was happening, called his friend Urandir Oliveira on the other side of the mesa to come see. Urandir and several others from the farm arrived when it was dark and could clearly see the large, glowing white light. At 8:30 p.m., the light kept expanding and seemed to explode near the eastern slope of the mesa above Tulio's farm. The next day, the group made the rough climb with machetes up the steep side of the mesa toward the area they estimated the light had exploded. Eventually, amid the humid, tropical plants, they found a tree broken in two. The fallen section was smoldering from the inside of the trunk. Tulio, Urandir and the rest of the group - including an American scientist originally from Brazil - all began to itch, felt nauseous and their eyes reddened and teared so much that they left the land. Tulio waited several days before trying to return with Urandir, Felipe Branco, and the American scientist who requests anonymity, but has confirmed he was there, found radioactivity and has continued to research the explosion site over the past year. Plants around the broken tree were scorched, insects and mushrooms were suddenly a red color not seen before, three of Tulio's calves and a cow died and two other calves went blind.

Tulio Alves Costa, Farm Owner for 24 years, Eastern Side of Corguinho's Big Mesa, describing light explosion on November 24, 2001, at 8:30 p.m., Corguinho, M.G., Brazil. Translators: Luciano Didier and Felipe Branco on February 15, 2003: \" As long as Tulio has been on his farm, there has always been some manifestation of strange lights and phenomena. And on this date (November 24, 2001), and a few days before, there were some small lights appearing on his farm during the day. COLOR? Very bright, white lights. He did not know what they were."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHAT WERE THE SIZE? Small ones, about this size. (Tulio held up his hands and made an oval about 6 inches in diameter.) LIKE EGGS? No, like circles. They were far away, so maybe they were actually bigger in physical size, but he's showing how they appeared to him from where he was working on the farm. He knew that something was increasing beyond his knowledge and he was scared about what was going on, so he called Urandir. (Oliveira at his farm about 10 kilometers from Tulio's farm on the western side of the big mesa.) WERE THE LIGHTS DIFFERENT COLORS? There were several different colors: violet, golden. Changing colors constantly. LIKE PULSING LIGHTS? No, very still, not pulsating, and suddenly one opens with a very bright color as if the light spreads and then like an explosion, but NO SOUND. Like a light expanding outwards very quickly. HOW BIG? He cannot calculate, more than 15 meters. IS IT HIGH IN THE SKY OR LOW? High in the sky, a good height. SO THIS IS A LIGHT THAT IS MORE DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING HE HAS SEEN IN THE PAST? It was the biggest, the size, he had never seen anything so big. It expanded, this big bright light, and then exploded and disappeared. WHERE IT EXPLODED WAS, TO HIS EYES, OVER WHERE WE CLIMBED UP YESTERDAY? Exactly there where we climbed. The next day they tried to get close to the area, but they couldn't because there was too much radiation. SO YOU SAW THE EXPLOSION AND IT'S NIGHT AND YOU COULD NOT CLIMB UP THERE IN THE DARK? Right. Our February 14, 2003, long, steep, hike up the east side of the big Corguinho mesa into the thick forest to collect physical evidence where a tree broke in two after the large light exploded silently at 8:30 p.m. on November 24, 2001.

Photograph © 2003 Linda Moulton Howe. YOU WAITED UNTIL THE NEXT DAY AND WHAT HAPPENED? It was around 2 p.m., Tulio and everyone tried to walk up on the mesa to where they estimated the light had exploded. After three hours, the group finally found the broken, or exploded, tree but they became worried about radiation. HEAT? No, tingling and scratching over the whole body, itching like an allergy. The body became red and irritated and the eyes were like crying. And the baby cattle went blind and some died. HOW MANY DIED? Four, three baby cattle and one cow. And two went blind. THE SCIENTIST CONFIRMED RADIOACTIVITY? Ye s . HOW LONG DID IT TAKE FROM NOVEMBER 24 UNTIL THEY COULD GO THERE AND NOT HAVE BURNING EYES? 12 days. WAS THE BROKEN TREE THEN WARM TO TOUCH? No, no heat. Above, the shattered tree trunk still rooted in the mesa soil. Below, the section of the tree that fell onto plants several feet below and burned inside for approximately 4 feet 9 inches, but there was no evidence of burning on the outside of the fallen trunk on February 14, 2003.

DID ANYBODY SEE ANY SMOKE OR STEAM COMING OUT OF THE"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"GROUND ON NOVEMBER 25 WHEN THEY TRIED TO GET THERE? No. No smoke. \" During the interview with Tulio, Urandir Oliveira arrived after working on a farm irrigation problem and added his comments as an eyewitness on November 24, 2001. Urandir Oliveira, Farmer, Ecovila, Corguinho, M.G., Brazil: \"First, we wanted to make sure it was not a meteor. But meteors don't keep flying in the sky. And it could be a piece of a satellite. But then when they realized the red mushrooms, the measured radioactivity, the cattle blind and dead, so they knew it was not a piece of a satellite. THE RED MUSHROOMS SHOWED UP HOW LONG AFTER NOVEMBER 24? 4 or 6 days, about a week. Red mushrooms still growing on February 14, 2003, in the vicinity of the November 24, 2001, exploded tree.

HAD TULIO OR URANDIR EVER SEEN RED MUSHROOMS IN CORGUINHO BEFORE? No. And the insects were also red. They killed them. WHERE WERE THE INSECTS? Some were taken to the (American scientist's lab for analysis. Results and photos will be upcoming.) HOW LONG DID INSECTS STAY RED THERE? They could see this strange influence on insects for about a week. SINCE NOVEMBER 24, 2001, HOW MANY MORE LIGHTS HAVE COME AROUND TULIO'S FARM?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"About four or five times more. Right at the same mountain where we were yesterday. He saw lights again in November 2002. DO THE LIGHTS HAVE A SPECIFIC SHAPE? Round. The particular one that caught Tulio's attention was quite remarkable because at first he thought it was the light of a car and he was thinking there was someone with a car approaching. Then this light became much bigger and stopped moving low to the ground and went up to the sky and then went up the side of the mesa and it was really bright and very big. Huge! DOES TULIO SEE LIGHTS EVERY THREE OR FOUR MONTHS? It's very irregular he doesn't know. Sometimes he sees them twice or three times in the same month. Sometimes it appears later after three or four months. For 24 years, he has owned this farm. He bought it from another person and the person who he bought the farm from told him about the lights that used to happen on this farm, so this has occurred for a long time. HAS HE EVER FELT AFRAID OF ANY OF THE LIGHTS? No, never. Except he didn't know why some of the small lights were getting bigger (on November 24, 2001.) HAS HE EVER SEEN ANYTHING COME OUT OF THE LIGHTS? No. Nothing coming out from them. Large, Hairy Creature On Tulio's Farm in 1996 HAS HE EVER SEEN ANY KIND OF BEINGS ANYWHERE ON HIS FARM? Not Tulio, but someone who worked for him about seven years ago went to check on palm trees and this man saw a creature that was hairy and bigger than a cow and he was so afraid he couldn't pull his gun. He had never seen such a thing and it had big eyes. FELIPE: He had his dogs with him and was pointing for the dogs to go after the being. But the dogs would not. He thought 'This thing is much more powerful than me' and if I shoot him and he is more powerful than this bullet then he comes after me.' CAN HE DRAW WHAT HIS WORKER SAW? No because he did not see it. But it was like the size of a cow not the shape but big and hairy, very hairy with big eyes. It was not a monkey. A monkey would never be that size. ANYTHING ABOUT THE EYES? No details, except very big. He was scared. WHAT ABOUT TULIO? WOULD HE LIKE TO SEE ANY OF THE BEINGS? He would love to see them. WHY DOES HE THINK HE HAS NOT SEEN THEM? He went to this same spot to see the big hairy creature. He wanted to see it, but he couldn't find it. THE BIG HAIRY BEING. Yes. He wanted the worker to go with him, but the worker was too scared and did not want to go with him."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"DID HE FIND ANY TRACKS? It was a year later that he went back to the place. WHY DIDN'T HE GO BACK IMMEDIATELY? There was a time when it was raining a lot. He says his neighbors witnessed this big light that came up from the same spot where this happened and flew over a big mango tree that they have and went into the hill opposite his house. SO, THE LIGHT CAME OUT OF THE GROUND WHERE THE BIG HAIRY CREATURE WAS SEEN? URANDIR, DO YOU KNOW HOW THE LIGHTS GO IN AND OUT OF THE MESA? Plasma interacting with the matter. Didn't I go through the ceiling? \" Continued in Part 6. Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
