That night of June 21 to sunrise June 22, 2003, strange orange lightning bolts were observed all night from Knap Hill by electronics contractor, Stephen Clementson, and a colleague joining him on the night watch. Stephen Clementson, electronics co ntractor, Welwyn Gardens City, Hertfordshire, England: \"It was just gone midnight we were doing a night watch on Knap Hill which overlooks the Ea st Field where so many of the crop formations have appeared. There was lightning in the distance, but it was strange lightning. It was a very bright orange color, which is pretty damn rare. There was"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"no noise coming from it. This lightning was striking the ground, and sometimes striking the ground twice in a second. And no noise! IT LOOKED LIKE LIGHTNING BOLTS, BUT THE COLOR WAS ORANGE? Bright orange. What happened was that it drifted in a great circle around us, but where we were stayed bone dry. There was no rain, no noise, just these lightning strikes going all the way through the night. It was actually still going at dawn. It wasn't until around 7 a.m. that these heavy dark clouds rolled overhead and the hail and rain howled down. Silver white lightning was striking us quite closely over East Field and definitely was noisy. To make things stranger, there were lightning strikes between the clouds. At the same time, it looked like a cookie cutter had cut through the clouds and there was this glow inside, sort of a circle th at was glowing orange. Al l in all, it was pretty weird. I heard people in the crop circle cafe over at Cherhill reported seeing orange lightning that night, too. BUT STILL NO FORMATION IN THE EAST FIELD.
