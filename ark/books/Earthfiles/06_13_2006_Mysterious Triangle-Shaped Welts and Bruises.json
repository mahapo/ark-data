Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Mysterious Triangle-Shaped Welts and Bruises © 2006 by Linda Moulton Howe June 13, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Since the early 1980s and the television broadcast of my documentary about the global animal mutilations linked to extraterrestrial biological entities ( A Strange Harvest ), many people have contacted me to complain about scoop marks and scars left on their bodies after allegedly being taken by non-humans for incomprehensible reasons. I have been shown several photographs over the years of triangle-shaped scars that remain pinkish-red and sometimes slightly raised on the skin. One such photograph was shown to me in the early 1990s by a man who had been working in Brazil and was conscious of missing time. The quarter-inch long, perfect pink triangle, was on his right wrist above his thumb. He had vivid dreams of being taken by grey-colored beings with large black eyes into a round room. But he did not know why. Other people in the human abduction syndrome have remembered seeing symbols of triangles on non-human uniforms. Here are some examples from my book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses (See: Earthfiles Shop .). C ircle around triangle was on patch seen and drawn by Missouri abductee, J. R., after experiences in the 1970s. She remembered the symbol on \"left breast of uniform\" worn by grey being. S mall, light gray being described by P. W., Mt. Vernon, Missouri. Watson had repeated abductions from 1983 onward after she and her husband, Ron, watched small non-human beings float a black cow from a nearby pasture. Sketch by artist Hingway Hatch.

Right: March 16, 1993, abduction experience in which a triangular pyramid surrounded a helix spiral on the left side of a gray-colored body suit worn by a grey-skinned non-human. R ecently I received the following emails and images from a couple who request anonymity, but are interested in knowing if anyone else has discovered similar pinkish-red triangles on their skin, either recently or in the past. If so, please contact: earthfiles@earthfiles.com. 1) May 11, 2006: \"I thought maybe you could take a look at this bruise I have that has three red parallel lines inside the triangular bruise on my left, upper arm [ near armpit]. It hurt really bad on Monday [May 8, 2006], but I didn't look to see what was causing the pain, as I was sick with flu. On Tuesday, May 9, while I was getting dressed to see the doctor, my husband said, 'What is that?!' When I saw it, I said, 'That's where I've been hurting so bad.' \"I'm really curious to know if you've ever seen anything such as this anywhere on anything, or have others described similar markings? \"The attached pics should be viewed in this order, I suppose. 1) 1st email, 2) 2nd email, 3) Wed nite, 4) Thur am. Thanks so much Linda.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"T riangular welt/bruise with three reddish parallel lines inside the triangle behind left arm pit.

As for vivid dreams, my husband is amazed at how vivid and detailed my dreams are! Since I have been ill since Sunday [May 7, 2006] with the worst sore throat and fever, head cold, etc. I was not sleeping w ell and was w aking up a lot thru the night. Last night I kept complaining that there was so much light coming into the room. My husband said it was the full moon. I was startled awake in the middle of the night because I heard the door bell being rung three times. My heart was just pounding, but I thought it was just a dream. \"I w as on really on edge after that. I can't remember anything unusual about lights or buzzing, or much of anything. I just discovered today a tiny red triangle on my left calf. It's about 1/4 inch on each side. The inside is a bit raised, as if it was an insect bite, but it doesn't itch at all. Not a bruise, something else. My husband has the camera so I can't photograph it until tonight. I also have a tiny fingerprint bruise on the inside of my right knee. I'll keep you informed. Thanks!\" 3) June 11, 2006: \"This is just getting weirder by the day. This will be the 3rd triangle on my - and now my husband's body. This one is raised, red and not a bruise, no pain, itching, nothing. ... He first saw it June 11, after he took a shower in the morning around 9 am. He said, 'Look at this.' I couldn't believe it! I was actually shocked. He seems so calm and well, baffled. R eddish triangle was discovered on husband's left arm above wrist during morning shower on Sunday, June 11, 2006.
