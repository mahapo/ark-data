Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Aerial Triangles of High Strangeness © 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe May 2, 2002 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - After my Earthfiles and Coast radio reports (See: Real X-Files 04/22/02 and 04/27/02 and Science 05/02/02) about a large and slow moving triangle of star-like objects above Dover, Arkansas on April 14, I received hundreds of e-mails about other people's sightings of baffling aerial triangles. Since satellites are characterized by steady forward motion and are not capable of abrupt turns or circling on themselves, I offer the following excerpts from several interviews about triangle sightings of high strangeness which cannot be explained by known human satellites. Interviews: Jeremy Larson, Tile Mason, West Jordan, Utah: \"The date, I know the year was 1989 and it was late spring, early summer. I was in the back of a truck and looking up in the sky. Some motion caught my eye and I kind of looked in the direction of the movement and saw three lights which were in a very distinct triangular pattern. They were very symmetrical, like a perfect triangle, just three lights. And they would spin. When this object would move, it would either spin in a clockwise direction. Then it would stop just motionless. And it would hold there for a few seconds and then spin again in the opposite direction. And every time it would start moving, it would spin one way and then it would spin the other way. And it could stop just on a dime. I would say it shifted from clockwise to counter-clockwise probably three times in each direction, so it moved a total of six times. After one of these spins, I could tell, it didn't just fade out. It actually moved off, hard to tell what direction, but it just zipped off. Just gone.\" Crystal Durdel, Office Manager, Chenoa, Illinois: \"Back in 1974, I would have been about 11 and my sister who is five years younger than I am would have been about 6 years old. We had an old farm house and we slept up in the attic that had been remodeled for bedrooms and there were twin beds on either side of the window. When we would look out, there would be the lights. They would be off in the distance looking like a star. They would twinkle as a star. But they were usually in threes and they seemed to move in different formations. They would come apart and it would be a triangle. And then, they would chase each other. And what I mean by chase is that one would follow the other. It wouldn't be like one would zoom off and two would go right after. It would be like a formation where one would follow another in line, one following one following the other and so on. So, they would be at first in a triangle pattern and then the triangle pattern would come apart into a line? Yes, at times. And they would just follow each other. Then they would do more circular things. That's why we called it playing because it just looked like they were chasing each other around, like you would do a may pole or tree when you "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"are kids. And they were moving very quickly. Did you ever call your parents and ask them to look out the window when you were watching these stars move? We were supposed to be in bed! (laughs) No, because then we probably would have been told, 'Why are you still up?' I'm not sure what's out there. Obviously something was out there doing that. I believe it was an intelligence source, whatever it was.\" David Conley, Hazardous Waste Safety Associate, West Des Moines, Iowa: \"The third week of June in 1966, I was 11 years old. I went out leaning against the car watching the night sky and was there about 10 minutes before I seen what looked like a star, but it didn't twinkle. It was a white light. It was coming from the west traveling east. And it took about 2 minutes to travel from the horizon to directly overhead and it stopped, which kind of surprised me. I wasn't expecting it to stop. And as I kind of glanced towards the northeast, I seen another star, or satellite, that seemed to be moving. Same brightness, but it was moving faster than the first one had. It took it approximately one minute to come directly overhead and stopped just east of that same satellite, the first one I had seen. Which now you wonder what it is because you thought it was a satellite, but it stopped above you. Yeah, and now I've got two that stopped and one is side by side, each side by side anyway. And the second star, or satellite, or whatever, started to rotate, or revolve around the other one in a counter-clockwise manner. And that lasted maybe two to three minutes. And it continued to do this circling around and then stopped at the same, on the east side of the first point of light. And it sat there for a minute or so. And then it went back in the same direction that it came from, from the northeast, about the same speed it came originally. I watched it until it was out of sight which took about a minute. Then I looked back at the other star or light that was up there and it sat there for maybe two or three more minutes and then it started to slowly proceed in the same direction that it had come from in the west. And I watched it until it got out of sight.\" Barry Boone, Retired, Ash Fork, Arizona: \"About ten years ago in 1992, I was living in Scottsdale when I took a drive up to my cabin in northern Arizona. I was on Hwy 89 about 20 miles south of Ash Fork. It was about 3 o'clock in the morning. My friend and I were going deer hunting and we were driving down the road and all of a sudden I got a feeling like I was swerving off the road, or veering off the road. And I gripped the steering wheel and I was going straight. It was a really weird feeling, I don't know how to describe. But all of a sudden I realized I was going straight, but the sky in front of me there were three stars in a triangle moving off to my right. They moved off to my right out of my vision and I was kind of quiet for a second. My buddy asked me if I saw it and I was very relieved to see that he saw it, too, and it was quite exciting and exhilarating. So what you are saying is that it's almost as if a section of the sky moved right in front of you? That's exactly what it was. It was something in front of me that moved sideways. They looked like they were connected and they just moved to the right until I couldn't see them anymore because of the window. They moved from the north, straight in front of me was north, and they moved to my right which was east."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"But it was somehow disorienting to your mind and made you feel like you were swerving, but the sky was moving? Right. Kind of like when you stop at a stoplight and the car next to you moves and you press harder on the brake because you think you are moving, you know? But it wasn't me. I was going straight down the road. It was a pretty, really weird.\" Retired real estate salesman from Ashland, Oregon who wishes to remain anonymous: \"It was approximately 1972. I was 20 years old and living in San Francisco. I was sitting on a hillside overlooking the city just watching the lights and stars and so forth. It was quite late at night. Eventually I was laying on my back looking at the stars. And suddenly saw a small section, a triangular-shaped section of the sky move, basically. The only way I can describe it is that a triangular shaped section of the sky. The stars all moved at once. It was a group of stars of different magnitudes. There were probably three or four good sized stars, plus several much lighter (smaller) stars. And it moved off slowly towards the south. And at the time I was just flabbergasted. What really impressed me about my experience is that although I was very sure it was a very angular, triangular shape to it, there wasn't like anything obvious - like, there wasn't a star at each point or something like that about it that gave me that sense. It definitely had the feeling of a section of the sky moving and yet, I am very sure it was very triangular in shape.\" More Information: Book about \"pseudo stars\": Project Identification: The First Scientific Field Study of UFO Phenomena © 1981 by Harley D.
