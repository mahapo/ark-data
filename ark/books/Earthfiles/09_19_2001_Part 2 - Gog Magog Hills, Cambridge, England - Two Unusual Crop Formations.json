Charles Mallett, CFPR Field Report, Gog & Magog Hills, Cambridgeshire July 25, 2001 : \"Gog and Magog Hills have once again been chosen to receive a rather simple, but incredibly stunning crop circle event, this time of such majestic beauty and harmonious proportion that, for this writer, it's set far apart from the bulk of the English crop formations in 2001. ...(It is made of) two chunky crescents and a standing circle of wheat positioned within a flattened circle. Seventy-five thin paths of downed crop slice through the largest crescents with dramatic effect. From an aerial perspective this formation must be considered, without doubt, one of the finest of the season. 75 thin \"rays\" radiate from the ring around the thick crescent.

Throughout the whole formation that razor sharp look is consis tent to the degree of obsessive perfection.The floor construction is also extremely fluid and neat, very bouncy."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Upper crescent from which the 75 thin rays emanate.

This is interesting when one considers how fragile these flowers are, surely any mechanical device would have caused these plants huge trauma. To me it seems as if the agency involv ed in the creation of the real crop formations can be so effective and so subtle at their high craft that they can, with no problem, skirt around small flowers and other plants without causing any damage whatsoever.

Each one is approximately six inches wide and it looked as if they had been put down in the crop with great care and softness. The way this mature wheat was laid is also rather interesting. Down the length of each of the paths the crop has been whipped up from one side, it looked as if a small tube-wave had gone through, leaving the wheat gently brushed up one side of the wall of standing crop. This effect is consistent throughout all seventy-five avenues."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Top of crescents.

When I measured the July 25th formation's diameter, the tape pulled tight at exactly 237 feet. The amazing labyrinth within the July 11 huge ring measured exactly the same, 237 feet diameter. ...I left the formation in no doubt that the same circle making agency was responsible for the 666 feet ring, the maze and the square temple formation over the hill.\" Gog Magog Hills formation discovered on July 25, 2001.
