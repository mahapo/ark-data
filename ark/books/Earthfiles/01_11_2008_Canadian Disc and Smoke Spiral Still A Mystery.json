You can see it in some detail within the video. It’s very puzzling. We have no idea at this time what the identification of the object is.” - C hris Rutkowski, UFOROM N orth Tryon, Prince Edward Island, Canada, is marked by the red circle on the central south side of the island province. January 11, 2008 Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada - Canadian UFO researchers say that the number of unexplained aerial lights and craft reports in that country exceeded 650 in 2007. Of those cases, one of the strangest occurred on Boxing Day (Christmas boxes for employees and the poor), December 26, 2007. The time was 5:30 PM at dusk. Marie Ford-Quigley and her husband were driving near the small town of North Tryon on the south side of Prince Edward Island off the east coast of Canada. What happened next made this headline on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation TV broadcasts and internet news: “ Dark spiral in sky remains a mystery.” "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The CBC story with a link and a video excerpt is at: http://www.cbc.ca/canada/prince-edward-island/story/2008/01/03/spiral- mystery.html I talked about the mysterious aerial dark spiral this week with Chris Rutkowski, Research Coordinator for Ufology Research – also known as UFOROM – in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Interview: Chris Rutkowski, Research Coordinator, Ufology Research (UFOROM) Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada: “The Ford-Quigley couple had been driving home from an event and they happened to be looking up in the sky and saw an object. This was 5:30 p.m. on Canada's Boxing Day, right at dusk, and they saw a very odd circular object that looked to be white or grey in color and had what looked like a small tail coming out of it. The shape was very odd and to them did not look like an airplane, didn’t appear to be a helicopter or anything with which the couple was familiar. The object was moving in a very odd, corkscrew-like pattern through the sky. It was headed away from them going westward toward the mainland of Canada across the bay (Northumberland Strait). They watched it while driving home and then immediately went and got their video camera and began taking some video of the strange, spiraling object. They managed to get 8 to 9 minutes on video before it passed into the west very low. In fact, the strangest thing about this is that half way through watching the grey-white object traveling across the sky, it started giving off thick, black smoke. Because the round object was moving in the odd corkscrew pattern, the smoke began to form in a corkscrew pattern as well behind it. The couple watched the corkscrew-like smoke trail form as this thing continued to progress across the sky for the remainder of the sighting.

Because it was in view for so long, that automatically rules out several explanations, including it was not a meteor. Also, there have been some checks with Transport Canada and the Aviation Board and Environment Canada, the weather office there. Those agencies have all viewed the video and they don’t know what the object and dark spiral were. Even thought it seemed like something crashing, it proceeded very far down range. So it’s difficult to say where the object would have come down, but we’re fairly certain, it was not an aircraft, it was not a helicopter. The corkscrew moving pattern is very curious. You can see it in some detail within the video. It’s very puzzling. We have no idea at this time what the identification of the object is. COULD YOU CLARIFY SOMETHING FOR ME? LISTENING TO MARIE FORD-QUIGLEY, THE WIFE, AS SHE WAS TRYING TO HOLD THE CAMERA STEADY, YOU HEAR HER SAY, ‘THIS IS TAKING A VERY LONG TO GET TO THE GROUND.’ I HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS WATCHING SOMETHING THAT WAS SPIRALING DOWN TO THE GROUND, AS OPPOSED TO MOVING OFF TO THE HORIZON? The object was moving away from them, but was also descending. So, from a perspective point of view, it definitely looked like it was going down toward the ground. Eventually at the very end of the video, you can see the smoke trail just about touch the horizon. Now, whether that meant the object fell into the ocean, or simply passed out of sight around the Earth’s curvature because it was so far away, it’s difficult to say. But the object was going down and away from them. In addition, we have since found a few more eyewitnesses who say they did see the black trail in the sky. We are trying to track down additional people who might also have seen it before it started making the black smoke trail. At this point, we have only found people who saw the black trail. WHEN THE COUPLE FIRST SAW THE WHITE AERIAL OBJECT, WAS IT ALONE IN THE SKY WITHOUT ANY TRACE OF BLACK AROUND IT? Absolutely. It was in the sky without any trace of dark smoke around it. When it was moving and they first saw it, the object was starting to descend through some cloud layers. In fact, in a portion of the video that is not on the website that the link is from – the couple sent me the raw footage and you can see the object descending through cloud layers. You can see clouds move in front and then behind the aerial object as it is descending. It suggested it was at quite a high altitude and at the same time it was making descent. WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE THEM THINK IT WAS A PLANE IN TROUBLE AT FIRST? I think it was the unusual motion. The fact that something was moving in the sky in the odd corkscrew motion. IF IT WERE A TERRESTRIAL PLANE IN TROUBLE, YOU WOULD THINK THAT WOULD BE LINKED TO A CRASH."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Absolutely, and we have no record of any crash at all. One would think we would have heard of something like that. DID THE COUPLE HAVE A SENSE OF HOW LONG THEY WATCHED THE WHITE OBJECT CORKSCREWING DOWN THROUGH THE CLOUDS BEFORE THEY SAW THE FIRST HINT OF BLACK SMOKE? They said they watched it for 5 or 10 minutes before it started making the black smoke. That's a very long time, so it was moving at a high altitude away from them and then began giving off the black smoke. The couple did contact Transport Canada and talked to the officials themselves. The officials they spoke with had no explanation. Since then, some of the local media broadcasters also contacted some experts and some weather and government officials, and none of them has an explanation for what the couple saw. I READ WHAT THE CBC SAID ON JANUARY 3, 2008, WHICH INCLUDED THIS QUOTE FROM MARIE FORD-QUIGLEY THAT, ‘SO FAR THE BEST EXPLANATION IS THAT THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN FUEL DROPPED FROM AN AIRCRAFT.’ AND THEN THE ARTICLE GOES ON TO EXPLAIN THAT SOMETIMES A JET IN TROUBLE, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD TRY TO GET RID OF ITS HEAVY FUEL. I’M CURIOUS - WOULDN’T A JET DUMPING FUEL ALL HAPPEN FASTER THAN THE LONG 30-MINUTE SEQUENCE? That’s one of the problems with that explanation. It would be something that would disburse quickly. Another explanation that has been put forward is that perhaps it was the re-entry of a secret government rocket that had some problems and exploded on re-entry. We do know that two weeks before on December 10, 2007, the National Reconnaissance Office did have a rocket explode as it was going into orbit. Of course, this spiraling phenomenon was after that, but it’s possible it was another secret launch that had gone awry. But we have no information that this occurred. HAVE EITHER YOU OR THE COUPLE TALKED WITH ANYBODY OFF THE RECORD IN CANADIAN GOVERNMENT OR MILITARY WHO HAS TRIED TO SUGGEST ANY OTHER KNOWLEDGE? We’ve made contact. I have spoken with people in the aviation industry through Transport Canada if they had other records? Curiously, only five days before the North Tryon spiral, on December 21, 2007, there was another sighting by a helicopter pilot not far from there in Halifax, Nova Scotia, of an unusual aerial object. The pilot spoke with somebody on the ground when he landed who then contacted NORAD and NORAD actually admitted that they had tracked not only the helicopter, but the UFO that was seen near the helicopter and NORAD had no idea what it"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"was. We do have some contact that allows us input from officials. But so far, NORAD has not said anything about the smoke trail incident. DID NORAD USE THE PHRASE THE ‘UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT’? THAT THEY WERE TRACKING IT? They didn’t use the term ‘UFO,’ but they did say ‘unidentified flying object,’ yes. I WAS INTERESTED THAT IN THE CBC WEBSITE, THEY HAD ANOTHER STORY ABOUT CANADA SEEMS TO BE HAVING A LOT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS IN THE SKY. WOULD YOU GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING RECENTLY IN CANADA? We certainly have had a number of highly strange reports. Just in the past couple of days I have received two additional UFO reports from December. One was from Lake Audy in northern Manitoba. Another is from considerably further north near the Arctic Circle where someone had seen some unusual lights. As Research Coordinator for UFO Research, we do the analysis and try to keep track of all the UFO reports made in Canada throughout the course of a year. We are in the process of compiling all the reports into our data base, but at last count we had more than 650 UFO reports in Canada for 2007 alone. I do receive official UFO reports from Transport Canada and from the M. O. D. I do get reports from Canadian air force bases regarding reports and calls (from the public) made to them, but also other military personnel reports they receive. I suspect, though, that I only get the tip of the iceberg. So, I suspect there is a great number of UFO reports that are at a much higher classification level than I am privy to that are being made. Where those reports are going? I’m not sure.” More Information: or further reports about unusual aerial phenomena, please see Earthfiles Archive: • 12/11/2007 — More Confirmation of May 1974 Discs in Albuquerque and Huge Cylinder Craft At White Sands Proving Ground. • 12/08/2007 — Another Eyewitness to Glowing Disc and M ilitary Security in Albuquerque, New Mexico • 12/07/2007 — Part 2: Secret American M ilitary Space Program? • 12/03/2007 — Part 5: In League With A UFO • 12/01/2007 — Part 1: Secret American M ilitary Space Program? • 11/29/2007 — Part 1: Glowing Disc Encounter with M ilitary in Albuquerque, NM • 11/29/2007 — Part 2: Glowing Disc Encounter with M ilitary in Albuquerque, NM • 11/29/2007 — Part 3: Glowing Disc Encounter with M ilitary in Albuquerque, NM • 11/25/2007 — Part 4: In League With A UFO • 11/21/2007 — Part 3: In League With A UFO • 11/14/2007 — Part 2: In League With A UFO • 11/08/2007 — More Unusual Animal Deaths • 11/06/2007 — Part 1: In League With A UFO • 10/19/2007 — Updated: Huge, Silent, Black Triangle Craft Over Youngstown, Florida • 10/17/2007 — Updated: Half Cat Mutilations Persist in San Antonio, Texas • 09/28/2007 — Earthfiles Mail About Cat Mutilations • 09/26/2007 — Neatly Sliced Front Third of 14 Cats Found in Granbury, Texas • 09/16/2007 — Part 5: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/14/2007 — Part 1: Psi Spies - True Story of America's Psychic Warfare Program • 09/11/2007 — Part 4: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/07/2007 — Part 3: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/05/2007 — Part 2: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 08/31/2007 — Part 1: Betty and Barney H ill: Captured! • 08/31/2007 — Part 2: Betty and Barney H ill: Captured! • 08/30/2007 — Part 1: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 08/24/2007 — Orange-Red \"Fiery\" Aerial Spheres • 08/17/2007 — Two Bulls and Several Cows Dead and Mutilated in Manitoba, Canada • 08/01/2007 — Part 3, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards • 07/31/2007 — Part 2, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards • 07/28/2007 — Mysterious Aerial Lights Over Stratford-upon-Avon, July 14, and Farnborough, Hampshire, on July 22, 2007"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"• 07/14/2007 — Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii - Huge, Lime Green Oval Craft Hovered Over Battalion Headquarters • 07/13/2007 — Iowa Minister Reports Large \"Crab/Scorpion\" Creature Attacked Cow • 06/17/2007 — More Big Basin, California, Bizarre \"Drone\" Images • 06/15/2007 — Part 1: Northridge, California, Aerial \"Drone\" Eyewitness On the Record • 06/15/2007 — Part 2 - Star Wars Physicist Edward Teller, Outer Space Menace And Remotely Piloted Vehi cl e s ( RPVs ) • 06/08/2007 — More Drone Photos and Other Eyewitnesses • 05/30/2007 — Birmingham-Type \"Drone\" Seen At Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, in Mid-1980s • 05/29/2007 — Final Part 7: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans • 05/28/2007 — Letters About Unidentified \"Drone\" Aerial Objects • 05/25/2007 — Two More Eyewitnesses of Aerial \"Drones\" in 2005 and 2006 • 05/21/2007 — Updated: Odd Aerial \"Drone\"?
