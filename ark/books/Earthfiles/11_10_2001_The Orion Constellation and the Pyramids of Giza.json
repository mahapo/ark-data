He spoke this past weekend at the Earth Mysteries Conference in Sedona about the power of Egyptian talismans, physical objects that through magic and rituals were thought to bring the power of stars and gods into them; and his theory that the pyramids of Giza have the same alignment as the stars in the belt of Orion. He wrote a book about it with Adrian Gilbert in 1995 entitled, The Orion Mystery, Unlocking the Secrets of the Pyramids . The Greeks looked at the pattern of bright stars dominated by Betelgeuse and Rigel and saw a great hunter who claimed superiority over all Earth creatures. Nearby was the brightest star, Sirius, in Canis Major, one of the two faithful dogs that the Greeks said traveled with Orion. The other is Canis Minor. But the Egyptians considered Orion and Sirius to be the home of Isis and Osiris, gods that came to earth and created a kingdom in Egypt from which they also created humankind. After Osiris and Isis departed Earth, each Egyptian king wanted to follow and return his soul to Orion and Sirius upon death. The Giza pyramids were built on strict alignments with those stars, and Sirius was the star of rebirth depended upon to breathe new life and resurrection into dead kings. Mummification was part of the complex ritual of magic that linked terrestrial life to an eternal life with Osiris and Isis. Reinforcing the idea of that intimate relationship between the pyramids and the Orion constellation are shafts inside the largest pyramid at Giza. Two carved channels come out of the Queen's Chamber and two out of the King's chamber. At first, archaeologists thought the shafts helped ventilate the pyramid. But contradicting that theory is the fact that the two channels leading from the Queen's Chamber are blocked at both ends. Other theories suggested the shafts were used like telescopes to observe stars from within the pyramid. But the shafts go from a horizontal level and bend upward making line of sight through them impossible. In 1981, while working with another engineer in Saudi Arabia, Robert Bauval had the sudden inspiration that the the three Giza pyramids seen from above had the same slightly offset alignment pattern as Orion's belt. Interview: Robert Bauval, Construction Engineer and Author of The Orion Mystery, Unlocking the Secrets of the Pyramids , Beaconfield, Buckinghamshire, England: \"I saw three stars that looked like three pyramids and it completely"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"changed the course of my life! As simple as that. I was working in Saudi Arabia as a construction engineer and as I have explained in my talks is that my specialty in my engineering profession started with a setting out engineer. I was aligning monuments. And therefore I was very interested in this aspect of engineering. And took it further and became very interested in ancient monuments, particularly pyramids, and tried to explain their alignments. One thing lead to another and eventually while in Saudi Arabia, I made that correlation with the stars of Orion. It so happened that I was into that strange problem of trying to explain the alignment of the three pyramids of Giza and it so happened that - it's exactly how it happened. I was visiting some friends in Saudi Arabia and had just returned from Egypt and they had brought with them a coffee table book with lovely pictures of the pyramids. One of the captions next to the pyramid was a quotation from the pyramid text which incidentally I had not read then. I'm talking about 1981. And that text simply said, which I know now by heart, that the king became a star and the king went to Orion. And it stuck in my mind. A few days later, I happened to be in the desert and a friend was with me. And we were talking about the stars and he happened to be a navigator. It was just one of those flukes. He explained that if he didn't have charts, he would use the stars as all navigators do. He said the easiest way to quickly chart your way in the skies was to look at the constellation of Orion, that you could draw a line from the belt to Sirius and find that star's position and then find certain other directions. And then as an after thought, he said, 'The three stars of Orion are not straight. One is off set.' And bang, for me, that did it. I saw it then. Some people have said, by the way, that you cannot see the Orion correlation of the pyramids, you cannot see the pattern of the Pyramids, from the ground. Indeed, you can't. But a lot of people forget that you can go to the top of the Great Pyramid. From there you can actually see it. It is very striking. But it is much more striking from a high distance. BUT WHY WOULD EGYPTIANS HAVE ANY SPECIAL PERCEPTION OF THE ORION BELT? Taking it from a completely simplistic level, Orion is an extremely bright and noticeable constellation. In the times when the pyramids were built, the constellation of Orion would appear at very important times of the year. It would rise sometime, some 20 or 25 days before the summer solstice and an hour or so before the appearance of the star Sirius. So in a sense, Orion was the herald, the announcer, of the great event of the Summer Solstice and the appearance that the star Sirius brought about which, of course, was the flooding of the Nile. So, Orion in the sky was a signal for rebirth, the rebirth of Egypt. One can see how this archetypal image in the sky, the concept of forthcoming rebirth, was associated with the god of resurrection and rebirth of the Egyptians. It's important to realize that all Egyptian monuments, and particularly the pyramids, are astronomically aligned, are astronomically oriented. And the pyramids, particularly the Great Pyramid, are aligned to the cardinal directions. That means, north, east, south and west. The alignment is so precise that in order to achieve this alignment, you need to, they had to aim their sighting instruments to the stars. So, that's the first thing that these monuments are surveyed and aligned using the stars. And that's the stellar connection, if you like. But more importantly within the Great Pyramids, there are two chambers within the superstructure: we call them the King's Chamber and the Queen's Chamber. And from these chambers emanate two shafts. In each chamber, there are two shafts. One shooting north and one shooting south. On the basis that this pyramid has astronomical connotations, both physically in the sense of its alignment, and symbolically in the sense of the religion it is based on, the religion of the stars and Orion and Sirius and so forth - it is very tempting to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"assume that these shafts had a ritualistic function. There is a great misconception about these shafts because it has been thought for a long time that they might be ventilation shafts. This hypothesis has long been discounted for various reasons. first, it wouldn't make sense that ventilation would be necessary in a monument where supposedly a dead body was placed. In any case, the shafts in the Queen's Chamber were shuttered at both ends. So, they couldn't possibly have served the purpose of ventilation. So, we must look for another purpose. And because of the intense astronomical qualities of these monuments, it is correct to assume the shafts might have had astronomical implications. Well, the fact that they are inclined, that they rise on an inclined slope and each of the shafts has a different slope, ranging from about 30 degrees to 45 degrees. These slopes to an astronomer, especially as the shafts point north and south, are indicative of a region of the sky that is very rich with these constellations that the Egyptians speak about. And a quick calculation using procession has shown since the early 1960s, that first the upper shafts of the King's Chamber had stellar alignments. The southern one pointed to the belt of Orion, the three stars in the belt of Orion. and the northern one more than likely was aligned to the North Pole of the sky, and probably to the star Thuban, Alpha Draconis, which was the polar star at the time. Now, to what purpose? One, in the southern direction, we knew there was some kind of connection to the pyramids, the mummification rituals, the rebirth rituals, to these particular stars of Orion that the King longed for his soul to go to. So, that made sense. The other was that the Egyptians speak in great quantity in the texts about the so-called indestructible stars, the circumpolar stars in the north. THAT WOULD NEVER RISE OR SET. That would never rise or set and therefore, to them, they were stars perpetually in the sky and indestructible. However, the axis, the alignment of the northern shaft of the King's chamber points very close to the celestial pole and it indicates to me that the pyramid is literally anchored to the axis of the sky. In short, it is a monument that is locked into a cosmic order. This is precisely what I think they are: these structures are integrated into a cosmic order with the stars of Orion, the polar star and so forth. Later on, I came into the picture and worked on the alignments of the lower shafts and discovered that the southern shafts pointed to Sirius, the star of Isis. And the northern shaft probably pointed to one of the bright stars in Ursa Minor which the Egyptians referred to as the \"Opener of the Way.\" It is known in the zodiac as the Little Bear, but it's in the form of a jackal in Egyptian iconography. There, too, there is a meaning to these alignments ritualistically to do with a pyramid cult. We are told of a ritual known as the Opening of the Mouth. The mummy would be given, ritualistically given the breath of life again by cracking or inserting an instrument in the mouth of the dead and giving it breath again. This instrument was in the shape of that (Ursa Minor) constellation. We know for sure because they called it the same name as the constellation and it had that peculiar shape like a spoon, like a bent spoon. So, in a sense, the pyramid becomes integrated with the astral link of that ritual, that some how from the stars and rebirth process, the deceased would be given the breath of life again. And Sirius, of course, is the star of rebirth which the king originally had been associated with at his physical human birth on earth. We know that they associated the birth of kings with the appearance of the star Sirius at dawn of the summer solstice. So, all this makes sense to me. They are not, as many people have suggested or argued, that they are astronomical shafts. They are not meant to look through. You cannot, in fact, see through them. Parts of them are running horizontally and then on an incline. It's impossible to see through them. They are ritualistic, magical devices, that need to be understood in that sense. That's what these shafts mean."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WHY MAGICAL? Because the rituals are magical. The whole process of Egyptian religion that point needs to be stressed again. The Egyptians did not have a religion. There is no such thing or word in ancient Egypt as a religion. The nearest thing that comes close to what we would call today religion was a word that meant magic. They believed that one could learn to bring down the powers of the cosmos through rituals, through alignments of monuments. They believed they could draw down the powers of these stars, the powers of the gods, into physical things like statues and pyramids. The pyramids to them were imbued with stellar power. This is the kind of magic they practiced. There are other words for it. Some people have called it astral magic. Some people have called it \"talismanic magic\" which is my favorite definition. It is the understanding that spiritual ideas can be incorporated in physical things, very much like we are spirits in a material body. So can other things in nature have spiritual power and hence, the pyramid itself is given a soul, if you like, through these kinds of rituals. It's something that needs to be understood because there is so much talk about Egyptian religion, but there is no such thing. There is Egyptian magic. IN A SENSE, IT'S AS IF THE GODS THAT THEY PERCEIVED WERE LIVING WITH THEM ALIVE IN LIFE OR AFTER DEATH IN ALL OF THEIR EFFORTS TO MUMMIFY IN ORDER TO BE RESURRECTED WITH THE SAME KIND OF SURROUNDINGS THEY HAD HAD HERE, BUT IN ANOTHER PLACE. WHAT DO YOU SUPPOSE, THOUGH, FROM A STUDY OF THE BEGINNINGS WOULD HAVE PROVOKED THE EGYPTIAN MIND TO THINK THAT MUMMIFICATION WOULD GIVE THEM A GUARANTEE OF LIFE BEYOND DEATH HERE? Mummification as you know, Linda, is associated through an archetypal story or myth which is the myth of Isis and Osiris. The Egyptians fervently believed that the gods had once come down to earth and that they were descendants of the lineage of divine beings from the source of Orion, Osiris and Isis. Osiris and Isis represented the archetypal king and queen that had come down from the stars and had begun a terrestrial kingdom in Egypt. This is at the very root of Egyptian magical religion. And that events that followed in the lives of Isis and Osiris which lead eventually to the mummification of the body of Osiris. Osiris is killed at the ripe age of 28, so we are told in some of the texts. Again, we have astronomical symbolism here, the phases of the moon. What follows is that Isis left without child or replacement or heir to this kingdom that was begun by Osiris, follows a magical ritual of mummification by bringing back the mutilated corpse of her husband that was cut to pieces by his brother, Seth, and through some sort of magical rituals which we call the mummification rituals, brought back the mummy to life. And it is for the sole and unique purpose of being able to give life to Osiris in order to become pregnant from him. And Osiris having been brought temporarily to life in terrestrial existence again, his soul is released in this process and his soul returns to the stars and to the particular stars of Orion. From this archetypal story which is in a sense drafted in the sky, the sky becomes sort of a book where the story of Isis and Osiris are written, the kings of Egypt believed they were reincarnations of the son of Isis and Osiris, the posthumous son who was born called Horus. Kings of Egypt were absolutely convinced of this idea that they were Horus's kings. WOULDN'T THIS BE SIMILAR TO THE REINCARNATION OF SOULS, FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE BUDDHAS? Absolutely. The Egyptians had absolutely no doubt that their kings, at least, were part of a perpetual system of reincarnation that went from son to father, son to father, which meant to them that in a living physical form, the king was a"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"reincarnation of the son of Isis and Osiris. But in his death, he became released from his physical body, left his terrestrial role to his successor, and he became himself Osiris. And the whole process is to create an Osiris, a mummification. We call this mummification. I don't like this term because it implies this gruesome idea of taking bodies, drying them and wrapping them. We begin to look at them too mechanistically. The best term that would define this is the Osirisization of a corpse. That king becomes, is made into another Osiris, in the same sense that Osiris was made. And by doing step-by-step the process the process that happened to Osiris, they were certain that the same results would occur - the soul of the king would be released and would depart into the sky from whence it had originated and rejoin its place in the sky which is among those stars (Orion's Belt and Sirius). This was an absolute belief for the Egyptians. They believed it as much as we believe we exist on this earth. This was a fundamental aspect of their belief system. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THEIR PERCEPTION OF THE UNIVERSE AND ESPECIALLY THEIR FOCUS ON SIRIUS AND THE ORION BELT STARS WAS PROVOKED BECAUSE THEY LITERALLY WERE TAUGHT BY NON-HUMANS WHO CAME FROM THAT PART OF THE GALAXY AND TAUGHT THEM, JUST AS THE SUMERIANS HAVE A VERY SIMILAR KIND OF CONCEPT OF THOSE WHO CAME FROM THE STARS AND TAUGHT THE SUMERIANS? If one accepts what the Egyptians tell us in their texts literally, then what they tell us is precisely what you just said. They say that the gods came from the stars and established civilization on earth and then re-departed to the stars and prepared for us, or their progeny, which is us, a place among the stars for us to return to. In a curious way, this is in metaphoric language not very different from what astrophysics tells us today. I remember the famous statement by Carl Sagan that we are star stuff. We are indeed made out of star material, whether we like it or not. We are children of the stars. Our earth is a product of a star. And indeed, the question is which star which makes it even more interesting. And the Egyptians are not saying anything that we cannot accept today as modern thinkers. Whether the events can be taken literally in the sense that beings from these specific star systems actually came down is a matter of speculation. BUT WHAT IF IT IS TRUE? WHAT IF THE REASON THAT THE DOGON TRIBE IN AFRICA HAS ALL THIS ESOTERIC KNOWLEDGE ABOUT SIRIUS AND THE PHYSICS OF THE BINARY STAR SYSTEM BECAUSE THEY WERE DEALING WITH EXACTLY THE SAME INTELLIGENCE THAT EGYPT AND SUMERIA WERE DEALING WITH THAT LEFT A LEGACY OF ALL KINDS OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ASTRONOMY AND MATH? Yes, you've said the magic word 'What if?' Of course, with what if, we can do a lot of things. But let's go on the assumption that such a thing might have happened. Then if it did happen, perhaps the goal is to find out if it really did happen. Although some people - and I throw myself in this camp, may be reluctant to take that step. Nonetheless, if it is true, then truth will emerge. I'm a great believer that truth eventually emerges. And perhaps all these studies we are undertaking from different points of view will lead to this one conclusion. I would be the most thrilled to know this was a truth! But at the moment, like I said, in a sense it is academic whether it is true or not. What is important is what they believed to be true or not. For me, that is sufficient to pursue this line of study. I KNOW THAT IS ONE PARTICULAR HYPOTHESIS, BUT ONE THAT IS GROWING, I THINK, AMONG SCIENTISTS I TALK TO IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE ARE ADVANCED CIVILIZATIONS BEYOND HERE AND THEY DO TERRAFORM AND SEED PLANETS AND THAT THIS PLANET MAY BE AN EXPERIMENT. I'm open to the possibility that if comets can deliver the seed of life to other parts of the universe, then they might have been used as vehicles for"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"terraforming. So the visitation if it happened, let's keep it as a hypothesis, could have been through a cometary messenger rather than in the manner that others visualize - some sort of star ship or craft has come here. We have evidence of comets coming here, exploding, of meteorites landing on the earth. We even have evidence of fossilized microbes and microscopic creatures being brought to this planet. We have evidence of that. That is sufficient. But we do not have evidence of a star craft. We do not have evidence of interspace travel. Some people think they do. I know that Sitchin does. WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON ZECHARIA SITCHIN'S TRANSLATION OF SUMERIAN CUNEIFORM THAT SEEMS TO VERY DETAILED AND SPECIFICALLY DESCRIBE A NON-HUMAN EXTRATERRESTRIAL SPECIES COHABITING WITH HUMANS AND TEACHING THEM EVERYTHING THAT THE SUMERIAN CULTURE KNEW? The same can be said for the Egyptians. The Egyptians say the same thing. But you must accept that in order to reach the conclusion that Sitchin arrives and others arrive, there is a point where there is a leap of faith. It's a question about whether you want to take that step. Do you want to accept that what is being said there in those ancient texts is literal truth. It's a question of how you want to take it. Cydonia and Mars IN YOUR WORK WITH GRAHAM HANCOCK ABOUT MARS AND THE CYDONIA 'FACE' AND PYRAMIDS ( The Mars Mystery: The Secret Connection Between Earth and the Red Planet ), DID YOU FIND IN YOUR RESEARCH THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONNECTIONS PHYSICALLY WITH THE EARTH? What we faced there is that in a nearby planet of our solar system might be an artificial monument. Lo and behold, these monuments appear to be pyramids. So, it would be foolish if the possibility of monuments on a nearby planet existed, then we should be open to the possibility of monuments of a similar design and similar caliber might have a connection. So we explored. We were open to the possibility. We weren't afraid to go in this direction. I call this Platonic investigation. If the clues are there, if the evidence is there, then you are justified to follow it. But you must be brave enough that if it is not leading to where you hoped it leads, you must abandon it or modify it. DID YOU FIND THAT THE PYRAMID THAT IS PART OF THE CYDONIA COMPLEX SEEMED TO HOLD UP IN THE ANALYSIS AS A TRUE PYRAMID? At the time it did, to be honest. At the time, we were getting more and more convinced that we might have artificial structures there. the only way to conclude this was to send another probe there to get clearer pictures, or to physically go there. Now, it so happened the book in late 1997 just at the time that the latest probes were being sent there and we had to admit that from at least the photographic evidence that was being published by NASA that suddenly the needle swung towards non-artificial structures. BUT THAT WAS ONLY ON THE FACE. THAT WAS NOT LOOKING AT THE COMPLEX OF THE PYRAMIDS IN WHAT HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS THE CITY? I fully agree that to me the matter may not be closed in the minds of a lot of people. We took it as far as we could take it, short of physically going there and having a look physically."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"IF THERE IS A LINK BETWEEN PYRAMIDAL STRUCTURES ON MARS AND ON THE EARTH, WOULDN'T THAT SUPPORT EVEN FURTHER WHAT THE EGYPTIANS AND THE SUMERIANS THEMSELVES SAID THAT A NON-HUMAN STAR PEOPLE FROM PERHAPS ORION AND SIRIUS CAME TO THIS SOLAR SYSTEM AND WERE NOT ONLY INTERFACING AND INVOLVED WITH EARTH, BUT WITH MARS? The simple answer to this is yes. But you said 'if.' The implications of artificial structures on Mars would completely change our perception of our existence. And indeed with a big if, if these structures had proved to be artificial, then we would be obliged to consider an interstellar visitation. NOTHING HAS PROVED AGAINST THERE BEING PYRAMIDAL STRUCTURES ON MARS. I agree it has not been totally disproved. What I just said earlier, that we are at the position where we need the next step. That is to physically go there. That's it. We wrote our book after we investigated and we concluded that from the evidence that has been provided so far from NASA that the needle has swung towards non-artificiality. But it doesn't mean that it has reached the full conclusion. There is still the possibility and we would be foolish as a race on planet earth, that the possibility even though remote that artificial structures are existing on a nearby planet, we would be foolish to ignore it. But I myself that where I stop, there are others waiting to carry on. Could we be, in the panspermia hypothesis, from somewhere else and are we adapted here? In fact, the more one thinks of it, the more one is inclined to think so. We are extraordinary creatures. We seem to be at odds with the natural world here. And if so, we are from somewhere else, sooner or later we will discover it. My way of approaching this is saying that perhaps the means to know this is through an ability we have not put into full practice which the Egyptians perhaps had, or at least developed much more than we did. That is that the knowledge is within us. That this information is inside. We are encoded with it. But we are not reading it. We are looking outside. We are trying to explain by sending probes to outer space. Perhaps that knowledge is in there and let's say that this form of knowledge does not require the kind of evidence that science is looking for. DOES THAT TRANSLATE INTO MEDITATION THEN? There are many ways. I'm trying to learn the language of the soul that the Egyptians did. I spoke a lot about what I call that talismanic language or wisdom. I believe we can talk internally by using another language of symbols, sensation and feelings encapsulated in symbols. In our almost finished next work, Graham Hancock and I call it Talisman (to be published in 2003). We believe there was a talismanic science. Basically our mind thinks in those terms and responds to symbols and signs. We read nature through a language that is a talismanic language. We absorb the knowledge of nature through that. and the stars. So we have tried to explain what this is, how it was applied by the ancient Egyptians, how it was revised in the Hermetic texts in Florence, how it served as the base of several reformation movements and in the modern times Masonic, Rosicrucian and Hermetic movements. This interests me because it seems we are lacking the ancient science and wisdom. Today we have it in a puzzle form and we need to put it together. That's what we are trying to do in this book. There is a language of the soul, a language of internal self, the talismanic language, and people will feel that there is a search to do within. Other things come in the tool kit meditation and other things. I am pursuing it through the talismanic language. We need to understand why the monuments, symbols, star lore and processes of ritual. I don't believe it was hocus pocus. I believe it was part of a very sophisticated science of the soul.\""},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"More Information: Click to connect to Amazon.com We b s it e s : Stars & Signs II Egypt tour with Robert Bauval - Here's the info/link: http://www.ancientquest.com/travel/starsandsigns/press.html Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
