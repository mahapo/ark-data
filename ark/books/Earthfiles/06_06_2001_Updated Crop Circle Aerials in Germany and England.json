Aerial photograph by Nick Nicholson, Editor, The Circular Review . Reported by Nick Nicholson, Editor, The Circular Review in England: \"Near Wakerley Woods and Barrowden, (I) climbed the verge and to my left my reward (was) a substantial circular formation spanning five tractor lines! 120 feet plus. It is in barley and consists of an outer ring about 4 feet wide in the middle of the standing crop is a circle about 10-12 feet in diameter surrounded by a thin ring in between this and the outer ring. It is literally a maze of patterns too complex to describe without an aerial image. \"Spoke to two people in the area and they were not aware of it before. One young man said he could not recall seeing it Saturday 2nd June. It is situated west of Barrowden on the Seaton road. It looks very impressive, found by me.\" We b s it e s : http://www.franklaumen.de/ http://invisiblecircle.de/ http://www.cropcircleconnector.com http://www.cropcircleresearch.com http://www.dcca.nl http://www.swirlednews.com Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
