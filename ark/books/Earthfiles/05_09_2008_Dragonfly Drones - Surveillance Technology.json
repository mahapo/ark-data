Airbrushed images © 2007 by Brent Yearout. May 9, 2008 Camas, Washington - A year ago on May 4, 2007, Coast to Coast AM webmaster, Lex, received an email from a Central California resident who called himself “Chad” about his photographing an odd, dragonfly-shaped, aerial object. In an email a week later, Chad sent some of his photographs dated May 6, 2007. [ See: 051507 Earthfiles for photos.] In addition to the dragonfly-shaped body that had appendages sticking out from a large ring, there was another odd feature. Rising from the ring straight up into the air were slightly curved, thin wires that formed a tall, circular crown above the dragonfly body. Chad was worried about his family's safety and health after he saw the bizarre aerial object at least eight times from his house and on hikes near his home and heard a low, electrostatic hum coming from it. Neighbors, he said, had also seen the unidentified aerial object. Other 2007 photographs of dragonfly-shaped aerial objects began to emerge between May and June from Lake Tahoe, Capitola and Big Basin, California – all with appendages sticking out from a ring and the tall, thin wires extending high above. [ See More Information below.] By June 17, 2007, I received a dozen paper photographs dated June 5th, 2007, in post office mail. The new “drone” looked more menacing and more complicated than the others. I had taken to calling the objects “drones” because eyewitnesses had the impression that the hovering craft were not manned. The dozen photographs were from a man who called himself “Ty B.” Ty explained he photographed the large, dragonfly craft while bicycling with a group in the Big Basin Redwood Park near Saratoga, California. He said they all saw the dragonfly-shaped craft fade in and fade out three times above them. It was on the third fade in that Ty was able to take twelve photos, which he mailed to me. All the photographs are archived in 061707 Earthfiles. After the Big Basin craft, no other photographs of the mysterious dragonfly-shaped “drones” emerged. And none of us knew until spring 2008, that two other eyewitnesses further north in Camas, Washington, on the Columbia River between Washington and Oregon, were encountering another craft that moved like a dragonfly above Lakamas Lake on June 7, 2007. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"C amas is a city in Clark County, Washington, with a population of 12,534 at the United States Census. Officially incorporated on June 18, 1906, the city is named after the camas lily, a plant with an onion-like bulb prized by Native Americans. One of the major geographical features of the city is Prune Hill, upon which a great portion of the residential area of the city is located. Prune Hill is the remaining cinder cone of an extinct volcano. The paper mill industry has been replaced in recent years by several white-collar, high-tech companies including Hewlett-Packard, Sharp Microelectronics, Linear Technologies and WaferTech among others. Those two eyewitnesses are good friends. After a year of silence, one has agreed to speak on the record with his full name: Brent Yourout (ure-OWE), a 48-year-old professional artist who specializes in airbrushing cars, motorcycles and blue jeans. Even though Brent was born and raised in the Vancouver, Washington, region as a strict Catholic, he has not been as upset as his friend, Tim, by their encounter with an unearthly-looking aerial craft. Tim is a Christian fundamentalist who does not accept that there is other intelligent life beyond Earth and he is not willing to comment. Brent Yearout is a single parent with two sons. In the late afternoon of Thursday June 7, 2007, Brent dropped one of his sons downtown in Camas and was returning home up the hill out of Camas that goes toward Lacamas Lake. He heard sirens and could see behind him the blue flashing lights of two police cars speeding up the hill. Brent pulled over as the police went by. After that came more emergency rescue vehicles, a fire truck and another police car. Brent worried that there had been a big wreck up ahead and thought of his good friend, Tim, who lived up the road. When Brent reached Tim's house, he was relieved that all was quiet. But he was surprised when more Camas City Police and Clark County officers sped by. Brent Yearout drove to an open space overlooking Lacamas Lake to see if there was a wreck on Leadbetter, a curvy road that follows the lake. He could not see anything on the road, but coming toward him in the sky was something he had never seen before. Brent Yearout, Professional Airbrush Artist, Camas, Washington.

Interview: Brent Yearout, Professional Airbrush Artist, Camas, Washington: “Then I saw what I thought was a logging helicopter – a really small-framed helicopter, like a wire-frame helicopter – coming down what we call the Lacamas Valley down along Lacamas Creek."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I’m going up the hill and I start hearing this static sound. I thought it was my radio and I pushed a button on my stereo and realized it was on CD. So, I wondered what is that static? I thought it was kind of weird and maybe I had run over a branch or something and was dragging a branch under the car – that’s kind of what it sounded like. So, I rolled down my window and was slowing down. It was not coming out of my side of the car, so I rolled down the passenger window and it sounded like it was coming out of the passenger window. I could hear the wind going over my sunroof, so as I was slowing down, the static seemed like it was getting louder. As I’m slowing way down, it’s still making this sound and it’s getting louder and louder and I’m thinking, ‘What the heck?!’ And I look to my left, which is just about 200 or 300 feet over the Lacamas Lake water from where I am on the road and I saw what I thought was that helicopter thing. And I realize the sound is coming from this thing! And I’m looking at it and wondering, ‘What the heck is that?’ The first thing is that I’m looking for some kind of propulsion system. I’m looking for a propeller and I know there is a ring. I knew I could see light through this ring at kind of a side angle. But I could not hear anything that sounded like a turbine engine or an internal combustion engine or a steam engine or anything for that matter. I’m real mechanical with that stuff and I know what that stuff sounds like. I’m going, ‘That is so weird!’ And I’m looking at this thing and it’s not like anything I’ve ever seen before in my life, OK? And I’m just in awe! I’m sitting there and have a really nice Olympus camera in my glove box, but I’m in so much shock over this thing that I did not even think about it. I’m looking around to see if there is anyone else. I live in a fairly rural area, but a lot of people jog and bicycle by the lake and I didn’t see a soul. And I’m thinking, ‘Oh, my word, here I am having a Close Encounter and there isn’t anybody around.’ I’m looking at this thing and it kind of hovered and as it was coming down through the trees as I was coming up the hill, it was moving back and forth in an erratic motion like it was looking for something. You know what I mean? Like a helicopter going back and forth looking for something. I could see like it rotated like a helicopter would kind of. The craft was staying stationary, but the body of it was twisting or something. And as I’m looking at this thing, the noise was really loud making a static sound. It sounded like electricity or something. Do you know what a Jacob’s Ladder is where it goes zzzzzzzzzzz (makes sound)? Or static on a television set late at night, but really louder than that. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - A Jacob's ladder (more formally, a high voltage traveling arc) is a device for producing a continuous train of large sparks which rise upwards. The spark gap is formed by two wires, approximately vertical but gradually diverging away from each other towards the top. J acob's ladder high voltage traveling arc. When high voltage is applied to the gap, a spark forms across the bottom of the wires where they are nearest each other, rapidly changing to an electric arc. Air breaks down at about 30kV/cm, depending on humidity, temperature, and so on. Apart from the anode and cathode voltage drops, the arc behaves almost as a short circuit, drawing as much current as the electrical power supply can deliver, and the heavy load dramatically reduces the voltage across the gap. The heated, ionized air rises, carrying the current path with it. As the trail of ionization gets longer, it becomes more unstable, finally breaking. The voltage"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"across the electrodes then rises and the spark re-forms at the bottom of the device. This cycle leads to an exotic-looking display of electric white, yellow, blue or purple arcs, which is often seen in movies about mad scientists. The device was a staple in schools and science fairs of the1950s and 1960s, typically constructed out of a Model T spark coil, or any other source of high voltage in the 10,000 volt to 30,000 volt range, like a neon sign transformer or circuit (10-30 kV) or a television picture tube circuit (flyback transformer; 10-28 kV), and two coat hangers or rods built into a V-shape. For larger ladders, microwave oven transformers connected in series or utility pole transformers (pole pigs) run in reverse (step-up) are used. The sparks can burn through thin paper and plastic and start fires; contact with the exposed high voltage can be lethal.] BRENT, WHAT IS THERE IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE CRAFT SEEMED TO BE LOOKING? R ed dot is where Brent Yourout stopped his car about 200 feet above Lakamas Lake at about the same height as the craft that moved like a dragonfly. White dot marks Tim's home where he was more underneath the strange craft as it flew over. Date was June 7, 2007, at sunset. The Google map above of Camas, Washington, is rotated to match Brent's map below."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"T he odd spirals in this aerial photograph of Lakamas Lake are where Brent Yearout says the dragonfly-moving craft hovered on June 7, 2007. I don’t know. It was over the lake. But it was not a helicopter. There were no blades on it. There were no props. It had a nose on it. I understand how airplanes work and stuff. A wing – there was not anything that resembled a wing. Even the appendages. The nose? Maybe it resembled a wing, but there was no leading edge on it. It was all the same width. WHEN YOU SAY ‘NOSE,’ WHAT DO YOU MEAN? When I say ‘nose,’ it had a different thing on the front. The front of it was a different appendage than the other ones. The other ones looked like spikes or spears. SO HOW IS THE NOSE DIFFERENT? It was long and it was flat. The other appendages seemed to be bulkier for some reason. And I could see where they joined the body, it looked like there were couplers. It almost looked like a transformer to me with the wire structure and couplers everywhere like the thing that went out the front. It seemed like there was a coupler there. Loud Static, Ozone Smell and “Dragonfly” Twitched As If Malfunctioning One of the things that went through my head is that the thing was hurt or injured or that something was malfunctioning is what I felt like because of the way it was twitching. And I started to smell something that smelled like ozone. I don’t know if you know what ozone smells like, but it’s like a burned circuit board and this thing is making this ungodly noise and it seemed like forever. I looked around and there still were no cars, no nothing. And I’m thinking this is so weird! TWITCHING? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? Like almost every time it made the static sound, it would shudder or something. It sat there, but it was like the static was so loud and like it was a part of the craft. I could not see any thrusters going down. I was looking for a propeller in the middle is what I was thinking because I’ve played with radio-controlled stuff. And I did not see anything like that. And the noise it made is what got me the worst. It looked like the appendage that was facing me, which would have been the right side of it, rotated. It looked like the appendages rotated and the ring stayed still almost. And the appendages rotated to the left and went directly away from me and then I could see an appendage sticking out the rear. And it went like zip, zip and it was gone! I could see right up the Columbia River Gorge, right up towards Mount Hood and Bonneville Dam – boom! The thing was not very thick. It was thin! I think that’s why everyone was calling them drones because they are so small. There was not enough structure there to house anyone, not a person, unless they were very, very small people! There was no pilot, you know? So, I’m looking around and figure this has to be some electrically operated – something that is operating off of an arc or something. I don’t get it because I could smell it and I could hear the crackling sound."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"This thing zipped off and I sat there for a second and realize I’ve got a camera in my glove box and I’m going, ‘What an idiot! Nobody is ever going to believe this!’ Brent Hurried Home to Airbrush Sketches of Odd Craft I had a car in my garage that I was working on (spray painting). I don’t live far from where this happened, so I drove up the road and came in and I just grabbed my airbrush and they have these little, black boards I use to make sure I’ve got the right line on my airbrush and stuff. And I fuzzed in a picture of it – a little circle with the appendages with collars on them. And the phone rings and it’s my friend, Tim, whose house I was looking at to make certain the police officers weren’t going there. It was him on the phone and he said, ‘You’re not going to believe what just happened to me!’ And I’m like, ‘What?’ He says, ‘I went out in the yard because all these cops were going by.’ I said, ‘I know, I just came up the hill. Where did they all go?’ He said he didn’t know, but he walked out into the yard to see where they were going, lit up a cigarette. ‘I’m standing there and I see a helicopter, right? coming down.’ I go, ‘No way!’ He goes, ‘Yeah, why?’ I said, ‘Tim, I was coming up the hill when all those cops went by and I saw the same thing you saw. Was it making any noise?’ He goes, ‘Oh, it was weird! It didn’t make sound.’ He saw the exact same thing I saw. The only difference is that he thought he saw lights on it. It was the evening and the sun was setting, and it would have been up high enough to reflect some light. But Tim swears to God that it looked like it had two headlights on it and moving back and forth, like looking, like snooping.’ I go, ‘Really?’ He says, ‘Yeah, and then it stopped and took off going that way.’ He would have been closer than I was, but he was underneath it. He was down at the lake level. And I’m several hundred feet above him on the hill and the craft was about level with me. When it went took off, it was probably closer to him than it was me and Tim said he could see air through the bottom of it. And it had the nose, the exact same thing. Tim's Perspective from Below the Aerial Craft So, Tim came over and we just kind of drew it. I tried to draw what Tim was telling me. It’s a torn, black hard board that I use for scratch paper, basically. UP THERE ON THE FAR RIGHT, IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE’S PHOTOGRAPHS IN 2007 OF WHAT WE’RE CALLING THE DRAGONFLY DRONES BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY MOVE . The one at the top is what Tim saw – that’s what he said he could see from the lake. I drew it for him, I did the airbrush for him. But see, he was underneath the craft."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"B rent Yearout airbrushed as Tim described what he saw from below the aerial object that had four appendages on one side, one on the other side and a long, flat “nose.” Airbrush sketch © 2007 by Brent Yearout. Brent Yearout's Perspective Looking Sideways At the Aerial Craft A irbrushed sketches on torn work board of strange aerial craft seen from the side by Brent Yearout (brighter white object) and from underneath by his friend, Tim, (top center ring with appendages) on June 7, 2007, in Camas, Washington. Airbrushed images © 2007 by Brent Yearout. What I saw from where I was at was like the big one I air brushed with the lightning coming out of it. I was on the side of it. Tim was below it. THAT’S WHY HE COULD SEE MORE OF THE APPENDAGES. Right, and that’s why he said he could see more than one thing sticking out the back. When the thing took off, I thought all those things rotated, but I was looking at it from the side. And I told Tim, ‘I remember it looked like it had some bent antennas on it.’ He said, ‘What do you mean?’ I said, ‘It’s got an antenna or something on top. I saw an antenna , but it looked like it was bent.’ And I thought that was really weird."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"We sat there with an airbrush and I’d paint a little and then he’d try a little bit. I did one sort of front on like he thought with the lights. And then I was playing with it and I had been doing lightning airbrush on this car. And I’m going, ‘I could smell ozone.’ And we kept talking about the cracking sound and comparing it to electrical popping or a speaker square-waving. And I said, ‘I don’t know why, but I just feel like lightning and electricity and I drew the lightning through it. Size of Strange Craft ON THIS PARTICULAR OBJECT THAT YOU AND TIM SAW THAT SEEMS TO BE VERY SIMILAR TO THE DRONES THAT PEOPLE WERE SEEING IN MAY and JUNE 2007, WHAT DO THE TWO OF YOU ESTIMATE WAS THE LENGTH OF WHAT YOU SAW AND HEIGHT OF WHAT YOU SAW? It was not very thick. It was very thin top to bottom. But it was long. If I was to take the ring, the top of my car would probably fit in it and I drive a 4-door. So, I would say the whole thing was probably 40 feet long with the appendages included. Body-wise, I would say the circular part of it – the ring – was maybe 8, 10, 12 feet across. HOW THICK WOULD IT BE? I’m going to have to say a foot maybe? Maybe two feet thick at the most. REALLY THIN! Really thin. It looked like all the appendages in the back came together in the back or something and the nose rotated and they all came together. Then it looked like an arrow. If this thing was propelling itself with some sort of thrust that was keeping it up above the water of the lake where I saw it, there would have been some motion in the water. But the water was glass-smooth. Odd Stop and Start \"Dragonfly\" Motion WHAT’S THE STRANGEST PART OF WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT? The noise and the way the thing rotated and moved because it was really like mechanical. That’s what got me. The eeriest thing about it though, to be honest with you, was the fact I could not explain it to myself! THAT VERY STRANGE MECHANICAL MOTION IS WHY IN 2007 SOME PEOPLE USED THE METAPHOR IN THE BEGINNING: ‘YOU KNOW HOW DRAGONFLIES STOP AND START?’ That’s how it flew – like a dragonfly – zzzz – zzz – zzz – zzz - That jerky motion. Yeah, that’s how it moved, the way a dragonfly stops on a dime and just sit there and hover. That’s what it was like. And I’m thinking, ‘This is not right.’ That’s when it did its little rotating thing. I can’t say for sure that the appendages rotated and the ring stayed still, but it sure appeared to be that way. HOW HIGH WAS THIS OBJECT OVER THE WATER? I’d say 200 feet high. IT’S 200 FEET ABOVE THE WATER AND HOW FAR FROM YOU? 150 yards. A LITTLE MORE THAN A FOOTBALL FIELD AWAY. Yes, not far. It was just right even with my window in my car. And the way it took off, the first thing I tried to tell myself and I asked Tim, ‘Could you see through the bottom of it?’ When it went off in that direction into the Gorge, that was closest to Tim. He said it was moving too fast for him to see up through the thing clearly, but he knew it was hollow. HOW CLOSE DO YOU THINK TIM WAS? Well, at first he was probably farther away from where I first saw it when it stopped. But Tim had a perfectly clear view of it where it stopped and rotated. He was probably half a mile away. The craft was above the lake and Tim has a perfect dead view of the lake right"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"there. He can look right up the lake and where the craft rotated, it went back up towards the hills where it came from basically, but it went East and right up past the Camas High School, like right over the top of it and then boom! it was gone. So Tim was closer to it when it took off than I was. But in the beginning, he was probably a half-mile away. When it took off, it went right towards his house and over the Camas High School, which is only four blocks away from Tim’s house. Did Camas “Dragonfly” Have Curved Wires Rising from Ring? IN ALL OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF 2007, THERE IS A SORT OF CROWN OF WIRES THAT CURVE COMING UP OUT OF THE RING. DID YOU AND TIM SEE THAT AS CLEARLY (Brent does have faint curves rising above his sketch)? Well, I saw one, what I thought was one antenna on it is what I was thinking. But again, from my angle – and I was looking from the side – I was looking for something that was propelling it. I didn’t care there was a wire on top, but I was looking for suspension wires. I was looking for a propeller in the ring and that the whole thing might be radio-controlled. But Tim could see through the ring and there was nothing there. It does not make sense. It’s impossible! So, we agreed at that time (June 7, 2007) that instead of telling anybody about it, let’s just shut up because people will think we’re retards, you know?! (laughs) Tim, who is more into electronics said it sounded like a speaker square-waving. A square-wave can make an ungodly sound. I told him it sounded to me like a TV late at night when you wake up and it’s going ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ (makes loud static sound) and really super loud! [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - A square wave is a kind of non-sinusoidal waveform, most typically encountered in electronics and signal processing. An ideal square wave alternates regularly and instantaneously between two levels. Origins and Uses Square waves are universally encountered in digital switching circuits and are naturally generated by binary (two-level) logic devices. They are used as timing references or \"clocks,\" because their fast transitions are suitable for triggering synchronous logic circuits at precisely determined intervals. However, square waves contain a wide range of harmonics; these can generate electromagnetic radiation or pulses of current that interfere with other nearby circuits, causing noise or errors. To avoid this problem in very sensitive circuits such as precision analog-to-digital converters, sine waves are used instead of square waves as timing references. Additionally, the distortion effect used on electric guitar clips the outermost regions of the waveform, causing it to increasingly resemble a square wave as more distortion is applied.] That’s why I couldn’t believe that nobody else has seen it or said anything about it. Maybe everyone has the same idea I did – some things are better left unsaid! Loud Static Versus Low Hiss WHAT’S INTERESTING IS THAT ALL OF THE OTHER SIGHTINGS IN WHICH THERE WERE PHOTOGRAPHS, EVERYONE SAID THEY EITHER COULD NOT HEAR ANYTHING OR THEY HEARD, IN CHAD’S CASE, A KIND OF HISSING SOUND. Oh, he did hear something? YES, AND HE EMAILED ME ASKING IF I THOUGHT THERE WAS ANY DANGER FROM WHATEVER THEY WERE EMITTING THAT HAD ELECTROSTATIC SOUND, BUT NOT LOUD. Plasma Propulsion?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"P lasma ball. Have you ever seen one of those plasma balls? They have the electrostatic arcs inside that go out. Well, that’s what I kind of felt like that the thing was emitting plasma or something and that is what is keeping it afloat. And I smelled what I thought was ozone. IF THESE OBJECTS ARE SOMETHING THAT OUR GOVERNMENT HAS EITHER BACK-ENGINEERED OR PRODUCED ... I’m going to be pissed! ... WHAT DO YOU THINK THEIR MISSION IS? I don’t know. Can I tell you what I felt about it all along? I’m really good about having feelings towards stuff. It’s worked out really good for me in the stock market, so I’ll tell you right now. I almost felt like the thing was prospecting. It was like a research vehicle. It’s looking for something. They are looking for gold is what I thought. IF THESE DRAGONFLY DRONES ARE NOT MADE BY OUR GOVERNMENT OR ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT ON EARTH AND ARE IN FACT ARE SOME KIND OF MONITORING DEVICE FROM SOME OTHER PLACE... Some place else? YES. HOW DOES THAT LEAVE YOU THINKING AND FEELING? I’m concerned about the whole situation a little bit because I know that whatever it was, I felt like it was aware that I was watching it. And it knew I could see it. I felt like it knew I was looking at it. And I felt like this thing knows that I’m looking at it and it knows it can be seen and it did not like it, OK? And it wanted to get out of there. When I said it was looking for something, real fidgety back and forth – it was like it was looking for a place to run. And if it is something from somewhere else, we’re being surveyed. Those are surveyors and I don’t know what they are looking for, but I think they are prospecting for something. If it is somebody surveying from another world, I guess they’ve got the right idea because they are making it so we can’t see them.” Email from Chicago, Illinois, “Drone” Eyewitness After the Camas, Washington, report was filed at Earthfiles, I received this eyewtiness account by email on May 23, 2008, about a sighting on New Years Eve, December 31, 2005. “Subject: Drone in downtown Chicago 2005 Date: May 23, 2008 12:44:10 AM MDT To : earthfiles@earthfiles.com Linda Moulton Howe, I read about the dragonfly drones on your site and it reminded me of an experience i had 3 years ago. On New Years Eve in 2005, My wife and I decided to go downtown chicago and get a room at the \"W\" hotel on Lakeshore Drive."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"My parents were in town to watch our daughter at our condo. We were planning on getting away for the night, drinking some champagne and ringing in the new year. After a meal and a few drinks (2 or 3 glasses of champagne) we went back to the room around 10:30 or so. As my wife was getting changed, i was standing looking out of the window, which I believe was facing south, making lake michigan on my left. I was looking into the other lit windows of the high-rises around, people watching... when i saw something that looked like it was hanging on the side of a building maybe 2 blocks away. I thought at first it was a window washing scaffold, but noticed it was moving slowly up towards the right side of the building at a 45 degree angle. I realized what I was looking at was an object with a tail hovering unattached to the building. The tail pointed away from the building. It was not even close to looking like a helicopter as it had voids at the top and bottom i could see with no rotors, or cockpit. I saw it for about a full 2 minutes before it \"sparkled\" and de-materialized right before it turned the corner. I couldn't believe what i saw. i yelled for my wife to come look but she couldn't get there in time. The photos i have seen of dragon fly drones on your website are similar, although i think this one was about the size of a Volkswagen beetle, judging by the size of the glass on the building. When it \"sparkled\" it was faint, and definitely not like a firecracker. It flickered a few times before fading out. The skin itself was a weird charcoal greyish matte finish, but there was definitely an underlying glow to it, that drew my attention there in the first place. I had the impression this object was looking into the windows as well, but being very stealthy. It was an odd experience. I have never seen anything like that. I was wondering if you had received any other sightings like this. It seems most have been in rural areas. This was right downtown Chicago. Maybe others saw it as well?” If any Earthfiles viewer has any more information about the aerial dragonfly drones, or has seen one, please email me at earthfiles@earthfiles.com More Information: F or further information about dragonfly-moving drones, please see related Earthfiles reports below in the Earthfiles Archives : • 04/04/2008 — Wingless, “Dragonfly” Sighting On March 31, 2008 • 03/21/2008 — Part 1: Dragonfly-Shaped Aerial Craft: Current Media Misinformation Versus Eyewitnesses 1987 to 2007 • 03/21/2008 — Part 2, Dragonfly-Shaped Aerial Craft: Current Media Misinformation Versus Eyewitnesses 1987 to 2007 • 03/09/2008 — Viewer Comments About Drone Mystery and Homeland Security Ban?
