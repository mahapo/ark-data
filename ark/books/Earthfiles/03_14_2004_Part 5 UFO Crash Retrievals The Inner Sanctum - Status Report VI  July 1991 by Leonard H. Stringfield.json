These status reports were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Status Report VII begins at Earthfiles 12/15/03 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Len Stringfield - continued: THE BLUE ROOM Now, we take another step into the \"breached\" Inner Sanctum's wall. For this report, we recapture the experience of one person with the right access clearance to a \"Blue Room.\" Its location is secret. The room was a veritable museum holding the artifacts of crashed saucers and the retrieved cadavers from Roswell. My cooperative, but cautious, intermediary is a retired Army officer of high rank who got the information firsthand from an equally cautious source. I have edited the following report, as requested, to conceal the identification of both my friend and his source. Retired U. S. Army Officer: \"I will describe this to you as it was told to me. My source sometime ago related an incident to me that leads me to question the 'official' government position on their research into UFO/IAC activity. In 1955, as a scientific research analyst, he was working in Texas upgrading several radar installations. His main duties included the supervision of upgrades and field testing of new equipment. He had from time to time been called in to investigate 'bogies' encountered by various groups. This apparently led to the following incident. One evening during dinner, an MP (military police) pulled into the drive and informed him that he had to go with him. This was not an unusual event and he thought nothing of it at the time. As was typical, he was not allowed to pack or was he informed of his destination or the duration of the 'trip.' He was taken to a local AFB and there held in a secure area with others involved in various fields of technical research. Many of these individuals were known to him and numbered in the mid-twenties. The first order of business was the signing Secrecy Non-Disclosure papers. Again, none of this was out of the ordinary as he had been involved in compartment-tinted missions since his day sin the Navy. They were told that the purpose of the mission would be discussed only when they arrived on site and there was to be no discussion, even among themselves, until so ordered. This is when the tone of the situation changed. Their pockets were emptied into marked envelopes and they were frisked. They were then led to an aircraft and seated along with armed military guards. My source related to me that he did not recognize the insignia on their uniforms and it consisted of numbers only. None of the guards had ID labels on their blouses and none of them spoke to the passengers for the duration of the flight. Just before landing, they were each given a black hood and told that removing them before told to do so would result in 'never being seen again.' When asked if he was kidding, the Colonel in charge merely said, 'Try me.' After the plane landed, they were told to don their hoods and place their hands on the shoulders of the man in front of them. (He could only guess at the flight time because their watches were confiscated before departure, but felt that it might have been about four hours. Then again, he said they might have just flown around in circles for some time.) As they de-planed, he could see the ground by tilting his head down. He noticed that "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"as they left the runway, the area was 'sandy' and the air felt like the coolness of a desert evening. The shadows he could see on the ground led him to believe that it was indeed night (further accenting his sense of elapsed time), as there were shadows apparently cast by artificial lighting. As they were led, he tells that two of the men had evidently raised their hoods and were told, 'You shouldn't have done that.' He heard what he thought were handcuffs being ratcheted and the men led away. (Two analysts that he had worked with who had been at the airport were indeed never seen again and their families moved away before they returned home. Any questions regarding their whereabouts were answered with, 'You want the same thing?'). After a short walk, they encountered concrete and as they stopped, he heard a hangar door brought down behind them. After a muffled discussion between two disembodied voices (one quite angry, after being told 'there were two violations' and that 'no, they wouldn't be included or questioned.') they were told to remove their hoods. At this point, my source's voice always quivered when he tells the story (he has told it to me on five occasions without change and so far as I know, he has related it to no one else.) When they removed their hoods, they were inside a converted aircraft hangar in which floor and walls were entirely painted blue. Around the room were tables, shelves and fixtures holding thousands of artifacts, none of which were immediately recognizable. They were told that they were to study each object and determine its purpose, operating parameters, and whether or not it could be duplicated. Looking back, he now recognizes many things such as lasers, integrated circuits, printed circuit boards of now commonplace design (including microprocessors and surface mount components). They were on site for approximately four days, took their meals and sleep there. They were allowed to ask any questions necessary to complete their task, and the 'curator' (as he described himself) was pleased when one of them finally asked where the artifacts came from. They were led to a small locked room that they had heretofore not seen, and were shown four large aquariums filled with a pink solution, each containing a small body of gray skin, oversized cranium, huge eyes, no hair. In the back of this room were pieces of metal, ranging from slivers to very large twisted chunks. The curator then related the story of the Roswell crash. When they had been debriefed days later, they were told that they could return any time and discuss the objects with anyone as long as it was done in a hypothetical sense and no identifying data were disseminated. A year or so ago, he contacted this group and asked if the offer was still good. He was told that indeed it was and that the collection had grown tremendously. The philosophy was that no one would believe the story unless supporting evidence was included and that would result in dire consequences.\" THE ROSWELL BITS & PIECES Since the Moore and Berlitz book, The Roswell Incident (1980), I have received a number of letters and phone calls from low-profile sources who offer cryptic morsels about the Roswell affair. Some, as I recall, were allegedly firsthand, though most were through the grapevine. Most all were not heard from again. That's normal, regardless of the topic, in this business. As one researcher, Paul Smith of Riverside, California, told me in his letter of February 20, 1984, \"I find it interesting that people are willing to offer tantalizing tidbits to the UFO puzzle, but when it comes down to show and tell, it's 99.9% tell, but no show.\" One letter, however, is worth quoting in part for a couple of reasons as it refers to Roswell and to Dr. Hynek. It came to me from Chuck Harder, commentator for the radio program For the People , aired nationally from Cedar Key, Florida. Signed by Norman Richards, the letter at first recounts a UFO sighting over Japan in August 1947, by many members of his regiment of the 25th Tropic Lightning Division. He goes on to say that General Douglas MacArthur ordered an investigation. According to a story later published in The Pacific Stars and Stripes, the \"huge silver disc\" remained unexplained. Richards then goes on to relate: Norman Richards: \"In 1950, I was in the ROTC program of the Air Force at Indiana University. We were sent to Lowry Air Force Base for six weeks training that summer. One day, we had a lecture by a colonel from Wright-Patterson AFB. He outlined many changes and new experimental aircraft being tested. During the question and answer session, he was asked if UFOs were real. He got very excited and said we had better believe it. He went on to tell us of the crash and retrieval of the parts and the humanoids found at the site. He said they were under investigation at Wright-Patterson after being flown from Roswell, New Mexico. The pieces were of a material unknown to us - the humanoids he described were much like those"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"depicted on the TV show, Unsolved Mysteries. \"I was in Lubbock, Texas, in the year the Sputnik frightened the world. One night, a UFO landed between Lubbock and Amarillo. Many police, elected officials and other reputable people reported what they had seen on local radio, TV and in the newspapers. I corresponded with J. Allen Hynek at Northwestern University and he wrote me confirming all three occurrences. (Italics mine, Len Stringfield). I prefer to believe that Hynek was being over-graciously accommodating if, indeed, he had \"confirmed\" the Roswell bodies at Wright-Patterson AFB. I have no address for Norman Richards for a follow-up. And finally, a word from an investigative journalist, Jim Marrs, author of the book Crossfire , published in 1989. This popular book ties together all the loose ends of evidence about President Kennedy's assassination and leaves little doubt about a government cover-up hiding the real facts. Learning of Marrs's more-than-casual interest in UFOs from researcher William Jones of Columbus, Ohio, I called the author for details. His letter of April 1, 1991, is quoted in part, as follows: Jim Marrs: \"... I was aviation/aerospace writer for the Ft. Worth Star Telegram from approximately 1970-1980. During this time, I also was the primary writer on military matters. During this decade, on at least two occasions, I met men who claimed to have been stationed at Ft. Worth Air Force Base in 1947. Both men told me how the rumors flew around the base after several pieces of strange metal (some covered with writing similar to hieroglyphics) were brought to the base from a New Mexico crash-site. Reportedly, this metal was from a disc-shaped device which crashed near Roswell, New Mexico, sometime in early July 1947. There also were rumors that dead crew members had been recovered and sent to Wright Field. ... \"It is indeed unfortunate that I did not fully interview these two men at the time. ...I mention these two only because they told me they were at the base during the time in question and that the incident indeed occurred.\" During our phone discussion, Marrs was quick to put down the rumor that the assassination involved a Secret Service agent who turned from the front seat of the presidential limousine to fire the fatal shot. As the rumor goes, Kennedy was the target because he planned to release the real UFO story to the public. I saw the movie sequence reputedly showing the agent firing at Kennedy and heard all the rumors for years and gave them no credence. Crossfire, however, jam-packed with a collection of startling data, is blunt about the probability of high-level political involvement in a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy and even suggests the complicity of certain loose-cannon characters within the CIA, FBI and the Secret Service who might have used the criminal world to do the trigger work. If this kind of twisted word is true, then where would the UFO fit if there is something to gain or to lose by hiding the truth? While I have always respected these agencies for their unheralded good work, they do in their respective fields, I am also aware that each has played an undercover role in UFO affairs. But, frankly, it is only in the world of rumor and hearsay have I heard of their use of extreme measures to control UFO secrecy. Continued in Part 6.
