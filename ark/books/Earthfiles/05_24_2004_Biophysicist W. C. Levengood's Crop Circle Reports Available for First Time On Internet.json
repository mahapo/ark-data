Levengood's Crop Circle Reports Available for First Time On Internet © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, in his Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, Grass Lake, Michigan. Photograph by Linda Moulton Howe. May 24, 2004 Grass Lake, Michigan - Biophysicist W. C. Levengood is convinced that whatever causes the crop circle phenomenon uses a rapid and intense energy which produces cell changes in affected plants. By the summer of 2000, Levengood had studied plants from at least three hundred crop formations in Israel, Australia, Canada, the United States, England and Holland. He found a repeating pattern of biochemical and biophysical changes in formation plants and magnetic anomalies in soils which lead him to conclude that what was interacting with crop formation plants and soil was 'a spinning plasma vortex.' But what was creating the vortices? Now, American crop formation investigator Jeffrey Wilson and cropcirclenews.com are scanning nearly two hundred of biophysicist Levengood's original Pinelandia Lab reports about biochemical and biophysical changes Levengood has studied in the plants and soil of genuinely mysterious crop patterns. To study Levengood's work as it is scanned and archived, go to Cropcirclenews.com . This section is for articles provided by Mr. Levengood, copied by Dr. Charles Lietzau and Jeffrey Wilson, and scanned by Gene Thomas. The following is an excerpt about W. C. Levengood's crop circle research from my book, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles. \"Scientific Evidence That Cannot Be Hoaxed Biophysicist Levengood has analyzed hundreds and hundreds of plants from crop formations in his own curiosity about what unusual energies are interacting with the plants to produce some of the biochemical and biophysical changes he has confirmed in his laboratory. In his own words, he says that 'a spinning plasma vortex with a microwave component and complex lower energy ion-electron pulses' have interacted with many formation plants he has studied. He also asserts that the energy interaction that creates formations must occur rapidly, in a few seconds. Otherwise, he would find evidence of burning or charring from the microwave heating. But he does not find such damage, and the formation plants continue to live and grow until harvest. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Those biochemical and biophysical changes that Levengood has documented include a combination of swollen and reoriented growth nodes, ruptured growth nodes, metabolism changes in plant cells and magnetic iron particles deposited over the plant surfaces and surrounding soil. Levengood published his research in a 1999 international journal, Physiologia Plantarum (105:615-624). He wrote, 'The findings reported here lend further support to a decade of research with empirical data which suggests that over 95% of worldwide crop formations (he has studied) involve organized ion plasma vortices that deliver lower atmosphere energy components of sufficient magnitude to produce significant bending, expansion and formation of unique expulsion cavities in plant stem pulvini (swelling at base of leaf stalk), as well as significant changes in seedling development.'

The Blue Ball, Maryland plants from 1995 averaged 130% to 200% node lengthening and dramatic reorientation from the normal straight vertical. The cause is thought to be rapid heating and expansion by microwave energies which collapse the cell tissue in the upper nodes and produce the angled reorientation. Nodes on wheat stems closer to the ground have tougher, more mature tissue. Levengood thinks that water-cell components in those lower growth nodes build up pressure and, like safety valves, literally burst open to create what he calls 'expulsion cavities.' Sixty-five to eighty-five percent of the Blue Ball, Maryland wheat formation plants contained expulsion cavities, while none were found in the control plants from outside the downed crop. The photographs below show an excellent contrast between four exploded growth nodes from a wheat formation in Logan, Utah in August 1996, compared to normal control plants.

'There is no way that wind or air motion from a helicopter or pressure from boards, feet or string could produce these biochemical and biophysical changes,' Levengood said. 'The plants have been affected by an intense energy.' In addition to these fundamental biophysical and biochemical changes in the wheat plant themselves, Levengood has also studied plants from England and the United States that have been coated with a deposit of iron oxide, hematite and magnetite, that he believes are fused particles of meteoritic origin. Cherhill, Wiltshire, England, 1993. Semi-molten magnetic iron deposited on wheat leaf and shows imprint of leaf's epidermal cell structure. Photograph © 1993 by W. C. Levengood. ... Over 70% of approximately forty crop formations Levengood has investigated with magnet drags turn up iron deposits on the surface of the soil. ...Levengood has found high concentrations of magnetic iron in many crop formations, occasionally more than 700 times higher concentrations than the normal 0.4 milligrams of magnetite per gram of soil. Further, soil samples continue to confirm distribution (of the magnetite) by centrifugal spinning force.\" Biophysicist Levengood contemplates past research about the known natural forces of spiral auroras which originate in spiral electric fields of the magnetosphere and map down along geomagnetic field lines into the ionosphere. Then he wonders if such spiral electric fields in the magnetosphere could be linked to whatever force interacts with cereal crops around the world to create geometric and other patterns. \"Is it possible that a pair of these downward directed, counterclockwise plasma vortices intersected and captured meteoric dust along the way, which in turn, was maintained or heated back to a semi-molten state by the microwaves of sub-vortices which carried it to the ground with its subsequent crop flattening energies? If so, this would indicate a heretofore unknown phenomenon of ionospheric plasma vortices descending to the Earth's surface.\" More Information: William C. Levengood received his B. S. in Physics and Mathematics from the University of Toledo, Ohio in 1957; M. A. Bioscience, Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana, 1961; M. S. in Biophysics, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan in 1970 and completed all work for Ph.D. in Biophysics at the University of Michigan, except final thesis review. He worked as an Associate Research Physicist at the University of Michigan from 1961 to 1968 and was Director of Biophysical Research Sensors, Inc., in Ann Arbor from 1970 to 1976. W. C. Levengood holds nearly a dozen patents, including seed analyzers and growth enhancement technology. From 1976 to 1983, Levengood owned Agro Sciences, Inc., in Ann Arbor. Since 1987, he has worked independently in his Grass Lake, Michigan Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, contributing greatly to better understanding physical evidence in the crop formation and animal mutilation phenomena.
