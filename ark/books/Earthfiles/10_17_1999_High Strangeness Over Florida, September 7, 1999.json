Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon High Strangeness Over Florida, September 7, 1999 © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe October 17, 1999 Sarasota, Florida Last month on September 7th, Florida residents between Tampa and Sarasota called police and the media to report unusual aerial lights before and after 5 o'clock in the morning. NASA got a lot of calls, too, and told everyone that the mystery lights were actually a Russian rocket booster falling through the atmosphere and disintegrating over the Gulf of Mexico. NASA said the Russians had launched a communications satellite atop an SL-12 booster on Monday, September 6th, and that the SL-12's disintegration was expected. Major Michael Birmingham at the Space Command Headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado told reporters: \"The orbital path of the booster took it over the United States. It's not unusual. We, the United States and Russia, warn each other of any launch and of any object that may re-enter so it's not mistaken for a warhead.\" Major Birmingham said between sixty and eighty used rocket boosters disintegrate in the atmosphere each year, but rarely hit earth or the ocean. He explained that \"anything going 17,000 mph when it hits the atmosphere most likely burns up\" before it gets to ground or water. One possible eyewitness to the rocket break up might have been Deputy Lynn Taylor with the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office where he has worked for twenty-nine years. But Deputy Taylor is confused because the object he watched was going west to east from the ocean over the land and then made a 90 degree turn south along the coast line. His patrol car computer clock said it was exactly 5:03 AM EST when he first saw the odd light. NASA stated the Russian booster rocket broke up between 5:01 and 5:03 AM. Interview: High Strangeness Event Over Tampa to Sarasota, Florida, 4:50-5:05 a.m., September 7, 1999 Lynn Taylor, Deputy Sheriff in Special Operations for the Sarasota County Sheriff's Office, Sarasota, Florida : \"I see this light like a big spot light. And I said, 'I wonder what's going on?' I didn't hear anything on the radio, but it must be our helicopter checking the area. This thing, after I got out of the car, I realized, 'Hell, this is not a helicopter!' This thing is coming from the northwest, and it doesn't seem to be in any big hurry. And it's coming and it's coming and it's coming. And I said, 'What in the name of goodness is that?' And I stood there and looked at it for maybe ten or fifteen seconds. And it's coming straight at me. And what I thought would be just about parallel with the shoreline, it turns south on the shoreline and it just accelerated. And as it accelerated, I pick my binoculars up and say, 'What in the hell is that?' Excuse my language, but that's exactly what I said. And I pick my binoculars up I had right in the seat and put on it and it was, it hurt my eyes to look through the binoculars. And then it had accelerated and it "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"looked like big chunks of fire was blowing out the back of it, almost like rocks, big fireball rocks. And I said, 'I've never seen anything like that in my life!' SO THIS DEFINITELY DID NOT HAVE A STEADY DESCENT TOWARDS THE GROUND OR THE WATER? Oh, absolutely not. It came from west to east to the shoreline and then turned and ran along the shoreline south. And people ninety miles away reported seeing the same thing I saw. Huge, Blimp-like Craft Near Myakka River State Park TEN MINUTES BEFORE DEPUTY TAYLOR'S SIGHTING AND BEFORE NASA'S TWO MINUTE TIME WINDOW OF 5:01 TO 5:03 AM FOR THE BREAK UP OF THE RUSSIAN BOOSTER, AT LEAST TWO EYEWITNESSES SAW A HUGE BLIMP-LIKE CRAFT. ROBERT RUSSELL WAS DRIVING FROM HIS HOME IN PORT CHARLOTTE, FLORIDA TO WORK IN SARASOTA AT THE FIRST UNITED METHODIST CHURCH WHERE HE IS IN MAINTENANCE. WHAT HE SAW WAS HEADED SLOWLY WEST TOWARDS THE GULF IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF DEPUTY TAYLOR'S LIGHT AND NOT FAR FROM THE MYAKKA RIVER STATE PARK, A NATURE PRESERVE. Robert Russell, Maintenance Employee, First United Methodist Church, Sarasota, Florida: \"It was approximately ten minutes of five on that morning of the 7th. I was heading northbound on I-75 heading towards Sarasota, Florida. I was between Exits 33 and 35 and I happened to look to my left. I seen what I thought was a jetliner flying very low. And I thought it was going to crash. So, I pulled to the right hand side and I jumped out of the truck and watched and listened. I couldn't hear any noise, but as this thing was flying or hovering, I could see like a light. It was not fire. It was like light and I could see the outline of the passenger windows, but I couldn't see any wings. I sort of thought, 'It's not a plane.' So, I thought it might be a blimp flying back from the holidays. We had just had the holidays the day before. MEANING LABOR DAY? Right. But there was no noise whatsoever. I couldn't hear no wind hitting the wings of the plane and it was low enough so I should have been able to hear the whishing of the wind or whatever if the thing had wings.

It was hovering. And it had, I could see that it had a blinking light on the front and a blinking light on the back. And I know for sure that the back light was blue blinking. WHAT COLOR BLUE? I guess a... COMPARE IT TO THE SKY. A dark blue. A DARK BLUE LIGHT IN THE BACK. And I think it was a white light in the front, but I'm not very sure on that. It was heading towards the Gulf of Mexico. It was heading I guess you would say west. YOU'RE HEADING WHICH DIRECTION? I was heading north. I looked over to my left and that's where I seen it. It was a glow around this thing also. And they are saying that it was this Russian rocket coming back into the earth's surface burning. It was not fire. I'm also a retired firefighter from Baltimore, Maryland. And I know what fire looks like. And it was not fire. This was a light. IT HAD GLOW AROUND IT? Right, it had a glow around it. THE COLOR OF THE GLOW AROUND IT WAS WHAT? Like a yellow. A YELLOW GLOW AROUND AN OBJECT THAT WAS LOW ENOUGH FOR YOU TO SEE THAT IT HAD A CIGAR SHAPE... Right, it looked like a fuselage of a jetliner. WITHOUT WINGS. Yeah, without wings. YOU COULD SEE WHAT APPEARED TO BE WINDOWS ON THE SIDE? Right. DID YOU PULL YOUR CAR OVER TO WATCH THIS? I did. HOW LONG DID YOU WATCH? I was there a good five minutes and it looked like it was just a standstill to a point, but I could tell it was drifting a little bit. But it wasn't moving as fast as they are saying these rockets supposed to be burning. THAT SOVIET BREAK UP. Exactly. IT SEEMS LIKE THAT THERE COULD BE POSSIBLY TWO OR MORE EVENTS TAKING PLACE SIMULTANEOUSLY. AND DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME, APPROXIMATELY HOW HIGH DO YOU THINK IT WAS? I'd say a thousand feet, maybe more. But it's hard to say as dark as it was. But I was able to see the passenger, the outline of the diagonal and windows in this thing. WHAT DID THE WINDOWS LOOK LIKE? OK, they looked like an arched window with an orange-yellowish glow in them. And the glow was coming all around this object flying or floating. YOU HAD AN ORANGE-YELLOWISH GLOW ARO UND THIS CIGAR SHAPED OBJECT AND YOU SAW WINDOWS ALONG THE SIDE. Approximately three windows."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"WITH ONLY THREE GLOWING WINDOWS THAT WOULD NOT BE A TYPICAL AIRLINER. Right. But then I thought it might have been a blimp.\" A Huge \"Spaceship\" THE SAME TIME THAT ROBERT RUSSELL HAD PULLED OFF THE ROAD TO WATCH THE MYSTERIOUS \"BLIMP,\" ANOTHER EYEWITNESS WHO WISHES TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS AND WHOM I WILL CALL \"GERALD,\" WAS A FEW MILES EAST OF THE MYAKKA STATE PARK. FIRST, HE SAW A BRIGHT STAR THAT SUDDENLY SEEMED TO GROW TO THE SIZE OF A SILVER DOLLAR AND THEN SOME HOW BECAME WHAT GERALD CALLS, \"A HUGE SPACESHIP\" ABOUT 300 FEET FROM HIS PICKUP TRUCK. Gerald (anonymous), Between Arcadia and Sarasota, Florida: \"After I noticed the little, what I thought was a star at first, and in just a matter of twenty or thirty seconds, here's a spaceship - I'm going to say 300 or 400 feet off to my left. It was really weird because there was no seeing it coming at a distance. All of a sudden, it was there, off to my left and in front. When I seen the spaceship, I immediately slowed down and pulled over which didn't take me long because I run about 50 or 55 mph. I slowed down right away and pulled over. As it comes up to me and is parallel about 300 or 400 feet, there is a big beam of light coming off the back of it. This thing is like it's blimp shaped, only that part is covered up looking out the window of my truck. I mean you're looking at something that was because I'm used to playing football that was like a football and a half field long, maybe longer. AT LEAST 600 FEET LONG. It was humongous! And as it's kind of floating down toward me, coming toward me and gets parallel, there's this big beam of light. I'm going to say and it was kind of intense because it was like looking at about six feet in diameter coming off the back of it to the ground. The light never come towards me or anything, just shining straight down to the ground off the back of the ship. WHAT COLOR WAS THAT BEAM OF LIGHT? Like a regular light bulb type of light only it wasn't, it was a direct, it was like a, it didn't spread out and light things up. It just lit the beam up. IT WAS LIKE A TUBE OF LIGHT? Ye s , m a a m . LIKE THE TUBE WAS LIGHTED WITHIN ITSELF, BUT WAS NOT SHINING OUT ON THE GROUND? I couldn't really tell because about the time it started floating in like that, I had pulled over I rubbed my eyes to make sure I wasn't, I rubbed my eyes twice through this ordeal making sure I was awake! And I was awake. DID THE BLIMP PART EVER GO PHYSICALLY ONTO THE GROUND? No. Never did. HOW HIGH DO YOU THINK IT WAS ABOVE THE GROUND? Probably somewhere 200 to 300 feet. WAS THE BEAM FROM THAT 200 TO 300 FEET EXTENDING ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE GROUND? I couldn't really tell if it was hitting the ground or not because there was some bushes along the edge of the road, and I couldn't see, you know, the ground if it was lit up or what was going on with the ground."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"IN THE BLIMP ITSELF FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER, WHAT COLORS WERE YOU SEEING. DESCRIBE AS MUCH DETAIL AS POSSIBLE. Well, it was either windows or lights. I'm going to say it was windows, as close as I was looking at it. And they were running the length of the ship. They were, it seemed like there was four or five feet between each of these narrow lights, like five inches. WERE THEY LONG VERTICAL TYPE WINDOWS? Long horizontal. Five or six of them. All I do know is they were narrow and they had a blue, hazy light coming out of them. It reminded me kind of like when they have dry ice and they have these shows and they have dry ice - that kind of hazy, blue light coming out of it. IN BETWEEN EACH ONE OF THEM, WAS IT BLACK OR A COLOR? I really can't tell you, because the spaceship was kind of a brown-blackish color. And it all kind of blended. I could see like what would have been rectangular tubing as we see it running on the skin of the ship ever so often. This was all kind of a greenish-black. It looked to me to be part of the structure of the ship. It was like we would use it for bracing. What they were using it for, I don't know, but it was, every I would have to sit down and draw it but I was close enough that I could see that it was running the length of the ship and there were cross pieces in this that were about the same size. And part of it is that it's so overwhelming, you know. You've got a lot to think about when and when I was sitting there watching the ship, it started drifting towards me, getting closer. And I thought, 'I don't know about this.' So, then I kind of pulled back on the road real slow. I didn't take off like I would normally take off, just kind of took off. And the ship backed off. And as he was backing off, he must have got about to his original position where he first started out as being parallel to me. And then, it was for a split second and this is hard to believe the ship was gone. The light was there for like a split second and that was it!\" More Information: Blimp Pilot Comments: Andrew Shelton, an aviation maintenance technician, who has piloted a 200-foot-long blimp in Florida told me that \"airships do not have any windows on the envelope\" which carries the gas that keeps the blimp aloft. The much smaller passenger compartment or gondola is suspended beneath the bottom of the cigar-shaped gas envelope. Further, he said that blimps \"will never operate in darkness over residences and a state park because it's too dangerous. If they did have a mechanical problem and needed to land, they wouldn't be able to select a safe place. Blimpses are easily damaged, so you would not fly one at night except over something like a lighted football stadium.\" He also explained \"there are engines on blimps to help keep them traveling and landing right. And when they come in, you can hear the engines operating for quite some distance.\" MUFON Investigation The complex pattern of events before and after 5 AM EST on September 7, 1999 between Tampa and Sarasota is being studied by members of the Mutual UFO Network in Florida. Lorraine Gerber is Assistant State Director for Florida MUFON; Phil Bayly is MUFON's Lead Investigator on the September 7th sightings; and Ann Lieberman is MUFON State Section Director for Sarasota and Manatee Counties. They would all like to hear from any other eyewitnesses in Central Florida who might have seen unexplained aerial objects around 5 AM on September 7th."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Central Florida MUFON Hotline phone number is: 727-595-7964.
