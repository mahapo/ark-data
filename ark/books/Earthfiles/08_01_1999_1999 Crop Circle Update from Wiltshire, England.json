The wheat field is at the ancient sacred site of Avebury and the formation is more than 300 feet in diameter, as big as a football field. I walked all though it. The wheat was laid down in extremely complicated interior lays. On the ground, it is nearly impossible to know what the whole pattern is. But from the air, it is a large triangle of thirty-three standing circles bi-sected and tri-sected by lines that many people see projecting outward into six 3-dimensional cubes. That is one of the themes this summer of 1999 patterns in crops that are forcing 3-dimensional perspectives. Aerial Photograph © 1999 by Peter Sorensen. The July 29th evening that the huge formation appeared at Avebury, an English couple was sitting in a formation across the road from Silbury Hill, the biggest manmade mound in Europe. Charles and Frances Mallett of Horton, Wiltshire near Devizes were on a night watch inside another extraordinary formation that was discovered July 24th. That one was shaped like a diamond or stepped pyramid surrounded by 112 circles arranged in sixteen groups of seven. As Frances and Charles watched the sky near Silbury on Thursday night, they were surprised to see orange moving lights suddenly appear and move in arcing motions over the fields in front of them throughout the next three hours. The couple assumed that the orange lights were producing a large crop formation. When the sun came up, Charles and Frances searched but could not see a new formation. Disappointed, they left their all night watch site only to learn later that day that not more than a quarter mile behind them, the huge and complicated triangle/cube formation had been discovered in the Avebury field. The next morning on Saturday, July 31st, two new formations appeared. One was a 6-petal flower, also near Silbury Hill. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Aerial Photograph © 1999 by Colin Andrews. The second was at Roundway, about 250 feet wide consisting of seven \"petals separated by seven circles. The wheat looked as if water had rushed through the pattern laying the plants down in fluid s-shaped and circular flows that culminated at the center in a 3-dimensional ring about six feet in diameter and at least eight inches in height. Aerial Photograph © 1999 by Peter Sorensen. Alan March of Harlow, Essex, U. K., discovered it at 6 AM. He told me that the day before he kept saying to his friend, Jonathan Williams, that he 'felt like a formation would come down at Roundway.' But, Jonathan wanted to watch at Ave b u r y . In fact, both men had been in Avebury together until Alan felt overcome with a desire to go on alone to Roundway. When he got there, a thin mist was rising from the huge, new pattern. Alan was so excited that he started running down the tram line to get into the formation. But when he reached the outside boundary of one of its large circles, he heard a loud crackling noise like static electricity. It seemed to be coming from the wheat itself, even though at the far back edge of the formation there were power lines strung on transmission towers. The crackling sound unnerved Alan and he decided to go back to his car and drive to Avebury to get John. The two returned and hurried down the tram line to the edge of the Roundway formation. Again, the crackling electrostatic sound stopped both men. They waited another half-hour for the sound to die down before they stepped onto the wheat. During their wait, a deer ran into the formation and back out again. As they finally stepped into the crop pattern, both continued to hear the electrostatic noise 'like Rice Krispies snapping and popping all around us. In the dampness of the early morning, neither could find any signs of footprints or tracks.' The wheat seemed to be alive with that popping energy, John said, 'and we figured it must have been made just before Alan got there at 6 AM.' Similarly in the United States at Brentwood, Tennessee in May and Hoeven, Holland in |June, other eyewitnesses described loud electrostatic crackling and popping sounds inside geometric and circular formations. In the Holland experiences, a 19-year-old teenager watched a strange pink-purple light appear over a field near his house around midnight, transform into a 30-foot-diameter glowing disc, disappear and leave behind 30-foot and 2-foot diameter circles. What are the mysterious lights and their connection to crop formations? Charles"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Mallett recently on May 10th had his own close-up encounter with one of the light spheres. He was alone on a night watch inside a complicated flowering rape seed formation at Milk Hill near Alton Barnes. 'Rape seed grows thick like a jungle. You can,t move through it without breaking the celery-crisp stalks that leak water all over you. And it grows tall, as tall as me. So, the only thing you can see is the sky when you, are in it. I was sitting in one of the circles when suddenly right in front of me behind rape stalks was a glowing, orange-white sphere of light about ten inches in diameter. I could not believe it! The rape plants were actually silhouetted by the light behind them. I leaned over in different directions, but the light did not move. It was real and hovering there. Then after about a minute, it slowly faded out.' Above him at the belly of the White Horse in Milk Hill, Frances was also watching the field. She did not know that a sphere was in front of her husband. But later they compared notes and realized that at the same time, Frances saw two glowing spheres above the field turn off and on twice. In 1998, Charles was camped out at Adams Grave, the highest point in the area. He heard a sound above him in the sky like thunder. It repeated several times. Then, the sound began moving down toward him. As it descended, the 'thunder changed to a rhythmic heartbeat' that surrounded Charles. 'It was like some weird stereo. The beat would be on my right and move around to my left and back again, over and over. That beating went on for at least ten minutes making me feel like something was right there watching me react to the noise, but I couldn't see a thing!'\" We b s it e s : http://cropcircleconnector.com/Sorensen/PeterSorensen99.html Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
