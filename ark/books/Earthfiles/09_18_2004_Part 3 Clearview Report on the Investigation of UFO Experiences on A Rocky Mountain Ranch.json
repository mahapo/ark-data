Plane Crashes Jim: Also, during that period, two airline pilots and the son of one of them came out and wanted to put a landing strip on our land in exchange for my use of their plane. I agreed. About three weeks later, one of them and two others were killed in a crash nearby in clear weather. The plane was found in the daytime, but I don't know if it happened in the day or at night. Others who have inquired deeply into the mutilations, I understand, have disappeared, including the editor of a magazine who was never seen again. I also understand that two National Guard interceptors were up close to here and went down while in pursuit of a UFO at night. All of this was a little unnerving, so I decided I was going to stop my own inquiry. I was going to just quietly mind my own business. 17. Nine Disks Land in Front of House Jim: The forest ranger, David, from California, came again to visit. It was late at night, about 2 a.m. Almost all of these incidents have happened at night. We have never seen anything during the daytime. Peggy and Harry were also visiting. Nine disks landed in the front yard and I got a very clear view of them. They matched exactly one of the pictures I had seen in a book I have. Harry and Barbara were at the window and David was asleep in the bedroom. I called for David and I started out the front door. I was walking toward them as Barbara and Harry watched from the window. Barbara: Harry and I were watching from the window, both from the same window. What I can't figure out is that Jim and I saw such a large array of them, but Harry saw large, dark football shapes as if they were blocking part of the view. We were trying to see what would happen in the whole area and watching Jim walk out which I didn't want him to do. I have no awareness of what happened as far as what anyone else saw from that point on. My face was close to the glass and something hit me in the forehead a forceful impact like something hit me. I was knocked back off the couch and fell on the floor. Harry saw light out of the corner of his eye, and Jim said he saw a flash of light. I didn't see it. Jim: Harry yelled to me and I said I saw it. Harry said, 'It's Barbara. It's Barbara.' And I went running back to the house and found her in the middle of the floor. Barbara: The next thing I remember after looking out and seeing them was Jim putting a flashlight in my eyes to see if I had a concussion. Jim: While I was working over Barbara on the floor, they disappeared. I thought about it subsequently and wondered why they (disks) did not do it to me since I was the one walking toward them. But then, I began to understand that they did the most practical thing that could be done to get me back inside and get both people away from the window. And I think I really began to respect how clever they were. Then I began to suspect that maybe the government was doing it to us. Except that there were a lot of unusual things. For instance, David had been paralyzed during the incident. He could hear us calling, but could not get up until it was over. But then, he went out walking with me and what we call ultrasonics the extremely high-pitched sounds were going on out there and continued all night. David was sick then for three days. The sound would sometimes give us headaches, but not all of us all at "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"once to different individuals at different times. 18. Box With Blinking Lights Jim: I went back to the law officer (Sheriff George Yarnell's Deputy, Bill Waugh) and had a talk with him and he started telling me about some of the incidents that had happened again and about how he had pictures. He said they have a box and he had seen it on occasion. He had seen blinking lights, where there should not be any, in trees and such. He said he was out on a patrol one night and he saw, in a group of trees, this box that was blinking. He said he did not want to go in alone, so he raced back to town and picked up another law officer to go with him. When he got back, the trees were gone, the box was gone, everything was gone. He thought they had gone into the ground. He had seen things go into the ground before. He is reasonably convinced that they just go into the ground. I've never seen that happen. 19. Black Box Makes Angry Sounds Jim: There is one piece of what you might call physical evidence on the ranch; there is a big burned spot on the top of the hill approximately 35 feet across where nothing would grow the first year. It is beginning to grow in a little now. On a compulsion, the older boy, Joe, and I drove up there one night and parked at the circle. In the trees, a bright yellow light not bright, I guess, but a little dim yellow looked like an old car headlight. It just shined on the car. The back was toward the trees. We got out and walked over and there was a box on the ground. I told Joe to stay back about ten feet. It was making a buzzing sound just like zzzzzz and there was light like inside it, but not on it. Hard to describe. It was night, but there was a full moon and as I walked to about four feet from it, it changed its tone entirely. It sounded like a bunch of angry bees. The sound went up, so I backed away and I told Joe to go back to the car and watch me as I walked up to the box. We then walked back to the car and I told Joe that whatever happens, do not leave the car. Then I walked back and the box was gone. Following that is the part that Barbara prefers that I leave out. Barbara: Absolutely! Investigator: Are you leaving it out because it's personally embarrassing or because it's terrifying? Jim: Too incredible. That's the part that is too kooky, frankly. And she requested that I did not talk about it. And I don't think that close encounters of the third kind are really interesting to anyone except to whom they happen. Barbara: If something should happen, something should go wrong and our names should be connected with this, I could face it. But I could not face this other situation. And I'm too psychologically upset almost destroyed by this whole thing anyway. I'm trying very hard to keep from feeling that I have experienced something that I did not experience or did I experience it and can't remember? Or what? (At this point, Barbara is shaking so badly she can hardly light her cigarette. She has been practically chain smoking since the beginning of the narrative.) 20. Large Bird, Dog Notes Strange Scent Jim: There were quite a number of other things. I think they fit pretty much into a pattern. One afternoon, I went out walking in the woods and I saw a bird that was about three fee tall. I got one clear side of it. It was brown and had three feather-like appendages on its head. We have a whole set of animal books and I went through them trying to track it down. I did not find that any such animal existed on earth as I knew it. I tried to follow it and it went around those rolling hills and was gone. I came back to the house, and as I was coming through the fence, there was a slight snowstorm. We have this huge coon hound and as I approached the fence, the kids saw me coming (they could just see me barely in the snow). The dog saw me and came running. When he got to the fence, he stopped and started barking and growling when he got close to me. When I passed, he picked up some kind of an odor and was not letting me through the fence. That scared the kids and they went running into the house, thinking that something was coming. They could just see the shape on the hill. The dog was still not letting me through the fence, even though I was talking to him. It took three or four minutes of hard talking before my own dog let me through the fence. And I had been crawling all around where this unusual bird-like thing had been."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" I really thought about what it could be or how it could be, and I've come up with no data at all, except that it was a very unusual animal. Then it was just gone. I don't hallucinate, you know. I mentioned that I took acid, but I've never had a conscious hallucination in my life, that I'm aware of. And I'm sure that if I had, it would be over more than birds at the ranch because I never had them (hallucination) off the ranch. 21. Buzzing Sound Comes into House Jim: One night very late, I was lying on my couch it was a particularly black night, no moonlight, no stars. I told Barbara that there was not much sense in my staying awake because I could not see anything anyhow. I used to wait for the chickens to crow to go to sleep. It really messed up my schedule because I felt that some how I had a duty to protect everybody. I slept with a shotgun all night. When I lay down on the couch, there was just enough light remaining to see a little. I looked up and right at the window - there was no place to stand as it was a high window was the outlined shape of a man looking at me. He had on some tight-fitting apparel. I could not see any colors, just the black outline. I got up and I went to Barbara's bedroom. Barbara: He rapped on the door. Most of what I have told you is what happened to me. this is the other thing that happened to me and me alone. I had the same thing: the blood pressure, the heart beat, the difficulty breathing. I was sitting straight up in bed when Jim rapped on the door. I was trying to light a cigarette and I dropped the match on the bed in my state of terror. I opened the door and he came in and said that he had seen something strange out in front and wondered if I was all right. I told him I was having the same kind of symptoms and that I was very concerned that I was developing a heart problem. But I had gone in and had tests and they said no. I was very tense, but nothing else was wrong. Jim: She was very upset, so I sat down on the bed and asked if there was anything that I could get her. I took her pulse and sat and talked to her. When we have had really close contact at the house, it is hard to describe the feeling. People get naturally upset; they don't see anything, but as part of the pattern, I figured she would be upset when I went to the bedroom, and she was. I had put a big black chair in front of the front door. We were sitting in there just talking and the front door opened and it hit the chair with a bang. And I jumped up and went running in the front room and the door was closed again. I went back in the bedroom and I sat down on the bed and I was telling her that it was just the wind or something. The next thing was this voice that came inside of my head just like a loudspeaker. It said, 'We don't need to open your door to come into your home.' I don't remember if that was the exact wording. I told Barbara what I had just heard and she looked at me in a funny way. Barbara: I thought he was losing it I'll be honest. He knows I thought that. Jim: And then a noise started in the front room like a buzzing noise like bees. Barbara: It came all the way through the house to right outside my bedroom door. This I heard, too. Jim: She was holding on to my arm until she gave me black and blue spots and I frankly did not want to get up and go into the kitchen to see what it was. I was glad she was holding on to me. And the sound just went away then, nothing more. I was sure that something was going to come into the bedroom, but it did not. 22. Huge, Cone-Shaped UFO Barbara: We were going into town very early one morning just after daybreak and just at a sharp bend in the road I think Charlie was the first one that saw it. He said, 'Look at that big thing over there!' I looked and Harry looked and it was cone-shaped. I could not tell you the size because I don't have the ability to judge size. I did not think of what it could be. I thought maybe a weather balloon, or whatever. But I didn't really pay any attention. I told Jim about it. He had gotten some books at that time. He had one that had a picture of a cone-shaped one (UFO) and that's exactly what it looked like. Jim: From the description I got from all three of them, it was immense. It was hundreds of feet, at least, across. It was six times the apparent size of a farmhouse one-quarter mile away, you know, in comparative sizes. It was a huge ship. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"23. Hairy Creature Mimics Barbara Barbara: I had only one other sighting of the animal that they described to you. I assume from what I saw later that what I saw carrying the box was the animal only because it looked like that would be what it was that is an assumption. We have had no less than twenty people see 'Big Foot' at the ranch. Jim stepped out onto the porch without turning the porch light on. I was in the dining room and he rapped on the window several times without turning around and I saw him and went to the door and opened it and came out behind him. He led me into the porch and said, 'If you want to see one, I can show you where it is.' And he started lining up the trees. The living room light was not on, but the dining room one was casting sort of an oblique light. I leaned forward to look out and Jim said, 'Right between those two trees look very closely.' I do not have 20-20 vision with my glasses on, but I could see it. It was hunched over, and as I leaned out to look at it like this (demonstrates) using my hand to shade my eyes, it leaned out and went exactly like that to me (mimicked her). It was large and it was stooped down and it did lean down and go just exactly like I did. Jim: The only night that we saw a large number of them was the night we picked up the kids at school. We were going back to the ranch. Do you remember when that meteorite came down over Colorado some time last year? We got a very clear view of that. It was right ahead of us on the road. It exploded and came down right in front of us. It looked to me like it hit the ranch. We got to the ranch and talked about it and heard about it on TV. I would swear it was magnesium it flared that brightly white. 24. You Can Arouse Their Curiosity; Voice from the Stereo Jim: We have some friends from Texas who got a pretty big 'jolt' at the ranch. Barbara: They have had some very serious problems develop because they were there when a very bad thing happened. Jim: Trust me to tell what I want to tell, will you? Barbara: All right. Non-Human Entities Are Bothered by Silver Metal? Jim: We have been guaranteed confidentiality the man (deputy) is a professional. I know how to upset 'them,' and a lot of the things that scare Barbara involve their taking punitive action against us. I found that when I had guests that I wanted to see something, I could get a stack of wires and go out and get very busy with them like I was putting something up (building). We would go back to the house and watch and within a short period of time, they (non-humans) would be up there checking out what we did. Everyone could get a view of them. I did it several times, as sort of half a joke. Dan, the friend from Texas, was giving the old 'you're not giving me that kind of junk, are you?' Electronics is his field and he is a computer expert with a large company. He is impressed with his own self-importance. Well, I went up deliberately to stir them up. I found that certain elements very much upset them. One example is silver, being the main element (that bothers them.) I have a large collection of Indian silver jewelry and I discovered inadvertently that they shy away from silver. So, I went up to the circle, the burned spot, and struck silver bracelets in the ground along with the wires. Likely, I was putting up something intense. Then I came back to the house and we were all sitting playing Risk. I did not know what would transpire, but I hoped I would upset them. About two in the morning, the lights went out in the house, right on schedule. This voice came out of nowhere again and it was not FM. It was obviously intended to be terrifying and sounded like a computerized voice very mechanical-sounding. It was coming out of every radio and TV speaker in the house. We were sitting right in front of a console stereo and the voice came out of it. I can almost recite the words exactly. They are burned into my memory: 'Attention. We have allowed you to remain. We have interfered with your lives very little. Do not cause us to take action which you will regret. Your friends will be instructed to remain silent concerning us.'"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Barbara: That's very close. Jim: That's just about the words. Well, Dan was extremely thrilled when the lights came back on because he said, 'Now, I'm in my field.' He asked if he could take apart our TV set and stereo. Barbara: He was quite good electronically; he guaranteed that anything he took apart, he could get back together again. Jim: He started to dismantle it. He went through the whole unit and he said that he could not figure it out, but that his technicians in Texas would be able to when he got back. He checked and the stereo was off. The phonograph was on when the lights went off, but the radio receiver part was off. It was on 'Phono.' We found out that the type of transmitter it would take, from even close range, to cause a signal of that intensity to go through the house would be beyond our means to ever put up. Barbara: Bud Dan was still sure that it was a hoax. His wife and children were all upset and crying and Dan took his daughter off into another room and told her that they needed to find out if it was a trick or not. He told her to go back out and tell us she was frightened and wanted to leave immediately. He thought that if she acted upset enough and if we were playing a trick on them, rather than ruin the whole vacation, we would admit it. I got very upset and said that they could not start back to Texas in the middle of the night and I would call a friend in town to see if they could stay there. Then Dan talked to his daughter and they all calmed down and they stayed. He just told us this weekend that he knew if it was going to ruin the whole vacation, and if it had been a trick, we would have admitted it to him. He had decided - to save his own sanity that it was somebody else with a massive capacity pulling a hoax on us and that we were gullible enough to go for it. Barbara: Needless to say, Dan never found the trick. He went over the whole house. He even dumped the laundry bags. He went over everything. I was glad the house was clean.\" Continued in Part 4 Don't Trust Your Senses Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
