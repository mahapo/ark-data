They said they wanted to make certain there were those who survived and were able to help the world continue.” - A rizona Abductee April 29, 2008 Phoenix, Arizona - Last year, I met an Arizona resident who is 53-years-old now (born 1955), a professional healer, 6' 8.5\" tall, long sandy-colored hair and an experiencer with extraterrestrial humanoids. I will call him William. His story began when he was a young boy living about 18 miles from Elizabethtown, Kentucky. Grey-skinned, alien types emerged in his early years. Then one day in 1967 at age 12, while sitting in woods next to a tree, a tall, blond-haired man wearing a beige jump suit approached William and later took him aboard a silver disc. The blond man called himself ‘Zo.’ W illiam: “This look exactly like the vehicle Zo came in. It was photographed by Billy Meier on his Switzerland farm in 1975.” Photograph © 1975 by Billy Meier. W illiam: “Here's a painting on the internet I found that closely resembles one event I had.” "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"U sing one of the blond illustrations from my book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses, William modified it to more closely match the beige colors that Zo wore.

[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Tau Ceti is a star in the constellation Cetus that is similar to Earth's Sun in mass and spectral type. At just under 12 light-years in distance from our Solar System, it is a relatively close star. Tau Ceti is “metal- deficient,” so it is thought to be less likely to host rocky planets. Observations have detected more than 10 times as much dust surrounding Tau Ceti as is present in oue Solar System. The star appears stable, with little stellar variation. No companions have yet been detected around Tau Ceti through astrometric or radial velocity measurements. Because of the debris disk, any planet orbiting Tau Ceti would face far more impact events than the Earth. Despite this hurdle to having life, the fact Tau Ceti is very similar to our Sun has provoked scientific interest in the star. It is listed as a target for Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) searches, given its stability and similarity to our Sun. The luminosity of Tau Ceti is equal to only 55% of our Sun's. A terrestrial planet would need to orbit this star at a distance of just under 0.7 astronomical units (average distance from the Earth to the Sun) in order to match the solar- illumination level on Earth now. This is slightly less than the average distance between Venus and the Sun.] But like so many human abductees, William cannot answer with certainty any questions about what the various non-human types want with humans and other Earth life. The list of non-human types described after human encounters over the past forty years include Greys (pointed chins); EBENs (pear-shaped heads); Grey-like, short android workers; Short Blonds; Tall Blond ‘Nordics;’ Reptilian Humanoids; Praying Mantises; Orange- Skinned; Blue-Skinned; and other alien entities. After one of our discussions about different non-human types and different agendas, I received the following email from William. I'm still processing all we discussed a few days ago. I feel there are a few pieces of information missing from the entire picture - pieces necessary in"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"order to make solid conclusions, or, at the very least, connective theories possible. One that seems obvious to me is that while only three conflicting groups were discussed (Blonds, EBENs and Reptilian Humanoids), I think it leaves out others who are here in various capacities or agendas. If there are no others ... well, that really throws a wrench into what I thought I knew and who I thought I was originally in contact with. Here are excerpts from a couple of instances from my past in Denver, Colorado. - When I was very young (5 maybe) I had chicken pox. I vaguely remember that whatever I had, it left me quite ill and uncomfortable. I was sleeping in the living-room (a sofa sleeper). That night I awakened to the sound of my record player playing a favorite record I often listened to. The song was “Hey Diddle Diddle, The Cat and the Fiddle.” As I sat up slightly to see why this was playing, I clearly saw, across the room the full moon! Next, dancing along came a cat playing a fiddle. At the appropriate moment, a cow sailed over the moon. Of course, a dog showed up next - laughing (!) and a dish flew through the sky with a spoon. When the song ended the cat looked at me and then faded from view. To the left of the cat were 4 or 5 of the Strieber-type beings (grey-skinned with pointed chin Greys) who then walked toward me. Two were on my right and two on my left. The fifth stood about half way between my bed and the kitchen. This one never came any closer. I was examined, given an injection and something to drink that tasted sour. I recall wanting water, which never was offered or given. They never said a word. Instead, they made mouse-like sounds... squeaky or high-pitched vocalizations that they seemed to understand because they glanced at each other as they made these sounds. I fell asleep and do not recall when they left. - When I was 12 (1965), we lived on a farm outside Elizabethtown, Ky. Our water came from a well that we had to draw water from through a hand pump. It was November and I had become very ill. It was discovered I had drank water that several rats had died and rotted in. I was really sick, as you might imagine. A week had gone by and several trips to the doctor had occurred. I have no idea what all I had wrong, but it was obvious to the family I was in bad shape. I had already been in contact with Zo and recognized the occasional signal they provided to let me know they were nearby. This was a high-pitched beeping sound, similar to Morse code, only more rapid in the delivery. When this was heard, I knew I was supposed to get out of the house and meet them (Zo and the others accompanying him). I was too ill to go and felt worried about what they would do if I didn't go. Awhile later, the beeping started again. At that time I “sent” Zo a telepathic message that I thought I was dying. The beeping stopped abruptly. I remember thinking I must have been heard. Because of the fever and my condition, I again dozed off. I was awakened by a cold blast of air against my nearly naked, feverish body. I was really weak and now really cold. It felt awful and I shook uncontrollably. I looked around to find out what was happening and discovered I was being floated out of the house, past the front door and across the hay field in front of the house. I was being taken feet first. Ahead of me were three saucers. One on the ground, or hovering only inches above it. A ramp was extended and light came from within. It was then I barely saw several small beings, though not clearly at all. They were gliding along with me at a moderate pace. Above the first saucer (where we were obviously headed) was a second craft that I'm guessing would have been identical to the one we were approaching. It was about 50 feet off the ground and slightly further away. Above this was a third, again identical in shape. This one was a few hundred feet high and again further away. The night was clear and silent. I closed my eyes and must have briefly lost consciousness. I regained consciousness inside the saucer. Here, I was lying on a metal table. At my head, I barely made out what I would now call a video screen that is identical to a large, 6-foot-wide LED video display. The screen was vertical, not horizontal as you might expect to watch a regular display. It was a tall rectangle. This is why I could only see the uppermost portion of my image. I suggest it was like an LED display because I am now familiar with how much detail it offered and the absolute clarity it provided. I could only see the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"uppermost portion of this screen due to my placement on this “bed” I had been laid upon. I could see my head and shoulders. G rey entity picked out of public domain by William as close to the grey beings who surrounded him when William was so ill. Surrounding me were several of the Strieber-type Grey ET's. They were moving odd instruments over my bare body. These instruments were lighted by red and blue that seemed to only be lit at the tips. The pattern on the screen changed as they moved these around my head. I must assume the same was happening as they moved these instruments over the rest of my body. I was really afraid of these folks. The sounds they made sounded like fingernails on a chalkboard. It was impossible for me to move. I think they sensed I was afraid of them and their methods. These beings exhibited no emotions at all.They were very matter of fact, reminding me of Spock on Star Trek. I finally was able to ask them where Zo was. One leaned over me and projected into my mind they were sent to help me. I was not to be afraid and should relax. I remember being “told” I would be fine soon. I was still quite upset and again asked for Zo. Moments later, Zo entered the room with another “grey.” But, this one was tall like Zo (but Zo is blond, human-appearing and light-skinned). He seemed to be in charge and walked behind Zo, who also seemed to be an important figure to these grey beings. Zo acted kind and concerned, placed his hand on my chest and asked me if I was alright. He told me I was very sick and that in order for me to become completely healed, I would need to relax and allow these people to help me. I felt more relaxed once I saw Zo and agreed to cooperate. A few minutes later, I was given an injection in each upper arm. I fell asleep moments later and awoke in my own bed the next morning. I had no symptoms at all. I felt really good and went to the kitchen to let my mother know I was alright. She was surprised and asked how I could be doing so well. I told her I had been taken by Zo (I had told her several times about Zo) and seen by his doctors. She became really upset and didn't want to discuss it. We never spoke of it again. So, as you can see, my experiences have been a mixed bag. On one hand, I can see how these different factions might be warring. On the other, my experience has been to see them (at least some aspect of them) working cooperatively when my welfare has been a concern. So I just don't get it (conflict). All I've experienced from these people is that they knew things were going to possibly go quite badly here on this world. They said they wanted to make certain there were those who survived and were able to help the world continue. I was told of several agendas. One being that they want the people of our world to advance collectively - and as individuals. I was shown and taught by them that we are god-like beings with extraordinary abilities that could be developed. Part of my education from them durinig those five years of contact was the development of my abilities, which I use now to heal others. They very clearly illustrated to me that there are others here who are quite against this from ever happening. For the people of this world to advance to this point would mean those who have controlled the planet would no longer have control. Everything I have seen since those early years suggests to me that they have managed to maintain that control quite effectively. I was told"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the ultimate control mechanism would be fear and confusion. Obviously, we now live within this completely. It is nearly impossible to develop these abilities once so completely distracted by these circumstances. Though I cannot say those I have had experiences with were “good” or “bad,” I can tell you my experiences were mostly good ones. The bad experiences were from others who looked similar to the \"greys\" who helped me. I never experienced issues with the human-looking people. What does this mean? In context to what we discussed, it remains quite confusing when taken at face value. However, I think there might be a faction we didn't address during our conversation - a faction who is interested in us acquiring an elevated state of awareness, a step beyond our current evolution. Furthermore, I feel the greatest concern that the “bad guys” have is that we (or many) will awaken to our abilities. Perhaps these are abilities they already are aware of and do not possess. Perhaps in the process of creating humans, they were forced to imbibe humans with the only animating essence available anywhere - the animating spark of God. We, who were created from the best of all they had available from themselves, were made more powerfully than they had imagined or planned. Manipulating, managing and maintaining control of us was necessary, least we finally mature into their greatest threat... God-like beings who come to understand what has taken place and become angry with their creators. And perhaps those within that faction, who are attempting to help us, are hoping for an ally in humans.” C ontinued in Part 2.
