June 10, 2000 West Kennett Long Barrow, Wiltshire, England - Peter Sorensen found a new formation at the West Kennett Long Barrow across the road from Silbury Hill on June 2nd which he estimated to be about 150 feet in diameter. The next day, June 3rd, the pattern had changed, \"which is unusual. Apparently Paul Vigay went there early this morning (Saturday, June 3) and discovered that large areas had been flattened.\" Peter explained that the first phase of the formation consisted mainly of lines which he tried to reconstruct on his computer in a before and after sequence shown above. British crop circle researcher Paul Vigay reports that \"this formation was predicted in advance on Thursday morning, June 1st, by psychic Isabelle Kingston and crop circle researcher Freddy Silva.

Then by 7 AM on Saturday morning, the formation had been changed.\" One reaction to the second phase of the pattern is that it's a tantric diagram, one of the ones associated with OM MANE PADME HUM, Hail to the Jewel in the Lotus. Peter was in another beautiful formation on June 8 in Grafton Down, Wiltshire. He said, \"The design has three equal arms radiating outward from a small central circle. Although the circles in the photograph appear to be the same size, that is an optical illusion. They actually get larger the farther away they are. Grafton Down, Wiltshire, England on June 8, 2000.
