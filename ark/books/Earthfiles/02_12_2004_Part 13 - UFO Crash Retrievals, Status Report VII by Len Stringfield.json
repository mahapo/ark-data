Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 13 - UFO Crash/Retrievals, Status Report VII by Len Stringfield © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe \"While imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp, (we) witnessed low-level UFOs over the camp, even alarming the German authorities.\" - Mrs. Robert Lee Malone To be more computer-upload-friendly, the reprints will be divided into parts. Here begins Part 13 of Status Report VII, from February 1994. The Macabre Case of \"Agent\" Robert Lee Malone Here is still another sobering, high-intrigue case slinking its way out of the Hall of Mirrors that defies any cut-and-dry explanation. With so many key details missing, I would have dismissed the case had it not been for the 6 months of prior, in-depth investigation by Georgeanne Cifarelli of San Marino, California, who is MUFON's Assistant State Director for Southern California. During this period, Georgeanne tried to rationalize the bits and pieces of information she was able to obtain by phone, mail and personal interviews from the wife and daughter of Robert Malone - a military mystery man. On the theoretical basis that crash/retrievals might have been a factor or even played a major role in the peregrinations of patriarch Malone, Georgeanne was advised by friends in research to contact me to help find correlative evidence. After phoning me to present the salient facts, she agreed to send me her cumulative notes on the case which I received December 16. The Malone report, representing a lot of hard work, is long: the case is complex. But Georgeanne is convinced that the testimony she heard and the documents she saw (and sent copies to me) is a macabre story that must be told. According to the 34-page report, the central figure in the case is the father Robert Malone, who was a \"blood and guts\" military career type whose alleged undercover work in the murky labyrinths of intelligence might have led to his strange death in a Navy hospital in 1964. Since that hushed-up event, his wife (the couple married in 1948 in Germany) has lived in isolation in a state of grief and fear. The daughter, Nancy, incensed by the "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"injustices to her parents, now seeks the truth. Unlike her mother, Nancy has spared nothing good or bad about her family affairs to Georgeanne. Mrs. Malone, however, with a change of name, prefers to remain unidentified. But the high strangeness goes beyond Robert Malone. Weird, and perhaps an incongruity, are the claims of his wife of UFO experiences before she met him in 1946. While imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp, she witnessed low-level UFOs over the camp, even alarming the German authorities. Just as freakish are the disclosures by Nancy claiming life-long UFO encounters, including a lizard-like creature, as she followed her father on his errant calls to duty to all parts of the USA and beyond. Who was Robert Malone, the military mystery man? His wife and daughter knew he worked on hush-hush assignments full time, but could never explain why he never kept a military uniform in his home. Official records show that he served as Master Sergeant and Warrant Officer, but there were times, said Nancy, that he was addressed by other military associates by various ranks, including colonel. In fact, Nancy revealed on a couple of occasions that her dad worked as a double for President Eisenhower. While some of Malone's assignments in a UFO \"hot\" area, perhaps near a crash or a landing site, might have been the trigger for Nancy's exposure to alien activity\" But the wife, admitted encounters while in a Nazi concentration camp during WWII seems strange in that she and Malone had a common ground of interest - unless there was an arranged UFO intelligence connection? Is it unreasonable to believe that if that were the case, it also might be the reason behind Mrs. Malone's preference not to discuss all of her husband's intelligence activities? But agents assigned to perform UFO duties are sworn to secrecy and they do play games with curious outsiders who need not know the truth. On the other hand, coupled with her obvious fears for \"talking too much,\" there is Mrs. Malone's revelation of her husband's records that show that he was an active member of an Army band as Master Sergeant - and later as a bandsman with rank as Warrant Officer in the Air Force. But she says she never saw him play the alleged trombone or have one stored in their home. \"It was a cover,\" she told Georgeanne. Mrs. Malone also produced as evidence of her husband's undercover work an official directive to Southwestern Bell Telephone Company, San Antonio, Texas, dated February 1, 1944, from G. C. Brant, Major General U. S. Army, Commanding General AAFCFTC, which reads as follows: \"It is requested that a telephone be installed for private use in the home of Robert L. Malone, CWO, U. S. Army, 214 Army Blvd., San Antonio, Texas. Mr. Malone's duties necessitate the installation of a telephone at his home inasmuch as he is subject to call for duty at all times, and may be needed after regular duty hours. Your prompt attention to this matter will be kindly appreciated.\" Ordering a special telephone for a Master Sergeant who played a trombone would hardly be the kind of request from a Commanding General. Yet, briefly, in all of the official records pertinent to Robert Malone - including his discharge - he is classified as a bandleader or bandsman. In each, however, are conflicting data as to his duties and year of discharge and other discrepancies. His available records just don't make sense if we are to believe his wife's and daughter Nancy's testimonies. MUFON's Georgeanne, in summing up his military records that she"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"reviewed after her interview with Mrs. Malone, commented: \"The wife says her husband, Robert, served for 30 years in the military, enlisting in 1924. The military says he served 35 years. That's a little ridiculous since they have him retiring in 1945 and again in 1947 for reasons that are not true. The wife says Social Security is only paying her benefits for 19 years, claiming that Robert was only in for 19 years, according to their (government) records.\" One of Four U. S. Milit ary Reports of Separation and Honorable Discharge for Robert Lee Malone Above: One of four Honorable Discharge Enlisted Record and Report of Separation for Robert Lee Malone. This document is U. S. AIR CORPS \"Date of Separation\" October 24, 1945. Below: The other three are USAF October 25, 1948; INFANTRY December 16, 1949; and U. S. Army August 31, 1950."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"To be considered in all the confusion over records and the nature of his work is the possibility, although remote, that Master Sergeant or Warrant Officer Malone later served in a covert UFO-connected intelligence capacity as a civilian. But obviously, records of secret transfer are unaccountably missing. Thus, no pension for Mrs. Malone. To speculate further, the records might have been simply lost (not unusual). Or they might have been maliciously destroyed by some individual in the same deep-throat service as a personal vendetta for reasons we will never now. Or because he might have been under suspicion as a security risk for some serious indiscretion. This, too, might explain his strange death in a Naval hospital and the denial of allowing his family to see his body - even at his funeral. Surely, something is amiss in this case. But it is known that such Draconian measures have been used by covert agencies that dealt with Russian espionage and the UFO problem in the 1960s. It is beyond the scope of this report to publish the 103 official records covering many phases of Malone's military career that I have received from Georgeanne. Several items, however, I have chosen to reproduce. These were copies received by the Malones from the Veterans Administration through the Freedom of Information Act which relate to Malone's Discharge or Separation From Service records. These examples, which follow, show the inconsistencies of data about the year of his discharge, alleged health status, duties as a bandsman and the absence of any reference to covert intelligence work while in the military. Although other records might be withheld or were destroyed coincidentally with the demise of Malone, we have found additional clues that reveal the magnitude of UFO interaction in the lives of the Malone family dating back to the days of the holocaust of WWII. Following are excerpts from the 34-page report submitted by Georgeanne, based on her interview with Mrs. Malone and daughter, Nancy, in December 1993: Mrs. Robert L. Malone Interview 1942: I was 12 years old in a cattle car on the way to the Polish"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"border. We were on our way to a forced labor camp. We stopped at Lidist and the sky 'blacked out' at about 9:00 a.m., and then it lit up with a 'dome-like' shape with flashing lights. It covered about a football field area. It strobed. The lights were all around and we were engulfed as they descended nearer. The Nazis ran and we were all alone until the next morning and then it came again; then there were lights like rays coming through slats and then it was gone. That night it came again and the Nazis were just as confused as us. 1945: In labor camp at Teisianstadt. The camp was in an uproar - the Nazis prior to the U. S. soldiers coming were frantically trying to get rid of evidence of what had happened and in the confusion, 23 other girls and I (between the ages of 12 and 18) escaped into the swamp. It was cold - winter. We were walking in the woods and watching for Nazis when all of a sudden a dome-like thing appeared with no sound, but lights pulsing. We felt an energy rush through us like an electrical charge. The craft hovered over us and we could see lines all lit up like on a carousel in oranges and golds. We felt the urge to move toward it and felt an upward pull. We all reached up with our arms toward it and then we felt as if we were released and then drained. It then sped away. 1946: I was ill for 11 months. I met Bob. 1947: Bob came to live at our house to help me and my family survive after the war. Bob and I were all alone talking and he asked me if I'd ever seen anything unusual with flashing lights and he told me about his experience on the ocean with a strange object over the ship. He was on the aft of the boat with others near Greenland and all of a sudden, the water lit up from beneath with an orange glow and they saw something emerge so quickly that it was hard to follow. 1948: Living in Freising. July 28th I married Bob. Dr. Frik (Chaplain in the U. S. military) told Bob that I might be a discredit to the military, after my interrogation, for corroborating Bob's stories. Everyone was investigated like crazy when we wanted to tell the military about these incidents. Bob said he would get to the bottom of it in the States. In the U. S., Bob was ordered to a mission - fast - to Fort Ord and within 24 hours, we were there in Monterey. That night there was a domed object over the Bay and a soldier yelled, 'There's the tunnel. People disappear when that's around.' About 3 miles or so out, you could see the tube descend to the water. It wavered - sort of transparent. Bob said, 'Man, what a mission!' I asked what he meant, but he said he could only tell me it was 'totally bizarre, never mind.' Then one day, he said he was being transferred to Camp Carson and would send for me. I stayed with my sister because I had pneumonia again. Bob left in the fall, but before he left he told me about the relay station by San Pedro. he said he looked out over the ocean and a smaller, glowing wheel/disc/ball came at him and then whizzed the camp. It maneuvered like a small plane and was about the size of a hot air balloon. As it closed in, it was a disc with beam-like spokes on a wheel. It came to treetop level and then it took off in a zigzag. Again, it seemed like he was being followed. 1951: We traveled around the U. S. with my sister, Katy. We saw lights and things following us on these old highways. We were lonely travelers on these roads. This was a time when we were moving from place to place a lot. I don't know why there was so much activity. 1949 is when Bob started getting steady calls to go out. In 1951, it escalated. Calls came all hours of the day and night and off Bob would go. A few months here or there and I always felt followed because people would show up once in awhile asking questions."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"When I asked Bob about them, he said they were military intelligence check up. He even said he had to impersonate Eisenhower several times. 1954: Now starts all the years of traveling intensively across the country - night moves, sudden calls needing Bob. We went to Indiana and one night a man came up to Bob and took him around back of the house to a jeep with three other men and they talked. Then there was a gunshot. Bob came around and said, 'Let's go!' In the car, I asked him about it and he said 'gangsters' thought they were helping the government, but they were only making things harder to do his missions. We drove Rte. 66 and at the next gas stop, Bob met someone and brought a box back with weapons in it. He said we had to detour to weird mountainous areas close to Denver and there were always lights following behind the sky on these deserted highways. Then, suddenly we hit something in the road. It felt like the back end lifted as we stopped. Bob went outside and there was an ugly thing lying on the ground. It was about two feet long - a solid, greenish man. Mostly head with long, thin appendages. The body was indescribable - very icky. Bob picked it up, covered it, threw it in the truck, but he didn't take it to the military. I don't know if Bob was really aware of these 'aliens' at this time. We talked of beings, mostly of odd happenings and strange sightings. Then, we went to Texas and on the way, more lights in the sky. More 'pursuing,' but no contact. We heard so much about mutilations, animals missing, people missing. Everywhere Bob went he'd start conversations about strange phenomena and people would tell him of their experiences. The authorities would tell him to 'get lost' often and he'd say he was with the military and they'd get even more agitated. There was a lot of repression going on. On our way to Denver, we made really out-of-the-way detours going up to Phillips, South Dakota, to see friends. One day, we were totally engulfed in a light on the highway - that only my daughter, Nancy, could see. She was adamant and squinting and I thought she was fevered, but we couldn't see this light she talked about. A little later toward evening, Bob saw something in the road all curled up and he grabbed a blanket, covered it up and tried to lift it, but as he did, it uncurled and got up and staggered. It was ugly. It had a big head and eyes like empty sockets - black with no pupils. Long, thin legs and arms, and it looked like an emaciated old man. It looked odd, but had gentle movements. Bob talked to it and it responded like it understood somewhat and made some responsive movements. There was no resistance to Bob. It was leaking a clear fluid from the arm and Bob put a piece of cloth over it and it didn't resist again. Then Bob carried it off the road and it looked to the sky. Then, someone else came running over from the desert side with a gun and said he'd been following it and would take charge and for us to get out of there. So we did. Two days later, we were leaving and went by the area and stopped to look around and we found it dead with gunshot wounds where we'd left it. We left it there, but Bob took a sample (that disappeared later.) 1955: Finally, one day Bob mentioned to me that he was going to a 'crash-site' by a town outside of Alamogordo, Texas. Later that night, he came home and told me he'd need to talk to me and Nancy. We woke Nancy up and he sat her down and explained about the 'creatures.' One in particular, he had just hit and killed on the way to a crash site. I had already seen plenty of strange phenomena and creatures with him, so I knew (about them). But I never made a connection until this moment when he talked of spacecraft and 'other life forms.' He was bent on Nancy knowing the 'truth' about their existence, but also the importance of neither of us telling anyone"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"because it could put us in danger. 'And people won't believe you anyway.' Over the years, I've forgotten so much and I'm only telling my daughter for her sake. She wants to know about her father. But I'm telling you this stuff was weird and scary at the same time.\" To be continued in Part 14. Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
