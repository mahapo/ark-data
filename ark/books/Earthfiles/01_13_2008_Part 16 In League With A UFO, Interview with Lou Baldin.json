Out of print. Return to Part 1 January 13, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Lou Baldin was born on October 7, 1952, in Verona, Italy. In 1957, when Lou was five, he moved with his parents and siblings to Patterson, New Jersey, where his father set up a bakery that was not successful. Three years later in 1960, the family moved to Kansas City, Missouri. As a young child, Lou Baldin said he had other vivid memories of where he came from before he was born in Italy. That other existence was in a non-organic energy form. By age twelve and beyond, Lou also became aware of other non-human intelligences he characterizes as negative, sabotaging, and in competition with the goals of his prior existence where energy fields focus upon the evolution of souls. In 1995, Lou received a phone call from a stranger who wanted to meet for lunch. Lou did not hesitate, which puzzled him later. He met the man as if he had to and remembers a book and loose pages the man held in his hands. Lou thinks he held them in his own hands, in part or whole. The man told Lou Baldin that Lou would write a book. Yet, Lou had never written before in his life. His professional career was focused around the construction business and home building. Lou remembers the stranger paid the lunch bill and then their paths never crossed again. To his own confused surprise, a few months later, Lou felt an intense urge to write. Over a period of two weeks, the entire manuscript of In League With A UFO was done. The words “poured out,” which Lou assumed was from the stranger's download of information into Lou Baldin's subconscious, as he describes happening to Bill Smith in the book. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"After Lou read what he had written - and in spite of his own association with the energy beings - he thought much of the text “sounded crazy” and he put the manuscript in a desk drawer for nearly two years. Then suddenly and as urgently as he had felt compelled to write, he felt he had to publish the manuscript. At the time, Lou decided the only way he would be comfortable in releasing the highly strange material to the public would be through the artifice of old documents discovered at an auction. So, that's how In League With A UFO begins. But the truth is, according to Lou Baldin, the content came from the download into his subconscious at lunch with the stranger who looked human, but was probably an Alien entity assigned to inhabit that male human body in order to accomplish a mission - another prominent theme in the book, In League With A UFO. Interview: L ou Baldin, author, In League With A UFO © 1997. Lou Baldin, Home Builder and Author, In League With A UFO © 1997: “Y OUR BOOK, IN LEAGUE WITH A UFO , IS IT NON-FICTION? It is non-fiction. HOW FAR BACK IN YOUR LIFE DO YOU GO FOR THE FIRST EXPERIENCE WITH THE NON-HUMAN, OR ALIEN, THAT YOU DESCRIBE IN YOUR 1997 BOOK, IN LEAGUE WITH A UFO? From the day I was born, I remember coming here with certain entities and they would periodically come and go. We went through certain processes, I assume probably to teach me certain things about this earthly life. I don’t remember exactly the details. COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU REMEMBER AROUND YOUR BIRTH? I actually remember being in a ship before I was born. There was discussion and then all of a sudden I was a baby. Basically, I could remember some of the things in the room. Then, I blacked out and periodically they (Aliens) would physically come – a vortex would open up in the room and the Aliens would come out of the vortex and we would have our little chats. Sometimes I went with them. Sometimes they just left."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"E ntities emerging out of bedroom “vortex,” similar to Lou Baldin's experience. Illustration provided by L. P., based on teenage experience in early 1960s, from Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses © 1994 by Linda Moulton Howe. CAN YOU GO BACK TO THE TIME IN THE SHIP BEFORE YOU WERE BORN AND DESCRIBE COLORS, LIGHTS, AND WHO IS WITH YOU IN THE SHIP? The ship I cam in on was basically the same ship that I would visit periodically when I was young – very bright, circular. I remember playing with other children and we would run around the corridor of the ship. There were rooms we would go into and play with different types of objects like the objects I described in my book. WHO WERE YOU WITH BEFORE THE MOMENT OF BIRTH? There were the ones (energy beings) who brought me here. WHAT PHYSICAL DETAILS? Their appearance would have had the same appearance I had. It seemed like when we were in the Alien ship, that we were more an energy than physical organism before I first came here to Earth to be born. Then after birth, I was physical. IN THE ENERGY FORM IN THE SHIP BEFORE YOU WERE BORN, CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT THOSE ENERGY FORMS WERE LIKE IN TERMS OF COLOR, SIZE AND DYNAMIC? As far as the feeling, it was pretty much the same as my full consciousness now. Seeing the other entities is completely blurred. It is not like I could see physical beings. As far as how I felt, it’s almost like I feel right now. I was conscious, except I did not have a body. LET’S GO BACK TO THAT TIME WHEN YOU AS AN ENERGY FORM WITH OTHER ENERGY FORMS ARE EXCHANGING INFORMATION BEFORE YOU ARE BORN INTO A BODY CONTAINER HERE ON EARTH BACK 55 YEARS AGO. DO YOU REMEMBER THE CONTENT ABOUT WHY YOU WOULD BE BORN ITO A HUMAN BODY? At that time I did not remember. But it was not like I was resisting or forced to come here. It was almost a voluntary thing and with anticipation because it was kind of a fun thing at the time. Even though I grew up in an area in Italy that was post-WWII, much of the town was destroyed. There was poverty all around, but I thought it was actually a pleasant life. WHERE WERE YOU BORN AND RAISED? Ve r o n a , I t a l y . UNTIL WHAT YEAR? Until 1957 and then we moved to New York."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"YOU WERE FIVE YEARS OLD. WHERE DID YOU LIVE IN NEW YORK? We lived in Patterson, New Jersey. WHAT DID YOUR DAD DO? He had a bakery. WAS HIS LIFE ALWAYS AS A BAKER? When he was in Italy, he and some other guys had a furnace company. They built bakery ovens and stuff like that. Their business did not do well, so he used some of the equipment he built in that company to open up a bakery. He had a brother in the United States who thought my father could do better here, so he got my dad to move to New Jersey and they opened up a bakery. But they didn't do very well. DID YOU GO TO GRADE SCHOOL, JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL IN NEW JERSEY? No. I went just two grades in New Jersey and then we moved to a city in the Midwest. WHAT CITY? To Kansas City, Missouri, in 1960 YOU WERE 8 YEARS OLD. Right. SO BY EIGHT, YOU HAD BEEN FROM OUTER SPACE TO ITALY TO NEW JERSEY AND THEN MISSOURI. A strange journey, for sure! DID THE ENERGY FIELDS CONTINUE IN AND OUT OF YOUR LIFE? Yes. As I got older, they did not want to interfere too much with my human life, so things became a little different. I’m not sure what it depended upon. Parallel Tracks of Energy Beings and Human Childhood COULD YOU FILL OUT A SCENE THAT’S MEMORABLE OF BEING A CHILD SOME TIME IN THOSE EIGHT YEARS AND INTERACTING WITH THE ENERGY FIELDS? I did have kind of a double life. At the time, it did not seem strange to me. I would have these people who would show up and we would do things. Then I had my other life with my siblings, my cousins, and for some reason, I hardly ever differentiated between the two. THE BEINGS THAT WOULD SHOW UP, WHAT DID THEY LOOK LIKE WHEN YOU WERE A HUMAN CHILD? Sometimes they would look just like other kids. They would be my size. There were some situations that were definitely paranormal. As I became more immersed in the world around me, the human world, some of that stuff got blocked and I tried to put it out of my mind. CAN YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF THE MOST INTENSELY PARANORMAL EXPERIENCE WITH THE CHILDREN-APPEARING BEINGS WHEN YOU WERE YOUNG? I guess the best example was when I was around six or seven years old and we were playing hide and seek in New Jersey. I jumped into a bush to hide, while everyone else ran around other places. And when I jumped into this bush, I had some of the beings in there. It was a very strange situation and at the time it was as if there were bees inside the bush. IN TERMS OF SOUND? Right."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"SO THERE WAS A BUZZING SOUND? Right. From there, we went into a ship and that’s basically what I remember. DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING IN THE SHIP? No. DO YOU HAVE CONSCIOUS MEMORY OF MOVING FROM THE BUSH TO THE SHIP ? No. Whether the bush was actually a ship, I don’t know. WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE TRANSPORTED TO AN ALIEN SHIP? I don’t recall the game being over (when I went into the bush to hide), but everyone was gone when I came back. There were other things – once the Aliens come into your zone, the normal world is disturbed. WHAT ABOUT YOUR MOM OR DAD? DID YOU TALK WITH THEM ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED? Yes. My Dad is the one who gave me the story about back in Italy when they were in school, they witnessed three saucers in the sky, which to them was an incredible phenomenon. They ran home and told their dad about it and he said it was all nonsense. I asked my dad what he thought, did he think it was extraterrestrial? He said, ‘No,’ but he did not know what it was. So neither of my parents have this extraterrestrial concept. They completely do not believe in it, as all my siblings don’t believe either. DID YOU EVER TELL YOUR DAD ABOUT YOUR MEMORY OF BEING BROUGHT FROM THE SHIP TO BE BORN? I never talked with my dad about that. I did tell that to my mother a few years ago and she kind of looks at me like, ‘Poor kid!’ She does not say it is impossible, but to them it’s just like any skeptic – until they see it or understand it or go through it, none of it exists in their minds. HOW MANY BROTHERS AND SISTERS DO YOU HAVE? Seven brothers and three sisters. SO ELEVEN OF YOU? Correct. NOT ANY OF THE OTHER TEN KIDS AND YOUR PARENTS EVER RELATED TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING BETWEEN YOU AND THE OTHER INTELLIGENCE? No, none of them did. EVEN THOUGH YOUR TEN SIBLINGS AND PARENTS NEVER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING ELSE BEYOND HUMAN, WERE YOU CARRYING THE ENERGY FIELD KNOWLEDGE WITH YOU ALL OF THE TIME, LIKE A PARALLEL TRACK? Yes, I was. The hardest part of ufology is that everyone thinks it’s as simple as the reality around us. We have a house. We have a car. We have a job. but when you’re in the paranormal, there is no – you cannot quantify or simplify it. It’s very real and it’s very complex and very different. People who are curious about ufology want the simple version, like Star Trek. They want the reptilians and Spocks - the TV version. BUT THERE ARE ALSO THE BLONDS, THE GREYS, THE EBENS, THE REPTILES AND ON AND ON. Sure, I've read about what abductees say. But people want something they can grab hold of and put it under the microscope. The truth is - we are the mice in the little test tube here and we are trying to determine who the scientist is studying us. We are trying to understand the scientists, the higher beings, looking down and studying us. How absurd is that?! Explaining it to people who have not experienced it is just mind-boggling, frustrating. You’re talking about very different realities. We’re not talking apples and apples. We are talking about apples and God! Does anyone understand what God is? Does anyone understand what an apple is? We think we understand what an apple is, but we definitely"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"don’t know what God is. But they are one and the same. MEANING, ALL DIMENSIONS AND REALITIES ARE PART OF THE SAME BIG BOX THAT IS THE UNIVERSE. Yeah. Self-Activating Alien Technology WHICH INTELLIGENCE INTRODUCED YOU FIRST TO THE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SELF-ACTIVATING AND ARE DESCRIBED IN YOUR BOOK, IN LEAGUE WITH A UFO? Some of those instruments I have experienced. ON YOUR OWN BODY? Yes. As I was growing up, the Aliens would come into my room and we would be playing with stuff that was out of fairy tales. The objects were magical. They would completely freak out anybody else who is a human stuck in the human concept of reality. WHEN YOU SAY KIDS PLAYING, DO YOU MEAN WHEN YOU WERE AMONG YOUNG CHILDREN ON THE SHIP? No, sometimes they would bring stuff out of the ship and into my house. CAN YOU GIVE A VIVID EXAMPLE? A vivid example would be things that instead of being solid – like our toys today that you have to put batteries in them and then they do specific things. But our Earth toys don’t fly. They don’t mutate. They don’t have personalities. The Aliens brought me stuff that only exists in our cartoon world on Earth, but really exists in the UFO world. It's another dimension that easily protrudes into our dimension. IN YOUR 55 YEARS OF BEING INSIDE THE HUMAN CONTAINER THAT YOU ARE NOW IN WITH THE MEMORY OF HAVING BEEN AN ENERGY FIELD IN A SHIP BEFORE YOU WERE BORN, HAVE YOU EVER HAD THE CONCEPT THAT ANY OF THE INTELLIGENCES THAT HAVE DEALT WITH YOU IN YOUR HUMAN LIFE ARE FROM ANOTHER SOLAR SYSTEM IN THIS GALAXY OR FROM ANOTHER GALAXY, JUST LIKE WE ARE A LIFE FORM ON EARTH? HAVE YOU EVER DEALT WITH ANY EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES? Ye s . BUT YOU ARE DRAWING A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE IN OTHER DIMENSIONS AND IN THIS DIMENSION. When I say dimension, dimension is sometimes a way to get from Point A to Point B. Some of these entities are from this particular dimension. They are from this galaxy – not necessarily from this solar system. The way they get around, they do it dimensionally. THEY MOVE IN AND OUT OF DIMENSIONS TO CUT DOWN ON TIME? Yes, to facilitate how they get around. Human-Looking Aliens WHICH PHYSICAL TYPE IN THIS 3-D UNIVERSE HAVE YOU ENCOUNTERED AND CAN YOU DESCRIBE THEM? Some of them are just like regular humans. BLOND? BROWN HAIR? TYPE? Nothing in particular. I have met several and they were just like different people – not just one specific race. Caucasian, African-American. They fit into any suit. DID THEY TALK TO YOU AND SAY THEY WERE E.T.S? No, none have ever told me where they were from. They would have a normal conversation with me on one level and on another level, I understood who they really"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"were. We are a physical being, but we are also a spirit inside of a physical body. The spirit inside the physical body can be from the Earth dimension or from another dimension. THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE SPIRITUAL ENTITY TO THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES IS WHAT? Your spirit communicates much more differently than the physical. So, when we communicate, when humans are encountering each other – they read the body language, they read tone of voice. There is a lot of communication going on versus just the voice. When you are with some of these higher up entities, they are communicating directly into your subconscious mind to a higher level. Some people will pick up on it immediately and some will not. The information just goes directly to the subconscious mind and maybe you will remember it later. Lunch with A Stranger Who Had A Book DID ANY INTELLIGENCES IN HUMAN FORM CROSS YOUR PATH AND COMMUNICATE WITH YOU TELEPATHICALLY FOR A SPECIFIC REASON? Absolutely. That’s the information I placed in my book, In League With A UFO. Before I received all that information, a human person called me from out of the blue and said he wanted to meet with me. We went and had lunch. That’s where a lot of information came from. WERE YOU SEEING PICTURES IN YOUR MIND? A lot of it was basically transferred and a lot of material was handed to me. IN DOCUMENT FORM? Ye s . DID IT LOOK LEATHER-BOUND OR METALLIC OR WHAT? It looked like a leather-bound typical book. 7 X 9 or 8 X 10 or ? It probably was closer to 7 x 9. DID HE OPEN UP THAT BOOK? I believe he did. YOU MENTIONED LOOSE PAGES? Yes, they were sticking out from it. WHEN HE OPENED UP THE BOOK, DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING HOLOGRAPHICALLY PROJECTING INTO YOUR HEAD OR ANYTHING IN A COMMUCATION? No, at the time, it was all here and now. I do remember thinking this is all pretty strange. I don’t know this guy who called me out of the blue. But those types of contacts have happened to me before and after. OK, BUT STAYING WITH HIM, DO YOU REMEMBER ANY MENTAL EXCHANGE WITH THE MAN ABOUT THE CONTENT THAT IS IN IN LEAGUE WITH A UFO? No, not at the time I was sitting there in the restaurant. BUT YOU THINK HE HANDED YOU THE BOOK? Ye s . AND YOU HAD IT PHYSICALLY IN YOUR HANDS? Right. DID YOU SHAKE HIS HAND TO LEAVE? DID HE POP OUT OF EXISTENCE? WHAT HAPPENED? Basically he paid the bill. We exited the restaurant. He went his way and I went my way."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"YOU THINK YOU WERE CARRYING THE BOOK? I don’t remember. WERE THE PAGES PHYSICAL? They seemed to be at the time, but I know I had to transfer a lot of it into my own writing and where it all came from – whether it came from the documents? Or came directly from him mentally? I have no idea how much? BUT YOU HAVE A MEMORY OF THIS MAN HANDING YOU PAPERS INTO YOUR HAND? Ye s . WHERE DO YOU THINK THOSE PAPERS WENT? Where a lot of the paranormal stuff goes. MEANING YOU HAD THE PAPERS IN PHYSICAL FORM FOR A WHILE AND THEN THEY DISAPPEARED? Ye s . THIS IS THE CONCEPT ABOUT THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF THE CRAFT AND OBJECTS IN OUR DIMENSION, BUT THEY SEEM TO RECYCLE AND IN THEIR RECYCLING THEY DISAPPEAR FROM THIS DIMENSION? That’s the way they tidy up their operation. I've had other objects do the same disappearances. DO YOU REMEMBER PHYSICALLY HANDLING THOSE PAGES AND SEEING ENGLISH TYPE OR SYMBOLS ON THEM? It’s a good question. I do remember having papers, but I don’t remember exactly if it was English or some other language. In the book was a lot of this stuff, but I don’t remember the symbols or what kind of font or what might have been on there. DID HE SHOW YOU THE BOOK? The whole time we were meeting, he held the book. And then when we left, I don’t remember if he gave me the book or he showed it to me. I know that months went by before it hit me that I needed to sit down and write this stuff, which was in 1995. DID YOU HAVE PHYSICAL PAGES WHEN YOU SAT DOWN TO WRITE IN LEAGUE WITH A UFO? No. REMEMBERING THE MAN, DID HE EXPLAIN TO YOU WHY YOU WOULD BE MEETING WITH A PERFECT STRANGER WHO HAD A BOOK? No, he just said I needed to write. This was the first book I ever wrote. I didn’t think I could write a book. YOUR BOOK HAS A COPYRIGHT OF 1997. WHEN DID THE EXCHANGE WITH THE MAN OCCUR? Several months before I began to write. And I wrote the manuscript two years before I actually published it. SO 1995 IS THE YEAR YOU WERE WRITING? Right, and I met the man several months before that, before I actually started to write. It was like a particular time came and I realized all of a sudden that I needed to write this stuff. It did not make any sense, other than I knew I had this extraterrestrial background with the energy fields and others. DID YOU THINK OF THE ENERGY FIELDS AS BEING CONNECTED IN ANY WAY TO IN LEAGUE WITH A UFO? Because these beings can show up any time they want – sometimes they manifest and sometimes they don’t. I could have had one of them there when I started writing. TRY TO DESCRIBE WHAT YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED. DO YOU SEE PICTURES,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"SYMBOLS, WHAT HAPPENS? The material is just there. You just know it. I don’t know that I visualize it or see it. But how this material gets from Point A to Point B, or from Entity 1 to Entity 2 has not been described yet by anybody, other than to say ‘I heard a voice in my head.’ Well, if I ever heard a voice in my head, I’d freak out! YOU DIDN’T HEAR A TELEPATHIC THOUGHT VOICE? No. HOW DID YOU WRITE IN LEAGUE WITH A UFO? DID YOU SIT DOWN AND TYPE EVERY WORD IN THE MANUSCRIPT IN 48 HOURS? Just about. It didn’t happen that fast. But when I started writing it, I did not stop until it was done. HOW LONG DID THAT TAKE? It took a couple of weeks. When I wrote it, I didn’t want to publish it. I thought, ‘This is crazy. No one is going to believe it. It’s ridiculous. I hardly believe it. And I just put it away. It sat in my closet as a manuscript for two years (1995-1997). THEN WHAT HAPPENED? Then I just had this urge to get it out there. DO YOU ASSOCIATE THAT URGE WITH THE APPEARANCE OF LIGHT OR A BEING? No, but as I said, these entities come and go and do not always manifest. Sometimes I can pick up their energy field and sometimes I can’t. WHAT DOES THE ENERGY FIELD FEEL LIKE TO YOU? I don’t think I want to talk about that because I know what it is and that’s one of the things I can detect. But it’s not something I want to put out in the public. BECAUSE? There are certain things that have to remain secret. DID YOU HAVE A CONSCIOUS THREAD, AN UNBROKEN CONSCIOUSNESS – I COULD WALK FROM WHERE I AM NOW INTO A LIVING ROOM AND OPEN A DOOR AND GO OUTSIDE AND GET INSIDE THE CAR. MY CONSCIOUSNESS IS THE SAME LINE THROUGH ALL OF THAT. Exactly. When I came from the energy field to the physical, it was like getting in a car. GETTING INTO THE CAR IS THE ACT OF BEING BORN, RIGHT? Right. AS A NEW BORN BABY, DID YOU STILL HAVE THE ABSOLUTE CONSCIOUS LINK TO THE ENERGY FIELDS IN THE CRAFT AS IF I WOULD GET UP AND GO OUTSIDE? Ye s . OK, SO AS A BABY, YOU ARE STILL IN THAT BABY PERSPECTIVE, BUT YOU ARE STILL AN ENERGY FIELD IN THAT BABY? Ye s . HOW LONG DOES THAT UNBROKEN CONSCIOUSNESS GO ON? It never severs, except that it goes into the back burner. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ENERGY FIELDS WANT YOU TO ACCOMPLISH? To raise the curtain up just a tad – not for the majority, but just for some. RAISING THE CURTAIN – WHAT IS THE CURTAIN AND WHAT ARE YOU REVEALING BEHIND THE CURTAIN? What is the purpose of life? The purpose is so simple that most people don’t want it. The"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"purpose is to prove to ourselves what we are, what we are made of. After doing so, that will determine where we go once we are off of this planet. Humans are here to determine where we go after the moment of death, which is related to how much more information and truths we become aware of, or not. WHAT ARE WE MADE OF THAT WE ARE TRYING TO REDISCOVER? Humans are made of a very interesting kind of energy – I mean beyond what's in atoms and electrons. Our life force entities are a much different kind of energy.” C ontinued in Part 17 - Final, Interview with author Lou Baldin.
