Army Officer Click here to see Part 1 of Status Report VI To be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 12 of Status Report VI, from July 1991. These status reports were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report VII begins at Earthfiles 12/15/03 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Computer simulation based on memory of a military officer who alleges he saw a photograph of a crashed saucer near Farmington, New Mexico on file at a military base library open only to personnel with Top Secret access clearances. From Chuck Oldham's 1991 interview with the unidentified officer. Len Stringfield: \"Whatever the reason, the saucer's show of force over Farmington, New Mexico, in March 1950, was indeed a fact and a concern to officialdom. According to Edward Ruppelt, former captain and head of the U.S. Air Force's Project Blue Book, in his book The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects (© 1956): ' ...the sky over the little town of Farmington ... was literally invaded by UFOs. Every major newspaper carried the story. The UFOs had apparently been "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"congregating over the four corners area on March 15 and 16, 1950. But March 17 was the big day when every saucer this side of Polaris must have made a successful rendezvous over Farmington because on that day, most of the town's 3,600 citizens saw the mass fly-by. ...Estimates of the number varied from a conservative 500 to 'thousands.' Most of the observers said the UFOs were saucer-shaped, traveled at almost unbelievable speed and didn't seem to have any set flight paths. ...' For the compiler who lists UFO crashes and/or landings in New Mexico according to location and date, the task is simple. To the analyst, it is a can of worms. Obviously, in my analysis of the Chuck and Vicki Oldham report, the Aztec-Farmington crash, or crashes, is without resolution. But, again, as a compiler, my list continues to grow. I discussed the Oldham report with Tom Adams of Paris, Texas. He received his complimentary copy of the same report from our mutual source (in their exchange of information relative to animal mutilations). As a result, I received st ill another crash story for the Aztec- Farmington area, but with a different year. I have known Adams as publisher of Stigmata, specializing in animal mutilations and UFO-connected research for countless years. In my opinion, his credibility is among the best in the business. I quote from his letter of June 2, 19091, as follows: 'In July 1976, I spoke with a lady, Gloria H. (pseudonym) in Colorado (we had a mutual friend). Gloria told me that her husband's sister, Jane S. (another pseudonym), lived in Farmington and had information about a UFO crash near there in 1950. Gloria said that two people had seen a craft go down behind a hill between Farmington and Aztec, near the highway. (It is assumed, though not known for certain, that it would be Highway 550). The two people, who were apparently both in one car, stopped the car, walked to the top of the hill or ridge, and saw the object on the ground. They returned to their car, got a camera, walked back up the hill, and took photos of the object on the ground. Gloria then said that other motorists had seen the object and stopped to walk up the hill to take a look. The first couple returned to town (they lived in Farmington) and turned in their film for processing the same day. After they received the photos and negatives, they were visited by 'military men' who confiscated the photos and the negatives. 'A few days later, on July 25, 1976, I spoke by telephone with Jane S. She essentially repeated her sister-in-law's story, with a few additions. The witnesses reported seeing a silvery cigar-shaped craft tumbling end-over-end through the air before it finally crashed or landed behind the hill. When the witnesses topped the hill, they saw a saucer-shaped object on the ground - the object that was photographed. Jane's interest in the story had recently been revived by conversations with Gloria. Not long before I talked to her, she had telephoned a man who had worked for the local paper ( Farmington Daily Times ) at the time of the incident. In 1976, he was representing New York Life Insurance in Farmington. He told Jane the exact date of the incident - March 18, 1950. He said he did not recall the identities of the people who photographed the object - but they went back the next day to find the object gone and no traces to indicate it was ever there. The newspaperman was Clayton J. Boddy, business manager at the Daily Times. He is described in news reports as one of the witnesses to the apparent massive UFO over-flight above Farmington the previous day - March 17, 1950 (actually, that was the third of three consecutive days of such over-flights). Clayton Boddy told Jane that he did not see the photos of the landed object, that he only heard about them. However, a mutual acquaintance of theirs told Jane that Boddy had indeed seen the photos and she couldn't understand why he wouldn't admit to it. In the conversation of July 25, 1976, Jane S. also related information about an apparent crash very near Los Alamos, New Mexico. According to her information, the event would have happened about three years previous to our conversation, which would place it in the neighborhood of mid-1973. (I can remember hearing the slightest of rumors concerning a UFO crash near Los Alamos in 1973 or 1974.) Jane said the present (in 1976) fire chief in Farmington had lived in Los Alamos for fifteen years. He did not claim to have witnessed the crash, but only to have 'heard about it.' He said it was close to the 'outer edge' of Los Alamos. He said the crash (or landing?) site was roped off and guarded. The fire chief said he had reason to believe the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"object was a 'space vehicle.' He moved to Farmington just after the crash occurred. At the time, Jane talked to him in 1976, he was very ill. He told her in no uncertain terms that he did not want to talk to anyone else about the incident, nor did he want to become further involved in any way.' THE MYSTERY MIX; LANDINGS AND/OR CRASHES In my endeavor to evaluate the revelations of 'inside' informants, like 'Bob' and 'Dr. Epigoni,' and others with peripheral bits of information, I wonder about the thin line of difference between some UFOs that are described as crash landings and others as just 'landings' or as known in our jargon, touch-landings. Analytical guesses are not good enough; we need facts. But to get facts for a meaningful evaluation, we're on the wrong side of the secrecy wall. However, there are hints or clues. Epigoni tells us about landings with aliens, or robots, in suspended animation; Bob tells us about a landing near White Sands Missile Range within a few days of the Roswell crash and, to pick out a couple more well-publicized cases, we should consider the Socorro, New Mexico, landing in 1964, when police officer. Lonnie Zamora, watched white-suited entities who seemed to be inspecting their troubled egg-shaped craft. Or, let's go back to an incident near West Palm Beach, Florida, in 1952, when scout leader, Sonny DesVerges, encountered a landed craft on the edge of a palmetto thicket. According to DesVerges, a grotesque creature emerged and then he was hit by a ball of red fire, causing temporary time loss. Clues, yes. But in my mundane opinion, the evidence is only a superficial sampling. There are many other samples, too, for which there are no obvious parallels. One is of the grisly kind and if it were not for the integrity of my source, who experienced it, I would prefer not to believe the story. I've known my source, a high-ranking army officer, for several years and I know that he is a straight-shooter. After some consideration, he sent me the following report which occurred in Cambodia during the Vietnam War: 'We have discussed this on several occasions. Let us just say that in April 1972, members of a U. S. Army Special Operations group were involved in a fire fight with the occupants of an identified alien craft. There were several alien casualties and a single human death, although several were burned by an unknown weapon. The soldiers involved were questioned under narco- hypnosis and given a 'cover memory' of a much more benign nature. When the covered memories resurfaced, the truth was that the platoon happened on a group of aliens sorting human body parts (some of which were not native, they were white) into large bins and sealing them. A fire fight ensued and several of the aliens were killed after it was learned that the light silver-colored suits they were wearing were essentially bullet- proof. All but one of the alien casualties resulted from 'head shots.' One alien was killed by 'friendly fire.' As the soldiers pulled back, several of the aliens quickly packed as much as they could. One pressed the side of the craft and a 'gangway' slid down. They all scrambled into the opening, which disappeared as it closed. The hum from the craft increased as it rose and the 'legs' pulled into the body. It then accelerated at a fantastic rate and disappeared from sight. When the unit was picked up, a 'mop up' team cleared the area of any trace. The body of the slain soldier began to decompose almost immediately after death. The unit was held incognito for several days during the interrogation and warned never to discuss the incident. Over the ensuing sixteen years, surviving members suffered nightmares about the incident which were increasingly different from the cover given by post-hypnotic suggestion. When the memories finally surfaced, all personnel involved had nearly identical memories. When agents of the responsible department were queried as to why this was done, there was no denial of the incident - only that they had been 'buying time.' Then the unit was interrogated originally by military personnel and then by civilians who were identified as representatives of 'MAJIC.' They were familiar with this group as all unusual aircraft sightings were reported through channels to 'MAJIC,' although no one knew who they were. Enclosed is an illustration with legend depicting the craft involved.' CRAFT ENCOUNTERED IN MILITARY OPERATION NEAR TON LI SAP, CAMBODIA IN APRIL 1972."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Craft was polished, highly reflective, mirrored in appearance. Symbol on surface seemed to be 'ground' and 'sandblasted' as it was less reflective. No apparent opening or door was seen until just before departure. This was evidently due to an extremely precise fit and the nature of materials involved. Although armor was not readily apparent, the surface was impervious to small arms fire. The craft emitted a high-pitched hum (even while motionless on the ground) and was otherwise nearly silent in its ascent. Legs appeared to be one contiguous piece with a body, but withdrew into the orb during takeoff. Spherical in shape, the craft appeared to be approximately 50 feet in diameter. The encounter and the description of the object were reported directly to civilians who identified themselves as representatives of 'MAJIC.' - Drawing and Text by U. S. Army Officer. NEW INVESTIGATION, NEW DATA, NEW BOOK; UFO CRASH AT ROSWELL From my point of view, I can vouch for the co-authors, Don Schmitt's and Kevin Randle's meticulous investigation before publishing their book, UFO Crash at Roswell (Avon). In their book, if there are voids in the chain of Roswell events, it is probably because the source is deceased or unreachable or unwilling to respond, admitting that he has been sworn to secrecy. The authors, I know, have traveled everywhere in the USA to track down sources. The following statement by the co-authors arrived June 1, 1991, just a week or so before release of their book: 'Something highly unusual crashed in the high desert northwest of Roswell, New Mexico, in the summer of 1947. The United States military reported the recovery of a 'flying disc' and newspapers around the world carried the unprecedented story. The military acted quickly and efficiently in response to the initial report by a local ranch foreman, issuing a press release that declared the recovery of an actual flying disc. Then, the military abruptly changed its original statement, officially classifying the object as a downed 'Rawin Target' balloon. Apparently, officers of the elite 509th Squadron, the only nuclear bomb wing in the world at that time, misidentified the remnants of a very common weather device constructed of mere rubber, foil, wood and twine. And while the cover story was going into effect, 50 to 60 troops were retrieving the actual debris, craft and its crew from two separate sites on the heavily cordoned ranch. The true wreckage, unlike anything the men had ever seen or handled, defied all conventional explanation. Major Jesse Marcel, intelligence officer of the 509th, reported: '...I was certain ...that it was not a weather balloon, not an aircraft, nor a missile. It was something else, we didn't know what it was.' Nine known flights transported the mysterious debris from Roswell under heavy security to at least three government installations. The men who took part in the recovery were sworn to secrecy and one of the most significant events in the history of mankind faded into obscurity. The truth about Roswell was not resurrected until Marcel revealed his role to a reporter, thirty years after the press asked its last question. The provost marshal, who supervised all security measures at the crash-site in 1947, told us that he considered himself still sworn to secrecy forty-three years after the event. So did an intelligence operative who assisted the special oversight team from Washington, D. C. One of the MPs directly involved in"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the recovery of the bodies told us the same. However, even though more than a half-dozen reliable sources give the chief counter-intelligence officer a key role in the recovery, he denies even the downed weather balloon. There is absolutely no denying the government cover-up of what really happened at Roswell, a suppression that continues today. Recently, an even more disturbing aspect of the sinister nature of Roswell has been uncovered. It has been reported to us by six separate witnesses that not only did the United States government resort to physical intimidation against them, but included death threats to their children. We are fortunate to have secured video depositions of a number of them, where they recount their ordeals with extreme emotional distress. The question becomes quite obvious. What event would require: 1. The detainment and coercion of the rancher for a full week? 2. Aerial over-flights which located the second site and the discovery of the craft and crew? 3. Extreme security measures at both sites and at all outlying roads? 4. Fifty to sixty troops who took at least two days to complete the clean up of debris at the site? 5. Special teams from Washington, D. C., including a Secret Service envoy representing President Truman? 6. At least nine flights to transport the wreckage? 7. Sworn oaths of secrecy to key individuals that remain in effect today? 8. Use of death threats to insure both military and civilian cooperation? At present, we are confident that - if given our day in court - Roswell could very well prove the reality of UFOs. Roswell also makes the possibility of other reported CRASH/RETRIEVALS a very real probability. We seek the assistance of all witnesses to all such reported incidents. We also urge all those who have witnessed any of the events surrounding the Roswell incident to add their testimony to the hundreds who have already come forward, as we seek Congressional support for a full investigation. If we fail to act on this opportunity, which grows increasingly urgent, we fear these reports of crashed UFOs will tragically become nothing more than a collection of mundane anecdotal information. 'VERIFICATION IS MY MIDDLE NAME' - STANTON FRIEDMAN Len Stringfield: \" Stanton Friedman needs little introduction as he is a popular figure in UFO research. Residing in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada, Friedman has B.S. and M. S. degrees from the University of Chicago. He worked as a nuclear physicist for GE, General Motors, Westinghouse, Aerojet General Nuclearonics and TRW. Having lectured extensively and written many papers on every aspect of UFOs, including Roswell and MJ-12, I felt that a statement from him was a must. He sent me the following by fax on July 2, 1991: Crashed Saucers © 1991 by Stanton Friedman: 'Because I am a scientist and have lectured on the subject 'Flying Saucers Are Real' at more than 600 colleges and to dozens of professional groups in all 50 states and 8 Canadian provinces, and appeared on hundreds of radio and TV programs, it should not be surprising that people tell me stories about UFOs in general and crashed saucers in particular. My approach to the crashed saucers stories has been rather different from that of Len Stringfield, who has become a magnet for leads about crashes and had collected and published a large number of such leads. I have devoted most of my attention to in-depth investigations of the few crashed saucer cases occurring in New Mexico in July 1947, with some effort regarding later cases there. Verification has"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"become my middle name. Naturally, I have a large 'gray' basket for the unverifiable. I am proud of the fact that I was the first researcher to talk in-depth with Major Jesse Marcel, the Intelligence Officer for the 509th at Roswell; to Vern and Jean Maltais who told me of their friend Barney Barnett's encounter with an almost intact downed UFO with four alien bodies in the Plains of San Agustin (or San Augustin or Saint Augustine); with Walter Haut, the PIO at Roswell; with Glenn Dennis, the mortician in Roswell whose nurse friend described alien bodies to him; with General Thomas J. DuBose, who was directly involved in the Ft. Worth end of the cover-up of the Roswell crash retrieval; and with Gerald Anderson, present with other family members at the Barney Barnett San Agustin site, and a host of others. I was irked by the false picture of the Roswell investigation by Howard Blum in his loaded-with-errors book (Ref. 1). I made major contributions to the book, The Roswell Incident (Ref. 2) and a number of later papers (Ref. 3) by Bill Moore and myself and was heavily involved - thanks to the Fund for UFO research - in investigating the related Operation Majestic 12 documents (Ref. 4, 5) and a new effort to collect data from Roswell witnesses (Ref. 6). My primary goal is verification of stories, prior to publication. I have learned well how to find people and not to trust sincerity as a basis for determining truth. I have also proven that several great stories were a mix of fact and fiction. I am pleased that apparently my substantial efforts to instigate an Unsolved Mysteries program on the Roswell story were successful. On my own, at their expense, I managed to track down Sappho Henderson, wife of pilot Pappy Henderson whose initially unsubstantiated story Len Stringfield told (Ref. 7). Thanks to her giving me names of a number of friends, I managed to track down independent supporting testimony about Pappy's story as noted in my 1991 MUFON paper (Ref. 8). Len was right. The Gerald Anderson story was the focus of much of my Roswell retrieval research work sponsored by Robert Bigelow in the second half of 1990. I got Gerald together with John Carpenter, a psychiatric social worker, who did some memory enhancement hypnosis sessions with Gerald and subtly tested his veracity. Anderson, Carpenter, Bigelow, myself, and Aviation writer, Don Berliner, with whom I am writing a book about crashed saucers, spent three days together in New Mexico. It was only after all this, that I spoke with a Springfield, Missouri newspaper reporter (Ref. 9) about the case. He had already talked to John and Gerald. I find it very distressing that some people in UFOlogy want to dismiss Gerald's story without doing any investigation. It seems apparent in the case of Kevin Randle and Don Schmitt's new book (Ref. 10), that they will do anything to back up their initial and, I believe, demonstrably false, conclusion that there was only one crash on the Brazel ranch southeast of Corona with bodies being found a few miles away. As it happens, there is much evidence that Barney Barnett's experience indeed took place in the Plains and is the same story as Gerald's, and great evidence that Barney was never near Corona in 1947. Randle's and Schmitt's only contact with Gerald Anderson was a single phone call. They also dismiss the Operation Majestic 12 documents with no evidence and no references to the many papers and reports that have been published (Ref. 11). Uninformed attacks on Roswell have come from Philip Klass (Ref. 12) and John Keel (Ref. 13). Keel's Japanese Bomb balloon explanation is absurd indeed, with n evidence to back up the incredibly unsupported claims he makes. Equally incomprehensible is the notion from respected researchers such as historian, Dr. David Jacobs, that governments can't keep secrets. Having spent 14 years working on highly classified R and D programs and hundreds of hours at a total of 14 archives and been duly impressed with the outstanding work of Tim Weiner (Ref. 14) in demonstrating that the U. S. annual Black Budget is over $34 billion per year - I marvel at people who think that secrets can't be kept. It is interesting, indeed, that Phil still has not been able to provide a clean copy of the 75% blacked out 21-page Top Secret affidavit from the National Security Agency justifying withholding 156 UFO documents, nor any of those 156 NSA UFO documents, nor readable copies of the 13 CIA UFO documents the CIA admits withholding, or the many they haven't admitted, in keeping with their disregard for FOIA. Klass still maintains no secrets can be kept! I am especially disappointed with the Randle and Schmitt book because of its"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"use of propagandist reasoning, its casual dismissal of evidence that doesn't fit their view of things, and because of their complete failure to even mention the major support they received from the Fund for UFO Research, or the bunch of MUFON papers about Roswell, the major reports on MJ-12, and their resorting to anonymous sources when it suits them. I worked with them often and know they spent a lot of effort. About the best explanation I can find is that Randle is too much accustomed to being a writer of fiction, having published - according to him - 67 fictional books. Their book is only his third 'non-fiction' work. The lines between what is, and what might be, have become heavily blurred. I certainly hope that the publicity associated with NBC's A Closer Look and CBS's Visitors from the Unknown, and the Randle/Schmitt book, this new collection of Len Stringfield's crash/retrievals (Status Report VI), and finally the Paragon hardcover book by me and Don Berliner, will soon bring forth more of the live witnesses to what really has been happening, and will force the U. S. government to lift the lid on the biggest story of the millennium, the retrieval of crashed alien saucers, alien bodies, new technology and proof that man is not alone. There is indeed a Cosmic Watergate. REFERENCES 1. Blum, Howard, Out There , Simon and Shuster, New York, 1990, 300 pg.

COMMENT "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Len Stringfield: \"Stanton Friedman, a true blue scientist, lets it be known that he seeks only bottom-line verifiable information from his sources - names of witnesses, place names, dates, old records - anything evidential that would convince a hard-nosed skeptic. If all the prerequisites are met, Stan will go to any length to follow up and, justly, let the world know of his accomplishments. Nameless anecdotes go into the circular file. His guidelines are exemplary. Stan's rewards, although falling short of proof, are nonetheless, meaningful. His big scoop was breaking the Jesse Marcel story which opened the floodgates to new sources to \"verify\" the Roswell crash. But, testimonial verification from one source or 300 is not enough. In the final analysis, testimony is not proof and, as I have said many times, it can only come from an official admission that our cumulative information is basically true. Now, one last introspective thought about Roswell. In spite of the massive testimony to support the incident, I cannot help but wonder about the turn of events if the Marcels or the Brazels or anyone had surreptitiously retained a scrap of substance from the debris field and offered it to a civilian research lab for analysis. A smoking gun - maybe the proof? As Stan and I both know, our methodologies differ. I, too, seek verification from my sources. If, for a good reason it is not accessible, my policy is that if my contacts can give me a good gut feeling after they provide checkable references attesting to a creditable lifestyle, I will publish their material. Such is the case with Tim Cooper who has shared the identities of his sources with me, but it was on a clear-cut basis that they cannot be otherwise compromised. To go a step further, even in cases where my contacts such as Ron Madeley and Chuck Oldham - who did not share the names of their sources - I, again, feel duty-bound, and privileged, to publish their disclosures. As I have said before, information of potential importance is useless if I hide it in the back of my sock drawer. There is always the hope that my contact, or his source, personally might make further disclosures; or better still, that new sources might surface with corroborative information.\" Continued in Part 13, Kecksburg, Pennsylvania crash of acorn-shaped craft.
