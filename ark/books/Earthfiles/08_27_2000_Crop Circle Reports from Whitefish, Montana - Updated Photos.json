August 27, 2000 Whitefish, Montana - This is the third year in a row that a crop formation in wheat has appeared in Whitefish, Montana in the first half of August. When pilot Gilbert Johnson flew over the latest formation on August 15th, he might have been the first to discover and photograph it. The next day on August 16th, Mary and Larry Johnson, who own a health food store in town, saw the formation from Church Avenue near trees that completely obscured the "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"pictogram from nearby and well-traveled Highway 93. The couple asked the farm owners for permission to enter and told people in town about it. Melody Watts, who runs a convenience store in Whitefish and investigated the formation in Whitefish last year, heard about the new formation while driving back from a vacation on August 20th. She was so excited, she first went to the farm owner for permission to get into the new formation before even driving home. Then she returned in the evening. Interview: Melody Watts, Convenience Store Owner, Whitefish, Montana: \" I had my camcorder all recharged and all my cameras. And as I walked in, I was filming and my camcorder battery lasts for at least eight hours. And I knew it was completely charged up. I filmed for awhile and all of a sudden the battery light starts flashing after about twenty minutes in the circle. THAT MEANS YOU HAD A CAMCORDER WITH A NEW BATTERY THAT DRAINED DOWN IN 15 TO 20 MINUTES AFTER BEING IN T H AT F O R MAT IO N ? Ye s . HAD THAT HAPPENED TO YOU BEFORE IN THE OTHER TWO FORMATIONS IN 1999 AND 1998? I did not get to investigate the one in 1998. And the 1999 one on Highway 40 about five to seven miles as the crow flies from these other ones, that one I did not have my camcorder in there. But I did see oddities with a compass. It wouldn't hold a directional signal. IN 1999? Ye s . WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE COMPASS IN THIS ONE IN 2000? The compass that I took in wouldn't hold a direction. And also, as we were doing the aerial shots, I told the pilot (Gilbert Johnson) about some oddities with compasses. He said, 'Well, to test a real signal, you fly from north to south and south to north. And as we got directly over top of the formation, his compass swayed and his mouth fell wide open. He couldn't believe it. So, he had to turn around and go back and it swayed both directions. Both times, about a ten degrees sway on his compass. He was very in awe of that.\" Pilot Sees Compass Shift Flying Over Whitefish Wheat Formation I called up Gilbert Johnson who has been flying since 1957 and now runs a charter service and flight school. I asked him to explain what happened with the compass when he flew over the Whitefish wheat formation. Gilbert Johnson, pilot since 1957, runs charter service and flight school, Kalispell, Montana: \"I was staring at the compass. We (Melody and Gilbert) had just talked about it. She mentioned that - we were talking about crop formations - and she happened to mention that there was compasses that shifted. So, I was curious. So, I held it real steady and we were going right over it. I could have dropped a flour bag and hit the center of it when it happened. It all of a sudden, BOOM, she just shifted fifteen degrees and the airplane didn't move, you know, left wing up, down or anything. I'm pretty certain that something happened. 60% certain."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"HOW CLOSE WERE YOU TO THE GROUND AT THAT POINT? 500 feet. I told her we can't get any lower than 500 feet because of the law. There are people in cars and stuff down there. So, I got her down to the minimum. I saw it shift and I had the airplane steady. I perceived a 15 degree shift and I was going straight and level. And there wasn't any turbulence. Now, I turned around. I made a 180 and went out about a mile and came back exactly and tried to get over the same spot. OVER THE FORMATION IN WHITEFISH? Right. And what happened was - I got right over it. I didn't get anything. I thought, that's strange. We're right over it and I didn't get anything where I got a shift before. So, it could have been some kind of anomaly. Maybe I got a bump and didn't realize it. You know, in the air pressure. I mean, the air rising with the heat and stuff. So, then I continued on about 150 to 200 yards passed the crop circles and I got a 10 degree shift. YOU GOT A 15 DEGREE COMING ONE WAY... Yeah, heading towards the north. THEN YOU TURNED AROUND AND CAME SOUTH .... Yeah, and I got a 10 degree shift, but in a different location after I flew over it, south of it. WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO SEEING THAT COMPASS ANOMALY? My eyes bugged out. (laughs)\" Melody Watts: MELODY, ANY OTHER ANOMALIES? I did get the pictures back. I took some pictures late in the evening after sunset and I got some odd spheres in the sky, those little balls of light. There was nothing at the time that I saw with my eyes. August 26, 2000, Melody Watts took flash camera photographs inside the Whitefish, Montana formation. This frame had one clear translucent sphere and echoes of other fainter ones. Similar photographs in crop formations and sacred sites have been taken by many people the past few years. Low energy plasmas is one hypothesis, but nothing has yet been proved.

It's pretty odd. I didn't expect anything until I got my film back. I couldn't take enough pictures, of course, knowing that the farmer was going to destroy it soon. So, I sat in the middle of the formation and would take pictures around us to see if I got any oddities. And to my surprise, I did. I could not see anything when I was there. THAT'S THE TRANSLUCENT SPHERE? Yes. It was very dry. There was no moisture in the air. My lens was clean because my other pictures had come out of the same camera. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT NOW ABOUT THE FLOOR LAY IN THIS 2000 FORMATION COMPARED TO WHAT YOU SAW IN 1999? No, the wheat was all laid counter-clockwise in the whole formation. All of it was laid in the same direction, counter-clockwise, even in the small circles on the outside of the ring. And the centers were all going in a counter-clockwise direction. DID YOU LOOK FOR ANY OF THE NODE EXPULSIONS OR LENGTHENED NODES? I think I see them, but I'm not an expert in that field. It looks like there are a few blown nodes that Nancy has been talking about. THERE WERE HOLES IN THE NODES THEMSELVES. Yes, as far as I can see. There are.\" The BLT Research Team coordinated by Nancy Talbott for biophysicist W. C. Levengood has sampled soil and plants from the Whitefish, Montana formation for further evidence of biochemical and biophysical changes as confirmed in hundreds of other formations investigated around the world. In addition to Whitefish in the United States, there have been four formations in wheat in North Dakota (See: Earthfiles August 20, 2000) and Nancy Talbott of the BLT Research Team says she has received reports of new formations from Mantee, Utah, Whiskey Hill Road, Oregon and Owatonna, Minnesota. The farmer harvested the Whitefish, Montana formation within days of its discovery.

Paul Anderson, Director of Circles Phenomenon Research Canada at http://www.geocities.com/cpr-canada, keeps a running summary. The most recent was discovered by a crop duster pilot on August 20th in a wheat field near Moosomin, Saskatchewan. Paul Anderson, Director, Circles Phenomenon Research Canada, Vancouver, British Columbia: \"This one is like the old this one is like the old, classic dumbbell configuration about 220 feet long. The large main circle is about 120 feet diameter. And the smaller circle with it is about 60 feet and the pathway connecting the two is about 40 feet long and 5 feet wide. The crop inside the pathway is flowing in two opposite directions coming from each circle towards the center of the pathway which is a bit unusual.

Before that, we had a report from Grenfell, Saskatchewan not too far from this other location (on August 10.) It's a very small 10 foot circle, actually a baby formation, if you will. But what's interesting about this one is that it has a radial lay pattern. Again, this is in wheat. THIS IS WHERE IT COMES DOWN IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN SPLAYS VERY STRAIGHTLY OUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"That's right. Sprayed out from the center point in all directions to the outer edges of the circle. So, again, it's a very small one but it has that unusual lay pattern. And even the reporter who first reported it to me thought it was so unusual that he had never seen anything like that before. So, he thought it was worth reporting about and he has taken some close-up photographs and from a step ladder just to get some elevation on it. And I should have those in the next day or two. AT YOUR WEB SITE? Yes, and of the dumbbell as well. WHEN WAS THE RADIAL LAY REPORTED? That would have been August 10th which is the same day, within a day or two of what we know, that the formation in Ontario was discovered which is a 3 circle pattern. The largest circle about 60 feet in diameter, excuse me, 70 feet, and the smallest one approximately 30 feet in diameter. So, again, it's a very simple configuration, but beautifully laid down from people who have been inside it. But unfortunately by now, it's been trampled to death by over 1,000 visitors. And that was just a very simple formation. Nothing else standing like you get in England. And yet, they've already had over 1,000 people go through it. August 10, 2000 three circles discovered in a barley and oats field within Oro-Medonte Township, Ontario. Farmer's dogs refused to go anywhere near the formation. Photograph © 2000 by © Julie Langpeter, The Orillia Packet & Times. \"The one thing we've had reported from the farmer in Ontario was - and is something you've heard, of course, and we've heard many times now - is that his dogs refused to go anywhere near the formation. They wouldn't go inside it. They wouldn't go near it. And that seemed to change a bit over time for a couple of weeks after. But initially, they wouldn't go near the thing. AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LONG PICTOGRAM FORMATION IN THE EAST FIELD LAST YEAR IS THE DOGS, MANY ANIMALS, WOULD NOT GO IN THAT LONG PICTOGRAM. Yeah, it's like they sense something, pick up on the energy, I don't know what. They can sense something that we don't, I think. I always want people to keep in mind and realize that this isn't just something that goes on in England every summer. It's global. I mean, just on my list this summer, I've got some fifteen countries listed.\" Other Crop Formation High Strangeness From Around the World"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Deutsche Press-Agentur (dpa) reported on July 26, 2000 that \"farmers in Poland are scratching their heads at the sight of several baffling crop circles which appeared in wheat fields at three separate locations in the country. Villagers in Wylatow, northern Poland, are dazzled by the precision of four circles measuring 8 to 10 meters in diameter in isolated wheat fields. Some reported an unearthly glow above the fields the night the circles appeared. The month before on June 24, 2000, the BBC reported about \"the overnight appearance of crop circles in a field in southern Russia which has puzzled farmers.\" In a barley field near the village of Yuzhnoye, Stavropol Territory, there were four circles: one 20 meters in diameter in the center and three outer ones 5-7 meters in diameter each. All the barley circles had been laid down in a clockwise direction. According to the BBC, representatives of the Stavropol security council arrived at the farm and tried to suppress all reports of what happened. But some eyewitnesses in a neighboring village spoke out about seeing a \"UFO land in the field. Eyewitnesses say that the landing was very quick and the take-off was immediate.\" According to officials, a 20 centimeter-deep cylindrical hole with \"polished walls\" was found in the center of the large circle.
