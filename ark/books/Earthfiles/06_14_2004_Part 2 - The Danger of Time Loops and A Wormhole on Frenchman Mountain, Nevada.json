Wormholes may also link parallel or baby universes and could provide the possibility of time travel.\" \"( There could be) observers who would be trapped in a finite region before the timeline horizon and would go around and around faster and faster until they reached the speed of light in a finite time. So, if a beautiful alien in a flying saucer invites you into her time machine, step with care. You might fall into one of these trapped repeating histories of only finite duration.\" The Universe in a Nutshell © 2001 by Stephen Hawking, Theoretical Physicist and Mathematician Wormhole illustration on Page 483, Black Holes & Time Warps © 1994 by Kip S. Thorne. Previous Part 1 June 14, 2004 Las Vegas, Nevada - On the May 30, 2004, field trip to the Vishnu Schist Great Unconformity east of Las Vegas, Dan Burisch, Ph.D., microbiologist, hypothesized that perhaps one of the reasons the life-programming ganesh particles were at the Frenchman Mountain site was because he and his colleagues had also discovered an Einstein-Rosen Bridge (ERB) wormhole there on the mountain which might have originally transported the ganesh particles from Somewhere Else in the universe. With Dr. Burisch was his work colleague, Marcia A. McDowell, who was in charge of the ERB investigation at Frenchman Mountain. What she told us about the wormhole was chilling and those dangers are reinforced by theoretical physicist and mathematician, Stephen Hawking, in his 2001 book, The Universe In A Nutshell. The Danger of Time Travel by Stephen Hawking \"Time travel is possible in a region of spacetime in which there are time loops, paths that move at less than the speed of light but which nevertheless manage to come back to the place and time they started because of the warping of spacetime. Since I have assumed there were no time loops in the distant past, there must be what I call a time travel 'horizon,' the boundary separating the region of time loops from the region without them. \"Time travel horizons are rather like black hole horizons. While a black hole horizon is formed by light rays that just miss falling into the black hole, a time travel horizon is formed by light rays on the verge of meeting up with themselves. I then take as my criterion for a time machine what I call a finitely generated horizon that is, a horizon that is formed by light rays that all emerge from a bounded region. In other words, they don't come in from infinity or from a singularity, but originate from a finite region containing time loops the sort of region our advanced civilization (of time "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"travelers) is supposed to create. Stephen Hawking's artistic rendition of an alien time machine in which an ERB wormhole on the left would be used for rapid transportation point-to-point around the universe. Page 143, The Universe In A Nutshell © 2001 by Stephen Hawking. \"In adopting this definition as the footprint of a time machine, we have the advantage of being able to use the machinery that Roger Penrose and I developed to study singularities and black holes. Even without using the Einstein equations, I can show that in general, a finitely generated horizon will contain a light ray that actually meets up with itself -that is, a light ray that keeps coming back to the same point over and over again. Each time the light came around it would be more and more blue-shifted, so the images would get bluer and bluer. The wave crests of a pulse of light will get closer and closer together and the light will get around in shorter and shorter intervals of its time. In fact, a particle of light would have only a finite history, as defined by its own measure of time, even though it went around and around in a finite region and did not hit a curvature singularity. Does spacetime admit timelike curves that are closed, returning to their starting point again and again, repeating cycles in time? Page 139, The Universe In A Nutshell © 2001 by Stephen Hawking. \"One might not care if a particle of light completed its history in a finite time. But I can also prove that there would be paths moving at less than the speed of light that had only finite duration. These could be the histories of observers who would be trapped in a finite region before the horizon and would go around and around faster and faster until they reached the speed of light in a finite time. So if a beautiful alien in a flying saucer invites you into her time machine, step with care. You might fall into one of these trapped repeating histories of only finite duration.\" \"These could be the histories of observers who would be trapped in a finite region before the (timeline) horizon and would go around and around faster and faster until they reached the speed of light in a finite time. ...You might fall into one of these trapped repeating histories of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"only finite duration.\" Page 144, The Universe In A Nutshell © 2001 by Stephen Hawking. Further, Dr. Hawking asks, \"Could an advanced civilization go back and change the past?\" He writes that theoretically it is now possible that \"space time could be warped so much that you could go off in a spaceship and come back before you set out. One way this could happen is if there were wormholes, tubes of spacetime that connect different regions of space and time. The idea is that you steer your spaceship into one mouth of the wormhole and come out of the other mouth in a different place and at a different time. Wormholes, if they exist, would be the solution to the speed limit (of light) in space: it would take tens of thousands of years to cross the galaxy in a spaceship that traveled at less than the speed of light, as relativity demands. But you might go through a wormhole to the other side of the galaxy and be back in time for dinner. However, one can show that if wormholes exist, you could also use them to get back before you set out.\" \"If there was a wormhole with its two ends close together, you could walk through the wormhole and come out at the same time\" that you left - or even before!

Interview: Wormhole and Creature Transportation at Frenchman Mountain, Nevada Dan Burisch, Ph.D., Microbiologist: \"There was an extremely negative event boy, does that put it mildly! right behind you (the rock Linda Howe was sitting on). In fact, when I was filming the event, I was sitting on that large rock. It happened right there. We got an unexpected electromagnetic surge and this happened on July 20, 2001 (two months after first ganesh particle flare of green light) we got an unexpected electromagnetic surge. It was caused because I added too much energy to the rock and was also trying to magnify the biophotonic bursts with the use of a Class 3 laser. I started literally feeling as though I was sinking into the rock. Started feeling like I was graying out, ready to pass out sinking down into the rock which is probably the gauss levels as they were going up and did not know at the time that there was an event actually within the equipment. We only discovered that there was an event that something looked like it had poked its head up - something that looked very strangely grey alien-type shape - poked its head up and was looking back at the world around us. Or maybe it was just an image. We don't know. We only found this out days after when we were re-running the videotape (Dan took) and it was at the very end of the tape. As I was shutting equipment down I was being warned to shut the equipment down via radio and I shut the equipment down just at the time that this thing was popping out, if you will. WAS THE CREATURE COMING OUT OF A ROUND HOLE IN THE AIR? Let me describe what the equipment looked like. It was a rectangular solid with a crystal quartz suspended in a gel with a laser plummeting the crystal. Electricity was added to the gel and the amperage was increased. All of a sudden, we got an electromagnetic burst from it setting here. The bottom of this equipment was setting in contact with the ground. Through the disc that we had positioned - which was like a lens so that we could see what was going on underneath through the disk is where this thing emerged. WAS IT A J-ROD OR SOMETHING ELSE? I don't know what it was. We've got nice pictures of it, nice freeze frames of it. IT REMINDS ME OF WHAT HAPPENED IN UTAH WITH THE NIDS RANCH (National Institute of Discovery Science), BIGELOW'S RANCH. A PORTAL OPENED UP AND A TALL, BLACK THING CAME THROUGH."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"If what we saw here was a real organism, it would have been extremely small for its morphology because it appeared to have an anthropomorphic shape. But I think we were looking at an image of Elsewhere. THAT COULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME IN UTAH, TOO. Yeah, I don't think it was physically here. But where it would have ended up if we had kept the equipment running? I don't know. But I think we were looking at an image (holographic?). DAN, WAS THIS A WORMHOLE LINK? AN ERB? This was an emission of energy that resulted in that data, seeing something that appeared to be from Elsewhere.\" \"Shadow beings\" step from \"hole\" that opened up in the middle of teenager Linda Porter's room in 1961 near Covina, California, with a J-Rod type entity standing nearby.

DO YOU THINK WE'RE STILL GOING TOWARD A DENSE AREA OF WORMHOLES IN 2012? We're headed toward a dense area, yes. (But even on Earth now) these things (manmade ERB machines) could, theoretically, if they were allowed to spread, be sold, traded or whatever, they could theoretically be spread throughout the globe. And that in fact is what I understood is one of the events of a catastrophism timeline because they would be spread throughout the globe or throughout a large region of the globe. They would then activate (by the dense patch of cosmic worm holes) and we would be in trouble! THEY WOULD ACTIVATE BY WORMHOLES? They would activate by the natural energy coming from the wormholes and also, what would happen is that once they would activate, they would draw more energy in. At that time in December 2012, there is going to be a fairly large burst from the sun. The nature of the burst, I'm not exactly sure because that's not my thing. But that, coupled by the activation of the star gates would be enough to do the majority of the human population in. WOULD IT SE T OFF A SKY FIRE ? However it happens, I think so, yes. I'm aware that there would be a great tectonic movement. Essentially, there would be a geological pole shift, as well as the magnetic one. The magnetic one is taken care of from the solar wind.\" Implications of the Lotus Project Discoveries at Frenchman Mountain WOULD THE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THAT PROGRAMMING IN THE SILICON DIOXIDES HELP THE J-RODS? One faction of the J-Rods (referred to as \"rogue\") thought that it would and hence, used it as a power chip for a signature for the T-9 Treaty (a treaty between the U.S. and the J-Rods signed between May 15 to June 8, 2004.) Will it help them, no. Once they got a look at the content of the Lotus Model, once the model was produced, then they were able to access the Yellow Book (3-dimensional history about Earth, Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2, timeline"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"anomaly and other data). Once they accessed the Yellow Book, they saw what implications it could bring for their future. That was disaster (for them) because they would literally be touching something they should not be touching. So, they stepped back from it, from what I hear. But that's only what I've been told. AND THAT WHICH THEY WOULD TOUCH WOULD BE WHAT? The fruit of the Tree of Life. From this Lotus Model theory, one can access by direct data the 27 spheres, or the 27 blue apples, which compose the Metatron's Cube. From there, all of the Platonic solids can be emerged. If you can properly modulate that which can be done with the (Lotus) model, then you can literally create life. And that's not for us to do.\" Metatron's Cube and Platonic Solids Metatron's Cube drawn by Charles Gilchrist. Metatron's Cube contains all the mathematical relationships in the Tree of Life and the five Platonic Solids that the ancient Greek philosopher, Plato, described in his Timaeus as the building blocks of the matter world. There are only five solids in which all sides are equal and all angles are the same and all faces are identical. In each corner of such a solid the same number of surfaces collide. Tetrahedron - 4 sides of equilateral triangles. It has the smallest volume for its surface and represents the property of dryness. Plato equated the tetrahedron to fire. Four sides of tetrahedron. Cube, or Hexahedron - 6 sides of squares. The hexahedron, standing firmly on its base and Plato equated it to the stable Earth. Six sides of cube, or hexhedron. Octahedron - 8 sides of equilateral triangles. It rotates freely when held by two opposite vertices and Plato equated it to air."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Eight equilateral triangle sides of octahedron. Dodecahedron - 12 sides of equilateral pentagons. Plato equated this solid to the universe because the zodiac has twelve signs corresponding to the twelve faces of the dodecahedron. Twelve equilateral pentagon sides of dodechahedron. I cosahedron - 20 sides of equilateral triangles. It has the largest volume for its surface area and represents the property of wetness. Plato equated the icosahedron to water. 20 equilateral triangle sides of icosahedron. The Kabbalah teaches that its knowledge was transmitted to mankind by the Archangel Metatron. A key is to comprehend geometry as a universal language - perhaps the cosmic language - that describes the smallest to the largest in this universe, both at seen and unseen levels. Underlying everything are mathematical rules of construction that define how matter and energy unfold and evolve. Writer Nigel Pennick wrote in his 1994 book, Sacred Geometry, Symbolism and Purpose in Religious Structures , \"Because geometry is an image of the structure of the cosmos, it can readily be used as a symbolic system for understanding various features of the universe. ...Since the earliest times, geometry has been inseparable from magic. Even the most archaic rock-scribings are geometrical in form. These hint at a notational and invocational system practiced by some ancient priesthood. Because the complexities and abstract truths expressed by geometrical forms could only be explained as reflections of the innermost truths of the world, they were held to be sacred mysteries of the highest order and were shielded from the eyes of the profane (general public).\" Continued in Part 3 - People Disappeared in ERB on Frenchman Mountain More Information: Albert Einstein, Nathan Rosen and Einstein-Rosen Bridges In his classic book, A Brief History of Time © 1988 and 1996, Stephen Hawking wrote: \"In 1935, Albert Einstein and Nathan Rosen wrote a paper in which they showed that general relativity allowed what they called \"bridges,\" but which are now known as wormholes. The Einstein-Rosen bridges didn't last long enough for a spaceship to get through: the ship would run into a singularity as the wormhole pinched off. However, it has been suggested that it might be possible for an advanced civilization"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"to keep a wormhole open. To do this, or to warp space-time in any other way so as to permit time travel, one can show that one needs a region of space-time with negative curvature, like the surface of a saddle. Ordinary matter, which has a positive energy density, gives space-time a positive curvature, like the surface of a sphere. So, what one needs in order to warp space-time in a way that will allow travel into the past, is matter with negative energy density.

He is 40 years old now, born on February 2, 1964. His birth certificate name was Danny B (no period) Crain. I have met and talked with his mother, Dodie Crain, and with Dan who confirm the name change and reason for it. Copy of Danny B Crain (aka Dan Burisch) \"Certificate of Live Birth\" at 4:28 a.m. on February 2, 1964, in St. Francis Hospital in Lynwood, California - a suburb of Los Angeles. Birth certificate provided by \"Dodie\" Crain. In 1990, Dan married Deborah Kay Burisch who had a child from a previous marriage. Five years later in 1995, Dan legally changed his last name from Crain to Burisch to match the child's legal last name. In 1989, as Dan Crain graduated from SUNY Stonybrook with a Ph.D. in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Dan was at the same time employed by the U. S. Navy's DOD Naval Research Laboratory. His rank was Captain and his title Microbiologist IV. In 1994, he was assigned to work in an underground laboratory at S-4/5 at Area 51, five floors under the Papoose Mountain installation at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The fifth floor is accessible only by one secure elevator. Dr. Burisch told me that in the year 1994, he suited up in the fifth floor underground laboratory like an astronaut with breathing and urination hoses. His assignment was to enter a round \"clean sphere\" filled with a cold atmosphere of 4% by volume hydrogen, argon and other gases. Inside the clean sphere was an entity originally called \"extraterrestrial\" by his government superiors and later described as a \"time traveler\" from 50,000 years in the future. According to Dr. Burisch, his boss reported to a MAJI committee, an extension of the Majestic-12 Special Studies Group organized by President Harry S. Truman in 1947. Majestic 12 included top scientific, military and business leaders asked to study the extraterrestrial phenomenon. Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
