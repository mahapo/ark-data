Source and references: MUFON submitter 9840. Location and photographer unidentified in MUFON report. Description of Sighting Report At MUFON Site “This object floated above the river for maybe less than 30 seconds, rotating slightly, then winking out. My wife freaked out because we were st ill a bout 40 minutes from takeout and had know where to go. We paddled over to the side and sat in the woods for about 20-30 minutes, but the mosquitos were eating us alive, so we got back in the water. I got one photo off before it dissapeared. About 10 seconds before it dissappeared, another circle thing seemed to pop out of the center, which is when my wife started screaming at me to take a picture, and that's what you see. I really don't want to know what it was, b ecause to this day it gives us the creeps, but since I saw the other one my wife thought it might be best to share the experience. I'm not going to mention the name of the river because our cabin is near there.\" Photo: http://www.mufoncms.com/files /9840_submitter_file1__2002-07-2600012.jpg "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 2) Subject: McAlester, Oklahoma Army Ammunition Plant Date: March 7, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “ I'm from McAlester, Oklahoma, and am familiar with the McAlester, Oklahoma, Army Ammunition Plant and the Hartshorne area. My father, uncle and an aunt worked at the plant for many years. I remember my aunt, now deceased, te lling me a bout an event that happened, probably in the 1980s, as she was working the night shift in one of the plant buildings. She said that one morning the power went out in her building around 2-3 a.m. The power remained off and eventually her supervisor sent everyone home. My aunt lived in Hartshorne, Oklahoma and she was part of a carpool of ladies who also lived in the Hartshorne area. From the plant to Hartshorne is approximately 10 to 15 miles. As they were entering the Hartshorne area, one of the ladies spotted a bright ball of light hovering over nearby railroad tracks. The light, which my aunt said was very unusual, began to pace their car and eventually disappeared. She said they were all very frightened, but they made it to their respective homes without further incident. The next night, my aunt reported the incident with the bright ball of light to her supervisor. Her supervisor told her he had seen a bright ball of light outside their building before the power went out the previous night. ....................................... I also remember talking many years ago to a McAlester veterinarian. I had heard through a friend that the vet had photographs of r ecently mutilated cattle near the little town of Arpaler, just west of McAlester, and just north, I believe, from the Ammunition Plant. My friend and I went to see the vet and he showed us the photos. To me, they looked like the typical, mysterious mutilation scenario. I urged him to contact you, but I don't know if he ever did. ................................ Finally, this is an event that changed my life in terms of the UFO mystery. In 1957, I was a student at East Central State College in Ada, Oklahoma. Ada is about 60 miles west of McAlester. One cloudless spring afternoon, a friend and I were walking across campus just after we had gotten off work. I happened to glance up at the sky to my left and I was startled to see a traditional ‘flying saucer,’ motionless in the sky. My friend also saw it. At the same time a professor was walking toward us, but before I could call his attention to the ‘craft,’ it zoomed off to the southwest at blazing speed.” 3) Subject: Homeland Security Ban On Infrared Cameras. Date: March 5, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “Hi Linda, I am a photography professor at a major college in the Midwest. Our department recently placed a purchase order for a infrared digital st ill camera. We were shipped the normal spectrum version of the camera with no explanation. When I called the NYC photo suppliers, I was informed that Homeland Security has placed a ban on the sale of ALL digital still and video cameras with infrared capability! Only law enforcement or other agencies can buy them with approval from the manufacturer. They cannot be shipped, but must be picked up in person. An end user license must be completed in the store. I immediately r ecalled your recent talk on Coast to Coast AM about there being ‘something’ in the infrared spectrum our government does not want us to see. Our photo program merely wanted to buy the infrared camera for the interesting landscape photographs IR is capable of recording. You can verify my email by following this link to the Major Photo retailer. Earlier this year, Eastman Kodak suddenly and without warning stopped making"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"infrared film, which had been available for decades. No reason was given, but I now believe this ban came from Homeland Security. Clearly there is something in the infrared spectrum that the general public is not being permitted to see, or record.” E ditor's Note: I have not been able to verify a Homeland Security official, or unofficial, ban on the sale of infrared cameras. When I learn more, I'll report at Earthfiles. I welcome viewer comments and personal experiences: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
