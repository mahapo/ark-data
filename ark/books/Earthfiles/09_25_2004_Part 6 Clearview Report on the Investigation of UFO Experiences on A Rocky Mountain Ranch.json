He has had people tell him that they saw mutilations being done that he would not talk about, or who was doing it and why.\" - Colorado rancher Click to Part 1 \" Barbara: I think the only other person I have talked to, who has had as many experiences as I have, is the law officer (Sheriff George Yarnell's Deputy, Bill Waugh). And, if he'll open up, he's had some lulus. But again, what he has told me, has been in confidence. The things I have repeated, he has told in front of other people. Roger has said that he would tell what he has seen and Harry said he would tell what he has seen. Again, I feel that each person has to do what he thinks is right. We still have all the pictures that Roger t ook. He took pictures of the footprints and pictures of the cattle that were mutilated. I told him that for the sake of the county, these cannot be released to anybody. We subsequently became friends, so I trust him. We could never live there if the pictures were released. I would release them to you or a group, in confidence. But I would never let them be released to the media. That's one of the things that we have lived in absolute dread fear of that someone that came out there who was inexperienced, would go and tell someone else and then say, 'Let's go out and see.' Investigator: I'm trying to think in my own mind, where do we go from here? I think this could very well be a unique situation. I'm not fa miliar with anything else as extensive over a period of time. There were so many sightings. Barbara: That's because we stayed there. Investigator: Right exactly. Not only does it appear to be the most comprehensive set of sightings that I know if, but also there's something st ill going on so that it is an excellent opportunity to investigate. It cries out for an investigation with some sort of instrumentation. Jim: This has been my interest. Investigator: What could we do? One of the thoughts I had was to use some seismic exploration techniques to find the mine. From what you say, stringing a bunch of wires on the ground could be a very interesting thing! Jim: It usually gets a very good reaction, especially a strange showing up and doing it. I'm sure that if a person really desired an encounter, they could quickly facilitate one. I believe that very strongly. One other thing has happened a number of times to people who did not know what was happening and came out to the ranch for the first time. After being there a few hours, they would say, 'There is something very strange "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"about this. I feel very uncomfortable.' Somehow you feel that if all these people tell you, it validates it somewhat. Barbara: That's the point that Jim got across to me, that if you talked to that many people, you could piece together a lot of validity and from a lot of points of view. That I do understand no two people see something exactly the same. Jim: Like the law officer you can tell from talking to him that he is a no-nonsense law officer type. I would rate his credibility extremely high. Each person has his own level of credibility. Roberta's, for example, is very low. She will see Venus or airplane lights and think it's a UFO. Some people, like the law officer, know a whole lot more than they even told me. And I think he would tell a great deal of it, if he could feel safe doing so. He doesn't want to lose his job and he doesn't want to be blackballed in the county. But from what I picked up from him, he wants to talk to somebody about it. He's very upset and he wants to have it settled. They requested that the FBI come in and one FBI agent allegedly went out and talked to them. It just made it worse. Nobody really wants to know what is happening. Barbara: When they had one mutilation, the law officer (Sheriff George Yarnell) cut a strip himself with a knife and sent it to the CBI. The lab sent a report back saying it had been done by wild animals. I did not hear him say this, but this is what we were told. He felt that he was being given a lot of wrong information and he wanted to see if this was true. ( Editor's Note from Linda Howe: I personally talked with Elbert County Sheriff George Yarnell (now deceased) in 1980 about his animal mutilation investigations and he told me how he used his own knife to cut out a mutilator's cut, notched it, kept the matching notch as his evidence, sent the tissue to CBI which sent it on to the Colorado State University's Veterinarian Diagnostic Laboratory in Fort Collins. Sheriff Yarnell was furious when he receive back a report that the tissue had been severed by predators. He called up Carl Whiteside, Director of the Colorado Bureau of Investigation and demanded a meeting with the CSU people and CBI. The event proved to Sheriff Yarnell that he and other law enforcement were always not getting the forensic truth.) Jim: There are a lot of things I don't think he would tell me, for the same reason that I hesitated to tell you particularly after I laughed at him once. But I think with someone he felt comfortable and secure with, he would tell a whole lot more. He indicated to me that a whole lot more things happened. ( Editor's Note from Linda Howe: Sheriff Yarnell told me about one night he received approval from a local airport to do an aerial stake out without navigation lights over a particular Elbert County area that was having animal mutilations. In the small plane were the pilot, Deputy Bill Waugh and Sheriff Yarnell sitting in the back behind the pilot. Sheriff Yarnell said he was looking for unusual light activity. Suddenly, the pilot yelled, sounding scared, and at the same moment Sheriff Yarnell saw that ground lights were blacked out by a perfect circle of solid blackness below their plane. For more than a minute, the black circle stayed directly below them until as suddenly as it appeared, it disappeared.) A lot of these I can't relate because I'm in the position where I can't tell what he has not given me permission to tell. But there is a whole lot more, and I feel there is more even than he told me because he alone was doing the police work in the county. He (Sheriff Yarnell) has personally seen the ships going into the ground. He has had people tell him that they saw mutilations being done that he would not talk about or who was doing it and why. A lot of other things, he just clammed up on. Trust "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Barbara: Remember the people who lived over on that back section? He had had some really strange experiences, too. They had a mutilation, like about 50 yards from their house in full view of the kitchen window and she had been in the kitchen within the time span that it had to have happened and had never seen anything. This was in the daylight, early morning hours. That happens quite often. I don't know how much you have read about the mutilations, but quite often it is in plain sight of the road. They try to track it down and find that somebody went by at 2 o'clock and somebody went by at 4 o'clock and at 2 it was not there and at 4 it was. That's not unusual. But anyway, he came over one day to talk to us and to ask us some questions and said that his father wanted to put up a big radar thing, but he could not get permission to do it. I never heard what came of that. I know they moved. Jim: I think that's the thing unless somebody opens up and invites someone to come in, investigation would be impossible. I told Barbara that we lived in the county and were just as guilty as the rest by putting the lid on everything. Nobody would talk and we were accessories because we were afraid of the same sort of ostracism that everyone was. Barbara: I think if you could get the point across to your UFO investigators that there is a need for absolute confidentiality, maybe you could find out something. If it had only happened to Jim and me, we would never be here. Jim: If an investigation was done by a professional group in the interests of protecting the United States, those people would absolutely cooperate. It would have to be approached from that basis, that somehow they were doing something good. I think on that basis, almost everyone would step forward and tell what they know, if it was an accepted thing to do. I think if the law officer and a few of the other people were approached on the basis of confidentiality, on the basis that it is the right thing to do, and that it w ill never stigmatize them, I believe they would come forward. I really believe that, don't you? Barbara: I think a good many of them would. Jim: The investigation would never leak to the outside. Everyone would know that it was going on, but as far as it leaving the county, it would be the same thing that somehow they would be committing an offense by telling. They have a protective thing to each other. If someone was interviewed, no one would tell. Part of the reason that I have told you everything that has happened to me is that in order to get the law officer to talk openly, I have to tell him that I told everything. If I don't trust you enough to tell you everything, how could I ask him to? I think he (Sheriff George Yarnell) has a tremendous amount of information. I don't know what will come of it, but I think the information has to be available to somebody who's trying to make sense of it. The government may know everything anyhow. I don't know. I know they know a whole lot more (than they are te lling). I'm sure they are covering with the helicopters, as I mentioned, because those helicopters that fly around out there are sent deliberately. They behave in a manner that draws suspicion. They land out in fields where they should not be. They are trying, almost, to be the guilty party for the mutilations. And the helicopters are not of sufficient size to lift a 2600-pound bull. They just could not do it. Also, you could hardly carry a bull away in a helicopter in a manner so that it would not be seen. If you remember, the mutilated bull on our property was not ours. It did not belong on either side and nobody in the county reported a missing bull. The law officer said that he would ask around, but we talked to him a few months later and no one had reported a missing bull. It was quite a good one, too. The law officer said they could have picked it up in Idaho; that was his opinion. No one loses a bull they have taken that good a care of without raising Cain. It was an expensive animal. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Barbara: It would have had to come through two fence sections to get there. The bones are still out there from both of them. They were never removed. Jim: There is still the physical evidence, too, of the burned spot on the top of the hill. But it is growing back in. I would not go back there to live because I fear for the family, not for myself. I think it quite likely that something might happen to me. My fear at the ranch is that somebody might get hurt. I understand, as I said, that there have been people who have disappeared. If I had the means, I would have run a full investigation, but I don't have the technical expertise, and I don't think I could run an unbiased investigation. I think I got too emotionally involved to keep a clear perspective. Barbara: I don't think either of us can look at what happened objectively. Jim: I know that there are people who have the means and technical expertise to run the investigation and I was hoping that somebody through this group would be available. That's why I wanted to approach Dr. Hynek. I thought that he might be interested. It's not a one-time shot that can't be followed up. It's going on continuously. Investigator: Yes, it's a problem to conduct an investigation and to do it discreetly and anonymously. Jim: And I'm pretty sure you would run into trouble with the U. S. Air Force if they knew you were doing it. I have no doubts about it. Investigator: Do you have any evidence other than the helicopter flights that the military knows what is going on or has been investigating? Jim: First, I told you I called the military base and they told me to forget it. I first got a radar officer and he was telling me a bout 'unconfirms' on the radar scope. The next thing, I was connected with the colonel who told me to forget it, shut up and mind my own business. The other time we had Air Force planes overflying us at very low altitudes. We went down to the base to complain. At the base, I talked to an officer and he said, 'Well, what do you think the mutilations are?' I took a very neutral position, saying that it was either the government, some wealthy Satanists, or UFOs. He asked which I personally believed and I told him I believed that it was UFOs. He said that they had had their share of trouble with them there at the base, too. They had had directives on how to deal with them. And then he asked me if I had had any trouble with 'Big Foot.' I said that Big Foot had been reported in the county. He said they had directives on Big Foot, too. I said that if he wanted to find them, I could tell him where to go. He said, 'Mister, I don't want to have anything to do with them.' So, obviously, there are some directives at the (U. S. Air Force Fort Carson; Peterson Air Field; and Ent AFB) base near here or I don't think he would give me a line like that. Barbara: Oh, he did ask you one question. He asked you what the most popular opinion in the county was concerning the mutilations and what your personal opinion was. Jim: The most popular opinion is the government. The second is UFOs. They figure the government is doing it in helicopters from the military base. Most of the people are wise enough to realize that a group of Satanists, for example, wouldn't have the money necessary to do what's being done, nor could they escape detection. The other thing that indicates that the Air Force knew was the night the interceptors came in low and I got everyone off the ranch. This was the next night after the two National Guard planes went down. There were two squadrons of attack interceptors circling in that area. I got everybody off the ranch because I knew if the disks"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"showed up, they would come in probably shooting. It is just supposition that UFOs took those planes down, but they had two squadrons up there flying around for something. I was with the Air Defense Command and I know when they bring those kind of planes out, they are nuclear-armed and they don't fly them around for games! I counted 26 aircraft and they were circling the whole horizon. They were surveying everything, supposedly to locate parts of the downed planes. This seemed like a very unlikely thing for high speed interceptors with NORAD markings. [This was essentially the end of the first interview. Extensive, corroborating interviews have been conducted with the husband (John), the son (Joe), the photographer (Roger), the friend (Harry), the \"kooky lady\" (Roberta), the restaurant owner, the law officer, and numerous other citizens of Clearview (not real name of town). The investigation is continuing, in collaboration with the APRO consultant in anthropology, Dr. Peter W. Van Arsdale.]\" Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
