Maccabee - Part 4 © 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe Excerpt from a July 29, 1952 document concerning U.S. Air Force communication of startling facts to the FBI , but not the American people. Document from The UFO/FBI Connection © 2000 by Bruce S. Maccabee. June 21, 2000 Sabillasville, Maryland - Part 4 of the interview with Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph. D., Research Physicist at the Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) in Dahlgren, Virginia begins with green fireballs, the FBI and the Soviet threat. On May 1, 2000, his book The UFO/FBI Connection was released detailing his research since 1976 into FBI documents and knowledge about the UFO mystery. Interview: Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Dahlgren, Virginia: Green Fireballs, the FBI and the Soviet Threat \"A green fireball phenomenon began in December of 1948 which was originally thought to be meteors or flares. METEOROLOGIST DR. LINCOLN LA PAZ WAS STUDYING THEM IN NEW MEXICO. That's right. These were initially reported as green lights that would travel along a horizontal trajectory for a period of several seconds over a distance and then suddenly drop downward and disappear. And La Paz was one of the witnesses and there were dozens of sightings over a couple of months. The FBI got involved with these green fireball sightings because the FBI was responsible for protection of vital installations. 'Vital installations' was a code word for atomic research installations. Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, New Mexico where they designed atomic bombs, Sandia Labs near Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexico where they built the atomic bomb, and then Killeen Base at Fort Hood, Texas where they actually stored atomic bombs. The initial sightings of green fireballs were in the Albuquerque and Los Alamos areas. There were numerous green fireball sightings and the national security agencies were worried. And Dr. Lincoln LaPaz gave them plenty of reason to "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"worry and this turned up in the FBI file. Dr. LaPaz had argue that these things first of all were NOT meteors. As far as he was concerned, there were no meteors that were that vivid grass green color, no meteors that had continuously flat trajectories and no meteors that concentrated on one small area of the earth. Green fireballs were not being seen other than in the southwestern U.S. A. And lots of people saw them. He had triangulated some of these tracks and found that they were traveling like ten miles above the earth at a high speed. His belief was that these were fractional orbital bombs that had been launched in the morning in the Soviet Union when they could do optical tracking. They were coming over the pole from the north and down towards the south, that's where most of the directions were originally. And then decaying when they reached the end of their trajectory. And he argued that Soviet agents on the ground could be feeding back to their people in the Soviet Union where these things were burning out. In other words, ranging on our atomic installations! Well, it wasn't just the security agencies that were handed the problem of what to do about the questions: Is it a real Soviet threat? And what do we do about it in terms of the public opinion? What is the policy on these? The Air Force had continually said that flying saucer sightings are not a threat. And here was something that Lincoln LaPaz was saying: 'This is a threat. It's not ours. This is a threat!' The FBI first heard about this in early 1949 and we know that Hoover was directly aware of these sighting reports of the green fireballs. And Hoover, like everybody else, could read the newspapers and the Air Force would say, 'Well, these were meteors. Nothing to worry about.' But Hoover's people also knew that these security agencies were not quite so blase about it and Lincoln La Paz's opinion turned up in the FBI documents. One of my chapters in my book is called, 'An Unimpeachable Source' and it's a chapter in which I speculate that Walter Winchell (the famous radio commentator) was told by J. Edgar Hoover that these green fireballs were Soviet weapons. The reason I speculate that is on April 4, 1949 Winchell was on the radio and made a statement that the green fireballs were actually missiles from the Soviet Union. I think, basically he said 'flying saucers.' It was a term that encompassed everything at the time. And one of the FBI agents wrote a letter to headquarters asking, 'Shouldn't we interview Walter Winchell to find out where he got this information about flying saucers being Soviet weapons?' Hoover responded that there would be no interview of Walter Winchell. What Walter Winchell has said is substantially what the FBI was told by an Air Force Colonel several months before. So, what J. Edgar Hoover was saying to his FBI agent was that what Walter Winchell said on the radio was basically correct. I suspect that Hoover did not want Walter Winchell to be interviewed because Hoover had been the source of information for Winchell and Hoover did not want his agent to find out that Hoover was breaking security by telling Winchell stuff that the Air Force was keeping TOP SECRET. Hoover probably knew that while the USAF on the one hand publicly dismissed the fireballs, on the other hand it was secretly concerned. And I suspect that Hoover, seeing that the Air Force was not doing anything about it, may have felt that the only way to get some action in regard to these things if they were really Soviet missiles was to put this out in the open where the Senators and Congressmen could start arguing about it. What was the reaction? Immediately after this Walter Winchell statement, the Air Force pooh poohed the whole thing. And nothing was ever done. BUT THERE WAS NEVER ANY EVIDENCE THAT THESE WERE SOVIET MISSILES, WAS THERE?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"No. Nobody to this day, as far as I know, knows what those green fireballs were. Their characteristics changed over a couple of years and then they more or less faded out. But as a result of all those sightings, Project TWINKLE was set up. And I have published in my book, probably for the first time a document that was found in the BLUE BOOK file on a microfilm record relating to a sighting that occurred during the Project TWINKLE time. It was a day time sighting, but not of green fireballs. Objects that were flying and recorded on a theodolite camera at White Sands Missile Test Range in New Mexico unidentified objects were flying at 150,000 foot altitude and were about 30 feet in diameter. We had nothing that could approach that altitude then. Even the high altitude balloons only went up to 100,000 feet. And of course, the balloons did not move fast. The unidentified objects moved very fast. Here is a document which I guess you could say proves that UFOs are real! And yet, Project TWINKLE ignored it. I take special pains to beat on a guy named Louis Elterman who was in atmospheric physics and who wrote the final report for Project TWINKLE. You could argue that he deliberately covered up that information, or he did not know about it. He was a Project Director. He should have known about it, but he did not mention it. The sighting itself is mentioned in Ruppelt, but Ruppelt did not even say they had succeeded with a triangulation to get the height and size. So, anyway that's a document in my new book that proves that UFOs are real. DID THE GREEN FIREBALL PHENOMENON TRIGGER ANY REACTION INSIDE THE CIA? There aren't any documents that indicate that. By the time the CIA got interested again in 1952, the fireballs had sort of faded into history. But I have said that the Air Force told one thing to the American people and some times they told something different to the FBI. And that dichotomous situation is epitomized on July 29, 1952 which is the day that USAF General John A. Samford, the general in charge of Air Force Intelligence, made a public statement at a press conference. Why in the world would he do that? This was a press conference about flying saucers. Why in the world would the Air Force Intelligence General have a press conference about flying saucers? And to understand that, you have to understand that in April 1952 there was the beginning of what was perhaps the biggest UFO flap in the United States that had ever occurred. July 1952, UFOs Fly Over Washington, D. C. It was not only Washington, D. C. I'm talking about every state in the Union. We now know the Air Force collected only a fraction of the sightings. The Air Force only had two dozen sightings from the 1947 flap, but thanks to Project 1947 we now know there were probably 3,000, something like that. During 1952, the Air Force collected several thousand reports in that one year. They believed 1500 and some objects had been sighted, sometimes by more than one person so it made for more than one report. In any event, the bulk of the sightings occurred from April through August 1952 and if you track the sightings per day or per week, you find that they were increasing rapidly in late June and July, peaking in July on the 27th or 28th, I believe, when they had 50 reports in one day. For a period of a month or more, they were getting ten or more reports per day. THOSE FIFTY WERE COMING FROM ONE AREA? Oh, no. These were from all over the place, including from all over the world. Many of them came through official channels such as military reports. DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING DURING THAT TIME?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I can well imagine that the guys at Project BLUE BOOK were wondering whether World War III was going to begin? It really caught the interest of the press when sightings occurred over the Washington, D. C. area on the 19th and 20th of July and again, the following weekend. In each case, three radar sets in the Washington, D. C. area: 1) Andrews AFB, 2) National Airport and 3) Bolling AFB. All three had unexplained targets. Sometimes these targets appeared over the White House, but in restricted areas. And they actually ended up scrambling jets to find out what was going on. Civilian aircraft reported seeing strange lights and occasionally they could see an object in the sky and a radar target in the same direction. There were a number of what appeared to be correlated sightings. One of the most spectacular was when one of these jets that was scrambled came in on the second weekend this happened, July 26-27, and there is a report in the BLUE BOOK file indicating that when the pilot saw the object ahead of him, a light, and on radar they could see the airplane approaching this object. The target on radar started to move at the same speed as the jet and then pulled away. And the jet pilot reported to the radar people that whatever it was, it had a phenomenal acceleration or speed capability. So, they were seeing the same thing, the pilot and radar. This did make it into the news. The Misleading Press Conference of Major General John Samford There were so many sightings that General Samford had been planning to give a briefing to another General on the flying saucer situation. And this briefing paper had already been written. But it turned out that he did not end up briefing that General. He ended up briefing the Washington press corps. On the morning of July 29th, 1952, an announcement went out that General Samford would hold a press conference on the flying saucer situation in the afternoon about 4 o'clock. And the press did show up for that and it was the longest press conference held to that point, 80 minutes. The Korean War, which was still going on after a couple of years, had been wiped off the front page by all the flying saucer sightings. If you were to look up almost any major newspaper in any major city in the U. S. for that time frame, late July 1952, you would be likely to find one or more flying saucer sightings reported in the paper. And of course, everybody reported on General Samford's press conference where he said that the sightings over Washington, D. C. as far as he was concerned were probably caused by temperature inversions that affected the radar and that the sightings that people were reporting, as far as he could tell, were natural phenomena. He said the Air Force had investigated more than a thousand sightings and the one thing that could be said about them was that they posed no threat to the United States. But that is NOT what he had told the FBI. WHICH IS A METAPHOR FOR THE PAST FIFTY YEARS. Yes. On that same day of his press conference, I suspect earlier in the day in late morning or early afternoon, an FBI agent had gone to the headquarters of Air Force intelligence to find out what the heck was going on with all these flying saucers. And the agent spoke to a Navy man, oddly enough, who was apparently on duty for the Air Force intelligence. He was talking to a person who was working for General Samford. Presumably General Samford would be aware of everything this person who worked for him also knew. They were all working in the same office. But what the FBI was told was that they had lots of sightings, most of them could be explained, but 3% of the sightings could NOT be explained. That's not what General Samford told the American people. He said it was all natural phenomenon. But more than that, this Navy man told the FBI that some Air Force officials were seriously considering interplanetary ships. And that is in the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"FBI file. Now, you can imagine if General Samford had said at the press conference, 'Oh, by the way, we are considering interplanetary ships,' that the press conference would have blown up right at that point. There would have been questions like who knew what, when, where, why and all that sort of stuff. But that's not what happened. The press conference and a few other comments from a few other generals in the succeeding days managed to calm everything down. The UFO flap ended. And like what has happened before and so many times since, the press interest faded away and UFOs went back into oblivion.\" Next: FBI, USAF, the CIA and the UFO Cover-Up in Part 5, June 22, 2000.
