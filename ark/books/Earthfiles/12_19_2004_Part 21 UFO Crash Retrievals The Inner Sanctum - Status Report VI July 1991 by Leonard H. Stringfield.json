Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. COMMENTARY: CYNTHIA HIND (continued): \"When I arrived in Johannesburg on the 28th of December, there were no messages waiting for me at my hotel. I phoned Van Greunen and there was no reply. Periodically, throughout the day of the 29th, I continued to call him, but there was never any response. Subsequently, on the 13th of January 1990, Prier Wintle lent me his copy of Van Greunen's NUFORIN magazine in which he had announced that I would be speaking at the Johannesburg Hotel at 8:00 PM on the 29th of December. He had also written, 'The tickets can be obtained from the Conference Director, NUFORIN, P. O. Box 17230, Hillbrow 2038 and are R20 per ticket.' I have since learned from David Powell of Pretoria that about 20 people turned up on the night and were furious at being duped. I have now received a letter from a well-known UFO book seller in the USA, te lling me that Van Greunen had purchased about U. S. $540 worth of books from him. He had paid by check but the check had been returned marked, 'Account Closed.' The case sounds rather like a Steven Spielberg scenario to me, not because I don't believe it possible, but because of many disconcerting factors. a) I obtained some documents from a highly respected investigator and I am surprised that a top-secret document in the SAAF (South African Air Force) would be in English and not in Afrikaans, the language of the government. b) A list of 'hieroglyphics' allegedly found inside the craft were amateurishly drawn and the spelling errors unforgivable. The SAAF would never pass anything like this; they are an intelligent and well-educated force. The list is signed by none other than J. Van Greunen, although in this instance, he has suddenly become Captain James Van Greunen, South African Air Force Intelligence. Spelling errors are rampant: 'iniahalation,' 'dissapation,' 'dessert,' 'populace,' 'eminating,' etc. c) The document tells of Squadron Leader - who was in one of the Mirages. There is no such rank in the SAAF. Squadron Leaders are in the Royal Air Force. A call from the United States did alert me to something positive in this report. A New York MUFON member told me that there had been a report from a man in Bulawayo,m Zimbabwe about a light coming down on the Botswana, South African border on the 7th of May 1989. I have managed to contact the person concerned, who is with the Met Office in Zimbabwe and reports to the Smithsonian Institute in Washington. I have been in contact with him and he is almost certain that what he "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"saw on that night was a 'fireball,' but he has to check out his records first and I am awaiting his confirmation of the sighting and what exactly it was. In conclusion, I can only say that in my opinion, the story is one big 'con.' It is either disinformation deliberately set out or Van Greunen has personal dreams of grandeur and, most likely, made the whole thing up.\" Len Stringfield continues. 6) THE 'HENRY' AZADEHDEL/VICTORIAN REPORT Henry (the simplest among his other names) has emerged into a high-profile researcher internationally using both phone and fax to communicate. Henry is not shy or soft-spoken and to some newcomers on the receiving end of his phone call, his bluntness might paint him as the 'tough cop' type. Well, that type would have pleased Dr. Allen Hynek, astronomer. I remember Alan telling me that what we need in research is 'more of the tough cop types - the kind that gets to the bare facts, the truth or else, from UFO witnesses.' But, Henry is not a tough cop. When you get to know him, he can be soft-spoken, diplomatic and reasonable. If anybody knows the whole story on the South African affair, it's Henry. On my request, he sent me a statement with attachments dated June 10, 1991, covering his actions in the case. Maybe the case, despite Van Greunen, is not closed yet. Henry Azadehdel, June 10, 1991: \"A report relating to the UFO crash in South Africa on May 7, 1989, has been the subject of a great deal of controversy since its publication in an article written by Mr. Tony Dodd, the Director of Investigation of Quest International. Mr. Dodd's report at that time in many ways raised a great number of questions, basically due to the nature of sophisticated technology involved in this particular retrieval. In this report, I would explain, in brief, what actually took place. We are fully aware that every report relating to such an incident would always create confusion, disbelief, and that the reporters who try to relate the case, would always be subjected to various types of allegations or character assassination from the quarters, which are either over eager to have a participating role, or others who have none or little knowledge about the military and intelligence structure, method and policy designed and designated to tackle incidents such as a UFO crash/retrieval. I became involved in the South African UFO crash case after Mr. Tony Dodd sent me a complete report of what he was sent from South Africa in 1989. Later on, a Mr. Van Greunen came to England with his family and stayed at my place for almost two weeks. During the course of these two weeks, a great deal more information which was given to us by him was scrutinized. Mr. James Hendrik Van Greunen's role in this incident roused our suspicion from the very beginning. There were simply several areas that we had discovered independently, which were not agreeable with what he was telling us. Eventually, I decided that I had tolerated him long enough and had to ask him to leave. In the course of our own independent investigation, we discovered Mr. Henry J. Greef. I personally talked to him several times. He gave me some information which was totally new to the case, as well as leads that could be followed. Greef explained some of the black and white photographs taken from the site of the incident and promised to re-photograph or copy and send them to us. From the very first telephone conversation with him, he made references to the files he was handling on the case as well as a firsthand, rather high-ranking individual, as source of his information. At the time, when all this was happening, another investigation was progressing. I had started my own inquiries through Wright-Patterson, with various offices and through my own contacts. The flight dates and times of the two Galaxy C-5s which were the carriers were confirmed. Also, I managed to talk to an individual who had been sent to South Africa as part of a team after the Quick Reaction Teams (QRT) were dispatched. He was totally shocked and surprised. In fact, he was more eager to learn from me about what I knew than answering my questions. The UFO was brought down by an experimental NDEW. The existence of such weapon is no longer the question as explained before. In my last conversation with J. Miller at Kirtland about NDEW's, he confirmed their existence. Today, records and information on Gypsy is in my possession and confirms such ongoing programs and projects. Greef was a credible source for further information. Also, having obtained the telephone number of the Chief of Military Intelligence in South Africa through our sources, my telephone conversation with him reconfirmed the validity of the case. In many ways, it was somewhat amusing. He was totally confused and shaken from my"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"unexpected and untimely telephone call, especially that I had managed to get through to him through his direct line by-passing his administrative shield. He asked me: why do I want to know about it, what do I want to know about it? He pressed hard to learn how I came by the information. It was a desperate attempt to protect the secrecy, to re-compose himself, and at the same time, try to find immediate answers to my questions. His performance was a failure. He could not answer my questions. Instead, without any pause or thought, hastily answered them with questions which in fact gave me more information that I was expecting. A few weeks later, I was approached by another higher ranking officer of the South African military intelligence who I will call JB. He stayed with me for three days. The information he gave us cleared a great deal of grey areas. We now had a clearer picture of what had happened. After his departure to one of a previous French colony, I received other documents not from South Africa, but from Europe, which in fact endorsed the case. There was never a PAINT used in order to demagnetize or disarm the UFOs EM (electromagnetic) emission. Instead, an electronic barrier was used. The crash of the helicopter reported was verified. But the reason was not clarified as to whether it was the UFO's EM emission or pilot's error or mechanical fault. Mechanical means were used to open up the entrance, but no entities had crawled out. No South African civilian scientist had been given the permission or clearance to enter into the saucer. The Quick Reaction Teams had arrived there within a matter of a few hours since the UFO had also been tracked by NORAD. On this, I have an independent telephone conversation with NORAD. My conversation with them in itself is interesting in a sense that the person that I had talked to for a half an hour earlier, suddenly on a follow-up call in order to clarify some hitches, was not there and apparently had been on a holiday for a few days. The evidence which we gathered from independent military sources in U. S. and in South Africa, especially my own taped conversations with them, confirm the incident. None of the South African military personnel were allowed to participate in any detailed examination of the craft. A handful were escorted each time individually by members of QRT to see the inside of the craft. Certain agreements were made between the governments of the U. S. and South Africa before the saucer was flown out to WP/AFB. No cash exchange between the two countries was made. The report issued by the U. S. Space Command on our request about the possibility of a re-entry was also contradictory from that of Naval Space Surveillance Center's. U. S. Space Command gives the impact location as: Lat. - 18.0 degrees (S), and Long. -41.1 degrees (E). Rev. number 181, descending to southwest. Whilst Naval Space Surveillance Center mentions the impact location Lat. -46.6 degrees North. Long. 15.4 degrees East, and Rev. number 94. There is also differences in impact time. USSPACOM 0119Z. NAVSPASUR 1101Z. In their reply dating December 13, 1989, AF Space Command says that our request could not be granted because it falls within NORAD's jurisdiction. Yet, in another letter, dating December 11, 1989, U. S. Space Command and yet another office has given us the details of a Russian rocket body which made re-entry, but its point of impact is miles away from the actual UFO incident. In brief, for odd reasons, AF Space Command either deliberately or unknowingly are creating a confusion. Bearing in mind that last year, NORAD did release some records on UFOs to Robert Todd. I pursued the matter and upon Appeal more data was disclosed. (See; Just Cause, Number 24, June 1990.) The most important information released to us came from the member of the South African Military Intelligence. For obvious reasons, I am not at liberty to mention his name. I am sure those researchers who have been doing similar work would support the reasons. he explained what had happened in brief. Presumably, Greef passed some of this information together with details of the format of the documents to Van Greunen. The five-page documents, represent most of the information correctly. On the U. S. side, OSI had been involved as well as QRT, FTD, Logistic Command section of WP/AFB which supplied the logistics, as well as the Tactical Wing Command in WP/AFB. In the course of several conversations with a source in the logistic section of the WP/AFB, it has now been established the type of logistical material supplied for the operation. At no time were the entities medically examined by South African military MDs, nor was there any aggression from their (entities') side. Quite the opposite, the entities seemed to be timid, confused or frightened. The description of the entities are correct as given in the 5-page documents. The Grey type. Experimental Weapons Attack on UFO?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" The other significant point to be made is that it has not been established (to us) whether the use of an experimental weapon alone was the cause to bring the craft down. The craft, after receiving the first round of attack, did not react in any fashion to defend itself. It is presumed that it was already experiencing some difficulties and that the attack expedited its downing. The pilot who carried out the initial attack has told us that he used the weapon only once. In my last telephone conversation with Greef, he was clearly worried. He was trying to be polite on one hand; on the other to protect his skin. I had noticed some sharp alteration in his attitude in volunteering information. He now was trying to distance himself, whilst being an intelligent individual, as he was, and knew only too well that too much had already been spilled. One of my contacts told me that he no longer lives there. Usually his sister answered the phone and then passed the receiver to Henry Greef. But the voice was that of a male which I could not identify. But, in my very last conversation with Greef, he was clearly shaken and frightened. He tried to play the entire case down and said that he had nothing to do with it, that I should not trust Van Greunen. Taking the situation into consideration, I could understand the reasons behind it. Van Greunen had betrayed him. This report on the South African UFO crash is what so far we have been able to unravel. There are still various areas that we simply cannot make public for obvious reasons. As far as we are concerned, the work on the case has not been completed yet. I submit this report on the merit of a researcher. It is up to the individuals to draw their own conclusion on the case. On the final note, what adds to the complexity of the case is a sighting of a fireball in Zimbabwe on May 7, 1989, 2145 GMT, plus the re-entry of the FOTON 2 Rocket. Once more, it demonstrates the maze UFOlogists find themselves in when they try to make some sense out of a case.\" Correspondence by \"Henry Azadehdel,\" also known as \"Armen Victorian\": Above: July 1991 fax from Armen Victorian, England, to Len Stringfield, Cincinnati, Ohio, with below: attached Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) reply from NASA."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Above: December 11, 1989 letter from United States Space Command, Peterson AFB, Colorado, to \"Dr. Henry Azadehdel,\" Nottingham, England.
