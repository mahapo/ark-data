Same way. But after it landed, I was walking around looking at it thinking, ‘Oh, great, wh a if this is not Zo.’ I got worried that it might be somebody else inside who wouldn’t care about me. Zo told me there were visitors who were not friendly to humans on this world. So, I took off running and I heard in my mind, ‘Stop! This is Zo!’ I turned around thinking it was a trick, but it was him. My heart was racing! I didn’t want to be caught up in the field of that craft because it would hurt. I did not know how badly i would hurt, but I had a good idea from what happened to my dog. The dog was really kin d of whacked. I heard in my mind, ‘William, stop! This is Zo!’ I was concerned and my heart was racing turned around to look, st ill ready to bolt, and it l ooked like him. So, I started walking bac k towards that direction. He walked towards me and it was Zo. I asked him, ‘What is this craft?’ He said, ‘This is just another one of our ships.’ He walked up and put his hand on the side The craft opened and we went inside. This time there was a passage way to the right. Thi s was larger than a 30-foot-diameter ship. This craft was probably at least 50 feet in diameter."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"There was an opening and it went into this room and the room was circular. It was almost like walking into a sunken living room because you walked in and you took a step down and you sat down. Your feet were on the floor and there in front of your feet - probably two feet in front of your knees - was this big, black cube. This was just a matte black, lik e cube box painted flat black paint. W illiam's illustration of the black cube image projector surrounded by cushioned seating so close that the cube was only two feet from his knees. “The room was dimly lit, like a theater. The cube (about 4 feet by 4 feet by 4 feet) was matte black at first. Zo had a device in his left hand. When he touched this control, the cube seemed (to go) transparent with (3-D) images inside.” 1969 when W illiam was sixteen."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Zo walked in and I walked in behind him. He asked me to step in there and sit down because he had something to show me. He sat down to my left. He had something in his l e hand and with his thumb, he was pushing some buttons. The room went darker and witho u any sound, as the room became darker, the cube became more glossy and then I could se e dim images inside of it. It was as though I were seeing small lights inside this cube, which became like looking at stars in a planetarium, for example. HOW BIG WAS THE CUBE? I would say it was 4 feet by 4 feet. He was showing me the Milky Way galaxy because it zoomed out from Earth to show the Milky Way galaxy. It showed where we were on Eart in the Milky Way galaxy and then zoomed in and showed different stars and they were different colors. They were yellow and red and blue and green and some were like a blac k light color. A scorpion under a black light. In normal lighting this scorpion appears black. Black lights are often used to find scorpions in the wilderness. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Black light is the common name for a lamp emitting electromagnetic radiation that is almost exclusively in the soft near ultraviolet range, without much visible light. Sometimes, this type of lighting is more commonly referred to as UV light.”] Inside the black cube where the different colored stars were projected holographically, Z o was pointing out different stars, ‘These are places where there are people.’ And he showe me where he is from and where other beings are from. YOU UNDERSTOOD ZO WAS FROM WHERE? I understood that he is from a planet orbiting a star called Tau Ceti. WHICH IS ABOUT 12 LIGHT-YEARS FROM THE EARTH."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I llustration of our sun with dark sunspots on left is both larger and somewhat hotter than the less active Tau Ceti about 12 light-years from Earth (right). Illustration © 2007 by R. J. Hall. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Tau Ceti is a star in the constellation Cetus that is similar to the Sun in mass and spectral type. At just under 12 light years' distance from the Solar System, it is a relatively close star. Tau Ceti is metal- deficient and therefore, thought to be less likely to have rocky planets. Observations have detected more than ten times as much dust surrounding Tau Ceti as is present in our Solar System. Tau Ceti appears stable, with little stellar variation. It can be seen with the unaided eye as a faint third-magnitude star. As seen from Tau Ceti, our Sun would be a 3rd-magnitude star in the constellation Boötes.” ] P ortion of modern star map of our local Milky Way galaxy neighborhood that contains more than a dozen similar Spectral Class G suns, which could support life. Our Sun (Sol) is at the edge of the group, which includes Tau Ceti and other suns such as 82 Eridani, Gliese 86 and Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2, binary yellow suns. Reproduction from scanned image by Jeffrey Pratt. OK. Around this star, Tau Ceti, there were several planets and one of the planets was like Earth. IS EVERYTHING YOU ARE SEEING INSIDE THE CUBE? WHERE IS ALL THIS OCCURING?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Inside the cube. The cube has become very transparent at this point. You can look inside o it, kind of like looking at a TV. In one instance, I got up and moved around and that changed the perspective of my view, so it was like it was all being generated holographically in three dimensions within the cube. DID HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF TAU CETI TO THE EARTH? What Zo told me was that people here on Earth did not originate here on Earth. They originated out there some place. Humankind had spread itself across this part of the universe and at some point in past time, something occurred and the humans kind of got separated. They lost the ability to stay c onnected. DID HE EXPLAIN WHAT THAT LOSS WAS? He said there was some pretty violent conflicts that took place because as these different worlds matured, they started to develop their own idea of what was right and wrong, how things should be done and so forth. There was like a central governing agency that was overseeing all these planets and there was kind of a civil war. So, this was the cube and it was many years later (1969 to 1998, twenty-nine years) that I would see something similar in Peru. It was a location near Lake Titicaca at 13,000 feet above sea level in a strange outcropping of rock that the locals have called the “Doorway of Aramu Muru.” L ake Titicaca is a lake located on the border of Bolivia and Peru. It sits 3,812 meters (12,507 feet) above sea level making it the highest commercially navigable lake in the world. By volume of water it is also the largest lake in South America with a maximum depth of 932 feet."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" L ake Titicaca, Peru, with snow-covered Andes Mountains in background, as seen from Bolivian homes © 2007 by Vico Ricab. Doorway of Aramu Muru, or “Place of the Gods,” is at Lake Titicaca, Peru, near the Bolivian border. Local Peruvians revere the site and say it is where life was first created on Earth. The carved doorway is said to lead to another dimension. Locals claim some people have disappeared and reappeared near the door. Many are afraid to approach the door. Some have noted strange, tall men accompanied by glowing balls of lights walk through the doorway. Image by W illiam. I had been told by an old shaman, Pedro, that this was a passageway between worlds. I w a vastly fascinated by it because of the other experiences I've had in my life. So, here we a r thirty years later at Lake Titicaca in Peru. It was November 11, 1998, and at 11 o'clock i n the evening. Kathy, my wife, and a few folks who were with me and we all went to the doorway. I use the techniques that Pedro had provided to me and managed to open this doorway and go inside for a brief time. Kathy was watching and the others were watching. They said I shimmered and glowed a n then I was gone. There was no physical opening of the door or anything like that. It's just that I glowed for a moment and I was gone. What I saw was as if I were moving very, very rapidly through the universe. I was movin g"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"at an incredible speed. There was a strange hissing sound that was associated with it as well. Once it was finished, I was in this white room. And in this white room when I finally got my wits about myself, I turned and saw that there was a very large, black mass floating i n front of me. This black mass had all these stars - these points of light. THIS IS SUSPENDED IN THE AIR IN FRONT OF YOU AND NOT IN A CUBE LIKE IN 1969 WITH ZO IN THE CRAFT? There in front of me was this large, gelatinous-looking mass that was just floating in the a i It was different than what I had seen inside of the craft with Zo. What I saw here in the white room was not a 4-foot-square black object with a holographic display. Instead, it w a something that might have been as large as a football field - large, undulating, black and inside of it were pinpoints of light. There were large and small lights. There were wisps o f light. There was a presence there and I never saw who this was. But in a short amount of time, the male voice explained to me that what I was looking at was an experiment that they h a conducted in order to understand their place in the universe and this experiment was thei r attempt to create a small universe to observe. And somehow - and I was not sure and am still not sure - somehow I had emerged from that large, black mass, according to them. Once that explanation was finished, they insisted I needed to go back. I immediately fou n myself drawn back into this large, black mass traveling back through space again and ending up back at the Doorway of Aramu Muru. OK, WHAT YOU ARE IMPLYING IS THAT YOU WENT THROUGH A DOORWAY I N PERU AND YOU WENT INTO ANOTHER DIMENSION, ANOTHER LARGER BOX OF CONSCIOUSNESS AROUND THIS WHOLE UNIVERSE? Yeah, that's the implication. I mean, it sounds just crazy, but when I was there in the whit e room, they explained to me that they had tried to understand where they are in the sche m of things. They were trying to understand the nature of their universe. In doing so, they h a created this whatever it was, wherever I was at, and they created the environment that would replicate their concept of what the universe was like. It was being held floating in the air and what they were surprised to discover is that as they watched it and it was progressing, small reactions were taking place inside that they eventually discovered wer e the makings of stars inside of this mass. They then went into the mass in order to understand what they were seeing. How they went into it was not made clear to me. But they came to the conclusion that they created this small model of the universe, small to them, but to us quite vast. They placed these doorways indifferent places around this universe in order to travel to different places. THE UNIVERSE THAT WE ARE IN ON THEIR SCALE WAS THIS FLOATING GELATINOUS MASS INSIDE OF A ROOM THAT THEY WERE STUDYING. Right. As I got closer and closer to this large black mass, it was obvious to me that it was really quite large - perhaps the size of a football field, hanging there floating in the air. Th a was very disorienting. I asked, ‘Where am I?’ It didn't really give me a clear answer abou t where I was. WAS IT TELEPATHIC IN YOUR MIND OR VERBAL? It sounded verbal to me, but I never saw the person. I only heard their voice. It was a ma n voice."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"And past a certain point, I couldn't tell how long I'd been away. That's when I really start e becoming concerned because this fellow was saying that the ‘universe’ I was looking at was for them created a short time ago, but for us it was billions of years. The time inside the mass is much different than time outside and that's when I started thinking about time and wondering what I was going to do because I didn't know what to do! Kathy was waiting for me, as were these other people and I had lost track of time. I knew that Kathy would be really worried. We had been married for only three or four months. I was gettin g frantic! It's one of those heart-racing moments where you just don't have any idea at all what direction to turn, what to think, what to do or even how you got to where you are. SO, WHAT HAPPENED? Well, they told me I had to go back, that there were others like myself who had managed t get through the doorway and had ended up there (in the white room) and they would hel p me to go back. They told me to just walk towards it and then the next thing I know, it's li k I'm floating and I closed my eyes because I was going quite rapidly and this hissing noise occurred and again, I was flying through space. They told me to stay focused on where I wanted to go. So, I was focusing on Kathy. And as I'm flying through this panorama, it was not like there were stars everywhere, but there were lights and tremendous noise in my ears - it was like a dozen tires all releasing a at the same time out of the valve stems. I eventually noticed there was one point of light that I was headed for that eventually turned out to be our sun and I saw the Earth and I was just going incredibly fast falling ri g towards the Earth. So, I closed my eyes, tensed up, and the next thing I knew the hissing had stopped and I'm sitting inside of this rock chamber looking out of the doorway out at Kathy and the others and Lake Titicaca in the distance. From their time frame, I was gon e maybe a minute. For me, I was gone quite a long time.” ontinued in Part 5 More Information: For further information about the human abduction syndrome, please see my books and docum e in the Earthfiles Shop and in the Earthfiles Archive: • 06/15/2008 — Part 3: Insights from An Experiencer with Greys and Blond Humanoids • 06/13/2008 — Part 2: Insights from An Experiencer with Greys and Blond Humanoids • 05/20/2008 — High Strangeness in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada • 04/29/2008 — Part 1: Insights from An Experiencer with Greys and Blond Humanoids • 04/06/2008 — Final Part 10: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 04/02/2008 — Part 9 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/30/2008 — Part 8 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/20/2008 — Part 7 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/15/2008 — Part 6 - Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/08/2008 — Part 5: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/04/2008 — Part 4: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/03/2008 — Updated Part 1: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/02/2008 — Part 2: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 03/02/2008 — Part 3: Real X-File, Source Unknown • 02/22/2008 — Updated: Three Eyewitnesses in Selden, Texas, Saw Two, Large Rectangles of “White Flames” in Sky • 02/14/2008 — Update: Mysterious Symbols Projected in Night Sky by Aerial Disc Near Stephenv ille, Tex a Local Airport • 02/08/2008 — Law Officers Describe Unidentified Shape-Shifting Aerial Craft in Stephenv ille, Texas, Region • 01/28/2008 — Updated 01-28-08: Viewer Letters About Aerial Craft and Military Flyovers Above Dubli n Stephenville and Selden, Texas • 01/18/2008 — Updated: Huge Aerial Craft Over Dublin, Texas, “Longer Than 3 Football Fields” • 01/07/2008 — Part 15: In League With A UFO • 12/22/2007 — Part 10: In League With A UFO • 12/16/2007 — Part 8: In League With A UFO • 12/14/2007 — Part 7: In League With A UFO • 12/11/2007 — More Confirmation of May 1974 Discs in Albuquerque and Huge Cylinder Craft At White"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Sands Proving Ground. • 11/25/2007 — Part 4: In League With A UFO • 09/16/2007 — Part 5: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/11/2007 — Part 4: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/07/2007 — Part 3: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 09/05/2007 — Part 2: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 08/31/2007 — Part 1: Betty and Barney H ill: Captured! • 08/31/2007 — Part 2: Betty and Barney H ill: Captured! • 08/30/2007 — Part 1: M ilitary Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs • 07/31/2007 — Part 2, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards • 06/26/2007 — Part 1: Explanation of the Recent \"Strange Craft\" Sightings • 05/11/2007 — CIA Origin of National Enquirer? • 03/16/2007 — Tenth Anniversary of March 1997 Phoenix Lights: What Was the 2-Mile-Long Triangular Craft? • 02/18/2007 — Part 4: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 02/15/2007 — Grey Non-Human Floats in Air At New Orleans Defense Contractor Site • 02/14/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 02/12/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 02/11/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners • 01/26/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/26/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/26/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans • 01/08/2007 — Updated: Attorney Describes His Encounter with Non-Human Entities • 12/14/2006 — Abductee Jim Sparks's Encounter with Rept illian Beings, Their Warning and Possible Age n • 10/11/2006 — Part 2: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee • 10/08/2006 — Part 1: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee • 09/29/2006 — Manipulation of Time and Matter by Non-Humans: The Experiences of Jim Sparks • 09/05/2006 — Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - M ilitary Visitor to Another Planet? • 09/04/2006 — Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - M ilitary Visitor to Another Planet? • 07/28/2006 — 1940s USAF Flight Surgeon's Account of E.
