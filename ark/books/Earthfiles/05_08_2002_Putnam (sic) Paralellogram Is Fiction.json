The website listed with the internet article is http://www.yawp.com/3rd-i/current/pp/putnam.html. That website belongs to a loose group of people scattered between Iowa City and Charlottesville, Virginia who like to write fiction and pass it off as non-fiction. One of those people is Vernon Trollinger of Iowa City, Iowa where in August 1996, Vernon Trollinger and Todd Ristau wrote \"The Putnam Paralellogram\" fiction for their Volume 3, Issue 8 monthly magazine called Third Eye Over Iowa that carried these cautionary words on its cover: Believe At Your Own Risk . Trollinger told me that \"Dr. Leonid Rosenweitz\" is actually Todd Ristau whose main passion is dramatic theater productions for the No Shame Theater now in Charlottesville, Virginia. In fact, the only photograph in the \"Putnam Paralellogram\" article of an alleged Dr. K. M. Schaefer is Todd Ristau who photographed himself in a photo booth at the Deadwood Bar in Iowa City in 1996. Trollinger also told me that the idea for the Putnam Parallelogram story started with the Iowa State Historical Society Archives book entitled, \"Index to Abandoned Towns of Iowa\" by David Mott. But the town of Putnam in rural Fayette County where the 1945 Putnam Parallelogram mystery was supposed to have begun is not even listed in the Index. If there ever was a Putnam, Iowa, it's no longer listed in any of three Atlases I checked and the phone information operator says there is no Putnam in the state of Iowa.
