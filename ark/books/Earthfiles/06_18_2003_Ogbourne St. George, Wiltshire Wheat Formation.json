June 18, 2003 Ogbourne St. George, Wiltshire, England - Ye s t e r d a y afternoon, British crop formation researcher and author Lucy Pringle, called me right after she and a friend had walked through the new Ogbourne St. George, Wiltshire crop formation. The 37-circle pattern was discovered Sunday, June 15, in young wheat in the natural bowl below the Ridgeway as shown in the upper photograph. Essentially, the location is isolated and well hidden if you are on the ground. The nearest house is the farmer's two miles away. In addition to looking for physical signs of human footprints, stomper boards, poles or damage on the crop and not finding any, Lucy also buried twenty "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"bottles of water for scientific study of changes in water frequencies after a week's exposure underground in the crop formation soil.

Interview: Lucy Pringle, Crop Formation Researcher and Author, Petersfield, Hampshire, England: \" I have to say, Linda, this is the first formation that I'm really excited about this year for a number of reasons. It's so beautiful it sort of gives one a kick, you know? It's fantastic and your heart sort of swells. And you see the surrounding countryside and it just fits in so perfectly as though it's a palette and some wonderful artist has been out there and picked the right spot to do a painting. WAS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS FORMATION THAT REMINDED YOU OF PAST FORMATIONS? Yes, there was one a couple three years ago that was remotely similar at Beckhampton, in young green, barley. But nothing of the intricacies of this one and not of this size. I took a friend with me named Christopher Weeks. He is keenly observant. If anything is manmade, Christopher is going to find it out if anybody can. One of the impressive things is the formation's total inaccessibility. It is miles away from anything, from roads, tracks, anything. It's in a bowl in a big field just below the Ridgeway and there just are no tracks or roads leading to it. In fact, the farmer very kindly took us in his Land Rover because we could only get in so far, and he took us in the remainder of the way. Even the Land Rover was bouncing around roughly. He is not a happy farmer. He doesn't want people going into it and this I do have to stress. The farmer thinks it's done by vandals and went on about his work. But we walked in and examined very closely the crop which is almost standing upright again. It's in young wheat and the formation was very lightly imprinted. I think one of the things you can find, if a plank or bamboo poles had been used, is where they step forward, there is the weight of a man's foot. You get crushed stalks and you certainly in green wheat or green barley you get that grey film, which is part of the growing part of the plant. You get that wiped off (from implements) and that can never be replaced. So, this is something you look for. No Evidence of Tracks, Boards, Poles We couldn't find a single stalk that was crushed or where the grey film had been removed. And if people had used a stomping board, they very often do it at an angle. If you feel one crushed stalk, you can go along at an angle. You then take another man-sized step and you will find exactly the same thing, a systematic thing. Very often, you can't see it visibly. It's only by running your finger along the stems that you find it crushed and then you run your finger in a diagonal manner and you find all the other stalks crushed in this diagonal manner. Then"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"you take another man's step forward and you'll find exactly the same evidence. NONE OF THAT IS IN THE OGBOURNE ST. GEORGE FORMATION? Absolutely, none whatsoever. And it's huge. It straddles more than eight tramlines. The spaces in between the tramlines are 60 feet, and each tramline is 6 feet itself, so you're getting close to 600 feet diameter. Another thing, Linda, when you go into a formation is that the perimeter where you get the cut off point between the standing crop and the falling crop if someone is using a plank or a board or canes or whatever, you get a chaffing or a bruising along the first line, the first row of the standing crop. This is visible in young crop and in canola because canola bruises and in the young crop you have the grey film. But this one (at Ogbourne St. George) was absolutely perfect! I asked Christopher if he had an explanation and he said, 'I haven't. I'm mystified.' Lucy's Scientific Research So we buried my (water) bottles and we go back in a week's time to collect them. COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU DO WITH THE BURIED BOTTLES OF WAT E R ? They are tested. I bury control samples outside the formations and this is vital because when you test the ones inside, they have to be compared with the control tests outside. Over the years, they have been tested by a number of scientists by Dr. Farrell Smith. He tested them for resonances and he found a completely different pattern of resonances in the ones buried inside the formation as opposed to the controls samples. Dr. Beniste, who is very well known with his hypothesis of water having a memory, he tested them for me and he was so amazed by the results he couldn't believe it. So, he had to retest them. He found exactly the same results. We also tested the bottled water for nitrates. This is interesting because no molecule of nitrate can actually enter the glass bottles. This is what Jim Lyons is always talking about that we are dealing with frequencies and a residual frequencies after the (circle-making) force has hit. Those frequencies are in the seeds and in the plants and in the soils. When a bottle is buried, it is in contact with the residual frequencies from the original hit, if you like, so it is the frequencies that have penetrated the bottles and the water inside. AND CAN BE MEASURED IN THAT WATER? Yes. I am working now with a Dutch doctor and he particularly wants samples to test for homeopathic qualities. Today I buried two bottles in each place, so I think we buried 20 bottles (in Ogbourne St. George.) WHAT WAS THE WEATHER LIKE ON THE NIGHT BEFORE THIS WAS FOUND ON JUNE 15? It appeared on Saturday night (June 14, 2003) and it was a fine night, no weather. SINCE IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT, WAS ANYONE OUT AND NOTICE ANYTHING UNUSUAL, SOUNDS, LIGHTS OR ANYTHING? No, it's so isolated. You just wouldn't. There is nobody around to see it. The farmer himself is about 2 miles from the formation. I am also excited that I collected seeds from the center, from the perimeter and from control areas outside and those are going to go off to Jim Lyons with whom"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I do a lot of work. He's an academic at York University. We're going to test those for using the infrared technique to test the protein and moisture content, which we did for the first time last year in the wonderful formation at Alton Barnes, the Celtic Knot in 2002. That was the most magical one last year. I have been in so many circles over the year, but I find one or two each year that really give me a sense of wonder and awe and something I cannot explain. They are totally different from anything else. Physical Effects Inside Formation ANY SWOLLEN OR BURST NODES, ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THE PLANTS? No, and I looked for that, but I think you're going to find that more often in mature crop than in green crop. But the crop had risen up so far. I'll tell you one thing, both Christopher and I were starting to feel very ill. It was accumulative. Sometimes you get a whammy of energy when you go in. And Christopher was standing there looking quite dazed and said, 'We'll do this last bottle and then we'll get out. I can't think. I'm really feeling very strange. I'm totally disoriented. My thought processes aren't working. I've got to go!'\" We b s it e : http://home.clara.net/lucypringle Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
