Scott Frank I n the eastern city limits of Tucson, Arizona, is Davis Monthan AFB. Southeast is Fort Huachuca, long associated with underground facilities linked to monitoring, or interacting with, a non-human intelligence. June 14, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Recently I met an Albuquerque resident who has had high strangeness in his life since childhood. Now in his mid-fifties, W. Scott Frank is trying to make some sense of his odd experiences by writing them out for a book manuscript he hopes to publish one day. An especially haunting event that involved another intelligence's mind manipulati on, mimicry and illusions occurred at the end of 1976 in Tucson, Arizona, when Scott was in his mid-twenties. Scott Frank gave me permission to reprint \"By the Curve of the Tracks\" as an Earthfiles Real X-File. By the Curve of the Tracks © 2007 by W. Scott Frank ince I now had a few bucks, I moved down to The Shanty, a slightly classier Fourth Avenue bar - you'd even see a tie in there. College kids and young professionals mixed with temporarily flush street people, all treading a piped-in mush of homogenized jazz. The music often drove me away, though "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"people sometimes shared their pitchers with me, so I'd put up with it. I found it odd they knew my name. I vaguely recalled making their recent acquaintance, but they seemed okay and I accepted an invitation to help down their pitcher. No sooner had I taken a couple sips of beer when the guy suggested we go for an evening drive and smoke a joint. He was rather tall, white,with longish dark blond hair and beard. His girlfriend's pale, round face fit under a thick, black pageboy/soup bowl haircut. She had a turned-up, puggish nose and high cheekbones and her hair poured out of a spot in the middle of her scalp. Here eyes were so dark they were virtually black. Here cheeks were so puffy that her eyes were deep set; they were almond-shaped. I quickly forgot their names, but drinking and smoking with strangers was pretty common behavior for the time. As we stood to leave, we were joined by a fourth person, a short and stocky, dark, hairy, bearded guy in an off-the-rack sports shirt. His sleeves came clownishly down to his elbows. He hardly spoke a word throughout the evening and seemed almost in a trance; he'd grunt when they'd address him and they called him \"Tom.\" To my consternation, we left most of the pitcher there; the bearded guy discouraged any more drinking. Hopping in a 4-door gas guzzler, we drove west, stopping to light up in a dark, isolated spot by some railroad tracks. A dusty old lamp glowed softly from a small twisted phone pole, but the light did not reach us. I sat in the right rear. Soon we were puffing up a storm. Out my side, I noticed a bright light coming down the far bend of the tracks. \"Is that a car or a train?\" I wondered aloud. It was following the dirt frontage road along our side of the tracks. The others offered their guesses as the light gradually, noiselessly approached. I rolled down my window to dispel pot fumes, suggesting the others do the same in case it was a sheriff's car. They did and smoke billowed out. \"Don't worry,\" I assured them. \"If it's a deputy, we can g rid of it in time.\" I was pretty brazen and didn't care if a cop smelled weed as long as he didn't find any on us. As the light followed the tracks at ground level, we continued to guess at its nature - car or train? It was the yellowish color of electric light, but difficult to distinguish whether it was a pair of lights or just one. It moved slowly when I watched, but when I turned away and looked again, it consistently seemed to have advanced improportionately closer than it should have. Once, when I suddenly snapped my head over to look, I saw it quickly slow down. One of the group said, \"Oops, he tricked it!\" Suddenly I was hit with a head pain so severe that I might have fallen had I not been sitting. Every filling in my teeth felt like a thr obbing spike in my skull. \"Oh, my fucking head!\" I moaned. \"Where'd this headache come from?\" I laid my head in my arms on the seat in front of me. \"I don't see why you're getting a headache.\" I heard the woman mutter. She acted as if I was misbehaving. Looking through my folded arms and down at my feet, I was surprised to see them illuminated by bright, yellow light. U pon raising my head, I saw the whole interior of the car was lit brightly yellow, every corner, each person, with no shadows. I was trying to verbalize a question when someone blurted out, \"Here they come!\" and I turned to my right. Outside, a few feet away from my door, stood an exceedingly intense light, a diamond-like oval on its side, the width of a wide car. Three feet high in the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"middle, it tapered to a rounded six inches on each end and was painfully rich and bright. It was predominantly white, but had electric yellows, with brief suggestions of blues and reds weaving through. Pain forced me to turn away. A strong impression materialized from somewhere that \"they\" wanted us out of the car. I remember stumbling to a standing position outside, clumsily producing my ID for an outstretched hand of a deputy, and keeping my head down in vain effort to avoid the painful glare. I dealt only with a hand extending from the brown embroidered sleeve of a Pima County Sheriff's deputy uniform. I also recall in hat same sleeve a skinny, whitish, spindly wrist and hand, far too thin for the garment. These memories are overlapping. There are a number of overlapping, illusionary images during this incident that I'll mention. We were led from our car to behind the light. My headache passed, but a thick fuzziness remained. The vehicle behind the light was round, about 12' - 15' in diameter at thigh level, gracefully sloping up to a one-food wide rounded point in its center. That part stood about 7'-8' high, not much taller than me. Metallic, the whole contraption was covered with fine concentric gr ooves and glowed a soft brass color. We were urged by the voices behind us to get closer, to investigate this object, but after I touched it a few times (metal, yet \"soft\" due to a very high rate of vibration), I was warned from behind that it wasn't good to keep touching, that it was \"too hot\" for me. Then we were encouraged to circle the thing. These instructions were in clear, unaccented English, but whenever I started to look behind to see who'd spoken, there was a rustle of avoidance on their part and I understood to keep facing forward. The sonorous male voice was so clear it felt like it was in my head. I was under duress. I was aware that thing were odd, but I was simply unable to think clearly. And I strongly felt potential danger, that showing too much recognition, too much comprehension on my part could cause me harm. Every time I began to get a handle on my thought process, someone behind me recognized it and distracted me with instructions or strange activity. And I felt that I damn well better follow instructions. I circled the object more than once, though I can remember only the times I was moving along one side. I recall seeing my companions walking ahead of me along the far side and I was following, but I never remember reaching there. Eventually (years later), I recalled a simple brownish arch that we all repeatedly passed through on the far side, and that this passing through stimulated brief and vivid physical, visual (those colored balls again), and mental stimulations. I don't know if all three of my car companions were walking with us. I know the woman was unquestionably in a position of authority over our group of four. Though the vehicle emitted a soft brass glow, I could see my distinct shadow on its grooved, sloped surface. I assume it was a vehicle, anyway. Whenever I took a few steps along the object's circumference and then stopped, my shadow took an extra step. A source of exclamation to me and my fellows, our \"experiments\" and reactions humored our visitors. [ Editor's Note: USAF Airman Larry Warren also described seeing his shadow \"take an extra step\" when he and other military security ringed a landed \"aspirin-shaped craft\" at Bentwaters AFB, England, in late December 1980. Warren also said small, grey-type entities seemed to float through the walls of the craft out into the air, not touching the ground, in front of the security men.]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Sometimes I wonder if there was someone inside playing a joke on us because at one point, my shadow waved its hands over its head and jumped. Then I heard laughter behind me, and more instructions to walk and watch. My mind became immediately refocused on this activity and I dismissed the previous incongruity. Then I vaguely recall hearing a male announce, \"Okay, that's enough games. Get to it.\" I can't account for all of my time during this event. There are chronological gaps between the shadow experiments and the time for us to return to our car. It's during this \"loose\" time that I remember some illusionary images: first, an old, black coal locomotive with a cattle guard went racing by we four car passengers. It was followed within seconds by a fast moving, more modern diesel engine, its headlight sweeping the ground in front. Both engines pulled train cars. We four stood chatting calmly beside the tracks, a mere four or five feet away, undisturbed by the prox imity of the trains and the enormous noise. Locomotives had been out of service for 50 years. And no trains follow within seconds of each other, not at those speeds. It was absurd and incongruous and obviously an illusion. I was led back to our car. On the way, I glanced over the saucer-like vehicle and spied a very tall man behind it who instinctively retreated, not wanting to be seen. He had thick, black hair and moustache and looked like pictures of those Hindu demons with eyes so large and round that the whites are visible all around the iris. A permanent state of surprise. Returning to the front of the bright light brought back my headache. R akshasa, a Hindu demon, depicted with whites of eyes showing in Yakshagana theatrical opera. Source: Wikipedia. Obediently, I climbed in the car and shut the door. Now I was in the right front seat and I laid my poor aching head in my arms on the dashboard. Then the unbearable light was off, as was the dusty old lamp on the phone pole. I recall a fairly bright bluish-white moonlike glow over the area. My headache was gone. With my head in my arms, I was trying to catch my breath, wondering why my chest was so constricted from fear, wondering why I was so scared. Glancing to my right, I apprehensively rolled up my window. I couldn't get it closed fast enough. There was a figure out there looking at me from about twenty to thirty feet away. With effort, I mustered up the courage to sneak a look at it under my armpit. It had come closer. Not two feet way from me, I saw the upper toro and head of a 4' - 4.5' tall humanoid. The thin body and oval head were a uniform, dull gray-blue, the large coal-black eyes the same shape as the head - an oval on end.The eyes were expressionless and matter-of-fact, but they"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"caused utter terror to rip through me. My companions climbed back into the car. Hiding my head in my arms, I commanded our driver (the dark blond, bearded guy) to \"Go! They want us to go!\" I had a distinct impression They did. \"Okay, we will,\" he replied calmly. \"Take a look at them first.\" I was appalled at his suggestion. I was the Union Army routed at Bull Run; I was the 5 o'clock rush hour beneath Godz illa's feet. What I was not was in any way interested in viewing another split-second of that nightmare outside my window! \"No! Just go! Leave! THEY WANT US TO LEAVE!\" Our driver was infuriatingly reasonable. \"We will, we will. Just take a quick look at it, just for a second.\" This was in a lighthearted bantering tone. \"No!\" I screamed. 'NO, NO, NO!\" Never have I felt such terror before or since and I've been in some mighty tight spots. Totally enslaved by a merciless fear, I wept as it surged into every corner of my mind. I cried and gritted my teeth in tearful rage and stammered, \"Go! Go!\" It was incomprehensible to me that this man wouldn't drive away! I was twenty-six and had been held at gunpoint six times and had had a knife to my throat twice. I thought I knew about fear, but this was far beyond anything I'd ever known. There was almost no room in it for anger. It was panic. \"Really,\" he crooned. \"I don't see what you're getting so blown out about. They just wanted to check us out.\" \"Leave, goddammit!\" I screamed through my tears. \"I told you to get the fuck out of here!\" Grabbing the keys in the ignition, I turned them and started the car. He angrily slapped away my hand and shut it off. Then he took a deep composing breath and got insanely reasonable again. \"Now, just lift up your head and turn it to the right. We're not leaving t ill you do.\" His mocking calm jabbed like a cattle prod. \"Go ahead now, just lift up your head. Make the muscles on the back of your neck tighten and pull your head up...\" My murderous anger fought to grab mental nooks and crannies, then was swept away by gushing terror. If gouging his eyes out would've gotten him driving, I would've done it. I considered it, but I would've had to drag him out of the driver's seat afterwards and that would have been too time-consuming. I was ready to kill him. 'DRIVE!\" I bellowed from two feet away. \"Goddam you - I said drive! They-want-us-to-go!\" \"Okay, okay,\" he snorted. \"I don't see what the big deal is, though.\" He finally got us out of there. On the return to my apartment, I have vague memories of calmly and lucidly discussing my awe that I'd been willing to gouge out his eyes. He and the woman (who was in the left back set) were interrogating me. When she heard something from me she didn't like, she'd turn on the overhead light and verbally press harder. Again, I felt my safety rested on not indicating any cognizance, this time not showing clear memory of what had just taken place. They double-parked with the engine running in front of my door. I was groggy and fuzzed up again, barely able to walk."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\"Is he okay?\" the woman called from the back seat. \"Can we make it?\" \"Yeah, he's okay,\" the driver assured her. \"Are you okay?\" I grunted and stumbled out, leaning on parked cars as I passed between them. Just another late night drunk. \"See, he's Okay.\" My memory of this is of watching myself from above, as if through a hazy frame of steel wool. I fell through my door and into bed and into a deep, dreamless sleep. I bolted wake to a sitting position and it was morning. I had amnesiated almost everything that had happened. It took months and years to recall it. Many a night has long since passed and played its sheen through my vague dreams, and many a light has danced my darkened room and teased capricious memories. Thirty years have come and gone since the events of that traumatic night, yet hardly a day has passed when I haven't thought about it. What happened there involved the bending and stealing of my time. It is timeless.
