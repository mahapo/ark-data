These unusual cat deaths have been found in West Fort Worth near Interstate 30 between Forest Park Boulevard and Cherry Lane. Humane Society investigators say what happened was not an accident, but calculated cruelty by at least one individual. The strange deaths have included a hanging, a cat that had been skinned, and another that had its tail sliced in two halves down its length. FBI behavioral scientists warn that many serial killers start out venting anger on cats and take pleasure in cat torture. But so far, law enforcement does not have any suspects and Fort Worth residents are urged to keep their pets inside. Over the same time period, bloodlessly decapitated and mutilated cats have been found in San Jose, California (See: 10/3/99); London, England (See: 8/25/99); and Toronto, Canada. Other cases involving excisions of paws and/or back leg from cats in Tucson, Arizona occurred back in March and June 1999. Toronto, Ontario, Canada: The Toronto cases, which have included bloodless decapitations, were the subject of a Toronto Sun news report on August 13, 1999. Under the headline \"More cats slain in Willowdale,\" reporter Joe Warmington wrote: \"The mysterious death and mutilation of three more cats in North York (August 12, 1999) has animal cruelty investigators on alert for a potential serial cat killer. (These new deaths) come just weeks after five other cats were reported killed and mutilated in the Leslie Street and Finch Avenue area. \"The way they were cut and the fact there wasn't a trail of blood leads investigators to discount a predator - like a fox - is responsible for the killings. As many as fifteen cats in the vicinity of Finch Avenue have also been reported missing in the last year.\" Debby Hunt, Inspector of the Ontario Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, told Warmington, \"If somebody is deliberately doing this, they could face a $2,000 fine and six months in jail.\" Hunt has appealed to the public to come forward with information. The hotline number is: 416-410-4836. Tucson, Arizona: On June 14, 1999, the Arizona Daily Star reported that the Humane Society of Tucson and Pima County Animal Control were investigating a rash of cat mutilations in March and June. In March, six cats were found with their back paws cut off. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Humane Society Education Director, Marsh Myers, said, \"With the original (March) cat mutilations, we were seeing that the animals had (parts of) hind legs removed. What we're seeing now is a new type of mutilation in which cats are cut down the center from the throat to the pubic area. The rib cage is spread and then the organs are either removed or tied around the animal.\" One cat owner, Dennis Tulino, lost one of his eight cats and found another injured. Elvis was found across the street from Tulino's home. His throat was slit, the rib cage opened, but there was no blood. At about the same time, another Tulino cat, Sonic, was found with one of its back legs injured by an unknown attacker. Tucson Police Sergeant Brett Klein said, \"(The reports) have been so disjointed. They have been anywhere from the east side to west side of town. There's nothing to pinpoint. I haven't really seen enough of a trend to tell people to keep their cats in.\" Tucson cat mutilations can be reported to: (520) 321-3704.
