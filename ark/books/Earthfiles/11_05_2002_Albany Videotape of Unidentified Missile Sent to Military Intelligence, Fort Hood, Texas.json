Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Albany Videotape of Unidentified \"Missile\" Sent to Military Intelligence, Fort Hood, Texas © 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe On Sunday, October 20, 2002, at 4:20 p.m. EDT, FOX 23 News videographer, Brandon Mowry, was filming a weather segment for WXXA-TV in Albany, New York. While the camera was still running, he lifted the camera 180 degrees to get another shot of a plane taking off. He did not know at the time that he caught seven frames (1/3rd second) of digital videotape of the jet airliner passing out of the upper right corner and a strange, missile-like, unidentified aerial object rapidly passing through sky and seemingly through a cloud estimated to be at 5,000 feet or more. Darker blue \"line\" at center of frame is the rapidly moving unidentified object that is enlarged inside the white oval in lower left corner.Videotape © Fox 23 News WXXA, Albany, New York. November 4, 2002 Albany, New York - There has been much speculation about what the strange object is that has a long body and seems to blend into the blue sky, but also has white fin-like structures at the front and back of the object. (See Earthfiles 10/29/02 ) Today, I talked with FOX23 videographer, Brandon Mowry, at the station and learned that his assignment desk has received word that the investigation has now branched out from the FBI to a military intelligence unit at Fort Hood, Texas, southwest of Waco.

Brandon Mowry, Videographer, FOX 23 News WXXA-TV, Albany, New Yo r k : \"DID THEY SAY WHAT SPECIFIC OFFICE OR INDIVIDUAL IS HEADING THE FORT HOOD INVESTIGATION? Let me ask real quick. ... My assignment desk just talked to me. I guess, Military Intelligence, the Dept. of Military Intelligence at Fort Hood. AT FORT HOOD IN TEXAS. They have the tape and they launched an investigation about whether or not this is a missile. I guess they were saying like that TWA Flight 800. They said someone has captured a picture before that they think a missile brought that plane down. So, I guess that's why they are investigating this so closely, the military is. THIS IS MILITARY INTELLIGENCE AT FORT HOOD IN TEXAS. AND IF THEY HAVE THE VIDEOTAPE, THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE GOTTEN IT FROM THE FBI. Yeah, probably. BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T ASKED YOU FOR A COPY? No. No. Yeah, they must have. WHO CALLED YOUR ASSIGNMENT DESK AT THE STATION TO TELL THEM? I'm not sure. Let me ask him right now. ... OK, he won't tell me his name. REALLY? Yeah, he says he promised that this guy who called that it's all off the record not to give anyone his name or what he has done. IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S SERIOUS. Yeah. Yeah.\" Brandon also got an e-mail today from the Senior Editor at Defense Watch , an on-line periodical devoted to military matters and homeland security, planning to do a story about the Albany videotape later this week. FOX 23 is now preparing news specials to follow up on Brandon Mowry's videotape which will be broadcast first on FOX and then UPN in Albany. For COAST TO COAST AM listeners in the Albany area, you can tune in to the first of four broadcasts on FOX 23, Sunday, November 24, beginning at 8:30 a.m EST. In addition to Brandon Mowry, one of the scheduled guests will be Dr. John Delano, Associate Professor and Director of Geochmistry and the Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Albany. Prof. Delano is also associated with a NASA research and training department known as the New York Center for Studies on the Origins of Life. The \"Rod\" Phenomenon Jose Escamilla, who studies the baffling \"rod\" phenomenon, sent me some images of another long object crossing near the tail of another airliner over Dickinson, North Dakota in the summer of 2001.

The following is an e-mail exchange I had this past week with Jose Escamilla about his \"rod\" phenomenon research. In addition to the North Dakota objects above compared to the Albany, New York object, Jose plans to send other photos referenced in his November 1, 2002 e-mail reply. Nov. 1, 2002 Hi, Mr. Escamilla: Appreciate the work you have done on the mysterious \"rods\" phenomenon and know you talked about the Albany, NY object with Art Bell on COAST. On Monday, I had a follow-up with the FOX videographer on a COAST segment with George Noory. The cameraman thinks the object was at the cloud ceiling level of 5,000 feet and thus, quite long in relationship to the airliner that passed above him at an estimated 300 feet altitude. Wondered what size parameter ranges you have found for \"rods\" in your research?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Reply on 11/1/02 3:37 PM, Jose Escamilla wrote: > \"Hi Linda! > > Thanks for your message.
