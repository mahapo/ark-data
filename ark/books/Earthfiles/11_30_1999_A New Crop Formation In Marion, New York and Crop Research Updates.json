Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon A New Crop Formation In Marion, New York and Crop Research Updates © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe November 21, 1999 Marion New York - The latest formation on record, at least in soybeans, formed around October 21st when it was discovered in Marion, New York about 30 miles east of Rochester near Lake Ontario. The farmer was havesting at night with spotlights and was shocked to discover the curves, circles and corridors of this new pictogram in exactly the same place he found another formation in mid-August 1997. This new one was lined up north to south with a 24-foot-diameter ring at the top connected by a long corridor to a large comma-shape. Fifty feet straight east of the comma was a small 6 foot circle, known as a \"grape shot.\" The entire formation was apparently crowned by a thin arc which the farmer had nearly obliterated in his night time harvesting before he realized the pictogram was there. All the circle, ring and arc plants were laid down counter-clockwise, except for one small circle at the end of the comma which was clockwise. Survey © 1999 by investigator Larry Thomas of Marion, New York soybean formation discovered October 21, 1999. The investigator who has studied and sampled soil and grass from both the 1997 and 1999 Marion pictograms is researcher and dowser, Larry Thomas of Newark, New York. I asked Mr. Thomas how closely the 1999 and 1997 formations lined up. Larry Thomas, Crop Circle Investigator, Newark, New York: \"I would have to say this particular formation is virtually on top of the previous one. The farmer told me that he had a power failure occur somewhere around the time that the latest circle here appeared. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"THAT'S BEEN REPORTED IN ENGLAND AS WELL. POWER FAILURES THE NIGHT BEFORE A FORMATION HAS OCCURRED. I understand that. As a matter of fact, our video cameras both died on us when we were at the recent circle. YOUR VIDEO CAMERAS DIED? WERE 35MM CAMERAS ABLE TO OPERATE? Yes, they seemed to do OK. But for some reason both fully charged video cameras died. One died actually as we entered the circle. The other one which was mine gave us maybe five minutes or so of videotape. DID NEARBY RESIDENTS NOTICE ANY UNUSUAL LIGHTS OR AERIAL OBJECTS? Well, Linda, not in the current 1999 formation, but they did see some things in the 1997 formation. WHICH WAS IN OATS? Which was in oats. SAME FARM, SAME FIELD. Exact location, yes.

One individual had a sighting that occurred around August 22nd, I believe,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"around 11:30 PM. And she was walking her dog and she noticed a slight humming noise and a bright light. She looked up and saw an object hovering directly over the field where the crop circle was formed later. The object was about three cars wide and had a distinct overall appearance of an acorn in shape. It had a domed roof with a distinct ridge or band running around the center. And it was about 500 yards from her when she witnessed it. THIS WAS SUSPENDED IN THE AIR NOT MOVING? That's correct. And I'd say the entire viewing probably took about twenty seconds before it shot off rapidly to the northeast. A lot of researchers can potentially find light ball activities around these kinds of formations, especially at night. It's not in the daytime. I know there have been a few sightings and videotapes taken over in England of balls of light floating or hovering around the crops. But what can be done is what I've done for some time now which is to take photographs at night time over the crop circle formations. And when we take photos at night time, we almost invariably show spheres, some even geometric shapes, hovering or streaking across the formation. Larry Thomas used the flash on his 35mm camera to take photographs in the dark at the Marion, New York crop formation in oats, August 1997. In several images on different nights, white spheres that appear slightly translucent appeared. Photograph © 1997 by Larry Thomas, Newark, New York. Larry Thomas photographed inside the oat formation in August 1997. He saw nothing unusual at the time, but this grey \"plasma\" with the same translucent quality as the night spheres was on this daylight frame after the film was developed.

LEVENGOOD IN MICHIGAN, THERE WERE MANY"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"MYSTERIOUS MAGNETIC PARTICLES SUCH AS THOSE FOUND ALSO IN CROP FORMATION SOILS IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, ENGLAND, AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. NANCY TALBOTT IN CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS COORDINATES THE SOIL AND PLANT SAMPLING FOR DR. LEVENGOOD AND TALKED TO ME THIS WEEK ABOUT THE 1997 MARION FORMATION ANALYSES AND OTHER DISCOVERIES IN CROP FORMATION RESEARCH. Nancy Talbott, Coordinator, BLT Research Team, Cambridge, Massachusetts : \"That particular one revealed some very interesting findings. The disposition of the magnetic materials in the soils following this precise distribution relative to distance. So, if you were sampling let's say the edge of the circle out into the standing crop, you got a drop in the amount of magnetic material in the soil that followed a nice curve as you moved farther and farther away from the formation itself. Red arrows indicate examples of the magnetic particles found in the soil of the August 1997 Marion, New York oats formation. Microscope photograph © 1997 by W. C. Levengood, Ph.D., Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, Grass Lake, Michigan. MEANING GETTING LESS AND LESS AS YOU GOT TO THE PERIMETER? Getting less and less as you got farther out into the standing crop. Furthermore, we also found in that particular event, there were three circles laid in a spiral lay - that means starting at the center and then spiraling outward to the edges of those circles. Two of the circles, however, were radically laid - that means starting at the center and flowing directly out to the perimeter, not spiraling, just going straight out to the edges. What we found was that - we sampled three of those circles, two spirals and one radial lay. And of those three, the two spiral circles revealed a disposition of this magnetic material that fits the centrifugal, mathematical predictions of amounts that would be deposited according to the laws of centrifugal force. MEANING THERE WOULD BE MORE GOING TO THE PERIMETER OF THE CIRCLE? Correct. And that's exactly what was obtained there. BUT IN THE RADIAL LAY, IT WOULD BE WHERE THE ENERGY CAME DOWN IN THE CENTER AND SPLAYED OUT, IT BECAME LESS."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Precisely. THE OPPOSITE. Precisely. ARE YOU SEEING ANYTHING IN THE YEAR 1999 YET FROM THE VARIOUS SAMPLES YOU HAVE DONE FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY THAT IS REINFORCING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SOME KIND OF SPINNING PLASMA VORTEX WITH MICROWAVE AND ELECTRONIC ENERGY IS INTERACTING WITH THE PLANTS? I think the most stunning observation I have so far from this summer's work is that plant samples which are arriving at the laboratory now - from the work this summer - are by and large showing an energy signature, if you will - meaning the abnormal plant findings - the signature is much greater - it is more intense. The node lengths are visibly - you don't need a microscope to do the measurements. It is very clear. The number of expulsion cavities, the holes blown out at the nodes, absolutely massive. I saw them personally in four countries this summer. WHICH COUNTRIES? The Netherlands, England, the U. S. and Canada. I'm sure they are in other countries. Those are the four I happened to be in and so I saw them. The numbers of these expulsion cavities and the degree- not just in the second node, but down in the third and fourth nodes - and whole areas just blown, the plants almost blown apart. In one of the cases we're working on in Montana, we have ... WHICH IS WHITEFISH. That's the Whitefish case. WHICH SORT OF LOOKS LIKE THE AMERICAN INDIAN SYMBOL FOR THE SUN. Yes. And looks very much like a formation that occurred there last summer but which was not sampled. AT MY WEB SITE I SHOW THE CONTRAST OF THE PHOTOS. THEY ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL AND THOSE FORMATIONS ARE LESS THAN FIVE MILES APART. (Sept. 9, 1999 earthfiles.com) Really. Well, the one this year was sampled and in that case what we're seeing is a number of very interesting things. The crimped at the base of the seed head, the petiole, which you observed in Avebury. IT HAD THAT TWISTED LOOK. Yep, in the so-called manmade one at Avebury. That same effect was found all over the place in this Montana case. In addition to a crimping or spiraling effect at the base of the seed head in the stem itself. In addition, we have seed heads that appear to have been blown off, not cut, not effected by crows or animals, but blown off with the leaves twisted around in a tight spiral around where the seed head would have been. OF THE ENTIRE 1999 YEAR IN THE FOUR COUNTRIES AND EVERYTHING YOU HAVE PERSONALLY HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT, WHAT DO YOU THINK HAS FALLEN INTO THE HIGHEST STRANGENESS CATEGORY. The Edmonton, Alberta case is going to be phenomenal. (October 2 , 1999 earthfiles.com) And the Whitefish, Montana case is equally amazing. "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Edmonton, Alberta, Canada Formation CAN YOU TELL US A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE HIGH STRANGENESS IN EDMONTON? First of all, you have seven circles in a basic quincunx - a center circle with four outlayers, you know? In the north and south outlayers, instead of having them a small distance away, connect them to the formation, so they are touching, and then connected to both of those circles are two smaller. So it's a total of 7 circles in this basic design. The design is not that unusual now. We see this fairly regularly. The fact of the matter is there is a radial lay in all 7. I've never seen a formation with 7 circles - I've never seen a radial lay throughout a formation, first of all. THAT'S AS IF ENERGY COMES STRAIGHT DOWN TO THE CENTER OF THE CIRCLE AND SPLAYS OUT... Shoots directly out. EVERYTHING IS GOING STRAIGHT OUT AND NO CURVES ANYWHERE? No. Straight out. Furthermore, in those circles, there is about a 6-inch wide pathway of laid crop around the perimeters of each circle where this 6-inch wide area is laid counter-clockwise underneath the radial lay. So, it obviously had to go down first. TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT LAYERS. Completely different doing completely different things. We have these several witnesses, one of whom is being developed as we speak - we are trying to get all the details so we have it absolutely correct - but it looks like someone on the road only about 100 feet or so from this field - actually observed a light over the field while this formation was occurring. There are a number of other witnesses who observed lights in the general area at the general time. Furthermore, the entire family has had a number of encounters with lights. One of which occured within two days either prior or immediately after the crop circle occurred where the light chased the car in which the family was driving. The parents were. In this Edmonton formation, not only do we have this radial lay and the underlying permiter lay that is counter-clockwise and all the light phenomena and all this other stuff, the plants themselves in this particular case - the first nodes underneath the seed head, which is called the apical node, is so enlarged in all of the downed crop that my guess is that when the work is done in the laboratory we're going to get a 250% to 300% node length increase. That is phenomenal! The greatest amount of node length increase that we had prior to that in the ten years of this work we've been doing is about a 217% at Blue Ball, Maryland, one of those cases that you were involved in many years ago. That was a randomly downed formation, not a geometric. This one is a geometric. In addition to this massive node length increase, there are expulsion cavities everywhere in second, third and fourth nodes. Everywhere! You would literally have to be blind not to see these changes in the plants. THERE IS DEFINITELY A LINK BETWEEN LIGHTS AND A LOT OF FORMATION ACTIVITY - WHATEVER THEY ARE. Yeah, and this summer, I'd say it was 90 to 95% of the people start to offer this sort of information without me mentioning it - I never mention anything like this. It's usually in the part of the interview when I ask them if they have noticed television interference, smoke alarms in their house going off, car alarms, battery failure, unusual behavior of the animals on their property, either domestic animals, cattle or horses - and it's in that part of the questionnaire that they start"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"to spontaneously tell me these stories of light phenomena and sometimes craft, either immediately around the time that their crop formation occurred or at some time historically over the last five years or ten years or whatever. In other words, they apparently are making the connection themselves. IN ENGLAND I THINK THEY HAD, ONE COUNT WAS ABOUT 160 FORMATIONS IN 1999? Right. IN THE NETHERLANDS AND GERMANY, WHAT WAS THE BREAK DOWN THERE? I think that Germany may have reported 15 to 20 of them. The Netherlands - they actually aren't getting full counts because a huge number of these events are now occurring in close proximity to this boy Robert (in Hoeven) - and the family is not reporting them for a number of reasons, primarily the farmer involved has been extremely intolerant and they don't want many people going into the property because this man has so many he would lose his entire crop if every one of them was reported. CAN YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE SINCE WE DID THE INTERVIEWS BACK IN JUNE, I BELIEVE, ABOUT ROBERT? CAN YOU GIVE SOME HIGHLIGHTS OF WHAT OTHER EXPERIENCES HE HAS HAD AND WHAT HAS OCCURRED? He has now seen so many of these formed, starting the last two or three years ago when he happened to be in a field in daytime, saw these balls of light. Some of them detached themselves, approached him. He passed out. When he came to, he was lying in the middle of a brand new crop circle. Then, many things - balls of light, balls approaching the house, burn marks on the house, white powders being left which we analyzed and found out were magnesium oxide, a number of other peculiar events there. And then this summer, he saw these three different formations occur early on in the summer - two in the middle of the night and one at 3 o'clock in the afternoon. All three with a different visual stimuli. This pinkish purple light was the first one. The second one was a flash of light. The third one was a ball, a brilliant white-yellow ball of light that he observed in the middle of the afternoon. Since then, there have been numerous other formations in that field and he has in every case witnessed what went down as it occurred. Primarily lights of one sort or another. THE FORMATIONS THAT HE IS SEEING, ARE THEY LARGELY SIMPLE CIRCLES? They are - yes, largely. The third one, the one created by the so-called ball of light at 3 o'clock in the afternoon - was not a simple circle. It was a circle with spokes going off rather the way a child would draw a picture of the sun. There were 6 or 8 spokes on this particular formation. And in some cases, they are tiny adn sometimes they are very large, several hundred meters across, there was one. HE HAS ACTUALLY SEEN THE CROP GO DOWN IN RELATIONSHIP TO A LIGHT OVER THAT MUCH AREA? Ye s . HOW FAST DOES IT OCCUR FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW/ Usually the descriptions are that the light phenomena is observed first for several seconds, 10, 15, 20 seconds - sometimes even 30 seconds. Then, just before it dissipates or goes out, the crop goes down. The crop goes down instantly when it goes. There is an energy discharge observed in some of the cases. Something that appears to come from underneath the light or the form down to the crop surface. These lights, the balls, the flashes, all of them are generally seen at about 10 to 12 feet over the crop surface. They are watched in place for ten or"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"fifteen seconds and then, BOOM!, the crop goes down and the light object - it usually doesn't go away. It simply goes out. It disappears as if you turned a light bulb off. DID HE TALK WITH YOU AT ALL ABOUT WHAT HE'S ACTUALLY SEEING IN TERMS OF THE STEMS OF THE PLANTS OR THE HEADS BENDING OVER FIRST? IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE WAY THE CROP IS GOING DOWN? His house is about 30 or 40 meters away from this field. The field is large. The formations occur anywhere from 50 to 100 meters behind his house. Robert is not particularly interested in the science. He is not partic. interested in those kinds of details. The way he describes it is that the entire plant goes down. The whole area goes down underneath whatever he's seeing. Now, it depends on how close it is to these windows that happen to be off his bedroom as to how much of it he can see. In some cases, he can't see the thing go down. Depends on how close it is. If the area is close, you can stand on his balcony and this summer I could clearly see two of the three formations just by looking out his windows. The third one was far enough away, you just couldn't see it. It was great. It was terrifically interesting to me that because he goes out to the fields immediately as soon as this happens and gets there within 2 to 5 minutes after the event has occurred - he reported this crackling noise in every case this summer. That the ground was hot to the touch. He feels the energy in these things and having been with him on many occasions and feeling some of this energy myself, my description of it would be it feels very electrostaticky, electrical. It feels a bit like you're very close to an electrical outlet of some sort.\" A Biophysicist's Perspective on Crop Formations BIOPHYSICIST W. C. LEVENGOOD DID HIS ACADEMIC WORK AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN, HOLDS MANY PATENTS INCLUDING ONE FOR A SEED ANALYZER AND HAS BEEN STUDYING PLANTS INSIDE AND OUTSIDE CROP FORMATIONS FOR THE PAST DECADE. I ASKED HIM WHAT HE THINKS IS THE STRONGEST PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IS OCCURRING IN CROP FORMATIONS? W. C. Levengood, Ph.D., Biophysicist, Grass Lake, Michigan : \"I suppose it's the tremendous expansion of these plant nodes that extend over a huge area. I mean, we have crop formations that are several hundred feet in diameter. And they follow this fundamental principle of physics that describes the absorption of the energies. There is no way that anyone could take any device out in the field and produce through any means that I know of at the present time. WHICH THEN REINFORCES THE FACT THAT YOU CAN DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN UNAFFECTED (HOAXED) FORMATIONS AND THE TRULY MYSTERIOUS ONES? Oh, without question. I've looked at over probably 250 crop formations in detail. OF ALL THE FORMATION WORK YOU HAVE DONE, WHAT HAS SURPRISED OR SHOCKED YOU THE MOST? My discovery that out of the crop formations you can get seeds that look sickly. A seedsman or a farmer would take one look at them and say, 'I'm not going to plant those seeds. They're dead!' And then when you plant them, you find they way outstrip the normal plant seeds. WHICH IS WHAT INSPIRED YOUR PATENT? That's right. I think that's been what of the biggest things. And one of the biggest satisfactions is the discovery that the node expansions follow the Biere-Lambert"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"principle of the absorption of electromagnetic radiation. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT FOR A RADIO AUDIENCE ABOUT THE PATENT YOU HAVE DEVELOPED CONCERNING APPLICATIONS OF ENERGIES TO ACCELERATE GROWTH? Yeah, this patent came out of some work I was doing, some fundamental work. My main interest in the biophysical area is dealing with the transport of ions in plants. These are charged particles that all living things have in them. And one of the aspects of this was to determine how they could be guided electrofluoretically. Now, electrofluoresis is the guidance of charged molecules by electric fields. I won't bother getting into details of that, but it occurs naturally inside plants if there is an electric field present. I was applying electric fields to see how I could guide these ions through the plant. And I had been studying this for several years before I even got involved in the crop formations. Then after this very startling discovery came along that sometimes the seeds were enhanced inside of crop formations - in spite of the fact that their seed weights were maybe 30 or 40% less than the controls, or normal plants, I decided, 'What's going on here?' We have found that if you apply an electric field that's been stimulated by the right kind of over-riding oscillating field, that you induce in the air what are called ion electron avalanches. And these impinge on the plant and produce what I call a molecular impulse response effect. And this can stimulate the dry seeds to grow more and produce higher yields and to grow more uniformly after they have been exposed. And it doesn't apply any dangerous chemical or changing the genes or anything else. RIGHT, BECAUSE IN THIS WORLD WHERE WE ARE WORRYING ABOUT FOOD PRODUCTION TO AN EXPANDING POPULATION, IT WOULD SEEM THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL CONTRIBUTION BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT INVOLVE ARTIFICIAL CHEMISTRY. Oh, yeah. And it's repeatable. The interesting thing is that the correlation with what's going on in the crop formations is that the crop formations also produce this very unusual ion electron avalanche that impinges on the plants and even these seeds are retarded in growth, they still receive what I call this MIR energy, or molecular impulse response, and they end up growing at a fantastic rate and producing higher yields. HOW WOULD YOU APPLY THIS ON LARGE FARMS? We apply it to the seeds before they are put in the ground.\" More Information: To report crop formations, please call: Nancy Talbott, BLT Research, Cambridge, Mass 617-492-0415 or FAX 617-492-0414 Also, please: FAX Linda Moulton Howe at: 215-491-9842 or e-mail earthfiles@earthfiles.com For more information about the scientific and mathematical analyses of crop formations which include many color photographs and illustrations, please see Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses and other crop circle books and calendar listed in the Earthfiles Shop .
