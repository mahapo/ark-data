S. Navy DC1 Lloyd Eugene Camp February 17, 2006 Algood, Tennessee - For the past year, I have been reporting about the revelations of former New Mexico State Representative, Andrew Kissner, from Las Cruces in Dona Ana County. Las Cruces is not far from White Sands Missile Range. Andy's work in local construction projects brought him in contact with White Sands employees who told him about flying discs that interfered with rocket launches from 1947 onward. Back in the Truman Administration, it was called White Sands Proving Ground. That's where German physicists were brought after World War II in Project PAPERCLIP to work on American research and development of captured German V-2 and Wasserfall rockets. In May 1947, at least two German rockets launched from White Sands went off course and crashed. In both instances, round, aerial discs were seen visually and on radar near the rockets just before the rapidly moving missiles veered from their trajectories. One on May 29, 1947, turned 180 degrees in mid-air and crashed near the new airport in Juarez, Mexico. The result was a huge crater in the ground, but nothing was left of the large rocket. Andrew Kissner's sources told him the truth was that the launched rocket had evaporated . The implication was that the disc technology was responsible. The Base Commander explained to the media that \"peculiar phenomena\" had interfered with the rocket tests. The \"peculiar phenomena\" were the unidentified aerial discs.

July 4 - 6, 1947: Disc Crashes and Retrievals Near Roswell and White Sands Proving Ground Five weeks later, between July 4 to 6, 1947, three aerial craft described in leaked government documents as \"not from this world,\" crashed in three New Mexico sites: one was on the Mac Brazel ranch between Corona and Roswell; a second was found at the "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Trinity Site at the northern end of White Sands Proving Ground where we tested the first atomic bomb in July 1945; and a third was discovered on the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation 30 miles east of Alamogordo and Holloman AFB. Craft and non-human bodies both dead and alive were retrieved from the crash sites. Afterward, Andrew Kissner was told that American President Harry S. Truman authorized a 1947 classified Executive Order and extended the War Powers Act to enforce a strict cover-up of all matters related to an extraterrestrial presence on this planet. That Presidential Executive Order appears to still be in effect today nearly 60 years later. One of Andy Kissner's most important sources was a high ranking officer at White Sands Proving Ground who died in 1998. He gave Andy some reasons why the U. S. government has lied and misinformed about the extraterrestrial presence for more than half a century: government insiders watched on radar and saw in photographs the \"peculiar phenomena\" - advanced aerial devices that could easily keep pace with our rapidly moving V-2 rocket tests; government insiders were shocked that the disc technology had an advanced beam technology which can lift up and lower animals and people; government insiders concluded at least one non-human agenda is to harvest genetic material from animals and people transported by the beam technology; and government insiders learned that the non-human intelligence has, and will, retaliate if attacked. In the past several months - as I have reported about the disc crashes and retrievals and the American government's strict policy of denial in the interest of national security I have received many letters and e-mails from people who had parents or relatives serving in the U. S. military during the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. One of those more recent contacts is from Sherry Camp Malin. She was born on February 6, 1959, in Coalmont, Tennessee. Her father, Lloyd Eugene Camp, spent his 35-year career in the U. S. Navy and yet his daughter, Sherry Camp Malin, thought he told her in the hospital before he died in 1993 that he retired as a Sergeant Major, which would be a U. S. Army rank. [ See Andrew Kissner comments in Update below.] In 1947, Lloyd Camp was 29-years-old and had moved his family to the White Sands Proving Ground area of New Mexico where he worked in radar and V-2 rocket research. 1918 - 1993 I n late 1940s to 1950s, Lloyd Eugene Camp was a DC1 in U. S. Navy at White Sands Proving Ground working in radar and V-2 rocket launches. Photograph provided by his daughter, Sherry Camp Malin. Sherry contacted me because she heard about my reports that aerial discs interfered with V-2 rocket launches and she wanted me to know that her father told the family he had watched strange disc-shaped aerial objects circle around rockets after launches from White Sands.

Naval National Agency Check for clearance upgrade to SECRET for Lloyd Eugene Camp, Rank DC1 (rest of rank information destroyed by disintegration of document's right side) in June 1953 when the above U. S. Naval document was written and signed by W. D. Wilkin and copied to Director of Naval Intelligence, Local Military Personnel Record, District Intelligence Officer. Document provided by Sherry Malin. Comment from Andrew J. Kissner, former New Mexico State Representative and author, Peculiar Phenomenon. Lloyd Eugene Camp told his family that he retired after 35 years of military service as a Sergeant Major, which is an Army rank. But the family only knew he worked for the Navy. Andrew Kissner: \"The White Sands Proving Ground (WSPG) from the 1940s on has always operated as a U. S. Army installation. In that context, the Army is the 'landlord' for a wide variety of U. S. Navy, Air Force and other agency 'tenant' facilities. The Army provides White Sands Missile Range today with infrastructure such as roads, utilities and overall base security for the various operating tenant agencies and facilities. The Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) was an integral component to WSPG operations in 1947, but the Navy did not own the real estate. The land was the U. S. Army's responsibility. \"It is certainly possible that Army and Navy radar operators would be operating radar jointly, especially during Navy V-2 rocket tests. Lloyd Eugene Camp's SECRET Security Clearance document above certainly indicates Mr. Camp started as Navy personnel, indicated by the DC1 rank. His retirement as a Sergeant Major indicates U. S. Army service as well, but it is not clear why his service career would have changed from Navy to Army.\" [ Editor's Note: Sherry Malin has been searching for her father's DD-214 discharge papers for some time which should help clarify the Navy to Army evolution, if that was the situation. Earthfiles will update this report if the discharge document is found. ] Interview: Sherry Camp Malin, Homemaker, Algood, Tennessee: \"My Dad was in the Navy. He told me that he helped carry out top level research on the German V-2 rockets. Dad, he said he ran the radar equipment and he also set up the equipment and stuff for the launches. And he helped (Werner) Von Braun set up equipment. Dad would run the radar equipment, too. On several occasions, Dad could see flying saucers circling the rockets."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"O n left, Colonel Holger N.

(May 29, 1947 See: Earthfiles reports listed below in More Information. CAN YOU REMEMBER ANY SPECIFIC DETAILS HE MIGHT HAVE TOLD YOU ABOUT THE DISCS WITH WERNER VON BRAUN OR FROM A SCIENTIST POINT OF VIEW, WHAT WERE THEY DEALING WITH? He didn't say what Von Braun said they were. It was obvious to them that they didn't come from this world. They were from somewhere else. There wasn't anything on this planet that was that technologically advanced enough to do what those things did. Whenever they took off, they would circle the rockets and then the UFOs would zoom off out into space, maybe a thousand miles a minute or whatever! We just don't have anything capable of doing anything like that. WHEN YOUR FATHER TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THESE DISCS BEING INVOLVED AT THE TIME OF THE V-2 ROCKET RESEARCH AND BEING ABLE TO CIRCLE AROUND THE ROCKETS AFTER THEY WERE LAUNCHED, DID HE SAY ANYTHING TO YOU LIKE, 'YOU MUST NOT TELL ANYONE'? Yes. He told me and my brother that we should not be telling everybody about it. We didn't really discuss it. DID HE EXPLAIN WHY IT HAD TO BE KEPT A SECRET? He always said it was like for national security reasons that we really shouldn't say"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"anything. About a couple of months before he died when he was in the hospital, I decided maybe that I should talk to him about this and get all the information written down that I could find. He told me extensively about all the things he pretty well knew. I interviewed him, just so that I would have a record of this because I wanted to have his stories for my daughter whenever she becomes an adult. She might want to pass these stories down to her children. WAS HE THERE WHEN THE THREE CRAFT CRASHED NEAR CORONA, THE TRINITY SITE AT WHITE SANDS AND THE MESCALERO INDIAN RESERVATION JULY 4 TO 6, 1947 WHEN THE THREE 'INTERPLANETARY\" VEHICLES CRASHED? My dad, yes, he was out there. I don't know how much he knew about that. But he told me specifically that the Roswell crash was real. Sherry Camp Malin's Notes At Her Father's Death Bed in 1993 CAN YOU READ DIRECTLY FROM THE NOTES YOU TOOK WHEN HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL DYING? Yes, certainly. 'One time while one of the rockets was being launched, two unidentified flying objects appeared along side the rocket. My father saw them both on radar and visually from where he was. He saw what appeared to be two silvery discs circling the rocket. He observed them for several minutes before they suddenly turned on their sides and zoomed off over the Jarilla Mountain range (near Orogrande, New Mexico). 'Meanwhile, the radar equipment went haywire and locked in on the flying saucers as they quickly vanished from the radar screen, causing the men to lose track of the rocket. Then as a direct result of the interference of these flying saucers, the rocket crashed into a cemetery in Juarez, Mexico. My dad even told me that they tried shooting missiles at the flying saucers on separate occasions. He had seen these flying saucers several times circling rockets when they were launched at White Sands. 'The mysterious, silvery discs became a common nuisance at White Sands Proving Ground. My dad, as well as countless other military personnel, including pilots and radar controllers reported these events to officials in command of the White Sands Project. Eventually the word was sent out to shut the men up at all costs for the sake of national security. 'My father's name and rank at the time of these UFO sightings was Sergeant Major Lloyd Eugene Camp. [ Editor's Note: Despite Sherry's memory and notes from her father's deathbed, the SECRET clearance document above shows rank in 1953 as DC1 in U. S. Navy.] He started working at White Sands Proving Ground around 1947 and he was 29-years-old at the time he witnessed these events. 'My mom, dad and brother also saw one of these flying saucers while they were traveling through the White Sands desert one evening during the summer of 1947. I have the full details of the accounts of all three of them about their shared sighting of what they described to me as, 'like a huge, silvery pie pan turned upside down in the sky, hovering above the road ahead of them.' They witnessed this object just flip over on its side and quickly disappear into the sky.' Disc Agendas? DID HE TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT HE SPECULATED THE SOURCE OF THE DISCS W ERE? OR W HAT THE DISCUSSION WAS W ITH FE LLOW SCIENTISTS AND GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES ABOUT THE SOURCE OF THE DISCS? AND WHY WERE THEY HERE? WHY WERE THEY INTERFERING WITH THE V-2 ROCKETS? My dad told me that they all knew they were not from this world, that they were from the stars. My dad, he said that he thought because at the time we were beginning to develop"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"nuclear weapons and missiles and things of this sort that would be the destruction of our world if we let these things loose. If someone used these weapons. So, naturally, I guess that was a turning point maybe in our history, or something, that there was suddenly thousands of UFO sightings started happening around that time period. Government Cover-Up of \"Earth's Secret War\" DID YOUR FATHER EVER SAY TO YOU THAT THERE WAS SOME KIND OF EARTH'S SECRET WAR? Yes. My dad said they even declared war on these UFOs, on these ships, and they shot missiles at these things on several occasions. But it didn't do any good, of course. The missiles just wound up crashing and the guns or whatever they tried to use. The pilots would even come in talking about these things, having chased them and stuff. WAS YOUR FATHER AWARE OF EXECUTIVE ORDERS FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, FOR EXAMPLE? My dad, he said that some part of the government, they sent word back to the commanding officers and people in charge of White Sands Project to shut the men up for national security reasons and that they were not to talk about it anymore. IT DOESN'T SEEM CONSISTENT WITH WHAT WE THINK OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BEING A DEMOCRACY FOR A FEW PEOPLE TO HAVE ALL THE SECRETS ABOUT SOMETHING AS GREAT AS EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES FROM SOME PLACE ELSE BEING HERE AND BEING FIRED UPON AND PERHAPS FIRING BACK OR RETALIATING AND OUR GOVERNMENT DECLARING WAR, BUT NOT LETTING ANYBODY KNOW? Like I say, my dad I think it did upset him. He didn't think that they should be doing that. My dad didn't think he said it could probably start a panic if this stuff got out probably. Maybe that was one of the reasons they didn't want this information out there. WHAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS YOU REMEMBER HIM TELLING YOU THAT WAS THE STRANGEST OR THE MOST INCREDIBLE THING HE SAW THESE DISCS DO? I guess their speed. They could turn sideways or anything really fast. They would be gone in just an instant. It would be hard to see them. They was gone in just a second. We have nothing in this world at that time especially that could even come close to being that fast. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOUR FATHER TOLD YOU THAT OUR GOVERNMENT KNEW ABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE INSIDE THE DISCS? He said that they were more highly advanced than we ever dreamed of them being. Of course, dad was pretty secretive about a lot of that stuff. I don't think he really told me everything that he knew. DID HE EVER LEAVE YOU WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF WHATEVER THE INTELLIGENCE WAS? No. He wasn't afraid of them. THEN WHY WOULD THE GOVERNMENT GIVE OUT THE EXCUSE TO HIM AND OTHERS IN AUTHORITY THAT IF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC AND WORLD WERE TOLD THE TRUTH THAT PEOPLE WOULD PANIC? Yeah. Well, that does not make sense to me either.\" T he upside down pie pan aerial craft has long been associated with the blond humanoids referred to as \"Nordics\" or \"Swedes\" - not the grey-skinned, large black-eyed, EBENs (extraterrestrial biological entities) generally connected with egg-shaped craft, spheres or thin discs.
