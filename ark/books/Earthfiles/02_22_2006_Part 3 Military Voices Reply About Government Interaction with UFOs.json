Navy was testing a Talos missile and there were several unexplained failures. The techs who worked on the electronics swore they checked each missile several times prior to flight, but for a period of time, missiles would do 180-degree turns on themselves (like the Juarez, Mexico UFO incident) and crash.\" - S ource: V-2 Rocket Recovery Technician February 22, 2006 - On January 20-21, 2006, I posted at Earthfiles and broadcast on Coast to Coast AM radio an update with U. S. Navy physicist, Bruce Maccabee, about his discussions with a USAF geophysicist referred to as \"Hawk.\" See two-part 012106 Earthfiles. I also reported more about former New Mexico State Representative Andrew Kissner's (Dona Ana County, Las Cruces) investigations of V-2 rocket research at White Sands Proving Ground in 1947 when aerial discs interfered with launches. See \"Peculiar Phenomenon\" Real X-Files series beginning with 121905 Earthfiles. Since these several reports, I have received more than a hundred e-mails from people who have either firsthand military and/or intelligence backgrounds, or are relatives of people who have such backgrounds. Many have asked that their identity remain anonymous. I feel it is valuable to share some of the e-mails and hope other Earthfiles viewers and radio listeners will contact me with additional information that complements, or goes beyond, what I am posting in this first in a series of Earthfiles military voices. C ontinued from 020706Earthfiles: Military Voices Respond to January 2006 Earthfiles and Radio Reports 13) UFOs Caused V-2 Rocket Tests At White Sands to Go 180 Degrees Off Course and Crash \"My stepdad was stationed at White Sands Proving Ground in 1953 to 1954 and worked on missile recovery. I was there when Werner Von Braun was there and I went to school with his son. At the time, it was a small community and everyone lived on post. The U. S. Navy was there testing various missiles, lots of V-2 firings and FireBee testing. \"I recall that my stepdad would fly to a missile impact and recover the many ping pong balls that were scattered on impact. There was a time when the U. S. Navy was testing a Talos missile and there were several unexplained failures. The techs who worked on the electronics swore they checked each missile several times prior to flight, but for a period of time, missiles would do 180-degree turns on themselves (like the Juarez, Mexico UFO incident) and crash. \"I recall several times at gatherings of adults as they talked shop, it was mentioned that UFOs had done it (caused the missiles to veer off course and crash). I remember once when the base went on alert because a missile went astray and crashed near the White Sands monument.\" [ Editor's Note: According to history written by the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, \"In July 1944, the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance requested Section T of the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) to study anti-aircraft missiles to counteract the Japanese Ohka piloted bombs and other suicide weapons sent against the United States in the Pacific. The requirement was for a missile to shoot down a plane at a range of 20,000 yards at an altitude of 30,000 feet.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Four months later by November 1944, the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance assigned the Applied Physics Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University in Silver Spring, Maryland, to undertake the development of radar-guided surface-to-air missiles. This project became known as Bumblebee which produced several ramjet-powered missiles which evolved from the 1945 STV to the 1951 Terrier to the 1958 Talos. Also see: Earthfiles 12/21/2005 and 4-part series Earthfiles 12/04/2004. O riginal full-scale replica of America's first surface-to-air missile, the Supersonic Test Vehicle (STV), called Bumblebee, or the \"Flying Stovepipe.\" Demonstration flight was on October 16, 1945, Island Beach, New Jersey, and reached 1400 mph. Produced by Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Baltimore, Maryland. Bendix SAM-N-6/IM-70/RIM-8 Talos - The Ta l o s long-range surface-to-air missile was the ultimate result of the U.S. Navy's Bumblebee program, which also led to the SAM-N-7/RIM-2 Te r r i e r and RIM-24 Ta r t a r missiles. Bumblebee was begun in 1944 with the goal to create a ramjet-powered anti-aircraft missile. The initial development was done by the Applied Physics Lab of the John Hopkins University, and APL started to fly the Cobra ramjet test vehicles in 1945, which eventually led to the larger PTV-N-4 BTV ( Burner Test Vehicle) in 1948. The Ta l o s was to have a primary beam-riding guidance system, and in 1948, supersonic beam-riding was demonstrated with the CTV-N-8 STV (Supersonic Test Vehicle). These tests proved very promising, and STV was actually developed into a tactical missile of its own, the SAM-N-7/RIM-2 Te r r i e r medium-range SAM. The final Ta l o s test vehicle was the RTV-N-6 XPM (Experimental Prototype Missile), which first flew successfully in 1951 as the RTV-N-6a3. By that time, the Ta l o s SAM had been assigned the designation SAM-N-6 by the Navy. The first full Ta l o s prototype (XSAM-N-6) flew in October 1952, and later that year, the first successful intercept was made by an RTV-N-6a4 test vehicle. Because the required missile performance was increased several times during development, the Ta l o s SAM did not become fully operational until 1959, almost a decade later than originally planned. Bendix became prime contractor for Ta l o s production. All Ta l o s variants had some surface-to-surface capab ility, although probably only the nuclear-tipped versions would have been really effective. In 1963, all variants of Ta l o s were redesignated in the RIM-8 series.] 14) V-2 Missile Crashes and UFOs \"My father was old for the draft, but none the less was drafted as a poor young man from Kansas with a highschool degree. After taking an aptitude test, he was sent to Rutgers University in New Jersey for a one-year crash course in engineering. My mom and newborn brother were living with a sister near New Jersey so to be close to my dad. An officer showed up one day and informed her that my dad had been reassigned and to stay put in New Jersey. She would receive his pay, but would not be able to know the nature of the assignment. She was not to be alarmed as she would receive no communication. \"At the same time, my dad was being loaded onto a train with blacked ou windows for a three-day journey that made several stops and picked up both civilians and military - each car was overseen by MPs (military police). The"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"trip ended about midnight as the passengers were offloaded onto buses with blacked out windows at a remote train station with all signs covered. The buses drove until morning where they unloaded at an encampment in pine mountains (Los Alamos). My dad was stationed at Los Alamos until the war ended and he was in the Corp of Engineers where he oversaw a workshop which built whatever the scientists requested. Most people did not know (and were not allowed to discuss) what other groups were doing. \"He was allowed to begin writing my mom after a couple of years. The letters at first had an Albuquerque Post Mark, but were highly censored. She was allowed to come to New Mexico near the end of the war and my mom and dad were allowed a few short afternoon supervised visits in a park in Santa Fe. \"After my dad was able to get his ME (mechanical engineering) license in Texas, in addition to commercial private sector work, he did consulting ME work for DOE, DOD, DOA, DON and many facilities, but especially at White Sands, Holloman AFB, Sandia Labs and the Navy Site (Naval Research Laboratory at White Sands). I do know he worked on mechanical systems for test facilities as well as basic HVAC for buildings. When he retired, he told me that at that time there was not a building or installation on WSMR that he had not had some involvement with. \"Through all this, my parents instilled in us a deep mistrust of our government at all levels, which I saw grow to almost a level of paranoia (especially in my mother) before they passed away. My conclusion can only be that they saw and knew firsthand the deceit of our government. \"When my dad would mention the V-2 crash in Juarez, Mexico, it was with disdain! As a kid we used to climb up to several plane crash sites on the Franklin Mountains above El Paso, if my memory serves, in the 1949 to 1951 era you spoke of. The crashes at the time were blamed on the weather, but even as a kid I would think, 'Why are they so low on the mountain?' F ranklin Mountains rise above El Paso, Texas. \"In the late 1970s, I lived near Anthony, New Mexico, with a clear view of Anthony Gap (a pass between), the Franklin Mountains and the Organ Mountains with White Sands Missile Range on the other side. There were many nights I watched with amazement as lights moved strangely through the air. My inquiries were answered as 'night training and testing of helicopters.' Then one morning at 2 a.m., I thought we were experiencing a 'close encounter' when everything lit up and started shaking. There was a deep beating feeling, but not a loud sound. A large black military helicopter barely missed my house and took a hard landing across the lane in an onion field. As I ran out, I was met with an order to go back into the house as there were already MPs in vehicles around it. By morning, it was gone. I still wonder what I was watching in the sky?\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"F ranklin Mountains in El Paso south of Fort Bliss Military Reservation, Alamogordo/Holloman AFB and White Sands Missile Range, known as White Sands Proving Ground in the 1940s to 1950s.
