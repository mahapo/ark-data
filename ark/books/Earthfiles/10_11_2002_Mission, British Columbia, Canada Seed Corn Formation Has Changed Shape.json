Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Mission, British Columbia, Canada Seed Corn Formation Changed Shape Before Harvest © 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe About an hour east of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada is the farming community of Mission where two pictograms in 9-foot-tall corn stalks were first reported on September 8, 2002. By September 30, the pattern with the long pathway had changed shape. October 11, 2002 Mission, British Columbia, Canada - The director of the Canadian Crop Circle Research Network (CCCRN), Paul Anderson, reports that one of the two pictograms discovered in seed corn in early September had dramatically changed shape by September 30. See prior Earthfiles report . That day local resident, Karen McInnes, called to tell Paul she had seen the new pattern from the nearby freeway. She had been looking ever since she saw and reported the first two patterns back on September 8, 2002. Paul contacted a pilot who agreed to fly on October 2 and take some photographs so we could see exactly what had changed. Paul writes, \"I just received copies of the newest aerial photos of the Mission #2 formation taken on October 2, 2002. I noticed that in each of the two new long pathways on either side (of original pattern), there is a dark 'line' going across their width at about the same spot in each; not sure what those are. The formation has significantly evolved from its previous appearance, as of at least September 22 when we were there\" to collect plant and soil samples for analysis by biophysicist W. C. Levengood. Strangely, no one else has contacted Paul or the farm owner, Bobby Braich, about the patterns on either side of the freeway. Mr. Braich says to his knowledge there has been no newspaper or other media report to date. Mr. Braich did not even know the pattern had been expanded upon. Nothing more is expected because the field was harvested last weekend. On left, latest aerial photograph of the evolving Mission, B.
