Frankly, we can’t believe this has happened. It’s something that we would not have dreamed would occur in a million years.” - C hula Family Farm, Lake Township, Ohio November 16, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Back in the 1970s, there were British reports of cattle that either disappeared from fenced pastures or entire herds were found in a neighbor's pasture, inexplicably transported during the night When animal mutilations occur, at the same time there are often missing animal reports that can range from small cats to large animals such as cattle and horses. One famous case occurred in Waurika, Oklahoma, in the mid-1990s. A rancher reported that 850 of his cows and 850 of his calves all disappeared one weekend without a trace of evidence. 1700 cattle missing! The case was never solved and the insurance company finally settled with the nearly-bankrupt family. O hio Beacon Journal , November 9, 2006, Akron, Ohio. Now again is a recent headline about disappearing animals. This time it’s five pregnant Hereford cows mysteriously gone from a barn on a Stark County, Ohio, small farm that only had eight cows. The owners at the Chula Family Farm discovered the missing five pregnant cows on Tuesday, November 7, 2006. June Chula said all the cows were fine at 6 p.m. the night before on November 6th. Three other cows were left behind on the farm, which the Chula family has operated for fifty years. After walking their fence line to look for breaks and not finding any, June Chula told the local newspaper: “We have no idea if someone stole them to butcher them or to sell at market. We’re puzzled and without a clue. Frankly, we can’t believe this has happened. It’s something that we would not have dreamed would occur in a million years.” June Chula went to neighbors asking if anyone had seen or heard anything unusual and everyone’s answer was ‘No.’ June wondered how anyone could get five pregnant cows out of her barn without a trailer, but there were no tire tracks, footprints or any other evidence that any intruder had entered the barn. The Chulas had never bothered to brand or tattoo their eight cows because it was not a professional herd and the family never thought any of them would disappear without a trace. The Chulas put up a sign in their pasture asking anyone with information about their missing Stark County, Ohio, pregnant cows to call them.

Four days later on November 11, 2006, the Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada Globe and Mail newspaper reported that law enforcement in the New Westminster Police Department are baffled by the discovery of three severed horse heads. Staff Sergeant "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Casey Dehaas said, “In my 27 years of policing in New Westminster, I have never heard of anyone dumping animal remains like that.” In this Vancouver case of severed horse heads, unlike the global phenomenon of missing and mutilated animals, the horse heads were found inside see-through plastic bags. Sergeant Dehaas dismissed the idea that the three heads were garbage from someone’s horse meat farm. The bagged horse heads were left near a well-traveled road by the Queen’s Park Ice Arena in Westminster where many people skate. Further, the police confirmed that their town does not have horse breeders and no one has reported missing horses. A Mutilated Horse Named Lady September 1967 L ady, in same San Luis Valley spot where she had been found dead and stripped of flesh from the neck up three weeks earlier in September 1967. Photograph © 1967 by Don Anderson. The first beheaded horse I learned about was the famous mutilation case in the San Luis Valley of Colorado that made worldwide headlines. The story began after sundown on Thursday, September 7, 1967. Rancher Harry King said good night to one of his family’s favorite horses, a female named Lady. He did not know that would be the last time he would see Lady alive. She was a healthy 3-year-old Appaloosa who belonged to Harry’s sister, Nellie, and her husband, Berle Lewis. Harry had good pasture land, so Lady grazed on his ranch eating the chico bush, sage and grass that grow in the San Luis Valley. Each evening, Lady went back to the ranch for water where her mother, Snippy, was corralled. But Lady did not show up on September 8, 1967. The next day, Harry King found Lady lying on her side near the edge of a small, flat clearing in the chico bush. Her body had been stripped of flesh from the neck up. The exposed skeleton was so white and clean it looked like it had lain in the sun for days. But Harry knew he had seen her alive and well only two nights before. The rest of Lady’s body was untouched. Harry told me in a phone interview in the 1980s: “That neck was cut so smooth it couldn’t have been done even with a sharp hunting knife.” On Sunday, September 10, 1967, Nellie and Berle Lewis arrived at Harry’s place to see the bizarre death. Nellie was shocked and agreed with Harry that Lady’s neck was not hacked off. It was very neat and that was what was so odd.” Berle Lewis said that when they searched the ground, Lady’s tracks stopped about 100 feet southeast of her body. “It looked like she jumped around in a circle,” Berle said. “But there was nothing else, no tracks of any kind between there and where we found her. It was clean all around her.” There were no tracks around Lady’s body, but forty feet south of her was a broken bush. “Around the bush,” said Berle, “was a three-foot-circle of six or eight holes in the ground about four inches across and three to four inches deep.”"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Late that summer there had been many reports in the San Luis Valley about strange lights in the sky and the story that soon made international headlines was headlined in The Pueblo Chieftain . T he newspaper had the wrong sex and name of the mutilated horse. The victim was a female Appaloosa named Lady. The Pueblo Chieftain , October 7, 1967, Pueblo, Colorado. At the time, John Altshuler, M. D., a doctor of pathology and hematology (now deceased), was working at Rose Medical Center in Denver. He wanted to see the horse for himself and drove to the San Luis Valley. Dr. Altshuler was willing to go on the record for the first time about what he found at the Lady mutilation site in my first book, An Alien Harvest published in 1989. Dr. Altshuler told me, “When I got close to the horse, I could see that it was also cut from the neck down to the base of the chest in a vertical, clean incision. “At the edge of the cut, there was a darkened color as if the flesh had been opened and cauterized with a surgical cauterizing blade. The outer edges of the cut skin were firm, almost as if they had been cauterized with a modern day laser. But there was no surgical laser technology like that in 1967. Today when we use cauterizing to control bleeding, the flesh still has a soft pliable feeling. But the edges of that horse cut were stiff, leathery and a bit hardened. I cut tissue samples from the hard, darker edge. Later, I viewed the tissue under a microscope. At the cell level, there was discoloration and destruction consistent with changes caused by burning. “Most amazing was the lack of blood. I have done hundreds of autopsies. You can’t cut into a body without getting some blood. But there was no blood on the skin or on the ground. No blood anywhere. That impressed me the most. “Then inside the horse’s chest, I remember the lack of organs. Whoever did the cutting took the horse’s heart, lungs, and thyroid. The mediasternum was completely empty – and dry. How do you get the heart out without blood?\" Canadian Horse Mutilations in 1967 That same fall season of 1967 that Lady was found dead and stripped of flesh from the neck up, there were similar bizarre horse deaths reported in Canada. On the Sarcee Reserve near Twin Bridges in Alberta, a dead hors was found where a witness claimed a “domed saucer craft” had been seen earlier that day. Then in early November, two horses were found dead near Livingston, Ontario, Canada. One had a long cut on its neck. The other had “its throat and jugular vein cut off, yet there was no evidence of blood.” That was November 6, 1967. The day before, near Livingston,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"a person reported seeing a large UFO. After it disappeared, a sulfurous odor remained in the air. Since that time, animal mutilations have haunted ranchers and law enforcement agencies throughout both hemispheres of our planet to this very day.
