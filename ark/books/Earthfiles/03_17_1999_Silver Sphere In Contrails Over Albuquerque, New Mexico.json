Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Silver Sphere In Contrails Over Albuquerque, New Mexico © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe March 17, 1999 - At the end of February 1999 when I was in Sedona, Arizona to speak at a conference, several of us went outside to go to lunch. But we were stopped cold by what was in the sky -- a large silver airplane at high altitude was making a perfect and very large white X in a very blue sky. The X stretched from the western horizon up to and past the zenith. A huge X. Then we realized there were other large Xs in the sky. And within a couple of hours, the sky was totally overcast. A couple of days later in Phoenix, I saw similar Xs in a blue sky that later became overcast. I got home the first week of March and was interviewed by KCMO radio in Kansas City, Missouri where I learned the Mike Murphy show had devoted its entire program on March 4th to callers describing odd contrail patterns they had seen in Kansas, Missouri and surrounding regions. After my interview, I received several dozen FAXes and phone calls from KCMO listeners, including this one from a Kansas City, Missouri resident (cab driver) who watched seven contrails forming at 8 a.m. CST on March 4th. Interviews: Kansas City, Missouri Cab Driver (preferred anonymity) : \"In fact, I even called Murphy's producer to tell him. I said, \"Hey, man, look outside! Look at this!\" And I'm not no nut or nothin', but this is too weird. There was one going from north to the south and it was very large. It took almost the entire radius of the sky. I mean, it went almost as far as the eye could see to the north and was going south. And it looked like it had just been laid or happened. And then it started to dispense a little from the inside going out. In other words, it was getting wider from east to west. And it started getting wider and wider. And then the next two or three minutes later, it may not have been that long, I saw one in the north sky, probably up -- on a clock -- say, up to 3 o'clock. And it was going from west to east. AND HOW MANY PLANES DID YOU SEE MAKING THIS? I didn't see -- a total of these lines -- I was driving and just kind of watching -- it looked like there were about 7 lines happening at once, to me. We'll just talk about yesterday (March 4) -- and again they did that. And then another one went in a more, from westerly direction going southeast, almost at an angle. It wasn't a direct cross and it wasn't like an X. It didn't seem like it was a real pattern except the lines always ended up crossing one another. And there were about 7 of them. LET ME ASK YOU ABOUT THE SEVEN LINES. COULD YOU ACTUALLY SEE AERIAL CRAFT MAKING THESE SEVEN LINES? On one. I could see it. It looked like it was pretty high up and something big. It's quite a way aways, so I don't think without binoculars or a telescope or "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"something you could really get a clear picture of it. I couldn't tell color or anything like that. I never pulled off the road as I was driving. I don't get into this stuff too much. I'm kind of a family guy, just do my thing. But this has blown my mind. SOMETHING IS HAPPENING. Something weird and I don't know what it is, but something's going on.\" Silver Sphere Over Albuquerque, New Mexico on March 16, 1999 I have talked with a couple of pilots who said some of the Xs might result from the normal crossing corridors of military and civilian air traffic. But that wouldn't explain the seemingly deliberate creation of the big X in Sedona by one plane. Then yesterday, March 16th, Matthew Duran who has lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico for 19 years, saw a silver ball move in a contrail and stop. I talked to Mr. Duran a few hours ago about his remarkable sighting at 11:40 AM on March 16th in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Matthew Duran, Resident, Albuquerque, New Mexico: \"And I just got away from my computer to get coffee when I happened to look out my east facing window. Actually, they are quite aways up, they're about 20 feet up from the floor of the living room. And I noticed there was a set of contrails and an airplane leaving a new set parallel and not very far from the other. So, I grabbed my binoculars which were handy and looked up at the plane and watched it finish making the contrails as far as the view of my window was concerned. And then I noticed a small silver ball, or sphere, moving around in the contrails. I watched it for appx. Six to seven seconds moving in the contrails. And then it turned out of the contrail, went between the two sets of contrails so it's just like a small space of blue sky between the two sets of contrails. And it just stayed stationary for appx. Anywhere four to six or seven minutes. NOW, COULD YOU SEE IT MORE CLEARLY THROUGH THE BINOCULARS? Yeah, that's the funny part. It wasn't visible at all without the binoculars. You could not see it. I looked away for just a moment in that general direction and I could not see it with the naked eye. AND WHEN YOU LOOKED THROUGH THE BINOCULARS, WHAT EXACTLY WERE YOU SEEING? A fairly small silver sphere in relation to the size of the airplane that I watched making the contrail. It was significantly smaller. AND WHEN YOU SAY SPHERE, DO YOU MEAN ROUND, OR DISC SHAPED? It was perfectly round. AND IT WAS UNMOVING? Like I said, it was moving in the contrail and then it moved out between the two sets of contrails and stayed stationary for the remainder of the time I saw it. And then anywhere between four or six or seven minutes, whatever it was, it shot straight up and it was gone. In just an instant, it accelerated unbelievably. DID THE PLANE ITSELF SEEM TO HAVE ANY MOTION AS IF IT WERE AWARE OF THE PRESENCE OF THIS OBJECT? Oh, not at all. It was well out of my view when I noticed the sphere. SO, WOULD YOUR GENERAL IMPRESSION BE WHAT -- OF THIS SPHERE BEING THERE? Well, I've never seen anything like it. I don't think we have any aircraft that look like that, so I'd have to classify it as unidentified. AND THEN THE QUESTION IS: ARE THESE SPHERES IN THE"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"PROCESS OF MONITORING OR ARE THEY SOMEHOW INVOLVED? I was wondering that and mentioned it in my e-mail to Art -- that perhaps they, whoever controls these spheres, is perhaps taking an interest in what these contrails are for. CAN YOU DESCRIBE FURTHER WHY THE CONTRAILS THEMSELVES GRABBED YOUR ATTENTION? Well, I have lived here in New Mexico my whole life. You get used to this big, blue sky. These contrails are not normal. They linger far too long and spread out and they tend to cloud over the entire sky eventually. Usually in the last three months, I've noticed it more, seems more prevalent. I've actually watched them start at 8 in the morning and they continue all day and by the time they are done, the sky is usually pretty clouded over. And they don't look right either. Like I said, they linger far too long. And in one particular instance -- I was at a soccer tournament with one of my boys -- and I looked up at the sun and through the contrails that were spreading out, you could see like an oily -- it looked like an oily ring -- it just didn't look right. I pointed it out to my wife and she said basically the same thing. \"That doesn't look right.\" You know how oil looks when it's on water? Kind of an iridescent quality to it. That looked very similar. NOW, DID YOU MEAN THAT YOU HAVE WATCHED THE SAME PLANE MAKE CONTRAILS FROM 8 O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THROUGHOUT THE DAY? Oh, several planes -- more than one. BUT IT WASN'T LIKE NORMAL MILITARY OR CIVILIAN TRAFFIC THAT WOULD BE CROSSING IN THE SKY? I wouldn't consider it, no. One of the reasons for it is you see the contrails start on the west end of Albuquerque and they end right over the mountain range on the east. They always cut it off right there. They don't continue past the mountains. AND SO WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING ARE CONTRAILS EXTENDING FROM ONE HORIZON NEARLY TO THE OTHER HORIZON? Yes, precisely. AND HAVE YOU SEEN THE LARGE X PATTERNS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN SO MANY STATES? As a matter of fact, yesterday. There were several of them. SO SOME OF THE CONTRAILS YOU SAW ASSOCIATED WITH THAT SILVER DISC WERE THE X SHAPED PATTERNS? Yes. The two that I saw while looking at the sphere were parallel to one another. They weren't X-shaped. I saw the X-shaped one later in the afternoon. After seeing that (sphere), I was pretty much watching the skies for the remainder of the afternoon. HAVE YOU CALLED ANYONE IN THE MILITARY OR AT AIRPORTS TO ASK ABOUT THE CONTRAIL FORMATIONS? No, I haven't. And that's something that -- having Kirtland AFB and Sandia Laboratories right here in the city -- I'm not so sure I'd get an answer anyway. I THINK IT WOULD BE WORTH TRYING. IT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I'M GOING TO TRY TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE IN THE RADIO AUDIENCE TO CALL AIRPORTS, CALL VARIOUS MILITARY INSTALLATIONS AND ASK IF THEY HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT WHO OR WHAT ARE MAKING ALL OF THESE CONTRAILS? I'd be willing to try that, I suppose. Now, I've seen contrails before, but these just don't look right. There is just an odd quality about them. The fact they don't dissipate. Being as arid as this place is, usually they dissipate very quickly.\" Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
