Clarkson, 58, now retired from theAberdeen, Washington, Police Department, currently investigator for Washington Stateagencies in the field of administrative law and Chief Investigator for Washington StateMUFON, continues with excerpts from his June 27, 1997, recorded interview with JuneCrain Kaba at her Ocean Shores, Washington, home before her death on August 23, 1998.December 1, 2009 Letter from James Clarkson about June Crain's assertionthat she had both a SECRET clearance (see Part 1) and a TOP SECRET Qclearance under authority of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC): “Theinvestigation of the June Crain story is a work in progress. There are aspectsof what she disclosed versus the documents I have obtained thus far that haveraised the question of exactly what security clearances she possessed. Thedocuments she supplied and the documents obtained from the PersonnelRecords Center verify June Crain held at least a Secret clearance.While describing her duties at WPAFB, she stated she had a Q clearance. Thisclaim is not yet verified. However, June knew about Project Caucasian (belowin this Part 3) many years before the project was declassified and the publiclearned it was a code name for the development of a parachute and harnesssystem for a hydrogen bomb weighing 50,000 pounds six feet in diameter and20 feet long. The goal was to delay the bomb’s fall long enough for thedelivery aircraft to escape the blast zone. Given the realities of the Cold War,this project would be highly classified.The Q clearance could be issued for many reasons and most probably, therequirements have changed over time. My father had a Q clearance when heworked at the second uranium fuel plant in the US located in Paducah,Kentucky, as a control room operator. My grandfather had fun actingmysterious when his neighbors in a small Kentucky town asked him why theFBI had been to visit asking questions about my father. The point is hisdescription: he said the original Q clearance was a cardboard on which a largeletter Q was printed that had to be worn at all times while performing work ina classified area.It should be pointed out that one of June’s Job Description documents datedFebruary 2, 1951, includes the following: ‘Under general supervision of theBranch Stenographer sets up and maintains files...memorandum reports,accident reports, and other reports pertaining to cargo parachutes... Searchesfiles for information requested by project engineers.” Her assignment was HQAir Materiel Command, Area B, Engineering Division Equipment Laboratory,Parachute Branch Cargo Unit. Presumably, this would by necessity haveinvolved highly classified information.Another major point needs to be made: I have not claimed every singlestatement made by June Crain about her work history at WPAFB, made in1997, some 45-50 years of life experience later, is absolutely correct.However, given the available documents in combination with her statements,there is enough available information to rightfully claim she knew what theinsiders talked about – the reality of repeated UFO sightings during the testingof the Aerobee rockets in the deserts of New Mexico, the security methodsemployed to ferret out details of these sightings while at the same timediscouraging further reports and discussion, the reality of recovered crashedUFOs, and finally, the existence of the memory metal described by someoneas ‘a piece of a spaceship.’"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Obviously, it would have been ideal if I had been able to repeatedly interviewJune and hopefully get the exact names of the personnel involved. It did nothappen because I met June while I was working full-time as a DetectiveSergeant for the Aberdeen, Washington, Police Department. I thought therewould be more time, but sadly, there wasn’t. However, even if June’s detailswere not 100 percent correct, or if they cannot be fully verified, her testimonyoffers a fascinating view of what the secret-keepers do not want us to know.”By James E.

Clarkson, former Detective Sergeant in Aberdeen, Washington, PoliceDepartment; investigator for Washington State Agencies and Chief Investigator,MUFON-Washington State, Olympia, Washington: “June told me some anecdotesabout working at Wright Field (later to become Wright-Patterson AFB) not directly relatedto UFOs. And she described to me that she had what she called a ‘Top Security’ clearance.She specified more definitely that she had a Q clearance and that she ended up working forthe Air Materiel Command (AMC). Then to put it into perspective, June Crain wasworking on things that we would take for granted now, but at the time were classifiedresearch such as high-altitude balloons, the airplane ejection seat and the gun site aperturecamera. She also assisted in research for the Aerobee Rocket, which I think was one of ourfirst successful rockets developed from the German V-2. It was known as a ‘heavy lifter.’On June 26, 1948, two rockets, a V-2 and an Aerobee,were launched from White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico.The V-2 attained 60.3 miles, while the Aerobee attained 70 miles altitude.Photo of Aerobee Hi Missile, White Sands Missile Range Museum.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “The Aerobee rocket was a small (8 meters),unguided, suborbital sounding rocket used in U. S. high atmospheric andcosmic radiation research between 1947 and 1958. It was built by AerojetGeneral, a company that began Aerobee research in 1946 and test fired thefirst complete Aerobee from the White Sands Proving Grounds, New Mexico,on November 24, 1947. That Aerobee reached an altitude of 34.7 miles(56 km). The rocket was two stage with a solid-fuel boost and a nitricacid/aniline sustainer. The Aerobee could take a 68 kg payload to an altitudeof 130 km. The Aerobee rockets could reach around 230 km (a later variantexceeded 400 km), instrumentation usually provided constant telemetry andwas recovered by parachute. Launch towers were built at White Sands MissileRange, Fort Churchill, Wallops Island, Va., and aboard the research ship, USSNorton Sound. The last Aerobee flight was in 1958, after some 165 (includingvariants) had been successfully fired.]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"June went on at great length telling me that as part of her duties, she was actually presentwhen experiments were done dropping heavy payloads by parachutes, including somemisadventures where things fell where they weren’t supposed to fall at Wright Field, Ohio. Project Caucasian: Classified Parachute Researchby German Physicist Theodore W. KnackeJune kept telling me that because she worked in this place where they were experimentingwith parachutes that there was a man named Mr. Knacke. The way June described him isthat he wrote the Bible for parachutes. He was another one, as June put it, ‘stolen out ofGermany after WWII.’Well, the interesting thing is that I eventually learned that there was a man namedTheodore Knacke, T. W. Knacke, who was a very highly respected scientist and engineerbasically described as the parachute engineer’s engineer. His work is the basis for therecovery parachutes for space capsules any heavy payloads that have to come out of theatmosphere and be slowed down with a parachute device.SO HE WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY INVOLVED WITH PROJECT MOGUL?June did not give me that, but that’s another possibility.U. S. Air Force 1947 - 1949 Project Mogul balloon testsphotograph from TopFoto.co.uk.[ Editor's Note: Project Mogul (Operation Mogul) was a TOP SECRETproject by the U.S. Army Air Forces involving high altitude balloons, whoseprimary purpose was long-distance detection of sound waves generated bySoviet atomic bomb tests. The project was carried out from 1947 until early1949. The project was moderately successful, but was very expensive and wassuperseded by a network of seismic detectors and air sampling for falloutwhich were cheaper, more reliable, and easier to deploy and operate.]IF PROJECT MOGUL WAS ONE OF OUR MOST CLASSIFIED EXPERIMENTAL SPYOPERATIONS IN 1947 ONWARD – THE WORLD DIDN’T KNOW ABOUT PROJECTMOGUL BACK THEN, BUT WE WERE USING THESE HIGH ALTITUDEBALLOONS TO SPY ON OUR PERCEIVED ENEMIES.Exactly. Speaking of highly classified – June made reference to Project Caucasian. Thatwas a really mysterious one because at the time, no matter whom I talked to, nobody knewanything about Project Caucasian. It wasn’t on the internet. It wasn’t in any books.Nobody knew what it was.[ Editor’s Note: Project Caucasian - See PDF U.S. Cold War at:http://www.uscoldwar.com/hindenburg/Hindenbg_5_6.pdfPDF Excerpt: When a tentative 50,000 lb., six-foot diameter,20-foot long hydrogen bomb size was established in 1951, LASLadvocated that the Air Force conduct drop tests using a drogueparachute to slow the falling bomb and allow the delivery aircraftmore time to escape the blast. An immediaterequirement was the development of a large parachute to support50,000 lbs. dropped at release speeds in excess of 300 knots (345"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"MPH) at altitudes between 35,000 and 45,000 feet.The Air Force program that assisted this effort was known asProject Caucasian. Caucasian had seven subtasks, including themodification of four B-36H aircraft as prototype bomb carriers; themodification and redesign of the B-2 bomb lift to carry a 50,000 lb.load; development of a series of drogue parachutes to decelerateand stabilize the falling bomb; and development of practice dropshapes. 81952: The First Full-Scale Test and Weapon Design BeginsThe design of the first full-scale test device embodying the “threeconcepts” proceeded rapidly during 1951 and 1952, and by the fallof 1952, was ready for testing at Eniwetok atoll in the MarshallIslands. The test device, named the Sausage for its long cylindricalshape, was 80inches in diameter and just over 20 feet long; it weighed 82 tons.Most of this weight was contained in a massive foot-thick outersteel casing which enclosed the device’s primary (a TX-5 unboostedfission bomb), and a complex cryogenic liquid-fueled secondarywith a tritium gasboosted plutonium “sparkplug.”At the time of its detonation, the Sausage was the largest and mostcomplex cryogenic device in the world. An irony of its design wasthat in order to attain the highest temperature ever achieved onearth, the deuterium in the device had to be chilled to near absolutezero, the lowest temperature on earth.The test of the device during the Operation IVY Mike shot onNovember 1, 1952 was successful. Even before the test, design ofthe first solid-fueled hydrogen bombs -- the Alarm Clock, Zombie,Runt, and Shrimp -- had begun at LASL. These devices later becameprototype weapons named TX-14, TX-15, TX-17, and TX-21,respectively.As work proceeded on this second generation of hydrogenweapons, the Department of Defense (DOD) began studying likelydelivery systems. The ConVAir B-36 Peacemaker, the largest bomberthen in the U.S. Air Force inventory, was the most obvious deliveryvehicle for the Hbomb:On June 30, 1948, a B-36 had dropped 72,000 lbs. of conventionalbombs during a test flight. The B-36B could carry 86,000 lbs.,including conventional high explosive bombs weighing up to43,000 lbs. and measuring 364 inches long and 54 inches indiameter, the size ofthe American variants of a World War II British Grand Slam bomb.Availability of the first stockpile hydrogen weapon, the TX-14Alarm Clock, was assured by the end of 1953. This bomb wasequipped with a 64-foot diameter drogue parachute. The Air Forceinstituted Project Caucasian, using two B-36Hs, to make aircraft andbombing equipmentmodifications to carry the TX-14 in the B-36. The Air Force’sStrategic Air Command (SAC) authorized a “1A” priority for thisprogram. 9At a conference at Wright Field in July 1952, attended byrepresentatives of the Air Force, ConVAir, Sandia Laboratories,and LASL, an agreement was reached to “freeze” maximum bombdiameter to 62.5 inches and to limit its weight to 25 tons. Thismonster was to be ...8 The Development of Thermonuclear Weapon Delivery Techniques: Project CAUCASIAN,pp. 2, 5, 6, 11.9 A History of the Air Force Atomic Energy Program, 1943 - 1953, Lee Bowen and RobertD.Little, et. al., 1959, Vol. IV, The Development of Weapons, p. 209. Well, it turns out that not until 2007 was Project Caucasian declassified. Now I can readabout it and see how it was absolutely in keeping with the work that June did at Wright-Patterson. So, not declassified before 2007, but June told me ten years earlier in 1997about Project Caucasian, a research project at Wright-Patterson for Los Alamos"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"laboratories in New Mexico on how to slow down the descent of an H-bomb dropped fromthe belly of a B-36 bomber. At the time, that was the backbone of our strategic strikeforce. So, they needed to develop a parachute that could slow down a payload that wasthat heavy and that large.So, when June said that Project Caucasian was so sensitive that every time it gotmentioned, her boss would kind of flinch, she was 100% correct.THE CHALLENGE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO SLOW DOWN A LARGE HYDROGENBOMB BECAUSE THE CREW AND AIRPLANE WOULD HAVE TO GET AWAYBEFORE THE BOMB EXPLODED.Exactly! In fact, it was a 6,000-pound payload, 6 feet in diameter, 20 feet long, and theidea was to drop it at a release speed of 345 mph from 35,000 to 45,000 feet altitude. Sothere is quite a lot of technology that would go into slowing the bomb down.THE GERMAN PHYSICIST, THEODORE KNACKE, WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONEPERSON WRIGHT FIELD DEPENDED UPON TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM.Ye s .AND JUNE KNEW ABOUT HIM AND HIS WORK. SHE KNEW ABOUT PROJECTCAUCASIAN, WHICH YOU HAVE JUST SAID WAS NEVER RELEASED UNTILAROUND 2007. THAT MEANS THAT IN THOSE TWO CATEGORIES OF YOURINTERVIEW, JUNE WAS CORRECT. TIME PROVED THAT. SO, IF SHE WASCORRECT ABOUT THOSE FACTS, THAT IMPLIES SHE WAS TELLING THE TRUTHABOUT ROSWELL, WHITE SANDS AND WRIGHT FIELD.Ye s , it d o e s .DO YOU THINK WE ARE EVER GOING TO GET AN HONEST GOVERNMENTPRESS CONFERENCE TO LET US KNOW WE ARE NOT ALONE IN THEUNIVERSE AND THAT THE HISTORY OF ROSWELL AND OTHER CRASH SITESAND LANDINGS ARE BY INTELLIGENCES THAT ARE NOT HUMAN?I guess I’m optimistic and pessimistic at the same time, which is hedging, but I sort ofbelieve that every time we are told another lie or there is more censorship that in someways that creates the seeds of its own destruction. USAF Lied About Crash-Test DummiesIn the case of June Crain, had it not been for the propaganda coverage by CNN telling usthat Roswell 1947 had to be Project Mogul and that we dropped a few wooden dummies inthe desert that someone misperceived as aliens (non-humans) – if the USAF and CNNhadn’t laid it on so thick with such a lie, I’m not sure that June would have come forward.So, the authorities’ efforts to make us all think there was nothing to Roswell, nothing toany of this, completely backfired because as a result of their efforts at censorship, you andI are having this conversation about June Crain at Wright Field in 1942 to 1952.WE NOW KNOW THERE WERE NO WOODEN DUMMIES DROPPED IN THEROSWELL VICINITY ANYWHERE UNTIL 1955.Yes, and I know that firsthand because I talked to Raymond Madsen this last year inpreparation for the presentation in Las Vegas. He was a Lt. Col. when he retired. As ayoung officer, he was in charge of that research project of dropping dummies from highaltitudes. There were two types of dummies: one type was an inarticulated dummy; theother was an articulated dummy. In other words, one had flexible joints and one did not.The USAF's goal was to do experiments on how best a flier could survive coming downfrom a great altitude. Raymond Madsen felt his original research was not quoted properlyand he especially felt that after it was included in the USAF Roswell: Case Closed. Henever intended for his work to be used that way. He resented being misquoted and how hiswork was used as misinformation in the USAF's Roswell: Case Closed.THE ARROGANCE OF AUTHORITIES WHO WOULD EVEN TRY TO USE 1955WOODEN DUMMIES TO COVER-UP 1947 ROSWELL UFO CRASH EVENTS,KNOWING THE DUMMIES WERE NOT USED UNTIL 1955.Exactly! I guess none of us are supposed to be able to look at history.[ Editor's Note: Majestic Documents.com writes about the USAF 1955crash-test dummy experiments:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Air Force, General Accounting Office, MogulBalloonsand Crash-Test DummiesAs evidence that the controversy surrounding the so-calledRoswell Incident refuses to roll over and die, in the 1990s theAir Force published two investigative reports pertaining to theevents of July 1947. The following is taken from the AirForce’s press release on the first report published in 1994 inresponse to an inquiry launched by the General AccountingOffice — the investigative arm of Congress. The GAO’s inquirycame as a direct result of questions initiated by the late NewMexican Representative, Steven Schiff. According to the AirForce’s massive, near-1000 page report (The Roswell Report:Fact vs. Fiction in the New Mexico Desert, 1994) the debrisfound at Roswell was most likely from a Mogul balloon — aTop Secret Army-Air-Force device designed to assist the U.S.military in detecting evidence of nuclear tests by the Soviets.But what of the reports of alien bodies? In 1997, the Air Forceexpanded on this aspect of the Roswell affair in a documenttitled The Roswell Report: Case Closed:This report discusses the results of this exhaustive researchand identifies the likely sources of the claims of \"alien bodies\"at Roswell. Contrary to allegations, many of the accountsappear to be descriptions of unclassified and widely publicizedAir Force scientific achievements. Other descriptions of\"bodies\" appear to be actual incidents in which Air Forcemembers were killed or injured in the line of duty.The conclusions are: Air Force activities which occurred over aperiod of many years have been consolidated and are nowrepresented to have occurred in two or three days in July1947.\"Aliens\" observed in the New Mexico desert wereactually anthropomorphic test dummies that were carriedaloft by U.S. Air Force high altitude balloons for scientificresearch.The \"unusual\" military activities in the New Mexico desertwere high altitude research balloon launch and recoveryoperations. Reports of military units that always seemed toarrive shortly after the crash of a flying saucer to retrieve thesaucer and \"crew,\" were actually accurate descriptions of AirForce personnel engaged in anthropomorphic dummyrecovery operations.Claims of \"alien bodies\" at the Roswell Army Air Field hospitalwere most likely a combination of two separate incidents:1) a 1956 KC-97 aircraft accident in which 11 Air Forcemembers lost their lives; and,2) a 1959 manned balloon mishap in which two Air Forcepilots were injured. This report is based on thoroughlydocumented research supported by official records, technicalreports, film footage, photographs, and interviews withindividuals who were involved in these events.Despite the Air Force’s attempts to diffuse the controversysurrounding the Roswell events of 1947 and preempt theGAO’s findings, it is significant to note several key factors.First, Mogul balloons possessed no unusual characteristicssuch as those described by the witnesses to the event.Second, the crash-test dummy experiments that the Air Forceasserts led to the legends of alien bodies being recoveredwere not initiated until the 1950s. Third, during the course ofits investigation, the GAO learned that all of theadministrative records of Roswell Army Air Field from March1945 until December 1949 and all outgoing messages fromthe base from October 1946 to December 1949 had beeninexplicably destroyed. June Crain and Dr. Wernher von BraunJune told me something that was absolutely fascinating. She was adamant that she hadpersonally taken dictation from Dr. Wernher von Braun and that he had the coldest eyesshe had ever seen."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"German physicist, Wernher von Braun, in his newNASA headquarters office, 1970. On March 1, 1970, von Braunrelocated to Washington, D. C. to be Deputy Associate Administratorfor Planning at NASA Headquarters until May 26, 1972, when he and NASAparted ways after the end of the Apollo program and many conflicts aboutthe direction U. S. space flight projects should go. Image by NASA.June said she took dictation in a Wright Field office from Dr. Wernher von Braun under avery high security setting, apparently at night. An officer came to her and she recalled thathe was wearing a sidearm, took her to a still-more secure area at Wright Field and said thatshe needed to take dictation. June said she was asked to take the dictation because she wasvery efficient. She took a great deal of pride in her ability to take down what she called‘highly technical words.’Then there is this part of the story that is a big insight into June Crain and how she feltabout her life’s work. There were at least two or three times that she told me about thisdictation event and every time she described it, she started crying. And she said that thisofficer told her in reference to her work that night that if they got the $600,000 that theywere supposed to get as a budgetary allotment as a result of this (von Braun) report andothers, she would have had ‘her moment in history,’ is the way she recalled this becausethis was going to be seed money for the United States space program.She was very proud of her work at Wright Field, Ohio, and this was part of her dilemma asto why she didn’t talk about it for so many years and why she wanted to keep it a secret.The other part of her dilemma was that she as a woman had to make a decision betweenher professional career and following her husband when he got out of the U. S. Air Force.She chose to go with her husband and to raise her son and ended up in Portland, Oregon.But she told me that Wright Field wanted her to stay in the employment and had shestayed, she believed she would have ended up working for NASA.DO YOU KNOW THE DATE OF THE DICTATION WITH WERNHER VON BRAUN?No, I don’t. June gave me one of Wernher von Braun’s biographies and pointed out to me"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"that she had been over that book at length and could not find any reference to Dr. vonBraun ever being at Wright Field. I tried to run down the same thing with other sourcesand I had no luck either. But I do wonder if this interview/dictation might have been aspecial assignment when Dr. von Braun was brought to Wright Field for some specificreason? Or maybe it was early on in his time in the United States?WERNHER VON BRAUN WAS BROUGHT TO THE UNITED STATES IN PROJECTPAPER CLIP AFTER WORLD WAR II.

THE TIME LINE WOULD HAVE BEEN FROM 1945 ONWARDAND THE LAST SEVEN YEARS OF HER BEING AT WRIGHT FIELD FROM 1945 TO1952. IT’S LOGICAL THAT SOMEONE LIKE WERNHER VON BRAUN WOULDHAVE VISITED WRIGHT FIELD, EVENTUALLY TO BE CALLED WRIGHT-PATTERSON, TO TALK WITH MILITARY PEOPLE THERE.Yes, it would have been probable. But perhaps it was classified. Perhaps he was notcomfortable talking about that part of his life here. Or perhaps this was not what heconsidered to be a key event in his career.PROBABLY MORE LIKELY THAT IT WAS SO HIGHLY CLASSIFIED AND LINKEDTO A LARGE SUM OF MONEY TO GET A SPACE PROJECT GOING THAT THEDICTATION SESSION WAS TO BE CLASSIFIED AND OFF THE RECORD ALWAYS.Ye s .DID JUNE CRAIN TALK ANY MORE DETAILS ABOUT WERNHER VON BRAUN?The other thing she mentioned in this interview was that she was shown no considerationbecause she had to do the dictation standing up. She made a big point of that when she wastalking to me about it that they didn’t let her sit down. She thought that this man was veryrude and inconsiderate.WHY DID SHE HAVE TO STAND UP?Because there was no place to sit. I presume that he got to sit down at his desk and shedidn’t. I sort of felt overall that his was probably part of another larger issue in howwomen in the work force were considered and treated at that time.RIGHT, SO SHE STOOD UP TAKING DICTATION FROM WERNHER VON BRAUNABOUT WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN HIS INPUT TO NAILING A $600,000BUDGETARY ITEM FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE AMERICAN SPACEPROGRAM.Correct. When Will Truth Prevail?WHERE DO YOU THINK ALL OF THIS IS GOING TO END UP IN TERMS OF THETRUTH ULTIMATELY TRUMPING ALL THE LIES?Well, one thing that could happen is that someone might actually come forward with someof this ‘memory metal’ that could establish a provenance where we could say, ‘This isextraordinary metal and it originally came from a crash site.’There could also be some overwhelming event that occurs that gets everybody’s attention.That’s the White House lawn scenario. Or, someone could make enough mistakes overtime that we’re able to put it all together. In other words, the authorities might make thewrong person angry and provoke them to come forward and give us testimony that is evenmore damning than what we’ve already gotten from many of the key witnesses."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"IF YOU WERE GUESSING, WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN TO FINALLYLEVERAGE THE TRUTH FROM THE GOVERNMENTS?Unfortunately, I’m thinking that it might take an overwhelmingly blatant incident. Thereason I say that is that we now have so many of the governments in other countriescoming forward and supposedly opening at least part of their UFO files.” Return to Part 1More Information:See James Clarkson's entire interview with June Crain Caba at: Majestic-12 Documents, http://www.majesticdocuments.comFor further information about UFO crashes, Roswell, Wright Field and Wright-PattersonAFB, please see Earthfiles Archive (partial list below):• 09/07/2008 — Part 3: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 08/27/2008 — Part 1: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 08/12/2008 — Part 2: Rise of Fourth Reich -Where Is the Nazi “Die Glocke?”• 08/09/2008 — Part 5: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo, Project JEHOVAH andPhysicists Oppenheimer and Einstein• 08/06/2008 — Updated - Part 3: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo Links Government UFOCover-Up and JFK Assassination• 08/06/2008 — Part 4: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo Links Government UFO Cover-Upand JFK Assassination• 07/28/2006 — 1940s USAF Flight Surgeon's Account of E.
