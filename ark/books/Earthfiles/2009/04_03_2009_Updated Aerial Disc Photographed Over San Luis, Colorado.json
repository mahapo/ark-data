Updated: April 3, 2009 San Luis, Colorado - On March 27, 2009, after my 4-partEarthfiles report was posted about the three, bloodless, cattle mutilations in the Weston toTrinidad to Walsenburg region of southern Colorado, I received the following email andphoto (with two enlargements) wondering if the unidentified aerial object seen andphotographed over San Luis, Colorado, was similar to the round, silver, aerial craft thatMike Duran saw in February 2009, near Cokedale, about three weeks before his cowmutilation was discovered on March 8. See: 032009 Earthfiles.The photographer is Susan Sanderford, 52, born and raised in Shelbyville, Tennessee, untilshe was 20-years-old. Then Susan went to Emmaus Bible College between Chicago andDes Moines, Iowa, where she met her first husband. Later she remarried and lived inSedona, Arizona, before moving about three years ago to San Luis, Colorado, to work withher current husband in the development of a spiritual center in which she can help otherswith her intuitive medium gift that connects the living with loved ones who have passedover for emotional, mental and physical healing."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"It was in that context that her family and friends in San Luis on September 18, 2008,between 11 AM and about 2 PM were erecting a wooden totem of Mother Mary whenSusan took a series of photographs that included one image that contained an unidentified,round aerial object that seems to emanate golden light below it.Subject: UFOs and San Luis Valley Cattle MutilationsDate: March 27, 2009To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“Hi Linda,I live in the San Luis Valley in the little town of San Luis, Colorado, on thewest side of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, 60 miles from Walsenburg.

But the size ofthe round or oval shaped object in Susan's original photo looks pretty much the same as thesize of what I saw.”Mike Duran's cow was found bloodlessly mutilated on March 8, 2009, about three weeksafter he saw the round, silver aerial object near Cokedale.Parts 1 - 4: Unusual Animal Deaths in Southern Colorado.

Interview:Susan Sanderford,San Luis, Colorado.Susan Sanderford, Spiritual Intuitive Medium, Casa de Santa Maria, San Luis,Colorado: “We had purchased a 10.5 foot tall totem pole carving of Mother Mary to beinstalled in the center of the prayer and meditation garden we’re building out in San Luis.After waiting for 2.5 years to have the statue carved, it finally arrived and on September18, 2008, we were raising the statue that day, putting it in the ground. We had probablyabout eight people there helping us. Interestingly enough, I had the thought the day before‘Wouldn’t it be fun if the extraterrestrials that make the circles in England show up andwatch us put the Mother Mary carving in the ground.’ Just a fleeting thought."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Carved wooden Mother Mary statue erected in the Casa de Santa Mariatotem site 5 miles south of San Luis, Colorado, on September 18, 2008.

Image © 2008 by Susan Sanderford.We were probably there around 11 AM, the statue got there, the hole was dug. Working onit around 1 PM, as I am holding the hose with water coming out, I looked up in the sky andabout a half-mile to the north and then a half-mile off the ground, there set this oval craftwith sunlight shining off it. The sun was at such an angle that the sunlight was shining offthe object really brilliantly, but I could tell it was an oval craft and I looked at it andthought, ‘Oh, that’s interesting!’I put the hose down and looked back up to get a closer look and it was gone. I said to therest of the people who didn't see it, ‘Oh, I just saw a UFO.’ It didn’t bother me, but I gotthis really strong intuitive impression that They were watching us.WHAT DID YOU SEE IN THAT QUICK GLANCE?I saw a round, oval craft that looked silver on the bottom and really brilliantly white on thetop because of the direction the sun was shining off of it. The aircraft was not moving. Itwas just sitting there.I was trying to process in my mind – ‘Could this be a plane?’ But thinking, ‘Planes don’tfly that low and I don’t hear any noise.’ That’s when I put the hose down and looked backup and the craft had disappeared.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?We went on with installing our statue. No one else besides me saw it. We took a lot ofphotographs of the Mary statue after she was embedded in the ground. It was not until twodays later that I’m looking at the photographs and noticed the white dot in the backgroundsky. As I zoomed in on the dot, I realized we had captured a photo of – I don’t know if itwas the same object or another one – but I was facing south taking the photo, so it wassouth of us and probably had to be a mile away and maybe not more than a few hundredfeet off of the horizon.When I looked at it, I was shocked and went to get my husband. I said, ‘Look! There is theobject I saw. This is exactly what it looked like.’ So, somehow we captured the object on aphotograph without even knowing it was in the camera lens when we took the photograph!I’M LOOKING AT YOUR PHOTOGRAPH NOW. WOULD YOU SAY THIS APPEARSTO HAVE A DARK CENTER ON THE BOTTOM?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yes, it’s as if the sun shining on it is making it darker like a shadow. I blew up thephotograph and it looks like there is some energy that showed up underneath the oval craft– kind of a golden color, which I thought was really interesting. In the photograph, you cantell it’s just sitting there not moving.HOW MANY PHOTOGRAPHS DID YOU TAKE OF YOUR NEWLY ERECTEDTOTUM?I took a whole bunch of them and that was the only photograph it showed up in.ONE OUT OF HOW MANY PHOTOS?I think we took about 20 to 25 pictures. And it was the only one I took of a direct facingtoward the totem statue. The others were people doing things, but interestingly enough,there is a pink energy light coming from the corner down right onto the statue. My intuitivefeeling, Linda, was that They were watching what we were doing. Here's the specs for mycamera which captured the UFO:HP Photosmart R7427.0 Megapixels5.9mm - 17.7 mm zoom — zoom not usedWHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PHOTO, WHAT INTUITIVELY COMES TO YOUR MINDABOUT WHAT IS INSIDE OF THE OVAL OBJECT?My intuitive sense is they were off-world beings because mentally, I asked them to showup. So, to me that means whoever was in that craft had an extremely powerful connectionto intuition – or telepathic thought communication – that I sent that message and theyshowed up.I can’t get a sense of a benevolent or malevolent presence – just the strong overwhelmingfeeling that They were from off-world and just watching, curious about what we weredoing raising that carved Mary statue. I do get a strong sense that they were off-world andnot any military experiment. I really felt what ever was in that round craft wereoff-world.” If any one else in the San Luis, Weston, Trinidad, Hoehne and Walsenburg region has seenany unusual aerial craft recently, please email me: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
