Updated March 16 of original report March 14, 2009 Perris, California - A year agoon May 14, 2008, at 3 AM Pacific south of Needles, California, on the Colorado Rivernear Topock, Arizona, a long-time houseboat resident calling himself River Bob wasstunned to see a large, bright “fiery object” hurtling from the sky toward him. From theupper deck on his houseboat, he was puzzled by the vivid turquoise blue-green amid othermore fiery red, yellow and orange colors. Despite the strange blue-green color, River Bobthought perhaps he was watching a plane about to crash. Whatever hit the ground waspicked up within fifteen minutes by a large sky crane helicopter and carried away.What River Bob did not know was that 200 miles west of Needles in Perris, California,near Riverside, a night security guard was also watching a bright object flash through thesky with an odd blue-green color. He thought it might be the break up of a satellite orspace vehicle because amid the colorful sparks, he could see the dark silhouette of adiamond-shaped object like the side of a nose cone. The security guard has asked me tocall him “Shark.” On May 14, 2008, he was on his night security duty in Perris. I talkedwith him this week about what he saw that early morning headed towards the Needles,California, region and what happened four months later in August that convinced Sharkthat there are vehicles above Earth that can respond to human thought. First, the Needlesobject.Needles, California, is the larger red circle; Topock, Arizona, is the smaller red circle."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Perris, California is about 200 miles southwest near Riverside.Interview:“Shark,” Security Guard, Perris, California: “I noticed a bright object streaking acrossthe sky. Amongst these sparks were heavier objects falling and catching the atmosphereand trailing away rather rapidly towards the ground, while the lighter sparking material wasstaying in an aligned, arcing formation trailing behind this object.COLORS?Colors near the back edge of the object were more bright orange, some blue and a uniqueteal color (blue-green), as if some type of unique metallic material was burning.Teal.The majority of the sparks trailing behind were lighter in bright white and some yellowtrailing for many miles behind it. But as this thing arced toward the Needles, California,area, what I saw appeared to be some type of panel that had come loose and flutteredabout in the trail of sparks, catching air and de-accelerating more rapidly than the minuteobjects behind it. The panel was large enough that as it sputtered in the sky, it blacked outthe lighter objects behind it. Then the panel fell away rather rapidly.IN ADDITION TO THE UNUSUAL TEAL COLOR, YOU SAW WHAT APPEARED TOBE AN OBJECT LARGE ENOUGH TO BE SILHOUETTED AGAINST THEBACKGROUND OF THE BRIGHT, FALLING OBJECTS AND THIS WAS WHATSHAPE?The falling black silhouette appeared to have a sort of V shape like some kind of side panelor nose cone. I couldn’t tell for sure what it was because it was too far away and too high,but it fluttered as it caught air and blacked out the lighted, spark objects behind it.Illustration of May 14, 2008, “black panel blocking out long trail of teal, orange, red,yellow and white sparks” in rapidly moving sky object falling towardNeedles, California.

Then I started putting it together that this was probablythe same object. And people were being kind of discrete about their identities. Earthfiles Interview with River Bob EyewitnessClick here for Archive Report, June 6, 2008YOU KNOW THAT I DID AN INTERVIEW WITH THE MAN CALLED ‘RIVER BOB,’WHO WAS ON HIS HOUSEBOAT? HE REPORTED THAT THE OBJECT IN WHICHHE COULD SEE A BRIGHT TURQUOISE COLOR CAME DOWN AND HIT THEGROUND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE COLORADO RIVER SO HARD THAT HESAW IT BOUNCE UP A LITTLE BEFORE IT FELL BACK DOWN.

Wilson Observatory in Los Angeles, California.Image source: Erickson Air-Crane, Inc.Right. I heard that report and I was pretty convinced the thing was being tracked.Somebody knew this was an incoming object and they were ready for it at that particularlocation (where it impacted near River Bob). They hustled out there and evidently pickedit up. But with the secrecy around River Bob and others such as the radio station and otherreports, I just decided to keep quiet because it sounded like they found most of it.But since the intensity of the investigation seems to have died down and what I ran intolater with the UFO phenomenon prompted me to go forward with what I have about thepanel part. There might be other parts out there at different locations.AM I THE VERY FIRST PERSON YOU HAVE TOLD ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW?Other than my brother and wife, I have not spoken to any other persons or media aboutthis. August 2008, Perris, California -“Telepathic UFO”"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Perris, California, is a Riverside suburb of about 46,000 residentssouthw est of the Mari ne Corps Ai r Ground Combat Center.YOU MENTIONED THAT AFTER MAY 2008, YOU HAD OTHER UFO SIGHTINGSTHAT HAVE HAUNTED YOU. WHAT HAPPENED?Well, it was three months later after the May 14, 2008, incident in Needles, in the middleof August 2008, out here in Perris, California, that I was trying to observe the stars, whichI do on occasion during my security guard night shift. It was about 2:20 AM. I have heardabout night vision binoculars. I don’t have a pair. I have a pair of regular binoculars. I triedusing my binoculars, but I just could not hold my hand steady enough to look at the starsand keep them steady. So, I put my binoculars away. Then what I do is just observe withmy eyes unaided the night sky. I observe by picking out a particular lighted object that Ibelieve could be in Earth-orbit range orbit out to 500 miles or so. Then I pick a star that isnear it to use as a larger focal point to discern any movement on the closer object. I’m notlooking around the whole sky.I’m concentrating on one, little, lit, faint object that I believe is in near-Earth orbit. I wasdoing that one night in the middle of August 2008, when there was this faint, lit object Ifocused on with a star right above it way out in the distance, but a bright star. I wasthinking to myself that it would be nice to see a UFO one night. Within a few seconds ofthinking that, this object moved from the 6 o’clock position below the star, arced to theright and up to the 5 o’clock position and stopped. The light that moved from the 6 o’clockto 5 o’clock position was lit the whole time.And I was thinking to myself, ‘Well, that is unique. That could be a UFO.’ It did not movemuch, but there might be something going on there.Then I thought if there would be more movement, I would be more convinced that thistruly was a UFO. And right about that point, it arced up in a counter-clockwise motion in aperfect circle, went all the way up above the star and around in one solid motion. Then thelight came back down to the 6 o’clock position.I said, ‘Well, that definitely looks like a UFO. I don’t know what more I can ask of it. Idon’t know if it’s going to do anything else. I’ll watch it for another minute or two. WhichI did and at that point, it did not move anymore. I didn’t hope that it would move anymore.I was just watching it, expecting it to maybe do something. But it didn’t.Mid-August 2008, 2:20 AM, bright light (red circles) that moved position"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"from 6 o'clock to 5 o'clock and then did a 360-degree circle (arrows) around star,seemingly in response to Shark's thoughts during security guard workin Perris, California. Illustration © 2009 by Shark.HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT HOW THE SPACE OBJECT COULD HAVEISOLATED YOUR SPECIFIC THOUGHTS TO REACT TO?I’m not sure how it’s done. I know other people try to take photographs of space objectsand the objects disappear or blink out. It’s like they are reading your mind. They areteasing you, playing with you. Their technology, their understanding of the communicationof picking up the thoughts of somebody looking at them – I don’t know how they would dothat! This is just way beyond my understanding. 2:23 AM , Large Rectangular CraftEmerges Silently from Cloud BankI then turned and walked to my security vehicle, which was a pickup truck about ten feetfrom me. I rested my arms across the tailgate and I was facing south. About three-quartersof a mile away at about 1,500 feet altitude, there was a bank of clouds and beyond theedge were more clouds, all at about 1,500 feet going across the terrain. I decided to watchthe clouds and see if they were moving to the east because if they were, that might meancooler temperatures for us in California because this was a hot time of August days andnights out here.I was watching the clouds for about two minutes and I could not see them moving. Theywere just stationary. If there was any movement at all, I could not tell. But what I didnotice was something coming out from the top of the clouds, slightly to my right and at thetop of the clouds like the object was sitting up there. This object was elongated and wasdark and black, but it had amber to orange color along its side edges and bottom edgesmostly.The strong edges where points seemed to come together were holding the amber to orangeglowing colors. The object continued up from above the clouds and not moving very fast. I estimate the speed to have been between 20 and 30 miles per hour, not fast enough forsustained flight of most aircraft. It had no wings on it. It was kind of shoe box style, butgem cut with facets across the top was flat and down the length of it on top and bottomwas flat. But from the top on each side to the center was about a 15-degree angle. Fromthe center to the bottom of the aircraft was another 15-degree angle.HOW LONG AND WIDE DO YOU THINK THIS THING WAS?The length was approximately 65 to 100 feet long and 15 to 20 feet wide and 10 to 12 feethigh.Mid-August 2008, 2:23 AM, only three minutes after the first UFOseemed to respond to Shark's thoughts, a large rectangular aircraft withglowing orange light dimly illuminating gem-like facets, emergedfrom cloud bank. Estimated length = 65 to 100 feet; width = 15 to 20 feet;height = 10 to 12 feet.

IS THERE REFLECTED MOONLIGHT? IS IT GLOWING? ISTHERE SOMETHING EMANATING FROM THE CRAFT? HOW ARE YOU SEEINGTHIS?Well, behind me towards where the first lighted object in space was, there was a moon outin that area. That moon was about 40% lit. On top of the unidentified craft was somereflected moonlight highlighting the silhouetted edges and top of the craft, all of whichappeared to be a flat black type of color with maybe some type of diamond pattern on itwhere the moonlight was catching some of the material, kind of like ripples on a lake atnight. The bottom of it showed more of the orange trim along some of its leading edges.WAS THIS LIGHT OR SOMETHING ELSE?It appeared to be orange light because there was nothing in the area that could illuminate itat that altitude and just on those edges. And this thing was still at 1,500 feet and it wascoming out from above the clouds with lighted edges on it of amber to orange, a littledarker orange.Shark's illustration of orange light outlines and possible sparkling“diamond” pattern on top. Graphic © 2009 by Shark. DID YOU MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD SEE SOME KIND OFDIAMOND PATTERN ETCHED INTO THE TOP?You can’t really tell for sure if it’s a diamond pattern or not, but I’m assuming it’s sometype of special pattern because the moonlight that was hitting it was not constant.As the craft pulled out from above the clouds, it immediately began pitching downward atabout 10 to 15 degrees. The front of this craft became more prominent where from the topto the center front and from the bottom to the center front, it was chisel-shaped."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Then what I could see as it angled downward in the front is that the back end was comingup and where the top of the back was and where the sides of the craft ended also appearedthat it would be chisel-shaped in the rear, the same as in the rear.As far as the orange goes, the orange trim also appeared on some of the top side-leadingedges, too. But as this thing came closer and closer away from the clouds where it shouldbe picking up more visible ambient light from the moon and ground, it seemed to be gettingdarker. The orange trim seemed to be disappearing more and more. It was not veryprominent in the beginning and now what was outlining the craft was sort of disappearing. Cloaking Technology?WHAT DID YOU THINK AT THAT MOMENT?I thought it was trying to cloak itself, trying to be more invisible. It was above the cloudsbefore and would then have been totally invisible to people on the ground, but now that itwas leaving the cloud bank area and coming out over open terrain with highways androads, it was doing something to hide itself.As it came out from that cloud bank coming in my direction at probably 20 to 30 mph, itwas pitching forward and descending at the same time. I thought, ‘This is great, I’m goingto get a good look at this.’ It kept coming forward and forward.At no time did I hear any sound from it and that made it rather eerie. And as itapproached and was descending, it got down to about 300 feet from me, was on the otherside of a highway. It was about 800 feet or so in altitude and it was leveling out. As far assound goes then, I still could hear no sound.I would say that either this had anti-gravity capabilities or it had lighter-than-air-gas in partof its structure.This thing continued descending until it got to about 800 feet and then it leveled out at thatpoint about 300 feet from me. It was still moving towards me and it was at that point that Ithought, ‘This is going to be darn near right over me or right next to me and I don’t want tobe directly under it.’ Shark Backs Up to Building for ProtectionI decided to back up next to a building that I was at and just keep my back up against thebuilding and kind of be out of a lighted area and observe it from that point. So, I backed upagainst the building and looked up again when this thing should have been right over me,or nearly over me slightly to my right, and I could not pick it out from the sky no more. Idon’t know what happened to it. It had either disappeared or had fully cloaked itself andwas right there.At that point, I just felt an eerie sense. I was not sure of its intentions and I decided I hadbetter be a little bit safer and I went and got into my vehicle.SHARK, WHY DO YOU THINK YOU FELT FEAR? Well, this was obviously trying to disguise itself, so I didn’t know what the intentionswere. But I also thought at the same time that for me to be able to see two unique UFOoddities in one evening within a couple of minutes apart.Some kind of communication was happening that potentially went from my viewing andthoughts to the UFO in space to this object, which appeared less than three-quarters of amile away and then comes towards me. There’s something going on here. It mightcooperation and technologies for communications and guidance, or a whole lot of otherthings. But I had had just about enough of the UFOs for that night!And yes, mentally I was thinking it looked like a UFO, but to make me 100% convinced,I’d like to see this thing really move, you know, and do something. Right at that point, itcontinued on counter-clockwise and went right back to that 6 o’clock position making aperfect circle around that distant star that I was focusing on for a center point.WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD BE AFRAID OF THE FACETED OBJECT IFYOU HAD JUST HAD A POSITIVE, TELEPATHIC CONNECTION TO WHATEVERTHE LIGHTED OBJECT WAS THAT DID THE 360-DEGREE-LOOP FOR YOU?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Well, from the time I saw that object in the 6 o’clock position in space to the time I sawthe object above the clouds was only two minutes. For this to happen, I felt there wasdefinitely some kind of communication going on from the space object to the other facetedcraft, but what the other faceted craft’s intentions were, I still did not know. Just becauseone object is cooperating with me in some far distant way did not mean to me that it wasstill safe to be interfacing with the larger object, which was now hundreds of miles closerin my atmosphere and above my head.BUT I STILL WONDER WHAT YOU WERE AFRAID OF?Well, I was afraid of its intentions because it’s there and acting stealthy and a black colorwith the stealthy orange outlines kind of makes that pretty unusual. The flightcharacteristics of this was unlike anything we’ve had other than maybe a blimp. But therewere no engine sounds, so this was truly a unique and different power source. Where thatobject is truly from, who is operating it, what their intentions are – I still do not know. Technologies Not From Earth?IF FOR A FACT YOU KNEW IT WAS FROM SOME OTHER PLACE, NOT THIS EARTH, WHAT WOULD YOUR COMMENT BE IF YOU HAD THAT KNOWLEDGE?I would want to know why it was here and what its intentions are. But I was in no positionand didn’t know where to go with it from there. This is like in your back yard - OK, nowwhat do you do with it?WHAT THOUGHTS HAVE YOU HAD SINCE AUGUST 2008 ABOUT THEPOSSIBILITY THAT NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCES ARE OPERATING IN OURSKIES ON EARTH IN KIND OF STEALTHY MANNERS?Well, I think these non-human intelligences are probably there. I think they are probablycommunicating with government military sources and are probably cooperating to someextent in the development of new technologies.ARE WE ALONE IN THIS UNIVERSE? AND IF NOT, WHAT DO THEINTELLIGENCES COMING TO EARTH WANT?Well, I don’t believe we’re alone in the universe. There has been too much happening, notjust from my sighting, but from your work and other peoples’ work – there have been otherobjects filmed out in space that are pretty unique and unlike anything we have seenbefore.” If anyone has more information or images of such changing aerial patterns, please email: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.More Information:For multiple-colored light patterns in the sky since January 2008 in Stephenville, Texas,please see these Earthfiles reports in the Earthfiles Archive:• 12/17/2008 — Erath County, Texas, Policeman Saw 600-Foot-DiameterAerial Craft Over Stephenville Court House• 12/12/2008 — More Ohio Eyewitnesses See Glowing “Pod” Rise Up toTriangle• 12/02/2008 — Updated: Strange Aerial Object Over Irving, Texas• 07/26/2008 — Part 1: Why No Military Response to Radar UnknownHeaded to Bush Crawford Ranch on January 8, 2008?• 04/24/2008 — Strange Aerial Lights Like Texas - But NowPhotographed in Indiana, Illinois, and Massachusetts• 02/26/2008 — Viewer Comments About Infrared Cameras, AerialSymbols and Lights• 02/22/2008 — Updated: More Aerial “Symbols” Photographed OverDublin, Texas• 02/22/2008 — Abductee Jim Sparks Comments On Alien SymbolTechnology• 02/20/2008 — Updated Part 1: Viewer Comments About Aerial Flamesand “Symbols” Over Dublin and Stephenville, Texas• 02/14/2008 — Update: Mysterious Symbols Projected in Night Sky by"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Aerial Disc Near Stephenville, Texas, Local AirportFor further reports about unidentified flying objects and mysterioius aerial lights, pleasesee my books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities and mydocumentaries A Strange Harvest and Strange Harvests 1993 now available in DVDformat in the Earthfiles Shop.Also, see Earthfiles Archive for dozens of reports from 1999 to 2009.Websites:Majestic-12 Documents: http://www.majesticdocuments.comStephenville Lights Website: http://www.stephenvillelights.com/Coalition for Freedom of Information: http://www.freedomofinfo.org/Grant Cameron, Canada UFO Researcher: http://www.presidentialufo.com/UFO Evidence: http://www.ufoevidence.org/welcome.aspUFO Casebook: http://www.ufocasebook.com/NUFORC: http://www.nuforc.org/ Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
