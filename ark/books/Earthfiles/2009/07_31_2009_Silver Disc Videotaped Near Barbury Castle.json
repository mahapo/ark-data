S. Intelligence Source July 30, 2009 Yatesbury, Wiltshire, England - Being back in Wiltshire reminds me ofthe night back in the late 1990s when I was doing a live COAST report to Art Bell from ared English telephone booth in the countryside. With me were others who had joined me atthe East Field silage pit for a night watch after a very rainy, stormy day. I had a powerfulinfrared scope that had been loaned to me by a former military friend - which was possiblethen before 9/11- and we had been looking into the dark mist over the East Field towardGolden Ball Hill to see if any mysterious lights might show up, since the small, glowingorbs have been seen before, during and after crop formations are created.I was passing the scope around to the others and at one point when the infrared scope wasback in my hands, we all thought we saw a flash of red out in the darkness. When Ifocused the infrared scope on where I thought I saw the red flash, to my astonishment,there was a bright, white oval at the center of the scope that began to move jumping sideto side. All of us watched it at various times through the scope. When I had the infraredback again, I called out to the darkness, Come closer, were not afraid of you. Instantly, theinfrared object began to flutter in brightness, changing intensity more and more rapidly andsuddenly changed from the white oval into an even brighter square that reminded me of amirror glinting under a noontime sun. But none of us could see anything in the darknesswith our eyes. The pulsing oval that transformed into a glittering, fluttering square mirrorall happened in an infrared frequency. Back then, none of us had a way to videotape orfilm through the military infrared scope.This week I have viewed an extraordinary videotape in visible light range taken on June14, 2009, by Paul Jones, a researcher for the Open Minds Forum Research Team. Paulscrop research colleague is Andrew Pyrka, a taxicab driver. Both are from Cheltenham,Gloucestershire County, about 50 miles west of Avebury, Wiltshire, and both arefascinated by crop formations. Paul and Andrew have been trying to make the hours drivefrom their respective homes to Wiltshire on weekends for night watches. June 14, 2009, Barbury CastleAztec Bird and UFO"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Barbury Castle \"Aztec Bird\" reported June 14, 2009.Aerial image © 2009 by Lucy Pringle.On Sunday, June 14, 2009, the two men had their respective visible light video cameraswith them when they visited what was known as the Aztec bird below Barbury Castle, firstreported that morning north of Marlborough. Paul Jones had a tripod mounted with hisJVC Hard Disk Camcorder and its 32 times Mega Pixel Optical Zoom. Andrew Pyrka didnot have a tripod for his older hand-held Panasonic Video camera.The two men encountered an angry farmer who told them they could not enter his fieldcontaining the Aztec Bird. So at 8:30 PM, June 14, 2009, the two men were driving downa hill away from Barbury Castle when they both saw a dark, swirling mass near thehorizon.Paul Jones and Andrew Pyrka stopped their van and each got a pair of binoculars. I couldsee a silver disc that either had a bright white light or the sun was glinting off. Andrewthought it might be a helicopter, Paul told me.I have watched a half-hour of their visible light videotape and the aerial object appears tobe silver metal with a bright, white light at one end that at first is shining toward Paul'scamera on the tripod. Then the unidentified aerial object rotates so that the white lightmoves to one side and the strangely shaped object - not a perfect disc shape, but almosttrapezoid - hovers without moving for ten minutes. Then the silver object began to descendfor ten seconds until it goes behind the horizon hill down toward land between BarburyCastle and Swinden."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Andrew Pyrka decided to take his hand-held camera out into the field in the direction thatthe craft descended, while Paul stayed with his tripod and camera. For fifteen minutes,nothing was in the sky. Then suddenly, Paul spotted the silver craft back pretty muchwhere it had been before and started videotaping a second segment with his camera on thetripod. “Andrew seemed to be walking around looking as if he could not see it! So, I called"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"him on my cell phone and asked him, ‘Can't you see the silver craft in front of you?’ButAndrew could still not see it!”Andrew Pyrka was very confused. He was looking all around him, but could not seeanything in the sky in any direction! So, Paul began trying to guide Andrew by phonecloser and closer to the silver craft above him. At one point, Paul yells in the phone,“Andrew, you're so close, put your arm up and see if you can feel anything.”Andrew Pyrka lifted his left arm straight up toward the sky. “Instantly, when I put my armup, there was a huge jolt of electrical current that went down my raised arm. I don't think Itouched anything solid,” he told me, “but I definitely interacted with some kind of strongfield the UFO must have been giving off. But why couldn't I see it where I was, while Paulcould not only see it, he videotaped it for another fifteen minutes?”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"This is the only color, visible light videotape I've ever seen amid crop formations in whicha silver aerial craft can be seen for such a long time stationary, then descending, and thenback again while one eyewitness can see the second re-appearance of the aerial craftwhiile the second eyewitness can't see it.Back in the mid-1980s after I had produced the TV documentary A Strange Harvest, aman who had worked for an American intelligence agency told me the U. S. governmentwas well aware that UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin and had a technology that coulddeflect photons. He said, “You can have 100 people in a park and this alien technologycan control photons to such a point that only one person out of the hundred might see acraft right above their heads. That also could explain the cases of people driving cars on abusy freeway and are confused after stopping to stare at a UFO in the sky that all the othercars keep rushing by.”Andrew Pyrka plans to release his videotape in a television documentary special sometime in the future. Other UFO Eyewitnesses OnJune 14, 2009 Near Barbury CastleCharles Mallett, Director of the Silent Circle Research Centre in Compton Bassett,received two emails from other eyewitnesses near Barbury Castle on June 14, 2009:Debs Marriage emailed:We estimate the time of our sighting as between 7:55 p.m. and8:10 p.m.My friend and I had visited the new formation at WaylandsSmithy on the evening of 14th June. We left Waylands Smithy atapproximately 8 p.m. and drove east towards Wantage. We werejust past the Westcot turn when I exclaimed to my friend, whowas driving, Theres two black UFOs!I saw two, thin black UFOs on the eastern horizon. We dippeddown below the hill line (the road is undulating here) and aswe drove back up, the UFOs had disappeared. We turned up thenext farm track and parked up to see if we could spot themagain, but to no avail.At the time I said that I thought they were the classictriangle shape, but I was seeing them edge on and travelingtowards us; i.e. east to west, so they appeared as thin, blackshapes with a slight bulge in the middle. I estimate they werea long way off when I saw them, at least 5 miles, but theywere still large shapes, much wider than an aeroplane or thehot air balloon we had seen earlier. And very black against asunny blue sky.Paula Dugani emailed:Here is a brief account of what I experienced on 14th June at"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Barbary Castle.At approximately 8:15 p.m. on 14th June 2009, my brother Jamesand I visited Barbary Castle to watch thesunset. We entered through the East gate and walked towardsthe ring fort. We were facing West.At approximately 8:20 p.m., I looked up and saw somethingglinting at the edge of a cloud.On closer inspection It looked like a bubble or an orb. Istared for a number of minutes, pointing it out to James whocould not see it although he was looking in the direction Iwas pointing.After about 2 minutes the orb seemed to disappear. I continuedto walk around the ring fort but when I looked back, the orbwas again visible. This time James saw it, too. We watched itfor several minutes as it glinted in the sun (like a lightgoing on and off). Now you see it now you don't!!The orb, once again disappeared, but shortly afterwards we sawa small, black object emerge from the same cloud.It looked like an aeroplane, but was traveling very slowly andmade no noise that we could hear. It flew overhead andeventually disappeared into the distance.More Information:For further information about worldwide crop formations, please see Earthfiles Archiveof reports (partial list below) and my book, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles, in theEarthfiles Shop.• 07/31/2009 — Infrared Video of Light Flashes, Moving Darknesses - andEntity?• 07/30/2009 — Inside the 12-Armed Ogbourne St. George Wheat Formation• 07/15/2009 — Part 1: Silbury Hill “Quetzlcoatl Headdress” and MysteriousTall Blonds• 07/14/2009 — 2-Stage Cannings Cross Wheat Formation Scene of FarmArrest• 07/12/2009 — Mysterious Aerial Lights Mimicking Stars in Texas andOregon• 07/11/2009 — Update Podcast: Is Sudden Solar Intensity of July 5 - 7 WhatU.K. Spring Crop Formations Forecast for Oddly Quiet Sun?• 07/06/2009 — UK “Quetzalcoatl Headdress” and “Sixth Sun Tzolkin”?• 07/03/2009 — UK “Nazca Hummingbird” - Astronomical and MayanCounting• 07/03/2009 — Part 3: “Alien Symbols” in Milk Hill and South Field• 07/02/2009 — Part 1: “Alien Symbols” in Milk Hill and South Field• 07/02/2009 — Part 2: “Alien Symbols” in Milk Hill and South Field• 06/09/2009 — Update Podcast: Aerial Lights That Mimic Stars, Helicoptersand Airplanes• 06/05/2009 — Part 2: Mysterious, Silent, Large Aerial Triangles• 06/04/2009 — Part 1: Mysterious, Silent, Large Aerial Triangles• 05/12/2009 — Part 3: Astronomical Information in U.K. 2009 CropFormations?• 05/10/2009 — Part 2: 800-Foot-Long Pattern in U.
