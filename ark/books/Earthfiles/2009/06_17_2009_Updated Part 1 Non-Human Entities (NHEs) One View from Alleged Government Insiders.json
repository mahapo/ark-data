Ray told mehe had been contacted by two men who showed identification from the Department ofDefense in Washington, D. C.The two agents wanted to discuss Boeche's research about eschatology, a branch oftheology that is concerned with the ultimate or last things such as death, judgment, heavenand hell, or the end of the world as we know it. During their conversation, Ray referencedmy book. The two men asked if they could read Glimpses, Vol. I. Boeche called me toexplain the situation and to ask if I had any objections to his giving the intelligence agentsmy book.Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume I: Facts and Eyewitnesses© 1994 by Linda Moulton Howe. See Earthfiles Shop.I told him, “Not only give them the book, ask them if they will write in the marginswhatever comments they have about what is correct and incorrect. That would be a safeway for them to communicate and for us to learn something. I'll send you a new copy toreplace the one you give them.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In June 1994, Ray Boeche called again and said I would be getting a package in the mail.He said the contents would be a floppy disc in a sealed envelope handed to him by the twoagents. Ray said the men did not want to write in the book, but were replying on thecomputer disc with comments about the content in my Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I.The following is an electronic scan of the original floppy disc printed three pages from theDoD insiders that I call the Writers.

Recorded message, October 18, 1991, on Linda Moulton Howe's phoneanswering machine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: “(Bob Lazar, Area 51)mentioned that the aliens were hundreds of years ahead in technology.Actually, it would be more like thousands of years. The ships don't havewindows as we know windows to be. The craft are smooth and metalliccolored. The aliens have no intention of hurting anyone. There will beincreased sightings, very, very increased sightings in the future. The bloodfrom the animals that you were talking about is not being used to make thingscompatible with people as it is being developed for, shall we say, to save theanimals against radiation poisoning. The government does not have ships inworking order, but does have the remains of some. There was a survivor(alien), but I don't know if that person is still living. The truth of the matter isthat if the reason for their visiting the planet were revealed, the public couldnot handle it.” David Joseph Bohm (1917-1992), Ph.D., quantum physicistand author, Wholeness and the Implicate Order © 1980.J.

He postulated that the intelligencesinvolved have influenced and manipulated human affairs for centuries, often withdeception. In his 1988 book, Dimensions, Dr. Vallee wrote: “We are not dealing withsuccessive waves of visitations from space. We are dealing with a control system. ...Icannot tell whether this control is ... artificial in nature, under the power of somesuperhuman will. It may be entirely determined by laws that we have not yet discovered.” Continued in Part 2 - My questions to Writers.For further reports about non-human entities, please see reports below in the 1999 - 2009Earthfiles Archive and my books An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of OtherRealities in the Earthfiles Shop.• 06/01/2009 — Part 10: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 05/26/2009 — Part 9: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 05/13/2009 — Part 8: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 05/05/2009 — Part 7: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 04/29/2009 — Part 6: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 04/21/2009 — Archive Reprint: Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell Says GovernmentsCovering Up E.
