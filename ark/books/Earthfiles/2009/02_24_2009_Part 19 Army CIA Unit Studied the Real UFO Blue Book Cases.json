Return to Part 1Return to Part 18February 24, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - At the end of Part 18, of my June 29,1998, interview with Stein at his Florida home, he was talking about the Wackenhutsecurity firm that worked with the CIA in the 1950s. It was also Wackenhut in CoralGables, Florida, that his phone manager friend told him [ See Stein Earthfiles Part ] wasthe source of the first call to Stein warning him not to talk with me further about the nameof the southeastern military base or its activities during the Cuba stand-off with the SovietUnion or its alleged assassin squad assigned to termination missions. During his work forthe Army/CIA unit that studied real UFO Blue Book cases, Stein said, “We could callWackenhut for background checks on civilians coming to do work. Wackenhut is aworldwide security firm with offices in Europe.”Before I left Stein's home on July 1, 1998, he and I agreed that we would work together ona book and he would tell his whole Army/CIA story again on videotape for possible use ina documentary for television that I would produce.I had traveled to his home without anyone knowing my destination and after I left, Itraveled to another destination for a 4th of July holiday before returning to myPhiladelphia office. After my visit and long, recorded audio interview with Stein, neither ofus expected that Wackenhut and/or CIA agents would turn up more menacingly in his life.I returned to my Philadelphia home base on July 5, 1998, to find the following voice mailleft by Stein on July 3, 1998:Stein Phone Voice Mail: “ Yes, Linda, Stein calling. I have had visitors fromeither Wackenhut or the CIA that followed me to the grocery store and thentalked with me outside the grocery store in the parking lot. They definitely donot want me to go ahead with anything further with you in regard to the issuesthey mentioned. And they told me the reason why, concerning thesoutheastern military base identification. So, I would say hold up oneverything.“One thing they did was threaten. They had photographs of my son at hismarine work, going to work and in his car. They mentioned to me that itwould be a shame for him to have an accident at such a young age, and he isjust 30. So, I think what I need to do is hold off on everything as far as doinganything for a book, radio or anything. My wife does not know this yet, so"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"would appreciate it if you would not mention this to her at all if you call here.We are leaving this afternoon for a trip up north and I’ll try to get hold of youagain from up north.”A month later on August 7, 1998, Stein had returned with his wife to their southeasternhome and he replied to a voice mail I had left on his home phone to please call me whenhe could for more discussion about the threat at the supermarket.August 7, 1998 Phone Call About Supermarket ThreatLinda Moulton Howe: “CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME MORE DETAILS ABOUT WHATHAPPENED AFTER I LEFT YOUR HOME AND YOU WERE GOING TO THESUPERMARKET?Stein: Yeah, after you left, I noticed for a couple of days that I was followed by aSpanish-looking fellow in a car. I went grocery shopping the day before and he would beby the prescription counter where he was using the blood pressure machine there. But assoon as I left, he would come out again and drive down to the next block past our house. Inoticed that action and thought, ‘This guy is tailing me.’Then the next day, I went to the store and parked in a shady spot on the street so I had aways to walk. Then I was walking and got about half way to the store when I saw the sameguy get out of a car in the store parking lot with another person. They walked toward meand as I got closer to them, one of them said to me, ‘We would like to have a word withyou.’I said, ‘OK, what’s the problem?’He said, ‘We have been sent over here’ – I assumed they meant from Coral Gables andWackenhut – ‘to talk with you.’ The first thing he said was, ‘We think we know who youwere, as far as your CIA name. And we know that you have a lot of background fromWWII on up as far as your knowledge. We would like to talk to you about that.’ Theyleaned against the trunk of a nearby car very casually. It was not their car.DID THEY GIVE YOU THE NAME THEY HAD FOR YOU IN THE CIA TO PROVETHEY KNEW?No.DID THEY SHOW YOU ANY IDENTIFICATION?No, they never did. I asked them, ‘Who are you and where are you from?’ But they wouldnot tell me. They said that the government has been watching a number of people in regardto old classified material. They said that they understood the classified agreement thatpeople like me signed back after the war that were supposed to apply for 30 or 35 yearsand the time was up on those agreements - they had expired. But then they said theywanted to explain to me why they wanted to keep the southeastern military base out of thepublic. They did show me photographs of the little airport I once knew there, but it was allchanged from the way it was when I was there in the 1950s. The photos they showed mewere of a place much bigger, if that was the same place.DID THEY EXPLAIN WHY THE ISSUE IS SO SENSITIVE TODAY?Yes. They showed me a ground-to-air defense that they had there in the southeastern U. S.MISSILES?Not missiles, but the new ‘Star Wars weapons,’ they said. I did see one building that had aroof that would retract so they could shoot upward from inside the building.WHAT DO YOU UNDERSTAND THE WEAPONS ARE?I think they are particle beam weapons where they can shoot a satellite down from theground. I think that is probably what it was. I asked them if it was a particle beam weaponand the men told me it was a ‘highly advanced system.’ They said that particle beam hadsomething to do with it, but it was far more advanced than that. One guy said, ‘Anythingcoming in from the Atlantic Ocean, we can take care of, even in outer space, with thisweapon.’They said some people had tried to get into the area to see and had been killed. One was aRussian and one was someone from the United States. They said, ‘This is the reason weneed to keep this secret because we have other bases in various other strategic parts of thecountry that are able to do the same thing as far as shoot down something from outerspace."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I asked, ‘Have you been shooting down any saucer vehicles and aliens with this weapon?’And those Wackenhut types told me they had.DID YOU ASK WHY?No. I asked if the aliens were aggressive or did something in that area of the country whereyou would shoot them down. And the men said, ‘Yes, there were some incidents involvingsome deaths that had been kept secret.’ Those craft were the ones they had shot down.MEANING INCIDENTS IN WHICH ALIENS HAD KILLED HUMANS?Yes, apparently. When the alien craft took off, the government units had gotten the wordand went after them. Plus, in the photos of the airstrip, I also saw black helicopters on therunway and also black trucks.IN THE PHOTOS THE MEN SHOWED YOU?Yes. And those helicopters and black trucks are retrieval equipment if a saucer crashes orthey shoot one down. Then they go out and retrieve it and bring it back to thatsoutheastern military base.DID THEY EXPLAIN WHY ALL THIS WAS HOUSED IN THAT PARTICULARMILITARY BASE?Because it’s a strategic point for the southeastern U. S. They can cover with the weaponmost of the Florida area and southeastern U. S. And then there are other weapons placedaround other parts of the country.DID THEY SAY THEY HAVE USED THE ADVANCED WEAPONS TO SHOOT DOWNDISCS AND EXTRATERRESTRIALS IN THE LAST YEAR OR TWO?No, they didn’t say a timeline. They did say they had worked with the Russians who hadthe same equipment and that the Russians have shot down several craft, including a verylarge craft.DID THE MEN SAY WHICH TYPE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL THEY ARESHOOTING DOWN?No, they didn’t and I asked them if it was the 6-fingered extraterrestrials? Or the Greys?And they told me they could not release that information.DID THEY GIVE YOU ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIFFERENT TYPES?No, they just said they had two craft that did something aggressively and after the saucercraft took off and started flying somewhere else around the area, the military base unitused the advanced weapon to shoot the craft down.DID YOU HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THIS WAS RECENT HISTORY?He said that the U. S. has had that defense down there for a number of years and the StarWars thing happened in the 1980s. So, it was not ancient history.IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE LAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS?Yes, probably the last ten years. Anyway, the men said that we had to keep this secret andthey said, ‘We know that you probably don’t care that much for yourself, being your ageand bad health. But I know that you are very close to your son.’ Then they showedphotographs of my son going to work where he lives in Florida and getting into his carafter work and the apartment where he lives – getting out of his car and headed for hisapartment.The men said, ‘We know you are very close to your son and it would be a shame - if youcould not keep this under wraps – if something were to happen to him.’THAT IS SO BELOW THE BELT!Yeah! And I told them it would be awful. I told them that I have not in the past disclosedanything. I said, ‘You have probably monitored the radio program (I did with you [Linda]on Dreamland and Coast to Coast AM with Art Bell) and that all the sensitive issues wereleft out. And they told me, ‘Yes, that was really appreciated because that really helped usout.’DID THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAD PERSONALLY AND SPECIFICALLYHONORED THE DELETIONS?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Yes, and they said, ‘Linda had taken care of this in a very professional manner.’GOOD. I’M TRYING TO DO MY WORK RESPONSIBLY AND THIS IS WHY I WANTSO MUCH TO KEEP GOING FORWARD WITH OUR PROJECT AND I STILL DON’TSEE THAT ANYTHING IS CHANGED OR AFFECTED AS LONG AS I HONOR THEEXCLUSION OF DETAILS ABOUT THE SOUTHEASTERN BASE.The men also told me they knew about my experience in Washington, D. C. and CIAheadquarters. They repeated again, ‘We are pretty sure we know who you were as far aswhat name you used in the CIA. We know you did not use your real name in the CIA.’DID YOU ASK THEM WHAT NAME THEY HAD?Yes, I said, ‘Who am I?’ (laughs)The men said, ‘We can’t disclose that, but we are quite sure that we have found yourgroup.’ He told me that all the 20 some members of my CIA group were all dead, includingthe leader (Anthony Barden), who died on the job in the 1970s. The men said that we wereall dead and that correlated with what I told you about how I got out of the CIA withAnthony’s working with the police to get a dead, derelict body that he had my CIAidentification placed on that went with a death certificate.SO, THOSE MEN IN THE PARKING LOT WERE SHOCKED - WHEN I DID THEINTERVIEW WITH YOU THAT WAS BROADCAST ON THE RADIO - TO LEARNYOU WERE ACTUALLY ALIVE?Yes. And the men said that my CIA group with all the WWII knowledge, ‘As far as weknow, the ones that had this knowledge, even in military service, have all died of old ageor died in various accidents.’ Linda, note their use of the word ‘accidents.’ (laughs)DID THE TWO MEN LEANING AGAINST THE TRUNK OF THE CAR AT THESUPERMARKET MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT THE GERMAN-NAZI-DISCCONNECTION TO ALL THIS?No, they didn’t. They just mentioned that they knew I had knowledge of the WWII files.DID THE MEN MENTION ANY INFORMATION ABOUT ANYTHING RELATED TOEXTRATERRESTRIAL INFORMATION AND USE THAT TERM,‘EXTRATERRESTRIAL’?No. They didn’t even use the term ‘extraterrestrial’ when they said that we had shot downa couple of the saucer vehicles.They said, ‘We appreciate your silence on this thing and we hope that you won’t bebroadcasting anymore or doing any other work over the air or in writing pertaining to thiswhole WWII and southeastern military base situation.’I asked them what they knew about my health and one of them said, ‘Your diabetes is verybad.’ (laughs) That is true, so they did get my medical records some how. You know whenyou try to get insurance, the insurance companies can pull up medical records and find outjust exactly what illnesses you have and then they won’t insure you. So, there has to besome system just like a bank and credit reports, but for medical that intelligence agents canget access to.DO YOU FEEL THAT YOU HAVE ANY RESPONSIBILITY TO NOT GO FORWARDON THE E. T. INFORMATION? Well, they did tie that in, which was the biggest part of what you and I were going to writeabout and videotape, from WWII on up. Ironically, my knowledge of the extraterrestrialsituation wasn’t really that great in terms of firsthand knowledge, except for the trip toArea 51 with Anthony Barden and some of our group.WE HAVE ALREADY PUT ALL THAT OUT ON THE RADIO, SO I DON’T SEE WHYI CAN’T DEVELOP WHAT I’VE ALREADY BROADCAST AND DO MY OWNRESEARCH AND STILL DO THIS WITH YOU?Anything you do, they’ll know you got it from me!THE ONLY PART THEY HAVE DEFINED THAT IS RELEVANT TO ACLASSIFICATION ISSUE IS THE SOUTHEASTERN MILITARY BASE. THE WORLDWAR II STUFF FROM LONG AGO EXPIRED NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENTDATES. NAZI FILES ARE BEING OPENED MORE AND MORE THESE DAYS. SO, ITHINK THE MEN TRYING TO INTIMIDATE YOU ARE OUT OF LINE TRYING TOKEEP YOU FROM TALKING ABOUT WWII HISTORY."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I WOULD LIKE TO KEEP WORKING WITH YOU WITH THE UNDERSTANDINGTHAT I WILL PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF YOUR NAME, LOCATIONAND THE NAME OF THE SOUTHEASTERN MILITARY BASE.Yes, their main worry is public discussion about the base.I ALREADY HAVE PROVED I KEPT THAT NAME OUT OF MY RADIOBROADCAST. I DON’T THINK THAT INTIMIDATION SHOULD BE APPLIED HERE.Well, at the end of the conversation, the two men referred again to the state of my illhealth and to my son. They told me they knew he had done very well in college and had apromising career.I VERY MUCH RESENT THAT KIND OF INTIMIDATION - INDIRECTLYTHREATENING FAMILY MEMBERS INSTEAD OF YOU DIRECTLY.I do, too. Just as they were getting ready to leave, they put the photos and informationthey had back into an envelope they took with them. I told them that I hoped they had agood trip back to Coral Gables.And they said, ‘We wish we had some of the older people who were in the beginning ofthis whole CIA thing. They were very sharp people and we don’t have people of thatcaliber in this day and age.’They said they thought they had done so well for thirty-five years because no one hadcome forward to try to blast out the truth. But such discretion would not happen today,they said - some individual would try to sell information to the Russians or to one of thetabloid newspapers – giving government secrets away.The car they were leaning against was not their car. They had walked across the parkinglot, so when they left, they went down the parking lot again and further down to get intotheir car. Way on the other side of the parking lot, I could not see their license platenumbers, but it was a Chrysler, 4-door, black.REMEMBER, WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT TO DO -EVEN IF IT HAS TO BE KEPT POSTHUMOUSLY - AND THAT IS TO PUT ONVIDEOTAPE YOUR TELLING IN YOUR OWN WORDS YOUR AREA 51 ANDOTHER EXPERIENCES. I HAVE SOMEONE WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO RUNCAMERA FOR ME FREE OF CHARGE, AND I REALLY THINK THIS ISIMPORTANT TO DO – TO GET ALL YOUR EXPERIENCE ON AN AUDIO-VISUALRECORD.Well, you have all the audiotapes, right?YES, BUT IT’S NOT AS STRONG AS A VIDEOTAPED STATEMENT BY YOU. AND IKNOW OUR GOVERNMENT MAKES VIDEOTAPES WITH INTELLIGENCEOPERATIVES FOR POSTHUMOUS RECORD AS WELL. THIS IS TOO IMPORTANTNOT TO HAVE YOU BE ON VIDEOTAPE. WE CAN DRAW UP AN AGREEMENTTHAT YOU APPROVE THE RECORDING, NOT FOR USE IN YOUR LIFE TIME, BUTCAN BE USED BY LINDA MOULTON HOWE UPON YOUR DEATH, OR HOWEVERYOU WANT IT TO BE WORDED.Yes, that would make sense.I CAN WORK WITH THE CAMERAMAN IN THE FIRST TWO WEEKS OFSEPTEMBER, SO PLEASE CONSIDER DOING A POSTHUMOUS RECORD. YOUNEED TO BE PRESERVED ON VIDEOTAPE. WE DON’T HAVE TO DO THIS ATYOUR HOUSE. WE CAN SET UP IN A CONVENIENT PLACE NOT FAR FROMYOUR HOME. IT’S IMPORTANT FOR HISTORY.Yes, I probably don’t have that long to live and I would like to get my story recordedaccurately.LET’S NOT TALK ABOUT ARRANGEMENTS ON THE PHONE FROM NOW ON. IWILL MAKE SOME WRITTEN ARRANGEMENTS AND MAIL DETAILS, IFDETAILS ARE OK WITH YOU.You haven’t had your mail opened?NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE. IF IT HAS BEEN OPENED, I’M NOT AWARE. I USE APOST OFFICE BOX.Well, I know from my own experience that we in the CIA used to be very good at gettingmail open without detection!"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CAN THEY GET TO FED EX?I think they can get to almost anything they want to.WELL, I PROVED TO THEM ON THE AIR THAT I COOPERATED.I feel that the way things operated years ago, once you declared on the radio that yourphone has been tapped, maybe they untapped it for a certain period of time.BEFORE I TALKED WITH YOU, I HAVE HAD PREVIOUS CONFIRMATIONS THATMY PHONE IN VARIOUS PLACES I HAVE LIVED HAS BEEN TAPPED.GOVERNMENT AGENTS PROBABLY THINK IT'S CORNY AS HELL, BUT FROMMY POINT OF VIEW, I AM SUPPOSED TO BE PROTECTED AS A JOURNALIST BYTHE 1ST AMENDMENT OF THE AMERICAN CONSTITUTION TO WORK FREELYAND REPORT WHATEVER NEWS I CAN. AND EXTRATERRESRIALS AND THEIRTECHNOLOGIES ARE NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO EXIST, ACCORDING TO THEGOVERNMENT’S OFFICIAL POLICY OF DENIAL. SO HOW CAN YOU OR I BEVIOLATING ANY NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE BY TALKING ABOUT THAT?SO, IF IT’S OK WITH YOU, I AM GOING TO PROCEED WITH ARRANGEMENTSAND THEN COMMUNICATE WITH YOU BY THE MAIL. AND YOU LET ME KNOWBY MAIL IF ALL IS OK.I should have written to you originally about my information rather than talking to you onthe phone [ May 2 and 7, 1998]. It never dawned on me that your phone line would betapped! [ See Stein Earthfiles Part 2.] I thought I knew that my phone would not be.WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS THE FIRST TIME I TALKED WITH YOU THEBEGINNING OF MAY 1998, WHY WOULD ANYBODY HAVE BEEN LISTENING?NOBODY KNEW THAT I WAS GOING TO CALL YOU.That's right. So, they must have equipment that records as soon as you pick up your phone.MEANING, THEY HAVE BEEN TAPPING ME ON A REGULAR BASIS BEFORE IEVER CALLED YOU.Yes. And with those men in the supermarket parking lot, they did not deny they were goingback to Coral Gables, which is Wackenhut. And my phone company friend alreadyconfirmed it was Wackenhut who called me the first time with the phone threat. And whenI was in the Army and CIA, Wackenhut was already going with intelligence information. The FBI used to have big files on everybody during the Senator McCarthy era.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Joseph Raymond McCarthy (November 14,1908 – May 2, 1957) was an American politician who served as a RepublicanU.S. Senator from the state of Wisconsin from 1947 until his death in 1957.Beginning in 1950, McCarthy became the most visible public face of a periodof intense anti-communist suspicion inspired by the tensions of the Cold War.He was noted for making claims that there were large numbers of Communistsand Soviet spies and sympathizers inside the American federal government.Ultimately, McCarthy's tactics and his inability to substantiate his claims ledhim to be discredited and censured by the United States Senate. The term‘McCarthyism,’ coined in 1950 in reference to McCarthy's practices, wassoon applied to similar anti-communist pursuits.”]The courts made the FBI destroy all that stuff because they weren't supposed to bekeeping records on American citizens. But what the FBI did was destroy some of the olderstuff, so they could show mounds of documents and files being shredded. But most of theFBI files from the McCarthy time were shipped to Wackenhut. And in the 1950s, we in theCIA used Wackenhut when we wanted to check on a certain person or company to seewhat their background was - to see if we could trust them with classified material. Wewould get a print out from Wackenhut.I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AGAIN AND I WILL CORRESPOND.OK, I'll be waiting for it.” Continued in Part 20 - Final threat.
