July 3, 2009 Wiltshire County, England - This morning I received the following UKcrop formations from 2008 and 2009, that the Australian scientist proposes have eachrelated to astronomical countdowns to predicted solar events. The current question todayis: since April 14, 2009, and the first UK crop formation at The Ridgeway in floweringoilseed rape, has the crop formation intelligence been forecasting a major solar eruptionfor Tuesday, July 7, 2009, perhaps occurring in the late afternoon in English time? [ See: Earthfiles043009 ]Australian scientist July 3, 2009: “Perhaps there is some method to their madness?I did not see the pattern until that ‘Nazca hummingbird’ appeared last night. Tail feathersin the swallows from 2008 read ‘10-9-8.’ Tail (or other) feathers in the hummingbird from 2009read ‘5-3-2-1.’” Graphic illustration produced by Australian scientist. 2008and 2009 aerial images from Cropcircleconnector.com.Further, Mark in Colorado, who worked in computer signal processing for thirteen yearsand who sent me his Quetzalcoatl PDF comparing the South Field and Milk Hill “aliensymbols” to Mayan glyphs has also emailed to me the following PDF about the “NazcaHummingbird” that was reported yesterday, July 2, 2009, below Milk Hill near Stanton St.Bernard, Wiltshire, England."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" See Mark PDFs 3 and 4For further information about worldwide crop formations, please see Earthfiles Archivedreports (partial list below) and my book, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles, in theEarthfiles Shop.• 04/30/2009 — Part 1: First 2009 U.
