Dolan.See More Information below to order.Return to Part 1August 30, 2009 Rochester, New York - The United Kingdom's Ministry of Defence(MoD) on August 17, 2009, released its second batch of 800 UFO documents in 4,000pages. The MoD's first UFO files release was in 2008, and the third expected release willbe next year in 2010. The MoD says it has now released all of its December 1980 RAFBentwaters UFO files, along with a summary to the media generally reported this way: “The U. K.’s Ministry of Defence could offer no definitive explanation forwhat the U. S. Air Force officers had reported seeing, but also found ‘noevidence of any threat to the defence of the United Kingdom.’ Nothing hadregistered on radar and there was no evidence of anything having intrudedinto U. K. air space and landed near RAF Bentwaters and Woodbridge.”Yet, only two months before on June 25, 2009, Col. Charles I. Halt (Ret.), the DeputyBase Commander at RAF Bentwaters in December 1980 during all the UFO phenomenon,spoke on the record in a press release: [ See previous Earthfiles Parts 1-6.]“... I believe the objects that I saw at close quarter were extraterrestrial inorigin and that the security services of both the United States and Englandwere and have been complicit in trying to subvert the significance of whatoccurred at Rendlesham by use of well-practiced methods ofdisinformation.”Not long after Col. Halt and the U. K. Ministry of Defence made these public releases -which seem contradictory - the second volume of an important trilogy by historian RichardM. Dolan, UFOs and the National Security State: The Cover-Up Exposed, 1973 - 1991 ©2009, was also released that includes a section about the December 1980 RAF BentwatersUFO phenomenon that reinforces Col. Halt's conclusion that the incident was“ extraterrestrial in origin.”Richard Dolan took ten years to produce the first two volumes of UFOs and the NationalSecurity State. The third volume is expected in late 2010. The energy behind hisdecade-long work was first provoked by his astonishment about so much hidden historydescribed in the book, Above Top Secret: The Worldwide UFO Cover-up © 1994 by"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Timothy Good. Rich Dolan said he began to sneak books about UFOs into his collegehistory and political classes at the University of Rochester. Richard told me, “I got to thepoint where I would be going into the university and hiding my UFO books almost like aguy would hide a man's magazine in the university! (laughs) I would not want anyone tosee I had a UFO book.”Richard Dolan was born July 1, 1962, in Brooklyn, New York. He grew up in Brentwood,Long Island, where he graduated from high school in 1980. Four years later he had earneda Bachelor of Arts degree in history and English literature with a minor in philosophy fromAlfred University in western New York after spending a portion of his junior year in 1983studying political ideologies at Exeter College in Oxford University, England. Ten yearslater, he had earned two Masters of Arts degrees in history (1986) and American historyand U. S. diplomacy (1995) from the University of Rochester.So, how did the budding historian switch from serious war history to one of the mostpolitically controversial subjects on Earth: unidentified flying objects? He got into anargument with one of his professors about the merits of a book entitled Case Closed ©1993 by Gerald Posner about the 1963 President Kennedy assassination. Rich Dolan gavereasons why the book did not add up and why the truth about the assassination appearedto be covered up. When the professor accused Rich Dolan of being a “conspiracytheorist,” Rich realized that even academics were not objective, that professors did notcross certain political lines in order to have research grants and achieve tenure. Suddenly,Rich Dolan knew he did not want to be trapped in superimposed paradigms and that whathe most wanted to understand and research was the long, complex, controversial history ofthe global UFO phenomena.Richard Dolan self-published this new second volume to maintain control on the contentand below in More Information is a hot link to his Keyhole website for orders of hisimportant book. Since the second volume has been released around the same time as Col.Halt's extraterrestrial statement about RAF Bentwaters and the MoD release of more UFOfiles that do not contain the truly sensitive and highly classified RAF Bentwatersdocuments and photographs, I asked Rich why the MoD would try to window dress asuperficial release of UFO files as complete when they are not?Interview:Richard M. Dolan, Historian and author of3-volume UFOs and the National Security State,Rochester, New YorkRichard Dolan, Historian and Author, UFOs and the National Security State © 2000and 2009, Rochester, New York: “The MoD, going back to the 1970s and 1980s, hasalways obfuscated, not clarified, the issue of UFOs and the MoD’s relationship to it. Andlet me add something else here about Col. Charles Halt and the whole issue of defensesignificance regarding the Rendlesham case of 1980.In my new book, Vol. 2 of UFOs and the National Security State, I’ve got a fairly longpiece on the Rendlesham case. It includes an account I received from fellow researcher,Peter Robbins, who with former RAF Bentwaters 1st Class Airman Larry Warren, wrote a1997 book on Rendlesham, Left At East Gate.Peter and Larry interviewed Charles Halt about fifteen years ago in 1994, and according toPeter Robbins, Halt admitted to them privately that the beams of light from the UFO thatnight (December 28, 1980) somehow penetrated the alternating layers of steel, earth andconcrete of the hardened bunkers, which had nuclear weapons there at the time. So,fifteen years ago, Col. Halt told them that the beams reached the secure areas where theweapons were stored and that would adversely affect the ordnance.THAT COMPLETELY CONTRADICTS ANY ASSERTION BY THE MoD NOW THAT"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"THERE WAS NO ‘EVIDENCE OF ANYTHING HAVING INTRUDED INTO U. K.AIRSPACE AND LANDED NEAR RAF WOODBRIDGE.’Clearly! Back at that time, Lord Hill-Norton was involved – he was one of the top militarylegends of Britain – he was calling for a better investigation of the Rendlesham case. Whathe had said was that if this is of no defense significance, it’s either one or the other. Eithersomething unknown landed in a secure area where it was not supposed to go, someunknown object; or conversely, the U. S. military personnel who were there were undersome kind of psychological delusion that it would be so serious that it would have to be ofdefense significance.So, Lord Hill-Norton’s argument was it’s one or the other and there is no way that cannotbe of defense significance, clearly.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Admiral of the Fleet Peter John Hill-Norton,Baron Hill-Norton GCB (February 8, 1915-May 16, 2004) was Chief of theDefence Staff of the United Kingdom and Chairman of the NATO MilitaryCommittee.He was known as an outspoken advocate on the importance of sea power anda strong defense for Britain. Though a traditionalist by nature, he also believedin modernization, taking the brave decision to abolish the Royal Navy'straditional daily rum ration. In later years he took an interest in UFOs, whichincluded writing about them and asking questions in Parliament ].SINCE THIS GOES RIGHT TO THE HEART OF EVERYTHING IN YOUR BOOK ANDBASICALLY TO THE HEART OF BENTWATERS, I WOULD LIKE TO READBRIEFLY FROM THE JUNE 25, 2009, PRESS RELEASE BY GARY HESELTINE, THESCRIPT WRITER IN COLLABORATION WITH RETIRED USAF COL. CHARLES I.HALT. THESE ARE COL. HALT’S OWN WORDS.Col. Charles I. Halt (Ret.), June 25, 2009 press release: ‘I wish to make itperfectly clear that the UFOs that I saw were structured machines movingunder intelligent control and operating beyond the realm of anything I haveever seen before or since. I believe the objects that I saw at close quarterwere extraterrestrial in origin and that the security services of both theUnited States and England were, and have been, complicit in trying tosubvert the significance of what occurred at Rendlesham by use ofwell-practiced methods of disinformation.’Richard Dolan: Yes, that’s a very, very strong statement indeed. What I have argued inthis new book is trying to understand the structure of power and secrecy itself. This isalways a difficult thing to do because none of us researchers are in on the decision makingprocess to clamp down on this.But what has happened is over 60 years, we’ve had this massively important UFOphenomenon that a number of people have known about and decided this is too importantto share with the rest of the world.One obvious reason, it seems to me, is that they are hiding not simply the reality of anotherintelligence here on this planet, but actually the possession of certain hardware that theyobtained somehow in their possession – whether through crash retrievals or some versionof hand-me-downs (from the non-humans). But the power structure got some technology, Ibelieve – this is what the evidence points to – that was so exotic that they realized theycould not possibly want to share this with the rest of the world at this time (1940s). Afterall, in circa 1950, there was a Cold War going on, there were concerns in the United Statesover Soviet espionage of stealing atomic secrets and so forth.If the United States did not want to share atomic technology, clearly we must assume thatthe United States elite did not want to share something as exotic as alien technology. So,what would they do?Well, I think what logically they would do is gather together a team of top individuals todecide how technology gets passed off to private industry for research? Another persondecides how bad the public panic might be. Another person might be in charge ofunderstanding who these other beings might be. And so forth.I think this is exactly what happened. It might not have been a decision by Harry Trumanthat this secrecy would last forever. It could very well have been a case where he mightthink, ‘Let’s discuss this and re-visit this in a few years and decide at that time what ourstrategy will be.’But the problem with the secret like this is that it develops its own momentum, its ownprofitability. It becomes, in a sense, the goose that lays golden eggs because you’ve gotthis technology that eventually certain genius scientists are going to study these materials"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"long enough, they might not be able to replicate it exactly, but they might get some verynice ideas such as improvements on integrated circuits, or development of laser technologyor high tensile fibers or what have you. Their incentive then becomes nil for wanting togive this secret up. They have no incentive.Forgetting the topic of UFOs for a moment, let’s just look at the structure of power in theworld in general. What we can see is a silent transformation of the structure of power inwhich privately dominated groups have gotten their hooks into public structures, intopublic institutions. This is exactly what has happened within the UFO topic. The secret hasgone private. It’s not so much classified any longer as it is proprietary. That makes thesecrecy even more profound.Individuals who work in government come out of private finance and industry and they goback to that world when they are done. It’s a revolving door. So, for example, if I as a4-star general were to work with you, a major defense contractor, and we share thistechnology and your corporation holds on to this technology, when I (general) retire, I gethired as a Sr. Vice President and make a lot of money and we’ve got all these ground floorinvestment opportunities. So, that’s how the world of non-UFOs and the world of UFOsworks!Secrecy has twisted and transformed our world in such a profound way. Keeping the secrethas involved a tremendous amount of money. For example, let us assume there is aResearch and Development program in place to study this alien technology. Well, clearly ithas to be hidden from Congress.It’s got to be hidden from every form of legal structure that we have here so it canmaintain its secrecy. And indeed, I was told by one very well-placed source that the costof physical security in all its aspects, securing the secret, was seven to eight times theamount of actual scientific research and development. Why Such Strict Policies of DenialAbout Non-Humans Interacting with Earth?WHAT WOULD YOU SPECULATE IS THE FUNDAMENTAL REASON FOR WHYTHERE SEEMS NOW TO BE A PERPETUATION OF A POLICY OF DENIAL ABOUTSOMETHING SO FUNDAMENTAL ABOUT WE’RE NOT ALONE IN THISUNIVERSE AND THERE ARE OTHER INTELLIGENCES INTERACTING WITHTHIS PLANET?My own opinion is that there are many layers and levels of why this secret is so profoundlyimportant to them. But one practical one, I think, is that – just as you say, it is such afundamental truth. By revealing this truth – if the current U. S. President Barack Obamawere to say that UFOs are real and apparently alien, this is not something where he canmake his statement and then just go away. There is going to be massive follow up andinvestigation of that reality. One of the obvious questions that is going to come up nomatter how brain dead and comatose the U. S. media as a rule has been – there issomething that is unavoidable and that unavoidable question is how the hell did the U. S.media miss this for 60 years? And how did the U. S. and global academic communities missthis for 60 years?Investigating those questions – that’s only the tip of the iceberg, but that gets into acomplete array of illegality and manipulation of what are supposed to be institutions thatanswer to the people. So, that’s one thing right off the bat. In other words, it’s a lie. Thetruth is so fundamental that the lie has had to be just as fundamental to deal with it.Now, there might be something even more profound behind this. We do have, after all, thepresence of other intelligences that are here. Who are these other beings? Are they here tohelp us? Are they here to hinder us? Is it a bunch of factions that are out there? Are we, infact, in the midst of a silent cold war and don’t even know about it? There could be a lot ofthings that if the public were to know might be seen as de-stabilizing, at least in terms ofthe current political structure. That’s always something that’s important.BUT IF DE-STABILIZATION IS ALWAYS THE ARGUMENT ON THE PART OFAUTHORITIES IN GOVERNMENTS, THEN DOESN’T IT MEAN THAT THOSE INAUTHORITY WILL ALWAYS BE PERPETUATING A POLICY OF DENIAL INTOTHE FUTURE AS FAR AS THEY CAN GO BECAUSE THEY DON’T WANT TO DEALWITH THE CONSEQUENCES?Absolutely!ONCE YOU SEE THAT, YOU SAY, ‘WE ARE ON A PLANET THAT IS LIVING A"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"PERPETUAL LIE.’I think one other reason for why this is such an important secret for them to keep has to dowith short term – I’m guessing 20 to 30 years – economic repercussions.For instance, let’s assume that the UFO secret comes out some how. So, we’re going to beasking: what is the power plant of these flying saucers? They are obviously usingsomething really nifty – better than our petroleum. So, whatever it is, whether it’s energyfrom the vacuum of space or some other source that’s phenomenally impressive – that willdo things to the petroleum industry. Then there is the electronics industry and the steelindustry. You can go on and on here.You can argue that in the long term, properly handled, these new technologies would be arevolutionary benefit to mankind and the world. You can certainly make that case. But inthe short term, alien technology would portend to be very economic de-stabilizing. Whoknows what would come out the other end of all this? I think disclosure will bring a greatdeal of uncertainty.I’m sure those individuals who have their grip around the tail of this tiger, they know ifthey let go, there’s a lot of unpredictability up ahead and I don’t think they want that.They want control.WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WOULD TAKE TO LEVERAGE OPEN THE TRUTHABOUT NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCES INTERACTING WITH THE PLANET, NOMATTER WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES, LETTING THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEYMAY?Well, I believe there’s a paradox here. Releasing the UFO secret is both impossible andalso inevitable. It’s really both. It’s impossible in the sense that I’ve been saying that thereis no motivation for those secret-holders to give it up. No motivation that I can see.However, the fact that we are living in the most revolutionary period in all of humanhistory. There is nothing that comes close to the period of time we’re in right now. Anyonelistening to this had better understand how blessed and cursed and lucky and whateverthey are to be living right now because any other time in human history does not compareto what we’re in right now. We’re on a tightrope. If we get to the other side of thistightrope, we’re going to be in for the wildest ride. We’re in the midst of suchtechnological innovation and change and transformation. We’re going to have intelligentcomputers common probably in less than another generation. We are in the process ofprobably reinventing who we are biologically. We’ve cracked the human genetic code.We are, in other words, on the verge of re-inventing ourselves. It’s a significant, majorevent. So, what I believe is that at the end of this process in another 20 to 30 years at themost, our society is going to look so completely different than what it does now.Think about what we’ve gone through in the last 20 years where we go from basically nointernet to a world of absolute, total connectivity in which in your hand you can carry alittle piece of machinery that can contain entire libraries of data and music and videoarchives (laughs) and online streaming and everything else in your little hand.So, in a century, we’ve gone from horses pulling carts to the world we have now. So, we’renot going to stop. Clearly, in such a revolutionary, unstable, transformative period, I amconvinced that something is going to happen. I don’t know what the trigger will be, butsomething is going to happen that’s going to force this issue out into the open. Why Don't Non-Humans PresentThemselves Publicly Beyond Government Denials?RICH, WHY DO YOU THINK THERE HAS NOT BEEN STRAIGHTFORWARDNON-HUMANS PUTTING THEMSELVES DOWN IN ALL OF THE COUNTRIES INBOTH HEMISPHERES IN THE LAST 200 TO 300 YEARS?Well, this is a great question. Unfortunately, all I can do is speculate based on the historyof sightings and encounters that I know about. One thing I know is that there is a longhistory of confrontation between our military as well as militaries of other nations –confrontations between militaries and these UFOs.In other words, there are attempted jet interceptions. There are occasionally cases wherejets have fired missiles at these UFO objects. We know this happened. We have thedocuments to prove it."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"So, there has been trouble in Paradise, so to speak. That’s one issue – like who are thegood guys here? (laughs) It’s hard to say. Are they the good guys or the bad guys? Butthere is some form of confrontation going on. This is something that any kind of truedisclosure of UFOs must confront. Why do our Earth militaries seem to be fighting Them?I don’t know the answer to that. It certainly could be that They are observing us.Here is what I’m quite sure to say. We’re at a point in our history in which we must beintensely interesting to Them – and by ‘Them,’ I mean any intelligence, any group, that hasthe ability to come to look at Earth right now!Our species has probably been in Their world all along, but we’ve been asleep. But now,we’re at a point in our history where we are about to leap into their world. We are about towake up. They must know this.I cannot see any scenario in which the non-human intelligences don’t know this. So, myfeeling is that there is going to be an announcement, some kind of event, I would predictwithin twenty years from now. I have friends and colleagues in this field who think it’sgoing to be much sooner than that, but I think 20 years is a reasonable guess. Why theyhaven’t done it up until now, the only thing I can point to is perhaps the possibility ofexcessive social disruption. Or the non-human fear of social disruption by the humanpower groups. But why the E.T. or alien groups haven't appeared out front and public,that’s something I don’t know. “Entities Not of Our Human Civilization”I WOULD LIKE TO RETURN TO A PARAGRAPH FROM YOUR BOOK ANDSENTENCE, ‘BY 1990, IT LOOKED AS THOUGH SOME UFOS WERE OPERATEDBY ENTITIES NOT OF OUR HUMAN CIVILIZATION.’ I AM CURIOUS, AFTER TENYEARS OF WORKING ON THESE TWO LARGE AND IMPORTANT VOLUMES,WHAT HAS CONVINCED YOU THE MOST THAT WE ARE DEALING WITHENTITIES NOT OF OUR HUMAN CIVILIZATION?You go all the way back to the 1940s and 1950s and we’re dealing with reports oftechnology that is as inexplicable today as it was back then. Objects that did zigzags in thesky near military bases.AND 90-DEGREE ANGLES.Exactly! In the 1940s and could stop in mid-air and take off with instant acceleration.Now, I’d like to know what can do that? And guess what? So did American intelligenceanalysts. They wanted to know. They looked into this matter in the 1940s and 1950s and1960s and 1970s and they never stopped looking at it. And periodically, reports would leakout and we know that reports came out in the 1940s that said, ‘This appears to be aninterplanetary phenomenon.’ That was the phrase that they used back then. And in the1950s, the issue again came to a head with many analysts concluding that this was anextraterrestrial phenomenon and so on through the years. My feeling is that this cannot be explainable as simply Deep Black technology. If it is, weall would need to know: Why are jets chasing them for sixty years?! (laughs) Right? It’sone thing to say we’re testing your defenses, OK? But for 60 years?! Let’s get real here.You know, there is evidence that the phenomenon involves non-human entities becausewe have an enormous mass of witness testimony. People who said, ‘I was taken by beingsthat were not human.’ We’ve got a lot of that. There’s at least something there to delveinto and researchers have done this. So, to just say it’s classified technology – this isabsurd! There’s so much more going on here. Tehran, Iran, September 19, 1976And the data leads, in my view, to an extraterrestrial phenomenon. There’s one UFO case– it’s a famous one and deservedly so that has never left my consciousness as possibly themost significant UFO case that we have. It’s not the Rendlesham case, although I thinkthat’s right up there. The case I’m thinking of would be the 1976 Iranian jet fighterincident that took place over the city of Tehran, Iran.This was back in the days of the Shah when Iran was an ally of the United States. And thereason that I feel this is such a critically important case and that I think any skepticalperson who looks into this case is really going to think twice. The reason is that the case"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"itself is utterly spectacular in that we have U.

Two U.S.-made F-4 Phantom II jet fighters of theImperial Iranian Air Force were scrambled, but as the pilots closed in on the target, theircommunications and weapons systems were suddenly jammed. The incident wasconfirmed by high ranking officers of the Iranian Air Force and later documented byseveral agencies of the U.S. military.During the early morning hours of September 19, 1976, a cylinder-shaped unidentifiedaerial object that gave a radar return the size of “a 707 tanker,” hovered over Tehran, thecapital of Iran. The object was recorded on radar and seen by many eyewitnesses on theground and by the pilots of two American-made F-4 Phantom II jet interceptors flown byImperial Iranian Air Force. As the pilots approached the UFO, their instrumentation andcommunications failed. One of the jets prepared to fire a missile at the UFO, but itselectronic weapons system suddenly jammed. The incident is documented in anow-declassifed October 1976 U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) message with adistribution list that included the White House, Secretary of State, Joint Chiefs of Staff,National Security Agency (NSA), and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

At a Washington D.C. press conference onNovember 12, 2007, Jafari added details that the main object emitted fourobjects, one which he tried unsuccessfully to fire on, another which followedhim back, and one which landed on the desert floor and glowed. Following hisprepared statement at the press conference, Jafari was asked if he believed hehad encountered an alien spacecraft and Pirouzi said he was quite certain thathe had.General Nader Yousefi, the assistant deputy commander of the Iranian AirForce, said he ordered the two jet interceptions. He said that, “Because of theexperience I had on September 19, 1976, I believe there is something upthere.

Yousefi said that after the second F-4 lost itscommunications and weapons systems and took evasive maneuvers, it triedone last pursuit of the UFO.

As theywere approaching to land, Yousefi said the control tower phoned him that theUFO was following the jet back to base. For more details, see: Wikipedia. Richard Dolan: “And we have further confirmation of this case through data from theDSP satellite system, Defense Support Program. This is a U. S. military program that has aseries of geosynchronous satellites in place, one of which detected a UFO over the city ofTehran at exactly the time and date of the incident. In other words, we have a separateconfirmation. This is something I’ve included in my book.And then you’ve got an event that we have to explain. What object in 1976 can disable theelectronic systems of what were then some of the top-of-the-line, best fighter jets in theworld. F-4s were outstanding in their day.Could anyone honestly say that the Soviet Union was playing games over Tehran, Iran, airspace? No one seriously entertains that idea. So, if not the Soviets, then who? This is aquestion that any responsible military historian has to look at, but they have ignored it for33 years, since 1976, this case has been ignored by conventional mainstream historiansand analysts.BECAUSE OUR GOVERNMENT AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS WITH INSIDEKNOWLEDGE DID NOT WANT MEDIA OR RESEARCHERS TO PAY IMPORTANTATTENTION TO A CASE THAT WOULD PROVE NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCEOVER TEHRAN.Absolutely! This is technology that, no matter how you look at it, is revolutionary. Whatcan do such a thing in 1976? That’s an incredible event.
