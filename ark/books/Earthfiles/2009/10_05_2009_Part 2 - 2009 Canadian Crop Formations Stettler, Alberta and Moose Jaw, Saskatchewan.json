The farm owner, Mr. Hicke, was impressed enough with what hefound in his field on Saturday, September 19, to show his family, but then proceeded tocombine the wheat. Before the formation was harvested, Kenn Thomson of Moose Jawwas in his plane and took photographs of the pictogram-type wheat formation similar toEnglish patterns in the early 1990s."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Wheat formation reported September 19, 2009, in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan,Canada.

Almost a month before and some 150 miles northwest in Stettler, Alberta, on August 25,2009, at 7 PM, Colby Squires was running his sprayer to desiccate the wheat farmed byGordon and Brenda Smith.

Aerial image © 2009 by Rob McNeill.Diagram © 2009 by Paul Anderson, CCCRN.Gordon Smith and Colby Squires agreed not talk about the wheat pattern until they hadcombined most of the field. The two men figured people would want to see the unusualwheat formation, so Gordon Smith combined around to preserve the circles and rings.Gordon did talk about the wheat mystery with Donald Tash, M. S., a general scienceteacher in the Stettler high school for twenty-nine years from 1967 until his retirement in1996. Don Tash decided to go see for himself on September 7. He was so impressed that hewent back for measuring equipment and returned to draw a diagram superimposed over anaerial photograph © 2009 by Dwayne Sutton.From the southwestern edge of the ring on left that measures 33 feet diameter (downed wheat forming ringwas 3 feet wide), Don Tash's measurements include 12 feet between that ring and the big ring that measured 5"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"feet in diameter to the southwest, but enlarged to 10 feet in diameter from the red marks northeastward. Thestanding ring around the bull's eye measured 17 feet in diameter and the bull's eye, or central flattened largecircle, measured 38 feet in diameter. The northwestern smaller circle was connected to the large ring by a14-foot-long narrow pathway of about 12 inches and that circle measured 21.5 feet in diameter. Thesoutheastern smaller circle was connected to the large ring by a 16.5-foot-long narrow pathway of about 12inches and that circle measured 16.5 feet in diameter. Measurement diagram by Don Tash.Interview:Donald Tash, M. S., retired science teacher, Stettler, Alberta, Canada: “ I walked infrom the north side, the highway side where Highway 12 runs east and west there. Thegrain had been flattened in a ring and if you walked on through the ring into the very largecenter, or ‘bull's eye,’ that was completely flattened (38 feet diameter). Then to thenorthwest, there was a little circle that had been totally flattened (21.5 feet diameter).Also, in the southeast, there was a smaller circle that had been totally flattened (16.5 feetdiameter). Then to the southwest, there was another ring (33 feet diameter).A FLATTENED RING AROUND STANDING CROP.Yes, everything that you see on that diagram I sent you, all the wheat is standing exceptthe two smaller circles and the big bull’s eye and then the larger ring and smaller ring.Everything else is standing, very cleanly and clearly delineated from the flattened wheat. Icould not see anything in the standing wheat to suggest any part of it had ever moved.COLBY SQUIRES SAID WHEN HE FOUND THE FORMATION AT 7 PM ON AUGUST25, 2009, FROM 16 FEET UP ON TOP OF HIS SPRAYER, HE COULD NOT SEE ANYTRAILS AROUND THE FORMATION.Right. In fact, if you look at the diagram I made, the only alternative tracks to anythingfrom the formation are Colby Squires’ high-clearance sprayer tracks. Counterclockwise and ClockwiseDirections in Stettler FormationCOULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN THE CLOCKWISE AND COUNTERCLOCKWISEDIRECTIONS OF THE WHEAT?CounterclockwiseIn the diagram that I sent you, let’s start with the bull’s eye, the big flat circle I measuredat 38 feet in diameter. The wheat was totally flattened. That wheat is goingcounterclockwise.If we envision the big ring around the bull’s eye, let’s take the first 5 feet all the wayaround that bull’s eye in that big ring. All of that is also flattened counterclockwise.The little ring to the northwest that is approximately 21.5 feet in diameter, that is alsoflattened counterclockwise.ClockwiseNow, let’s go to the small circle in the southeast (16.5 feet diameter), it was exceptionallyflat. It was flattened as if you had taken an iron and flattened it so smooth, it was quitesomething to see. The wheat was put down clockwise in that circle.SO THAT’S THE ONLY PIECE OF THE FORMATION SO FAR THAT WAS PUTDOWN CLOCKWISE?Right, that’s the only piece so far that was clockwise, but let’s go back to the large ringaround the bull’s eye. If you look at the two small circles in the northwest and southeast,there are little 12-inch-wide paths leading from the circles to the ring around the bull’s eye.Extending northward from each of those connecting paths is an additional 5-foot-diametersection added to the 5-foot-ring, making that northern part of the ring around the standingcrop and bull’s eye 10 feet in diameter.SO IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF THAT RING AROUND THE BULL’S EYE, IT ISTWICE AS WIDE ON THAT HALF THAN THE REST OF THE RING.Correct.WHAT IS THE DIRECTION OF LAY IN THAT ADDED SECTION?OK, I said the first 5 feet of the ring all the way around is counterclockwise. But that"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"additional width added to the ring on the northern side, that extra five feet that goesaround from each little circle was going clockwise.SO, CLOCKWISE AND COUNTERCLOCKWISE WHEAT WERE RIGHT NEXT TOEACH OTHER IN THAT WIDENED PART OF THE BIG RING?Right, and it was just so perfect, so seamless. The inside 5-foot-wide ring for 360 degreesaround the standing crop around the bull’s eye was flattened counterclockwise and thatextended part of the ring half way around on the north was perfectly flattened clockwise,no ragged edges or disturbance between the wheat stems right next to each other going inopposite directions. Thin Section of Wheat Put Down Straight,But Covered By Upper Layer Swirling CounterclockwiseRed dots indicate 12-inch-wide, straight path of wheat extending straight southwest fromflattened central “bull's eye” and continuing into the 5-foot-wide ring of flattened wheat goingcounterclockwise. Straight path formed a bottom layer to the counterclockwise ring of wheat on top.Let me tell you something else. Let’s go to the center of the bull’s eye and look straightsouthwest along the line in my diagram. See where my line in the bull’s eye stops at theedge of the standing 17-foot-diameter crop ring as I was going southwest. Well, there wasa tiny path no more than 12 inches wide (red dots) going from the bull’s eye through thestanding wheat to the flattened ring around the standing wheat. All of the wheat in thatlittle path was laying straight southwest along that line I have drawn right to thesouthwestern most edge of that big ring. And the wheat that had been flattened downcounterclockwise in the flattened ring was swirled over the top of the narrow path ofwheat that was laid straight out to the southwest. You could see the little path of straightwheat below the counterclockwise wheat on top. Another Thin Section of Wheat Put Down Straight,But Covered By Upper Layer Swirling ClockwiseIf you go to the little 16.5-foot-diameter circle in the southeast, that little 12-inch pathconnecting it to the big ring was 16.5 feet long and the wheat in that narrow path waslaying straight out from the bull’s eye ring into the flattened circle. And in that circle, thelittle circle’s clockwise grain had been laid over the straight wheat coming southeast fromthe little path.THOSE TWO PLACES WHERE NARROW PATHS WERE UNDERNEATH SWIRLEDWHEAT ON TOP HAD TO HAVE BEEN THE FIRST PLANTS PUT DOWN.Absolutely. Flattened Wheat Stems Uncreased and Unbroken"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"WHEN YOU WERE IN THE FORMATION, DID YOU LOOK AT WHERE THEWHEAT STEMS CAME OUT OF THE GROUND?Yes, I was amazed that I found entire stems coming from the ground flattened that wereperfect without breaks, cracks or creases. Gordon Smith, the farmer, and I talked aboutthat. He said, ‘This is amazing because whatever did that did not disrupt the physicalnature of the stems.’AS IF THE WHEAT HAD SOFTLY COLLAPSED ON TO THE SOIL WITHOUTWRINKLING OR CRACKING.That’s it exactly. Rocks and Soft Dirt ClodsUndisturbed On Top of SoilAnother phenomenon - there were some rocks in that large ring surrounding the bull’s eyethat you could easily push with your finger. By that I mean the rocks could be dislodged soeasily in the very soft soil. So, if something had been dragged to make the formation, itwould have dislodged the rocks and dragged them. But I did not see any rocks dislodged. The other thing I saw in the soil were dirt clods where the openers and seeding equipmenthad opened up the soil. There were a few fist-sized dirt clods and they were totallyundisturbed lying in the big flattened ring around the bull’s eye. I said to Gordon, ‘If thisevent that made this formation had pressure to it on the surface of the soil, those clodswould not have been there.’ They were so soft, they would have fallen apart.THE QUESTION YOU ARE RAISING IS WHATEVER THE PROCESS WAS THATMADE THE STETTLER FORMATION, IT HAD TO BE SO GENTLE THAT DIRTCLODS ON SOFT SOIL WERE UNTOUCHED.Right. And I’ve never seen the wind around here ever leave a lodging signature like thatwheat formation! Scientific Study of Crop FormationsMichigan biophysicist W. C. Levengood who did his Ph.D. graduate work at the Universityof Michigan, all but dissertation, and has several patents for seed development beganstudying crop formations with curiosity in the early 1990s. By 1999, he had examinedenough soil and plant samples from crop formations in the United States, Canada, Europeand Israel to publish his research in the international botany journal, PhysiologiaPlantarum (105:615-624).Biophysicist Levengood wrote: “The findings reported here lend further support to adecade of research with empirical data, which suggests that worldwide crop formationsinvolve organized ion plasma vortices that deliver lower atmosphere energy components ofsufficient magnitude to produce significant bending, expansion and formation of uniqueexpulsion cavities in plant stem pulvini (swelling at base of leaf stalk), as well as significantchanges in seedling development. ... that spinning plasma vortex has a microwavecomponent and complex lower energy ion-electron pulses” that have interacted with manyformation plants he has studied.He also asserts that the energy interaction that creates formations must occur rapidly in afew seconds. Otherwise, he would find evidence of burning or charring from themicrowave heating. But he does not find such damage and the formation plants continue tolive and grow until harvest.Biochemical and biophysical changes that biophysicist Levengood has documented inthousands of plants from crop formations include a combination of swollen and reorientedgrowth nodes, ruptured growth nodes, metabolism changes in plant cells and magnetic ironparticles deposited over the plant surfaces and surrounding soil. 7 PM MTN, August 25, 2009First Wheat Formation Images © 2009 by Toni SquiresStanding 16 Feet Up on Top of Spraying Machine"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Stettler, Alberta, CanadaNote that thin connecting paths to little circles are not visible in these first photographs.Central ring measured 38 feet in diameter by Don Tash, retired Stettler high schoolscience teacher.
