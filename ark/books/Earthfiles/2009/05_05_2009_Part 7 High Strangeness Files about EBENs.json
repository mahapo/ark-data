DiCela - not clear if name of EBEN or planet.2) Does the EBEN planet orbit around Zeta Reticuli 1 or 2? Zeta Reticuli 1.3) How many planets are in the EBEN solar system? Six.4) If EBEN planet is more desert, what is the Tall Nordic's planet like? Much colder, comparable to a difference of 95 degrees F. versus 60 degrees F. on Earth.5) How far away in miles is the Tall Nordic planet from the EBEN planet? No answer.6) Is Earth at issue in the 300-year-war between the EBENs and Tall Nordics?No answer.7) Why are many of the non-human aerial craft round or disc-shaped? Outside of ship spins and causes adhesive distortion. Photons can be absorbed and notreflected.8) What exactly is the propulsion system of the EBEN craft? Nordic craft? No answers.9) Why do the beams of light projected from aerial craft often look fibrous orsparkly? How do the non-humans stop the beams in mid-air? No answers.10) How do the beams pick up mass such as animals and people? No answer.11) How do the EBENs nullify gravity? Is their floating above ground becausenullifying gravity is an easy technology for them? If floating is their preferred state,what do the EBENs use their small feet sheathed in skin similar to hooves? No answers.12) Do EBENs sleep? They sit in a meditative state.13) If the EBENS interact more with the United States, do the Tall Nordics dominatein South America? Or another part of Earth? Are there geopolitical divisions of ourplanet by the competing non-humans? No answers."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"14) Which non-humans interfered with nuclear bases such as Malmstrom AFB in the1960s to 1970s? No answer.15) When UFOs blink off and on, are they jumping space and time? Or are theydistorting light?Deflecting photons - that way human retinas suddenly don't receive photons and craftappears to disappear, even if it is still there.16) Can the EBENs materialize matter from “nothing,” by jumping back and forthbetween parallel universes or dimensions?The EBENs can use their craft to control materialization and dematerialization of matter,and also do “dimensional skipping” like jumping from stone to stone over a river.17) Did the EBENs build the Egyptian pyramids?Yes, EBENS used their craft technology to levitate pyramid stones into position andinspired sciences in much of the Egyptian, Sumerian, Assyrian cultures. Differentiation oflines of force fields only prevalent in pyramids.18) Who interacted with and inspired the Greeks?No answer.19) How do the non-humans go through matter such as walls and windows?The key is frequency of atomic vibrations. The EBENs and Tall Nordics can separatemolecules with energies that affect the atomic level.20) What is the significance of the rotating ring of colored lights around theperimeter of the egg-shaped EBEN craft and the two rotating rings around the topand bottom of the Tall Nordic craft?Form of force field that generates magnetic flux, which can either deflect photons so thecraft can “disappear” or the magnetic flux can be used as a defensive weapon.21) Why do craft beam technologies cause humans to feel as if everything moves intoextreme slow motion? Is Time changed?No answers.22) Did Albert Einstein communicate with Ebe 1 or 2?Yes, in 1951. Einstein did not understand the EBEN physics, but the Ebes understood ourEarth physics and said it did not apply to their planet in the Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2 distantbinary system.23) Is reincarnation real?True, the machinery of the universe.24) Are black holes “doors” between universes?Ye s .25) Is there real potential for Homo sapiens sapiens enslavement by any of thenon-human groups interacting with Earth? Which types have which agendas?There are groups out there that are hostile, but there are other groups that feel aresponsibility to protect Earth humans. [ Editorial Note: I have been told more thanonce that “EBENs have been known to lie.” But no one ever clarifies which non-humangroup has which agenda/s.]26) Is the EBENs who “manipulated DNA in already-evolving primates to createHomo sapiens sapiens?”The EBENs are responsible for creating the evolutionary gap between Neanderthal andCro-Magnon. Other non-humans have also been involved in manipulating genetic changesof Earth life for a very long time.27) What are the various non-human types that have been involved with Earth?– “Iconlas,” or the Tall Nordics. Their feet are short with raised curvature or ball structureunder their little toe. Their religion demands a change of clothes and colors frequently.Long shallow, straight nose with creases on either side. These do have voice boxes thatallow speech, but they are often silent and can communicate telepathically as well as theEBENs.USAF officer says he doesn't know much about the Tall Nordics and doesn't know anyoneelse who seems to have much information about them either. But there has definitely beenmilitary-type encounters between American military and the Talls. The only way MJ-12can keep track of the Tall Nordics is through the EBENs - they can communicate withNordics and then pass on information to MJ-12. But Nordics don't spend much time indirect communication with anyone, even though they are supposed to be able to speakEnglish."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"– “Psys” come from another galaxy beyond the Milky Way Galaxy. USAF source doesn'tknow much about them physically or otherwise, except they landed in Ellicott, Colorado,on October 8, 1983. What happened? No details. The Psys also landed at Wamaru,Australia. And the Psys might have been involved with Bentwaters, England, events inDecember 1980? MJ-12 does not trust the Psys.– “EBENs” (extraterrestrial biological entities), also referred to as “Miecon.” The EBENswere involved with Ezekiel, Fatima, Christ and other religious events on Earth in an effortto reduce human violence and homogenize human thinking where religious eventsoccurred.– “Bowlas,” are 2-foot-tall with pointed ears and big eyes. Scary-looking, but actuallymean no harm. From a planet relatively close to our solar system - Alpha Centauri? Thesewere involved in the Hopkinsville, Kentucky, encounter on August 21, 1955.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Alpha Centauri is the closest star system to theSolar System, being only 1.34 parsecs, or 4.37 light years away from our Sun.It's the brightest star in the southern constellation of Centaurus and anestablished binary star system, Alpha Centauri A and B.”]Small creatures with long, pointed ears and big eyes that frightened theSutton family of Hopkinsville, Kentucky, beginning around 8 PM on August 21, 1955,after the family saw strange lights in the sky near their house anhour earlier. Image source: Stumbleupon.com.– “Terains” and “Mongols,” are the Oriental-looking Men In Black (MIBs) from anothergalaxy that have some kind of alliance with the Psys.– “Cliys,” mechanical, skeletal, tall, 6 - 7 feet, from about 60 light-years from our solarsystem, more intelligent and more powerful than Iconlas? There is a pecking order OutThere.– “Decons,”involved in the Betty and Barney case, 1961, White Mountains of NewHampshire.Ebe 2 said the EBENs knew about fifty other non-human types in this particular universe,implying the EBENs have knowledge of other universes and other intelligences in thoseother universes. Strangely, the USAF officer did not know anything about tall humanoidreptilian types that have been encountered by many eyewitnesses, even at noon outdoorson a sunny day.

Source Wikipedia.Bhutan i s a land-l ocked country i n the eastern Hi mal ayaMountains. China is to the north and India to the south.MJ-12 sent investigators to Bhutan because the country's human blood line is linked toEBEN manipulation of DNA in the Himalayas. Bhutan covers about 16,000 square milesin the eastern Himalaya Mountains between Tibet and India. Its capital is Thimphu. It wasone of the most isolated countries on Earth until the early 1960s because the best road intoBhutan was through the Chumbi Valley and the Natu La pass in Tibet. It required severaldays of difficult travel. As late as the middle of the 20th Century, most Bhutanese (DrukYul or Land of the Thunder Dragon) lived and worked as they had for centuries.According to the USAF officer, the Bhutanese DNA experimentation by the EBENsproduced the Mayan culture that was transported by aerial craft to the what is known inthe modern world as the Yucatan Peninsula region (and beyond in Guatemala, Belize andMexico, El Salvador and western Honduras.) Recent discoveries of Maya occupation atCuello in Belize have been carbon dated to around 2600 BC. This level of occupationincluded monumental structures. The Maya calendar, which is based around the so-calledMesoamerican Long Count calendar, commences on a date equivalent to 11 August, 3114BC., or nearly 5,125 years ago."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"According to the USAF officer, the EBENs removed most of the Mayan “experiment”around 850 A.
