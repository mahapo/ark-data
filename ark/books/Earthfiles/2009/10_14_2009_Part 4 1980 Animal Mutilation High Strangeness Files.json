August 26, 1980 - Ranch of Bill Speaker, 15 miles southeast of Briggsdale,Weld County, Colorado: In grassland pasture 8 miles east and 7.5 miles southof Highway 14, Mrs. Speaker found a 600-pound yearling steer dead andmutilated. He had been dead less than 24 hours because Bill Speaker had seenthe steer alive the day before.a) Right ear had been cut off at the skull bone.b) Right cheek was stripped to the bone, \"as if the bone had beenlying in the sun for months,\" Bill Speaker told me.c) A pear-shaped pattern of hide was removed above the right eye,over right ear and back to right shoulder. Hide excised neatly,leaving lumen and muscle tissue below intact. But Mr. Speaker saidthat blood was oozing up through the muscle tissue and hewondered two things:First, if predators had done this, why didn't they take any meat?Second, if predators had torn the hide off, why didn't the hide showblood? Mr. Speaker told me that the pear-shaped hide removallooked like it had all been removed in one big piece."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"d) The front of the nose and lips were still there, but anapproximate 2-inch-long piece of skin had been peeled away fromthe steer's lower lip.e) Mr. Speaker did not look in the mouth to see if the tongue wasthere.f) Rectum was not touched.g) Tail was in place as far as he can remember.h) There were a lot of cow tracks around the steer as if they hadmilled around the body and kicked up the dirt, but no other tracksand no signs of death struggle from animal.Mr. Speaker is 54-years-old and was born and raise in ranch life. When I askedhim to compare this kill with predator damage, he said, \"Mostly whensomething dies, the coyotes start on the rectum and hollow the body inward.They normally make a hole big enough to crawl inside and eat the inner parts.They don't start with ears. I've never seen an animal peeled bloodlessly like thisone.Predators never touched this animal, not once. I was out there five days afterfinding the steer and not a thing had touched it. Some way whatever is killingthe cows is doing it without any struggle. It's like the cows fall over dead and theskin falls off!\"this was the only mutilation that he is certain he's had. Other cow deaths in thepast have bloated so much that Mr. Speaker thought maybe the cows had splitopen and made holes. But he's not sure what happened.His neighbor, John Baumgartner lives only three-quarters of a mile from thesteer mutilation site, but the steer was on the other side of a knoll that blockedBaumgartner's view and he said he never saw or heard anything unusual. September 1980September 2, 1980 - Eagle Rock Ranch run by Jessie Frazier 10 to 15 milesnorth of Briggsdale: Upside down bull without eyes. And reporter BillJackson's wife saw a bright, white light low in the sky from their house windowin Sterling. Then the light \"blinked out.\"That morning, Jessie Frazier rode up to the chalk bluffs about 3 to 4 miles southof the Wyoming border and 16 miles west of Hereford to separate out the lastremaining bull in his heard of cows pastured in 6the bluffs. He only leaves bullswith the cows for 60 days.Jessie found the 6-year-old bull lying about 35 feet off a 4-wheel-drive road. Thebull was lying flat on its back. The head was straight up and the horns wereembedded in the ground. \"I never found any animal like that ever before,\" Jessietold me. The freshness of the bull's body indicated it had not been dead longerthan September 1st or August 31st.There was no sign of any struggle or tracks of any kind in the soft sand wherethe bull was lying on its back with its horns in the dirt. \"Usually we see signs ofdeath struggle. That bull should at least have thrown that head of his and thosehorns would have dug up the ground. But there was no sign of anything. It's asif that bull was laid down there already dead.\"a) Both eyeballs were removed. Little trickles of blood from botheyes ran down toward the throat and brisket instead of towardhorns, indicating that the eyeballs had to have been removed whenthe bull was in an upright position.b) The tongue had been removed, \"as if you had pulled it out as faras you could and cut it off. Cut looked straight up and down,smooth, not jagged.\"c) Testicle and penis removed (and there is similarity here to theGastonia, North Carolina case where horse's penis was somehowspecifically removed from horse's sheath and abdomen whilepenned in a horse stall.) The bull's foreskin and hide were stillthere, but the penis was missing. Jessie Frazier could not seeanything up in the foreskin hole. Also, on a bull, there is usuallysome long hair at the penis, but on Jessie's bull, it was cut or shaved"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"shorter, straight across.d) Rectum was normal and tail was there. So were both ears intact.e) Frazier never rolled the bull over, but he did check the bull's legsto look for rope burns or hair rubbed off where the big animalmight have been lifted up by something, but the hair was normal.f) No predator activity around the bull that was still untouched,except for some maggots and flies, when a deputy from the WeldCounty, Colorado, Sheriff's office visited the site late the afternoonof September 2, 1980. The bull was the deputy's first animalmutilation investigation and he took a lot of photographs, but didnot say much to Jessie Frazier.Jessie never heard another word from the Weld County Sheriff's office about themutilated bull. Frazier's boss, Virgil Prewett of Cherokee, Oklahoma, called theSheriff's office and talked to someone there for a long time, but no answers.Prewett felt blown off by the Sheriff's office and that really upset both him andFrazier.Frazier said that a lot of helicopters were flying around from the Cheyenne,Wyoming AFB and that a lot of chopper night missions go on over his ranch.Interesting comparison between Frazier's bull mutilation and predator attack. Aweek after Jessie found his bull dead, one of his cows died a natural death. Thenext day, the coyotes had torn into her down to the bone. But coyotes never didtouch the bull's body.Jessie also had coyotes attack one of his calves once while it was still alive andthe coyotes chewed into the young animal's rectum. There was blood all over theplace, Frazier told me, but there wasn't a drop of blood anywhere on the bullexcept for the small trickles from both eyes. [ NOTE: There was also a strangetrickle from the Robert Blake horse in Colorado Springs that showed up onlyunder black light. With the black light off, nothing showed on the horse's hair.]September 5, 1980 - Hereford, Colorado, 4:30 AM: Two ladies travelingaround 4:30 AM near Hereford, Colorado, saw red and green lights about 1/2mile east of town or about 10 miles NW of Grover and they were \"reallyscared.\" They called the Weld County Sheriff's office. A Sheriff's deputy saw thelights from 14 miles away and contacted nearby AF near Cheyenne, but the airforce said there was nothing on radar.Another Grover, Colorado incident happened in 1976. A farmer was out in hiswheat field at night and was scared so much by something that went over him inthe sky that the farmer hid under a tractor and won't go back in that field atnight ever again.September 13, 1980 - Granger, Polk County, Iowa: Calf \"shot andmutilated.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"DesMoines Register, Saturday, September 13, 1980, Des Moines, Iowa.The problem with alleged bullet holes is my own firsthand experience at theBateman ranch in Colorado (next case). I met the deputy and rancher in the fieldwhere the mutilated heifer was and watched the deputy stick a pencil from hispocket down into a dry, bloodless, quarter-inch-wide by about 2-inch-deep holein the right side of the heifer's neck near the shoulder. We all could see that thepencil did not go in the hole very far. And yet, the deputy said it \"probably was abullet hole\" and a local newspaper wrote up the mutilation as a gun shot deathwithout ever reporting the truth, which was that no bullet was ever found.September 16, 1980 - Loveland, Colorado, Ken and Wilma Bateman'sKen-Wil Ranch, mutilated Angus heifer: On September 16, 1980, while atwork in my office at KMGH-TV, Channel 7, the news room received a teletypemessage:MUTILATION(LOVELAND) -- AN ANGUS HEIFER HAS BEEN DISCOVEREDM UTI LATED O N A RANCH WEST O F LO VELAND, AND THE RANCH'SOWNER SAYS HE'S WORRIED. OWNER KENNETH BATEMAN SAYSHE FOUND THE HEIFER ON A ROCK LEDGE THAT MOST VEHICLESCOULDN'T GET TO. AFTER FINDING THE REMAINS ON SUNDAY,BATEMAN REPORTED THE MUTILATION TO THE LARIMERCOUNTY, COLORADO SHERIFF'S OFFICE, AND DEPUTY TOMREITZ SAID IN A SUBSEQUENT REPORT THAT THE HEIFER HADDIED OF AN UNKNOWN CAUSE - \"POSSIBLY A GUNSHOT\" -- ANDTHAT A REAR SECTION OF THE ANIMAL HAD BEEN REMOVED.- - - DASH - -BATEMAN SAYS HE GUESSES THE HEIFER DIED SOMETIMEEARLY LAST WEEK. ACCORDING TO BATEMAN, THERE WAS ASMALL PERFORATION IN THE SHOULDER OF THE COW, BUT NOBLOOD OR ANIMAL TRACKS ANYWHERE IN THE AREA. HEESTIMATED THAT AN 11-INCH HOLE HAD BEEN CUT IN THE REARPARTS OF THE HEIFER. BATEMAN REPORTED THAT COYOTES,MAGPIES AND OTHER SCAVENGERS ARE PLENTIFUL IN THEAREA, BUT HE SAYS, \"THIS IS WEIRD. THE ANIMALS WON'TTO UCH HER. \"KMGH news reporter Dan Dennison asked me to fly with him in the Channel 7"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"helicopter to the Bateman ranch in Loveland located not far south of theintersection of Highways 34 and 29. We flew to the mutilation site over a hillfrom the Bateman ranch house, about 4 miles SW of Big Thompson Canyon.Ken Bateman has 42 head of cows in the particular grazing pasture where hisheifer was found dead and mutilated. The pasture is fenced and locked at twogates. Ken checks on them three to four times a week. The cattle there eat nativemountain grass supplemented by hay that Ken delivers to them.First thing Ken Bateman told us was that a man named Dave Lorenz wasfishing in Pine Wood Resort west of the mutilation site when Lorenz heardcattle bellowing and thought he heard a cow or calf in distress where the Angusheifer was found dead and mutilated. Lorenz said he saw three orange lights inthe pasture area.Ken Bateman also had a heifer disappear two weeks ago and has not been ableto find it. Each young animal was worth about $1,000 because each wasartificially inseminated from top bulls to produce the Angus heifers. KenBateman has been ranching his Loveland spread since 1976 and has never had amutilation before.Ken knew the Angus heifer was alive on September 8, 1980, because he hadcattle buyers in and this heifer was considered in the top 5% to 10% of hisheifers. The heifer was discovered dead on September 11, three days later, byRon Hill, foreman on a neighboring ranch. Ron Hill only saw the heifer's bodyfrom a distance, did not know it was mutilated, but called Bateman about itThursday evening, September 11.Ken Bateman got to the carcass on Saturday morning, September 13, 1980.Scene description: All black Angus heifer lying about 50 feet from a canal andabout 5 feet from a small, 2-foot-wide spring running across the pasture. Shewas lying on a slant with her head down hill. Her whole tail was cut off at thetail bone. No blood anywhere. Ken said the rectum was cored out in a \"perfectlyround hole\" 10 to 12 inches wide that went deep inside revealing also that theheifer's sex organs had been removed. There was a puncture wound in her leftshoulder about 1/4\" wide and about 2 inches deep.The calf was lying on her right side and in this case unlike most animalmutilations, her ears, eyes and tongue were all there. On the ground about 6 to 8feet from the heifer's body, Ken found two patches of the heifer's hair. Therewere no other cuts, tears or signs of natural predators around. \"To ourknowledge, no predators touched her,\" said Ken Bateman.There was a bush flattened about 12 feet from the animal's back. The lowestbranches of the flattened bush appeared very black, as if charred.The next day on Sunday, September 14, 1980, Larimer County Sheriff Jim Blackin Fort Collins asked his deputy, Mike Blanchard, to investigate. Sheriff Blackalso sent out three Colorado State University pathology students to look at theheifer's dead and mutilated body. The deputy thought the bush was black simplyfrom age?The students said it was predator and the deputy said the shoulder wound was\"probably a bullet,\" and officially summarized the case as prankster and/orpredator damage.But Ken turned the heifer over to see if a bullet or arrow had gone through her,but there was no sign of an exit hole or puncture. Further, on Tuesday,September 16, that evening Ken Bateman opened up the dead heifer's shoulderpuncture before he and his son buried the calf. They found no muscle damageunderneath, only the 2-inch puncture hole, and no mark of any kind on theunderlying bone. So, there was definitely no bullet, regardless of the perfunctorypronouncement by the deputy.This Angus heifer weighed 450 pounds, was still nursing her mother andBateman thought it very unusual that the heifer could be separated from themother. The heifer calf was found in a rocky area that the other cows, includingthe calf's mother, would not go near after the calf died there. The mother cowbawled from a distance, but would not go near her calf.September 16, 1980 - Roland Ball ranch 5 miles west of Briggsdale, WeldCounty, Colorado: Same day I flew up to Loveland to see the Ken Batemanheifer, Roland Ball found two of his 350 to 400 pound steer calves dead andmutilated. On that Tuesday, Roland and his 20-year-old son were riding in theirPawnee grass pasture about 4 miles west and 1.5 miles north of Briggsdale.Father and son had been rounding up cows to move to another pasture because"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"of a government-mandate by the Crow Valley Livestock Association to rotateanimals. About 3/4 of a mile off the road, Roland discovered the first calf thathe estimated had been dead two days.His son found a second calf about 1.5 miles further west in a straight line thatthey estimated had been dead about 5 days and was much further deterioratedthan the calf Roland found. The rancher estimated that calf had been dead for atleast five days based on deterioration, but there was no bloat. One ear had beencut out deep into the skull, the tail had been cut off at the tailbone and hide hadbeen removed from a back ankle. Strangely, all the tendons beneath the hidewere untouched. That confused Roland Ball because if it had been a normalpredator bite, there would have been evidence of torn tendons.In the furthest east and freshest mutilated calf:a) Tongue was cut in a straight, up and down cutwhere the tongue is thickest in back of throat.b) \"Perfect 4-inch circle\" cut out of belly, includingnaval. Only hide was taken; no muscle issue wastouched. There were not even flies or maggots and nopredators had touched the carcass.c) No blood anywhere on animal or ground.d) The 4-inch circle of hide excised from the belly didnot change color as it got older, as normal cow tissuewould. Weld County Sheriff Andrews cut out aportion of the circle toward the rear legs for analysisand the next day his cut had turned brown. But themutilator's circle remained whitish-pink.\"When a critter is skinned, the muscle tissueunderneath the hide is more white than red or pink,\"Roland told me.e) On the back of the neck at the left of the spine, thesheriff found two holes about 2 inches apart and aswide as \"a lead pencil, about 1/4-inch.\" SheriffAndrews specifically looked for small puncture holesafter hearing about the Ken Bateman heifer having asmall hole in her left shoulder.f) There was liquid on the ground close along thecalf's belly in the grass that was blood red, but thinnerthan blood, and it did not evaporate and did not soakinto the ground. Both Sheriff Andrews and IonaHoeppner, a science teacher at local Briggsdale HighSchool, took liquid samples for analysis.g) Some flesh was gone from the rectum, but not assmooth as other mutilations. \"You might have thoughtit was predator ate there, but no predator ever touchedthat calf,\" insisted Roland.h) The tail switch hair was removed and scatteredaround the calf some distance away. The tail itself wasnot cut.i) The calf's eyes were intact, but Mrs. Hoeppner cutboth eyeballs out for study because \"they were dryingup like a prune\" and she thought they should havestayed whole longer. She took her lab samples onThursday, September 18, two days after the calveswere discovered.j) \"There was no bloat at all.\"k) There were no signs of disturbance in the grassaround the calf.IMPORTANT NOTE: On Thursday night, in the dark, the Ballstook Iona Hoeppner out to the pasture to take samples from thefreshest calf. Mrs. Hoeppner took samples from eyes, skin and fluidsamples from the red liquid on the ground and went immediatelyto her high school lab to analyze. She worked at the school lab untilabout midnight, locked the lab and went home."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Iona Hoeppner told me, \"During the night, someone with a key orlock pick got into the lab, ransacked it, took every mutilated calfsample and some formalin preservation fluid. They knew what theywere looking for.\" The school superintendent did not want anyoneto know what happened and to this day, only the authorities and theBalls and I have been told.Continued in Part 5 - My interview with Iona HoeppnerReturn to Part 1More Information:For further information about worldwide animal mutilations, please see EarthfilesArchive for ten years of reports (a few titles listed below).
