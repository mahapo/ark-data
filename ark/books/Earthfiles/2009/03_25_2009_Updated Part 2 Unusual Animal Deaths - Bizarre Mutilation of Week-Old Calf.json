Two days later on the morning of Tuesday, March 17, in Hoehne,Colorado - about fifteen miles northeast of Trinidad and about 40 miles east of MikeDuran’s place - rancher Tom Miller was stunned to find a 1-week-old male calf next to thefeed bin dead and so bizarrely mutilated that it might be unique in animal mutilationhistory. In all the mutilation cases I have investigated, I don't think I've ever seen anythinglike this one."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"On Tuesday morning, March 17, rancher Tom Miller picked up the strangely mutilated,bloodless carcass of a 1-week-old male calf from beside the feed bin and placed what was leftof the body on his flatbed truck, shown above.

Botheyes and the tongue remained, which is also unusual, since the majority of animalmutilations include the removal of at least one ear and one eye along with the removal ofthe tongue and jaw flesh.On Tuesday, March 17, 2009, after the grotesque mutilation of the 1-week-old male calfwas discovered, rancher Tom Miller placed the calf's remains on his flatbed truck, droveinto a garage and locked the doors so nothing could get to the calf's carcass during thenight. Then on Wednesday afternoon, March 18, investigator Chuck Zukowski arrived andphotographed the remains. Chuck Zukowski is a trained El Paso County, Colorado,Reserve Deputy Sheriff, whose full time profession is designing micro chips. Chuck alsoapplies his technical knowledge to field investigations for the Mutual UFO Network(MUFON). Chuck confirmed for me that when he examined the ear tissue, it was hardened“like plastic.”Chuck cut out both ear excision tissues and hand-delivered them to the Colorado StateUniversity Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories in Fort Collins for analysis. As soon as thereare test results, I will report further about the extraordinary calf mutilation atEarthfiles.com and in an Earthfiles podcast.Tom Miller has been ranching on the same land for at least fifty years and told me he hasnever seen anything like it. He said natural predators would leave a bloody, torn mess.There is no sign of blood anywhere on what is left of the week-old-calf. Further, Mr.Miller told me the calf’s mother was extremely protective of her calf and would not let"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"anyone near him.Interview:Tom Miller, Owner and Rancher, River Valley Ranch, Hoehne, Colorado: “My cowsare so protective of their calves. Sometimes you can’t touch the calf without that bigmomma cow being on top of you. That’s a strange part of it, too. Sometimes I have todoctor my little calves and I’ve got to be real careful and real quick to go at that calf anddoctor it quickly before that cow is on top of me. So, how did this happen without the cowbeing just right in the mutilator’s face? That’s a strange thing.WHAT WAS THE CONDITION OF THE MOTHER COW THAT MORNING WHENYOU FOUND THE COMPLETELY EVISCERATED YOUNG CALF?Well, she was real excited and she was bellowing. Actually, all of my cows were runningaround and usually they don’t do that. Whenever I bring feed, they are all right there at thetrough. But this morning (Tuesday, March 17, 2009), they were all running back and forthlike they had been spooked.HOW MANY COWS IN YOUR HERD?There’s about 80 head out there.SO 80 COWS WERE VERY AGITATED ON THE MORNING THAT YOU FOUND THEEVISCERATED CALF AND THE MOTHER WAS ESPECIALLY BELLERING ANDA G I TATAT E D .That’s right.HOW DID YOU CALM THE MOTHER DOWN?I don’t know if I really did much. After I fed them, most of them came back and startedeating. But the mother of the mutilated calf was still going around bellowing. Later in theday, she was still there after all the rest of the cows had left, she was still standing rightthere where I found the calf. Actually, it was pretty sad to see her there. She was justbellowing and didn’t know what happened to her calf.AND COULD SMELL THE CALF PROBABLY THERE.I think so because the mother was standing just at the spot where the calf had been.”Feed bin where 1-week-old male calf was found dead and mutilatedon Tuesday morning, March 17, 2009. Image © 2009 by Chuck Zukowski.How did anyone, or anything, get this calf without a fight with the mother cow? And howdid that 1-week-old calf end up dead with most of his body gone without blood, right nextto the feed bin, far from his mother and the herd?Because the calf’s pelvis bones were broken, Tom Miller wondered if the calf had beendropped from the air to the ground. This was the third mutilation on his ranch since the1980s when Tom first found a 500-pound steer with both ears, eyes, tongue and some of its"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"sex organs removed. His second mutilation was another young steer in 1998 in which bothears, eyes, tongue, and genitals were removed. And now the 1-week-old male calf inMarch 2009. The bloodless, trackless nature of each animal death leaves Tom Miller’smind open to the possibility that the perpetrators are not humans.Tom Miller: “If there really are those aliens or whatever they are out there and they arecoming down, why are they mutilating calves and other animals? Why would they just takeportions of the calf? What do they do with it? There are a lot of questions I have.WHY WOULD THEY DROP ANY OF THE ANIMALS THAT APPEAR TO CLEARLYBE DROPPED BACK TO THE PASTURE OR THE FEED LOT OR WHEREVER ITWAS FROM WHICH IT WAS TAKEN? IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS NON-HUMAN,WHY ARE THEY RETURNING ANY OF THE MUTILATED ANIMALS TO BEFOUND?Yes, that’s true. And with mine, they dropped it where I could purposefully see it. Youknow, the mutilated calf could have been down in the river somewhere in the brush and Imight never have found it. But it was dropped right where I had to see it. I couldn’t getaround the feed bin without seeing it. Now, whether that was an accident or if it was onpurpose, it’s strange. I've never seen anything like what happened to that little calf.IF SOMETHING OUT THERE WANTS HUMANS TO PAY ATTENTION TO THEIRINTRUSIONS, INTERACTIONS, WITH EARTH LIFE, WHY?Yes, why? Why do they do this just to animals? Or maybe they do take humans, too? Idon’t know. People are gone missing. I’ll always be thinking of this, you know - is it goingto happen again tomorrow? Or the next day? Or next week?”The Day After Roswell © 1997by U. S. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso, now deceased.Available at: Amazon.com.Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso - retired from the United States Army and now deceased - wrote inhis 1997 book, The Day After Roswell:“In the Pentagon from 1961 to 1963, I reviewed field reports from local andstate police agencies about the discoveries of dead cattle whose carcasseslooked as though they had been systematically mutilated and there werereports from people who claimed to have been abducted by aliens andexperimented on. ... Our intelligence organizations ... believed that the cattlemutilations that could not be obviously explained away as pranks, predators,or ritual slaughter, were the results of interventions by extraterrestrials whowere harvesting specific organs - or harvesting for experimentation.”Historically, when there have been animal mutilations in one geographic region, theremight be several more over the next few months.
