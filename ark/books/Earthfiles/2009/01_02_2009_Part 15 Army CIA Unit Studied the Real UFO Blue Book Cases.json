Nixon said he broughtus in to the FBI and USAF meeting to see that 16mm film of the UFO.” - “Stein,” Former Army/CIA UFO Analyst Return to Part 1Return to Part 14January 2, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - My June 29, 1998, interview with Stein athis Florida home continues from Part 14, in which he describes in more detail a Fall 1958meeting about the UFO phenomenon in the White House's Oval Office with Vice PresidentRichard Nixon and personnel from the United States Air Force (USAF) and the FederalBureau of Investigation (FBI).Richard Milhous Nixon,V. Pres. for 34th President, Dwight D. Eisenhower,January 20, 1953 – January 20, 1961;and 37th American President,January 20, 1969 – August 9, 1974.“WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER THAT NIXON SPECIFICALLY SAID ABOUT THEUFO PHENOMENON?Nixon asked Anthony Barden and me about how many foreign reports there were and ifany of the CIA spies in the Soviet Union had seen any reports about contacts with aliens.We said, ‘Yes, they have,’ and we told them about an incident with the aliens that almosttriggered a nuclear war. A saucer craft was hovering over one of the silos for their rocketlaunching facility in the Soviet Union and all the switches turned on after the aliensinterfered with the electrical fields. The engineers tried to shut off the switches, but theswitches would not shut off.WHAT YEAR?Early 1959 probably because I think we were at the White House for the second meetingwhen the cherry blossoms were out in Washington, D. C. – like late March or April.DID YOU HAVE THREE MEETINGS IN WASHINGTON, D. C.?Yes, but the first one was cancelled.THAT’S WHEN YOU WENT TO THE CIA LIBRARY?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Ye s .[ Editor's Note: In previous Earthfiles reports of my long 1998 discussionswith Stein, he referred to the “Langley CIA” in what had become a genericname for the agency by then. The Central Intelligence Agency was created onSeptember 18, 1947, by President Harry S. Truman's National Security Act of1947. The CIA replaced the National Intelligence Authority (NIA) and theCentral Intelligence Group (CIG). At first, the newly created CIA personnelmoved into 2430 E Street N. W. that had housed the OSS (Office of StrategicServices) during World War II in a low-lying region of northwest Washington,D. C., known as Foggy Bottom.Original 1948 sign on theCIA's first offices in the OSS building onE Street N. W. in Washington, D.C.The Office of Strategic Services (OSS) occupied this2430 E Street N. W. building in Washington, D. C., during World War II.With the creation of the post-war Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) onSeptember 18, 1947, the CIA moved into the OSS building.As the CIA grew, it spread into three dozen CIA offices scattered around thenation's capitol. On August 4, 1955, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed abill authorizing $46 million for construction of a CIA headquarters building.On November 3, 1959, the cornerstone and time capsule were placed in thenew Langley, Virginia, CIA headquarters. ] THE SECOND MEETING WAS ONLY WITH VICE PRESIDENT NIXON?Yes. The third was with President Eisenhower and Nixon together in the spring of 1959.LET’S GO TO THE MEETING WITH NIXON WITHOUT THE PRESIDENT. WHENWA S T H AT ?It was cold. It had to be like November or December of 1958.WERE YOU WITH ANTHONY BARDEN?Yes, the two of us went together.WERE YOU MADE TO SIGN ANY SPECIFIC NON-DISCLOSURE OATH IN ORDERTO GET THE TOP SECRET WHITE HOUSE SECURITY CLEARANCE?Yes. We had to sign an oath that we would follow all the procedures and rules andregulations about handling classified material to the length of the classification, kind of ageneralized oath for handling classified materials.DID IT HAVE ANYTHING ABOUT PUNISHMENT IF YOU TALKED?Yes, that you would be arrested and put on trial for passing on classified materials."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"YOU TOLD ME YOU THOUGHT AFTER 35 YEARS, YOUR OATH WOULD BELIFTED?Yes, when I started working with cryptography, that had a non-disclosure limit of 35 yearsrelated to cryptography classified materials. Also, when we started the CIA Project BlueBook study of international photographs and films or sketches, our non-disclosureagreement was for 35 years.THAT ENDED WHEN?1995. Getting Into White House Oval Office MeetingWHAT WAS THE PROCESS TO GET INTO THE WHITE HOUSE?We flew up on Eastern Airlines from our southeastern military base to Washington, D. C.We were picked up there at the airport and taken to a hotel around 5 PM in Langley,Virginia.THE NEXT MORNING, WHAT HAPPENED?Anthony had called CIA headquarters regarding transportation to get to the White House.They sent one of the CIA black limousines for us. The CIA had its own cars like that fortransportation for executives and people who visited in work. The limos were busy all thetime.WERE THE CARS MARKED IN ANY WAY?No, there was a sticker on the windshield, which I believe did say in small print, ‘CIA,’ andhad a code number across the bottom of the windshield. That determined for the WhiteHouse guards that it was an authorized vehicle to enter the White House grounds.WHAT WERE THE PLATES LIKE?Government plates.IT’S FALL 1958?Yes. When they picked us up at the airport, they kept the small suitcase we had of theclassified materials we wanted to show Nixon. That way, we could go to the hotel, check inwith our suitcase of personal clothes and leave the classified materials in the back of theCIA limo. It was a small suitcase about twice the size of a normal briefcase that we carriedclassified materials in while we traveled.WHAT WAS IN THE SUITCASE ?Foreign photographs of alien craft that we were working on and anything that we couldshow as examples of the UFO phenomenon internationally.THE PHOTOGRAPHS WERE ALL OF DISCS? ANY BEINGS?All discs and the one triangle from Belgium.WAS THE TRIANGLE A NEW PHOTOGRAPH THEN IN THE FALL OF 1958?Yes, it was probably a month old at that time.SO THE BRIEFCASE OF MATERIALS YOU ARE TAKING TO VICE PRESIDENTNIXON IS IN THE BACK OF THE LIMOUSINE. WHEN YOU GOT TO THE WHITEHOUSE, WHAT KIND OF SECURITY CHECK DID YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH?First, the limo was stopped and the driver had to show his I. D. The White House securityguards also checked the I. D. on the limo windshield. Then we had to pull the limo aheadand roll down our windows so that security could check both of our I. D.s. Then the driverpulled the limo up to the side entrance and we went up to the door. There were guardsthere and we had to show our I. D. again.Then we had to open the briefcase so they could check inside to make sure we weren’tcarrying a bomb into the White House, you know? That was the bomb test. (laughs)Then we came in and walked down a long corridor and got into the Oval Office area where"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"we waited in a small room right off the Oval Office. We told the guard there that we had anappointment and he went to check with the appointment secretary. The appointmentsecretary went inside the Oval Office to talk directly to Nixon. Then the guard took us intothe Oval Office. Nixon got up from his desk and introduced us to a CIA head from thesoutheastern U. S. in charge of using CIA field agents overseas to check Project Blue Bookcases. Then he introduced USAF and FBI people. Nixon did not name them all. He namedonly the heads, not all of us. My boss introduced me. We went to set down and there werenot enough chairs. Nixon was irritated and said he would probably have to go to Congressto get more chairs (laughs). Then a security guard was sent for two more chairs and theybrought in their two security chairs.WHY WOULD THE FBI HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN WHITE HOUSE MEETINGSABOUT UFOS?Apparently because they had investigated some sightings in the local U. S. I know the localUSAF interviewed eyewitnesses and asked the FBI to investigate as well.THE USAF WOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE FBI BECAUSE WHY?J. Edgar Hoover – UFOs were like a pet project for him.HE WAS VERY INTERESTED?Yes. At first Hoover thought it was some kind of national conspiracy produced by Sovietsor South America. He was very interested from a national security point of view. Hooverwas not at the meetings, but he always met with the President, Vice President and his FBIagents who were at the meetings. I think that Eisenhower and Hoover were reasonablyclose. Both were very outspoken men, both rough and gruff, cut you right off in the middleof a sentence. But apparently Eisenhower thought that Hoover had been very efficient overthe years and did a good job.WHAT WAS THE REASON FOR THE MEETING WITH NIXON?That meeting was for a progress report about our new CIA Project Blue Book study ofinternational UFO phenomenon incidents and aerial photographs. We reported to Nixonabout the worldwide situation – what we had on UFO sightings. There were also peoplethere in the meeting from the USAF and FBI who had all the domestic Americaninformation reports. That’s the only meeting I attended in which the FBI was present withus. That morning, the FBI had begun a 9 AM meeting with Nixon before us. They weresupposed to be done before our meeting began at 10 AM, but Nixon called us in as theywere finishing up. 16mm Film Screened in Oval Office of UFO“Materializing” Over Power PlantNixon had to go somewhere the next morning (and was cramming as much discussion inbefore he left). To finish their meeting with Vice President Nixon, the FBI had a short filmabout a saucer materializing over a power station. Nixon said he brought us in to the FBIand USAF meeting to see that 16mm film of the UFO.DID NIXON OR ANYONE TALK WHILE THE FILM WAS SCREENED?No, we just watched it. There was no soundtrack, it was only silent. The USAF Colonelwho was there said before it started that he was going to show an actual film of a saucercraft materializing over a power plant. Nixon said, ‘Materializing?!’ And the USAF Colonelsaid, ‘Well, wait until you see the film.’ The Colonel said he wouldn’t say more about thefilm because it would be self-explanatory when we saw it. The Colonel had the lights shutoff and he started the projector.IN THE OVAL OFFICE, WHERE WOULD THEY WATCH A 16MM FILM?The USAF Colonel had a portable projector that folded down into a suitcase. You opened itup and the reel arms rotated out to put film reels on. There was also a little portable screen.DID THE AIR FORCE COLONEL SET UP THE SCREEN?It was already set up in a back corner of the Oval Office and we had to pull some drapesshut so it was more dark in there.WHERE DID NIXON GO TO WATCH THE FILM?He sat right at his desk because he could see it from there. The rest of us had to turn our"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"chairs around because the screen was almost directly behind us.DID THE AIR FORCE COLONEL MAKE ANY PREPARATORY REMARKS?He said it was a new film and it was taken by an amateur photographer on his moviecamera. He said the film was self-explanatory and we would look at the film first and thentalk about it.So he turned the film on and we watched. It was a power station. You could see the smokestacks and steam going up and then you could see a little, white cloud that developed overthe power station.WAS THE FILM COLOR?Yes. It was a blue sky. You could see the smoke from the smokestack. Then about fifty feetto the right of that, you could see the little cloud developing and getting bigger and bigger.Pretty soon, the cloud got more round and then in the cloud itself you could see littleporthole windows as it was turning. It still looked like a cloud at that point. Then as it gotlarger, the craft got more silver colored and then you could not see the cloud. The silvercraft was all you could see. The bottom of the craft turned a reddish or pinkish color andthen it started moving slowly away. Nixon: “This is a helluva thing!”That was the end of the film. Nixon said, ‘This is a helluva thing!’ Nixon swore an awful lot– almost every other word was a cuss word. He said, ‘I can’t believe this. This saucerdevelops and flies away!’ Then he asked if we had any information about where the craftcame from. No one had any information.Then Nixon said, ‘This would be a helluva thing in a war. They could materialize over anypower station and you would have saucer craft all over the Earth.’ Then Nixon asked, ‘Doyou think there were aliens in the materializing saucer craft?’ The USAF and FBI guys toldNixon they had no idea. There was discussion about whether it was a remote-controlledcraft with no beings in it. But we had no way of telling. It did look like one of the smalleralien craft at Area 51.BUT NONE OF THE CRAFT YOU DESCRIBED AT AREA 51 HAD PORTHOLES INIT, RIGHT?No, no portholes at Area 51. But in the White House meeting, the USAF Colonel made thecomment that the craft over the power plant looked like a smaller alien craft. If that weretrue, then it was not exactly like the alien craft at Area 51 that Anthony and I saw. But theUSAF and FBI might have had other photographs of small alien craft that had portholes.Nixon asked us for an explanation and Anthony said, ‘We have no idea how anything doesthis. Perhaps the aliens have some way of taking the electrical current from the power plantand changing it into matter to be able to manifest the craft.’ You could not see through thecraft. It looked solid. It was not transparent. We didn’t have any radar reports and therewasn’t any record of radar showing it near the power plant, but it looked shiny silver andsolid like a regular UFO.I spoke up and said, ‘Mr. Vice President, I think they came from far away and transportedthemselves here and don’t have to go through the problem of going through time and space.I think they are moving point-to-point and can be here almost instantly.’ Disc and Two Non-HumansLanded Near Butte, MontanaWe also went over photographs of a saucer that landed and alien beings got out at theAnaconda Copper Mine near Butte, Montana. Nixon said a saucer craft had landed nearthe Anaconda Copper Mine in Butte, Montana, and aliens had gotten out and someone hadsnapped photographs of the aliens. It looked like the aliens were picking up ore samplesfrom the ground and taking them back into the craft. Then, the craft hovered slightly abovethe ground and took off rapidly. It was out of sight in only a second or two![ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “The Anaconda Copper Mine's undergroundBerkeley Mine was located on a prominent copper vein that extended to thesoutheast from the main Anaconda vein system. Open pit mining operationsbegan in July 1955, near the Berkeley Mineshaft. The open-pit style of mining"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"superseded underground operations because it was far more economical andmuch less dangerous than underground mining.Anaconda Copper open pit mining operations began in July 1955, near Butte, Montana.“ Ultimately, about one billion tons of copper ore and other metals were minedfrom the Berkeley Pit. The Anaconda Company bought the homes, businessesand schools of the working-class communities of Meaderville, East Butte, andMcQueen, east of the pit site. Many of these homes were either destroyed,buried, or moved to the southern end of Butte after residents werecompensated market value for their lost property.” ] DID YOU RECOGNIZE THE MONTANA CRAFT AS ANYTHING LIKE THE CRAFTYOU SAW AT AREA 51?It was similar to the alien craft we saw at Area 51, the bigger, silver craft.DID YOU HAVE PHOTOGRAPH BLOW-UPS FOR THE MEETING? OR ONLY THEORIGINAL PHOTOS?Yes, they had some blow-ups. But the photos were taken by a resident who had a cheap,small camera. And when you blow up low quality photos, the blowups aren’t much help.COLOR?No, black and white?WHAT WERE YOU SEEING IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS?There were two aliens outside the craft and it looked like they were picking up somethingoff the ground like rock or ore samples. In another photo, the beings were headed back intothe craft. Another photo was the craft taking off. Another picture was real blurry like thecraft had just sped away leaving streaks from the craft in the picture. With a cheap cameralike that, it would not have any controlled shutter speed, so something that was really fastwould be only a blur.COULD YOU SEE ANY DETAILS ABOUT THE ALIEN TYPES?No, it was too far away. But you could see they were wearing some kind of flight suit thatwas silver in color. They had something like a helmet over their heads.HOW WOULD YOU COMPARE THE CRAFT IN THE ANACONDA MINE PHOTOSTO THE CRAFT YOU SAW AT AREA 51 IN MID-AUGUST 1958?It looked just like the biggest alien craft that we saw at Area 51 that was a silver disc.WITH A LITTLE CUPOLA ON TOP?Yes, it had a small raised top. This one, too, had the three round nodules on the bottom ofit, which looked like little radar domes."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Photograph at 9 AM, December 13, 1952, by George Adamski at Palomar Gardens,California, through his 6-inch telescope. Source: Page 65,Inside the Space Ships © 1955 by George Adamski.DURING THE PRESENTATION OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS FROM MONTANA, DIDTHE USAF, FBI OR NIXON MAKE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THE BEINGS ORCRAFT?They referred to it as an ‘alien craft.’ Nixon was familiar with that from seeing photographsand other briefings.DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT THE PHOTO COMMENTS?The discussion was between the USAF and Nixon in regard to those particular photographsbecause the Air Force had investigated that particular sighting and interviewed theresidents who took the photos.WHAT KIND OF QUESTIONS DID NIXON HAVE?He asked if the people who took the photographs said anything that might help us betterunderstand the event. The eyewitnesses told the usual story: they had seen the craft in thesky, went into their house to get the camera, went back out and saw the craft had landedand they took photos. So time had elapsed between their seeing the disc in the sky andwhen they finally got their camera back outside because the craft had already landed andthe alien beings were already picking up samples and going to the craft to leave.DID NIXON SAY ANYTHING LIKE, ‘THIS LOOKS LIKE THE DISC WE HAVEPHOTOGRAPHS IN ANOTHER CASE?No, he didn’t. When we were in our meeting, we talked to him about the Montana disclooking like the biggest craft we saw at Area 51. Nixon told us that he recognized it, too,and thought it was the same type of craft.NIXON SAID THAT?Ye s .THEN DID NIXON SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE GERMAN DISCS?No. Nixon never brought that up at the meeting. All the photographs we had to show himwere alien type craft, not German. At that Fall 1958 meeting with Nixon, we did not seeany photographs of aerial discs that resembled any German craft. We knew the Montanacraft was not a German model, but was like the craft identified as ‘alien’ at Area 51.DID NIXON HAVE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT GERMAN DISCS?Yes, he did. We mentioned that we saw the seven discs in the Area 51 cave hangar and werecognized them as Vril and Haunebu I and II. Nixon already knew Area 51 had someGerman craft.Nixon wanted to know if anyone had found out any more information about where thealiens came from and what they were doing. The USAF and the FBI always had the samestory: ‘We really don’t know. We think that the aliens are not hostile. We had no hostileencounters with weapons or shooting at airplanes after we lost airplanes to the aliens andtheir saucer craft technology in the 1940s.’[ Editor’s Note: This is contradicted by Leonard Stringfield, long-time UFOinvestigator living near Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, who said he was secretlytold that the USAF had lost so many planes and pilots trying to shoot discs"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"down from the 1940s to the mid-1950s, that finally a shoot-down policy wasrescinded.] Nixon Frustrated by Lack of AnswersAbout UFO PhenomenonAfter the USAF and FBI left the Oval Office meeting, Nixon said, ‘Boy, I guess we haven’tgained a thing. Have you people learned anything more?’ We told him what we had, but itwas nothing outstanding either.BUT YOU HAD BEEN TO AREA 51 AND ENCOUNTERED THE GREY BEING.Oh, yes. Nixon knew we had been to Area 51.DID HE KNOW ALL ABOUT THE CRAFT AND THE BEING?Yes, he knew exactly what was there. We asked Nixon if he had ever been to Area 51. Hetold us, ‘No, but they brought me photographs of the craft and alien.’ He said he hadreceived a complete rundown from an officer who had been to Area 51 several times andNixon knew about the classified Blackbird project test flying out of Area 51. So, yes, hehad a rundown of the whole shot about what was at Area 51.Nixon also asked us if we had any answers from the alien about where it was from.Anthony told him the number and really long name that was supposed to be some kind ofplanet. Nixon said that was the same story they had gotten from the beginning.We asked Nixon how long the being had been at Area 51? We wondered if it was since the1940s? Nixon said it wasn’t in the 1940s, but that the USAF had told him the being hadbeen at Area 51 ‘a good while.’I said to Nixon, ‘Do you mean that when you asked how long the alien had been there,they didn’t tell you exactly?’Nixon said that the officer that brought the material to him at the White House did notknow exactly how long that particular alien had been there, but thought it was aconsiderably long time. Nixon said, ‘I hate that when people talk to me like this!‘Considerable time’ could be thirty years or six months!’BUT NIXON WAS VICE PRESIDENT THEN. COULDN'T HE HAVE ASKED, ‘WHENEXACTLY WAS THIS BEING PUT IN THIS BUILDING?’Right. It was like for some reason the authorities at Area 51 really did not want to tellNixon. I don’t know why the big secret about how long that alien had been at Area 51. Itseems like the length of time should not be that big of a thing. But they wouldn’t tell us,either, when Anthony and I and the other CIA guys were at Area 51 in August 1958.Nixon said to us, ‘When your trip to Area 51 was arranged, Ike set all this up and OK’d allof this because you were supposed to get a thorough tour at Area 51.’ Nixon asked us howlong we were there and we told him we had only ten minutes with the alien. Then Nixonsaid, ‘This is B. S.! Your Area 51 tour was supposed to be extensive.’Then Nixon asked us, ‘Did you inspect the craft? If a craft like those at Area 51 landedoverseas, did you get a close-up look at them so you could really tell if there was a match?’We told Nixon, ‘No, they just took us down the walkway and didn’t let us go beyond theropes.’Nixon said, ‘If you want to know the truth, I think we’re both on the outside looking in onthis thing and they tell us whatever they damn well please!’BUT WHO IS THE ‘THEY’?The USAF and the people running Area 51. I think it was a civilian who actually ran Area51.WHO?I have no idea. Names were never mentioned about who was actually in charge. We hadasked who was in charge of Area 51 and the alien operation when we were on the August1958 tour. Col. Jim would not say anything except, ‘I’m in charge of your tour.’ ThatColonel gave us the minimum information possible and we told Nixon that."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"BUT IF THE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT HAD SET UP FOR YOU ALL ATTHE CIA TO GO ON A THOROUGH TOUR AT AREA 51 TO SEE ALIENS AND ANALIEN BEING TO FACILITATE CIA INVESTIGATIONS OF THE UFOPHENOMENON, WHY WOULD YOU HAVE NOT BEEN TAKEN INTO EVERYSINGLE CRAFT AND TOLD EVERY DETAIL KNOWN ABOUT THE ALIENS?That’s what Nixon expected. And I imagine when Nixon told President Eisenhower, he wasprobably pretty upset. He got very upset whenever his orders were not precisely actedupon. He just blew his stack. But we never heard anything more about the issue.Then the third and last meeting in which I participated, it was with both Eisenhower andNixon in the spring of 1959. In that meeting, nothing was said about our trip to Area 51.We only covered current UFO issues with President Eisenhower for about a half-hour.”Dwight David Eisenhower,1st Supreme Allied Commander Europe and34th American President, January 20, 1953 – January 20, 1961.
