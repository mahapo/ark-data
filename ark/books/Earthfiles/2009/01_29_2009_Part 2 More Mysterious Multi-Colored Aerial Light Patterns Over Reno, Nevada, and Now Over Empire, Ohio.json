Image © 2009 by Robert Maxwell.Return to Part 1January 29, 2009 Empire, Ohio - Between Christmas 2008 and the first week of January2009, Penny saw the sparkling object projecting colorful patterns in the sky south of herReno, Nevada, home again and she is going to try more photographing.During those same days and nights a long way to the east in Empire, Ohio, at the SammisCoal Power Plant on the Ohio River, is the security guard I call Sarah. I interviewed herabout the triangle craft and glowing pod that she saw there on October 23, 2008. Sincethen, Sarah has seen many more and different strange, aerial objects in the sky. Some aredisc-like craft that project colors and make patterns like those photographed by PennyRubsam in Reno.Sarah tried to photograph one odd, sparkling craft and it dimmed every time she raised hercamera as if conscious Sarah is there trying to photograph.Recently on the night of December 27, 2008, Sarah made a note in her log that at 1:05 AMwhile she was working security with another guard, the two noticed a bright light in the skywest of the Sammis plant.Interview: Sarah, Security Guard, Empire and Stratton, Ohio: “I stopped the truck and got outand was looking at it. It was a circular-shaped object with the rotating green and blue andwhite and red lights on it. And it just kind of set there and we watched it there for probablyten to twelve minutes.And then at 1:57 AM Eastern (December 27, 2008), I spotted a circular object with therotating lights. It was a little bit east of our Tronto plant and it was over a little town inWest Virginia called New Cumberland. And we sat there and watched it for probablyanother ten minutes.Then at 2:29 AM that same night at the north yard of our power plant – it’s real dark upthere. There’s almost no lights whatsoever. And we noticed one circular object that wasjust west of where we were, like northwest of the Sammis power plant. And I tried to get aphotograph of it and every time I would put the camera out to take a picture, the circularobject would fade out. I would put the camera away and the object would get real brightagain. I’d bring the camera out and it would fade away. I even tried just barely moving the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"camera down and as soon as I would move the camera down, the object would appearbright. But as soon as I would go to snap that picture, it would dim down again.We watched it there for probably twenty minutes to a half hour and all that time I tried toget a picture of this object and it was like the object knew I was trying to get a picture of it.ALMOST LIKE A CAT AND MOUSE GAME?Ye s .IN OTHER WORDS, IF I GET THE PICTURE, YOU WOULD RAISE YOUR CAMERAAT SOMETHING THAT WAS BRIGHT IN THE SKY AND INSTANTLY IT WOULDDIM?Ye s .AND YOU GOT THE DISTINCT IMPRESSION THAT WHATEVER THE OBJECT WASIN THE SKY WAS AWARE OF YOU TRYING TO TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS.Oh, yes, it seemed like it was definitely aware that I was trying to take photographs of it.WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT, WHAT KIND OF RESIDUE ARE YOU LEFTWITH THAT WHATEVER IS IN THESE LIGHTS IS CONSCIOUS OF YOU TRYINGTO PHOTOGRAPH IT?It makes me a little nervous. I mean, I’m not afraid of it or anything. It just makes me alittle nervous because it’s not the only incident where it wasn’t just that I was trying totake a photograph of it, but one night it was actually following me. January 3, 2009 - Light Pace's Sarah's Security CarPACING YOU IN YOUR SECURITY CAR?Ye s .WHAT HAPPENED THEN?That night there, that was on January 3, 2009. I noticed there was a circular-shaped objectat 2:41 AM Eastern, and it was just directly west of the power plant. I watched it there fora few minutes until it was 2:47 AM. Then I thought I would go further north where it’sdarker to see if I could get a better photograph of it. And I went about one-quarter toone-half mile further north and after a few seconds of me stopping there, the object leftwhere it was at and came to where I was at.So I sat there and watched it for probably until almost 3:05 AM. Then I thought I would goeven further north to where there are no lights. So I left there and went further north andwhen I got there, it was like 3:07 AM. I looked back and the object was where I had justbeen at and within a few seconds, you could just see it. I mean, it went super fast andzipped to where I was at. And I thought, ‘It’s like this thing knows my every move.’Then I thought, ‘I’m going to go south.’ So, I turned back south about three-quarters of amile to a mile. I stopped there and within a few seconds, it zipped to right where I was at. Iwatched it there until around 3:25 AM, and then it moved and went directly over theSammis power plant and it stayed over the top of the power plant until like 3:37 AM. Thenonce it did that, it shot straight up into the sky.” January 3, 2009 Between 7:15 PM and 8 PMRound Aerial Object Changes PatternsEarlier in the evening before Sarah was paced by the circular, aerial object, a resident wholives right on the edge of the Sammis Coal Power Plant between Empire and Stratton,Ohio, also became nervous when a round light in the sky began pulsing different colorsand patterns. Robert Maxwell got his small digital camera and managed to get severalimages, which he noted were “between 7:15 PM and 8 PM Eastern” and some had timesnoted."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Digital image taken at 7:15 PM Eastern, January 3, 2009, Empire, Ohio.Image © 2009 by Robert Maxwell.Digital image taken at 7:15 PM Eastern, January 3, 2009, Empire, Ohio.Image © 2009 by Robert Maxwell."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Cropped digital image taken at 7:22 PM Eastern, January 3, 2009, Empire, Ohio.Image © 2009 by Robert Maxwell.Cropped digital image taken at 7:23 PM Eastern, January 3, 2009, Empire, Ohio.Image © 2009 by Robert Maxwell.Cropped close-up of another image labeled as 7:15 PM, January 3, 2009,Empire, Ohio.
