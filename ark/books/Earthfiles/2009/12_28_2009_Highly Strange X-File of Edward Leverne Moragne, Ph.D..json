It was like they were dormant insuspended animation. But during the night when no one was watching,Number Two got up and went to the other side of Number Three.It was eerie!” - Edward L. Moragne, Ph.D., Physicist December 28, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Twelve years ago on May 8, 1997, Iwas at the Houston, Texas, home of Edward Leverne Moragne, Ph.D., physicist andchemical engineer. Dr. Moragne was born on July 28, 1915, in Somerset, Texas, andreceived an M. S. in Chemical Engineering from Columbia University, New York, in 1941,and his Ph.D. in Physics from Columbia in 1943. Three years later in 1946, Dr. Moragnefounded the Moragne Research & Development Co. in Houston. Dr. Moragne had beenreferenced to me as a scientist who claimed firsthand knowledge of non-human entitieskept at Edwards AFB, California.The story started when longtime UFO investigator and author, Leonard Stringfield,reprinted a report by another UFO investigator, Ron Madeley, who interviewed Edward L.Moragne in Houston on April 11, 1990. Ron Madeley used the pseudonym, “Dr. Epigoni”in place of Dr. Moragne's real name. Epigoni is the name included in Len Stringfield's1991 UFO Crash Retrievals - The Inner Sanctum - Status Report 6. See: 060504Earthfiles.April 11, 1990, excerpt by Ron Madeley:“Dr. Epigoni, as I will call him, is a retired physicist who is nearing 80years in age and in fair, but steadily declining health. His knowledgemight soon follow his name into quiet obscurity, even though he hasworked closely with equally brilliant men - men like J. R. Oppenheimer;Albert Einstein; and Dr. Edward Teller, 'Father' of the hydrogen bomb.As early as 1939, Epigoni was working with the great minds of the day attwo research laboratories in New Jersey. That work eventually led to a U.S. Navy post under the direction of John von Neuman. Epigoni worked atthe top of the Manhattan Project with the development and detonation ofthe atomic bomb and later the first hydrogen bomb.Dr. Epigoni found himself involved in the research end, as opposed to theretrieval end, of crashed flying saucers. During the late 1960s and early1970s, he was part of a team of scientists working at Edwards Air ForceBase on a very special project. According to Epigoni, a flying saucer andits crew landed at Edwards A.F.B. The disc and its occupants were cartedoff to a secure building at the base for evaluation. It then became part ofan ABOVE TOP SECRET project - something he calls ‘Blue Heaven.’”Before I began my May 8, 1997, audiotaped interview with Dr. Moragne with hispermission to use his real name, his wife, Kathryn, gave me a page that I believe Dr.Moragne had assembled to include his August 26, 1969, United States Patent for theinvention of the Electromagnetic Separator. At the top of the page were the words, “TheAmerican College of Research Scientists and The National Science Foundation ofAmerica.” Below was a brief bibliography of his life next to his photograph. There areother photos of the July 16, 1945, first atomic test at White Sands Proving Ground, NewMexico, and photographs of the bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. Thephotographs and patent were followed by words that seemed to relate to perhaps an awardDr. Moragne had once received: “Presented to Edward L. Moragne, Ph.D., for exceptionaltechnology in inventing the electro-magnetic process, which made the atomic bombpossible, and for being one of the thirteen original men who designed, constructed andexploded the first atom bomb on July 16, 1945, at White Sands, New Mexico.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"August 26, 1969, the United States Patent Office certified Patent 3463319for an “Electromagnetic Separator” to E. L. Moragne."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Edward Leverne Moragne, born July 28, 1915, Somerset, Texas.I began my interview with Dr. Moragne at his Houston, Texas, home on May 8, 1997, byquoting from Ron Madeley's report: “Epigoni said that in the late 1960s and early 1970s,he was head of a scientific team working at Edwards AFB on a very special DOD project,which involved a flying saucer and its crew that landed at Edwards AFB. It landednorthwest of the base in a flat part and a door opened and the ‘guys’ described ashumanoids walked out and laid down on the ground. All of a sudden, the stairway closedback up and the legs (of craft) closed back up and the spacecraft sat back down on theground. The humanoids just laid there until the disk and its occupants were carted off to asecure building on the base for scientific evaluation.”I S T H AT W H AT Y O U R E M E M B E R ?Howe May 8, 1997, Interview with Edward Leverne Moragne, Ph.D.: “Well, that'strue pretty much. But the legs didn't fold up. The stairway they came down slid back upand closed. Our military people tried every way in the world to get into that spacecraft.They even took electronic torches that use hydrogen and active bromides and electricity totry to cut the metal. But they never could cut it. That crew burned and boiled at that craftfor a week or ten days.FOR A WEEK OR TEN DAYS, OUR MILITARY TRIED TO CUT INTO THESPACECRAFT?Yeah, they tried all different spots along the craft."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"WERE THERE ANY BURN MARKS OR CUTS?No. You couldn't even tell where they were trying to burn that craft!DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THAT CAUSED THE SPACECRAFT AND THEHUMANOIDS TO LAND AT EDWARDS AFB?No, I wasn't out there at that time. I was in Chicago - we were working in the stadium inChicago (Fermi lab).WHEN DID THE SPACECRAFT AND HUMANOIDS LAND AT EDWARDS AFB?Some time around 1964.THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 20 YEARS AFTER THE MANHATTAN PROJECT TODEVELOP THE ATOMIC BOMB?That's right. The thing was that Albert Einstein had a theory that light was the source of allthe laws of physics - that it would tie in with the planets, with the speed of sound, speed oflight, tie in with everything. And if so, why shouldn't light tie in with human beings? Therewould be somewhere that light had something to do with us humans depending upon thegenes we had in our bodies. That's why we had all those medical scientists up thereworking. We were trying to find things in the human system that no one had ever foundbefore. We knew you are producing electricity.IN OUR BODIES?Yes, there is current running through humans. Einstein died (in 1955) still trying to workthat theory out. But I have racks of papers that he and Fermi, myself and (Robert)Oppenheimer worked on. Edward Teller was distant from us always. He was trying to get ahydrogen bomb before we even got the plutonium bomb.DO YOU REMEMBER HOW OLD YOU WERE WHEN THE SPACECRAFT ANDHUMANOIDS LANDED AT EDWARDS AFB?(We calculated he would have been 49-years-old in 1964). I'm pretty sure it was 1964when we got that call from Edwards AFB because I had just bought a new car and theyhad changed the models. It was a Thunderbird and the prettiest car I'd ever seen. It was alow car and I'd gotten a light blue color. I was driving from Chicago. By the way, it didn'tstart at Edwards AFB. It was up there in Nevada in the desert where the big disc landed,out in the boondocks. There were some sheep ranchers that called the U. S. Army at theresearch station there near Las Vegas and told them this big, round thing had landed upthere and they had three men laying on the ground. The ranchers thought they were humanbeings. I still say they were robots. They had no vein system at all. They were just filled upwith liquid.YOU MEAN LIKE A TUBE WITH LIQUID IN IT?They felt like a body, like ours. They had muscle, tendons and everything else that youcould feel. But if you made a slight cut in one, it was like a brownish-looking oil came out.The military tried to sew the cut up in a hurry, but they didn't have to sew it because thecut healed in just a matter of minutes.THE SKIN JOINED TOGETHER WITHOUT A SCAR?Yeah.DID YOU SEE THE BODIES YOURSELF?Yeah. I saw three of the humanoids at first when they were laying on the ground. Themilitary moved the three bodies from the sheep ranch to Edwards AFB. The big disc theymoved to Air Force 5.WHAT IS AIR FORCE 5?In the southern part of Nevada, it's a big, big hangar and the military moved the craft there."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Between Lancaster, California (lower left corner) and Las Vegas, Nevada, are Edwards AFB,China Lake Naval Weapons Center and Fort Irw in Military Reservation. Northwest of Las Vegas isNellis AFB and Nuclear Testing Site. According to Dr. Moragne, the sheep ranch was further northof Nellis AFB, Nevada, and the bodies were transported to Edwards AFB, California,and the big disc was transported to Air Force 5 in southern Nevada.COULD WE GO BACK TO WHEN YOU FIRST SAW THE THREE HUMANOIDS ANDTHE DISC? WHAT WERE THE PHYSICAL FEATURES OF THE BEINGS?Just like us, there wasn't much difference. The three were not identical. There were littledifferences just like people look different.DID THE HUMANOIDS HAVE HAIR?No, not a hair on their head.WERE THE HEADS SHAPED ANY DIFFERENTLY FROM OURS?I didn't think they were any different from ours. Their ears weren't any different from oursthat I could see. I asked several of the doctors around there and they told me, ‘I knowthose beings can hear because they have ears designed for hearing.’ The doctors listenedfor a heartbeat, but they were not allowed to sick any needles into them.DID THE DOCTORS HEAR HEARTBEATS?No. Here's the thing that got me. After the military moved the three humanoid bodies outto Edwards AFB, they were laid out one, two and three. It was like they were dormant insuspended animation. But during the night when no one was watching, Number Two got upand went to the other side of Number Three. It was eerie.WERE THE BODIES LAID OUT ON THE TARMAC AT EDWARDS AFB?No, the sheep rancher found the three bodies laid out on the sandy ground up there in thenorthern Nevada boondocks.DID THE RANCHER OR ANYONE SEE THE BEINGS LEAVE THE BIG DISC ANDLAY DOWN ON THE GROUND?There were two ranchers walking up over a bluff. And just as they got to the bottom, thetwo men saw this big thing coming in for a landing. The men were scared. The way theyexplained it to me was that one guy said, 'Let's run like hell!' But the other said, 'No, juststand still and don't let them know you're afraid. They might be coming out here to meetus. They might hand you a bag of gold or something else. You don't know what they're"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"going to do.'So the two ranchers stayed. They told me the first thing they saw was a stairs came downreal slow and stopped on the ground. One of them said, 'See, they're going to come out.'And three guys came walking down the steps. As soon as the three beings were down onthe ground, they all laid down together and the steps raised back up!And here's another thing, too. When those steps were back up in the craft, the rancherscouldn't see much of a seam anywhere. When I got to look at the disc up close, it was likeyou had drawn a pencil line where the stairs had been. I could not feel a seam anywhere.WHEN DID YOU FIRST SEE THE THREE HUMANOIDS?When I first saw them, they were still on the sheep ranch desert laying on the ground. Thebig disc had been there about five days when I drove there.WHO ASKED YOU TO GO THERE?The man who was in charge of UFOs at Edwards AFB, California.DO YOU REMEMBER ANYTHING ABOUT THE HUMANOID EYES?I pushed the eyelid back a little on one and it didn't look any different from our eyes.DR. MORAGNE, LET ME READ A LITTLE MORE FROM RON MADELY'S 1990INTERVIEW WITH YOU.From Ron Madeley's April 11, 1990, interview with ‘Dr. Epigoni’(Dr. Moragne): “Dr. Epigoni said that the flying saucer was kept in a bighangar. ‘They have guards all around that thing, and I'm talking aboutguards! And there isn't any way you can get through. I don't care whatyou do - they've got all types of security there. You've got four rows ofguards before you get to where the humanoids are kept and twelve damnbig fences electrified.’ Dr. Epigoni said he told a Major General in thehangar that he wanted to feel the craft and see if he could feel anopening. The general told Dr. Epigoni that he could feel if he wanted to,but it's as smooth as it is anywhere else. Dr. Epigoni found there were noseams in the disc craft at all. ‘I figured it had some kind of molecularstructure in which it would open up and when it would close, it wouldreseal itself.’”The military also said you could shine a light down in the ceiling part of the big disc andthey could see three more humanoids sitting in there. I never saw them because I neverclimbed up on the disc to the top to shine a light down inside.BUT I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU EXAMINED THE THREE BEINGS, FELT THEM,AND SAID THEIR EYES WERE LIKE A DOG'S - ONLY ONE COLOR?They were. The eyes had one color with a little pupil in the middle like our eyes. But oureyes have whites around the irises. Those eyes were all one color without white to thesides.THEN THE HUMANOID EYES WERE NOT REALLY HUMAN?Well, they had a pupil like ours. The pupils were a kind of gray color and the rest of theeye was brown.A SOLID BROWN EYE?Yeah. I remember that the humanoids' pupils were a little, grayish-brown tinged thing andin the middle of that pupil was a lens like a cat's eye - a vertical slit.VERTICAL PUPILS. AND NO HAIR?Right.NOSE, MOUTH, TEETH?Yes, same as ours, including teeth.CLOTHES?They had little short pants that were tight-fitting and a tight-fitting top like a leotard with asleeveless weskit over it.WHAT COLOR WAS THEIR SKIN?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"A light tan, light brownish.HOW MANY FINGERS AND TOES?Same as us, and they had fingernails either filed real close or they didn't grow. I don'tknow.BETWEEN 1964 AND 1997, WHERE ARE THOSE BODIES NOW?I've talked with many people who have been out there and studied them. The militarykeeps switching those bodies around and then leave them to see what happens. So far,humans say they have never seen the bodies move, but the bodies return to a particularone, two, three order. Whether one man gets up and lays in a new position or somethinglifts him up and puts him in a different order - the military have never been able to see thathappen.THE HUMANOIDS STILL KEEP MOVING AROUND?Yeah, if you move one and put him over there on the other side where he didn't belong,apparently, he will be back on the other side. WHERE DID EDWARDS AFB KEEP THE HUMANOID BODIES?I think it was called Hangar 8, and as far as I know, the bodies are still there.ANY INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THE CRAFT AND HUMANOIDS CAMEFROM?No.WERE YOU ABLE TO DO ANY RESEARCH IN THE BIG DISC-SHAPEDSPACECRAFT?I put hydrochloric acid, which will etch glass, on the craft's surface. I tried every acid Icould think of and you couldn't see anything - never bothered any part of the craft I tried. Italked to a man who was out there around 1975. He told me the first thing he tried wasdifferent acids and never say any impact on the craft's surface at all.“ I put hydrofluoric acid, which will etch glass, on the craft's surface. I tried every acid Icould think of and you couldn't see anything - never bothered any part of the craft I tried. Italked to a man who was out there around 1975. He told me the first thing he tried wasdifferent acids and never saw any impact on the craft's surface at all.”HOW LONG DID YOU GET TO WORK WITH THE SPACECRAFT?About six weeks.” Continued in Part 2.More Information:For further information about “Dr. Epigoni,” please see Earthfiles Archive:• 01/26/2005 — Final Part 28: UFO Crash/Retrievals: The Inner Sanctum - Status Report VI ©July 1991 by Leonard H.
