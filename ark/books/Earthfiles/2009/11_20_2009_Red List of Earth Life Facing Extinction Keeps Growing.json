K.This crescent sliver of Earth's South Pole was photographedon November 12, 2009, by Rosetta, a European Space Agencyspacecraft, from about 400,000 miles away. November 19, 2009 Cambridge, England - This past spring, the United NationsEnvironment Program declared 2010 to be the Year of Biodiversity. The goal is to unite 40international organizations to assess the loss of biodiversity on Earth now and what to doin the future to keep Earth life from dying out in the face of climate change, loss ofhabitats and onslaughts from pesticides and other toxins in the environment. The 2010Year of Biodiversity slogan is “Life in harmony, into the future.” But earlier this month, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) issuedits second 2009 Red List of endangered species at risk of extinction. At least 1 in 3amphibians, more than 1 in 5 known mammals, over a quarter of reptiles and 70% ofplants are facing extinction now. And one animal that's been on the Red List has now goneextinct in the wild. That's the Kihansi spray toad of southern Tanzania."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Kihansi spray toad of southern Tanzania w as declared extinctin the wild in 2009.

Image by Julie Larsen Maher,Wildlife Conservation Society.Recently I talked about the latest Red List of potential extinctions with biologist CraigHilton-Taylor, Manager of Conservation International (IUCN) based in Cambridge,England.Interview:Craig Hilton-Taylor, Manager, Conservation International Extinction Red List,Cambridge, England: “As of the end of 2009, we have looked at just under 48,000species - that's 47,677 to be precise. So, we haven't looked at all species in the world.There are over two million species out there that have been described. So, we have onlylooked at the tip of the iceberg of species. But of those, nearly 17,000 are threatened withextinction - so quite a high percentage are threatened with extinction.IS THIS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF POTENTIAL EXTINCTIONS THAT YOU HAVEEVER REPORTED ON THE RED LIST?This is the highest number. Ever since we have been doing the Red List, the numbers goup every year. They don't ever go down. But there are lots of changes in the list. So, it'snot just that the numbers are going up. What we're also seeing is the movement betweenthe categories. There are species that were listed as vulnerable five years ago that are nowlisted as endangered or critically endangered. So, even within the categories, things aregetting worse. They (threatened categories) are all facing mass extinctions. We arecertainly looking at an extinction crisis where things are accelerating and it's an out ofcontrol stage. 1 Out of 3 AmphibiansIs Threatened with ExtinctionWhat we've seen with amphibians is a massive population crash. Lots of amphibian speciesaround the world because of a fungal disease that has been spread around the world - theystill don't know the mechanisms behind that rapid spread and what is making it worse. Wethink there is some interaction with climate change.THAT'S THE CHYTRID FUNGUS?Chytrid fungus, that's correct.IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY, IT IS STILL SPREADING AND IS KILLINGAMPHIBIANS AT AN INCREASING RATE.It is, that's right. So we have many of the zoos around the world are rushing around madlytrying to collect amphibians from the wild that are not infected to bring them ito captivesituations as an insurance policy to keep amphibians going as species in captivity until suchtime that we can find a cure for the fungal disease. Then they can put the captiveamphibians back into the wild again.SO, THE AMPHIBIANS RIGHT NOW ARE FACING THE MOST IMMINENT"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"EXTINCTION CRISIS?Exactly, and one of the species that we listed this year - the Kihansi spray toad, whichcomes from Tanzania and was confined to a very small area - that species we haveofficially declared this year as extinct in the wild. The only animals left are a few sitting insome zoos.IN THE ASSE SSED SP E CIE S, DO YOU INCL UDE THE CORAL S THAT ACCORDINGTO SOME RESEARCH COULD BE COMPLETELY WIPED OUT BY 2050, THAT'SONLY 40 YEARS FROM NOW THAT ALL THE CORALS IN THE OCEANS OF THEWORLD COULD BE GONE?That's correct. Last year, we brought in 800 of the coral species - the warm waterreef-forming coral - the ones that people see in all the diving videos on television and soon. We assessed all of those last year and they came on to the Red List and a very highpercentage of them are threatened and that's all because of ocean warming and oceanacidification. If those trends continue - yes, the future of corals looks very, very bleak.And it's not just the corals themselves. It's all the fish and other organisms that live in thosecoral reefs.BECAUSE THE CORAL REEFS PROVIDE HOMES FOR SO MANY MARINEANIMALS.Exactly, so the effects are going to be enormous if we lose those corals.AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR PHONE CONVERSATION, YOU SAID, 'WAIT UNTILYOU HEAR ABOUT WHAT IS COMING NEXT.'Well, every year, we produce an update of the Red List. In fact, this most recent is thesecond one we've done this year of 2009. Next year, we know we have several big datasets coming in from several different parts of the world looking at different groups ofspecies. Just from the initial look at that information, it's going to show that the picture iseven worse than we think it is now.We think with the chytrid fungus, the reason it's spreading and being as bad as it is, isbecause of some interaction between the fungus and climate change. Conditions arechanging the fungal environment some how and making the fungus more virulent. But wereally don't understand what that relationship is.The in the oceans, there is warming and increased acidity all linked into climate changing.It's very difficult to say it's all climate change because it manifests itself in so manydifferent ways. So, it's very hard when you are assessing the species and can seepopulations going down - it's hard to say that's because of climate change. You tend to pickup on the more immediate things such as disease and changes in the habitat. But what iscausing those changes in habitat are not always 100% clear.BUT THE CORALS WOULD FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF?Corals would certainly, yes. There's a pretty clear case now for the link between climatechange and what is happening with ocean warming and acidification. Chile Vineyards and African ButterfliesForced to Move by Global WarmingRECENTLY I READ A REPORT THAT THE GRAPE GROWERS IN CHILE, THATHAVE MADE SO MANY WONDERFUL WINES, THAT THEY ARE NOW HAVING TOMOVE 500 MILES FURTHER SOUTH (TOWARDS ANTARCTICA) BECAUSE OFCLIMATE CHANGE THAT IS AFFECTING THE DRYNESS AND TEMPERATURE TOKEEP GOOD GROWING CONDITIONS FOR THEIR GRAPES.That's right. And we've tried to do a Red List of butterflies in Europe at the moment. Wehad a check list of butterflies in Europe, but in fact, if you look at that check list and lookat what was in Europe ten years ago and what there is now, butterfly composition ischanging. There are species moving into Europe from Africa as they move northwardbecause of changes in climate. So, we're now having to assess a different set of speciesbecause the butterflies are coming in from an area where they never used to come fromhistorically.WOW, IF YOU HAVE BUTTERFLIES COMING ALL THE WAY FROM AFRICA NOWINTO EUROPE AND THE BUTTERFLIES THAT WERE IN EUROPE - WHERE HAVETHEY GONE? HAVE THEY GONE INTO DENMARK AND FINLAND AND"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"FURTHER NORTH?We're still looking at results. We don't know because it's still an early part of the process,but we aren't quite sure. And the populations of butterflies are also going down, decliningin many parts of Europe. So, we'll have a better idea next year what's happening withthem.And this is the whole challenge now with conservation planning because we have thiswhole network of protective areas such as nature parks and nature reserves around theworld. But are they in the right places for the future conservation of species? If specieshave to move, is there a reserve they can move to? And how do they move there? Are theythe right corridors and places they can travel through safely and get to where they need togo to? So, a lot of conservation planning now is trying to look at future scenarios andsaying, 'Well, if the climate is going to change this way, this is how it's going to have toshift. Do we have a particular area in that site in the future that the species could survivein that area in the future?IT'S AS IF THE ENTIRE PLANET IS BECOMING A MOVING TARGET?Yes, it's a huge challenge in terms of conversion because in many cases, the protectedareas we currently have are going to be in the wrong places completely!”Next up beginning December 7 to 18, 2009, are meetings in Copenhagen, under the192-nation UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), to produce apost-2012 pact to seriously cut back on greenhouse gases that are increasing.The U. S. Department of Energy's Oak Ridge National Laboratory released data in thejournal Nature Geoscience on November 17, 2009, that worldwide carbon dioxidepollution jumped 2% in 2008. It's estimated that 715.3 trillion tons of industrial carbondioxide has been released into the Earth's atmosphere since 1982. The U. S. is responsiblefor about 20 tons of CO2 per person each year and China is at 5.8 tons per person andincreasing.

Coral Reefs Are Dying Out“Unless something very remarkable happens during (Copenhagen) December 2009'sclimate talks, the world's reefs will be reduced to slime-covered rubble by 2050.”- Alex Rogers, Institute of Zoology, London"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Warm water bleaching of coral.Photo by Tyler Smith of Marine Photobank.The future survival of the world's coral reefs is looking so bleak that scientists meeting inCopenhagen, Denmark, in October have proposed storing samples of coral species incryogenic vaults of liquid nitrogen. The idea is to wait out the turbulent global climate tosee if world temperatures stabilize so that the corals could be safely returned to the oceans.Coral reefs are a major source of food, income and protection for about half a billionpeople and provide homes for so many marine creatures.Ironically, the Copenhagen meeting of Global Legislators Organization for a BalancedEnvironment said there is not much chance that world governments will agree to enoughgreenhouse gas cutbacks to prevent the predicted rise in temperatures over this century. Chile's Leading VineyardsPlanting Higher and Further SouthVineyard in Chile's Elqui Valley may be one that is forcedto move southward due to global warming.

As Arctic Sea Ice Melts, Walruses Die"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Arctic walrus resting on ice floe. Image courtesy NOAA.The United States Geological Survey in October 2009, issued a report about acceleratedsea ice melt in the Arctic Chukchi Sea that caused panicked walruses to stampede. 131dead bodies were found near Icy Cape, Alaska on September 14, a “highly unusual” event,according to scientists. Ice floes normally give walruses floating nurseries for their youngpups and places to dive for clams and other marine food. As more and more ice melts,walruses that have been around for at least 15 million years are becoming a threatenedspecies.More Information:For further information about global warming and environmental challenges, please seeEarthfiles Archive (some selected reports below).• 03/30/2009 — European Honey Bee Decline Continues While Aggressive Africanized HoneyBees Attack in Southern U.
