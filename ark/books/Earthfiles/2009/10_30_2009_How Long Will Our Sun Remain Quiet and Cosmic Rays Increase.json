It has nineinstruments onboard that helps it track solar wind and galactic cosmicrays from interstellar space beyond the heliosphere. ACE serves as aspace weather station while in orbit. ACE can provide a one-hour advancewarning of any geomagnetic storms that are caused by coronal mass ejections.Strong solar coronal mass ejections can disrupt radio, TV andtelephone communications on Earth. Logo by NASA. October 30, 2009 Huntsville, Alabama - For twelve years, NASA has had a satellitepositioned a million miles in front of Earth with the sun about 92 million miles beyond. Itsmission has been to study particles that come near Earth from our sun, the solar systemand the galaxy. The satellite is called Advanced Composition Explorer, or ACE, and someof the highly energetic particles ACE has been monitoring are cosmic rays.The number of cosmic rays reaching Earth are lower when the sun is active and has astrong, turbulent magnetic field that interferes with cosmic ray travel. But when the sun isnot active, more cosmic rays reach Earth. The sun is supposed to be in an increasinglyactive period of Solar Cycle 24 with a solar maximum originally expected in 2011 to 2012.But the sun has been abnormally quiet. Scientists have not seen such a persistently lowsunspot number for at least a century. Further, the magnetic field of the sun is at the loweststrength measured in at least 50 years.Beginning six months ago, ACE satellite data showed a rise in cosmic rays reaching Earthfrom the Milky Way galaxy. By now, cosmic ray intensity has increased 19% because oursun is so quiet that its reduced magnetic field isn’t deflecting cosmic rays like it has thepast few decades. If our sun remains quiet, there could be a 30% increase in cosmic raysreaching Earth in the next year or so – an intensity not seen since 1960. Increased cosmicrays can damage electronic systems and even DNA in living creatures."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Galactic cosmic ray intensities are 19% higher for all elementsin last half of 2009.

NASA’s Heliospheric Team Leader, David Hathaway, sayshe cannot find another solar minimum in the past that has acted quite like this one that hasput out only a few sunspots since Solar Cycle 24 officially began at the end of 2008. Oursun is so quiet that solar physicists from around the world gathered in September to discusswhether we are entering a period similar to the Maunder Minimum of 1645 to 1715, whenfor 70 years the sun was spotless and there was a mini-ice age. There was no ACE satellitethen, but measurements of beryllium concentrations in ice layers indicate that during theMaunder Minimum, cosmic rays were 2.5 times what they are now. Dr. Hathaway pointsout that Earth scientists did not start measuring cosmic rays until the beginning of themodern Space Age in the early 1960s, and that for the past five decades, our sun mighthave been unusually active. Also see: 100609Earthfiles Between 1645 and 1715, the Maunder Minimum coincided with a periodof lower-than-average global temperatures. During one 30-year period within theMaunder Minimum, astronomers observed only about 50 sunspots, as opposedto a more typical 40,000–50,000 sunspots in modern times.

It’s the sun’s weakened magneticfields and weakened solar winds that are all related to this Solar Cycle 24 minimum."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Beryllium is produced in the Earth’s upper atmosphere by cosmic rays striking nitrogen inparticular and you find it in ice cores. If you look back at the record, there are significantchanges. But, the amount that you see also depends on the strength and variations of theEarth’s magnetic field.Periods like the Maunder Minimum occupy about 15% of the time. If you looked overthousands of years of Beryllium 10, it looks like 15% of the time, the sun is in this quietstate where it’s not producing sunspots. Given that, we’re about due. And I think that’swhat comes up and why people are actively talking about grand minima like the MaunderMinimum is that if you go by percentages and the fact it has been so active, then we’reabout due (for a long minimum).We don’t have records prior to 1874 that give us details about the sun. Compared to thepast 130 years, our sun now is unprecedented as far as how slow this Solar Cycle 24 istaking off - or not taking off! Understanding the Peculiar2008 - 2009 Solar MinimumThe number of days in 2009 without sunspotsas of October 29, was 232, or 77% of the time the sun was blank.WHEN YOU GET TOGETHER NOW WITH YOUR SOLAR AND HELIOSPHERICCOLLEAGUES, DO YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT THE ODDS ARE RIGHT NOW THATWE COULD BE GOING INTO ANOTHER MAUNDER MINIMUM?It comes up in conversations all the time! (laughs) There is no doubt about it - it’s in theback of our minds!Certainly the Maunder Minimum comes up. We recently had a meeting of 60 or 70 solarand heliospheric physicists from around the world who met on Mount Desert Island inMaine back in late September.September 2009 gathering of solar and heliospheric physics from around the worldon Mount Desert Island, Maine, to discuss “Understanding the Peculiar Solar Minimum.”The title of the meeting was “Understanding the Peculiar Solar Minimum” – meaning thisone! (laughs) The interesting thing is that at one point during that meeting, we took a voteamongst ourselves about how many thought that this Solar Cycle 24 is so peculiar that itwould have a name attached to it, like Maunder Minimum or Dalton Minimum. It was asmall minority that thought that it was that peculiar.The vast majority felt that this is a significant minimum. It’s smaller than anything we haveseen in the 50 years of the Space Age. But it does look like you can go back 100 years orso and find other similar minima.Now, science is not done by voting! (laughs) So, it remains to be seen about what actuallydoes happen in this Solar Cycle 24.These were some of the world’s experts in these areas that concluded – yes, this is a deepsolar minimum, but at this point, we’re not quite ready to say this is so weird that we needto give a name to it – that it’s something we haven’t seen in 200 years.HOW DID YOU VOTE?I didn’t think it was that peculiar. The only peculiar thing I see about it is that it’s soreluctant to get going.Others are talking about the cosmic rays are through the roof. The number of spotless daysis more than we’ve seen in a hundred years. The sun’s poles are weaker than we’ve seen in30 years. Boy! We have a lot of things we’d like to do that require sunspots on the sun tohelp us understand how the sun and solar activity work. And without sunspots, we’re kindof shut down! (laughs)And we also know that at some point, the sun is going to go into another minimum like the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Maunder Minimum, but predicting when – I’m not sure I’m ready to go out on that limb.(laughs) What Happened to 2006 Predictionsof Huge Solar Cycle 24?ISN’T IT ESPECIALLY STRANGE FOR YOU BECAUSE THREE YEARS AGO, ALLTHE PHYSICS OF THE SUN THAT YOU AND NASA AND EVERYBODY ELSE WASUSING WERE ANTICIPATING THAT THIS COULD BE THE BIGGEST SOLARMAXIMUM ON RECORD?There were indications back then. I am writing a paper – it’s on my computer as we speak(laughs) – basically saying that I made a big mistake – myself and Bob Wilson – when wewrote a paper in 2006, suggesting Solar Cycle 24 was going to be a huge cycle based onconditions at that time. The problem we had with our prediction was that it was based on amethod that assumes that we’re near sunspot cycle minimum.We had just previously gone through three or four sunspot cycles that had been only tenyears long each, so for the one in 1996 to 2006, it seemed like a reasonable assumption.But as we now know, we were off by at least two years. And if we take conditions on thesun now, it’s a completely different story. The conditions now – using even that sametechnique from 2006 – says that the next sunspot cycle is going to be half what we thoughtit was back in 2006.Another big prediction in 2006 was based on a dynamo model – a model for how the sunproduces magnetic fields - and it suggested a huge cycle.But there also were people back at that time saying otherwise. A group of colleagues ledby Leif Svalgaard, Ph.D., were looking at the sun’s polar fields and saying even at thatpoint, the sun’s polar fields were significantly weaker than they had been before and thosescientists back then predicted it was going to be a small cycle. How Small Will Solar Cycle 24 Be?Sunspot 1029, a Solar Cycle 24 magnetic disturbance,grew from October 24 to 29 and has reached about 32,000 miles(50,000 kilometers) end-to-end as it heads around to the back side of the sun.According to Spaceweather.com, the number of days in 2009 without sunspotsas of October 29, was 232, or 77% of the time our sun was blank.Image courtesy SOHO/MDI.I’ve come around to that view now. I think there is little doubt in my mind now that we’rein for a small cycle. The big question now is how small? I think most of us are predictingsmall cycles. I think even the techniques I’m using now are suggesting HALF the size ofthe last three or four solar cycles, but my fear is that even that might be too big just fromthe fact that it’s taken so long for this Solar Cycle 24 to really get off the ground and startproducing sunspots.I have no doubt at this point that it’s going to be a little cycle. My current prediction is thatit’s going to be about half of what we’ve seen in the last four solar cycles or so. But in mygut, I feel it’s going to be smaller than that! (laughs) It’s just so slow in taking off and theindicators that we see – both the polar fields and the geomagnetic indicators are lower thananything we’ve seen before."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" No More 2012 Solar Maximum for Cycle 24?ISN’T IT IRONIC THAT THERE HAS BEEN ALL THIS ANTICIPATION OF 2012BECAUSE OF THE CLOSING DOWN OF THE MAYAN CALENDAR AND THEEXPECTATION THAT POSSIBLY SOMETHING ON OR FROM THE SUN ORRELATED TO THE SUN MIGHT IMPACT THE EARTH DURING SOME LARGESOLAR MAXIMUM IN 2012. BUT RIGHT NOW, DOES IT SEEM LIKE THE SUNWILL BE ESPECIALLY QUIET IN 2012?Indeed. In fact, when we came out with the prediction of a big cycle back in 2006, I gotlots of emails from folks. If it was going to be such a big cycle, it should have started in2006 so by 2012, it ought to be at its peak.And at this point, it looks like, ‘No, I don’t think so!’ (laughs) Not at all! I think it’s goingto be a small peak and it’s not going to be in 2012. It’s going to be in 2013. So, I think anyconnection that people might try to make between solar activity and the end of the Mayancalendar cycle is problematic.IN FACT, IN 2012, THE SUN MIGHT BE THE QUIETEST IT HAS BEEN AT A SOLARMAXIMUM FOR 130 OR MORE YEARS?Yes, indeed! It might be. The Mayans never said there were going to be disasters. It’s justthat it’s the end of that cycle and you start another one.IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THE SUN IS BOTH PECULIAR AND UNPREDICTABLE?Yeah, I’d buy that! (laughs) Most definitely! Our Variable SunWHICH IS KIND OF EERIE FOR EARTH LIFE DEPENDENT ON THAT SUN.Yeah, the good thing is that when you look at what we really depend upon, which is theradiant energy from the sun – even over the full extent of the sunspot cycle, that onlyvaries by 1/10th of 1%. So, we’re lucky in that regard. It’s a small change. If it were big, Ithink in terms of evolution, we wouldn’t be here talking about it. But the fact is when itcomes to variable stars, our sun’s variability is tiny. Any big solar variations could reallywreak havoc on our climate and survivability. Our Middle Age Sun Is Getting BrighterIn fact, in the much longer picture looking over billions of years, the sun is getting brighter.The sun now is some 30% brighter as far as the energy it puts out than it was 3.5 or 4billion years ago. This is just part of how stars work. As they burn up the hydrogen in thecore to make helium, the core starts to collapse a bit and heat up and that expands theouter layers and makes the sun brighter.IN THE EVER-INCREASING BRIGHTNESS OF OUR SUN, IT IS HEADED TOBECOMING A RED GIANT AT ITS DEATH, ISN’T IT?Yeah – we’ve got a long time to wait for that – another 4.5 to 5 billion years! But the sun isquite erratic and really hard to predict. I know from very personal experience!” (laughs)Solar scientists are trying to understand how changesin sunspot activity and other solar events can affect Earth in waysthat are indirect, but can have a significant impact.
