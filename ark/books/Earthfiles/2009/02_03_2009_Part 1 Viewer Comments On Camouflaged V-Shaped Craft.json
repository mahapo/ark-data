It teetered as it righted itself and floatedupward to hide in the cloud cover.” - Jacksonville, Florida, resident, 1997 Return to January 8, 2009 Earthfiles, Cape Canaveral, FloridaFebruary 3, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - After my January 8, 2009, Earthfilesreport about the apparent star field camouflage on the huge V-shaped aircraft near CapeCanaveral, Florida, in August 1987, and my follow up news update on the January 29,2009, Coast to Coast AM radio broadcast, I have received more email reports aboutV-shaped craft and other anomalies in which something moving in the sky appears to beusing stars to disguise its location and motion. In this Part 1 Earthfiles are a few forconsideration and I will follow up with more such reports in Part 2. I hope othereyewitnesses will contact me at earthfiles@earthfiles.com.1) Subject: V-shaped craft, Jacksonville, FLDate: January 16, 2009To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“I and a neighbor witnessed a massive V-shaped craft in broad daylight someyears ago (circa 1997) in Jacksonville, Florida - it was identical to the craft onyour site now.One overcast evening, around 5pm, I was watching beautiful lightning streakfrom one side of the sky to the other - it was just prior to a hurricaneapproaching up and just off the coast. One lightning bolt just suddenlystopped. I thought it was strange because all the others were sweeping greatdistances across the sky.Suddenly, a straight line began to materialize where the bolt had ended. Itfilled in until a huge V was visible. Obviously, this lightning had hit thisV-shaped craft and did something to the craft's invisibility device. It teeteredas it righted itself and floated upward to hide in the cloud cover.Each leg of the V was the size of a runway - the size blew me away! Theconstruction was similar to modern buildings - huge panes of reflective panels- and all right angles - nothing round at all - a gigantic V-shaped craft. Nosound. No visible propulsion. The exterior was comprised of two rows ofpanels per side and the size was so huge it made me dizzy as my mind foughtto comprehend what my eyes were seeing.“I was able to make a surprisingly accurate image on my computer.It was gray - almost the same color as the clouds.”Illustration by Jackson, Florida eyewitness."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I yelled for my neighbor and he ran over to see what was going on. I pointedat the object and he uttered ‘Whoa!’ as his jaw dropped. We stood there insilence - totally blown away. Those 30 seconds or so were an eternity.Strangely, just inside my front door was a table with several cameras on it, butI was so startled I didn't even think of it!After being ridiculed by some close friends we told this to - the sighting wasnever mentioned again. Oh, yes - it was for real! Personally, I hope it is a USAsecret craft. However, due to the extreme size - and the hair standing up onthe back of my neck - I think not.” 2) Subject: Star-bottom craft moved across sky in '08, Puget Sound,Wa shingt onDate: January 30, 2009 2:10:02 AM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“I'm listening to you now on C2C, and the description of the craft in Floridaof it hiding in the clouds, and being camouflaged in the sky was nearly theexact description of an event that unfolded before my eyes right after the newyear of 2008, Puget Sound, Washington. I believe that I saw a gigantic craftwith technology to cloak and camouflage and witnessed it hovering over myneighborhood for three entire days and nights before it left on the third day,which I also witnessed. During that time, the weather was very weird, therewere strange phenomena all around, including sounds and flyovers whichseemed to occur in a pattern or on schedule, and the sky took on a personalityof its own.I did not make any report at that time because it seemed so vague, so strange,and I didn't know how to describe what I witnessed. I too, watched the skiesfor a good 2-3 hours when I first saw moving lights in the sky, and all mannerof what I initially thought were planes at first. Then it looked as if these planeswere attaching themselves to something, or docking as it were, like the stuff ofSci Fi television. Right before my very eyes while I was watching, the starsappeared to move with the clouds, and they also appeared to be situateddifferently than they were just moments earlier.The next day I witnessed the same phenomena. I noticed the clouds, whichwere moving very swiftly, had multiple layers to them and the layers appearedto be moving in different directions! And upon further study, they were notmoving smoothly, as if the wind was gently moving them across the sky,rather it appeared to move in a choppy forward manner. It reminded me ofwhen I was on a cruise ship, and how you feel when you're zipping across achoppy sea, kind of stop-start-stop-start. Not the type of fluidity that cloudswould have. But it wasn't across the entire sky, it was a certain rectangulararea that seemed to hover. I got the sense that there was a huge object movingslowly across the sky and was so huge that it was completely covering up theentire Puget Sound.” 3) Subject: V-Craft Spring 2001, La Conchita, Calif.Date: January 29, 2009 11:46:11 PM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“I cannot give you the exact date, but I lived in La Conchita California, andwas staying with my father as he was selling the house. I was outside at about11 PM Pacific. From off the ocean pretty much from the west, I saw a darkobject blocking the stars. I was curious and went inside and grabbed a pair ofRussian made b12 night vision. When I got back outside, I looked up andwhat was coming was BIG, and it came right over La Conchita - no sound. Ithad three lights they were not blinking and all red. This V-shaped craft, once itliterally went over my head, had to be as big as an aircraft carrier. It clearedRincon mountain by no more then a few hundred feet.Think stealth easily 800 feet in length, by 2/3s that wide at the tail. Withoutthe night vision, all you could see was a dark outline and that something wasblocking the stars as it came by, and NO SOUND, not even a whisper. Itcouldn't have been more than 1,400 feet up, because I don't think Rinconmountain is higher then 600 feet, if that. This craft came from the samedirection that I used to see missiles shot off by Vandenburg AFB, but a fewdegrees south. It was also traveling at a VERY slow rate of speed and took"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"about a minute to complete the pass over my head. I watched this for 20minutes from off the ocean until beyond the mountain, minus the few minutesit took me to grab the night vision. I did not see any markings. This craft wassmooth, no breaks, no protrusions.” 4) Subject: Star Field Hiding Triangle-Shaped Craft?Date: February 3, 2009To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“In Grafenwoehr, Germany, in 2002, a friend and I (we were in the Army)were scanning the sky for satellites (for fun) with our night vision scopes inorder to view dimly lit objects. We observed three dim points of light travelingoverhead. I am not sure of the direction of travel — perhaps eastward. Thepoints of light were arranged in a triangle shape. The three lights would appearto be flying in formation except there were no subtle independent movementsof the objects, like aircraft flying in close formation. I am not certain of thealtitude, except it was very high, perhaps low orbit.Both my friend and I thought it was one object. But we thought that wasimpossible because we could see stars in the back ground. The lights were notbright, the intensity no greater than any other dimly lit satellites in the sky. Wecould not see the lights without the aid of the night vision scopes. The scopeswere an/pvs-14 night vision devices.” 5) Subject: Triangular Piece of Black Sky, mid-1960s, Susanville, Calif.Date: January 30, 2009To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“In the mid-1960s when I was in, or just graduated form high school, I was ona high bluff 'inspiration point' just above the town of Susanville, California, ina small convertible at night. The bluff is just at the west of the town, aboundary of the valley below. Stars were out, a quiet wind, beautiful. We(girlfriend and I) noticed a space of sky with no stars develop behind ustoward the west over sparsely populated mountains covered with fir trees, andmove over us and hover at the edge of the open valley. There were no stars ina large dark triangular area with tiny lights at 3 corners. It stayed still for atime and then slowly, quietly backed up and was lost in the mountains behindus.Herlong Army Depot (before it was decommissioned) is at the opposite end ofthe valley, maybe 15 miles in a straight line from our location at that time.” 6) Subject: Moving Piece of Black Sky - 1961, Edmonton, Alberta, CanadaDate: January 30, 2009To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“I was listening to your Coast news report about a gentleman who saw a UFOthat seemed transparent, in as much as there were stars appearing through it.While he was describing the UFO and what he had seen, I thought that hecould well be me describing what I had seen at about 8:10 PM, October 15,1961, except for the ‘stars.’On that evening I was out in the back yard with my telescope and had just thatday been fitted with a new pair of eyeglasses, so I was excited about beingable to see the vast display of stars on a moonless night - no clouds to be seen-no discernable wind - a perfect night for viewing. My location at that timewas Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.Looking up at the sky to pick a spot to aim my telescope, I noticed a patch ofsky that had no stars, which seemed inappropriate considering the sheervolume of stars to be seen everywhere else. Concentrating on this void space,I realized that it was moving. What I saw - or rather didn't see - made it feellike my hair was standing on end. This ‘object,’ if I can call a void space anobject, moved due south from where I first saw it and disappeared off thesouthern horizon a short time later. The object which I only saw as an absenceof stars had no outline, but it was either very huge and high, or relatively smalland low. There was absolutely no sound that I could hear. I had no time totrain my telescope on the object."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"After it had disappeared from view, I went into the house and called thetraffic observers at the airport and asked if they had picked up anythingstrange on their radar. They said that they had not and suggested that I hadseen either a weather balloon or clouds. Neither of these options made anysense whatsoever to me. I made a few notes which I placed in my scrapbook -which I have just retrieved. I guess that I made a few calculations at the timeand estimated that if the object had been at 1000 feet, it would have beenflying at about 300 miles an hour - but I had no way of knowing how high itactually was.At that time there was nobody that I knew that I could give this informationto. All I knew was that I had observed something that I could not rationallyexplain - i.e. an unobserved flying object.A year or so ago, I read that there had been some experimentation in the latesixties with stealth aircraft and I thought that that might explain my sighting -but perfect silence? I have a commercial pilot's licence (did have at that time),and I am, a professional engineer - not subject to being deceived orhallucinations.” 7) Subject: 1981 Dark Moving Sky Object, Sylvania, OhioDate: January 30, 2009To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“My sighting happened around 1981, just west of Toledo, Ohio in a citycalled Sylvania. I can't be exact on the day, but it was in the fallduring the Perseid meteor shower [ Perseids peak August 12 in most years.]It was cold that night and the skywas very clear - no moon. A friend and I were watching the northernsky, but every so often I would spend a few minutes looking to thewest and east. I couldn't see much to the south because of our big tree wehad in the front yard.After a while I became familiar with the visible stars in each direction that Iwouldconcentrate on. But the next time I looked to the west, the stars thatI noticed a few minutes earlier were gone. It was strange to me and itpuzzled me because I knew that the stars had not faded into thehorizon that quickly. It puzzled me for a few minutes and then Iturned my attention back to the north to watch more of the shower.But this was really starting to bug me because about 3 minutes later, Ilooked to the western sky again and low and behold, the stars that weregone a few minutes earlier miraculously had reappeared. Then the moreI looked, I faintly caught the glimpse of something in the sky like adark cloud, but really all that I could see was the silhouette ofsomething against the dark night sky. I really started to focus on thewestern sky and completely ignored what was happening in the northernsky all together. This dark object came closer to us heading dueeast slowly.Finally after about 15 minutes, it was directly above us.This thing was huge! It had to have been at least the size of afootball field in diameter. It was just so dark that I could only makeout certain rough features around the edges. It was roundish, and itwas completely silent. It was just freaky, and as it had appeared, it slowlydrifted off to the east just as it came slowly from the west. I know what I saw.I wasfrightened as well as excited. It was not a plane, cloud, or a figmentof my imagination. This was real!” To be continued in Part 2.Return to January 8, 2009 Earthfiles, Cape Canaveral, FloridaMore Information:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"For further reports about V-shaped, triangular and other unidentified aircraft, please see1999 to 2009 Earthfiles Archive.
