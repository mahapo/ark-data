T., The Extra-Terrestrial.” - U. S. Military Source Return to Part 1May 26, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuing in Part 9 with Linda MoultonHowe's 1983 to 1987 High Strangeness file notes about EBENs and other non-humanentities. The following are interview notes I wrote after a 1984 discussion with a militarysource.On June 18, 1952, the Ebe that had been retrieved from a 1949 crash near Roswell, NewMexico, died of unknown causes. That day, Ebe was traveling with the USAF Captain whobecame a Colonel. The two were en route between USAF bases for meetings withscientists and officials. When Ebe got on the first plane, he told the Colonel he did not feelwell and attributed the illness to food. The two proceeded to the first air force basemeeting and then returned to the Los Alamos, New Mexico, facility where Ebe washoused. Ebe felt much worse and was taken to a hospital where everyone tried to save hislife. His temperature changed. MJ-12 authorities discussed the possibility of sending out aspecific Hertz frequency given by the EBENs for an “SOS” call for help to try to saveEbe, who telepathically communicated that if he could get into an EBEN light beamtechnology, his health could be restored.The USAF Colonel asked attending doctors if Ebe was well enough for him to leave thehospital for awhile to check on options and the doctors thought so. When the Colonelreturned to the hospital, Ebe communicated he was going to die then and was dead infifteen minutes. Before Ebe died, the Colonel hugged him and cried because the USAFofficer had come to love the small creature “with the mind of a thousand men.”The Colonel learned from Ebe how to improve telepathic communication not only withEbe but with some receptive humans. Some of the Colonel's human colleagues wereshocked when they “heard” the Colonel “talking” in their minds. When asked how he didthe telepathy, the Colonel said, “That's something I'll always be grateful to Ebe forteaching me.”This historic event of Ebe's struggle to survive and request to be placed in the EBEN lightbeam technology for rejuvenation is the true story behind the Steve Spielberg script for theJune 11, 1982, first released feature film, E. T., the Extra-Terrestrial."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Original 1983 theatrical posterby John Alvin for E.T., The Extra-Terrestrialdirected by Steven Spielberg, produced by Steven Spielberg andKathleen Kennedy and written by Melissa Mathison.The historic facts were disguised and planted by some conduit from MJ-12 into scriptdevelopment for what became Steven Spielberg's E.

The samekind of back channel planting of ideas based on true, but highly strange facts, was alsoapplied for Spielberg's 1977 Encounters and the 1951 feature film, The Day the EarthStood Still. The MJ-12 goal behind secretly planting some of what they knew was to testpublic reaction.Original theatrical poster for 1977 Close Encountersof the Third Kind (1977) directed by Steven Spielberg,produced by Julia and Michael Phillips, andwritten by Steven Spielberg."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Colorized reprint of the original 1951 posterfor The Day the Earth Stood Still directed by Robert Wise,produced by Julian Blaustein and written by Edmund H. Northallegedly based on a Harry Bates story. For more military intelligenceinformation about Edmund North, please see 121708 Earthfiles in Archive.The same source who described the above Ebe death and Hollywood films used to testpublic reaction on some leaked ideas in the films told me the following: “The EBENswanted to create a living human body that their light beam technology could bring back tolife. The EBENs do that routinely with their own civilization up to a certain age. Theproblem with humans is that the EBEN beam energy can kill the Homo sapiens sapiensbody. So the EBENs created a hybrid by DNA manipulation that was part EBEN and partHomo sapiens sapiens, a “human body” that could survive the EBEN rejuvenation energy.The historic result was the life of Jesus Christ, his death on a cross and resurrection by theEBEN beam technology. What we don't understand is exactly why the EBENS planted theseed of Christian religion with their hybrid, Christ, and probably planted all the otheravatars of history? What do the EBENs want out of the genetic creation and evolution ofhominid primates on Earth going back at least to Homo erectus?”That military source also described his firsthand knowledge about seeing a “very smallEBEN scout ship that had only eight little seats in it. No levers or obvious mechanicalcontrols - only lights. There were grooves embedded in consoles for two 4-fingered handsin which fingertips would interact with light. Above the presumed pilot's chair, there was acircle with four round light tubes or crystals in it. The propulsion system was below andhad a corresponding arrangement of light tubes or crystals as above the pilot's chair.”The military source said the light tube/crystals reminded him of a liquor decanter set.Crystals with no movable parts. One of the crystals had a pyramidal structure inside it. Themilitary source understood that liquid inside the crystal tubes powered the craft, but nohuman mind understood how it worked. The elegant simplicity of the lights, crystal tubesand liquids disappointed MJ-12 authorities and their scientists because there was nothingabout the propulsion system they could understand.He also had seen an EBEN instrument that reminded him of a “bread box” that was blackand had writing all over it that resembled Tibetan script.Tibetan script.The military source said he understood that the Tall Blond craft were bigger and had achair with a console and levers, similar to the Travis Walton case of 1975 near Heber,Arizona, and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in which logger, Travis Walton, was"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"abducted on November 5, 1975. The Tall Blonds are also supposed to have craft that haverecognizable computer consoles. [ See The Walton Experience © 1978 by Travis Walton.]The Walton Experience © 1978 by Travis Walton.The military source also had held what he called an “EBEN camera that captures time andplays it back.” He said it was rectangular, about seven inches long by two inches wide byan inch deep. Solid black, no movable parts. Right in the middle of the black rectangle is acircular glass that reminded him of a lens. But he stressed, “The EBENs don't takephotographs or videotape. The EBENS capture time and play it back, literally.” When Iasked, “But when we photograph with cameras, still or film or video, aren't we alsocapturing time to play back?” He said, “No, the EBEN technology interacts with timelinesand the black object some how stores pieces of time that can be played back in hologramssuspended in the air.” Continued in Part 10Return to Part 1More Information:For further information, please see my books: An Alien Harvest, the 2-volume Glimpsesof Other Realities and my documentaries A Strange Harvest and Strange Harvests 1993now available in DVD format in the Earthfiles Shop.Also, see Earthfiles Archive for dozens of extraterrestrial biological entity case studiesfrom 1999 to 2009.
