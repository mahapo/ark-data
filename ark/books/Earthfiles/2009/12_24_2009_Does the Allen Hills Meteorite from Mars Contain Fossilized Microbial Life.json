Image photographed byKathie Thomas-Keprta at the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas.December 24, 2009 Houston, Texas - On December 27, 1984, a team of U.S. meteoritehunters were searching in Allan Hills, Antarctica, when they discovered a 1.93 kilogram(about 4 pounds) meteorite dubbed “ALH 84001.” The rock is 3.9 billion years old and ananalysis of trapped gases within ALH 84001 was an identical match to the Martianatmosphere that the 1976 Viking landers analyzed. So a new category of meteorites fromMars was confirmed.Twelve years later after its discovery, the Allan Hills meteorite made worldwide headlinesin 1996 when scientists announced the rock might contain microscopic fossils of Martianbacteria. At the time, Kathie Thomas-Keprta, a biochemist and senior scientist atLockheed Martin's Johnson Space Center in Houston, had been studying the crystalstructure and purity of magnetite beads manufactured in a species of Earth-based bacteriacalled magnetotactic, or MV-1. The crystals work like tiny compasses sensitive to theEarth's magnetic field. When terrestrial inorganic magnetites are studied, none have all theproperties displayed in Earth's magnetotactic bacteria.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Magnetotactic bacteria (or MTB) are a class ofbacteria discovered in the 1960s, that exhibit the ability to orient themselvesalong the magnetic field lines of Earth's magnetic field. To perform this task,these bacteria have organelles called magnetosomes that contain magneticcrystals. The biological phenomenon of microorganisms tending to move inresponse to the environment's magnetic characteristics is known asmagnetotaxis, an instance of magnetoception. It is believed to aid theseorganisms in reaching regions of optimal oxygen concentration.]Dr. Keprta then compared the Earth magnetotactic bacteria's magnetite with nearlyidentical magnetite crystals found in the Allan Hills meteorite from Mars. In 2000, shereported, “These populations are identical to each other. And if this Allan Hills rock werea terrestrial rock, there would be no doubt about biogenic activity associated with it. Butbecause it comes from Mars, I'm going to have a lot of doubters!”Doubters came forward with the hypothesis that the magnetite crystals could have resultedfrom thermal decomposition of the carbonate from the meteorite's impact heating.Now nine years later and the recent development of high resolution electron microscopy,new analyses shows that at least 25% of the magnetite crystals embedded in the Allan Hillsmeteorite are chemically consistent with being formed by bacteria. Dr. Keprta and herNASA colleagues announced, “We feel vindicated about our original position that thesestructures are formed by bacteria on Mars.”Interview:Kathie Thomas-Keprta, Ph.D., Senior Scientist, Engineering and Science Contract"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Group, ESCG/Jacobs Technology, NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston,Texas: “There is a new technique that was developed called Focused Ion Beam Microscopy(FIBM). What you do with that is use an ion beam to go into the carbonate. You leave thecarbonate inside its pit (in the meteorite). You use an ion beam and we cut this beautiful,rectangular section right out of the carbonate, lift it out and we can examine it with thetransmission electron microscope.And what is absolutely magnificent it is that I can cut across the rims, cut into theunderlying pit, extract out the carbonate and know exactly where we are cutting, and liftout the entire slab to look at. That way, we preserve all of the spatial relationships of themagnetite and carbonate. You know exactly what you are looking at!K. L. Thomas-Keprta: “Optical images of ALH84001 disk-like carbonates. These disksprecipitated in fractures produced during shock impacts while the meteorite was on Mars. Themajority of these carbonates appear as circular or elliptical features, which range from 10 to 300microns along the major axis. Visually, these have colors that vary from gold to burnt orange in their centers,which are typically surrounded by a thin black-white-black rim. Some carbonates occur as single entitieswhile others are spatially associated and occur in groups of 10s of carbonates (image at far right). The blackrims typically range from 5 to 10 microns in thickness and are composed primarily of nanophase magnetiteembedded in a matrix of Mg-bearing sideritic carbonate while the white bands, typically 10 to15 microns thick, are composed of nearly pure magnesite with minor Ca and nanophase magnetite.”Also, you are not exposing the sample to things like water as we do in older cuttingtechniques. At each step before, you could introduce some level of contamination. We’renot doing any of that now. We can cut the sample out cleanly and place it directly into atransmission electron microscope.Magneto-fossil bacteria on Earth and under water will produce these tiny magnetitecrystals within their bodies. After the organism dies, the magnetite is released from the celland incorporated into the sediment. It's important to remember that the magnetite crystalsin Allan Hills are embedded in the meteorite's carbonate and cannot be earthcontamination.Once incorporated into the sediment, these tiny magnetite crystals – same size, sameshape, same chemistry as what we’re seeing in the Allan Hills carbonates – become part ofthe rock structure and mark the time in which they are fossils of life. Rather than lookingat the whole form that once was alive, we ’re looking at the “bony material” formed by thecreatures. That’s what we’re looking at in the tiny magnetite crystals."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Le ft column Mars Elongated Prismatic Magnetite Crystalsfrom Allan Hills Meteorite: In 2000, transmission Electron microscope (TEM)images on left of elongated prismatic magnetite crystals extracted from the carbonateglobules in Martian meteorite ALH84001. These crystals display a unique morphology:In one orientation they have a rectangular projection and, upon tilting the crystal, theydisplay a hexagonal projection. These crystals also have facets on top and lower edgesof the crystal. This type of morphology is displayed only by certain types of biogenicmagnetite crystals on Earth. In addition, these Martian crystals are composedonly of Fe (iron) and O (oxygen) and have few defects.Right column Earth: In 2000, TEM images of magnetite crystals extractedfrom cells of magnetotactic bacteria strain MV-1 on Earth. In one orientation, the crystalhas a rectangular view and when the crystal is tilted, the crystal appears to have a hexagonalview. These crystals are chemically pure and have few defects. Natural selection in terrestrialmagnetotactic bacteria has optimized the stability and magnetic moment of these crystalsmaking them uniquely identifiable as biological precipitates. The elongated prismaticmagnetites from ALH84001 share these distinctive features. Thus, the presence ofthese prismatic magnetites in Martian meteorite ALH84001 is strong evidencefor life on early Mars. Photographs courtesy NSA/JSC. Latest Allan Hills Meteorite ResearchWe took these new Focused Ion Beam Microscopy observations from Allan Hills and wetook the observations from our heating studies and said, ‘Alright, how do we explain thepresence of these magnetites?’ And then we looked at the other inorganic (thermaldecomposition) hypotheses and we found that they are flawed. So the only hypothesisstanding is the biogenic one.WHICH IS LIFE.Exactly.WHY IS MAGNETITE LINKED TO ORGANIC LIFE?The magnetite crystals on Earth – and we didn’t realize this until the mid-1970s – there arethese organisms called magnetotactic bacteria. That bacteria will produce a chain of theselittle magnetite crystals inside their bodies. What that means is that these crystals are undergenetic or biological control, just like you produce a skeleton in our body and that’s underbiological control and yet, it is a mineral. These tiny magnetite crystals are under geneticcontrol of the cell. What the cell wants to do is make a good magnet because thehypothesis is that the little chain of magnets within the magnetotactic bacteria cells act likea compass for the cells. So the cells can use the Earth’s geomagnetic field lines tomaneuver up and down in a water column based on the cell’s relationship to thesegeomagnetic field lines. The cells can only sense those field lines if they are themselvesmagnets.So, the magnetotactic bacteria will produce crystals of a certain shape and size and in acertain chemical purity to make the best magnets possible."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Were Allan Hills Magnetite CrystalsCreated by Worm-like Structure in Photomicrograph?THE ORGANISM THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN MAKING THE MAGNETITECRYSTALS THAT YOU HAVE STUDIED SO PROFOUNDLY COULD BE IN THATPHOTOMICROGRAPH OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE A WORM THAT DR.MC KAY HAS STUDIED?1996 electron microscope photomicrograph revealed worm-like chain structuresin meteorite fragment of the Allan Hills meteorite (ALH84001), found in Allan Hills,Antarctica on December 27, 1984 by a team of US meteorite hunters from the ANSMET project.Like other members of the group of SNCs (shergottite, nakhlite, chassignite), ALH 84001 isthought to be from Mars. On discovery, its mass was 1.93 kg. It made its way into headlinesworldwide in 1996 when scientists announced that it might contain evidence formicroscopic fossils of Martian bacteria. Photomicrograph providedby the NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas.That’s an interesting tie in. Some of the magnetotactic bacteria have an elongated, thinshape and some are round or spherical. So, on Earth we see there is a wide variety of typesof magnetotactic organisms. They produce different shapes of crystals. But in every case,they are chemically pure because the chemically pure magnetites are better magnets.THAT’S EXACTLY WHAT THIS WORM-LIKE CREATURE COULD BE IN THIS ONEPHOTOMICROGRAPH?It very well might be. We still have a lot of work left to do, particularly on other Martianmeteorites. Dave McKay is our resident SEM, our scanning electron microscope expert.He will be looking for forms and shapes that are similar to biological organisms on Earth.In other words, if we were to fossilize an organism, what would it look like?IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE THAT WORM-LIKE CREATURE.Absolutely. Allan Hills Meteorite and Mars Connection?CAN YOU EXPLAIN FOR A GENERAL AUDIENCE HOW YOU KNOW THAT THEAllan HILLS METEORITE CAME FROM MARS?One of the scientists in our building, Don Bogard, analyzed trapped gases within ameteorite. It turned out that the composition of that gas phase is an identical match to theMartian atmosphere that the Viking landers analyzed. We knew then that we could getmeteorites from Mars.It turns out with Allan Hills that we have been able to analyze the same minerals that weare finding in the other Martian meteorites that we know are from Mars. Also, we wouldexpect because it is a planetary surface, we would expect to see different ages of rocks.Indeed, we have rocks from Mars that span from – in the case of Allan Hills – 3.9 billionyears old all the way down to 165 million years of age. So, the way the minerals are puttogether, the gas phases in the rocks, they all support an origin of Mars.SO THE AUDIENCE CAN GET A MENTAL PICTURE ABOUT HOW THIS MIGHTWORK, LET’S SAY THAT A METEORITE CRASHES IINTO MARS AND THROWSUP SOME ROCKS AND DUST. EVENTUALLY SOME OF THAT MATERIAL MARSGETS INTO AN ORBIT THAT CAN END UP ON EARTH? HOW DOES A ROCK ON"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MARS REACH EARTH?During an impact or collision, the rock has to reach escape velocity, which is 5.5kilometers per second and becomes ejected from the planet’s surface. If it gets closeenough to Earth, that rock will be attracted by the Earth’s gravitational pull.So, we find meteorites all over the Earth’s surface from Mars and from other asteroids andbodies and from the moon as well. In the case of Mars, we find Martian meteorites inAntarctica, Europe, France. You can find them all over the Earth’s surface.IS Allan HILLS THE ONLY MARTIAN METEORITE SO FAR THAT SEEMS TO HAVEFOSSILIZED BACTERIAL LIFE IN IT?No. I think Allan Hills is the best case for fossilized bacteria. It’s the one we’ve looked atthe longest. But there is certainly interesting and compelling evidence for life in otherMartian meteorites as well. If Magnetotactic Bacteria Were OnMars in the Past, Are They Still There Now?IF Allan HILLS, THAT ARRIVED ON EARTH 13,000 YEARS AGO, HAS EVIDENCEOF FOSSILIZED LIFE FROM MARS GOING BACK 3.9 BILLION YEARS AGO, DOYOU THINKTHERE COULD BE LIVING BACTERIA ON MARS TODAY?It is unlikely that once life starts that it’s easy to extinguish, particularly in the case ofmicroorganisms. The Allan Hills Martian meteorite suggests there is evidence for life onancient Mars. If that is true, which I believe we have good evidence to support that, therecould still be life – particularly in the subsurface regions of Mars.IS THERE ANY REASON WHY THE OPPORTUNITY AND SPIRIT ROVERS DIDNOT HAVE MACHINERY TO LOOK FOR AND ANALYZE ORGANIC MATERIALSON MARS?Those rovers were well-equipped to do the job they were sent to Mars to do.THAT WAS AN INORGANIC SEARCH.Right – that was to understand the geology of the planet and to find out whether or notthere had been water on the surface of Mars and I think they have answered thatbeautifully.THAT ANSWER IS DEFINITELY YES.Absolutely!WITH WATER ON MARS, WHATEVER THE TIME LINE, USUALLY WE WOULDASSOCIATE WATER WITH LIFE.And not only water in a solid phase (ice), but water in a liquid phase. As far as we knowon Earth, that is imperative for life to have water in a liquid phase. That has been shown tobe the case on Mars and as well in the Martian meteorites. We have evidence of mineralphases called ‘clays’ in the Martian meteorites and those clays were formed when theminerals came in contact with liquid water.DO SCIENTISTS AGREE ON WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME MARS HAD RUNNINGLIQUID WATER ON ITS SURFACE?We are finding evidence of water-bearing phases in Martian meteorites as recently as 165million years ago. The meteorites we have are like snapshots throughout time. Martianmeteorites range from about 4.5 billion to 165 million years of age. In each time step, wefind evidence for liquid water on Mars. I think that’s fantastic!IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU’LL END UP FINDING A METEORITE THAT CONFIRMSLIQUID WATER ON THE SURFACE OF MARS EVEN MORE RECENTLY THAN 165MILLION YEARS AGO?It would be great! We just have to find that meteorite! (laughs) Ancient Martian Life: Prokaryotic?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"When there was water on Mars, there probably was simple prokaryotic life, which isconsistent with magnetotactic bacteria that we find on Earth. These are simple types oforganisms.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - The prokaryotes are a group of organisms thatlack a cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles. The currentmodel of the evolution of the first living organisms is that these were someform of prokaryotes, which may have evolved out of protobionts.They differfrom the eukaryotes, which have a cell nucleus. Most are unicellular, but afew prokaryotes such as myxobacteria have multicellular stages in their lifecycles. The prokaryotes are divided into two domains: the bacteria and thearchaea. Archaea were recognized as a domain of life in 1990. Theseorganisms were originally thought to live only in inhospitable conditions suchas extremes of temperature, pH and radiation, but have since been found in alltypes of habitats.Recent research indicates that all prokaryotes actually do have cytoskeletons,although more primitive than those of eukaryotes. At least some prokaryotesalso contain intracellular structures which can be seen as primitive organelles.Most prokaryotes are between 1 micron and 10 microns, but they can vary insize from 0.2 microns to 750 microns. ]IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT YOU, AS A SCIENTIST WHO HAS STUDIED THE AllanHILLS METEORITE FOR A LONG TIME, ARE CONVINCED THAT IT REPRESENTSLIFE ON MARS AT A MICROBIAL LEVEL PAST, PRESENT AND MAYBE EVENFUTURE?What I can say is that there is strong evidence for ancient life on early Mars because thecarbonates we are looking at in the Allan Hills meteorite are 3.9 billion years of age. Ican’t speak to recent past or present life on Mars because I have only been looking at theAllan Hills meteorite, which is so old.BUT THE LIKELIHOOD IS IF THERE HAS BEEN BACTERIAL LIFE ON MARS INTHE PAST, THERE IS BACTERIAL LIFE PRESENT NOW?I would certainly say – I would say yes!” Next NASA Mars Missionto Look for Organic LifeScheduled to launch in the fall of 2011, Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) is part of NASA'sMars Exploration Program, a long-term effort of robotic exploration of the red planet.Mars Science Laboratory is a rover called “Curiosity” that will assess whether Mars everwas, or is still today, an environment able to support microbial life. In other words, itsmission in 2012 is to determine the planet's habitability."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The Mars Science Laboratory rover is larger and can travel farther than Spirit and Opportunity,NASA's two Mars Exploration Rovers that began exploring the red planet in early 2004.Illustration by NASA Mars Science Lab.To search, NASA reports that “the rover will carry the biggest, most advanced suite ofinstruments for scientific studies ever sent to the Martian surface. The rover will analyzedozens of samples scooped from the soil and drilled from rocks. The record of the planet'sclimate and geology is essentially ‘written in the rocks and soil’ - in their formation,structure, and chemical composition. The rover's onboard laboratory will study rocks, soils,and the local geologic setting in order to detect chemical building blocks of life such asforms of carbon on Mars and will assess what the Martian environment was like in thepast.”The small car-sized Mars Science Laboratory Curiosity rover will roll aroundthe rocky surface of Mars not only brushing dust off rocks, but also vaporizing themwith a laser beam, gathering samples to analyze on the spot and takinghigh resolution photographs.

The spacecraft'sdescent into the Martian atmosphere will be guided by small rockets on its way toward thesurface.

On average, the rover is expected to travel about 30meters (98 feet) per hour, based on power levels, slippage, steepness of the terrain,visibility, and other variables.Like a large crane on Earth, the sky crane touchdown system will lower the roverto a “soft landing” - wheels down on the surface of Mars, ready to begin itsmission. Illustrations by NASA Mars Science Laboratory.NASA: “The rover will carry a radioisotope power system that generates electricity fromthe heat of plutonium's radioactive decay. This power source gives the mission anoperating lifespan on Mars' surface of a full Martian year (687 Earth days) or more, whilealso providing significantly greater mobility and operational flexibility, enhanced sciencepayload capability, and exploration of a much larger range of latitudes and altitudes thanwas possible on previous missions to Mars.Arriving at Mars in 2012, Mars Science Laboratory will:- demonstrate the ability to land a very large, heavy rover to the surface ofMars (which could be used for a future Mars Sample Return mission thatwould collect rocks and soils and send them back to Earth for laboratoryanalysis)- demonstrate the ability to land more precisely in a 20-kilometer (12.4-mile)landing circle- demonstrate long-range mobility on the surface of the red planet (5-20kilometers or about 3 to 12 miles) for the collection of more diverse samplesand studies.”More Information:Allan Hills ALH84001 meteorite made worldwide headlines in 1996because scientists found rice-shaped carbon globules in tiny cracks on the rockwhich resembled Earth bacteria.
