At first he thought they were forensic officers as theywere dressed in white coveralls. He stopped his car and approached the field.The figures were all over 6 feet and had blonde hair. They seemed to beinspecting the crop. When he got to the edge of the field, he heard what he"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"believed to be a sound not dissimilar to static electricity. This crackling noiseseemed to be running through the field and the crop was moving gently closeto where the noise was moving. He felt the hair on his arms and back of hisneck raise up. He shouted to the figures who at first ignored him, not glancingat him. When he tried to enter the field they looked up and began running. Hesaid “They ran faster than any man I have ever seen. I’m no slouch, but theywere moving so fast. I looked away for a second and when I looked back theywere gone. I then got scared. The noise was still around, but I got an uneasyfeeling and headed for the car. For the rest of the day I had a poundingheadache I couldn’t shift.”In the 1960s, newspaper reporter Arthur Shuttlewood interviewed many people in theWarminster, England, region who also described some tall, blond beings and experiencedthe crackling sounds of static electricity in association with the entity encounters.As The Truth Hides report began to circulate on the internet, crop formation researcherand photographer, Lucy Pringle, sent the following email to several of us:From: LucyPringle@aol.comSubject: Re: beings in the cropDate: July 8, 2009Dear :Many thanks for this interesting report (link below) - I have justone query regarding the policeman's statement: “The contact,who doesn't want to be named, was driving past Silbury Hill earlyMonday morning when he saw three figures in the formationthere.”There are 2 formations at present near Silbury Hill. One on theopposite side of the road from the hill and one behind Silbury Hilltowards Avebury. My slight problem with this report is that:1. neither formation can be seen from the road.2. no people can be seen from the road when they are in either ofthem no matter how tall they may be.Kind regards,LucyAuthor, aerial photographer, researcher and world-wide lecturer.The UK's most comprehensive crop circle photographic library.Web site: www.lucypringle .co.ukTo : L u c yI received a report from a police sergeant regarding three beingsspotted in the crop...http://thetruthhides.wordpress.com/ “Quetzalcoatl Headdress” Is AtopRising Hill Across Road from Silbury Hill"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The reddish circle on the map marks the position of 5,000-year-old Silbury Hillthat rises 130 feet above the land on the north side of the Roman Road.

Aerial image © 2009 by Jack Roderick.For other images and information: Cropcircle conne ctor.Lucy Pringle's comments provoked crop formation researcher, Andy Russell, to contactthe police officer for a trip back to the scene to confirm if the formation and/or tall beingscould be seen from the road in front of Silbury Hill. On Sunday, July 12, Andy took theWiltshire police officer by car to re-trace the policeman's route and to have him point outwhere he saw the three, tall men. Andy emailed his preliminary report on Tuesday, July 14,and gave Earthfiles permission to quote the following paragraphs.Andy Russell, July 14, 2009: “Having driven the route with the officer several times onSunday, several things became apparent: formation is up on brow of hill across the roadfrom the ancient Silbury Hill and so there is a question about how the police officer couldhave seen anyone standing in the crop formation from the road? [ From the west to easttravel direction] the police officer looked to his right in the direction of the crop formation- but he could not have seen three people huddled over the pattern! Impossible to see from"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the road. When you get to the pattern, you loose sight of the road between Silbury Hill andthe rising hill upon which the headdress rests.“When we arrived at the location where he parked his car (side of the road), he pointed towhere the beings were. According to the officer, one was very near the brow of the hill,one was a few yards further down in a different tramline, and one was about halfwaydown the slight hill. So I asked the $64,000,000 question about the fact that the formationcouldn't be seen from the road. His response was that he knew prior to the experiencethere was a formation 'somewhere over there' and he 'knew' they had been in it. He 'knew'they were inspecting the crop. When questioned how he 'knew,' he said that 'you knowwhat day of the week it is, but no-one has told you; you haven't seen a calendar, you justknow'. Did he have some psychic awareness? Was something communicated to him? Thisis a man who views the world in the black and white of the letter of the law, this is a manwhose testimony can imprison someone, in my humble opinion he is not taken to flights offancy with metaphysical concepts.“We moved on to the figures running away at speed. If two of them were so close to thebrow of the hill, how much running would he actually see? One of them would havedisappeared instantly as they were near the brow of the hill. The police officer says thatthe tall men moved very fast, as if you were watching a video or DVD in fast forwardmode. This would have been noticeable for the being farthest from the hill brow. As wespoke I watched the hairs on the officer's arms raise as he relived the experience in hismind. When I asked whether they ran away out of sight or disappeared, he was adamantthey disappeared. He claimed he glanced away for a second and he claims that the beingthat was the furthest away was not near enough to the brow of the hill for him to run out ofview despite his rapid movement. Again, there is a deep 'knowing' they disappeared.”Andy Russell is continuing to investigate and more details might be forthcoming in thefuture.
