The freezing of the mammoth animals was rapid andthorough.Siberian mammoths – now extinct along with so many other large animals that died fromwhatever the cosmic impact was - were warm blooded animals that grazed on warm temperatureplants. Those creatures – along with giant sloths, American lions and camels, giant condors,saber-toothed tigers, mastodons, and giant beavers – were caught in an event so catastrophicthat animals were quick-frozen and some skeletons have been found with their spines twisted.What were the forces that caused so much violence and rapid temperature cooling? Thenanodiamond discoveries in six North American Younger Dryas sedimentary layers ranging fromArizona to Canada to South Carolina by Prof. Douglas Kennett, Prof. Ted Bunch and otherssuggest that not only was there an outer space impact – but the forces involved were probablysimilar to the huge airburst explosion over Tunguska, Siberia, in 1908. That force about athousand times as powerful as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima, Japan. Thousands of trees wereburned up and an estimated 80 million trees were knocked down over 830 square miles, or 2,150square kilometers.Some 80 million trees were knocked over by the 1908 Tunguska atmosphericblast by an object thought to be a large meteoroid or comet fragment at an altitudeof about 5 miles above Tunguska.

Source: Wikipedia.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - The Tunguska Event was a powerful explosion thatoccurred near the Podkamennaya (Lower Stony) Tunguska River in what is nowKrasnoyarsk Krai of Russia, at around 7:14 a.m. local time on June 30, 1908.Although the cause is the subject of some debate, the explosion was most likely tohave been caused by the air burst of a large meteoroid or comet fragment at analtitude of 5–10 kilometers (3–6 miles) above the Earth's surface. Different studieshave yielded varying estimates for the object's size, with general agreement that itwas a few tens of meters across.Although the meteor or comet burst in the air rather than directly hitting the surface,this event is still referred to as an impact. Estimates of the energy of the blast rangefrom 5 megatons to as high as 30 megatons of TNT, with 10 to 15 megatons themost likely - about 1,000 times as powerful as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima,Japan. The explosion knocked over an estimated 80 million trees over 2,150 squarekilometers (830 square miles). An explosion of this magnitude is capable ofdestroying a large metropolitan area.]The nanodiamond layer the scientists have found are micron-sized diamonds that can only beproduced by high temperatures or high impact pressures, but no craters have been found so far.That’s why Prof. Ted Bunch, Ph.D., Adjunct Professor of Geology at Northern ArizonaUniversity in Flagstaff and former NASA research scientist and exobiology manager thinks theimpacts were made by big pieces of broken up comet that exploded in the atmosphere. Likegigantic blow torches from above, the explosions could have set fire to the Earth in many places.Prof. Bunch continues about why nanodiamonds discovered in the Younger Dryas sedimentarylayer indicate high temperature and high pressure impacts.Interview: Ted Bunch, Ph.D., Former NASA Research Scientist and Exobiology Manager and nowAdjunct Professor of Geology, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona: “ThisYounger Dryas layer contains various types of diamonds. Some of the diamonds, like the cubicdiamond, can only be formed by either great depth in the Earth due to high pressure andtemperature; or by shock impact. We’ve also found hexagonal diamonds. They can only beformed by shock impact and they ordinarily are only found in terrestrial impact craters. We thinkthat in this layer of nanodiamonds, there is also iridium and other evidence of an outer spaceimpact."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The six Younger Dryas sedimentary layer sites w here nanodiamonds w ere discovered are:1-Murray Springs, Arizona; 2-Bull Creek, Oklahoma; 3-Lake Hind, Manitoba, Canada;4-Chobot, Alberta, Canada; 5-Gainey, Michigan; 6-Topper, South Carolina.Map and photomicrographs courtesy Douglas Kennett, Ph.D.That is different from the Chicxulub crater, which is responsible for wiping out the dinosaurs 65million years ago because that large meteorite hit land and produced a lot of shockcharacteristics – a huge explosion, probably many more times more powerful than all of theatomic weapons that have ever been created, detonated or in storage.65 million years ago, something large from outer spacecrashed into the northern end of the Yucatan Peninsula and causedwhat scientists call the \"K-T Boundary Extinction\"(Cretaceous - Tertiary)that wiped out the dinosaurs. What remains today is the ChicxulubCrater (map below) layered with iridium.THAT’S THE K-T BOUNDARY EXTINCTION OF THE DINOSAURS?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"That’s correct. But our Younger Dryas event is a little different because the fragments from thecomet break up before the Earth encounter. Those pieces probably did not make craters becausewe don’t have a crater to look at. But the comet pieces might have pelted the glacial sheet stillpresent at that time in Canada and ejected a lot of ice blocks, but not shocked rock material likethe Chicxulub event. So, we don’t have the typical shock characteristics from something likeimpact with the Earth, but we have the diamonds.We also have other characteristics that are similar maybe to the Tunguska event in Russia onehundred years ago (1908). There are some nanodiamonds there as well and there are somecarbon spherules and some magnetic spherules – about the same materials that we find in ournanodiamond sites in North America.THAT WAS THE MASSIVE AIRBURST THAT TOOK OUT 830 SQUARE MILES OFFOREST IN SIBERIA.Ye s .WITH FIRE AND KNOCKING DOWN TREES.Fire to the central portion and knocked down trees for a diameter of 2,000 kilometers 1,243miles). There was no crater formed. Comet Fragments Hit Jupiter in 1994IN 1994, WE HAD THE BROKEN UP COMET IMPACT JUPITER.That’s correct. That was Comet Shoemaker-Levy.On lower left are two of the twenty-one comet fragments that impacted Jupiter'satmosphere leaving dark holes on July 16 to 22, 1994. Each impact mark is larger than Earth.This event was the only time in human history that comet fragment collisions with a planethas been witnessed and photographed. Image © 1994 by John Chumack, Galactic Images.DO YOU THINK WHAT HAPPENED ON JUPITER IN 1994 IS SIMILAR TO WHAT MIGHTHAVE HAPPENED ON THE EARTH 12,900 YEARS AGO?Sure! (laughs) That’s a good analog. We look at Tunguska as an analog and we look at more ofthe linear array of Shoemaker-Levy Comet. Those were pieces that followed each other in andas Jupiter rotated, the comet pieces impacted the gaseous surface of Jupiter. What we areproposing is not necessarily a linear array, but a cluster array like a shotgun blast that struckNorth America and maybe beyond.AND WOULD HAVE BEEN COMETARY AND NOT METEORITIC?Probably cometary because we don’t find asteroidal particles. The same as at Tunguska. Thatwas probably cometary because the Russians and other investigators have not found typicalrocky, asteroid debris. Atmospheric “Blow Torch” FireWHY WOULD COMETARY DEBRIS INTERACTING WITH THE EARTH’S ATMOSPHERE"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"CAUSE WIDESPREAD FIRES?The fire at Tunguska was caused by the gaseous jet from the aerial explosion of a rather smallpiece of comet. But that gaseous jet hit the ground like a blow torch. That’s what caused thefires in the very center of these knocked down trees.DO YOU THINK THAT IS AN ACCURATE ANALOGY FOR WHAT WOULD HAVEHAPPENED 12,900 YEARS AGO FROM THE COMETARY MATERIAL?That’s what we’re advocating.SO THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE BLOW TORCH GAS EXPLOSIONS IN MANYMORE THAN HALF A DOZEN PLACES?Probably, because we have a very fine site in the Channel Islands at the Arlington site[ Channel Islands National Park, California, is a chain of eight islands located in the PacificOcean off the coast of Santa Barbara, Southern California] and this very same layer with all thenanodiamonds and extinction of the pygmy mammoths is precisely at 12,900 years ago. Youcan’t really get a firestorm on the California side and blow it out to sea and start fires on theChannel Islands! (laughs) The fires were not completely across the United States, but affectedvery large regional areas.I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT IF THERE ARE AIRBURSTS AND THE BLOW TORCH GASIMPACTS, THERE MIGHT NOT BE ANY CRATERS, BUT THE IMPACT ON THE PLANETWOULD BE HUGE.That’s right. The blow torch thing is temperature only and might have melted the upper fewmillimeters of the soil, but certainly ignited all the biomass (trees and plants).IF WE WERE HUMANS ALIVE AT THAT TIME, WE MIGHT HAVE SEEN FIERYEXPLOSIONS ALL OVER THE PLACE.That’s right.THAT COULD EXPLAIN PERHAPS WHY THERE WERE SUDDEN DEATHS ANDTWISTED SPINES OF SOME OF THE ANIMALS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN VIOLENTLYAFFECTED BY GAS EXPLOSIONS?We’re working out of the box because fifty years ago very few scientists believed there wasanything such as a meteorite impact crater. It took Gene Shoemaker with his extensive work atthe Meteor Crater, Arizona, in 1962, to prove that was an impact crater. We’ve come a long wayin a short period of time. There are almost 200 known impact craters around the Earth andeverybody says, ‘OK, if you don’t have a crater, you don’t have an impact.’ So, we’rechallenged by limited box-thinking of not looking beyond the end of your hand to see that otherimpact scenarios can happen. That’s what we’re up against! Threat of Near Earth ObjectsOur problem now is a possible encounter with what is called a near Earth object. There arethousands of them that cross over the Earth’s orbit all the time. Everything is pretty wellstabilized, but occasionally one gets knocked out like a billiard ball. Something comes in anddisturbs one of those stable asteroids that comes in and makes a big hole in the ground on Earth.But that’s very infrequent.The danger of comets hitting Earth has not been adequately addressed because we don’t knowwhere most of them are. SOHO (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory) has discovered 500 newcomets in the last eight years! Astronomers find them all the time and so does Hubble, the spaceplatform telescope. So, there are a lot of comets out there and we don’t know where they all are!ANY ONE OF THEM COULD IMPACT WITH THE EARTH, DEPENDING UPON ORBITWITH THE EARTH AND REPEAT WHAT HAPPENED 12,900 YEARS AGO.Well, we know it’s happened before. It will certainly happen gain. If this actually happened aswe are hypothesizing, and as we know it happened in Tunguska in 1908, then comet fragmentimpacts are another space hazard that we have to consider.In addition to the astronomers, there are amateurs and professionals who find comets all thetime. And Hubble has found, I think, six or eight of the cluster broken up comets and I thinkthere are probably 60 of them known now. But you have to keep looking. And you never knowwhen something is going to happen! (laughs)But the problem with comets, long period comets, is that some take up to 70 years to make theircomplete orbit around the sun. So, if we start now looking for those, they might be way out in"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the far reaches of the solar system and we won’t see them until they come back around andsomething might have perturbed them in that time and they might be coming right for us and wedon’t know that.JUST LIKE 12,900 YEARS AGO! Yes, exactly! (laughs)WHAT IS YOUR NEXT RESEARCH STEP IN THIS NANODIAMOND RESEARCH?We’ve found good evidence in the Greenland ice core. NOVA is doing a special on the evidencethat our team has found and we’re in the process of writing a very large article on it.” Even though the scientists are not yet detailing their Greenland discoveries, the implication isthat their ice core dates to 12,900 years ago and has the same type of nanodiamonds, iridium andother materials that they have found in Canada and the United States. As their research extendsto Europe, the Near East and perhaps South America in the future, will more nanodiamonds inYounger Dryas layers be found that strengthen the possible link to devastating outer spaceimpactors 12,900 years ago?Return to Part 1.More Information:For further reports about Earth climate changes, please see Earthfiles Archive:• 12/21/2008 — Mystery of Missing East Coast Acorns• 10/24/2008 — Rapidly Changing Earth• 08/15/2008 — Amphibian Warning Bell of Mass Extinctions• 06/21/2008 — Updated June 25, 2008: Increasingly Acidic Pacific Coast Waters Threaten MarineLi fe• 03/27/2008 — Ice Block Size of Northern Ireland Has Broken From Wilkins Ice Shelf in WestAntarcti c Peninsula• 02/29/2008 — Mysterious Bat Deaths in New York, Vermont and Massachusetts• 01/18/2008 — Amphibians Dying Out At Alarming Rate• 01/10/2008 — Solar Cycle 24 Has Begun• 10/05/2007 — Earlier, Faster and Deeper Arctic Ice Melt Down• 08/08/2007 — 2007's Warm, Erratic Global Weather• 07/11/2007 — Mystery of Night Shining Clouds - Another Global Warming Change?• 06/28/2007 — Hackenberg Apiary, Pennsylvania - 75-80% Honey Bee Loss in 2007.
