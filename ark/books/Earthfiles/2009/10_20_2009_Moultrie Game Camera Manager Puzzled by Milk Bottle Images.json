October 20, 2009 Birmingham, Alabama - For thirty years, Moultrie Game Feedersand Game Trail Cameras have had a reputation for being reliable, durable qualityperformance. The company sells infrared game cameras, flash cameras and cameraaccessories. One of its most popular game trail cameras is Moultrie's D-40 digital trailcamera to monitor deer and other animal habits and patterns.Moultrie GameSpy D40 Digital Trail Camera: Click for website- 4.0 megapixel digital camera has a quick trigger time, 45-ft flash and 60-daybattery life.- Color day and night pictures- Video clips during the day- Imprint time, date and camera ID on every photo or video- Laser and IR aim for quick and precise camera set-up- Multi-shot pictures (up to 3 shots)- Weather-resistant, airtight camera housing and seal- Operates on 6 D-cell batteries (sold separately)Beginning in November 2007, I received the following series of unusual Moultrie gametrail images from Bob Coine, President and Owner of Heartland Studios, Inc., in Oregon,Illinois.In order to keep track of how many white-tailed bucks and does use his farm and toestimate ages of the bucks, Bob explained that he uses a variety of game trail cameras. Hehas pure infrared cameras that do not flash and take images in non-visible infrared;standard 35mm cameras; and digital cameras that have an infrared beam to detect motion,which then triggers the camera to flash in the visible light spectrum.Six photographs below taken in visible flash mode on November 16, 2007, beginning at3:59 AM over a three minute time span, have been a mystery and so have several otherimages taken by Moultrie game trail cameras in several other states the past two years. So,in late September, I sent the “milk bottle” images to the Customer Service Department ofMoultrie Game Feeders and Game Trail Cameras in Birmingham, Alabama, to ask if their"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"technical department might have an explanation for the unusual images.On Friday, October 16, 2009, Gene Matchen, Moultrie Customer Service Manager, calledme and said, “This is the first time that our Moultrie Game Trail Camera people have everseen anything like those “milk bottle” images. The head of Moultrie engineering, researchand development now has the photos, but so far we have no explanation.” Bob Coine, President and Owner of Heartland Studios, Inc., in Oregon, Illinois: “Inthe first picture, a deer is triggering the camera as the deer walks by.

Other recent “milk bottle” images from Edomin Van Zandt County, Texas, are reported in September 11, 2009, Earthfiles.The center “corkscrew” and “fins” on the right are almost certainly flying insects caughtin motion blur of camera's time lapse. Roger Harris, is a software engineer who has workedfor fifteen years at Verizon in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He watched a LearningChannel program called Strange Science in 1999 that demonstrated how moths and otherinsects create fin and corkscrew motion blur patterns when a camera shutter speed is slow,such as 1/50th to 1/100th of a second, common at night in game trail cameras.Interview:Roger Harris, Verizon Software Engineer, Colorado Springs, Colorado: “Motion blurcan affect any camera, but with video cameras, when you have successive frames, it’spretty easy to identify motion blur by the patterns that you see from one frame to the next.When you are looking at the motion blur of a bug – say it moves ten times its own lengthduring the image capture time on a camera – that’s going to be 90% transparent then.You’re seeing through the motion blur streak for 90% of the exposure time.Video cameras are limited in shutter speed because they have to capture 30 frames persecond, which is 60 fields per second. That means the longest exposure time they can useis 1/60th of a second.If it were a still camera, it can be any shutter speed you want from fractions of seconds upto a minute or more if you wanted to. But if they are still images, there should be EXIFdata with the image that tells you the exposure time. To get that, you need the originalimages and if you have any kind of photo editor that will show the EXIF data, it will showthe time captured, exposure time, aperture setting and so on.WHAT WOULD BE THE AVERAGE SHUTTER SPEED THAT WOULD PRODUCETHAT SINE-WAVE PATTERN OF AN INSECT FLYING THROUGH THE AIR?Anything above 1/100th of a second. Most of the video shots that I have of insects inmotion blur were 1/60th of a second. But with motion blur, it’s all relative: how far doesthe object appear to move during exposure time?IS THERE A SHUTTER SPEED RATE IN WHICH YOU WOULD NEVER GETMOTION BLUR?Well, I’d say about 1/500th of a second. Above that shutter speed, insects look like insects.YOU’RE NOT GOING TO FIND 1/500TH OF A SECOND ON GAME TRAILCAMERAS BECAUSE THE HUNTERS ARE TRYING TO VIEW IN THE NIGHT.Yes, at night the average shutter speed is probably around 1/50th or 1/60th of a second, oreven slower such as 1 second. A lot depends on the sensitivity of the chip, but there is anautomatic exposure setting program running there that is looking at the field and decidinghow much light it has. Most cameras have an aperture that you can open up, but onceyou’ve opened them up all the way, the only thing you can do is take longer exposuretimes.What’s happening with the insects is that they are fairly small relative to how fast they aretraveling. If a bug is flying only about 20 mph, let’s say, and if it is a half-inch long bug, it’sgoing to move 6 inches during the time of a 1/60th camera field capture. That means thatbug is going to look like it’s 12 times longer than it is wide. If the bug is only a few feet infront of the camera, a 6-inch streak is quite noticeable.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - How fast can insects fly? The male deer bot fly isreputed to develop flying speeds of up to several hundred miles per hour, butthis may be just an exaggeration. The tabanid fly, which is related to horseflies, has been clocked in at 90 miles per hour. Hawkmoths, from theSphingidae family, have been timed at a solid 33 miles per hour. A horsefly"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(Hybomitra hinei wrighti) was recently clocked at 145 km/h! Dragonflies ofthe Anax parthenope species have been clocked in at almost 18 miles perhour. Honeybees fly at about a moderate 7 miles per hour, and have to beattheir wings 190 times per second to do it. Speeds vary amongst butterflyspecies (for some reason the poisonous varieties are slower thannon-poisonous ones). The fastest butterflies (skippers) can fly at about 30miles per hour or more. Slow flying butterflies fly at only 5 mph. Insectairspeed is affected by mass, size, age, gender, feeding, water content, activitytype, temperature, humidity, solar radiation, wind, oxygen level, ascent angleand even habitat isolation. More research needs to be done in order todetermine the fastest insect.]If it’s a small bug, say 1/8th of an inch long, and is only 12 inches in front of the camera, itmight only be moving 10 mph and it would create a 3-inch-long streak in that exposuretime. So, the thing about bugs is not that they fly that fast, but they are fairly small relativeto how fast they are traveling.WHY THE CONNECTED ARCS OR SINE WAVES?What’s happening there is that bugs have different wing beats.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - How fast can insects flap their wings? Insectswith the fastest wing beating frequency are the no-see-ums (very tiny midges),which beat their hairy wings 1,046 times per second, or 62,000 beats perminute, the record holder for an animal with the fastest fluttering wings. Malemosquitoes don't even come close with wings that beat 450 to 600 times persecond. Cabbageworm butterflies are perhaps the slowest with wings that beatonly 9 times per second. Source: 1001 Questions Answered About Insects byAlexander and Elsie Klots.Mosquitoes = 988 – 1,046 strokes per secondHoney Bee = 250Housefly = 190Bumblebee = 130Hornet = 100Hummingbird Hawk Moth = 85Large white butterfly = 12 ]What that means is that you are seeing several wing beats during an exposure time. If youknew what kind of bug that was in each of those Texas images, you could figure out howlong the exposure time was pretty closely by counting how many wing images you see. Eerie “Blades of Light” in Longview, TexasSeptember 9-10, 2009WHAT ABOUT THE ‘BLADES OF LIGHT’ PHOTOGRAPHED IN CASS COUNTY,TEXAS BY DOYLE BROGAN ON SEPTEMBER 9 TO 10, 2009? DOYLE HASHUNTED IN THAT REGION FOR 30 YEARS, GOT MOULTRIE GAMESPY D40DIGITAL TRAIL CAMERAS ABOUT SIX YEARS AGO, RUNS FOUR OF THEM 24HOURS A DAY, SEVEN DAYS A WEEK, AND TOLD ME HE HAS NEVER SEENANYTHING LIKE THE STRANGE LIGHTS BEFORE.They don’t look like any typical insect in motion blur that I’m familiar with. But we’re stilltalking about a fairly long exposure time and you can’t rule out motion blurring whenyou’re talking about long exposure times. It’s hard to pin down exactly what it is, but Iwouldn’t necessarily call it mysterious unless you can rule out motion blur. A firefly couldhave been close to the camera, but you can’t tell how far away it was from those images.DO YOU HAVE ANY MOTION BLUR IMAGES OF FIRE FLIES?No. I don’t believe I’ve seen any.” 5 Frames in Time Sequence Order from 9:43 PM Central, September 9, 2009,to 9:07 AM, September 10, 2009, by Doyle Brogan, Longview, Texas"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Time period between the two blades of light: about 6 hours.All images © 2009 by Doyle Brogan."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Interview:Doyle Brogan, retired supervisor for heavy duty truck manufacturer, Longview,Texas:\"WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST REACTION TO SEEING THE TWO UNUSUAL FRAMESOF BLADES OF LIGHT IN YOUR DIGITAL IMAGES FROM YOUR MOULTRIEGAME CAMERA?I had no idea what it could be.

The next day, it started raining and I didn’t go upthere until the Tuesday after the previous week when I collected those pictures. So that’swhen I contacted the television station in Longview, KYTX.I went back to the location on Tuesday morning, Sept. 15, 2009, around 9:30 AM with TVreporter. We drove to where the Moultrie game camera was and it was pouring down rain.We couldn’t see any physical traces of any burning on the ground even though there was alot of water on the ground. I haven’t been back there since.
