Across the road tothe south, the topography rises to another hill nearly as high as Silbury Hill. The350-foot-diameter “Quetzalcoatl Headdress” is marked by the green circle. Return to Part 1August 18, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - While I was in England July 24 to August11, 2009, I met Ryan O'Hara, cameraman working with a documentary film crew that hadbeen doing a night watch on top of 5,000-year-old Silbury Hill from 3 AM to dawn in theearly morning hours of July 5. As the sunset turned to darkness on July 4th around 10 PM,no one amid all the air traffic over the ancient Avebury and Silbury complex had reportedany new formation across the road from the 130-foot-tall Silbury Hill.But near 4:15 AM, cameraman Ryan O'Hara spotted a shadowy line in the hilltop wheatfield south of Silbury Hill and the Roman Road and ran his visible light camera in thepre-dawn. He gave me permission to reprint his first greenish image, followed by moredetail as dawn light increased to first sunrise images when the heavy dew sparkledundisturbed without any human presence in the wheat."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" “Quetzalcoatl Headdress” AtopWheat Field Across Road from Silbury Hill"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"“Quetzalcoatl Headdress” about 350 feet in diameter first discovered July 5, 2009,around 4:15 AM by documentary film crew that camped from 3:00 AM onward atop SilburyHill on the north side of the Roman Road separating Silbury and the hilltop wheat field.Aerial image © 2009 by Jack Roderick.For other images and information: Cropcircle conne ctor.Return to Part 1For further information about worldwide crop formations, please see Earthfiles Archivedreports (partial list below) and my book, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles, in theEarthfiles Shop.• 08/17/2009 — Part 2: Windmill Hill and West Overton After Rains• 08/12/2009 — Part 1: Windmill Hill Pattern Near Ancient Avebury Came in Rain• 08/05/2009 — Extraordinary Details in New Silbury Hill Formation Destroyed by Farmer• 08/03/2009 — \"Settlement\" Wheat Formation Inside Ancient Celtic Settlement• 07/31/2009 — Silver Disc Videotaped Near Barbury Castle• 07/31/2009 — Infrared Video of Light Flashes, Moving Darknesses - and Entity?• 07/30/2009 — Inside the 12-Armed Ogbourne St. George Wheat Formation• 07/16/2009 — Part 2: Silbury Hill “Quetzlcoatl Headdress” and Mysterious Tall Blonds• 07/15/2009 — Part 1: Silbury Hill “Quetzlcoatl Headdress” and Mysterious Tall Blonds• 07/14/2009 — 2-Stage Cannings Cross Wheat Formation Scene of Farm Arrest• 07/12/2009 — Mysterious Aerial Lights Mimicking Stars in Texas and Oregon• 07/11/2009 — Update Podcast: Is Sudden Solar Intensity of July 5 - 7 What U.K. SpringCrop Formations Forecast for Oddly Quiet Sun?• 07/06/2009 — UK “Quetzalcoatl Headdress” and “Sixth Sun Tzolkin”?• 07/03/2009 — UK “Nazca Hummingbird” - Astronomical and Mayan Counting• 07/03/2009 — Part 3: “Alien Symbols” in Milk Hill and South Field• 07/02/2009 — Part 1: “Alien Symbols” in Milk Hill and South Field• 07/02/2009 — Part 2: “Alien Symbols” in Milk Hill and South Field• 06/09/2009 — Update Podcast: Aerial Lights That Mimic Stars, Helicopters and Airplanes• 06/05/2009 — Part 2: Mysterious, Silent, Large Aerial Triangles• 06/04/2009 — Part 1: Mysterious, Silent, Large Aerial Triangles• 05/12/2009 — Part 3: Astronomical Information in U.K. 2009 Crop Formations?• 05/10/2009 — Part 2: 800-Foot-Long Pattern in U.
