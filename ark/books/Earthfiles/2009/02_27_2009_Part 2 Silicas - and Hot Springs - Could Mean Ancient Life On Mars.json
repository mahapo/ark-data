Return to Part 1February 27, 2009 Houston, Texas - Other scientists studying a completely different partof Mars in Arabia Terra have also discovered features they think are the residue of hotsprings, largely based on the tell-tale oval rings that closely resemble hot springs inYellowstone National Park and Dalhousie, Australia. In a recent issue of Astrobiology,NASA Johnson Space Center planetary geologists described one mound on Mars namedVernal crater that could be a dried up hot springs?

Image courtesy Google Earth.One of the co-authors on the Astrobiology research is Dorothy Oehler, Ph.D., ResearchScientist in NASA Johnson Space Center’s Astromaterials Research and ExplorationScience Directorate in Houston, Texas. This week she talked with me about the fascinatingsearch for hydrothermal sites in Arabia Terra that is not considered a volcanic region likethe Olympus Mons Tharsis volcanoes nearly 3,000 miles away.Arabia Terra is lower left of above map at center of Mars just north of the equator.Below, the red arrows point to Arabia Terra features photographed by theMars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) that resemble dried up hot springs on Earth.Interview:Dorothy Z. Oehler, Ph.D., Research Scientist, Astromaterials Research andExploration Science Directorate, NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas:“We started looking in Arabia Terra for areas that might be interesting and there was acrater that has a very shallow slope into the crater. It could be easily accessed – you coulddrive into the crater and drive back out and in so doing, you could see a whole stack ofsediments. So, that’s why we honed in on this crater initially, now named Vernal craterafter the town in Utah.The image in Arabia Terra was taken by the spacecraft called Mars ReconnaissanceOrbiter (MRO) and its High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE). Theimagery is mainly in the visible, so it looks like something you see with your eyes and notinfrared.You can get resolution up to about a meter, which really means you are seeing somethinglike 30 centimeters per pixel and you need three pixels to resolve something. So, peoplesay it’s about a meter resolution. It’s amazing! We were able to see things we have neverseen before on Mars. In the Vernal crater, we noticed some highly unusual features.They jumped out at me right away as potentially being related to water because of theirelliptical shape. They looked like nothing else we had ever seen on Mars. We decided thatthe most reasonable analogs are hot springs on Earth.LIKE YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Yellowstone National Park circular hot springs.Hot Springs are similar to geysers, but their underground channelsare large enough to allow rapid circulation of water. Rising hot waterreleases heat energy by evaporation or hot water runoff, while convectioncurrents return the cooler water to the underground system, thusmaintaining equilibrium. The microorganisms which live in and aroundthe hot springs often make the pools very colorful.Yes, that’s one kind of spring that forms terraces. A lot of people have seen thosemammoth springs in Yellowstone with the terraces. And we thought we had terracesbesides the oval shape. It was the terracing that really got our attention thinking aboutsprings and we had some evidence of this in these features as well.SOME ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THE DALHOUSIE, AUSTRALIA, PHOTO THATWENT WITH YOUR REPORT IN ASTROBIOLOGY.Right. We came across some papers on the Dalhousie springs and I noticed some particularsimilarities, particularly with the dried up Dalhousie springs. In a spring area, the waterflow keeps moving; the subterranean water flow is not necessarily stable over time. Itmoves in areas that were active and become extinct. It’s a highly changing environmentwhere you will have extinct springs mixed in with active springs. Some of the extinct, driedup Dalhousie springs looked particularly like the Martian features.IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ANY OF THE FEATURES THAT THE HI RISE HAS IMAGEDON MARS COULD BE ACTIVE SPRINGS YET TODAY?Certainly that’s a question that has intrigued all of us. In this case, our best guess is thatthese (in Arabia Terra) are not active today. And the reason for that is when you look atthe high-resolution images, you can see some small impact craters within the (Martian)features themselves. If they were active hot springs today, you would think the craterswould be covered up (by flow deposits). So, the features look a little older.Also, the surface looks somewhat eroded, as if it is an older surface. We can’t actually putan age on it, but we don’t think they are current. Arabia Terra is an area with almost noevidence of volcanism and it's probably two or three thousand miles from the Tharsis andOlympus Mons volcanic region. There are no lava flows or thermal anomalies. There areno geomorphic features that look like lava in any way at all – none of the wrinkled ridgesthat are normally associated with lava flows. So, there is very little evidence for activevolcanism or lavas in the area. So, we think, if these are springs, they are more likeartesian sub-surface waters where the water is not necessarily very hot – not likeYellowstone – but since it’s coming from below the ground, it’s usually a little warmer thanthe surface area. It’s not freezing. It’s mobile, liquid water, so it’s a little bit warmer. Thereare springs that come out in the Arctic and in Greenland where liquid water comes to thesurface in an otherwise freezing area. So, that would be like an artesian setting.DO YOU HAVE ANY COMPOSITION DATA ABOUT VERNAL CRATER?Unfortunately, Arabia Terra is an area that has a lot of dust. The area we’re in (Vernalcrater) doesn’t have as much dust as other areas of Arabia Terra, but it has more dust thana lot of other places on Mars. Unfortunately, our best guess is that a thin layer of dust inArabia Terra prevented the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars(CRISM) from seeing clearly. Our CRISM data did not show anything except evidence ofdust, in both infrared and visible, which is oxidized iron in the Martian dust. Hot Springs - Key to Finding Life On Mars?LET’S GO TO THE $64 MILLION QUESTION THAT EVERYBODY WANTS TO HAVEAN ANSWER TO. IF THERE ARE ACTIVE – OR WERE ACTIVE – HOT SPRINGSON MARS, WARMTH AND WATER USUALLY MEAN LIFE. WHAT IS YOUR BESTSCIENTIFIC GUESS TODAY IF A ROVER WENT AND SCOOPED INTO THAT"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"GROUND AT THE VERNAL CRATER, WOULD THERE BE EVIDENCE OFMICROBES, PRESENT OR PAST?I think that a setting that has had hot spring activity, whether related to volcanism or not, isa very important place to do a life search if living organisms have existed on Mars. Thereason is that Mars is very dry and generally thought to have been dry for a long time.There certainly are pockets that have had more fluid movement. This Vernal crater is oneof those pockets.I can’t tell you that there is going to be life there, but it is certainly the type of place wherethere would be water. And if we had found CRISM data to support our hypothesis, theVernal crater would have been a very strong candidate for the Mars Science Laboratory(see below). But because the CRISM data were essentially bland, it didn’t provide thestrong support that people would like to see in the final site selection for the Mars ScienceLab. Best Places to Look for Life On Mars?AS A SCIENTIST WHO HAS BEEN LOOKING FOR COMBINATIONS OF HEATEDWATER COMING OUT ON THE SURFACE OF MARS, IF YOU WERE GOING TOSAY, ‘THIS IS WHERE I WOULD MOST LIKE THE MARS SCIENCE LAB TO LAND,WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT DIG?Oh, there are so many issues with landing the vehicle safely. You’ve got so much money init. It’s such an expensive venture that you just cannot take the chance of an unsafelanding. Unfortunately, there are many interesting sites that are very difficult to get to andmight not be in the realm of what we can do in the next few years.BUT WHAT WOULD BE AT THE TOP OF YOUR LIST REGARDLESS OF LANDINGPROBLEMS?I like areas that have evidence of water over time. For me, some of the deltas they havebeen looking at are very interesting. There’s a delta called Eberswalde not far from HoldenCrater. Both are south of the equator in Margaritifer Terra. Holden's wide floor hasabundant layered sediments, channels, and large piles of debris at canyon mouths. Thesesuggest a long history of deposits by water. And in Eberswalde Crater, just north ofHolden, scientists have spotted what is surely the remnant of a river delta. Holden Crater and Eberswalde Delta:Ancient Flowing Water and Life?“Holden Crater has some of the best-exposed lake deposits and ancient megabrecciaknown on Mars. Both contain minerals that formed in the presence of water and markpotentially habitable environments. This would be an excellent place to send a rover orsample-return mission to make major advances in understanding if Mars supported life.”- Alfred McEwen, Ph.D., MRO's HiRISE CameraMargaritifer Terra (lower right map) south of the Martian equator and southwestof Opportunity's landing site contains the fossil delta of Holden Crater that is 96 miles wide"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(154 kilometers) near 24.0°S, 33.7°W. Not far away is Eberswalde at 24°S, 33°W,formerly known as Holden NE.

Map © 2009 by National Geographic Society.Eberswalde, formerly known as Holden NE, is a partially buried impact craterin Margaritifer Terra, Mars. The 65.3-km-diameter crater, centered at 24°S, 33°W,is named after the German town of the same name. It is a proposed landing site for thefuture Mars rover Mars Science Laboratory.The crater contains a fossilized and exhumeddelta which was formed by the flow of a liquid, most likely water. The delta also providesunambiguous evidence that some Martian sedimentary rocks have been depositedin a liquid. The meandering of the channels provides evidence to support this.Image credit: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona.Holden is a 140-kilometer-wide crater located in the Martian southernhighlands notable for many features that seem to have been created by flowingwater such as the delta pocked by a crater. In Holden crater, HiRISE discoveredwhat might have been an ancient lake that held calm water for perhapsa thousand years and might have supported life.

Whether it’s still around or not, I think there is a chance, to be honest, and that"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"life does have a way of finding its own niches and adapting to changing situations. It mightwell be below the surface or in pockets here and there. I certainly would not be surprised.If there were no life at all on the planet now – if it all died out – I would not be toosurprised either.To be honest, what would surprise me the most would be if life never was on the planetMars. That would be surprising and give us all some pause and make us wonder – why?It does seem that life evolved quickly on Earth and I would see no reason why it would nothave evolved on Mars. I think Mars had all the ingredients early on – at least as weunderstand what ingredients are necessary for life to originate.YOU HAVE RAISED A VERY GOOD POINT THAT SUGGESTS THE REASON WHYTHERE IS SO MUCH CONCERN BY NASA AND OTHER SCIENTISTS TO LOOKFOR LIFE ON MARS IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH THAT LIFE IS MORE UNIVERSALBEYOND EARTH, CORRECT?Well, yeah. I think that has to be one of the most fascinating questions that we can evenpose: Are we alone? Are we unique? Or is life something that happens everywhere inmany places and with ease? Fascinating philosophical questions!THERE WERE ALWAYS A LOT OF QUESTIONS FROM THE PUBLIC POINT OFVIEW ABOUT WHY ALL OF OUR MISSIONS TO MARS SO FAR WERE NOTEQUIPPED TO LOOK VERY MUCH FOR ORGANIC SIDE OF CHEMISTRY. IT WASTHE INORGANIC, GEOLOGY SIDE. SO HAVE WE HAD A FAIR TEST OF LIFE ONMARS YET IN ANY OF THE MISSIONS?That’s a good question. You know, my understanding is that even going back to Viking isthat they did look for organics. But at that point, it was not understood how oxidized thesurface of the planet was. The surface of Mars is very oxidized, so if there are going to bepreserved organic materials, they are probably going to be at some depth underneath thesurface oxidation. It’s oxidized probably by a combination of UV (ultraviolet radiationfrom sun) and cosmic rays, which can get to the planet because of the loss of atmosphere.And some people have speculated that peroxides have been formed by the UV and cosmicrays and might be adding to the oxidation of the surface.THAT WOULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR LIFE TO EXIST ANYWHERENEAR THE SURFACE?It would, unless life found some way to deal with it by a protective shell or something. Butwhat it would mean is that some of the organic chemicals we have been looking for mightnot be preserved in the near-surface. They might just be oxidized, which would break themapart. So, we wouldn’t find them. So, in general, life as we kind of understand it, if it’sthere (on Mars), it’s probably going to be at some depth in the sub-surface.WELL, DR. OEHLER, THAT GOES RIGHT TO ONE OF THE MOST RECENTDISCOVERIES IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS OF HEADLINES ABOUT BELOW THESURFACE OF MARS IN SEVERAL PLACES, THEY HAVE FOUND LARGE CHUNKSOF GLACIAL ICE.November 2008, NASA: The concealed glaciers extend for tens of miles from edges ofmountains or cliffs and are up to one-half mile thick. A layer ofrocky debris covering the ice may have preserved the glaciers asremnants from an ice sheet covering middle latitudes during apast ice age.“Altogether, these glaciers almost certainly represent the largestreservoir of water ice on Mars that's not in the polar caps. Justone of the features we examined is three times larger than the cityof Los Angeles, and up to one-half-mile thick, and there are manymore,” said John W. Holt of The University of Texas at Austin'sJackson School of Geosciences, lead author of a report on theradar observations in the Nov. 21 issue of the journal Science. “Inaddition to their scientific value, they could be a source of waterto support future exploration of Mars.”"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"In November 2008, data from NASA's Mars ReconnaissanceOrbiter of vast Martian glaciers of water ice under protective blanketsof rocky debris were rat much lower latitudes than any ice previouslyidentified on the Red Planet.

And that’s justone of them. And it’s very exciting to find something like that!YES, DOESN’T IT MEAN THAT IF THERE IS GLACIAL ICE BENEATH THESURFACE – BUT NOT THAT DEEP BELOW THE SURFACE – THAT THERE COULDBE MICROBES AND LIFE ASSOCIATED WITH PROTECTED, UNDERGROUNDWAT E R I C E ?That’s certainly a possibility. That’s the sort of thing we would be looking for in the future.If there were big glaciers, just the pressure of the glaciers themselves would give you aliquid layer at some depth below that. But even that is unknown. Mars is very cold and hasso little surface pressure that right now, liquid water is not stable anywhere on the surface.IF ROVERS COULD DIG DOWN INTO COVERED GLACIERS ON MARS, DO YOUTHINK THEY MIGHT FIND SIGNS OF LIFE?Yes, if it’s there, if they have the right instruments and if they could get to deep enoughdepths.” Mars Science LaboratoryNASA's Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) will launch two years later than previously planned,in the fall of 2011 for arrival nine months later in 2012. The mission rover illustrated abovewill have the most advanced research tools NASA has developed so far to study the earlyenvironmental history of Mars and look for signs of life. Image courtesy NASA.NASA's most advanced rover called the Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) was supposed tolaunch in 2009, but the launch timeline has been pushed back to the fall of 2011 for arrivalon Mars in 2012. Exactly where the MSL will land to look for signs of life is still aquestion, but odds are it will be close to Holden Crater and the Eberswalde Delta, south ofthe Martian equator in the Margaritifer Terra.When the Mars Science Laboratory mission reaches Mars, NASA says it “ will use newtechnologies to adjust its flight while descending through the Martian atmosphere, and toset the rover on the surface by lowering it on a tether from a hovering descent stage.\" Thatmeans NASA doesn't want to bounce rovers down like Spirit and Opportunity werebounced in the rubber cushioning back in January 2004.NASA also reports that the Mars Science Laboratory “is engineered to drive longerdistances over rougher terrain than previous rovers.

Among them are a chain oflesser shield volcanoes including Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons and Ascraeus Mons. Thevolcanoes in the Tharsis region are 10 to 100 times larger than those on Earth. They werebuilt from large magma chambers deep within the Martian crust. The Martian flows arealso much longer. This is probably due to larger eruption rates and to lower gravity. One ofthe reasons volcanoes of such magnitude were able to form on Mars is because the hotvolcanic regions in the mantle remained fixed relative to the surface for hundreds ofmillions of years.The land immediately surrounding Olympus Mons is depressed 2 kilometers deep. Basedon crater size and frequency counts, the surface of this western scarp has been dated from115 million years old down to a region that is only 2 million years old. This is very recentin geological terms, suggesting that the mountain may yet have some ongoing volcanicactivity.Elysium Planitia is the second largest volcanic region on Mars. Elysium Planitia is centeredon a broad dome that is 1,700 by 2,400 kilometers (1,060 by 1,490 miles) in size. It hassmaller volcanoes than the Tharsis region, but a more diverse volcanic history. Threesignificant volcanoes include Hecates Tholus, Elysium Mons and Albor Tholus.Not all Martian volcanoes are classified as shields with effusive lava eruption styles. Northof the Tharsis region lays Alba Patera. This volcano is comparable to Olympus Mons in itshorizontal extent but not in height. Its base diameter is 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) but isless than 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) high. Ceraunius Tholus is one of the smaller volcanoes. Itis about the size of the Big Island of Hawaii and exhibits explosive eruption characteristicsand probably consists of ashdeposits. Tyrrhena Patera and Hadriaca Patera both havedeeply eroded features, which indicate explosive ash eruptions Mt. St. Helens is anexample of an Earth ash eruption.”] For further reports about Mars, please see Earthfiles Archive:• 01/25/2009 — Methane Mystery On Mars• 08/05/2008 — Perchlorate Discovery by Phoenix Lander Does Not End Search for Life OnMars• 05/29/2008 — Phoenix Robotic Arm Preparing to Dig Into Martian Permafrost• 12/16/2005 — MARSIS Radar Looking Below Surface of Mars• 11/18/2005 — Is the Sun Heating Up?• 11/09/2005 — Dust Storm On Mars, Cosmic First Light and Black Hole At Our Galaxy'sCenter• 08/24/2005 — Dust Devils and \"Lemon Rinds\" on Mars• 06/23/2005 — Mars Express Orbiter Finally Turns On Deep Ground-Penetrating Radar• 03/20/2005 — Astronaut John Young: \"The Moon Can Save Earth's Civilization.\"• 03/04/2005 — Subterranean Life On Earth - and Mars?• 02/26/2005 — Mars Spirit Rover Discovered Boundary Between Gusev Lava and Older,Water-Soaked Rocks in \"Columbia Hills\"• 02/22/2005 — Frozen Sea Near Martian Equator Size of Lake Michigan• 09/21/2004 — Part 2: Martian Water Ice and Organic Molecules - NASA Will Look for'Uni que Si gns of Li fe' on Mars• 09/20/2004 — Part 1: Martian Water Vapor and Methane Overlap in Equatorial Regions• 07/22/2004 — Is Physicist Vittorio Formisano's Mars Data Being Suppressed by ESA?• 05/06/2004 — Formaldehyde, Ammonia and Benzene Molecules on Mars?
