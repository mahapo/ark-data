Forrestal from September 17, 1947,to March 28, 1949, with U. S. President Harry S. Truman, undated.Return to Part 1Return to Part 19March 8, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - The previous Part 19 was my August 7,1998, phone call with Stein about the two men who stopped him in a supermarket parkinglot, showed Stein photographs of himself from the 1950s southeastern base period as wellas 1998 photos of Stein's only son at work and home, and told Stein that if he continued towork with me, his son would come to harm. But Stein agreed to consider my traveling tohis home again with a small videotape crew to record his whole CIA Project Blue Bookstory, to be held by me until after his death before public distribution. Through the U. S.mail, I sent him a letter with proposed details for the taping and a non-disclosure lettersigned and dated by me that confirmed I would not use the videotape until after his death.Our goal was for me to arrive at his home with a crew in mid-September 1998.On September 2, 1998, Stein called me deeply troubled, his voice trembling. I did not havephone recording equipment on at that time. He told me that morning he had gone to ascheduled doctor's appointment about his diabetes. The doctor's office was at the top of ashort flight of stairs. As Stein reached the first step, he saw the same two men from Part 19standing at the top of the stairs. When he reached them, their demeanor was more seriousthan the first July 5, 1998, supermarket encounter. Stein told me they had another warning:“We are here to remind you again that we expect you to be a loyal American and that youwill not communicate anymore with Linda Moulton Howe if you want to see your sonmarry his girlfriend and give you grandchildren.”At that point, Stein's voice broke and he said, “Linda, they must be tapping my housesome how because no one but my son, his mother and I know he was at our place twonights ago and told us he was going to ask his girlfriend to marry him. Even she does notknow yet!”I asked Stein if I could call him back to at least talk about the situation on my phone"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"recording system. He agreed. September 2, 1998, Recorded PhoneDiscussion After Final ThreatStein: “The CIA would probably like to get rid of me, if they could find an excuse.Howe: BUT IT’S NOT FAIR AND IT’S NOT LEGAL.Well, most of the stuff they do is not legal! (laughs) Over the years, legality was not even athought if they wanted to do something.We all had to sign non-disclosure agreements that applied for 35 years, which in my casewas up in the early 1990s. That’s the only non-disclosure agreement I ever signed. And, ofcourse, Anthony Barden probably destroyed all that stuff based on the comments that themen in the supermarket made that they can’t find any record at all of Anthony and whatwent on about CIA extraterrestrial UFO matters in the United States and overseas and oursecret unit at the southeastern military base. I have a feeling that Anthony Bardendestroyed everything! I think that’s why that really can’t come up with the actual nameswe used as cover in our CIA Project Blue Book unit, except probably Anthony Barden’sname. Those men seemed to know more about Anthony’s past, like his being in the OSS.IF WACKENHUT HAS BEEN RECORDING YOUR AND MY TELEPHONECONVERSATIONS FROM THE BEGINNING, YOU MENTIONED ANTHONYBARDEN SPECIFICALLY AT THE START.That’s right.I DID NOT USE HIS NAME IN THE RADIO BROADCAST.Right, you didn’t.THIS REALLY BOTHERS ME THAT THOSE MEN WOULD BE THREATENING YOUBY THREATENING YOUR SON AT YOUR DOCTOR'S OFFICE.Yes, and I wonder if the men threatening me and my son have had access to the GermanNazi file about WWII discs that Anthony Barden and I read in the basement archive at theCIA? Or have all those files Anthony and I saw back in the late 1950s ‘disappeared.’Remember when New Mexico Congressman Steve Schiff was trying to get Roswell ArmyAir Field files (1941 to 1948) and was told all the 1947 air base files had been ‘destroyedwithout authority’?[ Editor's Note: Earthfiles December 4, 2004 - “In 1993, New MexicoCongressman Steve Schiff asked the Government Accounting Office (GAO)to determine if the U.S. Air Force, or any other U.S. government agency,possessed information on the alleged crash and recovery of an extraterrestrialvehicle and its alien occupants near Roswell, New Mexico in July 1947.Cong. Steve Schiff (R) Albuquerque, NM 1st Congressional District.Died March 25, 1998, at age 51, from skin cancer."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"GAO Report released to New Mexico Cong. Steven H. Schiffon July 25, 1995, Washington, D. C.Schiff told reporters: ‘The GAO report states that the outgoing messages fromRoswell Army Air Field (RAAF) for this period of time were destroyedwithout proper authority.’ Schiff pointed out that these messages would haveshown how military officials in Roswell were explaining to their superiorsexactly what happened.Congressman Schiff said: ‘It is my understanding that these outgoing messageswere permanent records, which should never have been destroyed. The GAOcould not identify who destroyed the messages, or why.’ Schiff said the GAOthought the messages were destroyed over forty years ago, making furtherinquiry about their destruction impractical.Schiff added, ‘At least this effort caused the Air Force to acknowledge thatthe crashed vehicle was no weather balloon. That explanation never fit thefact of high military security used at the time.’” ] Stein: The file about Roswell crashes I found was down in the CIA basement archiveswhen I was there with Anthony Barden. That was not filed under a Roswell heading. Iwonder if their was a purposefully misleading ‘file system’ created to mislead everyone? Inother words, was there some classified code to really top secret files that were deliberatelymislabeled to keep people, even CIA agents, from finding the real files?Just like the men in the parking lot might think I was one person in the 1950s, but theymight have yet another decoy cover name left behind by Anthony Barden that wasn't eventhe phony CIA name I had and not my real name! (laughs) However, they showed me aphotograph of myself from those Army/CIA days. I had on a dark suit in a black and whitephotograph with a dark tie and white shirt. It was definitely me, so they must have gonethrough all the photographs they could find from 1956 to 1960. Naturally, I was muchskinnier back then than I am now. My boss, Anthony Barden, was standing beside me inanother photograph the men showed me.THOSE MEN DID NOT SAY TO YOU, ‘WE DON'T WANT THE GERMAN FILE TOBE DISCUSSED BECAUSE ....’ ?No, they didn't. They just said, ‘We know that you read that WWII file and we need tokeep this material from the public, along with everything else I had done and seen, that Ishould drop everything with you (Linda). Now they are threatening me about David'ssafety again and I think I should lay low for some period of time now. They must havesomeone watching me part of the time, or all of the time. They might even think I'm theperson who hid in the files some of the saucer-related materials they can't even findthemselves now.THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO DO THIS INTIMIDATION.(laughs) No, they don't! But I know for a fact that several people associated with theRoswell, New Mexico, crashes in the late 1940s were terminated, killed, according to thefile I read, to keep it all quiet. There was a nurse that was in the local hospital or clinic"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"where they brought a live alien – I know later they killed her. All the public heard aboutwas that she eventually disappeared. But the truth is she was killed by government agentsto keep her from talking. Secretary of Defense James Forrestal -What Did He Know?WAS THERE ANY DOCUMENT YOU SAW ANYWHERE THAT TALKEDSPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE SICKNESS AND DEATH OF SECRETARY OFDEFENSE FORRESTAL?Yes. When I was going through the CIA files, Anthony Barden told me that governmentagents had killed Forrestal.WHO SPECIFICALLY DID THE KILLING?It had to be the CIA. We were leaving the CIA archive and on the way out, Anthony said,‘They killed Forrestal.’ And I said, ‘They killed Forrestal? I thought he was killed in anaccident.’Anthony said, ‘No, they killed Forrestal.’James Vincent Forrestal (February 15, 1892 – May 22, 1949)was a United States Secretary of the Navy and the first U.S.Secretary of Defense from September 17, 1947, to March 28, 1949.Secretary of Defense James Forrestal's last meeting, March 25, 1949.Among those present were left to right: Under Secretary of Navy W. J. Kenney;Secretary of Air Force W. Stuart Symington; Secretary of Army Kenneth C. Royall;James Forrestal, Secretary of Defense; General Omar Bradley; Admiral Louis Denfield;and General Hoyt S. Vandenberg. Shortly after this photograph, Forrestal resigned.Two months later he w as murdered, according to a fragmentin Annex C, Forrestal, Maje sticdocume nts.com.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Forrestal's sudden death on May 22, 1949,resulted from a fall out of a Bethesda Naval Hospital window. An official U.S.Navy Medical Review Board convened on his death, after examining alldoctors and witnesses who were in the vicinity, could not establish the reason"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"for Forrestal's fall (i.e. suicide, homicide, accident). Although an autopsy wasperformed, the autopsy report has never been made public. The peculiarcircumstances of Forrestal's death, and the U.S. government's withholding ofthe complete report of the review board until 2004 has led to muchspeculation and controversy.”In his book, UFOs and the National Security State: An Unclassified History,Volume One, 1941 to 1973, © 2000 by Keyhole Publishing, author Richard M.Dolan wrote about Forrestal's mysterious death:“At around 2 a.m. on the morning of May 22, 1949, America’s first Secretaryof Defense, James Vincent Forrestal, fell to his death from a small window ofthe 16th floor of the Bethesda Naval Hospital.Bethesda Naval Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland.“The decline and death of Forrestal is an unresolved problem of history. Thereis no question that he suffered from a spectacular mental breakdown during1948 and 1949. Exactly why he did so is less certain, but the answer mayhave relevance to American national security – and the pesky topic of UFOs.“From the standpoint of conventional history -- that is, sans UFOs -- therewere no shortage of problems facing Forrestal. Throughout 1948, Forrestallocked horns with Air Force Secretary Stuart Symington over defensespending. Truman demanded an impossibly balanced budget, and Forrestal’sjob was to keep the services in line. He could not do this and, to some degree,would not. The result was the erosion of Truman’s confidence. It may nothave mattered to Forrestal: like most of the country, he assumed Truman’spolitical career was over and that by the end of the year a Republican,probably Thomas Dewey, would be in the White House.“But Forrestal, not Truman, was the doomed man. His relationship withSymington went from bad to worse. For reasons still unclear, Symingtonembarked, in the words of one author, ‘upon a kind of personal guerillawarfare’ against the Secretary of Defense. Throughout the fall and winter of1948, Forrestal’s mental health, physical condition, and authority as Secretaryof Defense deteriorated. When Truman shocked the world in November bywinning the Presidential election, Forrestal had still not obtained a budgetconsensus from the Joint Chiefs. Friends commented on his growing paranoia.He was convinced that ‘foreign-looking men’ were following him, and thatSymington was spying on him. Forrestal’s belief eventually came to theattention of Truman and Secret Service Chief U. E. Baughman, who decidedthat Forrestal was suffering from ‘a total psychotic breakdown.’“On January 11, 1949, Truman informed Forrestal that Louis Johnson wouldsoon replace him as Secretary of Defense. By now, Symington and AttorneyGeneral Tom Clark were feeding stories to journalist Drew Pearson, inparticular that Forrestal complained of ‘being followed by Jews or Zionistagents.’ Forrestal accused Clark of having the FBI shadow him, which Clarkdenied, but which according to all of Forrestal’s biographers could well havebeen true. Forrestal finally left office in a formal ceremony on March 28,1949, his last public appearance.“ What followed after the ceremony remains mysterious. ‘There is something Iwould like to talk to you about,’ Symington told Forrestal, and accompanied"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"him privately during the ride back to the Pentagon. What Symington said isnot known, but Forrestal emerged from the ride deeply upset, eventraumatized, upon arrival at his office. Friends of Forrestal implied thatSymington said something that ‘shattered Forrestal’s last remaining defenses.’When someone entered Forrestal’s office several hours later, the formerSecretary of Defense did not notice. Instead, he sat rigidly at his desk, staringat the bare wall, incoherent, repeating the sentence, ‘you are a loyal fellow,’for several hours.”DID FORRESTAL KNOW ABOUT THE NON-HUMAN SITUATION?Probably.WHY HAS THE CIA KILLED PEOPLE TO KEEP THE E. T. SITUATION COVEREDUP ?I'm not exactly sure. I do remember reading a CIA file on Harry Truman in which he wastalking about the Cold War starting and that there were aliens from outer space and somelooked like little humans and some looked like insects.WHO HAD WRITTEN THAT?I don't remember. It had to be someone who had taken down his comments in a meeting.TRUMAN FORMED THE CIA.Yes, I know he did in September 1947.IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THE PEOPLE PICKED FOR THE NEW CENTRALINTELLIGENCE AGENCY IN 1947 WOULD HAVE BEEN FROM THE SAME OSSINTELLIGENCE CROWD THAT WORKED ON CRACKING THE JAPANESE CODEIN WWII?I know a lot of people from the OSS were rolled into the CIA.JUST LIKE ANTHONY BARDEN.Yes, he was just rolled right over into it from the OSS.SO, IN THE TRUMAN FILE YOU SAW IN THE CIA BASEMENT ARCHIVE, THEREWAS A MEMO ABOUT A MEETING OF THE NEW CIA AND PRESIDENTTRUMAN?Yes, the document quoted Truman saying something like, ‘We've got the Cold Warsituation. These Russians are going nuts. We have enough to deal with on that front andnow we've got aliens that look like little humans and others that look like insects.’ANY PHOTOGRAPHS OR DRAWINGS IN THE FILE?No. It was printed out like the minutes of the meeting.WAS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT WHAT FORRESTAL MIGHT HAVE DONE ORSAID THAT WOULD MERIT HIS ASSASSINATION BY THE CIA?There was nothing in the file that explained why because after Anthony told me the CIAkilled Forrestal, I asked him why they would do that. And he said he did not know, but thatmaybe Forrestal - as the new and first American Secretary of Defense – thought thegovernment should be honest with the public and tell them about the alien retrievals.” That was the last conversation I ever had with Stein because he asked me not to phone orwrite him any more. In 2008, I received a communication that he had died.* * * * * Return to Part 1Return to Part 19More Information:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"For further information about American government secrets about the non-humanphenomena , please see reports below in the Earthfiles Archive:• 02/24/2009 — Part 19: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 02/11/2009 — Part 18: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 02/04/2009 — Part 17: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 01/29/2009 — Updated: Star Field Camouflage On Large V-Shaped Craft Near CapeCanaveral, Florida?• 01/07/2009 — Part 16: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 01/02/2009 — Part 15: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 12/24/2008 — Part 14: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 12/22/2008 — Part 2: CIA, UFOs and Hollywood• 12/19/2008 — Mysterious Multi-Colored Light Patterns in Sky Over Reno, Nevada• 12/17/2008 — Erath County, Texas, Policeman Saw 600-Foot-Diameter Aerial Craft OverStephenville Court House• 12/17/2008 — Updated - Part 1: CIA, UFOs and Hollywood• 12/12/2008 — More Ohio Eyewitnesses See Glowing “Pod” Rise Up to Triangle• 12/09/2008 — Part 13: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 12/04/2008 — Part 12: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 12/02/2008 — Updated: Strange Aerial Object Over Irving, Texas• 11/30/2008 — Part 11: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 11/27/2008 — Part 10: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 11/21/2008 — Colorado State Patrol Officer Encountered UFO and “Human” Stranger• 11/19/2008 — Part 9: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 11/17/2008 — Part 3: Morphing UFO Over Levittown, PA - Scientific Research• 11/17/2008 — Part 4: Morphing UFO Over Levittown, PA - Scientific Research• 11/16/2008 — Part 8: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 11/14/2008 — Part 2: Morphing UFO Over Levittown, PA - Scientific Research• 11/13/2008 — Part 1: Morphing UFO Over Levittown, PA Drops Little Squares of Light• 11/05/2008 — Part 7: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 10/30/2008 — More Encounters with Glowing Humanoids, Green Orbs, Strange AerialLights and “Thunderbirds”• 10/10/2008 — Part 1: Two Pennsylvania Hunters Encountered Strange Lights and LimeGreen, Glowing Humanoid on Oct. 4• 10/03/2008 — Part 6: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 09/24/2008 — Part 5: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 09/12/2008 — Part 4: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 09/09/2008 — Part 1: Getting Close to the “Big Bang” Inside Large Hadron Collider?• 09/09/2008 — Part 2: Getting Close to the “Big Bang” Inside Large Hadron Collider?• 09/07/2008 — Part 3: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 09/02/2008 — Part 2: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 08/27/2008 — Part 1: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 08/06/2008 — Updated - Part 3: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo Links Government UFOCover-Up and JFK Assassination• 08/06/2008 — Part 4: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo Links Government UFO Cover-Upand JFK Assassination• 12/19/2008 — Mysterious Multi-Colored Light Patterns in Sky Over Reno, Nevada• 12/17/2008 — Erath County, Texas, Policeman Saw 600-Foot-Diameter Aerial Craft OverStephenville Court House• 12/17/2008 — Updated - Part 1: CIA, UFOs and Hollywood• 12/12/2008 — More Ohio Eyewitnesses See Glowing “Pod” Rise Up to Triangle• 12/02/2008 — Updated: Strange Aerial Object Over Irving, Texas• 11/21/2008 — Colorado State Patrol Officer Encountered UFO and “Human” Stranger• 11/09/2002 — UPDATED: Majestic-12 Documents with Ryan Wood About ExtraterrestrialTechnologies• 10/30/2008 — More Encounters with Glowing Humanoids, Green Orbs, Strange AerialLights and “Thunderbirds”• 10/10/2008 — Part 1: Two Pennsylvania Hunters Encountered Strange Lights and LimeGreen, Glowing Humanoid on Oct. 4• 08/12/2008 — Part 2: Rise of Fourth Reich -Where Is the Nazi “Die Glocke?”• 08/01/2008 — Part 1: Rise of Fourth Reich in America?• 07/12/2008 — Updated - Part 2: Roswell Rock Matches August 2, 1996, U.
