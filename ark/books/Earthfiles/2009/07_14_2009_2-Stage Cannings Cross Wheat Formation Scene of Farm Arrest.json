July 4, 2009 Cannings Cross near Allington, Wiltshire County, England - TheCannings Cross wheat pattern near Allington, Wiltshire, England, has been evolvingthrough great confusion. The farm owner originally took his tractor into the first part of theformation reported on June 27, 2009, and drove in big circles to cut down the interior"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"points of the pattern. Eva-Marie Brekkestø flew over the pattern after the farmer'sdestruction and took the first aerial photograph. A computer graphics artist north ofWiltshire known as Psycho Clown then volunteered to reconstruct what the formationlooked like before the farmer's tractor destruction and produced a Photoshopreconstruction.Then on July 10, the formation evolved into a second part with more circles added to theoutside points and the damaged interior points were reconstructed into fresh points.By the night of July 12 to 13, the angry farm owner apparently hired a man to walk thefield with a gun and shoot any “croppies” that entered. Then yesterday afternoon, July 13,2009, the Wiltshire Police arrested either the hired man or the farmer allegedly for firing ashot gun. The news was carried in the July 14, 2009, edition of the Gazette & Herald.Tuesday, July 14, 2009, Gazette & Herald, Wiltshire, England.This morning, July 14, 2009, I also received the following communication from PsychoClown and report it here for more clarity. As this story continues to unfold, Earthfiles willreport follow ups on the police arrest and any more additions or changes to the Allingtonformation.From: thepsychoclownSubject: Re: From Linda Moulton Howe inquiry, July 14, 2009Date: July 14, 2009 11:03:35 AM MDTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comHi LindaThe formation was reported first on June 27th, and before anyone could get inthe air to photograph it, the farmer took his mower to it and partially destroyedit.
