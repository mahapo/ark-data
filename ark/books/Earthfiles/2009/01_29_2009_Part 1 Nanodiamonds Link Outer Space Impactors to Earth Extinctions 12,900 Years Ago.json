January 29, 2009 Eugene, Oregon - 14,000 years ago, the last Ice Age was ending atthe close of the Pleistocene. The Earth was warming up, forests began to grow back andlarge animals such as the Irish Elk and the Woolly Mammoth flourished in Europe andNorth America. In fact, temperatures were even warmer than they are today. NorthAmerica was teeming with very large animals such as giant sloths, American lions andcamels, saber-toothed tigers, mammoths and mastodons.But then suddenly 12,900 years ago, something mysterious plunged much of the NorthernHemisphere back into a Big Freeze in less than one year. Scientists call that puzzling, rapidcooling the “Younger Dryas,” named after an alpine wildflower. Temperatures dropped soquickly that Siberian mammoths have been found preserved in ancient ice with quick-frozen buttercups in their mouths.First whole mammoth to be unearthed in 1900 in Siberia was calledthe Beresovka mammoth.

Orboth? Now, the mystery of what happened 12,900 years ago might finally be solved.Skeletal head of a sabre-toothed tiger in w hich canine teeth grew upto 8 inches (20 centimeters) long and extended down from the mouth evenwhen the mouth was closed.

See: PNAS Website.“Younger Dryas ‘black mats’ and the Rancholabrean terminationin North America.”Contributed by C. Vance Haynes, Jr., January 23, 2008.Departments of Anthropology and GeosciencesUniversity of Arizona, Tucson, AZ.AbstractOf the 97 geoarchaeological sites of this study that bridge thePleistocene-Holocene transition (last deglaciation), approximatelytwo thirds have a black organic-rich layer or ‘black mat’ in theform of mollic paleosols, aquolls, diatomites, or algal mats withradiocarbon ages suggesting they are stratigraphic manifestationsof the Younger Dryas cooling episode 10,900 B.P. [ 12,900 yearsago] to 9,800 B.P. [ 11,800 years ago ] radiocarbon years.This layer or mat covers the Clovis-age landscape or surface onwhich the last remnants of the terminal Pleistocene megafaunaare recorded. Stratigraphically and chronologically, the YoungerDryas extinction appears to have been catastrophic, seeminglytoo sudden and extensive for either human predation or climatechange to have been the primary cause. This suddenRancholabrean termination at 10,900 ± 50 B.P.[ 12,900 years ago] appears to have coincided with the suddenclimatic switch from Allerød warming to Younger Dryas cooling.Recent evidence for extraterrestrial impact, although not yetcompelling, needs further testing because a remarkable majorperturbation occurred at 10,900 B.P. that needs to be explained.]The January 2, 2009, issue of the journal Science, presented research by Douglas Kennett,Ph.D., and Associate Prof. of Anthropology at the Univ. of Oregon, along with his father,paleontologist James Kennett, Ph.D., at the Univ. of California-Santa Barbara, and half adozen other scientists, including Ted Bunch, Ph.D., a NASA Exobiologist and AdjunctProf. of Geology at Northern Arizona State University in Flagstaff. Their latest researchabout the 12,900-year-old mystery is in a paper entitled, “Nanodiamonds in the YoungerDryas Boundary Sediment Layer.” In fact, the nanodiamonds discovered are often layeredon top of the extinct animal bones."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Iridium and n-diamonds were found in the bulk sediment of the Younger Dryassedimentary layer at Murray Springs, Arizona.

These animal bones do notoccur above the sedimentary layers in well-stratified sections.YOU FOUND THE NANODIAMONDS ONLY IN THE 12,900-YEAR-LAYER, NOTABOVE OR BELOW?That’s correct. We’ve looked above and below in the geological and archaeologicalsections we have investigated and the nanodiamonds occur in sediments dating to 12,900years ago, but not above or below.WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDING NANODIAMONDS IN THAT SPECIFICLAYER AS IT RELATES TO THE END OF THE PLEISTOCENE AND THEEXTRAORDINARY DEATHS OF SO MANY ANIMALS AROUND THE WORLD?Well, nanodiamonds only form under very high temperatures and pressures consistent witha major cosmic impact event. It’s very hard to explain their presence in these sedimentsjust based on other kinds of surficial processes. And, of course, increased temperaturesand pressures would have had major repercussions for the environment in North America,including vegetation and animals and humans that were on the landscape at the time. Outer Space Impacts Ended Clovis CultureAlong with Large Animals?ONE OF THE BIG ONES WAS THE CLOVIS.Yes, Clovis culture. The same nanodiamond stratum sits directly above Clovis artifact sitessuch as Murray Springs, Arizona, and Blackwater Draw near Portales, New Mexico, aresome of the classic Clovis period sites. And it’s similar to the animal remains. We do notsee Clovis artifacts above this nanodiamond stratum in well-preserved archaeologicaldeposits.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - Historically, Clovis was a human culture 13,000years ago that lived and hunted all over North America with unique Clovisfluted and bifacial arrowheads. Clovis people may have been the last humansto observe the large animals of the Pleistocene before the extinction eventthat apparently ended the Clovis as well.Clovis points from various sites in North America.Image courtesy Center for the Study of the FirstAmericans, Texas A&M University.Fluted points like the Clovis have not been found in adjacent continents. Thefluted bifacial spear point appears unique to North America. Other relatedstone tools can be found in the Upper Paleolithic cultures of the Old Worldbut not the Clovis point. The Clovis point has not been found in Siberia asmight be expected if the culture originated in northeast Asia. Paradoxically,the closest analogue to the Clovis technology, especially with its distinctivebi-face manufacturing methods, lies in the area of of Spain and France withthe Solutrean culture.]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The destruction would have been instantaneous. People living in the immediate vicinity ofimpact or airbursts would pretty much have been annihilated. And where the impacts andairbursts would have occurred, there would have been a lot of debris kicked up into theatmosphere. And I can imagine there would have been major sound – even hard to imaginethe senses that would have been involved in all this. Also, the wildfires triggered by all thiswould have put smoke and soot up into the atmosphere that would also have had majoratmospheric effects in terms of obscuring the sun for fairly long periods of time.I FOUND A QUOTE FROM CHARLES DARWIN, THE FAMOUS NATURALIST. HEWAS WRITING ABOUT HIS OWN SHOCK AT THE EXTINCTION OF SPECIES ATTHE CLOSE OF THE PLEISTOCENE AND THIS IS WHAT HE WROTE: ‘THEEXTINCTION OF SPECIES HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THE MOST GRATUITOUSMYSTERY. NO ONE CAN HAVE MARVELLED MORE THAN I AT THEEXTINCTION OF SPECIES.’ HE DECLARED THAT FOR WHOLE SPECIES TO BEDESTROYED IN SOUTHERN PATAGONIA, IN BRAZIL, IN THE MOUNTAINRANGES OF PERU AND IN NORTH AMERICA UP TO THE BERING STRAITS, ONEMUST, ‘SHAKE THE ENTIRE FRAMEWORK OF THE GLOBE.’IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOUR HYPOTHESIZED SWARM WAS GLOBAL – SOMEKIND OF IMPACT FROM OUTER SPACE THAT HIT BOTH NORTHERN ANDSOUTHERN HEMISPHERES?It’s possible. There actually is some pretty tantalizing evidence that there are similar typesof sediments down in South America. We need to find out if these nanodiamonds and othermaterials occur in a sedimentary layer above the animals in South America.AT THE TIME OF THE LARGE ANIMAL EXTINCTIONS.Yeah, basically in the late Pleistocene we had 35 animal genera [ plural of genus; eachgenus has many species], which includes many species that are known to have goneextinct in the late Pleistocene. Now the timing of all that is not closely tied to 12,900 yearsago, but 16 genera are 12,900 years ago. If you look carefully at the data, it looks like afairly abrupt extinction of 16 genera at this time. That’s both from the radiocarbon recordsand also the stratigraphic records in the sediments across North America of the bones ofthese animals. You come to a certain point at sediments dating to 12,900 years ago thatcontain a variety of exotic materials like microspherules and carbon spherules and iridium– things that have been tied to other impact events and now we’re adding to theassemblage of the nanodiamonds that are known to form under high temperatures andpressures that we argue are consistent with a cosmic impact event.” Did Comet Debris Impactwith Earth 12,900 Years Ago?What was that cosmic impact event? One of the nanodiamond team scientists is TedBunch, Ph.D., Adjunct Professor of Geology at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff.Dr. Bunch also worked at NASA for 31 years as a research scientist and manager ofexobiology. He thinks a swarm of comets, or comet debris, collided with the Earth andproduced very hot, gaseous airburst explosions and direct hits on the Ice Age sheets stillcovering much of the Northern Hemisphere.Interview:Ted Bunch, Ph.D., Former NASA Research Scientist and Exobiology Manager andnow Adjunct Professor of Geology, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, Arizona: “What we’re projecting here is an impact by swarm of comets that were actuallycometary pieces from a break up in outer space. These are known. There are at least 60such break ups that have been observed. And I think the Earth encountered one of thesecluster comets. The pieces were maybe spread maybe hundreds of kilometers apart and"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"maybe 1,000 to 2,000 kilometers in length. And they rained down on North America,probably over the Canadian ice sheet called the Laurentide.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “The Laurentide Ice Sheet covered hundreds ofthousands of square miles, including most of Canada and a large portion of thenorthern United States, between 95,000 and 20,000 years before present day.Its southern margin included the modern sites of New York City and Chicago.Up to two miles thick and much thinner at its edges, this ice sheet was theprimary feature of the North American ice age. ]“And maybe the comet pieces made some craters in the ice, but the smaller objectsprobably detonated in the atmosphere and caused massive fires in the lower part ofCanada and throughout the United States.Some of the diamonds have been made possibly by an impact of one of the comet clusterswith the ice in Canada. What you need to get the high pressures, you need to have animpact of body against body. If you have a detonation, like an atomic detonation or anaerial burst with respect to the particles that exploded in the atmosphere, you produce veryhigh temperatures – not necessarily high pressures.But there are a lot of parts of this scenario that say that we have a mixture of very highpressure-formed diamonds, some of which could have come in with the comet and formedextraterrestrially. But the specific type of diamonds called ‘n-type’ diamonds – there aretrillions of these guys. They were formed by very high temperature and then it wasquenched. It was just like you took something that was 5,000 degrees F. and you stuck itimmediately in the cold water. That’s how you form some of the diamond forms that wehave found.YOUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT HIGH-TEMPERATURE DEBRIS HIT THE ICE SHEET?Hit the ice sheet and possibly in forested areas because that’s how these intense fire stormsprobably started. Some of the comet clusters hitting the ice – the big pieces possiblymaking craters – impacting and making the high pressure and temperature forms ofdiamonds: the cubic, hexagonal and the more common diamonds, which are not highpressure, but high temperature, the N-diamonds, probably formed from the rapid and veryintense burning of biomass forests. “Impact Winter”THE FIRES FROM THE FORESTS, MIXED WITH DEBRIS THROWN UP INTO THEATMOSPHERE, COULD HAVE CAUSED WHAT CARL SAGAN USED TO CALL THE‘NUCLEAR WINTER?’Yes, we call it the ‘impact winter,’ not to be confused with atomic warfare. But you’reright, the dust – not necessarily from the impact of the Y. D. (Younger Dryas) eventbecause we don’t have craters, but we have massive fire burning. We find charcoal andsoot at all the 51 sites in North America and in Europe. So, there were extensive fires, andthat material – the bad gases from fires and particulates.CUT OUT SUNLIGHT FROM THE SUN.Yes. Interestingly, Prof. Vance Haynes, who is a noted vertebrate paleontologist, spent alife time looking at the remains of just these sorts of fossils. And he finds that the layers ofthe Younger Dryas and the black mat that covers the Younger Dryas (Y.D.) covered thesebones right on top. None of these animals were found above what we call the black mat,the Younger Dryas boundary. The animal fossils were all there and covered by thismaterial, which means that most passed away rather rapidly during and after the event.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - Black Mats and Clovis, the first archaeologist todescribe the black mat on an archaeological site was C. Vance Haynes, who inthe 1960s was working at the Murray Springs Clovis site in southeasternArizona, where he noticed a layer of black matted material directly on top ofthe Clovis occupation layer. The black mat is a thin layer of organic materialthat Haynes thought at the time represented evidence of a drought. Blackmats vary in color and content, but they are always found to have beencreated in moist to wet conditions such as ponds, elevated or perched watertables, boggy areas, wet meadows and the margins of spring pools. Scientistsdebate the genesis of these mats, but one possible theory is that in a shallowpond, for example, dead plants and animals filter through the water and dropto the bottom, creating a thick organic layer.None of the black mats investigated at these Clovis sites contained any Clovis"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"nor any evidence of any of the Pleistocene fauna and Haynes discovered thatblack mats are fairly common and often right above Clovis sites. ] I WAS READING IN AN ARTICLE ABOUT THE YOUNGER DRYAS THAT SAIDTHIS WAS THE MOST RAPID CHANGE IN CLIMATE ON RECORD TO DATE.From what we know – records don’t go back billions of years – but certainly when theclimate lowered so rapidly it would have been catastrophic!PROF. KENNETT SAID THAT THERE WAS MAJOR CHANGE FROM WHAT WASWARMING TO WHAT WAS MORE A ‘BIG FREEZE’ IN LESS THAN ONE YEAR.That’s right. We talk about, ‘Ah, global warming of 1 degree F. in 100 years.’ Big deal! Butthere with the Younger Dryas event, we are dropping temperatures several degrees overnight and that created a Big Freeze, another thing that probably was responsible for thedemise of the animals that went to extinction.”Anthropologist Leonard Cedric commented in 1979 about the mysterious Younger Dryasextinctions:“The event was worldwide. The mammoths of Siberia became extinct aboutthe same time as the giant rhinoceros of Europe; the mastodons of Alaska andthe bison of Siberia ended simultaneously. The same is true of the Asianelephants and the American camels. The cause of these extinctions must becommon to both hemispheres. If the coming of glacial conditions was gradual,it would not have caused the extinctions, because the various animals couldhave simply migrated to where conditions were better. What is seen here istotal surprise – and uncontrolled violence.” Continued in Part 2 - Younger Dryas event 12,900 years ago might have been likeTunguska, Siberia, in 1908, when an outer space airburst explosion burned and knockeddown millions of trees over 830 square miles (2,150 square kilometres).More Information:For further reports about Earth climate changes, please see Earthfiles Archive:• 12/21/2008 — Mystery of Missing East Coast Acorns• 10/24/2008 — Rapidly Changing Earth• 08/15/2008 — Amphibian Warning Bell of Mass Extinctions• 06/21/2008 — Updated June 25, 2008: Increasingly Acidic Pacific Coast Waters ThreatenMarine Life• 03/27/2008 — Ice Block Size of Northern Ireland Has Broken From Wilkins Ice Shelf inWest Antarctic Peninsula• 02/29/2008 — Mysterious Bat Deaths in New York, Vermont and Massachusetts• 01/18/2008 — Amphibians Dying Out At Alarming Rate• 01/10/2008 — Solar Cycle 24 Has Begun• 10/05/2007 — Earlier, Faster and Deeper Arctic Ice Melt Down• 08/08/2007 — 2007's Warm, Erratic Global Weather• 07/11/2007 — Mystery of Night Shining Clouds - Another Global Warming Change?• 06/28/2007 — Hackenberg Apiary, Pennsylvania - 75-80% Honey Bee Loss in 2007.
