By early Saturday morning, the first beam of particlesshould be circulating one way around the LHC’s 17-mile-long underground ring. Then asecond beam traveling in the opposite direction should start soon after. But the firstlow-energy collisions won't happen until about a week later.The goal is to understand how the cosmos is put together at the subatomic level thatcreates our matter worlds along with mysterious dark matter, dark energy and the quantumtheory of supersymmetry. The European Organization for Nuclear Research, known asCERN, has built the world's largest particle physics laboratory called the Large HadronCollider, or LHC. Hadrons are particles made of quarks held together by the strong force.Proton collisions in the collider near the speed of light might finally reveal other particlesand extra dimensions theorized in modern physics.A year ago on September 10, 2008, as the LHC was being revved up for proton collisiontests, faulty wiring and weak welds tore a hole in the accelerator's wall, melted downseveral large superconducting magnets and released liquid helium into the tunnel.See: September 2008 2-Part EarthfilesAfter a whole year of many repairs and improvements, CERN scientists and engineers aregetting ready for actual proton collisions. What might come out of high-energy collisionscould be the illusive Higgs boson that has never been detected, but which physicists thinkis responsible for the mass of every particle and is a key to cosmic construction. That'swhy it's affectionately called the “God particle.” Recently physicists at the Niels BohrInstitute hypothesized that Nature itself is interfering with discovery of the Higgs boson byusing the future to sabotage the Large Hadron Collider. On top of that was last year'sunfounded rumor that mini-black holes could be created by the LHC and destroy Earth.But CERN is made up of sixty European member states representing 500 universities. Atleast 10,000 physicists are eager for the LHC to work at high energy and none are worriedabout mini-black holes or interference from the future. If all goes well, by Christmas theLHC will be running in 2.2 trillion electronvolt tests. Then by February 2010, the plan is torev up the LHC to at least three times the maximum energy of the Fermi Lab in Chicago,Illinois. Fermi is in friendly competition with LHC physicists to be the first to discover theHiggs boson.In fact University of Michigan research physicist and muon particle expert, StevenGoldfarb, Ph.D., has a bet with one of his CERN colleagues that his muon spectrometer inthe ATLAS experiment, one of four that will be active in the LHC, will be the first todiscover the Higgs boson.Recently I talked with him about the LHC getting back to work amid public and media"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"nervousness about mini-black holes and sabotage from the future.Steven Goldfarb, Ph.D., LHC Muon Spectrometer Investigator,ATLAS Experiment and Research Physicist, University of Michigan,in front of LHC “Big Wheel,” Geneva, Switzerland. Image courtesy Steven Goldfarb.Interview:Steven Goldfarb, Ph.D., Muon Spectrometer Investigator, ATLAS Experiment,CERN and Univ. of Michigan, Geneva, Switzerland: “When we get up to the firstcollisions, which will be at 1 TeV – that’s a thousand, billion electron volts (EVs) – whenwe get there and make collisions, the actual energy of those collisions is something similarto a fly flapping its wings. So in human terms, it is extremely low energy. In terms for usand our capability to create dense collisions of this sort, it’s higher energy than we’ve everbeen before.SINCE THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST NERVOUSLY ANTICIPATED EXPERIMENTS OFALL TIME GIVEN THE FACT THAT A YEAR AGO BEFORE THERE WAS THEMELT DOWN OF THE SEVERAL HUGE SUPER-CONDUCTING MAGNETS, THEREHAD BEEN AN EFFORT TO TRY TO STOP THE ENTIRE LARGE HADRONCOLLIDER COMPLETELY BECAUSE OF THE FEAR THAT MINI-BLACK HOLESWOULD BE CREATED AND THAT THE EARTH COULD END UP BEINGDESTROYED – THAT WAS ONE ISSUE. AND THE SECOND ISSUE NOW RAISED INTHE END OF 2009 HAS COME FROM THE THEORETICAL WORK OF HOLGERNIELSEN (NIELS BOHR INSTITUTE) IN WHICH HE IS SAYING THE VERY ACT OFTRYING TO FIND THE HIGGS BOSON COULD PROVOKE SOME HOW THEUNIVERSE FROM THE FUTURE TO STOP THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER.AS A PHYSICIST WORKING THERE RIGHT NOW WITH MUONS. CAN YOU TALKABOUT BOTH OF THOSE ISSUES?I’d love to. It’s very fun when people have great imaginations and it has certainly broughtus into the spotlight. But let me start by addressing the first issue, which was in fact raisedyears before we started (the LHC project) – the issue that we were going to createmini-black holes and destroy the Earth. Those (protesting) were not scientists! There wereabsolutely no scientists who would say there was any possibility whatsoever of causing"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"any damage.Let me explain why I’m so confident in the fact that this is a fallacy. This can’t happen(creation of black hole that would swallow Earth). Ask anyone in physics and they will tellyou that. The reason is that at the LHC – even though we’re building the biggest colliderever built going to the highest energy, what we’re going to create when we have collisionsin the center of the LHC has already been done by Mother Nature tens of thousands oftimes before and I’m just talking about in our own solar system, for example.There are cosmic rays out there in space of very high energy and there are plenty of them.During this conversation, anybody listening has had muons pass through them hundreds oftimes. So these things are going on already and all we’re doing in the LHC is bringing theseparticles together in one place under what I would call giant microscopes. Our detectorsare essentially microscopes designed to look at the smallest bits of Nature. The LHCaccelerator is just going to concentrate and bring all these guys together in a place wherewe can measure them.Now, since Mother Nature has been doing this tens of thousands of times over already andthe world is still here – black holes have not been created here because of these processes.So, you can say with pretty good confidence that we’re not going to be able to do that(make black holes).Now, the reason that the word ‘black hole’ came into play at all is because there was avery fascinating theory that was brought up by a theorist from Harvard University asked,‘What if there are extra dimensions out there?’We can’t perceive these other dimensions easily, and yet they are there. And it could bepossible that when we go to the energy density of the collisions we have at the LHC, itcould be possible we’ll get a little view of these. It could explain, for example, why gravityis so weak – that we’re only seeing a little part of gravity in our dimension.One of the views we have is that if we were able to measure this that we would see whatare called ‘mini-black holes.’ These would be things that would just appear and disappearin an instance and the trace we would have of them would be a bunch of particles that allshot out. We would see a bunch of particles shooting out from it and that’s it! We won’tsee the Earth disintegrating, but we’ll see something new. It’s a black hole in the technicalsense. It’s not in the sense that we know black holes that everyone is familiar with and arecreated by enormous masses, by huge stars that have grown old and decayed and collapsedin on themselves and there is a tremendous amount of mass out there creating that. We (atLHC) are way on the other end of the scale!So anything we create will disappear instantly and give us some small traces. That wouldbe exciting to see that.IT WOULD BE EXCITING IF YOU ACTUALLY DID CAPTURE EVIDENCE OF AMINI-BLACK HOLE BEING CREATED.Yes, we would be thrilled! It would give us a new picture of why there is such a wide rangeof forces out there and give us some idea where to look in the future for new physics. Higgs Boson Search Provoking Cosmic Sabotage?WHAT ABOUT THE CURRENT HEADLINES FROM HOLGER NIELSEN’SHYPOTHESIS THAT THE SEARCH FOR A HIGGS BOSON PARTICLE ALONEMIGHT BE PROVOKING THE UNIVERSE IN THE FUTURE TO BE TRYING SOMEHOW TO HALT THE DISCOVERY OF THIS HIGGS BOSON AT THE LARGEHADRON COLLIDER?That’s amazing! It’s amazing science fiction stuff! I mean, someone should write a movieabout this. (laughs) From our point of view, it was a bad welding job (melt down ofmagnets) and we can measure the mistakes that we made.These (wiring and welding mistakes) to me are pretty mundane things and to try to blamesome particle from the future telling us, ‘No, we don’t want you to discover me!’ It takesan excellent imagination!Most of the theorists I have talked to who have read through it (Nielsen’s paper) came tothe same conclusion, ‘This is garbage.’ Higgs Boson, the “God Particle”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A diagram in Standard Model particle physics of Higgs boson interactionwith other subatomic particles. Black circles represent types of particles, and blue arcsconnecting them represent interactions that can take place. The organization of the diagramis as follows: the top row of leptons and quarks are the matter particles; the second rowof photons, W/Zs and gluons are the force mediating particles; and the bottomrow is the Higgs boson. Illustration source Steven Goldfarb.DR. GOLDFARB, WHY IS THE HIGGS BOSON REFERRED TO AS A ‘GODPARTICL E’?It plays a fundamental role in that all of the other particles interact with it. We assumedthat the Higgs boson existed because if we don’t assume in our current particle theory thatthe Higgs exists, the whole theory falls apart! So this is one of the reasons we are reallylooking for it. We call it the particle that gives other particles mass, and it’s justfundamental in our theory.The photons that give us light interact with everything that is charged. The Higgs bosoninteracts with everything that has mass and that’s the vast majority of our particles. So, itplays an extremely important and fundamental role and we would have to find some otherexplanation if it didn’t exist. So our understanding relies on its existence and will changedramatically if it does not exist.Our theories have to hold up to lots of tests. If you want it to hold up, it had better have avery strong mortar holding those bricks together. And I think really that the Higgs boson isa mortar holding all of this theory together. You can maybe take out a brick, replace it, putin a window and it’s not going to change the theory dramatically.I think of the Higgs really as this mortar that is holding that building together. If we don’tfind it, we’ve got to find something else to hold it together, or our whole theory will cometumbling down.IF THE HIGGS BOSON IS THE MORTAR AMONG PARTICLES, WHY IS IT SOILLUSIVE? WHY HAS IT BEEN SO DIFFICULT TO FIND?Well, it manifests itself as a particle and that particle simply is more massive than otherparticles that we’ve had the ability to create.The Higgs is not necessarily so illusive. If the Higgs is there the way we predict it in thesimplest of all models, it’s been there all the time. We just haven’t been able to see itbecause we haven’t had the tools to see it.There are galaxies out there in space that have been there for nearly the lifetime of theuniverse. They are not being illusive. They are just so far away that we couldn’t see themuntil we built the Hubble telescope. And the Higgs boson is just more massive thananything we’ve been able to look at up until now. Will LHC Beat Fermi Labin Race to Find Higgs Boson?SO THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER WILL BE THE ONLY INSTRUMENT ONEARTH THAT COULD HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO FIND THE HIGGS BOSONPARTICL E?We think so. We have a lot of our colleagues are working at Fermi lab in two experiments.Those two experiments are colliding photons and antiprotons at 1 GeV a piece – somethingwe hope to do with the LHC next month (December 2009). Fermi is looking as hard asthey can to find the Higgs boson and why not find it before us? It’s a good, healthy"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"competition. They are working very hard to see if they can find it first.Depending upon the mass of the Higgs boson, it could be possible for Fermi to find itbefore we can get going with the LHC and understand our data enough to surpass them.If Fermi doesn’t find it in the next year or so, and the LHC works as smoothly as weexpect it to work, within a year or so, it’s time to turn off Fermi lab because we will havepassed them. Then we will be the only kid on the block with a big enough baseball bat tohit the home run.IF YOU DON’T FIND THE HIGGS BOSON PARTICLE THEN AT THE LHC, WHATWOULD HAPPEN NEXT IN TERMS OF PARTICLE PHYSICS?If we don’t find the Higgs boson as we think of it as a simple particle, we will certainlyfind something else – something that will give us a clue and it will be at some certain massthat it will appear.[ Editor’s Note: Beyond LHC is International Linear Collider (ILC) to changefrom going around in a circle to a straight line for more power to measure theHiggs boson in as detailed a manner as possible.]We would not be stumped and say, ‘OK, we can’t find it. We would do everything we canto try to find what there is out there until we are satisfied with our understanding ofNature. Dark Energy, Dark Matter and SupersymmetryAge of Universe: 13.3+ billion years Composition: .4% glowing matter such as stars. 3.6% “normal” matter as we know it in planets and stars. 22.0% cold, invisible “ dark matter” detectable only by its gravitational influenceon normal matter. 74.0% invisible “dark energy.” Size: At least 42 billion light-years and expanding. Shape: Debate whether curved, finite space versus flat, infinite space.Most recent data favors flat and infinite.WILL THE DISCOVERY OF THE HIGGS BOSON PARTICLE, IF THAT HAPPENS,HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER ARE?We hope so. We’re not only looking for the Higgs boson particle. There is a wonderfultheory proposed called ‘Supersymmetry.’ If there is anything we have learned in doingphysics over the past 100 years or so is that Nature tends to create symmetries. By that Imean, we once found electricity that we thought was a separate thing from magnetism. Butby doing the math properly and making a nice theory, we found that electricity andmagnetism are the same things.This was a wonderful, new, symmetric theory made by Maxwell back at the end of the19th Century. We keep finding that there are symmetries.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - “James Clerk Maxwell (13 June 1831 – 5November 1879) was a Scottish theoretical physicist and mathematician. Hismost important achievement was classical electromagnetic theory,synthesizing all previous unrelated observations, experiments and equations ofelectricity, magnetism and even optics into a consistent theory. His set ofequations - Maxwell's equations - demonstrated that electricity, magnetismand even light are all manifestations of the same phenomenon: theelectromagnetic field. From that moment on, all other classic laws orequations of these disciplines became simplified cases of Maxwell's equations.Maxwell's work in electromagnetism has been called the ‘second greatunification in physics,’ after the first one carried out by Isaac Newton.” ]Supersymmetry predicts a bunch of new particles. So we allow this theory because it givesus concrete predictions. It says Supersymmetry explains Nature and it tells us we’re goingto find this, this and this. Some of those particles are actually particles that have mass, butwhich we would never have measured with any of the means that we have now. Thatcould help to explain dark matter and dark energy."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Muons Critical in Search for Higgs Bosonand Supersymmetry ParticlesMuons will be one of many different particles that will come out of the center of thecollisions and are critical in our search for the Higgs boson and Supersymmetry becausemuons give a very clear signal. It’s hard to miss it. They hit you over the top of the head.You can see a particle that has gone straight through and is charged and makes it all theway through the detector with a nice isolated track – we know it’s a muon. And because ofthe precision of our detector, we can measure the momentum of that muon extremely well.When we take a couple of those muons and put them together, we can then suppose whatthe mass was of a particle that would have decayed to them. By statistically puttingtogether all of the muons in all of the different (particle collision) events, we can seewhether or not a particle is getting produced that has a specific mass. If we see that andwe’re finding some particle that was created at the collision, which has a certain mass andwe’ve never seen it before, that’s a discovery!THAT MIGHT BE THE WAY YOU WOULD FIND THE HIGGS BOSON?I think there is a very probability. In fact, I already put a bottle of wine on this. I have acolleague from the inner detector that measures not only the tracks of the muons, butelectrons. And we have a bottle of good wine on this as to whether we’ll find the Higgswith muons or electrons.WELL, IF YOU ARE BETTING A GOOD BOTTLE OF WINE ON A DISCOVERYTHROUGH YOUR MUON EXPERIMENT, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE FULLYEXPECTING THAT YOU WILL DISCOVER THE HIGGS BOSON WITH THE LARGEHADRON COLLIDER?Absolutely! I’m positive of that.IF YOU DON’T FIND THE HIGGS BOSON IN THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER,WHAT HAPPENS?That would mean we had to go back to Square One and actually, I don’t mind going backto Square One.That would mean we would have to re-think things from scratch. Whatever we do, it’sscience. Not finding something, in this case, is as important as finding something.Something is going to be out there. We’re going to find something! We just don’t knowexactly what.”More Information:Four LHC Experiments:1) ATLAS = A Toroidal LHC Apparatus: “ ATLAS is a particle physicsexperiment at the Large Hadron Collider, CERN. The ATLAS detector willsearch for new discoveries in the head-on collisions of protons ofextraordinarily high energy close to light speed. ATLAS will learn about thebasic forces that have shaped our universe since the beginning of time andthat will determine its fate. Among the possible unknowns are the origin ofmass, extra dimensions of space, unification of fundamental forces, andevidence for dark matter candidates in the Universe.”2) CMS = Compact Muon Solenoid: “The CMS experiment uses a general-purpose detector to investigate a wide range of physics, including the searchfor the Higgs boson, extra dimensions, and particles that could make up darkmatter. Although it has the same scientific goals as the ATLAS experiment, ituses different technical solutions and design of its detector magnet system toachieve these. The CMS detector is built around a huge solenoid magnet. Thistakes the form of a cylindrical coil of superconducting cable that generates amagnetic field of 4 teslas, about 100 000 times that of the Earth. The magneticfield is confined by a steel 'yoke' that forms the bulk of the detector's weightof 12 500 tonnes. An unusual feature of the CMS detector is that instead ofbeing built in-situ underground, like the other giant detectors of the LHCexperiments, it was constructed on the surface, before being loweredunderground in 15 sections and reassembled.

It isoptimized to study heavy ion collisions. Pb-Pb nuclei collisions will be studiedat a center of mass energy of 2.76 TeV per nucleon. The resulting temperatureand energy density are expected to be large enough to generate a quark-gluonplasma, a state of matter wherein quarks and gluons are deconfined.“Our ALICE aim is to study the physics of strongly interacting matter atextreme energy densities, where the formation of a new phase of matter, thequark-gluon plasma, is expected. The existence of such a phase and itsproperties are key issues in QCD for the understanding of confinement andof chiral-symmetry restoration. For this purpose, we intend to carry out acomprehensive study of the hadrons, electrons, muons and photons producedin the collision of heavy nuclei. Alice will also study proton-proton collisionsboth as a comparison with lead-lead collisions and in physics areas whereAlice is competitive with other LHC experiments.”4) LHCb = Large Hadron Collider beauty: “Fourteen billion years ago,the universe began with a bang. Crammed within an infinitely small space,energy coalesced to form equal quantities of matter and antimatter. But as theuniverse cooled and expanded, its composition changed. Just one second afterthe Big Bang, antimatter had all but disappeared, leaving matter to formeverything that we see around us – from the stars and galaxies, to the Earthand all life that it supports.LHCb is an experiment set up to explore what happened after the Big Bangthat allowed matter to survive and build the universe we inhabit today.” For further information about the LHC, our cosmos, dark matter and energy, please seeEarthfiles Archive (partial list below):• 09/09/2008 — Part 1: Getting Close to the “Big Bang” Inside Large Hadron Collider?• 09/09/2008 — Part 2: Getting Close to the “Big Bang” Inside Large Hadron Collider?• 08/07/2008 — CERN Announces Start Date for Hadron Collider• 01/12/2008 — Our Milky Way Galaxy On Collision Course with Huge Gas Cloud - 40Million Years from Now• 10/18/2007 — A Quantum Math Description of Parallel Universes• 08/10/2007 — Levitation Possible by Reversing Casimir Force• 08/03/2007 — The Milky Way Is Devouring the Alien Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy• 05/15/2007 — Hubble Finds Dark Matter Ring• 05/08/2007 — Exploded Star 5 Times Brighter Than Any Supernova Seen Before• 01/07/2007 — Universe's Mysterious Dark Matter - First 3-D Map• 01/07/2007 — Universe's Mysterious Dark Matter - First 3-D Map• 04/01/2005 — What's Killing Off Marine Life Every 62 Million Years?• 01/17/2004 — Part 2 - Is Dark Matter the \"Heavy Shadow\" of Light Matter?• 01/13/2004 — Part 1 - Is Dark Matter the \"Heavy Shadow\" of Visible Matter?• 10/25/2003 — Science Data Reinforces Invisible \"Dark\" Matter and Energy Make Up 96%of Our Universe• 05/14/2003 — Hubble Telescope Finds \"Ashes\" of First Stars in This Universe• 02/24/2002 — Mysterious Slowing of Pioneer Spacecraft 7 Billion Miles from Earth• 12/20/2001 — Will Our Universe End With Its Final Light Frozen in Time?• 12/14/2000 — A Pleiadian Star Tears Apart Black Interstellar CloudDark Matte r and Dark Ene rgy:• 08/27/2009 — Part 6: Is Time Travel Past and Future Possible?• 01/12/2008 — Our Milky Way Galaxy On Collision Course with Huge Gas Cloud - 40Million Years from Now• 10/18/2007 — A Quantum Math Description of Parallel Universes• 08/10/2007 — Levitation Possible by Reversing Casimir Force• 08/03/2007 — The Milky Way Is Devouring the Alien Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy• 05/15/2007 — Hubble Finds Dark Matter Ring• 05/08/2007 — Exploded Star 5 Times Brighter Than Any Supernova Seen Before• 01/07/2007 — Universe's Mysterious Dark Matter - First 3-D Map• 06/25/2005 — \"Junk DNA\" That's Not Junk• 04/01/2005 — What's Killing Off Marine Life Every 62 Million Years?• 01/17/2004 — Part 2 - Is Dark Matter the \"Heavy Shadow\" of Light Matter?• 01/13/2004 — Part 1 - Is Dark Matter the \"Heavy Shadow\" of Visible Matter?• 10/25/2003 — Science Data Reinforces Invisible \"Dark\" Matter and Energy Make Up 96%of Our Universe• 02/24/2002 — Mysterious Slowing of Pioneer Spacecraft 7 Billion Miles from Earth• 12/20/2001 — Will Our Universe End With Its Final Light Frozen in Time?• 12/14/2000 — A Pleiadian Star Tears Apart Black Interstellar Cloud• 02/01/1999 — Astronomy Updates with Brian Marsden and John Huchra, Harvard• 01/10/1999 — Updates: Astronomy and Rufus Baughn, Nevada Test Site"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Websites:AT L A S : http://atlas.ch/ATLAS Images: http://atlas.ch/photos/index.htmlCMS: http://cms.web.cern.ch/cms/ALICE: http://aliceinfo.cern.ch/Collaboration/index.htmlhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Large_Ion_Collider_ExperimentLHCb: http://lhcb-public.web.cern.ch/lhcb%2Dpublic/Large Hadron Collider, CERN: http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/LHC/LHC-en.htmlCERN: http://lhc2008.web.cern.ch/LHC2008/index-E.htmlFermi National Accelerator Laboratory: http://www.fnal.gov/Black Holes: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_holeHiggs Bosons: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_bosonSupersymmetry: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SupersymmetryDark Matter: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matterDark Energy: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2010 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2010, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
