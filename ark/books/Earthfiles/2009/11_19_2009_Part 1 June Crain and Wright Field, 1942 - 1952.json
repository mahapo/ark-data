And they were dead.” - June Crain, Secretary, Air Material Command, Wright Field, Ohio, 1942-1952November 19, 2009 Olympia, Washington - Recently in Las Vegas at Ryan Wood's UFOCrash Conference, a former police detective shared a tape recorded interview he did onJune 27, 1997, with a 72-year-old woman who had worked as a secretary for the WarDepartment at Wright Field, Ohio, from 1942 until 1952. Before marriages, her name thenwas June Crain and during her work at Wright Field, she held a SECRET Q clearance(under authority of Atomic Energy Commission), heard about UFO crashes in NewMexico and retrievals of non-human bodies, and even held in her own hands a piece of“spaceship” metal that she could not cut and no matter how hard she twisted, the metalwould always spring back to its original shape.The police detective who interviewed June Crain before her death is James E. Clarkson,58-years-old, who retired from the Aberdeen, Washington, Police Department in 2000because of a knee injury. Now Jim Clarkson investigates for a Washington State agency inthe field of administrative law and is Chief Investigator for Washington State MUFON.Jim became interested in the UFO phenomena after reading John Fuller's book Incident AtExeter concerning 1965 UFO encounters in New Hampshire. Then after he heard aboutthe November 1986 Japanese Air Line pilot's report of large unidentified flying objectsover Alaska and radar confirmation by Anchorage Air Traffic Control, Jim Clarkson beganto read and study more about the mystery. That led to his preparing programs about theUFO phenomena for public libraries, including one in 1993 when he first met June Crain,then June Kaba after a second marriage."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"June M. Crain was born June 19, 1925, in Dayton, Ohio,and graduated Fairmount High School in 1942. That summer she wentto work as a clerk-typist for the War Department's Army Air Forces Air Service Commandat Wright Field, Ohio. She was promoted, received a SECRET Q clearance andworked in Air Materiel Command (AMC) until 1952. June had married by thenClarence Cubbage and they left Wright Field/Wright-Patterson AFB to raise a family.Clarence was later killed in an auto accident. Her second husband was Eugene Kaba whodied in the 1970s. June died on August 23, 1998, in a Hoquiam, Washington, nursing"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"facility after struggling with cancer. Photograph and documents givento James Clarkson by June Crain Kaba before her death.Air Materiel Command confirms “clearance for Access to SECRET Information”to June M. CUBBAGE (nee Crain), dated 1 September 1950 and 4 October 1951.June told James Clarkson she also had an official Q clearance, but no paper confirmation.Interview:James E. Clarkson, Investigator for Washington State Agencies and ChiefInvestigator, MUFON-Washington State, Olympia, Washington: “I gave a program inthe Ocean Shores Library in 1993, and there were probably 40 some people there. When Iwas done, this very determined older woman approached me and looked me right in theeye and said, ‘You're right! The government knows all about UFOs and they are not tellingthe truth. They are keeping it all secret.’I asked, ‘How do you know this?’She said, ‘I can't tell you.’ And I persisted, ‘But how do you know?’ And she said,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"‘Because I worked there.’I asked, ‘Why can't you tell me?’ And she said, ‘Because they will come and arrest me.’At the time, I think part of her reservation in talking to me was that I was the DetectiveSergeant for the Aberdeen, Washington Police Department at the time. That's a town about25 miles away from Ocean Shores. I think June was a little bit worried that maybe I wouldarrest her.HOW DID YOU GET PASSED THAT PSYCHOLOGICAL OBSTACLE?Well, I didn't for four years. I gave her a business card and thanked her and told her Iwould be really interested in talking with her in the future. And it wasn't until 1997 that Igot a surprise phone call from her. That occurred because of the 50th Anniversary ofRoswell (UFO crashes of July 1947) and at the same time that the public was becomingreally interested in Roswell and it was all over the news.That's when we got a heavy dose of, ‘Well, it was really all weather balloons anddummies.’ That was all over CNN. Then one day, my telephone rang and I answered it andthere was June Crain on the other end of the phone. Basically without even saying, ‘Hello,’she said, ‘It's a damn lie!’ She asked, ‘Have you been watching CNN?’ And I said that Ihad. She said, ‘That's the same lie that they used before!’ She said they lied about balloonsa long time ago and they are still lying.Then she said something to me that I've never forgotten. She said, ‘I'm 72-years-old. I'veoutlived two husbands and I've survived cancer twice. What are they going to do - shootme or put me in prison? I can do either one.’I'm not that slow, so I asked, ‘How soon can I be at your house?’ I ended up packing up ayellow pad and eventually a tape recorder - not right at first, but I started going to visit herat her home in Ocean Shores. We sat up late at night and had coffee and she told me herlife story. One time, I asked her if I could tape record her. That led to a very lengthyinterview.The primary interview that I did with June Crain was at her home in Ocean Shores,Washington, and that was on June 27, 1997. It occurred about 10:30 PM Pacific in theevening.SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WHAT AGE?72.SHE LIVED UNTIL WHAT YEAR AND AGE?She died in August of 1998, so she made it just past 73-years-old. I'm not sure how muchJune really knew about the state of her cancer. But she had a document drawn up whereshe said she was giving me the rights to her life story. She never told me that she was goingto do that. She just dropped it on me. So, I believe that she knew (she was dying). Andthat, of course, adds credibility because it's considered universal in any court of law that ifa person thinks they are going to pass away - I mean, obviously if they are going to dieimmediately, it's called a ‘dying declaration.’But just the idea that someone knows they arewrapping up their life - that adds a lot of credibility.WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST IMPORTANT INFORMATION DIRECTLY RELATEDTO ROSWELL, WRIGHT-PATTERSON, BODIES, UFOS THAT YOU HEARD THATNIGHT?Well, she told me that by the time she left Wright-Patterson for the last time in 1952, shesaid they were investigating at least three crashes of alien vehicles and that there waspossibly a fourth. She did not give me exact locations other than to say that Roswell, NewMexico, was one of those.Then there was also an incident where she stated that she had coffee with a man who saidhe had just flown from New Mexico and brought in (non-human) bodies (to Wright Field,Ohio.)THAT IS ONE OF THE AUDIO EXCERPTS THAT WE HAVE. J une Crain Describing Non-HumanBodies Taken to Wright FieldJune Crain, 72, talking to James Clarkson on June 27, 1997, at her Ocean Shores,"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Wa shi ng t o n ho me : “The sergeant, his first name was Clarence, a Master Sergeant. I stillcan't remember that man's last name, but he was in charge of that airplane. And he camethere.WHAT KIND OF AIRPLANE?It was a regular transport.A MILITARY TRANSPORT.Ye s .WHAT WAS IT HE SAID?Came in from New Mexico. He said, ‘What I brought in this morning’ and he said hebrought in ‘two little men.’ He called them ‘little green men.’ Then he described them as a‘greenish-blue.’ And they were 4-feet-tall. And they were dead.WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NON-HUMANS?Non-humans, right, right.DID HE SAY ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT THEM?No, not really.WERE THERE OTHER LADIES THERE AND HE WAS SORT OF LIKE SHOWINGOFF?No.HE WASN'T SHOWING OFF?No. These guys don't show off.THIS IS A SERIOUS MATTER.What I'm saying is that if engineers are sort of wacky, there's one thing they are not. It'snot a wackiness like you would think of just acting like a fool. It's hard to explain, but theyare real serious. They don't tell lies and they don't have jokes. They don't do anything likethat, so when they say something, they don't lie.WAS THIS MASTER SERGEANT BREAKING SECURITY BY TALKING ABOUTTHIS?No, because we were all secure. See, when you have security like that, you can't even takeyour husband to a party. If we had our Christmas party, we went and there was a guard atthe door. And nobody but the people in the branch were the only ones. You couldn't bringyour husband or your wife. And when you are at home, you can't talk about your jobbecause you have that in your head - you've got security and you are cleared and you keepyour damned mouth shut! That's all there is to it. And it's a big burden because there aretimes that you would like to talk about your job, but you can't.’” James Clarkson: JAMES, CAN YOU ELABORATE BEYOND WHAT IS ON THATAUDIO EXCERPT?Yes, because we also discussed this when we did not have the recording on. She clarifiedthat Master Sergeant Clarence - he started describing what happened and initiallyeveryone at the table was horrified thinking that there had been a crash of a militaryaircraft and everyone was sad and upset thinking that perhaps someone they knew haddied in this crash. And then he clarified that, ‘No, the people who were killed were nothuman.’ And that this was not the crash of an airplane.AND THAT'S WHERE SHE HEARD HIM DESCRIBE THE ‘LITTLE GREEN MEN’WHO WERE GREENISH-BLUE?Yes. There was something that happened later on that day that kind of adds weight to thisentire conversation. Wright Field Coffee Room Bugged?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"That was the fact that June recalled what she referred to as a ‘too hot’ memo that came outlater that day and this meant that there was a courier from the commanding officer whowent to every single person who worked there and you were required to stop what youwere doing, read the memorandum and sign off on it stating that you understood it and thatyou would comply. The memo was telling everyone that some irresponsible person hasbeen discussing little green men and crashed saucers and that you will cease and desistimmediately upon penalty of being discharged and possibly being prosecuted.The two things that bothered June about this was: first, if there were no truth to what thisMaster Sergeant Clarence had told everyone, then why would they even bother with thiselaborate procedure. And secondly, June wanted to know how the commanding officerknew about this so quickly because she said it wasn't that long after she had theconversation with this Master Sergeant.IT SUGGESTS THAT THE COFFEE ROOM WHERE THEY WERE TALKING WASPROBABLY BUGGED AND IT ALSO IMPLIES THAT EVEN WITHIN WRIGHTFIELD AND PEOPLE WITH Q CLEARANCES, THEY WOULD THREATENANYBODY - SINCE THEY ALL HAD CLEARANCES TOGETHER - THEY WOULDTHREATEN ANYBODY WHO EVEN TALKED TO EACH OTHER ABOUTNON-HUMANS.Exactly. So, in other words, they (authorities) did not view this as simple office gossip.THE VERY FACT THEY WOULD TRY TO STRONG ARM THEIR OWN INSIDERSTHAT HAD SIMILAR Q CLEARANCES, INCLUDING THE MASTER SERGEANTAND JUNE AND THE OTHERS, AND DO IT IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY WERESAYING THERE WAS NO TRUTH TO THIS WHEN THEY ALL KNEW THAT IT WASTRUE, SHOWS THAT THERE WAS KIND OF A 1984 NEWSPEAK GOING ONWITHIN WRIGHT FIELD AMONG THE VERY PEOPLE WHO HAD TO HAVEACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION TO DO THEIR WORK.Absolutely. It reflects a consistent policy of denial, of suppressing discussion or inquiry,and that is also furthered by the other major revelations.”Continued in Part 2.More Information:For further information about UFO crashes, Roswell, Wright Field and Wright-PattersonAFB, please see Earthfiles Archive (partial list below):• 09/07/2008 — Part 3: Army/CIA Unit Studied the Real UFO Blue Book Cases• 07/28/2006 — 1940s USAF Flight Surgeon's Account of E.
