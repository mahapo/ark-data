Y.Japanese katakana symbols similar to what Frank in Brooklyn,New York, in 1947, saw written by tall, auburn-haired femaleaboard silver saucer craft. Graphic source Wikipedia. March 17, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - In one of my 1988 correspondence filesabout high strangeness, I have a report from a man named Frank that is nine, typed pagesabout his eyewitness sighting of thirty-nine saucer-shaped craft divided into three groupsover Brooklyn, New York, in 1947, when he was 14-years-old. In a separate note, heexplained he wrote up his experience for a book he hoped to write some day, but “youmay use this data in the hope that perhaps others who might have had a similar experiencewill know that they are not alone, and perhaps with your reporter's experience, mightsomehow formulate what I and others experienced.” The purpose of Earthfiles RealX-Files is to share the strangest phenomena described by civilians, military andintelligence, even if events cannot be proved.Frank's Story, 1947“The location was in an area of Brooklyn, New York, located on LafayetteAvenue and Cumberland Street overshadowed by the Dimes Savings BankBuilding, which had at its apex a huge clock face, actually four clocks in allfacing to the four cardinal points of the compass. It was an ideal conveniencefor Brooklynites miles around. The time was noon as indicated by the BankClock's face on a Saturday when my pal, Dinky, and I arrived. We were both14-years-old. None of the other usual crowd showed up maybe due to otherpursuits or chores at home.We went into Joe's Candy store located on Cumberland Street and LafayetteAvenue, ordered our usual cherry cokes and tuna fish sandwiches on toast andwere browsing through the magazine racks much to Joe's consternation. Joe'sedict was, ‘Buy the magazines first, then read!’ Joe was well-liked by all, as hewas our ‘Mr. Rogers.’ He was always available for friendly advice. He trustedDinky and me in that he often left us alone in his store while he ran a quickerrand. Such was the occasion this Saturday afternoon when the newspapertruck arrived outside with its blaring horn and screeching tires. It was thereliable delivery of the New York Times. At the sound of the horn, Joe askedus to stack the newspapers in the store up against the magazine racks.Joe left for a few minutes to run an outside errand and when he returned, heseemed perplexed about something. I asked him, ‘What's the matter?’Joe said, ‘If you guys want to see something very unusual, just go outside andlook up at the Williamsburg Bank.’ Dinky and I thought that perhaps theclocks had gone haywire. So we went outside and looked up. What we bothsaw took us completely by surprise.Above the Bank Clock and somewhat more to our side, we saw 13 objectsabout 100 feet above the height of the Bank Clock. It looked like a militaryformation of three groups of shiny silver flying saucers. The three groups of13 silver saucers each, totaling 39, were arranged in respective diamondformations. It appeared as if all the saucers were providing protection for asaucer that was located within the center of their groups. All the saucers were"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"hovering as if they were on a sight seeing tour with a focus on the BankClock.There was a slight oscillation to their hovering maneuver and sometimes oneof the craft would start to oscillate rather wildly, but would soon recover intoa stable hover.Both Dinky and I were totally amazed by the display. I said, ‘Boy, I neverthought that there was such a thing in existence! I wonder where they comefrom?’Dinky answered, ‘Oh, it's probably some kind of new secret weapon that theArmy has finally built.’ It was only two years after the end of World War II in1945.I told Dinky I did not think it was new Army weapons. ‘I think they are realspace ships because of the way they can maneuver.’ By that time, the time onthe clock showed 1300 hours (1 PM).The saucers were quite large with a bright silver color. They were perhaps atleast forty feet across and had a height of at least fifteen to twenty feet. Aboutone-quarter of the upper body protruded above the rest of the ship, which wasencircled with large, clear portholes.The saucer at the center of the three formations - maybe the Command Ship -detached itself and took up a position on the Staten Island side of the Clock(east) and then moved again to the Brooklyn Navy Yard side of the Clock andhovered there for several minutes.Then Dinky yelled, ‘I bet that they have probably come down to see if wehere on earth have finally destroyed ourselves with the war and they are justconducting a tour.’ At that point, I burst out laughing and said, ‘Man! Waituntil they fly over Europe and Japan. When they see that destruction, theywon't think that we are so civilized.’ Both Europe and Japan still had lots ofdestruction then in 1947.Then the Command saucer moved again and positioned itself on our side ofthe Clock, west, in a somewhat tilted position. The tilt favored our total viewof the saucer. There were large circular portholes around the circumference ofthe craft. The difference now was that we could see what looked like peopleinside as if they were seated beside each porthole. I yelled, ‘Dinky! Do yousee that?’ He replied, ‘You are darn right I do. They all look like people on avacation.’ We both started to wave at the people and they in turn waved backat us.Suddenly more people came into view as if leaning over the ones seated bythe portholes to look at us and waved. We paid more attention to the seatedpeople and Dinky and I became aware that what we were seeing was notnormal. Reptilian-Eyed Woman At PortholeAt one porthole, there appeared a very buxom young lady who was wearing ablack and white floral designed dress. The strange thing about her was that shehad reptilian eyes (vertical pupils), but was normal in every other way.Dinky yelled, ‘Man, she looks nice, but scares me!’ I agreed.At another porthole was a military man wearing a garrison-type hat andofficer's dress coat with Captain bars on his epaulettes. He was also wearing akhaki necktie and shirt. He had black hair, as did the young lady. The militarymale was also sporting a thin, black mustache.At yet another porthole, there was an elderly, balding gentleman in whatappeared to be a dark blue suit and red necktie. His face was a waxen deepred and bluish color. Dinky said, ‘That guy looks like a refugee from amortuary’ I agreed with that, too, and asked, ‘Dinky, just what in the heck arewe seeing?’Two other portholes exhibited a very mature woman in a black dress withwhat appeared to be a lot of jewelry. She also appeared waxen like the olderbalding gentleman. The mature woman's hair appeared to be dyed a light"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"bluish color, something we had not seen in that era. In between waves at us,she was busily primping her hair with both hands.The next porthole person really scared us. He was a gentleman in a gray suitand dark necktie with a slight blue shirt, but his head was skeletal. In otherwords, it was a skull. He turned his head more to his left and it appeared thatthe right half was covered in concrete cement, greenish in color.Dinky and I both verified to each other what we were viewing so we wouldknow we were not hallucinating. Dinky said, ‘I'm thinking we are viewingsome kind of funeral vehicle because those people look like they might havepassed away and are being transported. You know, like the Egyptians used tobelieve in taking a boat to the stars?’I said, ‘Maybe, or more like vehicles to Hades. The bodies are not transferred,just the souls spiritually.’Dink surprised me when he said maybe I was right because Dinky was a totalatheist. I told him that I wished our normal crowd was there as nobody wasgoing to believe us.Dinky said, ‘Well, at least Joe saw the ships.’ Porthole Passengers Change to“Young-Looking Blond Girls” in Military KhakiThen strangely, the passengers at the portholes were replaced by young-looking blond girls. Their blond hair was tied up in tight buns, some at thesides, and others on the rear of their heads. The blond girls were all attired inmilitary khaki shirts opened at the neck and were waving at us.Dinky yells out, ‘Hey, take me! I'm yours!!’Where did these people come from? How far did they travel? Are they reallyouter space inhabitants? I sure wanted to ride in one of those saucers. Whole Side of Saucer “Opened Up”We were not prepared for the next event. It looked like the whole side of asaucer opened up as if we were viewing a 3-dimensional picture or in-depthmovie screen is about the only way that we could describe it. Dinky and Icould both now see within the confines of the saucer. We observed operatorsor technicians of some sort all seated to the right at an oval console. All theoperators appeared to be busy making adjustments on the console, turningdials or controls, very intent at what they were doing. It seems that we wereinto the first steps of thought transference, although unaided by any audiblecommunications.The people in the 3-D scene were all attired in uniforms. They looked likeGovernment Issue khakis. The blond man seated closest to our view had on akhaki shirt with epaulettes and khaki trousers tucked into black boots. Heeven wore a khaki belt.There were four operators at the console. Three were young men in their earlytwenties with blond hair neatly cut and combed straight back. A girl seated atthe far end of the console was attired in the same type of khaki uniform,except that she had auburn-colored hair tightly knotted in a bun at the back ofher head. That was not the fashion of the 1940s - maybe more like the 1930sor earlier. The console operators all seemed to be conversing, leaning backand forth to check each other out for whatever type of adjustments werenecessary.I said to Dinky that they are not U. S. military as our GIs don't wear blackboots. The GI boots worn in the 1940s were brown in color.Dinky said, ‘No matter what it is or what it is trying to foretell, we areprobably one of the few people on earth at this time that has seen somethinglike this.’"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I had a funny feeling. I wanted to ask questions. It seemed like Dinky and Icould only converse with each other. With all those weird-looking civilians,what kind of military would be involved? Tall, Blond MaleThen on the left side of the interior of the ship, Dinky and I observed a verytall man standing against the left wall facing us. Along his right side, there waswhat appeared to be a large chalkboard mounted on the wall. The man was atleast seven feet tall or more. His hair was what looked like very short, curly,blond hair. It was trimmed very neatly high in the front and tapered off to theback of his head. He was attired like the other males with his pants neatlytucked into his black boots. The boots did not show any laces. In comparisonto the others, his belt was black, wide leather with a plain, rectangular brassbuckle. Given the size of that guy, Dinky and I both thought he must be theCommander of that ship and probably of the whole fleet of 39 saucers. Tall, Auburn-Haired FemaleThen we saw an equally tall woman who was standing in front of theblackboard in a position that did not obstruct our view of her malecounterpart. She was attired in the same type of khaki shirt, opened at thethroat. She sported an ankle-length, chestnut-colored full skirt. She hadauburn-colored hair, except that it was full, hanging down to her shoulders.She also had on a black leather belt exactly the same as the Commander's. Inher left hand, she held what looked like several white paper sheets.With her right hand, she was making some type of inscriptions upon theblackboard with simple chalk. The script was unrecognizable to me, other thanthe fact that she was writing backwards, starting at the right upper side andcontinuing down to the bottom of the board. She would then again start at thetop and work down moving right to left across the page, Oriental style. I askedDinky if he ever had seen script like that.Dinky said her writing reminded him of hieroglyphics at the Museum ofNatural History over in New York City we had both seen there. The script wasnot exactly the same as the Egyptians. It also did not look like Chinese orJapanese that we had seen in newsreels during the war and it did not look likeHebrew or Cyrillic.Now as I write these pages in the 1980s after studying and learning to speakJapanese, what we saw back in 1947 that the tall, red-haired lady was writingreminds me of a Kata Kana (katakana) style of symbology Each symbol is anexpression to form the vowel sound of the word. But after much research, Idon't think even that is exactly the same, just looked similar.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Katakana is a Japanese syllabary,one component of the Japanese writing system along withhiragana, kanji, and in some cases, the Latin alphabet, perhapsoriginating in 800 A. D. The word katakana means ‘fragmentarykana,’ as the katakana scripts are derived from components ofmore complex kanji. Katakana are characterized by short, straightstrokes and angular corners, and are the simplest of the Japanesescripts. ]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Chart of 45 Katakana symbols also foundin Hiragana. Source Wikipedia.The tall male appeared to be in his early thirties and while she wrote, helooked over at the console operators and appeared to say something to them.The operators immediately responded by making adjustments on theirconsoles. Dinky said, ‘The way those people responded when that guy spoketo them, he is certainly the Commander of that ship.’The tall woman then turned and walked in the direction of the operators at theconsoles. Her walk was athletic with long, determined strides. It was at thistime that I became aware of what type of foot gear she was wearing. Theywere black boots that fit like a glove with a sensible low and wide heel. Theupper part of the boot was well above her ankle. I had never seen the type ofskirt she was wearing. She was quite beautiful in her outfit.In fact, it did appear that all the uniformed personnel were quite handsome inappearance. The console operators appeared to be much more slender andshorter than the Commander or the woman, who was perhaps second incommand.The tall woman seemed to be engrossed in making notes upon the papers thatshe held. She would return back to the blackboard and inscribe additionalscript upon it. We also noted that at times, she would appear to make amistake with her chalk and would use the edge of her right hand to erase hermistake - quite a human method, we thought.At one point, the Commander went over to the console operators, leaned overthem as if to be correcting or making adjustments himself. He was so tall, hada big chest and shoulders with a slim waist and moved like an athlete. Original Passengers Line Up for LiquidThen on the left side of the ship, it appeared that the civilians that we hadseen before were now lined up single file. One of the male operators wasstanding facing them with his back up against a large hatch-type door. He hadin his hand what looked like a plain, old martini glass that contained a clearliquid. First in line was the balding, older gentleman. He was given the glass"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"and it looked like he was ordered to drink its contents and he promptlyobeyed.When he finished, the blond male turned and opened the hatch from whichemitted the most intense bright, white light that I have ever seen. The oldergent entered and the hatch was closed. Each civilian in turn went through thesame ceremony, even the gent with the skeletal skull. I don't know how heaccomplished the drink, but he poured it in his skull. “Captain” Passenger Does Not Want LiquidIt went fast until it became the Captain's turn (military man with Captain barson his epaulettes). We could see his full length now. He was wearing what themilitary of that era called ‘Pinks,’ light-colored pants that were almost khaki.His jacket was of a color that looked like maybe a dark green, perhaps moreolive green.He was wearing what was known as a Sam Brown belt, thin and comingacross his right shoulder and chest, connected to a typical wide garrison belt.The whole ensemble was a brown color. He seemed to be arguing with the tallblond male and it appeared that the Captain was not going to drink the liquidin the glass. He would raise his left hand palm up, seemingly pushing theproffered glass away from him. The blond male departed and at this point, theCaptain turned around, looked at us, smiled and just shook his head back andforth as if commenting on the blond male.Then the Commander appeared and seemed to argue with the Captain,shaking his finger in the Captain's face. The Captain seemed to be clenchingand unclenching his fist. He appeared to stick his finger in the Commander'schest to emphasize something and it looked like the two were shouting at eachother. I was waiting, half expecting the Captain to punch the Commander, asthe Captain was also pretty large in stature. It appeared that the Captaindefinitely did not want to drink the liquid and leave.Eventually, the Commander got the Captain calmed down. The Commanderreached behind to a small cubicle located to the right side of the hatch, whichwe had not noticed before. The Commander produced a glass that containedthe clear liquid and offered it to the Captain. This time, the Captain accepted,putting the glass to his mouth and drank the contents. The hatch was thenopened up by the Commander and the Captain stepped into the intense, brightlight.It appeared to us that when a person walked into the chamber, they wouldtake several steps up to a small platform, stand there momentarily graspingeach side of the handrails. Then each person turned left, looking downward,and appeared to be somewhat hesitant before beginning to descend a stairwell,which was not visible to us other than the fact that the individual wasdescending.I said again to Dinky, ‘What the heck are we looking at? Some kind ofcommunion ceremony? A resurrection? Where did those people disappear to?Was that a symbol of a purgatory, a hell? Perhaps a resurrection? Or werethey simply being cremated?’ When the hatch was opened, we could almostexperience the intense heat that came with the brilliance of the light. Was thisthe entrance to Hades? Dinky said he didn't know, but he still wanted to ridein the saucer craft and look at their equipment. Dinky and Frank Try toTake Ride On SaucerThen our attention went back to the blackboard area of the ship in which boththe Commander and his female counterpart were standing facing us. Dinkypointed at his chest and back at the ship and said, ‘Take me!’The woman pointed at Dinky and then at the floor of the ship. Dinky yelled,‘Yes!’ Then she went to the blackboard, inscribed more characters upon it andsaid something to the Commander. He in turn hung his head down and made anegative reply by shaking his head."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Dinky now pointed to me and I made the same gesture from myself to theship. The woman seemed to shrug her shoulders, moved back to theblackboard, consulted her paper notes and wrote more on the board. She thenspoke to the Commander. He again shook his head in the negative. They bothseemed to converse for some length of time in which the Commander keptshaking his head in the negative. Then the woman smiled at us and wavedwhat seemed to be a good-bye. This was the only time that Dinky and Iactually had some sort of definite communications. Saucer Craft “Closes” Back UpSuddenly, the vision of the interior of the ship vanished. We now were lookingat the ship hovering in the sky. The Commander's ship moved to the centerrear of the other three ships in its formation. Then the whole fleet of 39saucers moved very slowly away from the Bank Clock and continued towardsthe north in the direction of Coney Island on the Atlantic Ocean anddisappeared from our view. 5 Hours of Missing Time?Dinky and I were left standing on the corner in front of Mr. Katz'sdelicatessen directly across the street from Joe Gilly's candy store. We bothnoted the clock on the Bank showed 6 PM. Dinky said that meant we musthave been out there looking at that craft for five hours. I couldn't believe it! Itold Dinky it was time for another cherry coke, so we went back across thestreet to Joe's place.When we came back into the store, Joe Gill was busy washing some dishes inthe sink. He told us he had called the Brooklyn News and the newspaperwanted to talk to us over the phone. But Joe said, ‘Where did you guys go?’I said, ‘Joe! We were standing right outside the whole time.’ Joe turnedaround, looked at us funny and said, ‘No, you weren't. I myself went lookingfor both of you. I even asked some customers if they had seen either of youanywhere.’Dinky and I looked at each other. I asked him if he thought we could havegone up in that craft. Dinky said it made his head hurt to think about it.Listening to us, Joe was agitated and told us to stick around for a few moreminutes because the reporter would be there any time.When the Brooklyn News reporter arrived, he talked to Joe who told thereporter what he had first seen outside. The reporter said his news bureau hadbeen getting calls from all over the borough about something in the sky. Wetold him exactly what Joe had told him. The reporter then asked us how oldwe were and what had we seen. We told him we were 14-years-old.The reporter looked at Joe and said he had to go and write something up onthe incident. As he was leaving, the reporter turned and said to us, ‘Are yousure that you guys don't want to elaborate a little more?’ We said, ‘No.’Then the reporter turned, hesitated, and said he had talked with an old Czechwoman across the street who lives over the delicatessen. The woman waspretty incoherent and shaken when she called the newspaper. But now sherefused to say anything. She might have to go see a doctor to get her nervescalmed down because she was so afraid. The reporter then left.Dinky said, ‘Oh, man! I'm going to catch hell because it's nearly 7 PM!’ Wehad both missed supper. Poor Dinky. He lived in the Fort Green Housingprojects, which were at least two miles away. We both started to leave whenJoe called me back. He said, ‘I know that both of you were not out there,Frank, and that something strange is going on.’I told Joe that Dinky and I had seen some pretty strange things, but that's all Iwanted to say about the situation. Joe knew I was a Catholic and he said,‘Frankie, please hurry and tell a priest what you have seen.’"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Frank Goes to Confession and Tells PriestI finally left and started to run towards my house, which was not far fromJoe's place. When I arrived home, I caught blazes for being late. I washed up,ate supper and wanted to tell my mother, but for some reason thought betterof it, since I figured she would not understand. She then said, ‘Well, you betterget ready since it's Saturday night and get up to the Chapel right now and goto Confession for tomorrow's Mass. The Chapel was only about 100 metersfrom Joe's place on Cumberland Street, so I took off as my mother asked.When I got into the Confessional, I started to relate to the priest what I hadseen. He told me we were going to the Rectory. This is a room in back of thealtar where preparations for a Mass is made. Right outside the Confessionalwas a small group of girls that I knew from school. They were laughing theirheads off, snorting, and gasping while nudging each other. Were they laughingabout me? The priest continued down the aisle and when we got to theRectory, I related the whole incident to him.He asked me if Dinky and I had gone anywhere with the ship's people. I said Ididn't think so, but I had the feeling that Dinky and I had been aboard thevehicle. This was an old wizened priest from Ireland. He told me that thepeople that we saw are not what they appear to be. The priest said what wesaw were disciples of the Devil that have plagued mankind and misdirectedhim down through the ages. That information really scared me.The priest also told me that such visitations go all the way back into ancienthistory. I said that the strange people seemed to be just like us. Then the priestsaid, ‘No! They have ways of deceiving us, having the ability to alter theirappearances and have revisited us before in the form of flaming chariots andhave led mankind astray.’ He asked, ‘Don't you realize that normal peoplecannot project visions like that? They are known as the great deceivers andare even known among Amerindian (Pacific Northwest) tribes to betricksters.’[ Editor's Note: The trickster is a mythological figure dominant increation and recreation stories. The historical globalomnipresence of this general character, who can shape shiftwithin the chosen animal or human embodiment, has given rise tomuch study and debate.]The priest asked me again if the ship's people took Dinky and me anywhere. Itold him that I didn't think so, but we must have been aboard the craft as Joesent people looking for us and we were not to be found. Yet, five hours laterwhile Dinky and I were viewing the confines of the ship, Joe asked if thestrange people had done anything to us. I replied not to my knowledge. Thepriest said something must have been taken.He then made me kneel down with him and we both recited prayers. Then thepriest stood over me with his hand on my head for what seemed like a longtime to chant prayers in Latin over me. With his other hand, he held anincense burner, which surrounded us in its scent. After about a half-hour, Iwas then given my penance, which I performed. Afterward, I left for home.After attending Mass the next morning, I drifted back down to Joe's place,joining our little crowd. It seems that Joe and Dinky had informed our bunchabout seeing the flying saucers. The whole crowd gathered round Dinky andme with questions. When Dinky and I started to relate the incident, we weremet with a chorus of laughter. I looked over at Dinky and he looked at mesaying, ‘I told you, Frankie. That's why I nudged you when the reporterstarted to ask questions.’Dinky, despite his youth, was pretty wise. I later realized that silence was thebetter avenue to avoid ridicule and finger pointing by doubters. Soon after thatweird day, Dinky moved away and I guess we both kept our secret toourselves all these years.I am now 68-years-old, have traveled extensively throughout the world andfought in two wars that puzzle me as to how I survived either one of them. Iretired from the U. S. Army in 1976, and then found myself employed withPRC in Virginia, then with Howard Hughes company as a computer technicianon flight simulator systems, and remained in industrial employment foranother twenty-one years. Then I went into full retirement in 1996."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"I have been an amateur radio operator since 1955, when I had obtained myFCC license.

But who is the prime intelligence incontrol of the theatrical events? What is the reason for theatrical drama and shape-shifting“tricksters”? The tall blond and tall red-haired beings have been described by eyewitnessesin Peru and Brazil as coming from silver discs. If truly extraterrestrial in origin, why isthere not any real effort to publicly and straightforwardly present themselves asnon-humans from some place else in the universe?Or perhaps one of the complex problems in public disclosure boils down to otherdimensions and time travel. If the tall blond and red-haired beings are not strictly from thisparticular universe, but some other dimension or time line, perhaps straightforwardinterfacing with Earth's surface life is not allowed for reasons having to do with changing,or not changing, particular time lines and pasts, presents and futures.More Information:For further reports about unidentified flying objects and entities as well as mysteriousaerial lights, please see my books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of OtherRealities and my documentaries A Strange Harvest and Strange Harvests 1993 nowavailable in DVD format in the Earthfiles Shop.Also, see Earthfiles Archive for dozens of UFO and extraterrestrial biological entity caasestudies from 1999 to 2009.
