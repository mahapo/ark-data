Halt Saw Beam from UFO ShiningOn Weapons Storage AreaEarly morning hours of December 28, 1980"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Lt. Col. Charles I. Halt described mysterious aerial light that emitted white, narrow, beamdown in front of him and over the weapons storage facility (above), said to contain nuclearwarheads, at RAF Bentwaters, England, in the early morning hours of December 28, 1980.Illustration by Jan Roth at www.re ndle sham-incide nt.co.uk used with permission.Gary Heseltine confirms that in the early morning hours of December 28, 1980, Col. Haltsays he saw a white beam of light come from a bright, unidentified aerial object and aimdownward to the RAF Bentwaters weapons storage area.Gary Heseltine, Detective Constable, CID (Criminal Investigation Dept), BritishTransport Police, Wakefield, West Yorkshire County, England: “And certainly afterone point, and Halt corroborates this, he (Halt) said that over three radio channels that hewas monitoring while he was out with his troops and as they were en route back, Col. Haltcould see that a UFO was shining a beam down into the weapons storage area. And thescript will deal with that aspect as well.IS THAT CONFIRMED BY THE RADAR TOWER WATCHER?Well, I don’t have his details so I can communicate with him. This is on the basis of whatHalt is telling me of the communications that person has had with Halt. But what Col. Haltis significantly saying once and for all is that he was monitoring three radio channels andheard the person in the tower confirming over the radio that beams were being shone downas he (Halt) watched into the weapons storage area. And that’s a very significant thing forCol. Halt to say.We had a situation where we had a strategic base where many numbers of U. S. Air Forcepolicemen were involved regarding a weapons storage area.THAT WAS NUCLEAR.Which I believe was nuclear. And the reason why I believe it was nuclear – Col. Halt willnever give you that definitive answer on that purely because of his Air Force allegiances.But my having worked on two U. K. air bases, if it were conventional weapons,non-nuclear, on an air force base there would be very few, if any, air force policemenguarding that facility.But on the weapon storage area at Bentwaters and Woodbridge, there were 14 U. S. AirForce policemen guarding that facility and there was a whole host of mobile patrols readyto respond to any kind of threat. In total, there were 38 officers and airmen involved at theBentwaters site. I leave it for you to draw your own judgments.RIGHT, AND IT MEANS THAT WEAPONS STORAGE AREA NEEDED HIGHSECURITY AND THAT IS WHAT HAS ALWAYS GONE WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONSSTORAGE."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Correct. And that’s where my interest initially came from because I had been involved.They did at Bentwaters and Woodbridge exactly what I did in the Royal Air Force. Andone of the key people is this person in the tower on the weapons storage area atBentwaters and Woodbridge.The simple reason is that in 1980, that high tower would have been way above all of thesurrounding trees. The tower would have had a total 360-degree view, unobstructed. Thetrees would not be allowed to be at the level anywhere near that tower. And I’ve been upin those towers. And in fact, when we made the History Channel program, one of thethings that I said was, ‘I want to go with Col. Halt up to that tower and see if he will talkabout other witnesses.’December 2007, photograph from RAF Bentwaters/Woodbridge tower used to monitorunderground Weapons Storage Area (WSA), that presumably included nuclear weapons heavilyguarded in December 1980 by military security. Image © 2007 by Gary Heseltine.When we did go up there in the tower, Halt did talk about another witness that had been incontact with him, but the witness wanted to remain anonymous because he had seen howmuch interest there has been in the witnesses - Penniston, Burroughs, Cabansag, and soon.GARY, ASSUMING THAT TALL TOWER WAS THERE BECAUSE NUCLEARWEAPONS WERE STORED UNDERGROUND AND THEY HAD 360-DEGREESCLEAR VISION OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS HAPPENING AT RENDLESHAMFOREST, WHAT DO YOU HAVE ON THE RECORD THAT WAS SAID FROM THATTOWER OPERATOR DURING THOSE THREE NIGHTS (DECEMBER 26 TO 28,1980)?There are scenes within the script that show that the person in the tower would have seenanything that was going on in the distance, would have been consulted with by seniorofficers who would have said, ‘Take a look outside,’ because he was in a high vantagepoint.WHY DO YOU THINK IT TOOK NEARLY 30 YEARS FOR COL. HALT TO SAY TOYOU, ‘I BELIEVE THE OBJECTS I SAW AT CLOSE QUARTER WEREEXTRATERRESTRIAL IN ORIGIN.’?In a sense, that’s down to me because I said to Col. Halt, ‘If we’re going to do this, thenthere is no point in you telling me things if we are not going to have ultimately a definitivestatement from you. After 29 years, I would like a definitive statement from you aboutyour recollections of what you saw and I think we need your statement to announce thisfilm project to the press and obviously to create a stir, which hopefully it is doing.And Col. Halt has reflected upon that and he has come out with those words (in June 25,2009, press release). He is fully supportive of everything that I’ve done at every stage ofcollaboration process. I have asked him questions. He has come back. I have asked himfurther questions and he has come back. And then when it got to the stage of nearingcompletion at Christmas 2008, I said, ‘Look, this took a lot longer than I thought, but hereis the first draft. I want you to change anything you are not happy with and let me knowwhat you think.’After Christmas, Col. Halt came back and said, ‘Excellent! There are one or two little"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"things here and there, minor little tweaks.’ Then we’ve gone from there.And he is aware that people will ask, “Why now do you make this kind of definitivestatement?’ And the answer is that I have pushed him by saying, ‘Well, if that’s what youreally believe then that’s what you have to put out because I don’t think you can bewishy-washy on this. You have to go with your genuine beliefs and pin them out there.And he has come back and is happy to do so and we have the quote. January 13, 1981Col. Charles I. Halt MemorandumParagraph 1. begins with wrong date - should be 26 Dec 80.IF THERE ARE MANY EYEWITNESSES TO EVENTS IN THE RENDLESHAMFOREST NEAR BENTWATERS DECEMBER 26 – 28, 1980, AND IF SOME OF THOSEEYEWITNESSES WORKING IN THE MILITARY FEEL THAT COL. HALT’SPARTICULAR TIMELINE MIGHT NOT BE ABSOLUTELY CORRECT, WOULD YOUCONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF TALKING WITH THESE OTHER WITNESSES TOINCLUDE PERHAPS SOME OF THEIR PERCEPTIONS IN YOUR FILM?Well, as a police officer and researcher, I want this to be as accurate as possible. Now,there are some inconsistencies from numerous people. However, the consensus of eventsare that in the Halt Memorandum that Col. Halt wrote to the M. O. D. (Ministry ofDefence), Halt got the date wrong.The original and controversial Lt. Col. Charles I. Halt Memorandum written on January 13, 1981,to the Royal Air Force/CC about “Unexplained Lights” investigated beyond the East Gate of RAF Woodbridgethe first night of the phenomenon. Col. Halt now concedes that the first sentence date of“27 Dec 80” is incorrect and joins the consensus of others who were there that the firstlights were investigated by Airman 1st Class John Burroughs, Staff Sergeant Jim Pennistonand Airman 1st Class Edward Cabansag after midnight on December 26, 1980.No two ways about it - he got the date wrong of the first night. So he has clarified in the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"script and it’s now a general consensus that the first night’s events were the early hours ofChristmas night into Boxing Day (Dec. 25 to 26, 1980). The Penniston, Burroughs andCabansag going out into the woods.OH, I’M SO GLAD TO HEAR THIS THAT COL. HALT HAS NOW CONCEDED THATWAS AN ERROR AND NOW PUTS HIM ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THE OTHERS.I would not be doing my job if I didn’t say, ‘Hang on a minute! This doesn’t seem to ringright,’ when I was doing my research. ‘Is there any way you, Col. Halt, could have made amistake?’Especially when you tied it in with the police messages when the U. K. police turned upand things like that. It was clear that there was a mistake and that the first night wasChristmas night into the early hours of Boxing Day. Halt now accepts that. So, that’s thefirst night.Some people – and I know Burroughs will go with this – he believes something happenedthe night of December 26 to 27.RIGHT.But not many people say that, as far as I can see. So, the next main night is December 27thto 28th. And this is when, on December 27th, that Halt is at Woody’s Bar social functionwhen he is informed the lights are back. He then puts together a small team to go out intothe forest to go to the landing site to do measurements and trying to get light-alls out there.They do the measurements. They’ve got an image intensifier (StarScope). They find thebroken branches; they find the small, blast area. They find the triangular markings, thedepressions in the hard ground. Then the red linking light that now has been linked with Halt is seen and then begins tomove away from the landing area and they chase, or walk, through the woods followingthis winking object, winking like an eye that appears to be dripping molten metal, but nomolten metal can be found. They go off to the farmer’s field. Col. Halt Was Not Chasingthe Orford Lighthouse BeaconNow, this is an interesting thing and this is something that has never really been dealt withonce and for all. As a police officer, I have worked in many incident rooms. If we were toanalyze and re-run Rendlesham, if it had been run as a police incident, somebody wouldhave come up and said, ‘Well, they just saw a lighthouse,’ which is one of the classicskeptical arguments put forward.Well, here’s my counter to that. I stood at the edge of the farmer’s field with Halt andmembers of the U. S. History Channel program. And as we looked out to the farmer’sfield, there was the farmer’s house that is referred to by Col. Halt with the aerial objectcasting a glow into the window because it was so close to the farm.Now, Halt described the object as being a couple hundred meters away to the left of thefarmhouse from where we stood in broad daylight. Halt pointed out across the field – thereis the farmhouse pretty much directly ahead. And then to the left of it, he said was theaerial object low above the farmer’s field, glowing, shining a reflection into the windows ofthe farmhouse. It almost looked like it was on fire.So, there we have Halt stood next to me and the U. S. History Channel crew saying to theleft of the farmhouse was the glowing object, literally 15 feet above the farmer’s field. Aclear, unobstructed view. And then Halt said, ‘Oh, now look to the right way on thehorizon, that is where the Orford Ness lighthouse is – to the right of the farmhouse way offin the distance and in broad daylight, you could not see it. At night you would have seen it(lighthouse light). But the point is that the aerial object that Col. Halt saw 200 meters indarkness, a strange object in a clear, unobstructed view across the farmer’s field. Theobject is low to the ground and left of the farmhouse.Col. Halt can see beacon lights of the Orford Ness lighthouse way on the horizon to theright of the farmhouse. So, let’s get this one thing clear once and for all. The light was notthe lighthouse that Col. Halt saw!RIGHT, AND HE WAS A COLONEL WHO WAS IN CHARGE OF A LOT OF MEN INBENTWATERS AND WOODBRIDGE ...He was the Deputy Base Commander."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"...YES, AS DEPUTY BASE COMMANDER TO EVEN HYPOTHESIZE THAT COL.HALT WOULD HAVE CONFUSED A LIGHTHOUSE IN AN AREA WHERE HE HADBEEN WORKING FOR A LONG TIME WITH SOMETHING THAT HE AND OTHERMEN WERE CHASING THROUGH A FOREST, I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT WASRIDICULOUS.Well, it has always been ridiculous, but I do believe this is where the media as a wholehave played a very important part in downplaying this entire subject, including theRendlesham saga. For the simple reason that every documentary I’ve ever seen be made,whether it be U. S., Japanese, German or the U. K. – every one has played a lot of airtimeabout the lighthouse theory. And it contradicts what the men who were involved said andthat is ignoring the evidence, the testimony, of multiple witnesses.Look at the first night – Penniston, Burroughs and Cabansag. Cabansag gets put out as arelay when the radio starts to fade. Cabansag is left behind to act as a relay. And it’sPenniston and Burroughs that go forward. They see a landed object.Penniston goes around it. Is that a lighthouse? That’s ludicrous! But all the media -whether newspapers, TV, documentaries - have always given this lighthouse theory a lot ofairtime. And I believe that is a deliberate ploy by some aspects of the media to downplaythe significance of this sighting and many others.GARY, ISN’T IT POSSIBLE THAT THE LIGHTHOUSE WAS ACTUALLY PLANTEDAND PROMOTED BY PEOPLE AT BENTWATERS – BOTH AMERICAN ANDBRITISH – WHO WANTED TO DEFLECT MEDIA ATTENTION ON WHAT THEYKNEW WAS A HIGHLY IMPORTANT SERIES OF EVENTS OVER AT LEAST THREENIGHTS THAT ‘AFFECTED NATIONAL SECURITY.’That is the whole point and this is what Halt is saying. Now, Halt is also saying, ‘Why hasnobody ever interrogated me? Why did I feel as if I had been kept out of the loop?’And it was his belief that because of his seniority in rank that there was a deliberatedecision made by the security services to exclude Halt from that process because of hishigh rank. And therefore, he has remained pretty much left alone. Were the Rendlesham Forest Lights TelepathicTechnologies Working for Time Travelers?WHAT IS YOUR OWN PERCEPTION NOW ABOUT WHAT CAME UP IN THE JIMPENNISTON HYPNOSIS IN HIS OWN EFFORT TO RECOVER WHAT HADHAPPENED TO HIM UNDER SODIUM PENTOTHAL – THAT WAS IN HIS 1994 HYPNOSIS SESSION TRYING TO RECOVER WHAT THE MILITARY HYPNOSISHAD BEEN IN 1980.IN THAT 1994 HYPNOSIS TRANSCRIPT THAT I DEAL WITH IN GLIMPSES, VOL. II:HIGH STRANGENESS, PENNISTON REFERS TO THE BEINGS IN THE CRAFT - THEINTELLIGENCE, HAVING TO DO WITH THE LIGHTS AND CRAFT IN THERENDLESHAM FOREST - AS BEING TIME TRAVELERS COMING FAR BACK INTIME, PERHAPS AS FAR BACK AS 40,000 TO 50,000 YEARS, IN AN EFFORT TOUSE GENETIC MATERIAL FROM THE EARTH FOR ‘BAND-AIDS’ IN A HUGEPROBLEM THAT THE FUTURE TIME TRAVELERS ARE TRYING TO SOLVE.When you say to the general public and try to talk about time travel, that’s probably on parwith talking about human abductions with most people who are not following the UFOsubject. Obviously, Penniston was regressed. These memories have come out. But in theend, we will never know how accurate those are.I think from my point of view as a police detective trying to delve into this subject, I havetried to stay away from those kinds of aspects where we will simply never know. But whatoccurred is that Jim Penniston was given sodium pentothal and was interrogated. He sawan aerial object. He recorded it in his pocket notebook. He walked around it. He touchedit. He submitted the photographs. They came out – some people would say mysteriouslyfogged. 3 Hours of Missing Timefor Burroughs and Penniston?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"One of the things that is very interesting about that first night with Penniston andBurroughs is that once they go off and leave Cabansag behind to act as a radio relay, thatwhen they eventually come back, having seen the object on the ground, it rises anddisappears. The two men then go and try to search for the craft. Eventually, they see abeacon light in the distance – what turns out to be the Orford Ness lighthouse. They hadwalked toward the lighthouse after the object had gone. They tried to find the object again.They think they see the same light again and they walk towards it for perhaps a couple ofmiles. Burroughs and Penniston then determine, ‘No, we’ve got close enough. We knowwhat that light is. That’s the beacon light from the Orford Ness lighthouse.’ And they thenturn around and go back towards the base.Now, significantly, when they get back in to base – and I’ve covered this in the script –some people said, ‘You’ve been gone for three hours!’THAT’S RIGHT. MISSING TIME.The timeline allows for the possibility that to Burroughs and Penniston, it was an hour ortwo hours. But maybe, it was three hours! They could not explain it. And this is maybewhere the aspect of regression and missing time and the abduction element might be true.But what I try to do is stick to the factual elements of the story.Obviously, Col. Halt is a major player to evolve in a very close encounter with UFOs. Andwhether he likes it or not, one of the first things I said to him, I said, ‘You might have had avery distinguished career in the U. S. Air Force, but unfortunately whether you like it ornot, you are going to be remembered as the man who wrote the Halt Memorandum.’ Interrogation of Bentwaters WitnessesAnd the reality of it is this was a major event and there are clear admissions by many ofthe players involved that they were interrogated. And the reason why they wereinterrogated seems obvious to someone who has served in the Air Force – there are manyoccasions when politics and the military get involved in downplaying anything – whether itbe 9/11 or anything like that. If people want to put out a false version, it can be done.These (counter-intelligence) methods have been used widely by the security services. So,to me, it would seem logical that somebody in the security services made the decision:‘How can we downplay the significance of these first two events with Penniston andBurroughs first night and then the Halt team going out two nights later.Literally this could be the case that is a house of cards and everything falls down andwe’ve got to admit, ‘Hey, we’ve been lying to you for many, many years.’ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTERACTION.Extraterrestrial visitation.WE’RE TALKING ABOUT A PHENOMENON THAT OUR GOVERNMENT AND THEBRITISH GOVERNMENT HAVE A POLICY OF DENIAL IN THE INTEREST OFNATIONAL SECURITY AND HAVE HAD SINCE WORLD WAR II.Yeah, I totally agree.THAT MEANS WHEN AN EVENT LIKE BENTWATERS OCCURS, THERE AREPROCEDURES IN PLAY TO MISINFORM THE PUBLIC AND THE MEDIA TO KEEPTHEM AT BAY AND TO REINFORCE THE RIDICULOUS EXPLANATIONSBECAUSE OUR GOVERNMENT HAS LEARNED FOR A LONG TIME THAT IF YOUUSE EVEN THE WORD ‘HOAX’ OR YOU COME UP WITH ANY STUPIDEXPLANATION, THE PUBLIC AND MEDIA IN THE VAST MAJORITY WILLACCEPT IT WITHOUT ANY ANY INVESTIGATION, INCLUDING THE NEW YORKTIMES.NOW, THIS LEADS ME TO: IF YOU WERE JOHN BURROUGHS AND YOU HADTHE KIND OF REPEATING DREAMS THAT HE HAS, IF YOU WERE HAUNTED BYWHAT HE IS CONVINCED IS SUPPRESSED INFORMATION INSIDE OF HIS VERYMIND AND HE WANTS IT OUT. AND IN THE HYPNOSIS THAT WE HAVE DONESO FAR, HE IS TALKING ABOUT HIMSELF AND PENNISTON ARE DEALINGWITH BLUE LIGHTS THAT THEY REFER TO AS ‘TALKING’ TO THEM – IN OTHERWORDS, TELEPATHIC LIGHTS. AND AT ONE POINT, COL. HALT HIMSELF TALKSWITH BURROUGHS ABOUT THE LIGHTS THAT COMMUNICATED WITH THEM.THAT MEANS THAT THOSE POSSIBLE 3 HOURS OF MISSING TIME AND THEHYPNOSIS SESSIONS THAT HAVE SAID THAT PEOPLE IN THE TOWER LOOKEDAT JOHN BURROUGHS AND SAID, ‘WE GOT A REPORT THAT YOU EITHER"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"JUMPED UP ON THIS CRAFT OR YOU ROSE UP IN A BEAM OF LIGHT.’IS IT POSSIBLE THAT JOHN BURROUGHS WAS TAKEN AND THAT TODAYFINALLY IN 2009, WE MIGHT BE CLOSE TO A BREAKTHROUGH IN HYPNOSISIN HIS MIND AND THAT HE MIGHT, OR MIGHT NOT, HOLD THE KEY TO WHATEXACTLY WAS THE SOURCE AND AGENDA OF THESE INTERRACTORS IN THERENDLESHAM FOREST IN 1980 THAT COL. HALT, NOW 30 YEARS LATER, SAYSWERE ‘EXTRATERRESTRIAL IN ORIGIN’?Who knows. The reality is that there appears to be a genuine question that they could havebeen gone for three hours, which does not sit with either of them very well because neitherof them felt they had been away for that length of time. Both have gone under hypnosis.Both have come out with accounts of interactions with beings or whatever. If that can becorroborated, great. But whoever gets hypnotized, whoever comes out with an account, inthe end, it’s an account. Yes, they might corroborate each other from the hypnosis. But inthe end, it is a strange account, which I’m not saying is not true. But what I’m saying isthat what I’m trying to do with this story is to tell it from the most factual consensus pointof view, so that if and when this film is ever made, it will reach a much wider audiencethan just the people who are interested in the subject. Why 30 Years of Government Cover-Up?DO YOU SPECULATE IN YOUR FILM SCRIPT ABOUT WHY THERE WOULD HAVEBEEN SUCH AN ENORMOUS COVER-UP FOR THE LAST 30 YEARS BY BOTHBRITISH AND AMERICAN GOVERNMENTS?There was a cover-up of some kind. Now, I thought that before I met Halt and obviouslyhaving collaborated with him for 19 months, he has given me a much deeper insight intohis beliefs. And he has said many times that he believed that the security services wereinvolved in trying to put out disinformation. And I think what Halt is saying by the worddisinformation is that there are many aspects of Cradles that a lot of people cannot agreeon. His take on that is that certain airmen – not just one, but several airmen – wereinterrogated and fed false information to say things that might not necessarily havehappened, but the airmen believed they had happened.And it was done to downplay the significance of the first night, which was principallyPenniston and Burroughs and then two nights later, when Col. Halt and four others led aforward party following an aerial object through the Rendlesham Forest, after havingexamined the landing site from two nights earlier.Yes, I personally do believe that it’s something the British and Americans are capable ofbecause history tells us that in literally every other sphere of politics that if somethingneeds to be hidden, then it can be hidden.If something needs to have disinformation, then disinformation can be put out there. Theyare well-worn counterintelligence techniques, not just necessarily that apply only to theUFO community.So, I genuinely believe there was a conspiracy. There are many wild aspects to the caseand I don’t think we are probably – even with the film script we have now – I still don’tthink we really know any more than 75% of what has occurred.But what is clear is that from many of the people (who were at Bentwaters), they wereinterrogated. So, that is a fact. That seems to be a consensus fact that there was some kindof interrogation process by the U. S. security services.”"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Date, addressee and signature of sender blacked out on alleged U. K. Ministryof Defence memorandum that describes non-human entities in “the landing of a craftof unknown origin crewed by several entities near RAF Bentwaters on the night of December 29to 30, 1980.” If that date is correct, then is it a fourth night of phenomena - or another incorrect date? A decade ago, a 1997 book about Bentwaters entitled Left At East Gate, was written byLarry Warren and Peter Robbins. [ An updated 2005 edition of the book was published byCosimo Press, N. Y.] Larry was working RAF Bentwaters and Woodbridge security backin December 1980 and had his own experiences in the Rendlesham Forest with lights andcraft described in the book.On Page 413, Peter Robbins recounts a discussion with Col. Charles Halt back in 1994 inwhich the Colonel revealed that light beams had penetrated the hardened bunkers in theBentwaters’ weapons storage area. That means the military had evidence that the UFObeam went through layers of soil, concrete and metal into the missiles. The assumption isthat the nuclear missile guidance systems were tampered with exactly as undergroundMinutemen nuclear missiles were affected by UFOs at Malmstrom AFB, Montana, andMinot AFB, North Dakota, in 1967 and 1968.Adding another layer of complexity to the Bentwaters mystery is a hypnosis session thatformer Bentwaters USAF Staff Sgt. Jim Penniston did in 1994, trying to recover morememories. He remembered touching the dark, glassy surface of a triangular craft andgetting a telepathic download into his mind that: “They are time travelers. They are us.... and they are using us like Band-Aids.” You can see much more of Jim Penniston’s fascinating 1994 hypnosis transcript, as well asan October 2008 hypnosis session done with John Burroughs, at Earthfiles Parts 3 and 4.John is trying to learn why some military eyewitnesses reported that he either jumped upon a craft or was taken up in a beam of light.John Burroughs is now trying to contact all the military personnel from RAF Bentwatersand Woodbridge who were involved in the mysterious light phenomena of December 1980.John would like to hear from all who were there and he has created a website to organize a2010 Bentwaters reunion: http://backtobentwaters.blogspot.com/ Continued in Part 3."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"More Information:For further information about the worldwide UFO phenomena, please see EarthfilesArchive (partial 2009 list below) and my books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volumeGlimpses of Other Realities in the Earthfiles Shop.• 07/19/2009 — Part 2: 1980 RAF Bentwaters Lights and Craft Were “Extraterrestrial InOrigin”• 07/17/2009 — Part 1: 1980 RAF Bentwaters Lights and Craft Were “Extraterrestrial InOrigin”• 07/16/2009 — Part 2: Silbury Hill “Quetzlcoatl Headdress” and Mysterious Tall Blonds• 07/14/2009 — Part 5: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 07/12/2009 — Mysterious Aerial Lights Mimicking Stars in Texas and Oregon• 07/06/2009 — Part 4: Non-Human Entities (NHEs):• 06/25/2009 — Part 3: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 06/21/2009 — Part 2: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 06/17/2009 — Part 1: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 06/09/2009 — Update Podcast: Aerial Lights That Mimic Stars, Helicopters and Airplanes• 06/05/2009 — Part 2: Mysterious, Silent, Large Aerial Triangles• 06/04/2009 — Part 1: Mysterious, Silent, Large Aerial Triangles• 06/01/2009 — Part 10: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 05/29/2009 — Part 3: 1954 SOM1-01 Training Manual and Challis, Idaho, Huge Triangle• 05/29/2009 — Part 4: 1954 SOM1-01 Training Manual and Challis, Idaho, Huge Triangle• 05/28/2009 — Part 1: Idaho Hunters Describe Huge Triangle Aircraft Over Their Campsite• 05/28/2009 — Part 2: Idaho Hunters Describe Huge Triangle Aircraft Over Their Campsite• 05/26/2009 — Part 9: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 05/13/2009 — Part 8: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 05/05/2009 — Part 7: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 04/29/2009 — Part 6: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 04/22/2009 — Part 5: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 04/21/2009 — Archive Reprint: Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell Says GovernmentsCovering Up E.
