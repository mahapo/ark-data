Return to Part 1May 10, 2009 Wiltshire, England - Continuing from Part 1.Interview:Charles Mallett, Silent Circle Information Center, Calne, Wiltshire, England: “I don’tknow who would have done this. All I can say really is about the physical traces we saw in theformation on the morning of May 4, 2009, and the plants seemed to have been systematicallytrampled throughout the entire formation, especially in the central avenues. The pattern is so bigit seems like it would have taken like ten people over at least an hour to cause that much viciousdamage. It looked like a formation after a week old that had been trampled by several busloadsof visitors, but in a systematic way.YOU’RE SUGGESTING IT WAS A RAINY NIGHT AND THAT THE MECHANICALDAMAGE CAME AFTER SOMETHING TRULY MYSTERIOUS PUT THE PATTERNDOWN?Yes, between 6 and 7 AM. I believe that Clatford formation was a genuine event and the damagenoted inside of it around 11 AM on the first day of May 4, 2009, was added about 5 to 6 hoursprior to my visit, which means the damage occurred around 6 to 7 AM, May 4."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Green tracks crossing middle of large Clatford circle Those markings were left by regularfarm tractor activity.

Clatford Pattern Overlaps A HillThe formation was discovered from the air by a Dutch lady that I know, Annemieke Witteveen,around 10 AM on May 4, 2009. She called me immediately and said she had just seen a hugepictogram over near Manton, but she really could not describe where it was because thelandscape looks really different from up there in the sky. She described roughly where it was andI went out and found it after some difficult looking because it's in a fairly obscure location wherecrop circles don't generally happen - on top of a hill!The huge formation is literally lapping over the top of a hill. It’s hard to see it from anywhere inthe surrounding landscape, so I had to go blindly into the oilseed rape field and walk up anddown the tramlines. Then I was shocked to find all of the plants were broken pretty viciously andthere were obvious trampled paths up and down the long avenues in the formation.Bearing in mind that this formation is 800 feet long and about 300 feet wide, you can onlyappreciate that by standing inside the pattern. The oilseed rape plants are 5 feet high, so fromstanding inside the formation, you can only see bits of the pattern disappearing down the field. Itwas a huge thing, it really was! Pattern Is Angled to Tramlinesand 800-Foot-Long Central Corridor CurvesThe whole 800-foot-long formation has a slight curve in it. That looks in some way to be relatedto the curvature of the hill on which the formation is laying on, as if it got dropped from the skyand just plopped down in a curve.If you were making that pattern with lasers and strings, your lines would be straight. There wouldnot be a slight curve going down 800 feet of that field of oilseed rape."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Eighth formation in Wiltshire, England, seen in field from airplane on rainymorning of May 4, 2009, after a night of rain at Clatford near Manton, Wiltshire,England.

Too Big and Too StrangelyLaid Out to Be Manmade?IT GOES UP AND DOWN OVER THE HILL SO EVEN THE ENTIRE PATTERN ON THEGROUND CAN’T BE SEE FROM ONE END TO THE OTHER.Right. Even with my 5-meter camera pole that I used to take the photos on the Silent Circle website to get an overview, even then you can’t see line of sight down the whole formation. It’sdisappearing down the hill. The lowest point relative to the highest point in the formation is manymeters lower. How could anyone make this huge thing in the dark while it was raining with thesubtle curve and skewed at an angle to the tramlines?So, when one is considering the possibilities of human hoaxing of that formation, one has toconcede that there is no line of sight down the entire axis of the formation. And the way thepattern is skewed across the tramlines in the field is very awkward. The physical construction, Iwould say, is practically impossible, given the fact that there was light rain all night to make itmiserable.Slightly curving central line that runs through entire pattern for 800 feet disappears"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"over hill in background. 5-meter-pole-shot with cell phone camera on morning ofMay 4, 2009, in Clatford near Manton, Wiltshire, England, after it had rainedall night. Images above and below © 2009 by Charles Mallett.Corridor plants broken off and yellow oilseed rape flowers smashedinto dirt unlike other 2009 Wiltshire crop formations since April 14, 2009.Image © 2009 by Charles Mallett.I spoke to two people who live in the immediate area around the field who both confirmed therewas light rain there and pretty windy and generally a pretty horrible, cold, stormy night. Thatmeans anyone who might be trying to hoax in that field would not be able to communicatebeyond 30 to 50 feet because of the wind, rain and closeness to local residents. Yet, we’relooking at something 800 feet long!CHARLES, DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR A TEAM DURING ARAINY NIGHT IN A 5-FOOT-TALL FIELD OF OILSEED RAPE TO MAKE THIS PATTERN?I don’t know if anything is impossible. I just think it’s highly improbable! In my twelve someyears of looking at this stuff, I don’t see how it could be done. If I were to physically createsomething like that in that field, I would almost certainly have to run it parallel with the tramlineso you would have your central axis laid out.If you just take a look at the overhead photograph of the formation, it is skewed across the field.You could not reasonably, especially in pitch dark and rain, wander around in that field withoutcausing ridiculous-looking damage from the air. Half your team would be 800 feet away and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"would have to walk hundreds of meters down the tramline and half way up the field and wouldhave to communicate with the people at the other end on the other side of the hill! I can’t figurefor the life of me how that could be done, especially not having a line of sight down the centralaxis! That is as impossible as I can imagine it to be! Candy Bar Wrapper and Pen LightLeft On Top of Downed PlantsSubsequent to observing all the damage on the ground in the formation, one person with us founda small pen torch (flashlight), a key ring torch, placed in the center of one of the circles.It was clearly placed and not just dropped because when you drop something in laid down plants,a small, narrow thing like a small pen light would just fall through the plants. I’ve lost lots ofthings in crop circles and they are always very hard to find. But this small torch was placedacross the stems and right nearby was a sweet wrapper (candy bar), which my partner found dry(no rain on it). The small torch was dry as well. That suggests both dry items were placed atopthose plants some time after the early morning rain. Someone wanted to create the impressionthat Clatford was a hoax, but I can’t say myself that it’s hoaxed. Professional Tracker Says DamageOccurred 5 to 6 Hours Before Charles Mallett ArrivedAlso, I had a professional tracker with me, someone who is well-qualified and certified intracking animals and how they break plants. He looked at the physical damage on the oilseedrape plants and the recovery of the plants and told me the damage over that formation hadoccurred 5 to 6 hours earlier than our visit at 11 AM, which made damage occurring between 6and 7 AM.So, one has to conclude that a team of people went into that field after sunup and systematicallytrashed the formation to make it look like a hoax. But really, the damage is not consistent withstandard hoaxing, in my opinion.HAS ANYBODY REPORTED IN THE LAST WEEK SEEING PEOPLE WHO MIGHT FITINTO THE CATEGORY OF BRITISH OR AMERICAN MILITARY INTELLIGENCE?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Not recently around Clatford, that I'm aware. But I’ve spoken with a couple of people who livein the immediate vicinity of the field and asked them if there was any strange helicopter activityaround that night of May 3 to early morning of May 4, 2009. No one has seen or heard anything,but most people are asleep before sunrise. Are Defense Satellites MonitoringFields for Crop Formations?I think one way or the other, the formation was seen by Someone before it was seen by myDutch friend who phoned me. Something overhead saw it first and I think that could be ageostationary satellite with the capability to pick up an electromagnetic field or heat burst orthermal imaging or who knows what?Something as big as that pictogram would give off a pretty huge signature, that a serious eventhad happened and could be one that would get a lot of media attention. So, if it is trashed, it willbe reported as a hoax and that will influence everyone else who gets into the site to spread theword that it's a damaged hoax, even if that's calculated misinformation.Because you can’t see the thing in the landscape, I’m pretty sure we were among the first peoplein there. It had not been publicized and my friend phoned me right after seeing it from the airaround 10 AM. Long History of Military HelicoptersOver Crop FormationsIT IS NOT THE SIGNATURE OF A TEAM SATAN OR ANY OF THE HOAXERS TO LEAVEA FORMATION COMPLETELY TRASHED RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING. IF THEYHAD BEEN HOAXING THIS, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SUBTLE, RIGHT?I would imagine so. It comes across as damage that was very intentional, systematic, more or lessall over the formation to create an impression of hoax. I’ve been to many formations very earlyin the morning where all of a sudden, these military-type helicopters that you and I and othershave seen over the years just suddenly show up. The helicopters fly right up to the new cropformation like on a mission and fly around them and look at them and then fly back the way theycame. Clearly the pilot is being vectored into a location from a monitoring source.I’ve also found pen torches obviously placed on plants in formations before. I practically sawsomebody once putting a pen torch in the middle of a circle in daylight. Back in 2002, I was witha Norwegian researcher and we went to a brand new formation very early in the morning and wefound a pen torch. As we arrived, we actually saw somebody exiting the field in a verysuspicious manner.We looked all around that formation and by the time we left, we decided it was a really genuineformation. Even more curious, by lunch time a visitor to the formation found another pen torchin the middle of the same formation that was added after we had been there! Other strange stuffSomeone has used to salt crop formations with false hoax-artifacts are voodoo dolls andcrucifixes, I guess to create a weird effect and doubt. Clatford Is Unprecedented Size in Historyof Spring Oilseed Rape Crop FormationsJust in sheer physical terms, Clatford is unprecedented size in history of spring oilseed rape cropformations. This is by far the largest formation in oilseed rape. For that to happen at the first ofMay is really unusual and in the context of the other oilseed rape formations this 2009 season,it’s all been pretty impressive, especially Morgan’s Hill at 300 feet wide and Avebury at 290 feetwide. These have been really amazing designs that have no physical explanation for theirpresence whatsoever. And Clatford is a major anomaly and huge.IN 5-FOOT-TALL RAPE!Yes, pretty high, up to my shoulders, and really dense. It was a real tangle to get through. At first,I went up the wrong tramline and had to wade through it to get to the right tramline. It was verydifficult to move in because the tops are all tangling together. The flowering oilseed rape flowersare coming to their peak and the plants are top heavy and starting to meld together and verydifficult to walk through. Even the tramlines have plants falling into themselves, so I was reallycovered in yellow pollen to a serious degree when I left the field."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" “Sinister Situation”?“The basic understanding I have from pretty reliable sourcesis that elements of the British government, or shadow governmentor special agencies in the M.O.D., are well aware that the crop circles are real,that the government is monitoring them and making sure that the storiesthat go out into the media are as silly as possible.”It’s kind of a sinister situation in a way. I’ve had experiences where I’ve been asleep in a cropcircle and been awakened at 6 AM by military helicopters that have been right on top of me only50 or 60 feet above me. They were probably just as surprised as I was to see them. But they areclearly paying attention to crop formations.My information is from conversations I’ve had with people who have worked for the militaryand Ministry of Defence (M.O.D.) in various capacities. The basic understanding I have frompretty reliable sources is that elements of the British government, or shadow government orspecial agencies in the M.O.D., are well aware that the crop circles are real, that the governmentis monitoring them and making sure that the stories that go out into the media are as silly aspossible.There are many elements about this Clatford pattern that do not make sense. I mean, whywouldn’t the ones who caused the damage – why not completely wreck the whole thing – send atractor to wreck the entire field, rather than go in the field and break all the plants so it still looksperfect from the air?It’s like Somebody wants the public and media to believe that the Clatford crop circle was madeby people, but I don't think so.” Glowing Orbs Photographedin Clatford Sigil-like PatternAnd angry farmer - how much damage did he do?Beyond Charles Mallett's investigation in the first morning that the Clatford pattern wasreported, a Cheltenham, England resident named Andrew Pyrka visited in the late day to twilighthours and was surprised to see faintly glowing orbs in a couple of his images. Here is Mr. Pyrka'sreport and orb images.Updated 05/11/09: Andrew Pyrka Field report about crop formation at Clatfordnear Manton, Wiltshire, May 4, 2009:“The biggest formation of the year by far. This giant of a formation is approx.quarter of a mile long. Standing at the edge of the field - Manton or Clatford side -you can not see it from either end of the field. Approx 50 meters into the field fromClatford side, the formation becomes visible.As always the perfection is clearly visible throughout the entire formation withswirls and twists everywhere you look. The characteristics what we are familiar withare present in every nook and cranny of the formation A clear construction line isalso visible with plants showing a parting left to right as if something came throughthe centre forcing the plant to collapse in opposite directions. When standing at anypoint within - you can only see the nearest design - the rest is not visible at all."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Pathway in Clatford formation shows 5-foot-tall oilseed rape plantsparted in the middle and laid down in opposite directions.Image © 2009 by Andrew Pyrka.There was also quite a bit of damage in certain places - but if you look at the photoof the larger circle you can clearly see that the farmer had driven through it. Thephotos also show the formation slightly twisted, this is due to undulating land.Dark green tractor tracks twisting through circle.Those markings were left by regular farm tractor activity.Image © 2009 by Andrew Pyrka.As we arrived late we had little time to take day light pictures, hence some of theimages are very dark, but I hope you can still clearly see the impression in the plant.As night time was creeping in fast, there was an eerie feeling of being watched. As Iraised the camera pole to take the last few shots, four ORBs appeared out ofnowhere and appeared to hover just above the plants.Andrew Pyrka emailed me on May 11, 2009: “There were 4 orbs - the main orb wasclearly visible and was the size of a large beachball (far right in image below). Theother 3 orbs were coming into view and becoming visible or as if coming in fromanother dimension, the size of a football. Quite a spooky experience.”"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Four faintly glowing orbs (inside Photoshop highlight circles) that appeared to hoverabove the oilseed rape after sundown on May 4, 2009, Clatford near Manton, Wiltshire, England.Arrow points at Andrew's colleague for size and distance comparison.Camera pole image © 2009 by Andrew Pyrka.Another ORB reappeared once again approx. 15 minutes later along the tramline.Quite extraordinary to think what these things might be doing. -Are they looking forour reaction? Listening, watching and cataloguing the event? We can only guess!!Fifteen minutes after the orb first appeared, a glowing orb showed up once more at a distancein the tramline beyond foreground circle (inside white oval) after sundown on May 4, 2009,Clatford near Manton, Wiltshire, England. Camera pole image © 2009 by Andrew Pyrka.Sadly the re-appearing ORBS were not the only thing watching us! As we made ourway back to my car - a very angry farmer who arrived with screeching tires, nearlyhitting the back of my car, stepped out of his truck with raised fists and full of abuseand started to thump my car with his fists. We stuck to all the guide lines of conductand offered our apology in a courteous manner and left.
