August 5, 2009 Yatesbury, Wiltshire, England - Mid-day on August 3, 2009,photographer and crop circle researcher Frank Laumen from Germany was driving on theroad near Silbury Hill when through a gap in the trees, Frank could see something in awheat field at the base that was definitely not there the night before when he and hisGerman colleague, Andreas Mueller, had driven by after visiting the Morgan's Hill patternreported August 2. Frank used his cell phone to call Andreas in another car behind him andthey stopped to get into the field.Eventually someone called Cropcircleconnector.com to report the new pattern that no oneknows if it arrived during daylight hours on August 3. Whether it is a miraculous, rapid,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"daytime creation or not, this is a remarkably detailed pattern on the ground. After theConnector posted aerial shots by Olivier Morel, literally busloads of people arrived,followed by a farmer so angry that eyewitnesses in the field said the man's “veins werepopping out the side of his neck.” The Australian scientist, who has been studying cropformations for their lunar, solar and astronomical information, offered the angry farmer 50English pounds with the request as a scientist for a little more time to study thecomplicated details. The farmer took the money, waited a few minutes and thenaggressively drove his mower through the entire formation erasing it by 5:30 PM.The following are some of the photographs that Frank Laumen of www.VisibleSigns.de gotbefore the destruction. Other photographs were provided to Earthfiles.com by Max D. thatillustrate some, but not all, of the fine details inside this new Silbury Hill pattern that wasdestroyed so quickly.
