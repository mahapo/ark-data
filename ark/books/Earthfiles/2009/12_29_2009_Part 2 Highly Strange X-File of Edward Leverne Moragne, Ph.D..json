Moragne, Ph.D., Physicist Return to Part 1December 29, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuation of Linda MoultonHowe's May 8, 1997, interview with Edward Leverne Moragne, Ph.D., at his Houston,Te x a s , h o m e : “DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT THE BOTTOM OF THE BIG DISC CRAFT LOOKEDLIKE THAT CAME DOWN IN THE NEVADA DESERT IN 1964?It was a big oval on the bottom and on the top.WHAT THE SURFACE LIKE?Bright silver-colored metal, looked sort of like bright stainless steel.THAT SOUNDS SOLID. HOW DID THE MILITARY AND SCIENTISTS LOOK INTOTHE TOP PART AND SEE THREE MORE HUMANOID BODIES AS YOUDESCRIBED?The Edwards AFB people said that there were little slits up there in a narrow rise onlyabout 8 or 10 inches high atop the disc. It was through the slits they could shine lights andsaw three humanoids sitting inside at what looked like an operating console.LIKE THE HUMANOIDS WERE IN SUSPENDED ANIMATION? OR WERE THEYMOVING?They were just sitting there, so they would have to have been in suspended animation likethe other ones that laid down in the desert, I guess. Everyone had a hard time with thatconcept because no one thought that could be done to a human being. We've got to feed allour tissues or they will die. What was feeding those beings inside the top of the disc andthose that laid down on the ground?DID YOU CLIMB UP TO LOOK THROUGH THE CRACK AT THE BEINGSYOURSELF?No. Davis was the guy who was up there and he came down and told me, ‘There are threeguys sitting there as still as those other three men who laid down on the ground. Identicalto them.’ Davis and another guy named David were both scientists and they knew moreabout the non-human phenomenon than anyone on Earth, I think. From my point of view,those three on the ground had the same shape, same form, same everything, but with somedifferences that you could tell them apart.DID THE HUMANOIDS BREATHE?No, they didn't breathe at all.HEART BEAT?No heart beat.YET, THOSE BEINGS COULD GET UP AND MOVE?I think they were robots, controlled by some distant planet or spacecraft or something,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"because those bodies in suspended animation could be brought back to life in an instantand probably put the big disc right back into service. I don't know why that didn't happen.WHY DO YOU THINK THEY ARRIVED AND WENT INTO SUSPENDEDANIMATION?None of the people I knew at Edwards AFB found out. I think they are still trying to findout. The last grilling I took with the space agency was that the space agency set up adepartment to investigate spacecraft and things like flying saucers.ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT NASA?Ye s .DID DAVIS AND DAVID WORK FOR NASA?I never did find out who exactly they worked for because I was introduced to a lot ofprofessors and doctors from universities all over the United States trying to study the discand the humanoids.WHEN YOU WERE CALLED IN FROM CHICAGO TO SEE THE BODIES ANDSPACECRAFT, WHAT DID THE AUTHORITIES WANT YOU TO DO?They put it to me this way: ‘Were those bodies burned?’ I said, ‘No.’‘Was there any nuclear radiation around the craft that would hurt military or scientists whowalked around it?’I got two scintillators that I had designed and built myself to test for radiation. And wecould not find any form of radiation there whatsoever.WHAT ELSE DID THE AUTHORITIES WANT YOU TO DO?They wanted me to look at the craft and see if I could determine what was causing it totravel at the immense speed it had traveled and how could it turn on a 90-degree angle atthose very high speeds.SO THE MILITARY HAD TRACKED THE CRAFT ON RADAR?Well, they had some radar images that showed craft doing such maneuvers, but not thespecific disc that came down in the Nevada desert that the humanoids came out of and laiddown on the ground.DID DAVID OR DAVIS TALK ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE BODIES ANDCRAFT WERE PUT THERE DELIBERATELY FOR HUMANS TO TEST ANDEXAMINE?No. Those scientists told me the humanoids were there to protect that spacecraft. Davidand Davis thought those beings could be deactivated at any moment and that we don'tknow what their potential damage might be as far as energy is concerned. What if thehumanoids could reduce a tank to dust if they were ordered to?SO EDWARDS AFB AND OTHERS WERE WORRIED ABOUT A TECHNOLOGICALAT TA C K ?Right. They didn't know what the devil - if these humanoids landed there, why hadn't theymade contact other than laying those three guys down on the ground?DID ANYBODY TELL YOU THAT THE U. S. HAS OTHER NON-HUMAN BODIESAND CRAFT THAT LOOK DIFFERENT THAN THE DISC AND ITS HUMANOIDSTHAT YOU SAW?Yeah, I heard that, but I haven't seen other craft and bodies. I do remember them talkingabout other alien beings that had Chinese-looking eyes, slanted, and had no ears, no holesfor a nose and not much of a mouth. I wondered if those robots laying there might noteven need the mouths they had! I don't know. Maybe cosmetic camouflage?LET'S GO BACK TO 1964 WHEN YOU WERE IN THE NEVADA DESERT FIRST.WHAT HAPPENED?Well, I was told the disc was going to be moved to Edwards AFB for further research. Butthen everyone realized it would not fit in the hangars there, which were not large enoughto fit around the big disc.HOW LARGE WAS THE CRAFT?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The disc was about twice the width of our biggest bombers at the time - at least as long asa football field (100 yards or some 300 feet). So, I was told the disc would be taken to AirForce 5 in southern Nevada and as soon as it was there, they would send for me and Icould really test it. I figured I would have a free hand. But when I went down there, I wastold, ‘No, don't touch that. Don't do this. Don't do that.’I said, ‘You told me to come down here and check the thing out. So, why don't you let medo that?’The military guy said, ‘There are certain things we've already checked and there's no useyour looking at them.’I said, ‘If you already knew, what the hell am I doing down here?’‘Well, the thing is that maybe you can discover something we haven't discovered.’‘How can I do that if I can't be free to explore and investigate? I would like to look in thatwindow that the scientists looked in and saw those three guys sitting in there. I'd like to seewhat the instrumentation looks like.’ But for some unknown reason, he wouldn't let me dothat. He said it was not necessary and I was not going to beg them to do anything. In fact, Ibecame anxious to get out of there.WHY?It was weird! I mean, what was I doing in there? What business was it of mine to find outwhat those humanoids were up to? It was up to the military and government to handle that- not up to a civilian scientist like me!DID DAVIS OR DAVID SAY ANYTHING ABOUT LOOKING THROUGH THAT SLITAND SEEING PANELS WITH HAND PRINTS EMBEDDED IN THE OPERATINGCONSOLE?They said they saw a lot of instruments that had knobs on them, but I don't rememberabout hand prints. They did say that if it were possible to open that craft up ever againand/or those humanoids in there came out or the three on the ground went back in - thenthe scientists figured those humanoids would take off and that would be the end of that.There was another odd hypothesis - those scientists figured that when those humanoidscame down into the Nevada desert, they brought down some transparent individuals withthem who are out seeing Earth to find out what's going on here. But we can't see theexplorers who control the humanoid robots tending the disc! Those men had morephenomenal theories than anyone in my life!YOU MEAN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT THEPOSSIBILITY OF TRANSPARENT BEINGS MOVING AROUND ON OUR PLANET?Yes. That was a conversation with an Army military intelligence doctor named Graham.He was a real regular fellow, very nice. He did not wear a uniform. He was one of the topmen in that military intelligence unit.DID GRAHAM TELL YOU ABOUT ANY OTHER BEINGS AND CRAFT HE HADSEE N?No, but he said he had gone to 40/11 sites.WHAT DOES 40/11 MEAN?It means sites where spacecraft had landed. I don't know how many. Graham said that outof all of them, he had seen where some had scraped the ground. And two or three othersyou could see where the craft hit the ground. So, the big disc in the Nevada desert was oneof the only ones he had seen that appeared to have actually landed.ANY DISCUSSION WITH HIM ABOUT CRASHED SAUCERS IN NEW MEXICO?No. I asked him about that particularly because I had heard from a guy in Pueblo,Colorado, who said that he and his wife had driven around up there and saw a spacecraftland. I was so intersted, I went to Pueblo to see the husband and he told me, ‘All of asudden, a big, bright light shown in our car and we could not see anything. Then these‘people’ came around and whisked us out of the car. I don't know how we got out of thecar! We went up some steps and went inside their craft. I couldn't get my bearings. Icouldn't tell if I was waling on my side, walking upside down or what.’Then he said, ‘They set me in a room and put my wife in another compartment. I could seeher sitting right there! And those ‘people’ put all kinds of electrodes on our heads, backs"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"and stomachs and we were there for about two minutes. Then they took the electrodes offand put us back in our car and we were driving on our way again.’YOU HEARD THIS AT EDWARDS AFB?Right. Those people in Pueblo reported what happened to someone in the government.Then the government turned around and told them they were lying. I don't know.LET'S GO BACK TO THE CRAFT IN THE NEVADA DESERT. HOW DID THEMILITARY MOVE A 300-FOOT-DIAMETER DISC?I wasn't there to watch, but I know they had to take it around a mountain.HOW DO YOU THINK IT WAS MOVED?The only thing I know is they put the disc on huge roller beds.HOW MUCH OF THE CRAFT DID YOU GET TO TOUCH WITH YOUR HANDS?I touched the bottom and everywhere I could touch, except that slit on top that I wanted tolook through and was told I couldn't.WHAT DID THE CRAFT'S SURFACE FEEL LIKE?Like smooth stainless steel, but it wasn't. Any time you take a carbon torch and hit a pieceof stainless steel, you've got a mass of molten metal there. But we hit that surface with notonly a carbon torch, we put carbon-hydrogen arcs on that thing for hours upon hours andthat disc surface never even got red hot!DID YOU EVER LEARN WHAT COULD BE SO RESISTANT?No, that's why the authorities wanted a piece of the craft cut off so they could analyze it.BUT HOW COULD ANYTHING BE CUT OFF FROM METAL THAT CARBON ARCSCAN'T CUT?Well, I don't know, but that's why we were trying to cut it. We knew we could not usesaws. I watched one saw just sit there running on the disc's surface like you were polishingwith the blades! And we used a diamond saw that never showed a scratch. The militarytried to use the latest things they could think of to get into that disc.” Continued in Part 3.Return to Part 1More Information:For further information about “Dr. Epigoni,” please see Earthfiles Archive:• 01/26/2005 — Final Part 28: UFO Crash/Retrievals: The Inner Sanctum - Status Report VI ©July 1991 by Leonard H.
