Scientists Analyze Milk Hill 1, 2 and 3An Australian scientist, who requests anonymity, and Mike Reed, retired physicist and telescopeengineer at Arizona State University, puzzled over this one for quite awhile. Then the Australianscientist wrote:“ As shown in the explanatory diagram below, Part I of Milk Hill on June 21, clearlylooked like a ‘sextant,’ which has long been used to measure the ‘altitude’ or heightabove the horizon of various astronomical objects in Earth’s sky.”"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"“It also showed a second underlying symbolism for Earth and Moon where planetEarth was drawn with a ‘teardrop’ shape, while our Moon was drawn with astandard ‘dumbbell’ shape first noted in the early 1990s. That teardrop shape is theusual scientific symbol for a CME, or coronal mass ejection from our Sun.The two long measuring arms of that ‘sextant’ are aligned in the field close to duenorth or due east, which match where our Moon will be located (under the horizon)at times of 1200 or 1700 UT on the upcoming date of July 7, 2009.At first it might seem bizarre that extraterrestrials could be showing us a sextant inEnglish fields, but on several occasions from 2003 to 2008, the crop formationintelligence has showed us an astrolabe, which is another astronomical measuringdevice from Earth’s past.”Three separate crop pictures from 2001, 2003 or 2008 all seem to show a generalized“astrolabe” motif. The astrolabe is an ancient Greek instrument for measuring sky locationsof the Sun, Moon, planets or stars. Sextant, astrolabe and orrery illustrations byAustralian scientist and Italian artist, Marina Sassi."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Another single “astrolabe” crop formation appeared at Gog Magog Hills,near Cambridge, England, on July 25, 2001.The Australian scientist explained that two weeks earlier before July 25, 2001, a complicatedmaze had also emerged at Gog Magog that provided a schedule of eclipses. So, he concluded itwas logical that “75 radial segments, along with three crescent-shaped symbols, meant‘eclipse.’”He prepared the graphic above and explained that “solar or lunar eclipses appear periodically onEarth once every six months or 25 weeks. Three such sets of eclipse seasons would thereforeappear in a total of 3 x 25 = 75 weeks or 1.5 years.” Milk Hill Part 2 Addition, June 22, 2009The second addition to Milk Hill on June 22, also seemed to show astronomical symbolism. TheAustralian scientist concluded that the second addition closely resembles an “orrery,” which is atraditional mechanical device used to illustrate planetary motions. Australian scientist: “This particular orrery seems to be based on the Earth-centered model favored by Claudius Ptolemy in ancient Alexandria (150 A.D.), andtaught throughout the Middle Ages, rather than the Sun-centered model introducedby Copernicus in 1540 A.D. We are all familiar today with Copernicus’s heliocentricmodel for our solar system, which places the Sun at its center and nine planets allaround. Yet most people today do not know about Ptolemy’s geocentric model forour solar system, and that is why we have shown it below:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"In the right graphic, “Planet Earth lies at its center, while five bright planets alongwith the Sun and Moon rotate around the outside. The relative order of those sevenbright astronomical objects in Ptolemy’s model, when going outward from thecenter, are 1 = Moon, 2 = Mercury, 3 = Venus, 4 = Sun, 5 = Mars, 6 = Jupiter and 7= Saturn. On the left, the Milk Hill crop formation with second addition showscurved orbital paths along the right for only five of those astronomical objects:namely 1 = Moon, 2 = Mercury, 3 = Venus, 4 = Sun and 6 = Jupiter. We will discussbelow why 5 = Mars and 7 = Saturn might have been omitted.“ Along the top, that Milk Hill crop picture then shows six of seven planetarysymbols 1-2-3-4-5-6 (when including the outermost curved line), so as to match sixrectangular ‘boxes’ that were drawn immediately below. Clearly those boxes havesome connection to Ptolemy’s astronomical objects 1-2-3-4-5-6, but what couldtheir relation be?” Altitudes Above Or Below Local Horizonfor Moon, Sun and 4 PlanetsAny box with one stripe means “negative altitude” (below the horizon), while any box with twostripes means “positive altitude” (above the horizon). Our best date of July 6, 2009, producesaltitudes above or below the local horizon as Moon = - 64 degrees (not visible);Mercury = + 62 degrees; Sun = + 61 degrees; Venus = + 42 degrees; Mars = + 39 degrees;or Saturn = + 22 degrees. Planet Jupiter at - 39 degrees is not visible, so is not shown.On nearby dates, say July 5 or 8, 2009, the negative altitude for our Moon does notexceed high positive elevations of + 62 or + 61degrees for Mercury or the Sun as required.“The answer to this apparently difficult problem is actually quite simple: What is thetrue purpose of a sextant, as shown at Milk Hill one day earlier? Well, a sextant tellshow high in the sky any bright astronomical object might be at a given time ofobservation, in units of 0 degrees to 90 degrees, relative to the local horizon. Inastronomical language, those heights in the sky are called ‘altitudes.’"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"“Could each of those six rectangular boxes be telling us relative altitudes forPtolemy’s six astronomical objects 1-2-3-4-5-6 at some calendar date in the nearfuture?“With that idea in mind, we used an astronomical almanac to calculate altitudes forthe Sun, Moon and five bright planets over a wide range of dates during the summerof 2009. Then we compared those calculated values with the relative heights of sixboxes shown in Part II of Milk Hill. The hourly time of observation clearly has to beclose to 1200 UT, since one arm of that crop formation sextant is aligned south tonorth, parallel to the crop tramlines, while our Sun lies due south at noon in southernEngland.“Our best theoretical matches to the crop formation boxes were for upcoming datesof July 6 or 7, 2009. Why would those crop artists go to all the trouble of showing ussextant and orrery shapes, then coding that orrery with six rectangular boxes whichmean July 6 or 7, 2009, unless something significant were going to happen at thattime?“At early stages in the ejection process, any Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) on thesun can acquire a teardrop shape, such as that drawn for planet Earth in the MilkHill sextant marked with a blue asterisk. At late stages in the ejection process, anyCME might evolve into a spherical shape, such as that drawn next to the cropformation intelligence's “Sun” symbol marked with a red asterisk.“If Milk Hill Part II is really telling us about a CME (and not a comet), then thatmay be why the crop artists omitted 5 = Mars and 7 = Saturn from their curvedorbital paths, while including 1-2-3-4-6. On July 6 or 7, both Mars and Saturn will lieangularly offset from the other four planets and our Moon, when viewed in terms ofa possible directional CME ejection by our Sun.“For the past two years, our Sun has been abnormally quiet between solar cycles 23and 24. Within the past month however, it has become more active. What ifanything might happen shortly?“Based on previous examples from 2004 or early 2009, we can be pretty sure thatthe crop formation intelligence's use of a teardrop symbol does represent a coronalmass ejection (CME) from our Sun. Why then would they have drawn planet Earthin the form of a large teardrop on June 21, unless several CMEs will impact uponEarth soon?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"“We can see on the left of that new crop picture a round circle for our Sun, whichseems to be emitting five CMEs along curved paths through space that eventuallyintersect with planet Earth at the red asterisk.“On the right, we can see a dumbbell-shaped symbol for our Moon. The dumbbellmoon symbol first appeared in crop formations in the early 1990s. Two long, thinarrows mark where along the horizon our Moon will be located on July 7, at 1200UT (due north) or 1700 UT (due east). An earlier crop formation at Milk Hill onJune 13, 2009, suggested that our Sun would flare late in the afternoon of July 7, at1700 UT, when it is low in the west at 308 degrees.”“Jellyfish” or distorted Earth's magnetic field swept by strong solar wind after coronalmass ejection (CME) from sun lines up with sunset on July 7, 2009, at 308 degrees atWaylands Smithy near Kingstone Coombs, Oxfordshire, England, reported on May 29, 2009.
