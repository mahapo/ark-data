April 30, 2009 Wiltshire, England - Between April 14 and April 29, 2009, there have been six cropformations reported in oilseed rape in Wiltshire County, England. Five are described as “the mostelaborate and geometrically sophisticated oilseed rape formations that have occurred in British cropcircle history.” Those words were said to me earlier this week by long-time crop formation researcher Charles Mallett,who runs the Silent Circle Information Center in Calne west of Avebury. A recent formation reported inthe Liddington Castle region is so hard to find that no one knows for sure when it formed and only twoground photographs have been shared so far. April 25, 2009, Liddington Castlenear Chiseldon, WiltshireDene Hine sent the Cropcircleconnector this note after an April 25, excursion trying to find a rumorednew formation: “After 3 hours of hunting in the field up and down the tramlines, I came across thecircle that I was told about. Got totally rained on in the flash storms. This is not visible anywhere nearthe road. It must be visible from the top of the hill only. It's a small formation that contained 4 circles, 2outlined and 2 solid, joined by lines. I would say the whole formation would be under 100 feet.”Update: An experienced crop formation investigator who flew low over this pattern some time laterthought it was “too messy” to be considered a genuinely mysterious imprint in plants such as the otherfive formations in April."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Above 4-circle pattern in flowering oilseed rape at Liddington Castlenear Chiseldon, Wiltshire, England, on April 25, 2009.

This morning by phone, Charles told me that this brand new formation isalso impossible to see from the ground because it is right on top of Roundway Hill and can only be seenfrom the air. In fact, it was spotted from an airplane early on the morning of April 29, and eyewitnessesassume it was made that night. The beautiful pattern is 230 feet in diameter and has 18 arcs swirlingfrom a center made of five rings around a small flattened circle, 15 feet in diameter.Sixth oi lseed rape formation at Roundw ay Hil l near Devi zes,Wiltshire, reported April 29, 2009.

Somevarieties grow five to six feet tall and others three feet high. Blooming oilseed rape is thick and tanglesaround legs. The yellow pollen puffs off in clouds, leaving green trails of disturbance where people havewalked. Yet, the first three 2009 crop formations reported in Wiltshire, England, between April 14 andApril 24, were all precise, intricate patterns in blooming, oilseed rape. The third one, a sunburst pattern,stunned Silent Circle researcher, Charles Mallett, when his tape measure showed the longest length tobe 298 feet, the size of a football field.Then the next day on April 24, came the extraordinary fourth pattern at Morgan's Hill southwest ofAvebury. No one can recall seeing such a large, precise triangular pattern made up of seven circles andthree near-half-circles in which the 5-foot-tall Morgan's Hill plants were laid down without a crease orbreak in their crisp stems.

Mallett, Silent Circle Information Center, Calne, Wiltshire, England: “These currentformations would probably be considered the most elaborate and geometrically sophisticated oilseedrape/canola formations that have occurred in British crop circle history, I would say. Right now in April2009, we've had really huge, serious formations! This has never really happened before - kind ofunprecedented.BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCES TRYING TO MOVE IN AND OUT OF OILSEED RAPE,WHETHER IT IS THE TALL 6-FOOT VARIETY OR THE HYBRID THAT IS LOWER, CAN YOUDESCRIBE FOR A GENERAL AUDIENCE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO WORK IN AND MOVETHROUGH OILSEED RAPE?These are thick, heavy, succulent stems that contain a lot of water that the average diameter of the stemis probably half to three-quarters of an inch – more like three-quarters at full maturity. So, they are verystiff and brittle plants. If you walk out into the fields, it tends to tangle around your legs. You get pollen– you walk out of the fields covered in yellow with pollen all over you as you sneeze! Not a nicemedium to be in.Considering the logistics and the problems with laying down a large, coherent pattern in that kind ofcrop, it would be a lot more difficult in oilseed rape than it would be in wheat or barley. The formationsthat have appeared so far this year, they are pretty sophisticated large, elaborate designs. 1) April 14, 2009, Ridgeway near Avebury. Diameter 118 feet.Even in the smaller, first one over east of Avebury, it’s pretty difficult to even see what it is on theground because these plants are still relatively young. The plants spring back up pretty quickly unlessthey are crushed to the ground, which will obviously kill the plants. So, you’re walking around in apattern, which is very vague on the ground. The patterns show up well from the air, but in the formationover at Avebury from April 14, probably 60% to 70% of the crop was bolt upright. The rest wassemi-laid down, somewhat upright. So, it was hard to discern the actual nature of the pattern where itstarted and finished in places. And in many areas where visitors had not walked, I found many plantsdown flat to the ground without a break or crease.Above: Rings created in flowering oilseed rape by putting down thin rowsof plants to separate standing crop, “without a break or crease.” Below: Ri ght sideof image are standing oilseed plants; on left side a thin row of plants were put downwithout breaking.

Diameter 211 feet.Charles Mallett: “Then on April 19, 2009, came the West Kennett Longbarrow pattern at 211 feetwide. That's so big that you’re wading around a long way from the tramlines and it is a thick, tangled,stinking mess, but it looked pretty in the landscape from the West Kennett Longbarrow, which is a verypopular tourist site. It’s a very ancient burial site, thousands of years old.Those kinds of crop, the oilseed rape, they are very delicate with thick, chunky stems, as can be seen inthe photographs. But if you even lightly stand on them, the stems smash and break. But again, lookinginto areas where people had not walked and would not generally walk, there were areas where all of thestems were bent neatly above the ground without breaking. There was no mechanical scrape marks onthe stems. That's pretty impossible to reproduce using any kind of physical devices I’m aware of at thistime. So, this Longbarrow formation is truly mysterious, as far as I'm concerned.Center of the 211-foot-diameter oilseed rape pattern, near the ancientWest Kennett Longbarrow across the road from Sil bury Hi ll, matches the Mayanglyph for “day” and “sun.” Aerial image © 2009 by Lucy Pringle."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Flattened oilseed rape stems inside the West Kennett Longbarrow formationreported April 19, 2009, without breaks or creases.
