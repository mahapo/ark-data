T. Factor, going beyond my regional Emmy Award-winningdocumentary, A Strange Harvest, that was first broadcast May 28, 1980, on the CBS affiliate inDenver, Colorado. What my HBO efforts provoked in government obstruction is detailed in my firstbook, An Alien Harvest © 1989. By 2009, it seems to me that one of the alleged presidential briefingpapers I was shown in 1983 might have been quite accurate in the paragraphs that stated: “Theseextraterrestrials manipulated DNA in already-evolving primates to create Homo sapiens sapiens. ... Allquestions and mysteries about the evolution of Homo sapiens sapiens on this planet have beenanswered and this project is closed” in Project GARNET.Since 1983, I have interviewed hundreds of eyewitnesses and experiencers of the phenomenon whodiscussed other details about tall and short humanoids with blond or brown or red hair; others describeencounters with tall, “standing up crocodiles or lizards.” To date, the U. S. government maintains apolicy of denial in the interest of national security that insists no other life in the cosmos has beendetected. My high strangeness files argue otherwise, but those with firsthand knowledge who havespoken to me have done so only off the record and several of those sources have now passed on. Thedeeper we go in this troubled, revolutionary century, the more important it seems to share informationoutside the politically acceptable and restricted boundaries.Howe High Strangeness Files, 1983 - 1989:In 1949, near Roswell, another saucer-shaped aerial craft crashed containing sixnon-humans - pilot, leader, couple of scientists and an engineer. MPs investigating siteheard a noise in a part of the rather damaged saucer craft and found a live alien entity. Themale being was first taken to Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where it waskept in a room for several weeks while the U.S. Air Force tried to figure out what to do.During that time, a USAF Colonel who had protected the being at the crash site, learned tocommunicate telepathically with the entity referred to as “Ebe,” an acronym forextraterrestrial biological entity. Ebe was transferred to Los Alamos National Laboratory(with at least one trip to Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio) while the Colonel remained close forthree years from 1949 until June 18, 1952, when Ebe died of unknown causes. The beingcommunicated to the Colonel that in Earth years, his non-human life expectancy was atleast 150 years and he had lived only forty years when overtaken by a mysterious illness.Ebe carried a “communicator” with him - a 12-inch-long rod with coils at the top thatallowed telepathic communication with humans. However, military and governmentauthorities were frustrated to discover that telepathic thought transfer to a group of human"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"minds is as variable as the human mind receivers. According to Ebe, in his civilizationtelepathic communication is instantaneous and the same for all. In illustration below, thelong \"earrings\" were actually described as \"silk threads\" that came down from headcovering near ears that were described as antennae for communicating back to egg-shapedcraft one of which landed at Holloman AFB in Alamogordo, New Mexico, on April 25,1964, I was told, while two other egg-shaped craft hovered defensively or offensively inthe air above the landed craft from which a Sumerian-type being with huge beaked nose,reptilian eyes and ropey headdress emerged along with two grey-skinned beings. Thelarge-nosed being carried a rod in its left hand that had a coil at the type used for telepathiccommunication with the humans at the scene.Rod communicator with coils on top was depicted as being in the left handof a large-nosed al ien being who all egedly landed at Holloman AFB i n New Mexi co,on April 25, 1964, aboard an egg-shaped craft for a meeting with American militaryand at least one scientist.

See Earthfiles Shop.Ebe was shorter than five feet. Blue-grey skin that changed color with light intensity.Telepathically communicated Ebens come from the Zeta Reticuli binary star system 39.41light-years from Earth in the constellation Reticulum (the Net). American authoritiesuncertain what to believe. The distance between the binary stars is much larger than mostbinary systems and, according to Ebe, there is a solar system orbiting around each star.According to Ebe, tall blond entities inhabit a cold planet in the Zeta Reticuli solar systemopposite the warmer Eben solar system planet. The relationship between the two differentbinary star civilizations is allegedly one of tension, perhaps even war. Ebens are said to be25,000 years advanced technologically beyond Earth humans.[ See in Archive: 120705 Earthfiles - “Zeta Reticuli I and II - Binary Homeof Extraterrestrial Biological Entities (EBEs or EBENs)?” Above: Wide view of Zeta Reticuli I and II binary star system 39.41 light-yearsfrom Earth.

The arrows indicate the distance in light-years between suns. The numbersin parentheses indicate distance from our Sun. Map from Astronomy, December 1974.According to Ebe, his planet in the Zeta Reticuli binary system has variousdegrees of brightness without total darkness. The Eben eyes are supposed tohave a bright yellow iris that is vertical like a cat or reptile with three lids thatprovide variable thickness over the eyes, depending upon brightness of light.Supposedly one pair of lids moves across the eyes horizontally, not verticallyas human lids open and shut.Another group of tall blond and perhaps tall red-haired entities are describedas inhabiting a planet orbiting the star Tau Ceti.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Tau Ceti is a 3rd-magnitude star inthe constellation Reticulum that is similar to the Sun in mass andspectral type. At 11.9 light-years from Earth, it is a relatively closestar. Tau Ceti is “metal-deficient” and so it is thought to be lesslikely to host rocky planets. Observations have detected morethan 10 times as much dust surrounding Tau Ceti as is present inthe Solar System. The star appears stable, with little stellarvariation.No companions have yet been detected around Tau Ceti throughastrometric or radial velocity measurements, but given currentsearch refinement this only excludes substellar companions suchas large brown dwarfs. Because of the debris disk, any planetorbiting Tau Ceti would face far more impact events than theEarth. Despite this hurdle to habitability, its solar analog(Sun-like) characteristics have led to widespread interest in thestar. It has been consistently listed as a target for Search forExtra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI) searches, given its stabilityand similarity to Earth's Sun.Separated by 310 seconds (a bit over five minutes) of arc (0.09degrees), the sixth magnitude Zeta-1 keeps exact pace with thesomewhat brighter fifth magnitude Zeta-2, showing that they are areal gravitational pair (but so far apart that no orbit is detectable).Zeta-1 is listed as a G3-5 dwarf, Zeta-2 as very Sun-like G2. Closeto us, Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2 are only 39.5 light-years away. Zeta-2shines with luminosity almost exactly as our Sun's solarluminosity, while Zeta-1 comes in at 0.9 Suns, which yieldrespective radii of 0.9 and 1.0 times solar and subsolar masses of0.9 and 0.96 solar masses.

Other details about Eben physiology from variety of sources, noneproven:- Flat face. No nose, only holes. The entities can smell.- No lips - only small straight line where humans would expect a mouth.- Small teeth - eat Earth vegetables?- Egg-shaped head with no hair at all.- Ears are only holes with slightly raised tissue around holes on either side ofhead.- Neck and vertebrae are more pronounced than in humans. In profile, Ebe'sback bones stuck out more. Ebe could rotate his head much further around histhin neck than a human could.- Jaw fused immobile whereas human lower jaw moves up and down.- Ebe's heart and lung system were same organ.- Simple bag for stomach. Excretion process not entirely clear, except someexcretion through skin surface.- Eben hands have four long, thin fingers and no opposable thumb. Similar tothe E. T. in Spielberg's feature movie, the Eben finger joints can extendanother inch longer.- Eben feet are pointed with nail-like substance at end, no separate toes. Likepointed hooves? (Ice cream cone-shaped prints were found at one of thecattle mutilation sites near Dulce, New Mexico, back in the 1970s.)- Blood related to chlorophyll?- No genitals in some - biological androids/clones programmed to do work onEarth?WHAT IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TALL BLOND BEINGS AND THEGREY-SKINNED EBENS?There was a “star war” battle between the Talls and Shorts that lasted 300 Earth years. Butwhen in Earth's timeline? Not known. The Talls can be aggressive and control littlerobot/androids of the Judy Doraty, Betty Andreasson and other abduction experiences.Some intel and military authorities consider the Ebens to be peace-loving, not emotional,who do not understand the need for war and were very disappointed in the Vietnam wardays. There was intense UFO focus on Vietnam. The Ebens have communicated that theyintend to prevent nuclear war on Earth no matter what. Other military and intel authoritiesdon't trust the Ebens, say they have lied. But lied about what?Some how the Ebens and Talls came to a truce in their war and are now both on Earthseeming to ignore each other, tolerate each other? One military source says there is noknown communication between the two alien groups - even though both alien types aresupposed to be working with the U. S. to trade off technology for bases from whichoperations on Earth can be conducted without interference, including the mutilation ofanimals by the Talls? Greys? Reptiles? All of them? Exact perpetrators not clear andneither is precise reason/s for harvest of animal tissues, blood and fluids. Government'sProject Sigma operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, listening to and recording variousfrequencies linked to non-human aerial craft.Between 1949 and his unexpected death in 1952, Ebe shared scientific, cultural andhistorical material contained in at least 18 volumes buried somewhere in the MJ-12 group -- National Security Council (NSC)? National Security Agency (NSA)? Defense IntelligenceAgency (DIA)? Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)? Pentagon?One 1983 military source says volumes of information from Ebens now undergroundKirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexico, moved from a classified location inWashington, D. C. between 1979 and 1983. Stealth bomber technology is based on Ebentechnology - cloaking, radar-invisibility.ARE THE EBENS AND/OR OTHER NON-HUMAN TYPES ALSO GIVING SAMETECHNOLOGIES TO SOVIET UNION OR OTHER COUNTRIES?No one seems to know the truth because humans don't know how to trust telepathicinformation from extraterrestrials.COWBOYS IN COLORADO ONCE REPORTED SEEING GREY-SKINNED BEINGSFLOAT OVER A CORRAL FENCE WHERE A MUTILATED COW WAS FOUND.THEN IN THE MIDWEST, RANCHERS SAW BLOND-HAIRED BEINGS DOWNWITH A MUTILATED COW.

DO BOTH EBENS AND TALLSMAKE SIMILAR-LOOKING ANDROIDS TO DO DIFFERENT WORK ON EARTH?Mixed answers, both yes and no.
