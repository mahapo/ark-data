It's like the wholething just fell down in one big go, and it really looks like that on the ground. It was reallyincredibly neat! My tape measure went tight at 298 feet. That is very, very large for aformation in oilseed rape, very impressive."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"“Sunburst” in yellow, flowering oilseed rape spanning 298 feet at Rutland's Farmnear ancient stone circles of Avebury.

CHARLES, WE'RE TALKING OILSEED RAPE, WHICH IS SO THICK AND FULL OFPOLLEN AND IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, AS BIG AS THIS IS,YOU WERE SEEING SO MANY STEMS THAT WERE LAID DOWN ON THEGROUND WITHOUT A CRUNCH OR A BREAK OR A CREASE.That's right. I'd say about two-thirds of the plants in the formation that we looked at didnot have breaking, crunching, creasing, crushing, snapping or ripped off flowers, whichcomes when people drag pieces of wood boards over those types of plants.Above : Oilseed rape stems inside the sunburst formation near Avebury reportedApril 23, 2009, were laid down without breaking or creases.

Diameter 308 feet.Then like 2 AM in the morning, I get woken up by Mark Fussell fromCropcircleconnector.com telling me there is another formation! I think he's having a laugh.I think, ‘Come on, Mark! I'm just getting over the sunburst!' So, I went out right away. Itwas another big one and we went into the formation and it was like, ‘No way!

I HAVE NEVER SEEN WHERE THERE HAVE BEEN THESE CIRCLES FORMING ATRIANGLE LIKE THIS IN OILSEED RAPE BEFORE.The plants are slightly a different variety or strain. They are actually taller, about5-feet-high and the stems are kind of thicker, which means they are much more brittle andmuch more difficult to manipulate. But in this formation, two people who I went with tothe big sunburst, they also went to this Morgan's Hill formation and they were, ‘Wow!You'll be really blown away by this one if you thought the sunburst was good.’And when I got to the formation, right away I could practically find no broken stems. Itwas amazing! In oilseed rape, I've never seen a formation that looked so perfect. It lookedlike a carpet of flowers. Everything was perfect! I'd say at least 95% of the flattened plantsthat I looked at had a perfect bend just above the ground and the plants are growinghorizontal. It was pretty much consistent all over the formation.Oilseed rape stems flattened in Morgan's Hill triangle of circleswithout breaking. Image © 2009 by Charles Mallett.This formation is actually slightly larger than the sunburst the day before. It's about 308feet in diameter. Very impressive! There is something deeply strange going on in that fieldthe night before. This formation at Morgan's Hill, I was very impressed with that, moreimpressed with that than I have been over many, many years of any kind of formation -the whole deal, very mysterious. Oilseed Rape Very Difficult to ManipulateBASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCE IN TRYING TO MOVE IN OILSEED RAPE(CANOLA) - WHETHER IT IS THE TALL 6 FOOT VARIETY OR THE SHORTERHYBRID THAT IS LOWER, CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR A GENERAL AUDIENCEHOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO WORK IN AND MOVE THROUGH OILSEED RAPE?They are very stiff and very brittle plants. If you wade yourself out into the field, it tendsto tangle around your legs. You walk out of the fields really yellow, you know, as thepollen comes all over you and your sneezing. Considering the logistics and problems withlaying down a large, coherent pattern in that kind of crop, it would be a lot more difficultin oilseed rape than it would be in something like wheat or barley.These April 2009 formations that have appeared this year so far look pretty sophisticated,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"large, elaborate designs, even in the smaller one east of Avebury at the Ridgeway. Prettydifficult to actually see what it is on the ground. Because these plants are still relativelyyoung, they spring back up pretty much immediately if they are not crushed to the ground.And that would obviously kill the plants.I’d say at this time, they are mysterious because there is no evidence on the ground inthose formations that suggest either was constructed by people. I look at the areas wherepeople have obviously not walked. And if I’m finding unbroken stems there, I think: Howcan that happen? When I try to bend oilseed rape plants down or just push them down tosee what the effect is, they all break. And all these first four April 2009 formations inoilseed rape, in the areas that were outside the general walk path area where people wouldnormally walk, there was a fairly high percentage of the plants that were not broken.WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING IS A COMPLEXITY INSIDE A VERY DIFFICULTCROP.Yes, I couldn’t do it!THAT BREAKS UNDER FEET, AND THAT GOES RIGHT TO THE HEART OF THEWORK FROM BIOPHYSICIST W. C. LEVENGOOD IN GRASS LAKE, MICHIGAN.HE IS CONVINCED THAT THE HARD, PHYSICAL DATA FROM THE SOIL ANDPLANTS INDICATE THAT SOME KIND OF SPINNING PLASMA WITHMICROWAVE AND ELECTRONIC ENERGIES HAVE INTERACTED WITH MANYPLANTS IN FORMATIONS THAT HE HAS STUDIED.Clearly, there are biological anomalies in the plants and compositional changes in the soil.These oilseed rape stems cannot just bend like that! If you shove a plank of wood down onthem, they break. It’s as simple as that. And to some degree in these formations this year,even though they were fairly heavily visited, there were elements of those crop circles thatI fully could not explain.WHAT IS YOUR OWN PERSONAL SENSE NOW THAT MANY OF THEGEOMETRIES ARE LIKE COUNTDOWN CLOCKS PERHAPS TO DECEMBER 2012?I think it is entirely likely. I mean, I have myself looked into the whole 2012 Mayan longcount calendar and the issue of huge cyclic events that seem to come around in thedevelopment of human consciousness. Something really strange and really amazing is interacting with the land in various parts ofthe world in various kinds of ways. It's pretty amazing! Astronomical Themes in Crop FormationsJuly 15, 2008 Earth and Solar System Crop FormationLast year, there was a crop formation down near Avebury. It was a huge crop formation inwheat depicting our solar system, in fact, with all of the planets.If you were to apply the design of that crop formation to the positions of the planets in oursolar system on December 21 to 22, 2012, that crop formation was talking about that exactdate that ends the Mayan long count calendar. That suggests some kind of shift ortransition.Incidentally, the farmer came along and trashed that solar system crop circle a couple ofdays after it arrived. And about one week later, another crop circle appeared in the samefield, which was one-third bigger than the first one – 800 feet wide (laughs)! That wasreally bizarre and that one contained a lot of very strange symbols, which I think some didrelate to ancient South American and Mesopotamian symbolism relating to the same date.The inference was that there is a kind of critical juncture that we are heading to as aspecies, as a consciousness, as a collective and that there is some kind of Wake Up! Orsome kind of transition or some kind of evolutionary event about to happen.From my experience, the people who choose to interact with this phenomenon - toexamine it, to feel it, sleep in it, do their own thing - they come out enriched and evolvedin many ways. And it's really unexplainable the effect it seems to have on people. It doeshave a fairly deep, fairly profound effect.I AGREE WITH YOU COMPLETELY ABOUT THE PROFOUND IMPACT THATCROP FORMATIONS HAVE HAD ON ME AND PEOPLE THAT I KNOW WHO HAVEBEEN GOING THERE SINCE THE EARLY 1990S, YOURSELF INCLUDED. ONE OFTHE THINGS I'M THINKING ABOUT AS WE'RE TALKING IN APRIL 2009, IS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ASTRONOMER GERALD HAWKINS, WHO PASSED AWAY A FEW YEARS AGO.BUT BEFORE HE PASSED, HE HAD CONFIDED THAT HIS PERSONAL OPINIONABOUT CROP FORMATIONS IS THAT THEY WERE BEING MADE BYINTELLIGENCES FROM ANOTHER DIMENSION - PERHAPS EVEN FROM ADIMENSION THAT WOULD BE BEYOND THE MOMENT OF DEATH IN THISDIMENSION.Sure, I would agree, just from my own direct experience. I, as have many people, haveseen very strange orbs of light and other kinds of transient phenomena in and around thecrop circles. When these things have appeared - especially close up to me - there is a kindof feeling and also a physical appearance, as if something is tuning in, rather than flying infrom Out There somewhere, but more like something is tuning in and doing what they needto do. So, I think the inter-dimensional answer is probably a lot more accurate than nutsand bolts flying saucers coming from other planets.My own experience tells me that we are dealing with some kind of inter-dimensionalcommunication system that is highly beneficial to the human species, if only we would beopen rather than dumbed down by trivia, celebrity rubbish, gossip, politics. This thing(crop circle makers) seems to behave in a really simple, really clean, really pure, kind ofchildlike way. And adults get excited about walking into a field of wheat. It does seem tocreate that kind of effect because you are walking up those tramlines, you're walking into aspace that is potentially utterly mysterious. And you have to be completely open toeverything.I think the most important facet of this crop circle phenomenon is well beyond thephysical.” 2008 Solar System, Avebury Manornear Avebury, Wiltshire, Reported July 15, 2008Solar system crop formation reported on July 15, 2008,in wheat at Avebury Manor facing the ancient double stone circleof Avebury.

C., near the start ofthe Egyptian Old Kingdom. Mayans believe that we are currently in the FifthGreat Cycle, which will end in some kind of catastrophic event and a newFirst Sun begin on December 23, 2012. That would be 5,126 years after theMayan Long Count calendar began. Popular literature speculates the end ofthe Mayan calendar coincides with Earth crossing the ecliptic plane of theMilky Way galaxy in 2012 and that what might be coming is a catastrophicastronomical event. Crop formation researchers also wonder if perhapswhatever is coming has cycled before in our galaxy and is known to the cropcircle makers who have been leaving countdown “clocks” to December 2012in crop formations for several years.]Andreas Mueller: “The crop circle formation at Avebury Manor seems to depict oursolar-system (not in proportional scale) on December 21, (+/-) 2012 - the highly debatedend of the Mayan calendar (or at least one of the most prominent interpretations of thatdate). Whatever this means and who-or-whatever created this crop circle, I do not know -but the basic message of it is quite clear.” Australian Scientist: “Avebury Manor of July 15, 2008 reminds us that the Mayan LongCount calendar will end on December 23, 2012, by showing precise orbital locations for allnine planets of our solar system on that date, plus an accurate elliptical orbit for Pluto.The 5125/6-year Mayan Long count calendar will end on December 22-23, 2012. Giventhe long period of time which it represents, all nine planets of our solar system need to beshown in order to mark its end uniquely. Such a clever astronomical diagram was shown atAvebury Manor on July 15, 2008. All nine planets appear there precisely as they will belocated in space four and one-half years from now on December 23, 2012, with oneexception.Thus, the outermost planet Pluto has been drawn in this new crop picture somewhatfurther to the right (or closer to Neptune) than should be the case. Yet, Pluto still seems tobe located correctly relative to the crossover of its highly elliptical orbit with the orbit ofNeptune.Graphic sequence © 2008 by Australian scientist."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" December 21 or 23, 2012?Australian Scientist: “Many people believe that the Mayan Long Count calendar willend precisely on December 21, 2012. Yet a new crop picture from Avebury Manor showsplanetary positions that match more closely December 23-24 than December 21. To bespecific, Venus and Mercury will lie almost directly in line with the Sun on December 21,whereas on December 23-24, Mercury will lie a little ahead of Venus.Since we are obtaining such new information directly from the circle makers, I thought itmore advisable to report the astronomical date they are actually showing us, rather thanany preconceived date of our own. For example, modern scholars remain uncertain by twofull days, whether the Long Count calendar began on August 11, 12 or 13, 3114 BC. (SeeHERE or HERE ).

Thus, if one were to draw a flat circle around the four horizontal points of that starwith radius h, where h is the height of either of its two vertical points, one would find aratio for circumference-to-height of C / h = 2 pi. For purposes of comparison, the Pyramidof the Sun in Teotihuacan shows a ratio of square-circumference-to-height of 12.560,nearly equal to 4 pi = 12.566. Similarly, the Great Pyramid in Egypt shows a ratio of6.280, nearly equal to 2 pi = 6.283 [See: http://www.world-mysteries.com/mpl_7.htm]. Could those crop artists have interacted with local humans on Earth at many times in ourdistant past?Apart from its geometrical symbols near the center, the vast majority of symbols in thatnew crop picture from Secklendorf, Germany, refer to modern astronomical phenomena. Itherefore used the NASA Near Earth Objects website and its orbital diagrams to solve fortheir meanings.To be concise, the large central triangle or pyramid shown above seems to represents ourSun in an astronomical sense. Its clever double meaning might be for the famous Pyramidof the Sun in Teotihuacan, Mexico, which has been shown several times before in crops(See: http://www.lucypringle.co.uk/photos/2001/uk2001ar.shtml#pic2).”Pyramid and sun formation reported June 21, 2001, summer solstice,in the East Field, Wiltshire, England.
