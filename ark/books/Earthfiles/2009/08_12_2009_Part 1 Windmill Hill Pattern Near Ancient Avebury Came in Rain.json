August 12, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - I returned from England today with myphotographs of the 350-foot-diameter formation at Windmill Hill near Avebury Trusloe inWiltshire County. There was heavy rain in Wiltshire through nearly every day and night oflate July and the first week of August. British newspapers reported that the unrelentingrain was delaying crop harvests in Wiltshire, Devon and other regions of England.All day and night of August 5 to 6, there had been rain in Wiltshire, so I was surprisedwhen Charles Mallett, Director of the Silent Circle Research Centre in Compton Bassett,told me there was a report of a new formation at Windmill Hill. I took the following imagesthat August 6 morning when it rained so much I struggled to keep the camera from gettingtoo wet between shots, worried that it might stop working in all the moisture.The next day on August 7, 2009, Charles Mallett took his 20-foot-pole and camera to theWindmill Hill formation when the sun finally came out for awhile. Those photos are in Part2 of this Earthfiles report.
