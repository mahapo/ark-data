July 15, 2009 Silbury Hill, Wiltshire County, England - On the night of July 4 to 5,2009, a crew of documentary filmmakers with high definition video cameras were campedon top of Silbury Hill from about 2 AM until sunup between 4 and 4:30 AM in the Britishhigher latitude summer light. Atop Silbury Hill, the film crew was only a quarter-mile fromthe location of what many experienced crop formation investigators say is as spectacular awheat formation as there has ever been. The pattern spans 350 feet in diameter withunusual shading and \"immaculate\" ground lay.That date of July 5 was only two days before the July 7 date that an Australian scientistand American physicist Mike Reed had discussed since mid-April as being a date repeatedover and over in the spring oilseed rape formations. Their speculation was the formationthemes were the sun and a solar event on July 7, the same date as a penumbral lunareclipse.

It's definitely a genuine enigma.”Charles R. Mallett, Crop Circle Researcher and Manager, Silent Circle InformationCentre, Calne, Wiltshire, England: “ That formation (Silbury headdress) was absolutelygenuine. There is no question about that. It was pretty amazing!They arrived around 2 AM and didn’t see anything strange or lights, but they saw the bigformation when the sun came up, which was between 4 to 4:30 AM in Britain in earlyJuly. The film crew went into the formation straight away. The film crew said there washeavy dew on the laid down crop, yet there were no footprints and it was not disturbed.The crew said the headdress formation was immaculate. It all looked good. They werepretty well impressed. It’s a very large event by any standards, over a diameter ofapproximately 350 feet. I’m used to circles and have walked in hundreds of them. But thisone was, ‘How on earth could this possibly be homemade? When I was walking around inthat formation it was like, ‘This is unreal!’CHARLES, WHO IS DOING THE FILM PRODUCTION?They are independent. The guy leading up the trip is Charlie and they are decent peopleI’ve been working with for weeks. Charlie is British, but has been living in the States for along time. The rest are Americans. Charlie, is very fascinated in the crop formations and istrying to make an objective film to present to the wider public. So, I’m doing consultingwith them and advising about new formations as they happen. Kind of irritating when theyadvise me of a new formation, in a way! (laughs)IF THE FILM CREW WAS THERE FROM 2 AM ON, THAT’S 2.5 HOURS UNTIL SUNUP AND NO ONE COULD MAKE THE 350-FOOT-DIAMETER HEADDRESS IN 2.5HOURS.Right, there’s no way anybody could look at that and say it’s not incredible! Anyone whowalked in it would be very impressed at the sheer size and complexity. The level ofcoordination you would require to create something like that in day light on flat ground,well, I can’t equate doing it in three or four hours of darkness. And the film crew was ontop of Silbury Hill. If there were any torches (flashlights) or cigarettes burning, from on topof that hill that night, the crew would definitely have caught sight of it. So, at best one cansay that there were no visible light sources in that field between 2 AM and daylight at 4AM to 4:30 AM. That formation is a pretty major enigma!I arrived there around 9:30 AM and spent some time looking at the plants and took thephotos and pole shots, which have the date and time in the images so people can see whenmy images were shot. That’s a big, spectacular pattern and it was crowded by 10 AM onJuly 5. A lot of people went in there and it’s already trampled to death. But luckily, I got inthere early and had a good look at it and took ground photographs before the crowdsarrived.

C. Levengood hypothesizes is caused by microwave and electric energies from aspinning plasma vortex that comes down from the sky and interacts with the plants, rapidlyheating the cell water so that the tissues soften and collapse into the various crop formation patterns.Charles Mallett: “By the time I got to the formation, there were large numbers of peoplearriving. It’s amazing how word seems to spread! There is an effort not to spread wordvery fast because the formations need careful consideration before the busloads arrive.Once a lot of people have been in a crop circle, there is a lot of damage.In a nutshell, this Silbury Hill headdress crop circle was deeply impressive and I don’tknow anybody who could achieve that in a few hours in the dark. It’s not feasible. It’s notlogical.So, one has to conclude there is something more to this. The way the crop was laid wasvery impressive. In the top area of the formation closest to Silbury Hill, as you can clearlysee in the aerial shots, the crop is laid in a fairly interesting manner criss-crossing all overthe place, creating a kind of 3-dimensional image in the laid crop from the aerialperspective."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The unusual “mountain shading” can be seen in this aerial photograph on the far sideof the circle nearest Silbury Hill.
