He had twocanisters of 35mm footage with him. ...He told me directly that it was actualfootage of the UFOs on the ground.” - Mike Verrano, RAF BentwatersCapt. and Day Shift Commander, December 1980Return to Part 1July 22, 2009 Phoenix, Arizona - Eight years after the Rendlesham Forest mysteriousaerial light encounters, on October 14, 1988, actor Mike Farrell hosted UFO Cover-Up:Live!, a two-hour prime time syndicated television special that was broadcast in NorthAmerica. What happened behind the scenes was a secret hypnosis session with JohnBurroughs on November 11, 1988, after the TV broadcast. A producer wanted to find outwhat happened to John Burroughs near the lights and the rumor that John either “jumpedup” on a craft or was lifted upward in a beam of light. John was confused by the rumorbecause he could not clearly remember what happened when he was near the lights inRendlesham Forest on either the early morning of December 26, with Jim Penniston, orwith Adrian Bustinza on the early morning of December 28.I’m now going to share brief excerpts from the unpublicized November 11, 1988, JohnBurroughs hypnosis session in which John is the only one speaking to the hypnotherapistand TV producer, but John quotes various military personnel he is hearing in his hypnoticstate beginning with what the Shift Commander was saying.John Burroughs,Phoenix, ArizonaNov. 11, 1988 Privately Videotaped Hypnosis Excerpts with former RAFBentwaters Airman 1st Class John Burroughs about events in RendleshamForest on December 26, 1980, after midnight.- John Burroughs (B)- Hypnotherapist (H)- Producer Curt Brubaker (P)"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Aerial of RAF Woodbridge East Gate and Rendlesham Forest illustrated with orange-coloredpath that Jim Penniston, John Burroughs and Edward Cabansag took following mysterious,unidentified aerial lights after midnight on December 26, 1980.Computer illustration by James W.

Burroughswas told that a female Shift Commander was driving in her jeep when a blue light stoppedher vehicle. The blue light moved inside her jeep and back out. The blue light scared her somuch she cried and was relieved of her duty for the night.So, Burroughs decided to return to Rendlesham Forest after midnight on December 28,1980, with a couple of friends.
