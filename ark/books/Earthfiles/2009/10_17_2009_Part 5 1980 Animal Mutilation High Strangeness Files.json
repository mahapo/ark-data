Thissegment follows up on Briggsdale science teacher, Iona Hoeppner's, investigation of thetwo steer mutilations on the Roland Ball ranch five miles west of Briggsdale discoveredTuesday, September 16, 1980. On Thursday, September 18, the Balls took Iona out to thepasture to take tissue and fluid samples from the freshest dead calf. A month later onOctober 15, 1980, I talked with Iona by phone about her investigation. Interview Notes from Phone Conversationwith Iona Hoeppner on October 15, 1980Iona told me that Weld County Sheriff Andrews had cut a triangle-shaped pieceof hide in the calf's belly that included part of the 4-inch circle excision themutilators had done. Wanting to look at both the mutilator's cut line under amicroscope and compare to the Sheriff's known cut, Iona Hoeppner used herown scalpel to cut around the mutilator's circle and Sheriff Andrew's excisionfor one large sample from the freshest calf.Iona tried to get blood from a leg vein, but could not. So, she put her syringe inthe carotid artery. She said she should have gotten a syringe full of blood. Butshe could only extract about 5 cubic centimeters (ccs) of a nearly transparent,maroon-colored fluid. She thought perhaps it was mostly serum with some"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"corpuscles.She also took smear samples from the mouth fluids around the calf's teeth andtissue samples from the eyes and skin.There was a pool of red-colored fluid about 3 to 4 centimeters deep and 12 to 13centimeters across near the calf's head. There was also some of this red-coloredfluid near the calf's belly. The strange fluid did not absorb into the loose,crumbly soil and was not even evaporating while a hot wind blew. Iona gatheredsome of that red liquid into a vial.Iona also tried to take samples from the two puncture wounds on the back ofthe calf's neck. She told me, \"The strange thing was, there wasn't any interstitialfluid or blood in those holes.\" She tried to get something from the holes on asmear glass, but couldn't get anything because the holes were so dry. Eventually,Iona took a small incision from inside both holes, about 1 centimeter into eachhole.Iona measured the diameter of the holes. Each puncture was 5 millimeters indiameter. The distance between the puncture holes was 2 centimeters. Eachwent into the calf's neck approximately 3 to 3.5 centimeters. The punctures wereapproximately 5 centimeters to the right of the steer's spinal column atapproximately the thoracic vertebrae. Was this the same type of hole in theBateman heifer?Iona said she tried to probe the holes, but it was hard to know exactly how deepthe holes had gone into the calf because the underlying muscle tissue might haveclosed up some after death. She did not know.Iona said the first things that came to her mind when she examined thepuncture wounds were \"towel clamps used in hospital surgery.\" She is also amedical school drop out and had worked with them.Iona took all her samples back to her lab immediately and set up cultures in herincubator, did some stains and around midnight, her husband and the highschool coach joined her in the lab after a football game. She had opened upwindows because the calf sample smelled bad, so the men helped her close thewindows and lock up.At 6:30 AM, 6.5 hours later, the school's maintenance crew got to school and anhour later at 7:30 AM, they called Iona Hoeppner to ask, \"Did you leave thedoor open and stuff all over the floor in the lab?\"Iona immediately left for the school and was shocked to discover that someonehad gone through everything. They took all her fluid samples from the steer, allthe cultures in the incubator, which was inside a cabinet and would not havebeen found unless the intruder was specifically looking for the cultures and waspersistent enough to go through every cabinet in the room, which the intruderhad done.Iona told me, \"The strangest thing was that the vial containing the liquid samplefrom the ground had apparently been emptied into another container that theintruder carried because the sample jar I had put the fluid in and labeled was lefton the counter along with the screw cap that had been on it. Now the sample jarwas empty. So, the intruder had to have transferred that liquid to some othercontainer.Furthermore, the intruder went through my chemical cabinet. A bottle offormaldehyde had been set aside as if to be taken. Instead, what was missingwas my brand new methyl alcohol. And the intruder also transferred that alcoholto some other container because the methyl alcohol container was empty in thecabinet.\"Whoever took those calf samples did not want them contaminated byformaldehyde and decided instead to put the specimens in the methyl alcohol.At least that is my speculation. In fact, I myself intended to store the specimensin the alcohol, too. Whoever went through the lab also was looking forspecific-sized lab containers. There was a chemistry sophistication in the actionsof whoever broke into my lab and took all the calf samples.\"\"Who knew you gathered the samples from the calf?\" I asked.\"The Ball family, my family and most of the Briggsdale community's 63residents. I am the only scientifically knowledgeable person living here and Iwas expected to help the Balls investigate the strange deaths of the two calves.\"Iona told me some other odd details about the theft. The windows were all"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"locked except one, which she never opened because she always put studentscience projects on a ledge in front of that window. It was the one window inher science lab that was open as usual, but not a thing on the ledge had beendisturbed.\"Could the intruder have picked the door lock or used a credit card to open thedoor lock?\" I wondered.\"Well, my husband tried sliding a thin metal plate in the door and was able toopen it, so the room was not very secure.\"The Briggsdale High School Superintendent did not want the theft reportedpublicly because he was afraid it would upset the residents and students toomuch. But who was watching Iona Hoeppner on Thursday, September 18, whenshe went to the Ball ranch to gather samples from the mutilated male calf?
