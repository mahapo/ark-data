Since June of 2008, Alison Kruse,her daughter and others have repeatedly seen unidentified aerial lights and occasionally beamsshining down into trees near abandoned coal mines. November 25, 2009 Murrysville, Pennsylvania - Alison Kruse, 47, is the owner of aconstruction site development company in the Murrysville, Pennsylvania, region about 20miles east of Pittsburgh. Her home is about a quarter mile from old abandoned coal minesthat give off radon gas from uranium decay and often the family hears low frequency humsthat are sometimes loud enough to vibrate inside their heads. The hums seem to come fromunderground.Since August 2009, Alison, her daughter and others have seen amber-gold orbs, “likemini-suns,” or white balls of light going in and out of woods near the abandoned coal"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"mines about 700 feet from the Kruse home. The unusual aerial phenomena, including largeaerial triangles similar to the Belgium triangular UFOs of the early 1990s, are so frequentthat in the 2009 summer, Alison purchased a $323 Clover HDC-501 “military grade” IRvari-focus, Color Day/Night 5mm-50mm security camera to put in various positions on herroof. Alison also purchased a $1400 Sony HDR-VR500 HD digital camcorder attached toa $3,300 ATN NVM14-3A Generation 3 Nightvision scope with a 5X zoom lens.Sony HDR-VR500 HD digital camcorder attached to an ATN NVM14-3A Generation3 Nightvision scope with a 5X zoom lens.

Image © 2009 by Alison Kruse.Recently, I interviewed Alison about how the aerial light phenomena started back in June2008, and a dramatic video file she captured on October 10, 2009, of a bright sphere oflight emitting a strong beam down into the woods. Interview:Alison Kruse, Owner, construction site development company, region of Murrysvilleand Export, Pennsylvania: “On June 16, 2008, my daughter had been on the phone lateat night with a friend and in the morning she told me, ‘Mom, there was this really weirdplane last night – really weird! It was glowing.’I asked, ‘What do you mean it was glowing?’She said, ‘It was glowing red like this,’ and she made a motion with her hands like it waspulsing. I said, ‘That doesn’t sound like a plane.’"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"And she said, ‘No, Jake (boyfriend on phone call) didn’t think so either. He said it was aUFO.’So, I had her draw it and she drew a classic disc-shape with a row of chasing white lightsback and forth on the bottom, like strobing back and forth, back and forth. And it wasdown below the treeline and she said, ‘It stopped over Holly’s house.’ That’s a pretty bighouse down in the bottom of the valley. It stopped over that house for a little while andthen took off real fast. The direction she pointed to was towards Delmont, Pennsylvania(east of Export on above map).I asked, ‘Did Jake see it?’She said, ‘Yes, he saw seven red lights in the sky out his window and he ducked downbecause he was scared.’SO YOU DECIDED TO GO GET A NIGHTWATCH CAMERA?I just did that in June of this year, 2009. But a year ago on October 21, 2008, I saw twobright, shining, diamond-like, large lights - like very bright, shining stars. I’m staring atthem outdoors while I'm grilling burgers and there are sparkly colors like a really gooddiamond. I’m staring because I’d been in the astronomy club and we go sit on lawn chairsat 3 AM trying to catch a meteor shower. So, I’m scratching my head because I wouldthink I’d know what two bright stars were. I knew that Jupiter and Venus were not going tobe in conjunction for another month. So, they were immediately ruled out, but it looked asif Jupiter and Venus were next to each other, but sparkling like diamonds.And then the smaller light dimmed out and then the larger one dims out. I was like, ‘Oh,my God! I think I just saw a UFO!’When I told my fiance about it, he said, ‘Oh, I forgot to tell you when I was coming homeon the turnpike, I saw a thing that looked like a comet go straight across over the highway,stop and do a right angle turn away from me.’I’m like, ‘How could you forget to tell me that?!’He said, ‘Well, you were asleep when I came home.’ December 7, 2008Huge Cigar-Shaped Aerial CraftThen nothing happened until December 7, 2008. The girls were sled riding in the yard. Itwas about 16 degrees Fahrenheit. They come running to the patio door banging on theglass, both of them, ‘Mom, a giant UFO!’I ran outside with my slippers on. There’s snow on the ground obviously and by the time Iget out there, the sky thing is gone. I had the girls come in and draw pictures sitting at twotables far apart from each other so they couldn’t look at each other’s sketches. They bothdrew a real long, cigar-shaped UFO. They said there was a white dot in the middle of it anda white dot traveling above it that was not attached, a row of red lights or windows, and itwas huge. The girls said if their arms were extended, the length of the cigar-shaped objectwould be equal to their hands separated by four inches.Alison's daughter was 12-years-old on December 7, 2008, when she drew this sketchto show her mother what she and her friend had seen in the sky while sleddingin the yard.

So when this sky events started happening pretty regularly around here, Ibought the good camera because I said I wasn’t going to report anything until I had visualproof. October 10, 2009Light Emits Beam Down into WoodsYOU HAVE BEEN VIDEOTAPING PRETTY STEADILY SINCE MAY TO OCTOBER2009. TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED ON OCTOBER 10.There is an unfinished part of the golf course on the opposite side of the woods. Thesewoods surround that and then there is a part that’s a green way that is owned by thecounty. I drove onto the top of a nearby farm field because it’s a high point in the area towatch the activity better. Before at that spot, I've filmed plasma-type lights coming out ofthe trees that rise up and morph into what is supposed to fool the eye into thinking they areordinary human airplanes with running lights. I have also filmed the steady burning‘orb/spheres.’ Sometimes they forget to leave the lights on just turn on the white flashingstrobes with no navigation red/green lights. They only start out being about 2-3 feet indiameter, which you can see above the head of a local Constable who came to check outall the light activity in the woods. See: Alien Hunting part 6/8 videohttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3dB9-B-Tf0. The combination of small size and dimlights when starting out fools the eye into thinking they're farther away. But surroundingthe woods busted them.MIMICKING AIRPLANES?Mimicking airplanes.ON OCTOBER 10, 2009, WHAT HAPPENED?I’d already videotaped several lights coming out of the woods. Not just those woods, butout of other patches of woods in the area and about 20 miles away over Oakmont,Pennsylvania. I had read online that in order to get good images, you need at least ageneration 3 or 4 nightvision scope, so that’s what I bought and attached it to my HDcamera. That was the first night I tried using it.OCTOBER 10, 2009?Yes. I got a couple of other objects and you have to play around with focusing becauseyou have to focus the camera, focus the scope and focus the magnifier lens. It has a 5Xmagnifier on it. The whole thing weighs about 15 pounds. I had it on a tripod that night. Itwas a cold night and I had the car running with the heater on next to me about 4 to 5 feetfrom where I was standing with the camera on the tripod."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"HOW DID YOU CAPTURE THE BEAM?It was just another low-flying object that came out of the woods. When you see on yoursecurity camera at home night after night round balls of light moving through the treetopsand then see them rise above the trees, hover for awhile and then turn on these flashinglights, you get curious about what they are when they fly over your house and they arecompletely silent. If any other manmade thing flies over, you can hear it coming a miledown the road and it shakes your walls. So, when there is a low-flying light, you startpaying attention to it!These star-like whatever – I don’t know if it’s a mothership spitting out the ‘kids at thepool?’ (laughs) Or is it a vortex type thing opening up? I've seen star-like objects that arebright and then shrink down to hardly any light and then Poof! It pops a little light out andthen another one comes out.ON OCTOBER 10, WHAT CAUGHT YOUR ATTENTION?The best vantage point to view these things when they pop out of the woods is the farmfield across the street from my house, which puts it about 1200 feet from the woods. Andwhen you see the lights rise up from the woods that catches your attention!THAT NIGHT YOU HAVE A TRIPOD OUT THERE AND YOUR NEW STAR SCOPEAND THE HD CAMERA OUT IN THE FIELD TRYING TO USE THE EQUIPMENT.WHAT ATTRACTED YOUR ATTENTION THAT MADE YOU START VIDEOTAPING?If you watch the videotape, I caught it from – there were several of them flying around. Ihoped they would fly over the top of me so I could get a good outline shape of it. That’swhat I was trying to achieve. What happened is that it was just another light that came up.I have footage of others before this one.BUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH THIS ONE?Well, this one as it went past, all of a sudden I noticed in the lower part of the little LCDscreen – it took me awhile to realize there was a beam coming out of the tree at thebottom. I immediately thought it was some type of search beam. I didn’t hear any zappingsounds, no crackling, nothing coming from it except fake plane flashing in the sky and nosound from it at all.My car was running, but if it had been a plane it would have been about 700 feet from meat that point (I measured the distance later). And I, of course, would have heard aman-made craft if it was one at that short of distance.THE LIGHT MOVES ALONG SOME DISTANCE WITH THE BEAM COMING DOWN.The beam looks like it is shining through an opening in the branches of the tree. If you lookat the blow-up images frame by frame, the beam looks like it is shining through spaces ofthe trees, not hitting the leaves. And notice the frame-by-frame shows the beam is beingbent by my car's windshield, indicating it is not a lens flare.

I went and looked in the daytime and there are some brown leaves, but nothingthat looked curled or burned.NO, IT LOOKS MORE LIKE FALL.Yeah, like fall brown patches here and there. Nothing smelled burned.THAT WAS THE VERY FIRST BEAM COMING FROM ONE OF THE MOVINGAERIAL LIGHTS OUT OF THE WOODS.Ye s .TO YOUR EYES AWAY FROM THE NIGHTVISION GREEN, WHAT COLOR ARETHE LIGHTS USUALLY IN THE WOODS?An amber, orange or gold color. They glow big like a mini-sun sometimes, but the smallerones stay more white and you only see a faint, fast white streak a 100 feet or so up in theair, then instant white-strobe flashing. The big ones are the ones I see morphing.THE LIGHT ON OCTOBER 10 WITH THE BEAM, DID YOU SEE THAT WITH YOUREYE?That was a whiter-yellow color.WAS THE BEAM WHITE-YELLOW?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The beam – I have no idea about the color of the beam because I was more worried aboutkeeping the shot in focus and I didn’t glance up when the beam was coming down in myframe. And I don’t know what to make of all this before this spring because I didn’t knowUFOs would mimic planes and helicopters. Now several other people online are reportingand/or filming similar UFOs pretending to be ordinary human planes and helicopters - allover the world in such places as Argentina, Brazil, Russia, UK, Canada, and Australia.From what I’m seeing, lights are flying around like they are sightseeing. I'm pretty suretheir method of arrival is dropping the balls of energies into the trees, which I've caught onsurveillance cam and in the nightvision scope. They look like meteors without trails thathang around in the trees until take off. Do they gather stuff like radon gas or the uraniumdeposits it comes from? Or are they sucking electricity from powerlines right near thewoods? All I know is, my surveillance cam catches the lights leaving the same way theycame by zipping right back up into the sky, like a meteor falling in reverse. I also noticethe lights don't seem to like rainy weather. The best night for watching them always seemsto be the next clear weather night after many days of rainy weather.AND WHY THE BEAM?Yeah, what’s the beam doing there? There’s an old coal mine underneath where that beamhit. There’s just an old stone opening to it. I wonder if a tunnel goes underneath there andthat UFO thing was maybe searching for that tunnel?That’s the only thing I can think of – that maybe it was looking into the ground and thehollow space that’s probably there. November 18, 2009,Mimicking Airplane Lights and Sound© 2009 Alison Kruse.When I was up on my roof changing the filming angle of my Clover surveillance camera,to my left in the trees I saw an orange/amber ‘mini sun’ hanging out. So, I got off the roof,grabbed my Sony camcorder (with 12X optical zoom w/1.7X teleconversion lens only) andstarted to film the aerial light. It was headed slowly (like 20 miles an hour) over the edge ofmy property from east to west approximately. It had the initial look of two, white, steady,far-apart headlights with two alternating red lights in between.The video frames show the object/s as it came closer and flew over while it jutted outadditional parts with lights on the ends - I think to try and mimic our aircraft. I've evenfilmed one unfolding its ‘fake wing.’"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Video frames on November 18, 2009, in Murrysville, Pennsylvania, on Sony camcorderwith 12X optical zoom w/1.7X teleconversion lens only. “This object turned ona rather low-volume jet engine noise.” Video © 2009 by Alison Kruse.Then this object turned on a rather low-volume jet engine noise.
