Right: Red-gray residues of burnt thermiteused by railway workers to cut or weld railroad tracks shown in Wikipedia.Return to Part 1May 1, 2009 Spring City, Utah - The third listed author on the April 2009 BenthamOpen Chemical Physics Journal paper is Steven E. Jones, Ph.D., Prof. Emeritus of Physicsfrom Brigham Young University and now a private citizen who has long been investigatingwhat exactly happened to bring the two World Trade Center towers and Building 7 straightdown and so quickly.Prof. Jones received his Ph.D. in Physics from Stanford University in 1978. After that, hedid post-doctoral research at the Los Alamos Meson Physics facility in New Mexico andthe Idaho National Engineering Lab in Idaho Falls. In 1985, Prof. Jones joined the facultyin the Dept. of Physics and Astronomy at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. Hewas asked to take early retirement in 2007 from the university and thinks it’s because his9/11 research is so controversial.Interview:Steven E. Jones, Ph.D., Prof. Emeritus of Physics, Brigham Young University, andnow private citizen investigating 9/11, Spring City, Utah: “There was explosivematerial in the World Trade Center towers – we need to find out who did this and whywere we told that it was jet fires that brought these buildings down when we find explosivematerial?The other question, of course, for NIST – National Institute for Standards and Technology– the question to them is: why did they refuse to look for explosives in the residue, the dustof the World Trade Center? They refused, and have consistently refused, our pleas to lookfor residues of explosive materials in the dust.WHAT ARE THE REASONS THAT NIST GIVES FOR REFUSING?The reasons are quoted in a paper about a year ago now in April 2008. And in that paper,we quote NIST and its spokesman, Mr. Michael Newman. He said, ‘Well, why would youlook if you know it’s not there?’WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR NIST?It’s part of the Dept. of Commerce. It’s a federally funded laboratory. NIST received a"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"charge from the U. S. Congress to determine why and how the World Trade Center towersfell and World Trade Center Building 7. NIST received that charge from Congress andfunding. Over $20 million has been spent. Then NIST comes up with this lame excuse fornot looking for explosive materials. That’s part of the question, right? How and why didthe towers come down and Building 7? Well, NIST refused to look for explosives andwe’ve published now considerable evidence. Perhaps they will finally look for explosivematerial.But you know, beyond that, the public I think should be concerned – perhaps evenoutraged that there is explosive material in the World Trade Center dust and NIST hasrefused to look for it. We’ve requested this and they have just not replied, except that theywon’t look.” Effort to Have NIST Comment OnThermite Research in Bentham JournalIn the week of April 20 to 24, I repeatedly phoned and emailed the World Trade CenterInvestigation Team offices at the National Institute of Standards and Technology, known asNIST. NIST’s Director of Buildings and Fire Research Lab is Shyam (pronounced Shaum)Sunder, who is also the lead investigator of the NIST inquiry into the 9/11 World TradeCenter catastrophe.My first indication that people in that NIST office don’t want to talk to reporters was whenI simply asked a secretary answering a phone how many people were employed in theWorld Trade Center Investigation Team. She immediately hung up on me.Later, I was told that 30 people now work for Mr. Sunder, after I received a call back fromMichael Newman, public information officer in NIST’s Public and Business Affairs officein Gaithersburg, Maryland. I told Mr. Newman I had a copy of an April 2009 OpenChemical Physics Journal paper entitled “Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dustfrom the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe” and wanted NIST’s perspective on thenanotechnology-produced thermite evidence presented.To my surprise, Mr. Newman said. “Oh, we have just received a copy of this ourselves anddon’t want to comment.” I said the journal paper provided photomicrographic and otherevidence of explosive material in the WTC dust, so it seemed important to discuss thefindings with NIST who was charged by Congress to find out how and why the towers andBuilding 7 collapsed straight down. Mr. Newman said, “We don’t want to give time andattention to these alternative theories.”I asked if I could interview his boss, Shyam Sunder. Mr. Newman said he thought Mr.Sunder was traveling and would not be available for an interview. So, I asked Mr.Newman, as a public affairs representative for NIST, if he would provide an interview. Hesaid he did not want to talk either. I said in fairness, I needed some on-the-record commentfrom NIST about the nanothermite evidence.Mr. Newman’s answer was in email the next day. He sent me three NIST public Q & Apapers dated August 28, 2006, December 14, 2007, and one updated on April 21, 2009 –last week - the same time I started contacting NIST for an interview. [ See Websitesbelow.]In its 2006 question and answer paper, NIST repeated questions sent by the public:Q: “ Did the NIST investigation look for evidence of the WTC towers beingbrought down by controlled demolition? Was the steel tested for explosives orthermite residues? The combination of thermite and sulfur (called thermate)“slices through steel like a hot knife through butter?”A: “NIST did not test for the residue of these compounds in the steel.”Previous NIST research is referenced and the Q & A paper states, “...NIST concluded thatthere were no explosives or controlled demolition involved in the collapses of the WTCtowers.”The next paragraph is about NIST’s estimate that “many thousands of pounds of thermitewould need to have been placed inconspicuously ahead of time, remotely ignited, andsomehow held in direct contact with the surface of hundreds of massive structuralcomponents to weaken the building. This makes thermite an unlikely substance forachieving a controlled demolition.”But no comment about nanotechnology-produced thermitic material. The April 2009"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"published research shows many photomicrographs of thermitic material in the millimeterand smaller range containing ingredients that the chemists and physicists concluded at theend of their paper, “is active, unreacted thermitic material, incorporating nanotechnology,and is a highly energetic pyrotechnic or explosive material.”In NIST’s updated April 21, 2009, fact sheet, it states:Q: “Is it possible that thermite or thermate contributed to the collapse ofWTC7?A: “NIST has looked at the application and use of thermite and hasdetermined that its use to sever columns in WTC7 on 9/11/01 was unlikely.”So there has been a slight change between August 2006 and April 2009 from “there wereno explosives or controlled demolition” to the less dogmatic, “ unlikely.” Any Official Feedback to Nano-ThermiticResearch in Bentham Journal?DR. JONES, HAVE YOU RECEIVED ANY QUESTION OR COMMENT FROMANYONE IN THE AMERICAN CONGRESS OR ANY COMMENT FROM NIST?No comment from NIST as yet. I have not heard since the (April 2009 Bentham Journal)publication from anyone in Congress. However, shortly before publication, I spoke to myCongressman, the honorable Jason Chaffetz (R-3rd District, Utah), and requested toexplain to him what we had found - the red-gray chips, these explosives in the WorldTrade Center dust.In November 2008, he did come to my office and I gave him some of the data. It had notyet been published. We spent a good hour going over the data and he told me after Ifinished that he wants an in-depth investigation, including the question of explosives on9/11 must be undertaken. This, of course, is what we are saying in our paper that with thefinding of unexploded reactive material in the World Trade Center dust, there needs to bea serious follow up - not just to confirm our results. That's been done (by two other sciencelabs to date), but to find out who made this material and why it was in the World TradeCenter? And why NIST has consistently refused to even look for explosive residue. SinceNIST is charged by Congress to determine how and why the destruction of these buildings,the two towers and Building 7, then that needs to be pursued by Congress because theyhave not done their job.DR. JONES, WHAT DO YOU SAY TO YOUR FELLOW AMERICANS WHO ARELISTENING AND SAYING, ‘MY GOD, THIS CANNOT BE TRUE?’Well, unfortunately, it can be true because the science tells us there is this highly energetic,explosive material in the World Trade Center dust. That is just a fact. Now, what you dowith that fact is the next problem. This nano-thermitic evidence can be ignored to our perilbecause something very nefarious happened on 9/11. The next step is to consider whatdoes this mean if you care about people. I do care enough about people to say, ‘Well, weneed to find out who put explosive material in the World Trade Center towers and why?’And then we have a push for an investigation. That will take having viewers and listenerscalling their Congress people to ask, ‘Have you seen these papers?’ We need to go the nextstep now and find out who made it and why? That's going to take some outrage.” Who Is BehindBentham Science Publishers, Ltd.?The shocking and controversial content and implications of all this made me want to knowwho Bentham Science Publishers, Ltd., is that published the nano-thermitic research. Thatturned out to be another surprise. In 1994, a group of unnamed private investors registeredBentham Science Publishers, Ltd., in Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, a federation of sevenemirates, or states, on the Persian Gulf bordering Oman and Saudi Arabia. Bentham wasnamed after Jeremy Bentham, an 18th Century British legal expert, who politically arguedfor separation of church and state, freedom of expression, equal rights for women and endto slavery.Over the past fifteen years, Bentham Science Publishers, Ltd., has sold onlinesubscriptions to 90 science journals that include Current Medical Chemistry, CurrentMolecular Medicine, and Current Pharmaceutical Design. Then two years ago in 2007,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Bentham began releasing 235 Open Access journals online, one of which in the past year isBentham Open Chemical Physics Journal. Oddly, Bentham's main editorial staff is inKarachi, Pakistan, with three other offices listed on its contact page: Sharjah, United ArabEmirates; Bussum, Holland; and Oak Park, Illinois.I was particularly interested in Bentham Science Publishers background because ofanother question: Why wouldn't The New York Times, Wa sh i n g t o n P o st , 60 Minutes, CNNand other investigative media be headlining a scientific discovery of explosivenanothermitic material in 9/11's World Trade Center dust? If the science data is not true,then that needs to be reality checked and reported.Are others in the media ignoring this journal because the chemistry research was publishedin Bentham and not the highly respected journals, Science or Nature? No American iscomfortable with the implication that an act as horrific as the destruction of the WorldTrade Center buildings and nearly 3,000 people on September 11, 2001, was even morecomplicated than airliners hitting the tops of the two tall towers - and then seven hourslater, the mysterious free fall collapse of World Trade Center Building 7 that was never hitby an airplane.If the United States under President Barack Obama is trying for a new, more honesttransparency in government, shouldn’t the nanothermitic research presented by ProfessorsHarrit, Jones and others be at least discussed and commented upon by our taxpayer-funded U. S. Department of Commerce National Institute of Standards and Technology?As of this date, I still have no other response from NIST beyond their Q & A papers thatsay NIST did not test for the residue of thermitic compounds in the WTC steel and that“NIST has looked at the application and use of thermite and has determined that its use tosever columns in WTC7 on 9/11/01 was unlikely.”Return to Part 1More Information:For further information about 9/11, please see Earthfiles Archived reports below:• 08/01/2008 — Part 1: Rise of Fourth Reich in America?• 11/20/2007 — Do Black Budget Trillions Support A Secret American Space Program?• 10/06/2004 — Is NRC Making Terrorist Work Easier?
