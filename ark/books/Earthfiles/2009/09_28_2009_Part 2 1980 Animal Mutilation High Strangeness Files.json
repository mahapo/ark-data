Return to Part 1September 28, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - In this series of Real X-Files, I amsharing my private 1980 files of high strangeness. But before I continue with thoseunpublished files, I want to insert a brief history of the American government's own TOPSECRET files related to UFO crash retrievals and the animal mutilation phenomenon.Since the May 1980 broadcast of my television documentary A STRANGE HARVEST, Ihave tried to find facts about the important question: What does the United Statesgovernment know about animal mutilations linked to non-human entities and technologiesretrieved from crashed discs which have provoked an American policy of misinformationand denial in the interest of national security since at least 1947?Back in 1983, while working on a documentary project for Home Box Office entitled,UFOs: The E.T. Factor, I met an elderly rancher who lived in Corona, New Mexico. Hesaid he had known Mac Brazel, the rancher who found strange debris on his land and wentto the Roswell Sheriff to report his discovery on July 4, 1947. The Corona resident toldme, “I heard there was a horrible secret about that crash.”Perhaps the answer to the “horrible secret” is the fear and shock that President Trumanand his close associates felt when they allegedly learned that dissected humans and/orhumanoids and animal parts were found in at least two of the UFOs that crashed in NewMexico in early July 1947. Interplanetary Phenomenon UnitOne of the many important documents gathered by Bob and Ryan Wood and displayed forstudy at their website, www.majestic12documents.com, is entitled: TOP SECRET ULTRAINTERPLANETARY PHENOMENON UNIT SUMMARY INTELLIGENCEASSESSMENT File Ref. 001947122-A.1206.This IPU document states:“The extraordinary recovery of fallen airborne objects in the state of NewMexico, between 4 July - 6 July 1947: This Summary was prepared byHeadquarters Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit, Scientific and TechnicalBranch, Counterintelligence Directorate, as requested by A.

The site is called LZ-2 in the report, which means, “Landing Zone 2” onWhite Sands territory between the Trinity Site and Oscura Peak. Landing Zone 1 is definedas the crash site between Corona and Roswell. A third Landing Zone 3 is defined as 30miles east of Alamogordo near the Mescalero Apache Indian Reservation.

First reports indicated that thefirst crash investigators from Roswell AAF that LZ-1 was the remains of a AAF top secretMOGUL balloon project. When scientists from the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratoryarrived to inspect LZ-2, it became apparent to all concerned that what had crashed in thedesert was something out of this world.”IPU Intelligence Assessment, Page 2, Paragraph 4. Description of Humanoid Bodies Recoveredat LZ-2, White Sands Proving GroundFurther along in the IPU Intelligence Assessment, Paragraph 11 states: “As to the bodiesrecovered at LZ-2, it appeared that none of the five crew members survived entry into ouratmosphere due to unknown causes. DR. DETLEV BRONK has been asked to assist in theautopsy of one well preserved cadaver to be done by MAJOR CHARLES E. REA. Fromwhat descriptions the team was able to learn and from photographs taken by intelligencephotographers, the occupants appear in most respects human with some anatomicaldifferences in the head, eyes, hands and feet. They have a slight build about five feet tall,with grayish-pink skin color. They have no hair on their bodies and clothed with a tightfitting flight suit that appears to be fire proof (some of the bodies looked as if they hadbeen burned on head and hands). Their overall stature reminds one of young children. It isbelieved that there were male and female genders present, but was hard to distinguish."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"IPU Intelligence Assessment, Paragraph 11. “Bodies Disected (sic) As You Would A Frog”“The most disturbing aspect of this investigation was there were other bodies found not farfrom LZ-1 that looked as if they had been disected (sic) as you would a frog. It is notknown if army field surgeons had performed exploratory surgery on these bodies. Animalparts were reportedly discovered inside the craft at LZ-2 but this cannot be confirmed.The team has reserved judgement on this issue.” [Bold emphasis by Howe.]TOP SECRET ULTRA Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Summary IntelligenceAssessment, Paragraph 12, about dissected bodies found near crashed UFO at LandingZone-1 between Corona and Roswell and animal parts discovered inside thenon-human craft at Landing Zone-2, Trinity Site, White Sands Proving Ground, NM.The IPU document does not make clear what he type of dissected bodies were - human?animal? non-human? Apparently those “disected (sic) bodies” were found on the ground“not far from Landing Zone-1” at the Corona site. But whatever the dissected bodieswere, in addition to the discovery of animal parts inside the craft at the White SandsLanding Zone-2, that disturbing physical evidence must have scared President Truman andhis colleagues so badly that they all agreed a tight lid must be placed on UFOs.A policy of complete denial in the interest of national security was demanded while thePresident and his advisers tried to learn more and figure out what they were up against.Thus, the National Security Act of 1947 created the Central Intelligence Agency, theMajestic-12 Special Studies Group and presidential executive orders that requiredeveryone associated with the extraterrestrial investigation to deliberately lie to andmisinform the press and the public in order to prevent panic and sustain national security.

Eleven years before then in 1968, I had graduated from Stanford University with aMasters Degree in Communication in which I made documentaries at the Stanford MedicalCenter and the Stanford Linear Accelerator. Then I was hired by the NBC televisionaffiliate in Los Angeles to do news reporting and documentaries. Later I was hired byBoston's WCVB-TV (ABC) to produce medical and science programs that were honoredas part of the station's Peabody Award for programming excellence. After a family moveto Colorado, I was hired to be Director of Special Projects at the CBS television station inDenver, KMGH-TV. There I produced, wrote, directed, edited and reported documentaryfilms and live television studio programs about science, medical and environmental issues,which were honored with a national Emmy nomination, several regional Emmys, OhioState awards, Denver and Chicago Film Festivals best documentaries and other journalismawards.In the summer of 1979, dozens of animal mutilations were reported in Colorado again asthey had been periodically since the 1960s. I wanted to get to the bottom of what wascausing the unusual animal deaths and began an investigation which produced thedocumentary, A Strange Harvest, which received a 1981 regional Emmy. Linda Moulton Howe's A Strange Harvest hour television documentary received aregional Emmy in 1981. See Earthfiles Shop for more information.The bizarre, bloodless animal mutilations were not happening only in Colorado. Animalmutilations were occurring all over the United States, Canada and many other countries, allwith the same pattern of tissue removed from their bodies: an ear, an eye, a circle of flesharound the eye, half the jaw flesh, the tongue removed in a vertical cut deep within thethroat, as in this Sterling, Colorado, case back in the summer of 1976, and the mutilatedCaldwell, Kansas, cow in 1992."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Mutilated cow's head on the Budin ranchin Sterling, Colorado, 1976.

Also, theyellow arrow points at two missing teeth. This is a common characteristic of manymutilated cows, but not widely reported. Back in 1980 after my documentary, A StrangeHarvest, was first broadcast, I received a call from Lynn Lauber, head of the RoyalCanadian Mounted Police's (RCMP) animal mutilation investigation in Calgary, Alberta,Canada. He admitted to me that the common Calgary newspaper explanation of Sataniccults was not true, that he had no evidence. Further, he said many of the mutilated cattlethere had two teeth taken from either the upper or lower jaw, but he was keeping that factto himself in his investigations. I told him that Colorado law enforcement and I had alsotalked about missing teeth at mutilation sites and I agreed to keep that fact confidential aswell.Horses are often mutilated, such as the 14-year-old gelding below found June 22, 1993, byowner and horse raiser Doris Williams of New Raymer, Colorado.

Corso described many advanced technologies that the United Statesgovernment retrieved from crashed non-human aircraft and back-engineered. One of thosetechnologies, according to Col. Corso, was what came to be known as a laser scalpel inmodern Earth medicine. On Page 47 of his book, Col. Corso wrote: “Why did theextraterrestrial inhabitants of the craft have a cutting device like this aboard their ship? Itwasn't until later, when I read highly classified military reports of cattle mutilations inwhich entire organs were removed without any visible trauma to the surrounding celltissue, that I realized that the light-beam cutting torch...was being used by the aliens inmedical experiments on our livestock.”Graphic of laser scalpel surgery on eye.Before he died, Col. Corso talked to me in private about the many classified documents hehad seen in Washington, D. C., when he returned from his World War II assignment inItaly. He told me that he had read with his own eyes highly classified reports dated asearly as 1951 about animals found in several parts of the world with bloodless excisionsand no tracks around them, not even the dead animal's own tracks, implying the mutilatedanimal had been dropped to the ground from the air. Col. Corso said classified governmentreports he read specified that the animal mutilators were “extraterrestrial biologicalentities.”U. S. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso with Linda Moulton Howe at50th anniversary event in Roswell, New Mexico, July 4, 1997.Animal mutilations was such a sensitive and classified subject, Col. Corso told me, becausethe United States government was scared that if the public knew Something from outerspace was able to pick up heavy animals in beams of light, remove tissue and liquids withinstruments that cut with light and perhaps sound frequencies, then return the animals deadand mutilated to pastures - Americans, and the world, would panic.
