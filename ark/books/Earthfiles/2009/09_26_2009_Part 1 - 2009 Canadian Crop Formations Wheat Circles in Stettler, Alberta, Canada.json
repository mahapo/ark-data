Stettler is a small community ofabout 5,500 people who work on farms or in surveying and laying pipes for the oil and gasindustry.That early evening, Colby was spraying Roundup herbicide (a glyphosate product byMonsanto) to “desiccate” the wheat, to dry up greener plants to make the field uniformlydry for combine harvesting. Colby is 35-years-old, born and raised in Stettler and for thepast several years has been a crop sprayer. Colby recently explained to me the desiccationprocess and how he found the wheat circles.Interview:Colby Squires, Professional Crop Sprayer, Stettler, Alberta, Canada: “Desiccation isa practice of going into a wheat crop when it's still green and to ripen it up. We spray the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"crop with Roundup to even out the dryness. Basically, you’re killing the crop, is whatwe’re up to. Then a farmer can go in there and straight-cut the wheat. There are differentstages, depending on how risky you want to be. You can spray wheat fairly green withouthurting the seed. Lots of desiccation goes on in the fall here because we’re so far northand the growing season is so short. It’s a way to gain at least ten days – you can speedharvest up by about ten days if you desiccate.It became apparent to me at least 100 yards away from the formation that something wasnot quite right. I mean, I saw the wheat was down. As I got closer to it, I could see fromthe sprayer - you sit quite high, at least 16 feet above ground - so I was able to see downon the formation very clearly. When you’re spraying, you’re spraying at a fairly high rateof speed. So, it took me a couple of seconds to shut things down and I ended up sprayingright into the circles.DOES YOUR MACHINE DAMAGE WHEAT PLANTS?No, I have what are called crop dividers on the front of the sprayer, one in front of eachtire. What they do is divide the crop ahead of the tires, so you don’t really drive on muchcrop beyond where the sprayer lines go through 100 feet apart.DID YOU SHUT THE MOTOR OFF, GET OUT AND TAKE A LOOK?Yes, I shut things down, but I didn’t get out of the sprayer. I crawled on top and stood onthe roof. Then I phoned my wife, Toni, and told her to meet me and to bring her camerafor photographs. It was pretty interesting and she got some good photographs.FROM 16 FEET UP, YOU COULD HAVE SEEN ANY SMALL TRAILS IN THEWHEAT AROUND THE FORMATION?Oh, absolutely. The first thing we did was to see if any tracks went in and out and Icouldn’t see anything from atop the sprayer 16 feet off the ground. 7 PM MTN, August 25, 2009First Wheat Formation Images © 2009 by Toni SquiresStanding 16 Feet Up on Top of Spraying MachineStettler, Alberta, Canada"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Central ring measured 38 feet in diameter by Don Tash, retired Stettler high schoolscience teacher. Half of the central ring was widened by another layer of wheat flattenedin the opposite direction of the wheat in the main ring. Diagram by Don Tash to follow.But we didn't get off the sprayer because I was in a hurry and kept on spraying. Mysprayer tracks basically went right through the center of it and I carried right on to thehighway. So the next day, my wife and some friends were able to walk in my sprayertracks when they went back to look at it closer without damaging any of the crop.It’s very strange because the formation is in a field right beside a busy highway day and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"night in our area. But nobody has seen a thing. And I was the last guy in that field probablysix weeks before around July 10th doing an herbicide spray. I didn’t see any disruption ofthe crop then.COLBY, IS THERE ENOUGH AIRPLANE TRAFFIC OVER STETTLER THAT APILOT WOULD HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE AUGUST 25TH?That’s a good question. I think so, but we’re a pretty small town center, so I don’t knowfor sure. But you’d certainly think that someone would have said something if they hadseen it before August 25th.CAN YOU SEE THE FORMATION FROM THE BUSY ROAD?No, you can’t. The highway is several feet higher than the wheat field, but the formation isout there 500 to 600 yards away from the highway.EVEN THOUGH THE ROAD IS HIGHER, YOU STILL CAN’T SEE ANY OF THEFORMATION?Yeah, because the wheat is pretty tall. The wheat is probably 3.5 to 4 feet all, so it hides alot. And there was no signs of entry into that field. There was nothing like a path there thateven suggested there was anything to look at. It’s just a real nice, even-looking wheat field.No tracks into it at all.IN YOUR 20 YEARS OF WHEAT FARMING IN STETTLER, HAVE YOU HEARD OFSUCH A FORMATION BEFORE?No. This is a first for everyone around here. There are guys here who have been farming alot longer than I have and nobody has seen anything like that in Stettler before.” Afternoon of September 14, 2009(20 Days After Discovery)Images © 2009 by Ian Lamie, Red Deer, Alberta, ResidentTwenty-year-old Ian Lamie traveled with his family to the wheat formation after learningabout it from a TV news program the second week of September 2009, after the patternwas first reported by local media. Ian told me by phone that he was on his hands and kneesfollowing several wheat stems in the flattened circles and rings into the ground. “I couldnot find any creases, wrinkles or breaks where the stems went flat to the ground. It waslike the stem was kind of molded to the ground.” Unfortunately, he did not take anyclose-up images of that phenomenon.Crop specialist, Neil Whatley, of Stettler, also visited the formation early on and told mehe was amazed to see wheat stems neatly curved over 8-inch high old canola stubblewithout any creases, cracks or breaks. He did not photograph that anomaly either."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Continued in Part 2More Information:For further information about worldwide crop formations, please see EarthfilesArchive for reports (a few listed below) and my book Mysterious Lights & Crop Circlesin the Earthfiles Shop.• 08/18/2009 — Part 3: Silbury Hill “Quetzlcoatl Headdress” First Filmed At Dawn• 08/17/2009 — Part 2: Windmill Hill and West Overton After Rains• 08/12/2009 — Part 1: Windmill Hill Pattern Near Ancient Avebury Came in Rain• 08/05/2009 — Extraordinary Details in New Silbury Hill Formation Destroyed by Farmer• 08/03/2009 — \"Settlement\" Wheat Formation Inside Ancient Celtic Settlement• 07/31/2009 — Silver Disc Videotaped Near Barbury Castle• 07/31/2009 — Infrared Video of Light Flashes, Moving Darknesses - and Entity?• 07/30/2009 — Inside the 12-Armed Ogbourne St. George Wheat Formation"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"• 07/16/2009 — Part 2: Silbury Hill “Quetzlcoatl Headdress” and Mysterious Tall Blonds• 07/15/2009 — Part 1: Silbury Hill “Quetzlcoatl Headdress” and Mysterious Tall Blonds• 07/14/2009 — 2-Stage Cannings Cross Wheat Formation Scene of Farm Arrest• 07/12/2009 — Mysterious Aerial Lights Mimicking Stars in Texas and Oregon• 07/11/2009 — Update Podcast: Is Sudden Solar Intensity of July 5 - 7 What U.K. SpringCrop Formations Forecast for Oddly Quiet Sun?• 07/06/2009 — UK “Quetzalcoatl Headdress” and “Sixth Sun Tzolkin”?• 07/03/2009 — UK “Nazca Hummingbird” - Astronomical and Mayan Counting• 07/03/2009 — Part 3: “Alien Symbols” in Milk Hill and South Field• 07/02/2009 — Part 1: “Alien Symbols” in Milk Hill and South Field• 07/02/2009 — Part 2: “Alien Symbols” in Milk Hill and South Field• 06/09/2009 — Update Podcast: Aerial Lights That Mimic Stars, Helicopters and Airplanes• 05/12/2009 — Part 3: Astronomical Information in U.K. 2009 Crop Formations?• 05/10/2009 — Part 2: 800-Foot-Long Pattern in U.
