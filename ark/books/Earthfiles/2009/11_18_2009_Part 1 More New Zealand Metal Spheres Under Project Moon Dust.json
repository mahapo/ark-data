But four days later on April 3, 1972, the Venus 9 failed as it tried to move into the plannedVenus trajectory. At 1 AM on April 3, 1972, a farmer named John Lindores of Ashburton, NewZealand, reported that four red-hot, metallic balls about 38 centimeters in diameter (15 inches) landedon his farm near Ashburton. Two smaller spheres, a larger spacecraft piece and cylindrical structurewere found further south of John Lindores farm by other residents.In 2002, declassified New Zealand government files contained correspondence from Sir KeithHolyoake, New Zealand's Foreign Affairs Minister in 1972, who wrote that the spheres were “probablygas pressure vessels of a kind used in the launching rocket.” But the Soviets denied the New Zealandspace debris was theirs and the Americans did not have any craft with a re-entry path that would havegone over New Zealand.

It was turned over to the New Zealandpolice who in turn delivered it to the National Radiation Laboratory in Christchurch for a radioactivecheck (negative finding). The object has now been delivered to the DSIR (New Zealand Department ofScientific and Industrial Research) for detailed examination and analysis.“On November 5, 1978, a second ‘space ball’ was found by DSIE (Defense Security InformationExchange). R. O. believes that a U. S. techncal team would be welcome to examine the objects,although their R. O. has not discussed that possibility with any New Zealand authorities.”Included in the Defense Intelligence Agency's Moon Dust message was the following comment from theEmbassy Scientific attache:“The two spherical space objects and other apparent space debris, which were found in April 1972,were located in virtually the same area south of Ashburton. (The two 1972 impact areas wereapproximately 10.5 miles apart. The apparent 1978 impact area is about 5 miles south of both theprevious 1972 impact areas, forming a triangular pattern.)“The statistical likelihood of two separate spacecraft decaying in a way, which caused them to impactin virtually the same spot on the globe was considered to be so small as to make the 1978 objectssuspect. The suspicion was reinforced by advice from Lt. John Baker-Nunn Tracking Station that theyhad not been alerted to space craft decay during the October 23 to 24 period.“The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR)'s advice to the science officer November3, 1978, that the sphere was a silicon-aluminum alloy with a melting point of less than ??? degreescaused doubt that a space object with such a low melting point could survive re-entry in such asurprisingly complete condition, even if shielded (There are no evidences of shielding other than themagnetic spattering.)“The discovery of the second sphere on November 5, 1978, however, seems to increase the likelihoodthat the objects are indeed space fragments and, because the alfalfa field had been worked earlier thisyear, it would seem to eliminate the possibility that the spheres were connected with the 1972 findings.“Also, from the observation of the first ball, it was too clean inside and out to have been laying aboutsince 1972, or even for several months. (The New Zealand police say they did not clean the ball.) Theinterior of the ball is covered in a fine, light brown dust, which has not yet been analyzed. Through theholes in the sphere, the equatorial weld can be ovserved, and it is apparent the weld was external only.The weld bead did not penetrate the joint, and a fairly wide reach between the two hemispheres is observable. DSIR will continue to cooperate with full analysis information.

THIS SUSP ICION WAS REINFORCEDBY ADVICE FROM MT. JOHN BAKER-NUNN TRACKING STATION THAT THEY HAD NOTBEEN ALERTED TO SPACE CRAFT DECAY DURING THEOCTOBER 23-24 PERIOD. DSIR’S ADVICE TO THE SCIENCE OFFICER NOVEMBER 3 THATTHE SP HERE WAS A SILICON-ALUMINUM ALLOYWITH A MELTING POINT OF LESS THAN ??? DEGREES CAUSED DOUBTTHAT A SPACE OBJECT WITH SUCH A LOW MELTING P OINT COULDSURVIVE RE-ENTRY IN SUCH A SURPRISINGLY COMPLETE CONDITION,EVEN IF SHIELDED. (THERE ARE NO EVIDENCES OF SHIELDINGOTHER THAN THE MAGNETIC SPATTERING.) THE DISCOVERY OF THESECOND SPHERE ON NOVEMBER 5, HOWEVER, SEEMS TO INCREASE THELIKELIHOOD THAT THE OBJECTS ARE INDEED SPACE FRAGMENTS AND,BECAUSE THE ALFALFA FIELD HAD BEEN WORKED EARLIER THISYEAR, IT WOULD SEEM TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THESPHERES WERE CONNECTED WITH THE 1972 FINDINGS. ALSO, FROMTHE OBSERVATION OF THE FIRST BALL, IT WAS TOO CLEAN INSIDEAND OUT TO HAVE BEEN LAYING ABOUT SINCE 1972 OR EVEN FORSEVERAL MONTHS. (THE NZ POLICE SAY THEY DID NOT CLEAN THEBALL.)
