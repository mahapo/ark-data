Wood, Ph.D., Aerospace EngineerReturn to Part 1May 29, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Retired McDonnell-Douglas aerospaceengineer, Robert M. Wood, Ph.D., has intensely researched the SOM1-01 document thatfirst appeared as 35mm black and white negative film in a package addressed to DonBerliner of the Fund for UFO Research in Maryland. The package was postmarked March7, 1994 from LaCrosse, Wisconsin, and bore a return address of a pharmacy in LaCrosse.On the 35mm film were thirty-two pages of text and drawings and the fingers of whoeverphotographed the pages of the TOP SECRET/MAJIC classified manual.Bob Wood had a 43-year-long career as an aerospace engineer, first working for DouglasAircraft that merged with the McDonnell Corporation in 1967 to become McDonnell-Douglas, later purchased by Boeing in the early 1990s. Over those four decades, BobWood worked on aerodynamic heating, ballistic missile defense, radar, and the spacestation before his retirement in 1993. That year, nuclear physicist and UFO researcher,Stanton Friedman, had seen the 35mm negative in Berliner's possession and contacted Bobto see if he would be interested in researching what was on the film.Bob Wood agreed and a decade later says, “Basically what was on the 35mm negative is a32-page manual (including covers and blank pages) dated 1954 which describes for specialfield units how to recover crashed flying saucers, how to take them apart, how to packthem, where to ship them, how to take care of the bodies and how to keep the public in thedark.” Tri-X Film First Manufactured in 1954“The original 35mm negative was on Tri-X T-5063 film which was first made in 1954,which incidentally is the date of the document. So, it could have been photographed backthen, or it could have been photographed around 1994 or some time in between. The pagesthat were photographed actually show the fingers of the photographer as he wasphotographing. For awhile we thought some forensic analysis on those fingers mightidentify the photographer, but the image isn't very clear and we haven't followed up onthat.“The document itself in the photographs is really quite legible except for a few pages. Myinitial task was to figure out what does it say? After prints were made from the negativeand as soon as I started key stroking one page at a time, I thought, ‘Wow! This is aremarkable document!’ I've felt that way ever since.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"This TOP SECRET/MAJIC EYES ONLY warning is everyother page throughout the training manual."},{"pageNumber":16,"pageContent":"Continued in Part 4 - SOM1-01Return to Part 1Earthfiles would like to learn about other unidentified aerial triangle sightings similar tothe illustration in the SOM1-01 1954 training manual, what the Bales brothers saw andwhat flew over Belgium in March 1990.
