Volume I is entitled:The Devils and Evil Spirits of Babylonia: “Evil Spirits” ©1903and published by Luzac and Co., London. eturn to Updated Part 1August 14, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - To recap the timeline of communicationwith the Writers, their first floppy disc to me was dated June 21, 1994, contained threepages and is the subject of Part 1 in this Real X-Files series, now updated with anelectronic scan of the original June 21, 1994, disc print out, which includes an importantbook list. When I began this series on June 17, 2009, I scanned the Writers' first letter frommy published book Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness © 1998, whichhad been typeset for clarity. But recently, I compared my original and wrinkled 1994 discprint out with the retyped text in the book and discovered a paragraph was missing,apparently a typeset error. I have now replaced the first incorrect typeset scans used inPart 1 with electronic scans of the original floppy disc print out that includes the missingparagraph about the list of authorsand books given by the Writers as context for their NHE discussion.A month later, on July 16, 1994, I sent my first series of questions to the Writers, reprintedin Part 2.On August 16, 1994, I received the second floppy disc from the Writers that contained fivepages scanned and reprinted in Part 3."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"On November 3, 1994, I sent my second letter of questions and attached an allegedCentral Intelligence Agency (CIA) TOP SECRET photograph of a non-human infant withsuction cup fingers and enormous eyes containing vertical pupils reprinted in Part 4.Part 5 and Part 6 contain sections of draft pages from Glimpses, Vol. II, the book Iworked on between 1994 and February 1997, when I sent those draft pages to the Writersfor their comment.Back to November 1994, that was the month that Ray Boeche and the Writers hadcommunicated about possibly organizing a face-to-face meeting with me and the Writers.In anticipation of a meeting, I had spent time at the Temple University library trying totrack down the list of books the Writers gave me on Page 2 in their first June 21, 1994,letter:“Please refer to the works of the late Dr. Kurt Koch, works by C. FredDickason, Merrill Unger, Tal Brooke, and Dr. Neal Anderson [ sic - should beNeil] as good contemporary authorities, and for more historical backgroundconsult Reginald Thompson's The Devils and Evil Spirits of Babylonia;Edward Langton's Essentials of Demonology; Deacon & Walker's 1601 work,Diallogicall Discourses of Spirits and Devils, Declaring Their ProperEssence, and Emil Schneweis's Angels and Demons According to Lactantis.”[sic - should be Lactantius, reprinted in 1982 from the original 1944 scholarlymanuscript about studies in Christian antiquity concerning angels anddemonology.]At the library, I learned that Dr. Kurt Koch was a German theologian who wrotethirty-seven books about demonology. One entitled Occult ABC, Exposing OccultPractices and Ideologies, was translated from the original German edition, Satan'sDevices © 1978 and published under the new English title in 1980.C. Fred Dickason also wrote several books about demon possession, including Angels:Elect and Evil © 1995; Demon Possession and the Christian © 1989; and Names ofAngels © 1997.Merrill Unger has written more than forty books about the Christian Bible, Dead Seascrolls and others such as a recent 2007 release entitled What Demons Can Do to Saints.Tal Brooke (born Robert Taliaferro Brooke) is the chairperson of the Spiritual CounterfeitsProject, a Christian counter-cult organization. He is the author of several books includingthe 1990 publication, Lord of the Air: Tales of a Modern Antichrist.Dr. Neil T. Anderson is a former aerospace engineer with Apollo and is now an associateprofessor of practical theology at Talbot School of Theology in La Mirada, California. Dr.Anderson is also President of Freedom In Christ Ministries. His three most popular booksare Victory Over the Darkness © 1990; The Bondage Breaker © 1990/1993; andReleased from Bondage © 1991.What interested me most were the historic titles and at Temple University, I was able tocopy some of the 2-volume 1903 work by Reginald Campbell Thompson, M. A., Assistantin the Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities at the British Museum in London.Volume I is entitled: The Devils and Evil Spirits of Babylonia: “Evil Spirits” ©1903 andpublished by Luzac and Co., London. Volume II is subtitled, “Fever Sickness andHeadache, ETC.”Content in Real X-Files at Earthfiles.com is presented for consideration in a wide range ofphenomena and interpretations, not as proven fact."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Babylonian demons were sculpted as humanoid reptiles.In his Preface, Mr. Thompson writes about texts discovered from the reign of Assur-bani-apli (Akkadian), or Ashurbanipal, that are “tolerably accurate copies of the exorcismsand spells, which the Sumerian and his Babylonian successor employed, some six or seventhousand years ago, to avert the attacks of devils, and to ward off malign influences ofevery kind.”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"King of Assyria, Ashurbanipal, depicted in stone on a chariot during a royal lion huntduring his reign of 668 to 627 B. C.[ Editor's Note: AbsoluteAstronomy.com reports: “The Royal Library ofAshurbanipal, named after Ashurbanipal, the last great king of theNeo-Assyrian Empire, is a collection of thousands of clay tablets andfragments containing texts of all kinds from the 7th century BC. The materialswere found in the archaeological site of Kouyunjik (then ancient Nineveh,capital of Assyria) in northern Mesopotamia. The site would be found inmodern day Iraq. It is an archaeological discovery credited to Austen HenryLayard; most texts were taken to England and can now be found in the BritishMuseum, London.”Wikipedia reports: “The Library of Ashurbanipal at Ninevah is perhaps themost compelling discovery in the Ancient Near East. There have been over30,000 clay tablets uncovered in Ashurbanipal’s library, providingarchaeologists with an amazing wealth of Mesopotamian literary, religious andadministrative work. Among the findings was the Enuma Elish, also known asthe Epic of Creation, which depicts a traditional Babylonian view of creationwhere the god Marduk slays Tiamat, the personification of salt water, andcreates the world from her body. Then, man is created from the blood of arevolting god, Quingu, in order to toil on behalf of the gods.” ]Mr. Thompson asserted in his June 1, 1903 Preface that “a considerable proportion of themagical practices, which are in use in the East to the present day, were well known to theinhabitants of Mesopotamia several thousands of years ago, and that many of them wereborrowed by the Hebrews and other dwellers in Syria and Persia from their neighbours onthe Tigris and Euphrates (rivers). ... it has been confidently asserted that this documentcontains an allusion to the Biblical Garden of Eden. The text of this tablet mentions a"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"place called Eridu, and a plant or tree named kiskanu, or dense growth and shiningappearance, which grew beside the abyss; i.e., the Ocean or Sea. The place where theplant grew was said to be the couch of a god. ... some Assyriologists have asserted that theBabylonian Garden of Eden was in the immediate vicinity of Eridu, and they haveidentified the tree or plant with the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, which wasbelieved to grow in the Hebrew Paradise.”However, Mr. Thompson disagreed that the cuneiform describes a Garden of Eden nearEridu. He thought a newly discovered piece of missing cuneiform text showed thecontroversial text was only describing a particular plant for treating diseased patients, notthe Tree of Life.Mr. Thompson begins his introduction to his 1903 2-volume book this way: “From theearliest times Eastern races, in common with the rest of mankind, have always held a firmbelief in the existence of evil spirits, ghosts, and all kindred powers. ...the Semiterecognized 'gods' (singular, ILU; plural, ILANI).”In a footnote, Mr. Thompson explained that the original meaning of ILU is unknown. TheSumerians indicated the word ‘god’ by a star symbol carved in their cuneiform tablets.Mr. Thompson: “...we are therefore justified in assuming that the Sumerians believed thattheir gods inhabited the sky. ... the Semite seems to have had some idea that the soul orEKIMMU, literally ‘the thing which is snatched away,’ possessed supernatural powers, orat least an existence.”In a section of his Introduction entitled, “The Various Classes of Evil Spirits,” Mr.Thompson wrote: “ The primitive Sumerian recognized three distinct classes of evil spirit,all ready to torment the hapless wanderer. First came the disembodied human soul, whichcould find no rest, and so wandered up and down the face of the earth. Secondly, thegruesome spirits, which were half human and half demon. And thirdly, the fiends anddevils who were of the same nature as the gods, who rode on the noxious winds, orbrought storms and pestilence.” ontinued in Part 8.eturn to Updated Part 1or further reports about non-human entities, please see reports in the 1999 - 2009Earthfiles Archive (partial list below) and my books An Alien Harvest and the 2-volumeGlimpses of Other Realities in the Earthfiles Shop.• 07/19/2009 — Part 2: 1980 RAF Bentwaters Lights and Craft Were “Extraterrestrial InOrigin”• 07/17/2009 — Part 1: 1980 RAF Bentwaters Lights and Craft Were “Extraterrestrial InOrigin”• 07/14/2009 — Part 5: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 07/06/2009 — Part 4: Non-Human Entities (NHEs):• 06/25/2009 — Part 3: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 06/21/2009 — Part 2: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 06/17/2009 — Part 1: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 06/01/2009 — Part 10: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 05/26/2009 — Part 9: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 05/13/2009 — Part 8: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 05/05/2009 — Part 7: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 04/29/2009 — Part 6: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 04/21/2009 — Archive Reprint: Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell Says GovernmentsCovering Up E.
