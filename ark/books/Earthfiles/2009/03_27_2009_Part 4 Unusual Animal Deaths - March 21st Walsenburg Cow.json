But I don’t believe that either human or animalas I know them could accomplish this (mutilation).”- Jim Garren, Walsenburg RancherThree cattle mutilations discovered in southern Colorado between March 8and March 21, 2009. The three sites form a triangle (yellow circles) on the map startingwith We ston about a half-hour west of Trinidad, which was the 28-year-old cow foundMarch 8, and probably killed on night of March 6, 2009, because she was seen aliveMarch 6. Hoe hne is about 15 miles northeast of Trinidad, where 1-week-old calf wasfound eviscerated on morning of Tuesday, March 17, 2009, and known to be aliveMonday afternoon, March 16, 2009. Third mutilation, a ranch about 12.5 milessoutheast of Walse nburg (20 miles northwest of Hoehne) where 2.5-year-old heifer foundSaturday morning, March 21, after giving birth to male calf Friday night, March 20.2.5-year-old English Angus and French Gelbvieh heifer crossbreed gave birthto calf Friday, March 20, 2009, and was found dead under juniper tree with udder removedwithout blood or milk fluids visible next morning, in Walsenburg, Colorado.Image Sunday morning, March 22, 2009 © by Chuck Zukow ski.Return to Part 1Return to Part 2Return to Part 3 "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"March 27, 2009 Walsenburg, Colorado - Jim Garren is 70-years-old and retired fromhis CPA profession to full time ranching since 1993 on three ranches - two in southernColorado and one in Missouri. One of his Colorado ranches is twelve and a half milessoutheast of Walsenburg and only about twenty miles from Tom Miller's ranch in Hoehnewhere the 1-week-old calf was found bloodlessly eviscerated on March 17, 2009.Three days later on Friday, March 20, 2009, Jim Garren's ranch helper, Tim Meyers, waschecking on one of their 2.5-year-old heifers pregnant for the first time and late in givingbirth. Jim has been crossbreeding pure bred Angus bulls and French Gelbvieh cows toproduce a stronger, more muscular cow that has good marbling in its meat. The heifer wasa healthy 1100-pounds, one of his best crossbreeds and Jim Garren was eager to see herfirst calf.During Friday night, it now appears she gave birth, licked her new male calf clean and heprobably sucked his first colostrum “immune milk” that strengthens newborns. The motherhad him hide under a juniper tree, flat to the ground - perhaps because she wanted to grazefor more strength before returning to her newborn calf. Or perhaps, she sensed somethingdangerous.On Saturday morning, March 21, around 11 AM, Tim Meyers was feeding range cubes tothe herd and realized the special, pregnant cow was missing. He went looking for her andfound her dead. He called ranch owner Jim Garren in shock.Interview:Jim Garren, retired CPA and owner of ranch 12.5 miles southeast of Walsenburg and20 miles from Hoehne: “He said, ‘Her bag is missing!' And I said, ‘What?' He said, ‘Shedoesn't have a bag, but there isn't any blood!’ (laughs) Ted didn't understand that and Icouldn't either.So, we started making some calls. Tim called the sheriff in Las Animas County and herecommended we call the brand inspector. An hour or so later, the brand inspector joinedTim who took him to the site of the death. The two men looked all around the ground tosee if they could determine what might have happened. They could not find any tracks.They could not find any blood. They did not see any trauma on the cow.About 5 PM Saturday afternoon, March 21, 2009, they were walking circles around thearea where we found the cow and lo and behold, we found the baby calf hid out under atree. The calf had been cleaned up, which a cow does after birth. The placenta afterbirthwas not too far from the calf and had completely dried up. The calf was bawling and inapparent good health.So, Ted took the calf and we have some milk supplements we are able to give the calvesand he fed the newborn male. He’s eating it and to this day, he’s eating the heck out ofthat supplement and growing good. So, we believe from that, the calf had sucked themother and got his first colostrum (first “immune milk”), or else he would have died.So, we believe she had nursed the calf before her death and the mutilated mother wasfound about 50 yards away from where we found the calf.THAT MEANS THE COW GAVE BIRTH SOME TIME IN THE NIGHT FROM FRIDAY,MARCH 20, TO SATURDAY, MARCH 21, AND APPARENTLY LICKED THE CALFCLEAN AND FED HIM. THEN AFTER THAT, COMES THIS TERRIBLE THINGTHAT TAKES AWAY HER UDDER AND KILLS HER.That’s my supposition and I believe that to be right because of the attitude and ability ofthis calf. He is doing real good and you would not expect a calf that never got the firstcolostrum from the mother to do that well. No Unusual Tracks or Signs of StruggleAt Calf and Heifer SitesCOULD YOU DESCRIBE BOTH GROUND SCENES AROUND THE CALF ANDHEIFER?Well, where the calf was found, a few yards away from the calf, we found the afterbirththat the mother had sloughed off. We saw tracks of the mother cow. We didn’t see anyother tracks at all. The calf was more or less underneath a juniper tree. There was nodisturbance other than the afterbirth being close by. We did see one little spot of blood, but"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I think that’s where the cow had laid when she gave birth to the calf.THAT WAS CLOSE TO THE CALF UNDER THE JUNIPER TREE?Yes, pretty close. Not right in the same spot, but reasonably close. What I’m sayinghappened is that the calf was probably born there, was cleaned up there, and there wassome blood there from the mother – which is natural – and then I think the calf got up andnursed and I think the mother hid the calf underneath the branches of the juniper tree.Then around the mother, she was also under a juniper tree, although the branches wereabout three feet above her. The only blood I saw was a little on her hind leg that would beconsistent with her dropping, sloughing off, the afterbirth. It was dry and caked andnormally a cow will have some blood on her legs from that. Saturday Morning, March 21, 2009,Photos by RancherNo Evidence of Natural PredatorsAround where the udder had been removed, I could find no traces of blood at all. The cutswere just perfect. They were bigger than the actual udder would have been and they justcut the hide and pulled the udder out. What is left is just some tallow – she was a good, fatheifer – and some raw meat (muscle). But none of that has been cut! Her stomach hadnever been torn open. Her rectum had not been torn open.2.5-year-old English Angus and French Gelbvieh heifer crossbreed as she was foundbeneath a juniper tree with udder bloodlessly removed, vaginal tissues reddened andexpanded from having given birth earlier Friday night, March 20, 2009, to male calf.Image Saturday morning, March 21, 2009 © 2009 by rancher Jim Garren.Ranch manager Tim Meyers holds rear right leg of heifer up so ranch owner Jim Garren"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"could photograph bloodless hole where udder was removed.

I could not see where her feet had moved the ground inany fashion. She was laying on her left side and her feet/legs were sticking straight outfront and back. Under a normal tranquilization or attack, a cow will move her feet beforeshe goes under. Nothing! I could not see any sign she ever moved her feet at all.Tongue, eyes and ears intact on 2.5-year-old English Angus and FrenchGelbvieh heifer crossbreed. Image Sunday morning,March 22, 2009 © by Chuck Zukowski.We felt all over her. We couldn’t feel any holes or outside entry points (for bullets) toindicate she had been shot, but I don’t believe there is a human alive that could cut thatudder off that cleanly without spilling some blood.ESPECIALLY IF SHE WAS PREGNANT AND HAD JUST GIVEN BIRTH AND THATUDDER SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENGORGED WITH MILK AND BLOOD.The udder would have been plumb full of milk.AND THERE WAS NO FLUID?No fluid. There was not a wet spot on the ground. We circled all around looking foranything we could find, like a bare spot where grass had been killed or whatever. We madeseveral circles around at least as far as 50 yards out because we went that far where wefound the calf. There were four of us doing that and no one has seen any tracks oranything other than cow tracks.

I WONDERED IF EVEN THAT IS NORMAL THAT BIRDS OR OTHERPREDATORS HAVE NOT REALLY DONE ANYTHING TO HER BODY SINCEFRIDAY NIGHT?Well, my experience with dead cows – and we have had some in the past with poisonweeds. My experience is that shortly after they die, the crows will peck their eyes out anda coyote will tear out the rectum. Now, as of Saturday evening (March 21, 2009), none ofthat had happened.We went back out there on Sunday, March 22, 2009, about 9:30 AM, and the right eyewas still intact (cow was laying on left side with right side of face skyward). That tells mecrows never got on her. But, a coyote had eaten out her rectum. So, there was a prettygood hole in there on Sunday. It was not there on the first photographs that we took onSaturday, the rectal skin had not been broken.Foreground disturbance after coyote ate rectal and vaginal tissues out betweenSaturday night, March 21, 2009, and Sunday morning, March 22, 2009, by 9:30 AM.Image on March 22 © 2009 by Chuck Zukow ski. Why the Mutilator's FocusOn Mother and Not Calf?THE MOTHER IS LYING 50 YARDS AWAY FROM HER NEWBORN ON HER LEFTSIDE WITH NO APPARENT SIGNS OF STRUGGLE, NO TRACKS, NO BLOODAROUND THE EXCISIOIN OF THE BIG UDDER THAT WOULD HAVE BEENENGORGED WITH MILK AND BLOOD. MY QUESTION IS: WHATEVER CAME"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"FOR THE MOTHER, WHY WOULDN’T IT HAVE GONE AFTER THE NEWBORNCALF AS WELL?I can’t answer that. It puzzled us, too, except that I’ve observed over the years that when acow – particularly after she has just had a calf and the calf has had its first nursing – willdo what we call ‘hide a calf.’ The mother cow will pick a spot and the calf will lay downand the calf will not raise its head, it will not move. It virtually is invisible. That’s thenature of the cow and that’s the way we found the newborn calf.The way we found him actually was that Tim’s wife heard it bawl and I suspect it wasgetting hungry and was bawling for the mother, which under normal circumstances, after acalf has eaten, it won’t bawl, it won’t move, it will just lay as flush to the ground as it canlay. That’s the nature of the mother cow protecting the newborn calf. Normally, themother will stay pretty close to the newborn and she usually will get some help fromanother cow to baby sit when she needs to go get some water and that sort of thing. Howthe cows communicate all of that, I can’t tell you, but that’s what we have observed.Maybe the cow was possibly out away from the calf grazing when her death occurred.IS THIS YOUR FIRST MUTILATION ON THIS PARTICULAR RANCH SOUTH OFWA L SE N B UR G ?Ye s .HAD YOU EVER HAD ANIMAL MUTILATIONS ANYWHERE ELSE YOU HAVERANCHED?No, I have not. This was my first.WHAT IS YOUR REACTION?Well, I’m sickened because I put in a lot of effort to raise these particular heifers throughthe genetics I am using to grow them and I have some theories that I’ve exercised abouthow fast I breed them. And this mother cow was just perfect, all ten of the special cowswere just perfect. I just hate like heck to lose one like that!Her calf was approximately 80 pounds and he was just in super health and super strong forjust being as young as he was. That’s the way all of these heifers calves are. So, I’m havinggreat expectations for the production of this animal I’m developing, so I’m very sad that Ilost her.WHAT WAS HER ESTIMATED WEIGHT AT DEATH?When she was preg-checked on October 21, 2008, she weighed 1,070 pounds. So, I’mguessing that at the time of her death, she weighed about 1100 pounds. The combination ofthe cow and calf were worth at least $1,250. She was a very classy-looking cow. But Ican't afford mortality insurance, so it's pure loss. Who? or What? Killed and MutilatedWalsenburg Heifer?“I think it’s something extraterrestrial.That’s all I can assume it could be – whether it’s a little greenman or what, I don’t know. But I don’t believe that either humanor animal as I know them could accomplishthis (mutilation).” - Jim Garren, RancherMy own impression today is that the cutting off of the udder, I don’t believe there is ahuman alive that could cut it that cleanly and not cause some blood to flow. I just don’tthink it’s possible.A second observation I had was that I don’t see how an animal or human could cause thatcow to die as big and strong and young as she was without tearing up, or having somemarks visible on the ground. I don’t believe there is a man or horse alive that could haveroped her and made her go down without showing some signs of the struggle.I certainly don’t believe it was an animal because we have lost cattle – mostly calves tolions – and to what we believe were coyotes – and in all cases, meat was eaten, the lion ateinto the calf stomachs to get its dinner and the coyotes go through the rectum to get totheirs. None of that was on my cow on Saturday. So, I have to eliminate animals as I knowwhat they do and I’ve kind of got to eliminate man because I don’t think there is any waythat could happen. We don’t have any electricity on the ranch. There are no signs ortracks. We’re so remote, it would have been virtually impossible for someone to have"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"walked to where this happened.

Beam Technology?Greeley Tribune, Greeley, Colorado, Sunday,November 2, 1980, article by Bill Jackson, Tribune Staff Writer,entitled: “Mutilations - Predators ... or UFOs? What's the answer?”EYEWITNESSES HAVE DESCRIBED SEEING BEAMS COME DOWN FROM THESKY INTO PASTURES – AND I HAVE HALF A DOZEN EYEWITNESSES WHO SAYTHEY HAVE SEEN ANIMALS RISE IN THESE BEAMS AND OTHERS HAVE SEENANIMALS DROPPED TO THE GROUND FROM THE BEAMS, OR PLACED ON THEGROUND BY THESE BEAMS. WHAT IS THIS BEAM TECHNOLOGY, I DON’TKNOW, BUT THE BEAM TECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THEANIMAL MUTILATION PHENOMENON AROUND THE WORLD FOR AT LEASTHALF A CENTURY.THAT WOULD AT LEAST EXPLAIN HOW YOUR WONDERFUL COW MIGHTHAVE BEEN SELECTIVELY TAKEN VERTICALLY FROM THE PASTURE ANDTHEN RETURNED VERTICALLY.Yeah, that would explain why we don’t see any tracks or signs. Of course, if the surgerywas done somewhere other than where she was at (when taken), that would explain whywe don’t see any blood.RIGHT.I’ve talked with some of the neighbors and Tim has talked to quite a few of our neighbors.I have a couple of partners that partner on some cattle with me and I’ve talked with them.And I’ve talked with some veterinarians.Really, no one has a clue! (laughs) They just say, ‘I can’t believe it.’DOES ANYBODY BRING UP THE POSSIBILITY OF SOMETHING FROM OUTERSPACE?Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Most of them say it’s got to be something that we don’t know whatit’s about.WHEN PEOPLE SPECULATE AND CONTEMPLATE SOMETHINGEXTRATERRESTRIAL FROM OUTER SPACE, WHAT DO THEY SAY TO YOU?Basically, they say it’s technologically above our ability to understand it and shrug theirshoulders and say, ‘I don’t understand it, but it has to be something like that that couldaccomplish what happened without leaving any signs or traces.’HAVE ANY OF YOUR NEIGHBOR AROUND YOUR RANCH SOUTH OFWALSENBURG HAD ANY ANIMAL MUTILATIONS IN THE LAST YEAR OR TWO?The closest one would be this Tom Miller that you’re talking about.IN HOEHNE, COLORADO."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Yes, Hoehne is probably 20 miles from our ranch.
