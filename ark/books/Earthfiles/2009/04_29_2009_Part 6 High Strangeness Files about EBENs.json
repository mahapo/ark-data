B. Darrach, Jr., and Robert Ginna,LIFE Magazine, April 7, 1952Return to Part 1April 29, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuing in Part 6 with Linda Moulton Howe's1983 to 1987 High Strangeness file notes about EBENs and other non-human entities.More miscellaneous notes about the Cimarron, New Mexico, abduction case of the mother andson who stopped car near pasture where two humanoids had a cow down in a pasture.[ See 040809 Earthfiles and An Alien Harvest in Earthfiles Shop has full Cimarron casehypnosis transcript. ]An Albuquerque man (medical doctor?) named Fitzpatrick did the first hypnosis session with theCimarron, New Mexico, mother and her 6-year-old son because she had a vaginal infection thatwas overwhelming any treatment he gave her. The mother named Myrna told the doctor aboutthe Cimarron encounter and her conviction that she was contaminated by the non-humans whohad invaded her body with some kind of instruments that had really hurt her.She told the doctor that she and her young son were driving in pastureland outside Cimarron inthe first week of May 1980, when she heard a cow “scream” loudly. She stopped the car and gotout. Then she and her son could see “strange humanoid creatures” around the cow in the pasturethat sounded scared and in pain.Next thing Myrna and her son knew, they were in some kind of shaft going underground into abase where she saw cow parts in tubes of liquid and tall and small non-humans working together- among our military? People dressed in military uniforms?Fitzpatrick said that Myrna had multiple implants in her from the non-humans. Fitzpatrick toldHoward Burgess (engineer at Sandia Laboratories in Albuquerque who has researched animalmutilations) that he took needles out of Cimarron woman and “metal stuff” was found in hervaginal area. Paul Bennewitz decided to help Myrna move away from New Mexico to Californiato help protect her and her son from further alien abductions. Paul Bennewitz says thenon-humans use blood to feed genetically created humanoids - controlled androids for placementamong Earth humans?Have had a discussion with a source about whether the non-humans can literally “see throughhuman eyes and minds”? It was suggested that the non-humans have the ability to projectthemselves into humans to see what it looks like to drive a car, fly a plane or other Earth humanactivities. But how does the projection work? And what is the connection to geneticmanipulation to create human-looking androids to do work for non-humans on this planet?What does American military and government know about human androids and possible link togenetic harvest in global animal mutilations? One rancher east of Colorado Springs in early 1983reported that where he had a mutilation of one of his cattle, he saw two men approaching thedead animal and reportedly learned the two were from NORAD inside Cheyenne Mountain!Howard Burgess said a man named Richard Caudell told him that two USAF pilots wereexchanged with non-humans and on the non-human planet, one pilot got very sick and one died.Also, a Midwestern investigator of the human abduction syndrome claims she was told there wasan exchange of American military and one or more EBENs - like the end of Steven Spielberg's1977 movie, Close Encounters of the Third Kind. An abductee told the investigator that a fewAmericans (from USAF?) were taken to a planet called “Estus 3”where non-humans and Earthhumans now work together. Is that the EBEN planet orbiting Zeta Reticuli 1 or Zeta Reticuli 2?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Citizens Against UFO Secrecy (CAUS) investigator and Connecticut policeman, Larry Fawcett,said a man who worked for the National Security Agency (NSA) at Fort Meade, Maryland, toldattorney Peter Gersten that during Apollo 14 (third NASA moon landing) that astronauts tookpictures of discs on the mon. NSA guy also sounds frightened and said he would be literallykilled, murdered, terminated, if he was caught talking. So why is he talking to an attorney with ahigh public profile?[Editor's Note: By the mid-1970s, American citizens were filing requests forinformation through the recent Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). By 1978,CAUS attorney, Peter Gersten, filed FOIA requests for UFO documents in the CIAand National Security Agency (NSA) and received confirmations from both agenciesthat there were UFO files. After a U. S. District Court in Houston ruled that 135UFO documents held by the CIA and NSA should not be released under FOIA onnational security grounds, in 1980, Gersten appealed to the U. S. Supreme Court.From a confidential in camera session, mostly blacked out pages were finallyreleased to Gersten and CAUS. ] Kelley Green Fireballs - Released from UFOs?I was told in 1983 that UFOs were the sources of kelley green fireballs that Lincoln LaPaz,Ph.D., University of New Mexico astronomer, studied in New Mexico for the U. S. Air Forcefrom 1948 through the 1950s. If so, what do the kelley green fireballs do? Alien waste disposal inEarth's atmosphere? “Meteorite” cover for surface landing of androids and/or technologies?Other?Wikipedia reports that Dr. LaPaz had a green fireball sighting himself on December 12, 1948,that was simultaneous with another eyewitness sighting of a green fireball over Los Alamos. Thatenabled Dr. LaPaz “to perform a triangulation. This showed the object's path was directly overthe very sensitive Los Alamos Laboratory.“In a classified letter to the Air Force on December 20, 1948, Dr. LaPaz wrote that the objectmoved far too slowly to have been a meteor and left no ‘trail of sparks or dust cloud’ as wouldbe typical of meteors flying at low altitudes. Other anomalous characteristics were the intenselime-green color, low altitude of only 8–10 miles and yet exhibiting no sound, flat rather thanarced trajectory, and turning on and off like a light switch.“Investigating many other green fireball sightings, LaPaz reached similar conclusions anddecided they were probably artificial in origin, perhaps Russian spy devices. LaPaz's greenfireball investigations were also mentioned in a 1952 LIFE magazine article, and his wife alsomade a painting of a green fireball.”Painting by Mrs. Lincoln LaPaz, who along with her familyon July 10, 1947, had their own UFO sighting. Painting publishedin LIFE Magazine, April 7, 1952."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Upper right headline: “There Is A Case for Interplanetary Saucers,”includes information about Lincoln LaPaz's study of green fireballs thoughtto be intelligently designed, Life magazine, April 7, 1952.Howard Burgess said that the kelley green fireballs were also involved in January 1983 eventssurrounding the alleged crash of an aerial disc in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, that had bodies init. A big helicopter was allegedly seen lifting wreckage out of Chaco Canyon. The local sheriff'sfirst phone call was supposed to have been to the FBI. And supposedly the FBI also gave a tollfree phone number to Lou Girodo in 1975 when Lou was Chief Investigator for the DistrictAttorney's Office in Trinidad, Colorado.Walt Harriman, a park superintendent at the time in Chaco Canyon, told one investigator thatwhatever it was that came down out of the sky “shook the hell out of them with a bigpercussion.” Residents in the area said some houses were knocked off their cinder blockfoundations and windows were shattered.[ Editor's Note: Chaco Canyon and Gallup history on pages 239-240, Secrets of theMysterious Valley © 2007 by Christopher O'Brien, quotes a January 13, 1983,newspaper article in the Farmington, New Mexico Daily Times that was headlined,“Good Gracious - Great Ball of Fire” by reporter, Rex Graham.Loud sonic booms that shook houses were reported from Gallup, New Mexico (lower left yellowcircle) to Chaco Canyon, Farmington, Bloomfield, Aztec, Dulce, and Chama on Wednesdayabout 5:50 p.m., January 12, 1983. The larger cities of Los Alamosand Santa Fe are in map's lower right.What investigators believe was a meteor smashed into the side of amountain about fifteen miles east of Gallup on Wednesday night about5:50 p.m., starting a fire and causing a deluge of calls to the McKinleyCounty Sheriff's Office. The incident is believed to be part of a broad"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"“meteor shower” that caused sonic booms in Gallup, Farmington,Aztec, Bloomfield and north to at least Durango, Colorado. McKinleyCounty Sheriff Benny Padilla said today that his office had receivedone hundred and twenty-six calls after as many as seven “booms” wereheard by area residents beginning at 5:50 p.m. and continuing untilabout 8:00 p.m.Undersheriff Jack Graham quickly drove east of Gallup to investigate afire burning on a hillside in the Springstead area, thought to beconnected with the “ explosion-like noises.” Padilla and Graham walkedthrough an empty crater about five feet across and six inches deep.There was no sign of plane wreckage.Then, about 10:00 p.m., Padilla and Gallup Police Chief FrankGonzales were driving in the area when they saw a “green-object”traveling toward the ground. “It looked like a fireball,” Padilla saidtoday, “and it disintegrated before it hit the ground; it was kinda scary.”... McKinley County Sheriff Benny Padilla said the noises aroundGallup ceased about 8:00 p.m. At about 10:00 p.m., Graham, Padillaand other law enforcement officials saw a “green fireball” swing acrossthe sky for about fifteen seconds, then disappear. This time, there wasno sound as the meteor vanished. Residents in the Farmington areareported seeing a similar glowing object in the sky. To many, the booms,meteor sighting and explosion and fire seemed part of the samephenomenon.Not far from Chama and Chaco Canyon is Dulce, New Mexico, notorious for rumors aboutunderground levels occupied by non-humans in which biological experiments with Earth life arecarried out for unknown purposes. Back in the mid-1970s, the owner of the Chama Land andCattle Co. allegedly told a Dulce State Patrol officer, “The lights people are seeing around hereare coming from that hill up there (on Jicarilla Apache reservation).” The hill he pointed to wasnorthwest of Dulce about fives miles from the Manuel Gomez ranch where a dozen cattlemutilations occurred over a year's time around 1978. The hill is referred to variously asArchuleta Mesa, Archuleta Mountain or Mt. Archuleta.Is there a Defense Special Missile and Aeronautics Center (DSMAC) in the region?
