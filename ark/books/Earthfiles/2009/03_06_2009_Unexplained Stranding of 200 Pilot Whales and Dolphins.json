March 2, 2009“One of the biggest mass beachings in Australia, 200 pilotwhales came ashore on King Island on Sunday evening, March 1,only 54 of which are still alive. Among the whales are a number ofdolphins, according to Chris Arthur, from Tasmania's Parks andWildlife. Around 150 local people are helping parks officials intrying to refloat the whales from a Naracoopa beach and shepherdthem back to sea, where a large number of whales were stillmilling in a pod.” March 6, 2009 Newport, Oregon - Scientists who study whales and dolphins are puzzledabout repeated strandings of large numbers of pilot whales – which are actually largedolphins – and other dolphins and sperm whales on or around King Island north of theAustralian state, Tasmania. There was also highly strange – perhaps unprecedentedbehavior – in Manila Bay, Philippines, last month on February 10, 2009, when 500 melon-headed dolphins filled Manila Bay and swam back and forth as if completely disoriented.Whales, dolphins and porpoises are also known as cetaceans. All cetaceans are mammalsthat once lived on land some 50 to 60 million years ago. In fact, their closest living geneticrelatives are hippopotamuses.Hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius)."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Stranded, dead long fin pilot whale whose ancestor was the hippopotamusabout fifty million years ago before cetaceans moved fromland into the world's oceans and rivers.Something made cetacean ancestors leave land for the seas -- and now whales, dolphinsand porpoises live in the oceans, rivers and seas. But because they are mammals, they stillmust breath oxygen into their lungs. That's what the blow holes are for on top of theirheads. As deep as some whales dive, within an hour or two, the big creatures must swimback to the surface to breathe. Like mammals, cetaceans also give birth to live young – butunderwater.Whales use a form of sonar called echolocation to locate and identify objects around them.It's also thought that whales use the Earth's magnetic fields to help navigate.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Echolocation, also called biosonar, is thebiological sonar used by several animals such as dolphins, shrews, most bats,and most whales. Echolocating animals emit calls out to the environment andlisten to the echoes of those calls that return from various objects in theenvironment. They use these echoes to locate, range, and identify the objects.Echolocation is used for navigation and for foraging (or hunting) in variousenvironments.“Echolocation works like active sonar, using sounds made by an animal.Ranging is done by measuring the time delay between the animal's own soundemission and any echoes that return from the environment. Echolocatinganimals have two ears positioned slightly apart. The echoes returning to thetwo ears arrive at different times and at different loudness levels, depending onthe position of the object generating the echoes. The time and loudnessdifferences are used by the animals to perceive direction. With echolocationthe bat or other animal can see not only where it is going, but can also see howbig another animal is, what kind of animal it is, and other features as well.” ]Whales and dolphins generally live between 40 and 90 years and species such as spermwhales grow up in close family pods that travel and hunt together all their lives.Unlike those tight whale and dolphin families, porpoises are more individual and less group-dependent. That difference might be one of the reasons why whales and dolphins strandthemselves on beaches, while usually porpoises do not. One unanswered scientific questionis: Do healthy whales and dolphins follow a family matriarch leader on to beaches forunknown reasons – even when beaching can mean death for some, or all, of the familypod?Another proven cause of cetacean beachings is military sonar. Mark Simmonds of theWhale and Dolphin Conservation Society and an expert on cetacean strandings said aboutthe King Island beachings that two species coming ashore together - pilot whales andbottle-nosed dolphins - aroused his suspicion that military sonar might have been involved.“To get more than one species is unusual. When you do, you get more suspicious because itmeans that the two species might have been driven by something. It does make us worried.We are certainly going to call for a very thorough investigation.”This week I talked with a whale expert about that most recent March 2, 2009, mysteriousdolphin strandings on King Island and the previous three dolphin and sperm whalestrandings around King Island north of Tasmania. He is Scott Baker, Ph.D., AssociateDirector of the Marine Mammal Institute at Oregon State University and Adjunct Professorof Molecular Ecology and Evolution at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. Dr.Baker received his Ph.D. in zoology with a study of humpback whales in southeast Alaskaand Hawaii. He is also puzzled about the recent, repeated strandings."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Interview:Scott Baker, Ph.D., holding skull of a new beakedwhale species he discovered with DNA at Oregon StateUniversity's Marine Mammal Institute, Newport, Oregon.C. Scott Baker, Ph.D., Adjunct Professor, Molecular Ecology and Evolution,University of Auckland, New Zealand, and Associate Director, Marine MammalInstitute, Oregon State University, Newport, Oregon: “Tasmania has had a series ofstrandings over the last few months, beginning in November 2008, about four months ago.They had 60 pilot whales strand on Anthony Beach, which is on the western edge ofnorthern Tasmania – not far from King Island.Then on November 29, 2008, another 150 stranded again in a similar area. Unfortunately,in that second very large stranding, all the animals died. In January 2009, there was astranding of about 50 sperm whales – again, in a very similar area – and they all died. It’svery difficult to attempt rescue on such large animals. And then most recently on March 2,2009, a group of nearly 200 pilot whales and a small number of bottle-nosed dolphinsstranded again on a nearby area of King Island, which is in Bass Strait near the northerncoast of Tasmania.King Island (red circle) is in the Bass Strait between northern Tasmania,an Australian state, and Melbourne, Australia.And the local residents were able to rescue about 40 pilot whales and a half dozenbottle-nosed dolphins. This is a little unusual having four strandings, mostly involving sucha large number of animals.WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSIONAL GUESS, GIVEN YOUR LONG CAREER WITHCETACEANS, ABOUT WHAT IS GOING ON?Well, I think it’s fair to admit that we have no agreed scientific explanation for these kindsof mass strandings. But it is important to realize that first, these are highly social animals.That’s what characterizes these mass strandings from other sorts of strandings of singleindividuals. So, these kinds of mass strandings do not occur with baleen whales such ashumpback whales or grey whales or blues or fin whales. Those animals might strand, butonly as individuals."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The mass strandings in large numbers are only the highly social species, like Long-finnedpilot whales [ technically a species of dolphins, not whales] and sperm whales. It’s alsothought that these animals associate around matriarchs, that they have what is called a‘matrilineal society.’ So in some cases, male and female offspring of a mother might remainwith the pod all their lives. That give us social cohesion or social bond that is thought to bevery important in probably initiating the stranding events.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “A matrilineal is a line of descent from a femaleancestor to a descendant (of either sex) in which the individuals in allintervening generations are female. In a matrilineal descent system (sometimespopularly called uterine descent), an individual is considered to belong to thesame descent group as her or his mother. This is in contrast to the morecommon modern pattern of patrilineal descent. The uterine ancestry of anindividual is a person's pure female ancestry, i.e. a matriline leading from afemale ancestor to that individual.]But what causes the strandings? That’s has really not been possible to determine so far, butthere are a number of reasonable theories. One that I think has been generally accepted forthe last few decades is that the whales move into these shallow areas, like a shallow,sloping sandy beach, and their sonar becomes confused because the sonar bounces off theshallow slope and does not return to them, so the animals think they are in deep water,when in fact, they are moving into shallow areas and then they become trapped.BUT WHALES LEFT LAND ABOUT 60 MILLION YEARS AGO, IF I UNDERSTANDTHE LITERATURE CORRECTLY?That’s correct, yes, about 60 million years ago.OK, AND YOU WOULD THINK THAT IN 60 MILLION YEARS THAT THIS LARGEANIMAL EVOLVING IN THE OCEANS WOULD NOT BE VULNERABLE TOSOMETHING LIKE ECHOLOCATION BEING FOULED UP BY APPROACHINGCLOSE TO SHORE.Well, all animals – just like humans – make mistakes. (laughs) You know, we’re seeing aneconomic mass stranding occurring here in the U. S. Social animals – part of the cost ofsociality is group thinking and that leads to stampedes and it leads to stock market crashes.I think that is a component of this stranding phenomenon.These are very sophisticated animals with very sophisticated sonar, but anyone can make amistake.FOUR MASS STRANDINGS IN FOUR MONTHS SUGGESTS THAT SOMETHINGMIGHT BE GOING ON. I’M CURIOUS IF YOU HAVE SEEN LAB RESULTS FROMNECROPSIES ON THE KING ISLAND STRANDED ANIMALS YET?No, I don’t think there has been time for that. And typically, necropsies have not shownanything. I’m not aware of any mass stranding in Australia or New Zealand – and therehave been many of them – where necropsy results suggested that there was widespreadillness among the individuals. Most of them appear to be healthy. Now, that’s not to saythat one of the individuals is not sick and that might be a key individual (matriarchalleader), but it has been very difficult to determine that. There were nearly 200 individualsin this most recent mass stranding in which 150 died. It would be impossible be to dodetailed necropsies on all of them. So, if one of them was the key matriarch and thatindividual was sick, unfortunately we only have a fairly low probability of detecting that. Military Sonar Linked to Some Cetacean StrandingsI HAVE AN ARTICLE IN FRONT OF ME FROM WIKIPEDIA ABOUT THE HISTORYOF BEACHED CETACEANS THAT BEGINS THIS WAY: ‘Another means by which Naval sonar could be hurting whales is a form ofdecompression sickness. This was first raised by pathological examinationafter fourteen beaked whales stranded in the Canary Islands. The strandinghappened on September 24, 2002, close to the operating area of Neo Tapon(an international naval exercise) for about four hours after the activation ofmid-frequency sonar. The team of scientists found acute tissue damage fromgas-bubble lesions, which are indicative of decompressions sickness. Theprecise mechanism of how sonar causes bubble formation is not fully known.It could be due to whales panicking and surfacing too rapidly in an attempt toescape the sonar pulses.”"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “There is evidence that very loudnoise from anti-submarine warfare sonar may hurt whales andlead to their beaching. On numerous occasions whales have beenstranded shortly after military sonar was active in the area,suggesting a link. Reasons as to how sonar may cause whaledeaths have also been put forward by scientists after necropsiesfound internal injuries in stranded whales. In contrast, whalesstranded due to seemingly natural causes are usually healthy priorto beaching.It has been argued that the very loud rapid pressure changes madeby sonar can cause hemorrhaging. Evidence emerged after thebeachings of seventeen whales and a dolphin in the Bahamas inMarch 2000 following a United States Navy sonar exercise. TheNavy accepted blame in this Joint Interim Report which found thedead whales to have experienced acoustically-inducedhemorrhages around the ears. The resulting disorientationprobably led to the stranding.” ]COULD THERE BE SOME SECRET MILITARY OPERATION GOING ON AROUNDKING ISLAND NORTH OF TASMANIA AND THE ONLY WAY TO CONFIRM THATWOULD BE NECROPSIES ON ALL THE AVAILABLE DEAD BODIES?Well, the decompression hypothesis is pretty well established now in cases where it appearsthe effects are response to the Navy mid-range sonar. You’re right, that description is quiteaccurate. The sound is apparently stampeding the animals into a shallow area and then theanimals are pushed up into shallow depths where they have not had time to decompress.Now, this came as a bit of a surprise to a lot of biologists involved in the study of marineanimals because we had long assumed that cetaceans – whales and dolphins – had someform of natural protection against the ‘bends.’[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “Bends, decompression sickness, the diver’sdisease, caisson disease, are all names given to a variety of symptoms sufferedby a person exposed to a decrease (nearly always after a big increase) in thepressure around the body. The body must adapt to the pressure following arapid ascent. It is a type of diving hazard and dysbarism. The surfacing divermust enter a recompression chamber to avoid the bends. Decompressionsickness is caused by excess inert gases such as nitrogen, which have dissolvedin body liquids and tissues while the gas was being inhaled at higher pressure.”The excess inert gases come out of physical solution as the pressure reducesand form gas bubbles within the human body - or cetaceans exposed tomilitary sonar, probably because the animals try to rush upward away from thesonar too quickly.]But it turns out that might not have been entirely correct, that if they are deep divinganimals such as pilot and sperm whales and beak whales, if they are suddenly driven up toshallow water where they can't perform a series of semi-decompression dives to moderatedepths, then they could suffer the bends.Now, I would also admit that if it is a military operation, whether we can obtain thatinformation, I can’t be absolutely sure of that. But I can be quite sure that there will be anattempt to obtain that information. Certainly, military operations are a potential and therehave been places where there have been quite a direct correlation - almost certainly acausal mechanism involved in strandings. But mass strandings of pilot whales have beengoing on since the time of Aristotle. He commented on them in the Mediterraneantwenty-five hundred years ago. He had no explanation for them either.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Historic reports of whale and dolphin strandings:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"A mass stranding of pilot whales (Long-finned dolphins) on the shore of Cape Cod,Massachusetts, on June 30, 1902.Artist's sketch of whale stranded at Katwijk, Holland, beach in 1598.Source: Monsters of the Sea © 1994 by R.

Westerly Wind Cycles - Do They ChangeCetacean Food Supply Routes?There is an alternative hypothesis in this case and it has been proposed by some Australianscientists based on the pattern of mass strandings over the last few decades. There is adecadal cycle of westerly winds that shift the areas of productivity in that part of the world.DO YOU MEAN BY PRODUCTIVITY THAT THE FOOD THAT THE WHALES LIVEOFF OF WOULD BE GOING IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE OCEAN?Exactly. The food supply might be shifted more toward the shore, or into an area of fairlyshallow, sandy banks.

After Long Evolution in Oceans, Why Are Whalesand Dolphins Still Vulnerable to Strandings?WHALES AND DOLPHINS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE HIGHLY INTELLIGENT,CORRECT?Most whales and dolphins have a very high degree of cognitive ability that we wouldconsider to be intelligence, something comparable to our own problem-solving abilities,yes.DOESN’T THAT MAKE STRANDINGS EVEN MORE MYSTERIOUS, ESPECIALLYAT THE NUMBER OF 200, REGARDLESS OF SOCIAL GROUPINGS? THEY ARESUCH INTELLIGENT CREATURES THAT HAVE BEEN LIVING AND EVOLVING INTHE OCEANS OF THIS PLANET FOR NEARLY 60 MILLION YEARS. THAT MAKESIT SEEM SO DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY WOULD NOT ALREADYKNOW HOW TO AVOID THESE SITUATIONS THAT PUT THEM INTO BEACHES.I agree. I think it’s one of the great mysteries of sociality in this case because I think it issomehow tied to the fact that these species – long-finned pilot and sperm whales primarily,are highly social species. Magnetic Field Anomalies -Any Link to Cetacean Strandings?WHAT IS YOUR OWN OPINION ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT MAGNETICFIELD ANOMALIES SUCH AS AN UNDERWATER VOLCANO ERUPTING, ITCOULD BE A SEISMIC EVENT, IT COULD BE THAT THERE REALLY IS SOMEPOLE SHIFTING TO SOUTH AFRICA, AND THEN SOLAR FLARES THAT CANINTERACT WITH MAGNETIC FIELDS AND CAUSE ANOMALIES? WHAT IS YOUROWN PERSONAL FEELING ABOUT MAGNETIC FIELD ANOMALIES AFFECTINGTHE CETACEANS AND CAUSING BEACHINGS OR STRANDINGS?Well, I think it’s unlikely to be the causal explanation for the beachings. It may, though,have some association with where the strandings occur because they do seem to occur inspecific areas over time repeatedly. It might be that the stranding areas are on the magneticpaths that the animals are using for navigation. We don’t really know the extent to whichthey rely on magnetic cues, but it’s certainly possible that there are some magnetic cuesthat they use. If so, the cetaceans might be following magnetic paths and if beaches are onor near those paths, then they are simply in the way of the movement of the animals. Inthat case, magnetic field anomalies are not a causal mechanism; it’s a happenstance. Do Cetaceans Willingly BeachTo Stay With Their Family Pod?BUT AGAIN, IT SEEMS THAT THESE VERY INTELLIGENT LARGE, EVOLVEDANIMALS SHOULD NOT SUCCUMB TO CONFUSION WITH THEIRECHOLOCATION AND MAGNETIC FIELDS.That is one of the puzzling aspects of the strandings. The animals often seem to beintentionally stranding and this is something that some of the hypotheses do not explain.This was true in some of the recent events in Tasmania. An effort was made in the largeKing Island stranding to return the animals to deeper water, but in some cases, the animalturned around from deeper water and went straight back to the beach.That’s most easily explained by the social phenomenon, the group panic or group distress.The individuals that are taken back out to deep water might want to be in deep water. Theymight recognize they have been taken out to deep water, but they hear the distressed callsof their kin on the beach and they simply go back.We might say that’s not a very adaptive mechanism, but it’s part of the cost of sociality,just like disease is a cost of sociality. We live in large groups and so we’re susceptible toepidemics. You might ask: Why live in a large group? We should all be living in little huts"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"ten or fifteen miles away from each other. But there are benefits to living close togetherand there are benefits to sociality for the cetaceans. These are very successful species!They have populations worldwide in hundreds of thousands of individuals. But they aresusceptible to these tragic mistakes.THE CETACEANS ARE SUCH WONDERFUL CREATURES AND AS ONE OF THEPEOPLE SAID ON THE RECENT KING ISLAND STRANDING IN TASMANIA, ‘ITBROKE MY HEART TO HEAR THEM CRYING.’I agree with that. To hear them on the beach dying, surrounded by their friends and theirfamily, is quite tragic.AND HARD TO UNDERSTAND IF THEY ARE HEALTHY.Well, certainly some or most of them are healthy and that, I think, is what makes it all themore puzzling. But there might be individuals within the group that are truly in distress ofsome kind. Genetic Relationships of Stranded Cetaceans?HOW DO YOU GO FORWARD FROM HERE AS A CETACEAN EXPERT WITHOTHERS IN STUDYING THESE STRANDINGS, BEACHINGS, OF SO MANYANIMALS IF THEY PERSIST?We need to know about them in the wild, so one of our interests has been taking methodsto study the genetic relationships, the kinship of these individuals on the beach, and applythat to living populations in the wild – those are animals that are not in distress. Some ofwhat we found with stranded pods was a little unexpected. We found that they were not allclose relatives to each other. They were not all part of the same matrilineal line. Theyappeared to be mixes of different groups. We need to know if that is the case in the wild.We can also begin to understand better their movement patterns with methods such assatellite tagging. I did notice that the Australian scientists were able to put a small numberof satellite tags on some of the animals that stranded in November 2008. I happened to bewith a colleague, Nick Gayles, from the Australian Marine Mammal Center and hereported that the tags had been quite successful and that the animals that had been savedand released back into the deeper water, some of them seemed to behave quite normallyand moved back out into deep water and seemed to be swimming together again.DR. BAKER, DID YOU ASK HIM WHY HE THOUGHT THE ANIMALS STRANDEDIN THE FIRST PLACE?Nick and I have had long conversations about this. (laughs) All marine scientists have theseconversations over a couple of beers every evening and we would cover pretty much theexact range that you and I have covered today. But we don’t have a single explanation.There might not be a single explanation. Each stranding might be a little bit different. Undetected Environmental Factor X?IF YOU HAVE FOUND A MIXTURE OF ANIMALS THAT ARE NOT RELATIVES IN APOD, DOESN’T THAT INCREASE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE IS SOMETHINGIN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT PERIODICALLY CHANGES ENOUGH TODISORIENT THE CETACEANS AND CAUSE THESE HUGE STRANDINGS?It does shift a little bit the likelihood of some of the explanations, but without theknowledge of what their natural social groupings are, I don't think we can yet interpret thattoo much. If we go out and find these large pods are typically made up of a mix of differentfamily groups - it's unlikely they would be close relatives to that many individuals. It’spossible there are smaller family groups that associate together just as we do incommunities and those communities have almost as much cohesion as the blood kin.BUT THERE IS STILL THE POSSIBILITY IN THE KING ISLAND HUGE STRANDINGOF THE PILOT WHALES AND A FEW DOLPHINS - AND THE THREE PREVIOUSSTRANDINGS IN TASMANIA GOING BACK TO NOVEMBER 2008 - THAT THEREMIGHT BE SOMETHING GOING ON IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT NO HUMANYET UNDERSTANDS THAT’S CAUSING THESE MASSIVE, REPEATEDSTRANDINGS?Causing or influencing? If this hypothesis about 10-year wind shifts that cause changes inprey patterns are correct, then it might be the cetaceans are pursuing prey into areas that"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"they are just not familiar with. That would be a consistent explanation for the fact therehave been four strandings near Tasmania by both pilot and sperm whales, given that thetwo species feed on similar prey, particularly deep water squid. So, if the wind patternshave driven deep water squid up into more shallow water, then the animals are inunfamiliar territory.SO A LARGER CONTEXT OF POSSIBLE CAUSE FOR ALL THE RECENT LARGESTRANDINGS OFF TASMANIA AND THE MELON-HEADED DOLPHINS INMANILA BAY MIGHT BE RELATED TO GLOBAL WARMING BECAUSETEMPERATURES ARE CHANGING AND WATER TEMPERATURES ARECHANGING. THAT MEANS SPECIES IN THE FOOD CHAIN THAT HAVE BEEN INVARIOUS PARTS OF THE OCEANS COULD BE MIGRATING AWAY FROM CERTAINTEMPERATURES AND THIS MIGHT BE AFFECTING THE CETACEANS’ NORMALFOOD GATHERING?Well, that’s possible. I don’t know that it explains King Island and Manila Bay. The watersaround Australia and Tasmania certainly are warming. Whether that is good or bad for thepilot whales is harder to tell. Around New Zealand, where the pilot whales strand alongquite a gradient of latitude from near-tropical beaches on the north of the island down tosub-Antarctic beaches in the south. We have not seen a strong trend or change that appearsrelated to global temperature increase. But I think that is something that we might see inthe future. Global temperature changes might influence where it happens, but not why ithappens.”Dr. Baker is going to help me contact the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industriesand Parks to request copies of whatever necropsy reports will be made available from theKing Island March 2nd stranding of nearly 200 pilot whales.
