We put you here. But you have to live it.” - Ebe, Los Alamos, New MexicoReturn to Part 1April 5, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuing in Part 2 with Linda MoultonHowe's 1983 to 1987 High Strangeness Files about EBENs.From Linda Moulton Howe's High Strangeness EBEN files, 1983 - 1987.EBEN CLOTHES: They don't wear any.They have a thick hide of two layers, whichchanges color and temperature in varying light intensities. One photo in USAF files showsEbe (1949 retrieval?) in a human male's dress suit and tie, apparently USAF's effort tomake Ebe appear more normal for communication with visiting scientists and governmentagents.SLEEP: EBENs start sleeping in a sitting position as if in meditation and then lie back tosleep deeply for four to five hours. Allegedly on their home planet orbiting one of the ZetaReticuli binary suns, their normal day is 30 hours.HOUSING: EBENs live in “pueblos” and in a desert-like atmosphere. There are rivers andplants, but mostly arid. Ebe was afraid of Earth's oceans.FOOD: EBENs eat mostly vegetables and fruits. Ebe could not digest meat or most fats,which made Ebe sick. But the USAF officer who stayed with Ebe, mostly at Kirtland AFBand in Los Alamos National Lab, said Ebe's favorite Earth food was strawberry ice cream.Is that deliberately planted and seemingly ridiculous misinformation to track howinformation spreads through what people from official leaks - either misleading info orreal? Ebe also was taken to Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio and Walker AFB in Roswell,New Mexico.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Walker Air Force Base was the largest StrategicAir Command (SAC) base of the United States Air Force at the time of itsclosure in 1967. It is located three miles (5 km) south of the central businessdistrict of Roswell, a city in Chaves County, New Mexico. From 1941 to1948, the facility was known as Roswell Army Air Field. It is also known forthe Roswell UFO incident, an event that supposedly happened on July 4,1947. It is alleged that a “flying disk” crashed during a severe thunderstormnear Corona, New Mexico, north of Roswell Army Air Field. ]ATMOSPHERE: HOW COULD EBE BREATHE OUR AIR?At first, Ebe would breathe from a tank containing his planet's atmosphere about everyhour. After a while, he did not seem to need it. Adaptation to Earth's atmosphere?Allegedly gas composition of Earth atmosphere and EBEN atmosphere not hugelydifferent. Is that possible?ARE THE EBENS OUR FOREBEARS?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Ebe said, ‘Yes. We made you. We put you here. But you have to live it.’Project GARNET: “All questions and mysteries about the evolution of Homo sapienssapiens have been answered and this project is closed.” In alleged briefing paper for anAmerican president shown to me on April 9, 1983, Kirtland Air Force Office of SpecialInvestigations (AFOSI) by Special Agent Richard C. Doty.According to the USAF officer who stayed with 1949 retrieved Ebe, the EBENs wereastonished by all of Earth's different races. The EBENs claim responsibility formanipulating DNA in already-evolving primates to create standing up hominids on Earth,but the EBENs expected more homogenous Earth humanoids - more like their civilizationwhere everyone looks the same and telepathically think a like. Supposedly, there is no war,no struggle, no money in the EBEN Zeta Reticuli planet - all is programmed and wellorganized. Ebe communicated difficulty understanding Earth concepts of money andstores.There are several different versions about timelines of EBEN interaction with Earth. Someinsiders say the EBENs first came to Earth before the time of the dinosaurs and were infact responsible for manipulating DNA to create the dinosaurs. That would be at least 270million years ago.Other versions place EBEN first Earth arrival in time for the manipulation of DNA inNeanderthals to create Homo sapiens sapiens, which would be at least 35,000 years ago.Subsequently, there were allegedly other genetic experiments 15,000 and 5,000 years agosuch as manipulating DNA in some people selected in Bhutan that became an E.T.-created group of humans transported in disc craft from the Himalayas to the YucatanPeninsula, Guatemala and surrounding region. That specific E. T.-created human groupwere what became the Mayans until their sudden disappearance in 850 A. D. [ Medicalfact: Mongolian and Mayan babies at birth sometimes have a blue spot at the base of theirspine. ]Then most controversial of all is the EBEN assertion that their genetic manipulationprogram of Earth life included the creation “of a being 2,000 years ago to be placed onEarth to teach Homo sapiens not to war, but to love each other.” Do unto others as youwould have them do unto you. The “immaculate conception” was EBEN control ofmatter; i.e. fertilization of human egg inside Mary without sperm. If true, it means there isno patriarchal bloodline for Jesus. Mother Mary would be his only human source.The U. S. government agents with need-to-know about EBEN/Other issues are afraid thatany public disclosure of Christ being created by extraterrestrials to try to homogenizehuman thinking and make humans less violent would knock Catholics and Christians into atail spin.[ Editor's Note: Confusing the issue after the 1983 to 1987 period have beenpeople in the human abduction syndrome who say they have been told theTalls - blond, red and dark-haired - genetically created Christ to cause a timeline change for Earth from a catastrophic future to a more peaceful future. Soin this hall of mirrors with a quicksand floor that is the UFO phenomenonemerges the peculiar contradiction of two competing? warring? non-humangroups both claiming to have genetically produced Christ.] Holloman AFB IncidentDate I was given was April 25, 1964. Three EBEN ships arrived in a deserted area of base.All three were white and egg-shaped. One landed while two others hovered above as if toprotect the landed craft. At least three humans were in a greeting party, including the sameUSAF Captain who became a Colonel and who stayed with Ebe between 1949 and June18, 1952, when the alien died of unknown causes at Los Alamos National Lab.IS THIS WHEN THERE WAS AN EXCHANGE OF THE DEAD ALIEN BODIES FROMTHE 1949 AND OTHER UFO CRASHES?Yes. The contact lasted only three hours. Two grey-skinned EBENs stepped out firstfollowed by the taller, beak-nosed non-human with reptilian eyes, ropey headdress andholding the rod communicator in its left hand.WHAT IS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GREY EBENS AND THE SUMERIAN-TYPEALIEN HOLDING COMMUNICATION ROD?Sources not certain.

Military and scientificinvestigators were baffled by “hockey pucks” floating in the air inside the craft as ifdefying gravity and some how interacting with columns of light generated by “computer”control panels. The panel instruments have symbols most similar to Tibetan script. Thepanel instruments are activated by touch. To \"steer\" the craft, you place a hand over acolumn of light and turn your hand which ever way you want to go. Light is the key totheir technology and every different color of light means something significant.Sample Tibetan text. Source Wikipedia.According to sources, how the craft operated was a mystery for at least two decades ofintense human study. Allegedly hydrogen ramjet fuel processed through crystals.A standard ice hockey puck is black vulcanized rubber,1 inch (25 mm) thick, 3 in (76 mm) in diameter,and weighs between 5.5 and 6 ounces (156–170 g). Source Wikipedia.On December 29, 1981, outside Houston, Texas, the U. S. government was testing the HillAFB, Utah, craft in which the complex and incomprehensible crystal system was bypassedwith a nuclear powered system constructed by human engineers. Allegedly, that night wasthe third test to see if humans could fly and control the extraterrestrial craft modified withnuclear powered engines when something went wrong and the nuclear device was leakingradiation. According to sources, that is the diamond-shaped craft coming down near thehighway in front of the car containing Betty Cash, Vickie Landrum and Colby Landrum,Vickie's 7-year-old grandson on their way home to Dayton, Texas.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “At about 9.00 p.m., while driving on an isolatedtwo-lane road in dense woods, the witnesses said they observed a light abovesome trees. They initially thought the light was an airplane approachingHouston Intercontinental Airport (about 35 miles away) and gave it littlenotice.A few minutes later on the winding roads, the witnesses saw what they took tobe the same light as before, but it was now much closer and very bright. Thelight, they would claim, came from a huge diamond-shaped object, whichhovered at about treetop level. The object's base was expelling flame andemitting significant heat.Vickie Landrum told Cash to stop the car, fearing they would be burned ifthey approached any closer. However, Vickie's opinion of the object quicklychanged: a born again Christian, she interpreted the object as a sign of theSecond Coming of Jesus Christ, telling her grandson, ‘That's Jesus. He will nothurt us.’Anxious, Cash considered turning the car around, but abandoned this ideabecause the road was too narrow and she presumed the car would get stuck onthe dirt shoulders, which were soft from that evening's rains. Cash andLandrum got out of the car to examine the object. Colby was terrified,however, and Vickie Landrum quickly returned to the car to comfort thefrantic child. Cash remained outside the car, ‘mesmerized by the bizarresight.’"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The UFO Encyclopedia: The Phenomenon from the Beginning,Vo l u m e 1: A-K (second edition) © 1998 by Jerome Clark: ‘Theobject, intensely bright and a dull metallic silver, was shaped likea huge upright diamond, about the size of the Dayton watertower, with its top and bottom cut off so that they were flat ratherthan pointed. Small blue lights ringed the center, and periodicallyover the next few minutes flames shot out of the bottom, flaringoutward, creating the effect of a large cone. Every time the firedissipated, the UFO floated a few feet downwards toward theroad. But when the flames blasted out again, the object roseabout the same distance.’Illustration of diamond-shaped craft emitting flames from bottomas it descended towards road in front of Betty Cash, Vickie Landrumand Colby Landrum, Vickie's 7-year-old grandson, on their wayhome to Dayton, Texas, at 9 PM Central, December 29, 1980.Wikipedia: “The witnesses said the heat was strong enough to make the car'smetal body painful to the touch. Cash said she had to use her coat to protecther hand from being burnt when she finally re-entered the car. When shetouched the car's dashboard, Vickie Landrum's hand pressed into the softenedvinyl, leaving an imprint that was evident weeks later. Investigators cited thishand print as proof of the witnesses' account; however, no photograph of thealleged hand print exists.The object then moved to a point higher in the sky. As it ascended over thetreetops, the witnesses claimed that a group of helicopters approached theobject and surrounded it in tight formation. Cash and Landrum counted 23helicopters, and later identified some of them as tandem-rotor CH-47Chinooks used by military forces worldwide.Despite their claims that they knew nothing of the UFO, the U.S. military triedto buy Betty Cash's car on a number of occasions. The roof of the car wasdamaged by the heat from the UFO. About 3 weeks after the incident anumber of men in unmarked trucks arrived at the scene of the UFO sightingand repaired the heat damage of the road. Several weeks later they returnedand removed 6 inches of the surface material before repairing the road again.In the hours that followed their UFO experience the trio developed painfulswellings and blisters on their skin. They also suffered severe headaches andupset stomachs and Colby developed a sunburn-like rash. Vickie’s hair beganto fall out and Betty had to be admitted to hospital as her eyes became soswollen that she could not see. Over the weeks that followed their UFOexperience all three of them lost some hair and developed eye problems.When their hair grew back it was different from their original hair.Vickie Landrum was convinced that they had come into close contact with asecret military craft which was responsible for their injuries and medicalexperts confirmed that the symptoms that the three unfortunate victimssuffered were consistent to intense electromagnetic radiation in the ultra-violet, microwave and X-ray bands.Both Vickie and Betty Cash sued the U.S. Government for $20 million but in1986 the case was dismissed on the grounds that ‘no such object was owned,operated or in the inventory of the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force or NASA.’ ”]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Since the diamond-shaped aircraft's test flight gone awry in Texas, sources say the samecraft was flown to Nevada where it has continued to be secretly tested at Nellis AFB.
