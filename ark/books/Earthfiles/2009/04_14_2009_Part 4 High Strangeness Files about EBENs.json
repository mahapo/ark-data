Each is on a different frequency.”- Linda Porter, California AbducteeReturn to Part 1April 14, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuing in Part 4 with Linda MoultonHowe's 1983 to 1987 High Strangeness Files about EBENs.HOW FAR BACK IN EARTH'S HISTORY HAVE EBENS INTERACTED WITH EARTHLIFE?The alleged presidential briefing paper I was shown at Kirtland AFB on April 9, 1983,stated in one paragraph that extraterrestrials were operating on Earth before the time ofthe dinosaurs and that in fact, the EBENs genetically created dinosaurs. Scientists date thebeginning of dinosaurs to at least 230 million years ago. Dinosaurs ranged the entire planetuntil 65.5 million years ago when it's theorized that a large meteorite, or bolide, maybeone-half-mile in diameter, crashed into the Gulf of Mexico near the Yucatan peninsula thatcaused the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event that wiped out 48% of all genera of life onEarth, including the dinosaurs.According to the USAF Captain in 1949 and later a Colonel, Ebe told him that dinosaursfrom our Earth were gathered up by EBENs before the meteorite impact and have beenrelocated to another planet for preservation as we put animals in zoos on Earth.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “The Cretaceous–Tertiary extinction event,which occurred approximately 65.5 million years ago (Ma), was a large-scalemass extinction of animal and plant species in a geologically short period oftime. Widely known as the K–T extinction event, it is associated with ageological signature known as the K–T boundary, usually a thin band ofsedimentation found in various parts of the world.”Artist's rendering of large meteorite or bolide impactin Gulf of Mexico 65.5 million years ago near the Yucatan peninsula.K–T boundary along Interstate 25 near Raton Pass, Colorado.The iridium-rich ash (the boundary) was deposited 65.5 million years agowhen it is hypothesized that a large meteorite hit earth and wiped out 48%"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"of all genera of l i fe on Earth, i ncl udi ng the di nosaurs.Illustration of a Brontosaurus known to have been publishedin Animals of the Past © 1902 by Frederic A. Lucas.In 1983, I was told that the year before in 1982, a French road crew plowed into a buriedsilver-colored, disc-shaped craft embedded in granite and soil dated to at least a millionyears ago. Incredibly, it was reported that the craft was still powered. Inside were twoskeletons about 2-feet-tall. The craft's interior was described as altogether different thanthe EBEN craft. A section of the craft's hull was eventually cut out and sent to SandiaLaboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico, for analysis. According to the source, “they stilldon't know what it's made out of.” Were the small entities actually androids manufacturedand programmed by other unknown non-humans to do work specifically on Earth?WHAT ABOUT OTHER MYTHOLOGIZED EARTH CIVILIZATIONS SUCH ASATLANTIS?Ebe said at one time on Earth there was an alien civilization from outer space thatinhabited land surrounded by water. Ebe also communicated that EBENs helped theEgyptians construct the pyramids for their dead and transition to an after life. The largestones were moved by antigravity technology, according to Ebe.HOW MUCH OF EARTH'S HISTORY HAS BEEN MANIPULATED BY EBENS?Ebe said that the entire history of the solar system and Earth was recorded in a crystaldevice which projects 3-dimensional holograms of everything that has happened and ishappening.Ebe said that the truth about the Earth, the galaxy and the universe is that there are cyclicBig Bangs followed by contractions followed by more Big Bangs, but the EBENSdiscovered there is an End to the universe on a specific timeline and the EBENs made aneffort to go into that End. Ebe said going into it is not pleasant. It is another dimension.Later on in 1991, I interviewed an abductee named Linda Porter who was familiar withnon-human communication about other dimensions. She encountered an entity thatresembled a tall praying mantis insect. She remembered a telepathic download into hermind from the creature of which the following is an excerpt:“There is much, much more to existence than we could ever begin tounderstand. Much of what we have ben taught regarding the physical universeand the laws that govern it is wrong.This creature's civilization communicates difficult concepts via the use ofsymbols that radiate emotion. They use this form to get concepts across withtheir exact true meanings intact. No misinterpretations can occur this way.The symbols are not mathematical ones, but appear as 3-dimensional holographic pictures that resemble abstract sculptures. The emotional aspect isrelayed via carrier waves that resemble sound waves, but are not part of thehuman sound spectrum. These waves can be felt, but not heard. If thecreatures want to clear a certain area of humans, they can 'broadcast' thiscarrier wave over the area at a certain frequency and it will create intense fearin people, causing them to flee the area. It does not cause any harm, so thealiens say.Problems arise when trying to translate this visual/emotional input into words.Human semantics can cause explanations to become mired down in confusion.What is extremely easy to comprehend on one level of existence using oneform of expression then becomes very hard to interpret correctly whentranslating it onto another level using a limited form of expression such as thehuman language. A lot of meaning is lost and many important concepts"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"become hazy or are totally misinterpreted.The universe is built on sound patterns, which is why so many differentworlds/dimensions can exist in the same space. Each is on a differentfrequency. Disrupt a world/dimension to the point that you destroy the carrierwave it exists on and you have created a 'hole' in existence that cannotsupport the dimension above or below it. Each frequency, besides maintainingits own world/dimension, also supports - or holds in place - the one above itand below it. Everything is interdependent!The other world/dimensions will begin to collapse into this 'hole.' Not only willthis destroy countless other civilizations, but the resultant area of mattercompressed into such density can throw the whole gravitational field forparsecs around it out of balance, thus causing the further damage of evenmore worlds as they are pulled out of orbit. The process feeds on itself.There are countless worlds/dimensions occupying the same space withoutbeing aware of one another because of having their own individual octaves.This octave/frequency holds the world/dimension in place and causes it toexist safely without interfering with (or even being aware of) other worldsaround it. This frequency acts as a buffer zone to keep everything in its place.Do anything to disrupt it and you begin a collapse that starts a deadly chainreaction. If the density of this collapse reaches a certain weight, space/timeitself begins to collapse.” [ For Linda Porter's complete dialogue, please see:Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. 2: High Strangeness © 1998 by LindaMoulton Howe in Earthfiles Shop.]EBEN RELIGION: Ebe also said, “There really is a devil.” The implication was that thedevil's source is another dimension that some how tries to interact with this matteruniverse's dimension of which Earth is a part. EBENs are sun-worshipers, like theEgyptians were. EBENs don't like war. They are not supposed to have offensive weapons,only defensive energy weapons that knock out any offensive weapons directed at them.Linda Porter also had an insight about the “dark side” from her encounters with thepraying mantis and grey-skinned EBEN types.“The dark side seems to be a part of creation that has ben at war with itselfsince the beginning of all-that-is. How or why the split? I don't know. Thosehigher evolved would know that, not I. But ever since the two sides splitapart, they have been creating beings with which to fight one anotherthroughout all existence. Not just on this planet Earth, but on others, too. Is itsomething Creation itself uses as a tool to 'push against' itself as a way ofexpanding its own knowledge, growth and consciousness? I don't have theanswer to that one either.”EBEN ANIMALS: Ebe described armadillo-like animals that live on the EBEN planetsaid to be dominated by desert conditions. Ebe said there were not many other indigenousanimals there, but they have imported from Earth our cats, dogs and some other Earthanimals to their planet.EBEN TRANSPORTATION: Many kinds of craft. Ebe said his civilization travels aroundtheir EBEN planet in ground machines the way we think of cars. But there are manydifferent kinds of craft for space travel. Ebe described traveling to another galaxy. TheEBEN craft in Earth skies are called “bathtubs” by human agents because the EBEN craftare egg-shaped and put down “bent legs” that remind some people of antique bathtubs thatrested on ornate, angled legs. In contrast, the blond humanoid ships are shaped more likeupside down pie plates with three “balls” placed in a triangle pattern on the bottom of theblond “Nordic, or Swede,” craft.EBEN craft and technology are described as so advanced that the best human scientists atLos Alamos cannot grasp the technologies. Travel is inter-dimensional. According to Ebe,there are at least fourteen different dimensions. Two of those dimensions, the human mindmight be able to relate to, but humans would not be able to relate to the other twelvedimensions.The December 1980 Cash-Landrum craft is supposed to be one set down at Hill AFB,Utah, in 1953 as a “gift” by EBENs. The advanced craft was left powered up, butscientists have been trying to figure out how to make it work ever since. Supposedly itsnuclear power is too advanced for our human scientists to deal with, so they tried torevamp it with a nuclear system that human scientists might control. But the experimentbackfired near Houston and nearly killed the two women and the young boy. That craftwas transported to Nellis AFB Area 51 for experimental flights away from civilianpopulation. Supposedly there are hockey puck objects that levitate inside the craft thathave puzzled human scientists since the discovery of the craft in 1953."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The December 26 - 28, 1980, Bentwaters AFB UFO events - the first sign of an alienpresence in the Rendlesham Forest was a mechanical, “American-sounding voice” thatcommunicated to the Bentwaters AFB tower. Then there was a bright flash of light fromwhich fell silvery “ash” and two spaceships appeared. Supposedly there was a technicalproblem with one of the craft and the non-humans were in the forest from December 26 to28, 1980, while repairs were underway and American and British military unitsphotographed and monitored the alien craft and lights.NEW MEXICO POLICE OFFICER LONNIE ZAMORA: It was an EBEN military scoutcraft with the insignia on it. Communications with American military about landing formeetings are done by star coordinates and someone on the human end goofed by one day.The EBENS were supposed to have landed at the Trinity Site in the northern end of theWhite Sands Missile Range at 6 AM, April 25, 1964, in a white, egg-shaped craft onsupport legs. Instead, because of the communications error, the EBEN military scout craftlanded near Socorro at 5:45 PM on April 24, 1964, which Lonnie Zamora encountered.Apparently realizing there was a mistake in location, the EBENs took off in theegg-shaped scout craft that produced flame and scorched plants. The landing leg supportsleft deep impressions of a triangle pattern in the desert soil. The EBENs and Americanmilitary communicated again and the EBENs landed the next morning in the correctTrinity Site location.Police officer Lonnie Zamora, Socorro,New Mexico, 1964.

Source: UFOcasebook.com.Much later on, Texas investigator, Chris Lambright, contacted Lonnie Zamora. “I sent himseveral pages of small sketches that covered various details of his sighting. I includedseveral variations of this symbol, along with one that matched what I had seen in otherplaces and another that matched what I thought he had described to me. I asked him toplace a check mark by whichever sketch matched his recollection. However, in the sectionshowing the symbols, he was nice enough to actually redraw what he had seen.”Above the row of symbol variations is the one drawn by Lonnie Zamora"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"for Texas investigator, Chris Lambright, indicating what police officer Zamora saw with his owneyes on the egg-shaped craft near Socorro, New Mexico, at 5:45 PM on April 24, 1964.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “The Zamora incident began at 5:45 P.M. onApril 24, 1964, in Socorro, New Mexico. Thirty-one year old policemanLonnie Zamora was on patrol when he was passed by a car which wasobviously speeding. Zamora took off in chase of the vehicle, but suddenlyheard a loud roar in the distance, accompanied by a bluish, orange flame risinginto the air. He knew that there was a dynamite shack not too distant fromhim, and he thought at first that there had been an explosion there.Abandoning the chase for the speeder, he pointed his police car in thedirection of the shack. He radioed his activities to the sheriff's dispatcher.As Zamora proceeded towards the rising smoke and flame, the aftermath ofthe explosion seemed to disappear and reappear because of the rising anddipping roads he traveled. The route he was on was a narrow gravel one, andit wound around a small gully. As he approached the location of the shack, henoticed in the distance a shining object, anywhere from 100 to 200 yardsaway. His first reaction to this sight was that it was an automobile which hadoverturned, and its gas tank had exploded. Upon a closer look, however, hediscovered that it was an oval-shaped object without windows or doors. Hestated that the object was about the same bulk of a medium-sized car. He wasdrawn to an unusual red insignia on the side of the object, and then noticedtwo beings that he thought at first to be children, dressed in white overalls. Herecalled that one of the \"children\" seemed to jump (become frightened), uponnoticing him.”] MJ-12: American presidents are treated only on a Need To Know basis. John F. Kennedywanted everything out about all the UFO information - he threatened MJ-12 that he wouldorder an official investigation of all secret vaults and files on the extraterrestrials. Theconsequence was that MJ-12 ordered JFK's assassination to keep the public and mediafrom finding out about the non-human presence and about MJ-12's authority ininvestigations and documents concerning the non-human presence, technologies andback-engineering efforts in highly classified operations within American corporations.
