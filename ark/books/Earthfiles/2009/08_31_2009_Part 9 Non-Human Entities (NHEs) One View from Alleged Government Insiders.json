Return to Updated Part 1August 31, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuing Ray Boeche's January 24, 1992,notes from first meeting with the Writers in Nebraska.Ray Boeche: Enfoldment Technology - produces research on the use of various waves toinfluence physical health and behavior.The human brain operates as a receptor for portions of the electromagnetic spectrum. EMenergy, when modulated, can act as a stimulus at some point in the sensory systems. Thisprovides a physiological basis for the degradation of behavior and for emotional and physicalchanges.The degree to which brain stimulation can be limited to a discrete locus is a complex functionof the wavelength of the energy, the scattering that occurs as the energy passes throughtissue layers, and the nature of the antenna.Air ions and electro-aerosols have been demonstrated to have physiological and behaviorconsequences. Effects have been demonstrated on emotions, reaction times, flicker fusionfrequency, blood pressure, sedimentation rate, serum protein, and metabolism. Chargedparticles penetrating the alveolar wall are transferred to blood cells and act on the centralnervous system by stimulating the pulmonary nerves.The effect of photon waves, sound waves and other oscillatory disturbances of free space,for example neutrinos and gravitons are also under investigation.Fourier transforms are produced because everything produces an interference pattern that iseither an amplified signal or a scattered wave pattern containing information that waspresent in the brainwave oscillations; or, in the case of the inanimate, in the object itself. Psychotronic Weapons - Brain Manipulation from A DistanceThe atmospheric carrier wave spreads the interference pattern over the surface of the earth,and certain people or devices can perform Fourier transforms to pick off the interferencepatterns and reconstruct the originals. The Fourier components of entire scenes - buildings,landscapes, individuals and so on, are directly decodable by the receiver.The human organism is a liquid-crystal-like assembly of biomolecules and is capable ofcoherent and monochromatic amplification of incoming electromagnetic waves in the kilohertzregion by more than a million fold. Not only the incoming waves are amplified, but if theliquid-crystal rotation levels are modulated by bioelectrical-potential fluctuations induced bythe brain, the outgoing field will carry this modulation information. A second person, ordevice, capable of perceiving and demodulating this kilohertz wave modulated information"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"can then “read” the first person's mind.[ Editor's Note: Psychotronic weapons theoretically can manipulatehuman behavior with the use of subliminal messages, by either sound orvisual stimuli. See U. S. Army article entitled “The Mind Has NoFirewall” © Spring 1998 by Timothy L. Thomas in Parameters, pp.84 -92.Lieutenant Colonel Timothy L. Thomas (USA Ret.) is an analyst at theForeign Military Studies Office, Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. He haswritten extensively on the Russian view of information operations andon current Russian military-political issues. During his military career,he served in the 82d Airborne Division and was the Department Headof Soviet Military-Political Affairs at the U.S. Army's Russian Institutein Garmisch, Germany.] Psychotronics Independent of Distance and Magnetic ShieldingSome lower frequency neutrinos can stimulate the de-excitation of biophysical rotationallyexcited molecules in the rain. Neutrinos can be responsible for the release of coded thoughtwaves. Since neutrinos can travel unimpeded through the Earth or other barriers, this isconsistent with the independence of psychotronic effects to distance and to magneticshielding.Regarding macroscopic influences, experimental evidence indicates that events influenced byhuman will power actually do occur. For example, when tumbling dice are influenced to cometo rest in a desired position. By psychotronically influencing the atomic nuclei in the die, aperson can generate gravitational forces of the magnitude equal to about 15% of the Earth'sgravitation.According to some quantum-mechanical theories, all matter is indeterminate and dispersedand actual reality must be described by a wave function with an infinite set of sine statesextending over all of space and time. Physicist David Bohm believes that matter must bedescribed by a multi-state wave function. The quantum wave is a wave of knowledge andinformation.This information is not arranged in terms of position and time, as we have come to perceiveit, but rather as frequency and amplitude information, and the human consciousnessessentially performs Fourier transforms on this so as to order that information into the morefamiliar form. Consciousness might, by this mechanism, access any portion of space andtime to acquire information. Further, since it is known that a particle with wave properties isnot located in a strictly determined place, but can be all over the entire universe, or atdifferent points simultaneously, a generalization from microcosm to macrocosm makespossible the appearance of a macro object anywhere in the universe.Each object present as a standing wave in a specific location in space and time is all presentat all points in space and time. (Example: The paper on which this is being written existseverywhere and at all times simultaneously. It was present last year in the Zeta Reticulisystem, except that there was less of it there than there is here now.) Information regardingphysical objects can be enfolded and carried in electromagnetic waves, by electron beams,neutrinos, gravitons, quantum-matter waves, and numerous other forms of movement.Planck's equation states that frequency and energy are the same thing. Since we know fromEinstein that energy and matter are convertible, it follows that frequency can be matter. So,from frequency interference patterns, we should be able to manifest the physical objects thatproduced these patterns. This is the principle on which psychotronic devices function. Thefunction of the psychotronic device is to bring out, by appropriate focusing, the wavestructure of a distant object, which is latently present in any particular point in space.Likewise, human psychological processes have wave characteristics, and the mental imagesand thoughts of all people are present in every point in space and time. Recording andmanifesting images as standing waves that have been ejected outside the brain andexternalized is another accomplishment of this psychotronic device.The wave functions of quantum mechanics represent real matter waves that permeate allspace and time. It requires only the will of a capable person or a suitably designed device toperform an operation on these waves that would permit the perception of any scene in spaceand time. It is through Fourier analysis of these waves that objects and events distant inspace and/or time can be captured and visualized.Researchers are now working on means to interface thought and behavior directly through atransducer attached to the head and read directly by a computer. The computer can monitor,modify and control behavior without the subject's awareness.Research has established that the most effective psychotronic subjects are highlytemperamental and emotionally open females in the 16 to 21 age group. Side effects,including inappropriate behavior, neurasthenia, psychasthenia and hallucinations and hysteriawere noted.There have been demonstrations of the psychotronic manipulation of consciousness, andcorrelations shown with systematic EEG recordings. Tests have included sending to thepercipient the anxiety associated with suffocation and the sensation of a blow to the head."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"After transmitting negative emotions to the human subject, the white blood cell countdecreased by 1600. Such a psychotronically imposed shift in white cell count could be usedto alter human health. Control and manipulation of physical health, as well as humanconsciousness, thoughts, emotions and will has been achieved.During such \"negative healing,\" field pulsations were noted that were synchronous with thesubject's respiration rate, heartbeat and brain alpha rhythm pattern. Effects on humansubjects have included pain, paralysis, burns and other tissue damage and acute coronarythrombosis. While electrical fields have been measured successfully between healers andsubjects, knowing these field potentials has not yet led to the duplication of human-inducedbeneficial effects by means of mechanically-generated fields. Consequently, more successhas been achieved in the area of negative healing than with the positive type.To a significant degree, we are dealing with the supernatural and positive supernaturalentities are superior to the negative. For example, Satan, an \"evil angel,\" has far less powerthan God.A psychotronic device is impossible to defend against and its effects, including changes inbrain wave characteristics, disturbance of equilibrium and dizziness, can result in personalitychanges and/or physical discomfort that if employed broadly against troops would altercombat effectiveness. When employed selectively against military and political leaders wouldreduce the ability to command and govern. Such a device, capable of negatively affectinghealthy tissue as well as disrupting fundamental brain rhythms, heart control and biologicalclock mechanisms, would pose a severe threat to enemy command, military, intelligence,embassy and other security functions.” After Ray Boeche's January 24, 1992, Meeting with the WritersInformation presented to Ray Boeche, but which he was not allowed to write notes aboutduring the meeting. These are notes Ray wrote down later:Shown 3 series of photos, 4 photos per series, purporting to show individuals being killedduring psychotronic weapons experiments.1. Male, white, 25-30 years, allegedly death by remotely-induced cardiac arrest.2. Female, white, 20-25 years, allegedly death by remotely transmitting and creating headtrauma equivalent to crushing of right anterior portion of the skull.3. Male, white, 30-40 years, allegedly death by remotely controlled suffocation.Setting was laboratory environment, alleged victims were wired for EKG, seated in recliningchair, somewhat similar to dentist's chair.In effort to establish contact with non-human entities, every avenue is being explored.Satanic rituals involving human sacrifice have been performed. Much study is/has been givento writings of Crowley.
