One was a psychologist who studied ancient sigils, symbols and the “alienwritings” shared by so many people in the human abduction syndrome. He sent back acopy of an English translation by famous British archaeologist, Sir E. A. Wallis Budge, ofThe Bandlet of Righteousness, An Ethiopian Book of the Dead. Budge showed theevolution from talismanic drawings of humanoid eyes in a face to a geometric pattern ofthe eyes to the spaces in the geometry forming a religious Maltese cross that becomes arepeating flower petal pattern that becomes a plain 4-fold geometry that is repeated inlinking decorative patterns reminiscent of the very ancient Flower of Life symbol. Thepsychologist wanted me to consider the many layers of hidden meanings in religioussymbols through the centuries that might relate to deceptions in the battles between forcesof light and darkness.English translation of Ge'ez script by famous British archaeologist, Sir E. A. Wallis Budge,of The Bandlet of Righteousness, An Ethiopian Book of the Dead. The text functions as a passport to heavenand has been customarily buried with the bodies of deceased Christians in Ethiopia. It isapparently comparable to the Egyptian Book of the Dead, and its use in Ethiopia might havederived from ancient Egypt. The HMML manuscript text contains the basic legend as revealed by Christ, theprayer for the pain of death, the secret names of Christ, and prayers for the journey to heaven.Original parchment pages in British Museum, London, England."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Ethiopian Bandlet of Righteousness in Ge'ez script on parchment.Other comments came from a Florida resident who has studied the UFO phenomena formost of her life. Her letter dated August 20, 1994, begins with her reaction to the contentin the Writers two letters.“While I can agree a great deal with the idea that the phenomena is notexactly an ‘extraterrestrial’ source that stands behind the entire Ufologicalscenario, but something a lot less close to us in nature, I do think that there isalso a very human factor of manipulation as Jacques Vallee concluded in hisMessengers of Deception © 1979. There is after all an incredible technologyout there, psychotronic and holographic devices, among others. Somehow it isvery difficult for me to accept the ‘Grey abduction scenario’ in the way it isexposed to us by the ‘victims.’ This is a very familiar interaction under adifferent disguise:All through known history and myth and folklore, we keep reading aboutwomen and men reporting sex with alien entities (whether they called themgods, incubus/sucubi, demons, angels, fairy folk, the devil). The result is thesame: there were humans reporting alien entities seducing or raping them intheir rooms or outside; having their children like in the changeling folklorewith the fairies coming back to take their babies or exchanging theirs for thehuman one.Even today in far away rural areas, you have these reports from countrypeople of an ‘invisible being getting into their beds and having sex with them.’I just heard one of these stories happening in Ecuador. It's common place incertain unpopulated areas!You also have the reports of strange markings left by the entities, especiallythrough the Inquisition records of the witches declarations. We even havepaintings from the Middle Ages showing the demons pushing ‘spears’ throughthe navels of their victims like the needle-like device the Greys use to‘examine their abductees’!?!Everything sounds so familiar that nobody can convince me that whatever ishappening now has not been happening for centuries and even millennia! Soreal was this in the Middle Ages that the Christian priesthood had entirecouncils to decide if angels and demons had sexual organs and whether theirnature could allow them to have sperm and to be capable of reproducing withhumans. Could there be a baby as a result of carnal intercourse between twoapparently totally different species? the church council asked themselves.Weren't the angels/demons made of an extremely subtle substance that wouldnot allow them to deal with material bodies?I can see why the Writers referenced you to Vallee's Passport to Magonia ©1969 and the other titles. As soon as I saw the list, I researched in ourDictionary of Gods and Goddesses and Dictionary of Angels bibliographiesand I can confirm for you that the titles exist: Angels and Demons Accordingto Lactantius was published in 1944 by the Catholic University of AmericaPress, Washington, D. C., by Emil Schnewis. The Devils and Evil Spirits byReginald Campbell Thompson, 1903/04, probably London. Essentials ofDemonology by Edward Langton was 1949 in London. The only one Icouldn't find was the 1601 book, probably because it is too old, but I'm sure itexists and probably Jacques Vallee knows about it or even has it.Other points that I want to make briefly are:1) I perceive also Rudolf Steiner's ideas in the Writers. I question the authority"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"of ‘orthodox Christian thought’ as a source of unique truth (after all from itsbeginnings it has been a mixture of several other religions and currents ofthoughts such as Egyptian, Persian, Gnostic/Manichean and pagan, too).2) The ‘Gods’ of a particular civilization/culture/religion becomes the ‘falseGods’ or demons of the next civilization. This is also related to WHO the‘bringers of all good things to humanity’ really are. The first question I wouldask of the Writers would be: If we are dealing with a non-human, other-dimensional intelligence, how come the Writers know about them and abouttheir intentions?3) I think the Jungian thought is relevant in this scenario. I once heard aninteresting theory about a war that's going on between old Archetypes fromthe Collective Unconscious. I have come to understand that ‘archetypes’ arelike an image that the people keep feeding until the thought form becomesreal, more or less like the Tibetan Tulpas.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - In mysticism, a tulpa is the conceptof a being or object which is created through sheer will poweralone. It is a materialized thought that has taken physical formand is usually regarded as synonymous to a thought form.]4) The idea that because we're living the end of a millennium and there is somuch pressure in our psyches for the impending destruction of our ecosystemand the feeling of impending doom, the abduction scenario could either comefrom our own inner worlds (spiritual), and the Greys represent our egos or‘demons.’ The whole thing could mean how we are being forced to look andsearch inside ourselves for the ultimate answer to everything that ishappening.My Mexican friend, C. O., used to say that the UFO experience was our‘entrance’ or initiation into the Magical World. It is a way to wake us up intothe idea that there is something beyond the material world, there is somethingbeyond those that are still sleep walking through life.5) What happened with the so-called ‘Shaver Mystery’reported by Palmershould teach us a lesson.Amazing Stories, June 1947, Volume 21, Number 6, byZiff-Davis Publishing Company. Cover art by Robert Gibson Jones.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - During 1943, RichardSharpe Shaver wrote a letter to Amazing Storiesmagazine. He claimed to have discovered an ancientlanguage he called “Mantong,” a sort of Proto-World"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"language which was the source of all Earthlylanguage. In Mantong, each sound had a hiddenmeaning, and by applying this formula to any word inany language, one could decode a secret meaning toany word, name or phrase. Editor/publisher RayPalmer applied the Mantong formula to severalwords, and said he realized Shaver was on tosomething.Ray Palmer wrote to Shaver and asked how Shaverhad learned of Mantong. Shaver responded with anapproximately 10,000 word document entitled “AWarning to Future Man.” Shaver wrote of extremelyadvanced pre-historic races who had built caverncities inside Earth before abandoning Earth foranother planet due to damaging radiation from theSun. Those ancients also abandoned some of theirown offspring here, a minority of whom remainednoble and human “Teros,” while most degeneratedover time into a population of mentally impairedsadists known as “Deros” - short for “detrimentalrobots.”These Deros still lived in the cave cities, according toShaver, kidnapping surface-dwelling people by thethousands for meat or torture. With sophisticated“ray” machinery that the great ancient races had leftbehind, they spied on people and projectedtormenting thoughts and voices into our minds(reminiscent of schizophrenia's “influencingmachines.”) Though generally confined to theircaves, Shaver claimed that the Deros sometimestraveled by spaceships or rockets and had dealingswith equally evil extraterrestrial beings. Shaverclaimed first-hand knowledge of the Deros and theircaves, insisting he had been their prisoner for severalyears.]In this country, and probably in our planet in general, there are always peopleavid to be the actors of whatever bizarre scenario might show up. Do webelieve today that there exist Deros and Teros underground hurting us withtheir deadly rays? I doubt it. But when Shaver published his account, Palmerreceived thousands of letters from people who allegedly were suffering thevery same attacks reported by Shaver. That should make us think. Anotherphenomenon that the police know very well occurs when a horrible crime hasbeen committed and the police receive dozens of calls from people declaringto be the perpetrators. What is that telling us?It is very difficult to know if the persons who sent you those papers are forreal and are sincere. This field is too full of weirdoes and also of cruel jokerswho want to have a little fun. The idea of psychological warfare (John Keel)and diversion is not new, but we do need to know WHO is behind it. Or is theEarth's subconscious mind trying to tell us something because it's being sobadly hurt by us humans? I know you are taking your chances in trying tofollow up on this, but I don't think you can avoid if it there is the minimalpossibility that the whole thing is real.”Another colleague sent me an excerpt from a book by William Irwin Thompson entitledEvil and World Order © 1976. Thompson was born in 1938 and is known primarily as asocial philosopher and cultural critic. Thompson founded the Lindisfarne Association in anattempt to help humanity avoid a potential dark age. Lindisfarne takes its name from aViking-threatened Irish monastery which kept writing and knowledge of the classics aliveduring the European dark ages. More recently, William Thompson has expressed doubtthat a dark age for humans has been avoided.“We are like flies crawling across the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel: Wecannot see what angels and gods lie underneath the threshold of ourperceptions. We do not live in reality; we live in our paradigms, ourhabituated perceptions, our illusions; the illusions we share through culturewe call reality, but the true historical reality of our condition is invisible tous.”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The August 16, 1994, floppy disc was the last physical communication I had from theWriters. But I kept sending them questions and excerpts from my evolving book, Glimpsesof Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness, hoping the Writers would reply.Finally in April 2001, Ray Boeche received a message from the Writers for me: “It is toodangerous for Linda and us to have any further contacts.” Return to Updated Part 1For further reports about non-human entities, please see reports in the 1999 - 2009Earthfiles Archive (partial list below) and my books An Alien Harvest and the 2-volumeGlimpses of Other Realities in the Earthfiles Shop.• 08/31/2009 — Part 9: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 08/23/2009 — Part 8: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 08/14/2009 — Part 7: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 07/20/2009 — Part 6: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 07/19/2009 — Part 2: 1980 RAF Bentwaters Lights and Craft Were “Extraterrestrial InOrigin”• 07/17/2009 — Part 1: 1980 RAF Bentwaters Lights and Craft Were “Extraterrestrial InOrigin”• 07/14/2009 — Part 5: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 07/06/2009 — Part 4: Non-Human Entities (NHEs):• 06/25/2009 — Part 3: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 06/21/2009 — Part 2: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 06/17/2009 — Part 1: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 06/01/2009 — Part 10: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 05/26/2009 — Part 9: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 05/13/2009 — Part 8: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 05/05/2009 — Part 7: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 04/29/2009 — Part 6: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 04/21/2009 — Archive Reprint: Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell Says GovernmentsCovering Up E.
