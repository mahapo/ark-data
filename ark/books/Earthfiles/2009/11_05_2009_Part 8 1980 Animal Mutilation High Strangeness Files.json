Thissegment continues on September 22, 1980, after the high strangeness at Iona Hoeppner'sBriggsdale, Colorado, high school lab. Grover, Colorado, near Pawnee National Grassland is northeast of Greeley and Fort Collins.September 29, 1980 - Phil McKinley ranch south of Grover, Colorado. OnSeptember 29, 1980, Phil McKinley found a 4-year-old cow dead and mutilated100 feet from Crow Creek in deep grass. The last time he saw the cow healthyand alive was on Friday, September 26, and he estimated she had been dead twodays when he found her.a) Right ear taken clear to skull. Cow had a thick, hard rubber,marker tag that pierced the ear. McKinley found half of the tag wasabout 2 to 3 feet in front of the dead cow. The other ear tag halfwas never found. Why both to cut tag in half if taking whole ear?\"I thought maybe coyotes had done it, but no teeth marks in therubber,\" Phil McKinley told me. Sheriff Andrews in Weld Countyhas the tag half now. b) Hide on right side of nose and up over nostrils was excisedalong with upper and lower jaw so that cow's mouth was outlined"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"by hide stripped clean, leaving all muscle tissue underneath in tact.Phil McKinley told me, \"That's what is really peculiar, no flesh wastaken. If coyotes get to a dead animal, they will go for the soft partsfirst like the nose and rectum and eat to the bone. But no flesh atall was taken from this cow.\" c) Tongue taken, cut from deep in throat.d) Udder removed - looked circular and smooth as if cut with verysharp instrument. \"Removed whole thing and hole went clear intobelly. You could see the intestines. I wonder if that's because somevarmints got to the mutilator's cut?\"e) No bloat; some swelling. f) Rectum cored out - one side showed signs of coyote chewing,but the other side was smooth, no bite marks. Hole was 4 inchesacross and 6 to 8 inches deep into cow's abdomen. \"Just looked likea big, deep hole,\" said McKinley. g) Right eye gone - \"but think bugs did it because there wasn't anyevidence of eye being cut out.\" h) \"We had just vaccinated, cleaned and worked over our cowspretty good one week before and none of them were sick. So, thosecows had been in that pasture only one week when I found her. Asfar as I know, she was a healthy cow and I don't have any idea whyshe died.\"i) \"There were no signs of struggle where she was in the grass - nodisturbance at all. No signs of thrashing. She was dead orunconscious when she hit the ground.\"j) Little patch of skin behind her right front arm pit about 3 incheslong and 1 inch wide was missing. Looked sort of like a skinned upplace where black skin was kind of rectangular. k) Tassel on tail was gone, leaving clean tail stump. \"Looked like itmight have been chewed on, but coyotes don't eat hair and if theyhad chewed on the tail, that hair would still have been there. But itwas not. I've never seen coyotes take a tail or an ear before.\" OtherMcKinley comments: \"Coyote damage is pretty rough looking -they go clear down to bone. Her nose really puzzled me. That hideon the nose is thin and it was so carefully taken that her nostrilholes were untouched. Everything was there but the hide skin.\"Saturday night, September 27, 1980, a neighbor heard a noise at 10:30 PM like ahelicopter. The neighbor went out to see, but could not see anything.Back in the summer of 1975 or 1976, Phil McKinley remembers watching a lightcircle in the sky and shining a beam onto the ground about 3 miles north of hisplace. Then pretty soon, there was a second light that circles, shining a beam onto the ground. Then a third light circled, shining a beam on the ground while allthree lights kept circling. He never heard any sound, but 3 miles is pretty far tohear noise. He thought the lights were near Kiowa (see map below) and droveon roads to get closer. But when he got where he thought the lights were, theydisappeared. Phil drove on to Kiowa and then saw a light east of town. Later,Phil learned that in Buckingham north of Kiowa, people called authorities aboutseeing lights in the sky there that night, too.At midnight a week later after he saw the three circling lights, Phil heardsomething that sounded \"just like it was coming right through the house.\" Thedogs went crazy, but when he got outside he could not see anything, eventhough the noise was still there. Phil said it sounded like a low-flying helicopterhad gone right over the roof of his house at a terrific speed. He told me he isused to low-flying pesticide spraying planes around his area that don't set hisdogs barking. But that night, his dogs went crazy barking even though he couldnot see any lights - only heard the loud helicopter sound.McKinley asked, \"Why wouldn't coyotes have touched that cow's nose if theywent into the cow's belly?\" Phil speculated that something didn't smell rightabout the nose because coyotes, dogs and other animals will stay away fromanything that does not smell right to them.Phil said he asked the sheriff what would happen if he or one of his deputiescaught one of those helicopters down in a field and shot at it to keep it from"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"flying away? Sheriff Andrews said he did not know because it had neverhappened. Sheriff Andrews also told McKinley that the only crime they couldbook anyone on was malicious mischief and trespass because no one wasrustling the animals. they were just leaving cut up dead bodies. So, some lawenforcement doesn't take the whole matter very seriously. \"I don't think lawenforcement is going to spend any money on these mutilations because it's not abig crime,\" Phil McKinley said. Phil McKinley mentioned another strange thingthat happened back in 1975-1976: a local farmer was out riding when he saw ahelicopter flying real low along Crow Creek making loud noise and said it\"scared the hell out of him.\" Rancher said he heard it before he saw it.McKinley also recounted something Sheriff Andrews told him: a man south ofBriggsdale, Colorado, looked out of his window late one night and saw what hethought was a helicopter down in his pasture. He called the sheriff and told himit was still there and to get out there as fast as possible, which the sheriff did.The sheriff drove into the pasture fast, never stopping, with his high beams on.He drove all over the pasture and never found anything. Phil said, \"Maybe theyaren't helicopters after all because I've heard the chopper sound right above mewhen I couldn't see anything!\"In 1975 to 1976, August and September were the peak periods for animalmutilations in northeastern Colorado and that pattern is repeating in 1980.Another Grover, Colorado, case - ranch of Vic Hilman 12 miles east ofGrover: He had a bull mutilated back in 1975 - 1976. Tongue, eye, penis,testicles, rectum \"all cleanly cut out.\" Hilman said, \"No animal can do that. Thecuts were smooth, very precise and perfect. A coyote's just like a dog - they tearthings apart.\"Since then, he has not had any more mutilations that he knows about. \"It's veryweird. It makes you stop and wonder what is going on because I know it is notpredators!\" Vic Hilman told me. Tuesday, September 30, 1980 - Charlotte and Bob Smithburg and theirchildren were driving along I-70 around 7 to 7:30 PM toward their home inArriba, Colorado, when they saw something very bright in the sky. At first it wasa bright yellow color and the family talked about what it could be. Then theywatched it come down out of the sky, maybe two miles from where they were inthe car. As it moved downward, the light changed to a green, then a red and thenit disappeared. The parents estimated they all watched for two or three minutes,\"but we did not see it hit the ground.\" Could not hear any sound.That same night of September 30, 1980, near Lindon, Colorado, 3 milessouthwest of the Phillip Scott ranch, a neighbor heard dogs howling at night,which was not normal.Kiowa, Arriba and Lindon, Colorado, east of Denver, have hadanimal mutilations reported since at least the early 1970s. October 1980October 1, Phillip Scott ranch, Lindon, Colorado - The next day onWednesday, October 1, Scott found one of his black Angus cows dead andmutilated. The animal was 9-years-old and had given birth to a calf probably theday before. The cow was in the bottom of a sand creek in a very narrow place.No water. She was on her right side.The entire udder had been removed in a smooth oval shape about 2 x 2.5 feet ofexcised hide. The excision went toward the cow's chest and up toward her left"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"leg and up to a point on the flank. \"There was definitely a knife cut around therectum,\" Phillip Scott told me. \"It was a 4 x 6 inch diamond-shaped cut.\"When Phillip Scott found his cow, she was bloated and the intestines hadout-pouched a bit, so he's not sure what happened to the afterbirth. \"I don'tknow - was it still there or what?\"No blood anywhere on the cow or around her on the ground. No tracks. Tail,tongue and eyes were intact. A local veterinarian was supposed to visit to checkthe cow over, but he never showed up.Scott said in June 1977, three years before, another of his black cows wasmutilated. But she was a sick and old animal in a different pasture. In that case,he found what he described were \"helicopter pad tracks 1.5 inches across inloose dirt and a cactus was knocked flat to the ground.\" Also, the grass near themutilated cow was swirled flat in a big circle.Deputy Sheriff Bob Jones of Washington County in Akron, Colorado, tooksome polaroid photographs of Scott's cow, but Scott did not have anyphotographs himself. Also October 1 - Orvil Harms in Pine Bluffs, Wyoming. On his buffalograss pasture on a high ridge, right in the middle of the pasture 18 miles straightsouth of Bushnell, Nebraska, or 15 miles east and 1 miles south of Hereford,Colorado - Orvil Harms found a 5-month-old steer calf, 450 pounds, dead andmutilated.Orvil was working in his pasture on Monday, September 29, 1980, at noon timewhere he later found the male calf two days later on October 1st. The calf wasnot in that pasture location on October 1, so Orvil figured the mutilationhappened Monday night, September 29.a) Where sex organ had been, there was a 24-inch-long and3-inch-wide oval of excised hide. \"It was definitely cut with a knifebecause it was sort of jagged like they had stopped and started overat places trying to cut.\" The skin in the oval was pinkish-white.b) Rectum was cored out 6 to 8 inches deep, a dark hole, and couldnot see any organs inside. Definitely no out-pouching of intestines.c) Animal was bloated with feet sticking up in air, lying on leftside.d) Both ears cut off \"like they'd done it with a scalpel.\"e) No blood visible anywhere.f) Eyes were there and no skin missing from around them.g) Nose - 6 inches up the nose, hide only was missing in an ovalshape 6 inches by 6 inches up between eyes.h) Tongue was in place and was not protruding even thoughanimal bloated.i) Tail was there.j) Sheriff Andrews investigated and took flesh samples from therectum. A Lt. Deputy and another officer with Andrews dismissedthe animal as a predator attack, but Sheriff Andrews thought it wasa genuine mutilation.k) No sign of death struggle. Buffalo gras untouched and couldnot see any tracks around the steer.l) There were signs that coyotes had been there. Scott saw wherethe natural predators had pulled chunks of hide and dropped themon the ground. He thinks the coyotes \"were suspicious ofsomething\" - maybe the scent of whoever did the mutilation. \"Thecoyotes tried to eat on that steer, but they didn't want to get tooclose. We've got a lot of coyotes out here and they are starving allthe time.\"m) \"There was a liquid on the ground.\" I figured it was comingout of the steer's stomach from the bloat. [ But see Roland Ball and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Iona Hoeppner case of September 16, 1980.]n) No bird droppings anywhere.Orvil told about how he had another cow mutilated in 1975-1976. He said it wasdifferent than the steer in that the cuts were oval and \"real smooth,\" not asjagged as this current oval. In the cow mutilation, the jaw was stripped, tonguegone, bag gone and rectum cored out.When I asked Orvil if anyone had seen or heard anything unusual on Mondaynight, September 29, he said no. Then he continued that there were lots ofhelicopters flying around over his place at night in 1975 to 1976. \"You couldhear them and see the flashing lights on and off.\"DO YOU SEE HELICOPTERS NOW? \"No, but the mutilations are stillgoing on.\"IMPORTANT CONTRAST: Orvil told me that the day before finding hissteer on October 1, 1980, an antelope had been killed along side the road nearhis place. The next day on October 1, only twelve hours later (overnight), thecoyotes had \"eaten everything but bones and a little patch of skin.\"So, the fact that the steer would be in his pasture for 36 hours untouched isquite unusual.Orvil described another incident: Around October 9, 1980, one of Orvil's calvesgot pneumonia and died. He and a vet cut her open to find out exactly why thecalf died. They they left her carcass out in the pasture. One day later, coyoteshad not touched the calf \"because of our human smell on it.\" Friday, October 10, 1980 - Rented pasture in Westminster, Colorado, suburbnorthwest of Denver. A horse owned by Manford Uevelhoer was found dead bya girl walking through the pasture. The girl called the police.Animal Warden Shelly of the Westminster Police Department soon arrived andfound the horse completely intact. She thought it appeared as if the horse hadrun hard before it died because of sweat deposits around the horse's neck.Warden Shelly left to get a camera to take photographs and when she returned30 minutes later, the left eye and 9-inich-long piece of hide down the horse'smuzzle had been ripped out, apparently by a dog. But the rectum was still intact.At 8 AM, Saturday, Karen Priest, another Animal Warden, went out to see thehorse because the animal's owner, Mr. Uevelhoer, arrived in the pasture with hissaddle to ride the horse and found it in terrible condition. Mr. Uevelhoer wasshocked because he had seen the horse alive and well Friday morning and noone from the police department had been able to get hold of him to tell him hishorse was dead.When Karen Priest arrived at 8 AM, the horse's rectum was \"definitely cut outin a cylindrical cut about 8 inches wide. You could see the interior organs.\" Theleft side of the horse's face was completely excised. She wondered if dogs coulddo that? Magpies were standing around the horse's face and at the back of thehorse, but Karen said it was impossible as far as she was concerned for themagpies to have cut the 8-inch hole.Both Karen Priest and Shelly took photos when they visited the horse. Thehorse had only been in the pasture for one month. She was the newest horsethere. No one understands why the horse died - especially not Karen Priest whois baffled by the cleanly cored out rectum.

Similar eyeballenlargements were described by Deputy Sheriff Keith Wolverton,Cascade County Sheriff's Department, Great Falls, Montana.In September 1982, two years after the first broadcast of my Emmy award-winningdocumentary, A Strange Harvest, about the animal mutilation phenomenon, I received acall about an unusual cow mutilation south of Denver that haunts me to this day. Theranch owners were Bill and Linda Dzuris, who had been raising cattle on the same land 30miles east of Colorado Springs for years. On September 9, 1982, what happened to one oftheir cows was not like anything they had ever seen before."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"A 6-year-old pregnant female was alive and well at noon that blue sky, sunny day in a herdof about thirty other pregnant females that Bill and Linda were keeping close to theirranch house waiting for births. The pasture was less than one-half mile from where thecouple were painting their house exterior. Neither of them heard anything unusual thewhole afternoon after checking on their pregnant cows at mid-day.Then at 5 o'clock, Bill Dzuris got in his semi-truck to go for a load of hay and saw a blackand white cow lying down in the pasture. He assumed she was giving birth and called hiswife from a phone down the road and asked Linda to go check on the cow.Linda Dzuris was stunned by what she found. \"Half of the udder was gone. You could seeinto the stomach cavity. The eyes were bulging out. I was horrified at the thought of whatcould do this in broad daylight when we had checked the cows only a few hours before!\"The rectum was also cut out in an oval about 18 inches wide. Was the unborn calfremoved through that large opening? There was no examination of the cow by aveterinarian.Deputy Kelso from the El Paso County Sheriff's office responded on September 10, 1982,to the Dzuris phone call and filed an offense report. He was puzzled and wrote in hisreport, \"...cut by some type of instrument.\"Before then in 1980, the Dzurises reported two other mutilations on their ranch that the ElPaso Sheriff tried to dismiss as the work of natural predators. But the sheriff's office couldnot dismiss the September 9, 1982, cow mutilation as predator.Did a UFO hover unseen and silent over the Dzuris ranch that afternoon, send down a paleyellow beam as described by other eyewitnesses over the years, take up the pregnant cow,excise the unborn calf and other tissues, and then let the cow silently back down into thepasture so close to the Dzuris ranch house without detection, even on a sunny day?Greeley Tribune, Greeley, Colorado,Sunday, November 2, 1980.Return to Part 1More Information:For further information about worldwide animal mutilations, please see EarthfilesArchive for ten years of reports (a few titles listed below).
