This wouldbe expected for super-thermite formulations in order to produce high gaspressures from ignition and thus make them explosive.”- April 2009 Bentham Open Chemical Physics Journal, Volume 2 Left: Photomicrograph of red/gray chip from samples of the WTC dust involvedin this study. 31-page report with photomicrographs and spectra were published April 3, 2009,in The Open Chemical Physics Journal. Right: Red-gray residues of burnt thermiteused by railway workers to cut or weld railroad tracks shown in Wikipedia.May 1, 2009 Copenhagen, Denmark - On April 4, 2009, I received an email in whichthe subject line said: “Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 WorldTrade Center Catastrophe.” A hot link was included and I ended up at a website entitledBentham Open Access, The 2009 Open Chemical Physics Journal, Volume 2, where Iclicked on DOWNLOAD. A 25-page PDF with many color photomicrographs and spectraended up on my desktop. See: Bentham Open Chemical Physics Journal, Vol. 2.First, I researched thermite and learned that aluminum mixed with iron in specific wayscan create short bursts of extremely high temperatures. Thermite heating can be used forcutting or welding steel such as railroad tracks without requiring heavy equipment. Back inthe early 1990s, about a decade before September 2001, scientists at Lawrence LivermoreLaboratory in California began researching nanotechnology-produced thermite that couldbe used by the military. Normal thermite does not make sound while it heats through steel,but nanotechnologically produced “super-thermite” can produce high gas pressures thatwould be explosive.The Open Chemical Physics Journal paper begins: “We have discovered distinctivered/gray chips in all samples we have studied of the dust produced by the destruction ofthe World Trade Center.” The dust analyzed had been collected by four different residentswho lived close to the World Trade Center. The paper states, “One sample was collectedabout ten minutes after the collapse of the second tower, so it cannot possibly have beencontaminated by clean-up operations.”The paper also states: “Each sample was found to contain red/gray chips and iron-richmicrospheres, which are also peculiar.” Twenty-five pages later, after laying outmeticulous details in photomicrographs and spectra analysis of the red-gray chips andmicrospheres, the scientists conclude: “... the red layer of the red-gray chips we havediscovered in the WTC dust is active, unreacted thermitic material, incorporatingnanotechnology, and is a highly energetic pyrotechnic or explosive material.” "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" At 8:45 AM Eastern on September 11, 2001,the World Trade Center North Tower (110 stories) was hit byAmerican Airlines Flight #11. At 9:03 AM Eastern, the WTC South Tower(110 stories) was hit by United Airlines Flight #175. After burning for 59 minutes,at 10:02 AM Eastern, the South Tower on left in photo above, collapsed in ahuge cloud of dust and debris, followed a half-hour later at 10:32 AM Easternby the North Tower on right. World Trade Center Building 7 is the beige rectangularbuilding (47 stories) in foreground across the street from WTC 1 and 2.Yellow circles mark World Trade Center (WTC) Tower 1,WTC Tower 2 and WTC Building 7.As the North Tower collapsed on September 11, 2001,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"debris hit 7 World Trade Center, causing heavy damageto the south face of the bui l ding.Seven hours after the collapse of WTC 1 and 2, at 5:20 PM Easternon September 11, 2001, 7 World Trade Center also collapsed straight down.After 9/11, Congress charged the Department of Commerce to investigate how the WTCtowers and Building 7 collapsed straight down. So, the Dept. of Commerce underthen-Secretary Donald Evans organized a World Trade Center Federal Building and FireSafety Investigation Team under its National Institute of Standards and Technology, knownas NIST.Page 9 of a NIST-prepared question and answer summary about the collapse of WTCBuilding 7, states: Q: “Why didn't NIST investigators look at actual steel samples from WTC 7?A: Steel samples were removed from the site before the NIST investigationbegan. In the immediate aftermath of September 11, debris was removedrapidly from the site to aid in recovery efforts and facilitate emergencyresponders' efforts to work around the site. Once it was removed from thescene, the steel from WTC 7 could not be clearly identified. Unlike the piecesof steel from WTC 1 and WTC 2, which were painted red and containeddistinguishing markings, WTC 7 steel did not contain such identifyingcharacteristics.” So I learned that steel beam supports for the two tall World Trade Towers had been paintedred, but not Building 7 (47 floors constructed in 1985). Could the red painted-steel-beamsused in the original WTC 1 and 2 (110 stories) construction that began in 1966, at theurging of Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman David Rockefeller, explain the red color onthe red-gray chips described in the Bentham journal?My next step was to call the lead author on the Bentham journal paper, Niels H. Harrit,Ph.D., Associate Professor of Chemistry at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark.Prof. Harrit received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Copenhagen in 1975,followed by a year at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, Germany, and in 1977, anotheryear of post-doctoral work at Columbia University in New York City.Interview:Niels H. Harrit, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen,Copenhagen, Denmark: “These red/gray chips were first discovered by Dr. Steven E.Jones because there has been after lots of indication that thermitic material had been used.First of all, molten iron in the remains of Ground Zero and molten iron was pouring out ofthe South Tower minutes before it collapsed. And this alone is a severe indication thatthermite has been present.Furthermore, the finding of small spheres of iron in the dust in abundance, in great amountof small iron spheres in the dust. When an iron particle is perfectly round, it means that ithas been a liquid and it has been flying."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"April 2009 Benthan Open Journal:“Fig. 20. Photomicrographs of residues from red/gray chipsignited in the Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). Notice theshiny-metallic spheres and translucent spheres. Each bluescale-marker represents 50 microns.”MEANING FLYING IN THE AIR?Yes, this means that these iron particles that are abundant in the WTC dust. This is molteniron that has been droplets and automatically forms spheres. So, these two observations:1. Molten iron coming out of the tower and being found under the towers for weeks andmonths after the collapse of the towers and Building 7, and2. Finding spherical iron particles in the dust indicate that thermite has been used.So, there was a good reason to say, ‘Hey, let’s take a look at the dust. Maybe there issomething left.’These red-gray chips are not easily discovered or seen because they are small. The biggestof them are around 1 millimeter and maybe a little more. They can be, if you are lucky,seen by the naked eye. But most of them are less than that, which means that you have toget the dust under a microscope in order to find them.Luckily, the chips are magnetic, which means you can take a strong magnet and pull italong side with a plastic bag and extract the red-gray chips together with the iron spheres.So, you isolate the magnetic material from the dust. This way, you automatically get a highconcentration of the chips and they are more easily discovered under the microscope. Butstill, you need a microscope to see them.So, these red-gray chips, this is the most important aspect or quality of these chips – theyare active! The chips actually react. They take off at 430 degrees C., but their reactioncontinues beyond 1500 degrees C. (2732 degrees Fahrenheit) because molten iron isformed in the process. You can actually see, before and after, in the active chips thatmolten iron is being formed. I’m surprised at this actually because the chips are very, verysmall, but still the reaction is so violent that it can produce temperatures beyond 1,500degrees Centigrade."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Red Primer Paint On OriginalWTC Steel BeamsFurthermore, in the primer paint, which was used on the steel beams at the original WorldTrade Center – we looked up the original recipes for those paints. The paints contained asan anti-corrosive: chromium and zinc, which we do not find. And magnesium, which we donot see either. These are negative indications why the red-gray chips are not paint.THE THERMITIC MATERIAL PRODUCED THROUGH NANOTECHNOLOGY ASYOU HAVE DESCRIBED IN YOUR PAPER, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CREATINGEXPLOSIVE GAS?Could be. We don’t know yet. This is something remaining. We don’t know yet if thethermitic materials are explosives or working as heat production. They can do both and beboth. All we say is we have found this material and those who put it there should tell ushow they made it and why it was there and how it got there.

W. Nanoenergetics:an emerging technology area of national importance.Dept. of Defense Amptiac Q 2002; 6 (1): 43-48.AMPTIAC is Advanced Materials, Manufacturing andTesting Information Analysis Center in Rome, New York.WHY IS IT THAT LAWRENCE-LIVERMORE LABS WOULD BE PRODUCINGNANOTECHNOLOGY THERMITIC MATERIAL?Because these are the explosives of the future. There is no doubt that the explosions of thefuture will be nanothermitic. And they are advertised as ‘smaller, cheaper and nastier.’That’s the trend. When you are producing the explosives of the future, they will besmaller, cheaper and nastier.IN 2001, THE CONCEPT OF NANOTECHNOLOGY THERMITIC MATERIAL WASNOT GENERALLY KNOWN IN THE WORLD, WAS IT?You’re perfectly correct. I would probably not know anything about this if I had not seenBuilding 7, the third skyscraper in the WTC (World Trade Center) going down. Why Did WTC Building 7 Collapse7 Hours After WTC1 and WTC 2?RIGHT, EVERYBODY HAS BEEN PUZZLED ABOUT WHY DID BUILDING 7 GODOWN WHEN IT WAS NOT HIT BY AN AIRLINER LIKE THE OTHER TWOWORLD TRADE TOWERS WERE HIT BY JETS AND JET FUEL AND THATCAUSED THEIR COLLAPSE.COULD YOU START WITH THE ISSUE ABOUT WHY THE COLLAPSE OF"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"BUILDING 7 PROVOKED YOU AND THE OTHERS TO DO THIS CHEMISTRYRESEARCH WORK?I was flabbergasted! I saw it by accident. As a natural scientist, you usually understandwhat is going on around you and if you see something you don’t understand, you have aproblem. You’ve probably seen the film yourself. The building 7 just goes down like this –totally symmetrical, sudden onset, free fall speed 6.5 seconds. And I said, ‘What! Let’s seethat again!’ And I pushed the button ten times to see it and my jaw kept hanging furtherand further down. ‘What’s happening? What’s going on?’And then I was hooked. Since that day there has been no way back for me. That was it!There are not very many – only a handful of companies – which can do this so brilliantlythat the building fell down into its own footprint within a few feet. They took down abuilding 186 meters, 47 stories, almost 200 meters down into its own footprint in 6.5seconds! Now, that is a masterpiece. There are probably only five companies in the worldthat can accomplish such a feat.HOW DO YOU THINK THE NANOTECHNOLOGY THERMITIC MATERIAL MIGHTHAVE BROUGHT DOWN BUILDING 7?It either melts or it blows the steel beams, the steel columns. You can use it for cuttingsteel or knock it over, depending upon the specific functionality of the thermite.IN BUILDING 7, THE THERMITIC MATERIAL IF IT WERE THERE, WOULD HAVEBEEN IN THE BOTTOM IN THE BASEMENT?Building 7 was a more classical demolition where you cut it from the top and then veryfast. There are different charges, there are different waves, different series of explosions.First you weaken the whole building, and then when it is just about to collapse, you blow itfrom the bottom up and doing this within fractions of seconds.It is important to remember that Building 7 fell in free fall speed. That means the 47stories, when it began to fall, there is nothing below it. The 47 stories fall as if left in emptyspace 187 meters above ground. It falls with all support gone. When the top floor starts tofall, at that moment all supports have been cut. This has been done very accurately in time.THE CUTTING OF BLDG. 7 WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE SEVENHOURS AFTER THE WTC TOWERS WENT DOWN?No way! It takes months of preparation. You have to do the planning. You have to look atthe architectural drawings of the buildings. They made a 3-dimensional pattern in acomputer program, not only to realize all the ways the building is built, but they cansimulate the demolition many times so they can see exactly how the building will comedown, adjusting the charges. That takes months!SO, WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT THE THERMITIC MATERIAL, IF IT WEREINVOLVED IN QUIET EXPLOSIONS PERHAPS IN ALL OF THE BUILDINGS,THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME KIND OF ELECTRONIC SIGNALS THAT SETOFF CHARGES ON SEPTEMBER 11 ...Oh, yes!AND THAT IN BUILDING 7, THERE WAS SOME DECISION TO WAIT FOR 6 OR 7HOURS BEFORE THE ELECTRONIC SIGNAL TO SET OFF THE THERMITICCHARGES?Oh, yes. Why Bldg. 7 – they waited 7 hours to do that is also speculation beyond my rolebeing here. I’m a chemist. We have found the thermitic material and those who put it inshould tell us how and when and why. Exactly how the charges were triggered, probablyyes, by wireless transmission. That would be the most safe to do. It was done veryaccurately. Building 7 is a masterpiece in demolition.OK, BUT HOW WAS THIS DONE? IF THIS THERMITIC MATERIAL IS THECULPRIT IN ALL THREE BUILDINGS COMING DOWN, HOW WAS IT APPLIED INTHE WORLD TRADE TOWERS AND HOW WAS IT APPLIED IN BUILDING 7?I don’t know. We are not saying that the red-gray chips are the only material doing this.All we’re saying is that thermitic material is found in the dust and those who brought thatmaterial into the buildings should tell us how it was brought in, how it was applied to thesteel beams and how they made it.We think this deserves a good criminal investigation, which has never been performed yet.THE IMPLICATION IS AN INSIDE JOB IN THE UNITED STATES, RIGHT?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I have no idea. We’re talking about quite substantial quantities and in order to transportthat, you would have to first need a truck. Then, I suppose, you roll it into the buildings onpalettes and take it up by elevators and apply it to the beam columns in strategic places. Ittook months in preparation, calculations and planning. Months!WHAT WOULD SET OFF THE THERMITIC MATERIAL?Remote control probably. This was controlled remotely. It was a delicate operation.ALL OF THE MILLIMETER CHIPS WOULD BE CONTROLLED BY A RADIOFREQUENCY?No, the millimeter chips are remains from what was left from much larger charges. Theseare just the material that survived.SO, THIS IS NOT LIKE PEOPLE GOING AROUND WITH SOME KIND OF SPRAYGUN AND SPRAYING ON THIS THERMITIC NANOTECHNOLOGY MATERIAL?Oh, no. We don’t know! Those who did it should be forced to tell us about it. Again, wehave found the remains, the leftovers, of active thermitic material. How much exactly hasbeen applied? How it has been applied? Who got it into the buildings? Who put it there andhow they put it there? That remains for somebody else to explain.But the event has never had a criminal investigation. And no proof has ever beenpresented to the public for the official government version. The FBI has not provided anycharges. No one has been accused. Nobody is wanted for this! If you go to the FBI MostWanted list, you will see that no one is wanted for the attack on the World Trade Center.I represent a group of scientists who have discovered thermitic material in the dust. Andthose who put it there should tell us how and why.BUT WHAT WOULD BE THEIR REASON FOR COMING FORTH TO THE WORLDAND EXPLAINING HOW AND WHAT THEY DID? THEY DON’T WANT ANYONETO EVER KNOW, RIGHT?If there is still justice in America, there should be means to get around that.SO, THE IMPLICATION FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW IS THAT IF THETHERMITIC MATERIAL IS IN FACT A MAJOR CULPRIT IN BRINGING DOWNWORLD TRADE TOWER 1, WORLD TRADE TOWER 2 AND BUILDING 7 ATLEAST ...Yes, I believe that....THAT THIS WOULD HAVE TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE, THE PLANTING OF THETHERMITIC MATERIAL, WOULD HAVE TAKEN DAYS AND WEEKS BEFORE 9/11TO PUT IN PLACE?Let’s say weeks, yes.IT COULD NOT ALL HAVE HAPPENED ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001?No way!IS THERE ANY OTHER EXPLANATION FOR WHY NANOTECHNOLOGY-PRODUCED THERMITIC MATERIAL MIGHT BE FOUND THROUGHOUT ALL THEDUST IN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER REGION?No. This is very sophisticated material created in very sophisticated labs by highly skilledpeople. Normal Thermite Hisses.Would Nanothermite Explode?A QUESTION I’M STILL NOT CLEAR ABOUT. THERE WERE FIREMEN WHOREPORTED HEARING EXPLOSIONS BELOW THEIR FEET.The classic thermitic reaction makes no noise. If you are using the thermite for meltingsteel, there is just hissing. It makes no loud noise. There are no bangs. So, whatever wentoff in the basements, I don’t know.

HIS FAMILY HAS CONNECTIONS AROUND THE WORLD.IS IT POSSIBLE THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN WORKED WITH A VERYSOPHISTICATED LAB TO PRODUCE THIS THERMITIC MATERIAL?This is beyond my competence. The scientific work we have presented here implies thatthe thermitic material is found in the dust. We think you (United States) should have acriminal investigation and those who put it there should be forced to tell us how it gotthere, why it got there, and when.” Continued in Part 2 - Physicist Steven E.
