A week later, I received an email from a retiredWisconsin businessman in rural Elmwood, Wisconsin, who has taken more than onehundred digital still frames of a reappearing bright, aerial object. His images like all theothers appear to be 3-dimensional, multi-colored patterns in the sky, changing shape everysecond or two.Today, I received similar images by email downloaded from the videotape of a womanwho lives in Beavercreek, Clackamas County, Oregon, about 30 miles northeast of Salem.Subject: Unidentified lightsDate: March 11, 2009To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“ I'm writing to you for some feedback. I live about 30 miles from Salem,Oregon in the mountains in a little village called Beavercreek, Oregon(basically a couple of buildings and a gas station!). On March 11, at 12:30AM, I couldn't sleep and happened to glance out my bedroom window tonotice above the tree line what appeared to be a star flickering blue and red. Itwas in that position long enough that I was able to get binoculars to take alook and to see that it wasn't a star. I shot some footage on my digital zoom. Itook some stills of the footage and enlarged it in Photoshop and got someinteresting shapes that seem to have some commonality about them in termsof shape. I called the weather bureau to find out if they knew anything. Theysaid it wasn't a weather balloon, but could have been some hot air balloon ofsome sort. There are hot air balloon enthusiasts in the Salem area, but whatthey'd be doing in the air on a cold night at 12:30 AM is beyond me!I've attached a few of the enlarged stills for you to take a look at.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" If anyone has more information or images of such changing aerial patterns, please email: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.More Information:For other multiple-colored light patterns in the sky since January 2008 in Stephenville,Texas, please see these Earthfiles reports in the Earthfiles Archive:• 12/17/2008 — Erath County, Texas, Policeman Saw 600-Foot-DiameterAerial Craft Over Stephenville Court House• 12/12/2008 — More Ohio Eyewitnesses See Glowing “Pod” Rise Up toTriangle• 12/02/2008 — Updated: Strange Aerial Object Over Irving, Texas• 07/26/2008 — Part 1: Why No Military Response to Radar UnknownHeaded to Bush Crawford Ranch on January 8, 2008?• 04/24/2008 — Strange Aerial Lights Like Texas - But NowPhotographed in Indiana, Illinois, and Massachusetts"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"• 02/26/2008 — Viewer Comments About Infrared Cameras, AerialSymbols and Lights• 02/22/2008 — Updated: More Aerial “Symbols” Photographed OverDublin, Texas• 02/22/2008 — Abductee Jim Sparks Comments On Alien SymbolTechnology• 02/20/2008 — Updated Part 1: Viewer Comments About Aerial Flamesand “Symbols” Over Dublin and Stephenville, Texas• 02/14/2008 — Update: Mysterious Symbols Projected in Night Sky byAerial Disc Near Stephenville, Texas, Local AirportFor further reports about unidentified flying objects and mysterioius aerial lights, pleasesee my books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities and mydocumentaries A Strange Harvest and Strange Harvests 1993 now available in DVDformat in the Earthfiles Shop.Also, see Earthfiles Archive for dozens of reports from 1999 to 2009.Websites:Majestic-12 Documents: http://www.majesticdocuments.comStephenville Lights Website: http://www.stephenvillelights.com/Coalition for Freedom of Information: http://www.freedomofinfo.org/Grant Cameron, Canada UFO Researcher: http://www.presidentialufo.com/UFO Evidence: http://www.ufoevidence.org/welcome.aspUFO Casebook: http://www.ufocasebook.com/NUFORC: http://www.nuforc.org/ Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
