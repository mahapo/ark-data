Climate ResearchDirector Steps Down Pending University Inquiry© 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe“If the current [ice melt] trend continues or gets worse,Antarctica could become the latest contributor to sea level rises in the world.It could start to lose more ice than Greenland in a few years.” - Jianli Chen, Ph.D., University of Texas-AustinDecember 2, 2009 Norwich, England - Phil Jones, Ph.D., Director, Climatic ResearchUnit (CRU) and professor in the School of Environmental Sciences, University of EastAnglia in Norwich, England, used the word “trick” to “hide the decline” in a chartdetailing a recent plateau of global temperatures. Dr. Jones's email is among thousands ofpieces of correspondence among various scientists about global climate change data. Dr.Jones argues he used the word “trick” to mean “a clever thing to do.” Furtherembarrassing leaked emails include how to keep scientific work that is critical of a globalwarming trend out of peer-reviewed journals.Phil Jones, Ph.D., Director, Climatic Research Unit (CRU)and Prof. of Environmental Sciences, University of EastAnglia, Norwich, England, stepped down on Tuesday, December 1, 2009,pending the university's independent inquiry about allegations ofscientific misconduct. Image by U. of East Anglia.With the international Copenhagen, Denmark, climate change talks scheduled forDecember 7 to 18, 2009, a House Select Committee Hearing on the State of ClimateScience is being held today by Chairman Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) Speaking before theHouse committee will be John Holdren, Ph.D., Director of the Office of Science andTechnology Policy, and formerly a Harvard University professor and Director of theWoods Hole Research Center. Also speaking will be Jane Lubchenco, Ph.D.,Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), theleading climate office in the United States. Their respective scientific perspectives are thatglobal warming is real and the science indicates that it is getting worse and ice around theplanet is melting faster than expected. NASA/JPL GRACE Satellites Show Arctic,Greenland and Antarctic Ice Melting Faster Than Expected“Ice asks no questions, presents no arguments, reads no newspapers,listens to no debates. It is not burdened by ideology and carries no politicalbaggage as it changes from solid to liquid. It just melts.” - Henry Pollack, Ph.D.,Geophysicist, Univ. of Michigan and Participant, 2007 Nobel Peace Prize"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Ice-flow off the rugged west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula,Antarctica.

Image by NASA.NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites continue makingaerial surveys that indicate the East Antarctic ice sheet is melting faster than expected - 57billion tons of ice a year are melting into the Antarctic seas. GRACE data also shows theGreenland ice sheet melt is accelerating. See: NASA/JPL GRACE.In the November 2009 issue of Nature Geoscience, Jianli Chen, Ph.D., University of Texasin Austin, used NASA GRACE satellite ice surveys between April 2002 and January 2009that confirm the West Antarctic ice sheet is melting rapidly with the loss of 132 billion tonsof ice a year and unexpected and rapid melting in the larger East Antarctic ice sheet nowestimated to be 57 billions tons of more ice melt per year.Dr. Chen reports, “If the current [ice melt] trend continues or gets worse, Antarctica couldbecome the latest contributor to sea level rises in the world. It could start to lose more icethan Greenland in a few years.” See: November 2009 issue Nature Geoscience.

It is very rare to see icebergsfrom Macquari e Island and i s uncommon to fi nd icebergs in thi s general regi on.Image by Eve Merfield, Australian Antarctic Division.Mike Williams, Ph.D., a physicist with the National Institute of Water and AtmosphericResearch, reports that more than 100 icebergs are drifting toward New Zealand at a speedof 16 miles a day (25 kilometers). “I am pretty sure these icebergs came from the break upof the Antarctic Ross Sea Ice Shelf in 2000 and the 2006 melt and break up of an ice shelfthe size of France.” The nearest one, measuring about 330 to 660 feet (100 to 200 meters)long, was 160 miles (260 kilometers) southeast of New Zealand's Stewart Island on November 25, 2009. Giant Jelly Fish Threaten Japanese Fishing IndustryCreatures spreading northward in warming ocean watersA research team led by Japan's Shin-ichi Uye, Ph.D., Professor of Biological Oceanography,Hiroshima University, have been monitoring the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea for jellyfishmovement and found shocking numbers of Echizen jellyfish, also known as Nomura's Jellyfish.Nomura's Jellyfish are huge, up to 6 1/2 feet long and can weigh up to 450 pounds.2009 image by Hiroshima University."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Huge jelly fish are filling nets and stinging valuable fish, destroying Japanesefishermen's catches in northw est Japan's Wakasa Bay. One traw ler in earlyNovember 2009, the Diasan Shinsho-maru, sunk off an eastern Japan coast as the crewwas trying to raise up a net full of many Nomura's jellyfish. 2009 image by Hiroshima University.Large Nomura's jellyfish like warm ocean waters. The Yellow Sea between China, Japanand North and South Korea has warmed 3 degrees F. (1.7 degrees C) in only the past 25years. Until this decade, the big, heavy creatures showed up in Japanese waters only every40 years or so. Now, warming oceans are allowing at least 2,000 jellyfish species to gofurther north in latitudes, including the eerie, orange Nomuras that can weigh up to 450pounds each. Since 2002, as many as 500 million jellyfish have entered Japan's WakasaBay. Normal fish catches have gone down by 30 percent or more as the big and stingingNomura's have loaded down fish nets instead of desired mackerels and sea bass.Nomura jelly fish expert, Shin-ichi Uye, Ph.D., Professor of Biological Oceanography, atHiroshima University says, “The jellyfish are becoming more and more dominant. Theirgrowth rates are quite amazing.” If oceans continue in their warming trend, there will bemore Nomuras and other jelly fish interfering in northern latitude fishing waters.More Information:For further information about global warming, please see Earthfiles Archive (partial listbelow):• 11/20/2009 — Red List of Earth Life Facing Extinction Keeps Growing• 10/30/2009 — How Long Will Our Sun Remain Quiet and Cosmic Rays Increase?• 10/06/2009 — Cosmic Rays Reaching Earth At Highest Level in 50 Years• 06/26/2009 — Mysterious Northeast Bat Deaths Now in 9 States• 02/26/2009 — Unprecedented Northeast Bat Die-off Spreading Rapidly• 10/24/2008 — Rapidly Changing Earth• 08/15/2008 — Amphibian Warning Bell of Mass Extinctions• 06/21/2008 — Updated June 25, 2008: Increasingly Acidic Pacific Coast Waters ThreatenMarine Life• 03/27/2008 — Ice Block Size of Northern Ireland Has Broken From Wilkins Ice Shelf inWest Antarctic Peninsula• 02/29/2008 — Mysterious Bat Deaths in New York, Vermont and Massachusetts• 01/18/2008 — Amphibians Dying Out At Alarming Rate• 12/13/2007 — Update: As CO2 Increases, Carbonic Acid Build Up in Oceans Expected toKill Off Coral Reefs by 2050• 05/18/2007 — Antarctica: Unprecedented Western Ice Melt and CO2-Saturated SouthernOcean• 02/23/2007 — Scientists Hope \"Amphibian Arks\" Can Save Frogs and Toads• 02/23/2007 — Part 1: Earth Life Threats - Alarming Disappearance of Honey Bees• 02/23/2007 — Part 2: Earth Life Threats - \"Noah's Ark\" for World's Seeds• 02/02/2007 — Updated: New U.
