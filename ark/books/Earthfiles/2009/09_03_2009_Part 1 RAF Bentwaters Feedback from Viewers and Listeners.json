Something is flying over our nukesand we have no control over it?”- Steve LaPlume, former RAF Bentwaters Airman 1st Class Updated: September 17, 2009, comments from former RAF Bentwaters Deputy Base CommanderCharles I. Halt: “Ted Conrad [RAF Bentwaters Base Commander] and I never went out into the forest at night. Idid take him and his entire family (wife and two children) out during the day. It was the next dayor two after I was out. I think it was a Sunday. I know we weren't working that day - could havebeen a down day. Steve LaPlume's description sounds very similar to a Woodbridge sighting onGuy Faulks night (in the Fall of 1981). Police 4 and Police 5 (Woodbridge Law EnforcementPatrols) saw a large cigar-shaped object from different locations on the base. They met at thebase of the Woodbridge control tower (inactive at the time) and watched [ large cigar-shapedobject] slowly circle the field and silently move out to sea. They didn't report it at the time asthey remembered all the issues from the earlier incident [ December 26 - 28, 1980] and didn'twant to go through what Penniston and all did. They told me as they were leaving the base for anew assignment and asked me never to reveal their names.\"Steve LaPlume might have Gordon Williams mixed up with [former RAF Base Commander[Ted Conrad. After the first incidents [December 26 - 28, 1980], Williams told me he wanted tobe contacted if anything similar to what we experienced ever occurred. Wendell Palmer andanother cop (could have been LaPlume - I just don't remember) called me at night through LawEnforcement in January 1981 or February 1981 and told me they saw something strange atWoodbridge. They thought it to be a UFO. I called Williams on the hotline and we both went outindependently and met at Woodbridge. I had a Triumph TR-8 at the time and with the top downcould fit under the flight line gates. I called the Bentwaters Tower and got clearance to cross therunway. Williams in his staff car had to drive all the way around. I arrived well before him.“Unfortunately, whatever they saw was gone by the time we got there. We thanked them [Wendell Palmer and Steve LaPlume] and left soon after. If LaPlume were on duty that night (CFlight was working), he would have heard the radio chatter on the police frequency. He mighthave also seen something. I know he was at RAF Bentwaters during the time frame and involvedsome how. Probably the best way to tie this together is to find out if Steve LaPlume was on CFlight then [ January to February 1981] and did he hear Palmer making the calls to the LawEnforcement Desk. If that's the case, it was the same night [ January 13, 1981, that SteveLaPlume talks about in this Earthfiles report.] ”Original Report: September 3, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - I have received many emails frompeople with either firsthand knowledge of the December 26 - 28, 1980, Rendlesham forest light and craftphenomena detailed in Earthfiles 7 parts and after my August 27, 2009, RAF Bentwaters news updates onCoast to Coast AM with George Noory.There are reports before or after December 26 - 28, 1980, that were not reported to the public, except for thenow-famous “Cash-Landrum” case of a diamond-shaped aerial craft descending toward a road andautomobile outside Houston, Texas, on December 29, 1980, only one night after RAF Bentwaters DeputyBase Commander Charles I. Halt encountered lights in the forest, a narrow beam that came down a few feetin front of him and listened to radio reports of one or more beams shining down into the RAF BentwatersWeapons Storage Area (WSA) that included nuclear bombs.Another peculiar aerial phenomenon not widely reported are lights that move in odd up and down motionssimilar to sine waves. One was an unidentified aerial object around midnight in the summer of 1979, overScarborough Pier in North Yorkshire, England. That strangely moving craft also “dropped lights” in the sky.Another similar British report was January 9, 1981, only twelve days after the December 28,1980,Rendlesham forest events described by Col. Charles Halt. On January 9, 1981, RAF Bentwaters Airman 1stClass Steve LaPlume and his military security colleague, Senior Airman Wendelle Palmer, saw an aerial lightmoving up and down in a sine wave motion that neither had ever seen before, followed by their closeencounter with a huge cylinder, or cigar-shaped, aerial craft only a thousand feet above their head at the EastGate between RAF Woodbridge and RAF Bentwaters. 1) Email from Edinburgh, Scotland, Resident Who Talked with UFO Eyewitness"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Subject: UFO “Droppin' Lights” in 1979Date: August 29, 2009To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comEdinburgh Emailer: Summer 1979, a teenage girl with two of her friends had a terrible frightsitting on Scarborough Pier @ midnight.Scarborough is an ancient Bronze Age town on the North Sea coastof North Yorkshire, England, that has had a strong medieval influence, w hichincludes a large 12th Century castle, busy harbor and pier.

Charles Halt andothers. But twelve days later on the night of January 9 - 10, 1981, Airman LaPlume was working with hiscolleague, Sr. Airman Wendell Palmer, who later went on to work for the USAF Office of SpecialInvestigations (AFOSI). First, the two security men saw a bright light moving rapidly up and down in the skyin a sine wave motion. Later, at the East Gate at the back of RAF Woodbridge near Rendlesham forest,LaPlume and Palmer had a relatively close encounter with a cigar-shaped craft that left them both silent andin awe.Four years ago on July 29, 2005, I reported my first interview with Steve LaPlume and his sketch of the lightmoving in a sine wave pattern, reprinted below from Earthfiles Archive. After hearing my August 27, 2009,Coast to Coast AM broadcast about the Bentwaters phenomena, Steve emailed: “I want the truth to come outon this. Do you have any insight as to why no one ever mentions my event which again I feel validates theevents of late Dec 1980?”Part of the answer to LaPlume's question is that he and Airman Palmer did not report the huge, cigar-shapedaerial craft right above them because they did not want the notoriety that had come down on the heads of theother RAF Bentwaters military personnel involved in the December 26 - 28, 1980, phenomena. But LaPlumeand Palmer did report the aerial light moving in the sine wave pattern earlier in the evening and weresurprised by how many people showed up to go back into Rendlesham forest as if the oddly moving light hadsomething to do again with events unfolding in the forest. That night of January 9, 1981, even Col. CharlesHalt showed up, along with the RAF Woodbridge base commander, his wife and son, and the RAFBentwaters/Woodbridge 81st Tactical Fighter Wing Commander, General Gordon Edmund Williams.Steve LaPlume is now 47-years-old and lives with his China-born wife in Shanghai where she is a corporationexecutive and Steve races motorcycles. I first interviewed Steve on July 29, 2005, at his family home inAshburnham, Massachusetts. I am reprinting here that Earthfiles report, followed by his further September 3,2009, comments.Updated: Bentwaters and Rendlesham Forest MysteryBeyond December 1980 © 2005 by Linda Moulton Howe “I think the thing (cylinder-shaped UFO) was a couple of football fields long.That's how big this thing was. The underside was dark and had square shapes on it.”- Steve LaPlume, Former USAF 1st Class Airman, RAF Bentwaters The joint United States and British Royal Air Force Baseat RAF Bentwaters near Woodbridge and the Rendlesham forest northeastof Ipswich near England's southeastern coast.July 29, 2005 - Ashburnham, Massachusetts - Three years ago on November 29, 2002, theBritish Ministry of Defence released for the first time officially 180 pages that had been keptfrom the public for 22 years. The file subject was the several UFO sightings at Rendlesham forestnear RAF Woodbridge/Bentwaters at the end of December 1980. One of the declassifieddocuments began with different dates than the current consensus of December 26 - 28, 1980;however, there is a possibility that yet another UFO event occurred on December 29, 1980,referenced in the Ministry of Defence memo further below:MoD: “We are aware that on 27 and 29 December 1980, a number of personnelfrom RAF (Royal Air Force) Woodbridge saw strange lights in the vicinity of thebase in Rendlesham forest. Lt. Col. Charles Halt USAF, the Deputy BaseCommander, submitted a report on these events, which was passed to the Ministryof Defence.”RAF Bentwaters, December 26 - 28, 1980Christmas to New Year's week in December 1980 was a tense and confusing time for severaldozen men at the joint United States and English Royal Air Force Base at Bentwaters near thesoutheastern coast of the British Isles. In the early morning hours right after Christmas day on"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"December 27, odd lights were seen moving in the Rendlesham forest. Various security andmilitary personnel investigated. And more lights were seen December 28 and 29.Two weeks later, on January 13, 1981, Col. Halt wrote a summary of the Rendlesham incidenton official U. S. Department of Air Force letterhead to the Royal Air Force. The subject was“Unexplained Lights.” January 13, 1981, summary memo written by USAF Lt. Col. Charles I. Halt, BentwatersDeputy Base Commander, about the Rendlesham forest incident of December 26 - 29, 1980.Another memo by the British Ministry of Defence released on its letterhead with the date, namesof the addressee and signature blacked out, stated:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"British Ministry of Defence memo that references “several entitiesnear RAF Bentwaters on the night of December 29/30 1980.”That the MoD memo concluded that the UFO landing in Rendlesham forest was not considered adefense issue because the craft was peacefully and deliberately landing in a series of visits toStrategic Air Command (SAC) bases in the USA and Europe is a startling conclusion. TheAmerican government to this day denies the existence of extraterrestrials and E.T. technologies.What is not included in either the January 13, 1981, dated Col. Halt memo - or the British MoDmemo - is a description of what happened on January 9 to 10, 1981, only five days before Col.Halt wrote his January 13, 1981, memo. The night of January 9, 1981, Col. Halt allegedlyreturned to the Rendlesham forest with a group of officers - and even family members - to watchyet again remarkable moving lights in the sky. But Col. Halt never wrote a memo about the nightof January 9, 1981.Recently a U. S. Air Force security man, who was there, detailed for me what happened thatnight and into the early morning hours of January 9 to 10, 1981. His name is Steve LaPlume. Hewas born in Leominster, Massachusetts, on July 14, 1962. Right after high school, he enlisted inthe U. S. Air Force on July 10, 1980. He first went to Lackland AFB in Texas for technicaltraining in its police academy. Then he was shipped out to RAF Bentwaters in mid-September1980. He was still waiting for his SECRET clearance to come through so he could officially jointhe base security. In the mean time, he was doing shift reliefs and remembers being in the dayroom a few days after Christmas when some airmen came in off duty later than usual. Wordspread that some of them had been chased by a UFO out in the Randlesham forest and peoplestarted making jokes about “little green men and spaceships.”Then two weeks later, USAF Airman 1st Class Steve LaPlume was on patrol at the RAFWoodbridge East Gate with Senior Airman, Wendell Palmer.Interview:Steve LaPlume, former USAF Airman 1st Class, stationed at Bentwaters AFB nearRendlesham Forest in Woodbridge, England, from September 1980 until honorabledischarge in April 1981: “ We were talking about Rendlesham forest and the UFOs and wementioned - I think Palmer brought it up first - that this was where the UFOs had chased thoseguys. (East Gate at back of RAF Woodbridge near Rendlesham.) We weren't even clear on whathappened.We're talking over the hood of the cruiser. We're on either side of the car talking. Behind him, Ilook up. Sometimes in the night, you can see satellites chasing across the sky. I saw what Ithought was a satellite, but it was a bit brighter. Then suddenly, this thing was not chasing acrossthe sky. It was going up and down in the sky from I'm trying to think what elevations it would be.If we used degrees off on the horizon, probably from about 15 degrees off the horizon to about35 to 40 degrees off the horizon, gyrating up and down."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Steve LaPlume's sketch of the light that moved up and down from about 20 degrees abovethe horizon to at least 45 degrees above, as marked on right side of drawing. LaPlume's andPalmer's January 9, 1981, report of this oddly moving light provoked military officers,including RAF Bentwaters Deputy Base Commander Lt. Col. Charles Halt, to returnto Rendlesham forest with cameras. Sketch © 2005 by Steve LaPlume.I said, 'Hey, what the heck is that?' Palmer turned around and we stared at it for a few minutes.He said, 'I don't know. I'll go check and see what's on radar.' So I kept an eye on it and he got inthe cruiser. He went down to the radar tower over at the flight line. He returned, maybe 15minutes later, or maybe only 5 minutes later. And then he said that the only thing that was up inthe air was a couple of helicopters from the paramedic rescue guys and a C-130. So, we bothfigured whatever was making the sky pattern could not be either one of those. Those planes werenot physically capable.At that point he said, 'Do you want to call it in? We have to call it in because they said to if wewere seeing anything goofy over here.' I said, 'OK, fine.' So Palmer got on the radio and insteadof referring to himself, he said, 'LaPlume just saw a UFO.' And then all hell broke loose at thatpoint.LIKE WHAT?Immediately, the security phone rang at the booth. Palmer had given them our location. It rangand it was a Lt. Bruce Englund. He talked with me and asked what I had seen. I explained to himjust what I explained to you what I saw. He said, 'OK, keep an eye on it. There will be someoneout there.'It wasn't ten or fifteen minutes, there were cars and people. There was so much brass there! Ihad just turned 18 and this was my first assignment. I hadn't even been cleared to go in and domy actual job. So, I hadn't had any on-the-job training other than just standing at a post checkingI.D.s. So, I was pretty intimidated. My commander came out, which was my shift commander,Lt. Bruce Englund. My RAF Bentwaters Deputy Base Commander would be Col. Halt. He'dcome over from Bentwaters. He was driving something like an MG midget sports car, orsomething like that. Then also, there were some people that I didn't know from Woodbridge andthey were all like captains and colonels and stuff. One of them had brought his wife and this isthe part I can't get. I don't understand why nobody focuses on this. It totally bewilders me. Thisguy brought out his wife and his teenage kid and they had a Nikon camera. The kid was kind ofcalm, but the wife was very much excited about the whole situation. She had her camera andwas checking it and saying, 'Oh, boy, I hope we get to see one this time.' So someone knewsomething was going on.WHEN THE BRASS SHOWED UP, INCLUDING THE WIFE WITH THE CAMERA, WHEREEXACTLY DID THEY DRIVE AND STOP THEIR CARS?We were at the security East Gate and they jumped into their cars and headed up the road offbase. They got to the end of the road and took a right and after that, I have no idea where theywent.SO, THEY HAD TO EXIT RAF WOODBRIDGE BY GOING THROUGH THE EAST GATE?Correct.THE DIRECTION THEY WENT?Was toward Rendlesham forest.YOU ARE ASSUMING THAT THEY KNEW THAT SOMETHING WAS GOING TO COMETHERE THAT THEY WOULD PHOTOGRAPH?My assumption was that they knew something was up and they knew where to go because theyjumped into the car and left. They didn't ask much. They said, 'Where?' and we pointed off in thedirection we last saw it. Then they jumped into the car and left. I don't know where they went. Ibelieve Palmer and I even commented on it, 'Where are they going? What are they going to look"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"for?' Because we weren't aware of anything landing in the Rendlesham woods.THAT WAS THE NIGHT OF JANUARY 9, 1981?Correct. Lt. Bruce Englund briefed me and said, 'Col. Williams is coming out, just so you know.Don't be nervous. Tell him your post is all safe and secure. Let him know what you saw. And, oh,by the way, Williams just made Brigadier General. Today, they just passed him in Congress.'So, Col. Williams came out who is now General Williams. I did what I was told. They gave us astarlight scope and they all jumped into a blue Air Force station wagon with yellow lettering onthe side that said, 'Air Force.' They jumped into one of those and they all took off toward theRendlesham Woods, which Palmer and I did not understand because this UFO thing was wayhigh in elevation. It had gone over the direction of the woods, but it never went down anywhereto the elevation of the trees or anything like that. So, they all took off in that direction and wewere left standing there with a starlight scope that we fooled around with.Then, they all came back about 45 minutes later and gave no indication that they saw anything.They posted me on that East Gate all night long and told me to report if I saw anything else andthey all left.WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS UNUSUAL AERIAL PHENOMENA WENT ON UNTIL ATLEAST JANUARY 9, 1981, AND THAT HIGH RANKING PEOPLE WENT TORENDLESHAM FOREST WHO SEEMED TO BE EXCITED ABOUT THIS LIGHT MAKINGTHE ODD BEHAVIOR IN THE SKY.Yes, very much excited. Huge Cylinder-Shaped Aerial ObjectNow, the second half of this story is after everybody had left. Palmer had gone to go givebathroom breaks and stuff like that. He came out maybe an hour or so later just to check on meand make sure everything was cool. It was a cold night and so we were hanging on the hood ofhis car talking because it was kind of warm from the heat of the engine.From over where the lighthouse is (Orford), we saw a light coming from that direction that wasbasically making a beeline toward us. It was coming in low and slow and moving along. It wasjust lights at the time. I don't remember white light. I remember kind of a small if I drew itproportionately, it was a blue light, a green light, a red light, and I believe a yellow light. Theblue light seemed to be more prominent than any of the other lights. It was not like there was ared light on the tail and a white light on the sides that you would associate with a regular aircraft.SO WHAT HAPPENED?At the point where the 'vehicle,' I'll call it because I don't know what it was it was probably atleast 1,000 feet above the ground. It came over the trees right up the access road next to therunway. It was up in the sky. I remember it being very long and cylindrical, cigar-shaped. Itcame over our heads and I remember looking underneath and just being awestruck looking up atit and thinking, 'Wow, this is the neatest thing I've ever seen in my life!' It was a physical vehicle.WHAT WERE YOU SEEING EXACTLY IN DETAIL?I remember seeing the underside, which was dark and had shapes like squares. It had physicalshapes. I remember looking at that blue light and the next thing I know, this thing is to the rightof us. It was tracing off into the sky from where we originally saw it before we ever calledanybody and it just got smaller and smaller in the sky as it gradually got higher and higher andblended with the stars and that's the last we saw it.WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN YOUR LOOKING UP AND SEEING THE SQUARESHAPES ON THE BOTTOM AND THEN IT BEING TO THE RIGHT?I have no idea.SO YOU ARE SUGGESTING THAT YOU GUYS MIGHT HAVE MISSING TIME?I honestly don't know. I've sat and thought about that and I don't know whether I've just blockedthose few seconds out, or whether something happened. I honestly can't remember whathappened during that time.HOW CLOSE DO YOU THINK IT WAS ABOVE YOU?Like I said, probably a thousand feet. I remember seeing physical stuff underneath it, but it was avery large structure, too. I really don't have anything to judge it against because it was justagainst the sky and it was big and I didn't have anything to really size it up.IF YOU WERE EXTENDING YOUR ARM RIGHT NOW AND POINTING YOUR INDEXFINGER OUT, WOULD THIS OBJECT HAVE BEEN BIGGER THAN YOUR INDEXFINGER IN THE SKY ABOVE YOU, EVEN IF IT WAS A THOUSAND FEET ABOVE YOU?Oh, this thing was if I put my arms both to the sides of me, it was that big looking up at it. Doesthat make sense?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"IF THIS WAS 1,000 FEET ABOVE YOU, USING YOUR GUESS, YOU ARE SAYING YOUWOULD HAVE TO EXPAND YOUR ARMS...I think the thing (cylinder-shaped UFO) was a couple of football fields long. That's how big thisthing was. The underside was dark and had square shapes on it.COULD YOU SEE ONLY THE BOTTOM? OR COULD YOU SEE AN END?All I could see was the underneath side. That's the part that really kind of goofs me up. Iremember it coming towards us, seeing lights, but I could not see a real good shape until it wasvery close to us and almost over us. I remember seeing that it was cylindrical. The part I waslooking at was like the front half. It wasn't the whole thing. It's like the rest of it was in the dark,and the part I was looking at was lit up. And it was not a very bright, shiny light. It was a pale,dull, pastel-type light. It was long and cylindrical. It was longer than it was wide.WHAT DID YOU AND PALMER SAY TO EACH OTHER?Oh, absolutely nothing. We both looked straight up at that thing and never said a word to eachother.THAT SEEMS STRANGE.I was completely awestruck, 'Whoaa!' There was not one word exchanged until it was offheading into the sky. Either he or I might have said something to the effect, 'Look, it'sdisappearing. You can hardly tell it from a star now.' We made mention of the fact that it was notrecognizable at one point.PALMER DOES NOT HAVE ANY MEMORY OF WHAT HAPPENED WITH THIS HUGETHING ABOVE YOU, EITHER?I don't know. It was very strange. The moments following that, we looked at each other and said,'Do you want to call this in?' I looked at him and said, 'Hell, no!' And he said, 'OK, me neither.'We honestly never talked about that ever since. We did not say one word to each other about it. Inever asked him what he saw and he never asked me what I saw. Absolutely nothing was saidbetween us.YOU DID NOT WANT TO REPORT IT, WHY?We didn't want to report that part because we just thought, 'Forget it! They'll think we're totalfreaks!' I don't know. Maybe it was just fright. The ridicule everybody else got (during theDecember 26-28, 1980, events.)When I got back, my sergeant came up and said, 'What did you see?' I told him about the lightmoving up and down, but I did not tell him about the huge cigar thing. I just told him about thefirst half that's what Palmer and I agreed upon. Then he said, 'OK. You missed the bus. You haveto find your own way back to the barracks.' I had to hitchhike back to the barracks because Iwas late.NOBODY ELSE EVER DEBRIEFED YOU ON ANYTHING?No, absolutely nothing.YOU NEVER HEARD ANYTHING ABOUT THE BRASS WHO WERE OUT THERE ANDSEEMED TO BE EXCITED AND HAD CAMERAS?Never heard anything, no.IN TERMS OF THE HUGE CYLINDER OBJECT, DID ANYONE ELSE IN THEBENTWATERS AND RENDLESHAM SECURITYSEE IT?No one else saw it, which is so strange.MEANING THAT YOU AND PALMER ARE THE ONLY TWO THAT YOU KNOW?That I know of who saw it at the time.BOTH OF YOU CHOSE NOT TO TELL ANYONE?Correct. Larry Warren, Another USAF Eyewitnessof UFO Activity At Rendlesham ForestWHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT LARRY WARREN'S STORY CONCERNING THEUNDERGROUND FACILITY....[ Editor's Note: Larry Warren was a USAF Security Specialist at RAF Bentwaters inDecember 1980, and described dramatic UFO events, including underground debriefingwith military film of UFOs, in his co-authored book with writer, Peter Robbins. Left AtEast Gate: A First-hand Account of the Bentwaters-Woodbridge UFO Incident,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Its Cover-Up, and Investigation © 1997 by Larry Warren and Peter Robbins.Available at amazon.com. ]The only thing I heard was from Larry Warren. He came into my dorm room after my January10, huge cigar-shaped craft incident because he heard I saw something. He closed the door andwe locked it and sat and talked. He said, 'I want to tell you what happened to me because I knowsomething happened to you. We're kind of in the same boat.' He seemed very frightened, orconcerned, about his safety. He told me about the first night he saw something which when hedescribed it to me, he was walking back to base with someone else and he saw something in thesky. He told me about the lights exploding apart and coming back together to form one ship, orsomething to that effect.Then he said that someone with a badge came up to him. I believe he said it was the USAF OSI(Office of Special Investigations). They debriefed Larry and told him he had seen nothing.The next thing I know he said there was another night where they were trying to get the light-allsgoing, nothing was working, they had trouble getting the fuel pumps to work to get the gas intothe light-alls. The trucks weren't working right. But they lit up the area, he told me, pretty muchthe same story he's been telling for 20 some years that General Gordon Williams was there. Hesaid something about someone falling into the mud. I don't know if it was Williams or someoneelse. Everybody was around this craft, some closer than others. Some men were crying. Somewere just standing there. He told me it was a Colonel who had gone up to talk to these beings andthey weren't talking and using voices. They were communicating in some other way. Hedescribed the beings: he said they were floating outside the craft and they looked like 'kids insnowsuits.' That is a direct quote from Larry Warren. That's all he could think of, that they werekids in snowsuits.Steve LaPlume is now a businessman based in China. He contacted me to tell his story in detailnow because he's always wondered why Col. Halt, other brass and even the wife and child hadcameras and were so excited the evening of January 9, 1981, in Rendlesham forest.If anyone has more firsthand information about what happened in Rendlesham forest on January9 to 10, 1981, please contact me at earthfiles@earthfiles.com.

HALT ANDYOU HEARD HIM SAY THERE WERE INTELLIGENTLY OPERATING MACHINES IN THERENDLESHAM FOREST THAT WERE ‘EXTRATERRESTRIAL IN ORIGIN,’ WERE YOU SURPRISED?Oh, yes, absolutely surprised because Col. Halt has never come close to admitting with that much clarity thatwhat he saw was something extraterrestrial. As far as I know, Palmer and I also saw a UFO craft and so dideverybody else. But I still have no idea what we saw or anything else other than I saw something.COULD YOU HEAR ANY SOUND COMING FROM THE CYLINDRICAL, CIGAR-SHAPED CRAFT?No, I couldn’t. And you want to know something? I couldn’t hear anything – no noises of the night, nocrickets or whatever. I just remember looking up at this thing – it was a real foggy view on the underside ofthis thing and it was deadly quiet. I don’t remember my hearing coming back until after the thing had goneoff into the sky and Palmer and I started talking again.I WONDER WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN THE GLASSY TRIANGLE ON THE GROUNDOF RENDLESHAM FOREST THAT STAFF SERGEANT JIM PENNISTON TOUCHED ON THE NIGHTOF DECEMBER 26, AND A WEEK AND A HALF LATER ON JANUARY 9, 1981, YOU AND PALMERSEE A HUGE, CYLINDRICAL UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT HOVERING ONLY 1,000 FEETABOVE YOUR HEADS AT THE EAST GATE.Yes. I could not hear any sound whatsoever. I don’t remember hearing anything. If Palmer was talking, Inever heard him. If the birds were chirping, I never heard them. I just remember staring up at this thing intotal awe!HOW LONG DO YOU THINK YOU AND PALMER WATCHED IT ABOVE YOU?Well, from the time I realized it was not an airplane and was over the Rendlesham forest to the time wherewe were standing and it was over our heads, it would have taken maybe twenty seconds. And then when itwas over our heads, I don’t think it was over ten seconds.SO AT LEAST A 30-SECOND-SIGHTING. THEN WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?It moved off towards our right and went up into the sky slowly, maybe at a 25 degree angle, and it justclimbed in elevation and eventually went from something that looked like a craft to something that lookedlike a star and faded in with the stars. I remember watching it go into a star cluster up there.This was not of this Earth.
