Return to Updated Part 1August 23, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - The Writers' list of ancient and modernbooks concerning spiritual warfare with negative forces in the unseen included CampbellThompson's Volume 2 of The Devils and Evil Spirits of Babylonia: “Fever Sickness andHeadache, Etc.” ©1904. Given the reptilian humanoid sculptures in Volume 1, it isnoteworthy that in Thompson's list of the 6,000-year-old Sumerian tablets from which hisbook emerged, there is this description:“A group of tablets which contain descriptions of a number of supernaturalbeings, which corresponded roughly to the modern Arabic Jinn and Jann. Theidentification of the greater number of these is difficult; among those worthyof special note is the goddess NIN-TU, who is said to wear an elaborate tiaraand veil and to be girt about the loins with a zone or garment, her breast beinguncovered. The upper part of her body is that of a naked woman, and thelower part is said to be scaly like the skin of a snake.“It is important from many points of view to observe that she is representedsuckling her babe at the left breast. In the course of excavations, which havebeen made in Assyria during the last fifty years (1850 to 1900), numbers ofclay figures possessing the characteristics described above have beenfound...”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Left: Sumerian goddess figurine from Ubaid in Mesopotamia c. 5000 B.

January 24, 1992 - Writers First Talkwith Ray Boeche in NebraskaTwo years before I received my first June 21, 1994, floppy disc from the Writers throughRay Boeche in Nebraska, Ray had his first face-to-face meeting with them. Ray is auniversity computer graphics professional and privately has investigated UFO phenomenafor a long time. The men introduced themselves to Ray as working in intelligence for theDepartment of Defense and were interested in sharing information they thought relevant toRay's research, his work in a local Protestant church and devotion to Christ.The date was January 24, 1992, and Ray later wrote in his notes about that meeting,“Presentation seemed very much ‘scripted’ as if the men were presenting materialmemorized from master script. Presentation was deliberately slow enough to allow me totake notes almost verbatim, except for portions when I was told to cease writing.”Ray Boeche has now given me permission to include some of his January 24, 1992,summary notes of that first meeting with the Writers.Ray Boeche: One leading American researcher stated that a division exists in thefield of paranormal research between “black” and “white” projects, but maintains thatthere are no “good” paranormal research efforts because “the occult is inherentlyevil.” There is a growing awareness that this type of research is very dangerous, notonly in a physical sense, but “in a spiritual sense as well.” Whatever doesn't comefrom God is evil, and Satan can counterfeit many of God's miraculous actions.\"Research is being done on teleportation, healing, extracting information from thebrains of dead subjects, remote viewing, developing computers with the ability tointerpret and record the waveforms of thoughts, enabling them to be recorded and ortransmitted.Several projects have been designed to study “negative healing,” the psychic inflictionof pain, injury and death. Proposed Mechanism of Paranormal Events,Based on the Research of Physicist David Bohm,Author of Wholeness and the Implicate Order © 1981Take 2 glass cylinders, one smaller than the other. Place the smaller inside the largerand fill the space between with glycerine, a colorless, thick, viscous fluid. Introduce adrop of ink into the glycerine and revolve the outer cylinder. As you do, the ink willstretch into a thread, growing longer, thinner and fainter, until it completelydisappears.The ink is now enfolded into the glycerine - you can no longer see it, but you know it'sthere. Where is it? It is no longer in any single position. It is spread out, nowhere andeverywhere."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In extensive research, here and abroad, there is much evidence to suggest thateverything that exits today, or ever did exist, is similarly enfolded in an invisiblemedium. We become aware of things only when they are unfolded out of the invisiblemedium into our reality.Now, if you reverse the direction of the cylinders, the thread of ink begins toreappear, much as if a film of the enfolding process were being run backward.One could enfold any number of ink droplets into the medium and by turning thecylinder backward very rapidly, they would suddenly appear as if out of nowhere.This is the mechanism of how we become aware of the reality of our world.Enfolding and unenfolding the ink drops in the glycerine is comparable to enfolding andunenfolding an object backward and forward through time and space. Everythingexists everywhere at once, enfolded into an invisible, seemingly timeless medium.Any object you could imagine might not be visible to you right now, but nevertheless, aportion of it exists with you, invisibly enfolded, just as the ink drop existed invisiblyenfolded throughout the glycerine.When you throw a pebble into a pond, the ripples expand from the point the pebblestrikes the water, hit the edge of the pond, create more ripples that move backtoward the center of the pool, and all these ripples run into each other and the pointsat which they cross are called interferences.If you could suddenly freeze the pond, the points at which the ripples interfered witheach other would provide information about the weight, shape and movement of thepebble that caused them. Theoretically, you would have enough information to actuallycreate a 3-dimensional representation of the pebble.This is exactly the principle behind the hologram. Every point in a hologram containsthe entire picture, just as in our first example, every point in the glycerine containedink. What this means, to go back to our other analogy, is that to form a picture of thepebble, we don't have to have all the points where the ripples interfered with eachother. We need only some of them, perhaps only one of them.Highly complex wave patterns can be reduced to a collection of simple waves that canbe represented numerically. These numbers are called Fourier components and thetransformation of those waves into these numerical components is called a Fouriertransform.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia -Fourier transform on Euclidean space.“In mathematics, the Fourier transform (often abbreviated FT) isan operation that transforms one complex-valued function of areal variable into another. In such applications as signalprocessing, the domain of the original function is typically timeand is accordingly called the time domain. That of the newfunction is frequency, and so the Fourier transform is often calledthe frequency domain representation of the original function.For instance, a note played on a flute is reasonably pure: a singlefrequency with only minor overtones, which are additional,related frequencies. It may be envisaged as a simple repeatingwave; a sine wave, because of the relative absence of suchovertones. But the same note played on an oboe or guitar wouldhave a somewhat shriller sound, caused by a higher level ofovertones. It would appear visually more complex, because of thesignificant presence of such overtones. In this example, a Fouriertransform is the representation of the frequencies (and theiramplitudes) present in that note of that instrument. For the flutenote it would be approximately a single vertical line at the singlefrequency; for the oboe note there would be additional, smaller(lower amplitude) vertical lines representing the overtones.It is also possible to generalize the Fourier transform on discretestructures such as finite groups, efficient computation of whichthrough a fast Fourier transform is essential for high-speedcomputing.” ]Using this process, we can search the enfolding medium of space and time for theFourier components of any object, forward or backward through time. Everything thathas ever existed in the universe has produced lasting interference patterns in the seaof radiation crated at the instant God said, “Let there be light.”"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Holography and Fourier transforms are simply a way of separating an image from itsobject, then viewing the image at a distance. Your mind actually does this every timeyou remember something. You see the image in your mind, though the object itself issomewhere else, distant in time and space.There is quite probably more than one medium. Each is itself enfolded within another,a regressing series of enfolding media. The ultimate medium, the one into whicheverything is enfolded, is not a medium at all. It is a Person, the Creator,transcendent and existing prior to His creation.The world is composed, in one sense, of interference patterns - of frequencies. Justas the frequency of music over the radio can be disrupted by a static-inducingappliance in the next room, the frequency of things in this world can be interfered withby disruptive static frequencies. If any object is characterized by - that is, it is theproduct of - certain frequencies, certain Fourier components, then it will be altered ifthose frequencies are altered.The human brain itself constantly performs Fourier analysis on all the interferencepatterns in the enfolding medium. The universe itself is a hologram, and the brain ispart of that hologram. The brain contains all of space and time, just as each fragmentof a hologram contains the entire picture. If you had full access to the content of yourbrain, you'd be able to see everything.This is how the paranormal works. That's how psychics know what is happeningremotely. And by interfering with the Fourier components of objects, whetherinanimate or living cells, they can heal, induce illness or influence electroniccomponents or the roll of dice. Their minds are tuned to the universal hologram - theyhave access to all the Fourier components. All human brains perform Fourier analysis,and some can access the Fourier transforms to achieve paranormal feats. Thesefeats, performed by humans, are unreliable and unquantifiable.However, a psychotronic device could perform these functions better than humans,much as a computer performs mathematical functions better than humans. In additionto being able to see and predict, to perform these passive functions, the device wouldalso be able to exert an effect upon both animate and inanimate objects.Psychokinetic capability appears to follow an inverse-square law - that is, the degreeof motion which can be caused, decreases as the square of the mass of the affectedbody.What is being attempted is to electronically recognize frequency interference patternsin space, screen them for the desired Fourier components, transform the componentsinto viewable holographic images, and then sharpen these images with holographicimage deblurring.In this way, you can see anything you want, particularly with laser assistance. Thepsychotronic device operates by performing Fourier transforms on backgroundradiation. This is achieved by analysis of laser radiation. Light from an airborneexcimer laser can easily penetrate cloud cover and seawater, for instance. Largeareas of ocean, to a depth of several thousand feet, could be scanned. By analyzingthe laser return from molecules ejected by a submarine, for instance, one could tellhow many and what type of missiles are aboard, how many men in the crew and soon.Laser radiation can be used to observe electrons moving in silicon chips. thepsychotronic device could divert those electrons. It has the potential capability todefeat any computer, every electronic or mechanical device, using nothing more thanthe natural radiation present everywhere in the universe - electromagnetic radiation.These Fourier components can be stored like any other numerical data. Aftercapturing the interference patterns, the entire “imaging process” is computerized, sosaving and transmitting the data would be routine.”[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “The akashic records (akasha is aSanskrit word meaning sky, space or aether) is a term used intheosophy (and Anthroposophy) to describe a compendium ofmystical knowledge encoded in a non-physical plane of existence.These records are described to contain all knowledge of humanexperience and the history of the cosmos. They aremetaphorically described as a library and other analoguescommonly found in discourse on the subject include a “universalcomputer” and the “Mind of God.” Descriptions of the recordsassert that they are constantly updated and that they can beaccessed through astral projection.” ] Continued in Part 9.Return to Updated Part 1"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"For further reports about non-human entities, please see reports in the 1999 - 2009Earthfiles Archive (partial list below) and my books An Alien Harvest and the 2-volumeGlimpses of Other Realities in the Earthfiles Shop.• 08/14/2009 — Part 7: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 07/20/2009 — Part 6: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 07/19/2009 — Part 2: 1980 RAF Bentwaters Lights and Craft Were “Extraterrestrial InOrigin”• 07/17/2009 — Part 1: 1980 RAF Bentwaters Lights and Craft Were “Extraterrestrial InOrigin”• 07/14/2009 — Part 5: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 07/06/2009 — Part 4: Non-Human Entities (NHEs):• 06/25/2009 — Part 3: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 06/21/2009 — Part 2: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 06/17/2009 — Part 1: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged GovernmentInsiders• 06/01/2009 — Part 10: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 05/26/2009 — Part 9: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 05/13/2009 — Part 8: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 05/05/2009 — Part 7: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 04/29/2009 — Part 6: High Strangeness Files about EBENs• 04/21/2009 — Archive Reprint: Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell Says GovernmentsCovering Up E.
