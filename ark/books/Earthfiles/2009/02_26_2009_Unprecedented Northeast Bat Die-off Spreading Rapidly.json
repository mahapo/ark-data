Could Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee Be Next?© 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe“People are starting to comb through old historic records to see,but there is no evidence that I know of anywhere in the fossil record,or in recent recorded history, of a die-off of this nature in bats.”– DeeAnn Reeder, Ph.D., Bucknell University Little Brown Bat hibernating in West Virginia cave has white ring of the fungalgenus Geomyces around its nose and on its ears.

February 26, 2009 Vicksburg, Mississippi and Lewisburg, Pennsylvania - One yearago in February 2008, I reported at my news website, Earthfiles.com, about thousands ofsick and dead cave-dwelling bats in New York, Vermont and Massachusetts. [ See 022908Earthfiles.]Now, one year later in February 2009, the deaths have spread to at least eight states andthe exact cause is still not proved. But the one persistent symptom on the sick and deadbats is a white substance around the noses and faces of the sick and dead bats. Only fourmonths ago in October 2008, lab analysis confirmed the white stuff is a fungus in thegenus, Geomyces. That fungus loves cold temperatures in the Arctic and apparently inNortheastern winter caves. However, no one had ever heard of the fungus killing batsbefore now. The mortality rate is nearly 100% and there is nothing in the global scientificliterature about bats dying with white fungus rings around their noses. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - “Geomyces is a genus of filamentous fungus inthe family Myxotrichaceae. Members of the genus are widespread indistribution, especially in northern temperate regions. Known to bepscychrotolerant and associated with Arctic permafrost soils, they are equallyprevalent in the air of domestic dwellings, and children's sandpits. TheGeomyces are keratinophilic fungi, able to degrade hairs and nails. They have"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"been investigated for possible use in the biodecomposition of waste poultryfeathers.A 2008 study of ‘white-nose syndrome’ in bats implicates the Geomyces genusof fungi found on the muzzles, wings and ears of infected cave-dwelling bats,now spread to eight states in the Northeast. It is not yet certain if the fungus isa causative agent in the bat deaths, or merely an opportunistic pathogen. It isknown, however, that Geomyces species are found in caves and bathibernacula.” ]But that’s exactly what was first discovered in the winter of 2006-2007 in two caves westof Albany, New York. Other physical anomalies common to each dead bat carcass is littleor no fat. Winter is when bats hibernate in caves and mines. To survive cold wintertemperatures, the bats eat as much as possible to build up fat reserves before spending afew months in hibernation hanging upside down close together to share body heat. Bats getso close to each other during hibernation that in the case of Little Brown Bats, 300 of thempack into a square-foot space. Hibernating so closely together, also means that bats canspread disease quickly.Hibernating Little Brown Bats crowded together to keep warm,about 300 animals per square foot. Image © 2007 by Alan Hicks.Now, by February 2009, the white-nose syndrome has expanded beyond New York,Vermont and Massachusetts to five more Northeastern states: Pennsylvania, West Virginia,New Jersey, Connecticut, and New Hampshire.

Image © 2008 by Craig W. Stihler,Ph.D., West Virginia Dept. of Natural Resources.On February 20, 2009, a group of scientists trying to figure out what exactly is killing allthe cave-dwelling bats and how to stop the killer, gathered in a web meeting to talk abouttheir latest research data. One of the scientists is Eric Britzke, Ph.D., Research WildlifeBiologist for the U.S. Army Engineer Research and Development Center, Vicksburg,Mississippi. He has coordinated a research project to put temperature-sensitivetransmitters on bats in hibernation to determine how often and for how long the bats withwhite-nosed syndrome are waking up from hibernation compared with normal, unaffectedbats.Eric Britzke, Ph.D., Research Wildlife Biologist for U. S. Army Engineer Researchand Development Center in Vicksburg, Mississippi, placed a temperature-sensitivetransmitter on a healthy Little Brown Bat to monitor how often it wakes up in its normalhibernation to compare to Little Brown Bats that show the white-nosefungus syndrome. Image courtesy Eric Britzke.Dr. Britzke's preliminary conclusion is that the sick bats are waking up more often andleaving their hibernation caves, perhaps in desperation before death. But what is causingthe sick bats to wake up and move prematurely, using up their precious fat supplies?Interview:Eric Britzke, Ph.D., Research Wildlife Biologist, U.S. Army Engineer Research andDevelopment Center, Vicksburg, Mississippi: “The main thought is that the fungalgenus, Geomyces, is probably the primary pathogen just because we have nothing else togo on. So, the hope is that fungus is the primary pathogen because really what we need todo first is locate that primary pathogen and then go from there. If the fungus is a secondarypathogen, then we basically know nothing about the white-nose syndrome and we arestarting over from scratch again. Meanwhile, thousands and thousands of bats are dying.IF YOU ALL ARE STILL AT THE STATE WHERE YOU’RE NOT CERTAIN WHAT ISKILLING ALL THESE BATS, THEN EVEN IF IT COMES OUT TO BE THIS FUNGUS,IT’S GOING TO TAKE WHAT? – A YEAR, OR TWO, OR THREE TO FIGURE OUTHOW TO ATTACK THE FUNGUS?You’re right - we don’t know that we can stop it, even if we know what it is. So, theremight be nothing we can do. Most bat researchers are very pessimistic that we’re going tobe able to contain this in the short term.These bats ate millions of tons of insects each year and now these bats aren’t going to beout on the landscape controlling insect populations. Instead of the white-nose fungusaffecting only bats, the fungus is really affecting the whole ecosystem in the Northeast andit will just continue to get worse and worse as this progresses.” A bat zoologist also participated in the white nose fungus and bat death meeting onFebruary 20. She is DeeAnn Reeder, Ph.D., Asst. Prof. of Biology from BucknellUniversity in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. As a bat expert, she is very surprised by the rapidspread of the mysterious bat deaths throughout the Northeast.Interview:"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"DeeAnn Reeder, Ph.D., Asst. Prof. of Biology, Dept. of Biology, Bucknell University,Lewisburg, Pennsylvania: “It’s spread faster than anyone thought that it would. The batsare starving to death. We do know now they have less body fat. There is some evidence –even though everything yesterday was pretty preliminary – evidence that the bat immunesystems – in my lab, we know their immune systems in the winter are compromisedanyway and that the white nose-infected bats are mounting some kind of immune responseto an attack. So, the bats are clearly challenged at this point.One of the things that might be coming out of it is that some of the detriment to theanimals – particularly those that make it through the winter and then are dying in thesummer – is that the fungus is damaging their wing membranes pretty significantly, so thatwe have bats flying in April and May that might not be able to get enough to eat becausetheir flying is hampered. Their wing membrane is only a cell or two thick – it’s very thin.The fungal genus, Geomyces, looks like white powder on the very thin wingof an infected bat in February 2008. Image © 2008 by Craig W. Stihler,Ph.D., West Virginia Dept. of Natural Resources.When the fungus gets in there, it can destroy that tissue. So, we’re seeing bats in thesummers with wings that look pretty bad and we think that might be contributing tomortality. So, even those bats that survive the winter are having lingering effects.The Geomyces fungus looks very strongly like it might be the pathogen, but we want tomake sure that we’re not ignoring other possibilities. So, people talk about continueddiagnostic work and the need to continue to look for bacteria or viruses or whatever elsemight be happening. The risk is that if we focus on the fungus too much and it’s not it, thenwe’ve lost valuable time thinking about what else it could be. Is Geomyces Fungus the Primaryor Secondary Infection?BATS HAVE BEEN ON THIS PLANET FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS. FUNGI HAVEBEEN ON THIS PLANET FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS. WHY IS IT THAT SUDDENLYIN 2007 THAT A FUNGUS WOULD BE ABLE TO START DECIMATING HUNDREDSOF THOUSANDS OF BATS IN THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES?Almost all of my talks start with bats have been here for millions of years. They haveevolved an ability to not only survive, but to thrive in really harsh environments. They arereally tough little critters. And now I have to stop saying that. They’re a couple ofpossibilities: one is that this is something truly new that they don’t have any capacity todeal with. It could be an invasive species. It could have come here from Europe. It couldhave come here from anywhere and our bats don’t have the capacity to fight it off. That’sone possibility.The other possibility is that the fungus is just a secondary infection – that these animals(bats) are sick from something else because fungal infections don’t typically kill organisms.The Chytrid fungus now killing amphibians is a unique exception to that.CHYTRID FUNGUS IS TAKING OUT THE AMPHIBIANS NOW."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “The chytrids are the most primitive of the fungiand are mostly saprobic, which means the fungus eats chitin and keratin.Many chytrids are aquatic and found in fresh water. There are approximately1,000 chytrid species, in 127 genera, distributed among five orders. Thechytrid fungus, Batrachchytrium dendrobatidisis responsible for a recentlydiscovered disease of amphibians known as chytridiomycosis. Discovered in1998 in Australia and Panama, this disease is known to kill amphibians inlarge numbers, and might be the principal cause for the worldwide amphibiandecline since the 1990s. However, the precise cause and process of theamphibian deaths is still unknown. ]Yes, but normally fungi tend to be infections on animals that are already immune-compromised for some reason. So, it could be that these bats have a novel bacteria or virusor something else that’s making them sick and their weakened immune systems allow thefungus to grow.So, there are a couple of different ideas, but that has been one of the biggest questions: Why now? Why now and why here?Is the fungus truly novel? Or is the fungus found in all of these caves anyway and now forsome reason, something else has happened to the bats? Bats, Honey Bees and AmphibianDie-Offs All At Same TimeTHAT SIGNALS THE QUESTION: WHAT COULD BE GOING ON IN THEENVIRONMENT OF THE U. S. AND THE PLANET THAT THERE IS COLONYCOLLAPSE DISORDER OF THE BEES, THE BATS ARE DYING OUT AND THECHYTRID FUNGUS IS TAKING OUT THE AMPHIBIANS? ALL OF THIS ISHAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME.Yes, absolutely. I expect it in Ohio next year, maybe Kentucky, maybe Tennessee. Yeah, ifit follows the pattern that it did this year in which it spread more than we thought it would,I expect we’ll have it in those other states next year.IF IT SPREADS ACROSS THE WHOLE UNITED STATES, WHAT ARE THEIMPLICATIONS?Insect populations are going to go crazy! These cave-dwelling bats that are affected bywhite-nose fungus are insectivores. So, the service that they play, the role that they play inthe ecosystem is to remove insects from the environment. So, when you look at themillions of bats in the U. S., you’re talking about each bat eating up to 100% of its bodyweight every night in insects in the summer. So, you’re talking about massive numbers ofinsects that are removed and the impact on the ecosystem is going to be huge. Without Bat Decline,Will Insect Populations Explode?WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WITH THE INSECT POPULATION?It’s going to go sky high! It’s going to explode. We’re talking about agricultural pests.We’re talking about mosquitoes. And that’s going to ripple through the ecosystem. And Isaid this to my colleague, Greg Turner, the other day, ‘You know, I’m not usually a ‘sky isfalling’ kind of person.’ And Greg said, ‘But you know the sky is falling.’ And I said,‘Yeah, I agree.’ It’s really tragic and I, quite frankly, don’t see it being stopped at themoment. Then it might start dominoing or rippling through the ecosystem at multiplelevels. It’s really almost hard to predict. But the sky is kind of falling.HAS ANYBODY EVER SEEN A DIE-OFF OF BATS LIKE THIS BEFORE?No. No, and in fact, people are starting to comb through old historic records to see, butthere is no evidence that I know of anywhere in the fossil record, or in recent recordedhistory, of a die-off of this nature in bats.SO, THIS IS UNPRECEDENTED?Yes, absolutely."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"BATS ARE ONE IN FIVE OF ALL MAMMAL SPECIES?Yeah, one in five of all mammal species, so there are a little over 1,200 species of bats [about 5,500 species of mammals].BATS HAVE BEEN AROUND FOR MILLIONS OF YEARS AND SUDDENLY, THEYSTART DYING MYSTERIOUSLY AND IT’S SPREADING THROUGHOUT THE EASTCOAST.Yeah, like wildfire! It’s just at a level that is unprecedented and it’s disheartening. I hopethat somewhere along the way, there are some epiphanies – you know, some ‘Aha!’moments and we say, ‘Maybe we can hit it with this.’ We need to figure out how we cancontrol it right now, even before we understand it. How can we begin to control it? How Is Fungus Spreading?IF THE FUNGUS IN ALL EIGHT STATES SAMPLED SO FAR IS IDENTICAL, HOW ISTHE FUNGUS SPREADING AND WHY IS IT KILLING THE BATS?The fungus is spread by spores into the environment. Fungal spores are meant to be sort ofpuffed out into the air and then they would be picked up by another animal and then itcould start to grow and get into the skin of the animal and makes more spores. So, thespores are aerosolized. They go through the air and land on another animal.You know, these bats cluster together. They cluster in groups of hundreds together reallytightly [ for winter hibernation].YOU ALL HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS HAPPEN BEFORE, SO HOW IS THE FUNGUSDOING THIS?If it’s the fungus, the fungus has undergone some sort of change. There has been amutation somewhere along this fungal lineage that now gives it the characteristic that itwould need to be a pathogen. That jump from something that’s not a pathogen to apathogen – that happens. We know that happens in infectious diseases. Natural selectionworks on mutations in DNA. And so as those mutations happen, sometimes you getorganisms that are able to do something better – like invade a host and make an animalsick. Then that fungus would be more successful, and so that fungal lineage continues. Butit’s basically evolution by natural selection is what is responsible for infectious diseases. Global Travel Spreads DiseasesAnother thing that I think contributes is the globalization of our societies. Cavers travelaround the world. So, this is something that could be bats in Europe, for example, areresistant to and was brought here to the United States and our bats have no resistance. It’slike when the Europeans brought small pox to the Native Americans. You know, you havesomething that a certain population of animals can deal with just fine because theyco-evolved with it and know how to fight it off. And then you transplant that pathogen to anew place where those animals have no resistance. That would explain why this just cameout of nowhere and is hitting hard and fast. This could be an invasive species of some sort. Will Bat Die-Offs Spread to Canada,Mid-West and West?AS A BAT ZOOLOGIST, WHAT IS YOUR GUT INSTINCT ABOUT HOW THIS ISGOING TO PLAY OUT FOR THE NEXT TWO TO FIVE YEARS?I think we are going to see mass mortality across most of the Northeast. And I think wewill begin to see resistance. I think we will see some sites (caves) where animals are doingjust fine. And then it will take decades to rebuild populations. But I think we are going tobe behind the 8 ball for a few years. We’re going to be just counting the dead bats anddoing our best to figure it out and then hopefully in a few years, we’ll have a bit bettersense of it. There are a lot of people working real hard on it, but it’s not an easy question.SO, THE PROGNOSIS IS THAT FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT FEW YEARS, BATDIE-OFFS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE ALONG THE EAST COAST IN WAVES INTOTHE CENTRAL UNITED STATES AND MAYBE EVEN AS FAR AS THE WEST?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Yes, this has that potential. Absolutely! I’m hoping that if it’s (cause) truly the cold-lovingfungus that that will keep the fungus spread out of the South because the bats there don’tgo into prolong hibernation like they do here. So, the hope is that the die-offs will beconfined to the longer hibernating bats.BUT IT’S HARD TO IMAGINE THE NORTHEAST WITH ALL OF ITS HUMIDITYWITHOUT BATS CONTROLLING INSECTS.Absolutely! And it’s probably going to be in Canada – wherever bats hibernate.HAS THERE BEEN ANY INFORMATION FROM CANADA?I don’t believe they have it yet. We do have several Canadian colleagues in the group –yeah, and as far as I know, it’s not yet documented in any of the Canadian sites. Worst Case: 90% Mortalityin Northeast Cave-Dwelling Bats and Westward SpreadWHAT IS YOUR BOTTOM LINE ON THE WORST CASE THAT COULD EVOLVEOUT OF THE SITUATION FROM NOW GOING FORWARD?I think the worst case is that in the next five years, we might have up to 90% mortality inthe cave-dwelling bats in the Northeast and that it will continue to spread to the South andthe West where ever bats are hibernating. I’m sure hoping I’m wrong!LOSING 90% OF THE BATS!Yes. Tons and tons and tons of insects that are going to be in the environment that did notuse to be because the bats are not eating them.IT ALMOST SOUNDS BIBLICAL! (LAUGHS)Yes, like the locust. Yeah, it is – it’s huge!WHAT DOES YOUR GUT TELL YOU IS THE ANSWER TO THIS?My gut all along has said fungi don’t kill animals, but I’m moving towards changing that. Ithink the fact that we keep getting all these genetic isolates of the same fungus – it’s prettydarn suggestive (that the fungus is the culprit.)UP UNTIL NOW AND THIS UNPRECEDENTED DIE-OFF OF BATS, A FUNGUS WASLOOKED AT MORE OF AN OPPORTUNIST ON THINGS THAT WERE ALREADYSICK.Absolutely. That’s what fungi typically do. Fungi rarely kill animals.IF THIS WHITE-NOSE FUNGUS IS THE SMOKING GUN IN THISUNPRECEDENTED BAT DIE-OFF, IT MEANS THAT SOMETHINGFUNDAMENTALLY HAS CHANGED IN THE FUNGUS’S ABILITY TO ATTACKCREATURES THAT ARE OTHERWISE HEALTHY.Yes. We know so very little about fungi. Only about 10% are actually classified or can bestudied, so I’m not sure about that. But what I think is that other things are happening suchthat fungi are being able to take a better hold.THAT THERE IS ENVIRONMENTAL DETERIORATION.Something. Something else is happening and it could be environmental things. It could bethe fact that we are such a global society now. We all travel all around the world.” Since the Indiana Bat is on the Endangered Species list, the mammal specialist in NewYork’s Endangered Species Program in the Department of Environmental Conservation isdeeply involved in trying to find out what is causing the rapidly spreading bat deaths.
