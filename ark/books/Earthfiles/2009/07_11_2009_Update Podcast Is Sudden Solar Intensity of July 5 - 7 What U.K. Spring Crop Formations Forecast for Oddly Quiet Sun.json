It is big,complex, and rapidly growing. The magnetic polarity of the sunspot, revealed by SOHOmagnetograms, show that it is a member of new Solar Cycle 24.”Update July 11, 2009 Podcast / July 8, 2009 Timberlake, North Carolina - A yearago on June 7, 2008, I received an email from a man who retired from an astrophysicscareer and is now a semi-retired technology consultant for electronic and electro-opticsindustries, living in Timberlake, North Carolina. Mike Reed worked at the University ofArizona in Tucson on the Multi-Mirror Telescope (MMT) at Mt. Hopkins, a joint venturewith the Harvard Smithsonian Observatory. He had been studying an aerial photograph ofthe June 1, 2008, formation in barley at Barbury Castle, Wiltshire, England, and emailedme his discovery."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"June 5, 2008 from Mike Reed:“ Hello Earthfiles,“On looking at the Barbary Castle pattern, the ratio of the angles of the radialjumps is apparently the first ten (10) digits of the mathematical constant Pi to3.141592654. [ Pi is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter].“The fact that the Pi decimal point is included and there is rounding up to 10decimal places is to me a little mind boggling!”Yellow graphic overlay created by Earthfiles viewer Steve McMathbased on June 5, 2008, Michael Reed drawing for Earthfiles.com.An Australian scientist, who requests anonymity, contacted Mike Reed about the Pidiscovery and the two men continued a collaboration in analyses of other 2008 cropformation patterns. When the spring 2009 crop patterns in England started April 14, 2009,at The Ridgeway near Avebury, the scientists proposed the pattern was a megalithicsundial that was followed soon after at the West Kennett Longbarrow, also near Avebury,by what might be a solar eclipse counter based on Mayan glyphs and symbols. Then camea large and precisely defined “sunburst” at Rutland's Farm, also near Avebury.The sun seemed to be the theme and on April 24, 2009, came a pattern the scientistsinterpreted as three monthly phase cycles of the Earth's moon. When the lunar cycleinformation was combined with the next oilseed rape pattern at Peaks Down nearSwindon, perhaps about solar flares and “the apogee and perigee of a full moon,\" thescientists asked: “What will happen on the sun July 7, 2009?” And a countdown began -Would there be an outstanding solar event on that date?I think it is stunning that the most intense sunspot activity in nearly three years of anabnormally quiet sun occurred between July 5 and 6 right up to July 7. There was a solarphysics meeting in Boulder, Colorado, in mid-June and the hottest topic was why is the sunso quiet and when will it come back alive? Then Sunspot 1024 erupted suddenly on July 5 -each spot the size of Earth, each spot 8,000 miles in diameter. By July 8, the sunspots hadgrown to the size of Jupiter, 78,000 miles across!By 1:06 UT July 7, the huge, intense sunspots had projected two large solar flares intospace and a large coronal hole also opened up on the sun, releasing increased solarradiation that would reach Earth around July 9.Perhaps the Spring 2009 oilseed rape crop formations were a test to see who would pay"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"attention. Now, we need a Rosetta Stone for the June 30 Milk Hill “alien symbols,” theJune 27 South Field “electrical grids” and beyond! On July 7, I interviewed physicist MikeReed about his perspective of the sudden, huge and intense Sunspot 1024 forming withinforty-eight hours of July 7, 2009.Interview:Michael A. Reed, retired optical physicist and President, Reed DevelopmentAssociates, Inc., Timberlake, North Carolina: “It’s interesting that the original timingcame from the April 24th Morgan’s Hill oilseed rape pattern and that formation pointed toJuly 7, which was also the partial (penumbral) eclipse of the moon. So, there was anastronomical event that was going to occur on that date. The Australian scientist and Iassociated that with the patterns that seemed to highlight the sun and a July 7, 2009,forecast of a significant solar event looked pretty valid.THE DRAMA OF GOING FROM A QUIET SUN TO AN INTENSITY THAT IS BEINGDESCRIBED AT SPACEWEATHER.COM AS THE SINGLE MOST INTENSESUNSPOT ERUPTION IN OVER TWO YEARS SO CLOSE TO JULY 7, IT IS AS IFSOMETHING WERE MAKING US PAY ATTENTION TO THE SUN AT EXACTLY THETIME THAT IT SWITCHED FROM ABNORMAL QUIET INTO THIS NEWINTENSITY.That’s true. That certainly is valid. I think the interpretation of a lot of the symbols in termsof a major event that was going to affect the Earth, we may have become overlyenthusiastic about forecasting that!But when you look at the situation in April 2009, where you have a completely quiet sunand there is no indication that anything is going to happen on the sun. One could have said,‘Well, nothing is going to happen for a year.’ Nobody knew! I remember you interviewedseveral solar scientists who said they had no idea when the sun was going to wake upagain.RIGHT.So, then to have the crop circles pointed toward the indication there will be solar activity iscertainly significant. Then the fact that the July 7 date came up and that something wasgoing to happen around then – well, something did happen! It wasn’t perhaps asspectacular as we had thought, but certainly from the point of view of a very active solararea, that certainly did occur. That Sunspot 1024 is an extremely active area. You can seethe magnetic loops in it, very strong! When you watch the hourly movie of it, the sunspotshave been very active. So, in that sense, the overall predictive timing is valid. How Strong Will Solar Cycle 24and Its 2013 Maximum Be?One of the other issues now that the sun has become active, if you took away the focus onJuly 7, and looked back over the past few months, there have been quite a few patternsthat seemed to relate to the sun and a potential event on July 7. It could also mean that thecrop formation intelligence has been saying, ‘This is going to be a whopper of a solarcycle.’ I think there are some physicists who think that is the case, just based on thephysics of previous sunspot cycles, that we are due for a somewhat major cycle this time.Certainly, if the formations become more astronomical and we get more intense solarstorms, there will be repercussions in terms of potential power outages and some of theeffects that solar flares can have on Earth by breaking down communications and thingslike that. As we go forward in time and this turns out to be an extremely active solar periodgoing towards 2013, it’s going to be more and more important to study the sun. Crop Formation “Language”?FROM APRIL 14 TO JULY 7, 2009, IT MIGHT BE ARGUED THAT THIS HAS BEENAN EVOLVING ‘LANGUAGE’ COMMUNICATION – NOT LANGUAGE THATHUMANS HAVE UNDERSTOOD, BUT YOU AND THE AUSTRALIAN SCIENTISTARE BEGINNING TO SEE AND UNDERSTAND MORE ABOUT THE FORECASTINGINTELLIGENCE IN THE CROP PATTERNS, WHICH MIGHT BECOME VALUABLEAS WE MOVE TOWARDS THE NEXT SOLAR MAX.Yes, and I think one of the things that comes out of the last three months is the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"introduction of the strange symbol fields that have never been seen before. We’ve all seena lot of individual symbols in crop patterns before, but nothing like the strings of symbolsat Milk Hill reported June 30, and South Field reported June 27. They look sort of likegibberish, but all that means is we don’t understand anything about what they are doing.It’s also something that shows up as the ‘day’ symbol in the Mayan glyphs that mean ‘theday.’ There are also symbols that are equivalent to the Mayan number system: 11, 13 and1 showed up several times. That’s interesting that we are seeing things like that. The rest ofthe symbols are incomprehensible!CHARLES MALLETT CONFIRMED THAT EACH OF THOSE FIVE STRINGS OFALIEN-LOOKING SYMBOLS IN MILK HILL WAS 700-FEET-LONG AND THEENTIRE FORMATION WAS OVER 1,100 FEET. AND IT RAINED ON AND OFF ALLNIGHT JUNE 29 TO 30.You don’t do that overnight – especially when it’s raining! It will be interesting to see if thesymbols are repeated. If so, the better the chance of finding a Rosetta Stone embeddedwhere some symbols get repeated and can become decoded in some intelligent fashion. Sofar, it’s been very hard. There are some repeating symbols. One is the decreasing,rectangular spiral, which has shown up a few times in different spiral lengths.Yellow circles mark where a rectangular spiral symbol appearsin the five lines, each 700-foot-long, of “alien symbols” that were first reportedon June 30, 2009, as the third addition to the Milk Hill complex pattern that beganon the Summer Solstice, June 21, 2009.

Charles Mallett InvestigatesMilk Hill Symbols On June 30, 2009On Tuesday, June 30, 2009, Charles Mallett, Manager of the Silent Circle ResearchCentre in Compton Bassett, Wiltshire, learned that a third stage of strange symbols hadbeen added to the Milk Hill Summer Solstice pattern. That afternoon he walked the long,five strings of \"alien symbols,\" estimating each line to be at least 700 feet long. All thesymbols were \"precise and clean and each line was no more than three to four feet fromthe next line.

As you can tell from my ground shot photography, it's very well-defined,very sharp, perfect in practically all ways. But, scratching along the edges of the peripheralareas, there is constant and regular crushing on the plants.BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FIVE LINES OF SYMBOLS AT LEAST 700 FEETLONG. HOW COULD ANY HUMANS DO SO MANY SYMBOLS WITH SUCHPRECISION BETWEEN 10 PM AT NIGHT AND 4:30 AM WHEN THE SUN CAMEUP ?I don't know. I don't know anybody who could do that. But I'm just saying there was someregular damage around the periphery when I was there on the afternoon of the first day,June 30. I do understand that lots of people had already been there. And for all I know, theperipheral damage I saw could occur in some paranormally generated energy deliverysystem. We don't have a full understanding of the energetic source behind the genuinephenomenon. But the damage I saw on the periphery was consistent with what I've seen inpeople damage.WHAT WAS THE WEATHER LIKE THAT NIGHT?Interesting, because that was my first question. In fact a friend of mine went there beforeme and I asked them to have a real good look for mud because it should be covered in mudif it is faked because it had rained that night (June 29-30). But the added symbols were notmuddy. Yet, I found the crushing along the edges.SO THE CONFUSION IS THAT THE SYMBOLS THEMSELVES APPEARED CLEAN,PRISTINE AND PERFECT, BUT THERE WAS EDGE DAMAGE?Yes, that's how it was.THE SCIENTISTS HAVE SAID THIS IS EITHER THE MOST SOPHISTICATED HOAXOF ALL TIME, OR IT IS AN ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE TRYING TOCOMMUNICATE.Yes, I would say looking at the formation as a whole now that has three stages and is reallyhuge!HOW LONG IS THE WHOLE THING NOW?The strings of symbols are 700 feet long and the rest of the pattern is at least 400 or morefeet in addition, so it's more than a thousand feet long. And in the fields below Milk Hill,there are now half a dozen patterns and it looks really odd. I don't think that many havebeen in the same stretch of land before and the farmer is not going to be happy about that!When I stood in there and started walking down it, the formation goes on and on and it'slike miles of these symbols. It's pretty phenomenal that can occur at night.”Are Symbols About Strengthening Solar Cycle?Mike Reed, Physicist, Timberlake, North Carolina: “IF YOU WERE SPECULATINGABOUT THE INTELLIGENCE BEHIND MILK HILL AND SOUTH FIELD AND THESPRING OILSEED RAPE FORMATIONS, WHAT WOULD YOU SPECULATE MIGHTBE THE REASONS THAT THE CIRCLE MAKERS WORKED HARD TO FOCUS ONTHE SUN AND ASTRONOMICAL CYCLES?If this were going to be an extremely strong Solar Cycle 24, then I would expect to seethese patterns and symbols showing up again and again. I would also expect, if this kind ofcommunication is going on, that the strings of strange symbols would be repeated in otherformations with new information in them.It seems that most of what has gone on so far this year, one way or the other, was relatedto the sun and could be interpreted that way. But in terms of the implication that it’s ‘payattention to the sun’– that is perhaps the bottom line. We should probably be seeing moreformations that relate to that and more with specific symbol script associated with them.It’s very much like looking at hieroglyphics and without the Rosetta Stone, you’re kind ofsunk."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Math Embedded in Crop FormationsYOU, MIKE, ARE THE BREAKTHROUGH WHEN IT COMES TO FIGURING OUT PIIN THE 2008 BARBURY CASTLE FORMATION. THAT SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT AHIGH INTELLIGENCE EMBEDDED INFORMATION IN AT LEAST THAT CROPFORMATION. [ See 060808 Earthfiles about Pi formation.]I could not agree more! Just to think up this stuff and it all happens in the dark of night?!MOST EVERYONE AGREES THAT THE CROP FORMATIONS BETWEEN APRIL 14AND ABOUT MID-JUNE OF 2009 IN THE OILSEED RAPE SPECIFICALLY COULDNOT HAVE BEEN MADE BY HUMANS.Right, and I think that’s the smoking gun. It’s an impossible thing to create huge, precise,unbroken patterns in oilseed rape, such as Morgan's Hill, and those are the formations thatpointed directly to solar activity - even one oilseed pattern looked like an angry, activesun.PERHAPS FOR THE FIRST TIME, WE ARE BEGINNING TO RELATE TO CROPFORMATIONS AS EMBEDDED MATH AND AN ‘ALIEN LANGUAGE,’ AND WHATWE NEED IS A ROSETTA STONE TO ACCELERATE THE UNDERSTANDING.Yes, if those are the only times (Summer Solstice of 2009 and June 30) those symbols areused, then it’s kind of an anomaly. But if we get other formations where those kinds ofcharacter strings or symbolic strings are repeated, then that’s going to get very interesting.Then one could look for repeated characters and see if we can make some sense of them.The graphic part is sometimes fairly straightforward. But those symbols (at Milk Hill andSouth Field) are just frankly bizarre. (laughs) It’s hard to imagine the mind that createdthem. When they are as long and big as they are and done over night on rainy nights, itstretches the imagination – and being done very well, very crisply.You know, it’s just hard for people to take something that is so foreign seriously. It’s likeyour head just does not want to accept it and so you dismiss it. (laughs) Impact of Strong Solar Flaresand CMEs On EarthNow, the question going forward is: What happens next? Do we see more of these symbolstrings? Do we get an opportunity to look at more of them and understand them? Will wesee more concern about the sun? Are there other astronomical events that are depicted?The formation makers have done that in the past about the solar system eclipses andconjunction of planets as a way of communicating in a non-threatening way.But the focus on the sun and the potential for serious activity as we go forward issomething that’s going to be interesting to see if there is a follow up. Relative to solaractivity, if it becomes extremely strong, there could be significant damage to the highlyindustrialized countries because we are so dependent upon communications.ON SATELLITES.Satellites and the power grid. If you look at what happens on a high voltage system whereyou have a 3-wire system in three phases and you have a Y-shaped structure with threewires connecting these things at either end. Then the center of where the three coils – thewindings of the transformer – where they are joined together in the center, that becomesthe ground line and that gets actually physically referenced to the local ground where thattransformer is.If you produce enough energy coming from the sun into the atmosphere and startproducing potential differences on the surface of the Earth, that energy can go through theground line and then run down all three of the transmission wires together. That’s not anAC current. It’s a very large, massive DC current. Once you saturate the core of atransformer by putting a large DC current through it, then it stops acting as a transformerand the DC current alone can be enough to melt wires. And you can damage thetransformer to the point where it is put out of commission. The big transformers, the700,000-volt units and the 360,000-volt transformers – these things are not nickels anddimes. They are very expensive and they are not stocked on shelves.SO IF A TRANSFORMER MELTED, IT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME TO RESTORE?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Yes. That’s why the space weather alerts are so important in order to give the power gridstime to disconnect or do whatever they have to do to prevent operating during one of thesemajor solar events.Then there is the issue of satellite communications going down, potential damage to GPS(Global Positioning System) satellites from intense radiation. If there is a focus on the sunand potential strength of solar emissions, then perhaps it is like someone trying to warn usabout the potential risks associated.If it turns out to be a strong solar cycle and there is nothing you can do and satellites couldfail, then you are going to lose a lot of communications capabilities. If GPS were damagedand some satellites were fried, that’s a major problem in our ability to fly airplanes,navigate and so on. We are very dependent on GPS!WE COULD BE DEALING WITH AN INTELLIGENCE IN THE UNSEEN THATWANTS US TO UNDERSTAND ITS LANGUAGE SO IT COULD WARN?Yes, that’s certainly a possibility. That’s why I think it’s hard for your mind to sit there andsay, ‘This is real’ – in the sense that this is something that looks very alien, very kind ofbizarre, but it’s happening and happening so big (in scale) that I think it can’t be a hoax orfaked by people running around with boards and strings.”Milk Hill, Wiltshire County, England, Summer Solstice crop formation that evolved in three parts.Part 1 was reported on June 21; Part 2 was reported the next morning on June 22; and Part 3"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"was reported on June 30, an addition of five, 700-foot-long lines of “alien symbols.”Aerial image © 2009 by Lucy Pringle.
