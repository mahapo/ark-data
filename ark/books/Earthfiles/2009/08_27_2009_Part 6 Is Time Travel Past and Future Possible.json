Jim Penniston is not the onlyUFO experiencer who has linked UFOs to time travelers. That idea has also come frompeople in the human abduction syndrome who report missing time and encounters withnon-humans. Is time travel past and future really possible?Fifteen years ago in 1994, a book called Hyperspace was released and quickly climbedThe New York Times best seller list. The author was Michio Kaku, Ph.D., a City Universityof New York theoretical physicist who is one of the leading pioneers in quantumsuperstring theory. Prof. Kaku's subtitle explains the book's content: A Scientific OdysseyThrough Parallel Universes, Time Warps and the Tenth Dimension.Michio Kaku was born sixty-two years ago in San Jose, California, and grew up in PaloAlto. His academic degrees include a Bachelors of Science degree from HarvardUniversity in 1968, followed by a 1972 Ph.D. in theoretical physics from the University ofCalifornia-Berkeley, and post-doctoral work at Princeton University. Dr. Kaku is also avisiting professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, where thegenius Albert Einstein spent the last years of his life trying to develop a unified field theoryfor gravity, electromagnetic fields and strong and weak nuclear forces. But Einsteincouldn't make all the pieces fit before he died in 1955.Then in 1970 to 1971, quantum string and superstring theories were born that"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"mathematically describe those cosmic forces as vibrations in a higher dimensional space ofat least ten or eleven dimensions. Suddenly physicists such as Michio Kaku had fieldequations that fit together like pieces in a jigsaw puzzle. In string theory, the Earth andmatter universe are the lowest string vibration. Beyond are many other vibrations thatcould include the mysterious dark energy and dark matter that make up 95% of ouruniverse. In fact, if the Large Hadron Collider at CERN near Geneva, Switzerland, everstarts spinning and colliding protons, dark matter might be created for cosmologists tostudy.Superstring theory also describes small black holes, or “transversible worm holes,” thatcould be used to travel backwards or forwards in time through hyperspace. The theory isthat our universe is connected to other universes through wormholes, and all of theuniverses are found within hyperspace.Earth to the star system Sirius is 54 trillion miles, or 8.6 years traveling at the speedof light (8.6 light-years). But a wormhole through hyperspace between Earth and Siriuswould dramatically shorten travel forwards or backwards in time. Source: HowStuffWorks.com.Time travel also came up as the source of global crop formations back in 1993. I was inWiltshire County, England, to explore the crop circle mystery at a time when the strangepatterns in cereal crops had been reported in some 23 countries in both hemispheres of theworld. There were even TV news reports about the crop patterns on ABC network’s 20/20,CBS’s 60 Minutes and headlines in newspapers and magazines.I met a man who told me he had firsthand information that the CIA was trying tophotograph from satellites every crop formation in chronological sequence so computerscould look for mathematical patterns that might be decoded.Then he startled me by explaining that the agency’s current theory is that we are dealingwith time travelers and the crop formations have something to do with gauging theeffectiveness of their efforts to manipulate Earth’s timeline. But exactly why time travelerswould be doing this, no one understood.Recently I asked Prof. Kaku if he thought it possible that some UFOs and worldwide cropformations could be time travelers interacting with Earth for reasons unknown?Interview:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Michio Kaku, Ph.D., giving lecture.Image courtesy Michio Kaku.Michio Kaku, Ph.D., Prof. of Theoretical Physics, City University of New York, NewYork City, New York and author of Hyperspace © 1994, Physics of the Impossible© 2008 and several other books and text books: “In the last several years, there hasbeen a sea change in the world of physics concerning time travel. Stephen Hawking, mycolleague, used to publicly say that time travel was impossible because where are thetourists from the future? Since there were no tourists taking pictures of him from thefuture, he said that time travel was impossible.Well, he changed his mind. He now says that time travel is possible. In theory, it might infact be possible and consistent with the laws of physics. Einstein himself had reservationsabout time travel. His office mate at Princeton, Kurt Goedel, one of the greatestmathematicians of the last thousand years, in fact, found solutions of Einstein’s equations,which do allow for time travel.WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE PATTERNS THAT HAVE BEEN IN HUNDREDS ANDHUNDREDS OF CROP FORMATIONS OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS IN THEMODERN ERA OF CROP FORMATIONS, I’M SURE YOU’VE STUDIED SOME,LOOKED AT SOME OF THE PHOTOS?“Julia Set” discovered in a wheat field across the road from Stonehenge in Englandon July 8, 1996. The spiral measured 915 feet on its longest axis, covered a square acreand consisted of 149 circles. The center of each circle was twisted differently.Aerial photograph © 1996 by Lucy Pringle. Yes, but it’s hard to make a definitive statement one way or the other about time travelers"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"making crop formations because it all depends on how an advanced civilization wouldharness this time travel technology, if it’s possible at all, and what the time travel machinewould look like.In my book, Parallel Worlds, I even give you a rough sketch as to what such a time travelmachine would look like. However, other proposals have been made and all of them seemto be consistent with Einstein’s equations and quantum theory.IF AN ADVANCED INTELLIGENCE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT’S BEHINDTHE CROP FORMATION PHENOMENON, WHAT MIGHT IT BE TRYING TOACCOMPLISH IN THE CEREAL CROPS AND GRASSES IN THESE LARGE – LET’SCALL THEM ORGANIC SKINS OF THE EARTH - IN RELATIONSHIP TO TIMETRAVEL?Well, look at it from their point of view, rather than our point of view. From their point ofview, they would be centuries – or more likely millennia – ahead of us in energy. Theywould be able to manipulate, for example, stars and manipulate even the fabric of spaceand time. And then, they they would have a choice. There are actually several solutions ofEinstein’s equations that allow for travel to the past and future through time and travelthrough space.One of them is the worm hole. It is the looking glass of Alice In Wonderland. It wouldeven look like a looking glass. It would be basically a spinning ring – a ring of neutronsspinning very rapidly, such that if you put your hand through the ring, you are notdestroyed by infinite gravity, which is what we used to think. If the ring spins rapidlyenough, a gate way opens and like a star gate, you can go actually back and forth betweentwo separate universes.IF THERE IS A VERY ADVANCED CIVILIZATION THAT MIGHT BE DOING TIMETRAVEL BACK INTO OUR MODERN TIME AND THE CROP FORMATIONS MIGHTBE RELATED TO SOME EXPERIMENTATION OR TEST THEY ARE DOING, IS ITPOSSIBLE THAT ALL OR MOST OF THE TRULY MYSTERIOUS UFO PHENOMENACOULD BE VERY INTELLIGENT MACHINES DESIGNED TO GO THROUGH, LET’SSAY A TRANSVERSIBLE WORM HOLE, AND TO DO MONITORING AND TOCOLLECT INFORMATIOIN FROM HERE FOR SOME POINT IN TIME OR APARALLEL UNIVERSE?The most efficient way for a very advanced civilization to colonize the galaxy is NOT tosend Captain Kirk on the Starship Enterprise. In fact, that’s perhaps the stupidest way toexplore the universe because there are simply too many stars and there are too manyplanets in the galaxy. There are about 200 billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Perhapshalf of them have planets and so you begin to realize that the most mathematicallyefficient way is to send out what are called von Neumann self-replicating probes.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “A von Neumann probe is a self-replicatingspacecraft designed to investigate its target system and transmit informationabout it back to its system of origin. The concept is named after Hungarian-American mathematician and physicist John von Neumann, who rigorouslystudied the concept of self-replicating machines that he called ‘UniversalAssemblers’ and which are often referred to as ‘von Neumann machines.’While von Neumann never applied his work to the idea of spacecraft,theoreticians since then have.If a self-replicating probe finds evidence of primitive life (or a primitive, lowlevel culture) it might be programmed to lie dormant, silently observe, attemptto make contact (known as a Bracewell probe), or even interfere with or guidethe evolution of life in some way. Physicist Paul Davies of the University ofAdelaide has even raised the possibility of a probe resting on our own moon,having arrived at some point in Earth's ancient prehistory and remained tomonitor Earth. ]The most efficient way to look at the colonization of a galaxy is to send a robotic probe to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the moon. The moon is quite stable. It has plenty of soil. No erosion or rust to worry about.And the probe makes copies of itself – millions of copies of itself. That’s what it does. Itlands on the moon and makes copies of itself, which then fly out to other distant starsystems, land on their moon and make copies. So, starting with one probe, you get amillion.Now, what will they do once they land on the moon? They would basically put an alarmclock there and wait – wait for civilizations to develop. So, if you think of the movie 2001(Stanley Kubrick), that’s the outline of that movie. On the moon perhaps there is thegreatest likelihood of a base of some sort – a self-replicating probe that has landed on themoon, made copies of itself, which then fly out to visit other moons. If you saw the moviecarefully, there is even a scene where you see thousands, millions of these things aroundJupiter. So, they would basically be a watch station looking for evidence of intelligent life.WHY WOULDN’T SELF-REPLICATING MACHINES GO TO THE PLANETSTHEMSELVES? WHY WOULD THEY STOP AT THE MOONS?They wouldn’t. They could periodically send probes on to the distant planets, which haveinhabitants on them. This way, they wouldn’t have to have large quantities of fuel. Theycould simply go back to their base on the moon.Realize that the movie 2001 was supposed to take place in 2001. (laughs) But it will takeus about a hundred years to 2100 until we even have a functional moon base like theyhave in the movie capable of detecting such a thing. So, the irony is that we could be beingobserved every second of the day and yet we’re too primitive to know it.YOU BROUGHT UP A VERY IMP ORTANT P OINT IN PHYSICS OF THE IMPOSSIBLE(© 2008) ABOUT THE OBSERVATIONS OF SO MANY EYEWITNESSES IN THESO-CALLED UFO PHENOMENON THAT ARE SILENT AND THAT THEY MIGHT BEOPERATING ON A MAGNETIC PROPULSION SYSTEM, WHICH IS ALSOCONSISTENT WITH EYEWITNESS OBSERVATIONS THAT THEY ARE LOOKINGAT SOMETHING THAT IS SPINNING VERY RAPIDLY. WHAT HAS BEENOBSERVED FOR CENTURIES – RINGS, AS EZEKIEL DESCRIBED RINGS WITHINRINGS – RELATES TO USING MAGNETIC FIELDS IN A WAY WE DON’TUNDERSTAND, BUT COULD BE USED AS CRAFT IN THE ATMOSPHERE OFPLANETS AND MOONS.The criticism that physicists usually have of flying saucers is first of all, they zigzag. Theyhave no exhaust and so forth and that they are simply too small. How can you contain allthat rocket fuel to go across the galaxy?My point of view about UFOs is that if they have a robotic base on the moon, which is themost mathematically logical way to explore the galaxy, and probes are sent from the moonperiodically to explore other star systems even beyond our own, then it’s natural for themto want to explore us. In fact, that’s the whole point. The whole point of self-replicatingvon Neumann probes is to see what kinds of life forms are out there.If you take a look at energy consumption, when we’ve scanned the heavens for intelligentlife, we don’t look for little green men. We look for Type I, Type II and Type IIIcivilizations. A Type I civilization about a hundred years more advanced than us hasharnessed planetary power. They can control the weather. They have cities on the ocean.Anything planetary like volcanoes and earthquakes, they can influence because theyharness the entire energy of a planet.Then we have Type II, the world of Star Trek. The federation of planets can barely ignitestars. They’ve only colonized a tiny fraction of the Milky Way Galaxy. That would be aType II civilization, a civilization that harnesses stellar power. They can control stars. Theycan play with stars, move them around, ignite them, just like in the TV series.Then we have Type III. A Type III civilization is galactic. They span not just a few starsystems. They span the entire galaxy itself and they use black holes as their energy supply.Type III would have 10 billion times the power of a Type II civilization, which in turn"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"would have about 10 billion times the energy of a Type I civilization.Then there is the possibility of Type IV that would be extra-galactic. They would be able togo between galaxies. Actually on Star Trek, there is a candidate for a Type IV civilizationand this is the Q, the Q Continuum.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “In the fictional TV Star Trek universe, the QContinuum is an extradimensional plane of existence inhabited by a race ofextremely powerful, hyper-intelligent beings known as the Q. They claim tobe largely indifferent to the affairs of the non-Q beings living in normal space,or in the many dimensions parallel to their own, considering them to beinsignificant and childlike, though sometimes amusing as only children can be.However, they are clearly very interested in human beings in particular,subjecting the human race to various tests. These tests often imply that theyfeel somewhat threatened by humanity's potential, but are intrigued by it aswell. The Q have the ability to warp reality at a whim, ranging from appearingin any place they choose to rearranging the cosmos themselves. ]Now, what are we on this scale? We are Type 0. We don’t even rate on this scale. We getour energy not from stars, not from galaxies, not from volcanoes. We get our energy fromdead plants – oil and coal – and we’re running out of those! But we are about a hundredyears away from becoming Type I. For example, the internet is the beginning of a Type Itelephone system. So, we see evidence of the origins of a Type I civilization on Earth.Now for these civilizations that can roam the galactic space lanes – basically star faringcivilizations – they would probably be Type III, which would put them about 50 to 100thousand years more advanced than usIt seems to me that if you used nanotechnology – that is, the technology of individualatoms – these spaceships don’t have to be that big. Most physicists have several criticismsof UFOs. One is that they are too small. How can you pack enough energy to go acrossstars? Stars are so distant, it would take millennia to go between different star systems. So,that’s why some physicists dismiss the phenomenon.However, once you’re talking about a civilization a few thousand years more advancedthan us, then new energies, new physics, new technologies come into play. We’re Type 0,but we’re very close to becoming Type I. And if I were an alien putting such a device onthe moon, I would want to have an alarm clock that signals the transition from Type 0 toType I. A Type 0 civilization is probably very ordinary. There are probably a lot of Type 0civilizations – they are probably a dime a dozen in the galaxy and most of themself-destruct. Most of them blow themselves apart with the savagery of their ancient past.Type I, however, is much more interesting – peaceful, planetary science and culture.Therefore, if you watch the movie 2001 very carefully, there’s a scene where they touchthe probe, the probe then sends a signal back to the home relay station on Jupiter signalingthat they have attained Type I status. Now, why wasn’t this explained to you when yousaw the movie?Well, Kubrick actually interviewed quite a few astrophysicists at the beginning of themovie who laid out this entire scenario that the moon is the most logical place for avisitation, they would send out self-replicating von Neumann probes and they would waituntil we became a planetary civilization. However, Kubrick at the last minute cut the firstten minutes of his own film so the film became super mystical.But actually, if you watch it again, it’s perhaps the most logical, mathematically consistentway to explore the galaxy and to encounter intelligent life in outer space."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THE HADRON COLLIDER NEAR GENEVA IS HAVINGSO MANY ELECTRICAL PROBLEMS AND MAGNET PROBLEMS?I think they rushed it. Last year when they were about to turn on the Large HadronCollider, they don’t like to admit it, but it was obviously human error. I’ve talked withseveral of the people there and they privately say that it was because they were rushing it.And that’s why there was a break that led to the spilling of many tons of liquid helium, Ithink it was, on to the floor and it was so cold down there that workers would freeze todeath. So they had to wait many weeks for the temperature to rise. Then they hitChristmas. At Christmas time, they had to shut down the machine because the machineuses so much electricity that the people of Geneva would not have a Christmas!So, for all these reasons – it’s a very complicated machine and I think they rushed it.MOST RECENTLY, I RECEIVED AN EMAIL FROM THE HADRON PRESS OFFICETHAT RIGHT NOW, IT IS AN INDETERMINATE TIME INTO THE FUTURE BEFORETHEY EVEN KNOW WHEN THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO TEST IT AGAIN.Yeah, it’s kind of unfortunate.

The court there, however, ruledthat this was out of their province because we’re talking about a European machine andnot an American machine. So, that’s why the lawsuit was thrown out.WHY COULDN’T PROTONS ACCELERATED TO NEAR THE SPEED OF LIGHT,GOING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AND COLLIDING, CREATE MINI-BLACKHOLES?First of all, the theory says that no black holes will be created at all. Zero! However, thereis a rather, I think, odd ball offshoot of string theory. String theory is what I do for aliving. We think string theory is the theory of everything. There is an offshoot of stringtheory that says maybe we can create a black hole. We physicists, first of all, think thatoffshoot of string theory is probably wrong, but if it’s right and mini-black holes arecreated, they disappear.Second of all, the Earth is bathed in cosmic rays – much more energetic than anything thatcan be created by the large collider. The Large Hadron Collider is colossal in human terms,but Mother Nature thinks it’s puny. It’s a pea shooter compared to what Mother Naturedoes. Mother Nature slams black holes together! And these black holes create huge cosmicexplosions seen across the universe.THE GAMMA BURSTS?The gamma ray bursts, right. And they hit the Earth with energy much greater thananything we get from slamming puny protons together. On a human scale, if you visit themachine, it looks really big.

Da rk ma t t e r c o mpris e s23% of the universe. This matter, different from atoms, does not emit or absorb light. It hasonly been detected indirectly by its gravity. 72% of the universe, is composed of “dark energy,”that acts as a sort of an anti-gravity. This dark energy, distinct from dark matter, is responsiblefor the present-day acceleration of the universal expansion. WMAP data is accurate to twodigits, so the total of these numbers is not 100%.

AND ULTIMATELY, DO YOU THINK IT COULD GET US TOUNDERSTANDING WHAT DARK MATTTER AND DARK ENERGY ARE?That’s the hope. The hope is that we’ll create something called ‘sparticles.’[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “In particle physics, a superpartner (alsosparticle) is a hypothetical elementary particle. The word superpartner is acombination of the words supersymmetry and partner, while sparticle is acombination of supersymmetry and particle. Supersymmetry is one of thecutting-edge theories in current high-energy physics, which predicts theexistence of these ‘shadow’ particles. However, if this theory is correct, itshould be possible to recreate these particles in high-energy particleaccelerators. Doing so will not be an easy task; these particles may havemasses up to a thousand times greater than their corresponding \"real\"particles. Until recently, colliders did not have the power to create thesesupermassive particles, but the newly built Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"CERN near Geneva, Switzerland, will be able to achieve collisions in the 14TeV (tera-electron-volt) range, which is more than adequate to determine ifthese superpartner particles exist. ]Sparticles are super particles. They represent the next vibration of the string. If we findsparticles, that will go a long way toward verifying that this is in act the Theory ofEverything, the theory that alluded Einstein.WHAT DO YOU THINK DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER ARE?We think dark matter is a sparticle and we hope to create it with the Large HadronCollider. And that is the next musical note. Everything you see around you – the protons,neutrons, electrons, neutrinos – everything you see around you is nothing but the lowestnote on a vibrating string. So, if Einstein had never been born and we never had all theseatom smashers, we would have discovered it anyway because all of this is nothing but thelowest note of a vibrating string. But there is the higher note – in fact, an infinite numberof notes. The next higher note is consistent with dark matter. It’s invisible and it hasgravity. That’s exactly what dark matter is.So, we think the Large Hadron Collider will create dark matter, which we think is thesparticle, which is another missing piece of the string.WHAT ABOUT DARK ENERGY?Dark energy is a little bit harder to get. Dark energy is the energy of nothing. String theoryis a quantum theory. Therefore, it has dark energy in it. But we have to be able to calculateexactly how much dark energy there is and that requires assumptions. That’s why we get alittle bit hesitant to say that string theory can definitively say what dark energy is.IF THIS MATTER WORLD THAT WE’RE IN IS THE LOWEST VIBRATING STRING,AND THE NEXT ONE UP IS DARK MATTER, WOULD DARK ENERGY BE AVIBRATING STRING OF A NOTE OR NOT?It would be quantum fluctuations to the string. The string is made out of matter, but itmoves in space. And it makes space curl up exactly as Einstein predicted. So, if Einsteinhad never been born, we would have gotten the entire theory from these tiny, vibratingstrings in hyperspace. So, dark energy automatically comes out of the theory because it is aquantum theory and dark energy is a quantum effect. The problem is that we can’tcalculate it. My personal attitude is that we physicists on the Earth are not smart enough tosolve the theory.”eturn to Part 1ontinued in Part 7 - Implications from UFO Historian Richard DolanMore Information:Michio Kaku Books: Beyond Einstein © 1987; Hyperspace © 1994; Visions © 1999;Einstein's Cosmos © 2004; Parallel Worlds © 2004; Physics of the Impossible © 2008.or further information about the worldwide crop formations and UFO phenomena, pleasesee Earthfiles Archive (partial list below) and my books, An Alien Harvest, the2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities, and Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles in theEarthfiles Shop.Crop Formations:• 08/18/2009 — Part 3: Silbury Hill “Quetzlcoatl Headdress” First Filmed At Dawn• 08/17/2009 — Part 2: Windmill Hill and West Overton After Rains• 08/12/2009 — Part 1: Windmill Hill Pattern Near Ancient Avebury Came in Rain"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"• 08/05/2009 — Extraordinary Details in New Silbury Hill Formation Destroyed by Farmer• 08/03/2009 — \"Settlement\" Wheat Formation Inside Ancient Celtic Settlement• 07/31/2009 — Silver Disc Videotaped Near Barbury Castle• 07/31/2009 — Infrared Video of Light Flashes, Moving Darknesses - and Entity?• 07/30/2009 — Inside the 12-Armed Ogbourne St. George Wheat Formation• 07/16/2009 — Part 2: Silbury Hill “Quetzlcoatl Headdress” and Mysterious Tall Blonds• 07/15/2009 — Part 1: Silbury Hill “Quetzlcoatl Headdress” and Mysterious Tall Blonds• 07/14/2009 — 2-Stage Cannings Cross Wheat Formation Scene of Farm Arrest• 07/12/2009 — Mysterious Aerial Lights Mimicking Stars in Texas and Oregon• 07/11/2009 — Update Podcast: Is Sudden Solar Intensity of July 5 - 7 What U.K. SpringCrop Formations Forecast for Oddly Quiet Sun?• 07/06/2009 — UK “Quetzalcoatl Headdress” and “Sixth Sun Tzolkin”?• 07/03/2009 — UK “Nazca Hummingbird” - Astronomical and Mayan Counting• 07/03/2009 — Part 3: “Alien Symbols” in Milk Hill and South Field• 07/02/2009 — Part 1: “Alien Symbols” in Milk Hill and South Field• 07/02/2009 — Part 2: “Alien Symbols” in Milk Hill and South Field• 06/09/2009 — Update Podcast: Aerial Lights That Mimic Stars, Helicopters and Airplanes• 06/05/2009 — Part 2: Mysterious, Silent, Large Aerial Triangles• 06/04/2009 — Part 1: Mysterious, Silent, Large Aerial Triangles• 05/12/2009 — Part 3: Astronomical Information in U.K. 2009 Crop Formations?• 05/10/2009 — Part 2: 800-Foot-Long Pattern in U.
