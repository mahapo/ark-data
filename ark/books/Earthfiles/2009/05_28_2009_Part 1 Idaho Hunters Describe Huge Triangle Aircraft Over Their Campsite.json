The coverpage is also stamped with the official United States War Office seal that was still used in1954. In Part 3 of this report, I am reprinting the entire SOM1-01 training manual forEarthfiles viewers.Chapter 2 begins: “Extraterrestrial Technology is defined as follows:Aircraft identified as not manufactured in the United States or any terrestrial"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"foreign powers, including (and not) experimental military or civilian aircraft.Aircraft in this category are generally known as Unidentified Flying Objects,or UFOBs. Such aircraft may appear as one of several shapes andconfigurations and exhibit extraordinary flight characteristics.Extraterrestrial Biological Entities (EBEs) are described as:a. Creatures, humanoid or otherwise, whose evolutionary processesresponsible for their development are demonstrably different from thosepostulated or observed in Homo sapiens.”Page 5 describes four categories of Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOBs):Elliptical or disc shape.1.Fuselage or cigar shape.2.Ovoid or circular shape.3.Airfoil or triangular shape. About the triangular shape, the training manualstates: “This craft is believed to be new technology due to the rarity andrecency (sic) of the observations. Radar indicates an isosceles triangle profile,the longest side being nearly 300 feet in length. Little is known about theperformance of these craft due to the rarity of good sightings, but they arebelieved capable of high speeds and abrupt maneuvers similar to, orexceeding, the performance attributed to elliptical, disc or circular-shapedcraft.”4."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" 1954 was 55 years ago. In the past half century, many people around the world havereported seeing large, triangle-shaped aircraft that are silent - including the Belgium flap of1990 [ See last section of this Earthfiles report.] At each triangle corner, eyewitnessesreport a circular white light and at the center of the triangle is a larger circle of red light.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Dark, aerial triangles at night are a class ofunidentified flying objects (UFOs) with certain common features which havereportedly been observed from the 1940s (and possibly earlier) to the present.They have appeared most commonly over cities of the United States andEngland, but have been spotted worldwide. Hundreds of observers havereported enormous, totally silent, triangular craft hovering or slowly cruisingat low altitudes over cities and highways, usually at night and making noattempt to evade detection. The craft are often described to have white lightsat each corner of the triangle and a red glowing, sometimes pulsating, largercentral red light. Their origin and existence remain shrouded in mystery.”Artist's illustration of unidentified, silent, triangularaerial craft that haunted the Belgium skies in late March 1990."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" One of the most dramatic close-up encounters happened in the Idaho back country ofChallis where four hunters had camped on September 27, 2000. Kris and Marc Bales arebrothers who work together in their Bend, Oregon, construction company that buildshomes and commercial offices. The brothers have been going to the same Challis huntingarea for nearly twenty years. Their hunting site is in a valley ravine at about 6,000 feetsurrounded by mountains peaks ranging up to 12,000 feet.Challis, Idaho, and Salmon Challis National Forest are northwest of theArco, Idaho, National Engineering and Environmental Lab (DOE) and volcanicCraters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve.With them on that September 2000 trip was their good friend, Rob, and Rob’s father. Thegroup had been out all day in the woods and had returned to fix dinner in their camptrailer. Around 9:15 PM, Kris Bales left the trailer to go to his pickup truck to get food.Interview:Kris Bales, Owner, Construction Company, Bend, Oregon: “I reached over andopened the lid of the box – I had a sack of groceries in there and was going to take theminside. Just as I reaching down in there, I got a really strange feeling. The only way I canexplain it is that there was like if you were in a dark cave and people were holding like areally heavy wool blanket just over the top of you and it was not touching you, but youkind of knew something was there.And for whatever reason, the hair on the back of my neck stood up and I looked up, and asI was looking up, I stepped back off of the tire. I had a small flashlight in my right hand. AsI was looking up, my right hand just kind of automatically went up with the light and therewas an object. I remember my light going up the trees and then the light hit an object thatwas blocking out the sky completely. It was a perfectly clear, windless, really beautifulevening. This thing was blocking out the whole sky basically from one side of the draw tothe other.With my flashlight, I could actually see texture and color. It was a big triangular shape –and why I remember it being on each side about the length of a football field is whatpopped into my head, like goal post to goal post. So, it was huge!THAT WOULD BE MAYBE 300 FEET ON A SIDE.Correct, yes. So, it was pretty intimidating. (laughs) for me at that point! The outer edgewas like a flat black, kind of charcoal-looking, smudgy dark that kind of blended into agreenish gold, but pretty muted like suede leather – that’s what it reminded me of. Theblack charcoal sides that came around down about to the bottom of the craft, or whateverit was."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Kris Bales Notes from September 27, 2000: “Feeling of a thick heavyblanket above me. Dark shape directly above me and the trailer. Looked upand saw shaped outline because it blocked out the sky and stars. NO SOUND.My flashlight shined across bottom - was it back right hand corner? Or frontside to back? At about a 45-degree angle in very defined look (for less than 1second),I could see color and texture and edge. The flashlight seemed to activate theaircraft, like it knew it had been spotted. A very deep low ‘throttling up’ soundof intense power increased slightly and it began to levitate straight up and thenmove forward up the canyon very slowly. As it ‘throttled up,’ the light glowedlike a dim dome light and the deep red center light began to slowly pulse (noflash) as it moved up the canyon until out of sight. NO NOISE after ‘throttleup’ sound.” THAT BOTTOM WAS WHAT COLOR?The bottom of it was kind of a muted goldish-green and really flat, nothing shiny. And atfirst, there were no lights on. That thing was just sitting above my head somewherebetween 100 and 200 feet above me. I know the trees were approximately 100 feet tall, soit was probably no lower than that. It was just sitting there not making a sound. Somethingthat huge just basically levitated in the air not doing anything.No comprehension of just about everything that I saw is probably one of the best ways toexplain it. When my flashlight went across the bottom of it, it was like, ‘Whoops, we’vebeen spotted!’These lights on each corner on the underneath side, they were approximately – just a guess– like 30 feet in diameter. After I shone my flashlight, they just came on really slowly.They reminded me of a really dim dome light, but they did not illuminate anything at all. Itdidn’t light up the trees; didn’t light up the ground. I could see the lights, but theyobviously were not for illuminating an area.KRIS, DID THEY HAVE COLOR?No, they were just a dim, yellowish-white dome light (in a car) is the closest thing I cancome to describing what they looked like. This is all happening in parts of a second. Ittakes a lot longer to tell it than what happened. And then about the same time those threelights came on first, in the center of the craft was something that reminded me of a Skippypeanut butter lid upside down on the bottom center of the craft. It was probably threetimes as big as the outer corner lights. And that central light came on real slowly and it waslike a really deep, ruby red color. Again, it was not bright. It did not illuminate anything."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"YOU ARE SAYING THAT IF THE THREE CORNER LIGHTS WERE 30 FEET INDIAMETER AND THE CENTRAL RED LIGHT WAS ABOUT 100 FEET INDIAMETER.Yeah, like 90 feet, somewhere in there.THAT’S HUGE!Ye s !300-foot-long unidentified, silent, aerial craft first discovered only 100 or 200 feetabove Challis, Idaho, camp trailer on September 27, 2000. Illustration © 2009 by Kris Bales.DID THAT ENTIRE CIRCLE IN THE CENTRAL PART COME ON AS THE DEEP,RUBY RED?Yes, it was all the same color and brighter than any other part of the craft. I saw that comeon and at the same time, there was an extremely deep, subsonic sound. The only thing I’vebeen around that kind of sounds like it is if you go down into a big dam on a river wherethere is a big turbine engine turned by the water – immense feeling and sound of a reallylow volume, low bass sound. I heard that. That’s the only sound that we heard. It had beendead silent up to that point. That happened for only like a fraction of a second and thenthis thing started to rise straight up above me.Actually, it had to rise straight up because it could not move side-to-side or forwardbecause of the way the valley ravine sides came up – the craft would have hit somethingon one of the corners. At that time – excuse the language – I just yelled out. I was on myknees trying to comprehend the thing and yelled out, ‘Holy shit! Holy shit! Holy shit! Youguys have got to come see this!’That’s when my brother, Marc, heard Rob and me. Marc came out the door and I wastrying to half stand up – half on my knees and half on my feet.HOW DID YOU GET TO YOUR KNEES?When I dropped down off the side of the pickup – I mean, the lack of comprehension ofwhat it was just basically floored me. I mean, I just gave out.YOU FELL TO YOUR KNEES IN COMPLETE ASTONISHMENT.Yes! Non-comprehension. Astonishment does not even come close to describing it. I had afew bear encounters and had been chased by a bear once. He didn’t get me, but I thought Ihad been scared that time with the bear, but after seeing this, I knew I didn’t ever reallyknow what the word ‘scared’ meant. But I do now.YOU ARE SCREAMING FOR YOUR BROTHER AND YOUR TWO HUNTINGBUDDIES – WHAT HAPPENED?Well, Marc came out first. I basically crawled half on my knees and grabbed hold of"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Marc’s shirt and pulled myself up and pointed up above me. I didn’t say anything, justpointed up. So, Marc looked up and Marc and Rob had the presence of mind to run to theirpickups and both of them grabbed their binoculars and were looking at the object in theirbinoculars. The craft had started moving forward when I pointed up with Marc. So, it wasnot still hovering above us. It was starting to move forward and up this valley. It seemedlike an extremely slow moving rate. And I describe the movement as if you take a hockeypuck on ice and put the hockey puck on ice and gave it a little shove, so smooth and softand slid along the ice. That’s what this craft reminded me of, extremely powerful, makingno noise. How can something this size do that? What is it?One of my other first impressions was that’s not from here (Earth). Don’t know why.Another impression was how perfect it was! When the flashlight went across the bottom,there were no rivets, no screws, nothing shiny, no insignia, no identification of any sort onthe bottom side of that big triangle.HOW LONG HAD YOUR TRUCK BEEN PARKED WHEN YOU WENT OUT TO GETTHE FOOD?Well, I was parked there when we got back from hunting. We drove back in the truck, sowe had probably been there maybe 45 minutes, I guess.SO, KRIS, HOW DID THIS HUGE FOOTBALL-FIELD-SIZE ON THREE SIDES GETINTO CAMP OVER YOUR TRUCK AND BE THERE HOVERING 100 FEET OR 200FEET ABOVE? IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN YOU WENT OUT TO THETRUCK FOR GROCERIES AND DISCOVERED IT BECAUSE YOU FELT THATSTRANGE FEELING.That would be my guess. I have no clue how long it was there. Obviously, Rob had notlooked up, so he did not notice.IT IMPLIES STEALTHINESS ON THE PART OF THE TRIANGLE AS IF IT CAMEDOWN LOW WHERE YOU ALL WERE ALMOST AS IF WHAT?Sneaking up on us and monitoring what we were doing, I guess, was my impression. I can’tthink of any other reason to do that unless they just tried to see how close they could getbefore we discovered it was there. I don’t know if that was the intent or not. But it wasobvious, whether it could hear or see us, with my yelling and the flashlight on there, it waspretty obvious that I had seen it.WHAT HAPPENED TO THE RED CENTRAL LIGHT AND THE THREE CORNERWHITE LIGHTS WHEN IT BEGAN TO MOVE?They just stayed the same. They really didn’t do anything, didn’t get any brighter inintensity. The slight pulse wasn’t like in an airplane light where you can see where it flickspretty good. It just seemed to be a really slow heart beat type throb.The white lights came on after my flashlight went across the bottom of it and after I hadyelled for Marc. This was almost simultaneous that the three white lights, or dimyellowish-white lights on each corner came on. And then, the center big, ruby red, Skippy-peanut-butter-lid-shaped light on the bottom of the craft, a dark, ruby red – that came onreally slowly, just kind of like turning a dimmer on real slowly. The intensity came up on it.The red light was not bright. It did not illuminate anything, did not light anything up. Thatred light came on simultaneously with a really deep, low-pitched throb, a deep base thatwas not loud, just perceptible, an immense amount of power. That all happened as theobject lifted straight up above.At that point, there was no more noise and just dead silence and the big, ruby red light kindof started to throb like a really slow, pulsing heartbeat and it started to move forward andup the draw.You know it’s there. It’s not some sort of an illusion. This was dead real. It was there!There is no question about it, just like the trees and the mountains were there beside us.This thing was over the top of us. The seconds clicked by slowly, but we kind of put atimeline together and the whole time from me spotting it to when it was out of sight wassomewhere between 45 seconds and 60 seconds."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Time line put together by Kris and Marc Bales in discussions after the September 27, 2000,encounter with the 300-foot-long, silent, triangular aircraft. Time line list w ritten by Kris Bales.DO YOU HAVE ANY GUT SENSE ABOUT WHAT YOU WERE SO AFRAID OF?Just not knowing what it was. Not comprehending. Pretty much what you see in the worldright now, you can put something together with it and know what it is or what it might be.But this was just – the non-comprehension factor – I couldn’t put together what it was orhow it could do that. You know, you can’t have something that big - it looked heavy, itlooked solid. You can’t do that! That doesn’t happen! I’ve never seen anything like thathappen, so how can that be happening.AND BE SILENT FOR MOST OF THE TIME.And be completely silent for all but a partial second. We had mules that were tied up. Theydidn’t do anything. Normally, they are like a watchdog. If anything happens, they let youknow. There was no movement from them - no braying or anything else. It’s justincomprehensible.My impression of immense power was the only thing that came through – almost like youcould feel the sound more than hear it.YOUR FINAL VIEW OF IT WAS WHAT?My final view was that we watched it for maybe 15 seconds as it slid like an escalator orice up out of this valley going from 6,000 feet to a little over 11,000 feet andapproximately for 7 miles distance.I was guessing it was moving about 40 mph, but to go that far in that amount of time, itwould be going over 100 miles to cover that distance in that amount of time. But with nosound, I guess, to be able to tell and it was so big.Everything was so smooth. It didn’t really seem like it picked up speed, although it had tohave speeded up. We watched it until it went out of sight over the horizon of the mountainat the top.WHAT DID YOU ALL SAY TO EACH OTHER AT THAT MOMENT?You know, I really don’t even remember us saying anything. We went back to the trailer. Iwalked in first. The other guy was an older gentleman. One of the things I remember is thatI walked to the door and he was looking at me kind of strange. I said, ‘What?’ And he said,‘Well, you are completely white!’I had a short sleeve shirt on and looked down and my arms and I assume face was, fromwhat he said, were as white as a sheet of paper."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"LIKE THE BLOOD HAD DRAINED TO YOUR ORGANS.Like the blood had drained clean out of me! (laughs) Yeah, it had a traumatic effect, morethan anything else I’d ever experienced.I was pretty shook up. I couldn’t stay there. I tried, but I couldn’t do it. So, we had todrive three hours to get to a motel (laughs)! I was going to try and stay there, but I couldn’tdo it. Like I say, I was just too shook up about the whole thing.WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT IT THATYOU WERE SO AFRAID OF?That I don’t know. There was nothing – I guess like Marc said, something sitting right overthe top of you is kind of a threatening posture. When he saw it, the craft was movingaway, so it was not in a threatening posture. It would be like the difference between if youhad a grizzly bear standing over you to eat you, or if a grizzly bear is running away fromyou. You have a whole different feel for what is going on.There was nothing I can say was threatening other than it was totally no comprehension ofwhat it was. That’s what scared me.”After our interview, I emailed to Kris and Marc a scan of the SOM1-01 Page 20 withextraterrestrial craft illustrations, including the triangle. Kris told me that he and hisbrother had never seen any triangular aircraft or photos before their own encounter andthat my email of the SOM1-01 page surprised them. Kris said, “I was shocked at how closethe 1954 illustration in that document was to what I saw on September 27, 2000.”Continued in Part 2 - Marc Bales Earthfiles would like to learn about other unidentified aerial triangle sightings similar tothe illustration in the SOM1-01 1954 training manual, what the Bales brothers saw andwhat flew over Belgium in March 1990.
