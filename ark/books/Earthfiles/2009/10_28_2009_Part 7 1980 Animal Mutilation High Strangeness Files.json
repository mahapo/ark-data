This segmentcontinues on September 22, 1980, after the high strangeness at Iona Hoeppner's Briggsdale,Colorado, high school lab.Laramie, Wyoming, is not far over the Colorado border from Sterling,Greeley and Briggsdale, a 2-state region intensely affected by the animalmutilation phenomena since at least the early 1970s.September 1980September 22 - 14 miles SW of Laramie, Wyoming, Ronald McDonaldRanch: Mr. McDonald began looking for his missing 300-pound, 1.5-years-oldpregnant heifer missing on Saturday, September 20, and the dead cow's body onMonday, September 22, 1980.Another rancher in Bosler, Wyoming, called me on September 24th about the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"new mutilation. Pat McGuire told me, \"No maggots and not much deteriorationbecause weather was cool.\"a) Cow lying on left side and lower jaw stripped of all flesh.b) 2 inches of hide taken from nose.c) Four of six teats removed and remaining two \"squashed funny.\"d) Rectum cored out about size of grapefruit.e) Eyes, tongue and tail were intact.I called Sheriff Deputy Jim Conyers in Laramie. He visited the heifer's carcassand told me the pregnant heifer had started to decompose, did smell and wasquite bloated, but no maggots! There were coyote tracks around her body, but nosigns of predator attack.The udder was not well developed and Dep. Conyers confirmed four teats hadbeen excised. He could not see any teeth marks from normal predators.Rectum and vaginal area excised. He said it was a 12-inch-diameter circleexcision that was \"pretty symmetrical.\" There was no out-pouching of intestines,but there was some intestinal tissue lying 15 to 20 feet from the heifer. Deputywondered if coyotes had grabbed tissue and dragged it away (not wanting to staynear heifer's body?)The heifer was found at the bottom of a ridge next to irrigation ditch in an areathat could not be seen from road.Dep. Conyers said that Dr. Hancock at the Wyoming State Vet Lab had seenseveral cows and sheep recently with similar mutilation appearance andattributed the deaths to \"alkali water poisoning.\"Hancock did visit the McDonald mutilation, did not do any microscopicexamination of wounds, but concluded the rectal circular hole and excised teatswere all predator scavenging after natural alkali water poisoning death.On October 6, 1980, I talked with Dr. Hancock at the Wyoming State Vet Lab.He told me he has \"NEVER in any year confirmed one case of a mutilation\"where there was evidence that the animal was cut with a sharp instrument.But I told him I had interviewed Carl Whiteside, Director of the ColoradoBureau of Investigation in Denver who confirmed for me that \"9 out of 19 CBImutilation cases were deemed \"cut with a sharp instrument\" by the ColoradoState University vet lab in 1975 to 1976 alone.Dr. Hancock told me that Albany County, Wyoming, had been having an alkaliwater problem that causes polio encelphalo malacia, softening of brain tissue knownas \"forage poisoning,\" probably from alkalines that get into water fromirrigation. He said he had seen ten cows and ten sheep in his office that had diedfrom the forage poisoning.Oddly, in the face of Colorado's own mutilation vet lab statistics, Dr. Hancockdismisses with scorn the idea there are animal mutilations linked to UFOs. Theirony for me is that it was law enforcement who told me, at first off the record,the perpetrators of animal mutilations were \"creatures from outer space\" - andthat was right from the beginning of my first inquiries about animal mutilationsin September 1979.September 23, 1980 - Unidentified aerial object reported by John Cumby ofLittleton, Colorado:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Littleton, Colorado, is a southwestern Denver suburb that overlapsArapahoe and Jefferson Counties. John Cumby's home was inmore rural Jefferson County (bottom blue circle).On Tuesday evening, September 23, 1980, at 7 PM Mtn, John Cumby was on thephone in his kitchen looking out a window that faces west toward the foothillsand mountains west of south Denver in Jefferson County. Cumby's view faces apastureland of the Roy Hunt Horse Boarding business, but the pasture is used tograze cattle.Cumby told me it looked like a large and dark helicopter was coming straighttoward his house low, about 100 feet elevation. The lowness caught his attentionand he called to his children to run into the front yard to see it. Cumby watchedthe object come to about a mile from his house, stop in mid-air and start risingvery slowly. The western sky still had enough light in it that the helicopter was aclear silhouette and he believes there was no rotor blades whirring. Further, hedidn't hear any noise at all.John Cumby told me, \"As the 'helicopter' rose upward, it seemed to turn into a'ball shape.' I yelled for my mother-in-law to run out into the yard, too, while Iwas still on the phone. She said as the object rose, it changed into a 'squareshape.'\" She watched it rise to about 4,000 to 5,000 feet, she estimated.Meanwhile, John Cumby finally got off the phone and ran for his binoculars.During that time, the mother-in-law watched the UFO disappear and re-appearwith \"something fluttering below it\" and then shot straight up out of sight.Sketch by Mother-In-Law Mary HutchisonTime: 7:02 PM Mtn, September 23, 1980, foothills of Littleton, Colorado. Looking straight westtoward the foothills and Rocky Mountains, at “5,000 feet approximately above ground level,the object leveled off with a part moving, dark in color, then disappeared for a second, thenreappeared several hundred feet to the right at same altitude for a second and then thewhole thing (intact) shot straight up out of sight in less than a second. My 6-year-old(grand) child describes it as ‘a circle in the sky.’’’ Sketch © 1980 by Mary Hutchison."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Sketch by John CumbyJohn Cumby: “Time: 7:00 PM, September 23, 1980, sun had set 5 - 10 minutes before, clearskies, no wind or clouds. Object was moving toward house at approx. 100 feet above groundlevel at a slow speed. I was on the phone at the time and called my mother-in-law (MaryHutchison) and 6-year-old child to go out in the back yard as the object moved up beyond myview from (where I was) inside the house. It was dark in color, no lights, except for a silver tintas it started up changing in form to a more round and smaller size. It ascended at around 3,000feet per minute. That was the last I saw of it; however, my mother-in-law and son saw it in theyard. Visibility was unrestricted. My view from window was looking west across Kipling justsouth of Bowles. Object appeared less than 1 mile and closing for one minute, then stopped andstarted to rise, growing smaller in size.” Sketch by John Cumby, Littleton, Colorado. I called the Roy Hunt Horse Boarding to see if they had seen or heard anythingunusual that night either in the sky or among their animals. I talked with DebbieHunt. She and her husband, Roy Hunt, leased the U-Bar-S Ranch for 9.5 years.She said that at 7 PM on Tuesday, September 23, they were getting ready to go toa meeting and did not notice anything unusual. The pasture near John Cumby'shouse is where the Hunts pasture their cattle. Mrs. Hunt checked the cattle rightafter I phoned and said she could not find any missing or anything unusual.Then she volunteered the following story: Two years ago in April 1978,something weird did happen. The Horse Boarding place has three houses setaround a lake. They were in one house; other people were in the middle andfurthest house. At around 11 PM, or near midnight, in her house, the doorbellsuddenly went off and would not stop ringing. There are two glass doors to theirshower. One was shattered inside the door frame, but nothing fallen on the floor,and not one piece of shattered shower door glass was larger than 1/4-inchacross. The other adjacent door was unaffected.In addition to the doorbell suddenly ringing without stopping, the massagerunder their bed also went off making sounds. Yet, both of their television setsremained normal.However, in the middle house on the lake, a woman there said, 'It sounded likesomething sat on the roof of the house. I actually felt pressure somehow fromthe air.\" The B&W television set she was watching became filled with static andafter that, the TV never worked right again.An electrician was called to that house and was puzzled that a low voltagedoorbell and a high voltage massager would both be set off at the same time.
