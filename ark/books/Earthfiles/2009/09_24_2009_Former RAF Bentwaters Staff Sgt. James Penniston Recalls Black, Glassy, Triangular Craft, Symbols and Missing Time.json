Penniston was RAF Woodbridge Security Supervisor on December 26, 1980. He was26-years-old at the time and had been in the U. S. Air Force since 1973 after graduatingfrom Freeport High School in Freeport, Illinois. His RAF Bentwaters Deputy BaseCommander was Col. Charles I. Halt.Col. Charles I. Halt (Ret.) on left with Sgt. James Penniston (Ret.) in 2007.Not long after the clock changed to midnight after Christmas, Sgt. Penniston received aradio call from Central Security Control (CSC) asking him to proceed to the RAFWoodbridge East Gate. There he was to contact his counterpart on the police side ofmilitary security, law enforcement supervisor Staff Sergeant (SSgt) Bud Steffens. USAFpolice handle domestic issues and who is coming in and out of the base. USAF securityprotect the base perimeter, resources and flight line operations. On December 26th, at least14 security personnel and 6 air force policemen were working RAF Woodbridge. One ofthose air force policemen was Airman 1st Class John Burroughs who reported to Sgt. BudSteffens.When Staff Sergeant Jim Penniston arrived at the East Gate, Sgt. Steffens told him therewas a problem in the Rendlesham forest. Sgt. Penniston could see reddish-orange light inthe trees, assumed it was a crashed airplane on fire in the woods, and asked Sgt. Steffens,“When did it crash?” But Sgt. Steffens said, “Jim, it did not crash. It landed.” Puzzled, Sgt. Penniston called the 81st Police Squadron Shift Commander, Lt. Fred “Skip”Buran, and asked for an Eastern Radar check. Lt. Buran told Sgt. Penniston there was anobject over the base and that “something had disappeared off radar.” That convinced ShiftCommander Lt. Buran to give Sgt. Penniston permission to go off base to investigate. Sgt.Penniston asked Sgt. Steffens to go with him into the woods, but Steffens did not want toleave base property. So, John Burroughs volunteered to join Sgt. Penniston and AirmanCabansag. The three men traveled in a pickup truck from the East Gate toward the fierylight in the forest.They drove as far as they could to the trees, parked and walked closer to the mysteriouslights that were colored red, orange and blue. Their radios were interrupted by unusualstatic and Sgt. Penniston asked Ed Cabansag to go back toward the truck and act as a radiorelay between Sgt. Penniston, Airman Burroughs and Central Security Control.Airman Richard Bertolino and Sgt. Hall on Bunker Hill had been able to hear Sgt.Penniston’s radio communications at the beginning of their walk into the forest. Then therewas the radio static and Security Control called for radio silence, cutting off Bertolino andHall. John Burroughs says recently he has learned from their 81st Security PoliceSquadron Shift Commander that night, Lt. Fred Buran, that radio silence was called forbecause Security Control lost all communications with Sgt. Penniston and John Burroughsfor about 45 minutes.Retired Staff Sergeant Jim Penniston begins now with his and John Burrough's approach tothe bright lights in Rendlesham Forest."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Interview:Former USAF Staff Sgt. James W. Penniston stationed at the joint RAF Bentwatersand RAF Woodbridge bases in Suffolk County, England, in 1980, was assigned asRAF Woodbridge Security Supervisor on December 26, 1980: “It was apparent it wasnot an airplane crash – there was no fire, there was no fumes or anything like that fromanything burning. What it was was a very bright light illuminating from the forest floor.COLOR?Bright white.SO, IT'S NO LONGER THE RED, THE ORANGE AND THE BLUES - IT IS NOWONLY WHITE.Correct. It was very hard to see at that point in time.IT WAS SO BRIGHT?Yeah, it was very luminous, yes.DO YOU REMEMBER IF AIRMAN 1ST CLASS JOHN BURROUGHS IS THE ONLYPERSON WITH YOU AT THAT POINT?That's correct. It was John and I and when we approached the craft, what I wanted to dowas establish what I had was a craft of unknown origin sitting in front of me and I wasgoing to ascertain whether or not this was hostile or a threat to the resources on the base.WHAT ARE YOU SEEING IN THE LIGHT WITH YOUR OWN EYES AND MIND?It was a triangular craft. The fabric of the craft was black and like glass. Then throughoutthe fabric of the craft, there was some coloring, lighting, varying from saucer shape to pieshape circles that moved around the craft. They were colored. Some were red, blue andsome yellow, or more orange.John was still with me and I started taking observations in the notebook to coordinate thetime I was there and what my actions were. IF YOU COULD GIVE US A FEW MORE DETAILS ABOUT THIS BLACK, GLASSYTRIANGLE - THAT YOU WERE SEEING WHAT LOOKED LIKE CHANGINGGEOMETRIC PATTERENS OF DIFFERENT COLORS BELOW THE GLASS? ORABOVE THE GLASS?Predominantly below the glass on the underside of the craft and then occasionally movingaround to the upper side of the craft. It appeared that the coloring was part of the actualcraft fabric. It made no sense. I've never seen anything that had that type of effect before.CAN YOU SEE THROUGH THE BLACK GLASS INTO THE INTERIOR?No, it was fully opaque. As we approached it, though, that's when I stepped offmeasurements of the craft. It measured approximately 9 feet long - that was three longsteps with my stride - and approximately 6.5 feet tall. The fabric of the craft wascompletely opaque and glass-like. Occasionally you would get some movement of colorthroughout the fabric of the craft - sometimes a small glob that was probably six inchesacross, the color. Sometimes 12 inches across, but they were very sporadic color.THESE WERE CIRCLES THAT WOULD CHANGE THEIR SIZE FROM SOMETHINGLIKE 6 INCHES TO 12 INCHES WHEN THEY MOVED OVER THE SURFACE OFTHE DARK BLACK GLASS?That is correct. It's hard to describe. But I think what stands out in my memory is theblackness of the craft. The best way to describe that craft is if you had an onyx stone thatmeasured 9 feet long and 6 feet high - that's what you would see.WOW, AMAZING!Yeah, to say the least (laughs). It was very unusual."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Black onyx stone from Brazil. Image by Heartofstonestudio.com. WERE YOU THINKING AT THAT MOMENT: ‘THIS IS NOT FROM EARTH’?I knew it was not from any form of government - I mean, no air force on Earth. No! It wasbeyond our capability.DID YOU SAY TO JOHN BURROUGHS THEN, ‘THIS LOOKS LIKE SOMETHINGFROM OUTER SPACE’?I looked at John and said, ‘I don't know how in the hell we're going to explain this!’DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT HE SAID?John says, ‘We have a UFO here.’ And I said, ‘We have something here.’ I said, ‘I have tohave quiet here. I've got to have some quiet!’I did do the walk around the craft at that point in time and as I walked around that craft, Ihad already paced it off, so this was my second or third time I was walking around it -mainly in awe. Toward the one side of the craft, there were markings on the craft, whichwere very unusual. They measured probably 2.5 to 3 feet wide. They were a series ofetchings, it seemed like to me, like they were etched in the fabric of the craft. They feltthat way to the touch anyway.AND WHEN DID YOU TOUCH IT?Second or third go around I was walking around the craft. The first time I didmeasurements of the size. The second time I was looking for compartments or crewcompartments or a window or something! It was completely void of all that. It was acompletely smooth surface. Since there was no indication that there was going to beanything hostile from it - it was doing absolutely nothing. It was benign at that point, so Iconsidered it was not a threat to the base itself. As I was walking around examining it, Iwas looking underneath and touched it and the feeling for that actually - the airtemperature out there at the time was probably - I don't know, maybe 34 degrees F.,something like that. And the craft was very warm to the touch. I would say, if I had toguesstimate, the temperature, the craft was probably like 60 degrees F.YOU WERE FEELING HEAT AND WHAT ELSE?The smoothness of the craft. I was trying to figure it out - it feels like glass, but it can't beglass. It's got to be metal, at least with my experience the craft would be metal. But it feltlike glass. I was confused at that point because nothing in my training or in my pastexperience prepared me for what was going on.As I felt my way around the craft, I came upon the symbols that were on the craft and Igave them a lot more attention, feeling each one and then recording it in my notebook."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Staff Sergeant James W. Penniston's sketch of symbols that were etchedwith the texture of sandpaper over about 3 feet of the dark, glassy craft’s surface,averaging about 3-inches high.Staff Sergeant James W.

Penniston during the three nights of Rendlesham Forestunidentified lights, beams and craft activity.YOU'VE DRAGGED YOUR HAND ACROSS THE SURFACE OF THE DARK,GLASSY, TRIANGULAR CRAFT, AND YOU PUT YOUR FINGERS INSIDE EACH OFTHE SYMBOLS THAT YOU'VE DRAWN IN YOUR NOTEBOOK?I put my fingers on top of them. There was no indention. They just seemed like an etchingon the craft. If you had a sheet of smooth glass and you took a piece of sandpaper and youlaid it on that glass and running from the glass surface to the sandpaper, that's how it felt.OH, SO IT IS NOT ENGRAVED IN AND IT'S NOT RAISED AS MUCH AS IT IS ADIFFERENT SURFACE TEXTURE?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Correct.WHEN YOUR FINGERS TOUCHED THE SYMBOLS, DID YOU HAVE ANYTHINGCOME INTO YOUR MIND IN TERMS OF THOUGHT OR IMAGE?Well, that's the part I just don't really know when it happened, but - yeah, did I feelintelligence? Yes!DID ANYTHING GO INTO MIND IN TERMS OF PICTURE OR THOUGHT?None that I can recall, but here is something that is odd. I lost track of John for 45 minutesor so. I don't know where he was at, but I don't know if it was because I was mesmerizedby what was going on in front of me or what. There's like a 45 minute gap of time there,which seemed like - I don't know - a couple of minutes. I don't know what caused thedistortion.JOHN BURROUGHS CANNOT REMEMBER SEEING YOU DRAWING IN ANOTEBOOK. HE CANNOT REMEMBER SEEING YOU TOUCH THE CRAFT. HECANNOT REMEMBER SEEING YOU PHOTOGRAPHING. YOU DID HAVE ACAMERA AND TOOK PHOTOS, CORRECT?Correct.WHAT DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT THAT PERIOD WHEN YOU WEREPHOTOGRAPHING?I took as many photographs as I had in the camera and as fast as I could walking aroundthe outside of the craft. They were before the first walk around.SO, THE FIRST THING YOU DID WAS TAKE THE PHTOGRAPHS?Yeah.DID YOU WALK AROUND THE CRAFT WHEN YOU TOOK THE PHOTOS?A partial walk around. I did probably 90 to 160 degrees.HOW MANY IMAGES WERE THERE?I believe there were 36 on the roll.THIS WAS 35MM COLOR NEGATIVE IN DECEMBER 1980, CORRECT?It was black and white. I was going to use it if there was a crash scene.YOU'D TAKEN IT OUT OF THE TRUCK WHERE YOU LEFT CABANSAG?Yeah, I left the truck with it.AND IF THE VERY FIRST ACTION THAT YOU TOOK WAS TO USE THE CAMERAWITH THE BLACK AND WHITE NEGATIVE FILM IN IT TO PHOTOGRAPH THEVERY UNUSUAL OBJECT IN RENDLESHAM FOREST AND JOHN BURROUGHSDOES NOT REMEMBER YOU PHOTOGRAPHING, IT MEANS THAT JOHNBURROUGHS WAS APPARENTLY NOT AWARE OF WHAT YOU WERE DOINGRIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING OF YOUR TIME CLOSE TO THE CRAFT?We were together. (laughs) I don't have an explanation, but what we were seeing was outof the ordinary, you know, and John was agitated, but it's understandable. I mean, he wasexcited, agitated, from the time of the East Gate all the way out there. I had moreexperience. I had been to a lot of crash sites.WHEN IS YOUR VERY NEXT MEMORY OF JOHN BURROUGHS?When the light on the craft began to generate to a more white, brilliant light is when Ibacked way from the craft, John was maybe fifteen feet away, or twenty feet awaystanding there.BECAUSE YOU WERE AFRAID OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH THISINCREASING LIGHT?I wasn't sure what it was going to do. I don't know - explode? Or ...? I was concerned.SO BOTH YOU AND JOHN ARE ON THE GROUND FLAT?Yes, in a prone position. Yes."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THEN WHAT HAPPENS?The craft lifted off the forest floor, went to treetop level and took off at an extreme rate ofspeed and John and I stood up at that point in time. Nothing that I know of could be gonein the blink of an eye.DO YOU REMEMBER RECALLING SOME MENTAL IMPRESSION OR WORDTHOUGHT THAT YOU RELATE TO TOUCHING THE SYMBOLS ON THETRIANGULAR CRAFT?Well, it was very hard to sleep at night after that, especially the following two weeks. AndI had this feeling and the feeling was that there would be a return some time of that craft.
