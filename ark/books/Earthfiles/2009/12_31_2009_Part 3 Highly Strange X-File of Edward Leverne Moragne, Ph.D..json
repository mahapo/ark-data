Moragne, Ph.D., Physicist Return to Part 1December 31, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuation of Linda MoultonHowe's May 8, 1997, interview with Edward Leverne Moragne, Ph.D., at his Houston,Te x a s , h o m e : “IN 1964 AT EDWARDS AFB, YOU TOUCHED THE CRAFT ALL OVER ANDWATCHED OTHERS TRYING TO BURN AND CUT THROUGH THE DISC'SSURFACE WITHOUT SUCCESS. WHAT ELSE DID YOU DO?Well, I tried a bunch of different acids that didn't do anything. I looked at the landing gearsthoroughly. They weren't using hydraulics. It was a screw affair.SCRE WS?Like a turn thing operated from another arm. If one was sliding in one piece like this(demonstrates with his hands) and had a gear turning this up and down - and back herewas a screw that turned that gear that brought those arms up and down. I could see a holejust big enough for the footing to go up through there.DO YOU MEAN ONE OF THE TRIPOD LEGS THAT SUPPORTED THE DISC?Yes, they were about 10-feet-long.SO THE THREE TRIPOD LEGS HELD THE BIG DISC UP TEN FEET OFF THEGROUND?Yes. I never did see them come in or out. They just stayed as a tripod support to the craft.The only thing that I saw go back into the disc was the staircase.SO WHEN THE MILITARY TRANSPORTED THE CRAFT FROM THE NEVADADESERT, THOSE TRIPOD LEGS WERE STICKING OUT EVEN THEN?As far as I know, yeah. And they were still sticking out when they got to Edwards AFBand couldn't fit the craft into a hangar there, so it was hauled to Air Force 5 hangar insouthern Nevada.WHAT DID THE SCIENTISTS, DAVID AND DAVIS, TELL YOU THEY LEARNED?It's not like metal as we know metal. It could be another type of material altogether.DID THOSE TWO MEN AGREE IT WAS AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT ANDTHOSE WERE EXTRATERRESTRIAL HUMANOIDS IN IT AND ON THE GROUND?They'd have to be from outer space somewhere. I got a report from someone in ourgovernment on robotics written by a very brilliant Chinese scientist. He worked for NASA.WHAT DID THAT SCIENTIST THINK ABOUT THE ROBOT HYPOTHESIS?He wrote a big article that said the only way we could hope to go to distant planets wouldbe to produce robots that humans could control from Earth or from space stations that wemight build in space.SO, THAT'S WHAT YOU, YOUR SCIENCE COLLEAGUES AND THE MILITARYWERE WORRIED ABOUT - THAT THE HUMANOIDS WERE ROBOTS UNDER THE"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CONTROL OF YET SOME OTHER INTELLIGENCE?Yes. They definitely weren't like people. They had to be robots, or androids. [ Robots aremechanical and controlled by outside programming; androids are biological and controlledby outside programming.]YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE THE HUMANOIDS HAD NO BLOOD VESSELS, NOHEART BEAT AND NO BREATHING?We discovered the humanoids had electronic units in their heads that resembled klystrontubes.HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?We x-rayed them. The U. S. authorities took the x-rays and I was told the power that hadto be put into the x-ray energy would kill a man in a few seconds. But they got picturesand those things looked like klystron tubes in those heads.[ Editor's Note: A klystron tube is used to produce microwave energy. In thisapplication, it works in a similar manner to a pipe organ tube, except that theklystron tube uses electrons, while the pipe organ tube uses air. When the airin the organ tube vibrates, the pipe organ tube emits sound energy of aspecific frequency that we hear as a single note. When the electrons in theklystron tube vibrate, the klystron tube emits high frequency microwaveenergy that can be detected by a radar receiver. Klystron amplifiers have theadvantage (over the magnetron) of coherently amplifying a reference signal soits output may be precisely controlled in amplitude, frequency and phase.Many klystrons have a waveguide for coupling microwave energy into and outof the device, although it is also quite common for lower power and lowerfrequency klystrons to use coaxial couplings instead. Klystron combines aGreek verb referring to the action of waves breaking against a shore with theend of the word electron.]The wiring diagrams looked like they were similar because all the components weresimilar.YOU SAW THE X-RAYS YOURSELF?Yes. Dr. Graham, head of that military intelligence unit, showed them to me. He told me, 'Ican't figure any of that stuff out.'I said, 'Well, in high frequency techniques, we use the klystron tube to send signals out onradar. And they are bounced back and picked up on a Fermi tube. I could give you yourpicture so it comes back. Then you have to condense it down into whatever form youwant.'Dr. Moragne explained that he could make the radar machines show a real picture or just a'bug,' like the white dots on radar today. Otherwise, we had a screen marked off in milesand if this thing is over here in a 50-mile-zone, they look at it and say it is so many degreesnorth of here or there and you can see the outline of a ship on there.HAVE YOU EVER SEEN DISKS OR OTHER TYPES OF NON-HUMAN CRAFTMOVING ON RADAR?No, but they showed me videos they had taken, on like what we would call today acamcorder-type device. The government was videotaping in 1964, when the rest of theworld didn't know it.WHAT DID YOU SEE IN THE X-RAYS DR. GRAHAM SHOWED YOU?I saw a bunch of electronic parts. I could not tell you what they did because we had nowiring diagram to go by and the x-ray didn't even show the path of whatever wires werethere. It just showed components.WHAT KIND OF COMPONENTS?They looked like tubes to me - they might have been metal. They could not have beenglass because they wouldn't have showed up in the x-ray. But from the connectors on topof the tubes and on the two sides and the bottom, they looked like klystron tubes to me.YOU USED A KLYSTRON TUBE IN RADAR BACK THEN TO DO WHAT?To put out a beam that was a microwave and it would wave out and come back in.WHAT RECEIVED BACK THE MICROWAVE BEAM?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The Fermi tube.IF THE HUMANOIDS HAD KLYSTRON TUBES IN THEIR HEADS, DOES THATSUGGEST THEY WERE SENDING OUT RADAR SIGNALS?They were sending a lot of information out of their heads. They could send out 10 millionsignals at one time with as many tubes as they had in their heads. With only one tube, youcan send out several million signals - with each jolt of electricity. For instance, theauthorities found that those klystron tubes were so fast and could handle so many signalsat one time, that you could feed a bunch of mathematical formulas in there and punch thebutton and get answers. They really speeded up computation.DID YOU TALK WITH DR. GRAHAM OR DAVID OR DAVIS ABOUT THE BEINGSTRANSMITTING RADAR SIGNALS?You could not say what size or power or if there was one signal a month, a week oranything.DID YOU TRY TO MEASURE THE MICROWAVES COMING OFF THE BEINGS?We tried everything you can think of. We didn't know if it was short wave, short signal,long signal or what kind of signal they were giving off.SINCE 1964, HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TOLD THAT LATER MEASUREMENTS WITHBETTER OR DIFFERENT EQUIPMENT CONFIRMED WHAT TYPE OF SIGNALS?I think the government would have turned to other people in NASA in radio signals andcomputers, not me. When I told them back in 1964 that the x-rays showed klystron tubesin those heads, the authorities asked me why I would say that. I told them the connectionslooked like they were wired up that way with eight connection points for wires. So I knewthose tubes were getting signals from something and sending signals back to somewhere.WHAT DID THE AUTHORITIES TELL YOU?They said that makes sense if you're talking about the radar like we've got. I said, 'I'm nottalking about what they DO have in those heads. I am assuming all this.'WHO WAS THE LAST PERSON YOU TALKED TO ABOUT THE CRAFT ANDBEINGS?There was an FBI man who went out there. He asked me if I went in a spacecraft. And Itold him I sure didn't. He says, 'You didn't go inside of one?' I said, 'Nope, never did.' Thenhe laughed and said, 'Well we've got information that you did.' I said, 'Your information iswrong. If I had gone inside, I'd be bringing information to you. I wouldn't be hiding it.' Ithink then he believed me.WHAT DID YOU TELL THE FBI MAN YOU HAD DONE?I told him I was all alone and looked at the craft to see if I could add anything to what theyalready knew. I said I checked a lot of things and wondered why the humanoids weredoing what they were doing. We used hydraulic lifters to raise things up. I also wonderedwhy extraterrestrials would use screws?DID THE FBI MAN TALK ABOUT OTHER CRAFT AND BEINGS?No.YOU HAVE PATENTS IN YOUR NAME, RIGHT? ARE ANY OF THEM RELATED TOWHAT YOU LEARNED FROM THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT AND BEINGS?I have 319 patents. Some relate to weapons systems and some not. But you can't getcopies of them now because they are classified.ARE THE WEAPON SYSTEMS TO BE USED ON HUMANS OR SOMETHING INOUTER SPACE?I can't tell you about that either, but some of them could be used in outer space.” To be continued in Part 4.Return to Part 1"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"More Information:For further information about “Dr. Epigoni,” please see Earthfiles Archive:• 01/26/2005 — Final Part 28: UFO Crash/Retrievals: The Inner Sanctum - Status Report VI ©July 1991 by Leonard H.
