Redoubt means a strong fortification. The 10,200-foot volcano towers abovefishermen in the Cook Inlet. The big mountain looks something like a protective fortress,which probably explains its name.Mount Redoubt rises 10,200 feet above the Cook Inlet of Alaska,a hundred miles southwest of Anchorage. Image by Wikipedia.The volcano began venting and rumbling in January 2009, and in the first week ofFebruary, its seismic activity has increased so much that the Alaska Volcano Observatoryhas warned Mount Redoubt could erupt in days or a couple of weeks.Twenty years ago on December 15, 1989, the Mt. Redoubt volcano erupted with anexplosion of gas and ash that rose 40,000 feet and went 150 miles away into the path of aKLM jetliner that carried 231 passengers. The airliner’s four engines flamed out. As thecrew tried to restart the engines, smoke and strong sulfur smell filled the cockpit and cabin.Then the jet dropped more than two miles before the crew was able to restart all enginesand land the plane safely at Anchorage Airport. That plane required $80 million in repairs.Mount Redoubt’s 1989 eruption also sent mud flows into the Drift River valley and causedflooding. The volcano kept erupting for five months, until April 1990."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Mount Redoubt, Alaska, volcanic eruption on December 15, 1989, sent gas and ash up40,000 feet and 150 miles away, interrupting international air traffic. Image by USGS.Now at the end of the first week of February 2009, the Alaska Volcano Observatory(AVO) states at its website: “Based on all available monitoring data and knowledge of thisvolcano, an eruption similar to, or smaller than, the 1989-1990 eruption appears to be themost probable outcome at this time.”What a lot of people don’t realize is that Alaska contains over 130 volcanoes which havebeen active within the last two million years. Of those, more than 50 have been active overthe past 250 years and any of those can erupt any time with serious consequences topeople and animals.The biggest volcanic eruption in the 20th century was Mt. Katmai southwestof Mt. Redoubt in 1912, known as the “Novarupta” eruption. Thick ash producednearly complete darkness for three days and the eruption left a 6-mile-widecaldera (10 kilometers).

It is about 6 miles (10 km) in diameter with a central lake-filledcaldera about 3 by 2 mi (4.5 by 3 km) in area, formed during the Novaruptaeruption of 1912. Mount Katmai is one of five vents encircling the Novaruptadome, source of the eruption and associated voluminous pyroclastic flows in1912. The volcano has caused ten known fatalities due to gas exposure.” ] The United States Geological Survey monitor’s Alaska’s volcanoes and the ever-active Yellowstone Park, and all other potentially active volcanic regions of the United States.The USGS Volcano Hazards Program Coordinator is John Eichelberger, Ph.D., in Reston,Virginia. He received his Ph.D. in Geology from Stanford University and worked asProfessor of Volcanology at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks for sixteen years. SinceMount Redoubt caused problems with international air traffic in its 1989-1990 eruption, this week I asked Dr. Eichelberger what happens if there are airplanes in the sky over theCook Inlet when Mount Redoubt erupts again?Interview:John Eichelberger, Ph.D., Volcano Hazards Program Coordinator, U. S. GeologicalSurvey, Reston, Virginia: “Well, there will be airplanes in the sky! (laughs) There areover 20,000 people a day that fly in the vicinity of Alaska’s volcanoes. That’s the main airroute between North America and Eastern Asia. But, we will know immediately whenMount Redoubt or any other monitored volcano in Alaska erupts. The aviation industry isnow acutely aware of this problem and pay close attention to the warnings that we put out.WHAT IF MOUNT REDOUBT BLOWS ITS STACK TOMORROW?The AVO immediately does a call-down to the Federal Aviation Administration, othergovernment agencies and puts out electronic messages as well. The message gets out very"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"fast to everyone that an eruption is in progress.DOES USGS GET IN TOUCH WITH THE FAA?Oh, yes, immediately!OK, SO RADIO ANNOUNCEMENTS WOULD GO OUT FROM THE FAA TO ANYAIRLINERS IN THE ANCHORAGE OR COOK INLET AREA?Ye s .THEN WHAT DO THE AIRPLANES DO?They will divert. The National Weather Service projects where the ash will be going andwe provide some guidance on that as well. It depends on how close the planes are to theerupting volcano. If they are very close, they might have to turn around.FROM YOUR PROFESSIONAL ESTIMATE RIGHT NOW IN FEBRUARY 2009,WOULD YOU GIVE YOUR PERCEPTION ABOUT HOW LIKELY MOUNTREDOUBT IS TO ERUPT THIS MONTH?It’s very likely. We made the statement that an eruption is likely in days to two weeks timeframe. In fact, based on the 1989-1990 scenario, we are expecting there would be aneruption by now. It’s fairly straightforward to be able to say the volcano has awakened,that molten rock is moving up beneath the thing.But one of the big problems we have is the false positive. The process can stop at any timeand not necessarily after molten rock reaches the surface. So, we are waiting. Seismic Activity Best Indicatorof Impending Volcanic EruptionIS SEISMIC ACTIVITY THE GREATEST INDICATOR?It is. Seismic activity is kind of our number one tool because when molten rock is movingat depth, it breaks the solid rock around it and that makes little earthquakes. Also, the gasthat is released from the molten rock and the heat that turns underground water into gasflows through cracks and sets up a humming, or tremor signal. So, there are diagnostictechniques.There are some very tiny earthquakes that we can only detect with instruments right on thevolcano, and these are reliable guides to knowing that the volcano is going to erupt verysoon.Another important geophysical measurement that we are gradually putting on volcanoesand we don’t have, unfortunately, on Redoubt yet, are very sensitive GPS instruments thatcan measure swelling of the volcano, which can tell us when molten rock is actually upinside the volcano itself.WITH THE IMMINENT POSSIBLE ERUPTION RIGHT NOW IN FEBRUARY 2009,WHAT IS THE REASON THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE GPS INSTRUMENTSTHERE NOW?(laughs) Not enough money basically. These networks are expensive to install andmaintain. There are a lot of volcanoes in Alaska. We have been steadily adding thisinstrumentation on the most dangerous volcanoes. We have it on Augustine and Spurr, butwe don’t have them on Mount Redoubt yet.WHAT IS THE CURRENT SEISMIC ACTIVITY ON MOUNT REDOUBT ONFEBRUARY 4, 2009?Well, it’s perking along! The words are: ‘Well above background.’ Last weekend (January30 - 31, 2009) really looked like the start of an eruption, but it wasn’t. Right now, it’s justsitting there just perking. Eruption Consequences toDrift River and Cook InletWHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES TO THE DRIFT RIVER AND COOK INLET?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Back in the December 1989 to April 1990 Redoubt eruption, there were something liketwenty episodes over a period of five months and that’s fairly likely to happen again thistime. There will be more than a single eruption of ash. There are likely to be a number oferuptions and usually the early ones are the most explosive, but they will likely involvemud flows going down the Drift River valley.THAT DOES WHAT TO THE RIVER?Well, it fills it in and those can travel a long way and likely reach Cook Inlet. In the lastepisode, they inundated an oil storage facility there. Now there are berms built aroundthose tanks and the berms have been strengthened.BUT FLOODING IS A REAL AND POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCE.It is, yes.IF THERE WERE A SERIES OF GAS AND ASH ERUPTIONS FOR FIVE MONTHS,WOULDN’T THAT REALLY HAMPER THE AIR TRAVEL GOING OVER THE POLE?It depends on how big the explosive events are. It will hamper air travel in the Cook Inletregion and travel between Alaska and the lower 48 states.WHAT IS THE WORST CASE THAT COULD HAPPEN?The seismic activity before an eruption is a reasonable indicator of how big an eruptionwill be. This seismic activity now is on the same scale that occurred before the lasteruption episode.BETWEEN DECEMBER 1989 AND APRIL 1990.Yes. There is no reason to expect anything bigger than that eruption. Of course, the worstpossible case of huge eruptions would be crippling over a huge area. The largest eruptionof the 20th Century occurred on the Alaska Peninsula not too far away at Katmai in 1912.“That put a foot of ash on the city of Kodiak, which was 100 miles downwind.A FULL FOOT OF ASH!Yes, 100 miles away.WHAT DID MOUNT ST. HELENS DO AT ITS WORST?Mt. St. Helens was only about 1/100th of the Katmai eruption in 1912.SO, IF MOUNT REDOUBT GOES ANYWHERE BETWEEN WHAT IT DID 20 YEARSAGO AND BIGGER, THERE REALLY COULD BE AIRLINE INTERRUPTIONS,POSSIBILITY OF FLOODS AND A LOT OF ASH COVERING A LARGE REGIONBETWEEN THE VOLCANO AND ANCHORAGE FOR QUITE A WHILE?Yeah, but it’s highly unlikely that there would be eruption much bigger than what we’veseen from Redoubt. That would be a nuisance, a protracted nuisance to air travel. Worst Case Volcanic Eruption?GIVEN THE POST-KATRINA AGE WHEN NOTHING OF THAT SIZE WASEXPECTED EITHER WITH UNEXPECTED CONSEQUENCES STILL ONGOINGAND PROBABLY WILL BE FOR A LONG TIME, IT SEEMS LIKE IN THIS NEWADMINISTRATION THAT IS TRYING SO HARD FOR TRANSPARENCY ANDSTRAIGHTFORWARDNESS THAT WE ALL OUGHT TO BE TALKING ABOUTWORST CASE INCIDENTS TO GIVE THE PUBLIC A CHANCE TO THINK ABOUTPREPARATIONS THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED IF THERE IS A WORST CASE?WOULD YOU AGREE?Yes, but the worst cases should be reasonable, otherwise we’ll waste a lot of moneyworrying about things that are very unlikely to happen.UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS DO YOU THINK THAT THE U. S. GOVERNMENTWOULD HAVE TO SEND IN FEMA AND NATIONAL GUARD?A repeat of Katmai of 1912 would probably require something like that.THAT WOULD BE TO DEAL WITH ALL THE ASH AND TO HELP PEOPLE EVENSEE BECAUSE FOR A WHILE THEY CAN’T SEE IN THE DARK?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Yes, that’s right. With Katmai there were three days of almost total darkness.ARE THERE ANY ONGOING DIALOGUES BETWEEN FEMA AND THE USGSABOUT YOUR VARIOUS VOLCANO OBSERVATORIES AND WORST CASES ANDHOW DOES THE GOVERNMENT GET SOMETHING LIKE FEMA INTO AREASWHERE THERE MIGHT BE A NEAR-CATASTROPHE FROM A VOLCANO?Oh, yes, there is, especially post-Katrina, very close cooperation between governmentagencies. The USGS works a lot with the first responder communities. We go throughvarious eruption scenarios, tabletop exercises. We will be doing something like that, somekind of ash fall exercise, for the Anchorage region this spring.SO NO MATTER WHAT MOUNT REDOUBT DOES, YOU ALL HAVE BEENPREPARING TO COME IN AND WORK IN CLOSE QUARTERS WITH THE FIRSTRESPONDERS CLOSE HAND AND WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT?Yes, those preparations are going on all the time. Yellowstone Park - What If It Blows This Century?The Yellowstone volcano's huge caldera is outlined in red.The rising bulge is under the northern rim of the calderaat the Sour Creek Dome near Canyon.WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YELLOWSTONE COULD EXPLODE IN OURLIFETIME LIKE IT DID 640,000 YEARS AGO?Yellowstone is the biggest of these things and has been popularized as a super volcano. Butthere are many other calderas, huge craters, and a number of them are in Alaska. Katmai isthe smallest. Another, Aniakchak, which formed 3,400 years ago and Okmok, whichformed 2,000 years ago – those things are 10 kilometers (6 miles) in diameter.I think we should be thinking about not such colossal eruptions, but what would happen ifthere were a Katmai-sized eruption.IN YELLOWSTONE.Or anywhere in the world because those things are so big they would affect the foodsupply.IF IT DID HAPPEN IN YELLOWSTONE PARK AT THAT SIZE, WHAT WOULD THECONSEQUENCES BE?Catastrophic.CATASTROPHIC TO ANIMALS AND PEOPLE?Oh, yes.WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT? KATRINA-DEATH-NUMBERS OR GREATER?Far more because that super eruptions killed animals a thousand miles away.IN THE LAST 150 YEARS, THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST TWO OR THREEEXTREMELY LARGE VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS AND WHAT YOU JUST SAID, IF WE"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"HAD JUST ONE OF THOSE SIZES AT YELLOWSTONE, IT COULD KILL ANIMALSWITHIN A THOUSAND MILES AND THAT MEANS IT COULD KILL HUMANBEINGS WITHIN A THOUSAND MILES.Oh, yes, certainly. They have been events much smaller than the major Yellowstoneevents, but much larger than anything that could possibly come out of Mount Redoubt.BUT BACK TO YELLOWSTONE, WHAT KIND OF MEASURING DEVICES DO YOUHAVE THERE THAT IS SENDING INFORMATION TO USGS ALL THE TIME ANDHOW MUCH WARNING MIGHT THERE BE TO MOVE OUT A THOUSAND MILESOF POPULATION BEFORE SOMETHING BLEW?Well, that’s a good question. The largest eruption that we’ve had in more modern timeswhere there were monitoring instruments in place was Pinatubo, Philippines in 1991. Thatwas smaller than Katmai in Alaska, but probably ten times bigger than anything thatRedoubt could do.IF YELLOWSTONE WERE THE SIZE OF PINATUBO?We would probably see a few months run up of seismic activity to pretty good sizedearthquakes.ABOVE 4? OR 5?Maybe above Richter 6. I’m speculating here. The Katmai eruption in 1912, people werejust starting to use seismographs. And so, we actually know something about themagnitude of those earthquakes. There were about four that were a magnitude 6associated with the Katmai, Alaska, eruption. So, we would see that kind of thing inYellowstone.Now, a complication is that these giant systems, such as Yellowstone – Mount Redoubt isreally a pretty small volcanic system. But the gigantic ones like Yellowstone seem to beable to go through much stronger episodes of restlessness without doing any erupting. Theyare much more difficult to do any kind of forecasting. Yellowstone Park Caldera Has Risen3 Inches Per Year Since 2004BUT, AS I UNDERSTAND IT, THE UPWARD MOVEMENT OF THE YELLOWSTONECALDERA FLOOR HAS BEEN ALMOST THREE INCHES, WHICH IS SEVENCENTIMETERS, PER YEAR SINCE 2004.Yeah, that’s pretty amazing. Now, if Mount Redoubt were doing that, we would be very,very worried.WHY AREN’T WE WORRIED THEN THAT YELLOWSTONE COULD BE GETTINGREADY TO DO SOME MONUMENTAL BLOWING UP? THAT RISE OF THREEINCHES PER YEAR SINCE 2004 IS THREE TIMES GREATER THAN EVEROBSERVED SINCE SUCH MEASUREMENTS BEGAN IN 1923.Yeah, but Yellowstone has been doing something almost continuously since we have beenable to measure movements precisely and we know from experience all over the worldthat these kinds of systems go up and down all the time, but don’t erupt.SO, WHEN IT COMES TO YELLOWSTONE, IN SPITE OF THE BULGE WHICHPROBABLY IMPLIES THERE IS MAGMA RISING SOMEWHERE DOWN THERE,Ye s .WE KNOW THAT EVERYTHING ON THE SURFACE IS PRETTY HOT. ARE YOUSAYING THAT THE ONLY DEFINITIVE MEASUREMENT THAT USGS WOULDHAVE FOR WARNING WOULD BE SEISMIC ACTIVITY IN YELLOWSTONE AT 6.AND ABOVE ON THE RICHTER SCALE?We look at all kinds of data. By satellite, surface motion. Seismic activity. Gas output – ifwe saw a big increase in the release of sulfur dioxide – that’s an indication of magmamoving up towards the surface.WOULD SUCH AN INCREASED SULFUR DIOXIDE RELEASE NORMALLY BELINKED TO 6. AND ABOVE ON THE RICHTER SCALE SEISMIC EVENTS?Yes, but the bottom line is that at Yellowstone so far, we haven’t had a patient with that"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"kind of disease. (laughs) So, we’re just speculating here. Keep in mind that Yellowstonehas not had a volcanic eruption in about 70,000 years. And the kinds of events we shouldworry about as a society are things that happen once a century. We sometimes worryabout things that might happen once a millennium. We generally don't worry about thingsthat are less like to happen than that.[ Editor's Note: USGS source: “Three extremely large explosive eruptionshave occurred at Yellowstone in the past 2.1 million years with a recurrenceinterval of about 600,000 to 800,000 years. More frequent eruptions of basaltand rhyolite lava flows have occurred before and after the large caldera-forming events. For example, scientists have identified at least 27 differentrhyolite lava flows that erupted after the most recent caldera eruptions, about640,000 years ago, from vents inside the caldera. The most recent was about70,000 years ago. Many of these eruptions were separated in time by severaltens of thousands of years. Because the evidence of earlier eruptions mayhave been either buried or destroyed, we do not really know how often thevolcano has actually erupted.The most recent volcanic activity consisted of rhyolitic lava flows that eruptedapproximately 70,000 years ago. The largest of these flows formed thePitchstone Plateau in southwestern Yellowstone National Park.Since the most recent giant caldera-forming eruption, 640,000 years ago,approximately 80 relatively nonexplosive eruptions have occurred. Of theseeruptions, at least 27 were rhyolite lava flows in the caldera, 13 were rhyolitelava flows outside the caldera and 40 were basalt vents outside the caldera.Some of the eruptions were approximately the size of the devastating 1991Pinatubo eruption in the Philippines, and several were much larger. The mostrecent volcanic eruption at Yellowstone, a lava flow on the PitchstonePlateau, occurred 70,000 years ago.”]BUT THE ONCE-PER-CENTURY VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS CAN CERTAINLYINTERRUPT CURRENT DAY AIRLINE TRAVEL, LARGE POPULATIONS ANDBLOCK UP RIVERS SO THEY FLOOD.Oh, absolutely! Yes, a once-in-a-century eruption is definitely worth worrying about.AND MOUNT REDOUBT MIGHT BE IN THAT CATEGORY?More likely a once-in-a-decade event.EITHER WAY, IT’S GOING TO CAUSE PROBLEMS WHEN IT BLOWS?It will, yes. But because there will be rapid warning, because the airline industry is acutelyaware of this problem, it’s highly unlikely there will be any deaths or injuries from thisnext eruption. Alaska's Long Volcanic HistorySO, THAT PART OF THE UNITED STATES WAS ACTIVE AND ERUPTING MAGMAAND ASH AND GAS ONLY 2,000 AND 3,000 YEARS AGO.Oh, yeah! It’s not because activity has decreased. It’s just that geologically, those kinds ofvolcanic events are spaced out every few hundred to a thousand years.One of them had a big eruption last summer of 2008 – Okmok. It built a new mountaininside the giant crater. And that did interfere with trans-Pacific air travel.FOR HOW LONG?A short period of time.AGAIN, THE USGS IS RELYING MORE ON SEISMIC ACTIVITY TO GIVE THEALERT THAN JUST ABOUT ANY OTHER SYMPTOM?That’s the first line of defense, but we look at these things very carefully. We have aregular program schedule of satellite surveillance of all these volcanoes and on some of themost active such as Okmok, we have GPS instruments that can detect swelling of thevolcano.DO YOU THINK WITH THE RE-ACTIVATION OF MOUNT REDOUBT IN 2009 THAT"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"IT MIGHT PROVOKE MORE MONEY FROM CONGRESS TO AUTHORIZE MOREMONEY FOR GPS INSTRUMENTS ON THAT VOLCANO?Yes, it’s definitely part of the dialogue.IF YOU WERE BETTING ON WHETHER YOU WERE GOING TO GET YOURMONEY OR NOT, WHAT WOULD YOU SAY?(laughs) I am not a betting man. I am always a hopeful one, though.”2009 began with a volcanic eruption on January 3, at the Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii. Fivedays later on January 8, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake struck near the Poas volcano in CostaRica, destroying 423 houses, killing twenty-three people and injuring another hundred in amudslide. The earthquake set off fears that the Poas volcano was getting ready to eruptagain.In 2008, eighty-four volcanoes either erupted or were restless on our planet Earth. Two ofthe most explosive 2008 eruptions occurred at volcanoes that were not even monitored byUSGS – the Chaiten Volcano in Chile that had not erupted in more than 9,000 years andKasatochi in Alaska that had not erupted in more than a century.There is always the medical worry that people and animals will breathe in volcanic ash thatcan damage lungs. So, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia,has issued an alert to people living in the Anchorage and Cook Inlet region of Alaskawhere Mount Redoubt could blow any day now.CDC: “To avoid lung damage, get an N95 disposable respirator mask - also known as anair purifying respirator mask. N95 respirators can be purchased at hardware stores.Respirators range from disposable models that look similar to some face masks to thecartridge-type respirators that are generally referred to as gas masks.
