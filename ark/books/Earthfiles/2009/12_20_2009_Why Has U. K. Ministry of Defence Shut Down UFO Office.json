Ministry of Defence Shut Down UFO Office?© 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe“There are objects in our atmosphere which are technicallymiles in advance of anything that we can deploy, that we have no meansof stopping them coming here, and that we have no defense against them,should they be hostile.” - Lord and Admiral Peter John Hill-Norton,former U. K. Chief of Defense Staff and Chmn., NATO Military Comm.,2000 TV interview before his death in 2004 Click for podcast.December 20, 2009 London, England - The British Ministry of Defence (MoD) hasconfirmed that on December 1, 2009, it has suddenly and mysteriously shut down its UFOphone hotline and email address for public reports at the time of a UFO flap in the U.K.The MoD originally in November 2009 explained its surprising cutoffs this way:“The MOD has no opinion on the existence or otherwise of extra-terrestrial life.However, in over fifty years, no UFO report has revealed any evidence of a potentialthreat to the United Kingdom.The MOD has no specific capability for identifying the nature of such sightings. Thereis no Defence benefit in such investigation and it would be an inappropriate use ofdefence resources. Furthermore, responding to reported UFO sightings diverts MODresources from tasks that are relevant to Defence.Accordingly, and in order to make best use of Defence resources, we have decidedthat from the 1 December 2009 the dedicated UFO hotline answer-phone service ande-mail address will be withdrawn. MOD will no longer respond to reported UFOsightings or investigate them. The ongoing programme to release Departmental fileson UFO matters to the National Archive will continue. Any legitimate threat to the U.K.’s airspace will be spotted by our 24/7 radar checks and dealt with by RAF fighteraircraft.” [ The MoD said the elimination of the UFO office would save about$73,000 a year that would be better spent on Afghanistan troops whereBritain has about 9,500 soldiers.]This is a remarkable statement in light of the U. K.’s former Chief of Defense Staff, LordPeter John Hill-Norton who was concerned about the national security implications of theDecember 1980 unidentified lights and craft intrusions at RAF Bentwaters and RAFWoodbridge. Lord Hill-Norton told documentary filmmaker James Fox in July 2000:“I have frequently been asked why a person of my background ... thinks thereis a cover-up of the facts about UFOs. A number of explanations have oftenbeen put forward. The most frequent, and perhaps the most plausible, is thegovernment’s concern over the public’s reaction if told the truth — which isthat there are objects in our atmosphere which are technically miles inadvance of anything that we can deploy, that we have no means of stoppingthem coming here, and that we have no defense against them, should they behostile. I believe governments fear that if they did disclose those facts, peoplewould panic.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Lord Peter John Hill-Norton.February 8, 1915 - May 16, 2004.Video image © by James Fox.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Lord Peter John Hill-Norton (Feb. 8, 1915 toMay 16, 2004) was a five-star Admiral of the Fleet, was Chief of the DefenceStaff of the United Kingdom and Chairman of the NATO Military Committee.In later years he took an interest in UFOs, which included inquiries toParliament about the December 1980 RAF Bentwaters and RendleshamForest light, beams and craft encounters.]One former U. K. Ministry of Defence staffer who was hired right out of high school backin 1985 at age 20 is Nick Pope. His father also worked for the MoD and was instrumentalin Nick’s recruitment. During his 21 years inside the Ministry of Defence Secretariat AirStaff 2a, Nick was officially assigned in 1991 to 1994 to run the UFO project that includeda UFO phone hotline for public sightings reports. He retired from the MoD in 2006 andsince has worked as a freelance journalist to write about UFOs, other unexplainedmysteries, and conspiracy theories for various newspapers and magazines. Nick has alsodone public relations work for film companies such as 20th Century Fox and SonyPictures to promote TV series, including the X-Files program.Recently I talked with him by phone in his London home office and asked him why theMoD would suddenly suspend the very UFO project it has publicized in its ongoing releaseof UFO files?Interview:Nick Pope, born in 1965, joined the U. K. Ministry of Defencein 1985 at age 20, worked in the Secretariat Air Staff 2a and retiredin 2006. From 1991 to 1994, he managed the MoD's UFO Projectthat was officially closed on December 1, 2009. Image © by WordPress.com.Nick Pope, former Secretariat Air Staff 2a and head of UFO project, Ministry ofDefence, London, England: “Speaking as someone who worked for the MoD for 21years, they are not actually out of the game. This is the big story here, I think. Publiclythey say they aren’t investigating these sightings anymore. The MoD is not going torespond to queries from the public about UFOs. They are not going to investigate sightings,but I can absolutely guarantee that if a pilot sees a UFO and reports it, that will beinvestigated. If an air traffic controller sees something unusual on the radar, that will bereported.WHAT WOULD YOU SPECULATE MIGHT BE THE REASON FOR THE U. K. TODISENGAGE FROM THE PUBLIC NOW ON UFO REPORTS?I think what’s happened is that the powers that be have decided to cut out the public. It’stime to simply say, ‘Yeah, we’re not in this UFO game. We’re not interested in John Smithout walking his dog at night, seeing a bright light in the sky and phoning it in.’Actually what the MoD is interested in is pilots seeing these (UFO) things and air traffic"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"controllers seeing something on radar and reporting that up the chain of command. I goback to the point that this is a big story and people think the British government is out ofthe game. But you know what? They are not! Absolutely behind the scenes, the Britishgovernment is still looking at this issue.As to the timing, I don’t know. In most issues – whether it’s Iraq, Afghanistan or whatever– you will find that the British government slavishly follows the U. S. position. So maybethe answer is that we have been told to do this. But I don’t know. What Could Be Behind the MoDDismissal of the UFO Project?WHICH WOULD MAKE IT EVEN MORE IMPORTANT AND IMPLYING PERHAPSSOMETHING BIG IS AROUND THE CORNER AND THE LESS THE PUBLICKNOWS UP UNTIL SOME POINT, THE BETTER?Yes, I can’t disagree with that. As someone who served for 21 years in government, thissort of behavior is often indicative of some great policy initiative, some revelation, someannouncement, something. So, I would urge everyone to watch this space. Just when theytry to tell you that this is not an issue – you know, UFOs are not important and we areclosing the UFO project, move along because there is nothing to see – just when they tellyou to do that, it’s the very time that you should be paying the closest possible attention!The UFO Project never really appeared on the radar of our government financiers, but itdid recently. Obviously in terms of our having huge commitments in Afghanistan, it wasalways going to be a very easy target if we had a UFO project at the same time as you’vegot men and women putting their lives on the line in Afghanistan and people saying, ‘Isn’tthis time that you should cut the UFO project?’ That’s what people said and that’s what theMoD did. U.K. UFO Project Shut Down LikeAmerica's 1960s Project Blue BookIT IS A REPETITION OF THE 1960S AMERICAN PROJECT BLUE BOOK, WHICHWAS REALLY ONLY WINDOW DRESSING AND OUR GOVERNMENT DIDN’TWALK AWAY FROM UFOS AT ALL, WHICH YOU HAVE SUGGESTED IS EXACTLYTHE CASE IN THE U. K. NOW - TO CONCENTRATE ON THE UFO PHENOMENABEHIND THE SCENES.I don’t have any direct inside information about that. If I did, I probably could not say soanyway. But it’s quite possible, yes. There’s no smoke without fire. When you get thesesorts of situations, when you have these sorts of announcements, it does suggest that thereis something going on and I don’t know what it is. I honestly don’t, but there is somethinggoing on behind the scenes. Britain's Own Military Leader AdmiralHill-Norton Took UFOs Very SeriouslyIN THE CONTEXT OF MILITARY CHALLENGES AND THE POSSIBLE POLITICALEMBARRASSMENT OF A UFO DESK IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE AT THESAME TIME, ISN’T THAT CONTRADICTED BY THE FACT THAT LORDHILL-NORTON – YOUR VERSION OF THE AMERICAN CHAIRMAN OF THE JOINTCHIEFS OF STAFF – THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE 1990S, CORRECT?Yes, correct.THE VERY FACT THAT LORD HILL-NORTON TOOK THEUFO/EXTRATERRESTRIAL PHENOMENA SERIOUSLY IN HIS MILITARYCAPACITY WOULD CONTRADICT ANY EXPLANATION THAT THE MoD WOULDDROP THE UFO DESK BECAUSE IT WAS AN EMBARRASSMENT TO A MILITARYOPERATION.I agree with you totally. The Ministry of Defence’s public position that the UFOphenomena is of no defence significance is, I think, completely blown out of the water bythe testimony of people like Lord Hill-Norton. The MoD has for many years tried to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"downplay this subject out of embarrassment, out of the lack of knowledge andunderstanding and ‘How the heck do we play this issue?’Then along comes someone like Lord Hill-Norton – former Chief of the Defence staff;former Chair of NATO’s military committee. So, this is the equivalent of someone likeColin Powell in the U. S. coming out and saying, ‘I believe UFOs are extraterrestrial and Ibelieve that the government is covering up the truth about this.’That is dynamite – it’s absolute dynamite! And the fact that Lord Hill-Norton said that wasa story here in the U. K. and arguably it wasn’t the story it should have been all around theworld.YOU WERE WORKING IN THE MINISTRY OF DEFENCE UFO PROJECT AT THATTIME, CORRECT?That’s correct. Lord Hill-Norton phoned me up and asked me to brief him on this subject.Now, technically speaking, when somebody is a 5-star military officer, they never retire.They are always regarded as being on the active list. So, when Lord Hill-Norton phonedme up and asked me about UFOs, to me this was an order! I was working for thegovernment and at the time I was a comparatively junior managerial rank. Somebody at5-star level phones me up and asks me to do something, my response is, ‘Yes, sir!’WHAT IS IT THAT YOU COMMUNICATED TO LORD HILL-NORTON THATCONVINCED HIM THAT THIS WAS SERIOUS?Well, I’m not sure it was my advice that convinced him. I briefed him on various UFOinvestigations that I was involved with, but he was a 5-star military officer and Chairmanof NATO’s military committee. I mean, I can’t overstate the importance of LordHill-Norton’s rank in regard to this UFO issue.WHAT DO YOU THINK CONVINCED LORD HILL-NORTON THAT THE UFOPHENOMENA AND EXTRATERRESTRIALS WERE SERIOUS AND NEEDED TO BEINVESTIGATED?I don’t know. As a former Chief of the Defence staff and Chair of NATO’s militarycommittee, his security clearance was stratospherically higher than mine. So, it might wellbe that Lord Hill-Norton was privy to things that I simply was not briefed on. You’retaking me into very difficult territory here. There might well be things that he knew that Ijust was not briefed on.DID YOU EVER HAVE A PRIVATE OFF-THE-RECORD CONVERSATION WITH HIMABOUT WHAT HE WORRIED ABOUT?Yes, I certainly had a private off-the-record conversation with Lord Hill-Norton and hewas absolutely convinced that some UFOs were extraterrestrial. And he was alsoconvinced that some elements within the government and military and intelligenceagencies – that even he at his level, 5-star military, Chair of NATO’s military committee,Chief of the Defence staff – could not get access (to classified UFO files). He wasconvinced that some people knew things and were not sharing them.But even I could not get access to that. Sadly, he passed away a few years ago and thosesecrets – whatever he knew – he took to the grave. What Power Structure Could DenyLord Hill-Norton Access to UFO Information?SO WHAT POWER STRUCTURE WAS HE IMPLYING WOULD BE ABLE TO DENYHIM ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT UFOS AND EXTRATERRESTRIALBIOLOGICAL ENTITIES?He was saying that he, as a 5-star military officer, and as a man who literally could havepicked up the telephone and spoken to the Queen, the Prime Minister, the U. S. President,anyone! That was the level of access that Lord Hill-Norton had. But even he said thatthere was a level – I’ll have to choose my words carefully and I’ll get into trouble for thisprobably – but he said there were levels that he could not access even at his level of rankand seniority. He said there were places he could not go. There was information he couldnot access. There were people he could not go into see. You can use phrases like ‘secretgovernment,’ ‘cabal’ - I don’t know.DID YOU EVER ASK HIM STRAIGHT OUT IF HE WAS REFERRING TO THEMAJESTIC 12 GROUP SET UP BY TRUMAN IN THE 1940S AND IF THE UNITED"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"STATES WAS IN FACT IN CONTROL OF THE INTERACTION BETWEEN HUMANSAND NON-HUMANS?There is an old joke here in the U. K. and the joke goes like this. People ask the Secretaryof State or Defence, ‘Are there any circumstances when you wouldn’t go along with theAmerican policy on anything?’ And the answer comes back, ‘Only if they tell us not to.’(laughs)We in the U. K. are very much the junior partner here of the U. S. Basically, Britain doeswhat America tells Britain to do.THEN IS THE CANCELING OF THE UFO PHONE HOTLINE AND THEDISCONNECT FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM TO THE U. K. PUBLIC AS OFDECEMBER 1, 2009, AN ORDER FROM THE UNITED STATES TO THE U. K.?I don’t know that. I genuinely don’t know the answer to that, but one important thing tosay in relation to the way this story has been played in the media. It’s important, I think, tomake the point that this is not just the cutting off of a phone line. This is not just thetermination of an email address. However this has been spun and played in the media, thisis nothing less than the termination of the British government’s UFO project. This is 50years of research and investigation that we’ve done in this country terminated at the strokeof a pen!This is Britain formally disengaging from the UFO issue for whatever reason and I do notknow what that is. 2009 British UFO Reports At 10-Year-HighThe ultimate irony is that here in the U. K. UFO sightings are at a 10-year-high. Theremight be an element of what I call corporate irritation. The MoD has been looking at thisfor over 50 years. The MoD gets more Freedom of Information Act requests on UFOs thanalmost any other subject. So, actually there is a lot of work. Pulling out of the UFO Projectdoes, I guess, enable the MoD to disengage from a subject that has given it all manner ofdifficulties for the last 50 years.SO WHY CLOSE DOWN THE MoD UFO PROJECT NOW?I don’t know. You could say that UFO sightings are at a 10-year-high, so actually this is adifficult issue that the MoD wants to disengage from. The MoD is mid way through a3-year program of declassifying and releasing the entire archive of UFO files – literallytens of thousands of documents, some of which were classified at very high levels –SECRET U.K. EYES ONLY.So, just when UFOs are big news, the MoD takes a step back and says, ‘No, we can’t dealwith this. We don’t know how to respond to it. We don’t know what this is. These thingsare in our air space. Pilots see them; they are tracked on radar. We’ve seen them for 50years performing speeds and maneuvers that we can’t even conceive of let alone match.It’s a difficult problem and it doesn’t surprise me that they have walked away. Most Impressive 2009 U. K. UFO CaseWHAT 2009 CASE HAS IMPRESSED YOU THE MOST WITH THE MOSTSUBSTANCE?In early January 2009, we had a wind turbine about 300 feet tall designed to generateecologically friendly power. It was hit by something. Local people described lights in thesky. Then they heard a huge bang at about 4 AM. The following morning when theylooked at this thing, they found that one of the blades that was 65 feet in length had beenripped off. One of the other blades was bent out of shape and the third blade was intact."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"On right is one of the damaged wind turbine's 65-foot blades that came off and a second blade was crumpled.The site is two miles northeast of Louth, Lincolnshire, England.

The MoDand the Civil Aviation Authority need toinvestigate as a matter of urgency.People speculated that something had hit this wind turbine and what was very interesting –and this was a front-page news story in The Sun, Britain’s best selling daily newspaper.What was really interesting – and this has never been really explained – was thatsomebody at the MoD phoned up The Sun and tried to suggest that this was some secretprototype drone code named Taranis (Celtic god of thunder), manufactured by BritishAerospace Systems, Ltd., one of the U.

I WONDER WHAT YOU THINK ATTHE END OF DECEMBER 2009?To me as someone who worked for the Ministry of Defence for 21 years, the UFO issue issomething that is self-evidently of concern. It raises defence, national security and airsafety issues. I say the last point because of there have been numerous near-missesbetween UFOs and commercial aircraft some of which have involved pilots having to takeevasive action.This is not the UFO community saying this. This is the government saying this on itsvarious websites if you look hard enough. The best place to hide a book is in a library. Theinformation is out there, but it’s hidden among the more obscure stuff. But bottom line, Ido not know.I’m the guy that did this for the government and I’m going to be honest with you and sayhands up, I do not know what is going on. Honestly, I don’t. It might be hostile. It mightbe benign. But bottom line, I don’t know.DID LORD HILL-NORTON EVER SUGGEST TO YOU THAT HE HAD INSIDEINFORMATION ABOUT AGENDAS, POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE?Lord Hill-Norton was furious at what he felt was an attempt to cut him out, as a 5-starmilitary officer, of this UFO issue. They did not brief him on something that he, asBritain’s most senior military officer – had a right to know.He believed that UFOs were extraterrestrial. He believed that some people in governmentknew about it and were covering it up.

This is not in contrast with our faith because we can’t putlimits on God’s creative freedom. Why can’t we speak of a ‘brother extraterrestrial’?
