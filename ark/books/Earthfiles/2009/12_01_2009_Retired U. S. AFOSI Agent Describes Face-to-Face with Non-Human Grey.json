AFOSI Agent DescribesFace-to-Face with Non-Human “Grey”© 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe “At the moment of eye contact with that Grey,it was like seven different feature films started rapidlyrunning through my mind all at the same time with sound, temperature,touch and 3-dimensional gold symbols superimposed over the films.”- Retired U.S. AFOSI Agent December 1, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - In my 1984 research files about highstrangeness in the non-human phenomena, I typed the following notes after an interviewwith a man who had retired from the U. S. Air Force Office of Special Investigations(AFOSI). He implied that he actually received his check from an American intelligenceagency when he said, “The AFOSI is convenient cover for U. S. intelligence all over theworld.” He would talk to me only off the record and this is the first time I have put hisalleged experience in a public forum. Incident Date: 1978Location: ArizonaSource: Retired U. S. AFOSI Agent, John Smith“It started with a flood. There was a dam upstream from a small Arizona townthat was deliberately broken open by Blond aliens. I was with a unit thatinvestigated non-human activities - we could go anywhere, anytime. And mosteverything that happened was covered up pretty easily. I once worked anoperation in Idaho where a silver disc had crashed into a remote reservoir. Ourjob was to retrieve it without anyone knowing. So, we did a mild explosion to ahillside to create a ‘natural’ landslide across the only road into the area andposted warning signs.“My unit associated the lens-shaped discs and the domed discs that have threeballs underneath with the Blond types that are usually between 6 to 7 feet talland human enough to walk crowded city streets without detection. But whenyou are up close to those types, the irises of their eyes are bigger than humans -more like the diameter of a nickel instead of a dime. The ones I know aboutwere pale blue, almost like clear aquamarines. There were no black dots andlines like human eyes have. I know there are some Blonds that have gold eyes,like the Greeks. Have you ever seen the statue of Apollo in Athens? You can seethose gold eyes staring at you from a long way. Eerie! Greek civilization was E.T. hybridization, I guess, by the Blonds.“Then there are the Grey types, the ones I know as ‘extraterrestrial biologicalentities’ or EBENs, that mostly use white, egg-shaped craft supported on theground by ‘erector-set’ legs. My unit worked through NSA's Project Sigma tocommunicate with the Greys because we had learned some frequencies andmathematical communications that would usually connect to the Greys. At leastwe could send out signals to them to try to communicate. But with the Blonds,there was no communication, except if we tried going through the Greys. I was"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"told a long time ago those two types had a long war against each other, but nowI understand even though they don't get along, they fight now mostly with theirminds and cloning and the Greys will intervene sometimes on our behalf withthe Blonds.“That's what happened that night in Arizona. We sent out a signal to the Greysto ask why the dam was broken and flooded the town. The next thing I knew,I'm getting an order to chopper to a site a few miles from that town. When I getthere, I have orders to report to our boss. He tells me that a Grey craft haslanded not far away.“He said, ‘It's time you understand what a telepathic download is like from oneof these Greys. One has agreed to do a demonstration. I'm going to take you tosome tents where the Grey is waiting in one for our signal. You'll be severalmeters away at the beginning and some of us will be off to the side, so you don'tneed to worry. It's safe, but you might faint. That's why I'm telling you this now.When you see the Grey, it has agreed to keep its feet on the ground. They preferto float, but they know that scares the hell out of humans. It will walk on theground and that will look like Donald Duck. This Grey is only about four feethigh to your six feet, so you'll be looking down on it.‘But remember what I'm telling you now - when that Grey gets a few feet fromyou, your whole body is going to want to run away. You'll feel the same fear asyou would if someone had a flame thrower aimed at you. Every cell in yourbody is going to be screaming to run, but you can't. You've got to stand there.You'll probably feel like fainting, too, but don't! If you do, we'll catch you, but Idon't want you to faint or vomit or run away. Is that clear?!‘The next thing that happens is the Grey will start raising its eyes to look at youreyes. That's when you'll lose all control of yourself and your mind and you justneed to let it happen so you'll know why humans are never going to be sittingdown for coffee to talk about the universe with these guys.’John Smith told me at that point he felt cocky and unafraid and thought his bosswas being melodramatic. “I can handle it, don't worry!”Artist's illustration of a Grey being.Then he saw the tent flap open and a small, grey-colored being waddled out,“just like Donald Duck in the cartoons, I'm not kidding! And it kept comingstraight for me with its eyes down. About six feet from me, my knees began toshake. Then my whole body started to shake and I thought I would faint. Iwanted out of there! I did want to run! The only thing that kept me standing inthat spot was my thinking about my boss, hearing his voice in my head andsaying to myself, ‘Fuck it! I'm not going to fall apart while my boss iswatching.’”What happened next completely overwhelmed John Smith. He told me thatwhile he was trying to force his body to stop shaking, he saw the Grey headbegin slowly tilting upward and could see the large, black, shiny eyes withnarrow points near the center of the Grey's flat face that ballooned out as theeyes slanted up and outward.“Linda, at the moment of eye contact with that Grey, it was like seven differentfeature films started rapidly running through my mind all at the same time withsound, temperature, touch and 3-dimensional gold symbols superimposed overthe films. I knew my mind was trying to ask questions, but that seemed to createall the branching pieces of film in my mind - like visual answers to whatever mybrain was thinking. But while those films seemed to have something to do withwhere the Greys came from and why they are here, I also felt like my entiremind was being transferred into the Grey's mind. If God himself asked me whatwas communicated by that Grey, I don't have a clue! And when it was over and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the Grey lowered its eyes, I did start to faint. My boss and his men caught me. Iguess I passed out because I don't remember anything more until I woke up ona cot in one of the tents.“And that's why humans aren't going to be sitting down with Greys over coffeeto learn about the universe. After all that, and with the Greys trying to help uscommunicate with the Blonds, we never did learn why the Blonds broke thedam. But I'll tell you one thing I do know - the Blonds don't do anything withouta specific reason.”An adult female's March 1982 abduction near Springfield, Missouri,involved 6-foot-tall, blond-haired male humanoids.
