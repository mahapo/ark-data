"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"September 30, 2009 Stamford, Connecticut - Kersten S. from Norwalk, Connecticut,was working as a driver for a limousine company between 1 and 2 PM on Wednesday,September 30, 2009, in Stamford, Connecticut, northeast of New York City. He parked tocomplete paper work in the town car he was driving. His car faced east toward LongIsland Sound.Kersten told me today that he looked up from his work through the tinted front windowand there in the cloudy sky were three discs in a triangle formation completely stationary.“I was so shocked that I sat there for a few moments just staring. Then I grabbed myiPhone, clicked once and got those three discs not moving. I was trying to change to atighter focus, took my eyes off the discs for only a moment, but when I aimed the cameraback at the sky, the discs were gone. The whole thing was maybe thirty seconds, but Inever saw those things move once. What are they?“It's eerie because ten years ago when I was also in Stamford walking at night, I heard alow volume humming sound and there were three discs in the sky moving very slowly, sortof like the triangle formation today. But that night, the shapes were round, not flat discs. Idon't know if they were three circles on one large craft or three separate, round aerialcraft. Nothing glowed with light. I could barely see them as lighter shapes in the night sky,almost like they were being stealthy and did not want to be seen. I didn't have anything tophotograph with and was so shocked I just stared until the three circles moved anddisappeared behind some buildings.” Apple iPhone Image Through Tinted Town Car WindowSeptember 30, 2009, between 1 - 2 PM EasternStamford, Connecticut, facing east toward Long Island Sound© 2009 by Kersten S.
