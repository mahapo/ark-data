July 30, 2009 Yatesbury, Wiltshire, England - I arrived at Heathrow Airport in Londonaround NOON on Friday, July 24th, and it was raining. On the drive out the M4 toWiltshire, it was still raining. It was so muddy at the Kennet Canal where good friends ofmine, Gill and Robert Nicholas, invited me to spend a couple of days with them on theirhouseboat, that Gill had to loan me knee-high rain boots.Swans on Saturday morning, July 26, 2009, coming for food at the Kennet Canal houseboatwhere I stayed for a couple of days in Wiltshire, England, with my good friends and long-timecrop formation explorers, Gill and Rob Nicholas.

But Gill and I had no computer tosee the Cropcircleconnector.com aerials such as those below by Frank Laumen ofVisibleSigns.de and professional aerial photographer and crop formation researcher, LucyPringle. In fact, after we found other confused people trying to find the new Ogbourne cropformation without success, we finally encountered some Norwegians who parked andyelled, “Follow us!” And we took off along a ridgeway - for two miles - before we evencame to a place where we could see the amazing pattern down below us, but still very faraway."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"12-arms “beaded” with Mayan glyphs reported Friday, July 24, 2009,in the Gallops between Ogbourne St. George and Barbury Castle, Wiltshire County,England.

Then we had to go down a steep sheep pasture hillside to get to the edge of the wheat field.There we found a zigzagging path right through the wheat, which most crop formationenthusiasts will never do to avoid damaging the crop. Instead, crop formation etiquette isalways to find tractor tramlines that can be walked to the formation. Later we learned thatthe farm owner was enraged on Friday and had chased early people in the formation away.So, perhaps he made the zigzag path through his own wheat?When we walked another several hundred feet, we finally got to the edge of the hugepattern. One of the first features that struck Gill and me as unusual was one of the largercircles around the center core was “woven” or “faceted” as if to project a 3-dimensionalimage from the air, as some formations that appear disheveled on the ground turn out tocreate 3-dimensions in aerial images. But when we finally saw aerials atCropcircleconnector.com, curiously, we cannot detect the faceted circle that was soprominently different from the other eleven on the ground inside the formation.Criss-crossed, disheveled “facets” of wheat inside only one of twelve larger circles around thecentral core of the Ogbourne St. George formation. Often these seemingly chaotic lays create3-dimensional impressions from the air.

One circle had a “bouquet” of wheatheads arranged artistically in the center of a small circle.Other striking features were the different weaves in each of the 48 small circles throughout theformation.

Image © 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.I walked the formation’s main corridor that runs north-south from a lower altitude to higheraltitude and found the place where the north-south axis crossed the farmer’s tractortramlines. That means that the creators of the 12-arm pattern did not utilize the existingtramlines, but oriented the whole pattern on its own axis.On left is the farmer’s tractor tramline; on the right is the end of the main north-south axis in the12-arm geometry, rotated away from the tramline.
