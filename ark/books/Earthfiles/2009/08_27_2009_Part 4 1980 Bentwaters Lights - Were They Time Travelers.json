They are us.... and they are using us like Band-Aids.” - USAF Staff Sergeant James W. Penniston (Ret.),Dec. 1980 RAF Bentwaters, from 1994 hypnosis sessionFormer U. S. Air Force 1st Class Airman John Burroughs is now organizing a2010 reunion in England for all the military personnel in RAF BentwatersRAF and Woodbridge who were involved in the mysterious light phenomenaof December 26 - 28, 1980. John would like to hear from all who were thereand has created a website and email account to organize a 2010 Bentwatersreunion.Website with email address: http://backtobentwaters.blogspot.com/John Burroughs, age 49, after October 4, 2008,hypnosis session with Melinda Vail, CHTT, in Tempe, Arizona.Image © 2008 by Linda Moulton Howe. Return to Part 1August 27, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - It's now nearly thirty years later and JohnBurroughs is still haunted by what happened in Rendlesham Forest December 26 toDecember 28, 1980. He is especially troubled by the fact that he cannot consciouslyremember what happened when he was close to the lights both nights. He knows what Sgt.Penniston and Col. Halt have written and said. He’s talked with Adrian Bustinza. Johnknows all the rumors about his jumping on a craft or being taken up in a beam of light andmissing time. He still has strange dreams, can’t sleep, and feels like something in his mindwants to come out. Several months ago, John Burroughs contacted me about his anxietiesand said he wondered if I could find a qualified hypnotherapist who could try to penetratethe block on his memory.Since John lives in Phoenix, I researched the clinical hypnotherapist community there andwas referred to Melinda Vail, who specializes in child to young adult post traumaticsyndromes. John Burroughs was twenty years old in December 1980 and it’s his youngmind then that has been blocked the past 28 years. I shared with Melinda Vail some of the1988 hypnosis concerning the interactions with the lights and she agreed to help us. On"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Saturday, October 4, 2008, I joined John Burroughs at Melinda Vail’s Tempe office tovideotape the hypnosis session. John, Melinda and I hoped that John could break throughto full memory. Here are highlights of what happened. Oct. 4, 2008 John Burroughs HypnosisTempe, ArizonaVideotape Excerpt 1:“We, three of us went.WHO WENT?Jim, I and a guy called Cabansag. [ Staff Sergeant James W. Penniston wasduty supervisor at RAF Woodbridge and drove to the East Gate in a truckwith newly assigned Airman 1st Class Edward Cabansag (pronouncedCuh-VAN-sack)]WHO WAS DRIVING THIS TIME?Jim.WHERE WERE YOU? FRONT OR BACK?It was a three-pack, so I was by the door and the other guy (Cabansag) was inthe middle.OK, WHEN YOU GOT TO THE END OF THE ROAD, DID YOU GETOUT?Well, we turned, went to another road and went to the forest (Rendlesham). Oooooooh!ARE YOU IN THE FOREST NOW?Ooooh, I think sooooo.WHAT’S IN THE FOREST?It’s dark.ARE THERE ANY LIGHTS?They are there, I think, in the distance.LET’S SEE WHAT HAPPENS.(John’s whole body jerks) Oh, no! That light said ‘No!’I KNOW, BUT WE CAN SEE ANYWAY. THE LIGHT IS NOT INCHARGE. WE’RE IN CHARGE.Yeah, right. (sarcastic)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WE ARE IN CHARGE AND SEE, YOU CAN FEEL MY HAND. I’VE GOTYOU. YOU ARE SAFE.It’s not about being safe.WHAT’S IT ABOUT?I don’t know, but I don’t feel scared. But every time you want me to go there,that light says, ‘No!’”Video Excerpt 2:“We all of a sudden come upon a bright, white light.DO YOU TALK TO EACH OTHER?Yeah, we’re scared. I mean, we’re – I don’t know, not scared, but shocked orcaught off guard.WHAT DO YOU SAY TO EACH OTHER?We just dive and hit the ground.YOU HIT THE GROUND?Yeah, all three of us.WHEN YOU HIT THE GROUND, YOU ARE ON YOUR BELLY AND YOULOOKED UP AND STILL SAW THE LIGHT?It was so bright.DID YOU COVER YOUR FACE OR DID YOU LOOK UP?I think I looked up. (body jerks) Ooooooh!WHAT IS IT?I’m in something.WHAT ARE YOU IN?I don’t know. My mind is in something.TELL ME WHAT IT IS.I don’t know. It fooled my mind into ....ARE YOU INSIDE THE LIGHT?It’s all around me now.DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU ARE INSIDE THELIGHT?No, nothing. Nothing right now. It’s just around me now.

WE CANGO IN.Oh, no we can’t!WHY CAN’T WE?I don’t know. When you say, ‘Go,’ it fades away. Now, it’s changing.WHAT IS IT CHANGING TO?It’s three, three, three major lights!ARE THEY WHITE?They are getting more and more blue.”Video Segment 4:“AND YOU ARE OUTSIDE, AREN’T YOU?Whoaa! (shakes)IT’S ALL RIGHT, WHAT IS IT?There’s like twenty of them!TELL ME ABOUT THEM?They were just there. (John Burroughs is shaking all over his body)I’VE GOT YOU.

It’s gone.WILL YOU EVER BE ABLE TO KNOW?I think.WILL YOU BE ABLE TO KNOW TODAY?I don’t know. Something is just not being right. Nothing being right. There’s areason why.”Video Segment 8, John Awake:“And this time I could see stuff that I’ve never seen before. It seemed tocome out of me before (verbalization in 1988 hypnosis), but this time I wasseeing it.GOOD, YOU WERE FEELING THE EXPERIENCE. WELL, YOURWHOLE BODY WAS VIBRATING FROM HEAD TO TOE.But, there was something that at one point – I don’t remember what you weretrying to get me to do, but it was like something just spun and really openedup and it was like it was trying to pull me through it."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"OK, I THINK WE HAVE AN IDEA WHAT THAT MIGHT BE (OPENINGIN CRAFT?) AND WE’LL WORK WITH THAT AGAIN.It was like they (small blue lights?) were there and it seems like whenever youwere trying to get me to do something, it would get whatever, and then therewere some lights and then some other things. But then at one point, it was allof a sudden – just like a (spins his index finger around in the air) – I’ve neverseen anything like it – it was a dark black abyss almost.I remember you asking me if I wanted it (memory) to come out and I did feellike it needs to come out. Not that I want it to come out, not that I’m scared ofit coming out, but it needs to come out – but not that I’m trying to make itcome out. I don’t know.I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SAYING.It needs to come out. It’s there to come out, but it just has to come out theright way.” Melinda Vail and I discussed the black hole and its possible significance as a mechanicalopening in some kind of craft technology that might be the key to John’s strong mentalblock about how he became surrounded by light or even possibly lifted in a light beam asrumored by some military personnel involved December 26th. So, we all agreed to meetback in Melinda Vail’s Office on October 25th. But on October 22nd, I received this emailfrom John Burroughs:“Linda, I’m sorry to have to send this e-mail, but I will be unable to do the hypnosissession this weekend. I hurt my back and I need to stay in bed at least through theweekend. If it does not get any better by next week, I will have to get an MRI and maybesurgery. I hurt it really bad about 3 years ago and did not stay off of it and I ended upbeing out of work for over 5 weeks and was told if it happened again, I would need to havesurgery. I have two bad discs in my lower back.” No other hypnosis has been done to date. So, John’s goal to fully remember whathappened to him is still in process. But I can add one more piece to the BentwatersRendlesham Forest puzzle. Sgt. Jim Penniston's 1994 Hypnosis:“They are time travelers.”Col. Charles I. Halt (Ret.) on left with Sgt. James Penniston (Ret.) in 2007.In 1997, Jim Penniston gave me permission to share some of his December 26, 1980, Rendlesham Forest experiences in my third book, Glimpses of Other Realities: Vol. II -High Strangeness. After his and John Burroughs’ encounter with the lights and craft, Sgt.Penniston told me he received a call to report on December 30, 1980, to the Orderly Room"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"at the head of the 81st Security Police Squadron at RAF Bentwaters. From there, MajorMalcolm Zickler ordered Penniston to report to the Air Force Office of SpecialInvestigations (AFOSI) for a meeting to tell his story to an AFOSI Special Agent and a USAir Force Major.Back in 1997, Penniston told me that he deliberately left out the most significant partabout reaching out to touch the symbols on the glowing, triangle-shaped craft andreceiving information in his mind. Apparently the intelligence agents knew Sgt. Pennistonwasn’t telling the full truth and gave him a release to sign so he could be given sodiumpentothal. Sodium pentothal is a barbituate that induces unconsciousness smoothly andrapidly and has been called “truth serum” when used with hypnosis.After the Bentwaters sodium pentothal hypnosis session was over, no one told Pennistonwhat he had said. Finally fourteen years after the Bentwaters events, on September 10,1994, Jim Penniston underwent hypnosis on his own with a hypnotherapist to see if hecould penetrate more details about haunting dreams he was having and his worry that themilitary’s sodium pentothal hypnosis might have been done to purposefully erase part ofhis memory.I was given an audiocassette of that 1994 session to transcribe. The transcription isincluded in my 1998 book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness. [ See:Earthfiles Shop.] Jim Penniston’s Bentwaters interrogators asked about the glowing lightsand craft he had earlier refused to describe.September 10, 1994Sgt. Penniston Hypnosis ExcerptsPenniston explained he received information after touching the craft’s symbols thatchromosomes were gathered for different reasons, particularly to help the time travelersbecause they have a “physical problem” and Penniston felt sympathy for them. Pennistonsaid the time travelers have Quote: “been coming here for a long time, at least thirty orforty thousand years, trying to sustain their children in the far distant future of Earth."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Two weeks after Sgt. Jim Penniston’s December 26, 1980, experience, USAF Lt. Col.Charles Halt, who was RAF Bentwaters Deputy Base Commander, wrote a report datedJanuary 13, 1981, on official Department of Air Force Headquarters letterhead to theRoyal Air Force. The subject is “Unexplained Lights.” His dates are scrambled, comparedto the testimonies of John Burroughs and Sgt. Jim Penniston, who agree the first night ofevents was December 26, 1980, while their second encounter was with Lt. Col. Halt in theearly morning hours of December 28, 1980.In his letter, Lt. Col. Halt described the object encountered by John Burroughs and JimPenniston in Rendlesham Forest as, “metallic in appearance and triangular in shape,approximately two to three meters across the base and approximately two meters high. Itilluminated the entire forest with a white light. The object itself had a pulsing red light ontop and a bank of blue lights underneath. The object was hovering on legs. As thepatrolmen approached the object, it maneuvered through the trees and disappeared. At thistime, the animals on a nearby farm went into a frenzy. ...The next day, three depressions1 1/7 inches deep and 7 inches in diameter were found where the object had been sightedon the ground.”“Later in the night ... an object to the south was visible for two or three hours and beameddown a stream of light from time to time. Numerous individuals, including the undersigned,witnessed the activities in paragraphs 2 and 3.”"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"The original and controversial Lt. Col. Charles I. Halt Memorandum written on January 13, 1981,to the Royal Air Force/CC about “Unexplained Lights” investigated beyond the East Gate of RAF Woodbridgethe first night of the phenomenon. Col. Halt now concedes that the first sentence date of“27 Dec 80” is incorrect and joins the consensus of others who were there that the firstlights were investigated by Airman 1st Class John Burroughs, Staff Sergeant Jim Pennistonand Airman 1st Class Edward Cabansag after midnight on December 26, 1980.Col. Halt also confirmed beta/gamma radiation readings were recorded with “peakreadings in the three depressions and near the center of the triangle formed by thedepressions. A nearby tree had moderate beta/gamma readings on the side of the treetoward the depressions.” Col. Halt also described another event in which a red, pulsing light “threw off glowingparticles and then broke into five separate white objects and then disappeared.” The timeand date of this event cannot be confirmed by John Burroughs or Jim Penniston. Butanother military eyewitness, Larry Warren, says he saw such an explosion of light whilemany security people, light-alls, and photographic equipment were present.John Burroughs also described during his October 4, 2008, hypnosis with Melinda Vail,that “something in the blue, milky light ... exploded.” U. K. Ministry of Defence LetterThen an alleged British Ministry of Defence letter in which the date, addressee and writerwere blacked out even referenced “entities” that were small, “approximately 1 ½ metrestall – which is 5 feet tall – and wore what appeared to be nylon-coated pressure suits, butno helmets. Conditions on the night were misty, giving the appearance that the entitieswere hovering above ground level.“Tape recordings were made on which the entities are heard to speak in an electronicallysynthesized version of English, with a strong American accent. Similar transmissionsintercepted irregularly by NSA since 1975."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"“According to OSI (Air Force Office of Special Investigations), entities had claw-likehands with three digits and an opposable thumb.” Date, addressee and signature of sender blacked out on alleged U. K. Ministryof Defence memorandum that describes non-human entities in “the landing of a craftof unknown origin crewed by several entities near RAF Bentwaters on the night of December 29to 30, 1980.” If that date is correct, then is it a fourth night of phenomena - or another incorrect date?If such entities are “time travelers” – and are us from Earth’s future -- why claw-likehands that have only four fingers? What happened in the evolution of Homo sapiens?When Sergeant Penniston placed his hand on the craft’s engraved symbols, he thinks heactivated technology that sent light containing binary code communication into his mind –from time travelers and their time machine craft.Time travel is a serious subject in modern physics. Mathematical theory says that if matterapproaches the speed of light, time appears to slow down to an external observer. If youwere the light speed matter, you would notice no difference in time. The closer you got to"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"the speed of light, the slower time would go. If you reached the speed of light, time wouldstop. Then if you could exceed the speed of light, time would reverse – but only to theoutside observer. You, the traveler going faster than light, would have no reference pointfor time change until you returned to your physical starting point and slowed back down tonormal speeds. Then you would have lived the famous limerick:There once was a lady named BrightWho traveled much faster than light.She departed one day in a relative wayAnd came home the previous night. There is a paradox in Penniston’s recall of the telepathic transmission from the glowingcraft. The implication is that the time travelers are human descendants from a place 40,000years in the future where humanity is dying out. Time Machine craft are sent back throughtime to harvest genetic material from our present Earth life in order to help a futurecivilization survive. The explanation given for traveling thousands of years into the pastwas to avoid affecting the time travelers’ future time line in some dangerous,uncontrollable way. But moving backwards in time to a distant past to survive is changingtheir future.Perhaps the paradox is a translation problem in which we humans lack the language andunderstanding of a different cosmology than we have discovered so far. Fans of Star Trekand Star Wars and other science fiction are accustomed to plots that include allies orenemies that use time travel for transportation, to fight wars, to change destinies and toeven gain immortality.Whether the glowing triangular craft and its symbols in Rendlesham Forest belonged totime travelers, or extraterrestrial biological entities from inside this universe, or non-humanentities from parallel universes or other dimensions, why is the truth suppressed? Whycan’t governments tell their citizens that humans are not alone in the universe? What factsabout other intelligences interacting with Earth do government insiders know and considerso dangerous that they hide those facts for decades under a policy of denial in the interestof national security? If national security is built on lies and deceptions, it is no one’ssecurity. It is social imprisonment by illusion.Those distorting reality are using lies to control the public and media while perpetuatingtheir power. However, the 1980 high strangeness in Rendlesham Forest has never rested easily in the minds of those who were actually there. Perhaps like human time releasecapsules, John Burroughs, Jim Penniston, Col. Halt and others have embedded within thempieces of truth about an incomprehensible future? Or pieces of lies that keep humanscorralled by illusions? Either way, whatever penetrated the Rendlesham Forest inDecember 1980, is still reverberating nearly thirty years later in 2008 with so much powerthat John Burroughs cannot forget the haunting, seemingly telepathic lights and thequestion: what IS their source?What if the key to the Rendlesham Forest mystery is a tangle of past, present and futuretime lines – a knot? If the knot is untied by advanced technologies, what happens to past,present and future?Are we unconsciously in the ultimate paradox? We are They; They are Us. Life on Earth isnot guaranteed, but the mysterious telepathic lights and their makers are using us tosurvive? And does our ignorance of Them and the Time Line Knot allow the manipulationof us by Time Travelers?If we humans became conscious of the time manipulation efforts, would our consciousnesschange the future ... to survival? Or to extinction? Does the UFO phenomenon keep usdumb and blind to prevent our interference in their efforts to unravel past, present andfuture? Continued in Part 5 - Col.
