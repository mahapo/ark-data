It teeteredas it righted itself and floated upward to hide in the cloud cover.”Email Report:Subject: V shaped craft 1997, Jacksonville, FloridaDate: January 16, 2009 4:25:03 PM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“I and a neighbor witnessed a massive V-shaped craft in broad daylight someyears ago (circa 1997) in Jacksonville, FL - it was identical to the craft onyour site now.One overcast evening, around 5pm, I was watching beautiful lightning streakfrom one side of the sky to the other - it was just prior to a hurricaneapproaching up and just off the coast. One lightning bolt just suddenlystopped. I thought it was strange because all the others were sweeping greatdistances across the sky.Suddenly, a straight line began to materialize where the bolt had ended. Itfilled in until a huge V was visible. Obviously, this lightning had hit thisV-shaped craft and did something to the craft's invisibility device. It teeteredas it righted itself and floated upward to hide in the cloud cover.Each leg of the V was the size of a runway - the size blew me away! Theconstruction was similar to modern buildings - huge panes of reflective panels- and all right angles - nothing round at all - a gigantic V-shaped craft. Nosound. No visible propulsion. The exterior was comprised of two rows ofpanels per side and the size was so huge it made me dizzy as my mind foughtto comprehend what my eyes were seeing."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I yelled for my neighbor and he ran over to see what was going on. I pointedat the object and he uttered ‘Whoa!’ as his jaw dropped. We stood there insilence - totally blown away. Those 30 seconds or so were an eternity.Strangely, just inside my front door was a table with several cameras on it, butI was so startled I didn't even think of it!After being ridiculed by some close friends we told this to - the sighting wasnever mentioned again. Oh, yes - it was for real! Personally, I hope it is a USAsecret craft. However, due to the extreme size - and the hair standing up onthe back of my neck - I think not.”Updated Original Earthfiles Report, January 8, 2009 Merritt Island, Florida - Tw odecades ago on the warm summer evening of August 16, 1987, eighteen-year-old Robert“Bobby” Howe [no relation to this reporter] and two of his friends had driven from theirMerritt Island, Florida, home out to the Cherie Down Park beach near Cape Canaveral,home of the space shuttle launches. Some time between 9 PM and 10 PM, the brother,sister and Bobby noticed what looked like two bright car lights at the shoreline underneaththe water. Their first thought was deep sea divers. The lights were there for about ahalf-hour and then were gone. But up in the sky, Bobby and his friends saw a giantV-shaped aircraft above them. Bobby estimates the length of the craft was longer than afootball field, which is longer than 300 feet.Then the huge aircraft moved into a cloud. The teenagers waited for at least an hour, butthe V-shaped craft did not come out of the cloud. So, the three friends decided to driveback to Merritt Island where they lived, which is over the Banana River by a bridge fromCape Canaveral. As Bobby and his friends drove toward the bridge, they suddenly sawfour stars in a straight line on the horizon. At the bridge, the lights moved over their carand the three realized it was the V-shaped aircraft again.As their car moved over the bridge onto Merritt Island, the three realized that theV-shaped craft seemed to be pacing them, or leading them, and they followed the aircraftin the sky through the island as far as they could go to the other side where the road theywere on stopped on Plumosa Street at the Indian River west of Cape Canaveral. At thatstop sign, the V-craft turned 180 degrees around from traveling west and pointed eastfacing Bobby and his friends in the car for nearly a half-hour.Then the V-shaped aircraft turned toward the south and passed the Merritt Square Mall atthe Banana River headed in the direction of Patrick Air Force Base between Cocoa Beachand Satellite Beach. The time by then was 1 AM Eastern. At least three hours had elapsedfrom the first sighting of the underwater lights that the three teenagers associated with theappearance of the V-shaped craft, their waiting for the craft to emerge from a cloud, thenthe craft following them through Merritt Island and finally moving off towards PatrickAFB - all with no sound.The upper far right pink circle 1 marks Cherie Down Park near Cape Canaveral, Florida,where Robert Howe and his two friends first saw between 9 PM and 10 PM on August 16, 1987,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"two bright lights underwater.

Map overlay by Robert Howe.By December 2008, Robert had seen my Earthfiles reports and heard my DreamlandOnline and Coast to Coast AM radio reports since October 2008 about the mysterious,large, triangle-shaped craft over Empire and Midvale, Ohio, [ See: 103108 Earthfiles and121208 Earthfiles ] On December 19, 2008, Robert Howe sent me an email that began,“In 1987, I witnessed a giant V craft over Cape Canaveral, Florida. This thing interactedwith me and 2 others for over 3 hours. I rarely see anything out there on the web of thiscraft.”When I called him to talk about the sighting, he said when the large, curved bow of lightswas videotaped and photographed over Phoenix, Arizona, on March 13, 1997, hewondered if that was the same type of craft he and his friends had seen ten years earlier inFlorida. However, based on the half dozen interviews I did with eyewitnesses of theArizona phenomena, their was a consistent description in the early evening of a triangle-shaped craft estimated to be two miles long moving slowly over Phoenix before the arcs oflights showed up about three hours later. When compared to Bobby Howe's sketch of theV-shaped aerial craft he and his friends saw August 16, 1987, the Arizona aerial objectsseem different from the Florida aircraft.Sketches of Florida August 16, 1987, V-shaped aircraft frombottom and side view © 2008 by Robert Howe.Arc of Phoenix lights videotaped by KPNX-TV,NBC-Channel 12, around 10 PM Pacific, on March 13, 1997.Earlier in the evening between 7 PM and 8 PM, several eyewitnessesreported a triangle-shaped craft about two miles long.Video image © 1997 by KPNX-TV.On January 2, 2009, I interviewed Robert Howe by phone about computer graphic imageshe emailed me of the large V-shaped aircraft with an odd V-shaped pattern of smallerV-shaped lights on the bottom. During the recorded interview, he said the three of themthought they could see through the aircraft because each saw stars where the solid bodyshould be. But adding to their confusion, at moments in the three hour event, each could"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"also see solidity of the V-shaped craft itself.After I produced the Emmy Award-winning television documentary, A Strange Harvest,[See Earthfiles Shop] that was first broadcast on May 28, 1980, I received a report fromDenver, Colorado, residents who said a large triangle aircraft appeared above their homenear then-Stapleton Airport which seemed almost solidly the color of the blue sky, butthere was enough solidity of the aircraft that the family could see the blue triangle shapeagainst the blue sky. That Colorado family asked me the same questions that puzzle meand Bobby Howe: Are the eyewitnesses seeing through the aircraft? Or is the aircraftcamouflaged by the sky, blue at day or star-filled at night?Further, how could the large summer population of people between Cape Canaveral andMerritt Island on a warm evening in August 1987, have not seen the huge V-craft with itsodd pattern of lights that Bobby Howe compared to the warning amber in traffic lights?Large V-shaped aircraft, longer than a football field and an estimated two storieshigh, disappearing into a cloud above Cherie Down Park near Cape Canaveral, Florida,where Robert Howe and his two friends first saw the aircraft between9 PM and 10 PM Eastern on August 16, 1987. Computer illustration © 2009 by Paul Kirsch.Interview:Robert “Bobby” Howe, Animal Kennel Owner, Melbourne, Florida, now39-years-old, reporting the V-aircraft encounter when he was eighteen on August 16,1987: “The lights seem to have been like an amber color. If you were looking at it in thedistance, it would look like stars. The V-shaped craft looked almost like black granite. Andyou could almost see through it, like transparent, but you could tell it was a solid structure.WHEN YOU SAY GRANITE, I THINK OF SOMETHING VERY SOLID AND DENSE,AND YET YOUR NEXT SENTENCE WAS THAT IT WAS TRANSPARENT?Right. You could see through it, but you could see it was actually a structure. You couldsee the stars behind it, but you could tell it was a solid structure. If we hadn’t seen it, wewould never have known it was there – unless you looked up, you would never have heardanything. . It was as black as the night sky behind it.SO, WHY DO YOU USE THE PHRASE, ‘IT LOOKED LIKE GRANITE’?Because that’s what it reminded me of, like cement, like a stone. It wasn’t completelysmooth. There were like ridges a little bit on it.OK, SOME PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT IF YOU BROKE OPEN A PIECE OFCOAL AND YOU LOOKED AT THE STRIATIONS IN THE COAL, THAT IT WOULDBE LIKE THE CRAFT SURFACE.Yes, that would be close to it.

Maybe like a yellow traffic warning signal – similar to that, but moreorangish.DID THE V-SHAPED LIGHTS ON THE BOTTOM OF THE HUGE V-SHAPED CRAFTFLICKER OR PULSE? OR GLOW STEADILY?They glowed steadily. They were constantly on.HOW LONG WAS THE TIME WHEN YOU REALIZED THE BIG V-SHAPED CRAFTWAS FLYING OVER YOUR CAR AS YOU WERE GOING BACK HOME TO WHENIT WAS TURNING AROUND AT TREETOP LEVEL WHEN YOU STOPPED AT THERIVER?About 30 to 40 minutes.SO ABOUT A HALF-HOUR IS THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT THE THREE OF YOUSAW IT CLOSE ENOUGH TO GENERATE THE COMPUTER IMAGES?Right.THAT HALF-HOUR WAS AT THE END OF AT LEAST THREE HOURS THAT BEGANWHEN YOU FIRST REALIZED THE TWO LIGHTS YOU THOUGHT WERE CARLIGHTS STARTED TO MOVE?Yes, out of the water.THE LIGHTS CAME UP OUT OF THE WATER?Right. In the shoreline, it looked like a car driving under water. That’s what it would looklike looking at the ocean.DO YOU MEAN THAT THOSE TWO LIGHTS THAT CAME UP OUT OF THE WATERBECAME THIS HUGE V-SHAPED CRAFT?Yes, that’s what I’m thinking. We didn't see the V-craft rise out of the water, but the bigV-craft was above us in the sky after we saw those lights moving underwater.THAT IS ASTONISHING IF IT WERE OVER 300-FEET-LONG, V-SHAPED, ANDROSE OUT OF THE WATER OFF THE COAST OF FLORIDA.Right. I’ve never seen lights like that in the ocean and I’ve lived here pretty much mywhole life and that was the beginning of the incident with the lights in the water.WHERE EXACTLY DO YOU THINK THE LIGHTS CAME UP OUT OF THE WATER?I think like it was coming from out in the ocean towards the shoreline and then lifted up.WHERE DID IT LIFT UP?Near Jetty Park near Kennedy Space Center, Cape Canaveral Air Station.SO RIGHT OFF KENNEDY WHERE THE SHUTTLE IS LAUNCHED?Right. There’s a port there called Port Canaveral where the cruise ships come in."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"YOU SAW THE ANOMALOUS LIGHTS COME UP OUT OF THE WATER NEARKENNEDY.

As we’re coming up over the bridge that connects Cocoa Beachand Merritt Island, we noticed in the horizon to the west it looked like four stars in aconstellation. I had never seen that before and as we drove towards the ‘constellation,’ itcame up over the car.

I was trying to understand. What was going through my mind at thetime is that it was some kind of military craft, but I could not understand why it wasassociating with us. My first impression was that it was a new kind of military jet oraircraft or something. But I could not understand why it was turning and hanging out withus.WHAT KIND OF WORDS DID THE THREE OF YOU SAY TO EACH OTHER ABOUTWHAT IT MIGHT BE?We really didn’t say anything at that point until we had followed it towards Patrick AFB.After it left and it was out in the distance and we could not see it anymore, we all seemedto think it was some kind of military vehicle from Patrick AFB because that’s the directionit was going towards. But we couldn’t understand why it was following us and why it wasabove our car and why did it turn when we stopped – those kinds of questions. Butbasically, we were in shock!

From the back, it looked like four amber-orange stars in the sky as itleft.I WONDER WHY ONLY FOUR AND NOT SEVEN LIGHTS?Because I guess the other ones as it curved into the V-shape, you can’t see them. But tothe eye, it looked like four amber stars in the sky. I think you are seeing the last four of thelights. The front three, because of the curve of the V, are out of sight.DO YOU TODAY IN JANUARY 2009 STILL THINK IT WAS A MILITARY CRAFT?No.WHAT HAS CHANGED?When the Phoenix lights story was on CNN, earlier that evening people had witnessed agiant V-craft. That’s when it came to my attention again and it kind of verified to myfamily and friends who did not believe us that that is what we had seen in 1987.SINCE 1987, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING THAT WAS V-SHAPED ANDSEEMED TO BE TRANSLUCENT, OR CAMOUFLAGED BY STARS, FLYING IN THEFL ORIDA SKIE S?No, I have never seen anything like that ever again.WHAT IS AMAZING TO ME IS THAT IN THAT VERY POPULATED AREA INAUGUST THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT OF PEOPLE OUTSIDE BETWEEN10 PM AND 1 AM.Right, that’s what I can’t understand either. [ Bobby did not report this sighting at the timehimself because he and his friends were uncertain what to say or do. Further, when Bobbywatched television news and read the newspapers, he found nothing had been reported sohe did not say anything until 2003. That year he contacted the Brevard County MUFONDirector who said there might have been a radar report, but when I called that sameMUFON Director, he said he didn't have any radar details.]IT’S EITHER A PART OF THE HIGH STRANGENESS OR A SERIOUS COMMENT ONTHE FACT THAT MOST HUMANS DON’T LOOK UP AT THE SKY.Right.

(Cape Canaveral.) Our mission was Special Assignments whichmeant we protected the Space Program. We would go to sea and patrol whilethe shuttle was on the pad.“On October 24 and 25, 1989, my ship (submarine) was on patrol about 150miles off the Florida coast. We were cruising at about 500 feet (below theocean surface) when the submarine started experiencing electronics problems.The ship was malfunctioning, our tanks were blowing out of control, we werelosing navigation ability and the communications area was totally lost. Wewent to all stop and tried to access what was happening. The controls in the(nuclear) reactor area started to malfunction. This presented a serious dangerto our safety, so the captain ordered us to shut down the reactor, surface andgo to diesel motors.“When the ship surfaced, I went to my watch station. The ship was stillexperiencing electronic difficulties, but the mechanical devices such as dieselengines, cook stoves, and turbines were fine. It was raining and the entire skywas red like a red neon sign. I saw a large inverted V-shaped UFO off the portside. The executive officer told me to stand fast and he would speak to thecaptain. In a minute, the captain appeared on the tower and asked me for adistance to the craft. The laser range finder determined the closest point was200 meters and the farthest point was 1,000 meters off the port. The UFO wasnot perpendicular to our ship, but at about a 45-degree angle. This huge vesselwas over a half mile across. The UFO made a half circle around our ship andthen passed across the stern causing our electronics systems to go crazy. Wehad permanent damage in communications and the sonar room.“As the craft flew over the stern, I could see the rain stop under its red glow.The water seemed to rise almost a foot as the UFO passed over silently. Whenthe UFO finished its swing across the stern, it paused - the sky got brighter redand it simply moved off at tremendous speed inside 15 seconds. When theUFO left, our boat returned to normal with the exception of the radio andsonar. We did a quick system check and the captain ordered us to return to"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"reactor power and get underway.“The captain took two petty officers, the executive officer, and myself intothe wardroom. He told us to not spread any rumors until we had a chance totalk to Commander Submarine Fleet - Atlantic. We reached port in about 7hours where I was taken into ‘protective custody.’ Two enlisted men andmyself agreed we had witnessed a real UFO. I was the one who shot it with alaser range finder, so I was the only one that had its exact sizes. I shot thatvessel as it hovered and I got solid readings - not spotty like I would on debris.“We were in holding for about three hours when an officer from the U. S. AirForce arrived and gave us a line of bull about an exploding weather satellite.The Navy then transferred virtually everyone on the crew to new assignments.This included the captain, the executive officer and the entire crew. Theywere split up, which almost never happens unless one of them gets apromotion or a new command, neither of which happened. The military justsplit up a 4-year team. I was watching a program tonight that gave me thecourage to share this.”Case ID: 1110 Duke University News Update, January 16, 2009: Next Generation Cloaking Device Demonstrated; Metamaterial Renders Object“ Invisible”“A device that can bestow invisibility to an object by ‘cloaking’ it from visuallight is closer to reality. The latest advance was made possible by thedevelopment of a new series of complex mathematical commands, known asalgorithms, to guide the design and fabrication of exotic composite materialsknown as metamaterials. These materials can be engineered to have propertiesnot easily found in natural materials, and can be used to form a variety ofcloaking structures. These structures can guide electromagnetic waves aroundan object, only to have them emerge on the other side as if they had passedthrough an empty volume of space.Cloaking devices bend electromagnetic waves, such as light, in such a waythat it appears as if the cloaked object is not there. In the latest laboratoryexperiments, a beam of microwaves aimed through the cloaking device at a‘bump’ on a flat mirror surface bounced off the surface at the same angle as ifthe bump were not present.David R. Smith, Ph.D., William Bevan Prof. of Electricaland Computer Engineering at Duke University with new cloaking device,which measures 20 inches by 4 inches and is less than an inch high. It is madeof more than 10,000 individual pieces arranged in parallel rows per unique algorithms.Of those pieces, more than 6,000 are unique. Each is the same fiberglass materialused in circuit boards and etched with copper. 2009 image courtesy Duke University.“The underlying cloaking phenomenon is similar to the mirages seen ahead ata distance on a road on a hot day. ‘You see what looks like water hoveringover the road, but it is in reality a reflection from the sky,’ explained David R.Smith, Ph.D., William Bevan Professor of Electrical and ComputerEngineering at Duke. ‘In that example, the mirage you see is cloaking the roadbelow. In effect, we are creating an engineered mirage with this latest cloak"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"design.’“Prof. Smith believes that cloaks should find numerous applications as thetechnology is perfected. By eliminating the effects of obstructions, cloakingdevices could improve wireless communications, or acoustic cloaks couldserve as protective shields, preventing the penetration of vibrations, sound orseismic waves.‘The ability of the cloak to hide the bump is compelling, and offers a pathtowards the realization of forms of cloaking abilities approaching the optical,’said Ruopeng Liu, who developed the algorithm. ‘Though the designs of suchmetamaterials are extremely complex, especially when traditional approachesare used, we believe that we now have a way to rapidly and efficientlyproduce such materials.’”Clearly, if the Duke University breakthrough is the best humans have been able to do sofar with simple cloaking, human technology cannot explain the star field camouflage overthe surface of the large V-shaped aircraft, longer than a football field and an estimated twostories high, near Cape Canaveral, Florida, around 12:30 AM Eastern on August 16, 1987.
