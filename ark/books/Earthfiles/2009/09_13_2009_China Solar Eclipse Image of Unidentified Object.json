Image © 2009 by JijinshanAstronomical Observatory, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China.September 13, 2009 Nanjing, Jiangsu, China - Ji Haisheng, Director of the JijinshanAstronomical Observatory in Nanjing, China, is upset that on September 7, 2009, U. K.'sDaily Mail used his quotes in an article headlined: “UFO ‘filmed for 40 minutes’ byChinese scientists during solar eclipse.” Dr. Haisheng told CHINAdaily.com on September12, “Obviously, there have been misunderstandings. That's false news. I said ‘anunidentified object,’ not ‘an unidentified flying object.’” Dr. Haisheng explained furtherthat the bright spot might be “some coronal activity filmed during the total eclipse” and itcould take a year to analyze and identify. Dr. Haisheng confirmed his observatoryrecorded 40 minutes of the solar corona during the total solar eclipse, not 40 minutes of aUFO.However, in Guangdong Province, some students studying the July 22, 2009, total solareclipse from a rooftop photographed what they described as “a walnut-shaped”unidentified aerial object.
