According to some eyewitnesses, the white and blue spiralsremained in the sky for ten to twelve minutes before fading out completely.Image © 2009 by Svein-Egil Haugen.Unexplained white and blue aerial spiral lights were seen for several minutes between Tromsoand the Finnmark region of northern Norway before sunup on Wednesday, December 9, 2009.Update 10:30 PM Mtn, December 10, 2009: “We have seen rockets being launched from northwest Russia,and from the rocket range in Kiruna in northern Sweden, and fromthe neighboring Andenes in northern Norway, but nothing like this.”- Truls Lynne Hansen, Dir., Tromso Geophysical Observatory, NorwayAfter the Russian government's denial on December 9, 2009, that it had not conductedany missile tests that could explain the white and blue light spirals over northern Norway,today on December 10, 2009, the Russian Defense Ministry now says a Bulava ballisticmissile launch from the Russian Navy nuclear submarine “Dmitry Donskoi” in the regionhad failed. However, the Russian Defense Ministry would not confirm any connectionwith the white and blue spiraling lights over northern Norway. Adding to the mystery isNorway's concern that its government had no prior communication from Russia that anysuch missile tests were scheduled near northern Norway.Another speculation has been microwave tests of the ionosphere from Tromso, Norway,impacting the atmosphere in an unexpected way. But, ionospheric physicists in Gakona,Alaska; Arecibo, Puerto Rico; Tromso, Norway; and other facilities have been bouncingmicrowaves off the ionosphere for at least a decade of research. Any oscillation thathumans produce in the ionosphere is immediately obliterated as soon as sun rays shine onany part of the ionosphere. However, spiraling lights phenomenon as seen andphotographed over northern Norway yesterday has not been reported at ionosphericresearch sites."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Original Report December 9, 2009 Tromso to Finnmark, Norway - A bizarre whitelight began spiraling in the Norwegian sky early Wednesday morning, December 9, 2009,around 7:50 AM local time.See: VG-TV Video.See: YouTube videos.U. K.'s Daily MailOnline reports, “The phenomenon began when what appeared to be ablue light seemed to soar up from behind a mountain. The light stopped mid-air, thenbegan to circulate (rotate around and around). Within seconds, a giant spiral had covered alarge portion of sky. Then a green-blue beam of light shot out from its centre - lasting forten to twelve minutes before disappearing completely. The Norwegian MeteorologicalInstitute was flooded with telephone calls - which astronomers have said did not appear tohave been connected to the aurora, or Northern Lights, so common in that area of theworld.”First speculations were that the mysterious spiraling lights might have been a Russianmissile test, but Russia denies it was conducting any missile tests in the Norwegian area.Before sunup on December 9, 2009, residents in northern Norway were photographing,videotaping and describing a baffling aerial phenomenon that some said looked like agiant computer-generated graphic in the early morning sky.
