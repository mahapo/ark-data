After high school, he attended the Culinary Institute ofAmerica and graduated with a degree in culinary arts. After apprenticeship with a Frenchchef, he and his wife opened up their own restaurant and inn two years ago in Fryeburg,Maine, near the New Hampshire border.Close to the Conway, New Hampshire border is Fryeburg, Maine,a little south of the White Mountain National Forest and northwest of Portland, Maine.White Mountain National Forest was also the locationof the famous September 19, 1961, encounter between Betty and Barney Hilland non-human entities and their craft near Franconia Notch, New Hampshire.Illustration of aerial craft suddenly swooping in front of Hill's car by UFOCasebook.See August 31, 2007 2-Part Earthfiles.Last year on September 18, 2008, Jonathan, his wife and neighbors walked into town fordinner. A couple of months earlier in July, there had been a fire that completely leveled abuilding at a major intersection in town. The four were looking at the resulting openedview when all saw a bright, white light shine on and off in the night sky.“ Then came a second and third white light shining on and off forming a triangle pattern inthe sky. Very deliberate on and off, on and off, on and off in three points of a triangle,”Jonathan explained.A week later on September 25, 2008, Jonathan Spak was walking to his compost pile andsaw five more bright, white lights flash on and off, but that time the pattern was a straightline. To his amazement, later that same night, he saw the on-off flashes of light form"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"“another straight line of five dots.” September 21 and 25, 2009A year later on Monday, September 21, 2009, Jonathan was walking home when he sawthe same colorful, large, twinkling light in the sky he remembered from the year before. Heran in the house, grabbed his Canon Rebel digital camera and tripod, set them up outsidefacing northwest toward the sparkling light, turned off both auto focus and flash. Hequickly took a couple of photographs and then had to get back to his inn for work. Here isone of those photographs.Canon Rebel digital image, cropped, taken Monday, September 21, 2009,in Fryeburg, Maine.

Image © 2009 by Jonathan Spak.Interview:Jonathan Spak, Chef and Inn Owner, Fryeburg, Maine: “Later in that week onWednesday night, September 23, we saw it again. And then on Friday night, September 25,was the second night I got the camera out and actually had more time because ourrestaurant was closed for the night. I set the camera up to take 10 sequential shots so Iwould not have to press the trigger button and jar the camera.I went back into the house, came back five minutes later to set the camera to take 10 moresequential shots, but by that time, the light was gone.SO THE LIGHT HAD DISAPPEARED FROM YOUR CAMERA FRAME WITHINFIVE MINUTES?Yes. In the time it took to open and close the shutter for 10 shots, the object was out of theviewfinder. I had to readjust the camera, refocus and try to take the picture, but then theobject disappeared."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Friday, September 25, 2009, other Canon Rebel digital images of unusual, 3-dimensional,colorful structure, cropped. Paralleling the anomalous aerial object are the fainter linesof star tracks during the camera's time exposure. Image © 2009 by Jonathan Spak.THE LIGHTS ARE 3-DIMENSIONAL. THEY HAVE OVERLAPPING PARTS. ALSO,YOU CAN SEE THE NORMAL STAR TRAILS IN YOUR TIME EXPOSURE.Ye s .WHAT WAS THE LENGTH OF THE TIME EXPOSURE?Just whatever the Automatic Exposure is. I’m not a professional photographer by anymeans and I preferred the automatic settings. I took the camera, put it on my tripod, put iton No Flash mode to turn the flash off, turned off auto focus, and clicked the shutter.[ Editor's Note: Camera specs provided by Jonathan - “Make of the camera isCannon EOS Rebel XSi, Shooting Mode - Flash Off, Shutter Speed - 20,Aperature Value - 5.6, Exposure Compensation - 0, ISO - 800. I was using my300mm zoom lens all the way extended. Time lapse length in auto mode isonly the duration of the previous picture. For example during a clearly litsequence, the camera could potentially fire off 10 shots in a few seconds. Thisbeing a night shot, as soon as the previous picture was done, it went into thesequence of taking the next and I'm not sure how long that was.” ]WHAT COULD YOU SEE WITH YOUR NAKED EYE?,I took astronomy in high school and know that planets are typically larger than stars,typically brighter and don’t twinkle much. This looked like the larger planet size. It was alarge object and you could definitely tell with the naked eye that in the twinkle there was acolor change happening.WHAT COLORS WERE YOU SEEING?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"With the naked eye, you could see there was a green and orange and red and yellow – youcould see there was a variance in the color as it was twinkling.IT WAS WHITE AT FIRST AND THEN THE WHITE WAS CHANGED TO ADIFFERENT COLOR?No, it seemed like there was one central light and there was colorful twinkling going onaround it.[ Editor's Note: Please see 2008 - 2009 Earthfiles Archived reports belowfor Stephenville, Texas, and other unexplained light reports. ]It was out again last night (October 10, 2009).DID YOU TAKE MORE PHOTOS?I did get some more pictures, but none of the colorful lines were showing in the pictures.WHAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE CAMERA SETTING?I really couldn’t guess. It was just as starry last night, just as clear and you could see it withthe naked eye. Same exact color changing in the same exact area of the sky.YOU WERE SEEING THE SPARKLING COLORS, BUT YOU DIDN’T GET THEM ONTHE CAMERA’S DIGITAL FRAMES?No. I think there were 27 photos I took from Monday and Friday (Sept. 21 and Sept. 25)that are my first pictures. The three I sent you were the three that were most notable (ofcolorful structure). There was a bunch where all you could see was the bright, whitestreak. Maybe I didn’t catch it at the right time. Light Images UnexplainedA man who is career military here is absolutely perplexed by the photos. He sent them offto somebody in the FAA and somebody in Washington, D. C. to ask them questions aboutwhat it could be. Haven’t heard anything back from him yet.I also sent the photos to the Mt. Washington Observatory, the highest point in theNortheast, to see if they knew anything. They are meteorologists, not astronomers, but thelight shows up in that general direction. It’s more northwest of Fryeburg. But they don’tknow either.ANY JET OR HELICOPTER ACTIVITY AROUND LIGHTS?Nothing close that I could hear - some plane lights far off in the distance.” Compare to December 10, 2008, 9 PM Pacific,Over Washoe Valley South of Reno, NevadaNormal star in upper left corner with mysterious multiple colored object in lower right."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Normal stars in opposite corners with mysterious multiple-colored object changing patternsbetween.
