Digital image © 2008 by Penny Rubsam. January 29, 2009 Reno, Nevada - The morning after my December 17, 2008, three hour newsbroadcast on Coast to Coast AM with George Noory, I received the following email from PennyRubsam - a Reno, Nevada, resident - along with several photographs she had taken on December10, 2008, after 9 PM Pacific over the Washoe Valley south of Reno. Penny is 52-years-old, haslived in Reno for twenty-three years and moved to her current home in 2005. Her photographsare very similar to the videotape by David Caron near the Stephenville, Texas, Airport on January19, 2008. [ See a hot link to David Caron's videotape in the Stephenville section of this reportbelow and other Earthfiles report links in More Information at the end of this report.]What are these multi-colored light patterns on video and still cameras? The Caron video (hot linkafter Reno images) shows an out-of-focus, disc-shaped object hovering in the sky from which themulti-colored patterns begin projecting outward for several minutes, changing shape everyone-half second on the 30-frames-per-second videotape. Some dismissed the Caron videotape asan electronic glitch in his digital video camera. But the other multi-colored light patterns in thevariety of geographical regions have all been photographed with digital still cameras. The Reno,Nevada, resident says in her email below, “I do know the light was there for several days before Iphotographed it.”Red circle is Reno, Nevada. Straight south, the red star is the location of Washoe Valley.“Subject: Object Over RenoDate: December 18, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Hello Linda,I love your work and I thought that I would share this info with you to see if youmight be interested. The photos were taken Dec. 10th, 2008, Wednesday night, and itwas after 9:00 p.m. My daughter helped with this as she had just come back fromvisiting her boyfriend and saw me hanging off the second floor balcony. This anglelooks southeast over the Washoe Valley. I haven't taken time to travel around thevalley to see if the angle changes, too busy for Christmas. I do know the light wasthere for several days before I photographed it. The clouds are up and I can't tell ifit's around now. But I can say the last time the night sky was clear, it was still there.My daughter and I had noticed a rather bright light over the Reno valley for severaldays. Thinking it may be a star we fairly ignored it until we noticed that it seemed tohave different colors showing, but it was still hard to see.I finally photographed the mysterious light with my digital camera and was surprisedto see colored light patterns similar to the ones that were taken in Stephenville, Texasduring the mass sighting events in January 2008.I will attach the photos. I did take several shots and I also took shots of stars in thedistance to judge if I were jiggling my camera around. That was not the case. Thestars in the shots are just bright spots, but the object in question was squiggling allover the place.Last time I looked out the window this thing was still sitting over the valley. I cannotdetermine how far up it is though.Thanks for your time.

At one point, the two discuss that the pulsing multi-coloredpatterns in the sky look like “hieroglyphs.” [ Hundreds of image patterns in severalminutes of digital videotape in which the pattern is changing twice a second.] The Caron videotape and the Reno photos are also very similar to other photographs taken in:Glen Rose, Texas, on January 20, 2008One of many pulsing symbols watched by Joan of Glen Rose, Texas,at 5:30 AM Central, on January 20, 2008, seven hours after David in Stephenvillevideotaped pulsing symbols for nearly 13 minutes.

It was just something that you look up and see something that is unique and youknow you have not seen something like that there before. The appearance of it was maybe a weekor two before my photographs [December 10, 2008, after 9 PM Pacific, over the Washoe Valleysouth of Reno].WHAT WAS UNUSUAL THAT CAUGHT YOUR ATTENTION?Oh, the different colors! You can look up in the sky and you can see white stars. You can seesome that sparkle and you can see some stars that really super sparkle. But when you look up andsee something that is sparkling brilliantly in red, blue and a green color. This is what I see. And Ihave seen this same thing a couple of times before in this location.DID YOU PUT THE CAMERA ON THE EDGE OF THE DECK OR ANY PLACE TO MAKESURE THAT IT WAS STEADY?I did all of the above – in my hands, braced on the edge of the balcony, which is a large stuccowall.ANYONE WHO SAID THIS MUST BE SOMEBODY JIGGLING THE CAMERA – THISWOULD NOT EXPLAIN IT?Right, and that’s why when I noticed that there were the other two stars in the background thatwere solid, that’s what was very interesting, I thought. This is a camera also that I useprofessionally for my business. I could see the stars off in the distance situated on either side ofthe flashing light. I knew that it was important if this were something other than a star, that Ishould photograph the stars for contrast [ to the multi-colored, changing patterns.] So, I did go outof my way to take the larger wide shot to get those two stars and then I just sort of cropped thephoto down so you could see the two stars on either side. Penny Tested Her NikonCool Pix 4300 CameraIn order to establish that her camera is not putting abnormal points of light or patterns on herdigital images, I asked her to keep the lens cap on and click three times to see if any of the imageshad aberrations. Penny's camera results below are solid black frames."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Here again is one of her December 10, 2008, Nikon images she took of the colorful, pattern-changing object in the middle and two solid, unmoving stars she could see with her naked eye inthe corners.Normal stars in opposite corners with mysterious multiple-colored object changing patternsbetween. December 10, 2008, 9 PM Pacific, over Washoe Valley South of Reno, Nevada.Image © 2008 by Penny Rubsam. WHAT WAS THE TIME, DO YOU THINK, BETWEEN EACH PHOTOGRAPH?Maybe about five or ten seconds because it is a digital and takes a little longer to recover betweenshots.WHAT WERE YOU SEEING WITH YOUR EYES AND WHAT WERE YOU SEEING WHENYOU LOOKED THROUGH THE CAMERA?With my eyes, I simply saw a brilliant, out of the ordinary sparkle on an object that had differentcolors. I could actually see red and blue and green. Then with the camera, the same sort of thing. Icould see the same sparkling. At the distance, it was a little difficult, which is why I ended upblowing up the shots. So, I would say it mostly looked the same through the lens as it did to myeyes."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"FROM THE VERY FIRST NIGHT THAT YOU STARTED PHOTOGRAPHING, HOW MANYMORE TIMES HAVE YOU SEEN THIS SPARKLING, PROJECTING COLORS OBJECT?AND HAVE YOU TAKEN MORE PHOTOS?I saw it a couple more times [four times in December 2008]. Why Aren't Military, Police or Homeland Security ScramblingAfter Aerial Unknowns?THE FACT THAT THIS HAS BEEN REPEATING AT LEAST FOUR TIMES IN DECEMBER,DO YOU FIND IT ODD THAT THERE HAVE NOT BEEN SCRAMBLED JETS ORHELICOPTERS AROUND THIS OBJECT?Well, yes! (laughs) I find that rather odd. But I get the sense that there is quite a bit up there.(laughs) You know, it’s there! They are there and why hasn’t anyone noticed? Why isn’t anyonesaying anything? I mean, it is so obvious there are things there!AND WHAT IS IT DOING?I don’t know! It’s watching (laughs). I don’t know. All I know is that there are too many peopleseeing too many things, taking tons of photographs and videos. So that old argument doesn’t sitwell any longer – ‘Why isn’t anyone taking pictures?’ Well, they are! They are everywhere.I’m a very logical person and I understand the logic of science. But I have gone past that into,‘Oh, there’s other stuff. I better open up my mind to something here.’IN THE FOUR TIMES IN DECEMBER 2008, THAT YOU HAVE BEEN AT YOUR HOME ONTHAT DECK AND WATCHING THIS STRANGE OBJECT PROJECT THE MULTI-COLOREDPATTERNS, DID YOU EVER FEEL NERVOUS OR AFRAID?No, never. It was more of a curiosity like, ‘Gee, what’s that? What’s it doing there?’HAVE YOU EVER TRIED TO CALL THE POLICE OR FEMA OR ANYBODY ...?No, no!WHY NOT?I would think their job would be to protect us and we are not being harmed, but I honestly don’tthink they would believe a word I said. This would not matter to them because they have moreimportant things to do. The governments have to know it’s happening and they are helpless andit’s getting more and more so. They can’t stop whatever is happening.AND THE FACT THAT JETS AND HELICOPTERS HAVE NOT SHOWED UP ONCE AT THEFOUR SIGHTINGS OUTSIDE OF YOUR RESIDENCE WHERE YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TOWATCH FOR MINUTES SOMETHING IN THE SKY THAT IS CLEARLY NOT SOMETHINGASTRONOMICAL IS A COMMENT ON THE GOVERNMENT HAVING KNOWLEDGE INORDER NOT TO SCRAMBLE.Yes. There are too many records now. It’s like everything is being recorded. People aren’t soafraid to speak up. My lack of wanting to call the police is not so much on fear of ridicule –because it doesn’t matter to me anymore, you know, I’ll speak openly on whatever. It’s mostlythat I know there is nothing the government can do.” If anyone else in the Reno and Washoe Valley, Nevada, region or any other locations has seenand/or photographed these changing, multi-colored light patterns, please contact: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
