No cells were destroyed. The excisionwas separated between cells, cell by cell.” - Iona Hoeppner,Briggsdale High School Science Teacher From Fort Collins to Briggsdale to Sterling, Colorado, the red dots on the map include some of the ranchingcommunities where animal mutilations were reported repeatedly in the 1970s and 1980s.Return to Part 1October 20, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - The following continues from Parts 1- 5about the 1980 animal mutilation high strangeness summary I typed up for my privateresearch files and am now sharing for the first time in this Real X-Files series. Thissegments continues on September 19, 1980, after Iona Hoeppner's Briggsdale, Colorado,high school lab was broken into and all her mutilated calf samples from the Roland Ballranch were stolen. Interview Notes from Phone Conversationwith Iona Hoeppner on October 15, 1980The next day on September 19, 1980, Iona Hoeppner called Weld County SheriffHarold Andrews' office. She did not tell them that her samples were stolen. Shewanted to know what the sheriff had learned before, so she told them she hadtaken samples and wanted to compare her findings with theirs. It took threephone calls over the day to finally get the reluctant answer that the sheriff hadsent the samples to the Colorado State University lab in Fort Collins.Iona called the CSU lab and they would not tell her anything. In fact, the personin the lab Iona talked to told her that no specimens had ever arrived from theWeld County Sheriff!Iona knows someone who works in the CSU Chemistry lab where they do work"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"on tissue samples. Iona asked him if he could find out about the samples fromSheriff Andrews and he said he had to worry about his job and family. But hedid ask someone in the pathology lab where the specimens were and was told,\"They were misplaced.\" Her friend told Iona, \"The calf specimens were here - Ican guarantee you that much.\"WHAT IS GOING ON AT CSU? WHY IS THE LAB LYING?Greeley Tribune Reporter Bill Jackson told me that Sheriff Andrews did find awhite, powdery substance around one of the calves that he sampled onSeptember 16, 1980, and sent to the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) inDenver for analysis. And CBI sent the powder to the CSU lab in Fort Collins.The lab report to CBI was \"Maggot eggs.\"Iona Hoeppner told me, \"That's ridiculous! It did not take me two minutes afterseeing that calf to tell me it was a pretty sophisticated operation. I don't thinkhumans have the ability to do what was done to the calf that was fresh enoughto analyze.\"Iona examined under a microscope the hide sample she excised that containedboth the mutilator cut and Sheriff Andrews' cut. She said that in the mutilator'scut, there were no maggot eggs, nothing. In the Sheriff Andrews cut, there weremaggot eggs.On September 20, Iona Hoeppner went back to the Roland Ball ranch to gathermore samples. Maggots were everywhere EXCEPT where the mutilators hadcut. And there were no maggot eggs on the mutilation cuts. However, the areaof the two puncture wounds on the back of the calf's neck was completelydestroyed by maggots as of September 20, 1980, four days after the calfmutilations were discovered on September 16, 1980.Iona told me, \"Normally scavenger animals will come and tear away flesh. Butthere had not been a single scavenger there at all, even by September 20th. \" Ofcourse, the Balls, the Sheriff and his people and Iona Hoeppner had been thereSeptember 16 and 18, so there were human odors all over the calf bodies.Iona and I talked about the fact that there had been a lot of young steers andyoung heifers mutilated in Colorado in 1980 and not many 3 and 4-year-oldcows, which were the largest number of mutilated animals in 1975 to 1976.WHY THE DIFFERENCE IN AGES?Iona said the younger animals would be at a hormonal change peak, like ouradolescents. She wondered if some check of the plant life that the animals areeating could reveal any differences?WHY TAKE TAIL TASSLE H AIR?\"It's protein, but why is it different from hair elsewhere on the cow's body?\"Iona and I wondered if Sheriff Andrews, or other federal agency, might haveordered the break in of Iona Hoeppner's high school lab to deliberately steal thesamples for government confidential analysis?More strangeness occurred. On September 20, 1980, because Iona had all thosesamples stolen from her lab, she ha gone back to the mutilation site. The Ballsknew she was returning and Roland Ball intended to accompany her back to thedead calves, but the Balls had company. So, Iona Hoeppner called up a femalefriend to go with her. \"I frankly was feeling a bit spooked by then.\"This time, Iona used sterile gloves and said she was extremely careful to getwhat samples she could.a) Got another fluid sample from the ground. The fluid lookedexactly as it had looked on September 18 when she was first there.The reddish fluid was still on top of the soft ground, not soaking inand not evaporating.b) Also, the muscle tissue at the mutilation cuts were stillwell-preserved.c) Iona also got seven other fluid samples from all over thefreshest calf's body, including maggot areas for comparison. Shecarefully labeled each sample vial.d) Roland Ball had talked to Iona about the break in and wonderedif she went out and took ore samples and took them back to the lab"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"would those be stolen, too?So, Iona hid some of her real samples and put some dummy ones in vials thatwere colored by dyes and put them in the same rack as her first samples onSeptember 18, 1980. The next morning all were gone.After the second theft of mutilated calf samples, she found the door, windows,everything was still locked. But she knew the lab door was easy to jimmy open.The Briggsdale High School Superintendent did not want police in to scarestudents and parents, so the Superintendent took fine powder and a brush tolook for fingerprints around the opened window, door knob, and sample jars.But whoever took the mutilated calf samples made certain no fingerprints wereleft behind. Everything was clean.Iona Hoeppner said that as far as she knew, only the Superintendent, herself, theRoland Balls and her family knew anything about the second break in and theftof the planted, phony samples. And yet, the Superintendent received a call fromthe Grover Superintendent who said he heard from a bus driver who heard frompeople at a football game that there had been TWO BREAK INS at BriggsdaleHigh School and he wanted to know what was going on.Iona Hoeppner still has what she hid away:a) Fluid sample from ground that did not absorb.b) Tissue sample from belly that included the mutilator's cut andSheriff Andrew's cut.IONA HOEPPNER'S FINDINGS ON SECOND MUTILATED CALFSAMPLES FROM ROLAND BALL RANCH, BRIGGSDALE,COLORADO:Reddish fluid from ground near mutilated calf - Microscopic examrevealed NO CARBON. Therefore, it was not organic. Iona askedsome of the local mortuaries about embalming fluids. None knewof any that did not contain carbon. Common non-carbon liquidsare acids, bases, salts and water.As an experiment, Iona took water, carbon tet and other liquids,including viscous mineral oil, to the mutilation site to see howthose liquids would penetrate the soft ground. All soaked in easily.Even the mineral oil was absorbed, although it took longer than theless viscous liquids. [ Editor's Note: Carbon tetrachloride is anorganic compound used as a reagent in synthetic chemistry.]Also, the reddish fluid under the microscope was clear anduniform, except for \"some strange-looking rectangles that Iestimate were 10 microns by 3 microns with striations on therectangles running crosswise. The rectangles did not look likeanything I have seen before.\"My first thought was that maybe the strange red fluid rectangleswere individual muscle cells. But if so, then the solution shouldhave had carbon in it. I tried hydrogen peroxide in interaction withthe strange reddish liquid, but nothing happened. If organic, therewould have been some reaction.\"There was no bacteria in the reddish liquid at all. \"It was as sterileas anything I've ever looked at under a microscope and I looked atit both before and after filtering through filter paper to get any soilout. I don't have any equipment powerful enough to see viruses, soI don't know about them, but there was absolutely no bacteria.\"And no abnormal Geiger counter reading either. A month later on October 16, 1980, when I interviewed Iona Hoeppner, I askedher if the reddish fluid was still on the surface of the soil at the Roland Ballranch in Briggsdale.Iona told me there is a discolored, maroon-brown colored spot left on the soiland all the grass in the immediate area around the calf mutilation site is dead.\"I don't think the liquid evaporated. I think it just slowly sank into the soil,\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Iona said. \"I still ask myself: Why wouldn't the reddish fluid that had no carbonin it be absorbed by loose soil when the water, carbon tet, potassium chloridesolutions and salt solutions went down into the ground so easily? That fluidstayed on top of the ground for at least two weeks.\"Iona told me she became convinced that \"in that reddish fluid I examined at thelab under my microscope, those were small crystals 1 x 2 microns and shapedlike rectangles that were longer than wide. But there were several sides, morethan four and at least six, so the crystal had the appearance of being roundedinstead of squared off. The crystals had no attraction for each other. They werejust thinly scattered throughout the reddish liquid sample.\"WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE CRYSTALS IN THE FLUID?Iona said she injected methalin blue and carmine yellow. The fluid took on thedye color, but the crystals did not. Also, the striated, rectangular \"crystals\" thatdid not take on the color could be seen more easily in the dyed background.\"The fact that the crystals would not take on the dyes also affirms they are notorganic.\"WHAT PHYSICAL PROPERTIES WOULD CAUSE THE ODD REDDISHLIQUID TO NOT ABSORB INTO THE GROUND?\"I really don't know why the strange liquid around the mutilated calf did notabsorb into the soft soil. It's intriguing and it is scary.\" No Cells Destroyedin Mutilator ExcisionDID YOU SEE ANYTHING ELSE IN THE OTHER SAMPLES?\"I did careful microscopic exam on the tissue cut from the calf's belly. It wasnot a cut, not a laser burn. NO CELLS WERE DESTROYED. THEEXCISION WAS SEPARATED BETWEEN CELLS, CELL BY CELL. NOCELL WAS DISTRUPED IN THE MUTILATOR'S CUT. There is nothingthat I know of that could do such a thing.\"Iona elaborated explaining there is a natural cohesion between cells - they like tostick together and cuts always destroy their cell walls, which she found in SheriffAndrews' cuts and the cut she made with her own scalpel. \"But on themicroscopic level, those were absolutely perfect cells in the wall of themutilator's excision.\"WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO SEPARATE SOME OF THAT TISSUEAS ANOTHER SAMPLE THAT COULD GO TO THE SCHOENFELDLAB IN ALBUQUERQUE? [ I had worked with the lab on the Robert Blakehorse sample in September 22, 2009 Earthfiles. ]Iona said, \"The tissue sample had been frozen since September 18, and I don'tknow if the cells would still be so well preserved now or not,\" but she is willingto let the Schoenfeld Lab in Albuquerque examine it, too, if some way to getspecimen to that lab without further deterioration. Linda Drives to Briggsdale, Coloradoto Get Calf Tissue Samples from Iona HoeppnerI ended up driving up to Briggsdale to receive Iona Hoeppner's package of theunusual tissue in which cells appeared under the microscope to be separated cellby cell. No one knew I was traveling there and that night at the high school wasan event in which students and parents were everywhere when I arrived. Ionaand I talked briefly in my car, she handed me the package and I turned on theengine of my car to drive off.Immediately, my car was filled with a high-pitched tone. I shut my engine off,but the high-pitched tone was still there. I opened my car door, stood outsidelistening for the tone, but could not hear it outside my car. I sat back behind thesteering wheel, shut the car door, and the high-pitched tone was loud. I debatedwhether to find a police officer or someone to sit in my car to listen. But Idecided I would not risk ridicule of my work at Channel 7. So, I turned on theradio loud enough to nearly cover up the high-pitched tone and drove off."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The trip to my Littleton, Colorado, home then was a little over two hours. Thehigh-pitched tone filled my car all the way into my drive way. I clicked thebutton to raise the garage door, with an urgent desire to run in the house to getmy husband to listen inside my car. But as soon as I entered the garage, thehigh-pitched noise cut off. I sat in the garage with the engine running for a fewseconds with the eerie thought, \"Something has just followed me fromBriggsdale to my Littleton home. Now what?\"Right now, no one has a clue about who might be watching Iona Hoeppner orlistening in on our phone calls. During our phone conversation, there was adistinct interruption as if a phone on an extension line had been picked up. Idecided to say good-bye and hung up. Then I called Iona back in a couple ofminutes. There continued to be clicking noises off and on during our lengthyconversation.I asked Iona in that conversation if anyone had seen aerial lights or unusualsounds around the location and time of the September 16, 1980, calf mutilationson the Roland Ball ranch?She said that Tom and Patty Tabor, who live 5 to 7 miles south of Briggsdale,told Iona that on a night somewhere around the time of the mutilations thatMrs. Tabor saw several lights traveling at extreme speed in the night sky. Thelights were close together, not too high and then they were gone.Finally, I was stunned after sending Iona Hoeppner's tissue sample to theSchoenfeld Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico. I called the lab forconfirmation that the tissue was being studied in the lab and was told that thesample arrived, but \"disappeared and no searches had turned up\" IonaHoeppner's carefully wrapped package of a sample that would have proved theexcision separated cells without cell wall destruction.
