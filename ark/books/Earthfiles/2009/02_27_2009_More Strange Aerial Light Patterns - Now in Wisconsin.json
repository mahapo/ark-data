(Elmwood is top red circle on map north of Plum City red circle).Return to Reno, Nevada, and Empire, Ohio 2-part Earthfiles February 27, 2009 Elmwood, Wisconsin - On January 29, 2009, I filed a 2-partEarthfiles report about more mysterious multi-colored aerial light patterns photographedover Reno, Nevada, and Empire, Ohio. A week later, I received an email from a retiredWisconsin businessman who has asked me to call him “John Smith” in order to protect hisfamily. Their home is in rural Elmwood, Wisconsin, about an hour southeast of theMinneapolis/St. Paul twin cities. Elmwood is linked to a UFO flap in the mid-1970s andthe town of 800 people now celebrates “UFO Days” each year during the last weekend ofJuly. His February 7, 2009, email to me said:1) Subject: Strange light patterns in our Wisconsin sky.Date: February 7, 2009To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“Recently I've seen photos and reports of lights in the sky in Reno and Ohioon your Earthfiles.com website. We have been seeing similar lights in oureastern sky.“We had a house guest in mid-November 2008, and we were hanging out lateat night. Our home has large windows facing east and southeast. We noticed"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"this bright light in the eastern sky, which we thought was a plane at first.There are many planes that go over our home as we are on the flight path forthe Minneapolis/St. Paul International airport. We kept watching it andrealized it did not move like a plane. It had colored lights that kept shiftingcolors. We watched it for a couple of hours that night.The next night it was still there and we watched it some more. Unfortunately,that night we didn't think to take pictures or look at it through our telescope.But we have seen it on several other nights since. On February 5th, my wifegot the camera and took the first picture off our deck (below). We are locatedbetween Elmwood and Plum City, Wisconsin, in Pierce County. Over theyears, our area has had a great deal of UFO activity.”February 5, 2008, digital frame of “wishbone” patternprojected by bright light that appeared to the east of the SmithElmswood, Wisconsin, home, beginning in mid-November 2008,and re-appearing occasionally through February 15, 2009.John Smith slightly enlarged image.The most famous Elmwood, Wisconsin, UFO event occurred April 22, 1976, at 11 PM,when Elmwood relief policeman George Wheeler radioed the sheriff's office that he waswatching a large, silvery lens-shaped object with an orange, glowing top. The aerial discwas about 100 feet above ground and some 500 feet distant. A strange black hose washanging from the aircraft. Wheeler radioed the sheriff's dispatcher, “My God, it's anotherone of these UFOs or spacecraft,” referring to other 1975 to 1976 UFO reports in theElmwood region. Wheeler said he could see six bluish-white lights in windows or portholeson the side of the large, round aircraft, and shadows were moving at the windows as ifsomeone were inside.According to a report by the Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization, “suddenly theobject started to rise straight up at extremely high speed and there was a bluish flash.Wheeler's headlights and radio went dead.” Policeman Wheeler also lost consciousness.Upon waking up, he said a light beam had “hit” him in his chest. When his police car waslater inspected, all of the electrical components and plugs were burned out. Afterward,Policeman George Wheeler was hospitalized twice for severe headaches and eventuallydied six months later.The Smith's Elmwood residence is surrounded by acres of trees and they both take lots ofscenery photographs on a regular basis. In fact, they bought a new digital camera inNovember 2008, that has a good image-stabilization for the telephoto to keep handheldphotographs steady.Then on February 14, 2009, John Smith took 91 images of the mysterious light that hadrepeatedly showed up in the same place east of his house since November 2008. Iinterviewed him and asked if he could do another series with his camera mounted on atripod. The next night on February 15, he shot more photographs with his camera on atripod.

So, we're used to planes all the time. [That night in mid-November2008] we watched the sucker and it just did not move like a plane and then one of themnoticed, ‘Look, it's changing colors!’ So they kept watching it for a couple of hours and theobject kept changing, cycling through these bright colors and kind of - I don't know. Itlooks like it kind of undulates up there and it flashes. So, it was doing that and then wewatched it for awhile the next night. It was still there.We've watched it off and on since then, but when my wife took the camera out on thedeck and took a picture of it on February 5, 2009, I looked at it and had seen stuff like iton your Earthfiles.com website about Stephenville and Reno and Ohio and all that and itlooked so similar to me. I thought, ‘Gee, this is something!’ I got to talking with my wifeand said, ‘You know, we really ought to get a picture.’ That's when she went out andsnapped that first photo that I sent you a copy.THAT LOOKS LIKE A WISHBONE.Yeah. It's very strange the shapes that it goes in, and you can be sitting there with yourcamera trained on it and it just blinks off and disappears. It will stay gone for a bit and thenit comes back. It's very strange! (laughs)RIGHT, AND WHAT KIND OF DISCUSSIONS HAVE YOU HAD ABOUT THIS WITHYOUR ASTRONOMY FRIENDS?Well, I haven't had too many, although I found that even though some people are tunedinto the unusual, their first response is to figure out why it is not what it is! (laughs) And inmy particular case, all I can do is and say I can either believe or I disbelieve."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"FROM SOMETHING OTHER THAN EARTH?Well, you know, I don't know. I don't know if it's from Earth. I don't know where it's from.I don't know if it's our people doing something or if it's ... I just don't know. But at thesame time, I'm not a disbeliever either. I'd like to suspend judgment and just watch andlearn. That's kind of the tact I have taken. (laughs)YOUR EMAIL SAYS YOU WATCHED ONE OF THESE LIGHTS FOR TWO HOURS.Oh, yeah! The photographs I sent you from last night (February 14, 2009), they started outand the sun isn't even totally down yet - it was twilight. You can see blue sky in some ofthe images. And the last pictures I took were probably 9:30 PM to 10:00 PM at night, sowhat that means is that it went on from 6 PM to 9:30 PM or quarter until 10:00 PM. Strange Aerial Light Appears in Same Place,But Moves Westerly“Then it moves what looks to me like sort of a westerly direction,like it kind of mimics the movement of the stars and planets.”ON FEBRUARY 14, 2009, WITHOUT THE LIGHT MOVING ITS POSITION IN THESKY?It does move its position. It always appears at about the same spot. When it appeared inNovember, it was in the same spot and when it comes now, it's almost in exactly the samespot in relationship to - we have a big spruce tree out at the end of our driveway. And thelight comes just off of that spruce tree. Then it moves what looks to me like sort of awesterly direction, like it kind of mimics the movement of the stars and planets. But theone thing that it does not do - that they do - is when the Earth's inclination changes, thestars and planets positions are different in the sky. This thing is always in the same place.This thing is very bright when it's active. I try to frame it in the middle of the frame andtake a picture. The camera has a very good image-stabilization for the telephoto part of it.The one big photograph I sent you today (February 15, 2009) has got trees and stuff in theforeground and you can see that they are defined. They are not shaky or anything like that.We just bought the camera in November 2008. It takes beautiful pictures. We take a lot ofpictures, between my wife and me. We live in the country, you know? We live on a60-acre tree farm and there are just lots of beautiful things to take pictures of.HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF THE SQUIGGLE PATTERNS ON ANY OTHER IMAGES?No. I used to be a photographer. I sold high-end photography equipment when I was a kidin Palm Beach, Florida. So, I'm pretty comfortable and familiar around cameras andphotography.HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE SQUIGGLE, MULTI-COLORED, 3-DIMENSIONALPATTERN EVER BEFORE IN YOUR LIFE?Not that I'm aware of, other than those I've seen in the photographs at your Earthfiles.comwebsite.SO, YOU WOULD AGREE WITH THE PEOPLE FROM STEPHENVILLE, TEXAS;KOKOMO, INDIANA; EMPIRE, OHIO; RENO, NEVADA - THAT THERE ISSOMETHING HIGHLY UNUSUAL THAT IS A NEW PHENOMENON IN THE SKYPROJECTING THESE STRANGE, CHANGING PATTERNS THAT LOOK ALMOSTLIKE MULTIPLE COLORED BEADS?Yes, yes, no question about it. I sent a bunch of the photographs out to a friend inCalifornia, who is very interested in some of the phenomena that has been happening outthere. And he has looked at my photographs and tried to analyze them every which wayand he just writes back and says, 'You've certainly got something going on there!' (Laughs)YES, AND IT DOES NOT END.No, it doesn't seem to. If it is not our people, I hope they (non-humans) are here to help usbecause we could sure use a bit of it. Terrestrial Phenomenon? Or Not?"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"IF THIS WERE A TERRESTRIAL PHENOMENON THAT WAS MILITARY OR OTHER- I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE CORPORATIONS - WHAT IN THE WORLD WOULD ITBE THAT IN ALL OF THESE VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS, IT ISPROJECTING 3-DIMENSIONAL, MULTI-COLORED PATTERNS IN THE SKY FORTWO OR THREE HOURS?Right. It's hard to understand and wrap your head around that, isn't it?BECAUSE WHAT WOULD BE THE PURPOSE?Yeah.WOULD THERE BE ANY PURPOSE YOU COULD SPECULATE?Not that I can think of. (Laughs)AND THE HIGH STRANGENESS OF THE PROJECTED MULTI-COLOREDPATTERNS IN SO MANY DISPARATE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS WOULD EVENSUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME KIND OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMTHAT WE DON'T UNDERSTAND.Right. Some of those pictures, I was taking the photographs as fast as I could recycle thecamera.WHICH WOULD BE HOW FAST?Well, I've got a 4 gigabyte card in there and it's not the fastest card, but it's the secondfastest. But at 10.1 megapixel, by the time the software does its thing and saves the imageto the card, there is maybe only two or three seconds in between some of the images. So,then you take a picture and look from frame to frame and they are totally differentconfigurations. It's amazing! The thing shrinks and it expands and it turns smoky and wispyand it tightens up and goes into little pieces - it's just fascinating!” I talked with John Smith On February 26, 2009. He told me that on February 15, after hemounted his camera on the tripod and started trying to take photographs, as soon as hefocused on the bright, multi-colored light to the east of his house, the light would blink out.He waited a couple of minutes and then the colorful light would pop back into the sky. Hefocused his camera mounted on the tripod again and at the moment he was ready to clickthe shutter, the colorful light would blink out again. This happened so many times that Mr.Smith said felt like the colorful, changing light was totally aware of what he was doing withthe camera.That’s exactly what Sarah, the security guard in Empire, Ohio, told me about her efforts onJanuary 3, 2009, to photograph a similar, multicolored bright light in the sky that RobertMaxwell photographed making the multi-colored squiggly patterns.
