It’s a brand new fungus neverseen before. Bats are mammals and mammals have never been destroyed by a fungus likethis before either.But at least one million of the cave-dwelling creatures - that fly through the air eating theirweight in insects every night - have died since February 2007. The mysterious deaths arecalled the “white-nose syndrome” (WNS) because the dead bats have white rings offungus around their noses, on their ears and faces. Yet, many bat experts are notconvinced that the new fungus is the cause of the bat deaths; the fungus might be anopportunist on bats weakened by something else – very similar to the mysterious ColonyCollapse Disorder killing off honey bees.By May 2009, scientists came together in Austin, Texas, for a meeting hosted by BatConservation International. I have talked with several scientists who were there and thebottom line is: the white-nose syndrome is spreading much faster than expected and noone yet knows how to stop it. Since the first cases in New York State two years ago, theGeomyces destructans fungus has been confirmed in nine states:Ve r m o n t1.New Hampshire2.Massachusetts3.Connecticut4.New York5.Pennsylvania6.New Jersey7.Vir gin ia8.West Virginia9.Map presented at June 4, 2009, joint House oversight hearing of Subcommitteeon National Parks, Forests and Public Lands and the Subcommittee on Insular Affairs,Oceans and Wildlife of the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources to show bat deathshave expanded from New York in February 2007 to now include nine states, withKentucky (lower left) probably next. Hearing entitled: “White-Nose Syndrome: What's KillingBats in the Northeast?” Map by Cal Butchkoski, Bat Conservation and Management, Inc.The loss of a million bats means that 700 tons of insects are free on the landscape, uneatenby those million, dead bats. All those insects will eat more crops and cause farmers tospray even more dangerous pesticides that ironically might be the major problem in boththe bat die-off and honey bee disappearances.As the bat deaths spread, scientists are calling this an urgent emergency in which at leastsix species of bats could end up extinct if the white-nose syndrome is not stopped. Finally,Congress is paying attention. On Thursday, June 4, 2009, the Subcommittee on NationalParks, Forests and Public Lands and the Subcommittee on Insular Affairs, Oceans and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Wildlife of the U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources held a joint oversight hearingentitled: “White-Nose Syndrome: What's Killing Bats in the Northeast?”One of the bat experts who testified before Congress was Thomas H. Kunz, Ph.D.,Prof. of Biology and Director of the Center for Ecology and Conservation Biology, BostonUniversity in Boston, Massachusetts. Recently I asked Prof. Kunz about the rapid spreadof white-nose syndrome (WNS) and what other states might be next?Interview:Thomas H. Kunz, Ph.D., Prof. of Biology and Director, Center for Ecology andConservation Biology, Boston University, Dept. of Biology, Boston, Massachusetts: “If white-nose syndrome continues to spread at the rate that it has in the last few years –we’re talking about a 200 mile spread a year. There is nothing in the historic written recordthat suggests this has occurred anywhere in the world before, so it’s a very devastatingcondition. This bat die-off is unprecedented and this precipitous decline we have seen isprobably the greatest loss of wildlife in North America in at least a century.IF THIS HAS SPREAD IN THE PAST YEAR INTO VIRGINIA AND WEST VIRGINIA,WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT IT WILL SPREAD INTO KENTUCKY, MISSOURI,OHIO – THOSE STATES ARE BORDERING THE WESTERN ENDS OF VIRGINIA.That’s correct, and the rate at which it has been moving the last three years, especially thelast year, I would say it’s almost guaranteed that we it will be spread into at least Kentuckyand Tennessee and perhaps into Missouri and Arkansas in places where some of the largestknown number of hibernating species of hibernating bats occur in the world.IF THAT HAPPENS, KNOWING THAT WE’VE LOST AT LEAST A MILLION BATSSO FAR AND IF THIS SPREAD INTO MISSOURI, KENTUCKY AND OHIO, WHATARE THE IMPLICATIONS FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW?Well, they are devastating! Without these bats, this can have a devastating affect onagricultural crops and on gardens and forest trees because these bats feed on the aerialinsects that lay eggs on various kinds of plants in which the eggs hatch out into larvae thatthen feed on the foliage. One Million Bat Deaths Means700 Tons of Insects Not EatenIN ONLY A YEAR TO 18 MONTHS, WE HAVE LOST AT LEAST A MILLION BATSAND THAT’S EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT 700 TONS OF INSECTS. THE WHITE-NOSESYNDROME CONTINUES TO SPREAD WESTWARD - PERHAPS NEXT INTOKENTUCKY. IF THE NUMBER OF BAT DEATHS REACHED AROUND 4 MILLION,WOULD THERE BE SUCH A HUGE SPIKE IN INSECTS THAT WE WOULD SEEMORE INSECTS AROUND US?That is correct. We’ll see more insects around us and we’ll see more damage to plants onwhich the insects tend to feed. With fewer bats, we are going to see more insects.

PROF. KUNZ, WITH THE WHITE NOSE SYNDROME NOW IN 9 STATESCONFIRMED AND WITH THE FEAR IT COULD SPREAD INTO THE MID-WESTTHIS YEAR, WHAT IS YOUR ESTIMATE ABOUT HOW MANY BATS HAVE DIED SOFAR AND HOW BAD COULD IT GET?Well, our best estimate right now in the Northeast in the last three years since it’s beenobserved, we’ve estimated at least 1 million bats have died. This is based on directobservations of bats inside caves. Just to give you an example, some of the caves up inupstate New York and in Vermont this last year, many of us who visited these sites andwalked into these caves, you could not find a place on the floor of the cave where youcould put your foot without stepping on a dead bat. Literally tens of thousands of batshave died in some of these major large hibernacula.THAT’S ABOUT 95% TO 100% MORTALITY?Yes, in those sites, it’s 95% to 100%."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Prof. Kunz provided the above images to show what a cave with 100% deathsof Little Brown Bats looks like and there is evidence of bats dead in the snowindicating the creatures woke up and tried to leave the cave.

Image © 2007 by Alan Hicks.EVEN BATS THAT HAVE SURVIVED THE WINTER AND GOTTEN OUTDOORS ARESTILL SICK AND NOT THRIVING?That’s right. There are two reasons for that. One of the problems in wintertime is these(sick) bats are rousing in mid-winter without any fat left, basically getting back to thequestion of what do we know? We know they run out of fat reserves that they put onduring the fall of the year. The bats aren’t going to add anything to those fat reservesbecause there is nothing to eat during the winter. But the sick bats are sometimes arousingin mid-winter and going out and flying around when there is still snow on the ground andit’s cold outside, it’s freezing. And some of these bats end up with damage to their veryfragile wing membranes. There is frostbite. There is also the white fungus that is attackingthe wing membranes.What we see of the bats returning to the maternity colonies in the spring, at least thosewho survived, many of them have damaged wings. They have scarred and necrotic wings;that is, the tissue is basically dying and sloughing off. Because the wings are really thelifeblood of bats. And we’re finding bats at the summer colonies that have badly damagedwings.In my knowledge, this rapidly expanding bat die-off is the most devastating andprecipitous decline that we’ve ever seen in North American wildlife.The fungus, Geomyces destructans, looks like white powder on the very thin wingof an infected bat in February 2008. Image © 2008 by Craig W. Stihler,Ph.D., West Virginia Dept. of Natural Resources. Fungi Not Known Beforeto Decimate MammalsI CAN’T FIND ANY OTHER EXAMPLE KNOWN WHERE FUNGI WOULD TAKEOVER AND DECIMATE MAMMALS.That’s correct. This is part of what we don’t know right now. Obviously, the fungus isassociated and that’s why it is called white nosed syndrome. There is no proof yet that thisfungus is the killer, actually killing the bats.There is no evidence that any fungus kills mammals. We know there are a lot of fungi thatdo affect humans, from athlete’s feet to ringworm and so on. These are fungi and theycause skin irritation. What we do know is that fungi grow on dead, organic matter in dark,moist places. [ Editor’s Note: Bats hibernate when temperatures are between 5 to 14degrees Celsius/41 degrees to 57.2 degrees Fahrenheit, which is also the temperature rangein which the new Geomyces destructans fungus thrives. ] New Fungus Geomyces destructansAttacks Bat Wings and Dermis"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"But we also know that this particular fungus Geomyces destructans is a new species thatwas not known before the first bat deaths in New York caves in December 2006 toFebruary 2007. This particular fungus on bats – the histopathological studies show thefungus does invade the dermis, the living part of the skin. Epidermis is dead cells; thedermis is alive where vascularity and blood are. This fungus invades the dermis by enteringthrough the hair follicles and the sebaceous glands, the skin glands.The preliminary studies that have been done on the genome, the genetic characteristics ofthis particular fungus, wherever it has been tested and examined from caves throughoutthe Northeast, they are all the same. From every cave and mine that has been sampled, thefungus is genetically identical, which indicates and suggests that this is a recentintroduction, or recently evolved. It could be a condition introduced either by humans orperhaps by other bats from some other place. We don’t have any evidence it’s the bats. Geomyces destructans FungusAppears “Cloned” Cave to CaveYOU’RE SAYING THAT THIS NEW FUNGUS IS SO IDENTICAL THAT IT ALMOSTLOOKS CLONED IN ALL THE INFECTED CAVES?That’s right.WHERE DO YOU THINK IT MOST LIKELY CAME FROM?We know that the fungus is transmitted or transferred from place-to-place by fungalspores. Spores can be carried on the fur of bats. It can be carried on the shoes and clothingof a human that might visit some of these caves. And it can also be transmitted through theair because spores can be transported through the air. Those are all three options abouthow this is being transmitted.Based on the fact that bats fly and the spread of it has occurred to so rapidly to such awide range of caves, it is unlikely that humans would be the only mechanism by which it istransmitted.BUT WHY WOULD A FUNGUS THAT NO ONE HAS SEEN BEFORE IN NORTHAMERICA SUDDENLY BE SO LETHAL TO ANCIENT BATS?Because there is no resistance. These bats from Europe and North America have beenseparated by millions of years. One hypothesis is that the bats that have a fungus growingon them in Europe (but not dying) might be the remnants of a much larger population. Andthis is what we would predict here in the U. S. There are going to be survivors, but thesurvivors are going to be just remnants of the original population that is being killed.Right now, there are investigators in Europe comparing the genetic characteristics from batfungus there to what is being observed here in North America.BUT THE BATS IN EUROPE DID NOT DIE AT 95% TO 100% IN CAVES AS HASHAPPENED IN THE UNITED STATES?That is correct. But again, that might be because the bat colonies in Europe are muchsmaller. Historically, they might have been much larger. We just don’t know that. It couldhave been thousands of years ago that this fungus crash could have occurred and the onesthat are still carrying the fungus might be the survivors that over time have developedresistance to the fungus.There are several areas of research we are trying to do. One is looking at the immunesystem of the white nose syndrome infected bats. The immune system of bats is not wellunderstood. There are some studies going on in my lab. There are some going on atBucknell University in DeeAnn Reeder’s lab. [ See 022609 Earthfiles. ] There are alsosome places in Europe that are looking at the immune system of the bats there. So, wedon’t have an answer yet. Bats Have Very Low Reproductive Rates,So Extinctions of Some Species Possibleand Recovery of Others Will Take DecadesIS IT TRUE THAT IF THE SIX SPECIES OF BATS CONTINUE TO DIE THAT EVEN IF"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"SCIENCE CAN GET A HANDLE ON STOPPING THE WHITE NOSE FUNGUS, ITTAKES A LONG TIME FOR BATS TO RECOVER?It takes an enormous time for bats to recover, largely because they have very lowreproductive rates. Most species of those 6 species I’ve talked about – 4 of them produceone baby per year. Two species produce two babies per year, although only one survives toweaning. So the bat reproductive rates are very low and their recovery time would takehundreds of generations to return to a current population today.DO YOU THINK THAT MEANS SOME OF THE ENDANGERED BATS COULD GOEXTINCT?Yes, I really think the Indiana Bat is at great risk. They have only a few major hibernacula,about eleven major hibernacula. There are some smaller ones, but these occur in Indiana,some of Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Tennessee and Missouri. Those are the majorhibernacula where this particular Grey Bat species exists.There are other species beyond the Midwest, as you go into Oklahoma and Texas andKansas. There are major hibernating colonies such as the Cave Bat. This is another bat thatmight be at risk in the next four to five years.In the far West, there are not many species that form large colonies. Most of them aredifferent species that tend to form smaller colonies, so I would not predict the spread tooccur in the West at as rapid a rate as it has in the East, if it does spread there at all. Bat Hibernation Environments:Could White-Nose Syndrome Spread to the West?One thing we have to think about, too, is the environment in which bats hibernate. I gavethe range of temperatures we know the white nose fungus tends to grow optimally,between 5 and 14 degrees Celsius. So, as you move into the deep South, there certainly arebats that hibernate for short periods of time – winter in Louisiana and Alabama is not aslong as it is here in the Northeast or even in the Midwest. But these are still – the potentialfor the fungus to survive even short periods of time for a month or so is very possible.SO, PROF. KUNZ, DO YOU MEAN THAT THE WHITE-NOSE FUNGUS SYNDROMECOULD GO ALL THE WAY FROM THE EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES,EXTEND INTO THE MIDWEST AND SOUTH AND ALL THE WAY TO THE ROCKYMOUNTAINS?Yes, it could. Part of the reason it could is that at least the hypothesized mode oftransmission – this is another unknown – to what extend the fungus is transmitted by bats?And to what extent is the fungus transmitted by humans? And transmitted by air? Wesuspect all three routes, but it’s probably not equal how it’s transmitted from one area toanother. Is the Geomyces destructans Fungus the Killer?Or Opportunist Upon Another Bat Problem?Inadequate supply of poly-unsaturated fatty acidsin the bats fall diets could be linked to chemicalpesticides killing off specific insects needed forquality fat content before hibernation.SINCE A FUNGUS HAS NOT BEEN KNOWN TO KILL MAMMALS BEFORE IN THEPAST LIKE THIS, DO YOU SPECULATE ABOUT WHAT IT IS IN THIS PARTICULARBRAND NEW FUNGUS THAT IS ABLE TO KILL BATS SO QUICKLY?We’re not certain that the fungus is actually killing the bats directly. It’s certainly irritatingthe bats. We suspect that is occurring. And the deaths might be a consequence of losingtheir body fat by mid-winter; thus, the bats are not able to arouse, or they die before theyare able to arouse. Or the bats fly outside in mid-winter and freeze.So, I wouldn’t yet state that the fungus is killing. That’s something we don’t know. Weknow the fungus is associated with the bats that are dying. And going back to thehypotheses of what is causing the loss of body fat, it could be the irritation (by fungusunder dermis) that causes arousal, or it could be the inadequate supply of poly-unsaturatedfatty acids in the diet in the fall."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Could Bats Be Vaccinated Against the Fungus?The more realistic, although daunting task of stopping this, might require the developmentof a vaccine against the fungus. Although one could ask, ‘How could you possiblyvaccinate millions of bats?’ You might not be able to vaccinate all of them, but you mightbe able to vaccinate many more that would be able to survive and reproduce versus thosethat are going to die without any kind of vaccine.The vaccine, if it could be developed, and we know that vaccines against fungi have beendeveloped for other animals and humans. This would most likely involve an injection.You’d have to handle thousands of bats during the active season. Typically, it wouldhappen during what is called the fall swarming period where you would mount a majoreffort of wildlife biologists going and trapping bats as they enter these swarming sites,injecting them with an appropriate dose of vaccine that at least on a single dose be able tokill the fungus.So, there are a lot of uncertainties in all of this, but I think the vaccine approach probablyhas the least difficulties in accomplishing a slowing down the number of fatalities youwould expect to see over the next five years.BUT PROF. KUNZ, HAS THERE EVER BEEN A VACCINATION PROGRAM BYHUMANS TRYING TO VACCINATE SO MANY CREATURES?No. There have been efforts to vaccinate wildlife, for example, against rabies and that hasbeen done in many parts of the world where the way that vaccine is administered isthrough the food; that is, putting vaccines in food for carnivores or scavengers oromnivores like raccoons and foxes. Rabies has been reduced considerably as aconsequence of using a vaccine that can be administered orally. So, there is a history there,but not in the case of bats. And there is no evidence that we can even develop the vaccine. Vicious Cycle: We Need Bats to Control Insects,But Human-Applied Pesticides Could Be Killingthe Insects the Bats Need to SurviveHOW STRANGE IT IS TO REALIZE IS THAT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOUSCIENTISTS ARE LOOKING AT IS WHAT IMPACT DO PESTICIDES HAVE ONINSECTS THAT COULD AFFECT THE FOOD OF BATS THAT ARE NOW DYING INGIGANTIC NUMBERS FROM AN UNKNOWN FUNGUS AND THAT IT MIGHT ALLCIRCLE BACK TO THE PESTICIDES KILLING INSECTS THAT BATS NEED TOSURVIVE AND THAT HUMANS DEPEND ON THE BATS TO CONTROL?Absolutely! I have to say I agree with you completely. It’s a very unbalanced world whenyou have to apply pesticides to kill insects that would provide food for bats. The problemis that the pesticides are not specific to any one kind of insect, so you’ve got a broadbandpesticide that ends up killing lots of prey (the bats) that would normally be eating a lot ofthe insects.CAN YOU IMAGINE A PLANET WITHOUT BATS?Personally, no. Professionally, no. Economically, no. This is an urgent issue. It needs to beaddressed sooner than later. It’s already been three years and we have very little fundingfrom the federal government. There has been some, but not very much. The bulk of theresearch has been by private sources; that is, non-government organizations and BatConservation International and the National Speleological Society. If it had not been forthose two organizations, we would still be sitting here waiting to answer some of thequestions we’ve been able to work on.Unfortunately, when this whole thing hit us here in the Northeast, no one was prepared forit. No one was prepared – not only we didn’t have the science behind it to really knowhow many bats we were dealing with. We still don’t know much about the insects. Wedon’t know much about the pesticides that are being used. We did not know very much.What little we do know was funded largely by private sources and non-governmentorganizations.BOTTOM LINE: WITH, OR WITHOUT, MORE RESEARCH FUNDING, THEEXPECTATION IS THAT THE WHITE NOSE FUNGUS SYNDROME WILLCONTINUE TO SPREAD AT LEAST FOR ANOTHER 12 MONTHS."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"That is correct. Since 2006, Bats Began Dying,Bees Began Disappearing and AmphibiansHave Also Been Killed by A FungusFINALLY, IN THE BIG PICTURE, WHAT IS YOUR OWN PERSONAL OPINIONABOUT THE FACT THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME ON RECORD, BATS ARE DYINGFROM A FUNGUS THAT NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN BEFORE? SIMULTANEOUSLY,COLONLY COLLAPSE DISORDER IN HONEY BEES AND POLLINATORS HASBEEN ONGOING AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME PERIOD FROM THE FALL OF 2006TO NOW. THE CHYTRID FUNGUS HAS BEEN ATTACKING AMPHIBIANS. WHENYOU LOOK AT ALL THREE OF THOSE HAPPENING AT THE SAME TIME, WHEREDOES YOUR MIND GO AS A SCIENTIST ABOUT WHAT ELSE IS WRONG IN THEPLANET THAT IS CAUSING ALL OF THIS?Well, you can add birds to this as well. The decline of the aerial-feeding birds. It isdevastating to know that we are losing large numbers of species of frogs from the chytridfungus, to bees to bats. That should be sending a signal – not only to our governmentofficials who have to make decisions about funding to address these issues, but it shouldsend a message to the public that our environment is drastically being altered and these arethe sentinel animals. The little animals are the ones most affected by whatever – if it’s acontaminant or whether it’s a pathogen or whether it’s an invasive species. We’re nottalking about one species. We’re talking about many species and the cascade effect that allthis mortality has on our ecosystems should say to us that we humans are next! We are notimmune to these kinds of conditions. We’ve already seen this in humans in many ways –conditions that cause asthma and diseases of various sorts – neurological diseases – thepresence of mercury in the environment – and acidification of lakes affects the localeconomies in terms of the fishing industry and recreational industry. So, there are cascadeeffects here that go far beyond loss of animals.But as someone who is a biologist and who has a deep passion for animals and plants andall life, we need to do everything that we can to protect and to conserve what we have andto minimize losses that would ultimately have affects on human life.BECAUSE WE’RE ALL LIVING ON THIS PLANET TOGETHER.We all live on this planet together and I think these are wake up calls! It’s unfortunate thatwake-up calls come a bit late here. What Happens Next in Congressabout the Unprecedented Bat Die-Off?WHAT DID YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES PROPOSE TO THE JOINT HOUSESUBCOMMITTEES THAT COULD NEXT BE DONE MAYBE TO GET ON TOP OFTHIS SITUATION?We need more money to really answer the question: Is the fungus a true pathogen? Is itkilling the bats? If it is, how do you stop this fungus? How do you reduce or stop itsspread?WHAT HAPPENS NEXT WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEES IN THE HOUSE? IS ITGOING TO EXPAND TO THE SENATE? WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO BE THE NEXTSTEPS COMING OUT OF THE HEARING?Those of us who testified have been asked to follow up our testimony with additionalinformation we might have in the next 30 days. We’ve been asked to revise our budget,which will expand from what we originally proposed, largely because that budget wasbased on how to deal with the white nose in the existing range and not projecting out towhere it could be.YOU MEAN KENTUCKY, OKLAHOMA AND BEYOND?Right. We don’t have a budget for that at this point, but we’ll have a budget in anotherweek or so that will probably double $17 million. We’ll probably be in the $30 millionrange to really get baseline data that is necessary to address what’s happening in the areasnot affected."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"DOES CONGRESS APPEAR TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF YOUR EFFORTS?The two subcommittees, the chairs, were very supportive and acknowledged this is a majorproblem. We expect to have a hearing in the Senate, but it has not been scheduled yet, butSenator Leahy from Vermont is leading this and we expect a Senate hearing within thenext month. What we’re asking for is we can’t wait for another year. We really needresearch funds now. If we wait another year, we lose another year of trying to answerthese questions. So, we’ve asked for not only stimulus money that might still be availablefor research that can be done in the next six to eight months. After that, we go into anotherfiscal year and this is all too urgent to wait.We need urgently to get the federal government and the Congress to get it started. We’regoing to depend upon the Chairs of these two subcommittees to take it further into theDept. of Interior to the Secretary of Interior and then ultimately to hopefully the Presidentwho will sign off on this and money will be released. But as you know, political decisionsare slower than we would like them to be.We’re not going to be able to do anything about the spread in the next year. We’re going towatch it happen. We can monitor it and do some research if we have some funding. But ifwe don’t have any funding, we can’t get started to identify, to do the experiments toclarify and make certain the fungus is the silver bullet. We’re not going to be able to do theresearch that can answer that question. We’re not going to be able to do the research, if itis the fungus, to develop a vaccine. We’re not going to have the funding to do themonitoring at sites that are not affected, but likely will be affected over the year.
