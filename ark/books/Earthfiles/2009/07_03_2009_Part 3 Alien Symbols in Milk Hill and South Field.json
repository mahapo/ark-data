Return to Part 1July 3, 2009 Wiltshire County, England - The following PDF was emailed to me on July1, from a man named Mark in Colorado, who worked in computer signal processing forthirteen years. Mark has studied crop formation patterns with curiosity since 1993. Aboutthe 2009 patterns, he says, “I'm starting to see how they fit together over time and space inthe past and present. So, in the future I think we'll all see more and more links between thepatterns and maybe we'll begin to have more understanding about what is beingcommunicated. And I think the crop circle intelligence will be reacting to our own humanconsciousnesses as we try to see past and present links in the crop formations.”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Return to Part 1For further information about worldwide crop formations, please see Earthfiles Archivedreports (partial list below) and my book, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles, in theEarthfiles Shop.• 04/30/2009 — Part 1: First 2009 U.
