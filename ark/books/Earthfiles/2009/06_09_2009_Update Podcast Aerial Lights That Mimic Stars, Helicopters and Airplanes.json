Rutledge, Ph.D .Update June 26, 2009 / Original report: June 9, 2009 Nashville, Tennessee -Thirty-six years ago in late February through March 1973, residents in Piedmont, Missouri,were captivated by moving, flashing, jumping, zigzagging lights in the sky. Piedmont is 63miles west of Cape Girardeau, where the U. S. government allegedly retrieved a crashedUFO in 1941. [ See 122802 Earthfiles Archive.]Piedmont residents reported TV static and stalled cars on highways after unidentifiedaerial lights flew over. One man reported that he lost his TV signal at the same time hishome lights dimmed and his house shook. He went outside and saw an egg-shaped objecthovering in the air nearby, emitting a high-pitched sound. His dogs ran away to hide.Other Piedmont residents reported seeing lights in the night sky that made erratic turns,flashed lights like airliners, but blinked out when real airliners approached. There wereeven reports of people seeing discs on the ground in fields and glowing objects movingunderwater in nearby Clearwater Lake. Local TV called all of it, “the Piedmont UFO.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Cape Girardeau, Missouri, is 72 miles northwest of Nashville, Tennessee.Piedmont is 63 miles west of Cape Girardeau.Prof. Harley D. Rutledge, Ph.D., who was Chairman of the Physics Department atSoutheast Missouri State University in Cape Girardeau, decided to investigate. Prof.Rutledge organized a team of observers with Questar telescopes, sophisticated frequencymonitoring equipment and cameras. He called his research effort “Project Identification”and later produced a 1981 book about his question: What were the lights in the sky thatseemed to mimic stars, helicopters and airplanes?Prof. Rutledge named part of the phenomenon “pseudostars.” Pseudostars, he said, werelights pretending to be stars camouflaged by familiar constellations of real stars. Butpseudostars moved, and Project Identification caught their stealthy motion in time lapsephotographs. Plate 26.

But what baffled Prof. Rutledge most were lights in the skythat repeatedly seemed to react to the Project Identification people observing the lights.Project Identification: The First Scientific Field Studyof UFO Phenomena © 1981 by Harley D. Rutledge, Ph.D.Now in 2009, about 150 miles southeast of Piedmont in Nashville, Tennessee, on thewestern edge of town, more lights have appeared since October 2008, that also seem tomimic stars, helicopters and airplanes. Retired engineering designer and professional artist,Gary Mansfield, began noticing odd light behavior in October, while looking at the skyfrom the deck of his Bellevue suburban home on the western edge of Nashville. Sincethen, over the past eight months, Gary says he has seen at least fifty aerial objects thatbaffle him and his fiance, Kim, who has been a second eyewitness on many of the lightevents - including February 16, 2009, at 9:40 p.m. Central, a straight line of vivid lightssuddenly appeared in the sky without motion.Interview:“Bar of Lights”February 16, 2009, 9:40 p.m., Central Gary Mansfield, Retired Engineering Designer and Professional Artist, Nashville,Tennessee: “And we stepped out onto the deck when it was dark outside, probablyaround 8:30 to 9 p.m. And she (fiancé Kim) said, ‘Look!’I looked up and saw three brilliant, round lights, maybe five feet in diameter side-by-sidelike they were on a bar. They just turned on. They weren’t even moving, but sort of barelyrotating from a northeasterly position towards the north. And we were looking right upunderneath this thing. The sky was very dark. It was a total pitch black, dark night. Wecouldn’t see any outline of the craft. It was a couple hundred feet above us at a 60-degreeangle. It floated just like a blimp, just barely turning sideways."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"February 16, 2009, at 9:40 p.m. Central, a “bar of lights” seen close to Gary Mansfield'sdeck in western Nashville. Computer illustration © 2009 by Gary Mansfield.Kim asked, ‘Is that an airplane?’I said, ‘No, it’s too close and it’s moving too slow. I’m going for the camera.’ I went inside,got my digital, turned it on, went back outside and the line of lights had barely movedmore than 20 degrees across perpendicular to our deck, just meandering along like a hot airballoon.Then the lights went out. Then they came back on after three, four, five seconds. Thenthey went out again. Then all of a sudden, a red light and a green light – very dim – cameon, like they were on the wing tips of an airplane and they flashed in a sequential methodthat looked like they were being toggled instead of being controlled electronically. It waslike someone was imitating the sequence. They go off. They come back on again. Fortwenty seconds, this thing hung directly over our area before it went out of sight.IT'S AS IF THOSE THREE BRIGHT LIGHTS SEEMED TO COME ON IN RESPONSETO YOUR FIANCE’S NOTICING SOMETHING IN THE SKY AND THEN THEYCAME ON.(Reacting) To our very presence, I believe. “Organic” Spheres Move in Crescent FormationOctober 25 - 26, 2008, Midnight CentralWe moved to this location (on western side of Nashville) in June 2008. Then in October2008, I was standing on the balcony at probably around midnight and saw 25 to 30 low litwhite spheres that had a very low glow to them in a crescent shape, like a string of pearls.They were coming from the west in my direction at about a half-mile away and theyactually flew over my location within 250 to 300 feet. That was a rude awakening becausethey did not look mechanical. They almost looked biological."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"October 25-26, 2008, Midnight Central, twenty-five to thirty, 6-foot-diameter irregularly-shapedspheres that glowed white and moved in a crescent formation over the Bellevue suburb at thewestern edge of Nashville, Tennessee. Computer illustration © 2009 by Gary Mansfield.CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT?Yes, they moved in an excited state against each other. They had a cloud, a vaporouscloud, around them like they were enveloped in this cloud. And they moved 15 to 20 mphand it was like they knew where they were going. This was 6-foot-spheres lined up in acrescent shape.THE COLOR?They were dimly lit from within like a soft white light bulb and as they appeared, my firstimpression was they were biological.WHAT WAS THE CLOSEST THEY GOT TO YOU?I would say within 300 feet.WHY DO YOU THINK YOU HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY WEREBIOLOGICAL?There was no sound. Each of the spheres was irregular in shape – they weren’t perfectlyround. It was like they were maintaining a spherical shape, but somehow had angularedges and corners that seemed to move as they flew by, like there was movement inside asthey were flying through the air. These were individual units flying side-by-side, likebouncing off of each other, vibrating, excited. It was very weird to look at. Mirrored Cigar Rising VerticallyJanuary 9, 2009, 3 PM CentralSoon after that I pursued becoming a MUFON field investigator and have been so sinceFebruary 2009. Prior to that, I witnessed other aerial phenomena. One, in fact, attracted ablack helicopter within five minutes. I don’t know who called it, other than the local radarauthority.

Computer illustration © 2009 by Gary Mansfield.WHAT HAPPENED?It got to a certain point and I reached for my binoculars that I had on the deck and wasbringing them up to my eyes and about the time I got them to my eyes, it started vanishing.It began to disappear slowly like it was losing the integrity of its visual image and fadingout. And I pulled the binoculars up to the location and it was gone, just disappeared.DID YOU HAVE A SENSE THAT IT WAS THE ACT OF REACHING FOR YOURBINOCULARS THAT CAUSED IT TO FADE AWAY?I did since then. I don’t know why, but that’s the only – I don’t know why it would havedone that, but maybe it had something to do with it.WHERE WERE YOU EXACTLY IN THE NASHVILLE AREA WHEN YOU SAW THE25 to 30 ORGANIC-LOOKING LIGHTS A YEAR AGO AND THE MIRROR-SURFACED VERTICAL FUSILAGE ASCENDING AND DISAPPEARING – ARE YOUIN THE SAME APARTMENT AND BALCONY?I am, indeed. Mind you, I have seen at least 50 objects, aerial objects, enigmas over thelast six months. “Airplane” Reverses InstantaneouslyNovember Or December 2008, 8:45 p.m. CentralI had been noticing these flashes of lights periodically in the sky at night, which is what gotme interested all over again in sky watching for things other than stars and planets. Onenight about 8:45 p.m., I believe.WHAT DATE?I’m not sure. It must have been November 2008. It was cold, very cold. Maybe December2008, right at the end of the year. But the light just came on all of a sudden, got bright andthen receded back to its star-like quality and began moving gradually and picking up speedvery rapidly until it was going about as fast as a typical full-throttle passenger plane – Iestimated 450 to 500 mph through the air.I picked up my Q-beam, flashed the rapidly moving light for at least a good two to threeseconds, the light stopped and without missing a hitch, reversed its course in the very exactsame path that it had just come.IT DID NOT TURN. IT LITERALLY WENT IN REVERSE?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"It literally went in reverse at 400 to 500 mph and came right back to the position in frontof me and went out without slowing down. It just turned the lights out.WHAT DID YOU THINK AT THAT MOMENT?I was startled because I’m quite aware of what technology can and cannot do and I knowthat it cannot do that.SO WHAT DID YOU CONCLUDE?I concluded that it responded to me and showed me that it could come back and watch orwhatever. I’m not sure. And I flashed again, but nothing happened from that pointforward. Light Reacts to Gary Mansfield's Q-BeamMay 26, 2009, 4:35 a.m. CentralWE’RE SPEAKING ON JUNE 2, 2009, WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE PAST WEEKTHAT EDDIE CALLED ME ABOUT? [ Eddie Middleton, Night Search Radio, Nashville]This was on May 26, at 4:35 AM. I did an all night vigil, sky watch – had a beautiful, clearnight. A stationary flash of light caught my eye at a 45-degree angle southwest. I turnedmy attention to it and noticed a point of light appear and actually, I flashed it back.WITH WHAT KIND OF FLASH LIGHT?With a high-powered Q-beam light. I had been seeing the same light with the characteristicflash in the same area of the sky several times over the last two weeks. So, I decided to tryto see if I could invoke some interaction with it. And sure enough, it flashed back. Andwhen it did, I noticed another light start moving toward this stationary light. As itapproached it and began to pass it, I flashed it with the light again and it stopped just pastthe stationary object.Now, I have two stationary objects. One is maintaining its lit characteristic and the otherone is not. So, I flashed it again trying to provoke more interaction and the one that wasmoving darted off to the southwest. Then, the other light flashes me back, except the flashlasted a lot longer and I can tell it’s in my direction.Then I actually noticed another brilliant light that appeared off to my northwest. It lit uplike a Roman candle, which was very strange when you have something that is four timesbrighter than Sirius. Then it just faded back to a point of light.Then it started moving across the sky. That chain of events unnerved me somewhat aboutthe reality of the amount of activity that morning. After that, I noticed several morestationary lights light up, almost like a swarm of lightning bugs there for about 45 minutes.WERE YOU LOOKING THROUGH YOUR CAMERA TO ESTIMATE SHAPES ANDSIZE S?Actually, no. I had my binoculars. I did not have my scope set up that night.WHAT DID YOU SEE THROUGH YOUR BINOCULARS?The first one that flashed me, I did look. I thought I saw a black mass in the sky that sort ofmoved in an arc.WHAT DID YOU SEE WHEN YOU AIMED YOUR BINOCULARS AT THE LIGHT?Just a point of brilliant light. It was not diffused; it was a brilliant source of light.SO, YOU ARE TRAINING YOUR BINOCULARS AT THE LIGHT, WHICH IN THEBINOCULARS IS VERY BRILLIANT, AND THEN YOU NOTICED A BLACK MASSMOVING?This was through the binoculars.IT APPEARED LIKE A SECTION OF THE DARK SKY MOVED?No, it was actually darker than the ambient light of the sky.DID THE DARK SECTION THAT MOVED HAVE A SHAPE?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Yes, it looked globular to me.WAS IT CLOSE TO THE BRIGHT LIGHT?Yes, I think it was the source of the light. Disc Followed Delta AirlinerLanding At Nashville AirportMay 31, 2009, 8:30 p.m. CentralWE’RE TALKING ON JUNE 2, 2009. SO, IN THE LAST WEEK, WHAT HAVE YOUSEE N?The most important one, which is the one I submitted to MUFON, began at 8:30 p.m. onMay 31, I began setting my scope up for a night of sky watch. The sky was crystal clearand the temperature was 79 degrees F. I was finishing setting up when my better halfstepped out and she said, ‘Look! A light just came on near that plane.’I looked and saw a commercial airliner had descended its approach from the west and wassome 30 miles out of Nashville International Airport at altitude of maybe 2,500 feet. Thelight she referred to was almost suspended in mid-air as the plane continued past it.I then saw this light slowly accelerate into an arc until it was now flying directly behind theairliner at ¼ mile at nearly the same altitude (of airplane) and at a slower speed. I quicklyturned my scope on the airplane to check focus, which was dead on, and then back to thelight that was following.I could clearly see that the object was grey-black some 20 to 25 feet long, estimated,maybe 1/3rd the airliner cabin depth and had a bright, diffused light underneath it. Thelight did not appear to be a projecting light, but an energy-source light and very brilliantwhite.May 31, 2009, at 8:30 p.m., Delta airliner landing at Nashville International Airport withunidentified aerial disc moving behind the Delta plane projecting bright, diffused lightbeneath it. Computer illustration © 2009 by Gary Mansfield.Another peculiar oddity is that the object appeared to have a clear, gelatin-like shroud orcloud around it. It almost appeared excited as it flew through the air.MEANING?Much like the pearls, the biological thing that I saw, much like it was moving in a – as ifyou were looking through a fluid container and there was wavy motion.THIS WAVY MOTION WITH THAT ORGANIC QUALITY IS ABOUT ¼ MILEBEHIND THE AIRLINER THAT IS LANDING?Yes, ma’am. I have seen this light several times this month. In fact, it might be the sameblack mass light that I saw in the same vector of sky. If so, I have seen it three times in thepast two weeks."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"There were only a couple of bright stars out with the moon at this time of day and therewas still enough sunset (twilight) for me to recognize it as an inbound Delta flight when Ichecked my focus.WHAT HAPPENED?I tracked the object with my telescope at 35X. The object was roughly 1.25 miles awayuntil I lost it at the edge of the building and it continued on out of view. I have no idea, butvery strange it would follow a passenger plane though.DID YOU TRY TO FOLLOW UP WITH DELTA TO SEE IF ANY PILOT HADREPORTED ANY UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT DOING AN ARC TO ITS TAIL?No, not on the plane, I haven’t because I had already called the Nashville AirportAuthority on the first May 26, incident trying to get some radar confirmation on everythingthat happened early in that morning. I finally got in touch with the Control Tower andidentified myself as a field investigator with MUFON. I informed him I was investigating acase and would appreciate his assistance. And he laughed and said that he was going toconsider this call as a prank call and then he proceeded to hang up in my face.ARE YOU SERIOUS?Yes, ma’am, I am dead serious. I was very humiliated at that point that he would not takeme serious.THIS IS VERY INTERESTING TO ME THAT YOU ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO APHENOMENON THAT SEEMS TO BE DISPLAYING ITSELF FOR YOU BECAUSE OFYOUR CONSCIOUSNESS AND WHEN YOU TRY TO GO TO THE VERY PLACESPOST-9/11 THAT SHOULD HAVE GREAT CONCERN ABOUT UNIDENTIFIED ANDMYSTERIOUS OBJECTS BEHIND AIRLINERS, THEY TELL YOU THEY THINK IT’SA PRANK CALL AND HANG UP.(Sighs) Evidently.THINK ABOUT ALL THE IRONY IN THIS POST 9/11.I like to fly, but now that I know there are things that follow airplanes, I’m not sure that Ilike it so much anymore!
