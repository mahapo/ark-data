I have selected a few for this Earthfilesfollow-up, which highlight the global reach of the triangles spanning many years and the intuitivesense by eyewitnesses that the triangles are monitoring them - in one case, even trying tocommunicate by light patterns.See: 052809 Earthfiles, Parts 1 and 2300-foot-long unidentified, silent, aerial craftfirst discovered only 100 or 200 feet above Challis, Idaho,camp trailer on September 27, 2000.

K., February 1997Subject: TRIANGULAR CRAFTDate: May 30, 2009To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comThe triangular picture of some type of craft you have, Well I'd like topoint out that me and my partner seen one exactly the same, but was backin February of 1997. We used to live near Hereford (Leominster) andvisited my girlfriend's parents for the weekend down in South Wales.When we left south wales to come home it was around 10:30 p.m. Whenwe approached a place called the Brecon Beacons (Story Arms Hotel), Iwas driving along, trying to light a cigarette, but the flint onthe lighter was not sparking. So instead of asking my girlfriend to tryto light the cigarette, I pulled the car into a lay-by. As I leanedforwards to light my cigarette, a tiny light caught the corner of my eyeand as I turned my head to see what this light was (the light was comingfrom the sky), I opened my car door and got out and looked up.I saw this triangular object roughly 300 feet in size with a light on each corner ofthe triangle and a light coming from the center of the craft. It nevermade any noise whatsoever. Also, it never moved at all. I shouted to mygirlfriend to get out of the car and come and have a look at this. Shejumped out of the car and looked up and also seen the same thing.But what is really strange is that I've been into the UFO phenomena foryears. When I did get around to seeing something out of the ordinary, Ijust got back in my car and drove off without waiting to see what thecraft did!There are 2 mountains either side of each other. I've attached a drawing of what itlooked like, but I'm not very good at art, so please excuse the art work. I haven't toldmany people about this - only close family and some close friends. Thought I wouldshare my experience with you after listening to you on Coast 2 Coast AM.

I listened to the amazing story that Mr.Bales told about his sighting and it brought me back to a night in December 2002, inWest Virginia.I had something very similar happen on Dec. 08, 2002 and decided to write to youto fill in a few details that I experienced. I have been a software engineer for manyyears, I am well educated and I think people consider me down to earth.The larger triangle from Idaho may have been more of a mother ship, and the objectI saw more of a smaller scout vessel, but even so it was very large and totally silent.I got the impression it was gathering information, maybe mapping the terrain by howslow it was flying. I have no idea why it was over a country town and civilianairspace.At first, I thought it was very likely that we, Mr. Bales and I, had seen the sametriangle ship, but the one that I saw did not seem to be as large. I originally estimatedthe object to be about 60 to 100 feet long based on the landmarks I could see,houses, the road, etc., and was a couple of stories high. It was difficult to judgebecause it was above me and slightly to my 10:00 p. m. position, but it was muchlarger than my house. I also noticed by the glow of the streetlight that it had a very“domed” nose, not the sharp points that you see in some of the drawings. Triangle Flashing Lightsto Communicate with Eyewitness?What was different about my sighting was that the object seemed to be trying tocommunicate with me for several minutes. Unfortunately, I was not carrying a flashlight as I was planning to only be out of my house for a few minutes while the dogswent.Right from the moment I saw the object floating over the trees, it was flashing largeround white strobe lights and it seemed to me that it was calling attention to itself, ortrying to get my attention. I was out walking my dogs and it was a very dark nightwith no moon. There was nobody else outside until it flew over my neighbor’s houseand it set off his truck’s car alarm. I have no doubt whatsoever that it knew I wasthere and was looking at it.It came flying very low and slow over the top of my trees, perhaps between 100 to200 feet high. It stopped and hovered above me. It had lights on all the tips, the topand the bottom, and 4 large red diamonds in the rear. Each diamond had a structure"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"inside them that I can only compare to a honeycomb – but It looked “alien,” hard toexplain. When it stopped above me, it turned off its large round strobe lights andturned on smaller white lights that played out a very specific sequential pattern. Itseemed like it was letting me know it saw me and wanted to communicate that itwas under intelligent control. I received this message clearly.The pattern was mathematical – it would flash two lights on top, then a light on thefront, then the light on top again, then the light on the sides. It went through thispattern several times until it had used every combination of lights I could see andthen played a kind of “grand finale” with all the lights flashing rapidly like some biglighting display. Dogs Did Not React, As the MulesDid Not React in Challis, IdahoI stood in awe and watched it in awe for at least 5 minutes, and at no time did mydogs react or move a muscle. My beagle was off of her leash in the large yard,which had leaves on theground and she didn’t even wander one step. This was strange behavior for them. Irealized later that I hardly moved a muscle either, just stood transfixed, jawprobably hanging openuntil I turned my back on it for 30 seconds. Then it was gone. But I watched it flyaway. I got a real good look at it from the rear and that is how I knew it was atriangle/diamond with a raised rear section. These red diamonds seemed to indicatethe engine in operation; it only used two of them to fly off – the ones on the rightand left. The upper and lower diamonds remained turned off or not lit.I immediately called my family and my friends and really drove them crazy with thiswhen it happened. I still think of it often. We are told not once, but several times,that these things do not exist. Then there it was, big as life and looking heavyhanging in mid-air.My eyes burned for about 24 hours afterwards, and later that night after theadrenalin and excitement wore off, I became scared. I know better than most peoplehow smallMr. Bales must have felt.Before this I had never heard of a triangle-shaped UFO, but after years of research Ihave come to the same conclusion that I think you have. The U.S. Military, USAFand Lockheed Skunk Works don’t have anything like this. At the time, before the2nd Iraq war began, I remembered thinking that if Saddam Hussein saw this thingwith a USAF logo on it, he probably would have surrendered on the spot.That triangle was flat black, darker than the night and it had a kind of perfection toit. There were no insignia or designs anywhere and it looked powerful and “sleek,”like it could go like a bat-out-of-hell if it needed too, but it flew so slowly it lookedsurreal.If you read the MUFON report, you will read about it setting off my neighbor’struck car alarm. This happened *right* when it flew past his house – I thought forsure some kindof electromagnetic field had set it off.I don’t talk about this much except with my immediate family, but I think about italmost every day. I know you are a serious researcher, so I wanted you to have thistiny pieceof the puzzle.Here is a link to the 2002 report I filed at Mufon: http://mufoncms.com/cgi-bin/manage_sighting_reports.pl?mode=view_long_desc&id=10770&rnd=57791243740091 3) From: Hopson, Tennessee, August 1989Subject: Triangle UFO Sighting - 5 WitnessesDate: May 29, 2009To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comI live in a small town in a resort area in the western part of North Carolina, about 1mile from the Tennessee border. In August of 1989, myself, my Mom's sister and 4"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"friends were driving home from a nearby agricultural fair. About 15 minutes fromhome, as we were driving along (near Hopson, Tennessee, headed for home in ElkPark, NC), everyone laughing and talking about the evening, we rounded a curveand suddenly just ahead I saw an enormous black, triangle shaped “aircraft” floatingsilently about 100' - 200' above the highway. It was about 12:30 a.m. to 1:00 a.m.and we were the only car on the road with no homes nearby, or any street lights.The “craft” had 3 round glowing lights, one on each corner, as described in similarsightings. From our point of view, we were observing the craft from the underside,and it was slightly ahead of us above the road. The craft was “pointed” in theopposite direction of the way we were headed [ car was moving southeast and thetriangle craft was moving northwest]. The object was flat black in color, and wouldhave been virtually invisible had it not been for the lights, other than it was darkerthan the visible sky around it. The blackest black imaginable against the night sky,almost as if a triangle-shaped hole had been cut in the fabric of the space aboveyour head. The corners were not sharp points, but rather rounded, and very“smooth.” The object appeared to be seamless as if poured into a mold. (One point Iwant to make here is that not until years of hearing/seeing other reports of similarUFOs that we realized that the only significant difference in the descriptions is thatthere was NO center light that we could see. Perhaps it was simply not illuminated,or this is a different type of craft?)I was the first person to spot the object. I was the driver of the car. I alertedeveryone else to look up in the sky in front of the car, I said, “Oh, my lord, youguys...what on earth is that thing in the sky??” At that time, everyone looked andtried to get the craft in their line of sight. The people in the back seat rolled theirwindows down and leaned completely out of the vehicle. I was slowing down, andfinally came to a complete stop. It is a very rural area, with fairly mountainousterrain on all sides of the winding road. There are no houses along this stretch of thehighway. The closest town with any measurable population is Elizabethton,Tennessee. We had not passed any traffic at all, in either direction, for 10+ minutesprior to the sighting. There are no street lights in the area.After stopping the car in the middle of the highway, I realized that we were allstaring into the sky, mouths open, and nobody spoke for 10-15 seconds. It was oneof those surreal times that takes you by such surprise and utter disbelief, that rarelyoccurs in one's lifetime. Not before or since have I experienced this feeling.Somehow, time feels suspended, as if your brain has to catch up with the reality ofwhat you are experiencing with your eyes. There is an indescribable “ominous” or“dark” heaviness that comes over you, as if it encompasses your whole body.Whether or not this is an effect of the craft itself, or simply a type of unknownnatural fear I cannot say. We all had this feeling.I put the car in park, and everyone with me opened their doors and we all steppedoutside the car. The size and shape of the craft were immediately obvious assomething of unusual origin. Your mind searches its database trying to match theobject with anything you have seen before. You then realize that you are observing asolid object the size of a football field, defying gravity, “floating” like a heliumballoon in absolute silence. After you “come back” to conscious reality, it hitsyou...it hit all of us at the exact same time, we were looking at something none of uscould explain.Still, in a silent trance we all looked at the object and then looked around at eachother as if to confirm that this was happening, and we were all on the same page. I'mstill not sure why, but all of a sudden, I reached into the car, and tooted the horn,and yelled “HEY! We're down here!!” As if it were a startled animal, the craft“jerked” to life and began to tilt forward and glide swiftly and silently straight overour heads, following basically the direction from which we just came. I said, “Hurryeveryone, get back inside!” When we were all back inside the car, I put the car intogear, and did a sharp U-turn in the middle of the road. We were able to follow thecraft for about a mile before it disappeared over a mountaintop, during which time,we were able to observe the glowing back edge for the first time. As we turned tocontinue home, you could have heard a pin drop in the car, as we all tried tounscramble what had just happened.I have told this story many times, ONLY because I had 4 other people with me atthe time, who share the same details. If I had been alone, I think I may have beenhesitant to tell anyone. I am convinced that we are not being told the “whole story”by the governments of the world. UFO's are as real as the ground under our feet.We saw a solid object defying all accepted laws of physics that night. People have achoice to believe or not believe. Not believing does not make UFOs less a reality. Itonly takes seeing ONE to change your beliefs forever."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I enjoy listening to you on C2C, I hope to see you in Nashville next month...I will tryto say “Hello!” (Attached is a link to the Google map of the area where the sightingtook place)Red pointer marks location where emailer, his Mom's sister and three friends (5 eyewitnesses)“saw an enormous black, triangle-shaped ‘aircraft’ floating silently about 100' - 200' aboveour heads” in August 1989, as the car drove southeast toward Elk Park, NorthCarolina home and the triangle craft was headed northwest. 4) From: San Diego, California - Summer 2003Subject: Triangle SightingDate: May 29, 2009To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“... the triangle was revolving around its own center axis... ”I live in San Diego, Ca., in a residential area known as Oak Park. I work as a LibraryAssistant for the San Diego Public Library system, and one of my hobbies is doingback yard astronomy, both on my own and with a friend of mine from college.Mostly, I do binocular observing with two sets of binos. My lower resolution set arebirding binoculars made by Swarovski, and my high-powered pair are Vixen 20 x80's, for which I have a tripod.I do a fair amount of observing during the spring and summer months, so I know thenight sky, and I have seen a lot of what I would call “anomalous lights.”My Triangle sighting occurred in either late June or early July of 2003. I was justgoing out into the back yard at around 9 p.m. with my blankets for the chaise lounge(I observe laying flat on my back) and my Swarovski birding binos. I was walkingcarefully as the yard was dark and I did not want to trip going up the steps to themiddle part of my back yard. I put everything down on the chaise and looked up andto the North horizon across my neighbor's back yard, and I saw what appeared to betwo large red lights off to the Northeast. At first, I thought it might be a Sheriff'shelicopter because the lights were so close to the roof-tops of the houses and theywere relatively stationary (my house is along the flight-path for the Astrea andpolice choppers), but as I watched the lights, I realized there was no noise - nochopper-blade sounds and no sound of a small plane engine.When I first saw the lights, they stayed to the Northeast of my position. Thereappeared to be two of them, and they just kind of hung still for about a minute. I was"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"saying to myself, “What the heck is that? It is awfully low, even for the Astreachopper.” I kept listening for engine sounds and looking for the strobe-lights onesees on both helicopters and small planes, but I didn't see any. The lights were also avery vivid red - more cherry-red rather than the scarlet color of an airplane port-sidewing light - and they were quite bright.Then the lights started moving in relationship to each other. From my position, theyappeared to move horizontally apart for each other, stop, and then move along thesame horizontal line back towards each other. Then it looked like they'd merge intoone light, but then it would instantly divide into two, and the whole “move-apart,move-together” sequence would start all over again, like clockwork. At this point, Istarted to wonder if maybe I was looking at display lights on a blimp, because of theweird color and motion of the lights, but again, there were no engine sounds at all,and no other lights - just the two cherry-red ones doing the apart-together-apartthing.After appearing to remain stationary (to the Northeast of my position) for about aminute and a half, the lights then began to move from East to West, but were still tothe North of me. They were also very, very low, and appeared to be no more than75 to 100 feet over the roof-lines of the houses. The lights were still doing the“ apart-together” motion, and I was still trying to make visual sense of what I wasseeing. I was also worried that whatever it was might be about to crash, but I stillheard no engine noises at all.As the lights got to a position due North of me, a third red light appeared, and Isuddenly saw a darker silhouette-shape against the sky, which had some light-hazefrom street lights. As soon as I saw the darker shape, it was like my brain couldfigure out what my eyes were seeing - it was a dark craft shaped like an equilateraltriangle with a red light at each apex. Because it was so low, I was seeing it almostedge-on, but as it passed by me, I could see some of the bottom surface. As it wasflying forward (from East to West along a line that I then realized was only about ablock to two blocks North of my house), the triangle was revolving around its owncenter axis, so the red lights at each apex would “eclipse” each other and they thusappeared to merge, although they were not actually doing so.As soon as I realized what I was looking at, I said, “Holy sh*t, it's a Triangle!” I gotvery excited, and (rather irrationally, as it was pitch-black), I started waving at itlike a lunatic, and saying mentally, “I'm over here, guys, just off your port side!”Then, the very next instant, I felt a sudden, unexplained surge of fear, and I stoppedwaving. The weird thing about this was that although I could feel this kind ofpalpable fear, I also still felt my own excitement, and I still wanted to observe thething as it flew. I literally couldn't take my eyes off it.As the triangle moved to the West, I began to lose sight of it due to some trees in myneighbor's yard that partially blocked my view. I hurried as fast as I could to thelower part of my yard, and I thought, “I'll get a really good view of it as it comes outfrom behind the grapefruit tree... and I can't believe that no one else but me is seeingthis,” but it never came out from behind the tree. It just completely disappeared.I immediately came into the house, went through my garage, and out to the front ofmy house, where I have a very open view of the sky to the North and West, and Icould not see it anywhere - no red lights, no nothing. It was totally gone.The whole sighting, start to finish, was maybe 2 and 1/2 to 3 minutes long. My bestguess is that when I first saw the two lights, the Triangle was probably flyingedge-on and straight towards my position, which is why the lights appeared to bestationary to the Northeast of me. When it started to revolve around its own centerwas when the lights appeared to be doing the “apart-together” thing. As it passedtowards the West, I could see that it was flying extremely low, and it was absolutelysilent the whole time. I guesstimate that the Triangle was as big as the footprint ofthe average house in my neighborhood, but the black-on-black observing conditionsmade it a bit difficult to tell exactly how far away (and hence how big) the Trianglewas. My impression was it was very close and flying very low.Later that night, I had what I can only describe as a “spontaneous understanding” ofthe sudden fear I had felt earlier - I realized that I had experienced a form of“consciousness communication,” and that the fear I experienced was not me beingafraid - it was the apprehension of the pilot and crew of the craft. They had flown into oblige me (as I'm always asking for fly-bys when I'm out at night), but they werevery worried about flying in near me, so they were sort of “broadcastingnervousness.” I can't really tell you how I know this to be true, but I do think this iswhat I experienced.I could readily understand that the Triangle crew would be jittery as not only am I inthe law-enforcement helicopter flight-path, I am also in the Lindbergh Field"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"flight-path for incoming planes, and there are also Navy jets in the area (32nd StreetNavy Base and on carriers in port) as well as Marine planes at MCAS Miramar. Mylate husband was stationed at Miramar (when it was NAS Miramar), so I know justhow fast they can scramble planes when they want to. Plus, if disclosure witnessesare to be believed, some segments of our military are rather trigger-happy, which Ithink would cause most sentient beings some anxiety at one point or another.Hope this sighting is of some use to you and others who are studying this stuff! Oh,and yes, I did totally forget during the sighting that I had a pair of binos with me! Iwas truly bummed when I remembered later that my binoculars were literally at myfingertips throughout most of my experience.
