A depression is any economic downturn where real gross domestic product (GDP)declines by more than 10%. A recession is the reduction of a country's gross domesticproduct (GDP) for at least two quarters. A Bloomberg News survey reported February 12,2009: “This is the biggest U.S. economic decline since 1946 as consumer spending postsits longest slide on record.”February 12, 2009: Cong. Budget Office Reports Record$1.2 Trillion Federal Debt in 2009, Bringing TotalNational Debt to $10.6 Trillion.Total federal indebtedness has nearly doubled in ten years and every individual (305million people) in the United States would have to contribute $37,000 each to now pay offthe national debt.—“If you spent a million dollars every day since Jesus was born,you would have spent three-quarters of a trillion dollars. A million secondsis about 11.5 days. A billion seconds is about 32 years, and a trillion secondsis 32,000 years.” - John Allen Paulos, Ph.D., Math Prof., Temple Univ.—“You want to look at the Mafia, go to Wall Street!And Wall Street has high jacked Washington, D.

John Connally to Gerald Celente, 1992 "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Winter Issue 2009, The Trends Journal, Rhinebeck, N. Y. Original Earthfiles on January 30, 2009 Rhinebeck, New York - Nearly every year fora decade, I have interviewed Gerald Celente, Publisher and Editor of The Trends Journalin Rhinebeck, New York, about upcoming trends in the New Year. When we talked onDecember 21, 2007, about “Trends in 2008,” Gerald said: “In 2008, we’re going to seesome major, giant financial firms fall as they get hit by an economic 9/11. Watch for whenone of the big firms crashes – like a big bank. That’s going to be the first signal. But evenbigger than that. Much bigger – like a Bank of America - not that BofA is necessarily it,but of that caliber.\"Then nine months later on September 15, 2008, I interviewed Gerald Celente again afterhis forecast had come true and the American banks, mortgage companies, Fannie andFreddie and the economy were falling apart at a rapid rate. For the first time, Earthfilesasked: Are we facing a Depression like 1929? [ See 091508 Earthfiles in Archive.]Gerald Celente told me in that interview: ““This is a classic Titanic situation in the sensethat what we saw with the Fannie and Freddie bailouts and the Bear Stearns bailouts andnow the AIG request for more than forty billion more dollars from the federal government– it’s just like the Titanic where the rich and affluent were given the lifeboats and the restof the people went under from steerage. The rich and powerful are too big to fail; the restof us are too small to save.” Earthfiles: With the September 15, 2008 “Economic 9/11,”Are We Facing Depression Like 1929?“This is a classic Titanic situation in the sense that what we saw with the Fannieand Freddie bailouts and the Bear Stearns bailouts and now the AIG request for morethan forty billion more dollars from the federal government – it’s just like the Titanicwhere the rich and affluent were given the lifeboats and the rest of the peoplewent under from steerage.

S. history.Financial experts predicted at least 50 to 100 bank failures in the United States after IndyMac Bank. A month later on October 17, 2008, after accelerating bank and other company failures ontop of massive home foreclosures in the United States, Gerald Celente and I did an updateafter the American government bought $250 billion in ownership of United States banksand authorized nearly a trillion dollars be spent to bail out Wall Street, including a bailoutof the world's largest insurance company, A.I.G. That federal subsidy program is called theTroubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. Gerald Celente told me that the massivegovernment subsidy of the financial sector was subsidizing the greed and incompetencethat caused the economic collapse inn the first place. Gerald summed up the financialchaos this way: “This Wall Street bailout is really taxation without representation.”October 16, 2008, The Albuquerque Journal, Front Page Headline after Dow plunged733 points “on stream of disheartening economic data” released on October 16, 2008.October 16, 2008, The Albuquerque Journal, Front Page of Business Outlookafter government report confirmed September 2008 retail sales weredown 1.2% - almost double expectations."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"October 17, 2008, Associated Press.Now three months later at the end of January 2009, despite the trillion dollar federal TARPbailout, unemployment is rising even faster, real estate values continue to fall and the newBarack Obama Administration is struggling to convince Congress to authorize another$900 billion to jump start the American economy and keep the nation from collapsing intofull scale Depression like the 1930s. But Gerald Celente's Top Trend for 2009 is that thisyear will become the Greatest Depression.December 2008 Bureau of Labor Statistics, U. S. Department of Labor, Washington, D. C.“In December 2008, the number of unemployed persons increased by 632,000 to 11.1 million and theunemployment rate rose to 7.2 percent.” Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics.“We're just seeing the tip of the iceberg in the big firms (layoffs).There's certainly other firms beneath them that will lay off workers as quickly or evenquicker.” - Rebecca Braeu, Economist, John Hancock Financial ServicesFront Page, Albuquerque Journal, January 27, 2009.Cuts announced January 26, 2009, include: 20,000 from Pfizer/Wyeth;8,000 from Sprint-Nextel; 7,000 from Home Depot; 5,000 from Caterpillar;3,400 from Texas Instruments; 2,000 more layoffs from General Motors.Interview:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Gerald Celente, Editor and Publisher, The Trends Journal, Rhinebeck, New York: “In 2007, we predicted the Panic of 2008 and that was mostly in the financial areas. Nowwe're going to see it in the Collapse of 2009 spread beyond financials throughout society.It's underway. It's happening before our eyes. This is a collapse of monumentalproportions. Every day the news is filled with one disaster after another. There's nothing,nothing, they can do to stop this - other than a productive capacity and maybe analternative energy, something along the lines of the discovery of fire or the invention of thewheel! (laughs) But it has to be really monumental. We can't do it by printing money.I JUST GOT THE LABOR STATISTICS SUMMARY AS OF DECEMBER 2008: ‘INDECEMBER, THE NUMBER OF UNEMPLOYED PERSONS INCREASED BY 632,000TO 11.1 MILLION AND THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE ROSE TO 7.2%.’ WHAT DOYOU PROJECT WILL HAPPEN WITH THIS UNEMPLOYMENT RATE THROUGH2009?Well, there is a figure called the Total Unemployment Rate. That rate that you read doesnot include people who have been discouraged and can no longer find a job. They've givenup. And people who are working part-time that would like full time work. When you putthat number together, we're looking at 13.7%. We're going to see by the time this is over -and we don't know when it will be over - we're going to see unemployment numbers rivalthat of the Great Depression, probably around 22% to 27%. We are calling this the GreatCollapse because you are going to start seeing two factors take place very shortly. Retail and Commercial Real Estate CollapsesOne is going to be collapse in the retail sector. It's already estimated that about 150,000stores, retail shops, are going to close - both chain stores and smaller stores are going toclose in 2009. That adds, of course, to the unemployment, but it would also add greatly tothe commercial real estate glut. If you thought the sub-prime problem was bad, wait until you see this one. Commercial real estate is much more heavily leveraged than even in thesub-prime sector.And then we look at the collapse already in the financial sector. We saw Wachovia, wesaw IndyMac and Washington Mutual, Bear Stearns, Merill Lynch, Lehman Brothers -either get gobbled up or go under. And all the bond companies - names people don't know.The point being: Who is going to take up all that commercial space and business parks theyhave emptied?The answer in both retail and the office space - the people who are going to take over thatvacant space is nobody! You're going to see a glut of real estate that we have never seenbefore - ghost malls are going to be spreading around the country. So now, that's where thecollapse really happens because how are these people who leveraged all this commercialreal estate going to service these loans? The answer is: they are not! We're going to bemoving into the Greatest Depression.First, I want to make it clear why this is going to be worse and we're not ‘Gloom andDoomers.’ We're just looking at facts.One of the things to remember is that most people are one job away from losingeverything. It's not only the corporate greed that brought us into this. People went waybeyond their means and borrowed above their heads with these things called ‘home equityloans.’ Build on that addition! Go on the vacation! Buy the SUV! Borrow for whatever itmight have been. So people went way beyond their means as well. As I said, they are onepay check away from losing everything.We're going to see massive foreclosures. They are already at record levels. They are goingto continue to spread. There is no stopping this using the two tools the government has:- Adjust interest rates, which are now down to about zero on the Fed Funds rate.- Or print more money. But you can't print your way to prosperity!I mentioned home equity loans. Back in the 1930s, nobody had such a thing. If you had asecond mortgage, you were considered a loser. Back then, most people did not ownhomes. They did not have credit cards. They were not burdened with $14 trillion worth ofdebt! You only bought what you could afford back then.And also back then - very important - we weren't fighting losing wars with a huge military-industrial complex that has cost us well over $2 trillion already and is building as we'resending more troops, as we're hearing now, into Afghanistan."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"And back then in the 1930s - and this is the key point going back to what I said aboutproductive capacity. When we finally got out of the Great Depression, it was the onset ofWorld War II. We were the manufacturing giant of the world. We manufactured our wayout of the Great Depression. We no longer have that manufacturing base.So, having said that, what we're left with now is a nation of clerks. I look at these jobofferings. You go into a Quick Stop gas station and they say, ‘Have a career with us.’ Whatkind of career?! What happens to a young person who gets out of college with a diploma?So, you're going to have massive unemployment. You're going to have rising crime, a lot ofpetty crime and violent crime. It goes with the territory and people better get used to it.And local and state governments are not going to solve it by putting more police on thestreets, unless the government is going to turn this into a totally fascist country. Tax Revolts? Revolutionary Fever in America?And another thing we're going to start to see, Linda, we're going to start seeing revolutions.People have had it up to their eyeballs when they are hearing about all of these bailoutsand the corporate jets and the perks and bonuses that the bankers and banksters andbrokers are getting from the taxpayers' money with the billions of bailout dollars they aregetting. While the government is bailing out the Big Guys, the Too Small To Saves aregoing under while they are getting taxed to death.IF WE HAVE MORE THAN ELEVEN MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF WORK AS OFJANUARY 2009, AND ALL OF THE STATISTICS ON DECLINING HOUSING VALUESKEEPS GOING DOWN EVERY MONTH, IT MEANS THAT A HUGE PORTION OFTHE AMERICAN POPULATION NO LONGER HAS ANY FINANCIAL VALUE INTHE HOMES THEY ARE TRYING TO STAY IN. WHERE THEY ARE PAYINGMORTGAGES, THEY ARE PAYING MORE THAN THE HOUSE IS NOW WORTHWITH RISING UNEMPLOYMENT. HOW CAN ANY OF THESE GOVERNMENTPLANS UNDER THE NEW OBAMA ADMINISTRATION SOLVE WHAT SEEMS TOBE A SOCIAL-ECONOMIC IMPLOSION OF THIS COUNTRY?They can't. And they won't. The only things we can see them doing is grabbing more andmore power. They call it nationalizing banks. You know, in one year the whole texture ofthe United States changed. It began with the bailout of Bear Stearns. Or as I like to callthem: the Bear Stearns Gang. And there is the Merrill-Lynch Mob and the Lehman Boys.These are the gangsters, folks. As an Italian-American, I've heard enough Mafia stories tolast me for the rest of my life. You want to look at the Mafia, go to Wall Street! And WallStreet has high jacked Washington, D. C. Just as they created the Too Big To Fails, theyare going to create other kinds of banking institutions. They'll call them nationalized.So, what we are seeing is the takeover of free enterprise in this country. And it's happeningworldwide. When we talk about this financial meltdown, it's very important to understandthat this is a global meltdown. There are riots in Iceland, in Latvia, in Lithuania andGreece. This is just the beginning.WHERE IS THE LEVERAGE POINT BY ANY AMERICAN TAXPAYER TO CHANGEANYTHING ABOUT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT NOW?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The only leverage point is, as we say, we're going to see revolts and among those are goingto be tax revolts. You're going to start seeing them happening. The values of houses havegone down. But each year, when the values were going up, local governments would raisethe assessments and you, the taxpayer, would have to pay more money. So now, are thoselocal governments going to de-value? Are they going to ask for less taxes? Well, not herein New York! The local governments are asking us taxpayers for 7% increases. So, inreality, they should be lowering taxes, but they are not.The whole face of America has changed. We, the people, now own the largest insurancecompany in the world, A.I.G. We own big pieces of banks. We own auto companies. Weown the largest mortgage companies. Some people are calling it socialism. You can evencall it fascism. The one thing you cannot call what is going on in the United States - it's notfree market enterprise. It's a takeover. The government is going to keep asking for moretaxes.Look at the people they have brought in to manage the TARP money. They brought themin from the Blackstone Group. They brought them in from Goldman Sachs. They broughtthem in from all the gangs that made the collapse happen! So, the fallacy is thatgovernment is behind this. At the Trends Journal, we wrote about this when it started tohappen when the name of our Trend Alert was ‘D. C. Heist - Wall Street Mob Takes OverWashington.’ And that's what has happened. So, this is what is going on and now, WallStreet is just controlling it all in a different way. No Government Take-Overs of Banksin 1929 Great DepressionAND ISN'T THIS ONE OF THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCES WITH WHAT HAPPENEDIN 1929 THROUGH THE 1930S? THERE WAS NOT GOVERNMENT TAKE OVER OFBANKS AND CORPORATIONS THEN, RIGHT?Exactly! And the other thing that is important to understand - this GMAC thing became abank - the GMAC that loans money to people to buy cars. Well, GMAC became a bank onChristmas eve 2008 when no one was watching. That's so GMAC could tap into the TARPmoney for $26 billion! Then look at who owns GMAC? Well, you would think GeneralMotors. But if you did, you would think wrong. 51% of GMAC is owned by Cerberus. Youknow who Cerberus is? They own Chrysler Corporation.WHICH IS GOING UNDER AS WELL!Right. And you know who the CEO of Cerberus is? John Snow, former Treasury Secretary,the guy just before John Paulson [ who came up with the Bush Administration's TARPplan.] Former Vice President Dan Quail is a director on the Cerberus board. The fix is in!It's a rigged game. I love the name, Cerberus, the name of the three-headed mythologicaldog that guards the the gates of Hell [to prevent those who have crossed the river Styxfrom ever escaping.] Do you need to know any more?! Gerald Celente Stunned by TexasGovernor John Connally in 1992“You don't have a clue what is going onand neither do the American people because if they did,there would be a revolution in this country.”- Former Texas Gov. John Connally to Gerald Celente, 1992THIS THEN IS THE PERFECT TIME FOR YOU TO SHARE ABOUT WHAT YOUROWN EXPERIENCE WAS WITH THE FORMER TEXAS GOVERNOR, JOHNCONNALLY IN YOUR 1992 EXPERIENCE WITH HIM AND WHAT HE SAID TOYOU?Yes. As a matter of fact, in our Trends Journal now you can see a photograph of him, meand his wife, Nellie, standing in front of the Dallas Book Depository in 1992. It was theirfirst time back there since the 1963 assassination of JFK. Governor Connally wanted tomeet me because in one of my previous books, Trend Tracking, that I wrote in the 1980s, Ihad predicted a new third party and someone like Ross Perot would be the candidate. WhyI mentioned his name, I'll never know."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"BUT YOU WERE RIGHT.I know. I don't know how I came up with Perot's name, but I did. And so that day afterlunch, Gov. Connally started telling the story of what happened in Dallas. He explained heheard a gun shot and knew it was a gun shot because, ‘I had been hunting since I was alittle boy. And I was wearing a dark blue suit that day and I looked over to my left andtheir were brains on my shoulder. I knew they were brains because my daddy was abutcher.’On the way back in the car, we got out of the limousine and were walking back into theAnatole Hotel. He stopped me and he looked at me and said, ‘I know your heart is in theright place. I read you book and it's a fine piece of work. But you don't have a clue aboutwhat's going on and neither do the American people.’IN THE GOVERNMENT.Yes. He said, ‘You don't have a clue what is going on and neither do the American peoplebecause if they did, there would be a revolution in this country.’And this was a guy, as we all know was governor of Texas, he was Treasury Secretaryunder Richard Nixon. This guy was on the inside. And this was 1992. Now, if we look atthe levels of corruption now - I mean, there is not a state that doesn't have a crookedpolitician making news. I stood there for a second after he walked away from me. I hadbeen a political atheist before then after I had been in government. I was the assistant tothe secretary of the New York State Senate and I ran a mayoral campaign in Yonkers, NewYork, at a graduate school. I had been around enough and when Gov. Connally said that, Iwas stunned for a second. But it confirmed everything that I had come to believe. Andnow, I think the time for the revolution is going to happen - the one he was talking aboutbecause now people know. ‘If the people only knew...’ Now, the people know! They aregetting robbed blind in broad daylight. Survival in the ChaosWe're telling people to really take this very seriously. The ship is sinking. Don't spend anyextra money that you don't have. If your kid is in college and he or she are not going to geta job with the degree they will have, don't go deeper into debt for them or yourself to keepthe college degree going. Pull the plug on it now. Don't buy anything above your means.Support anything locally that you can.And go out and have a good time. We're not telling people to hide in cocoons. That's crazy.Go out and enjoy yourself. You only live once, but do it within your means.REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE GOVERNMENT AND CORPORATIONS ARE DOING.(laughs)Exactly! Life goes on. Let's remember that during the 1929 Depression, it was the hottest,happiest music that anybody had ever known. It was swing time! People got dressed upand they had a good time and we can do that again. So, don't let the government controlyour life.”More Information:For further reports with Gerald Celente and the Trends Journal, please see EarthfilesArchive:• 10/17/2008 — After Wall Street Bailout, Is Main Street Headed for Depression?• 09/17/2008 — With the September 15, 2008 “Economic 9/11,” Are We Facing DepressionLike 1929?• 12/21/2007 — Trends 2008• 12/21/2006 — Top Trends for 2007 by Gerald Celente• 02/03/2006 — Trends 2006• 12/31/2000 — Top Trends 2001• 01/02/2000 — New Trends for 21st Century• 01/03/1999 — Trends in 1999 with Gerald CelenteWebsites:Trends Research: http://www.trendsresearch.comU.
