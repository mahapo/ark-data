Videotape © 2009by Derek Bridges and prepared by Kenneth John Parsons,Chairman, British Earth and Aerial Mysteries Society. October 30, 2009 Overton and Basingstoke, Hampshire County, England - OnOctober 10, 2009, I received an email from Kenneth John Parsons, Chairman of the BritishEarth and Aerial Mysteries Society. It said, “Our Society has videotape shot at night of aU.K. farm animal abduction where you can see the helpless creature as it goes up into thecraft!”Ken Parsons helped me make contact with the videotaper, Derek Bridges, 69-years-old, and a retired auto mechanic who has lived in Overton, Hampshire, England, since 1964.About a mile from Derek’s home is the large 2,500-acre Laverstoke Park Farm owned andmanaged by former South African auto racing driver, Jody Scheckter. In addition to cattle,wild boars, pigs, sheep, and poultry, Mr. Scheckter imported a herd of water buffalo fromRomania and now has 1,500 of the large animals at Laverstoke as well. The farm evensells water buffalo milk.Herd of 1500 water buffalo imported from Romania to Laverstoke Park Farm,Overton, Hampshire, England.

Derek said he tried to see what was making the red lightby looking through his binoculars. He couldn’t figure it out. Suddenly the dark red lightbegan to brighten and Derek got his videotape camera. He told me he held back thewindow curtain with one hand while he balanced the camera in the other hand without atripod. So, the video is shaky and he wasn’t sure what he had taped.Derek is friends with Ken Parsons and went to his house to see the video on a bigger TVscreen. The two men decided they could see a large animal dangling below the brightlight. Was it a cow? Was it a water buffalo? Ken Parsons and Derek Bridges sent me avideo clip and neither knows the source of the odd “cicada” sound.

To his amazement, three or four helicopters showed up flyingaround as if searching.I asked Ken Parsons if he would inquire with Laverstoke Farm about missing animals. Welearned that in the week of September 28th, two cows were found dead, cause unknown,and I’m waiting for more information about the water buffalo. Strange Aerial Craft and EntityEncounter in BasingstokeAugust 4, 2007, 11 PMDerek also remembered a man living in Basingstoke about six miles up the road who had aclose encounter with a craft in 2007. With Ken Parson’s help, I interviewed thateyewitness. He is Kris Reed, 31, a British truck driver."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Kris Reed, 31, British truck driver and former residentof Basingstoke, Hampshire, England. 2009 image courtesy Kris Reed.To help me understand what he saw, Kris sent me some sketches, which are included inthis report at Earthfiles.com. High strangeness began for Kris on Saturday, August 4, 2007,at around 11 PM. He had been driving his truck all day and had finally returned to his topfloor apartment to eat some dinner on the balcony. Here now is Kris Reed with whathappened next.Interview:Kris Reed, 31, British truck driver, Basingstoke, Hampshire, U. K. resident inAugust 2007, and now living in west London, England: “I noted something out of thecorner of my eye. It was a purple-reddish orb and it was about 150 feet away from mehovering over the roofs of the houses. It seemed to come out of nowhere!Immediately I had all these senses I never felt before that made me really alert. I was justfocused on this orb of light and it started to change color. It went from a purple like flamesin the air.I was just focused on these amazing colors that were changing from purples to reds. Thenit turned to a more reddish color and that’s when it illuminated the craft that it wasattached to. Like in the very front of the craft was where the flames were – like an energysource.2007 illustration of the strange aerial craft that suddenly appeared about 150 feetfrom the apartment deck where Kris Reed was eating dinner. Squiggly lines indicatethe visible “force field” or “bubble atmosphere” around the craft. Sketch © 2007 by Kris Reed.WHAT WAS THE SHAPE AND COLOR OF THE CRAFT?It was kind of reflecting the redness of the flame, kind of a metallic red. It was verystealthy and red metallic-looking. There were like lines underneath the craft. It was sort oflike a helicopter size and the tail went up to a point in the back. Along the topside weresort of triangle-shaped windows, which were blacked out. There were no propellers. Therewas no noise coming from the craft. There seemed to be some kind of force field or barrieraround the craft.YOU SAY THAT BECAUSE WHY?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Because I could just see something around the craft. It was away from the atmospherelike the craft was in a bubble.WAS IT THE WAY HEAT WAVES LOOK FROM A HOT ROAD?Yeah, almost! You could tell there was something in the air around it. It’s very hard toexplain. I get really nervous talking about this! And it was very stealthy-looking. It waslike something out of the future.AND THE WINDOWS?Yeah, the windows. There was several, about five, six, seven windows on the top of thecraft all in a triangle shape. The front black triangle-window suddenly became see-through50 or 70 feet above a house that it stopped over. Then a purple light, like a spotlight,shone down onto the house for about five seconds.Strange aerial craft with triangle shaped, black windows, and purple-red, fiery light,shining at the front and a purple light shining down on a house for aboutfive seconds. Illustration © 2009 by Kris Reed.(laughs) I was absolutely gobsmacked! It was like a beam of light just came down on ahouse and then after five seconds, it disappeared.And then, the front window became see-through and there was this alien Grey – youknow, the ones with the big black eyes – looking down at what he was doing, lookingdown at the house.There was this alien Grey being – the one with the big black eyes. He was looking to hisright and down at the house or whatever he was doing. The being then looked up andlooked directly at me and this is where it sounds a bit crazy, but this is what he did. Helooked at me. He looked back to his left. I couldn’t see anyone else in the craft, but itlooked like he was communicating with someone else in the craft. He looked back towardsme and he poked out his tongue. He had this really long tongue, like a pointed tongue. Likehe jokingly poked out his tongue at me. (laughs) It sounds crazy, but that is what he did.And did that twice.TWICE?Yeah, and he smiled. I could see the whiteness like he had teeth. And I could see what hewas wearing - a shiny black suit. He was a very, very slender being – a tiny, thin beingwith really long arms and really long fingers. Big black eyes. I start shaking every time Ispeak about this! (laughs)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Close-up illustration of the skinny, “Grey” being that stuck its long, “lizard tongue”at Kris Reed twice from the front window of the aerial craft. Sketch © 2009 by Kris Reed. YOU’RE SHAKING RIGHT NOW AS YOU ARE TELLING ME?Yeah, every time I bring it up, I get nervous.WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN THIS GREY BEING IN THIS TIGHT,SHINY BLACK SUIT STICKS HIS SILVER, LONG POINTED, TONGUE AT YOUTWICE?I assumed at that point, the whole world or parts of the world were being invaded by thesebeings. I assumed this was going on everywhere. I just assumed that they are here. I stoodthere and stared. I didn’t know what else to do.And I said a few swear words like, ‘What the f- - - are you doing here?’ I just could notbelieve it! I could not believe what I was seeing.I felt kind of nervous and scared of what I was seeing. And I didn’t want it to see mebecause it would have flown away or something. So, I kind of hid and kept my eye on it.BUT THIS BEING STILL SAW YOU.Yeah, he looked at directly at me. He poked out his tongue, did that twice, and kind ofsmiled. He waved his hand and then the window turned black again and I could not seehim after he waved his hand.THEN WHAT HAPPENED?And then the craft – there was a slight rumble noise and then the craft really slowly movedin the direction it was pointing to the right about three or four hundred yards. The craftthen stopped and turned towards me, the front of it with the red flames got bigger so Icould not see the craft behind it. There were just these big, red flames. And then the centerof the red flames, there came a white ball of light and the whole craft and the flames likedematerialized into this white ball of light. Then like a bullet out of a gun, it just shot awayat an incredible speed!It was really strange. It was like something opened up behind it, like something in theatmosphere moved behind it like a tunnel. It was very strange!I THINK I UNDERSTAND. IT TOOK OFF VERY RAPIDLY WITH SOMETHING"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"BETWEEN YOU AND THE CRAFT THAT SEEMED TO BE EITHER LIKE ATUNNEL OR CAUSED THE CRAFT TO DISAPPEAR.Yeah, it was like the craft dematerialized into a white ball of light. But the craft seemed todisappear in a tunnel, or something like a tunnel opened up behind it. It’s very hard todescribe!WHAT DID YOU DO NEXT? DID YOU CALL ANYONE OR AUTHORITIES?I ran around on the balcony screaming. Then I phoned my parents. I phoned my twinbrother. I phoned everybody I knew.WHAT WERE YOU SAYING?I was just really excited and stunned.WHAT WERE YOU TELLING YOUR PARENTS AND FRIENDS THAT YOU HADSEE N?I said I’d seen this being, a big-eyed alien Grey in the window of a craft. I told themeverything, every single detail.AND WHAT DID THEY SAY TO YOU?Even from my folks and my friends, I just got ridicule. You know, it isn’t something yousee every day.EXPLAIN ABOUT HOW YOU COULD NOT SLEEP.I actually thought because I saw him that night, they were going to come back and I wasquite frightened about them coming back when I was asleep, so I stayed awake probablyfor three days.YOU DIDN’T SLEEP FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS AFTER?I stayed awake on my balcony like waiting for it to come back. I really wanted to see themagain. I wanted to make contact.EVEN AFTER THIS BEING STUCK ITS LONG, POINTED TONGUE OUT AT YOUTWICE AND SEEMED TO LAUGH, YOU STILL WANTED THEM TO COME BACKAND YOU WANTED TO SEE THEM?Well, yeah, I wanted to understand. Who are they? What are they doing here? More formy questions.WHEN THIS BEING STUCK HIS TONGUE OUT TWICE, DID YOU GET ANYMENTAL IMPRESSIONS AS IF HE MIGHT BE CONVEYING SOME THINGTELEPATHICALLY TO YOU?No, it was like he poked his tongue out like, ‘Oh, you’ve seen me.’ He didn’t laugh, but hekind of smiled. Yeah, but nothing telepathically. I didn’t hear any mental voices or see anypictures in my head.WHEN YOU FINALLY DID GET TO SLEEP, DID YOU HAVE ANY DREAMS ABOUTTHIS BEING?Occasionally, I would get a surge of energy in my head sometimes when I’m trying tosleep, just when I’m falling asleep. I don’t really know what it is, but it’s as if my head is amagnet and another magnet is coming near it.DO YOU HAVE ANY RESIDUAL FEELING ABOUT THE INTENT OF THAT BEING?I don’t know what – he was shining a light down on a house. From my research, the Greyshave not had a good rap.KRIS, BUT YOU DID FEEL AFRAID?Yeah, I did feel – I mean, when I was looking at him, I felt really cold. I didn’t smile backat him. I was actually giving him a really nasty look, like, ‘What are you doing here?’ Whothe hell are you?” - sort of thing. That was the feeling at the time – an alien in the craft –What the hell?! You know? (laughs) At the time, it was that vibe, yeah.WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT BEING IN THAT HIGHLY UNUSUAL CRAFTTHAT WAS CAPABLE OF PUTTING A PURPLE BEAM DOWN ON A HOUSE, ANDTHE BEING WENT SO FAR AS TO STICK OUT ITS POINTED SILVER TONGUE ATYOU TWICE..."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"It was a lizard-type tongue, yeah.IT WAS A LIZARD-TYPE TONGUE?Yeah, it was kind of pointy like you see a lizard. You imagine a lizard’s tongue to bepointy.AND VERY LONG.Yeah. I estimate it was probably 6 or 7 inches long. It looked very unusually long.I’ve spoken to one or two people who have had abductions with Greys and have aconscious memory of these beings, have had meetings with them, and the people say therace of Greys they have met do not have these long tongues. So, I don’t know what kind ofrace he was or where it came from. It was a different race – the friendly ones, I think.THIS WAS REPTILIAN LOOKING SORT OF?I don’t know. Its skin was very pale in very dim light inside the craft. It didn’t look scalyor anything like that. It looked like a very smooth skin. But the tongue was very pointywas very pale or white. Big black eyes. Really something you don’t want to see on a darknight! (laughs)THAT YOU DON’T WANT TO SEE ON A DARK NIGHT!No, big black eyes and a big, huge head.WEARING A BLACK, SHINY SUIT LIKE A LEOTARD.It was like a leotard, yeah. Round neck, long that came down to his wrists, like skin-tight. Ithink he had some kind of emblem on the chest area. A very, very slender being.DO YOU HAVE ANY MEMORY OF WHAT THAT LOGO WAS?Some kind of triangle perhaps. A circle and triangle – I don’t know.HOW FAR DO YOU THINK THE BEING WAS FROM YOU AT THAT MOMENT INTHE CRAFT?About 50 yards.OK, SO THIS CRAFT AND BEING WERE NO MORE THAT ABOUT 150 FEET FROMYOU ON YOUR DECK?Yeah. I saw it very clearly, yes.HOW LONG DO YOU THINK THAT THE CRAFT AND BEING WERE THERE ATABOUT 150 FEET FROM YOU?A few minutes. It was probably 2.5 to 3 minutes. It was a very conscious memory, not likeyou see a shooting star. It was there for minutes.DID YOU TALK WITH THE PEOPLE NEXT DOOR THAT YOU SAW THE PURPLEBEAM COME DOWN ON THEIR HOUSE?It looked like it came down on a house, but behind the house was a railway line. So Iwasn’t sure if it came down on the house or came down on the railway line.BUT DID YOU GO TO THE HOUSE AND ASK TO TALK WITH THEM?No, I didn’t. I just thought they would have thought I was crazy.ISN’T THAT SAD? - THAT WE CAN’T EVEN TALK WITH EACH OTHER ABOUTSOMETHING AS IMPORTANT AS WHAT YOU HAVE EXPERIENCED.It is.WHAT IS IT THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE HAPPEN BETWEEN HUMANS ANDTHESE GREYS? AND WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO HAPPEN?That’s a good question. I just hope they are peaceful beings. My gut feeling is that I justfelt protective of the Earth – like, ‘What are you doing here? Haven’t you just turned upunannounced like somebody at your doorstep?’ Like, ‘Who are you? What the hell are youdoing here?’ That was my feeling at the time."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"But he looked at me and kind of smiled and made peace, as if to say, ‘OK, you’ve seenme. And he kind of waved. It wasn’t like he gave me an evil look.He had a joke with me, he poked out his tongue – even though I found that kind of weird!(laughs) He didn’t offend me. He was kind of trying to make a joke with me.You know, I wish I’d shown him more emotion or more welcome, which I didn’t.BUT KRIS, YOU WERE AFRAID.Yeah, I was in shock. I didn’t know what to do.
