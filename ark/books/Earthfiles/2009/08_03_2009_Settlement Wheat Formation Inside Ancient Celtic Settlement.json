August 3, 2009 Yatesbury, Wiltshire, England - Yesterday, August 2, 2009, a new wheatformation was reported at Morgan's Hill near Bishop Cannings, Wiltshire. This is thesecond pattern in 2009 around Morgan's Hill. The first was the “lunar cycle calculator” ofApril 24, 2009, in flowering oilseed rape that indicated a date of July 7, 2009, for anastronomical event that the Australian scientist and physicist Mike Reed of North Carolinareported might relate to a solar event, probably a flare. The largest sunspot in more than ayear of our abnormally quiet, spotless sun occurred between July 5 and 7, 2009. So, thatApril 24th Morgan's Hill crop formation was forecasting a future astronomical event.“Lunar cycle calculator” reported April 24, 2009,in flowering oilseed rape at Morgan's Hill, Wiltshire, England,the first 2009 pattern near the ancient settlement hill.

Other information and images: Cropcircleconnector.com.The new formation on the other side of Morgan's Hill from the spring pattern appears inaerial images to be so rigidly precise inside the very rectangular, ancient Morgan's HillSettlement. But on the ground in the afternoon of August 2, 2009, I was surprised by howmessy-looking the new pattern is in contrast, for example, to Ogbourne St. George of July24, 2009. [See 073009Earthfiles] The fact that the pattern looks so rigidly detailedfrom the air and so messy on the ground is a contradictory phenomenon we've seen before,even in classic early 1990s patterns I have explored. Sometimes the “messiness” seems"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"related to creating the impression of 3-dimensional structure in aerial views.Rectangular wheat pattern reported August 2, 2009, at Morgan's Hillnear Bishop Cannings.

Then you realize that the first chaoticplants circling the inner patterns are like a sea of choppy water. When I studied theperimeter of that choppy sea of wheat, I found lots of stems flat on the ground without anybreak or crease at ground level.Further, around the central, intricate pattern, is a border made of wheat in 4-foot-widesections laid down at 90-degree angles that repeat to create the “ribbon” weaving aroundthe central pattern. The Australian scientist counted 20 cross-hatches on each side of theMorgan's Hill rectangular pattern and wonders if that relates to the Mayan 20-day-countcalendar? If so, could this August 2, 2009, Morgan's Hill formation be pointing to anupcoming date 80 days from the formation's appearance? That might coincide with theappearance of a comet in October 2009?

History Background for Morgan's Hill AreaWhen the Romans invaded Wiltshire in 43 A.D., there were Celtic people living in smallkingdoms, frequently at war with each other in iron age communities. Iron age hilltop fortshad been constructed and were used for defense against the invading Saxons. Examplesare Barbury Castle north of Marlborough and Liddington Castle near Swindon. Wiltshirewas the scene of important battles between the Celts and Saxons, and again later betweenthe Saxons and Danes, culminating in a final victory at Edington, Wiltshire, in 878 AD.The Celts built settlements bounded by protective ditches such as those still clearly visibleat the Morgan's Hill settlement near Bishop Cannings and Devizes.More Information:For further information about worldwide crop formations, please see Earthfiles Archivedreports (partial list below) and my book, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles, in theEarthfiles Shop.07/30/2009 - Silver Disc Videotaped Near Barbury Castle07/30/2009 - Infrared Video of Light Flashes, Moving Darknesses - and Entity?07/29/2009 - Inside the 12-Armed Ogbourne St. George Wheat Formation07/15/2009 - Part 1: Silbury Hill \"Que tz lcoatl He addre ss\" and Myste rious Tall Blonds07/14/2009 - 2-Stage Cannings Cross Wheat Formation Scene of Farm Arrest07/12/2009 - Mysterious Aerial Lights Mimicking Stars in Texas and Oregon07/11/2009 - Update Podcast: Is Sudde n Solar Inte nsity of July 5 - 7 What U.K. Spring CropFormations Fore cast for Oddly Q uie t Sun?07/06/2009 - UK \"Q ue tz alcoatl He addre ss\" and \"Sixth Sun Tz olkin\"?07/03/2009 - UK \"Nazca Hummingbird\" - Astronomical and Mayan Counting07/03/2009 - Part 3: \"Alie n Symbols\" in Milk Hill and South Fie ld07/02/2009 - Part 1: \"Alie n Symbols\" in Milk Hill and South Fie ld07/02/2009 - Part 2: \"Alie n Symbols\" in Milk Hill and South Fie ld06/09/2009 - Update Podcast: Aerial Lights That Mimic Stars, Helicopters and Airplanes06/05/2009 - Part 2: Myste rious, Sile nt, Large Ae rial Triangle s06/04/2009 - Part 1: Myste rious, Sile nt, Large Ae rial Triangle s05/12/2009 - Part 3: Astronomical Information in U.K. 2009 Crop Formations?05/10/2009 - Part 2: 800-Foot-Long Pattern in U.
