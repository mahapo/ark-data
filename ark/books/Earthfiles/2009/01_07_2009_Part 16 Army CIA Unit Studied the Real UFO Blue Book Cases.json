Entirely different aliens? Just what is this?” - Richard M. Nixon, V. President, Oval Office, Fall 1958 Return to Part 1Return to Part 15January 7, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - My June 29, 1998, interview with Steinat his Florida home continues from Part 15, in which he describes in more detail an OvalOffice meeting about UFOs with Vice President Richard Nixon in the fall of 1958 and thephotographs shown to Nixon then, followed by a brief meeting in April 1959 with bothNixon and President Dwight Eisenhower in FBI headquarters, Washington, D. C. Left: Dwight David Eisenhower, 1st Supreme Allied Commander Europeand 34th American President. Right: Richard Milhous Nixon, V. Pres. for 34th President,Dwight D. Eisenhower, January 20, 1953 – January 20, 1961; and 37th AmericanPresident, January 20, 1969 – August 9, 1974.“DID NIXON MAKE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT HIS OWN CONFUSION ORFRUSTRATION ABOUT WHO EXACTLY WAS RUNNING THE AREA 51OPERATION, ABOUT WHICH HE, AS VICE PRESIDENT, COULD NOT GETANSWERS?Yes. He told us he was very upset that he could not get any direct answers either. Nixonsaid he was passing all the information on to Ike and that it seemed like ‘we’re all on theoutside looking in.’ Then he said being on the outside was not the place to be if you are theU. S. President and Vice President trying to run the show. So, Nixon was going to speak toPresident Eisenhower about that. I don’t know what happened, but you would assume thatIke would have pulled whoever was in charge at Area 51 into the White House for a longtalk."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"EVEN IF THAT HAPPENED, DID IT CHANGE ANYTHING?Not that we knew. Of course, Anthony and I never went back to Area 51 together, so Idon’t know if anything changed or not. WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU LAY OUT ON THE SURFACE OF THE OVAL OFFICEDESK FOR NIXON TO SEE?Different photographs such as the Italian one. We had a tape recorder with us to play backthe interviews we had with the eyewitnesses. We were going to play them back to Nixon,but he said he would rather that we just tell him what was on the tape. So we talked aboutwhat was on that particular Italian tape. We had sent CIA agents to Italy to interview theman and woman, the couple.THERE WAS A PARALLEL BETWEEN THE ITALIAN PHOTO AND THE MONTANAANACONDA MINE PHOTO – THE SAME SORT OF DISC AND SMALL BEINGSOUTSIDE PICKING STUFF OFF THE GROUND?Yes. The craft were not entirely identical, but they were very close and the aliens cameout, picked up stuff from the ground and went back into the craft.ITALY WAS PINE CONES. MONTANA WAS THE COPPER ORE.Ye s .WHAT OTHER PHOTOGRAPHS AND PLACES DID YOU SHOW NIXON?We had the aerial shots from Mexico. Two or three photos.COULD YOU SEE DETAILS?No, too far away. Too cheap a camera. I wish I could have seen the FBI photographsbefore those agents left the Oval Office because they had a squadron of discs in thephotos. They also had fighter planes with moving picture cameras onboard that flew rightup through the squadron. The squadron is the one they said looked like German discs. Iimagine the quality must have been very good.The trouble with a lot of the sightings and photographs was that people were always takingpictures with their little Brownie Kodaks.WHAT ABOUT BELGIUM?Yes, I showed Nixon the Belgium photo (from color 16mm film). It was a small triangularcraft with lights in each of the three triangle corners.NIGHT TIME?It was in nighttime. You could basically see the whole craft faintly because of lightreflection on the bottom. The triangle came over a tip of France and into Belgium before itgot back to The Netherlands and then to the English Channel. The triangle craft haddipped into one little Belgium town and someone had taken a photograph at that time.THE REPORT WAS THAT THE TRIANGLE WENT BACK TOWARD GREATBRITAIN?Yes. On the report with that triangle photo, they had a radar track that followed the craftright up the English Channel and on up to the North Sea area, veered over the north ofScotland and headed for the North Pole."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WAS THAT 16MM COLOR FILM? OR STILL PHOTOGRAPH?It was color 16mm film that the eyewitness had taken, but it was at night and you couldjust see the lights that looked bright. The craft looked dark around the lights. You could seeit was a triangular shape, but you could not see any details on the bottom.WHO TOOK THE FILM?Someone had just borrowed a used 16mm camera and was taking film around town andwas walking back to his house when he saw the craft come toward him and over the townand filmed it.WERE THE PHOTOS YOU SHOWED NIXON BLOWN UP FROM THE 16MM?Yes, we showed Nixon blown up frames from the 16mm film, not the film itself.WHAT DID NIXON SAY?Nixon said he had seen a triangular ship before, too. He said it looked like a photographthat had been sent from California or Oregon that he had seen earlier that morning. So, hehad seen a triangular craft on a photo with the FBI and USAF before we showed him theBelgium photo blow-ups.Nixon’s only comment was, ‘I wonder if this triangle craft is coming from an entirelydifferent place? Entirely different aliens? Just what is this?’ He was as confused as the restof us. He didn’t know what was happening.SO IN FALL 1958, NO ONE KNEW.Right, nobody, except there could have been people at Area 51 with much moreknowledge that they weren’t even reporting to the White House, you know? BUT THERE WAS THE LIVE, GREY ALIEN AT AREA 51 THAT COULDCOMMUNICATE TELEPATHICALLY AND APPARENTLY HAD BEEN THERE FORSOME TIME. WHY WOULDN’T AMERICAN LEADERS BE GIVEN MOREINSIGHTS ABOUT WHO? WHAT? FROM WHERE?Right, Nixon said the information he had gotten from Area 51 about the grey alien therewas that the being told everyone it was from the planet with the long number and nameand that they were on Earth not to do harm, but were trying to help. Nixon said the greybeing gave the same answers every time it was interviewed, but nothing solid was everconfirmed. Nixon said that if the grey being got a question it didn’t like, the being wouldnot answer, just like the grey being is the top of security for someone else! (laughs)So, Nixon was frustrated that everyone got the same information, which was basically ofvery little help.DID YOU OR ANTHONY BRING UP THE FACT THAT YOU HAD ASKED ABOUTWHETHER THE GREY BEING WAS RELATED TO DEMONS IN ANY WAY? DIDYOU TALK ABOUT THAT WITH NIXON?Not with Nixon, no. Nixon just looked at the beings as aliens that were able to operate ontheir own. The ‘extraterrestrial biological entity’ phrase never came out in any of thosemeetings. Nixon and everyone else just called them ‘aliens,’ and that was it. No one talkedabout specific types of aliens. Not ‘Greys,’ except the only time I ever heard the word‘Greys’ was when Col. Jim taking us through Area 51 mentioned that the alien being we"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"were seeing was a ‘Grey.’ That’s the only time I heard that term used.IN BOTH MEETINGS WITH NIXON AND THE LATER SPRING MEETING WITHNIXON AND EISENHOWER, NOTHING WAS DISCUSSED ABOUT ALIENDIFFERENCES AND AGENDAS? DID EISENHOWER ASK ABOUT THERELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS AND THE GREYBEINGS?No, President Eisenhower just referred to them as different types of ‘aliens’ At that timeapparently, there was no information about the 6-fingered aliens and where they werefrom. At least that never came up in the meetings.I remember saying to Anthony after one of the meetings, ‘Gee, this was a wash! We didn’taccomplish a thing!’THE BLIND LEADING THE BLIND.Yes. I always had the feeling that whoever was in charge of Area 51 was above the normalgovernment. The Area 51 people probably told Eisenhower and Nixon exactly what theywanted to tell them and nothing more. And as I said, even Nixon commented, ‘We’re onthe outside looking in.’BUT HOW COULD THAT HAVE OCCURRED UNLESS PRESIDENT TRUMANSIGNED SOME KIND OF EXECUTIVE ORDER SETTING IN MOTION A GROUPTHAT WAS IMMUNE FROM CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT? THERE HAD TOHAVE BEEN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO SET UP THE AUTHORITY OVER THEALIEN PHENOMENON.Well, remember that even J. Edgar Hoover took it upon himself to do whatever he thoughtthe FBI should be doing since he invented the FBI. You could never tell Hoover exactlywhat the FBI should be doing because his mind was closed to outside influence.I have a feeling that whoever was in charge of the TOP SECRET alien stuff decided whatwould be said or not said, including saying nothing of consequence to presidents afterTruman. It seems to me that the Majestic 12 group set up by Truman has run it all by itselfoutside normal channels. etting information out of Majestic is likemilking a cow that’s dry.” - Richard M. NixonDID YOU HEAR EITHER NIXON OR EISENHOWER EVER USE THE TERM ‘MJ-12’OR ‘MAJESTIC 12’? [ Twelve military, business men and scientists appointed by Trumanto study the UFO phenomenon in 1947. See Majestic Documents website below.]Nixon used the term ‘Majestic.’ He said that Majestic started this thing and were the firstpeople who started it in the 1940s. Nixon said, ‘Getting information out of Majestic is likemilking a cow that’s dry.’NIXON REALLY SAID THAT?Ye s .IN THE FALL 1958 WHITE HOUSE MEETING?Ye s .BUT HE’S VICE PRESIDENT. DIDN’T YOU ALL TALK WITH HIM ABOUT WHY HEAND PRESIDENT EISENHOWER COULD NOT SIMPLY ORDER ALL MAJESTIC-12INFORMATION TO BE DELIVERED TO THE AMERICAN LEADERS?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"No.IF PRESIDENT EISENHOWER WAS FRUSTRATED AND WANTED TO GET TO THEBOTTOM OF THE ALIEN PHENOMENON, WHY COULDN’T HE ORDER EVERYSINGLE PIECE OF INFORMATION THAT MAJESTIC-12 HAD?Well, I know that at the last spring 1959 meeting I had with them, President Eisenhoweractually said, ‘We need new USAF people on this. We can’t continue in the same mode weare in. We aren’t accomplishing a thing. We don’t know anything more than we did in thelate 1940s and we need new people.’When we walked out of the Oval Office, the USAF colonel in that particular meeting said,‘Boy, I guess I’m fired!’ (laughs)IN EITHER THE FALL 1958 MEETING WITH NIXON ALONE, OR THE SPRING1959 MEETING WITH EISENHOWER AND NIXON TOGETHER, DID ANYONEBRING UP THE GERMAN VRIL CRAFT?No. In the spring meeting of 1959, that was the last meeting we had that I attended. Wenever went back. After that, Anthony Barden was just sending reports on what he had toCIA headquarters and they in turn were taking the reports to the White House.In the spring 1959 meeting that only lasted about twenty-five minutes, we just showedEisenhower and Nixon aerial views that we had. We had one over Puerto Rico that I saidlooked like a German craft. I said to the President and Vice President, ‘This looks like aHaunebu II German craft.’” ontinued in Part 17 - Spring 1959 meeting with Ike and Nixon at FBI Headquarters.Return to Part 1Return to Part 15More Information:or further information about 1947 Roswell UFO crashes and retrievals, please see mybooks in the Earthfiles Shop and reports below in the Earthfiles Archive:• 10/31/2008 — Strange Lights Chased by Jets Again October 29, Over Stephenville, Texas,and Crystalline Triangle in Ohio• 10/30/2008 — More Encounters with Glowing Humanoids, Green Orbs, Strange AerialLi ghts and “Thunderbi r ds”• 10/28/2008 — More Strange Aerial Lights Seen Over Stephenville and Dublin, Texas• 10/10/2008 — Part 1: Two Pennsylvania Hunters Encountered Strange Lights and LimeGreen, Glow ing Humanoid on Oct. 4• 10/03/2008 — Mother and Son Watched Cow Rise In Golden-Orange Beam to Disc• 09/23/2008 — AH-1W SuperCobra Helicopters and Glowing Sphere• 08/26/2008 — Update: Earthfiles Viewer Comments About UFOs and 14th Century BlackDeath• 08/22/2008 — UFOs and 14th Century Black Death• 08/09/2008 — Part 5: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo, Project JEHOVAH andPhysi ci sts Oppenhei mer and Ei nstei n• 08/06/2008 — Updated - Part 3: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo Links Government UFOCover-Up and JFK Assassination• 08/06/2008 — Part 4: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo Links Government UFO Cover-Upand JFK Assassination• 07/26/2008 — Part 1: Why No Military Response to Radar Unknown Headed to BushCrawford Ranch on January 8, 2008?• 07/25/2008 — Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell Says Governments Covering Up E.
