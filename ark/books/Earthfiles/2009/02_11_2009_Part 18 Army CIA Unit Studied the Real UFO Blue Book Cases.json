Kennedy.In June 1959, Stein and Anthony Barden were very surprised to receive a file fromArgentinean intelligence authorities with a photograph of a mutilated steer and a requestfor whatever information the American CIA had about the animal mutilation phenomenon.Some background about Argentina animal mutilations. If you include Stein's account, therehave been Argentina government investigations of the unusual, bloodless, trackless animaldeaths since at least the 1950s to the current day. For reasons unknown, between 2002 and2005, more than three thousand cases of animal mutilations were reported to Argentinaauthorities. Those reports included necropsies by veterinarians in which the unusualexcisions of tissue were described as cut with high heat by an unknown instrument.

That was unusual because that was the first government paperwork we hadreceived from Argentina’s version of their FBI. For some reason, that Argentina unit sent areport to the CIA headquarters in Washington, D. C., about a cattle mutilation and askedfor more information from us.DO YOU REMEMBER ANY OF THE DETAILS AND IF THERE WEREPHOTOGRAPHS?Headquarters sent the file to us, but the only photograph was not very good. You wouldthink the Argentina investigators would have done good close-ups, but the steer was onlyphotographed in a wide shot with the abdomen facing the camera. You could see that thecow's tongue and eyes were out. The stomach, or udder, was removed. There was no walkaround the animal to see different angles. There were no good, close-up photographs of theexcisions.WHAT RESPONSE DID YOUR CIA TEAM GIVE ARGENTINA?We sent a person to Argentina who spoke Spanish. He called ahead of time and talked withthe Argentina authorities. Our guy told Argentina what kind of information we werelooking for and he was told by the Argentina office that the report sent to the CIA was notthe first animal mutilation Argentina had. There were others, but the authorities therewanted to know what information the American CIA had on the animal mutilations.We told them that as far as American animal mutilations, we would have to turn theinquiry over to the U.S. Air Force and FBI as far as gathering information. We toldArgentina we would do that and we sent the USAF and FBI a copy of the Argentina filewith the statement that our CIA office would get back to the Argentina authorities after welearned more about how many American animal mutilations had been reported.We sent the Argentina file to the USAF and to the CIA Project Blue Book in Washington,D. C. We said that Argentina wanted more information because Argentina had severalanimal mutilations over some period of time and wanted to find out more about thephenomenon. 1959 Aerial Photos of SubmarinesOn Argentina's Parana RiverAt that time in June 1959, I did see aerial shots of Argentina and there were severalsubmarines right along the main north to south river from Paraguay into Argentina. Andthe submarine location was north up the river, still in Argentina. [ Editor’s Note: Paraguay River and Parana River join together in ParanaRiver in Argentina. Wikipedia reports: “The Paraná River in south centralSouth America runs through Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina over a course ofsome 1,600 miles (2,570 kilometers). This length increases to 2,484 miles ifthe distance is counted from the headwaters of the Paranaiba River in Brazil.The Parana River is considered second in size only to the Amazon Riveramong South American rivers. The name Paraná comes from the Tupilanguage and means ‘as big as the sea.’” ]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"On the aerial photos, we could see submarine pens and there were big hangar-typebuildings, a big complex.OUR AMERICAN SATELLITE PHOTO?I think it was a U-2 photo at that time in June 1959.The Lockheed U-2R/TR-1 took its first high altitude flighton August 1, 1955. Image courtesy USAF.YOU COULD ACTUALLY SEE SUBMARINES IN THE AERIAL PHOTOGRAPH?Yes, I think it was four or five submarines, submarine pens and empty pens also. Therewere good-sized hangar and complex buildings and smaller office buildings.WOULDN’T THE CIA HAVE HAD FIELD AGENTS ON THE GROUND INARGENTINA WORKING TO IDENTIFY THE COMPLEX?We always had field agents investigating, but whatever was behind that Argentinainstallation had to have severe security measures around it to pick up anyone trying toapproach from land, water or air. The only photographs we ever received were from highup, such as the U-2, and from a boat on the river. We never landed there because it washeavily guarded by people in Argentina uniforms, but we assumed the installation wasNazi-controlled. Were Submarines On Argentina RiverUnder Nazi Control?IN 1959, AS FAR AS THE AMERICAN CIA AND OTHER INTELLIGENCEAGENCIES WERE CONCERNED, THE GERMAN NAZI CONTINGENCY WAS STILLPRESENT AND VIABLE IN ARGENTINA WITH SUBMARINES?Yes, but the submarines did not have Nazi symbols on them – only serial numbers.However, we knew they were definitely identified as German-type submarines from theend of WWII.WAS THERE EVER ANY INTELLIGENCE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THESTRATEGY SHOULD BE CONCERNING GERMAN NAZI TECHNOLOGY?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"When we tried to get more information about the Argentina submarine complex, we werealways shot down. The CIA wanted to keep flying U-2s over there, but we always weretold by CIA headquarters that we couldn’t get the OK to do anything in Argentina. Weassumed it was part of the secret agreement that Anthony Barden and I found in thebasement library at CIA headquarters in Washington, D. C. - that essentially Argentina wasoff limits. That’s why we only had a few U-2 aerials and a few river shots taken by peoplewho were CIA, but we always heard that the CIA headquarters said to our Blue Booksuperiors, ‘Don’t send anyone into Argentina.’That’s why we were so shocked when we received the cattle mutilation photograph andfile from Argentina and a disc photograph taken in Argentina, similar to the disc overPuerto Rico that we showed Eisenhower and Nixon. Remember that Eisenhower knewabout the Hitler/Nazi disc craft and we operated with the understanding that it was stillHitler’s Nazi saucers and game in Argentina, no matter where Hitler was, dead or alive.Also, there was a big German population that moved to Argentina in the 1920s and 1930sand to Chile and other areas in South America. After JFK Elected PresidentIN THE TRANSITION FROM EISENHOWER TO KENNEDY, DID ANYTHINGSPECIAL OCCUR IN YOUR CIA GROUP?After Kennedy got in, we still kept getting UFO-related material in the same manner, butwe had no more direct contact with the White House after our joint meeting withEisenhower and Nixon.WHY NOT?We were told to call Nixon on any important photographs or anything else outstanding andnothing more really was. In that last year of 1959 to 1960, Eisenhower was leaving theWhite House. Anthony Barden and our group didn’t have any specific contact in theKennedy Administration, so we reported only to CIA headquarters.John Fitzgerald “Jack” Kennedy,35th President of the United States, January 20, 1961, toNovember 22, 1963, when assassinated in Dallas, Texas.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - Allen Welsh Dulles (born April 7, 1893, and diedJanuary 29, 1969) was the first civilian Director of the Central IntelligenceAgency from 1953 to 1961 and was the longest serving CIA Director andbecame a member of the Kennedy Assassination Warren Commission.Between stints of government service, Dulles was a corporate lawyer andpartner at Sullivan & Cromwell, LLP."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Allen Welsh Dulles (April 7, 1893 – January 29, 1969),first civilian Director of the Central Intelligence Agency followingGen.

An earlyfoe of Adolf Hitler, Dulles was transferred from Britain to Berne Switzerlandduring WWII where he became the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) stationchief, the precursor to the CIA. Dulles spied on Nazi Germany plans andactivities. Dulles established wide contacts with German émigrés, resistancefigures, and anti-Nazi intelligence officers who gave him reports ondevelopments in Germany, including accurate warnings about plans forHitler’s V-1 and V-2 missiles.After the war ended in 1945, Dulles served for six months as the OSS Berlinstation chief.

By that time, we had so many rotten apples inthe CIA barrel – so many double agents – that I did not want to be part of ‘shooting pigs ina poke,’ I told him. You never knew who was going to try to wipe you out next. So, Iwanted out.Anthony said, ‘I can’t blame you for that. If I could get out, I would.’I asked him, ‘Why can’t you get out?’He told me, ‘I could resign. I’ve been in there (CIA) long enough to retire, but I don’twant to retire,’ he said until a certain date – I think he said 1964 or 1965. ‘I want to workthat length of time and then get out.’But, Anthony Barden never did get out of the CIA. He died of a heart attack.DID HE EXPLAIN WHY HE COULDN’T GET OUT IN 1960?He just said, ‘Once you’ve been in this (CIA) too long – like I’ve been in this for so long –if you get out and you have all this information, your chances are slim. Do you know whatI’m talking about [ implying his life would be terminated under orders ]?I said, ‘Yes, I can see that. I haven’t been in very long at all, but I think if I stayed in mychances of surviving would be less than slim!’"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Anthony said, ‘I’ve always had a plan and never used it. But we have a plan we can usewhen you get out. We’re going to handle it in such a way that you are officially dead.’I said, ‘How are you going to make me officially dead? Are you going to shoot me in thehead?’He said, ‘No. You have your CIA identification. In July, in order to let you survive gettingout of the Army and CIA, we’re going to find a derelict who has died of dehydration in thestreets. We’re going to get one of the unidentified corpses that the local police departmenthas and we’re going to put your CIA I.D. on the unidentified corpse and then cremate thebody. We’ll also create a will to establish your request for cremation and your request tohave your ashes spread in the (city's nearby river).’I said, ‘That sounds like a good idea.’Anthony said, ‘We’ll do this a few days or a week after you’re out of our CIA unit – that’swhen you’ll be ‘dead.’I told him, ‘Well, I might be really dead anyway!’ And we laughed, but he told me, ‘No, Idon’t think so.When I got out on July 29, 1960, Anthony Barden did exactly his plan to have me ‘die.’ Infact, the police department had picked up an unidentified corpse and the policeman calledAnthony to let him know they had a corpse. Then Anthony called a certain person in thepolice department to arrange placing all my identification, except my photo badge, on thecorpse. What they put on the body was my social security card and a few other identifiers.The police department's inside plant then made a report about finding my identificationinside the lining of the dead man’s coat, along with the CIA-prepared, phony will that saidI wanted to be cremated and my ashes thrown into the nearby river.That body was cremated, the ashes were thrown into the river and an official deathcertificate with my CIA phony name was prepared along with my phony CIA socialsecurity number.DID YOU RECEIVE A COPY OF YOUR ‘DEATH CERTIFICATE?’No.I WONDERED IF ANTHONY BARDEN SENT IT TO YOU?One time later, I decided to check on my phony CIA name in terms of death certificates.That was much later on when I was trying to get into the V. A. hospital for surgery. I askeda clerk who was there if he could check a service number of a friend of mine in service –that I had lost contact with him. I wondered if the V. A. could find an address for me. Thehospital clerk said, ‘I’m not supposed to do this, but I’ll try to pull a file on the computer.’He punched up my old fake CIA social security number and name and said, ‘I’m sorry totell you this, but he died August 3, 1960.’I told the clerk I appreciated knowing that and I further checked another way and foundout that my CIA cover name was ‘officially dead.’ [ Stein went into private business andmoved up north in the United States. ]LATER IN CIVILIAN LIFE, WHEN YOU TRIED TO GET YOUR CIA RECORDS,WHAT HAPPENED?I tried to get my own records with my real name to see if they had a file or DD-214 on myphony CIA name.DID YOU CONTACT ST.

You asked me if you could interview me for radio.I said I would have to give it some thought, whether I wanted to be on the radio or not.A month later, you called me again on May 30, 1998. At the time, I told you I would giveyou permission to interview me for radio (on May 31 to June 1, 1998, Dreamland andCoast to Coast AM with Art Bell) as long as my real name and location were not given andthat you could not talk about three areas I was warned about in an anonymous phone call.WHEN I CALLED YOU ON MAY 30, 1998, I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR YOU TELLME, ‘I THINK YOUR PHONE IS TAPPED.’Yeah, I was trying to figure out how to get in touch with you to tell you your phone istapped without letting the tappers know!I SAID, ‘WHAT DO YOU MEAN?’I told you that I received a phone call from a male individual who did not say who he wasand did not identify from where he was calling and said to me that he heard I had talked tosomeone in Pennsylvania in regard to some previously classified materials. [ LindaMoulton Howe lived and worked in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1998.] The caller toldme there were several things that he hoped I would not elaborate about that I mentioned to(Linda Moulton Howe) on the phone. Those specifics were:The name of the military base in the southeastern United States.1.The hit squad that worked for the CIA and was stationed at that base.2.The routing of spy planes from that base to Cuba and back through Texas.3.The anonymous caller said that discussion of those three issues publicly could causeconsiderable problems for ... (CIA?).BECAUSE?Reporters might try to reach the military base to dig into files and this could be a majorproblem.YOU TOLD ME BACK IN MAY THAT THE CALLER SAID THOSE PEOPLE ‘MIGHTCOME TO HARM.’Yes, anyone who tried to enter classified areas could be harmed physically.DID YOU ASK THE CALLER, ‘WHO ARE YOU?’Yes, and he didn’t answer me, but he asked me if I would repeat to him what information‘they’ did not want on the air. Then I repeated the three issues and said, ‘I can’t really seethe justification about most of this because it’s all so old.’He said, ‘There are reasons for why these three particular issues are sensitive and I can’ttell you. We would appreciate it if you don’t talk about those three things.’ And then hehung up. Phone Company Executive ConfirmsCaller Was from Wackenhut"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"I had a friend who has worked years for the phone company who found out that the call tome had come from the East Coast of Florida, from the Coral Gables area. The call wasmade from the Wackenhut Corporation in Coral Gables.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “The Wackenhut Corporation is a privatesecurity and investigation firm based in the United States with otherheadquarters in Europe and other international locations. Wackenhut wasfounded in 1954, in Coral Gables, Florida, by George Wackenhut and threepartners, all former FBI agents. Wackenhut is now headquartered in PalmBeach Gardens, Florida.In 2002, the company was purchased for $570 million by Danish corporationGroup 4 Falck, now known as Group 4 Securicor. G4S plc (formerly Group 4Securicor) is the world's largest security services provider. Its services includemanned security, operation of criminal justice systems, electronic securitysystems, and financial services including cash transfer. It is listed on theLondon Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. At thetime of this purchase, the Wackenhut Corporation operated in 54 countries,had $2.8 billion in revenue, and its founder had control over more than 50%of its stock.The company has supplied complete police services at the Tampa Airport andpre-departure security at several other airports, plus security for courthousesin Texas and Florida; armed patrols for the Miami Downtown DevelopmentAuthority; guards to ride the Miami Metro Rail and the Tri-Rail from WestPalm Beach to Dade County and other assignments. In addition to security,the company also provides fire and rescue services for some clients, includingthe Kennedy Space Center.” ]Then, when you did do the radio interview broadcast of me on May 31 and June 1, 1998,you did comply and blanked out all the specific information I had previously given youabout the three issues the Wackenhut caller warned me about. That way, you and I wereletting them know that we were following their instructions, but getting the rest of the storyout to the public.THE CALLER NEVER REQUESTED THAT YOU NOT DISCUSS THE ALIEN BEINGSAND CRAFT?Nothing along those lines, just the three issues. May I give you my guess about why I thinkthose three issues were still so sensitive in 1998? My guess would be because of the U-2flights that originated in the southeastern state, which was TOP SECRET. That was fromthe very classified area, the little airport within the military base.Further, my guess would be that Wackenhut Corp. has a man working out of that classifiedsoutheastern military base as far as the black trucks, helicopters and retrievals of aliencraft that might come down. In other words, Wackenhut is working with a TOP SECRETgovernment operation to retrieve alien technologies and entities.Also, a friend of mine who was flying over within ten miles of our secret U-2 base back inthe late 1950s, he was just looking over in that direction at a plane taking off. Then he sawflashes of light coming up tremendously fast into the air right from that area, so hewondered if there might were a Star Wars-type ground-to-satellite experimentation with agoal to shoot down satellites from the southeastern base. By 1998, that would still behighly classified. The airfield there is not known to most people and is well-hidden withoutaccess roads. Stein's Effort to Get Paper Copyof Wackenhut Caller's Phone NumberIN THAT SECOND PHONE CALL TO YOU ON MAY 30, 1998, I SAID TO YOU, ‘YOUNEED TO TRY TO GET THE WACKENHUT SOURCE OF THE PHONE CALL ONPAPER IN A PAPER TRAIL WITH THE PHONE COMPANY.’ WHAT HAPPENED?Right. My long-time friend at the phone company got into the computer to print out apaper trail for me of the anonymous caller's number he had confirmed as Wackenhut,Coral Gables. But because my friend was not supposed to be in that particular computerarea, he sneaked in again to retrieve the phone number of the Wackenhut person whocalled me. To my friend's astonishment, the phone number no longer showed in the phonecompany computer list."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"He called me back to tell me and I asked him if there was any way he could find otherrecords that would show where the phone number originated on the East Coast. My friendhad called someone who worked in his boss’s office and the boss’s office person said shewould see what the East Coast operator might find. They did check and found nothing onthat end. She said, ‘When this phone number was erased – which is most likely whathappened – it would have been done by someone working right in the top echelon officesof the phone company, which is Sprint down here.’ No one else from an outside computercould get in to erase a phone number specifically because there are security systems thatare regularly changed for protection.SO THE WACKENHUT SELECTIVE CHANGE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEENDONE BY A MANAGER IN THE SPRINT EXECUTIVE OFFICES IN FLORIDA?I would imagine it was handled out of Ft. Lauderdale, which is a larger town.NOT CORAL GABLES?Maybe not. And knowing that all this was being done by Wackenhut and probably theCIA, you can conclude that Wackenhut and the CIA have what you can call ‘paidinfiltrators’ on payroll inside phone companies. So, when emergency issues like this comealong, the infiltrator that monitors would call whatever its headquarters and in a fewminutes, whatever the issue is, it is taken care of. In my case, it was the anonymous phonecaller.I DIDN’T ASK YOU TO GET A PAPER COPY OF THE WACKENHUT PHONENUMBER UNTIL MONDAY, JUNE 1, 1998. THAT MEANS SOMEONE WASLISTENING TO OUR PHONE CALL ON MAY 30TH IN ORDER FOR THE NUMBERTO DISAPPEAR.Yes, in our phone conversation on May 30, I mentioned to you that my phone companyfriend confirmed it was a Wackenhut phone number from Coral Gables, Florida. Assumingyour? Mine? Both of our phones were tapped and someone tapping called right down tocompany headquarters. It’s possible some ‘insider executive’ working for Wackenhut/CIAwent in at night and erased the phone number.THE FACT THAT CAN HAPPEN, WHAT DOES IT SAY ABOUT THE UNITEDSTATES?Wackenhut is a company that has been covering up a lot of classified things for years.DID YOU KNOW ABOUT WACKENHUT CORP. BACK IN THE LATE 1950s?Yes, I did. If we had some individuals that were coming in to our southeastern militarybase – because sometimes we had civilians that would sometimes visit, not in our classifiedfiles, but to do general work. We could call Wackenhut for background checks on civilianscoming to do work. Wackenhut is a worldwide security firm with offices in Europe.” Continued in Part 19 - Other intimidations.Return to Part 1Return to Part 17More Information:For further information about American government secrets about the non-humanphenomena and assassination of John F.
