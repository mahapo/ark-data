Return to April 17, 2009 Earthfiles.April 19, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - On Friday, April 17, 2009, after postingthe Earthfiles report, “Spider-Like ‘Drone’ Photographed Over Petten, Holland,” Ireceived communication from a Netherlands resident now working in Beijing, China, aboutthe Earthfiles report. He discussed the nuclear reactor facility in Petten, only one of threein the Netherlands and one of the world's most important producers of isotopes for medicaluses. I asked Ruud Schmidt if he knew about the reactor and he said that he and his familyonly think of Petten as a recreational campground.1) Subject: Regarding the Dutch Dragonfly DroneDate: April 17, 2009To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“ I am a Dutch guy living and working in Beijing, China. I was reading aboutthe Dutch drone case on your site. I'm pretty familiar with the area where thesighting took place. I don't know if you are aware of this, but Petten, wherethe sighting took place, is also the location of a nuclear research facility:Wikipidia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petten_nuclear_reactorLocation: http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=petten+nuclear&ie=UTF8&ll=52.787717,4.678202&spn=0.003342,0.009656&t=h&z=17The Netherlands has only three nuclear facilities. There's a big commercialnuclear power plant in the southwest of the country, a small research reactorat the technical university in Delft and the facility in Petten. Therefore Ithought it rather interesting that a drone would turn up in Petten of all places.Except for the reactor there's really nothing of interest there. It's mainly arecreation zone.The Petten facility is rather controversial. Through the years there have beensafety problems and some people who have worked there have died young ofrare types of cancer, including the father of a colleague of mine who hadworked there for many years as a nuclear scientist. The facility is somewhatshrouded in mystery. Although the Petten nuclear facility plays an important"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"role in producing isotopes for medical use in Europe, there is also cutting edgesecret research going on there. The drone could be spying, but it might just aswell be theirs!I just want to emphasize again that I feel very strongly that there must be aconnection between the drone and the facility. Petten is an important placeand plays a strategic role in European energy research. The facility is not evenowned by the Dutch government, but by the European Commission. Theresearch being done there is not only related to nuclear energy but other typesof energy as well. For example, there's groundbreaking research being done inthe field fuel cells for example. I used to know a guy who works there on fuelcells. Check this link:http://www.ecn.nl/en/For what it's worth, my opinion is that the drone is American and engaged inespionage. If I were the American government, I would want to know whathappens in Petten.”I also found a National Radio Report (NPR) dated October 15, 2008, only six months ago,about the Petten nuclear reactor to restart on February 16, 2009, after many weeks offline.NPR reported:“The Petten unit is one of a few reactors that maintains global medical isotopesupplies. Traces of gas bubbles were detected in the primary cooling system ofthe High Flux Reactor (HFR) at Petten in the Netherlands during the course ofan August 2008 inspection. NRG described the finding as an ‘anomaly’ at thetime, and explained that the bubbles were caused by corrosion of the pipework of the primary cooling system.High Flux Reactor (HFR) during operationin Petten, Holland. Image source: NPR.“On August 21, 2008, NRG decided not to start up the reactor at the end ofthe month-long major maintenance and inspection program. ... HFR i thesource of 30-40% of the world's medical isotopes, which are used in a varietyof imaging procedures for diagnosis as well as radiotherapy. A key productfrom HFR is molybdenum-99, which decays into technetium-99m, used formedical imaging. Molytbdenum-99 has a half-life of just 66 hours, sodeliveries to hospitals need to be regular and frequent.”The Petten problem highlighted the global shortage of isotope production when the onlyavailable reactor in Europe with production capacity was coupled to the only availableproduction line left in Europe at the Osiris reactor in France. 2) Subject: Strange SimilarityDate: April 19, 2009To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“Dear Linda,The attached pics are only suggestive, but something to consider? I walkedthrough that crop formation, while Charles arrived on his bicycle andinspected it. But hundreds of people had just come through on a tour group, sothere was no way to tell whether it might be real or fake.”“Sit down before fact like a little child, and follow wherever it leads, or elseyou will learn nothing.”"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Left: Wheat formation reported July 27, 2008, in East Field, Wiltshire County, England.Image source: Cropcircleconnector.com.
