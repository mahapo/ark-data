Cosmic RaysIn addition to solar particles, another highly energetic particle from the Milky Way galaxyreaches Earth's atmosphere all the time. Cosmic rays can damage electronic systems andeven DNA in living creatures.When a high-energy cosmic ray enters the atmosphere,it can cause an “air shower.” The cosmic ray hits a moleculein the atmosphere and “breaks up,” producing lots more sub-atomicparticles. The cosmic ray (red center top) breaks up into sub-atomic particlesthat can include protons (green), neutrons (orange), pions (yellow),muons (purple), photons (blue), and electrons & positrons (pink).Illustration by Randy Russell, NASA and NCAR.The number of cosmic rays reaching Earth are lower when the sun is active and has astrong, turbulent magnetic field that interferes with cosmic ray travel. But when the sun isnot active, more cosmic rays reach Earth. The sun is supposed to be in an increasinglyactive period of Solar Cycle 24 with a solar maximum originally expected in 2011 to 2012.But the sun has been abnormally quiet. Scientists have not seen such a low sunspotnumber since around 1913, the beginning of the 20th Century. Further, the magnetic fieldof the sun is at the lowest magnetic field strength measured in at least fifty years from thebeginning of the Space Age.A collision between a high-energy cosmic ray particle and an atomin a photographic emulsion, as viewed through a microscope.Image credit: NASA, Dr. David P. Stern.At the August 3 to 7, 2009, at the Solar Heliospheric and Interplanetary Environment(SHINE) meeting in Wolfville, Nova Scotia, Richard Mewaldt, Ph.D., Senior ResearchAssociate in Physics at the California Institute of Technology Kahill AstrophysicsLaboratory in Pasadena, presented his latest ACE data on cosmic ray intensity changesince April 2009, the last six months.Interview:Richard Mewaldt, Ph.D., Senior Research Associate in Physics, California InstituteofTechnology, Pasadena, California: “What we’ve measured is that over the past sixmonths or so, the cosmic ray intensity has been about 19% higher than it was at any othertime in the Space Era. We can track this back to solar minima in 1965, using spacecraftdata. The amount is out of the box that we thought cosmic rays were in. It’s a higherintensity for all the elements in the periodic table that make up cosmic rays – we canmeasure them all the way from helium up through iron and the intensity of all of theseelements has increased."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"One thing that we notice is that this intensity is correlated with the so-called tilt of thesolar magnetic fields. The solar wind carries out the sun’s magnetic field that excludes thecosmic rays because they are scattered and deflected by the magnetic field, which is nowweaker.On a shorter time scale, when that tilt increases, there is pattern we refer to as a ‘ballerinaskirt’ as the solar wind carries the magnetic field out. It means that if the cosmic rayscoming in are going along the folds in the skirt and that’s a longer distance than if it wereflat.Right now, the tilt has reduced to about 20 degrees and it has gotten much lower duringprevious solar minimum, down to 5 or 10 degrees. We think if the tilt of the sun’s solarmagnetic fields continue to decline over the next few months or year, the intensity ofcosmic rays reaching Earth will go up even more – perhaps from 19% to even 30% morethan we have ever observed in the Space Age.THAT IS UNPRECEDENTED IN THE MODERN AGE?It’s unprecedented in the modern age, but we actually do have some records of whatcosmic rays have done over the past thousand years or so. That’s because when cosmicrays hit the top of the atmosphere, they produce some radioactive isotopes such asberyllium-10 and carbon-14, which then precipitate out of the atmosphere and they end upin the polar ice, both in Antarctica and the Arctic.Ice Core sample taken from drill.Photo by Lonnie Thompson, Byrd Polar Research Center.By taking an ice core that goes back for centuries, scientists can measure how much of theradio isotopes are present in very thin layers of the ice core and they can trace back solarcycles that go over a thousand years. It turns out that the activity over the past 50 years ofthe Space Era has actually been on average much lower than it has been over the pastthousand years. Maunder Minimum, 1654 to 171570 years of very few sunspots and “Mini Ice Age”Between 1645 and 1715, the Maunder Minimum coincided with a periodof lower-than-average global temperatures. During one 30-year period within theMaunder Minimum, astronomers observed only about 50 sunspots, as opposedto a more typical 40,000–50,000 sunspots in modern times.You’ve perhaps heard of the Maunder Minimum? It’s a time when the sun was very quiet in 1645 to 1715. Cosmic ray intensity then was about 2.5 times higher than it has been attypical solar minima we’ve experienced during the modern Space Era."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"We’ve had satellites up there (since 1960s) during a time that’s been relatively quiet as faras cosmic rays are concerned, which means our sun has been more active than averageover history. Maybe things are just coming back to a more normal state?WHAT IS THE HIGHEST INTENSITY OF COSMIC RAYS YOU HAVE BEEN ABLETO FIND IN ICE CORES?I think it’s about 2 times what we had before this recent climb in the past six months up19% and this increase so far is roughly twice as high as the past 50 years until now.WAS THAT INTENSITY OF COSMIC RAYS IN THE PAST ONLY DURING THEMAUNDER MINIMUM?No, most of the time in the ice cores, it was higher than what we've experienced the past50 years in the Space Age. The Maunder Minimum was probably the highest.IS IT FAIR TO CONCLUDE THAT THE ICE CORES INDICATE OUR SUN HAS BEENLESS ACTIVE IN THE PAST?Yes, I think that’s a fair and logical conclusion – the sun has been much less active like theMaunder Minimum and it does seem to occur in cycles, maybe every 200 years or so thesun is less active. So, we just started going into space at a time when the sun was moreactive than usual and the cosmic rays were lower. Impacts of IncreasedCosmic Rays on Earth Life?IF COSMIC RAYS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE TO POSSIBLY 30%MORE INTENSITY, WHAT WOULD THE IMPACT BE ON EARTH LIFE?Astronauts, in particular, if they were trying to take a trip to Mars would definitely beaffected. To a lesser extent, space hardware is also affected by cosmic rays because therays can cause electronic circuits to fail.A factor of 2 increase in cosmic ray intensity would make a big difference for astronautsbecause if we look at what the radiation levels are even if cosmic rays did not increase, itwould be a difficult trip for astronauts. They would be encountering significantly increasedchances of getting cancer and other complications later on in their life.Whether or not cosmic rays play a role in other aspects of Earth’s climate is a verycontroversial issue that people are investigating, but I don’t think we can say definitelycosmic rays lead to those affects.ASTRONAUTS WOULD HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT INCREASED SOLARRADIATION GETTING TO THEM IN WHATEVER SPACE VEHICLE THEYTRAVELED IN AND COSMIC RAYS ARE KNOWN TO CAUSE GENETICMUTATIONS IN DNThat’s true.ISN’T IT POSSIBLE THAT IF WE WERE MOVING INTO AN ERA OF INCREASINGCOSMIC RAYS AND A MORE QUIET SUN, WE COULD END UP WITH MORE DNAANOMALIES IN EARTH LIFE?I think there is an effect, but most of the radiation we get on Earth is from radioactivematerials in the air and soil, such as radon released by the decay of uranium and otherradioactive substances. That’s where people living on the Earth get most of their radiation– from those natural cause rather than from cosmic rays.But airline personnel that fly to Europe over the North Pole get a higher dose andstatistically, they would be at higher risk. Could the Sun EnterAnother Maunder Minimum Now?IS IT POSSIBLE WE COULD BE MOVING INTO ANOTHER MAUNDER MINIMUMNOW?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"It’s always possible. A couple of years of abnormal activity might not be significant yet. Inanother five years, the sun might return to what we’ve seen. Or in the next solar cycle, thesun might be even less active. Who knows?BUT IF OUR SUN WERE TO GO INTO A MAUNDER MINIMUM NOW, THAT THESETHREE QUIET YEARS EXTEND FOR ANOTHER FIFTY, IS IT LIKELY THE EARTHWOULD COOL DOWN?That happened back then – an unusual climate.A MINI ICE AGE.That’s correct. One thing we know is happening now is that at high altitude, the density ofthe Earth’s atmosphere is shrinking. It’s like space is closing in on us. The fact that the sunis less active is causing the outer Van Allen belt of the Earth is much weaker than it hastypically been because the solar wind has been weaker. The solar wind sort of drives theradiation belts and they are all weaker right now. So far the sun has remained much morequiet for longer than we ever expected.RIGHT, AND IT’S BAFFLING SOLAR PHYSICISTS.Well, I think it’s baffling them alright, but part of it is we never had such goodmeasurements as we have now a hundred years ago. We know there was also a period in1913 when there was a very low sunspot number. The sun went for a hundred days or sobefore anyone observed a sunspot then. We are close to that level this time. That meansthere was evidence this unusual solar quiet has occurred before.So, now during the modern Space Era, we’re encountering new conditions. We’re learningthat the space environment that we thought we had a good handle on can vary more thanwe thought. It’s more unpredictable. The conditions in space and the effect the sun has onthe Earth, we’ve certainly moved into a new era that we haven’t experienced in the pastfifty years. An Unpredictable Sun MakesSpace Travel More DifficultAnother consequence of Solar Cycle 24 not acting like we expected is if we were going totry to plan a trip to Mars to avoid the most intense cosmic ray activity, we are learning it’sharder to predict when that will occur.WOULD ASTRONAUTS ON A TRIP TO MARS BE AWARE OF INCREASED COSMICRAYS?We would not know about galactic cosmic rays in that they can be passing through you allthe time and cause radiation affects on cells and DNA, but we’re not aware of it. I mean,it’s happening to us here on Earth also.A solar storm, we would probably be aware because there would be a radiation monitor onboard the spacecraft and they would know the radiation in a large solar event can go up afactor of a thousand for a day or so. Shields would be needed to protect them. Instrumentscan also have problems during intense solar activity. Communications become moredifficult during a big solar eruption.WHAT WOULD SYMPTOMS IN HUMANS BE IN A STRONG SOLAR RADIATIONEVENT?If you had a big solar event where particles were accelerated to high energies that last forseveral days, astronauts could experience radiation sickness. That would be nausea andthen disorientation as blood chemistry is affected. If the solar radiation were high enoughfor a long time, solar radiation can cause death. That’s why it’s important to have ashielded section of the spacecraft as the ISS has.HOW DO YOU SHIELD?Thicker shielding or fuel tanks that have fuel in them put matter in the way of the cosmicrays. Also, polyethylene (plastic) is a good shield because it has a lot of hydrogen atoms inits structure and that slows down solar energetic particles. The difference between solarenergetic particles and galactic cosmic rays is that solar particles maximum intensities arenot at very high energies. So putting material between you and that radiation will slow itdown and make it stop."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"But for highly energetic galactic cosmic rays, you can’t have enough shielding to keepthem out.IF A SPACE VEHICLE WERE MADE OUT OF STRONG PLASTIC, THAT WOULDSHIELD ASTRONAUTS ENOUGH?It would reduce the intensity so they would be safe enough, yes. Maybe the astronautquarters would be good to be constructed out of plastic inside a metal spacecraft.I’ve also seen press releases from NASA where they might be able to build local shieldinginto a space suit. You want to protect the blood forming organs and heavy bone marrowsuch as hips. Shielding in suits might work without adding to much weight to a spacecraft.WATER IN THE WALLS OF A SPACECRAFT – WOULD THAT BE AFFECTIVESHIELDING?Yes, water would be great.BUT IT’S HEAVY?Yes. But if you need water with you anyway, you might as well place it as a shield.IF WE CAN LAUNCH TO MARS, DO YOU THINK SCIENTISTS WILL KNOW IFTHE SHIELDING IS ADEQUATE FOR HUMANS?For galactic cosmic rays, I think we have measurements of how intense they are on Mars.We’ve sent numerous spacecraft out into the solar system and we know that cosmic raysgradually increase as you move out into the solar system. So, we would know that amount.For solar energetic particles, you can never predict what the sun is going to do, so theremight be an eruption that’s dangerous. But the further you go from the sun, distance wouldreduce the impact of a solar event the farther the astronauts were from the sun. And youwould get more warning because it would take longer for the solar energetic particles toget to you. With a warning, you could get to shielded sections of the spacecraft.”Our spotless sun on October 6, 2009 by SOHO.More Information:For further information about solar activity, please see reports below in the EarthfilesArchive:• 07/11/2009 — Update Podcast: Is Sudden Solar Intensity of July 5 - 7 What U.K. SpringCrop Formations Forecast for Oddly Quiet Sun?• 05/12/2009 — Part 3: Astronomical Information in U.K. 2009 Crop Formations?• 05/02/2009 — Long Minimums Usually Mean Weaker Maximums, But Sun Could Still HaveBig X-Flares in 2011 to 2012• 04/30/2009 — Part 2: First 2009 U.
