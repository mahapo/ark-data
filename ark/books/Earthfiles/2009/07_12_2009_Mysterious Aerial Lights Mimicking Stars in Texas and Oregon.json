Also, over the past two weeks in the Shady Hollow subdivision of southwesternAustin, there have been several bloodless, half-cat mutilations reported yet again.1) Subject: Drone in downtown Chicago, New Year's Eve 2005Date: May 23, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comLinda Moulton Howe,I read about the dragonfly drones on your Earthfiles.com site and it reminded me ofan experience I had 3 years ago. On New Years Eve in 2005 (December 31, 2005),my wife and I decided to go downtown Chicago and get a room at the W Hotel onLakeshore Drive.My parents were in town to watch our daughter at our condo. We were planning ongetting away for the night, drinking some champagne and ringing in the new year.After a meal and a few drinks (2 or 3 glasses of champagne), we went back to thehotel room around 10:30 PM or so.As my wife was getting changed, I was standing looking out of the window, which Ibelieve was facing south, making Lake Michigan on my left. I was looking into theother lit windows of the high-rises around, people-watching... when I saw somethingthat looked like it was hanging on the side of a building maybe 2 blocks away. Ithought at first it was a window washing scaffold, but noticed it was moving slowlyup on the right side of the building at a 45-degree angle.I realized what I was looking at was an object with a tail, hovering unattached to thebuilding. The tail pointed away from the building. It was not even close to lookinglike a helicopter as it had voids at the top and bottom that I could see with no rotors,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"no cockpit. I saw it for about a full 2 minutes before it ‘sparkled’ andde-materialized right before it turned the corner. I couldn't believe what I saw!I yelled for my wife to come look, but she couldn't get there in time. The photos Ihave seen of dragonfly drones on your Earthfiles website are similar, although Ithink this one was about the size of a Volkswagen beetle, judging by the size of theglass on the building. When it sparkled, it was faint, and definitely not like afirecracker. It flickered a few times before fading out.The skin itself was a weird charcoal-greyish matte finish, but there was definitely anunderlying glow to it that drew my attention there in the first place. I had theimpression this object was looking into the windows as well, but being very stealthy.It was an odd experience. I have never seen anything like that. I was wondering ifyou had received any other sightings like this. It seems most have been in ruralareas. This was right downtown Chicago. Maybe others saw it as well? Friday, July 10, 2009 - Unusual Moving Aerial LightsOver Dripping Springs, Texas, near Austin2) Subject: 7-10-09 moving lights / mimicking stars in Dripping Springs outside of Austin TXDate: July 11, 2009To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comLinda,My name is (name withheld at emailer's request). I wrote you on 5/23/08 about thedrone/object I witnessed next to a building on New Year's Eve when we lived inChicago around 2005.We now live in Dripping Springs Texas, 25 miles or so southwest of Austin Tx. Wemoved out here 3 years ago to get away from living in a city and to raise ourdaughter in nature. At night we get a little bit of light pollution from Austin, but forthe most part we can hang out on our porch or lay out on my daughter's trampolineand clearly view the Milky Way, stars and planets.Last night (Friday, July 10, 2009) my wife and I were laying out on the trampolinelocated on the east side of our house, admiring the stars around 11:00 p.m. after ourdaughter was well asleep. I usually take my 50 mw green laser that I use to point outconstellations, planets, satellites when we go out at night. It was a clear night with alittle bit of atmosphere from it being summer and small amount of light pollutionfrom Austin and the moon which had not risen above the tree line yet. Moving Blue Pinpoint Lights Form TriangleAt about 11:00 p.m. - 11:30 p.m., I noticed a small pinpoint of light movingsoutheast. I thought it was a satellite at first. I then immediately noticed anotherpinpoint of light following behind it. It was going the same direction and at the samespeed. My wife saw it as well when I pointed it out with the laser. We then both sawa third light appear moving the same direction and speed above the first two,forming a triangle. They were independent light sources (as we could see stars passbetween them). I am not sure of the speed. They were faint, but still visible enoughto discern that they were pale blue in color and looked to be at a really high altitude.We tracked them for about 30 or so seconds and then two more lights appeared,same speed and direction. One was higher up and further out in the sky than the 3flying in triangle formation, and the last was following far behind. It was going in thesame direction, but at a slower speed.My wife and I realized at that point the weight of what we were witnessing. Afterabout 15 seconds of tracking them across the sky, what looked to me to be a lightwith a pinkish hue appeared out of nowhere beneath the triangle formation and shotdue east from a standstill leaving a tracer-line of light behind it.We see a lot of meteorites shoot across the sky out out here at night. This was not ameteorite.At that point we both got very excited. I was still pointing my laser at them, andthen the one slower light trailing behind at the very end stopped and stayedmotionless! We were watching it as well as trying to keep up with the triangleformation as they still moved southeast. 90-Degree Rapid TurnAs the triangle formation moved further on, our surrounding cedar tree line wasencroaching, and they were about to move out of view. Just then, the pale blue light"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"following at the top of the triangle formation made an abrupt 90-degree turn as itshot due west. It was almost impossible to track it as it shot behind our house.At that point we lost track of the 3 blue lights flying in triangle formation. The onelight that had stopped stayed motionless for about 15 or more minutes as wewatched the sky looking for more. It was located about 15 degrees off a bright star.The light that stopped seemed to have gotten a little brighter and to be mimicking astar in the sky! The whole sighting took maybe two minutes from when we firstnoticed the first moving pinpoint of pale blue light to when we last saw the triangleof lights.The wind picked up a little, we heard some deer or critters making noises in thecedar grove on our property, and my wife got spooked so we went in. We did notsee anymore that evening.I will definitely go out again to watch the sky with my laser and a digital cameranext time.I am wondering if you have had any more reports of lights in the sky from our area?I have included a shot of our property facing the direction of sky where wewitnessed the lights. I used MS paint to draw the lights, text and directional arrows.It is a dusk shot of that direction of sky from a few months ago. It has been croppedand I adjusted the coloring on it to make it look darker for illustration purposes.July 10, 2009, Dripping Springs, TX Eyewitness: “Saw # 1 and # 2 appear first heading Southeast.Then # 3, # 4 and # 5 appeared in order heading Southeast the same direction.About the time # 5 came into view, we saw # 6 shoot due East at a high rate of speed out of nowhere. #5 then stopped and stayed motionless, ‘like mimicking a star.’# 4 appeared faint and shot due West at a high rate of speed. Total time of sighting:Approx. 2 minutes. Tracked from NE to SSE.” Graphic illustration by Texas eyewitness. More Aerial Lights MimickingStars Over Eastern OregonSubject: Aerial Lights That Mimic Stars and Interact with Observers!!!Date: June 23, 2009To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comLinda, I had a very unusual experience in the remote eastern Oregon desert, and I'dlike to report it as it coincides with your aerial lights that mimic stars Earthfilesreport.[ 060909 Earthfiles: Aerial Lights That Mimic Stars, Helicopters and Airplanes ]First, I have NEVER seen a UFO, except a couple the size of a penny once on amilitary base, and in dreams and meditation, where I've seen them regularly.But last week, at early dusk, my wife and I were camping in the remote desert ofeastern Oregon, nearest house miles away. We were discussing the massive numberof chemtrails that appeared over the area last time we were there, literally coveringthe sky as seemingly dozens of grey jets passed every few hours over an area off offlyroutes....I pointed out that there were no jets flying in the night sky this evening, whichseemed unusual since so many were observable by day during our last visit. And Ialso commented to my wife that I had NEVER seen a UFO, and I'd like to. As I saidthis, we were scanning the sky and I began pointing out things in the sky that wereNOT UFOs, like a small plane, and the flashing/twinkling stars on the horizon. Aswe watched one particularly bright twinkling star on the horizon over a period oftime, I explained to my wife that the atmospheric angle created refraction/distortion,creating a twinkling effect."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Three Aerial Lights Move into Triangle PatternThen it looked like it began to move just a little. But then the star beneath it beganto rise CLEARLY, so I immediately assumed it was a helicopter because it had heldposition for so long previously? Now the 3 “stars” on the horizon seemed to form aperfect triangle pattern, but the lower star kept rising.Linda, the star rose above the other two stars near it, one of which was the twinklingone! It took about two minutes for it to complete the smooth movement, coveringabout 3 feet total at arm's length.That star did not move again. None did for the rest of the night. They held positionas they disappeared over the horizon at the natural rate of earth's-rotation until theywere out of sight.Linda, it was MIMICKING a star! And it seemed to respond or show itself at mymention of UFOs. Moreover, after it clearly moved as we observed, it BECAME a‘star’ AGAIN.It blew me away. That moonless night, as I lay in my sleeping bag, looking at all thestars, including the now-stationary “ UFO,” I had the weirdest thought/feeling - thatwe had been lied to - that those lights up in the sky were not what we were told theywere. And in point of fact, we only \"know\" what they are from what we've beentold. That night, the entire universe seemed peopled with entities resembling stars,not the “stars” as science has described them to us.No UFO in its right mind would respond to the thoughts and feelings of a lil' monkeyon Earth. Clearly UFOs and monkeys are microcosms or part of something bigger,like an entity that encompasses us all.Anyway, that star moved and remained a star. Why the f--k would any “entity” dothat? It takes patience beyond the level of absurd to “mimick stars” over longperiods of time - especially to fool a common monkey. Why hold a high-techspacecraft in a star-mimicking position for hours to fool a single monkey? S--t, Iwon't even leave my engine running for a long stop light, much less waste hours ofruntime of a high-tech spacecraft to fool a monkey in a sleeping bag.Something verrrry weird is going down here. When stars are both stars and NOTstars, we have a re-mystified universe - just as it should be.I welcome other reports from Earthfiles viewers about unidentified aerial lights that seem to mimic stars,airplanes, helicopters and satellites.
