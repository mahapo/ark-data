S. Military Source Return to Part 1June 1, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuing in Part 10 with Linda MoultonHowe's 1983 to 1987 High Strangeness file notes about EBENs and other non-humanentities. The following are interview notes I wrote after a 1985 discussion with a militarysource who told me he had been to Pease AFB to view non-human bodies preserved infive vertical tubes of liquid hanging on a wall.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, NewHampshire, was a U.S. Air Force base under the control of the Strategic AirCommand (SAC) until 1991. Back in 1958, the 509th Bombardment Wingthat had been at Walker AFB, New Mexico, in 1958, and was the successor tothe famed 509th Composite Group of World War II that had executed thenuclear strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki moved to Pease AFB.” ] The509th BW was also involved in the retrieval of one or more non-human craftthat crashed, or were shot down, near Roswell and White Sands ProvingGround in July 1947. About his Pease AFB briefing: “It's strange, but inside those tubes, all the alien eyes wereclosed. Made me sad looking at them. I never thought we had kept any aliens since I hadbeen told before that we sent all the bodies we had back to the EBEN world in anhonorable exchange. But when I thought about it, I guess it made sense to me because theEBENs certainly have specimens of us humans in some capacity - in tubes, alive on theirplanet or even preserved somehow in holograms that I don't completely understand.”Howe: I had with me several drawings made by abductees I had interviewed. I put eachone slowly down one at a time on a desk and asked for his response - how close were anyof the drawings to what he had seen in the Pease AFB tubes?When I laid down the pastel color drawing of a pear-headed being wearing a very oddyellowish cape with multiple collars, he said, “ That's very close to what I was looking at.The bodies were about 4.5 feet tall. I could see what I'd call a vestigial penis on a couple ofthem. I say vestigial because I was told the EBENs don't need sexual intercourse toconceive - they can ‘think’ conception with their minds some how.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Pastel drawing done by Colorado man, a commercial artist,under deep hypnosis on July 5, 1984, in Boulder, Colorado.The man and his wife remembered a November 1980 incident in which the couple,while driving on a highway, were suddenly raised upward in a beam of light andexamined by non-humans. Hypnosis by UFO researcher, Richard Sigismund. Uponseeing his drawing, the man immediately said: “That's not right. They w ere grey!The paper is grey. It looks like I made him flesh-colored to contrast with the grey paper.”For whole story, see An Al i en Harvest © 1989 by Linda Moulton Howe in Earthfiles Shop.He also understood that the grey skin can change color, even fluoresce in varying lightintensities. Even though the Colorado illustration shows almost solid black-brown eyes, hesaid he had been told the EBENs actually have yellow eyes with vertical pupils like a cat'seyes. He had been told that at least some of them - since there seemed to be a large varietythat included cloned “ worker bees” and taller controlling intelligences - had three layers ofeyelids that moved across their cat eyes horizontally, not vertically like human lids. Hewas told that EBENs only communicate telepathically in a hive mind way - all of themknow exactly what's on everyone else's mind, including human minds. The mouth slitcontained only a membrane that absorbed nutrition, so it was not a chewing mouth. Theirfeet were small and a bit round, similar to hooves.He told me he saw another type preserved in a tube that was a little taller than 5.5 feetwith shoulder-length, straight blond hair, “almost thin straw-looking.” The eye lids wereclosed so he could not see the eyeballs, but he said the sockets under the closed lids weretwo to three times bigger than our human eyes. The nose was long and flat with deepgrooves on either side all the way up to the eyes. The cheek bones were very accentuated.The mouth looked somewhat human, but he didn't know if there were any teeth. He wasvery puzzled by the feet. Compared to human feet, he thought they were very small withshort little toes and the ball of the foot seemed to be almost spherical. “How could theywalk? Or do they float everywhere?” he wondered. He thought this blond type had a penisvery similar to a Home sapiens male.He had been told there were other types of non-humans beyond the two displayed on thePease AFB walls. He remembered an eerie story that took place on an aircraft carrier. AUFO landed on the deck and one of the sailors there was moved against his will “right intothe craft like through the wall. Whatever it was took the sailor, examined him behind aglass screen and then returned the sailor to the aircraft carrier by landing a second time onthe deck and letting the guy out! Then the craft took off straight up at tremendous speedand disappeared. The sailor said the being that examined him had veins popping out allover its head. He couldn't see a nose. The eyes reminded him of marbles like you play withas a kid - I don't know if he meant clear ones or opaque. The skin was really dark and thebeing was wearing a black suit with orange V-shaped areas on the sleeves and chest. Hesaid the alien was at least 5' 6\" to 5' 7 \" because that was the sailor's height.”As a military person, I asked him if he had any firsthand knowledge about there being adirect connection between where UFOs turn up in concentrations, or flaps, and upcomingworld events? Even as far back as 1985, it was becoming clear to me that the waves ofUFO activity seemed to precede wars, maybe even geological events such as earthquakes.Were the beings monitoring? Manipulating? Helping? Hurting? And what about the rumorthat there was a “secret war” going on between our American government insiders and theextraterrestrial biological entities?“I'm pretty sure some - maybe all - of the aliens don't want us or anyone on Earth to usenuclear weapons, so aliens interfere with our missiles. That might be what's behind thesecret war rumor. I don't know if anyone on our side really understands what any of themactually want. I also get the impression that the aliens have been around for a long time, so"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"they're pretty much going to do what they want whether humans ever understand.”November 17, 1980, SECRET AFOSI communication from Headquarters AFOSI Bolling AFB(Washington, D.
