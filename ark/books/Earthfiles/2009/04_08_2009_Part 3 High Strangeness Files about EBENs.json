Author andabductee experiencer, Lou Baldin, described details about a huge, complex space cityorbiting near Uranus in his second book published in 2008 entitled, A Day With AnExtraterrestrial. His first book, In League With A UFO © 1997, has important insightsinto alien technologies, cloning and genetic manipulation of bodies that look human, butare designed for alien control and monitoring.A Day With An Extraterrestrial© 2008 by Lou Baldin. Click to more information.The EBENS are also supposed to have a constructed base on the back side of the moon.Brian Scott, who interacted with non-humans in the late 1970s, wrote about an alien baseinside the moon, alien orbiters monitoring Earth and tall, red-haired, non-humans creatinga December 2012 drama that would change the world forever.Transformation of A Common Man:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The Brian Scott Story © 2003 by James E. Frazier.Click he re for more information.Scott was in his twenties at first contact in a California desert, but later he contactedScottish astronomer Duncan Lunan with mathematical code and diagrams given to Scottby the non-humans about the alien lunar base. Lunan recognized information in themathematical code that related to radio signals from the moon that Lunan was studying.Lunan even challenged Scott as perhaps having stolen some of Lunan's private work aboutthe Earth's moon. Scott insisted he had no idea what the math and diagrams meant and hadcontacted Lunan only because the non-humans had instructed Scott to contact DuncanLunan.Others have had alleged non-human communications that the moon is an alien-engineeredobject, built to a specific diameter and placed at a specific orbital distance from Earth inorder to produce precise eclipses of the sun and moon. [ See 011103Earthfiles. ]According to government insiders and people in the human abduction syndrome, there aremany non-human bases on Earth inside mountains, underground and literally beneath thebottoms of lakes, rivers and seas. One location repeatedly mentioned in the United Statesis inside Mount Shasta, California. That is supposed to be a tall blond base, not EBEN. InAlbuquerque, New Mexico, there are supposed to be at least two underground facilitiestrying to monitor non-human fly-overs and intrusions in nuclear facilities: one is beneathCoyote Canyon in the Manzano Mountains east of Kirtland AFB. The other is a buildingon Kirtland AFB disguised as a technical electronics facility that leads to an undergroundinstallation where a National Security Agency (NSA) group manages Project Sigma.Sigma's mission is to communicate when possible with non-human craft and entities.Sigma is supposed to be what Paul Bennewitz, physicist and owner of Thunder ScientificLaboratory in Albuquerque on the edge of Kirtland AFB stumbled into with his 8mmfilming of unidentified aerial objects and monitoring unusual frequencies which he plottedwith a computer. Bennewitz and his lab subcontracted on physics projects with SandiaLabs, Phillips Labs, Kirtland AFB and other government-related agencies. Therefore, PaulBennewitz had scientific credibility, which apparently was considered to be a threat toProject Sigma that had to be protected. So Bennewitz became the target of a governmentmisinformation campaign to discredit him and to physically, mentally and emotionally hurtBennewitz and his wife that included what Bennewitz thought were microwave frequencyattacks that left red marks on their exposed skin.Other frequently discussed non-human underground facilities in New Mexico are beneatha mountain in Dulce (northern NM) called Archuleta. Supposedly there are at least fiveunderground levels in which humans and non-humans “work together” on at least oneupper floor, while the non-humans allegedly have complete control over one or morelower floors for genetic experimentation. Some animal mutilation excisions might end upthere for unknown laboratory experimentation?That relates to the Cimarron case that Paul Bennewitz and APRO took to Leo Sprinkle,Ph.D., for hypnosis. Mother and her son saw humanoids in a pasture with a downed cowthat was “screaming.” There was a disc and beam and mother and son were transportedfrom Cimarron region apparently to some place underground near Las Cruces, NewMexico. There, mother saw top of a humanoid head and hand floating in a vat of opaque,red liquid she thought was like blood - maybe a treatment? Maybe nourishment? Motheralso developed a vaginal infection that would not grow in a Petri dish and that one doctortried to defeat with the strongest sulfa drug he could prescribe. Cimarron mother saw TallOnes, small androids/robots and what she thought were U. S. Air Force dressed humans allunderground together. [ See 040306 Earthfiles and 100308 Earthfiles. ]Surprising development - a government-connected agent says he saw an x-ray of theCimarron mother's head that showed a small sphere implanted in base of her brain.Another surprise - the government agent does not link the spherical implants to theEBENs, but to what he calls the “Tall Ones.” He said to me, “There are many of theseimplanted people who do the bidding of the Tall Ones.” Government's fear: implants arenon-human method to control specific humans for reasons unknown.But that's another frustrating contradiction: in the Cimarron mother's transcript of herhypnosis session with Dr. Leo Sprinkle, she describes at least some of the non-humanshandling her this way: “Their eyes are - fill more than one-half of their face. Like emptyholes.” [ Page 346, An Alien Harvest © 1989 by Linda Moulton Howe. Contains 33-pageCimarron hypnosis transcript. See: Earthfiles Shop.]That sounds like the large, black eyes of some of the grey-skinned EBEN appearances.However, maybe it's true there are reptilian eyes with vertical slits underneath black lenscoverings? Also, many abductees are convinced the 3-foot-tall grey beings with large,slanted, black eyes are actually androids, biological robots, programmed for specificnon-human tasks by Whoever makes the androids. Maybe EBENs and Tall Ones and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"reptilian humanoids all make the same biological androids - only difference is how eachandroid is programmed for specific work with humans and other Earth life?There is another specific description by the Cimarron mother as she describe some of thenon-human beings that first took her into the round craft. “Boots, like storm trooper boots.They have an insignia on the left; it's pretty. Dark orangish design. I think it's a dark bluebackground. I don't think we have a color like it. Three lines and a line across the bottom.”[ Page 356, An Alien Harvest.] That sounds like the “Trilateral Insignia” attributed to theEBENs by American military and intelligence operatives. Two variations on EBEN “Trilateral Insignia” seen on craft and sketched by eyewitnesses.One military source said, “Take the middle vertical line out and it will be correct.” Three Main Non-Human Groups? Three Different Agendas?Or One Multilateral Homo Sapiens Project?What is the relationship between the EBENs and the Tall Ones and the so-called Reptiliansor Lizards? There is so much secrecy and deception by the government and none of thenon-humans seem to be straightforward about what their various agendas are - where isanything or anyone to trust for real facts? If the avatars of history are genetic creationswith a specific mission in mind for influencing evolving hominids, would humanconsciousness about non-human interactions with Earth life hurt the alien experiment? Ifso, secrecy is vital for the government that is running scared and for the non-humanscontrolling behind the scenes.Throughout the many abductee voices is the confusing paradox: upcoming will be a globalcatastrophe, perhaps astronomical event, in which much of Earth life will be destroyed.But if non-humans have been running some kind of genetic hybrid program on this planetsince before the time of the dinosaurs, why wouldn't they stop destruction of their allegedexperiment/s? One version of a global disaster: the 1949-retrieved Ebe died on June 18,1952. Supposedly one hundred years after his death in June 2052, the moon will change itsorbit (deliberately controlled by non-humans?) causing massive destruction and deaths onEarth. But the EBENs will rescue many humans before the event. It's another one of themany puzzling apocalyptic/salvation scenarios. Are all the various religious and propheticscenarios a conditioning program? Keep humans afraid of the Devil and on their knees toGod in order to control them for the Unseen, Unknown Experiment that might have to dowith where Homo sapiens sapiens souls go at the moment of death?
