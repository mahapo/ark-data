Yet right now on our Sun, with only six days togo, nothing really spectacular is happening.Those are alien messages for sure, but what are they trying to tell us? Do they thinksimilarly enough to us, so that we can communicate without errors of interpretation?I don't know. But it is surely a great scientific problem, and we are right at the cutting edgeof it! In other words, the SETI question is over: They are here, and they are talking. Whatcan we do now to understand?” Continued in Part 3: Quetzalcoatl's T Cross?Return to Part 1For further information about worldwide crop formations, please see Earthfiles Archivedreports (partial list below) and my book, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles, in theEarthfiles Shop.• 04/30/2009 — Part 1: First 2009 U.
