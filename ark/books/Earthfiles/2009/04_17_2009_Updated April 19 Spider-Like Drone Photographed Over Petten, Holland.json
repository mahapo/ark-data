In an email a week later, Chad sent some of his photographs dated May 6, 2007. [See: 051507 Earthfiles for photos.] In addition to the dragonfly-shaped body that hadappendages sticking out from a large ring, there was another odd feature. Rising from thering straight up into the air were slightly curved, thin wires that formed a tall, circularcrown above the dragonfly body. Chad was worried about his family's safety and healthafter he saw the bizarre aerial object at least eight times from his house and on hikes nearhis home and heard a low, electrostatic hum coming from it. Neighbors, he said, had alsoseen the unidentified aerial object.Odd aerial “drone” photographed by “Chad” inCentral California, on May 6, 2007.Other 2007 photographs of dragonfly-shaped aerial objects began to emerge between Mayand June from Lake Tahoe, Capitola and Big Basin, California – all with appendagessticking out from a ring and the tall, thin wires extending high above.

I had taken to calling the objects “drones” because eyewitnesses had theimpression that the hovering craft were not manned. The dozen photographs were from aman who called himself “Ty B.” [ See 061707 Earthfiles for all twelve photographs.]One of twelve photographs in a series taken on June 5, 2007,by “Ty B” in which the aerial craft appears to rotate.Ty explained he photographed the large, dragonfly craft while bicycling with a group in theBig Basin Redwood Park near Saratoga, California. He said they all saw the dragonfly-shaped craft fade in and fade out three times above them. It was on the third fade in thatTy was able to take twelve photos, which he mailed to me.After the Big Basin craft photographs, other cases emerged in which eyewitnessessketched odd, aerial “dragonfly”-shape aircraft.Red circles are the 15 regions known in the United States to date in which20 eyewitnesses have reported seeing a wingless aerial craft with antenna appendageshovering and moving like a dragonfly, spanning 21 years from 1987 to 2008.Map © 2008 by Earthfiles.

OnSaturday, September 8, 2007, 49-year-old Ruud Schmidt was camping for the weekendwith his wife and family in Petten, Holland. For eighteen years, Ruud has worked as atherapist for the mentally handicapped in Leek, Holland, and he likes to relax near waterwith a fishing rod.On September 8, around 1:30 PM, he and his wife had walked to a small lake behind thecamp to fish when he suddenly saw an object in the sky about a mile away and maybe athousand feet up. There was no sound that he and his wife could hear and neither couldfigure out what they were seeing. Ruud took thirteen digital images with his Nikon D-50camera and its 100/300 mm Sigma Lens with Autofocus, a camera he had purchased newin 2005. Ruud told me that he took all the photographs in about six minutes. So now, I amadding another line to the chronological list of eyewitnesses:21) September 8, 2007 - Petten, Holland camp ground.

Suddenly,I saw something in the sky and we didn't know what it was. My wife said, 'Why don't youtake pictures of it?' I could not see what it was. It was only a black spot. But I had mycamera.I did not have binoculars, so I used my camera to see what it was. But it was very difficultbecause I could not recognize the object. I took twelve photos and on the computer athome, we looked at the thing in the sky and still did not know what it was.HOW FAR DO YOU THINK THE OBJECT WAS FROM YOU?I think about 2 kilometers (1.609 kilometers = 1 mile).ABOUT 1 MILE."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"About a miles, yes.HOW HIGH IN THE AIR DO YOU THINK?Just a guess, but I think it was about 250 to 300 meters.THEN ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET?Ye s .COULD YOU HEAR ANY SOUND?No, we did not hear any sound.

DID YOU KEEP WATCHING ITUNTIL - WHAT HAPPENED?We were fishing. After I took the pictures for about five or six minutes, we kept fishingand looked up to see if it was still there. We didn’t see it coming and we didn’t see itleaving. It was just gone.HOW MANY OF YOU SAW THIS ALL AT THE SAME TIME?Only me and my wife. The rest of the family was cooking.AFTER YOU HAD TAKEN THE 12 IMAGES ON YOUR NIKON CAMERA, DID YOUCONTINUE TO WATCH IT WITH YOUR EYES?Yes, but we went on fishing.SO, DID IT JUST DISAPPEAR WHILE YOU WERE WATCHING IT?No, we didn’t see it disappear. We were fishing and we looked to the water and thenlooked up and then it was gone.WHEN YOU HAD YOUR 13 IMAGES ON YOUR COMPUTER, DID YOU EVER ASKANY FRIENDS TO COME IN AND LOOK TO SEE IF ANYONE COULD RECOGNIZEIT? I asked my brother-in-law and my father. We are very skeptical people. I don’t know whatit is. It could be anything. We didn’t have any answers. I thought, ‘What do I do with this?’I did nothing. I left them on the computer. (laughs)SO, YOU LEFT THOSE TWELVE IMAGES OF THE UNKNOWN IN THE SKY ONYOUR COMP UTER UNTIL WHEN?Until last year, 2008. Then I spoke to a friend and he said maybe I should post them on awebsite to ask about what it is. I did, but I think it was the wrong website – it was theDutch Nibiru website in a forum for people to react and no one knew what it was. [Editor's Note: Nibiru is a “12th planet” described in ancient Sumerian texts as periodicallyinteracting with Earth's solar system.]So, last weekend (April 11-12, 2009), I wondered what more to do with the pictures and Iwas cleaning up my PC. Last year, I was also interested in UFOcasebook.com. Every day Ilook to see if there is something new and I posted it to the UFOcasebook. That man, BJ,was really enthusiastic to have me place photos in the forum to see if anyone knew what itwas. He did and then you emailed me and everybody emailed me about if I knew what itcould be?!Well, I don’t know what it is!"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"IF I UNDERSTAND, YOU HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE DRAGONFLY DRONEPHENOMENON EVER BEFORE?No, not really.HAD YOU EVER SEEN ANY OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS I POSTED IN 2007 ANDILLUSTRATIONS IN 2008 THAT LOOK A BIT LIKE DRAGONFLY INSECTS IN THESKY?No. When I posted on the UFOcasebook, there were many reactions. There are manypeople who are declaring me a liar. And that was frustrating.THAT WAS APPARENTLY PROVOKED BY SOME CALCULATEDMISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN BY PEOPLE UNKNOWN IN 2007 TRYING TOPAINT THE PHOTOS THAT EMERGED AS BEING HOAXED. ANYONE WHOCALLS YOU A LIAR HAS BEEN INFLUENCED BY THAT MISINFORMATION.YOU TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS OF AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT THAT YOU ANDYOUR WIFE SAW WHILE YOU WERE FISHING.Yes, the object was there. At the moment, we don’t know what it is. It could be anything.People said to me, ‘It’s a balloon. It’s a kite.’ I said, ‘OK, I photographed it with mycamera, but I don’t know what it is.’ That’s why I posted the photos.”Update April 19, 2009Original, untouched, 13 digital images taken by Ruud Schmidt around 1:30 PM and to 1:36PM, on Saturday, September 8, 2007, at Petten, Holland, recreational camp ground:http://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0731.JPGhttp://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0732.JPGhttp://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0733.JPGhttp://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0734.JPGhttp://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0735.JPGhttp://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0736.JPGhttp://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0737.JPGhttp://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0738.JPGhttp://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0739.JPGhttp://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0740.JPGhttp://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0741.JPGhttp://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0742.JPGhttp://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0743.JPGIf anyone has seen and/or photographed a similar “spider”-shaped aerial object or one ofthe “dragonfly”-shaped aerial craft, or drones, please email me: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
