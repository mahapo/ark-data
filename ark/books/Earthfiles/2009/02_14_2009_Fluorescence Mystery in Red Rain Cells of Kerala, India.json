Photomicrograph © 2007 by Godfrey Louis, Ph.D.February 14, 2009 Kerala, India - Three years ago in the April 4, 2006, journalAstrophysics and Space Science was a published paper entitled: “The Red Rain Phenomenonof Kerala and Its Possible Extraterrestrial Origin.” Kerala is on the Malabar Coast insouthwestern India. The astrophysical paper was about an event that occurred in July toSeptember 2001 - and several summers since - when raindrops falling on Kerala stainedpeoples’ clothes. White T-shirts were covered with pinkish-red rain splatters and residentswondered what was happening?News of the red rain mystery reached Godfrey Louis, Ph.D., then a Professor of Pure andApplied Physics at Mahatma Ghandi University. He collected many test tubes of thered-colored rain water and put some under a microscope. He thought he was looking atbiological cells with red walls.Over several months, Prof. Louis experimented with different temperatures to see if the cellswould respond. As the temperature rose, he saw more activity. Eventually he got up to 300degrees Celsius, which is 572 degrees Fahrenheit. He also increased the pressure to 300 poundsper square centimeter. It is assumed that normal Earth life would die at such a high temperatureand pressure. But the red-walled cells in the Kerala rain water seemed to thrive.Under his microscope, Dr. Louis watched the red cells produce smaller cells internally thatwere colorless, or whitish. He called the new cells “daughters” of the original “mother” cells.Once he counted as many as fifteen daughter cells inside one of the adult “mother cells.” Asthe daughter cells grew, their cell walls also became red and eventually, the daughter cellserupted through the wall of the mother cell. For Dr. Louis, this was replication, but in normalEarth biology, replication of cell life requires the presence of DNA. He and his colleagues hadlooked for DNA, but were puzzled when they could not find it."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"This photomicrograph (scale bar is 300 nanometers) shows“a cell wi th shrunken membrane contai ning ‘daughters’ (internal buds).Two have well-defined cell walls, while the third (paler) structure (lower right)mi ght be a further daughter i n the process of development.”Photomicrograph courtesy Cardiff University.For outside help, Prof. Louis sent samples of the red rain cells to astrobiologist, ChandraWickramasinghe at Cardiff University in Wales, to biologists at Sheffield University in Englandand to scientists at Cornell University in the United States for isotopic ratio studies of theelemental composition of the red rain water. Elements confirmed were hydrogen, silicon,oxygen, carbon, and aluminum. But the carbon 12 to carbon 13 isotopic ratio in the red raincells were not definitively extraterrestrial – further confusing the situation.I saw the red rain for myself in Prof. Wickramasinghe’s Cardiff University laboratory in August7 to 8, 2006. His graduate student at the time had tried to break open the cells to amplifywhatever DNA might be there, but found the cell walls too hard and thick to penetrateadequately. In other lab tests, there was some fluorescence, but the source was inconclusive.However, the Cardiff work provoked Prof. Louis in Kerala, India, to experiment further withthe red rain cells in different combinations of UV light wavelengths and emission filters. Theeffects on the red rain cells was recorded by a spectrofluorimeter.On Earth, proteins and biomolecules can fluoresce, but no proteins or biomolecules have yetbeen confirmed in the red rain cells. And yet, the red rain cells showed unusual fluorescenceemission peaks shifting with each change in the excitation wavelength – a shifting not seen interrestrial biomolecules.Dr. Louis presented his fluorescence research at the August 12 – 14, 2008, meeting of theSociety of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers in San Diego.

Kasha's rule is relevant in understanding theemission spectrum of an excited molecule.

Conventional biomolecules or organisms are not known tohave this kind of unusual autofluorescence and hence, the presence of new kind ofbiomolecules can be inferred in the red rain cells. ...Organisms replicating at 300 degreesCelsius and showing this kind of autofluorescence are currently unknown to exist on earth,which is again an indication supporting the view that these cells are possibly extraterrestrial.”Interview:Godfrey Louis, Ph.D., holding vial of red rain water.Photo courtesy Prof. Godfrey Louis.Godfrey Louis, Ph.D., Professor and Head, Department of Physics, Cochin University ofScience and Technology, Kochi, Kerala, India: “This kind of fluorescence is not shown byconventional biomolecules. In this case, you can see the fluorescence in so many differentwavelengths. So, there is a possible combination of several biomolecules present in these cells,which are continuously responsible for this kind of behavior. Or the biomolecules have specialproperties, which we don’t understand why it should behave like this. So it is a very interestingproperty shown by the red rain cells and it requires more investigation to find out what is thereason for this.I THINK ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF YOUR RESEARCH WITH THERED RAIN CELLS HAS LONG BEEN THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE CULTURED THEMAT SUCH A HIGH TEMPERATURE OF 300 DEGREES CELSIUS. WHEN YOU CONVERTTHAT TO FAHRENHEIT IS 572 DEGREES F. EARTH LIFE, AS WE KNOW IT, WOULDDIE AT 300 DEGREES CELSIUS. WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THESE RED RAIN CELLSCAN GROW AND REPLICATE AT SUCH A HIGH TEMPERATURE?Ah, that’s a very interesting question because according to our hypothesis (of extraterrestrialorigin), this is growing inside a comet possibly. So, if it is coming from such a body, we thinkthis (red rain cells) has grown inside the comet. If you take a comet of size diameter 10 (6miles) to 50 kilometers (31 miles) then inside the comet, even if it is an icy body, inside thecomet there can be higher temperature due to radioactive heating or biological heating. So,inside such a comet, higher temperature and pressure can exist. That could be a natural habitatof these red rain cell organisms.AT THIS POINT IN FEBRUARY 2009, ARE YOU CONVINCED, DR. LOUIS, THAT THERED RAIN CELLS ARE EXTRATERRESTRIALS, PERHAPS FROM A COMET?Yes, I am personally convinced about this. These red rain cells have not been identified byanybody. That is one point that is important.Another thing is the peculiar manner in which this has happened in Kerala, these red rains indifferent parts of Kerala.Then the extraordinary properties of the cells. They are able to be grown at high temperature,so these are properties not exhibited by any known organism on Earth. It has to be anextraterrestrial organism.AND THE FLUORESCENCE THAT YOU’VE REPORTED ABOUT IN AUGUST 2008,HOW UNUSUAL IS THE FLUORESCENCE IN THE RED RAIN CELLS COMPARED TO"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"PROTEINS AND OTHER SUBSTANCES ON EARTH?Yes, proteins and other substances do not have this shifting of peak behavior. If normal Earthproteins and substances are fluorescing at a particular green color, then they go on fluorescingat that color. They don’t fluoresce and then emit red light.This particular material (red rain cells) is fluorescing like this (shifting peak behavior). To thebest of our knowledge, I don’t think there is an (Earth) organism, which is doing this. That hasnot been seen. The conventional organisms are not showing this kind of fluorescence.WHAT DO YOU SAY TO YOUR CRITICS WHO SAY THAT THE RED RAIN CELLS ARENOTHING MORE THAN RED YEAST CELLS?If it is yeast cells, then how do they grow at such high temperatures? These red rain cells canwithstand quite extreme conditions. We have put them in liquid nitrogen, as we have heatedthem and the cells are quite stable after these treatments. So, the cells are capable ofwithstanding high temperature and low temperature. There is no problem for them and possiblythe cells can withstand the UV radiation and might have developed for this, possibly.IN YOUR LAB, WHAT IS THE LOWEST TEMPERATURE THAT YOU HAVE EXPOSEDTHE CELLS TO?We have exposed them to the liquid nitrogen temperature that is something like 77 Kelvin.DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT IS IN MINUS CELSIUS?That would be around minus 200 degrees C., I think.SO, IN YOUR OWN LAB, YOU HAVE SUBJECTED THE RED RAIN CELLS FROMMINUS 200 DEGREES CELSIUS ALL THE WAY UP TO 300 DEGREES PLUS CELSIUS?Yes, 300 degrees Celsius is the culturing temperature (for the red rain cells), and after theminus temperature, we have examined the cells under the microscope and they are notdamaged after that exposure.WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT YOUR LAB EXPERIMENTATION WITH THE HUGERANGE OF TEMPERATURE FROM EXTREME COLD TO EXTREME HEAT HAS NOTDAMAGED THE RED RAIN CELLS AND SUGGESTS THAT THE CELLS COULD COMEIN ON A COMET OR METEORITIC DUST AND BE UP IN THE UPPER STRATOSPHERE,WHICH IS VERY COLD, AND EVENTUALLY WORK THEIR WAY DOWN TO INDIAAND STILL SURVIVE.Ah, yes! Why Red Rains in Kerala, India?THEN IS THE QUESTION: WHY WOULD THESE RED RAIN CELLS SINCE 2001 KEEPRAINING DOWN ON KERALA, INDIA, AND NOT OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD?Cochin, Kerala, India is Latitude: 09° 59' 49 N; Longitude 076° 02' 30 E.[ Editor's Note: Dr. Louis reports that the state of Kerala has had confirmed redrains in 2001, 2006, 2007, 2008, and there might have been other unreported redrains in July to August 2002 to 2005.On July 29, 2003, in Nghe An, Vietnam (Latitude: 16° 28' 0 N, Longitude: 107° 35'60 E), a red rain lasted 30 minutes. One local media report said, “Scientists in"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Vietnam are baffled why red coloured rain fell from the skies last week over thecentral province of Nghe An. Water samples have been sent to laboratories in theprovincial capital Vinh for further analysis, with results expected within a week.\"There was no reported follow up on the lab results.On July 31, 2008 an incident of red colored rain occurred in the municipality ofBagadó, Chocó, Colombia (Latitude: 5° 28' 0\" North, Longitude: 76° 9' 0\" West).It has been reported that an individual took a sample of the rain to a laboratory andsubsequently it was reported to be “blood.” ] Godfrey Louis, Ph.D.: “That question is very important because if you take this particularlatitude of Kerala, you can see there are oceans on both sides of that southern tip of India. Ifsomething is falling in the sea, nobody is going to notice. And the place where the red cellshave fallen in the state of Kerala, it is important to know that people there have reported theevent to the press. In Kerala, the population is more and you have so many houses nearby andmany people are having connections with the news reporters, so there is a high level ofreporting here. But, if the cells are falling in the seas or in the same latitude in Africa, I don’tthink those are going to be reported to the press.Another question are other recent red rains reported in Vietnam in 2003 and Colombia in 2008,near the same latitude region north of the equator. Still No DNA Confirmedin Kerala Red Rain CellsWHAT WAS THE REACTION OF THE CONFERENCE THAT YOU ATTENDED INAUGUST 2008 IN SAN DIEGO OF THE OPTICAL ENGINEERS – WHAT WAS THEIRREACTION TO YOUR PRESENTATION ABOUT THE FLUORESCENCE OF THE REDRAIN CELLS?Oh, many people were interested and many have collected papers from me and are waiting formore results from me to come out.MORE RESULTS?Yes, we have to do models on this and that is going on now. Also some time back, I gave asample to Norway, one microbiologist. He also looked for DNA and could not get it. So, weneed people who are really interested to pursue this.MOST SCIENTISTS AGREE THAT LIFE AS WE KNOW IT CANNOT EXIST WITHOUTDNA AS THE STOREHOUSE OF GENETIC CODE; RNA AS THE GENETICMESSENGER; AND PROTEINS TO CARRY OUT THE CHEMISTRY OFREPRODUCTION. SO, DO I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY TO DATE THAT NO ONE HASDISCOVERED ANY DNA IN THE RED RAIN CELLS OF KERALA?Yes. No one has given any clear indication of DNA. And then in Cardiff University, they didsome PCR analysis and they also could not get the DNA. So, the question about DNA is stillopen and anybody willing to look at it can look at it and it has not been proved that there isDNA in the red rain cells.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a techniquewidely used in molecular biology. It derives its name from one of its keycomponents, a DNA polymerase used to amplify a piece of DNA by in vitroenzymatic replication. As PCR progresses, the DNA generated is used as atemplate for replication. This sets in motion a chain reaction in which the DNAtemplate is exponentially amplified. With PCR it is possible to amplify a single orfew copies of a piece of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generatingmillions or more copies of the DNA piece. PCR can be extensively modified toperform a wide array of genetic manipulations."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"PCR tubes for polymerase chain reaction analysis.Developed in 1984 by Kary Mullis, PCR is now a common and often indispensabletechnique used in medical and biological research labs for a variety of applications.These include DNA cloning for sequencing, DNA-based phylogeny, or functionalanalysis of genes; the diagnosis of hereditary diseases; the identification of geneticfingerprints (used in forensic sciences and paternity testing); and the detection anddiagnosis of infectious diseases. In 1993 Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize inChemistry for his work on PCR.The structure of part of a DNA doubl e hel ix.Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is a nucleic acid that contains the geneticinstructions used in the development and functioning of all known living organismsand some viruses. The main role of DNA molecules is the long-term storage ofinformation. DNA is often compared to a set of blueprints or a recipe, or a code,since it contains the instructions needed to construct other components of cells,such as proteins and RNA molecules. The DNA segments that carry this geneticinformation are called genes, but other DNA sequences have structural purposes,or are involved in regulating the use of this genetic information.” ] IN TERMS OF EARTH SCIENCE, DOES IT SEEM IMPOSSIBLE THAT DNA, AS WEKNOW DNA IN LIFE ON EARTH, COULD SURVIVE EXPOSURE TO 300 DEGREESCELSIUS FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME?That is also the reason that I’m thinking there is no DNA because the red rain cells aresurviving and growing at 300 degrees Centigrade/Celsius – there is some kind of otherbiomolecule involved, possibly. So, DNA might not be the mechanism that is operating in thered rain cells. If so, our whole biological idea we will have to change if you accept the no-DNAresults. And that gives me more difficulty to publish about the red rain cells - the lack of DNA.That deviates from our current understanding of biology. So, this is a difficulty. Could Unusual Fluorescence Befrom Extraterrestrial Biomolecules?IS THE IMPORTANCE OF YOUR FLUORESCENCE WORK REPORTED IN AUGUST2008, THAT IF THERE ARE EXTRAORDINARY EXTRATERRESTRIALBIOMOLECULES IN THE RED RAIN CELLS OF KERALA, THOSE STRANGE, OR NEW,OR EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOMOLECULES MIGHT BE FLUORESCES SOSTRANGELY?Yes, that is what I am also saying – this organism might be containing an unknown type ofbiomolecules, which need to be investigated and which need to be identified. So, we have toextract these biomolecules and identify them. All organisms and all known biological materialon Earth have DNA. And the life currently known to us all has DNA. There is no organism that"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"is known that is without DNA.SO, IF THE RED RAIN CELLS OF KERALA DO NOT HAVE DNA, THEY REALLY ARE AVERY UNUSUAL SUBSTANCE THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO DIVIDE ITSELF THROUGHTHE DAUGHTER CELLS AT 300 DEGREES CELSIUS.Yes. That is very unusual and without DNA, that would change our concept of biology. Anorganism without DNA means that we would get more understanding about life.DR. LOUIS, YOU ARE PERSONALLY CONVINCED THAT THE RED RAIN CELLS OFKERALA, INDIA, ARE EXTRATERRESTRIAL?Yes, I am convinced of that because I have done so many experiments on the cells. I don’t findany terrestrial explanation for this. I have tried to hard and I don’t find any source that canexplain this kind of phenomenon. So, I am personally convinced about it.WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WOULD TAKE TO CONVINCE THE GLOBAL SCIENTIFICCOMMUNITY THAT WHAT YOU HAVE IN THE RED RAIN CELLS AREEXTRATERRESTRIAL?When more papers are published, the scientific world will no longer be able to resist the factsand they will have to take the red rain cell phenomenon seriously. Scientists have to do someanalysis to identify the biomolecules. If they find that biomolecules are not present, than thatwill be a result.IF THE CARDIFF RESEARCHERS DO NOT FIND DNA ON THE NEXT ROUND OFRESEARCH, IS THE NEXT BIG NEWS FROM YOU THAT THIS SEEMS TO BEANOTHER PIECE OF EVIDENCE THAT THE RED RAIN CELLS OF KERALA ARE NOTFROM EARTH?Yes, that the DNA – we have not been able to detect. Then that will be big news because it is abig question. Life without DNA is a very big question. So, that question might not be settled byjust one paper.HOW OLD ARE YOU NOW?I am 53.DO YOU EXPECT IN YOUR LIFETIME THAT THE RED RAIN CELLS OF KERALAWILL DEFINITIVELY BE DECIDED BY SCIENCE AS EITHER TERRESTRIAL OREXTRATERRESTRIAL?That is left to the scientific community and I think in a few years, it will happen.ARE THE RED RAIN CELLS OF KERALA THE MOST FASCINATING THING THAT YOUHAVE STUDIED IN YOUR CAREER?Exactly, because I am a solid state physicist and I have been teaching electronics and solidstate physics that have no connection with biology. But I had to jump into this problem becausethis problem was not investigated well in Kerala. I found in studying the problem that it hasgreat significance. And if the research is not done by me, the world is not going to know aboutit and it will be discarded as some pollution or something like that. So nobody is going toinvestigate it.But now it has become a question that requires an answer. I’m putting this question to theentire scientific world: find an answer for this.” Beyond Prof. Louis's fluorescence research, he still seeks answers to the questions:1) Do the Kerala red rain cells have DNA?2) If DNA, are the red rain cells an unidentified form of yeast or lichen cells from Earth?If the answer is “no” to the above questions, the red rain cells don't fit the panspermiahypothesis in which all life in the universe has been seeded from the same DNA. If the red raincells do not have DNA and still replicate at 300 degrees Celsius, the red rain cells are outsidethe normal definition of Earth life. If the red rain cells came to Earth in ice from a comet thatperhaps made the one sonic boom heard by Kerala residents in July 2001, where did the cometget the red cells?Godfrey Louis, Ph.D.: “On first impression one may think that a microbe without DNAviolates the Panspermia theory. But this need not be true. Panspermia can still be correctprovided we have a much broader understanding of life. These hyperthermophilic red rainmicrobes can kick start life in a hot young planet. As the planet cools , there can be anevolutionary process connecting the currently known life and the red rain type life. So the red"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"rain type life is possibly connected with our type of life in a more fundamental way. Thisconnection need not be in terms of DNA code. Currently there exists a great lack ofunderstanding on how life originated in the Universe. Conversion of chemicals to Life may behaving a much more longer history and steps than we presently imagine. I hope that detailedstudies on the red rain microbes in future can bring in more understanding on the origin,evolution and distribution of life in the Universe.”More Information:For further information about the red rain cells of Kerala, India, please see reports below in theEarthfiles Archive:• 10/25/2007 — Red Rain Cells of Kerala, India: Physicist Says Still No DNA, But ReplicationAt 300 Degrees Celsius ( 572 F.)• 08/19/2006 — Red Rain Cells of Kerala, India - Still No Definite DNA• 06/15/2006 — \"Extraterrestrial Life\" in Red Rain of Kerala, India?References:1) Louis, G. and Kumar, A.
