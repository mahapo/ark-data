It is not burdened by ideology and carries nopolitical baggage as it changes from solid to liquid. It just melts.” - Henry Pollack, Ph.D., Geophysicist and Author, A World Without Ice Click for podcast.Sea ice melt in the Arctic, Greenland, and elsewhere is likelyto affect future temperatures in the regions because ice reflectsmuch of the sun's radiation back into space while dark ocean water absorbsmore of the sun's energy. As ice melts, more exposed ocean water changes theEarth's albedo, or fraction of energy reflected away from the planet. This leads toincreased absorption of energy that further warms the planet in what is calledice-albedo feedback and Earth gets warmer.

K., AMID THE LEAKS OFALL OF THESE EMAILS THAT SEEM TO SUGGEST THAT SCIENTISTS IN THEGLOBAL CLIMATE AREA HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT MANIPULATINGDATA OR PRESENTING DATA THAT WOULD FAVOR AN AVERAGE MEANGLOBAL TEMPERATURE INCREASE VERSUS THE PLATEAU IN TEMPERATURETHE PAST DECADE?The University of East Anglia has been a climate data center and a center for climateresearch for most of a century. It’s one of the better-known climate research units inacademia around the world. But they are not the only one that do similar types of researchon constructing temperature changes over the globe over the past century from weatherstation records and temperature sensors in buoys that float around in the ocean and such."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The same type of work is done by NASA in the United States, by NOAA in the U. S., bythe British Meteorological Service called the Hadley Centre in the U. K., by otherinstitutions in Germany and Japan. They do the research independently. They all use moreor less the same data and they all make their own decisions as to which data are reliableand which are less reliable. They all make their own decisions about how to makecorrections to thermometer readings over the years. But this research goes onindependently at many different places.The important result of comparing the independent exercises of constructing thetemperature history of Earth over the past century is that all of the constructions, all of theassemblies of data, tell the very same story (of a warming planet). So, even if theUniversity of East Anglia had been doctoring or fudging or manipulating data – and I’mnot accusing them of that – but even if they had and the entire research output werediscarded from that climate unit, there would still be the same results from half a dozendifferent institutions done independently by independent scientists making their ownscientific judgments.So, I don’t think it (East Anglia situation and leaked emails) should have a big effect at allbecause the data itself is so persuasive that you can’t erase climate change from therecord, nor can you put it in. This is Nature speaking and it is a story that the 20th Centuryhas been one of warming over the long term.The predictions of the climate scientists in projecting future temperatures, they don’tpredict there will be an incremental temperature increase year by year. They are sayingthere is a long-term trend upward, but the natural variability of the Earth’s temperaturedue to changes in ocean currents, the El Nino events, the Arctic Oscillation of theNorthern Hemisphere ocean waters – a lot of phenomena like that – superimposes ups anddowns on a long-term upward trend (of warming).And so climate scientists do not say that every year you are going to see an increase inaverage global mean temperature of the Earth. Some years we know there are evendecreases. But as has been pointed out over the last year, the temperatures have kind ofplateaued, but I might note that they have plateaued at a very high temperature.The temperatures over the past decade, even though they have not been climbingyear-by-year, they still comprise the hottest decade in the entire instrumental record. So,it’s not as if the Earth has suddenly started to cool. It has plateaued for a decade [ sincearound 1999] in its upward climb.But that kind of pausing or ups and downs that we see on shorter time scales – that’s notclimate. We’re looking at climate as the long-term trend and to any eye that looks at acentury worth of data, the trend is upward and there is nothing in the last decade that willnegate that.So, my assessment of what has come out of the Univ. of East Anglia situation is that itdoes not undermine the fact that the Earth is warming. It might say something about aparticular group of scientists, but that is far from representing the whole scientificcommunity. Water Vapor As Important As CO2?DO YOU THINK CO2 BUILD UP IS AS IMPORTANT AS WATER VAPOR?CO2 is a greenhouse gas and water vapor is also a greenhouse gas. The two are actuallyinterlinked because if the atmosphere were to warm from the greenhouse effect of carbondioxide, it would be able to hold more water vapor because a warmer atmosphere can holdmore water vapor. So, then there is an increase in evaporation and more water vapor joinsthe atmosphere as well. With that amplification by two greenhouse gases, it is simplygetting warmer faster.I don’t think water vapor has been ignored. All the climate models that I’m aware ofrecognize that water vapor will grow in the atmosphere as the atmosphere warms and themodels all take that into account.IS THERE ANY REASON WHY WATER VAPOR HAS BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THEDISCUSSIONS IN COPENHAGEN?I think the so-called exclusion is not only of water vapor. It’s the whole hydrological cycleand the different environmental signatures in different parts of the globe that affect thehydrological cycle. That is what has been set aside as a discussion in Copenhagen becauseCopenhagen is dealing principally with ways to slow down climate change and the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"perturbations to the hydrological cycle are some of the changes in climate change. Inchoosing to focus on the causes as opposed to the consequences that have been theconscious choice to focus strongly on the causes of climate change and their mitigation.That’s not to say that the consequences and impacts on hydrological cycle are notimportant. It’s just that that’s not the focus of this particular conference. Is Earth Headed for Another Iceless Age?Ice is a very sensitive indicator of climate change because it is very close to its meltingpoint over large regions of the Earth. So, with very small changes in temperature, you’llsee big changes in the distribution of ice. I like ice in that context because I call it Nature’sbest thermometer. It doesn’t read the newspapers. It doesn’t listen to debates. It has noideological baggage. Just when it gets warm enough, it melts.So, it’s a natural thermometer and it is talking to us. Places that are more accessible tomost people are mountaintops such as the high tops of the Himalayas or the Andes inSouth America or even in Glacier National Park in the U. S. A. The ice in thosemountainous regions in the mid-latitudes and tropical latitudes is receding in the valleysand thinning in the thickness of the ice very dramatically. If that continues over the nextfew decades, we will see the loss of most mountain ice by mid-century. The consequencesof that are very significant because the melt water provides water for agriculture. Aboutone-quarter of Earth’s population is drawing their water in part from the high ice in theHimalayas and other mountains. So, losing that ice has a big impact on large numbers ofpeople.The second component of ice that is changing is the Arctic sea ice. Usually the ArcticOcean freezes and for most of human history it’s been frozen. But every summer, it tendsto break up a little bit and the re-freezes again in the winter. So, the Arctic has basicallybeen a big frozen sheet of seawater.But in the last few decades, more and more of that has been breaking up in thesummertime and exposing the dark ocean water that absorbs the sunshine. Therefore, theocean gets warmer. Then it’s harder to freeze it again in the fall and it doesn’t freeze asthick over the winter and it begins to break up earlier in the spring. It’s a feedback cyclethat is quickly destroying the sea ice in the summertime in the Arctic Ocean.If the rate of loss of summertime sea ice continues, we’ll see an ice-free Arctic ocean bymid century as well with big consequences for the territory around the Arctic Ocean – thelargely frozen areas of northern Alaska and northern Canada and Siberia. There thepermafrost is beginning to melt.More Arctic ocean ice melt will also open up more political tensions in the Arctic aspeople compete for the fishery resources. There will certainly be more exploration for oiland gas. There will be increased commerce through the Northwest and Northeast passages– the shortcut to Asia from Europe and North America. So, we’ll see the Arctic oceanturning into a beehive of activity when effectively, it’s been off limits to human activitysince before humans have been on Earth.One climate scientist I know has said that an ice-free Arctic ocean in the summer will bethe biggest change Earth’s landscape that people have ever seen.A third effect is the creeping melting of Greenland and West Antarctica where there arebig piles of ice sitting on those pieces of land. Summertime melting in Greenland iscreeping higher and higher onto the Greenland ice sheet and the melt water is plunging intodeep crevasses and down deep to the base of the ice sheet and lubricating the bottom ofthe ice. The consequence of that is that glaciers that are chipping ice off Greenland to thesea are now moving faster and delivering their ice more rapidly.So Greenland is actually losing ice mass every year at an ever-faster pace as well as WestAntarctica experiencing the same thing."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Greenland ice decline in 1992 (left) versus ice decline ten years later in 2002 (right). Greenland is aself-governing Danish province located between the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans. Though geographically andethnically an Arctic island nation associated with the continent of North America, politically and historicallyGreenland is closely tied to Europe, specifically Iceland, Norway and Denmark. It is the largest island in theworld that is not also considered a continent. Source: Arctic Council, Impacts of a Warming Climate: ArcticClimate Impact Assessment, Cambridge Univ.

This chart is based on ice cores, taken from:Arctic Council, Impacts of a Warming Climate: Arctic Climate Impact Assessment, CambridgeUniv. Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 2004. We’re seeing what I call a sleeping giant being awakened. Ice that has been with us formost of human history is now being de-stabilized and being returned to the sea. Ultimatelythe consequences will result in rising sea levels as well because every time you send meltwater back to the sea you are adding to the seawater. But even just dropping ice into sea(from land) raises the water right away, just as dropping an ice cube into a beverage glassdoes.So, we’re seeing a lot of action in the cryosphere, the world of ice that shows it isresponding to climate change in ways that will have great impact on the human populationeverywhere around the world.AND CONTINUES TO MELT REGARDLESS OF HUMAN ARGUMENTS.Indeed! Nature is talking to us and if we don’t listen, we’re doing so at our own peril. Theeffects of rising sea levels, the effects of changes in our hydrological cycle, greater rainfallin some places and greater dryness of the soil in other places – Nature is sending us astrong message and if we don’t pay attention to it, it will be adverse consequence for us. Arctic Ocean Summers Ice-Free by 2050HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE BEFORE THE ARCTIC IS ICE-FREE INSUMMERS?I think by mid-century, the Arctic Ocean will be ice-free in the summertime. It will ofcourse re-freeze in the winter, but it will be a much thinner ice sheet and much morevulnerable to break up. I think we’ll see ice-free summers in the Arctic Ocean within the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"first half of this century.We’ll see the loss of the mountain ice probably even sooner over most of the lower latitudeand tropical mountain glaciers. Sea Level Rise by 2100 - 6 Feet?The de-stabilization of Greenland and West Antarctica is a longer term process, but weactually could see enough ice lost from those two areas to have a sea level change by theend of the 21st Century by as much as six feet.In the very long term, if we lose all the ice from Antarctica and from Greenland – I’m notpredicting that in an immediate future, but on a millennial time scale – if we lose all of thatice, sea levels will rise by perhaps as much as 250 feet.WHICH WOULD FLOOD MOST EVERYWHERE!Most everywhere. Even more modest sea level changes in the 21st century, which areprobably going to be in the range of 3 to 6 feet – a 3 foot rise in sea level will displace 100million people around the globe. That’s how many people live very near the seashoreswithin 3 feet above sea level. That includes people who live on atolls in the Pacific; itincludes people on the Maldives Islands in the Indian Ocean; it includes the people wholive in the low-lying land of the Ganges River and the Nile River. We’re going to seelarge-scale displacement of human populations on a scale that humanity has never dealtwith before. There will be great political and social instability occurring and amplifiedyear-by-year for every year that slips by without people addressing this issue. 55 Million Years Ago Was Last TimeEarth Was Without Ice“ ... there was a large exhalation of methane gas from the ocean floor ...for some unknown reason.” - Henry Pollack, Ph.D.WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME PERIOD THAT THE ARCTIC WAS COMPLETELYOPEN?I think the last time period that we can be certain that the Arctic ocean was open was 55million years ago when the Earth probably had no ice at all. That was perhaps the last timethat Earth was totally ice free.IS IT TRUE THAT SCIENTISTS REALLY DON’T UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMFOR WHY THE EARTH GOES IN AND OUT OF ICY PERIODS?We know that the last time the Earth was totally without ice 55 million years ago that therewas a large exhalation of methane gas from the ocean floor. There is a lot of methanestored beneath the ocean floor. For some unknown reason, that was destabilized. Methaneis a powerful greenhouse gas and it went into the atmosphere and raised temperaturessignificantly for a fairly long period of time. The consequence was that Earth warmed upand lost its ice.[ Editor's Note: ScienceDaily on December 27, 2007, reported: “There arenew findings regarding a phase of rapid global greenhouse warming that tookplace 55 million years ago. This period of climate change is regarded as thebest fossil analogue to current and future greenhouse warming.Analogous to the Earth's current situation, greenhouse warming 55 millionyears ago was caused by a relatively rapid increase of CO2 concentrations inthe atmosphere. This phase, known as the Paleocene-Eocene thermalmaximum (PETM), was studied using sediments that accumulated 55 millionyears ago on the ocean floor in what is now New Jersey.The new study shows that a large proportion of the greenhouse gases wasreleased as a result of a chain-reaction of events. Probably due to intensevolcanic activity, CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere became higher andthe ensuing greenhouse effect warmed the Earth. As a result, submarinemethane hydrates (ice-like structures in which massive amounts of methaneare stored) melted and released large amounts of methane into theatmosphere."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"This further amplified the magnitude of global warming, which comprisedabout 6 degrees Celsius in total. According to the IPCC, Earth will warm upbetween 1.4 degrees Celsius and 5.8 degrees Celsius (roughly 2 degreesFahrenheit to 10 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of this century.The new research confirms that global warming can stimulate mechanismsthat release massive amounts of stored carbon into the atmosphere. Currentand future warming will likely see similar effects, such as methane hydratedissociation, adding additional greenhouse gases to those resulting from fossilfuel burning.Last year, the same group of researchers showed in Nature that tropical algaemigrated into the Arctic Ocean during the PETM, when temperatures rose to24 degrees C. Current climate models are not capable of simulating such hightemperatures in the Arctic.”]DO YOU HAVE A HYPOTHESIS ABOUT WHAT WOULD HAVE RELEASED SOMUCH METHANE 55 MILLION YEARS AGO?My hunch is that all you have to do is raise the temperature of the deep ocean water a fewdegrees and you can destabilize it. It may well be that in some parts of the globe, there wasa situation of ocean currents that maybe led to warming of the deep ocean and release ofmethane locally. But once that reaches the atmosphere, the methane becomes a globalgreenhouse blanket and it warms the seas everywhere else and you destabilize some more.So, it’s like a runaway process that led to large-scale loss of methane from the ocean floor. Could Warming Deep Oceans SuddenlyRelease Methane in 21st Century?PROF. POLLACK, IF THAT HAPPENED 55 MILLION YEARS AGO AND ACOMBINATION OF INDUSTRY AND OTHER FACTORS ARE INCREASINGGLOBAL WARMING NOW, THEN WHAT ARE THE CHANCES THAT WE COULDHAVE A MASSIVE RELEASE OF METHANE FROM THE OCEANS SOME TIMETHIS CENTURY BECAUSE THE OCEANS ARE WARMING?That’s a good question. Currently we have a lot of temperature measurements downthrough the ocean columns. The water is warming, but the warming so far has beenconfined to about the upper two miles. Warming has not penetrated to the deepest oceanlevels. So, it’s going to take some time to warm that body of water mass. I don’t think thatwarming (deeply) can take place in this 21st century, but an uncontrolled greenhouse andincrease of global temperatures that will eventually penetrate into the deep ocean waterand could conceivably destabilize the methane in the deep ocean floor. WHAT IS THE DEPTH OF OUR DEEPEST OCEANS?The average depth of the ocean is about 2.5 miles. There are deeper places and shalloweron the continental shelves. We’ve seen warming measured down to about 1.5 miles rightnow.[ Editor's Note: Challenger Deep in the Mariana Trench is the deepest point inEarth's oceans. The bottom there is 35,840 feet or 6 miles (10,924 meters)below sea level. If Mount Everest, the highest mountain on Earth, were placedat this location it would be covered by over one mile of water. The ChallengerDeep is named after the British survey ship Challenger II, which discoveredthis deepest location in 1951. It was first explored by the deep-sea roboticvehicle, Nererus, designed by scientists at the Woods Hole OceanographicInstitution in 2009. ]We don’t know how long it has taken to warm up because we have been measuring oceansover large areas and at great depths for maybe half a century. So, we can see the warminghas taken place, but we only have computer models to theorize how long it has taken tomix the ocean from the warming that takes place at the surface to circulating that heatdown to greater depths. But the heating processes so far have not distributed heat to thedeep ocean bottom in any great amount yet. [ Ocean temperature monitoring by NOAA. ] Earth Oceans Were 100 Feet Higher3 Million Years AgoThere was a period of time only 3 million years ago when sea levels were about 100 feet"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"higher than now. It's not quite so clear what caused that, but it might have been a timewhen Greenland lost its ice and Antarctica had lost some of its ice, not all, but some. So,only 3 million years ago, sea levels were 100 feet higher than now and that shows you themagnitude of change that can occur in the context of the modern climate system. What Causes Earth's Ice Ages?The issue of what causes ice ages coming and going in a rhythmic or periodic pattern, wethink has to do with the orbit of the Earth around the sun and the orientation of the Earthto the sun.Earth tilted on its axis about 23.5 degrees and orbiting moon,both in revolution around the sun. Over a 40,000 year period, the Earthoscillates on its axis between 21 degrees and 24 degrees. The more the Earth is tilted,the more seasonal variability there is. Source: North Carolina State Unive rsity Earthinspace .There are 3 important factors:1) One is the shape of the Earth’s orbit around the sun. It is elliptical. But theellipse sometimes gets more elongated more like a cigar and sometimes muchless so and more like a circle. That effect determines how uniformly over ayear how the sunshine that reaches the Earth warms our planet. If you comevery close and then very far in a yearly excursion around the sun, then thedistance effect means you get much less sunshine. So, there is an amplificationof the seasons due to that changing orbital shape. That shape changes in aperiod of about 100,000 years.2) The tilt of the Earth’s axis currently is about 23.5 degrees, but thatoscillates between 21 degrees and 24 degrees with a period of a little over40,000 years. The more the Earth is tilted, the more seasonal variability thereis.3) Then the third effect is the orientation of Earth’s rotational axis that goesabout in a big processional circle – kind of like a spinning top will slowlywobble. That determines whether the elliptical effect and the tilt effectreinforce each other or work against each other in one hemisphere or another.The summary of all that is the orbital effects of tens of thousands of years of periods thatcreate effects where it can promote a lot of snowfall at high latitudes and that’s the start ofan ice age. The effects themselves would have to be amplified in other ways, which wedon't understand and puzzle about. But it’s clear in the timing of the ice ages that theseorbital effects are the pacemaker of past glaciations.HOW MUCH IMPACT COULD THE SUN HAVE?The sun, of course, is a big player in what I’ve just described because the orientation anddistance of the Earth from the sun determines how sunshine falls on the Earth. In terms ofshorter-term climate change, there are variations of energy from the sun that occur on alltime scales from daily to monthly to yearly and even longer periods. But in examiningthose variabilities in the context of the current warming of the Earth, the measurement ofradiation from the sun indicates that the sun has actually been in slight decline in the lasthalf of the 20th century. If that were the only factor playing a role, Earth would havecooled slightly. But in fact, Earth warmed dramatically, so we know there are other factorsbesides the sun."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Worst Case in A Melting World?WHAT IS THE WORST CASE IF THE PLANET CONTINUES TO WARM AND THEICE CONTINUES TO MELT?The worst case in global consequence is rising sea level. It will have many affects that aredifferent from place to place, but rising sea level is a major consequence that will have thebiggest social and political consequences because it will displace hundreds of millions ofpeople. So, sea level rise is at the top of my list and my own guess as to what we’ll see inthis century is anywhere from 3 to 6 feet.IS ONE OF THE IRONIES THAT AS ICE MELTS AND CHANGING TO WATER THATA CONSEQUENCE OF THE FUTURE COULD BE THERE IS MORE DROUGHTEVEN WITH THE MELTING WATER?That’s true. We’ll have an acceleration of the hydrological cycle, which means we willevaporate more water from the surface of the oceans and continents, so you’ll see soilmoisture loss, drought, but you’ll also more intense rainfall as that moisture rains downagain elsewhere. So, you’ll have both intense droughts and intense rainfalls. It’s anacceleration of the hydrological cycle that will have extreme perturbations.MORE DROUGHT IN SOME PLACES AND MORE WATER IN OTHERS.Ye s .IN COPENHAGEN, ARE YOU EXPECTING ANY DISCUSSION ABOUTGOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD HAVING ANY PLANNING ORMECHANISMS NOW FOR HANDLING THE HUGE CHALLENGE OF WHAT DOYOU DO WHEN ISLAND NATIONS GO UNDER WATER AND WHAT DO YOU DOAS LARGER NATIONS HAVE WATER COMING OVER THEIR SHORES THISCENTURY?It will always be in the (Copenhagen) background, but the principal discussions anddebates is how to slow the greenhouse blanket from getting thicker and better at trappingEarth’s heat. That has to be slowed down and reversed and that’s the central focus at theCopenhagen conference.WHAT DO YOU PERSONALLY THINK WOULD BE THE FASTEST AND MOSTEFFICIENT WAY OF GETTING A HANDLE ON CONTROLLING CO2 EMISSIONS?There is no silver bullet. But t he lowest hanging fruit is simply using less energy. It’sconservation and efficiency. The cost of that energy is effectively zero. If you don’t use it,you don’t pay for it and it’s not produced. What Can December 2009 CopenhagenClimate Meeting Accomplish?IF CHINA AND INDIA DON’T GO ALONG WITH THAT AS THE GOAL, WHAT DOYOU THINK THE CONSEQUENCES ARE OVER THE NEXT DECADES?China and India are still burning coal as is the U.S.A. But the country that learns how tobreak way from coal and petroleum and utilize renewable energy is going to be the leadingeconomy of the 21st Century and you can be certain that China wants that to be in China.They are already leading the way in wind energy. Europe is also leading in wind energy.The U. S. is lagging.All of the big energy users want to be the industrial leaders that lead us out of the carbonbased age. We’re going to see a lot of competition – NOT to see who will burn more coal.It will be competition to see who leads the industrial revolution of the 21st Century thatwill take us into a new energy environment.WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE THE FUTURE OF THIS EARTH IS HEADEDAND YOU’VE WRITTEN A BOOK THAT IS CALLED ‘A WORLD WITHOUT ICE,’WHAT IS YOUR GREATEST WORRY ABOUT WHERE WE ARE ALL HEADED?My greatest worry is that people don’t recognize the urgency of what needs to be done.There’s little question in my mind that rising sea levels and climate change and drought aregoing to catch peoples’ attention sooner or later. But we need to have it be sooner. So, it’smy biggest worry that the slowness of the developing awareness that this is a real problemand it has very severe consequences."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"I would like to see things addressed right away and I worry there will only be baby stepstaken and wait and see attitude. That will lead to situations that grow out of control and wewon’t be able to mitigate the problems.ALREADY NO ONE IS EXPECTING ANYTHING PRODUCTIVE OUT OFCOPENHAGEN.Well, I’m expecting something productive out of Copenhagen. I’m expecting that thebroad framework will be established and that the details of a new climate treaty will beworked out in the next six months.So, while the original hope was that the Copenhagen conference would actually write thetreaty, that’s not going to happen.
