The goal was to look for evidence of water. Spirit and Opportunity recentlycame out of 2008 winter hibernation and started their fifth Martian spring of exploring.Artist illustration of Spirit rover on edgeof Martian Gusev crater.

With all that subterranean magma heat, it is assumed that water ice in someMartian sites might have melted and perhaps even risen to the surface as hot springs orwarm artesian outwellings. Warm water on Earth usually means life and for a long time,scientists have been searching Mars for evidence of hot springs from an older time whenMars was much wetter.A year ago in May 2008, the Spirit rover on Mars churned one of its wheels into so muchwhite silica that scientists were stunned. The Spirit rover’s spectrometer showed the whitesubstance was more than 90% silica. To make such nearly pure silica requires a lot ofwater. On Earth, the only way to have so much silica is to have hot water running overrocks.The Martian location of that silica is a place called Home Plate in the Gusev Crater nearthe Martian equator where Spirit has been exploring since it landed in January 2004. Onthe other side of Mars near the equator is Spirit’s rover side kick, Opportunity. So, thisbegins the rovers’ fifth year of work on Mars and both rovers woke up from long winters’naps about a month ago. The exciting goal for Spirit is to go south toward a feature thatlooks like a volcanic cone and explore for evidence of lava and hot springs residues. Strangely, in the last week of January, Spirit stopped cooperating with NASA managersfor about ten hours. Spirit didn’t send back any record of what it was doing and whensignals were sent from Earth for Spirit to move, the rover didn’t move.This week I talked with a planetary geologist who follows Spirit in order to producedetailed maps of that rover’s every move. He is Larry Crumpler, Ph.D., Science TeamMember and Long Term Planning Lead for the Mars Exploration Rover Program andResearch Curator of Volcanology and Space Sciences, at the New Mexico Museum ofNatural History and Science in Albuquerque. Dr. Crumpler described the puzzlingfrustration of sending signals to Spirit during Sol 1800 the last week of January 2009, andfor the first time since January 2004 in the rover’s work on Mars, Spirit didn’t respond.Interview:Larry Crumpler, Ph.D., Research Curator for Volcanology and Space Scienceat the New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science in Albuquerque,New Mexico, and NASA Science Team Member and Long Term Planning Lead,Mars Exploration Rover Program.

It just was nottelling us what it did – which is unusual! It always tells us what it did, leaving us a recordof what it did (in its work).SO, SPIRIT CLAMMED UP IN A KIND OF MYSTERY.Yeah. One idea was that something went wrong with the gyroscope that tells it what itsposition is. So, we did a diagnostic on that and that came out just fine.SO, YOU DON’T EVEN HAVE AN ANSWER FOR WHY SPIRIT DIDN’T TALK BACKWITH YOU GUYS?Yeah, we don’t. One idea that was bandied about was that maybe there was a stray cosmicray hit and confused a sequence. Something like that.IN ALL OF SPIRIT’S WORK, IT HAS NEVER DONE ANYTHING LIKE THISBEFORE WHERE IT DIDN’T COMMUNICATE BACK WHAT IT WAS DOING ORMOVE WHEN YOU TOLD IT TO MOVE?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Yeah, not that I’m aware of. In this case, it was just like missing time! (laughs) It justdidn’t record anything and didn’t tell us what was going on.HOW LONG DID THAT RECALCITRANCE ON THE PART OF SPIRIT GO ON?Looks like it was between 5 AM and 2:48 PM (nearly 10 hours) on Sol 1800 in last weekof January 2009. It’s like the number one thing it (Spirit rover) does is record everythingthat it does ... and it didn’t! (laughs)HOURS ARE MISSING AND IT IS STILL A MYSTERY ABOUT WHAT ACTUALLYHAPPENED TO SPIRIT.Well, as of the last time I heard anything about it, it was a mystery.COULD IT BE THAT THESE ARE SIGNALS THAT THESE TWO ROVERS AREBEGINNING TO DETERIORATE AND MIGHT BE ON THEIR LAST LEGS, SO TOSPEAK?Well, none of the analyses indicated that. I mean, there is no indication of the degradationin the ability to communicate or for the antennas to point or to be able to determine theirpositions carefully. That all seems to be better than specifications.YOU ARE STILL EXPECTING THAT SPIRIT AND OPPORTUNITY ARE GOING TOBE ABLE TO DO WORK ON MARS FOR ANOTHER YEAR?Right now, they are no different than they were last year, other than having dusty solarpanels. But even Spirit has gotten a couple of panel cleaning events in the past month orso. (laughs) Martian Dust Devils Keep Rovers GoingSeveral dust devils photographed by NASA's Mars Exploration Rover,Spirit, on July 13, 2005, during its exploration of the Gusev Crater. Image courtesy NASA.Spirit rover cleaned by Martian dust devilbetween Sol 327 and Sol 432. These Martian wind-blown cleaningsof the rovers and their solar panels are keeping themachines powered. Images courtesy NASA.SO, THOSE WHIRLY WINDS HAVE COME OVER THE ROVERS AND CLEANEDOFF THE DUST, AS YOU HOPED WOULD HAPPEN?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yeah, we don’t know specifically if it is a dust devil or if it’s just general winds blowingacross the terrain. We must be getting gusts now because it is early spring on that (equator)part of Mars, so we’re getting some dust-cleaning events.IF YOU DIDN’T GET THESE DUST CLEANING EVENTS, SPIRIT ANDOPPORTUNITY MIGHT ACTUALLY STOP WORKING BECAUSE THEY COULDN’TGET ENOUGH ENERGY FROM THE SUN?Absolutely! Spirit was so dusty it was only generating like 25% of the power it’s supposedto. It’s gotten a couple of solar panel cleaning events and its power has jumped up to 25 to30 watt-hours.HOW FASCINATING THAT YOU SCIENTISTS ON EARTH ARE DEPENDING UPONWHIRLY WINDS ON MARS TO KEEP CLEANING OUR ROVER MACHINES TOKEEP THEM GOING!Yeah! The one thing that we have no control over is when the panels get cleaned. Initially,we assumed they would never get cleaned, so that’s why the missions were planned for 90sols or certainly no more than a year. But we learned that can happen, so now we kind ofrely on it! We’ve discovered it happens often enough – several times a year.BUT WITHOUT THAT WIND BLOW-OFF, BOTH ROVERS PROBABLY WOULDHAVE CEASED FUNCTIONING LONG AGO.Absolutely! They have been getting really dusty! Even the first year, we were starting tocreep downwards and then the next day (after whirly wind blew off dust), we were backup to the same power levels as when we landed. A big gust came along. And that helped uslast summer, too. Spirit was getting pretty low on power and then we had this big panel-cleaning event, so we shot up to 800 watt-hours or something like that. Silica Discovered by Spirit At Home PlateMars Reconnaissance Orbiter's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment imageshows the Spirit rover parked at its winter site on September 29, 2006, south of the Martianequator at the southeastern edge of the Elysium Planitia. The Low Ridge feature is where Spiritwas parked w ith an 11-degree northerly tilt to maximize sunlight on the solar panels during the Martiansouthern hemisphere winter season. Tracks made by Spirit on the way to Home Plate (possiblevolcanic feature) and to and from Tyrone, an area of light-toned soils exposed by rover wheelmotions, are also evident. In May 2008, one of Spirit's wheels churned up a white substance,which the rover's spectrometer confirmed was more than 90% silica. On Earth, silicais associated with lots of hot springs water. Image courtesy NASA.What is really interesting are the deposits that Spirit discovered during its last field seasonat Home Plate are some of the best evidence we’ve seen yet for the types of environmentsthat are habitable. Those deposits are just the spitting image of salicious center, which isonly produced in thermal hot spring deposits. (laughs) So, there were hot springs, hotwater, flowing somewhere there to generate these silica deposits that we discovered lastsummer."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"In May 2008, as the Spirit rover drove away from Tyrone near Home Plate,i ts j a mme d r i ght fr ont w he e l d ug thi s tr e nc h. The Mi ni - TES i ns tr ume nt c o nfi r me dthe white material is more than 90% silica. Image courtesy NASA.That’s one of the Holy Grail environments for potential early life and microbialcommunities. In short, a habitable situation, that would generate life. So, that was probablyone of the most significant results of either rover to date. I don’t get the sense that peopleunderstand the significance of it yet! (laughs) Spirit Rover Headed South of Home PlateSilica to Possible Volcanic FeatureWHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FORWARD TO THE MOST AS SPIRIT CONTINUES ITSEXPLORATION THIS YEAR?The idea is to get south of the area we’ve been in for a year or two and go to a new featurethat looks like some sort of explosive center, maybe a volcano. It’s kind of eroded andlooks like a volcano you might see in the New Mexico landscape where you have someerosion going on, but you still can see the original feature. So, that’s probably a good sitefor determining where the thermal energy came from for some of the possible spring-likefeatures we have seen. We want to get down there real fast.COULD THERE STILL BE ACTIVE VOLCANOES ON MARS?Ah, it’s entirely possible. The problem is the thermal energy on Mars is much more limitedthan it is on Earth. We know that volcanism is quite young for the largest volcanoes in theTharsis region (Olympus Mons and others). There are some volcanoes that look quiteyoung in the Athabasca region, maybe a million years old or less.[ Editor's Note: The recent geologic history of Athabasca Valles on Mars, theyoungest known lava-draped channel, is controversial. Some studies reportice-rich sediment in its channels, whereas others report only lava. Data fromthe High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera nowconfirm that, although certain features exhibit a superficial similarity toice-related landforms, solidified lava coats the entire channel system. Both thewater and the lava erupted from a few discrete sites (vents?) along theCerberus Fossae, a 1600-kilometer (1000-mile) long network of faults."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Water channels flowing from Cerberus Fossae in the Athabasca Valles of Elysium Planitia.Athabasca is the youngest known volcanic feature on Mars. Location is 9.6 degrees northlatitudeand 155.8 degrees east longitude. Picture taken with Mars Odyssey's THEMIS.Credit: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona.I WAS READING THAT OLYMPUS MONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN ERUPTING ASRECENTLY AS 2 MILLION YEARS AGO. [ 115 million to 2 million years ago. ]Yes. And the stuff in Athabasca is so fresh, it’s just like yesterday. The real question iswhat are the small features we see here and there around Mars?COULD THEY BE VOLCANIC VENTS?Maybe some could be some sort of strange spring deposit. All springs don’t have to bethermal.ARTESIAN?Yes. They aren’t hot springs. They are just regular ambient temperature springs.OSMOSIS BRINGING THE WATER UP THROUGH THE SOIL AT THAT PARTICULARPLACE?Yes, they make these nice little mounds with a crater on top.IF SPIRIT CAN GET TO THE VOLCANIC FEATURE THIS YEAR, DOES THE ROVERHAVE ANY WAY TO DETERMINE THE AGE OF THE SOILS THERE?Nothing about the age, but it can assess the chemistry. For age, you really have to bring asample back to determine that.BUT, WE ARE STILL OPERATING UNDER THE IDEA THAT THERE HAS BEENVOLCANISM ON MARS, PERHAPS AS RECENTLY AS A MILLION YEARS AGO INATHABASCA VALLES AND THERE MIGHT BE SOME MECHANISM THAT ISHEATING UNDERGROUND AND CAUSING PERIODIC SPRINGS OF LIQUIDWATER TO COME OUT ON THE SURFACE?Perhaps in some places.WARMTH AND WATER ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LIFE.That’s right.”Continued in Part 2: Hot Springs in Arabia Terra?More Information:[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “ Olympus Mons is a shield volcano that is the tallest knownvolcano in the Solar System, located in the Tharsis bulge, a huge swelling in the Martiansurface that bears numerous other large volcanic features. Among them are a chain oflesser shield volcanoes including Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons and Ascraeus Mons. Thevolcanoes in the Tharsis region are 10 to 100 times larger than those on Earth. They were"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"built from large magma chambers deep within the Martian crust. The Martian flows arealso much longer. This is probably due to larger eruption rates and to lower gravity. One ofthe reasons volcanoes of such magnitude were able to form on Mars is because the hotvolcanic regions in the mantle remained fixed relative to the surface for hundreds ofmillions of years.The land immediately surrounding Olympus Mons is depressed 2 kilometers deep. Basedon crater size and frequency counts, the surface of this western scarp has been dated from115 million years old down to a region that is only 2 million years old. This is very recentin geological terms, suggesting that the mountain may yet have some ongoing volcanicactivity.Elysium Planitia is the second largest volcanic region on Mars. Elysium Planitia is centeredon a broad dome that is 1,700 by 2,400 kilometers (1,060 by 1,490 miles) in size. It hassmaller volcanoes than the Tharsis region, but a more diverse volcanic history. Threesignificant volcanoes include Hecates Tholus, Elysium Mons and Albor Tholus.Not all Martian volcanoes are classified as shields with effusive lava eruption styles. Northof the Tharsis region lays Alba Patera. This volcano is comparable to Olympus Mons in itshorizontal extent but not in height. Its base diameter is 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) but isless than 7 kilometers (4.3 miles) high. Ceraunius Tholus is one of the smaller volcanoes. Itis about the size of the Big Island of Hawaii and exhibits explosive eruption characteristicsand probably consists of ashdeposits. Tyrrhena Patera and Hadriaca Patera both havedeeply eroded features, which indicate explosive ash eruptions Mt. St. Helens is anexample of an Earth ash eruption.”] For further reports about Mars, please see Earthfiles Archive:• 01/25/2009 — Methane Mystery On Mars• 08/05/2008 — Perchlorate Discovery by Phoenix Lander Does Not End Search for Life OnMars• 05/29/2008 — Phoenix Robotic Arm Preparing to Dig Into Martian Permafrost• 12/16/2005 — MARSIS Radar Looking Below Surface of Mars• 11/18/2005 — Is the Sun Heating Up?• 11/09/2005 — Dust Storm On Mars, Cosmic First Light and Black Hole At Our Galaxy'sCenter• 08/24/2005 — Dust Devils and \"Lemon Rinds\" on Mars• 06/23/2005 — Mars Express Orbiter Finally Turns On Deep Ground-Penetrating Radar• 03/20/2005 — Astronaut John Young: \"The Moon Can Save Earth's Civilization.\"• 03/04/2005 — Subterranean Life On Earth - and Mars?• 02/26/2005 — Mars Spirit Rover Discovered Boundary Between Gusev Lava and Older,Water-Soaked Rocks in \"Columbia Hills\"• 02/22/2005 — Frozen Sea Near Martian Equator Size of Lake Michigan• 09/21/2004 — Part 2: Martian Water Ice and Organic Molecules - NASA Will Look for'Uni que Si gns of Li fe' on Mars• 09/20/2004 — Part 1: Martian Water Vapor and Methane Overlap in Equatorial Regions• 07/22/2004 — Is Physicist Vittorio Formisano's Mars Data Being Suppressed by ESA?• 05/06/2004 — Formaldehyde, Ammonia and Benzene Molecules on Mars?
