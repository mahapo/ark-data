March 30, 2009 Gainesville, Florida - The mysterious disappearance of hundreds ofEuropean honey bee colonies in Pennsylvania was first reported in late fall 2006. In thepast three years, the baffling empty hive syndrome called Colony Collapse Disorder(CCD) has been reported in many parts of the world. Some beekeepers have lost nearly100% of their bees. Even though nicotine-based pesticides are high on the culprit list, todate, scientists have not been able to pinpoint the exact cause - and empty hives continue -although the good news is that American bees are not disappearing as rapidly as theywere.A year ago, the California almond growers were so worried about getting enough honeybees to pollinate their valuable almond crop that there were discussions about importingMexico’s Africanized honey bees to fill the gap created by disappearing European honeybees that have traditionally been the main American pollinator.The Apiary Assistant Chief in Florida’s Department of Agriculture in Gainesville, Florida,is Jerry Hayes. He never thought using Africanized honey bees to pollinate almond or anyother crop was a good idea. He has long worried that the encroachment of Africanizedbees into the southern United States would bring violence and speed the elimination ofcalmer European honey bees since the aggressive and tough Africanized honey bees takeover genetically."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Ironically, as 2009 came with the severe financial collapse that keeps rippling around theworld like dominoes falling, orders for almonds fell off sharply. Now, almond growers aredesperate to save money in a declining market and have even plowed under almondacreages! That means less pollination demands on the European honey bees this spring,which might help them recover more strongly. But surging even stronger are theAfricanized honey bees making their own way from Mexico into the southern states wherethey can survive year round and are viciously attacking people and animals.Recently I asked Jerry Hayes for a current update on colony collapse disorder and theAfricanized bee threat. He begins with the surprising decline in almond demand, a cropentirely dependent upon honey bee pollination.Interview:Jerry Hayes, Assistant Chief, Bureau of Plant and Apiary Inspection, Division ofPlant Industry, Florida Department of Agriculture, Gainesville, Florida: : “Thesituation for almond pollination has changed. With the economy, almonds are not asvaluable and then in California, they are having major water irrigation issues in agriculture.Almond groves have actually been bulldozed. Others are not being irrigated so they won’tproduce a crop. But of course, there are others that still need pollination.WHAT YOU MEAN IS THAT THE COMBINATION OF DROUGHT AND WATERPROBLEMS, PLUS THE ECONOMY AND REDUCTION IN DEMAND FORALMONDS, THAT SOME ALMOND ACREAGE HAS EVEN BEEN PLOWED UNDERAND THAT MEANS LESS DEMAND FOR THE HONEY BEES.Right, less demand for honey bees and then almond growers were concerned earlier aboutgetting enough pollination, they negotiated contracts early on for $150 per colony. Andthen with these things that have popped up, they went back to re-negotiate or to cancelcontracts with beekeepers, unlike things we’ve done with A.I.G. But I’m not bitter, OK?(laughs)A.I.G. GETS BAILED OUT, BUT THE POOR HONEY BEE KEEPERS DO NOT GETBAILED OUT BY ANYBODY.Nobody gets bailed out by anybody. The almond growers are left to fend for themselvesand the old question remains: do we care where our food comes from (international foodimports to the U. S. continue to rise with unknown consequences.)WHAT IS YOUR OWN ASSESSMENT AS ASSISTANT CHIEF OF THE AP IARYDIVISION IN FLORIDA’S DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE ABOUT WHAT ISHAPPENING NOW TO THE EUROPEAN HONEY BEE DECLINE?We still do not know. We still think it’s a combination of stressors – nutrition problems,pesticides, environmental changes in moving colonies for pollination, pathogens.I was watching some show on PBS the other night and it was about striped bass and howthe populations of striped bass have fallen. If you had switched the words striped bass forhoney bees, it was the same thing from researchers on striped bass – poor environment, thewater is bad and because the water is bad and we are over-fishing, the fish don’t haveenough nutrition. Then because of that, secondary pathogens move in and there isover-fishing on the striped bass themselves. The thought for me was, ‘Golly! Maybe honeybees were the canaries in the mineshaft, alerting us to the things that are now happening toother species. It certainly seems like we’re poisoning ourselves.HAVE YOU BEEN GETTING REPORTS FROM FLORIDA HONEY BEE KEEPERSABOUT THEM OPENING UP HIVES AND FINDING A LOT OF EMPTY ONES INTHIS WINTER TO SPRING 2009?Yes, we have. Opening up some colonies and the bees appear to be gone, similar to"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CCD-like symptoms. Others that the bees are weak and are not building up. Theirpopulation is not increasing as it normally would, but these reports are dramatically lessthan they have been in the past couple of years.FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE, COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER IS STILL APHENOMENON THAT IS AFFECTING HONEY BEES IN NORTH AMERICA ANDOTHER PLACES?Yes, absolutely! Hopefully, we are on the downhill slide, but is it Darwin in action that haskilled off all the weak and the survivors are the ones that are reproducing?WELL, I’M CURIOUS WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF THAT LATE FEBRUARY 2009ARTICLE OUT OF THE BBC IN WHICH THE HEADLINE SAID SOMETHINGABOUT COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER NOT BEING A DISEASE ANDQUESTIONING THE CCD PHENOMENON.IT WAS AS IF SOMEONE WANTED TO PRESENT SOMETHING IN THE WORLDMEDIA THAT THERE WAS NOTHING TO COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER. DIDYOU READ IT? AND IF SO, WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION?I was rather shocked because we certainly have amassed data over the last couple of yearsnot only in the United States, but in Europe and Asia that this phenomenon has been goingon. It’s a bizarre shock coming from the BBC because you expect the BBC to have itsducks better lined up in a row than it did in this particular article.AND WHAT WAS REALLY PECULIAR WAS BURIED ON PAGE 3 OF THATARTICLE WAS THE ACTUAL HEART OF WHAT SO MANY BEEKEEPERS THINKIS THE PROBLEM AND THAT’S THE NICOTINE-BASED PESTICIDES.THIS SAME BBC REPORTER SAID THEY CAUSE MEMORY PROBLEMS IN THEBEES SO THEY CANNOT GET BACK TO THEIR HIVES. AND I THOUGHT, WHYISN’T THIS THE LEAD ON THIS BBC STORY?Well, yeah. That’s well documented. Research on that, we have lots of data from Europe. Ijust read a research report from Taiwan – all the data is the same. Neonicotinoids, andsome other pesticides as well, affect honey bee short term and long-term memories andmany other things. I’m not quite sure where the BBC was going with all that stuff.YOU AND I HAVE TALKED OVER THE PAST YEAR THAT IF COLONY COLLAPSEDISORDER CONTINUED TO DECIMATE THE HONEY BEE POPULATION THATALMOND GROWERS AND OTHERS MIGHT HAVE TO TURN TO MEXICO FORAFRICANIZED BEES FOR POLLINATION. RECENTLY YOU WERE TALKING TONPR ABOUT THIS VERY QUESTION OF WHAT IS THE IMPACT OF THEAFRICANIZED BEES IN THE UNITED STATES.Let me just set the stage here. The European bees that we have are temperate bees. Theyevolved in a temperate climate that has seasons – winter being the most significant – sothat’s why over time, the bees that stored the most honey could make it through winterbecause they had something to eat. That’s why humankind had a relationship with honeybees, at least initially is for the production of the food, honey. But the European bees donot do well in tropical and sub-tropical climates because there are no seasons for the mostpart.In 1957, the Brazilians had the great idea, let’s go to some place in the same latitude andbring bees back that might be more adapted to tropical and sub-tropical conditions inBrazil. So, they went to Africa and got some bees, and I’ll cut to the chase: the Braziliansbrought bees over with little concern or testing of what these bees would do, how theywould interact in the new environment.I think bringing African bees to Brazil in 1957 for hybridization experiments was theenvironmental blunder of the 20th Century! They brought an insect over (to Brazil)without knowing anything about its biology, how it would act, how it would react, what it"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"would do.So, they brought these African bees to Brazil and found over time that they were highlydefensive, highly aggressive, and that they were a super bee. They out bred, theydominated genetically and biologically in mating and breeding the European bee.So, fast forward to right now – the Africanized bee has taken over most of South America,Central America, Mexico and has moved into the United States. Our population in Floridacame, we think on shipping traffic as reproductive swarms that were hitchhiking on shiptraffic coming to our deep-water ports in Florida. We now have about 500 traps set alongthe coastline at port areas, but the Africanized bees don’t always select our traps, so theyenter the environment and now are filling up our North American tropical and sub-tropicalenvironment, out breeding and out competing European bees that were in the wildpopulation. Hundreds of Africanized honey bee stingersleft in a beekeeper's leather glove after an attack.Image source Florida Dept. of Agriculture.Africanized honey bees, known also as “ killer bees,” are a hybrid produced by geneticallycombining African honey bee with various European honey bee species. Visually, youcan’t tell an Africanized honey bee from a European honey bee – they look the same. Itstarted in 1957, when Brazilian biologists brought a collection of honey bees from thesame latitude in Africa as honey bee colonies in Brazil. The idea was to use the tropicalAfrican honey bees to create a stronger and more abundant honey-producing bee thatwould do well in Brazil. None of the scientists anticipated that the quick-tempered,aggressive traits of the African bees would dominate after genetic hybridization. Further,twelve of the hybridized and aggressive “Africanized honey bees” escaped the biology laband started to mate with drones in Brazil. The highly aggressive Africanized hybrids havebeen spreading ever since and reached Texas in 1990.If you disturb a European honey bee hive, perhaps twenty or thirty guard bees will flyaround warning the intruder away. But Africanized bees mobilize their whole colony toattack – and that can be tens of thousands of bees. They swarm fast into a raging, stingingmob that can kill humans and animals.Another big difference between Africanized honey bees and European honey bees is thatthe Africans will swarm as many as seventeen times a year. The much calmer Europeanhoney bees only swarm a couple of times a year."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Thousands of Africanized honey bees swarming in tree.Manuel Trevino in San Diego, Texas, near Corpus Christi on April 11, 2007,was stung by more than 1,000 Africanized bees that attacked him while he was working onhis ranch.

They aremean. They’re insane. They are hostile!”Four days earlier on Saturday, March 21, in Las Vegas, Nevada, a 53-year-old man washospitalized after being stung at least 2,000 times by Africanized honey bees after heoverturned a large rock with a backhoe and exposed a huge, 50-pound beehive.The Clark County Fire Department responded with fire hoses to wash down the victimwho was said to have a “black mass of bees on his back repeatedly stinging him.” A year ago on April 10, 2008, an Okeechobee County, Florida, resident was stung morethan 100 times by Africanized bees and died in an allergic reaction – the first reportedhuman death of bee stings in Florida.In 2005, a 900-pound horse in Hendry County, Florida, was stung to death. In 2002, 8% ofDNA samples sent to the Florida Department of Agriculture were Africanized. By 2007,40% of the DNA samples turned out to be from Africanized bees - and the percentagecontinues to rise. The consequence is that most of the wild honey bee colonies in Floridaare now the more aggressive Africanized bees that can kill.Jerry Hayes says he is so worried about the Africanized bees doing violence in Florida thathe wakes up at night wondering what he can do about it.Interview:Jerry Hayes: “Our only Florida human fatality so far was in April 2008, when agentleman was clearing an old agricultural barn and some fuel tanks a couple miles fromthe main road. We also lost a 900-pound horse in 2005. And as of yesterday (March 17,2009), Africanized honey bee attacks have killed 20 dogs, goats and sheep."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"HOW DO AFRICANIZED BEES KILL A HUMAN AND KILL A HORSE AND ALLTHE ANIMALS THAT ARE DYING?All bees are defensive. They want to protect their home, their babies, their resources.European bees, if you disturb their colonies might send out 20 or 30 guard bees to assessthe situation and then if it’s perceived as bad, they try to drive off the perceived threat.Africanized honey bees, because they evolved in a very harsh part of Africa – a lot ofpredators including humans and honey badgers – the weak bees were killed and the strong,aggressive survived. That’s what the Brazilians brought over. So, these Africanized beeswill mobilize virtually the whole colony of tens of thousands of bees and simply throughmass stinging will kill either the perceived threat or drive them away.One of the unfortunate things is that one of the last target acquisitions that Africanizedbees use is CO2 (carbon dioxide). So, the bees will fly up the CO2 plume that an animal orperson is exhaling or when they are screaming and go up your nose and your mouth andsting as they go down those airways, causing very quick swelling. So most of the deathsare not caused by swelling, but by asphyxiation (swelling and cutting off airways.)The horse that we lost – the vet at the necropsy found 3 or 4 pounds of Africanized bees inthe horse’s lungs and its stomach. So, it’s a pretty dramatic way to go.IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU JUST SAID, THAT 3 TO 4 POUNDS OFAFRICANIZED BEES FLEW UP INTO THE HORSE’S NOSE AND MOUTHBECAUSE THE BEES WERE TRACKING AFTER THE EXHALED CO2?Yes, ma’am. And this is not unusual. There have been other deaths of humans and animalsin the southwestern United States. Yeah, this is one of the things that the Africanizedhoney bees do.Brazil, I think, has something like 300 human fatalities a year. Venezuela has about 400human fatalities. This is a pretty dramatic and significant way to die and we certainly don’twant to do that anymore.AND THAT THE AFRICANIZED BEE WILL ACTUALLY TARGET CO2 BEINGEXHALED FROM WHATEVER THE BEES ARE ATTACKING TO GO RIGHT FORTHE CO2 AND INTO THE ANIMAL OR HUMAN.Or human, yes.HAD THE VETERINARIAN EVER SEEN 3 TO 4 POUNDS OF BEESE INSIDE OF ASTOMACH OF A HORSE BEFORE?Not that he related.IT’S JUST KIND OF MIND BLOWING.It is. And horses, in this particular case, have a small airway and so if you have beesclimbing in your nose and down your throat and stinging, those mucous membranes swellquite rapidly and you asphyxiate. This horse was in a stall! Our recommendation is foranybody who has an altercation with stinging insects, whether honey bees or not, is to runand get away and get inside some place. Here we had a horse in a stall. Most of the dogsthat have died have been in kennels or restrained some how. Goats and sheep just can’t getaway.Unfortunately, our human fatality was a gentleman who was clearing some old agriculturalbarn and some fuel tanks a couple of miles away from the main road. This old fuel tankwas open. It had no fuel in it and the Africanized bees had nested in there. He had taken a"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"backhoe and knocked this thing to the ground. The bees came out to see who wasattacking their home and saw him and he could not make it to the main road. It was prettydramatic.THE BEES ARE FAST AND THEY SWARM AS AN ENTIRE HIVE MASS.Pretty much, yes.AND BECAUSE THEY ARE FOLLOWING THAT CO2 AND ARE GOING INTO THEMOUTH, THE NOSEAND DOWN INTO THE THROAT AND STINGING THE WHOLEWAY, ESSENTIALLY THE THROAT AND THE TRACHEA WOULD SWELL UP ANDTHERE WOULD BE NO POSSIBILITY OF BREATHING.Exactly right.IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY, YOU ARE HAVING INCREASED NUMBERS OFAGGRESSIONS BY THE AFRICANIZED BEES, INCLUDING YOUR FIRST ATTACKAND DEATH ON A HUMAN, A HORSE, ALL OF THIS INCREASING EVEN INTOTHE SPRING OF 2009, AND THAT THE AFRICANIZED BEE WILL BASICALLYGET RID OF THE CALM, DOMESTIC HONEY BEE WHEREVER THEAFRICANIZED BEES GO, CORRECT?Yes, and the reason for that is that the genes for aggressiveness and defensiveness aredominant, carried by the drone male bee. The Africanized bees will interbreed at first andhybridize. But because of the genetic dominance, over a period of time the Europeancharacteristics go away and these aggressive and defensive characteristics prevail.DO YOU THINK IT’S REALISTIC TO EXPECT THAT FLORIDA AND OTHERBEEKEEPING STATES ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BLOCK THE TAKING OVERBY THE AFRICANIZED BEE?No, I don’t. I was in Guyana, South America, several months ago and was on a beekeeping tour. Theyhave had Africanized bees, I think, since 1974 when these bees moved from Brazil toGuyana (northeast coast of South America between Brazil and Venezuela). Guyanabeekeepers have been working with Africanized bees for 30 or 35 years or so and areconfident that they can manage these bees.They took us out to an area of the jungle that had been cleared and that there wereprobably some 50 Africanized bee colonies there. We had been assured that thebeekeepers knew what they were doing and that everything would be safe and well and sothey drove a bus of us up to about 300 yards away from the apiary with these colonies. Wegot off the bus and walked towards the apiary. Everybody said everything is OK and therewere people out there and they had very large smokers. If you are aware that beekeepersuse smokers to control bees, but these smokers are very large, kind of trash can size.And I’m getting to be an old guy and I looked around and I said, ‘This doesn’t look realgood to me.’ So, I just calmly walked back to the bus and started making friends with thebus driver thinking that if something goes bad, I want to see it from a distance. And smokeis billowing and people have their bee suits on and veils and they are looking in hivesAnd then, there was the first scream. The bees were fine until they had reached sometrigger level that they did not want anybody manipulating them any more. So, the beesmobilized themselves and people were being stung. One man running through the busheshad a tree limb grab his protective veil and rip it off and he was stung severely. He had to"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"go to the hospital ultimately and many other people were stung. So, as a good American, Igot in the bus and put the windows up in the bus, knowing that my friends would becoming back.They came back and got in the bus and we drove about another 300 yards to main roadaround the jungle and the Africanized bees had given up at that point, which is prettytypical, and people were getting out. There was swelling and people were telling warstories.Then all of a sudden, this herd of goats comes tearing out of the jungle. The Africanizedbees, looking for any perceived threat, were attacking some goats that were in the jungleand drove them out.Then the first thing I thought to myself was, ‘We can’t do this in Florida! This won’twork!’That just mobilized my thoughts even more of public safety and safety of the beekeepingindustry. What can we do to protect the industry so they can have manageable coloniesand not be zoned and ordinanced out of beekeeping?IS THERE AN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION?I don’t know. I’m making up a lot as we go along. Certainly there are other states in theUnited States that have had Africanized bees. HOW ELSE COULD YOU EVER STOP THE AFRICANIZATION OF NORTHAMERICAN BEES AND BEES EVERYWHERE UNLESS YOU GO INTO A GENETICPROGRAM THAT WOULD CHANGE THE GENETICS OF THE AFRICANIZED BEE?No, you’re absolutely right. But, we still have places in North America and Canada thathave winter, that have significant winters where this tropical bee cannot live year round.So, we can access queens, the fertile females, from these areas. Part of our bestmanagement practices is to encourage beekeepers to access queen bees of knownparentage from northern regions, have them marked in such a way that when thebeekeeper checks his or her colony, they know that that queen is in fact the mother of allthose bees in the colony. And if the queen is not, then she needs to be replaced with aqueen that is marked and has these characteristics.So, that’s one of the key elements of our best management practices. We think we can helpthe beekeepers maintain manageable colonies even though the wild feral environmentmight be full of Africanized bees. This is why it’s important for beekeepers to be thoughtof as part of the solution because these manageable colonies will put out also drones thatwill mate with Africanized queens.Will this stop the aggressiveness and defensiveness? No, it won’t, but it will tone it downand tame it down so we hopefully we’ll at least have a population that is not as defensiveand not as aggressive as a pure Africanized bee population would be. IS THERE A LATITUDE IN THE UNITED STATES ABOVE WHICH THEAFRICANIZED BEES WILL NOT GO BECAUSE OF COLD?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"For year round? Everyone has summer, so theoretically these Africanized bees can existeverywhere during the summertime. But there is probably a line at Tennessee, NorthCarolina where below that latitude, the bees can live year round, but not above that line –probably like the tide going in and out. The Africanized bees might wash across in thesummertime and then be pushed back in the wintertime.DOES BRAZIL TRY TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE VIOLENCE OF THE BEES IFTHEY ARE LOSING 300 HUMANS A YEAR TO THE VIOLENT ATTACKS?They have been doing this for 50 years and it is what it is. In some cases, the Brazilianslike the Africanized bees. You certainly don’t have a problem with somebody stealing yourcolonies. And because these Africanized bees swarm so often and asexually reproduce.Our American honey bees will send out a swarm maybe once, twice or three times a year.Africanized bees will swarm 15, 16 or 17 times a year and this is how they dominate thegenetic landscape so much. So, if their bees die, they can leave their colonies out thereand more Africanized bees will fill up the hives and so the Brazilians will suit up andprotect themselves and try to guard their chickens and their pigs – and then cross yourfingers!”Source Florida Dept. of Agriculture."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"Africanized honey bees will chase a victim at least a quarter mileat nearly 15 mph.
