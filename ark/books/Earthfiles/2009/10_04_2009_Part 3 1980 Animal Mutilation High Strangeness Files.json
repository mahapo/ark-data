Allen Hynek, Ph.D., Astronomer Return to Part 1October 4, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - The following continues from Parts 1 and2 in the 1980 animal mutilation high strangeness summary I typed up for my privateresearch files and am now sharing for the first time in this Real X-Files series. Addresses,phone numbers and some names of ranchers and eyewitnesses have been deleted.May 1980May 4 - North of Franktown, Colorado, ranch of Leroy Evans: 3-year-oldHereford cow had rectum and internal female organs cored out; 4 teats cut off,bag left intact. Sheriff George Yarnell investigated this one and said it wasdefinitely an unusual mutilation. Later, perhaps after talking with veterinarianWoody Smith, Yarnell told rancher Evans it wasn't a mutilation, but onlypredator. Evans was puzzled.May 12 - North of Falcon in Black Forest near Colorado Springs,Colorado, ranch of George McCune: On Hogen Road eleven miles north ofFalcon on Meridian Road (northeast corner of Black Forest near ColoradoSprings, George McCune's neighbor, Mr. Cichorz, was in bed asleep at 1:30 AMon May 12, 1980. His two large dogs were asleep on the floor in his bedroom.Then they were going crazy, barking and jumping against the walls.Cichorz heard a very high-pitched noise like some kind of machine and got up.He opened the door, let the dogs out and turned on a porch spotlight facing thepasture on the hill. As he did, the noise stopped and everything was quiet again.At 6 AM, Cichorz called George McCune to tell him he found a dead cow onthe pasture hill. McCune could not believe it because just the day before he hadheard about the Robert Blake horse mutilation and had decided that the next dayhe would move his cows out of the hill pasture because he had had fourmutilations there since 1976, ALL WITHIN 700 to 800 FEET OF EACHOTHER. He was not going to take any chances they would be hit again. Yet,Something got to his cow during the night.The cow was uncut, no wounds anywhere. McCune is convinced that if Cichorzhad not interrupted the phenomenon, the cow would have been mutilated insome way. McCune had seen his cow alive and well in the afternoon before onMay 11, 1980.McCune had paid $600 for the cow that spring and said she was a good, healthycow. After McCune learned that Cichorz had heard the high-pitched machinenoise, he called the Sheriff because he thought maybe he could get someinsurance money. The deputy sheriff went out, but never filed a report! So, theinsurance company never paid McCune anything.Previous mutilations on same hill planted with early grass by George McCune:1976 1 Cow - First one on the hill pasture. The bag was cut. \"Ididn't know what it was. Coyotes had been on her bad. But I"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"wondered what had killed her in the first place?\"1977 2 Cows - Two mutes on the hill pasture, 17 days apart andonly 15 feet apart.The first cow had her tongue cut out deeply within her throat. Oneteat was removed and the rectum was cored out; female organswere gone. McCune didn't know what to do with the cow, so hedragged her off into a nearby ditch.Seventeen days later, in the same ditch about 15 feet further away,McCune found a second mutilated cow. It was a registeredHereford with an eyeball removed, rectum cored out and femaleorgans removed. McCune said that second cow appeared to havebeen dropped from the air because the cow's neck was folded underher body. McCune said he couldn't get over the fact that the secondmutilation was so close to the same spot to where he dragged thefirst one.1978 1 Cow - McCune said it was another mutilated cow, but hedidn't want to remember the details. Then came the high-pitchednoise and another dead cow on May 12, 1980.May 25 - North of New Raymer, Colorado, ranch of Ross Younglund: Ross Younglund and his brother, Walter, and Walter's son, Monty ranchtogether 19 miles straight north of New Raymer, Colorado. Monty Younglundwas riding his horse along a section line when he came upon five cows all in astraight line along the section line over a distance of about 1.5 miles. Each cowwas facing north.Of the five cows, all about 6 to 8 years old, the one furthest east on the sectionline had clearly died of larkspur poisoning, bloated, and coyotes had eaten intoher pretty badly.But the other four animals going west in a line never bloated and the coyotes didnot touch them.a) Each of the four cows had a \"perfect square cut out of belly where the udderhad been.\" It was a straight-edge cut, no tears, said Younglund.b) All four had the rectums cored out about 6 inches wide and 4 to 6 inchesdeep.c) Never looked to see if tongue was there or not.d) All four cows had their legs drawn up funny underneath them, \"as if theywere set down and sort of crumpled on their legs either before or after death.\"e) The ground around the larkspur-poisoned cow was kicked up all aroundwhere she had flailed before death. The other four cows had no tracks aroundthem, no blood, no messed up ground or anything else.f) Two of the cows were on a wheat stubble field; three were on buffalo grass.g) In two of the cows, one half of the face was gone down to the bone. The earon that excised jawbone was cut down to the skull. The other two cow headswere untouched.h) Underneath one cow, Younglund discovered at the center of her belly around patch of hair was gone, but the hide was still intact. Doesn't remember ifhe saw this on only one cow or some of the others, too.May 27 - 4 miles NE of Simla, Colorado, Scott Richardson ranch: A1-year-old steer was found by foreman Wayne Bosies on Tuesday, May 27, 1980,who estimated the steer had been killed between May 24 when last seen and May27, when Wayne found the dead and mutilated animal. I drove out to Simla andpersonally saw the steer on the evening of May 30, and it seemed pretty fresheven then. No bloat and completely untouched by predators.The steer was lying on its right side and its left ear facing skyward was cut off atthe scalp. The rectum was cored out (smaller that most other mutilations I'veseen and was a precisely round, 2-3 inch diameter hole). The tongue wasremoved and there was an odd .5 inch cut on the cow's back side.Bosies says he has seen six mutilations between 1978 and 1980 - all wereunreported:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"1 horse south of Couch3 steers north of Simla2 cows 4 miles NW of SimlaMay 29 - Simla, Colorado, on Lyle Hamacher ranch: Rancher LyleHamacher on May 29, 19880, found a 1-year-old heifer dead and mutilated. Heestimated she was pretty fresh, maybe dead one day or two. Heifer found within400 to 500 yards east of the first mutilation Hamacher had in September 1975,that was also a heifer. He has had five mutilations total since September 1975.The May 29th mute was only 4 miles east of Richardson's May 26, steermutilation.The Hamacher heifer was missing: a) Right earb) Right eyec) Tail - \"Tail was cut off clear into tail bone and hair covered over where thetail had been so it was hard to see where it was cut off. When I separated thehair, it looked brown, sort of burned.\"d) Rectum cored out 6 to 8 inches wide and about 4 to 5 inches deep.e) Tongue? \"Didn't even look. I dropped the chain around her and dragger herout of the wheat field.\" Hamacher went on about how it costs too much time toleave them for a Sheriff's inspection \"and the Sheriff isn't going to do anythinganyway!\" This heifer was in the middle of the same wheat field he has grazedheifers on for several years.Miscellaneous Note: In May 1980 in Colorado Springs, the El Paso CountySheriff's Deputy, Scott Butler, was on dispatch and received a radio report froma woman who called in and said she saw a beam of light panning a herd of cowsin her field. No noise - only saw beam of light and called sheriff. When deputygot there, the light beam had disappeared.Chuck Johnson of Colorado Springs, who called me about this and is a friend ofScott Butler, said the sheriff's office is \"keeping the story hush, hush\" forreasons unknown. June 1980June 9 - About two to three weeks after Younglund found the five cows on May25, 1980, a girl was riding on a pasture about 5 or 6 miles west of Leo Smith'sranch and found another calf that had both ears cut off on June 9, 1980.Around that time, the same girl also found a calf missing both ears on PaulMurdock's ranch north of Carpenter, Wyoming, about 7 miles north of LeoSmith's ranch. The ranchers thought both calves had been dead about one week.I asked Monty Younglund how he compared predator damage he has seen withthe mutilated cows: \"On the one cow to the east where the coyotes had been ather, her rectum was torn out about a foot to a foot and a half wide and it waspretty jagged and I could see clear down to the bone. On the other four cows,the rectums were smaller holes that were pretty much perfectly round as if coredout by something.\"Monty Younglund asked the ranch's hired men if they had seen or heardanything, but they had not.June 13 - Deer Trail, Colorado 39 miles northeast of Kiowa on Pearl andMike Hageman ranch: The ranch is southwest of Deer Trail. On June 13,Mike Hageman found a big, black, white-faced steer 60 feet north of hisproperty line in a Mr. Mock's pasture. Mock lives in Limon and never saw thesteer.Hageman called Sheriff George Yarnell, Elbert County, in Elizabeth, Colorado,who went out, examined the steer and said it was a mutilation. Yarnell also tookphotos.a) Tongue gone.b) Both ears gone.c) 4 - 6 inch \"complete circle\" of hide taken from right back hip.d) Tail in tact, but tail tassel cut off and scattered on ground.e) No tracks.f) No blood, \"Not a drop anywhere,\" said Hageman.Hageman said he personally has never had a mutilation that he knows about."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"This was the first one he has ever seen and he said it was definitely a mutilation- \"I've never seen anything like this before.\"I asked him how many of his cows have died each year and he said probably oneor two a year. Those disease and predator deaths he understands. But the one onJune 13, 1980, was completely different.June 14 - Ramah, Colorado, on Alice and Jack Blasingame ranch, acrossthe highway from Larry Mikita's ranch to the north: The Blasingames haveranched since 1945. Mrs. Blasingame said: \"This is not the work of anypredators.\" Found 6-year-old cow, 1000 pounds, Hereford, dead and mutilated.a) Rectum cored out 4 inches wide by 24 inches deep.b) Right eye and skin around eye cut away; lying on left side.c) Ear cut flush at scalp,no blood.d) 4 teats missing.e) Rain sprinkled ground, but no tracks.f) No predators went near the mutilated carcass; coyotes did not touch it.This was the Blasingames' first mutilation.June 25 - Limon, Colorado on Jerry Monks ranch: 2-year-old Herefordfemale pastured on Leo Englert's place, was found lying on her right side withleft ear and eye excised. No blood. Found lying underneath a tree near a pond.Dusty ground, but no tracks around Hereford. No necropsy done by vet.a) Left ear cut off.b) Left eye removed.c) Tongue cut out.d) 18-inch slit through hide parallel along ribs where heart would be.e) Rectum cored out.f) Udder still there.This was the first mutilation for the Monks, but the Englerts said that two yearsago in 1978, another of their neighbors had a cow found dead in the same pondfloating in the water. That one was an older cow.Jerry Monks said that in 1979, Ben Randolph of Limon also had a mutilation.June 26 - Ramah, Colorado on John Eurich ranch: Was this mutilation thesame night as the Monks' cow? The Eurichs found a 5-year-old Angus cow lyingdown with her feet and legs curled up under her as if she had gone to sleep inthe middle of the pasture road and leaning to her right side.Mrs. Englert: \"Predators don't eat parts like this.\"a) Rectum cored out.b) End part of tongue was cut off about 2 inches.c) Left eye removed.d) Predators did not touch the mutilated cow.Eurich had a previous cow mutilated in 1979; he also had heard about fourmutilations in 1980 in the surrounding area.Others in late June 1980:a) Lander, Wyoming: Gregg Bean, reporter for Wyoming Casper Star Tribunecalled me about mutilation found north of Rawlins, Wyoming, southwest ofCasper near Lander. Investigated by Jeffrey County Sheriff. Heifer found nearstock pond with udder surgically removed, Bean thinks, but Sheriff said it waspredator.b) Chama, New Mexico: NM State Patrol officer Gabe Valdez reported thatthree cows were mutilated near Chama. Udder, rectum, tongue removed. Therewere skid marks on the ground, Gabe thought, that might mean the animal wasdropped from air. The three cows were buried, no necropsies. July 1980July 16 - South Park, Colorado: Steve Zachary is a hiking guide and on July16, 1980, he was taking people into East Lost Park over Canosha Pass down intoSouth Park within a mile of a U. S. Forest Service trail that goes into acampground and meadow along Lost Creek. That general area is used a lot bycattle. The group started on trail across the creek from the campground and hadgone about two miles into the meadow when they saw a marmot (large ground"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"squirrel) lying out on a rock. The marmot was spread eagle on its stomach withall four legs stretched out straight.Yellow-bellied marmot in YosemiteNational Park, California. Image source Wikipedia.\"Real strange,\" said Zachary. \"What was so strange was no blood around. Themarmot was sprawled out on its stomach with all four legs sticking straight outfrom the body.\"They could not see anything wrong with it from above, but knew it was dead.So, Zachary got a stick and turned the marmot over. Near the arm pit on theheart side was a hole the size of a quarter, almost perfectly smooth and flatshowing some bone. There was no blood around the wound or on the rock. \"Itwas like someone took something like a cookie cutter and took out a roundsection of the marmot,\" said Zachary.There were other marmots around that did not approach the dead marmot.\"Sometimes, Zachary said, \"rodents will gnaw on their own kind. What's weirdis how the wound was just about a perfect circle!\"the animal was a youngmarmot, Zachary guessed, but sex unknown. There were flies around, but nomaggots or ants. No one had a camera to take photos, and no samples weretaken for lab analysis.July 28 - Tierra Amarilla, New Mexico on the Salazar Ranch: A 5-year-oldHereford cow was found:a) Tail removed 4 inches from base of spine leaving a short tailstub.b) 2 teats removed from udder.c) Tongue cut out.d) Blood on ground and around excisions, and blood still in veinsand arteries in the body. Gabe said this was the most blood he hadseen on a mutilation. Someone in government or military copy catversion to muddy the waters of the extraterrestrial intrusion intopastures?e) Found within 100 feet of mutilation site that Valdez visited onJuly 18, 1978, where four cows were found within a yard of eachother with \"identical burns\" on backs and chests and legs. Thatsame night of July 18, some witnesses watched four strange aircraft.The aircraft were triangle-shaped, glowing whitish-blue andemitting all types of colored lights. The craft darted around the tailof an airliner at 2 AM on a flight Gabe figured was fromAlbuquerque to Utah.f) Valdez claims there were marks on leg from clamps. Said hestripped leg skin and found bruises on muscles underneath.g) Unidentified, orange-colored lights in the sky were seen at nightaround the time of the Tierra Amarilla mutilation.Other July 1980: Pine Ridge, South Dakota Bureau of Indian Affairs - receivedphone call that eyewitness there had been watching lights nightly, reminding himof a train with lighted windows - a candle-yellow color with varying brightness."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"As many as four lights at a time. During two nights, he saw a strobe light effectthat were shoots of little flashes of pinpoint lines of light, like lasers. They fly instraight path, then turn, slow down, flash light above and below. Sometimespeople see red, green and white lights that have been mistaken for police cars.There has also been a cattle mutilation, an animal that was taken to the vet there:a) No blood, confirmed by vet.b) Ear cut off, straight cut through hide.c) Rectum cored out in 3-inch by 3-inch hole.d) Ring on cheek 2-inches in diameter, brownish color as ifscorched by something hot.In 1977 to 1978 at Scenic, South Dakota, people heard a high-pitched sirensound. On April 14, 1979, near Kadoka, mutilation associated with appearanceof unidentified red lights in the sky. March 1980, north of Manderson, SouthDakota, yearling heifer mutilated. At Porcupine Butte, a Big Foot creature wassighted. And at Slim Butte, a rancher reported seeing \"kangaroo-type\" animalshopping across their land. August 1980August 8 - Carpenter, Wyoming, on the Leo Smith ranch: Mr. Smith found5-month-old male calf right along Muddy Creek about 50 feet from the water.Estimated it was dead a week. There were other cows in the pasture, which isfairly close, about 1/2 mile, from Interstate 80. The calf was discovered by aneighbor girl riding her horse through the pasture's very tall grass. Smith saidthe carcass was so full of maggots he could not tell what had been done to itexcept that both ears were cut off at the scalp leaving \"silver dollar-sized circles\"cut in the hide. This is the only mutilated animal Leo Smith has ever had in hisranching experience.This calf also had an ear tag punched in one ear and Smith found both pieces ofthe tag on the ground. Smith said it was clear that the tag had been cut bysomething sharp and that there were \"pin pointed holes stuck in each side of thetag pieces where it was cut in two.\" Dale Burt, Sheriff at Pine, Wyoming, wentto the site and said the ears had definitely been cut off with a sharp instrument.Leo's brother told him when he found the mutilated calf that one week before,when Leo's brother was in bed in a pasture trailer, he watched red lights flashingon a white wall in his bedroom. But he was too scared to get up and see what itwas. Leo did check with the deputy sheriff to see if he had been out then forsome reason and the answer was that no one in a sheriff's car had been out toLeo's ranch. Leo's brother didn't hear any noise. What was the red flashing lighton the wall? August 11 - East of Denver, Colorado: On Monday morning, August 11,1980, a woman called the Tony Larson radio talk show in Denver to report thataround 4 AM, she spotted a craft with white, triangle-shaped windows, movingslowly above Fitzsimmon's Hospital east of Denver.That same morning, a woman in Fort Lupton, Colorado, reported seeing a UFOin the sky above a trailer camp. The woman said that for about ten nights up toMonday, August 11, 1980, her little Pomeranian dog acted strangely. He hadalways been afraid of the night and wanted inside. Suddenly, he startedscratching and whining to get out at night and they thought he was sick and lethim out. When the dog did not come back, they started looking for him.After they found him and brought the dog back to the trailer, the Pomeranianand other dogs in the neighborhood were barking at the same time in the earlymorning. But Monday, August 11, was the first night in two weeks that thePomeranian did not bark.Earlier on Sunday, August 3, the same woman had a sick stomach and got up inthe night to drink some milk. From her kitchen window, she could see a \"largestar, bright white light\" that stayed pretty much in the same place low in the skyfor an hour. \"Looked like landing lights on an airplane, but the bright lightremained in the same place.\" She did not hear any noise.Finally, her husband got up to see why she had not come back to bed andlooked out the window with her at the strange light. Then the bright light beganto move and she got binoculars. The only thing she could see were white,triangle-shaped windows with dark in between in a pattern like this:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"AA AAA AAAA AAA AAThe woman thought at first it might be the window screen that caused thetriangle shapes, so she opened the kitchen window to look with the binocularsand the patterns of triangles were still there.Then the light moved away quicklyupward until it looked like a star in the sky. That's when the couple returned tobed. \"For some reason, I was scared and did not want to go outside the wholetime that light as there.\" Also, the dogs were barking and restless.I called J. Allen Hynek and asked if he had ever had a case of triangle-shapedwindows in an unidentified aerial craft. Dr. Hynek told me that over Coldwater,Michigan, in either September of October 1979, triangle-shaped windows weredescribed on a slowly moving craft, something like a floating dirigible.Dr. Hynek said there had also been a report in the eastern part of Indianapolis,Indiana, in 1979. The craft was described as octagon-shaped (8-sided) withround and triangle-shaped windows. The object moved with the sound of a largejet overhead. People came out of their houses and saw 18 flood lights beam outfrom the 8-sided craft. What was THAT?
