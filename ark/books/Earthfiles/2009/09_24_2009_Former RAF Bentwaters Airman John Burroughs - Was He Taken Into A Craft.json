He was knocked down andsomething held him to the ground.” - Former USAF Airman John Burroughs Click for Earthfiles Podcast. John Burroughs, age 49, in Tempe, Arizona,on October 4, 2008. Image © 2008 by Linda Moulton Howe. September 24, 2009 Phoenix, Arizona - John Burroughs was born in Bloomington,Illinois in 1960, and joined the U. S. Air Force right after high school graduation. Hereceived orders to go to RAF Bentwaters, England, and arrived in July 1979, abouteighteen months before the highly strange encounters with lights, beams and craft in theRendlesham Forest between RAF Bentwaters and nearby RAF Woodbridge the end ofDecember 1980. During that time, John worked as an Air Force police officer and saysnothing strange ever happened until after midnight on December 26, 1980.Earlier, John had Christmas dinner with his landlord in Ipswich where he rented a room ina house and reported for his normal police duty at 11 PM. A little before 3 AM, he and hisboss, Staff Sgt. Bud Steffens, arrived at the East Gate together and noticed blue, red,orange and white lights glowing in Rendlesham Forest that John had never seen before.Steffens and Burroughs drove out the East Gate as far as the road would go to the trees,felt static electricity in the air and returned to the East Gate to call the law enforcementdesk about something strange in the woods outside the base.Then, Staff Sergeant James Penniston, the base security supervisor, got a call to go to theEast Gate and brought along a new airman, Edward Cabansag. Sgt. Penniston called the81st Police Squadron Shift Commander, Lt. Fred “Skip” Buran, and asked for an EasternRadar check. Lt. Buran told Sgt. Penniston there was an object over the base and that“something had disappeared off radar.” That convinced Shift Commander Lt. Buran togive Sgt. Penniston permission to go off base to investigate. Sgt. Penniston asked Sgt.Steffens to go with him into the woods, but Steffens did not want to leave base property.So, John Burroughs volunteered to join Sgt. Penniston and Airman Cabansag. The three"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"men traveled in a pickup truck from the East Gate toward the unusual, colorful lights inthe forest.Jim Penniston remembers approaching the lights, seeing a solid black, glassy, triangle-shaped craft on the forest floor resting on tripod legs. He photographed the craft, he drewsketches of it in his notebook and copied the odd symbols scratched into the black, glassysurface. He walked off the size at 9 feet by 6.5 feet. But John Burroughs, who was therewith Penniston, does not remember any of that. Later, Jim Penniston realized that hisnotebook's time line had 45 minutes of missing time. Further, Airman Richard Bertolino onBunker Hill was listening to Sgt. Penniston's radio transmissions until Security Controlcalled for radio silence about an hour after Sgt. Penniston and the other men went into theforest. John Burroughs recently talked with Lt. Fred Buran who said radio silence wasrequested because Security Control lost all radio contact with Sgt. Penniston for about 45minutes.Right from the beginning, the men saw what they could not explain and somethinghappened to the minds of those eyewitnesses - either in the forest, in militaryinterrogations later on, or both. The results have been blank or confused memories. Eventwo men, Sgt. James Penniston and Airman John Burroughs, who were next to each otherin Rendlesham Forest between RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge, do not rememberthe same details.Interview:Former USAF Airman John Burroughs was a military policeman at RAF Bentwaters,Suffolk County, England, in 1980, and was in Rendlesham Forest two nights onDecember 26 and 28, 1980, when lights, beams and a craft were encountered: “Thehardest part for me is that I remember certain things. I know what I remember and I knowwhat my statement says. I know that what I drew (in report) is what we came close to.That part I definitely remember.John Burroughs sketch of lights he saw on the first night of December 26, 1980.Date of his above sketch was January 2, 1981.[ John Burroughs notes on January 2, 1981, sketch of lights: “This wouldmove back and forth, up and down, but the blue and white and orange wouldcome out when it was sitting in one place. Blue lights would come out of thebeam and the white light below. Blue lights would blink on and off inside thebeam, plus the beam would be red and orange. A white light would come outbelow the beam in the trees. ( AIC John Burroughs 81SPS SPOL CFLT”)] The stories over the years coming out saying I jumped on something or I was drawn intosomething could have been the night with Penniston; it could have been the third nightwhen I was out there with Col. Halt. How much missing time? I do believe there was somekind of distortion in time. And it was very interesting under hypnosis to confirm somethingdid happen to me and I had some kind of interaction with whatever was out there.WE'RE STILL TRYING TO GET FURTHER BREAKTHROUGH TO SEE IF YOU CAN"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"REMEMBER MORE DETAILS.Yes. The hardest problem I have is that I spent 26 years in the U. S. Air Force and whathappened over those three nights - we did not follow proper procedures and protocol.Things that went on do not add up. Things that went on afterwards do not add up. We werein the largest tactical fighting wing in the U. S. Air Force. We were a front line NATO basethat if war broke out, our aircraft would proceed over to Germany and they would bring inother aircraft for another mission. We had some officers that all went on to some verydistinguished careers in space command and all of them were sitting there trying to tell usthat, ‘Well, we really didn't have anything to do with it. Something did happen and youwere good men doing your job, but we can't really comment on it.’JIM PENNISTON MADE THE COMMENT THAT IT APPEARED THAT THE BASECOMMANDER THEN, COL. TED CONRAD, MUST HAVE HAD A LOT MOREINFORMATION THAN HE EVER SHARED WITH YOU AND JIM PENNISTONWHEN BOTH OF YOU WERE ASKED TO SEE, FIRST, LT. FRED BURAN, THE [RAFBENTWATERS 81ST POLICE SQUADRON SHIFT COMMANDER]. THAT WENT INA KIND OF PERFUNCTORY WAY. AND THEN A COUPLE OF DAYS LATER, ORMAYBE BY DECEMBER 29, 1980, YOU WERE ASKED TO GO AND TALK TO COL.CHARLES HALT. HE ASKED BOTH OF YOU A LOT OF QUESTIONS, BUT THENYOU WALKED ACROSS THE HALL TO THE BASE COMMANDER'S OFFICE, COL.CONRAD. HE ASKED YOU AND JIM TO SIT DOWN AND TELL HIM WHAT YOUHAD SEEN AND HE NEVER ASKED YOU A SINGLE QUESTION.Right. Something did happen off base. We were out there for three different nights.Something did happen around the Weapons Storage Area. I do know the radio traffic wasrecorded through the command post that night, and I believe to this day that CaptainVerano came forward and said a tape was sent over to Germany and I believe that was theactual tape of the radio traffic that night. If that tape was ever to be released - and I stillbelieve it's out there - that would blow this case completely wide open.THE VERY FACT THAT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE TOWERS AND BEINGRECORDED HAS NEVER BEEN RELEASED - THAT'S A COVER-UP.Right, because the tape did not get destroyed. What took place off base and what tookplace in the area of the Weapons Storage Area - that tape was listened to. I've also beentold that the NSA (National Security Agency) has files on the incident and they havedifferent document there, so my best bet is that the tape is sitting at the National SecurityAgency. The fact that it would confirm a lot of what's been said and it would clearly showthat there was some kind of strange phenomena going on over the base. Col. Halt's tapeshowed that something very strange happened.THOSE AUDIOTAPES THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE BY PEOPLE WHO WEREIN CONTROL TOWERS WOULD BE EXTREMELY VALUABLE AS THE RUNNINGTIME LINE OF EVENTS AS THEY HAPPENED THOSE THREE NIGHTTS.FURTHER, IT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY COL. HALT TOLD PETER ROBBINS WHENHE WAS WORKING ON THE BOOK, 'LEFT AT EAST GATE,' IN THE MID 1990STHAT HE KNEW FOR A FACT THAT A BEAM HAD COME DOWN INTO THE RAFBENTWATERS WEAPONS STORAGE AREA AND HAD GONE THROUGH SOIL,METAL AND CEMENT AND INTERACTED WITH NUCLEAR WARHEADS. C-5 Flew to RAF Bentwaters on December 28, 1980,and Parked Near Weapons Storage AreaI do know that a C-5 came in Sunday night (December 28, 1980). It involved the WeaponsStorage Area.

Image by RAF Bentwaters History.JOHN, YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT DATES?Christmas was Thursday, December 25th and the plane came in on Sunday night(December 28, 1980). I do know that on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday (December 29, 30and December 31, 1980), I was posted on the East Gate. I do know there was activity inthe woods all three days. I did see a chopper lift something out of the woods and bring itover to the RAF Woodbridge flight line over by the 67th ARS, which was para rescue onTuesday night (December 30, 1980). So, I do know there was stuff going on afterwardsand there were people in the woods.I was posted on the East Gate and I was told that because I was involved in the incidentsand saw strange things that that is why they put me there and if I saw anything strangehappening in the woods, not to call it on the radio. They were well aware there wasactivity going on in the woods.THEY MEANT, DON'T GO THROUGH RADIO TRAFFIC, CALL US ON A PHONELINE?Ye s .THEY WANTED TO KEEP A LOW PROFILE IF ANYTHING MORE HAPPENED INTHE WOODS.Right, or anything that I saw going on.CONTROL OF THE PHENOMENA WAS ALREADY STARTING TO KICK IN,WHETHER YOU KNEW WHAT WAS HAPPENING AT HIGHER LEVELS OFAUTHORITY OR NOT. YOU ARE ALREADY BEING TOLD, ‘DO NOT CALL ONTHE RADIO. CALL ON THE PHONE.’Yes, that's what I was told. To me, we weren't taken care of. I mean, we were out doingour job. General Williams said that - that we 'were good men doing our jobs.' We were nottaken care of. We all should have been checked out because we had something strangehappen to us. So, medically we should have been brought in and checked out. We shouldhave been debriefed on everything that happened to us. People have said they have beeninterrogated, which I don't understand why guys doing their job would be interrogated.That just doesn't make any sense to me.THE FACT THAT STAFF SERGEANT JAMES PENNISTON WAS ASKED TO DOSODIUM PENTOTHAL HYPNOSIS AND THAT IT LASTED FOR THREE AND AHALF HOURS.And that's totally wrong.

He was knocked downand something held him to the ground.” - John BurroughsCAN YOU DESCRIBE HOW YOU GOT BACK INTO RENDLESHAM FOREST ANDWHAT WAS YOUR INTERACTION WITH COL. HALT?We saw something like lights, really bright and white that came down and started hoveringout in the distance in the Rendlesham Forest. Col. Halt asked me if that was what we sawthe first night. I told him I wasn't sure and I asked him if I could move forward to get abetter view of it and he cleared me to go forward with Bustinza [ Sgt. Adrian Bustinza].Bustinza had a radio and he and I went towards the object.THIS IS SGT. ADRIAN BUSTINZA. VERBAL CLEARANCE WAS GIVEN BY THEDEPUTY BASE COMMANDER, COL. HALT, FOR YOU TO GO FORWARDTOWARDS THE NOW REDDISH-ORANGE LIGHT IN THE SKY WITH ADRIANBUSTINZA. WHAT HAPPENS?We're in contact with the WSA (Weapons Storage Area) tower. Adrian and I were runningtowards the object. Adrian went down to the ground and I got closer to it and the nextthing I know - I don't know how long it was afterwards - I'm standing in the field rightwhere I got close to whatever it was and it's gone and I'm just standing there with Adrianbehind me.WHAT DO YOU SAY TO EACH OTHER?Well, I went back towards Adrian and he told me that whatever the light was came overthe top of me. [Third night on December 28, 1980]DID ADRIAN BUSSTINZA SEE YOU RISE UP INTO THIS OBJECT?He didn't tell me when we were out in the field, but when I talked to Adrian on the phonea few years later, he said that yes, the light appeared to pull me up inside. Adrian also toldme that he did not fall down. He was knocked down and something held him to theground.THIS WOULD EXPLAIN ALL OF THE RUMORS ABOUT YOU EITHER JUMPINGON THE CRAFT OR BEING TAKEN UP IN A BEAM OF LIGHT INTO THE CRAFT.Yes, it would. I've always felt that when those rumors came out that it was not the firstnight with Jim and me. I went under hypnosis to try to figure out what happened. Did Col. Halt and Others SeeJohn Burroughs Rise Up Into Reddish-Orange Light?SOMETHING AS DRAMATIC AS ADRIAN BUSTINZA BEING ABLE TO TELL YOULATER THAT HE SAW THE REDDISH-ORANGE LIGHT COME OVER YOU ANDTHAT YOU APPEARED TO GO UP INTO IT - COL. CHARLES HALT ANDEVERYBODY ELSE MUST HAVE KNOWN WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU ANDBUSTINZA IN THE FOREST?The Col. was behind us, so I'm not sure exactly what he saw.YOU HAVE A MEMORY LOSS, A MISSING TIME, ON THAT EARLY MORNINGHOURS EVENT WITH ADRIAN BUSTINZA ON DECEMBER 28, 1980?Yeah, there is definitely something - I mean, when I got close to whatever it was, I have noidea what happened. Also, I have spoken to the guy that was in the tower that night and hedid confirm that what I am saying is true. He remembers talking to me on the radio, heremembers me getting close to the object. He also remembers clearly that he could see theobject hovering over the woods and he said the object was there for quite awhile.ADRIAN BUSTINZA, AS FAR AS HE IS CONCERNED, WENT PRONE TO THEGROUND IN A DEFENSIVE MOVE?He said he fell to the ground. But he claims that he was pushed down. Something forcedhim to the ground and held him to the ground. He never went to the ground on his own.Something forced him to the ground."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Why Sodium Pentothal Hypnosiswith Sgt.

Halt, he clearly told me that he knows I was brought in and he knows I wasinterrogated. He knows who did it, what was involved and everything else. I don'tremember it. So, I'm not trying to say I wasn't.

There's just more to it. I can't describe whatJim and I encountered as good as Jim can. So, there are a ton of discrepancies on what wesaw and what went on. As Lord Hill-Norton said, ‘It had to be of defense significance.’Lord Hill-Norton could not understand how all this could happen, that good men weredoing their jobs, and that so little would be commented on by either government, and theway it was handled by either government.Lord Peter John Hill-Norton.February 8, 1915 - May 16, 2004.Video image © by James Fox.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Lord Peter John Hill-Norton (Feb. 8, 1915 toMay 16, 2004) was a five-star Admiral Admiral of the Fleet, was Chief of theDefence Staff of the United Kingdom and Chairman of the NATO MilitaryCommittee.
