July 17, 2009 Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England - A press release dated June 25,2009, was released on the internet and contained this startling quote by retired USAF Lt.Col. Charles I. Halt:“I wish to make it perfectly clear that the UFOs that I saw were structuredmachines moving under intelligent control and operating beyond the realm ofanything I have ever seen before or since.

A light in the skythat seemed to trigger a number of power grid failures - all the lights went out, which isoften attributed to the presence of UFOs.That incident created my interest in the UFO subject, which has stayed with me. So, forthe last 34 years, I have been very interested in the subject of UFOs so much so that by2001, I wanted to become an active researcher. But the problem was that as a policedetective, if a rape occurs, your time is not your own. You can work for hours and hoursand hardly be at home. I had to come up with something I could research, but it wouldhave to be on my own because of the hours and nature of the police job that I work.And one day, I came up with the idea of police officers. I’d read about one or two policeofficers in several books and began to speculate that police officers have probably seenmany, many strange things, but there is never an outlet or mechanism to allow them tocome forward.So, in January 2002, I created what is called the PRUFOS database, which stands forPolice Reporting UFO Sightings. I started off with half a dozen sightings by a dozen policeofficers. After seven years of research, I’ve now got 300 reports dating back to 1901,involving over 700 British police officers. So, it’s grown a helluva lot!” Example of PRUFOS Police EncounterGary Heseltine says that one of the most startling reports came from Police ConstableAlan Godfrey in 1980, who watched a diamond-shaped aerial object suspended in the airabove a road in Todmorden, West Yorkshire. Policeman Godfrey tried to turn on his policeradio to call for help, but the radio was strangely dead. Then he got out of his police car,but was blinded by a bright, white light. PC Godfrey's next conscious memory was findinghimself back in his car mysteriously moved to a different location down the road. Thewhite light was gone. Haunted by the encounter, PC Godfrey sought hypnosis. Whatemerged was his description of being on a spacecraft with small, non-human entitiesexamining his body. See: PRUFOS, Police Reporting UFO Sightings.Gary Heseltine: “As a result of that database, I've become known within the UFOcommunity and from time to time, I’ll be asked to take part in various televisiondocumentaries. And on one occasion in December 2007, the American History Channelwas making a couple of documentaries in the U. K. - one about police officer sightings - sothat’s why I was involved. And in the process of talking to their producer, I asked whatelse they were producing in England. They said they were going to make a documentaryabout Rendlesham Forest (the 1980 RAF Bentwaters encounters with lights and craft). Iasked who else was involved and they said they were flying Col. Charles Halt from the U.S. to Engla nd. Gary Heseltine Worked RAF Securityof Nuclear WeaponsMy interest in the Bentwaters UFO incident stems from the fact that during my six years inthe Royal Air Force, I served on two nuclear bases – one in the U. K. and one in what wasthen West Germany, protecting nuclear weapons and the layouts of the bases of whichBentwaters and Woodbridge were leased from the RAF with a very similar design to thebases that I had worked on in security protecting nuclear weapons.I personally had always suspected that there must have been many more witnessesinvolved who have yet to be tracked down. So I said I had a theory because I worked onnuclear weapons bases – was there any way I could visit them on the Rendleshamproduction?They said yes and I spent three days on the documentary down at Rendlesham and duringthat process spent a lot of time with Col. Charles Halt, whom I had never met before.THAT WAS WHAT YEAR AND MONTH?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"That was December 2007.SO YOU WERE THERE AT THE SAME LIGHT AND TIME OF THE ORIGINALEVENTS OF DECEMBER 26 TO 28?I think that was the idea of the American History Channel.COULD YOU JUMP TO THE MOST RECENT JUNE 2009 PRESS RELEASE FROMYOU CONCERNING A FILM YOU ARE NOW WORKING ON AND THAT YOUCOULD READ FOR ME NOW THE STATEMENT THAT YOU INCLUDE IN YOURRELEASE FROM COL. HALT?Yes, just before I do that, I want to make perfectly clear that at this moment in time a filmis not being made. What I have done, having met Col. Halt some nineteen months ago, is Iasked him during those three days of TV production had anybody ever tried to write a filmscript about Rendlesham Forest? He said, ‘No.’ I said, ‘Well, I sort of do like to write.Would you allow me to write it, research it, and collaborate with you on it?’ And he saidthere and then, ‘Yes, I’ll help you in any way I can.’So, basically what happened is that I went away for about four months and researched allthe known documentaries, books, articles that had been put out about the events atRendlesham. I created, using some of my police detective acumen, a very detailed timeline of the events from literally the first night through to the point at which he sends off theHalt memorandum to the M. O. D. (Ministry of Defence). And then I went back to Haltand began asking him question after question and that happened for perhaps the nextfifteen months until we got to a stage where the first draft script was complete and I put itto him and said, ‘Look. What do you think?’ He didn’t get that draft until December 2008(half a year ago) when he got the first draft version. He read that and said it was great, heloved it and would fully endorse what was written.And since Christmas 2008, we have been adapting it and tweaking things as you would dowith any film script. So, what we have is a film script, which is available and (would like)to meet with film producers and that was the idea of putting out the press release in June2009, to announce that there has been a collaboration between Col. Halt and myself andthat we now have a workable film script that I believe is crying out to be made into afeature film.You’ve asked me to read the quote, right? The press release that was put out the 25th ofJune and which was mutually agreed upon and which Col. Halt is very happy to go outwith. June 25, 2009 Press Releaseby Gary Heseltine and Col. Charles Halt (Ret.)Deputy Base Commander, RAF Bentwaters, U. K., December 1980Col. Halt said: “I wish to make it perfectly clear that the UFOs I saw were structuredmachines moving under intelligent control and operating beyond the realm of anything Ihave ever seen before or since.

It was called RAF Butley – about 4 miles northeast of RAFWoodbridge (larger pink circle on far left). More trees were planted to build up theRendlesham Forest in the 1940s to help shield military activities."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"To the south was the RAF Bawdsey Chain Home Radar Station (bottom pink circle onmap) that during WWII monitored the launch of V2 rockets from Germany. Althoughthere was no defense against the V2 rocket, RAF Bawdsey was able to provide the BritishBomber Command with the location of the V2 launch sites, which could then be attacked.East of Butley at Orford Ness (far right pink circle), an experimental MADRE over-the-horizon radar station was constructed in 1961 to monitor Soviet launches.The United States Air Force 81st Fighter Interceptor Wing and the 67th AerospaceRescue and Recovery Squadron (ARRS) leased the original RAF Butleyafter WWII under the new name RAF Bentwaters.After the end of World War II, RAF Butley was renamed RAF Bentwaters by Britain’sMinistry of Defence and leased to the United States Air Force for its 81st FighterInterceptor Wing and the 67th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron (ARRS)."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"By 1958, RAF Bentwaters and RAF Woodbridge became a joint U.

Charles Halt and Airman 1st Class JohnBurroughs to describe lights in the Rendlesham Forest as “alive” and “speaking” to themtelepathically on December 28, 1980?

They phoned a Sgt. McCabe to report whathad been happening and McCabe alerted the Central Security Control. That early morningof December 26, 1980, Staff Sergeant James W. Penniston was duty supervisor at RAFWoodbridge and drove to the East Gate in a truck with newly assigned Airman 1st ClassEdward Cabansag to see for himself what was happening.Sgt. Penniston asked Airman John Burroughs and Sergeant Bud Steffens if the lights couldbe from an airplane crash in the forest. Steffens replied: “It did not crash.

John Burroughswrote afterward that there was a light that rose in the air above the Rendlesham trees. “Allthree of us hit the ground and whatever it was started moving back towards the openfield.” After that, the men decided that Cabansac should stay there to relaycommunications, while Penniston and Burroughs continued walking deeper into thewoods.Burroughs and Penniston also described feeling hair on their arms and back of their necksstand up like in the electrostatic atmosphere of a thunderstorm.

Penniston's typed statementabout light encounters in early hours of December 26, 1980.Penniston Text: “When we got within a 50 meter distance (150 feet), the object wasproducing red and blue light. The blue light was steady and projecting under the object."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"It was lighting up the area directly under extending a meter or two out. At this point ofpositive identification, I relayed to CSC, SSgt Coffey. Postitive siting (sic) of object ...color of lights and that it was defidently (sic) mechaniclal (sic) in nature.” Sgt. Penniston contacted Staff Sergeant Coffey at Central Security Control and told himthat the object “was definitely mechanical in nature.”Penniston much later in time on December 16, 2002, told a U. K. interviewer: ‘I have mynotes from that night in my notebook. And it says what I wrote:Staff Sergeant James W. Penniston's sketch of triangle-shaped, dark glassy surfacedcraft he photographed and touched in early hours of December 26, 1980.Notes about sketched craft in Staff Sergeant James W. Penniston's notebook: “Triangularin shape. The top portion is producing mainly white light which encompasses most of theupper section of the craft. A small amount of white light is appearing from what appears tobe the bottom of the craft. At the left side is a bluish light. And on the other side is red.The lights seem to be molded as part of the exterior of the structure that seemed to belanded on the forest floor.”Penniston also said that the air was filled with electricity – like static. “You could feel it onyour skin as you approached the object. There was also a sense of slowness, like time itselfwas an effort. I got to within ten feet of the craft in the clearing where it sat.”Penniston estimated the craft to be three meters long at the base and two meters high, or10 feet long by 7 feet high. No landing gear was apparent, but the object seemed like itwas on fixed legs. Penniston said he walked right up to the craft and noticed the fabric ofthe shell was like a smooth, opaque, black glass. He said, “No animals were even makingnoise anymore. The nearer we got to that thing, the more uneasy I felt – it was as if I weremoving in slow motion.”John Burroughs agreed, “It was a weird feeling, like everything seemed slower than youwere actually doing.” Strangely, John Burroughs to this day does not remember seeing JimPenniston near such a craft. But Burroughs also knows his mind is blocked when he thinksabout the lights.John Burroughs also does not remember Sgt. Penniston having a camera, but Pennistonsays he took 36 photographs on 35mm film and sketched symbols that were engraved intothe craft’s shiny, black surface.Staff Sergeant James W. Penniston's sketch of 3-inch high symbols etched into the"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"dark, glassy craft's surface that he touched in early hours of December 26, 1980.Penniston has described the engraved symbols for TV programs this way: “On the smoothexterior shell, there was writing of some kind, but I couldn’t quite distinguish it. So, Imoved up to see 3-inch lettering – or rather symbols – that stretched for the length of twofeet, maybe a little more.”Then Sgt. Penniston reached out his hand. “I touched the symbols and I could feel theshapes as if they were inscribed or engraved, like a diamond cut on glass.”When Sgt. Penniston’s fingers touched the engraved symbols, he said the craft’s upperwhite light instantly grew much brighter, almost blinding. Both Penniston and JohnBurroughs fell to the ground in a defensive move.Penniston said, “ The craft moved up off the ground about three feet, still with absolutelyno sound. It started to move slowly. It took a couple of minutes for it to maneuver itselfback to a distance of about 100 to 150 feet. Then it rose up just over the trees, about 200feet high. There was a momentary pause and then literally with the blink of an eye, it wasgone. All with no sound! That still boggles my mind.”After the craft disappeared, both men felt normal again. The slow motion feeling wentaway. Then John Burroughs saw more colored lights in the forest. Burroughs andPenniston tried to go after those lights, too, but changed their minds, turned around andwent back to the truck.On their way back, Burroughs found three indentations in the forest soil where the craftmust have been resting on three tripod legs to form a triangle pattern of indentations in thesoil with each leg ten feet apart. Further, each indentation was the shape of a triangle.Sketch of the tripod indentations in Rendlesham Forest “landing site”by Vince Thurkettle in February 1981 site investigation."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"Photograph of triangle-shaped indention in the soil of Rendlesham Forest “landing site.”After returning with Airman Cabansag to the air base, Burroughs and Penniston were told“it is best to keep quiet about what you have seen.” But the two men decided to go back tothe forest to look for more physical evidence beyond the tripod indentations. They foundscorch marks on the trees and branches broken off.Jim Penniston said he made plaster casts, such as the one photographed above,of the triangle-shaped indentations in the ground discoveredin the early morning hours of December 26, 1980.Two nights later on December 28, 1980, after midnight, John Burroughs felt drawn back tothe Rendlesham Forest and encountered lights again.
