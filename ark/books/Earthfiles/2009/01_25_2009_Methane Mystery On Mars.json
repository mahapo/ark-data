The persistent size of methane quantities imply acontinually replenishing source. Is it geological? Or biological? Map createdby Alwyn Botha, www.the-planet-mars-com.January 25, 2009 Greenbelt, Maryland - Methane on Mars was first detected in 1999and 2001, and then has been measured in persistent quantities since 2003 over at least two“hot spots” in the Martian northern hemisphere shown on map above:1) east of Arabia Terra in the Nili Fossae region;"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2) and in the southeastern quadrant of Syrtis Major, an ancient Martian volcano that is745 miles across (1200 kilometer).Syrtis Major Planum, is a low-relief volcanic shieldprobably composed of dark basalt. Methane is not a stable molecule in the Martian atmosphere and would vanish over timeunless replenished by a methane-producing source. The mystery is the source since onEarth methane is the main constituent of natural gas, four atoms of hydrogen bound to acarbon atom. Biological organisms release much of Earth's methane as they digestnutrients. However, other purely geological processes, such as oxidation of iron, alsorelease methane as do active volcanoes. But since there are no known active volcanoes onMars, does the persistent methane release mean there are methane-producing organisms?If living organisms, what are they? How old are they? How deep underground are they?Over the past five years, the spectral signature of methane on Mars has been seen by theInfrared Telescope and W. M. Keck telescope, both at Mauna Kea, Hawaii; the GeminiSouth Observatory in Chile; and the Mars Express Planetary Fourier Spectrometer (FPS).In the January 15, 2009, electronic journal Science Express, lead author Michael Mumma,Ph.D., NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland; and GeronimoVillaneuva, Ph.D., Catholic University of America in Washington, D. C. who works withNASA Goddard, reported “the first definitive detection of methane in the atmosphere ofMars that indicates the planet is still alive in either a biological or geological sense.”NASA's January 19, 2009, press release quotes Dr. Michael Mumma: “Methane is quicklydestroyed in the Martian atmosphere in a variety of ways, so our discovery of substantialplumes of methane in the northern hemisphere of Mars in 2003 indicates some ongoingprocess is releasing the gas. At northern Martian mid-summer, methane is released at a ratecomparable to that of the massive hydrocarbon seep at Coal Oil Point in Santa Barbara,California.”"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Red and yellow indicate substantial plumes of methane measured by NASAin the Nili Fossae and southeastern quadrant of Syrtis Major ancient volcano inMartian northern hemisphere. 2009 graphic image by NASA.NASA's press release states that scientists don't yet know enough to say with certaintywhat the source of the Martian methane is, but provides an artist's concept of anotherhypothetical methane release beyond active volcanism and living organisms - “ice cages”of trapped ancient methane.In this illustration, subsurface water, carbon dioxide and the Martian internal heatcombine to release methane from a hypothetical underground “ice cage” ofancient trapped methane. 2009 image by Susan Twardy, NASA.NASA also stated, “If microscopic Martian life is producing the methane, it likely residesfar below the surface, where it's still warm enough for liquid water to exist. Liquid water,as well as energy sources and a supply of carbon, are necessary for all known forms of life.NASA's Mumma: “On Earth, microorganisms thrive 2 to 3 kilometers (about 1.2 to 1.9miles) beneath the Witwatersrand basin of South Africa, where natural radioactivity splitswater molecules into molecular hydrogen (H2) and oxygen. The organisms use thehydrogen for energy. It might be possible for similar organisms to survive for billions ofyears below the permafrost layer on Mars, where water is liquid, radiation supplies energy,and carbon dioxide provides carbon. Gases, like methane, accumulated in suchunderground zones might be released into the atmosphere if pores or fissures open duringthe warm seasons, connecting the deep zones to the atmosphere at crater walls orcanyons.”Carl Pilcher, Ph.D., Director of NASA's Astrobiology Institute added: “Microbes thatproduced methane from hydrogen and carbon dioxide were one of the earliest forms of lifeon Earth. If life ever existed on Mars, it's reasonable to think that its metabolism mighthave involved making methane from Martian atmospheric carbon dioxide.”NASA January 19, 2009 Press Release: “The Goddard science team usedspectrometer instruments attached to the telescopes to make the detection.Spectrometers spread light into its component colors, like a prism separateswhite light into a rainbow. The team looked for dark areas in specific placesalong the rainbow (light spectrum) where methane was absorbing sunlightreflected from the Martian surface. They found three such areas, calledabsorption lines, which together are a definitive signature of methane,according to the team. They were able to distinguish lines from Martianmethane from the methane in Earth's atmosphere because the motion of theRed Planet shifted the position of the Martian lines, much as a speedingambulance causes its siren to change pitch as it passes by."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"‘We observed and mapped multiple plumes of methane on Mars, one of whichreleased about 19,000 metric tons of methane,’ said Geronimo Villanueva,Ph.D. ‘The plumes were emitted during the warmer seasons -- spring andsummer -- perhaps because the permafrost blocking cracks and fissuresvaporized, allowing methane to seep into the Martian air. Curiously, someplumes had water vapor while others did not.’It will take future missions, like NASA's Mars Science Laboratory, to discoverthe origin of the Martian methane. One way to tell if life is the source of thegas is by measuring isotope ratios. Isotopes are heavier versions of anelement; for example, deuterium is a heavier version of hydrogen. Inmolecules that contain hydrogen, like water and methane, the rare deuteriumoccasionally replaces a hydrogen atom. Since life prefers to use the lighterisotopes, if the methane has less deuterium than the water released with it onMars, it's a sign that life is producing the methane.”More Information:For further reports about the red planet Mars, please see Earthfiles Archive.
