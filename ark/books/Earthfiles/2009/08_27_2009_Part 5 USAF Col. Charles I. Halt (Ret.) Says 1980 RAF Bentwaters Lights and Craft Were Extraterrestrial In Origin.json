Says 1980 RAF BentwatersLights and Craft Were “Extraterrestrial In Origin”© 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe “Those lights and craft were beyond the realm of anythingwe know and were intelligently controlled. Now, I’ll say oneother thing – it’s certainly possible that whatever it is might be fromanother dimension.” - Col. Charles I. Halt, (Ret.), Dec. 1980Deputy Base Commander, RAF Bentwaters, U. K. Click for podcast.Return to Part 1August 27, 2009 Stafford County, Virginia - Over the past thirty years in England -Royal Air Force Bentwaters, Royal Air Force Woodbridge and nearby Rendlesham Foresthave been the focus of this question: What exactly did happen between at least two dozenmilitary personnel, unidentified aerial lights and a triangular craft between midnight onDecember 26th, until 5 AM on December 28th, 1980?Now Col. Charles I. Halt, the man who was then the Deputy Base Commander at RAFBentwaters, has gone on the record in a recent June 25th press release to state: “I wish to make it perfectly clear that the UFOs that I saw were structuredmachines moving under intelligent control and operating beyond the realm ofanything I have ever seen before or since. I believe the objects that I saw atclose quarter were extraterrestrial in origin and that the security services ofboth the United States and England were and have been complicit in trying tosubvert the significance of what occurred at Rendlesham by use ofwell-practiced methods of disinformation.”Col. Charles I. Halt (Ret.), former Deputy Base Commanderat RAF Bentwaters, England, December 1980, photographedin Rendlesham Forest during 2007 TV production.Col. Halt served in Vietnam and Japan before being assigned as Deputy Base Commanderat RAF Bentwaters in 1980. His boss and base commander was Col. Ted Conrad, who hadnot been on the job very long. Their boss was the Wing Commander of the 81st TacticalFighter Wing at Bentwaters/Woodbridge, Major General Gordon Edmund Williams. It isGeneral Williams who allegedly received 35mm film in two canisters on December 30,1980, from RAF Bentwaters Captain and Day Shift Commander, Mike Verrano, who toldLarry Warren and Peter Robbins, authors of Left At East Gate © 1997, “I did driveGeneral Gordon Williams to an F-16 on the Bentwaters tarmac the AM of December 30th.He had two canisters of 35mm footage with him. ...He told me directly that it was actual"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"footage of the UFOs on the ground.” Based on Earthfiles Parts 1 - 3, it is assumed this35mm “ footage” includes the 35mm still negative roll that Sgt. James Penniston says hephotographed around the triangular craft on the ground in Rendlesham Forest in the earlymorning hours of December 26, 1980.Staff Sergeant James W. Penniston's sketch of triangle-shaped, dark glassy surfacedcraft he photographed and touched in early hours of December 26, 1980.By 1984, Col. Halt was promoted to RAF Bentwaters Base Commander and later alsoserved as Base Commander at Kunsan Air Base in Korea. Later, he was Director of theInspections Directorate for the Department of Defense Inspector General.Charles Halt was born in 1940 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and is now 69-years-old. Hereceived a B. A. in Economics and Chemistry from West Virginia Weslyan College in 1962.A year later on February 7, 1963, he enlisted in the U. S. Air Force. He was assigned to aschool for Maintenance Engineering at Chanute AFB in Illinois and became a U. S. AirForce maintenance officer for the next seventeen years. In 1975, he received an M. B. A.in Business Management from the University of Hawaii. Col. Halt retired from hisprofessional U. S. Air Force career in 1991. Today, he is the equivalent of a mayor for agated community in Stafford County, Virginia.On August 18th, I interviewed Col. Halt about his personal RAF Bentwaters experience onDecember 28, 1980, what happened to him afterward and why it has taken thirty years forhim to say on the record that the lights and craft over three nights in the Rendlesham Forestwere “extraterrestrial in origin.”Interview:Col. Charles I. Halt, (Ret.), former Deputy Base Commander, RAF Bentwaters,England in December 1980: “Let me first say that I was very naïve and very trusting – isprobably putting it mildly. And I’m very unhappy, I guess is the best way to put it, withsome of my superiors as well as the intelligence services from both U. S. and Britishsources.What I saw – now, keep in mind that definitely structured craft were seen on what wascalled the first night by three individuals: Sgt. Jim Penniston, Airman 1st Class JohnBurroughs and Airman 1st Class Edward Cabansag. What I saw [the third night, December28, 1980] moved horizontally through the Rendlesham Forest avoiding trees and bobbingup and down. By that, I mean it went vertically occasionally to avoid the trees.The craft retreated from the forest into the farmer’s field. At that time, the object wasreflecting a glowing light on the farmer’s house that was on the far side of the object. TheOrford light house was beyond that. There is no way the light from the lighthouse couldhave reflected off the farmer’s house! In fact, on the audiotape (Col. Halt ran while in theRendlesham Forest), I was very concerned about the occupants of the house because itlooked like the house was on fire internally from all the reflections on the windows."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Farmer's field in general area of central pink circle in Rendlesham Forest nearCapel St. Andrew, England. The Orford Ness lighthouse is the far right pink circle.RAF Bentwaters is top large pink circle, 4 miles northeast ofRAF Woodbridge, pink circle at Woodbridge.THIS WAS THE EARLY MORNING HOURS OF DECEMBER 28TH?I believe it was December 28, as I remember, yes. And then the object that we saw wasobviously under some type of intelligent control. There is no way it could have movedthrough the trees and done what it did and retreated into the field whenever we approachedit. Then, it silently exploded into multiple light objects – and disappeared! Narrow, White Beam Hits GroundA Few Feet from Col. Halt's TeamDURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME, DID YOU SEE A BEAM OF LIGHT THAT WASDESCRIBED AS BEING WHITE COMING DOWN FROM A GLOWING LIGHT?No, we saw that later. Let me explain. We went out of the forest into the farmer’s field. Wecrossed by the farmer’s house. We fell into a small stream and all got wet and cold andquite uncomfortable. We proceeded a little further and I was quite concerned about beingoff the base (RAF Bentwaters) at that time of night with people in uniform. Let’s face it,we (USAF) were not home. It’s (U. K.) a foreign country. We went beyond the road infront of the farmer’s house into another field. And at that time, several members of the(scout) party noticed objects in the sky that were moving in strong, straight, angularmovements and were multiple colored as far as the lights and they changed shape fromelliptical to round and elliptical. Then we noticed other objects to the south and one ofthem approached us at very high speed. My guess is that it was 3,000 to 4,000 feet, maybelower. I can’t tell for sure. And the whole time, the lighthouse was clearly visible on thehorizon.The object stopped overhead and sent down a beam. The best way I can describe it is alaser beam because the light did not radiate out like a light would do. It came straight downand fell at our feet and we were quite concerned. The light was a very bright, white light –probably 15 to 20 inches in diameter, something of that size – when it hit the ground. It wasright in front of us, less than ten or fifteen feet away."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Lt. Col. Charles I.

Is it a warning? Is it a method ofcommunication? What do we do? And we just stood there for maybe five to ten, maybefifteen seconds, and then it was gone. I mean, it disappeared as suddenly as it appeared.IT IS A BEAM OF LIGHT THAT COMES OUT OF THE LIGHT THAT IS STILL UP INTHE AIR AND WHERE IT STRIKES THE GROUND, THE BEAM LOOKS LIKE IT’S15 TO 20 INCHES IN DIAMETER?Something like that. It was so shocking – Wow! Three Radio Frequencies ReportLights Over Weapons Storage AreaAt the same time, we were picking up radio signals and continuously having problems withour radios on all three frequencies we were on from the WSA, Weapons Storage Area, andthey were indicating that they (lights) were over there. We could see objects in the sky overthere (WSA) and I later learned that there were some technicians from the communicationssquadron working in the tower, as well as the tower operator. They all observed some verystrange things as far as lights and objects.WERE YOU HEARING THE RADAR TOWER OPERATOR DESCRIBING TO YOUAND TO OTHERS SEEING THE BEAM COME DOWN INTO THE WEAPONSSTORAGE AREA?No. The tower is an observation tower. I actually called the people in the control towerthrough the command post and gave them locations to look for something in the sky. Theycalled Eastern Radar and Eastern Radar had radar surveillance and air defenseresponsibility for that WSA area. And I didn’t get a positive response, but at a later datewhen I talked to some people, they indicated that some of the tower operators had seensome things, but the audiotapes were confiscated. I don’t know. It’s all secondhandhearsay.[ Editor's Note: Page 413, Left At East Gate ©1997 by Larry Warren andPeter Robbins describes Col. Charles I.

Morning of December 29, 1980WHEN YOU STARTED THIS INTERVIEW, YOU SAID THAT YOU HAVE BEEN VERYDISMAYED BY THE COMMENTS AND SOME OF THE REACTIONS BY YOURCOLLEAGUES AND SUPERIOR OFFICERS. COULD YOU ELABORATE?Well everybody from General Gordon Williams to you name it has – I played the tape thefollowing morning for Gordon Williams and gave it to him and he believed me. Accordingto Gordon Williams, who took the tape and my recorder, he played it at the Wednesdaymorning staff meeting. They had a staff meeting every Wednesday morning. He played mytape for the staff meeting and then General Robert Bazley said to the staff, ‘What do wedo?’ And the conclusion was since nobody knew what to say, ‘It’s a Brit affair thathappened off the base.’ General Williams actually laughed when he gave me the tape back.Robert W. Bazley is a retired U. S. Air Forcefour star general who served as Commander in Chief, PacificAir Forces (CINCPACAF), from 1984 to 1986. Before then, he took command ofAir Force Inspection and Safety Center, Norton AFB, California, in May 1978.From July 1979 to June 1980, he commanded Sheppard Technical TrainingCenter, Sheppard AFB, Texas. He returned to England as Commander, 3rd Air Forceat Royal Air Force Station Mildenhall in Suffolk County, England. Bazley returnedto Ramstein Air Base, Germany, in July 1981, as Vice Commander-in-Chief of U.S.Air Forces in Europe. In 1983, he became Inspector General of the U.S.Air Force at Air Force headquarters, responsible to the Secretary of the Air Forceand the Chief of Staff for USAF inspection, safety, security, investigative,counterterrorism, counterintelligence and complaint programs. He assumed commandof Pacific Air Forces at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, in September 1984, and retiredfrom the USAF on January 1, 1987.

When I was on Larry King, you know what I told him? Heasked me, ‘When do you think this will ever become public?’ I said, ‘When one of themlands in Times Square or on the lawn of the White House and they can’t deny it.’ He and Iboth had a big laugh over it.AND WHAT I STILL WONDER IS: WHY ARE WE LIVING SUCH A LIE ON THISPLANET?I can’t answer that question.
