We would not detect them. What we are looking for are the organic compounds that might be the food that could create life, either in the past or some time in the future.” - B arry Goldstein, Phoenix Project Manager, JPL P hoenix Mars Lander footpad after landing at 4:53 p.m. Pacific, Sunday, May 25, 2008.

May 29, 2008 Pasadena, California - On Sunday, May 25, 2008, at about 4:53 p.m. Pacific time, NASA and JPL’s Mars Phoenix Lander reached the North Pole of Mars with only minor glitches. First, the sleeve on its robotic arm designed to dig into the Martian permafrost wasn’t completely off, but corrected itself later on. Then the UHF radio signal from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter satellite suddenly and mysteriously shut off. Scientists are depending on the MRO radio to communicate with the Phoenix Lander. The radio silence, fortunately, was temporary and only delayed for a day the GO! signal to slowly start the deployment of the Phoenix robotic explorer and its digging arm. In a press conference on Tuesday, May 27th, Phoenix mission officials showed a Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter photograph of the Phoenix hanging from its parachute as it drifted down about 12 miles in front of a North Pole Crater. Other photographs by the Phoenix Lander included one early on that shows a strange, vertical white “spike” on the horizon. See below in interview. If all goes well, that digging arm should make its first scoops into the Martian permafrost sometime around Wednesday, June 4th. The Phoenix mission is to dig for water ice and look for the organic building blocks of life – past or present. Who knows? A living, moving microbe might end up under the Phoenix microscope. On Wednesday evening, May 28th, as the NASA and JPL scientists in Pasadena were beginning to download new data about the Phoenix robotic arm and getting ready to put "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the robot in action, I asked Phoenix Project Manager Barry Goldstein - who has worked full time for the past five years to get the Phoenix lander to the Martian North Pole - what happened in the control room while Phoenix was descending? Interview: Barry Goldstein, Phoenix Project Manager, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California: “WHAT WERE YOU FEELING THAT LAST MINUTE? (laughs) What was I feeling? Well, I guess I was extraordinarily stressed and extraordinarily anxious. So, I think the last minute when most of the events occurred – people were just holding their breath and getting very tense. WAS YOUR HEART BEATING REALLY FAST? You know, I can’t tell you! (laughs) I can’t recall. All I can say is that it was a huge relief when we finally knew that the Phoenix vehicle had achieved certain states we are familiar with and we could verify through telemetry. What Is White Vertical “Spike” Near Horizon in Phoenix Image? IN THE VERY FIRST IMAGES, I HAD TWO QUESTIONS ON MY MIND: ONE WAS THAT IN ONE OF THE FIRST BLACK AND WHITE IMAGES FROM PHOENIX, IT’S LOOKING OUT ON THE HORIZON AND THERE IS WHAT LOOKS LIKE A WHITE VERTICAL SPIKE VERY NEAR THE HORIZON. N ASA: “The Surface Stereo Imager on NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander acquired this image at 17:15:35 local Mars solar time at the Phoenix site on the Mission's Martian day, or sol, 0 (soon after landing on May 25, 2008). The camera pointing was elevation -1.33297 degrees and azimuth 356.278 degrees. Spacecraft development is by Lockheed Martin Space Systems, Denver, Colorado.” Image source: Phoenix Mars Mission. Yes, I saw that. We all saw that. There were some jokes going around. Ed Weiler, NASA Associate Administrator of the Science Mission Directorate, made the joke that it was probably a polar bear since we were north of the Arctic circle. We’re going to wait until we get a much higher resolution image of what is there. It could be that it was an alignment issue or a speck from reflection on the deck. We’re not quite sure at this point. BUT IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WAS OUT THERE ON THE HORIZON? Oh, I can’t speculate on that. I’ll wait until we get a higher resolution image.

Polygonal patterns are al so seen i n Earth permafrost. Phoenix landed at 4:53 PM Pacific in the Martian North Pole region called Vastitas Borealis at 68 degrees north Latitude and 234 degrees east longitude. Image credit: NASA; JPL-Caltech; University of Arizona. Image source: Phoe nix Mars Mission. WHAT ABOUT THE POLYGON SURFACE WHERE PHOENIX LANDED? OUR EARTH IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE THOSE SAME KINDS OF POLYGONS IN ARCTIC GROUND. CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY PERMAFROST HAS THESE STRANGE POLYGON PATTERNS? What’s happening is that there is expansion and contraction of the water in the permafrost, the freeze and melt cycles of the water that’s contained within the soil. We actually selected our landing site because we knew it was very rich in water and soil combined. And over thousands and thousands of years, that water and ice contracts and expands as it melts and then freezes again. That melting and freezing cycle causes the ground there to crack in these polygonal patterns. SO THE SAME THING ON EARTH AND THE SAME THING AT THE NORTH POLE ON MARS. Yes, it appears to be so and we were fortunate that we landed in an area where we have accessibility to some of those troughs that form one of those polygonal cracks. So, we’ll be able to investigate and see what’s there. Phoenix Has A Digging Arm"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THAT’S THE QUESTION THAT EVERYBODY IS WANTING TO KNOW: WHEN WILL THE PHOENIX ROBOTIC ARM START SCOOPING INTO THE PERMAFROST ON MARS? We started the deployment process the morning of May 28. We should be getting data down to Earth the evening of May 28, that should confirm the first half of the deployment sequence. So, by the end of the day on May 29, we should have the arm free to move. We want to move slowly and carefully and understand the terrain around the lander before we move. I’m thinking that probably by mid-week next week, we should be able to touch the surface and do our first excavation. How Phoenix Will Dig and Analyze P anorama montage, color corrected, by Phoenix Mars Lander, NASA. N ASA/JPL: “Scientists leading NASA's Phoenix Mars mission from the University of Arizona in Tucson sent commands to unstow its robotic arm and take more images of its landing site early May 28, 2008. The Phoenix lander sent back new, sharp, color images from Mars May 27. Phoenix imaging scientists made a color mosaic of images taken by the lander's Surface Stereo Imager on landing day, May 25, which is about one-third complete and shows a fish-eye perspective from the camera, a view from the lander itself all the way to the horizon. Phoenix adjusts its color vision with Caltargets, calibrated color targets on disks mounted on the landing deck. Its color vision isn't quite like human color vision, but close.” PROFESSOR PETER SMITH, WHO IS THE PRINCIPAL RESEARCHER ON THIS PHOENIX MISSION, SAID THAT ‘IT IS HARD TO CONCEIVE THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ICE BENEATH THE LANDER.’ ASSUMING THERE IS ICE, COULD YOU"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"PLEASE EXPLAIN WHAT THE PROCESS WILL BE ONCE THE ROBOTIC ARM STARTS DIGGING? Sure, the arm will acquire samples of the soil at varying depths. It will excavate the soil above the permafrost and get to where there is water content within the soil (below). Then Phoenix will acquire small pieces or small ground up samples of the Mars terrain that contains water and deliver it to some of the instruments on the lander. We have a number of instruments up there – most notably, an instrument called the TEGA (Thermal Evolved Gas Analyzer). It’s kind of like an easy-bake oven, which is the analogy people have used. You put the soil sample into the TEGA and it bakes the sample. As it bakes the sample, it looks for what is inside the sample. At first, what it does is measure the transitions as it goes from solid to liquid and liquid to gas and what temperatures those transitions occur so it can tell what the minerals are and the volatiles are in the soil. Then, as it goes into the gas phase, the gases are run through the TEGA into a mass spectrometer that is an extremely accurate and delicate ‘nose,’ which can tell us exactly what the elements are. So, it is this instrument that can look for organics. That discovery would be the Holy Grail of our mission to find organic material, organic compounds, within the Martian surface because what we are looking for is the habitability of our landing site. That would be a combination of organics, which would be the food for life; water, which is the sustenance for life; and being near the surface, it has exposure to the sun, which would be the energy that makes life evolve. WHAT ABOUT FINDING MICROBES? Well, uh, the instrumentation we have is not directly looking for microbes. Clearly, if there were a little creature walking around, we would see it. But, obviously, I don’t expect that. We’re really looking more at the elemental composition of the soils and the constituency within the soil samples that we collect. BUT IF THERE WERE SOME SORT OF BACTERIA OR MICROBE, HOW WOULD YOU SEE IT OR KNOW IT WAS THERE? We would definitely see something in our microscope. That’s one - we have a microscope in one of our instruments on the Phoenix lander deck. Also, the organic materials that bake off would be easily detected by our mass spectrometer. Living Microbes in Martian Permafrost? HOW WOULD YOU PROVE HARD SMOKING GUN EVIDENCE IF THERE WERE A LIVING MICROBE OR BACTERIA IN ONE OF THE SCOOP SAMPLES? Well, we are not looking for live microbes on this instrument suite. We would not detect it. What we are looking for are the organic compounds that could be the food that could create life, either in the past or some time in the future. So, the reality is that we do not have the ability to do life detection on this mission. NO ABILITY TO DETECT A LIVING ORGANISM? Clearly, if the organism were big enough, we would see it. But, we do not expect to see living organisms there. That’s not the goal of Phoenix. The goal of Phoenix is to look for habitable zones, to look for the building blocks for life, not to look for life itself. NOW, IN PERMAFROST ON EARTH, IT’S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE IS LOTS OF MICROBES IN PERMAFROST? That is correct. SO, IF THERE ARE POLYGONAL STRUCTURES IN THE SOIL ON MARS, YOU ALL MUST HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT THERE MIGHT BE A LIKELIHOOD THAT IF THERE’S WATER, EVEN IN AN ICE FORM, THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME KIND OF MICROBE? Well, first of all, if there were, we would be flooded with organic signatures when we ran our TEGA experiment that I discussed a few minutes ago. We’ve gone so far north that we know that there’s water there. And anywhere there is water on Earth, as you pointed out earlier even in the Antarctic permafrost – even at the bottom of volcano vents in the oceans where temperatures are very high – life is flourishing. So, water is the key and that’s why we’re going – Gosh! I can’t get used to it – we’re there! That’s why we’re there"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"(with Phoenix) where the water is on Mars and in the next few days, or over the course of the next month, I hope we’re going to make very – I started to say ‘earth shattering – but Mars shattering discoveries. YOU’RE FOLLOWING THE WATER. I BELIEVE IT’S SCHEDULED FOR THREE MONTHS OF SCOOPING SOILS? Yes, our mission was designed and funded to operate for 90 sols (sol = Martian day), a little longer than an Earth day. The limiting factor for us is energy. The sun is up 24.6 hours for a day on Mars where we are for the northern latitude. However, after about sol 92 or 93, the sun will start dipping below the horizon and it will spend more and more time below the horizon. As that happens, since the sun is our only source of energy, eventually we will consume more energy than we produce from our solar arrays and we will no longer have enough energy to heat our Phoenix lander and the electronics will freeze. [ Editor's Note: Martian temperatures can drop to - 184 degrees Fahrenheit (-120 Celsius). ] How Have Rovers Spirit and Opportunity Survived So Long? EVEN THOUGH SPIRIT AND OPPORTUNITY ROVERS HAVE BEEN AT THE MARTIAN EQUATOR AND IT’S WARMER, THERE STILL ARE EXTREMES OF TEMPERATURES AND ALL THE DUST STORMS. HOW HAVE THEY MANAGED TO SURVIVE AND KEEP GOING FOR SO LONG? Well, you hit upon the very concern we had when we designed those vehicles some years ago. What we thought was the limiting factor for Spirit and Opportunity was the dust build-up on the solar arrays. What we couldn’t count on and didn’t count on was the periodic dust devils and winds that blows the dust off the solar arrays. Every time that happens, the sun’s rays on the solar panels produces more and more power. So the rovers have been replenished. The reason those vehicles can operate so long is that being at the Martian equator – while it does get cold and hot and cold and hot – relatively speaking. On Mars, hot is -10 degrees Celsius (+14 degrees Fahrenheit). But the sun is always up at least some period of the time. Being equatorial, it’s up almost 50% of the day no matter where Mars is in its orbit around the sun. So, the rovers can always re-charge their batteries and it’s the batteries that we use on both rovers and also on Phoenix to keep the heat inside the electronics boxes so the vehicle can survive those very cold evenings. When the sun dips below the horizon on Phoenix, however, it’s gone for a very long time (three months) and eventually the batteries wear out. For the rovers, it’s only one Martian evening that the sun is down. When it comes up again, the batteries are re-charged. Phoenix Has Only 3-Month Life Expectancy IN THAT VERY COLD TEMPERATURE, WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE PHOENIX LANDER? My expectation is that the hardware will freeze, several of the components will crack. That’s my expectation. However, when the sun comes back up, and we get more energy out of the solar arrays, it could come back to life again. I sincerely doubt that, however. And frankly, I would be shocked. I can’t fathom the electronics surviving those temperature extremes. THAT’S WHY YOU ARE PLANNING TO GET ALL THE WORK DONE WITH THE SCOOP ARM IN THESE THREE MONTHS NOW OF MAY TO JUNE, JUNE TO JULY AND JULY TO AUGUST. That’s correct. I WOULD IMAGINE THAT MAKES YOU SAD THAT THIS PHOENIX CRAFT ONLY HAS A 3-MONTHS LIFE EXPECTANCY? Oh, sure! But, I fully expect to make history relative to some of the discoveries that we"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"make before hand. So, I believe it’s well worth it. ARE YOU EXPECTING SOME 3-INCH-HIGH HEADLINES IN THE NEW YORK TIMES ? That would be nice! (laughs) I can’t expect it, but I’d sure like it.” More Information: For further information about Mars, please see the Earthfiles Archive reports listed below: • 12/16/2005 — MARSIS Radar Looking Below Surface of Mars • 07/30/2005 — Astronomers Report 10th Planet Far Beyond Pluto • 02/26/2005 — Mars Spirit Rover Discovered Boundary Between Gusev Lava and Older, Water-Soaked Rocks in \"Columbia Hills\" • 12/17/2004 — Is Our Solar System's Red, Mysterious Sedna An Alien Planetoid? • 07/22/2004 — Is Physicist Vittorio Formisano's Mars Data Being Suppressed by ESA? • 02/23/2004 — Is There Liquid Water on Martian Surface? • 02/10/2004 — Part 1 - Opportunity Investigating Bedrock and Spirit's Headed for Bonneville Crater • 01/31/2004 — Opportunity Rolls Onto Martian Soil and Confirms Hematite • 01/31/2004 — Is There Living Green Algae in the Gusev Crater on Mars? • 01/28/2004 — Mars - First Bedrock Seen Beyond Earth • 01/25/2004 — Opportunity Lands on Mars - in \"Muddy\" Hematite? • 01/24/2004 — Updated - Spirit Alive, But in \"Critical\" Condition.
