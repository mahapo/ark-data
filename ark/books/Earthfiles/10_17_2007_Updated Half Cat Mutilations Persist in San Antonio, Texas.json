Update on October 17, 2007 San Antonio, Texas - KENS 5 Eyewitness News reported yesterday that three more cats have been found mutilated. One was found on Thursday, October 11, off Encino River near U. S. 281. Two more were found on Monday, October 15, at two different sites: near Interstate 10 and Wurzbach Road; and Huebner Road and Loop 1604. One of these cats was a 5-month-old kitten named Dylan that had been rescued by Ashley Fuller. She found one-half of him on Monday. If anyone has further information about the series of half-cat mutilations that have periodically erupted in San Antonio since 2005, please contact Animal Care Services: Phone: (210) 207-6650 Fax: (210) 737-6995 210 Tuleta Drive San Antonio, TX 78212-3177 ( Brackenridge Park , across the street from the San Antonio Zoo) October 12, 2007 San Antonio, Texas - KSAT 12 (ABC-TV) reported today that \"a cat was found mutilated in half Thursday night (October 11, 2007) on the city's far North Side. A resident in the 2800 block of Encino River found the front half of a cat lying in the back yard of her home.\" A neighbor, Tracey Green, said it looked like the cat had been \"cut with a hatchet\" in two and very little blood was found. It's thought that the cat belonged to one of the nearby homeowners, but no owner has been confirmed to date. However, police were called to investigate. Tonight I received this email from another San Antonio resident: "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"“I just called Animal Friends Humane Society here in San Antonio (210-509-3647) to see if they could take in a kitten I had rescued, and a woman there, with whom I spoke, told me that she couldn't talk since she was getting ready for the news media to interview her regarding the mutilated cat found this morning, and that it was indeed her friend, Tracy, a neighbor of the owner's of the cat, who found this unfortunate animal. By the way, they don't think it was kids either.” Two Years Ago in October 2005 - Other Half Cats in San Antono, Texas, and Los Angeles, California “W hat struck me odd about this particular cat was that it had been cut in half and it looked like i t had been gutted. It just did not seem possible that a predator animal could do that.” - R obert Casell, San Antonio resident and former Los Angeles policeman H alf cat discovered October 17, 2005, San Antonio, Texas. Image provided to Earthfiles by resident, Robert Casell. Back in October 1999 in Fort Worth, Texas, five mutilated cats were discovered. The strange deaths included half cats, a cat that had been skinned, and another that had its tail sliced in two halves down its length. Also in October 1999, bloodlessly decapitated and half cats were found in San Jose, California; London, England; and Toronto, Canada. Other 1999 cases involved excisions of paws and/or back leg from cats in Tucson, Arizona occurred in March and June. Texas was also hit by the cat mutilators in March 2001, when at least a dozen cats were found cut in half behind their front legs in the northwestern residential area of Austin, Texas. The internal organs and spine sections were cleanly severed, but there was very little if any blood at the scene and no signs of struggle, leading investigators to speculate that the cats were cut up somewhere else and then returned to their home vicinity. The Austin Police Department and the Travis County Sheriff's Office investigated and a large monetary reward was offered for any information about the perpetrators. But there were no arrests and law enforcement officials were baffled."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"H alf-cat photographed by Plano, Texas Police Officer for Incident Report No. 91-44994, August 31, 1991. Another hot spot for half cat mutilations in Texas has been Plano, Texas, north of Dallas. And now another half cat has been reported in San Antonio, Texas, by resident Robert Casell, a customer care representative for Malin Integrated Handling Solutions and Design (forklift manufacturer). Mr. Casell also worked as a policeman in Los Angeles before moving to San Antonio where he and his family have lived for nine years in a well-established neighborhood. Nothing dramatic had ever happened around the Casell residence until the early morning of Monday, October 17, 2005. 2005 Interview: Robert Casell, Customer Care Rep., Malin Integrated Handling Solutions and Design and former Los Angeles policeman, San Antonio, Texas: \"I had a prior commitment to attend some church services early Monday morning (October 17, 2005), and when I came home around 7:30 a.m., I noticed something in my front yard. It did not strike me that I had seen it earlier, even though it was darker. So I went over and looked at it. Immediately I was puzzled because I saw half of a cat. I was going to take my children to school in the neighborhood about a mile away and did not want them to see it. In the middle of the day, I decided I would look into the half cat further and got my camera and took a few pictures. But I really wanted to get rid of it because I did not want my children to see it later in the day. It kind of startled me because our neighborhood is pretty quiet. We have an occasional dog that gets loose, but none of the dogs that do that are very large. So, my initial thought was, 'What kind of crazy person would do this?' I took the pictures and decided I was going to e-mail the police department, which I did but got no response. I thought I would, but I did not. R obert Casell took photographs from different angles and turned cat to see that all the organs had been removed inside upper half of cat. 2005 images provided to Earthfiles by Robert Casell."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"What struck me odd about this particular cat was that it had been cut in half and it looked like it had been gutted. It just did not seem possible that a predator animal could do that. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that if I was a predator animal, I'm not going to go to that much length to try to kill the animals if I'm doing it for sport or a meal. WAS THERE ANY PRESENCE OF BITE OR CLAW MARKS? I did not see any on the front end of the cat that remained there. It did not look like the cat had gone through any trauma other than obviously the cutting in half, which struck me as odd. These are just cats that hang around in the neighborhood. We have quite a few of them. But it did not look like this cat had gotten into a fight. If you see a stray that's been around for awhile, you'll see a missing part of an ear or you'll see other marks on the cat. This looked like a house cat, but it didn't look familiar to me. WERE YOU FAMILIAR WITH THE HALF CAT CONCEPT FROM ANY OF MY INVESTIGATIVE WORK? No, but it struck me as so odd and that's why I eventually went on the internet to see what I could learn and saw that you and Earthfiles had done a lot of reporting about cats like that. At first I thought it had to be a predator animal, but then I thought it might be a Satanic cult cutting cats in half and taking out the organs. But it struck me as so odd. WHERE IS THE BLOOD AND WHERE IS THE EVIDENCE OF STRUGGLE? Right. I wondered where the other half was and I walked around my yard and my neighbors , but I did not find the other half to it. THAT MUST HAVE BEEN PECULIAR? Yes, it was. Usually you would think you could find something nearby. Our neighborhood has been around for 25 years and it's not like we're in a newer subdivision encroaching upon wooded areas, I would think of predators like coyotes or wolves. But that's not the case in this area. YOU DON'T HAVE COYOTES AND WOLVES RUNNING AROUND IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD. Not in this neighborhood. I haven't seen any. When I took those pictures and I kind of enlarged them using a zoom feature, I noticed that the cutting on the bone it didn't look like it was pulled. It did look like it was cut, but with what I have no idea. It looked like it had to be done with a very sharp blade. There was a little dried, congealed blood around the cut area, but none on the grass. WHY DO YOU THINK THE POLICE DID NOT COME? I just e-mailed the police department. This is not something that's a high priority for the police. We live in a big metropolitan city in San Antonio. And I was an ex-police officer in Los Angeles and I kind of know what priorities are for the police department. It's not really a high priority. My main concern is that I'm going to report it in an e-mail and if there are some other people who had made some reports, maybe there is something to it. DID YOU THINK ABOUT ANIMAL CONTROL? Yes, but it was easy enough for me to pick up with a trash bag and throw it away, rather than have them get involved. Quite frankly, it's not like they are going to investigate any criminal activity that I'm aware of. UNLE SS THE Y HAVE A LOT OF CASES?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Exactly.\" October 30, 2005 - KABC-TV Los Angeles \" Cats Found Mutilated LOS ANGELES - Some cats were found mutilated recently in a neighborhood near West Hollywood, and an animal-care organization said it is offering a $1,000 reward for information leading to a suspect. \"My two cats now are locked inside, where they've never had to be locked inside before,\" neighborhood resident Ted Frost said in a broadcast report. \"They don't understand what's going on. We feel as if we're under siege.\" The remains of the cats, of various breeds, were discovered on properties in the neighborhood south of Santa Monica Boulevard and west of Crescent Heights Boulevard in the last couple weeks. The owner of one of the cats, Barbara Fix, said: There's a side of me that wishes the same thing would happen to that person. The $1,000 reward was offered by the group Bureau for Humane Law Enforcement, a private, nonprofit group based in Hawthorne that has legal authority to make arrests. Frost said a friend discovered a mutilated cat at 744 N. Croft Ave. and asked for his help. He said he contacted the animal-care group after the Hollywood Division of the Los Angeles Police Department referred the matter to the city sanitation division. 'The girl had wrapped it up. It just didn't look right to me. We needed a police officer, but I was told that police don't do that. They gave me the sanitation division to come and pick up the remains,' Frost said. Frost said one of the authorities he first talked to indicated the cat had probably been mutilated by coyotes. He then contacted the nonprofit agency. 'They responded on the spot. They came out, took the cat and had it autopsied,' Frost said. He said the group reported that several other cats had recently been mutilated by someone using a machete. \" More Information: I f viewers have more information about cat, dog or other mutilated animals in your region, please email me at earthfiles@earthfiles.com .
