Photograph © 2002 by Bill Hamilton. April 26, 2004 Los Angeles, California - Dan Burisch is a microbiologist who received his Ph.D. from the State University of New York, Stonybrook, in 1989. He is 40 years old now, born on February 2, 1964. His birth certificate name was Danny Benjamin Crain. I have met and talked with his mother, Dodie Crain, and with Dan Burisch, Ph.D., himself. In 1990, he married Deborah Kay Burisch who had a child from a previous marriage. Five years later in 1995, Dan legally changed his last name from Crain to Burisch to match the child's legal last name. In 1989, as Dan Crain graduated from SUNY Stonybrook with a Ph.D. in Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Dan was at the same time employed by the U. S. Navy's DOD Naval Research Laboratory. His rank was Captain and his title Microbiologist IV. In 1994, he was assigned to work in an underground laboratory at S-4/Area 51, five floors under the Papoose Mountain installation at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The fifth floor is accessible only by one secure elevator. Dr. Burisch told me that in the year 1994, he suited up in the fifth floor underground laboratory like an astronaut with breathing and urination hoses. His assignment was to enter a round \"clean sphere\" filled with cold hydrogen atmosphere that housed an entity called \"extraterrestrial\" by his government superiors. According to Dr. Burisch, his boss reported to a MAJI committee, an extension of the Majestic-12 Special Studies Group organized by President Harry S. Truman in 1947. Majestic 12 included top scientific, military and business leaders asked to study the extraterrestrial phenomenon. Dr. Burisch says the being at S-4/Area 51 was called \"J-Rod.\" The name emerged when the being pointed at the \"J\" key on a computer keyboard and then at a hyphen-like or \"bar\" key. Telepathically, the being communicated that those symbols were equivalent to the number 15 in hieroglyphics, similar to Egyptian. Fifteen, the being telepathed, was an appropriate name for him because it was the number of light years from Earth to a planet important to his civilization. So, the Majestic group named him \"J-Rod.\" Dr. Burisch was told there was a serious medical problem with the J-Rod and his species and that MJ-12 wanted Dan to extract tissue from the being's arm for microscopic study. A serious peripheral neuropathy was diagnosed and Dr. Burisch said in the year 1994, he collected more than 100 tissue samples in an effort to study the J-Rod's nerve damage and to perhaps develop a treatment. Dan became upset by what he was learning and in a whistle-blowing effort, Dr. Burisch began to leak information to longtime UFO researcher and Executive Director of Skywatch International, Bill Hamilton, in the summer and fall of 2002. That year, Bill played audiotaped and videotaped interviews for me of Dr. Burisch talking about his microbiology research of the extraterrestrial being's neuropathy and a complicated threat that has come to be known as the Time Convergence Paradox. Now Dr. Burisch has been diagnosed with a heart condition in which part of his heart muscle is weak, similar to the condition that killed the TV actor, John Ritter. In April, Dan Burisch told Bill Hamilton that he has negotiated a deal with his government handlers to retire from official service to MJ-12. But he wants to keep researching the issue of "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"panspermia\" - the seeding of life on Earth that has been provoked by what the J-Rod has communicated to Dan Burisch during the tissue extraction procedures at S-4/Area 51. I talked with Bill Hamilton at the recent X-Conference in Gaithersburg, Maryland, about his evolving understanding of the extraterrestrial's communications to Dan Burisch. Interview: Bill Hamilton, Computer Programmer Analyst, University of California-Los Angeles, and Executive Director of Skywatch, Lancaster, California: \"These extractions that he took were of course painful to this entity. And he knew that and he could even feel the pain the entity was feeling because it's a vacuum extraction and these tissue extractions were sent down like a vacuum hose to a container of some kind and as far as I know, traveled down a conveyor belt to another station and perhaps someone like another biologist would be looking at these tissue samples under a microscope. And I have asked Dan: Does he believe the J-Rod is still at this particular facility? He believes that he is, but has no confirmation of that. The purpose of taking these tissue samples was to come up with a means possibly to reverse engineer the genetics of this particular entity, perhaps even by hybredizing genes together in order to remedy a peripheral neuropathy that this entity was suffering. WHICH IS SOME KIND OF DETERIORATION OF THE NERVES THAT IS CAUSING BOTH A WEAKNESS IN THE ABILITY OF THE BEING TO STAND UP AND LOSS OF BODY HEAT FROM THE ENTITY'S BODY? Yes, I believe that is so. I have studied a little about peripheral neuropathies - using the world wide web of course! - and I have found out that people who suffer from these are in great pain. It is very painful for them to have neuropathies of this kind. ON THE VIDEOTAPE, DAN SAYS HE COULD FEEL THIS BEING'S PAIN WHEN HE WOULD EXTRACT TISSUE BECAUSE THERE IS SOME KIND OF TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION? Yes. Not only telepathy in terms of what the being is thinking, but what the being is feeling is conveyed and empathy is going across here. Now, why is anybody trying to remedy this being's problem? Why are they trying to fix it? I think there was a dialogue that went on before Dan ever arrived there and they (MJ-12 and entity) had reached some kind of agreement that if we would help fixing the problem and what was needed was samples from present-day human genomes that's why coming to us on Earth. They need something from us. They need this assistance, or at least some asked for this assistance, and in exchange for the help, they would provide us with some details of their advanced technology which in turn could be passed to those scientists and engineers who deal with hardware. Paradox of the Converging Time Lines THE BAFFLING, MIND-BLOWING PART OF THIS WHOLE STORY - IF IT IS ALL TRUE - IS THAT DAN BURISCH ULTIMATELY IS TOLD BY HIS GOVERNMENT SUPERIORS THAT THE BEING IS NOT TECHNICALLY 'EXTRATERRESTRIAL' BECAUSE IT IS A TIME TRAVELER FROM A DISTANT FUTURE (AT LEAST 50,000 YEARS IN THE FUTURE), THAT DETERIORATES INTO SEVERE MEDICAL PROBLEMS THAT THREATENS THE ENTIRE CIVILIZATION. THEIR TECHNOLOGY IS ADVANCED ENOUGH TO THROW THEMSELVES BACK TO OUR PRESENT TO TRY TO HARVEST GENETIC MATERIAL FROM EARTH LIFE TO HELP REPAIR THE FUTURE DAMAGE. That's essentially correct, as fantastic as it seems. But it would explain why there is such interaction, why there is such interest in us - why the abductions. Or even why the animal mutilations, because some of these beings are conducting these operations and they are harvesting material. Harvesting material they hope can help them and this is the reason why they traveled back. And another reason is: how did they get into this condition? Well, they are talking about there is yet to come a catastrophe that affects the whole population of the Earth. This catastrophe was of such a nature that it included intense radiation and as we know, radiation can change, mutate genes. Those that were exposed to it underwent micro-evolutionary changes that eventually ended up in this type of creature. Of course, something was defective that was passed on in the genetic line that resulted in the neuropathy. There was another branch of the human race that apparently goes on and remains more human and becomes more as Dan has termed it more 'spiritual' in nature. Both of these branches of the human race at a far time in the future as they have developed technology"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"for not only travel to other planets, because we do go on to inhabit the planet Mars in the future and probably build habitats there. ACCORDING TO DAN'S UNDERSTANDING OF THIS TIME PHENOMENON THAT HE HAS BEEN EXPOSED TO? Yes, according to that. That is a jumping off point from Mars to their ultimate destinations and the little grey type humanoids end up on some planet around Zeta Reticulii 2. The other human blond-type, Nordic-looking types, end up somewhere on a planet near the middle star in Orion's belt, Epsilon Orionis, I believe. I don't know what particular planet that is. Dan had no contact with the Orion beings. He only read about them in the documents. He was only told about them from the J-Rod. He only had an encounter with one J-Rod, as he says. AND THIS EVENT THAT SET ALL THIS IN MOTION IS SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN IN 2012? Yes. He did not hesitate to tell me the year this was supposed to happen was 2012. And I said, 'Oh, you mean the Mayan date.' And he said, 'Yes.' I asked him, 'Why do you think this is?' Actually, he had to check back to find out, so our conversation on this became a little more informed and I was given to understand that somewhere around that date I don't know if there is a little bell curve before and after that date, December 2012 would be the middle point. At that time, our solar system was going to pass through the plane of the galaxy because it has a periodic motion of approximately 200 million years in which it makes an entire circuit of the galaxy. We are approximately 30,000 light years from the core of the galaxy, so we are kind of one of the rim worlds. But we have lots of company. It's going around the galaxy like a horse on a carousel, going up above the plane, down below the plane, like a sine wave. As we pass through the plane of the galaxy, there is a dust belt. We are now feeling the affects of this dust belt because there is an influx of dust coming into the Sun. It is causing the Sun, like a T Tauri type star, to heat up, radiate in infra-red and x-ray bands of the spectrum. (T Tauri stars are young suns, near many molecular clouds in our galaxy. They have temperatures and masses similar to our Sun, but are brighter and more variable, with solar-like activity at X1000.) Worm Holes and Time Travel \" Can highly advanced civilizations build wormholes through hyperspace for rapid interstellar travel and machines for traveling backward in time?\" - Kip S. Thorne, Astrophysicist Illustration on Page 483, Black Holes & Time Warps © 1994 by Kip S. Thorne. The only thing that Dan mentions that would put a coming 2012 catastrophe outside current scientific knowledge is what (the J-Rod says) lurks in this band of our Milky Way galaxy - that is natural worm holes (not confirmed by Earth scientists). Worm holes hypothetically can connect two points in space and time (Einstein-Rosen bridge), as if the points were adjacent to one another. Therefore, if there is any radiation coming from the center of the galaxy in addition that could be absorbed by the planets, if a worm hole comes into alignment with this, it could amplify that radiation. Then the radiation would seem like we were right adjacent to the radiant source. If there were any (artificially engineered time travel) machines of such a nature that they could generate artificial worm holes on the Earth and were active at the time (Earth passed through worm holes in the galaxy), that in turn would also amplify this radiation. So, if you want to consider the scientific world and that natural or ET-made 'star gates\" really do exist and they were left on Earth by ancient civilizations a long time ago then if any of them remain secret and somebody goes to activate them in order to escape (catastrophe) or make their own exit to save their own hide, that could be disastrous for all of us because it would amplify the catastrophic consequences.\" Global Warming and Freezing -"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Are Galactic Gas and Dust Regions the Cause? In the July 25, 2003 Science Journal, the \"Astrobiology: Latest News\" section reported: \"Solar System's Path May Have Spurred Ice Ages Physicist Nir Shaviv of the University of Toronto argues that the path of our solar system through the Milky Way galaxy may be responsible for Earth's periodic ice ages. Our Sun and its planets move in a slow orbit around the center of our galaxy. Over time, our solar system passes through the galaxy's spiral arms-regions dense with stars. Where there are more stars, there are also more supernovae-giant stars that explode in a flood of cosmic rays. Such rays could affect Earth's atmosphere and alter its climate. Shaviv says that the timing of ice ages on Earth correlates closely with the historical levels of cosmic ray exposure and with the solar system's route through the spiral arms. Other scientists have previously suggested that our solar system's galactic orbit makes Earth habitable.\" YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS HOOKED INTO THE NATURAL CYCLE OF THE ENTIRE GALAXY THAT WE ARE IN. BUT THERE HAVE BEEN ABDUCTEES AND OTHER PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY/INTEL WORLD WHO HAVE NOT SPOKEN ON THE RECORD, BUT HAVE SUGGESTED OFF THE RECORD THAT WHAT WE ARE COMING UP AGAINST IN 2012 IS GLOBAL NUCLEAR WARFARE SET OFF BY EVENTS IN THE EARLY PART OF THE 21ST CENTURY IN THE MIDDLE EAST. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THE RADIATION AFFECTS THAT CREATED THE J-RODS AND THE BLOND NORDICS AS DAN BURISCH HAS BEEN TOLD COULD BE LINKED DIRECTLY TO NUCLEAR GLOBAL WARFARE? Let me make this statement first. How would they know this? How would they know there was a coming nuclear war when we could strategically plan to avert it? How would they know this unless they had some means of accessing the future? Right? Either through a remote viewing program of some kind or some kind of device that has been developed like in Project Looking Glass. Project Looking Glass is an instrument to assist them in looking into this. But another source, if I may go outside of the Dan Burisch circle, another source indicated to me that a long time ago, one of the first gifts given to us by the extraterrestrials and given to Harry Truman of all things was a sphere and this sphere was multi-dimensional. It had 6 portals. One of the portals would open up a view of the future. That was the first one they were able to open up. And they saw things they could not understand. And what they saw, I was told, was fire, fire, fire everywhere, like the Earth was burning up. And they could not comprehend that. But as I understand it, that sphere still exists. And another device called the Yellow Book which is a holographic type of record that the J-Rods have about our history and their history from thousands of years ago to the present and into the future. And some people, who have had access to the Yellow Book, have accessed the future and have almost gone crazy about what they have seen. WAS THERE ANY INDICATION OF A TIME WHEN THIS WOULD OCCUR? Some time between, I believe, 2007 let's say to beyond 2012. But 2012 is kind of like a center point.\" More Information: Sky Fire In my book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume II: High Strangeness , there are several references by people in the human abduction syndrome, ranging from a U. S. Navy airman to civilians, in which each describes being shown pictures of Earth surrounded by \"sky fire\" at a time of apocalyptic events. See: Earthfiles Shop.

Peripheral neuropathy describes damage to the peripheral nerves, the vast communications network that transmits information from the brain and spinal cord to every other part of the body. It may be caused by diseases of the nerves or as the result of systemic illnesses. Many neuropathies have well-defined causes such as diabetes, uremia, AIDs, or nutritional deficiencies. In fact, diabetes is one of the most common causes of peripheral neuropathy. Other causes include mechanical pressure such as compression or entrapment, direct trauma, penetrating injuries, contusions, fracture or dislocated bones; pressure involving the superficial nerves (ulna, radial, or peroneal) which can result from prolonged use of crutches or staying in one position for too long, or from a tumor; intraneural hemorrhage; exposure to cold or radiation or, rarely, certain medicines or toxic substances; and vascular or collagen disorders such as atherosclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and polyarteritis nodosa. A common example of entrapment neuropathy is carpal tunnel syndrome, which has become more common because of the increasing use of computers. Although the causes of peripheral neuropathy are diverse, they produce common symptoms including weakness, numbness, paresthesia (abnormal sensations such as burning, tickling, pricking or tingling) and pain in the arms, hands, legs and/or feet. A large number of cases are of unknown cause. Is there any treatment? Therapy for peripheral neuropathy differs depending on the cause. For example, therapy for peripheral neuropathy caused by diabetes involves control of the diabetes. In cases where a tumor or ruptured disc is the cause, therapy may involve surgery to remove the tumor or to repair the ruptured disc. In entrapment or compression neuropathy treatment may consist of splinting or surgical decompression of the ulnar or median nerves. Peroneal and radial compression neuropathies may require avoidance of pressure. Physical therapy and/or splints may be useful in preventing contractures (a condition in which shortened muscles around joints cause abnormal and sometimes painful positioning of the joints). What is the prognosis? Recovery from peripheral neuropathy is usually slow. Depending on the type of peripheral neuropathy, the patient may fully recover without residual effects or may partially recover and have sensory, motor, and vasomotor (blood vessel) deficits. If severely affected, the patient may develop chronic muscular atrophy. What research is being done? The NINDS supports a broad program of research on disorders of the peripheral nervous system, including peripheral neuropathy. Much of this research is aimed at increasing the understanding of peripheral neuropathy and finding ways to prevent and cure the disorder.\" Neuropathy Association 60 East 42nd Street Suite 942 New York, NY 10165-0999 info@neuropathy.org http://www.neuropathy.org Tel: 212-692-0662 800-247-6968 Fax: 212-692-0668 National Foundation for the Treatment of Pain P.O.
