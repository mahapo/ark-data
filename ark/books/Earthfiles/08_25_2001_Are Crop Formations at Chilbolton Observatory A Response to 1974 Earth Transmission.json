August 25, 2001 Chilbolton, Hampshire, England - For the past few years, crop formations have appeared in the wheat field near the Chilbolton Observatory in Chilbolton village, south of Andover, Hampshire. The one from August 2000 now seems linked to the August 2001 formations. Last year's was one of England's largest 2000 formations in terms of square footage and appeared next to the Chilbolton government-owned land upon which the radio telescope complex was built in 1965. The facility is sectioned off from the public and is surrounded by a high barbed wire fence. The estimated measurements of the code formation is 200 feet long and 85 feet wide; the estimated face measurements are approximately 160 feet wide and 180 feet long. Both are framed by wheat laid down in almost identical fashion, according to field researcher, Charles Mallett, from Roundway, Wiltshire.

According to an employee at the Chilbolton Observatory, on Tuesday, August 14, 2001, a framed \"face\" appeared, followed the next Monday, August 20, 2001 by a \"binary code.\" When Paul Vigay, Director, Independent Research Center for Unexplained Phenomena in Southsea, Hampshire, England, first saw the aerial photograph of the \"code\" formation, he immediately recognized it as extremely similar to the November 16, 1974 digitally-encoded transmission sent from the Arecibo, Puerto Rico radio telescope out into space. The Arecibo transmission was planned by astronomers at Cornell University, including the late Carl Sagan. Cornell University operates the 300-meter-diameter (985 feet) radio telescope built into a mountain under a cooperative agreement with the National Science Foundation. That original 1974 Arecibo transmission is shown below on the right in a black and white graphic of the binary code beamed at a star cluster called M13, about 23,000 light years from earth; in the middle is the Chilbolton 2001 face; on the left is the Chilbolton 2001 \"transmission code\" for comparison to Arecibo's.

Interview: Paul Vigay, Director, Independent Research Center for Unexplained Phenomena, Southsea, Hampshire, England: \"It could be that their DNA is uneven in the helix, so it's got extra components. I won't know for certain until I've decoded the center bit. Because if you look down between the two strands, there's like a vertical bar in the middle between the two. Now, the original Arecibo transmission that corresponded to the number of nucleotides in the DNA itself as a binary code. Now that was subtly different on the ground. So obviously that could give a key to why the strands are different on the outside. Because if they have a different number of strands in the DNA itself, then that could account for the off balance as it were. On right: Bottom half of transmission code: the DNA symbol, humanoid, solar system and Arecibo transmitter are depicted in descending order in the 1974 Arecibo binary transmission in black and white. The humanoid standsbetween binary information about its height on the left and the earth's humanoid population in 1974 on the right. Below the humanoid, the sun is depicted as a square with its 9 planets. The third planet from the sun, earth, is raised up toward the human figure. The bottom symbol depicts the radiowave transmission arc from the Arecibo radio telescope. The dish diameter of 300 meters is in the bottom line of binary code. On left: The Chilbolton wheat formation for comparison. Is that what you were able to confirm today in the field? Yes, I confirmed that on the ground. There is a single dot. It's a single digit that has been changed in the middle."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A single digit? Basically where you've got the binary code where you have the zeros and ones, the squares and empty squares in the vertical bar between the two sides of the DNA. There's actually change in the original in the middle there. But I won't know until I actually count those on the computer and run it through to calculate the DNA sequence. Then hopefully that may give an indicator as to why the outside is different. There is something indicating a difference in DNA between the two codes. there is also a difference in the solar systems. The Arecibo transmission showed earth as the third planet from the sun raised toward the humanoid figure. Right. In the Chilbolton wheat field, the solar system goes over two planets and then three planets are moved up the way the Arecibo transmission raised up earth. The third one is moved up. The fourth one is also moved up. The 5th one is moved up, but it is also changed from a single dot into four little dots, forming a sort of cross. What do you think that means? That one is interesting. It could mean that there are three planets in their solar system are inhabited and they actually come from the 5th planet. Because it looks like they've indicated three planets raised up as we did the earth, but they have also indicated that 5th is special some how because they have highlighted that all the more with that division into four parts. Or it could mean that possibly the 5th planet could have three moons around it. If there is a one-to-one relationship between the new code and the 1974 earth code, where we put a human figure, there is what could be perceived as a figure in the Chilbolton code. It looks like it has a very large head with protruding eyes and a short, thin torso. Is that a fair description? Yes, some people have likened it to a gray alien or something. Whatever it is, it's a lot shorter than the human. It's confusing because if it were a code transmission reply to the 1974 Arecibo message, why would the sender put a human-like face in the Chilbolton field instead of the strange, big-headed entity depicted in the code? I wouldn't like to speculate on the origin of that face. I like to focus on my research and let people come to their own conclusions by showing them the research. But I can't for the life of me see how you would go about hoaxing that face. You can't see the pattern at all from the ground. It's very neat and tidy, but it looks a mess if you follow in terms of the shape. You can't say, 'Oh, yes, this is a circle and crescents' like you can in a normal crop circle. It just looks like a load of random dots. And yet to get that effect from the air, which it is obviously designed to be seen from, it's quite incredible. I can't see how you could hoax it without someone in a helicopter speaking to you on a radio or something saying, 'Left a bit. Right a bit.' Because it's just so complex and unrecognizable on the ground. And you can't see how you would, especially in the dark, go from one to the next and not make a mistake. To get that full effect from the air is actually quite incredible. Let's talk about the bottom segment of both transmissions. In 1974, Arecibo sent out an arc over a binary code indicating the diameter of the Arecibo radiowave dish. In the Chilbolton code, that same bottom space has the identical pattern of a huge formation that appeared right next to Chilbolton the year before in August 2000. The implication is the bizarre"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"pattern depicts a transmitter. Right. The key to understanding the code is that underneath the representation of Arecibo is the size of the dish which ultimately affects the transmission frequency that it goes out from. That was another discrepancy in this new August 2001 code in the field because the actual size indication is different. It's a different code and I need to find out how the original wavelength was encoded in the original (Arecibo) transmission and then apply to the new pattern and see what that yields. Because I have a suspicion that might give a key implying that the previous crop circle (August 2000) was some form of communication of origination or has relevance to decoding it all. When you transmit the signal from the Arecibo one, if aliens had picked it up on the other side of the universe, then obviously they got as far as decoding our signal and they set down into the box there about where it originates. You might find the frequency that they picked it up on. There is one other discrepancy and it's encoded in the atomic numbers. At first when I saw it on the aerial photo, I thought it was an error or a smudge on the photo that you couldn't make out. That is one of the main reasons I drove up there (to Chilbolton, Hampshire) today to have a look. But it's not an error; it's precisely encoded in the sequence. This is in the sequence of the elements? Right at the top, you've got the bit that's the sequence of the numbers 1 to 10 in binary code. But immediately beneath those, you've got the atomic numbers for basically the main elements on earth, the building blocks that support life. That's the P.O.N.C.H. sequence? Yes, that stands for Phosphorus, Oxygen, Nitrogen, Carbon and Hydrogen. Now you can decode that. The one that corresponds to the \"P\" is a complete line. Like it's all there, which in binary would be 15. It would be 1111. The following one, if you read it vertically, would be 0001. So that corresponds to 8. If you right down 0001 in binary, you get 8. And of course, the 8 corresponds to the oxygen. Then the next one would be 1110, which is 7, which corresponds to nitrogen. The next one is 011, which is 6 in binary, which is carbon. And then the very last one is the single 1 which corresponds to 1 which is hydrogen. You're saying that in the Chilbolton code formation, it's changed? Yes, in the Arecibo transmission, you've got the five columns going across, hydrogen, carbon nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorous. But on the ground which you can't see unless you analyze it in detail - and I did confirm it today - there are actually 6 columns. So whoever did this code formation inserted an extra element. Now they have inserted it between the oxygen and the phosphorous. so instead of going 1, 6, 7, 8, 15, they've actually coded it as 0111, which is 14. So, it then goes 1, 6, 7, 8, 14, 15 in the code. Then, if you look up the atomic number for 14, you get silicon. That is very interesting because lots of people have speculated that if there are alien life forms, which are not carbon-based life forms as everything is on Earth, then about the only other element in the entire periodic table that could possibly support life is silicon-based life forms. So you could theoretically have a planet that could have silicon as its dominant element. If it's genuine binary code communication, I think the insertion of silicon in there is possibly a significant find.\" More Information: The new updated 2nd Edition of my book, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles contains a new chapter on the 2001 formations, including detailed photographs"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"and text about the Chilbolton and other formations. See Earthfiles Shop . To help clarify the world of binary numbers, the following is submitted by Donald Lortie, a New York City computer consultant and former IBM programmer. NOTES ABOUT BINARY NUMBER SYSTEMS \"We use the decimal number system based on the 10 digits 0 through 9. This is a system with a base of 10. Computers use the binary number system based on the digits 0 and 1. This is a system with a base of 2. Programmers read binary numbers by using the hexadecimal number system based on the 16 digits 0 -15. There are no symbols to represent 10 -15 so the letters A through F are used to represent numbers 10 through 15. This is a system with a base of 16. Hexadecimal numbers are needed to simplify the reading of long strings of 1's and zeros which computers produce. Everything in a computer is represented by strings of 1's and zeros in binary. The binary number system works just like the decimal number system in that: When you need to represent a number one larger than the highest digit, you place a zero in the right column and a 1 in the column to the left i. e. 9 plus 1 is 10 in the decimal system and 1 plus 1 is 10 in the binary system. 10 in binary equals 2. Adding 1 to 10 equals 11. But in binary that is 3, not eleven. The next binary number is 4 (100) and the next is 5 (101); the next is 6 (110) and so on. All these binary numbers are derived by following the rule: Zero plus one equals 1 and 1 plus 1 equals 10. Remember 10 is 2 in binary, 11 is three in binary and so on. When you add 1 and 1, you get a carry just as in the decimal system. The numbers get larger when the addition causes a carry to the next column on the left, just as in the decimal system 9 plus 1 equals 10, or 999 plus 1 equals 1000. Now try adding 1 to the number 1 in binary and continuing counting to 15. You should get 1 (one), 10 (two), 11 (three), 100 (four), 101 (five), 110 (six), 111 (seven),1000 (eight), 1001 (nine), 1010 (ten), 1011 (eleven), 1100 (twelve), 1101 (thirteen), 1110 (fourteen), 1111 (fifteen). Actually it is simpler than decimal because you only have to carry 1, never more than 1. Converting these 15 numbers to hexadecimal, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F. How would you read a number like 1100101000111001? First separate the digits in groups of 4 starting at the right: 1100 1010 0011 1001. Then substitute the hexadecimal number for each group of four. A, B, C, D, E and F are substituted for 1010, 1011, 1100, 1101, 1110, 1111 respectively. So the number is CA39 in hexadecimal. CA39 is a lot easier to read than the binary string, 1100101000111001. To understand the value of a decimal number as a base 10 number (i.e.powers of 10 in each column), we multiply the number in each column by powers of 10 and add the results of the calculation for each column. The power for the right most digit is always zero and each position to the left increases the power by one. For example the number 847 is the sum of 7 x 10 to the zero power (= 7) plus 4 x 10 to the 1st power (= 40) plus 8 x 10 to the 2nd power (=800). That is 7 plus 40 plus 800 = 847. The same method is used in calculating the value of binary numbers except that powers of 2 are used instead of 10 because binary is base 2. 847 = 7 x 10 to the zero power = 7 (0 power for rightmost digit)"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"4 x 10 to the 1st power = 40 (1st power for middle digit) 8 x 10 to the 2nd power = 800 (2nd power for next digit) An example converting the number 100 in binary to decimal: 100 in binary is equal to 0 times 2 to the zero power (= 0) for the rightmost position, zero times 2 to the first power for the middle position (= 0) and 1 times 2 to the second power (= 4) for the leftmost position. 0 plus 0 plus 4 = 4. Therefore 100 in binary is 4 in decimal. Finally, 1111 in binary = 1 times 2 to the 0 power = 1 1 times 2 to the 1st power = 2 1 times 2 to the 2nd power = 4 1 times 2 to the 3rd power = 8 8 plus 4 plus 2 plus 1 = 15, so 1111 in binary is equal to 15 in decimal. Now try converting the number CA39 in hexadecimal to decimal using a base of 16. It's a little more difficult. Clue: it's a larger number in decimal than you think.\" We b s it e s : http://www.cropcircleresearch.com http://home.clara.net/lucypringle http://www.cropcircleconnector.com http://www.temporarytemples.co.uk Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
