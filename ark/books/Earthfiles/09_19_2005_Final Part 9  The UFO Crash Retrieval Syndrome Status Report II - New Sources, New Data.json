Here begins Part 9 of Status Report II, written in January 1980. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report III begins at Earthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all the previous status reports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield: \" ITEM B-13 In my first UFO crash/retrieval paper I made brief reference to an alleged violent incident occurred in the Spring of 1977 in southwestern Ohio which involved an encounter between a landed or disabled alien craft and its crew and a U. S. military detachment dispatched to the site. Since it made news and drew inquiry, the town nearest the site has been identified as Lumberton, on Highway 68, southeast of Xenia, Ohio and Wright-Patterson AFB. Lumberton, Ohio, southeast of Xenia and Wright-Patterson AFB, where human/alien shootout allegedly occurred in spring of 1977. The incident is one of violence, ending in a western-style shoot-out. Word was that it resulted in 11 American casualties and an unknown number of aliens deaths. To add fuel to this story, which emanated from a research group in Pennsylvania, I learned from another source in Cincinnati that a person working in an 'off limits' area at Wright-Patterson claims to have seen 'bodies on litters' arriving at the base during the same time frame. Researchers involved in the investigation of this sensitive incident prefer anonymity. It all began when a respected researcher in Pittsburgh overheard the story during a luncheon from an engineer who worked for the city's school system. He, in turn, "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"knew of another person who was supposed to have been involved somehow in the macabre experience. But the key person, despite repeated attempts, could never be reached. Bob Pratt, a respected reporter for the National Enquirer, also tried to pursue the case and hunt down the key source. He, too, talked with the secondhand source, but he would not reveal the identity of the principal source. In October 1977, I also tried to get a lead by calling many law enforcement agencies covering three counties. I got nowhere. It is understandable, if this case is true, that it would be kept under the tightest security. ITEM B-14 February 12, 1979, was a day like all days in my quest for a new material relative to the UFO crash/retrieval syndrome. I had called David Mannweiller, columnist for the Indianapolis News who featured a story about an anonymous source with information about the recovery of an alien body from a saucer crash in 1948. He promised he would try and arrange an interview, but his source dried up. I also got a call from a New York reporter for The Village Voice who desired an interview with me for an article concerning my UFO crash/retrieval material. This also vaporized. And there were other calls, but the real eye opener came about midnight from Larry Moyers, State Director of Ohio for MUFON in Akron. Moyers pardoned his late call, and as I tried to recover from a half sleep, he jolted me with news so extraordinary that I was not sure if I were in a dram. Moyers had just an hour earlier received a call from a person named Ron Johnson who made the claim that he had recovered a small humanoid body appearing to be injured, but still alive, from a roadside while driving through the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania. Confused as what to do next, he put the creature into his car and rove on. About 3 hours later, when he stopped to check the body, he found it motionless and presumed that it was dead. Johnson described the creature as humanoid, about 3 feet tall, without nose and only one ear. The other ear appeared to have been sheared off. The biped covered with a downy fuzz, had only three fingers with webbing in between, and the feet were 'neither left nor right, not in the sense that humans are.' A metallic cloth covered the entire body. Johnson's main concern, said Moyers, was his fear of legal consequences for allowing the entity to die while in his possession without notifying the police. In desperation, he drove on to his home in Akron and placed the cadaver into a deep freezer. Johnson explained that he had remembered hearing of a local UFO research group and finally got Moyer's telephone number and called him for advice. Because of the lateness of the hour and fatigue, he agreed to see Moyers early the next morning and gave him his address and phone number. Moyers who was concerned called me. My advice, in the play against time, was for Larry and a trusted friend to go to Johnson's at the earliest next day. Take a camera, I suggested, to photograph a variety of shots of Johnson and his cadaver as proof. Then call an attorney and a medical doctor for their expertise. In the meantime, I told Moyers I would head for Akron and be on hand to advise the authorities, key researchers and the media. But, Larry and I both smelled a hoax. Early the next morning, Moyers joined by Mike Candusso got to Johnson's house as planned. While parking to check the house number, they saw two women leaving the house. When asked if they knew Ron Johnson, both said they never heard of him. Then Moyers checked the neighbors. No one knew of Johnson. Moyers then phoned the number given him by Johnson. To his dismay, the phone had been disconnected. When Moyers called me to explain his dilemma, I too called the 'Johnson' number. Said the Operator: 'The number you have dialed has been disconnected temporarily at the customer's request.' Hoax? Probably. Who is the real Ron Johnson? Was his game a ploy to test Moyers with an ulterior motive? And why was the phone number he gave Moyers disconnected and on whose request? Hoaxes, although rare, and other inexplicable acts are not new to me and others investigating mysteries of the crash/retrieval syndrome. Another case in point, and so typical of following a new lead, involved a dentist in Bloomington, Indiana, to whom I was referred as having UFO crash/retrieval information. When I called the dentist he recalled that his brother, a retired Navy Captain in Washington, D. C., had discussed with him several years before his part in the transportation of a crashed alien craft. Seeming eager to help, he gave me his brother's phone number. But when I called the retired Navy Captain, he said he did not remember ever talking about such an affair with his brother. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"There are many other leads bearing promise of information to come by mail, a return phone call, or a visit. Weeks, months, a year might pass. So often the response is nothing; a silence rooted in fears of reprisal or ridicule; or a desire for privacy - or all three combined. This is understandably human. Indeed, I feel privileged to know what I do know and for what I can relate. This is my inspiration. I hope to learn still more with new leads now on hand, and if I persist with patience in this endeavor. PART III: STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF UFO CRASH/RETRIEVAL EVENTS 1. Chronology of UFO Crash/Retrieval Events Known By Year Statistics, it must be emphasized, about reported UFO crash/retrieval events are inadequate and perhaps misleading. In the main, for this analysis, I have used only the sources who can identify the year of the event. Informants in this category range from the firsthand source to those less credible. There are also many reports, even from good sources, with no year affixed to the event and thus are not included in this report. The total number of reported events for any one year might describe a single event rather than isolated events. A breakdown by years follows. Year and Number of Reports Prehistoric 1 WWII 1 1947 3 1948 3 1950 3 1952 8 1953 7 1957 1 1962 2 1964 3 1965 1 1965-1968 3 1973 1 1974 1 1975 2 1977 3 1978 4 1979 2 TOTAL: 49 The most interesting feature is that the preponderance of reported UFO crash/retrieval events out of a total of 49 occurred in the 1950s, a total of 19 reports, followed by 9 in the 1970s, 8 in the 1960s, and 7 in the 1940s. These figures indicate that there were more UFO crash/retrieval events in the 1950s, which suggests that in each of the two decades following, the news about the event has been more effectively controlled, or that a later model of the alleged alien craft has overcome a technical vulnerability to Earth's geological or atmospheric or human interferences. 2. Geographic Distribution of Reported UFO Crash/Retrieval Events This cursory analysis concerns C/R reports worldwide from general sources, including those with the year of the event unknown. Again, insufficient data obscure the few credible firsthand reports. From all these diverse sources, I am aware of 16 reports allegedly occurring outside the continental limits of the United States. Three of these, according to a C.I.A. employee, occurred in Russia, two in Communist China. Compared with the 16 reports outside the USA are 27 allegedly occurring inside its boundaries. The figure 27, however, is ambiguous as it might include more than one source describing the same incident. For instance, in 1947, I have three separate sources probably describing the same incident. This also holds true for 1948, where three independent sources might all describe a single event. Further analysis shows, according to general information reaching me, that 17 of the 27 events have occurred west of the Mississippi River and 10 east of the Mississippi. Many reports of C/R events in the U.S. are not included in this analysis as no site for the incident is known. For instance, an alleged alien craft having been seen in an Air Force hangar, or a body in deep-freeze, is not a statistical entry. In consideration of all C/R material available, it would only be a guess as to the true number of actual"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"events occurring in the United States. At one time, I guessed at a dozen incidents. But perhaps this is just the tip of the iceberg. On the other hand, if only one or two incidents have substance, then there still would be justification for another Status Report. 3. Chronology of Crash/Retrieval Events World War II: England.

(Item B-14) "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" EPILOGUE Who, in our world, is this strange little mortal of human configuration? Is the UFO crash/retrieval syndrome and its tandem, the humanoid, a part of a grand weird hoax, or an officially or privately contrived deception? Hardly. Assuming that the biped does exist, and my Status Reports assume just that, then is the little 'monster' an experimental creation conceived by a clandestine earthly laboratory? Hardly. Or again, assuming that all my informants are correct, is the creature with an overdeveloped head and atrophied body and limbs a distant relative of primordial man whose beginnings share a common cradle? Or is the creature, born in space and developed through a parallel chemistry akin to the Homo sapiens , in an advanced state of evolutionary regression? And finally, guessing again, we might ask if 'it' is a clone developed for tactical and expendable purposes by a higher order of extraterrestrial intelligence? Whatever the state of its alleged existence, the entity is alien to man. Until more is known, we can only hope that the alien's large head might manifest a high enough intelligence to allow for its intentions to be merely curious and not hostile. With the paucity of reliable, firsthand information, I believe that the suggested use of a graph by which I could show the physiological details reported by each witness can offer little for qualitative analytical purposes. Perhaps the best graphic illustration is contained in the attached composite sketch conceived out of the data from the medical doctor who performed an autopsy. Leonard H. Stringfield Cincinnati, Ohio October 29, 1979\" \" D rawing of humanoid based on information received from medical doctor who performed autopsy. Data, concerning relative size of head, torso and limbs, and other details, were gathered over a period of several months in 1979, during which time four separate drawings were submitted for comment. On my first drawing, he drew a heavy ridge of brow over the eyes, and indicated less length of neck and less drooping shoulders. After third drawing, he commented, 'Check a 5-month fetus to get proportionate size of head and body.' For the final rendition above, he said, 'The proportions are right.'
