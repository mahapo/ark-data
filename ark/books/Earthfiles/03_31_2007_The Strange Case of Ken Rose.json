Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon The Strange Case of Ken Rose © 2007 by Linda Moulton Howe re we a former colony that our owners lost all rights to and are trying to make a case against us to prove to a council or world representatives that we as a human race are not fit to govern ourselves?\" - A bductee Ken Rose March 31, 2007 Central Michigan - On February 2, 1992, I was in Lansing, Michigan to speak before a Michigan-MUFON conference organized by Shirley and George Coyne. My presentation had evolved from my investigations of the worldwide animal mutilation phenomenon linked to extraterrestrial biological entities. Ranchers and other rural residents where the unusual animal deaths occurred had reported seeing a variety of non-humans, including \"standing up lizard or alligator,\" tall \"praying mantis\" type creatures, 5-to-6- feet-tall blond humanoids and shorter grey-skinned, large black-eyed entities. Then there were several people in the human abduction syndrome who told me about encounters with a similar variety of entities. I had been collecting drawings from as many firsthand eyewitnesses as I could over several years. So, I decided for the first time to share the drawings and eyewitness accounts of different non-human types at the 1992 Michigan conference. I was nervous and expected criticism because at that time, the only non-human types generally discussed publicly were the small, 3.5 to 4.5-feet-tall \"greys\" with black eyes and four, long fingers. But my investigation philosophy had always been to follow facts and eyewitness descriptions wherever they lead without trying to make answers conform to a pre-selected bias of what is, or is not, acceptable reality. I had learned from my animal mutilation research that when incidents are presented publicly, other people emerge with their own repressed eyewitness accounts. In my Michigan conference presentation, I showed drawings of lizard and praying mantis humanoids, Bigfoot, Blond Hairs, Red Hairs, Black Hairs, Tans and a variety of Greys. At the end of my presentation, I asked anyone in the audience who had encountered any similar beings to see me afterward. There was a large surge of people ar ound me. Some were asking questions and others were telling me that some of the drawings were \"exactly what I saw, but never told anyone.\" In the clamor, I saw a thin, blond man to my right trying to push his way through the crowd. I noticed him because he looked so frightened. He got closer and said, \"I really need to talk to you.\" I asked him to wait in the back of the room. After the crowd thinned, I found the man and his wife sitting together. The couple asked for anonymity, so I w ill call them Kenneth and Jeanne Rose, married at the time for twenty-one years. Ken was so nervous that I suggested we go find some coffee to relax. A waitress poured our cups and when Ken Rose tried to lift his to drink, he was shaking so badly that his cup clattered against the saucer. \"Mr. Rose, what has happened? Why are you shaking?\" I asked \"Your shoes,\" he answered, pointing at me. \"Your shoes. They are the same color that I saw on your body in a tube!\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The word \"tube\" caught my attention. I had interviewed others in the human abduction syndrome by then who also described seeing cloned or other bodies inside a tube technology that haunted them. [ See Linda Porter and Wanna Lawson in my 2-volume book, © 1998 Glimpses of Other Realities. ] But I had not talked about or published any of those experiences in public. I looked at my shoes. They had a silver-grey meta llic sheen. \"What did you see me in?\" I asked, deciding not to disclose any other knowledge from previous interviews. Ken Rose began to talk very rapidly and the details were confusing. So, I asked him if he would draw what he had seen. I handed him my notebook. At first, he protested that he could not draw. I told him all that mattered was a clearer visual sketch of what he was trying to say. He took my pen and as he tried to draw, he spoke about his troubling memory. F irst sketch by Kenneth Rose on February 2, 1992, in Lansing, Michigan, for Howe. Rose said the incomplete female bodies with eyes shut were coated with meta llic gold dust like the woman in the Hollywood film, Goldfinger. Drawing © 1998 by Li nda Moul ton How e, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness. \"I don't know how I got there, but these little grey things ('They are not nice') took me where there were three ladies inside tubes. It was a little, round room that was all dark except around the tubes where it was lighted. There was some kind of dim light inside the tubes. It was an eggshell white light, so beautiful, but it smelled like acid-sweet, pure vanilla and made me nauseous. On the far right was a woman who l ooked like you. In the middle was another one that looked like the singer Kate Bush from the 1970s."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"And on the left was a Mexican-Indian, or maybe more Mayan-looking, woman. The three were all covered in metallic dust just like your shoes. Seeing you here today wearing those shoes made me remember. I couldn't believe it! I still can't believe it! The women in the tubes looked like the woman in the spy movie, Goldfinger , when she was painted gold.\" S econd drawing of three women in lighted tubes sent to Howe by Ken Rose in March 1992. Far left tube: \"Mayan Indian\"; far right tube: Linda; middle tube Kate Bush, 1970s singer (Hounds of Love ). Drawing © 1998 by Linda Moulton Howe, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Str angeness. \"What do you think the gold dust on the bodies was for?\" I asked. \"They (aliens) said the gold dust was anti-bacteria, or to preserve the bodies.\" \"The one on the right looked like me?\" \"That's why I'm so scared! Watching you this morning, the memory came flooding back. And you and the other two were missing body parts. There were no breasts, no public hair, and there were holes in the stomach. I could look up into the open body cavities and one of the grey things said, 'They're under construction.' They were alive, but not awake, and the look on their faces was so tormented. It made me hurt all over, especially the one on the left end, the Mayan-looking one. Her head was tilted back with a painful look on her face. Everyone's eyes were closed and the hands were forward with the palms out.\" Jeanne Rose suggested that maybe Ken could do more and better drawings when he was relaxed in his home and he agreed. So, I gave them my address in Philadelphia at the time and hoped he would continue to try to recall more details and send me whatever drawings he could."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"A few weeks later, a large package came postmarked March 23, 1992. Ken Rose had made another attempt to depict the three women in tubs which bothered him so much. He also sent drawings from other experiences he recalled with his comments, including an encounter with what he called the \"Overseer\" and the \"Controller,\" the same word used by abductee Wanna Lawson who had also seen human and non-human bodies preserved in lighted tubes. T he hairless \"Overseer\" described and drawn by Ken Rose based on his abduction experiences in central Michigan since the 1960s. Drawing by Ken Rose for Howe in February 1992, and © 1998 by Linda Moulton Howe in Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Str angeness. Ken Rose: \"The Overseer - controls - oversees - the power of life and death - God. He who watches - makes the Final Judgment - the decisions. He who feels = he who hates - love - I feel no sympathy, only sorrow, for me. This was a side glance, no direct look. No hair on his head, (but) looks human. Black leather clothes. 6 feet - milk white skin - could not see color of eyes. (L ooked) like Yul Brynner (bald actor). \" The small Greys would not look at him. Scared of him and his power over life and death. The next time I looked at the Overseer, he crossed his arms real close and I could feel his stare right through me. I was going to live or die at that moment. He had the power over everything - kind and loving, but could kill you without a moment's hesitation.\" "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"T he praying mantis-Controller \"studies everything - looking for something?\" Drawing by Ken Rose for Howe in February 1992, and © 1998 by Linda Moulton Howe in Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Str angeness. Ken Rose: \"In the same room, the Controller was busy at controls where I saw him wearing a pearl or grey-colored helmet that looked like it had horns. Understood that with a flick of a switch, the Controller could provoke anyone anywhere in the world, manipulated people into actions and studied reactions of other people at large. Studying all behavior. Nothing goes unnoticed. In my drawing, I wrote, 'The Controller - makes things happen - study the reaction - controls everything - studies everything - makes everything happen, all that happens - He makes happen - studies patterns of behavior. Looking for something? Can't get too close - the Overseer is watching.' \"Linda, what does it mean? Are we a former colony that our owners lost all rights to and are trying to make a case against us to prove to a council or world representatives that we as a human race are not fit to govern ourselves?\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"K en Rose wrote on his 1992 drawing: \"Overseer at some kind of control. I didn't talk - or look - stare at the Overseer. I saw at a glance - a quick look. I looked at the Controller. I didn't talk - no sound - I could hear - in my head - no sound except I did hear a hum from the ship. I felt warm all over from the hum. The next time I looked at the Overseer, he crossed his arms, real close and looked. I could feel his stare right through me - I was going to live or die at that moment - he had the pow er over everythi ng. Ki nd and l ovi ng - and ki l l you w i thout a moment's loss. The Controller was taking measurements, recording. If I made no eye contact - I would be spared!\" Ken Rose remembered telepathic thoughts from the Overseer and sent the following text with his drawings: Ken Rose: \"The purpose of mankind is to help raise the conscious state in lesser animal forms, like it was done for us by genetically altering to a higher state of consciousness. We are to colonize the planets in our solar system after bringing them to a more habitable state, which we can do with chemical alteration. By providing more habitat for more species, we are fulf illing the role in which God intended us to have as caretakers. We were (to be) the caretakers, not the destroyers. We were designed to be the workers in the grand scheme. Man is a product of a genetic manipulation. Something happened in man's history whereby he was abandoned by his maker because the Council told them (genetic manipulators) - No More Interference. [ Editor's Note: Ken Rose and I discussed the contradiction between human assignment to colonize planets versus a Council block to prevent the \"defective\" human race from traveling into space.] \"Our makers were robbing the planet of all its wealth, for whatever reasons, and they were treating human life inhumanely. Their reckless disregard for human life (they destroyed Neanderthal man and introduced Cro-Magnon) resulted in the Council stopping their use of slavery of mankind. There's a confederation of ETs that are studying mankind, but they are under commission by the C ouncil not to interfere with human affairs.\" \"This information isn't much, but it's what I've tried to remember. I asked the people on the craft - why were the people of this Earth like the way we are? I found humans cold-feeling, k illers. Life anywhere in the universe is a struggle, but life in its varied forms is quite beautiful. On this Earth, people look past the multi-forms and kill them. Instead of working with this planet, they work against it. So, I also asked them (non-humans): why were we in Vietnam k illing"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"people? \"They answered, 'Your words do not represent your feelings, your emotions. Your actions do not represent what you believe to be truth about your own self. Your words do not fit your actions. You have many levels of justifications, but few, if any, represent the truth. Truth is centered around you - is like a circle, is closed. Truth can be only a straight line - cannot be a circle. Truth cannot be accepted. It injures the ego, the self. To accept life means to accept all life. You are not ready, nor w ill you be ready, to accept all life. This (human) race is defective. We cannot give this race the opportunity to flee this planet (Earth) with the knowledge of the stars. It would be too dangerous for the rest.'\" Ken Rose said that he asked who the \"rest\" were, but there was \"no reply. End of conversation.\" Along with his drawings, Rose also sent a separate letter on notebook paper about his understanding of what the Overseer and Controller might be doing. Ken Rose: \"The plan is simple - create a state of mental confusion among the populous. This w ill c onvince a consortium of represented groups in the Council - (that) only intervention w ill rectify an ever-growing state of mass confusion. \"Breakdown - social break down - an ever-growing mentally ill society - a hyperactive state - an addictive society to anything - a state of collection - obsessive-compulsive state - ownership and the need to get stuff. (Need for) security was built into the human psyche. \"Reason for this is the outcry and eventual expulsion of the early colonists when, after creating Neanderthal man, they found that creation would not work for them. They destroyed the Neanderthal and replaced them with Cro-Magnon man. That with the extermination of the dinosaurs earlier - yes. I know what you are thinking, but I'm not crazy.\" L eft: Homo neanderthalensis (La Ferrassie) or Neandertal, was a species of the Homo genus that inhabited Europe and parts of western Asia. By 130,000 years ago, full blown Neanderthal characteristics had appeared. Right: Modern Homo sapiens sapiens emerged about 35,000 years ago and Neanderthals became extinct in Europe approximately 24,000 years ago. Source: Wikipedia. [ Editor's Note: The Mesozoic is divided into three time periods: the Triassic (245 - 208 million years ago); the Jurassic ( 208 - 146 million years ago); and the Cretaceous (146 - 65 million years ago). Large reptiles dominated land animals on Earth during most of the Mesozoic Era. Then dinosaurs disappeared with the advent of a large asteroid impact near the Yucatan peninsula in the Gulf of Mexico about 65 million years ago. One abductee hypothesis is that non-humans removed species of dinosaurs to another planet"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"for preservation prior to the global asteroid catastrophe that marked the end of the Mesozoic Era.] Ken Rose and his wife separated in 1992.
