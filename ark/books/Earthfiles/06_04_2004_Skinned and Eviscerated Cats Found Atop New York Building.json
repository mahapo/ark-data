June 3, 2004 Manhattan, New York - Yesterday half a dozen skinned cats with blood and organs removed were found by construction workers atop a two-story brick building at 31-27 Thomson Avenue in Long Island City, Queens, New York. The cat remains were taken to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in Manhattan. There, Special Agent Joseph Pentangelo examined them, said it was \"macabre and horrible,\" and sent the bodies to the ASPCA hospital. I talked with him this afternoon about results from preliminary tests. Interview: Joseph Pentangelo, Special Agent, American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), Manhattan, New York: \"The cats were removed to our ASPCA hospital yesterday and some preliminary tests were done. At this point, we've determined that the cats' bodies and some of their organs had been treated with a chemical designed to retard or delay decomposition - a chemical like formaldehyde. Also, some of their organs had latex ejected in them, which I also understand is a method to preserve organs. THIS WOULD IMPLY WHAT TO YOU? The implications at this point are that we are speaking to an individual - I don't want to characterize him as a suspect - but we believe we are speaking to the individual at least responsible for putting the cats on the roof. It appears that he was using them for some sort of teaching purposes for biology. Whether or not he is officially sanctioned to do that or is affiliated with any kind of learning institution, we have not determined that. WHY WOULD HE PUT THEM ON THE ROOF? I don't know. That's the disturbing part of it. But I don't want to speculate. It certainly caused public alarm in doing it. And how he came in possession of them - whether they were already in that state when he came in possession of them or if they were alive when he came in possession of them is still being investigated. IS HE ARRESTED? No, he is not a suspect at this point. He is a person we are interviewing.
