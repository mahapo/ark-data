Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 2 - Ted Phillips's Search for \"Black Mirror\" Cylinder in Slovakia © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe The Tatra mountains in which the cave and black, shiny cylinder were explored by Antonin Horak in October 1944, are west of Kosice, Slovakia. April 30, 2004 Branson, Missouri - Nearly thirty years ago, Ted Phillips was working closely with astronomer J. Allen Hynek, Ph.D., who consulted for the U. S. Air Force on Project Blue Book and later founded the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). Dr. Hynek was also a professor in the Department of Astronomy at Northwestern University and director of its Dearborn Observatory. In 1970, Ted and Dr. Hynek met and talked with an engineer from Slovakia named Antonin Horak. The engineer showed Ted and Dr. Hynek a diary he had kept in October 1944 during World War II when he and two other wounded soldiers hid in a cave in the Tatra Mountains south of Krakow, Poland. Desperate for food, Tony Horak began exploring one of the cave's long passages. He came upon what he called an astonishing manmade cylindrical object that had a \"black mirror\" surface. Below the object, he could hear machinery sounds and felt mild heat.

Dr. Hynek thought that an expedition should be mounted to the Tatra Mountains and asked the young Ted Phillips to go seek out the cave and try to find the object so that it could be studied scientifically. Money was raised, but the Russian struggles with Czechoslovakia after the 1968 invasion interfered with Ted's traveling in 1970. Then 29 years later in 1999, Ted finally made his first trip to Slovakia with a research grant provided by Joe Firmage, then CEO of a California computer company. Incredibly, Ted could not find the small cave entrance! But after he returned to the United States, a Slovak contact sent him a pre-World War II map that matched more closely the map that Tony Horak had originally shown Ted and Dr. Hynek. So, Ted returned to Slovakia in 2001 and finally found the entrance by nearly falling into it. Ted asked his Slovak guides to hang him upside down through the narrow entrance. Then Ted was able to see a long passageway as Tony Horak had described. But there had been a landslide that prevented Ted from getting further into the cave. Now, Ted Phillips is determined to go back with mine engineers who can shore up the cave entrance in the Tatra mountain and search for the cylinder with the black mirror surface described in detail on the pages of Antonin Horak's 1944 diary."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The Tatra mountain that contains the cave and the \"black mirror\" artifact. Photograph © 2001 by Ted Ph illips. Interview: Ted Phillips, Director, Center for Physical Trace Research, Branson, Missouri: \"\"Here I quote again directly from the diary when he came to the end of this long, level passage, there was a crawl way. \"Crawling through still kneeling, I froze in amazement. There stands something like a large, black silo framed in white. Regaining breathe, I thought this is a bizarre natural wall or curtain of black salt or ice or lava. But I became perplexed and awestruck when I saw that it is a glass smooth flank of a seemingly manmade structure which reaches into the rocks on all sides. Beautifully cylindrically curved, it indicates a huge body with a diameter of about 25 meters. Where this structure and the rocks meet, large stalactites and stalagmites form that glittering white frame.\" Original two pages in engineer Antonin Horak's diary of October 1944 during World War II after he had explored a cave looking for food to help two wounded soldier colleagues who were hiding with him inside the cave. Drawing by Antonin Horak in his original diary pages photographed by Ted Phillips. I remember very distinctly because I wrote some notes, in 1970 during our discussion at the diary, I asked Tony, 'How would you best describe this material? What did it look like?' I wrote down his answer and he said it was like a 'black mirror.' No seams, no rivets, no blocks. He tried to break some fragments out with a pickax and couldn't scratch it. He even shot his military rifle into the side of this thing and couldn't make a scratch. As he stands there looking at this large expanse of this black material, he notes there is a vertical, slanted crack running down the front of it and as he moves up closer to it, he sees that it might be possible to go through the bottom of the crack at the floor of the cave room."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"A vertical, slanted crack running down the front of the large (25 meters diameter), \"black mirror\" object. Tony Horak went through the bottom of the crack at the floor of the cave room. Drawing by Antonin Horak photographed by Ted Phillips. After several attempts and several cuts, he finally disrobed and kind of dropped through it. It goes down at a sloping angle of about 40 degrees and as he went through it, he could determine that the outer wall was about 7 feet thick. As he popped free of the inside of the front wall, he rolled down an incline of limestone and into the back wall. He f ound himself inside the artifact that was shaped roughly like a fat crescent moon and it extended upward about 12 degrees off vertical for an undetermined distance and he was never able even with carbide light torches to see anything like an end to it above him. Over the period of time measuring and exploring this thing, he starts chipping away at the limestone that he is standing on what to him is the cave floor down in one of the corners of the crescent. The limestone there is not as thick and hard and after several days of digging and hammering, he broke through about 6,000 years of limestone deposit to find the skeleton of what was later identified by its teeth as a prehistoric cave bear. (Cave bears Ursus spelaeus were populous throughout Europe during the Ice Age Late Pleistocene (10,000 to 300,000 years ago, larger than any current modern bear.) Inside the artifact was underneath 5,000 to 6,000 years of limestone deposit.

The last prehistoric cave bear was killed 11,000 years ago and the question that Tony posed and you first think of: How did a 20-foot-long bear get through a crack that a man who had not eaten for four days could barely wriggle through? So was there a connection? And Tony broached that in the diary was there at some point a connection with the surface where the bear some how fell in? But there was no and I questioned him closely about this there was no surface debris around the skeleton of the bear or inside on this limestone deposit. So, of even more interest, the bear was lying on a wavy grill which extended on down which Tony felt was absolutely manmade and it was a wavy, series of wavy parallel lines of material forming a vertical grill that went on down below his feet. He placed his cheek against the grill work and could feel heat coming up through the grill work and not a lot of heat but enough to sense and he could hear what he described as something like a large turbine in the distance. You have to keep in mind that this man, Tony, had been in mines most of his life. He was familiar with underground noises, sounds and situations. A wavy, series of parallel lines of material formed a vertical grill that went down below the cave bear skeleton and \"black mirror\" object. Antonin Horak placed his cheek against the grill work and could feel heat and hear sounds like a turbine running below. Drawing by Antonin Horak photographed by Ted Phillips. HE WAS AN EDUCATED ENGINEER. A very educated engineer, yes. So, that is incredibly significant, not that the artifact is not equally incredible but something was still evidently going on of some nature. What was interesting is that in my last trip over there before I found the cave, I knew I was in the general area pretty close. And I noticed as I went through this one particular area on the mountain that battery powered devices would either go nuts or would shut down. Believe me, there is nothing out there. There are no power lines for, I couldn't guess, for how many miles. No structures, no humans. I don't think there are many animals. There are snakes, but that's about it. On my next trip (2001), I took in my EM field meter and a couple of other instruments and I laid them on the ground in this area that seemed to be about 20 to 25 feet across in the center of this area and then backed up and started videotaping. The compasses and EM meter are all swinging in 2 second pulses with absolute regularity. When several days later, I found the cave and started surveying it, the cave is headed back in that direction. The map of the cave that I have from Tony's diary indicates that the main passage is pretty well a straight line of travel. I don't know. That's reaching, but what would be on this mountain that would be generating a 2 second pulse of what? IS YOUR SUSPICION THAT WHATEVER THIS BLACK, GLASSY MIRRORED"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"OBJECT IS, IT COULD BE LINKED TO SOME KIND OF TECHNOLOGY THAT GOES BACK AT LEAST 12,000 OR MORE YEARS? I can't believe that I even entertain these ideas. Ten years ago, I would never have considered some of this stuff. But the facts are the facts. And when you take everything into consideration, where and how this thing is located inside the mountain it is 2,700 feet or so below the top of the mountain and two miles back in a cave in the middle of nowhere. With a prehistoric cave bear inside and the deposit over the cave bear and something going on down at some greater distance yes. I think the configuration of the artifact indicates it is definitely manmade. You don't find a thing like this in Nature. I think it is pretty clear I've had a lot of caving experience and I think it is pretty clear that this thing pre-dated the cave, that the cave formations are formed on it (the artifact). The deposit is in it. If it pre-dates the cave, we're looking back much farther than 11,000 years. I talked to one of the top geologists in the Czech Republic without going into any details about the artifact, but about that particular area in the Tatra Mountains. Those mountains suppose this thing was sitting there and pre-dated the mountains and was caught up in the upheaval of the mountains and trapped inside, entombed in there, and then later the cave formed as they will under the right conditions? Those mountains were generated 67 million years ago. ON OR ABOUT THE TIME OF THE PERHAPS ASTEROID THAT HIT THE PLANET THAT DID IN THE DINOSAURS? You are precisely right on. That's and I find that really fascinating. But you know, I don't know, Linda. It's just incredible to talk about. But I have been there and it's there. There is no question. It's a matter of getting to it and my primary goal always has been to get to this thing to establish that it is as Tony said it was and I have no doubt that it is. then to very discreetly take in teams of two or three scientists. Surely you can talk scientists into taking a trip and looking at something as opposed to trying to get them interested in other things that we deal with. Over a period of time, I would like to try to determine the origin and purpose of this thing. I think it has to be done fairly discreetly because you would not want a government, for example, going in and sealing off the cave before there was an opportunity to investigate it. ESPECIALLY IF THERE IS STILL SOME KIND OF TURBINE OR ENGINE OR SOMETHING GOING ON DOWN BELOW. Yes. That seems such an incredibly far fetched story, but this was a guy who would have known I've set in caves and heard really weird things that weren't even there. But I was able to sit there and rationalize that it was not real. This man, Antonin, had a lot more experience in the underground than I. He had given it a lot of thought. His goal was to be able to help a team get there and do the scientific research. He did not want it exploited. He talks in his diary about, 'I don't want tourists coming in and destroying the land' and trying to blow the mountain up to get it out and so on. I'm just trying to follow what he wanted, his desires, because I think it's the best approach.\" More Information: Ted Phillips is now trying to organize a professional team of cave engineers and scientists who can travel with him back to the Slovakia cave to find the black cylindrical object. Ted has posted photographs from his 2001 trip at his website: www.cptr.us Ted welcomes hearing from anyone who might have more information about the Tatra Mountain magnetic anomalies and to hear from anyone who might seriously be interested in contributing funding for what Ted hopes w ill be his third and finally successful research trip that he started with Dr. J. Allen Hynek and Antonin Horak in 1970. J. Allen Hynek, Ph.D., Astronomer"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The New York Times obituary on May 1, 1986: \"J.Allen Hynek, Ph.D., an astrophysicist and consultant to an Air Force project to assess reports of unidentified flying objects (U.F.O.s), died of a malignant brain tumor Sunday at Memorial Hospital in Scottsdale, Ariz. He was 75 years old. In World War II, Dr. Hynek was a civilian scientist at the J ohns Hopkins Applied Science Laboratory, where he helped to develop the navy's radio proximity fuse. Josef Allen Hynek was born in Chicago, Ill., to Czechoslovak parents. He graduated from the University of Chicago in 1931 and earned a Ph.D. degree there in 1935. He joined the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Ohio State in 1936. After the war he returned there, rising to full professor in 1950. In 1956 he left to join Prof. Fred Whipple, the Harvard University astronomer, at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, which had combined with the Harvard Observatory. Dr. Hynek had the assignment of directing the tracking of an American space satellite, a project for the International Geophysical Year in 1956 and thereafter. In addition to 247 optical stations around the world, there were to be 12 photographic stations. A special camera was devised for the task and a prototype was build and tested and then stripped apart again when, on Oct. 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched its first satellite, Sputnik. Dr. Hynek, who moved to Scottsdale from Evanston, Ill., a year ago (in 1985), was for 18 years professor and chairman of the Department of Astronomy at Northwestern University and director of its Dearborn Observatory, until he retired in 1978. He was involved in the Air Force U.F.O. research effort from 1948 to 1969. Often his task for the Air force was to examine at first hand more substantial reports of flying saucers and the like. In 1966, after a rash of sightings in Michigan, he went to the area to take charge of the investigation. After interviewing scores of people, he ascribed certain sightings to luminous marsh gas rather that something from space. Nevertheless, he said, \" Scientists in the year 2066 may think of us very naive in our denials.\" He long asserted that U.F.O.'s should be taken seriously and he eventually became displeased with the Air Force approach. He said that its methods were slipshod and that it was not conducting a scientific study. The Air Force, in turn, concluded that there was no evidence of extraterrestrial craft and the U.F.O.
