S. Storm Prediction Center, says many lives were probably saved by the biggest one because everyone in the weather service could see it coming. That was the F5 vortex that levelled whole subdivisions in Okahoma City. F5s are considered to be one of the most powerful storms on earth and this one was a mile wide and ten miles high so huge that storm trackers could give warnings for more than two hours. Unlike typical tornadoes that break up after moving only a few miles, this F5 traveled 55 miles in a steady path at about 25 miles an hour before breaking up. At one point, police stopped traffic along Route 44 to allow the tornado to pass as it headed toward Oklahoma City. And storm shelters were filling up before the monstrous tornado struck. Another kind of catastrophe could come without any warning and the Clinton Administration is trying to anticipate and upgrade American preparedness. The threat is bioterrorism the release of dangerous bacteria or viruses in aerosols. Two of the most feared are anthrax and small pox. Anthrax exposure can come through breathing in the spores, or the spores can be absorbed through sores and cuts. Anthrax does not spread person to person. But small pox does spread person to person very rapidly. Both anthrax and small pox have high mortality rates. The man charged with trying to increase awareness of bioterrorism and what to do about it is Dr. Donald Henderson, Professor of Medicine and Public Health at Johns Hopkins University. Recently he was appointed Director of a new Center for Civilian Biodefense Studies in Baltimore. He told me that bioterrorist attacks are now considered a much greater risk because of at least three events in Iraq, Japan and Russia. Interview: Donald Henderson, M. D., Professor of Medicine and Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland: \"One is the 1995 defection of Saddam Hussein's son-in-law and with him a great many papers detailing the extent and sophistication of the Iraqi bioweapons program which is far greater than anybody had imagined it to be. WHAT ARE THE GREATEST DANGERS IN IT? They are primarily working with we know they are working with anthrax. That this is an organism that is very hardy when it's produced in dried form, it can be put up in an aerosol. By an aerosol, I mean very fine particles that can be breathed in and taken into the lung and it's a very fatal disease. WHAT ARE THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF ANTHRAX? Well, the person just feels sort of ill, generally ill. And has a sort of heaviness in the chest. Headache maybe. Maybe some fever. And then very often, it's a fairly rapid course and resulting in death often in one to three days. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"IN ONE TO THREE DAYS. AND DURING THAT PERIOD OF TIME, HOW DO THE SYMPTOMS CHANGE? Well, the individual will have increasingly high fever, will look increasingly sick, may have all sorts of pains and a number of things from convulsions to goodness knows what it depends upon what the organism attacks. Now, we know that if we give monkeys one or even two doses of anthrax vaccine, that by the end of 30 days, the individual will have protection. And anthrax behaves peculiarly in that the first cases after an attack would come down probably within two to three days. But cases could continue to occur as a result of that exposure up to two months afterwards. YOU MEAN THERE COULD BE A DELAYED ONSET OF SYMPTOMS? Yes. So you've got a lot of cases that can occur early on and some will occur as late as two months after the exposure. So what you want to do is try to figure out how to protect people who have been exposed and who might get the disease later on. There, if you use antibiotics, it is clear that you can prevent the disease from developing. RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF STRATEGIZING, WHAT IS YOUR PERCEPTION ON HOW YOU WOULD HANDLE AN ANTHRAX EXPOSURE FROM YOUR CENTER'S POINT OF VIEW? Basically what you would want to do is begin with antibiotics immediately for all individuals who are thought to have been exposed. As soon as you possibly could. IF IT''S AN AEROSOL EXPOSURE OVER A LARGE CITY AND YOU'RE NOT SURE WHETHER IT'S IN THE HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS, WOULD WE HAVE ENOUGH ANTIBIOTICS TO COPE WITH SUCH A SITUATION? Not at the moment. And this is the reason for developing a stockpile and provision for creation of a stockpile is in the President's budget was for this year this is partly funded out of monies made available this year. There is a request for additional monies next year. ARE THOSE ANTIBIOTICS IN VOLUME AVAILABLE YET, OR WILL IT BE ANOTHER YEAR? I don't know when they will be available. I can't answer that. The thought is not to try to put them all in a warehouse and stash them away, but to try to work with the manufacturers so that the antibiotics that are called for are antibiotics in regular use for other diseases. And so the idea would be to work with them to develop some sort of a reserve stock of vaccine which would be a bubble in a pipeline of supply, so that a lot of it could be satisfied in that manner. IF SOMEONE SAID TO YOU 'DR. HENDERSON, I DON'T WANT AN ANTHRAX VACCINE BECAUSE I'M AFRAID OF IT.' WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THEM? All I could say is that we've been through the evidence and the reactions are very low in number. They are safer than many of the vaccines that are out there on the market right now. It is highly protective and the result of inhaling anthrax spores out there is a pretty fatal business. I think it's crazy to be gambling not to take the vaccine. I THINK THE ARMY HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT SOME SORT OF MILITARY PUNISHMENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE HAD RESISTANCE AMONG THEIR TROOPS. That's right. I think we have people who resist, do not want to be vaccinated for whatever reason and they are not subject to reason on this at all. IF THE PERSON HAS THE ANTHRAX VACCINE, WHAT WOULD BE THE TYPICAL 24 OR 36 HOUR EFFECT AFTER? I suppose less than 1% would have a little fever and sore arm. THAT''S IT?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"That's it! HOW LIKELY DO YOU AND THE INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE WHO ARE WORKING ON THIS BIOTERRORISM THREAT THINK SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD HAPPEN AS A RESULT OF PEOPLE EITHER FROM THE MIDDLE EAST OR SOMEPLACE ELSE? The general consensus is that it's very unlikely to occur, but the fact is that if it DID occur, it would be ultimate catastrophe. And whereas, we thought at one it was so improbable that it did not warrant taking special measures, at this point in time, I think we feel very differently about it. I talked with you about the Iraq situation that's only one part of the equation which has alerted us that we've got a bigger problem than we thought. The second issue was the Japanese cult that released sarin gas in the subways of Tokyo in 1995. Then we discovered they had been working with anthrax and botulinim, a toxin they had tried on eight different occasions to aerosolize this throughout central Tokyo with hopes of killing literally hundreds of thousands of people. Now, they failed. But it was a technical failure. They were really intent on doing this. That group is still intact still running a series of commercial enterprises and still taking in money. And the third thing, is the Russians themselves who through the word of defectors, we have been informed that Russia mounted a very major bio weapons program beginning somewhere way back intensified in the 1970s and again in the 1980s and it produced huge quantities of organisms. IN THE 1990S, WHAT IS THE STATUS IN RUSSIA? I think we have only a partial reading on what they have and a lot of it is unknown as to how much capacity and stockpiling they now have. IF THERE WAS NO MAINTENANCE IN RUSSIA, THERE COULD BE LEAKAGE? I think that's probably less likely than the problem that the scientists are not being regularly paid. Guards at these facilities are not regularly being paid. And we know that many have left those facilities for other countries. WHAT IS THE FBI AND CIA PERSPECTIVE ON ANY KIND OF RELEASE OF BIOLOGICAL PATHOGENS FROM RUSSIA BECAUSE OF THIS INABILITY TO KEEP THINGS MONITORED AND SECURE? There are a lot of things you just don't know. And you can't estimate the likelihood of something going on. I think it's much more difficult to know what's happening with biological weapons than either nuclear or chemical weapons. Because the work can all be done in a very small area, very inexpensively, involving comparatively few people. The product is very small and hard to detect. You really have difficulty getting information on this. COMPARED TO BOMBS, WE'RE DEALING WITH SOMETHING THAT IS SO MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND HAS SO MANY MORE UNKNOWNS THAT IN MANY WAYS IT''S MUCH MORE DANGEROUS? This is what Colin Powell said in fact. His statement was that he is more afraid of the biologic weapons than either chemical or nuclear. WHAT IS YOUR OWN PERSPECTIVE AS A PROFESSIONAL DOCTOR WHO IS NOW HEADING THIS CENTER ON BIOTERRORISM AS WE MOVE NOW INTO 2000? I think it's a real worry. WHAT IS THE WORST CASE SCENARIO THAT YOU WOULD ANTICIPATE? Well, I think a small pox epidemic would be the worst thing we could think of. MORE SO THAN ANTHRAX? Yes, because it keeps spreading and at this point in time, we don't have very much vaccine."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE SYMPTOMS OF SMALL POX WOULD BE WHAT? A person about 12 to 14 days after exposure develops very high fever and aching pains. And then begins to develop a rash which are like little vesicles that form pimples and pustules fill up with puss and extends over the body with heaviest on the face and arms. It is a very severe disease -- probably the most feared disease of all the infectious diseases and about 30% of the people die. IT IS FEARED BECAUSE IT DOES DAMAGE TO INTERNAL ORGANS? Because it spreads from person to person. And 30% of the people die of the disease. And there is no treatment. NO TREATMENT FOR SMALL POX AT ALL? None at all. IT COULD BE EASILY SPREAD IN AN AEROSOL BECAUSE IT'S SO CONTAGIOUS PERSON TO PERSON? It could spread and keep spreading. IT''S AIRBORNE? Yes. Whereas anthrax is not spread person to person. Smallpox does. HOW DOES ANTHRAX SPREAD? DO YOU HAVE TO BREATH IT IN? Yeah, but it does not spread from person to person.\" IS THE PRODUCTION OF MORE SMALL POX VACCINE PART OF THE PRESIDENT'S NEW PROGRAM? It is. WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT WILL BE IN PLACE? At least three years. OVER THESE NEXT THREE YEARS, THE VIGILANCE WILL BE ON THE BACK OF THE INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY? Well, there is vaccine. But it's not in large supply. So anything you use, you would have to use very prudently. More Information: I learned from Dr. Henderson that the U. S. Army Medical Research Institute studied the release of anthrax by aerosols in the 1960s during tests in the South Pacific. The Army wanted to learn how far anthax spores would travel in the air and cause disease. Their test subjects were monkeys. The answer was at least fifty miles. If the spores aren't breathed in by animals or humans, those that settle onto soil can still cause disease if kicked up into the air or get into sores and cuts. I welcome comments and questions from listeners and current news about the environment, science, medicine and unusual phenomena. The crop circle season is underway in England, a cattle mutilation was reported in Colorado a few days ago, and I'll have updates on those and other anomalies in the weeks ahead.
