Discovered May 13, 2001. Aerial photograph © 2001 by Frank Laumen. Zierenberg and Kassel, Germany have been the focus of crop formations through the 1990s. May 19, 2001 Zierenberg, Germany - The fourth European crop formation since April 26 was discovered on Sunday, May 13 at 7:30 a.m. by the farmer in yellow flowering oilseed rape not far from Kassel, Germany in the farming community of Zierenberg. Each year for the past several years from May 1 on, formations have emerged in Zierenberg crops. The sixfold formation in 2001 is one of the most intricate ever to appear in crisp, dense oilseed rape (canola). On either side of the sixfold pattern are \"signatures\" of an \"L\" an a crescent ring. The farmer told researcher and photographer Frank Laumen that he \"was surprised to have found no signs of a human footprint on the soil and the plants were pretty wet in the morning. It would have been impossible not to cause suspicious footprints, but there were none.\" Frank reported that several visitors to the formation reported to have felt a strong energy, so strong that some had to leave the formation after about twenty minutes.

Warnford, Hampshire, England Two mornings earlier on May 11 across the English Channel in Hampshire, England, another farmer tending his oilseed rape field found a large flattened circle surrounded by two rings right below the Old Winchester Hill. Old Winchester Hill, Hampshire, England, rings around a flattened central circle in yellw flowering oilseed rape. Discovered by farmer on May 11, 2001. Aerial photograph © 2001 by David Russell via swirlednews.com . The area is between East and West Meon which have had repeated formations throughout the 1990s. Like most farms in England suffering through the devastating scourge of foot-and-mouth disease, all access to the fields have been closed off. Researcher and Lucy Pringle has asked the farmer for special permission to enter the formation to do plant and soil tests on Sunday, May 20. Afterward, she will fly over the formation and take photographs. I talked with her today.

And there is a track leading up to it, but it's a helluva long walk. So I'm going in tomorrow at half past nine. One of the farm hands was there the night it formed and he heard absolutely nothing and saw nothing. And what it appears to be is circular with a flattened center. Then a circle of standing crop, then another flattened bit, then another standing crop and a flattened bit and then the perimeter. THAT MAKES UP THE TWO RINGS AROUND THE FLATTENED CIRCLE? That is correct. DOES IT SEEM FROM THE PEOPLE SO FAR WHO HAVE BEEN IN IT... No one has been in it. NOBODY? No. YOU'LL BE THE FIRST TOMORROW. Yes, and you know people are not being allowed into these things because of the foot-and-mouth disease. And if anyone was so insensitive, so inconsiderate, as to jeopardize these poor farmers, I would be part of the lynching party! I feel very strongly about it. Well, anyway I hope to fly over it tomorrow night and to see what it's like. I think it will be very beautiful because it is very close to a very large iron age fort which is Winchester Hill and so it will have a lovely background to it, a lovely setting to it. Also being oilseed rape, it's one of the easiest to detect as you know whether any weight has been applied or not. And as I don't believe anybody has been in there simply because it is so remote and with the limitations of not being allowed in, I hope we will be able to tell fairly accurately if weight has been applied to it, any human involvement. ISN'T IT NOTEWORTHY AFTER LAST YEAR AND ALL OF THE CONFUSION AND CONTROVERSY ABOUT HOAXING THAT HERE IN THIS SPRING AFTER ALL THE BSE AND FOOT-AND-MOUTH DEVASTATION AND PEOPLE STAYING AWAY FROM THE FIELDS IN ENGLAND THAT THE FORMATION THAT DID COME WAS NOT IN WILTSHIRE WHERE ALL THE CONTROVERSY WAS? Yes, indeed. This is a beginning as you so rightly said, the beginning was in Hampshire, so it's almost as though it's making its mark to say, 'Right. Yes, here we are again. And we're back where we started in the original place as a sort of confirmation, if you like, of the existence of the phenomenon.'\" We b s it e s : http://www.franklaumen.de/ http://www.invisiblecircle.de/ http://home.clara.net/lucypringle http://www.cropcircleresearch.com/ http://home.hetnet.nl/~cropcircle/crop2001/Zevenbergen05.htm http://home.hetnet.nl/~cropcircle/crop2001/Aalten05.htm"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"http://invisiblecircle.de/ser/d2001/d200105131-uk.html http://www.dcca.nl/ http://www.swirlednews.com/ Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
