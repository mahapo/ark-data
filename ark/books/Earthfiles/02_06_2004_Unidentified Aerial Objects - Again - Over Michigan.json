Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Unidentified Aerial Objects - Again! - Over Michigan © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe Since December 2003, several Michigan residents have seen highly strange unidentified aerial objects in the skies over Horton, Napoleon, Litchfield and surrounding areas. February 6, 2004 Jackson, Michigan - The following e-mails with images attached were received by me a little after midnight on February 5, 2004, sent from a resident of Jackson, Michigan who I will call \"John D.\" \"Linda, I've had the most incredible evening (on night of February 4, 2004)! I had two UFO sightings in the space of 2 1/2 hours, in two different counties! The first sighting was near Litchfield in Hillsdale County, Michigan. The second was in Napoleon, that's in Napoleon County, and the good news is I've got video of that one. February 4, 2004 at 6 p.m. in Litchfield, Hillsdale County, Michigan First, I want to tell you about what I saw near Litchfield this evening. I live on the extreme west side of the city of Jackson in Jackson County, Michigan. I work in the town of Litchfield, which is in Hillsdale County and I travel 29 miles to get there. I travel through farm country so there are lots of open spaces along the way. I left work at around 6:00 pm and was about 5 miles from Litchfield on a 'country' road named Rainey (or sometimes called 30 Mile Rd) when I saw a bright light to my left (west). It was twilight out and it really caught my eye. I pulled off to the side of the road, which ended up being a mistake because even though the road was clear, there was a lot of snow on the roadside and I got stuck. I eventually got out with the help of a passerby, but not before I got out of my truck and continued to watch the bright light I had seen. It was headed east, in my direction, and although I was curious about it I assumed that it was an airplane. I "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"knew better after it rose a couple of hundred feet at a very steep angle and passed me overhead. It made no noise and had a bright light in front and behind, and two at the sides; the strange thing was that the two side lights were close together compared to the front/behind lights, which would be odd for an airplane. This gave it a rod-like appearance. The object continued to travel toward the east. As soon as I got home, I grabbed my Sony digital camera and headed to Napoleon, because Napoleon seems to be a hotbed of UFO activity these days. On my way out there, I noticed that the sky was very active: there were 5 or 6 contrails bunched together at one time in one part of the sky, in another was a very slow-moving (almost stationary) and blinking light - it seemed as if airplanes were all over the place tonight, but I find myself wondering how many were actually airplanes! I ended up on a dirt road off of Austin Rd because I knew from your reports last month that there had been UFO activity there. I was not disappointed! I got video and enclosed are still images of the event. John D. Jackson, Michigan February 4, 2004, Around 8:10 p.m, in Napoleon, Napoleon Cty., Michigan The location for these images was just south of where Wolf Lake Road meets/crosses Austin Road in Napoleon township, Michigan. It is a dirt road that was pretty well lit tonight because of the full moon reflecting off the snow. The weather has been very cloudy in our area, but tonight it cleared up a little. Sequence of images videographed and selected by John D. of unidentified aerial object: Video Image 1: 'Object is north of Austin Road flying over an open area in Napoleon, Michigan, around 8:10 p.m. on February 4, 2004. The object was about as high as a low-flying plane, a few hundred feet or so off the ground.' All images © 2004 by John D. Video Image 2: 'I zoom in on the object. Left side has green light, right side is red. Middle part seems to be composed of two white lights. I was not completely sure that this was not an airplane at this point.' "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Video Image 3: 'Object came from northeast on a southwest course heading toward me. It then banked left (it would have passed me on my right, but it had a surprise in store for me instead!). My digital camcorder is just about level with the ground at this point. There was no noise. After banking left, the object silently ASCENDED at an approximately 70 degree angle with the ground! Still zooming in on the object, I found myself pointing my camera higher and higher, until my camera was about 60 degrees from parallel with the ground. The object was now several times higher from the ground than it was before.' Video Image 4: 'After the object ascended I 'un-zoomed' my camera, so that it was taking in as wide an image as possible. I did this because I knew the moon (upper right) was there and I wanted a reference point to show the object's upward motion. The object is the little white dot in the lower left, arrow pointing at it.' Video Image 5: 'The object continues to rise. The moon, the ground and I make a 75 degree angle, so I am NOT pointing my camera straight up at this point, which helps demonstrate that the object is really rising (and in a direction parallel with me) and not just passing straight overhead.' Video Image 6: 'The object rises more. It then banks right and passes me overhead. I lose sight of it while it passes close to the moon (my camera's auto-focus"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"and auto-brightness are the culprits here).' Video Image 7: 'I find the object again after it passes over me. It is moving about as fast as a slow-flying airplane, but makes no noise whatsoever.' Video Image 8: 'I stop videotaping as the object recedes into the distance.'
