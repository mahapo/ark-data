The part about the black death reminded me of my honeymoon... No really! My wife and I went to Italy, and while there visited the Mediaeval town of Orvieto. Orvieto is noted for its Gothic cathedral, or duomo. The duomo was built starting in 1290. On the ce iling is a very dramatic fresco done in 1451 by Luca Signorelli called ‘The Rule of the Antichrist.’ The two things that struck me in this painting were a battle in the sky between two beings (probably God and Satan?) complete with beams of energy, and on the right a bunch of beings dressed completely in black, like Ninjas, with long black staffs! They seem to be gathering up the town’s people and searching a temple of some kind. This really struck me as an actual event that was captured in the fresco, more than iconography. And the figures in black with the staffs reminded me of the reports in the Black Death. T he Duomo di Orvieto is a large 14th century Roman Catholic cathedral situated in the town of Orvieto in Umbria, central Italy. The building was constructed under the orders of Pope Urban IV to commemorate and provide a suitable home for the Corporal of Bolsena, a miracle which is said to have occurred in 1264 in the nearby town of Bolsena, when a traveling priest who had doubts about the truth of transubstantiation found that his Host was bleeding so much that it stained the altar cloth. The cloth is now stored in the Chapel of the Corporal inside the cathedral.

Also in the interview, Linda brought up the idea that somehow death on this planet or plane of existence is somehow useful to the ‘custodians.’ I found this intriguing, and it brought to mind something my brother had told me many years ago. He had a close friend who was a psychic, and she used to say that death in this dimension was feeding another dimension, and that was pretty much our purpose here. The more death here, the better for them there. I always found that a disturbing idea, but the longer I studied the UFO abduction phenomenon, the more it started to make sense. Well, it doesn’t make sense, since we don’t understand what’s going on, but I did see correlations. Another repeating theme is the Grays' fascination with our emotions, telling the abductees that they, the Greys, no longer have emotions. They seem to like to scare people with visions of dooms days and other horrific scenes of our supposed future, all the while setting us up for more conflict and suffering. It all seems like a big game. They feed us some information, showing us things we know nothing about, and then throw in some nonsense along with it. I myself have had this happen, where out of the blue I started seeing a stream of information and ideas, and pictures. I thought ‘Wow, what a lot of great information!’ (who talks this way?) and then I was told in a clear voice to write a book about what I was being shown, and spread the word to people ‘because it will help them.’ As s oon as I thought ‘Wow, I’m not sure I can do all that,’ it stopped. And the main idea that was being shown to me, something about vibrations, was gone from my memory! So maybe they mean well, but then again maybe it’s as long as it’s of use to them. And without emotions, maybe it’s all the same to them. For a while I tried to get it back, but then I started wondering if it’s all a ruse. My brother pointed out how religious movements were started this way, and with a lot of these experiences, the so-called profits are also fed a line of BS that makes them look like they are crazy! So my opinion changed from this was a benevolent intention to that of wanting to set us up for more conflict on this planet! I’ve had no abduction experiences, but have always had a protective and helpful influence around me, which I first remembered when I was quite young. It’s mind boggling to think these beings, and I believe there are more than one ‘race’ of them involved here, can just pop into our thoughts and feed a stream of data into our heads. We probably don’t have a single private moment, yet we have no idea they are all around. Our present reality has no room for such beings, unlike our beliefs of the past. We shared this world with all kinds of beings back then. Skeptics like to ask, ‘If there are UFO’s and aliens, why don’t they make themselves known?’ Well they do, but just to one person at a time. Meanwhile, we are told by the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"officials that run things in our society that they aren’t real, and if you think they are, you’re a crackpot. Something is going on, and something big is about to happen. I wanted to experience this event since I was a kid. But now, I’m not so sure! Do we really want to learn that we are merely someone’s livestock or amusement?” 2) Subject: Fog and Black Death Date: August 23, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “ After reading your interview with William Bramley, I t hought of an interesting Icelandic expression that dates back to the Black Death era. ‘Nú kemur til Teits og Siggu’ - which translates ‘Now it's in the hands of Teitur and Sigga’ and means that one does not have enough information about something and has to seek council. This is how the expression came about: At the time of the Black Death a young man, Teitur, and a young woman, Sigga, lived in a community of a few hundred people called Ólafsfjörður (fjord of Olaf) on the north coast of Iceland. In the autumn they took a several-day trip to the mountains to collect herbs. As they returned, standing on the top of a mountain with the whole fjord in view, they saw a dense fog lying like a carpet over the whole area. Due to the moderate climate and near constant wind from the sea, this was highly unusual. And there was something about the fog that struck them as unusual and made them afraid enough to sleep on the mountain until the fog lifted. When they finally came down, they found that everyone was dead. Later, when relatives of the deceased had to decide property rights, ownership and such, they had to turn to Teitur and Sigga for advice. Thus the above expression.” 3) Subject: UFOs and 14th Century Black Death Date: August 23, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “ The interview with William Bramley is great. I look at the world around me and shake my head. Something strange is taking pl ace. It's true that big money controls the media, so it would be easy to control people's understanding of our times by means of the so-called free press. I can imagine corporations wanting to gain an advantage by lowering pollution standards, for example. But the people at the very top, they are smart people. They know that global warming is a serious problem. They know that there is no escape from pollution. They could encourage an energy policy that taxes the hell out of recreational combustion of fossil fuels. These are just some examples. Why aren't the richest people in the world doing more to work toward the common good of the planet? It seems to me it is in their best interest, at least for the sake of their grandchildren. Ten thousand years of civ ilization, and we haven't figured out how not to do war? Ancient religious traditions that lock a person's mind and heart in a faith-box of systematized beliefs, preventing us from becoming the divine beings I believe we are by nature? Governments that talk about a culture of life while punishing those who speak the truth. Is it crazy to imagine a power greater than the richest of the human rich, actively working to keep humanity from realizing who we are? A race of alien beings influencing our cultures for their own agendas makes much more sense than the world I see around me.” 4) Subject: The God's of Eden Date: August 22, 2008 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “Just got through reading your interview with the author of the above mentioned book. It really hit a nerve with me. For I have felt for a long time now that we were"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the property of some one else. Not that the idea makes me happy. Still I've pondered about what could they possibly get from us, b ecause if they are all that powerful what need would they have. Looking around at the world there is a great deal of suffering that goes on, more so than joy. So maybe they feed off the negative energies produced by wars and confrontations. After all I've found that hate, anger, and violent death create a lot stronger emotional energy than love or joy. Maybe that's why all those figures throughout history who pr eached love and kindness were eventually killed, for if everyone started feeling that way, our owners wouldn't derive the same amount of pleasure that they get from the opposite of that. For obviously we exist for someone else's pleasure and I'm sure laugh at us, if they are capable of such an emotion. Still there has to be more to it than that. The idea of souls being recycled I've always felt was true, also that once reborn we don't consciously remember our previous experience. Yet I believe that on some level of that subconscious we do, and maybe that's why under past life regression we can remember certain lives in bits and pieces. I don't feel that the process is a quick one though b ecause how would one explain my having seen my deceased wife on 4 different occasions since she passed. Not to mention all the other people I've read about with such experiences. There has to be some way to defeat this process, there always is, we just haven't discovered how yet, probably because we haven't really discovered how the process really works.” E arthfiles welcomes viewer comments on the “UFOs and 14th Century Black Death” report and other Earthfiles news.
