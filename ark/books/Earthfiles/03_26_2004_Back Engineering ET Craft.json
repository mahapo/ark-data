March 26, 2004 Lancaster, California - Twenty-one years ago on April 9, 1983, I was at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexico, interviewing an Air Force Office of Special Investigations Agent named Richard C. Doty. I was working on a documentary special for Home Box Office entitled, UFOs: The E.T. Factor. During that meeting, Richard Doty handed me several typed pages as he said, \"My superiors have asked me to show this to you. You can read the document and ask me questions, but you can't take notes.\" The top page said in all capitols centered on the page: BRIEFING PAPER FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ON THE SUBJECT OF UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL VEHICLES (UAVs) The paper summarized more than half a dozen crash retrievals of what were referred to as \"extraterrestrial\" aerial vehicles from a variety of locations in New Mexico, Arizona and even the nation of Mexico. The paper also referred to extraterrestrial entities, both dead and alive, retrieved from those crashed aerial vehicles and specified two kinds: small, grey beings and another kind simply referred to as \"The Talls\" in the briefing paper. When I asked Doty if the \"Talls\" were the blond types also known as \"Nordics,\" he said yes. The last page of the briefing paper had a list of projects that included Project Aquarius. Aquarius was described as an effort to study all extraterrestrial technology, to try to back engineer it and apply what was learned to America's own space program. While I was trying to produce that Home Box Office special, I was told by a number of sources that the retrieved extraterrestrial craft were controlled by the minds of the ET pilots through head and hand devices. I was also told that the craft were not assembled the way we do airplanes with metal sheeting and rivets. The solid silver disks were said to be grown as we would a crystal from solution. Further, I was told our government had retrieved one or more ET devices which \"capture time and play it back.\" When I said, \"Isn't that what we do when we film or videotape?\" Doty said, \"No, it's my understanding that the ET technology literally can replay back segments of time lines.\" I was also told that the ETs could travel in time. Now, twenty-one years after that Kirtland AFB meeting, I and several others from a variety of backgrounds are meeting at the Hilton Washington Hotel in Gaithersburg, Maryland for the First Exopolitics X-Conference about testimonies and evidence that indicate one or more non-human intelligences interact with Earth life, past and present. For ticket information to attend the X-Conference, click on the www.x-conference.com banner. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"First Annual Exopolitics X-Conference, Gaithersburg, Maryland. I will be speaking about the U. S. government's strict policy of denial about all extraterrestrial matters in the interest of national security a policy with punishment to back it up since at least the Truman Administration. I will also be presenting a workshop about the extraordinary layered bismuth and magnesium metal pieces that Art Bell and I first discussed on Coast to Coast AM radio back in 1996 which allegedly came from the bottom of a wedge-shaped craft - not a disk - retrieved on the northern White Sands Missile Range northwest of Roswell in 1947. One of the biggest questions is how successful have American efforts to back-engineer extraterrestrial technologies been? The speaker who will address that question at the X-Conference is William Hamilton, Executive Director of Skywatch International, who works full time as a computer programmer analyst at the University of California Los Angeles. Bill has devoted his private time over the past several years to accumulating testimonies from half a dozen engineers and other scientists about back engineering efforts, both of physical aircraft design and what are called \"biomorphing technologies.\" An important source for some of this information was Ben Rich, head of Lockheed Corporation's famous \"Skunk Works\" for 16 years which concentrated on research and development of Top Secret special projects concerning aerial craft such as the F-117A and other advanced technologies. Lockheed Corp.'s \"Skunk Works\" logo used in association with development of the Top Secret F-117A stealth fighter jets. Source: http://www.f-117A.com/Be n.html Ben Rich, head of Lockheed Corporation's \"Skunk Works\" from 1975 to 1990, in front of the SR-71 Blackbird, one of the Top Secret jets Skunk Works produced. Before Ben Rich died on January 5, 1995, from cancer at age 69, one of his friends named John Andrews - who is also now deceased - asked him several questions about Rich's knowledge of extraterrestrial technology. Answers to some of those questions reached Bill Hamilton through California UFO researcher Bill McDonald. Half a dozen other engineers and scientists have come forward unofficially to Bill Hamilton the past several years to talk about their own knowledge of extraterrestrial craft and back engineering. One of the true major centers of back engineering has long been Area 51 at Nevada's Nellis AFB, which Bill Hamilton says is also now called \"America's Secret Space Base.\" Officially, the Air Force has changed its designation of Area 51 to the United States Air Force Flight Test Center Detachment 3. It's a large restricted air space, about 23 x 25 miles and Groom Lake is at the center of that air space. This week I talked with Bill Hamilton about some of the secret knowledge at Area 51 leaked by engineers such as Bill Uhouse and Ben Rich. Bill explained that Lockheed's Ben Rich talked to the Alumni Association of the UCLA School of Engineering in March 1993 and at the end of Rich's presentation to the engineering students and alumni, he showed a remarkable slide and made some extraordinary comments. Interview: Bill Hamilton, Computer Programmer Analyst, University of California-Los Angeles, and Executive Director of Skywatch, Lancaster, California: \"He (Ben Rich) was showing slides and the last slide he showed looked like a black disk coming up from the Earth and going into space. And at that point, he said to the audience: 'We now have the technology to take ET home.' That's quite a statement. A person sitting there who heard this was Jan Hartzan. He is a senior project manager at Boeing. He's also a graduate of the UCLA School of Engineering. And he's also Director of MUFON Orange County over here"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"in California. I thought that was significant because it definitely confirms that reverse-engineering (has occurred) I mean, when you take Ben Rich's statement and his character, his background, it is nearly unassailable. WAS HE PHYSICALLY ALLOWED TO SEE AND ENTER AN ET CRAFT AT AREA 51? No, but he did make the statements that the (extraterrestrial craft) were real, and positive statements that we had that technology now could only mean that he was so involved that he had to have firsthand hands-on type of experience. Why else would he make such statements? IS THERE ANYTHING THAT IS HARDER THAT WOULD ASSOCIATE HIM HAVING FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE WITH EXTRATERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGY? Just statements that he made to the engineers. For instance, they discovered that one of their equations was wrong and it was corrected, that we could travel at extremely high rates of speed to the stars and that was not a barrier. Statements like this where would those statements (come from?) He is basing those statements on technology that he knows was developed. THE IMPLICATION WAS THAT OUR GOVERNMENT ACTIVELY HAD ALREADY IN OPERATION CRAFT FROM SOME PLACE ELSE AND THAT WE WERE GOING TO THIS SOME PLACE ELSE? He didn't actually say we were going. He said we have the capacity to go. Why wouldn't we? IN BILL UHOUSE'S STORY, HE WAS ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN BACK-ENGINEERING OF SOMETHING IN THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL CONTEXT, RIGHT? Yes, he was involved in the simulators. The simulators were built according to B ill Uhouse so that our pilots could learn how to fly these craft. They are not jet aircraft. RIGHT AND WHICH SPECIFIC KIND DID BILL UHOUSE HAVE THE MOST INFORMATION ABOUT? He talked a lot about the sports model, just like Bob Lazar. (See: Earthfiles 02/06/2004 - Scientists Create and Add Elements 113 and 115 to Periodic Table ; and Earthfiles 09/18/2003 - Update Part 1 - Whistleblower Microbiologist Speaks Out About Alleged \" Alien\" Named J-Rod.) Biomorphic Alien Technology ANYTHING ABOUT THE IDEA THAT THEY WERE SENSITIVE, ALMOST ORGANIC? That idea? He didn't say much about that that I recall. BUT BEN RICH DID? Ben Rich did and there are other sources that have talked along that line. WHAT DID BEN RICH SAY SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THIS SEEMINGLY ALMOST ORGANIC NERVE REACTION? Here is the interesting part. Here is Ben Rich who was head of Lockheed 'Skunk Works' talking about biomorphic craft. What is Lockheed-Martin doing today? They are experimenting with biomorphic aircraft. HOW SPECIFICALLY? They have some exotic 'smart' materials that are being developed by the morphing project shape memory alloys, that type of stuff. Recently, they made an announcement of metal that was developed that could not be cut. It was very lightweight. All of its characteristics match those of testimony that came from the Roswell craft. YES, THE METAL THAT SEEMED TO HAVE MEMORY THAT IF IT CRUNCHED IT UP, IT WOULD FLATTEN ITSELF BACK OUT."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"And that's a recent one. But these morphing aircraft there is a small model that is being tested out here at Lockheed. They have one of the projects on that for NASA. Lockheed's Ben Rich Described UFO Craft Ben Rich from Lockheed said there were two kinds of UFOs and he called them 'unfunded opportunities.' He said one is the kind WE build. And the others are the kinds THEY build, meaning the ETs. DID HE MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEM, WHICH WAS WHICH KIND? No, he just said there were two kinds. DID HE DESCRIBE WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE? He didn't go into a lot of description, except the Roswell craft was the basis according to him of our designs for kind of a triangular 'planforms' and some of the UAVs (Unidentified Aerial Vehicles). WHICH WOULD FIT INTO THAT TERM 'WEDGE-SHAPED' WHICH IS LINKED TO THE BISMUTH/MAGNESIUM LAYERED METAL THAT I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT ALSO AT THE X-CONFERENCE. AND IN THAT WEDGE-SHAPED VEHICLE, WHAT DID BEN RICH SAY ABOUT IT HAVING SOME KIND OF ORGANIC RESPONSE TO PEOPLE OR SOMETHING? There is this written quote from Bill McDonald's notes that might be from Ben Rich: 'The technologies used to grow UFOs in zero-gravity vats using chain molecules as blueprints in all shapes and sizes to include the wing-forms, triangles and discs they are as complex a set of metallurgical chemistries as the organic chemistries that create organic life as we know it. Their systems function as metallic crystalline mimics of organic neural biological patterns. Their processors mimic the function structures and forms of living nerves and muscle tissue down to molecular levels. After 51 years of reverse-engineering attempts, the biomorphical forms of the TOP SECRET 'wave rider' stealth and spy plane designs and R-wave propagation technologies to include lasers and microprocessors, are just in their infancy.' What struck me about that was that back in 1953 we're going back to the era of the contactees there was a contactee named Orfeo Angelucci and he stated in his books ( The Secret of the Saucers , 1955; Son of the Sun , 1959) that the saucers were grown not manufactured in crystal solutions and thus, are all one piece with systems internally generated within the structure of the craft. And supposedly the Roswell ship was a winged metallic crystalline multi-layered aerospace craft. These vehicles were put together, grown, in a liquid metal vat following a chain molecule as a blueprint. It's wings morphed out from its porpoise-like fuselage and its two vertical stabilizers resembled the dorsal fins of either a Dall's porpoise or a porbeagle shark. Above: Dall's Porpoise whose upper fin was used to describe shape of \"two vertical stabilizers\" on a wedge-shaped extraterrestrial aerial vehicle retrieved from a crash site near Roswell in 1947. Be low: Porbeagle shark's upper fin also used to describe ET aerial vehicle's vertical stabilizer shape."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Photograph of final composite model of \"craft of unknown origin\" produced by Tim Bauer, Senior Design Director, © 1999 The Franklin Mint, Philadelphia, Pa. President Dwight D. Eisenhower Meeting with \"Nordic\" ETs in 1954 DID YOU TALK ABOUT THESE NOTES WITH BILL UHOUSE? No. The last contact I had with Bill Uhouse was back a few years ago in the 1990s. But one thing is I was in contact with a retired Marine Sergeant whose name was Charles Suggs and Bill Uhouse around the same time (in the mid-1990s). And Suggs, who had gone on to get a degree in engineering, had been on a crash retrieval during the Vietnam era in Vietnam, whereby they retrieved a craft and placed it aboard an aircraft carrier. WHAT WAS ITS SHAPE, COLOR AND SIZE? It was a disk. It was about 10 meters in diameter, a small one. DID HE KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE ET TYPES THAT WERE ON THAT CRAFT? The beings? He just dealt with the engineering part of it. One of the reasons he was involved was that his father was a U. S. Navy Commander. According to Charles Suggs, (his father) was present with (U.S. President Dwight D.) Eisenhower at Edwards AFB in 1954 when there was contact that was made. WHAT WAS THE FATHER'S FIRSTHAND INFORMATION ABOUT THE EISENHOWER ENCOUNTER? He reported that a craft had landed and there were two beings who were visible to him (Suggs). They looked very human, but they had almost their eyes were extremely light blue, almost colorless. And they had wispy blond hair. And the one who was approached did not want anyone to get closer than three feet from him. DID THEY UNDERSTAND WHY? No. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT THE FAMOUS ALLEGED, 'DID HE (PRES. EISENHOWER) GO TO THE DENTIST OR NOT?' Yes, that was the incident. WHAT DID THIS NAVY OFFICER SAY ACTUALLY HAPPENED BETWEEN THESE TWO BLOND BEINGS AND EISENHOWER?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"OK, here are the notes about it. Retired USNC Charles Suggs I contacted him in September 1994. His father was Commander Charles L. Suggs, USNC, he lived from 1909 until 1987. He was stationed with the Joint Chiefs of Staff Board of Research and Development Committee of Electronics in the E-Ring at the Pentagon. His father attended the landing at Edwards AFB in February 1954 and met Nordics with flaxen long hair and pale blue eyes. Suggs's own experience happened during the early Vietnam era when he was aboard an aircraft carrier in the Pacific as part of a Special Operations Group. He was briefed on the aliens. He was aboard when they retrieved a craft and housed it on the carrier in the late 1950s and brought it into San Francisco Harbor. Sgt. Suggs told me that the S-Band radar in the 1900 to 2900 megahertz band can be tuned to interfere with saucer guidance systems. The S-Band radar is in the 2000 to 4000 megahertz range of radar and electronic counter-measure frequency band designation. SO THAT WE COULD USE RADAR TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR PROPULSION SYSTEM AND BRING THEM DOWN? It interferes with that and he said they had a triad array of gravity drive amplifiers. He called the 'sports model' referred to by Bob Lazar as the 'IRC-16,' meaning 'interstellar recon craft' of 16 meters. WHAT WAS THE SUMMARIZED AS THE COMMUNICATION WITH EISENHOWER AND WHAT WAS THE CONSEQUENCE? They wanted to know what we were going to do with all those atomic bombs that were they were, I guess, somewhere on the base ready to be loaded into aircraft. Mind Controlled ET Craft WHEN BILL HOUSE TALKED WITH YOU ABOUT BEING INVOLVED IN SIMULATORS TO TEACH HUMANS HOW TO FLY EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT, WHAT EXACTLY DID HE SAY HE WAS DEALING WITH IN SIMULATIONS? We cannot use the methods that the extraterrestrials use to control their craft because they do a mind/body interface with the craft. But installing our own means, our own avionics, that our pilots trained on our own avionics, would be able to control the flight of these craft. NOT WITH THOSE BANDS AROUND THEIR HEADS THAT COL. CORSO AND OTHERS HAVE DESCRIBED, BUT SOME ADAPTATION OF LITERAL ET TECHNOLOGY? Yes, and in fact, I think they did try the headbands as far as picking up the brain waves of the pilots and amplifying those. WHAT HAPPENED? I believe that what happened that they have learned that the pilots could not control their thinking processes, could not control their intentions the way the ETs could. Therefore, it was not a very reliable method for them to use. Does American Government Have ET Time Travel Technology? WHAT IS THE MOST SHOCKING OR ASTONISHING THING THAT YOU HAVE HEARD FROM PEOPLE WORKING ON BACK ENGINEERING EXTRATERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGY? That we have time machines, in secret. But see, that is not something I can verify. I mean, it's testimony and I try to listen for similar testimony, right, from independent sources. But it's like that's what we are left with. It's like when somebody gives testimony that they have sighted a UFO. We have testimony. If we have some documents, maybe we have gone a little further. BUT TIME MACHINES WOULD BE PURELY SOME ONE ELSE'S TECHNOLOGY, NOT HUMAN MADE? The person who related this information, a physicist, related that information went to repair one of the time machines. And he knew somewhat how it worked. He did not know how it was developed, or where it came from, or the source of the engineering, or whether it was reverse-engineered, or anything like that."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"IF WE ARE DEALING WITH TIME AND WE HAVE PROPULSION SYSTEMS THAT CAN GET US TO OTHER SOLAR SYSTEMS, AS BEN RICH IMPLIED, WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS STILL KEEPING EVERYBODY IN THE DARK? I may know why, but I can't say. Again, it's one of those conundrums. I mean, the answer makes sense to me. I cannot verify it as the truth. It's like this: if I were to get in front of a large audience and ask, 'Would you recognize the truth if I told you?' Of course, if it is something very strange, I don't think they would. There is no way that I could let's say for a minute that I was an insider and I was to disclose the truth about what is going on that anybody would have any means of immediately verifying it just on my words alone. So, that's the conundrum.\" More Earthfiles Information: · 03/17/2004 -- Part 1 - \"Horrible Secret\" in UFO Crash Retrievals Near Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947? · 03/17/2004 -- Part 2 - \"Horrible Secret\" in UFO Crash Retrievals Near Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947? · 09/18/2003 -- Update Part 1 - Whistleblower Microbiologist Speaks Out About Alleged \"Alien\" Named J-Rod · 10/05/2002 -- Part 1 - Two Scientists Describe An Extraterrestrial Biological Entity Called \"J-Rod\" · 10/05/2002 -- Part 2 - J-Rod and Microbiologist Dan B.
