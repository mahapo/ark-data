Air Force General Return to Part 1 To be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 15 of Status Report III, written in June 1982. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IV begins at Earthfiles 021205 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Leonard H. Stringfield: \" Epilogue: The Credentials Factor: Narrowing the Gap On this day, June 1, 1982, as I write the Epilogue for this Status Report III , I must retrogress to say that at times when new, substantive information emerged, I felt I was on the brink of breakthrough. But deep inside, I knew that to even hint of a breakthrough in this status report - no matter how great the source or the testimony - would be too brash of an assumption. Testimony is subject to human interpretive error, to say the least, and testimony alone is not proof. Rest assured, however, I do have my opinions on the subject of UFO Crash/Retrievals and gut feelings about each of my sources. But to borrow a page from scientific rationale, I offer no conclusion. Also, no apologies for withholding the names of my sources and some of their support data. My grounds for not doing so are ethical, legal and, in some instances, a matter of national security. Nonetheless, just for the hell of it, let us suppose that I did resort to perfidy and named some, or all, of my key sources. With the tables turned, I am sure that many in responsible positions would be left with no alternative but to deny their testimony, fearing reprisal and/or invasion of privacy and exploitation by opportunists. Countless others who might come forward never would Without names, I realize that my published works can simply be relegated to hearsay. However, there are other ways to present and keep alive a credible case for UFO Crash/Retrievals. One is found in the following statement written and signed in my presence by researchers of respectful credentials which, I believe, speaks adequately for my endeavor: 'Dear Len ... We want to thank you and Dell (wife) for your hospitality during the March 20-21, 1982, weekend, when you reviewed with us certain documents, letters, tapes and other information from sources claiming some knowledge of UFO crash/retrievals. You also arranged for us to talk with or hear two first-hand claimants and one intermediary. We would like to make the following points, which you may quote in full or part: 1) We affirm that the information you are receiving is substantial and credible, in that much of it emanates from persons in responsible positions, usually present or former military officers or enlisted men with Intelligence or Security units. 2) As you discussed with us, you are aware that any given case could be a hoax or a disinformation ploy by people whose interest is to suppress the truth or confuse the issue. However, we agree that it is extremely unlikely all of the information from so many independent sources over so many years could be a hoax. 3) As you demonstrated to us, you have investigated within the resources available "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"to you background information about the people and events implicated in the crash/retrieval reports, and your intent in publishing the reports is to help prove or disprove them, individually and collectively. 4) We ourselves have provide crash/retrieval leads or other information to you and assisted you in checking facts or details in some cases. 5) We feel that the work you are doing is vitally important and should continue, and that other researchers should support your efforts in every way possible. 6) Some researchers who criticize you underestimate the complexity, time-consuming nature and costliness of trying to elicit information from reluctant and fearful witnesses, many of whom fear reprisals. These critics show a lack of appreciation for the sensitive nature of your investigations and the possible consequences for some of the informants. 7) Finally, we both respect and commend your firmness in refusing to release witnesses names. This appears to us to be the correct, ethical and humane approach under difficult circumstances, and the one most likely to yield significant information. Peter Rank, M. D.
