B. Scott Jones, Former U.S. Naval Intelligence C. B. Scott Jones, former U. S. Naval Intelligence officer; Special Assistant in UFO Research for U. S. Senator Claiborne Pell, 1985-1991; and now Founder, Peace and Emergency Action Coalition for Earth (P.E.A.C.E.). April 21, 2004 Gaithersburg, Maryland - This past weekend at the X-Conference in Gaithersburg, Maryland, the focus was on American government knowledge of an extraterrestrial presence on Earth and the cover-up of that knowledge. There has been a policy of silence and denial about ETs and advanced technologies in the interest of national security since at least the presidency of Harry S. Truman in the 1940s. One of the speakers was C. B. Scott Jones who worked in U. S. Naval Intelligence in the 1960s to 1970s. (See websites below for more background.) Later, from 1985 until 1991, Scott worked as a Special Assistant for U. S. Senator Claiborne Pell, then Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Scott's goal was to find out what other governments and scientists knew about the UFO phenomenon. At the top of his research list were the Soviet Union and China and the implied knowledge of German rocket scientist, Dr. Werner von Braun. Dr. von Braun began his work in the United States after World II under Project Paperclip in which German rocket experts were brought to America to create a space rocket program similar to what they had been doing in Peenemunde, Germany. Their base of operations was White Sands Missile Range near Roswell, New Mexico. The original Project Paperclip Team at Fort Bliss in White Sands, New Mexico, 1940s. Werner von Braun is sixth from right in front row. Photo from Smithsonian Museum. Dr. von Braun served as the first Director of the Marshall Space Flight Center from 1960 to 1970. He was most noted for directing the development of the giant Saturn V rocket that carried men to the moon for the first time in 1969. Scott Jones thinks that Dr. Werner von Braun not only knew about the extraterrestrial presence and rapidly flying discs over their White Sands rocket experiments but that Dr. von Braun seemed to have insider knowledge about how the ET presence might be manipulated and used by the United States government.

Senator Claiborne Pell (January 1985 - March 1991); Founder of the Center for Applied Anomalous Phenomena (1985) and Human Potential Foundation (1989) and Peace and Emergency Action Coalition for Earth (P.E.A.C.E.) (2003): \"We absolutely know that our country, the United States, has a determined policy of secrecy, silence, denial and misinformation on this (UFO phenomenon). So, the big question for me and many others is: Why? ISN'T THAT WHY A FOCUS ON WERNER VON BRAUN, GOING BACK INTO THE 1940S AND PROJECT PAPERCLIP IN THE UNITED STATES IS IMPORTANT, BECAUSE HE SEEMED TO PROVIDE SOME INSIGHTS ABOUT WHY THIS GOVERNMENT MIGHT PERPETUATE A POLICY OF SILENCE ABOUT A SUBJECT THAT HE KNEW FOR A FACT THAT WE WERE DEALING WITH SOMETHING THAT FELL INTO THE NON-HUMAN CATEGORY? Yes, the basis for the Werner Von Braun comment and that's about 20 years ago . This was after he had been in the U.S. a long time and actually was in the twilight of his life he was a dying person. A protege he had selected, Carol Rosen, in an interview has given us this information. He told Carol that he had been in meetings in which the strategy, the corporate strategy, (and it's alleged that it wasn't just his corporation which was Fairchild, but a conglomerate) was this: It is essential to keep the income pump for the military-industrial complex primed and going to make sure that we have adequate enemies. He ticked off to Carol that essentially here is the list. Watch for this. First, the Soviet Union, but that will collapse. Then terrorism and crazies in other countries. Then asteroids. Then extraterrestrials. That's an extraordinary list and I must say that on reflection that everything has been mentioned as a potential enemy or threat by the United States, except extraterrestrials to this point. IN THE WORK THAT YOU DID WITH SENATOR CLAIBORNE PELL WHERE YOU WERE ASSIGNED TO EXPLORE THE WORLD TO FIND OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH RESEARCH IN OTHER GOVERNMENTS' EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND WHATEVER THIS PHENOMENON IS DID YOU FIND THERE WERE OTHER COUNTRIES MAYBE CHINA, RUSSIA, FRANCE WHO WERE READY TO DISCLOSE WHAT THEY KNEW AND THE UNITED STATES WAS THE ONLY OBSTACLE BETWEEN THEIR SAYING TO THE WORLD PUBLIC, 'WE KNOW WE ARE NOT ALONE?'"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"That intrigued me what I ran into. First of all, when I first went into the Soviet Union this was before their bloodless revolution the scientists I dealt with and the research directors knew they were going to have a revolution. And they literally offered me stacks of their classified reports. And we would have huge stacks of their reports over years of their official government involvement and the funding for that came from the Ministry of Defense and their intelligence community, the KGB and the GRU. And they identified their sources of funding to me because they were interested in I think for the obvious reason, first of all, to ascertain: Was this (UFOs) something coming from NATO, from the United States? Were these things that were penetrating their airspace still another threat to their national security and a provocation? I think they very quickly realized that they could determine the difference between a U-2 and Naval aircraft penetrating their borders and then later on other satellite and aircraft when they came online, versus the ETs and the UFOs that came over. What they did not know because I asked them What do you think is the motivation? What is the intent of these intrusions, not only in your country, but around the world? They confessed they had no idea what the intention was. Soviet Phase Array Radar Used to Track UFOs BUT IT UNDERSCORES THAT THIS IS A GLOBAL PHENOMENON, THAT IT IS BEING SEEN BY THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE PLANET IN AN ONGOING BASIS IN EVERY COUNTRY. CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU LEARNED FROM WHAT YOU CALLED THE 'BEAR OF A SCIENTIST' IN RUSSIA? That was interesting. Since I was working for Senator (Claiborne) Pell who was then Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, that gave me entree to places around the world. The title he had given me was 'Special Assistant' and no one ever asked what that really meant, which was fine. But they obviously made their own assumptions as to what the Special Assistant to the Chairman of the U. S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee was. So, perhaps they were over-generous in sharing things, but I certainly appreciated whatever their expectations were. I was frequently used as a messenger boy in every country that I went in because they knew of my relationship with Senator Pell. The Russians less than the Chinese. The Chinese did it repeatedly. If they had a heartburn that they wanted eased, they would say, 'Look, when you get back to Washington, we want you to tell Senator Pell this and let's clean this up or have that stopped or get this going. That was easy for me to say I was glad to do that and that kept the relationship warm and going. I was in the Institute of Theoretical Problems and the Director told me late one afternoon. He said, 'Tomorrow there is going to be something new to the agenda. A very senior scientist, a hero of the Soviet Union, wants to meet with you.' I asked, 'What does he want to meet about?' Now, we had been meeting for two days on the subject of UFOs at that time. He said, 'He will tell you.' When he came in, he was a huge man and when he swept into the room, his presence just took over and people pulled back from him. I held my ground as best I could and he got right up in my face and it was a finger pointing monologue on his part and he was telling me that the anti-ballistic missile treaty that had just been completed was completely unfair and our insistence that the Soviet Union to take down a large phase array radar was not justified. He said, 'This is an important radar. It is technically not in violation.' And I said, 'I can imagine that you are upset as a scientist and I imagine the military is upset because your diplomats gave it away.' And he agreed with that. So I asked him, 'What do you want me to do?' And he said, 'I want you to tell Senator Pell how unfair and how unnecessary and wrong this is.' I did that when I got back to Washington. I told my boss and he said, 'Let's go to the committee (on Foreign Relations). So, I told the Soviet experts on the committee about this and they just shrugged and said they didn't know what he was so mad about. It was some time later, actually I was reviewing my notes. I tried to take notes while I was there because so much was going on and I thought it would be poor form to have a tape recorder. So I would take notes and scribble as I did. So I was reviewing the notes and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"while I had hired a good technical translator, I was confident that he was as good as he was advertised to me, that I had missed it that the translation, either I had missed what he had said. Or the translator had missed something. And I think the message from the hero scientist of the Soviet Union you put it together. He knew where I was and he knew what we had been talking about for two days. UFOS. That's right. So I don't think he came principally to talk about a phase array radar in any other context other than UFOs. And I think what the translation should have been that this radar is important to us the Soviet Union and the United States. And if I had had my wits about me, I should have asked: 'What is the frequency of this radar picking up UFOs?' I think then he would have answered the question. He assumed that I was smart and would figure it out. I think he would have dialogued with me if I had brought that up. ARE WE TRACKING CERTAIN FREQUENCIES THAT WE KNOW ARE LINKED TO VERY SPECIFIC KINDS OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL AERIAL CRAFT? Linda, I don't know technically where we are or not. If in fact they emanate on a frequency spectrum that we can monitor, the answer certainly must be yes. But I suspect there may be frequencies in spectrums we don't recognize. It might be a dimensional thing and I don't think we know how to check for frequencies in this dimension and then shift to another dimension to check for frequencies there. China Waiting for the United States to Make First ET Disclosure WHAT WAS THE MOST PROVOCATIVE INFORMATION THAT YOU RAN INTO IN CHINA? The Chinese can be very direct, bless them for that. They just simply told me it was an outrageous and transparent lie that you come to China and allege that you don't know what your own country is doing in these (UFO) fields. Essentially, how dare you go to our people in the military attaché and our embassy in Washington, D. C., and say you would like to meet senior people in the following academies and institutes who are doing the important research in UFOs and psychic phenomena, unless you have a responsibility and knowledge of what your own country was doing with it. I was never able to convince them that I was not among the anointed and that kept me away from their most senior people who I knew and identified. But they simply would not let me get to them. I guess the important thing with the Chinese came from the Minister of Foreign Affairs. In a casual moment, he lamented how sad he was that the exchange of information between our countries on the subject of UFOs had stopped. I said, 'I am not familiar of that exchange. What are the additional details?' Then I think he realized he should not have said what he did. And he sort of mumbled his way out of it. The reason this is important is I think it has been somewhat validated by the extraordinary 1999 report that came out of France (COMETA - See website link below) in which they say in one part of the report that there is an allegation that there is a special relationship between the United States and whatever this phenomenon is. The Chinese told me over and over again of the amount of evidence they have from which they conclude that the ET phenomenon is real, in the sense that there are real tangible craft penetrating their airspace. That issue is essentially settled with them. I said, 'This being the case, why don't you make a public announcement and tell the world about this reality?' And there was a short silence and he said, 'China will be a quick second after the United States makes the announcement.' That again suggests there is a belief or understanding that the responsibility for the first announcement comes from the United States. And I don't understand this, Linda. I do not know what the basis of this is.\" Using Remote Viewing to Investigate Tunguska Aerial Explosion of June 30, 1908"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"In his efforts to get more truth about the UFO puzzle, Scott Jones hired a remote viewing group that had originally trained in a classified Defense Intelligence program and later sold remote viewing as as an investigative tool in the civilian world. Scott wanted to learn more about the June 30, 1908 explosion above the ground in Tunguska, Siberia, Russia that incinerated trees in an 18-mile diameter circle around ground zero. Whatever blew up was so strong that beyond the 18 mile burned circle, thousands of trees were knocked down over a 25 mile radius. If the explosion had occurred over a populated city, the effect would have been catastrophic for all the people living there. To date, the most common hypothesis has been that a large meteorite blew up above Tunguska in 1908. But when Scott Jones had the remote viewers, lead by Ed Dames, concentrate on the historic event, they got a different answer. Thousands of trees burned and knocked down in a 50-mile-diameter circle in Tunguska, Siberia, Russia, on June 30, 1908. Something exploded 5 miles (8 kilometers) above the river Stony Tunguska, destroying about 2150 square kilometers of Siberian taigà. Still today, it is not clear whether it was a comet or an asteroid or something else. Photograph from Smithsonian Museum. Scott Jones: \"Three out of five remote viewers came up with UFOs, a ship in trouble. There was an explosion perhaps the demise of a ship having real technical difficulties. Now I am beginning to seriously consider that the ships observed in the Roswell event that they were a time travel vehicle. I don't have the physics background to make an argument for this. To me, it would make a huge difference in the exploitation from whatever was garnered from (Roswell), if you start out that this is a time traveling vehicle, rather than this is from a ship that somehow got here and these pieces of hardware, we will independently exploit and see what we can learn from them. If you put it in a different context and say this is part of a time travel vehicle, what else can we learn from the same things that have been exploited already? COULD WE IN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT LEARN HOW TO OPERATE THAT TECHNOLOGY AND LITERALLY GO BACKWARDS OR FORWARDS IN TIME? I don't know if it is bi-directional or not. I think I heard at this conference it is only back in time. If that's the case, then the travelers that are coming here are coming from our future. And of course, that brings a great potential. If it is a future in all areas, they are more technologically advanced, more psychologically, emotionally and spiritually advanced, then they truly have some gifts to share with us.\" Websites: http://www.pea ceroom.com/PEACEAdvisor.htm http://www.cufos.org/cometa.html http://www.paradigmclock.com/X-Conf erence/jones_supplement.htm http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4201/ch1-3.htm"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
