C. Levengood Lab Report L eft: “Boomerang” version of mysterious aerial object that morphed into middle pink-colored disc. Right: The pink disc then flashed three oval, white lights on its bottom surface and “little squares of light” dropped like snow onto apartment yard and privet bush. Half a dozen sightings April through July 2008, Levittown, Pennsylvania. Image and drawings by resident and eyewitness. P rivet bush about 15 feet high grows next to eyewitness's apartment back door in Levittown, Pennsylvania, where “little squares of light” first fell on June 12, 2008 - and two more times in July 2008 - from a pink-colored aerial disc and surrounded the privet bush and a silver maple tree about 65 feet away.
