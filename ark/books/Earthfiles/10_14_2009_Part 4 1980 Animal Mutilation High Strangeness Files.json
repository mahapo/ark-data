F rom Fort Collins to Briggsdale to Sterling, Colorado, the red dots on the map include some of the ranching communities where animal mutilations were reported repeatedly in the 1970s and 1980s. August 26, 1980 - Ranch of Bill Speaker, 15 miles southeast of Briggsdale, Weld County, Colorado: In grassland pasture 8 miles east and 7.5 miles south of Highway 14, Mrs. Speaker found a 600-pound yearling steer dead and mutilated. He had been dead less than 24 hours because Bill Speaker had seen the steer alive the day before. a) Right ear had been cut off at the skull bone. b) Right cheek was stripped to the bone, \"as if the bone had been lying in the sun for months,\" Bill Speaker told me. c) A pear-shaped pattern of hide was removed above the right eye, over right ear and back to right shoulder. Hide excised neatly, leaving lumen and muscle tissue below intact. But Mr. Speaker said that blood was oozing up through the muscle tissue and he wondered two things: First, if predators had done this, why didn't they take any meat? Second, if predators had torn the hide off, why didn't the hide show blood? Mr. Speaker told me that the pear-shaped hide removal looked like it had all been removed in one big piece. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"d) The front of the nose and lips were still there, but an approximate 2-inch-long piece of skin had been peeled away from the steer's lower lip. e) Mr. Speaker did not look in the mouth to see if the tongue was there. f) Rectum was not touched. g) Tail was in place as far as he can remember. h) There were a lot of cow tracks around the steer as if they had milled around the body and kicked up the dirt, but no other tracks and no signs of death struggle from animal. Mr. Speaker is 54-years-old and was born and raise in ranch life. When I asked him to compare this kill with predator damage, he said, \"Mostly when something dies, the coyotes start on the rectum and hollow the body inward. They normally make a hole big enough to crawl inside and eat the inner parts. They don't start with ears. I've never seen an animal peeled bloodlessly like this one. Predators never touched this animal, not once. I was out there five days after finding the steer and not a thing had touched it. Some way whatever is killing the cows is doing it without any struggle. It's like the cows fall over dead and the skin falls off!\" this was the only mutilation that he is certain he's had. Other cow deaths in the past have bloated so much that Mr. Speaker thought maybe the cows had split open and made holes. But he's not sure what happened. His neighbor, John Baumgartner lives only three-quarters of a mile from the steer mutilation site, but the steer was on the other side of a knoll that blocked Baumgartner's view and he said he never saw or heard anything unusual. September 1980 September 2, 1980 - Eagle Rock Ranch run by Jessie Frazier 10 to 15 miles north of Briggsdale: Upside down bull without eyes. And reporter Bill Jackson's wife saw a bright, white light low in the sky from their house window in Sterling. Then the light \"blinked out.\" That morning, Jessie Frazier rode up to the chalk bluffs about 3 to 4 miles south of the Wyoming border and 16 miles west of Hereford to separate out the last remaining bull in his heard of cows pastured in 6the bluffs. He only leaves bulls with the cows for 60 days. Jessie found the 6-year-old bull lying about 35 feet off a 4-wheel-drive road. The bull was lying flat on its back. The head was straight up and the horns were embedded in the ground. \"I never found any animal like that ever before,\" Jessie told me. The freshness of the bull's body indicated it had not been dead longer than September 1st or August 31st. There was no sign of any struggle or tracks of any kind in the soft sand where the bull was lying on its back with its horns in the dirt. \"Usually we see signs of death struggle. That bull should at least have thrown that head of his and those horns would have dug up the ground. But there was no sign of anything. It's as if that bull was laid down there already dead.\" a) Both eyeballs were removed. Little trickles of blood from both eyes ran down toward the throat and brisket instead of toward horns, indicating that the eyeballs had to have been removed when the bull was in an upright position. b) The tongue had been removed, \"as if you had pulled it out as far as you could and cut it off. Cut looked straight up and down, smooth, not jagged.\" c) Testicle and penis removed (and there is similarity here to the Gastonia, North Carolina case where horse's penis was somehow specifically removed from horse's sheath and abdomen while penned in a horse stall.) The bull's foreskin and hide were still there, but the penis was missing. Jessie Frazier could not see anything up in the foreskin hole. Also, on a bull, there is usually some long hair at the penis, but on Jessie's bull, it was cut or shaved"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"shorter, straight across. d) Rectum was normal and tail was there. So were both ears intact. e) Frazier never rolled the bull over, but he did check the bull's legs to look for rope burns or hair rubbed off where the big animal might have been lifted up by something, but the hair was normal. f) No predator activity around the bull that was still untouched, except for some maggots and flies, when a deputy from the Weld County, Colorado, Sheriff's office visited the site late the afternoon of September 2, 1980. The bull was the deputy's first animal mutilation investigation and he took a lot of photographs, but did not say much to Jessie Frazier. Jessie never heard another word from the Weld County Sheriff's office about the mutilated bull. Frazier's boss, Virgil Prewett of Cherokee, Oklahoma, called the Sheriff's office and talked to someone there for a long time, but no answers. Prewett felt blown off by the Sheriff's office and that really upset both him and Frazier. Frazier said that a lot of helicopters were flying around from the Cheyenne, Wyoming AFB and that a lot of chopper night missions go on over his ranch. Interesting comparison between Frazier's bull mutilation and predator attack. A week after Jessie found his bull dead, one of his cows died a natural death. The next day, the coyotes had torn into her down to the bone. But coyotes never did touch the bull's body. Jessie also had coyotes attack one of his calves once while it was still alive and the coyotes chewed into the young animal's rectum. There was blood all over the place, Frazier told me, but there wasn't a drop of blood anywhere on the bull except for the small trickles from both eyes. [ NOTE: There was also a strange trickle from the Robert Blake horse in Colorado Springs that showed up only under black light. With the black light off, nothing showed on the horse's hair.] September 5, 1980 - Hereford, Colorado, 4:30 AM: Two ladies traveling around 4:30 AM near Hereford, Colorado, saw red and green lights about 1/2 mile east of town or about 10 miles NW of Grover and they were \"really scared.\" They called the Weld County Sheriff's office. A Sheriff's deputy saw the lights from 14 miles away and contacted nearby AF near Cheyenne, but the air force said there was nothing on radar. Another Grover, Colorado incident happened in 1976. A farmer was out in his wheat field at night and was scared so much by something that went over him in the sky that the farmer hid under a tractor and won't go back in that field at night ever again. September 13, 1980 - Granger, Polk County, Iowa: Calf \"shot and mutilated.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"D esMoines Register, Saturday, September 13, 1980, Des Moines, Iowa. The problem with alleged bullet holes is my own firsthand experience at the Bateman ranch in Colorado (next case). I met the deputy and rancher in the field where the mutilated heifer was and watched the deputy stick a pencil from his pocket down into a dry, bloodless, quarter-inch-wide by about 2-inch-deep hole in the right side of the heifer's neck near the shoulder. We all could see that the pencil did not go in the hole very far. And yet, the deputy said it \"probably was a bullet hole\" and a local newspaper wrote up the mutilation as a gun shot death without ever reporting the truth, which was that no bullet was ever found. September 16, 1980 - Loveland, Colorado, Ken and Wilma Bateman's Ken-Wil Ranch, mutilated Angus heifer: On September 16, 1980, while at work in my office at KMGH-TV, Channel 7, the news room received a teletype message: MUTILATION (LOVELAND) -- AN ANGUS HEIFER HAS BEEN DISCOVERED M UTI LATED O N A RANCH WEST O F LO VELAND, AND THE RANCH'S OWNER SAYS HE'S WORRIED. OWNER KENNETH BATEMAN SAYS HE FOUND THE HEIFER ON A ROCK LEDGE THAT MOST VEHICLES COULDN'T GET TO. AFTER FINDING THE REMAINS ON SUNDAY, BATEMAN REPORTED THE MUTILATION TO THE LARIMER COUNTY, COLORADO SHERIFF'S OFFICE, AND DEPUTY TOM REITZ SAID IN A SUBSEQUENT REPORT THAT THE HEIFER HAD DIED OF AN UNKNOWN CAUSE - \"POSSIBLY A GUNSHOT\" -- AND THAT A REAR SECTION OF THE ANIMAL HAD BEEN REMOVED. - - - DASH - - BATEMAN SAYS HE GUESSES THE HEIFER DIED SOMETIME EARLY LAST WEEK. ACCORDING TO BATEMAN, THERE WAS A SMALL PERFORATION IN THE SHOULDER OF THE COW, BUT NO BLOOD OR ANIMAL TRACKS ANYWHERE IN THE AREA. HE ESTIMATED THAT AN 11-INCH HOLE HAD BEEN CUT IN THE REAR PARTS OF THE HEIFER. BATEMAN REPORTED THAT COYOTES, MAGPIES AND OTHER SCAVENGERS ARE PLENTIFUL IN THE AREA, BUT HE SAYS, \"THIS IS WEIRD. THE ANIMALS WON'T TO UCH HER. \" KMGH news reporter Dan Dennison asked me to fly with him in the Channel 7"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"helicopter to the Bateman ranch in Loveland located not far south of the intersection of Highways 34 and 29. We flew to the mutilation site over a hill from the Bateman ranch house, about 4 miles SW of Big Thompson Canyon. Ken Bateman has 42 head of cows in the particular grazing pasture where his heifer was found dead and mutilated. The pasture is fenced and locked at two gates. Ken checks on them three to four times a week. The cattle there eat native mountain grass supplemented by hay that Ken delivers to them. First thing Ken Bateman told us was that a man named Dave Lorenz was fishing in Pine Wood Resort west of the mutilation site when Lorenz heard cattle bellowing and thought he heard a cow or calf in distress where the Angus heifer was found dead and mutilated. Lorenz said he saw three orange lights in the pasture area. Ken Bateman also had a heifer disappear two weeks ago and has not been able to find it. Each young animal was worth about $1,000 because each was artificially inseminated from top bulls to produce the Angus heifers. Ken Bateman has been ranching his Loveland spread since 1976 and has never had a mutilation before. Ken knew the Angus heifer was alive on September 8, 1980, because he had cattle buyers in and this heifer was considered in the top 5% to 10% of his heifers. The heifer was discovered dead on September 11, three days later, by Ron Hill, foreman on a neighboring ranch. Ron Hill only saw the heifer's body from a distance, did not know it was mutilated, but called Bateman about it Thursday evening, September 11. Ken Bateman got to the carcass on Saturday morning, September 13, 1980. Scene description: All black Angus heifer lying about 50 feet from a canal and about 5 feet from a small, 2-foot-wide spring running across the pasture. She was lying on a slant with her head down hill. Her whole tail was cut off at the tail bone. No blood anywhere. Ken said the rectum was cored out in a \"perfectly round hole\" 10 to 12 inches wide that went deep inside revealing also that the heifer's sex organs had been removed. There was a puncture wound in her left shoulder about 1/4\" wide and about 2 inches deep. The calf was lying on her right side and in this case unlike most animal mutilations, her ears, eyes and tongue were all there. On the ground about 6 to 8 feet from the heifer's body, Ken found two patches of the heifer's hair. There were no other cuts, tears or signs of natural predators around. \"To our knowledge, no predators touched her,\" said Ken Bateman. There was a bush flattened about 12 feet from the animal's back. The lowest branches of the flattened bush appeared very black, as if charred. The next day on Sunday, September 14, 1980, Larimer County Sheriff Jim Black in Fort Collins asked his deputy, Mike Blanchard, to investigate. Sheriff Black also sent out three Colorado State University pathology students to look at the heifer's dead and mutilated body. The deputy thought the bush was black simply from age? The students said it was predator and the deputy said the shoulder wound was \"probably a bullet,\" and officially summarized the case as prankster and/or predator damage. But Ken turned the heifer over to see if a bullet or arrow had gone through her, but there was no sign of an exit hole or puncture. Further, on Tuesday, September 16, that evening Ken Bateman opened up the dead heifer's shoulder puncture before he and his son buried the calf. They found no muscle damage underneath, only the 2-inch puncture hole, and no mark of any kind on the underlying bone. So, there was definitely no bullet, regardless of the perfunctory pronouncement by the deputy. This Angus heifer weighed 450 pounds, was still nursing her mother and Bateman thought it very unusual that the heifer could be separated from the mother. The heifer calf was found in a rocky area that the other cows, including the calf's mother, would not go near after the calf died there. The mother cow bawled from a distance, but would not go near her calf. September 16, 1980 - Roland Ball ranch 5 miles west of Briggsdale, Weld County, Colorado: Same day I flew up to Loveland to see the Ken Bateman heifer, Roland Ball found two of his 350 to 400 pound steer calves dead and mutilated. On that Tuesday, Roland and his 20-year-old son were riding in their Pawnee grass pasture about 4 miles west and 1.5 miles north of Briggsdale. Father and son had been rounding up cows to move to another pasture because"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"of a government-mandate by the Crow Valley Livestock Association to rotate animals. About 3/4 of a mile off the road, Roland discovered the first calf that he estimated had been dead two days. His son found a second calf about 1.5 miles further west in a straight line that they estimated had been dead about 5 days and was much further deteriorated than the calf Roland found. The rancher estimated that calf had been dead for at least five days based on deterioration, but there was no bloat. One ear had been cut out deep into the skull, the tail had been cut off at the tailbone and hide had been removed from a back ankle. Strangely, all the tendons beneath the hide were untouched. That confused Roland Ball because if it had been a normal predator bite, there would have been evidence of torn tendons. In the furthest east and freshest mutilated calf: a) Tongue was cut in a straight, up and down cut where the tongue is thickest in back of throat. b) \"Perfect 4-inch circle\" cut out of belly, including naval. Only hide was taken; no muscle issue was touched. There were not even flies or maggots and no predators had touched the carcass. c) No blood anywhere on animal or ground. d) The 4-inch circle of hide excised from the belly did not change color as it got older, as normal cow tissue would. Weld County Sheriff Andrews cut out a portion of the circle toward the rear legs for analysis and the next day his cut had turned brown. But the mutilator's circle remained whitish-pink. \"When a critter is skinned, the muscle tissue underneath the hide is more white than red or pink,\" Roland told me. e) On the back of the neck at the left of the spine, the sheriff found two holes about 2 inches apart and as wide as \"a lead pencil, about 1/4-inch.\" Sheriff Andrews specifically looked for small puncture holes after hearing about the Ken Bateman heifer having a small hole in her left shoulder. f) There was liquid on the ground close along the calf's belly in the grass that was blood red, but thinner than blood, and it did not evaporate and did not soak into the ground. Both Sheriff Andrews and Iona Hoeppner, a science teacher at local Briggsdale High School, took liquid samples for analysis. g) Some flesh was gone from the rectum, but not as smooth as other mutilations. \"You might have thought it was predator ate there, but no predator ever touched that calf,\" insisted Roland. h) The tail switch hair was removed and scattered around the calf some distance away. The tail itself was not cut. i) The calf's eyes were intact, but Mrs. Hoeppner cut both eyeballs out for study because \"they were drying up like a prune\" and she thought they should have stayed whole longer. She took her lab samples on Thursday, September 18, two days after the calves were discovered. j) \"There was no bloat at all.\" k) There were no signs of disturbance in the grass around the calf. IMPORTANT NOTE: On Thursday night, in the dark, the Balls took Iona Hoeppner out to the pasture to take samples from the freshest calf. Mrs. Hoeppner took samples from eyes, skin and fluid samples from the red liquid on the ground and went immediately to her high school lab to analyze. She worked at the school lab until about midnight, locked the lab and went home."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Iona Hoeppner told me, \"During the night, someone with a key or lock pick got into the lab, ransacked it, took every mutilated calf sample and some formalin preservation fluid. They knew what they were looking for.\" The school superintendent did not want anyone to know what happened and to this day, only the authorities and the Balls and I have been told.
