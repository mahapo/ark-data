May 17, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Twenty-three years ago, under orders of President Ronald Reagan, American helicopters landed at Pearls Airport in northeastern Grenada at 5 o'clock in the morning on October 25, 1983. Fidel Castro’s Cuban People's Revolutionary Army fired at the U. S. Marines with small a r ms a nd ma c hi ne guns . "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"U .S. Army Rangers parachuted from the low altitude of 500 feet to try to avoid anti-aircraft fire as they invaded Grenada during Operation Urgent Fury. To the southwest in Point Salines, Army Rangers parachuted low from 500 feet onto that airfield around sunrise and were attacked by heavy anti-aircraft fire. The Marines and Rangers, backed by Navy ships, would prevail over the Cuban revolutionaries and their Soviet weapons. But even before the shooting began, the Rangers had evacuated American students from the St. George's Medical Center who were later flown by a huge C-141 transport plane back to the United States. The Grenada invasion by U. S. Army and Marines from October 23 to November 21, 1983, had allegedly been requested by six neighbor islands that were nervous. Government authorities on Antigua, Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Jamaica and Barbados wanted President Ronald Reagan's help because Castro was building a long runway on Grenada for military operations. U. S. officials were afraid that the nearly 10,000-foot-long airport would be big enough to land long-range Soviet bombers. From there, Castro and his Soviet allies could work into Central and South America. U. S. News & World Report said in its November 7, 1983, edition: \"Secrecy surrounding the operation was almost total. While congressional leaders were informed on the eve of the mission, they were not told when it would be launched and were not asked to approve the mission. Not even the White House press office was informed. Reporters were not permitted to accompany U. S. forces to Grenada, and those already there were quickly ordered out. Journalists were allowed on the island only on the third day.\" A month later, the American invasion of Grenada was over on November 21, 1983. Official casualty totals were 19 dead U. S. soldiers and 116 wounded; 29 dead Cuban soldiers; and 49 Grenada residents dead, along with several hundred wounded. Now I have a military source who says more was happening during that Grenada invasion than anyone knew then - or now. There was a Top Secret UFO crash/retrieval covered up by the Top Secret invasion. The location was in the northeast near the Pearls Airport. Dwayne Britnell - now 58-years-old - was drafted into the U. S. Army in January 1969, where he worked for twenty-three years until his retirement on September 1st, 1992. During the October 1983 Grenada invasion, Dwayne was a staff officer of the 1st Core Support Command (COSCOM) at Ft. Bragg, North Carolina, working in Security Operations Training and Intelligence. COSCOM was a 5,000-man unit that supported the 18th Airborne Corps and Ft. Bragg. When the secret invasion began, Dwayne was on 12-hour shifts helping to coordinate getting troops, supplies and equipment to Grenada. Interview: Dwayne Britne ll, Se curity O ffice r, Me dical Company, Albuque rque , Ne w Me xico, and Re tire d U. S. Army Staff Officer (1969-1992): \"Our job was to occupy and defend Point Salines, which was the airstrip on the southwestern tip of the island. WHAT WERE YOU TOLD WAS THE REASON FOR THE OPERATION IN GRENADA? I was told, of course, that it was political. Everything in the news at that time was that we were protecting some college students that were American on the island. But, of course, that was a smokescreen because the REAL reason was that our intelligence picked up that the Cubans were expanding the runway so that the Russian military aircraft could land there and bring nuclear missiles within a range of continental U. S. Of course, Pres. Reagan said, ‘No, that’s a no go. Put a stop to it.’ So, that’s why we invaded and killed the Cubans. WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU LEARNED LATER ON AND HOW DID YOU LEARN THAT YET EVEN ANOTHER SECRET WAS BEING COVERED UP IN THE GRENADA OPERATION? If you look at the map, there are visibly two airstrips on the island of Grenada. One on the northeast side. Then Pt. Salines on the southwestern side. I can verify that from my experience in running the operation, that the northern airstrip had been declared a No Fly zone. I never could figure it out and I kind of blew it off until later this kid that was in the USAF told me the story of what was going on and what transpired in extracting a UFO off of the island. CAN YOU TELL US WHAT HE TOLD YOU? Let me give you a little background. The runway was so short at Pt. Salines that everything we flew down there, we flew – and I can verify that because I went to many staff meetings. We flew everything, most everything, by C-141s to the island of Barbados. We have a USAF base there and that’s where the young man, the young airman told me the story when he was stationed there at the air base. Everything was flown into Barbados and offloaded from the C-141s and re-figured for C-130 transport because they were the only ones that could land safely at the short runway at Pt. Salines."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" My wife knew his wife through the base veterinarian office and they were visiting our house one Sunday afternoon. Then he told me the story of what actually happened that he personally witnessed. WHICH WAS? He said a C-5A flew onto the airstrip at Barbados and it was piloted by a USAF one-star General and crew. They got off and the General said, “I need two volunteers for the night. My crew and I have to take crew rest and I want one inside the aircraft and one outside walking around the aircraft to secure it overnight.’ So, he (young airman) said he was assigned the inside duties and having flown on a C-5A from Korea in my career, I know how it’s configured. Everything he told me matched up. All the passengers w ere in the rear of the plane facing backwards and there is a huge long ladder that goes down to the flooring down in the aircraft. So, he said in the middle of the night he got curious as to what the cargo was and he started down the ladder with his flashlight and that’s when he saw it. He said, ‘That’s the god-awfullest thing I’d ever seen in my life!’ Obviously, it scared him on many levels. But it was probably overgrown with growth having been in the jungle up there on that airstrip for so long. He – I don’t know how to put this (laughs). Basically, he said he wet his pants and went back up into the passenger compartment. Bell-Shaped UFO Covered with Jungle Vines But he drew a map on my dining room table – not a map, but a sketch – of this craft. Of course, he didn’t approach it. He was too scared once he realized what it was. He didn’t know what was in it and I don’t either, whether there were actual alien bodies or anything like that. I really don’t know. G reen lines indicate the vines still clinging all over the top or bell-shaped UFO after the USAF and Marine troops cut it out of the Grenada jungle on the northeastern end of the island near P earls Airport and Tivoli. The craft was loaded aboard a C-5A for transport to Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, after one crew rest stop in Barbados. Government insiders have said this type of craft is linked to the blond humanoids referred to as \"Nordics,\" different from the grey EBEs (extraterrestrial biological entities) and another group described as \"standing up lizards.\" Drawing © 2006 for Earthfiles by Dwayne Britnell. However, the way the story went, the next morning the General came out and relieved him and they took off to Wright-Patterson AFB. My knowledge of why they chose a C-5A is because a C-5A is known for its capability of short takeoffs and landings. Of course, that airstrip was very short. I also verified with a buddy of mine that I had know n in the Army who was a pilot and he fought in a helicopter. I called him a couple of years ago and he verified that the terrain up on that northeast (part of Grenada), the cliffs several hundred feet of drop-off in solid rock. There was a V in the rock that you had to go through to drop down so it would be very difficult to get an aircraft to land on that Pt. Salines airstrip. But he said the natives had dug out bunkers in the side of that rock to defend the airstrip and it might explain that they either shot (the UFO) down or it was just disabled and landed there. AND IT WOULD FIT INTO A C-5A? Oh, yeah. It obviously – C-5s are huge now! But this obviously was not what is termed a ‘mother ship,’ but a smaller craft. He said it fit in there fine.

Source: Military Analysis Network. Another comment he made was that prior to coming to Pope AFB, that he was stationed up at Wright-Patterson AFB and he knew for a fact up there that there are two runways and that one of them is never used for traffic. Off to the side, there is a huge building environmentally controlled – it has all the air conditioners and stuff out on top – which makes sense to house bodies or... And I also got that verified on a TV show on the Sci Fi Channel that there were scientists who worked off base. They had a tunnel and went up elevators up into that facility on Wright-Patterson AFB. DID THEY HAVE TO USE MACHETES? OR WHAT DID THEY USE TO CHOP THIS DISC OUT OF THE JUNGLE? A combination of cranes or forklifts and probably they carried some MAG-handling equipment capable of lifting it and putting it in the cargo plane. Probably carried it down with them and maybe the aircrew loaded it up. Or they got units on the ground to assist. He was a young airman, Air Force security police on the island of Barbados. So, he wasn’t there when they loaded it. He was only there to secure it on Barbados when they took crew rest. SO, THEY FLEW FROM GRENADA TO BARBADOS? Right. THEN THEY WENT ON TO WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB? Right. SO, HE NEVER SAW IT IN THE JUNGLE? No. WHAT WAS IT THAT HE WAS AFRAID OF? The reason I said that is he drew on the sketch he drew for me, he drew vines all over it as if they didn’t bother to take the vines off and just cut them away and picked it up. It was disk on the bottom and kind of went up into a point at the top, kind of a top. You know those tops that you spin? A spinning top. That’s pretty much the shape of it. HE DREW IT WITH THE VINES FROM NORTHERN GRENADA ALL OVER IT AS IF THEY HAD CHOPPED IT OUT AND THEN LOADED IT ON THE C-5A TO GO BACK TO WRIGHT-PATTERSON AFB WITHOUT TAKING ANY OF THE VINES OFF? Right. Now an interesting point, one time the Prime Minister of Grenada, through the United Nations, had made a call for open and public investigation and that the international community ousted him from his position. They forced him out because he wanted to go public with – probably that fit together with his prior knowledge of the physical presence of a UFO on his island. He knew that they existed and so he wanted to get other people to help and participate. DID YOUR AIR FORCE SOURCE SAY ANY OF HIS SUPERIOR OFFICERS OR ANYONE ELSE TALKED ABOUT OUR GOVERNMENT, OR SOME GOVERNMENT, SHOOTING THIS DISC DOWN ON GRENADA? No. It was kind of a closed thing. I’m sure the General told him, as most people are told, ‘Hey, you didn’t see anything in here, you understand? If you want a career in the Air Force, you never say anything about this.’ No telling how long that thing had been there prior to our invasion of the island. I have no idea how old it was, or how long it had been there. My only suggestion was because it was overgrown with vines, that it had been there for quite some time. DID YOUR SOURCE EVER GET ANY MORE INFORMATION FROM ANY WORK IN RELATIONSHIP TO WHAT WRIGHT-PATTERSON FOUND? No. No. We were six months after the operation had ended and he went his way and I went mine. Finding sources like that are few and far between. IT’S AMAZING, ISN’T IT, TO CONTEMPLATE WHAT SIZE OF UNDERGROUND INSTALLATION, OR BUILDING INSTALLATION, THAT WRIGHT-PATTERSON WOULD HAVE TO HAVE OVER THE LAST 60 YEARS TO ACCOMMODATE ALL OF THE CRAFT THAT HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED BY"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE PEOPLE AS HAVING BEEN TRANSFERRED THERE? Oh, absolutely! And not only from my source, the young airman. He said it w as a humongous building. But I also got from these civilians that it was multi-storied underground and that they went by a hallway or railway under it and then had elevators up and down to go to the various floors and to the top. So, yeah! I can only imagine how huge that facility is. WHAT DO YOU PERSONALLY THINK FROM A LONG 23 YEAR ARMY MILITARY CAREER ABOUT THIS GOVERNMENT’S POLICY OF COMPLETE DENIAL ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES THAT THEY KNOW ABOUT, BUT MAINTAIN A POLICY OF DENIAL IN THE INTEREST OF NATIONAL SECURITY? They think they are protecting the American public because my – the comment, if the people knew what was going on, people would be jumping off of buildings. WHY? Out of fear. There are three fears: fear of death, fear of the unknown and fear of change. The validity of spacecraft and aliens in our environment would be all of those things, create the fear of all three. I think they think they are protecting the American people and the world by keeping it a secret.\" More Information: I f any Earthfiles or Dreamland viewers and listeners have had any similar experience, please contact me at: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
