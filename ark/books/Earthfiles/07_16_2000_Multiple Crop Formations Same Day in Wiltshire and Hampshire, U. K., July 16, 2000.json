K., July 16, 2000 © 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe East of Corhampton near Petersfield, Hampshire, reported on July 15, 2000. Aerial Photograph © 2000 by Busty Taylor. July 16, 2000 Wiltshire, England - In the past week, there have been nearly a dozen formations in southern England and five of them emerged between July 15 to 16. Charles Mallett and his wife, Frances, have been studying, photographing and drawing crop formations in England for some time and produce a great web secton at the cropcircleconnector.com called C& F Phenomenon. I talked with Charles this afternoon about what happened this weekend. Interview: Charles Mallett, C & F Phenomenon, Horton, Wiltshire, England: \"Across into Hampshire, not far from here about an hour's drive, we had two beautiful formations discovered today. One is so complicated I'm having a hard time describing even with a picture in front of me. It's about 300 foot diameter essentially made up of dozens of rings, interlocking, half standing and half downed. It's a picture of opposites. I strongly recommend people look at www.cropcircleconnector.com web site. They will be impressed. This is an approximate 300 feet formation consisting of multiple standing and downed sections. All the downed sections are essentially replicated by opposite standing sections, so it's a yin/yang, left and right, positive and negative, very well balanced and executed.

It's extremely hard to describe. I've never seen anything quite like this. It projects in one direction. It does come out of the ground some what if you look at it and squint. I can't fathom how this could have been constructed on the ground. I could imagine standing in this thing you would have absolutely no idea what you were within at all. The construction is amazing. Some of the lines are incredibly thin, thinner than the actual tramlines that run through the field. And it's partner that arrived the same day today is fairly similar by in an embryonic fashion of the same thing. It's extremely thin lines. To look at the aerial shot - this was too far to travel so I haven't looked at the actual location but the aerial shot, some of the paths are inches wide only which for me rules out hoaxing ideas. You can't really walk through a crop field without causing severe d amage. CHARLES, HOW COULD A FEW INCHES BE DONE? IT CAN'T BE DONE ON THE GROUND. Sure. We've seen, not this year, but in previous years we have seen paths going around the main formation in oilseed rape one stalk wide. That's about 1 1/4 inches wide. One large perfect circle in a field. It's beyond physical execution by human hands. It just takes some common sense to look at the image really. THIS PARTNER, THIS EMBRYONIC ONE? It's not the same pattern. It just has a similar feel about it. It's essentially a ring surrounded by concentric rings interlocking, fairly geometrical. It just looks related to its more spectacular big sister. One of the other ones that happened came down last night, or this morning, next to Avebury, a high profile location for crop circles. It's a huge formation right next to the Avenue of Standing Stones. This is an approximately 300 foot formation. Incredible. I've never known it this busy. Essentially it's a 250 to 300 foot cleanly cut formation and I think it's some kind of nuclear type or symbolic design, a motif of some kind. THAT MEANS, CHARLES, THIS MORNING ALONE, THERE WAS A LONG 300 FOOT PICTOGRAM AT AVEBURY; THERE IS THE BEAUTIFUL FLOWER AT PICKED HILL AND THE TWO AT HAMPSHIRE."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Five formations in one night is incredible. We're wondering what's going on. It's very odd. At the start of the season, nothing was really happening. We were getting one fairly mediocre formation a week at best. Now, we're getting like every night. We're averaging two or three a night. Last night was a bit intense. I hope it doesn't continue that much. IT'S AS IF SOMETHING IS RAISING THE LEVEL AGAIN. Yes, the fifth formation is an event harks back to the Basket formation that was cut last year. We had another one a few days ago in Alton Barnes, a 100 foot circle with the floor entirely woven and spun and laid down in a flat type manner. SOME PEOPLE ARE CALLING IT A 'TRISCUIT,' THAT ONE FROM ADAMS GRAVE NEAR ALTON BARNES (FOUND JULY 12TH). Right. Well, the fifth one last night was at Furz Hill, also near Alton Barnes. This is the real hub of activity. It's a major hot spot. It's about 150 foot ring and inside the ring is a standing section with about 8 to 10 smaller circles which appear to make up some kind of pattern. I don't know what. It almost looks like a star chart almost. But the actual flattened area of the ring is again woven in a four directional flow. It's been swirled down clockwise or anti-clockwise. Wherever you stand, you see wheat going in four different directions interwoven like a basket basically. Very impressive. The geographical spread of these formations has been more spread out around southern England this year, quality formations. Normally we get the major event here around Avebury and Alton Barnes area and then they sort of thin out as they go across southern England. This year, though, we've had a lot hundreds of miles across southern England. A lot of them aren't even getting photographed because no one flies anywhere and takes pictures of crop circles except for this area. But there has been a lot way, way up north, hundreds of miles away and good quality formations, too. So, they do seem to be spreading out some what unless it's just a quirky glitch this year. WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE BBC AND OTHER MEDIA IN ENGLAND ON THIS EXTRAORDINARY FLURRY OF OUTSTANDING FORMATIONS? As far as TV goes, BBC in particular, all they are interested in is the hoax idea. They regularly get or hire people from London whom I'm very familiar with to get them to make fairly basic formations. Essentially they are involved in, I believe, a misinformation campaign. To put this hoaxing idea into some kind of context, myself and my partner sat on the side of a hill, watched the BBC and a team of people, about six people, make a corn circle. It took them a good many hours, four or five hours, to make a fairly non-elaborate pattern: a bunch of circles arranged in a large circle with diminishing sized circles coming off the perimeter. From a distance, it looked fairly impressive about 200 feet away. It took them more hours to do it than you get in darkness in the night. The nights here are very short this time of year. THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK THAT AMERICAN AUDIENCES FORGET THAT IN THE ISLANDS OF THE BRITISH ISLES, AT THIS TIME IN THE SUMMER, THE SUN IS STILL PRETTY BRIGHT AT 9 O'CLOCK. IT'S STILL TWILIGHT AT 10ish, AND THE SUN IS UP BY 4:30 TO 5 AM. Right. This time of year, we get four hours of darkness. Apart from those four hours of good quality blackness, you can see into fields. It took the BBC team of people approximately four to five hours to make a fairly rudimentary formation."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The moment they finished it, we walked into it to examine it. That's what we do. We want to experience what their capabilities are. And what we were looking at on the ground was stamped down corn, smashed to the floor. No coherence to the way it's laid. No waves in the corn, no fluidity, no banks up on the corner where the whatever it is has whipped around the corners. It was entirely inconsistent with what we see in at least 90% of crop circles we examine. Some times all you need to do is see an aerial image. I mean that should be enough to make anybody think. A thousand foot long fractal consisting of 200 circles! If it carries on at this exponential rate, we'll end up with a helluva a lot. I guess on average we're getting 150 a year. I think we'll probably get a similar amount, but the quality is the main thing this year. Some of these multi- dimensional patterns are incredible. We're supposed to go out and measure them and some are so difficult! You walk into a space in a wheat field on flat ground where you can see the formation disappearing in the distance over the side of a hill. That's when it would dawn on anybody for people in America if they could go in them that when you stand in one of these things and see it disappearing into the distance, like hundreds of circles or hundreds of squares in some weird pattern. It's undeniable that something incredible is happening here.\" We b s it e s : http://cropcircleconnector.com/signsofthetimes/signsofthetimes.html http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/ Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
