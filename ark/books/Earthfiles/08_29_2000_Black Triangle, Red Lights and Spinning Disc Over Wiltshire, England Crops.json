Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Black Triangle, Red Lights and Spinning Disc Over Wiltshire, England Crops © 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe August 29, 2000 Windmill Hill, Wiltshire, England - On Saturday, August 12th in Wiltshire, England before returning to Philadelphia, I talked with a professional interior painter and interior designer from Farnham, Surrey, England and his 14-year-old daughter, Claire, about a black triangle, red lights and spinning disc each had seen either with or without binoculars on August 7th during a night watch in the Windmill Hill formation that was discovered near Avebury that day. I was in that formation around 4 PM that afternoon and was amazed at the thousands of \"peacock feathers\" neatly created in wave patterns by the whiskers of the mature barley.

Interview: "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Richard Salter, Interior Painter and Designer, and 14-year-old daughter, Claire, Farnham, Surrey, England: \"We decided to visit the new formation at Windmill Hill at Avebury and it was Monday, August 7th. We arrived at the formation at around 9:15 PM in the evening. WHICH FORMATION WAS THIS? The formation that appeared with the rings, fairly simple design with rings and circles. THIS IS THE ONE THAT PEOPLE ARE CALLING THE PEACOCK FEATHER FLOOR LAY? That's correct. We set ourselves up inside the formation and had been there a couple of hours. By about 11 o'clock in the evening, we started to see very bright lights on the horizon towards the Cherhill monument. One's first reaction is that it's probably a helicopter or plane flying directly towards you with its main lights on. Spinning Disc But we stood there for some time and watched this particular light and it seemed to remain motionless in the sky. And when you looked at it through binoculars, it seemed to be shifting or rotating or something. There was definitely a feeling that it wasn't one light. There was a feeling that there were other lights around it or the whole thing was shimming backwards and forwards or something like that. WHAT COLORS WERE YOU SEEING? It was predominantly white and orange, but the two people who were with me that evening also saw other colors. Blue was mentioned as well. We'd all sat and watched this for some time and I decided to get my camera from its bag to try to take a photograph of it and the very instant I picked the camera bag up, the thing just blinked out, disappeared. We stayed there for some time and the whole process repeated itself. We saw a similar light in a similar direction to that, but it didn't stay stationary for so long. It disappeared off to the west. Red Lights And then shortly after this, we noticed some red lights traveling towards the east from that point. Naturally, we tracked these and I looked at them through binoculars and then put the binoculars down and watched the lights. There seemed to be one or two lights traveling eastwards. Then a third light appeared very near by these other two. Black Triangle Then they seemed to remain stationary in the sky for awhile and started what I can only describe as sort of darting about, or flashing on and off. It was difficult to say what the motion of these lights was. So, I picked up the binoculars once more and had a good look at the lights. And just as I did so, one of these red lights went off, blinked out, and I saw what I can only describe as a black triangle fly away to the west from these other lights at a high speed and this black triangle was fairly large in size, I would say. It had no lights on it whatsoever. And none of us could hear anything at all. We couldn't hear aircraft noise, helicopter noise, or anything. It was dead silent. And it appeared that as the black triangle went off to the west, the remaining red lights seemed to be trying to follow it. In other words, they went off in the same direction as the triangle."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Drawing of red lights, yellow spinning disc and black triangle observed with eyes and binoculars by three adults and one teenager from Windmill Hill formation around 11 PM on August 7, 2000 in Wiltshire, England. Drawing © 2000 by Richard Salter. AT ANY POINT, DID THE RED LIGHTS SEEM TO INTERACT WITH THE TRIANGLE? No, because I didn't notice the triangle until - you know, I had trained binoculars on these red lights and the whole thing happened very fast. One minute, I was aware of the lights. The next minute, I saw this black object and it just darted away to the west. And the remaining lights seemed to be tracking it, following it or making an attempt to follow it, but couldn't maintain its speed. It (the triangle) just vanished. IS THERE A RED YOU COULD COMPARE THESE RED LIGHTS TO THAT WE MIGHT ALL KNOW? I have spent many nights on the hills around here and it is very easy to get carried away with sightings that could have more explainable feel to them. These lights are sometimes associated with helicopters and do see these lights on helicopters, so I naturally thought at first that's what I was witnessing. But because of the way they behaved and darted about in the sky, flickered on and off, and then the sudden interaction with this black object, I'm not so sure they were helicopters, but who knows? BUT THE RED YOU WOULD RECOGNIZE AS A RED ON A HELICOPTER? Yes, it was a very intense red. No other hint of color in it. HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING IN THE UNKNOWN THAT MIMICS THINGS LIKE HELICOPTERS AND PLANES? Oh, yes. It's well known that unmarked helicopters are seen in various parts of the world, usually with no lights or markings. YOU AREN'T THE FIRST PERSON WHO HAS BEEN WATCHING SOMETHING, GOTTEN A CAMERA OUT TO VIDEOTAPE WHAT THEY THOUGHT MIGHT BE A HELICOPTER ONLY TO HAVE WHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS A HELICOPTER WITH A FLASHING LIGHT SUDDENLY TRANSFORM INTO MULTIPLE LIGHTS THAT SEEMED TO BE GOING AROUND SOMETHING? Right. This group of lights, originally the three red lights, were very closely bunched together and seemed to be tracking from west to east in a line. Then at this particular point in time, they all seemed to converge on this one spot and that's the point at which I trained the binoculars on them. And no sooner had I done that then I was aware of this black object which seemed to me - I got the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"distinct impression that this black object was trying to evade these lights. WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING AT THE RED LIGHTS THROUGH THE BINOCULARS, COULD YOU SEE ANY STRUCTURE AT ALL? No, none whatsoever, until this black object appeared. HOW FAR DO YOU THINK, ESTIMATE, THE BLACK TRIANGLE WAS FROM THE RED LIGHTS THAT YOU COULD SEE THROUGH THE BINOCULARS? I'd say they were all together in the same part of the sky. DOESN'T IT SEEM LIKE THERE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE A RELATIONSHIP, ATTACHMENT, BETWEEN THOSE RED LIGHTS AND THAT BLACK TRIANGLE? That's certainly how it seemed to me. WHEN THE BLACK TRIANGLE BEGAN TO MOVE OFF AT A RAPID RATE, THE RED LIGHTS FOLLOWED? I think one or two might have followed, but because I was concentrating on the black object through the binoculars, I'm led to believe by my two friends who were with me that other things happened after this. Claire Salter, 14-Years-Old YOU HAVE HEARD WHAT YOUR FATHER DESCRIBED WHAT HE SAW. CAN YOU NOW START FROM THE VERY FIRST UNUSUAL THING YOU SAW AND DESCRIBE FOR ME IN AS MUCH DETAIL AS POSSIBLE, THINKING OF A RADIO AUDIENCE ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW WITH YOUR OWN EYES? Yes, we were just looking around and then we saw a very bright light. And it was white and it seemed to be flashing different colors like orange, red, green. And when we looked through the binoculars, it didn't seem to be like a round object. It seemed to look like a flat disc-shaped object and it looked like it was rotating round and round in the same spot all the time. WHAT WERE YOU SEEING THAT SUGGESTED TO YOU THAT IT WAS SP IN N IN G ? I don't know. It just didn't seem to be on the same spot. The lights were moving, but not coming forward or backwards, just rotating. WOULD YOU COMPARE IT TO SOMETHING LIKE A MERRY- GO-ROUND? Yeah, it looked like a merry-go-round. YOU'RE WATCHING THESE DIFFERENT COLORED LIGHTS THAT APPEAR TO BE TURNING AROUND LIKE A MERRY-GO-ROUND. DID YOU SEE ANY OTHER OBJECTS AROUND IT? No, that was the one. DID YOU SEE ANY BEAMS OR LIGHTS EMANATE FROM IT? No, it just looked like a disc shaped object rotating. HOW DO YOU THINK THAT COMPARES, THE FLAT DISC WITH ROTATING LIGHTS - WITH WHAT YOUR FATHER DESCRIBED OF"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE RED LIGHTS AND BLACK TRIANGLE? DID YOU SEE THE BLACK TRIANGLE? I saw the red lights, but because I didn't have any binoculars or anything, I didn't see the black triangle. WHERE WERE THE RED LIGHTS IN COMPARISON TO THE FLATTENED DISC THAT SEEMED TO BE SPINNING? It was further to the left. I don't know how much further, but quite a long way and lower down. WHICH PART WAS LOWER DOWN? The red lights and the black triangle were lower to the horizon than the single disc. WHEN THE BLACK TRIANGLE TOOK OFF WITH THE RED LIGHTS, WHAT DID THE SPINNING DISC DO? It had gone by then. The spinning disc had gone by the time the red lights and black triangle had arrived. DID YOU SEE IT MOVE OFF? WHAT HAPPENED? HOW DID THAT DISC GO AWAY? My dad was going to get the camera out to take pictures and it just blinked out, disappeared. I have something else to add. Because when my dad was watching the black triangle, he didn't see what else went on and one of the red lights that stayed and didn't follow the black triangle turned a really, really bright white color. And then just blinked out and another light just shot up into the sky upwards really quickly. W H AT T IME WAS T H AT ? I think it was around about midnight. (Monday, August 7 to Tuesday, Aug. 8) We were pretty much amazed to find out the following morning after this night watch that a new crop circle was found at All Cannings, it's a 9-pointed star formation. And of course, we were trying to figure out if the lights and triangular object that we saw from our perspective at Windmill Hill been in the general direction of All Cannings. I would say it was slightly to the west of All Cannings, but who knows? Directions can be deceptive, especially at night. But it is rather odd that we witnessed all these things and then the following morning, there was a fresh crop formation. WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY OF 2000, THE 9-POINTED STAR WITH THOSE FOUNTAINS IN IT. Nine pointed star with tall swirls of wheat between each point discovered"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"between Stanton St. Bernard and All Cannings on August 8, 2000.

RICHARD, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANY OTHER UNUSUAL LIGHT PHENOMENA OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS IN WILTSHIRE? Yes, I was here last summer with my son on numerous occasions and every time we came down, we experienced different sorts of light shows in the area. We sat and watched what we thought were satellites tracking across the night sky only to be completely confounded by their peculiar and erratic motions. Sometimes they would change direction while we were watching them. Or we had one particular case in which what we thought was a satellite suddenly started to do a slalom in the sky and just wobbled from side to side and then disappeared. We saw numerous bright lights come off the horizon, very intense white light that would change colors to green or orange and then suddenly stop or change direction and move off. We've been watching a starry sky. I'm quite used to observing the sky because I'm sort of a keen amateur astronomer, so I know the constellations and various key stars. And I'm used to gazing at the sky. And last year, I saw several what I thought were stars suddenly start to move where they had been completely stationary before. Then they would suddenly move positions in the sky. Of course, you question your sanity when you see these things because it's just so weird and bizarre, but I'm fairly certain what my son and I saw last summer was pretty unusual. NOW IN 2000 IN AUGUST, YOU SEE RED LIGHTS IN ASSOCIATION WITH A BLACK TRIANGLE AND A MERRY-GO-ROUND OF LIGHTS THAT IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT PEOPLE SAW IN JULY OF 1991 THE NIGHT THAT THE BARBURY CASTLE EXTRAORDINARY FORMATION OCCURRED. IT'S ALMOST THE IDENTICAL DESCRIPTION. Yes, I've read about that series of events and was fascinated by it. And there were also very loud noises heard in the district, I believe, very loud, thundery noises. Some people put them down to military aircraft. But there were a whole series of bizarre events that particular night. AFTER SIX YEARS, DO YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF INTUITIVE INSIGHT ABOUT WHAT COULD BE BEHIND THIS PHENOMENON? Difficult question, but my own gut feeling is that it's extraterrestrial. I can't pin it down to anything else. It has to be an intelligence that's interacting with us in some way or wanting to. I don't go down the hoax theory at all. It doesn't wash for me, I'm afraid, having seen so many formations for myself over the years. No, I really am convinced whatever is doing it is coming from above and it's done with extreme intelligence and great forethought and planning. It's got to be ET"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"as far as I'm concerned. WHEN SOME PEOPLE LIKE ROBBERT IN HOEVEN, HOLLAND WHO SAYS HE THINKS IT IS ANGELIC - WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE TO THE IDEA OF SOMETHING IN ANOTHER DIMENSION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN OVER THE CENTURIES DESCRIBED AS ANGELS? Yeah, it's a possibility. I've often thought along those lines. I don't know. I still go with the ETs. There are so many UFO sightings globally now and we've had our fair share in Britain over the years. It just seems to me that the two have got to be connected. People see lights in the sky and strange objects darting about and then the following day we have crop circles. It just seems to me too obvious. It's got to be the best consideration, I think. WHAT ARE THESE SOLID BLACK TRIANGLES THAT HAVE NO LIGHTS, THAT HAVE BEEN SEEN OVER AN ARC OF TEN YEARS IN ASSOCIATION ALSO WITH THE CROP CIRCLE MYSTERY? THAT SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THOSE UNSOLVED MYSTERIES THAT SO FAR NO ONE HAS BEEN ADDRESSING. Yeah. Black triangles in Britain have been seen for some time now and people have had them fly overhead completely silently and describe them as being the size of football fields - great big black, sinister-looking objects. Who knows?\" More Information: Back in 1992, a book entitled Ciphers in the Crops, The Fractal and Geometric Circles of 1991 , Edited by Beth Davis was published by Gateway Books in Bath, England. On Page 57, under the title \"Pulsing Lights at Beckhampton\" author Gary Hardwick wrote about what he and two others saw around midnight on August 16-17, 1991, only hours before the extraordinary Barbury Castle Triangle formation was discovered at sunup. \"We (Gary, Brian Grist and friend, Alison) stood outside an watched as this light (Light Number One) pulsed green and red... It was traveling in a westerly direction towards Calne. There was no noise. ...I had a pair of field glasses which I attempted to focus on the light. I handed them to Brian. I then noticed another light moving behind us... For some reason I looked straight above where I was standing - vertically into the night sky, which was clear and peppered with stars. In an instant, probably no more than two or three seconds, I saw above me a black shape, narrow at the front and wide at the rear, which obscured the stars and which passed eastward at incredible speed and totally silently towards the horizon. ...all that I can say is that it resembled a triangle. ...I was left with an overwhelming feeling of having seen something so powerful that any attempt at decoding its possible meaning would be futile. \"Light Two ...was just sitting in the sky in the general direction of Windmill Hill. Through the field glasses, it could be seen pulsing white, green and green-blue; it had no discernible shape. \"We next became aware of Lights Three and Four across the toad towards the north. ...They were pulsing like the uncoordinated flashing of the two lights on the roof of an emergency vehicle, like an ambulance...(Light Five) ...and we now all saw together a much larger light of pulsing red in vertical motion. ...Its movement also seemed quite jerky, which could be to do with its distance from us. However, it also seemed to be quite large in comparison to the earlier lights. I had to steady the field glasses on the roof of the car and hold my breath. Having done this, what I saw was a column of red, green and white pulses, alternating direction from bottom to top and vice versa."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\"Light Five, the vertical column, was by now very low in the sky. Suddenly we saw a very thin white beam of light join it to the ground. This beam was curved, not straight or jagged, and lasted one to two seconds. Light Five then disappeared, or rather faded, quite quickly.\" We b s it e s : http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/temporarytemples/homepage.html http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/ Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
