Stringfield April 5, 1978 Revised July 20, 1978 Presented at the MUFON Symposium July 29, 1978 T o be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 1 of Status Report I, written July 29, 1978. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report II begins at Earthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all the previous status reports, see Earthfiles Archives. Leonard H. Stringfield: \" Since the advent of the UFO, dating back to World War II when there was official recognition of the 'foo fighter,' one hard fact stands out: the world public at large still "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"disbelievers in its existence. Another fact: most of our world's scientific community does not believe in UFOs either, although a small number of its Fellowship today will admit their puzzlement and sometimes curiosity over the persistence of UFO reports. For those of us dedicated to serious UFO research, working in all professional levels, there is no doubt that a real interloper from somewhere exists! Knowing this is frustrating. In 31 years of prodigious effort, our research has failed to discover, or uncover, the real UFO's nature, its origin or intent - and I hasten to add, to force open the door of alleged official secrecy behind which might be concealed the hard evidence; or if you will, the extraordinary and sobering proof we have all sought. Today, considering the long, evasive history of the UFO and an equally evasive official posture, our research stands at a critical crossroad. Here we find a two-way split off, a growing and sharpening divergence of opinion about the nature and origin of the UFO. One view entertains the notion that the UFO is a paraphysical or psychical visitant from another realm or of another dimension and that all the paranormal evidence reportedly associated with the UFO precludes a simple 'nuts and bolts' physical explanation. This hypothesis, in the view of some researchers, rules out the interplanetary 'nuts and bolts' spaceship. The other major hypothesis, and now considered a conservative view, postulates that the UFO is a structured machine and comes from across the vast reaches of space and time from another solar system. This belief maintains that the extraterrestrial race has, by virtue of its advanced technology, overcome the problem of spatial distance and has developed great psychical powers by which it can manipulate man's mind when it sees fit to do so. Thus, in this postulation, the reported paranormal events can also be explained. Of course, there are many other provocative splinter theories, some interlacing the two major hypotheses and some radically disregarding the known facts. Theories are free, and are a dime a dozen. In its honest endeavor to proceed down either hypothetical path, research today continues to investigate UFO reports, correlate and compute the reported data, computerize photographs, conduct conferences and symposia, and drudge over 13,000 UFO reports released by the U. S. Air Force's former Project Bluebook which have been made available for public study at the National Archives in Washington, D. C. Therefore, it's not by accident that UFO researchers have provided for its brethren a convenient language by which to describe events and, more specifically, a terminology so that UFO reports can be classified. Speaking of terminology, we borrow a page from the eminent Dr. J. Allen Hynek's book, The UFO Experience, A Scientific Inquiry. From this major work, we now have Close Encounters of the First, Second and Third Kind, which are labels covering a hypothetical set of conditions wherein the human witness observes or experiences a UFO at close range. These include physical or electromagnetic effects to a witness or his surroundings or an encounter with a strange alien being. Popularized by the movie of the same name, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, has become a household term. Now anybody and everybody can share in an awareness of these rare and bizarre events. But there is another event of the Alien Third Kind. This is an event known mainly through rumor. Even knowledgeable researchers admit they know of it only from shadowy sources, and when pursued, found sudden dead ends. Through patience, perseverance and careful, courteous diplomacy, I have wended my way through the many shadowy mazes and found, to my surprise, sources of light at many of the so-called dead ends. What I have learned from these sources describes an event which I shall call Retrievals of the Third Kind. Retrievals of the Third Kind relate primarily to the alien being. To be more precise, I refer to incidents where a UFO had allegedly crashed and both it and the occupants were retrieved by military personnel who were dispatched to the scene. According to my sources, these immobilized craft and deceased occupants, described as humanoid, have been placed in custody at certain military installations where they were studied under the highest security measures. Now, for the first time, sufficient data have been amassed to lend support to some of the old retrieval claims. But, looking back to the 1950s, there was little or no desire"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"then to pursue the reported claims. At that time, active researchers - including myself - did little more than scoff. We thought we had good reason. Our collective 'scoffing' was the result of an alleged grand hoax. Here, I refer to a book, Behind the Flying Saucer, by the late Frank Scully, published in 1950. Briefly, it told about a reported saucer crash in Aztec, New Mexico, in 1948. Scully went on to relate that a scientist he had met had possession of metal artifacts taken from inside the craft which was proof that the saucer was from outer space. Investigation, however, revealed Scully's scientist was a fraud. With the book's subsequent exposure as a hoax, which got a lot of publicity, it became unfashionable for any objective researcher to write or talk about crashed UFOs and their alleged 'little men.' Adding fuel to the fire of a condemned book were strong Air Force denials in 1954 that a retrieved UFO was in hiding at Wright-Patterson AFB. I remember calling Lt. Colonel John O'Mara, Chief of Intelligence at the air base, inquiring about the alleged retrievals. His reply in part was, 'Ridiculous!' So completely was Scully's retrievals story put down that some researchers today wonder, in retrospect, if the book and/or its exposure were contrived (as misinformation to keep the public and media away from the facts). But despite denials and the suspicions of research, the crash and retrievals stories persisted. Then, like a bolt from the blue, while preparing the manuscript for my book, Situation Red, The UFO Siege (published by Doubleday), some new reliable sources opened up. Then once again, to my surprise, after the release of my book in 1977, still more sources surfaced to talk about what they knew. Then one by one, the jigsaw pieces began to fit together and a picture emerged. Now I believe this is the time and place - Dayton, Ohio, close to Wright-Patterson AFB - that we must face this greatest of issues head-on. We must now take a new and honest look at the old rumors. And we must also take a new look at the possibility of a grand official cover-up, and why. If anyone of the retrieval incidents is true, or if only one of my informants is telling the truth, then humankind is in for a shock. The impact of its sudden revelation - or forced admission through official pronouncement - would probably shake up humankind's lifestyle, philosophies and even economy. And if it is true that alien humanoids have been retrieved and are held in a preserved state at one or more military installations, then our government and all consorting governments responsible for this concealment, will have to explain their policy of prolonged secrecy. We might then rightly ask what else is hidden about the UFO of a more frightening nature? Probably following any official pronouncement of this magnitude, there would be strong public reaction. There would be demands for more hidden facts. As always, some one or some agency would have to be pinned with the blame. Certainly at the top of the list would be the military establishment and covert intelligence agencies. Also to blame would be the media. Where was their prowess to probe for the truth? It seems strange that some of its audacious members who helped bring down a president failed to reach the right people with the right UFO facts - or were they, too, in certain key areas a part of the big cover-up? And UFO researchers, too, can share in some of the blame. Too much disunity among the major research groups is one factor. Perhaps a more concerted action would have carried more weight at critical moments when pressures were put to bear in areas of known cover-up. Also, perhaps too much time has been spent by influential researchers looking for a paranormal answer for the UFO. One fact has stood out for years. The average reported UFO appears to be a metallic, structured craft with windows and when in a landing position, sometimes uses tripods. While this general description might apply to a vehicle from any other mysterious realm, it does suggest that the design is more a feat of engineering than of psychical or spiritual manifestation. Now for an academic thought. Is it right or wise for research - or myself - to try and pry open the lid of a possible Pandora's Box? Is it not morally right to know about the crashed UFO and its alien occupants? Is there something sinister about the continuing surveillance of Earth? And what, you might ask, is my own opinion of my informants endowed with such powerful testimony? Frankly, I cannot refute the credibility of any of my informants."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"They are from scattered areas, many of whom I have pursued with great effort. Knowing something about the character of each suggests that none is hoaxing and it is difficult to believe that anyone of them was a 'plant.' Even if one or two were, what about the others? I might ask, why plant the kind of information that could work against the official position which is to play down the notion of secrecy about UFOs? It is with equal candor that I must state that I am not in a providential position to pass a positive or final judgment on the retrieval stories or on my informants. On this tenuous ground, I must allow for some marginal error in observation or tiny flaw in human judgment for each reported account. However, let me quote an old adage, 'Wherever there is smoke, there is fire.' From my position, I certainly can see a helluva lot of smoke! Now, let me switch from my beliefs to yours and consider what you might think about me relative to my expose. To help guide your appraisal, allow me to state that I personally have not seen a retrieved UFO, parts of one, or its occupants. Also, for the record, I do not possess a single affidavit to prove that any one of my informants has seen a retrieved craft or its occupants. I have only their names and their testimony. Unfortunately, I cannot use these names. Anonymity has been requested and will be respected. The reasons should be obvious to all. In essence, therefore, the cases I present in this paper without names to back up the informant's testimony can be construed as hearsay. If perchance, hearsay is to be my undoing, then I must make my stand on the merits of my own credibility which I trust has already been established in my 29 years of UFO research. You are the judge and the jury. I will now proceed with the testimony of my informants concerning Retrievals of the Third Kind in the following abstracts. ABSTRACT 1 In 1948, according to reports from hazy sources, a UFO with occupants numbering anywhere from one to sixteen, had crashed in a desert region of southwestern United States or Mexico and was retrieved by U. S. military authorities. But the reports never got beyond rumor because 1948 was the year when Frank Scully's book unloaded an alleged hoax on the public about a crashed UFO in Aztec, New Mexico. In the Fall of 1977, new word of a 1948 crash came to me from a well-informed military source. His information, however, was scanty. He had heard from other 'inside' military sources that a metallic disc had crashed somewhere in a desert region. His only details indicated that the craft had suffered severe damage on impact and was retrieved by military units. By coincidence, months later in 1977, I was to learn more about a crashed disc occurring in 1948. This came from researcher Todd Zechel, whom I had known since 1975 when he became Research Director of Ground Saucer Watch. Formerly with the National Security Agency, Zechel stated that a U. S. Air Force technician told him that his uncle, then a Provost Marshall at Carswell Air Force Base near Ft. Worth, Texas, had taken part in the 1948 recovery of a crashed (New Mexico) UFO which was described as a metallic disc, 90 feet in diameter. The crash occurred about 30 miles inside the Mexican border across from Laredo, Texas, and was recovered by U. S. troops after it was tracked on radar screens. The job assigned the Provost Marshall, now a retired Colonel, was to cordon off the crash site. The retired Colonel, now living in Florida, was tracked by Zechel. Among other facts revealed by the Colonel was that one dead alien was found aboard the craft which was described as about 4 feet, 6 inches tall, completely hairless, with hands that had no thumbs. Zechel learned from his source that the troops involved in the retrieval were warned that if they said a word about the incident they would be the 'sorriest people around.' Continuing his investigation, Zechel pieced together other eyewitnesses to the 1948 crash event. In his statement, Zechel relates the following: 'I tracked another Air Force Colonel, now retired in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He had seen the UFO in flight. He was flying an F-94 fighter out of Dias Air Force Base in Texas and was over Albuquerque, New Mexico, when reports came of a UFO on the West Coast, flying over Washington state. Radars clocked its speed at 2,000 miles per hour. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"'It made a 90-degree turn and flew east over Texas.' The Colonel, then a Captain pilot, actually saw it as it passed. Then suddenly, it disappeared from radar screens. At Dias Base, the radar operators plotted its course and decided it had crashed some 30 miles across the Mexican border from Laredo. When the Captain got back to base, he and a fellow pilot got into a small plane and took off over the border after the UFO. When they landed in the desert at the crash site, U. S. troops were there before them. 'The craft was covered with a canopy and the two pilots were not allowed to see it. They were then called to Washington, D. C., for debriefing and sworn to secrecy about the whole event.' Zechel also traced a U. S. Naval Intelligence officer who was in Mexico City at the time of the crash. He was rushed to the spot, but got there just as the craft was being loaded onto military trucks. COMMENT: Todd Zechel related to me by phone on March 15, 1978, that additional details pertinent to this 1948 incident will be made known in his forthcoming 1978 book, Under Intelligent Control . Zechel also related that he has a signed affidavit by the retired Air Force Colonel who was involved in the cordoning-off operations. ABSTRACT 2 In 1952, the year of the great wave of UFO sightings throughout the U. S., can also share in the history of retrieval data. My information for one known UFO crash incident in 1952 comes from a reliable person in a technical position at a large General Electric plant. His brother, who wishes to be unnamed, was on duty as a radar specialist at Edwards Air Force Base, California, in 1952, when he saw a UFO descending toward Earth at great speed across his radar screen. When the UFO had been confirmed to have crashed, the Captain on duty gave him instructions, 'You did not see anything!' The specialist a short time later learned from base officials that an unidentified craft did crash in a nearby remote desert area. The retrieved craft was more than 50 feet in diameter with a row of windows around its equator. Its metallic surface was in a burned-blackened condition. He also had heard that the craft was occupied by dead humanoid bodies approximately 4.5 feet tall. Also, the specialist recalls that he heard reports that the damaged craft was held temporarily in a hangar at Edwards Air Force Base before it was shipped by truck to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. COMMENT: I had asked my informant if I could discuss this incident with his brother. But when he checked by phone, he was reminded that the incident was classified as secret and he would not be in a position to disclose further details. In possible conjunction with this 1952 event, I have talked with two sources who had witnessed a large military vehicle or lo-boy drag a suspicious cargo under tarpaulin destined for Wright-Patterson AFB. One observer was Quartermaster at Godman Field, Kentucky, when the lo-boy, under heavy guard at night, made a transient stop there. Word on the base was that its hidden cargo was a crashed UFO. Other witnesses, who had observed a strange cargo being transported on a lo-boy into Wright-Patterson AFB in 1952, were a man and wife then residing in Circleville, Ohio. By telephone in 1952, they claimed while driving their car near the base that traffic was stalled. Escorting the vehicle, they said, was a motorcade of military police. ABSTRACT 3 Additional testimony in support of a crashed UFO incident in 1952 comes from an unquestionable source: John Schuessler, Deputy Director of MUFON, and engineer for McDonnell Douglas at NASA. His data came from his father and stepmother, who secured their data in 1968 from a firsthand source, who was their neighbor in a small town in Pennsylvania. According to John Schuessler, his family's close friend was formerly a civilian guard serving at a Receiving Gate for Internal Security at Wright-Patterson AFB. While on"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"duty, sometime in 1952, he witnessed a tractor with lo-boy hauling a tarpaulin- covered craft into a tight security area at the base. The guard also had told Schuessler that he witnessed at the Receiving Gate the deceased bodies recovered from the crashed UFO at a site vaguely referred to as somewhere in the U. S. Southwest. Packed in crates, the guard described the bodies as being 'little people' or humanoid. It is not known whether or not the bodies arrived at the same time at the base as the craft on the lo-boy or at another time by other means. One point he did make clear about the area in which he worked to his Schuessler friends, 'Everything delivered had to pass by me.' John Schuessler said he tried to follow up to get more information by arranging a meeting with the former guard through the influence of his parents, but his efforts were futile. Said John, 'He refused to talk about it, even to me.' COMMENT: The brief testimony of the Security Guard at Wright-Patterson AFB and that of the Radar Specialist at Edwards AFB (cited in Abstract # 2) suggests that the official cover-up of vital UFO data is so great that some of it which concerns the captive craft and occupants is under a special system of files - and has always been independent of those maintained by Project Blue Book, and perhaps are without classification so that even the Freedom of Information Act cannot reach them. Probably the area in which the security guard had served his tenure of duty from the late 1940s to the mid 1950s was the same as that referred to by U. S. Senator Barry Goldwater in his letter to me dated December 3, 1974, in which the Senator stated, 'I made an effort to get in the room at Wright-Patterson where the information was stored, and I was denied that request.' ABSTRACT 4 Mr. T., who holds a high technical position in civilian life today, was in the Spring of 1953, at the age of 20, a radar specialist with secret security clearance. While stationed in Ft. Monmouth, New Jersey, in 1953, he and a small, select number of radar specialists were summoned to view a special film at the base theater. Without any briefing, the 16mm movie projector was flicked on and the film began to roll on the screen, showing the usual flaws and scratches found in combat photograph film. Suddenly, without any titles or credits or music, there appeared a desert scene dominated by a silver disc-shaped object embedded in the sand with a domed section at the top. At the bottom was a hatch or door that was open. In the next scene, Mr. T. recalls seeing ten to fifteen military personnel all dressed in fatigues, and without identification patches, standing around what appeared to be the disabled craft. By judging their height against the UFO, Mr. T. determined that its width was approximately fifteen to twenty feet in diameter and that an open hatch or door at the bottom was about 1.5 feet wide and perhaps 3 feet high. At this point, Mr. T had no idea of the movie's purpose. I asked about the activity of the personnel. He said, 'They were just looking at the object.' Then the movie switched to what appeared to be the interior of the craft. A panel with a few simple levers was shown. He remembers being impressed by the muted pastel colors and sudden glares of white - the sign of poor photography. Again there was a change of scenes. Now in view were two tables, probably taken inside a tent. To his surprise, there were dead bodies on the tables. Two were on one table and one on another. Mr. T said the bodies appeared little by human standards and most notable were the heads, all looking alike, and all being large compared to their body sizes. They looked mongoloid, he thought, with small noses, mouths and eyes that were shut. He did not recall seeing ears or hair. The skin, he said, was leathery and ashen in color. Each wore a tight-fitting suit in a pastel color. The sight of the dead bodies was the end of the movie. As most military movies credit the Signal Corps or some other source, this one 'stopped cold,' said Mr. T. When the lights came on in the theater, the officer in charge stood up and instructed the viewers to 'think about the movie,' and added firmly, 'Don't relate its contents to anyone.' Mr. T said, in good faith, he did not even tell his wife who lived near the base."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" To Mr. T's surprise, two weeks later, he was approached by an intelligence officer on the base and told, 'Forget the movie you saw. It was a hoax.' Shortly after seeing the movie, he heard from a couple of top security officers on the base that a UFO had crashed in New Mexico, and had been recovered with its occupants. The date of the crash was 1952, said Mr. T. Commented my informant: 'The 5-minute-long movie certainly was not a Walt Disney production. It was probably shot by an inexperienced cameraman because it was full of scratches and had poor coloring and texture.' Mr. T., when asked about his interest in UFOs, claimed that he was not interested - then or now , but he has always been curious about the purpose of the film in relation to his work in radar. Years later, he met an old Army acquaintance who also was a radar specialist. To T's surprise, he learned from this man that he, too, had seen the same film at another base under similar hush-hush conditions. COMMENT: Considering the credibility status of my informant, I believe he saw the movie and describes the subject matter to the best of his recollection. Regarding the subject matter, he believes that the crashed craft and the dead bodies, were bona fide. It would have been difficult, even by a major Hollywood studio, to have made dummy bodies look so real for use in an otherwise make-shift film. And for what morbid purpose? \" C ontinued in Part 2 - Kingman, Arizona UFO Crash/Retrieval Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
