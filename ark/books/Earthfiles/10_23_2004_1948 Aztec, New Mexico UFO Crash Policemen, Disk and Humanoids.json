He showed me an alleged briefing paper for the President of the United States about \"unidentified aerial vehicles\" and entities. One of the pages contained a list of locations where American military and intelligence units had retrieved aerial vehicles described as \"extraterrestrial,\" along with humanoid bodies - both dead and alive. In addition to the well known name Roswell, other sites on the crash retrieval list included Magdalena near the Plains of San Augustin; Kingman, Arizona; northern Mexico south of Loredo, Texas; and Aztec, New Mexico. See other Earthfiles Aztec crash reports in More Information below. In 1986, several years of research about the Aztec, New Mexico UFO crash was compiled and published in the book, UFO Crash At Aztec - A Well Kept Secret © 1986 by William S. Steinman and Wendelle C. Stevens. Limited edition out of print, originally published in 1986 by America West Distributors, Boulder, Colorado. The Steinman and Stevens front cover photograph is familiar to all of us who have made the trek to Hart Canyon about twelve miles northeast of Aztec, New Mexico, where a 99-foot-diameter silver-colored lens-shaped craft was allegedly found up on top of the mesa in a spot where even the rocks had been sheared off, apparently by the force of the craft's impact.

Businessman Scott Ramsey, Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Express Wire Services, Inc. in Charlotte, North Carolina, joined up with former New Mexico State Legislator, Andrew Kissner, in the mid-1990s to try to confirm one way or the other if Aztec was a real event that the U. S. government had skillfully covered up for national security reasons. Kissner had been working with New Mexico Congressman Steven Schiff (deceased) in an investigation of the famous and controversial Corona UFO crash site on the Mac Brazel ranch several miles north of Roswell around July 4, 1947. At the same time, Scott Ramsey was trying to follow up a reference in Frank Scully's 1950 book, Behind the Flying Saucers , in which Scully talked about the early detection of the Aztec craft by Top Secret radar bases in New Mexico. Andy Kissner was doing an official New Mexico historical research project trying to find pre-Cold War artifacts meaning secret bases and that type of thing to put on the historical landmark list - and became interested in Scott Ramsey's research to find out whether top secret radar bases had existed in New Mexico as Scully described. Andrew Kissner, in his official state legislator position, arranged to travel with Scott to Maxwell AFB in Montgomery, Alabama, to start looking for anything that had to do with the Cold War. This week I talked with Scott about his and Andrew Kissner's discovery that the top secret radar bases did exist. Further, Scott was lead to the families of two Aztec and Cuba, New Mexico, police officers. For the first time, Scott Ramsey talked to me this week about the policemen having been scrambled on a night back in 1948 to go to Hart Canyon. These testimonies about a large, silver disk on the mesa above Hart Canyon and the existence of three powerful radar stations around Los Alamos and Albuquerque contradict decades of government denials. 1946-1957 - Top Secret Radar Bases in New Mexico Scott Ramsey, Vice President of Sales and Marketing, Express Wire Services, Inc., Charlotte, North Carolina: \"Actually before we had gone to Montgomery, we had found the first top secret radar base by dumb luck and took photographs of it with us to Maxwell AFB. We said we had found an old base up in the northern New Mexico mountains and asked, 'What can you tell us about it?' The Maxwell AFB people did not even have it in their files! Several trips later, we found proof that three Top Secret powerful radar bases"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"were built by the Atomic Energy Commission and were operational between 1946 and 1957. Andy requested that all those historic files be declassified and that's how we came to understand the importance of those three radar installations. AM I CORRECT IN REMEMBERING THAT THEY WERE ORIGINALLY BUILT TO PROTECT THE MANHATTAN PROJECT AT LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LAB? That's correct. Sandia National Lab was secondary priority and Kirtland AFB was third. THAT'S WHY IT WAS THE ATOMIC ENERGY COMMISSION WHO BUILT THEM AND THEY WERE CLASSIFIED TOP SECRET ALONG WITH THE MANHATTAN PROJECT BECAUSE NO ONE IN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WANTED ANYONE TO KNOW THAT WE WERE DEVELOPING THE BOMB AND TRYING TO PROTECT LOS ALAMOS WITH THOSE MICROWAVE STATIONS? That's correct. But the microwave came into play actually after W.W.II. They were experimenting with a very powerful radar that was a prototype for the U. S. Navy. It was a pre -LASH-UP powerful radar. Picture two ships at sea. There is no obstruction. If you remember the old microwave radar ranges the last thing you do is put anything metallic in it. Those powerful microwave radars would search out through their powerful waves and find anything metallic it didn't matter how far out in the ocean or how far beyond the horizon it was. Historic map of Aircraft Control and Warning radar stations in the LASHUP military program provided to New Mexico State Representative J. Andrew Kissner by the Air Combat Command, Peterson AFB, Colorado Springs, Colorado. Los Alamos was a good place to test the radar because the Manhattan Project lab had a restricted air space back in that time frame of 1946 to 1957. The problem is that if anything metallic would fly in that airspace, that could cause havoc be it a private Cessna plane, a commercial airplane or even a military transport plane. None would want to fly through the radar beams when they were operating the microwave stations. NOR MAYBE EVEN DISKS? Nor even disks. COULD THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY ALLEGED CRASHES AND RETRIEVALS IN THE 1940S TO 1950S BECAUSE THE U. S. GOVERNMENT WAS EXPERIMENTING WITH MICROWAVE ENERGY AND SOMETIMES TRIANGULATING AND MAYBE SOMETIMES WE BROUGHT DOWN ONE OR MORE OF THESE NON-TERRESTRIAL CRAFT? It's certainly a good theory. They did not run the microwave radar all the time, 24 hours a day. As a matter of fact, I have the monthly reports about how many hours it operated and it was basically flipping on an experiment and then shutting it back off. The Air Force was kind enough to give me the Operator's Manual with it that specifically says: Do Not"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Operate This If The Other Radars Are Detecting Aircraft In The Area. WHERE WERE THE THREE RADAR INSTALLATIONS? 1) You had one on the western side of New Mexico. It was called the Continental Divide radar base, a bit east of Gallup. 2)The primary one went under three names: Los Alamos Radar Base. That changed in the 1950s to the Tierra Amarilla radar base. Then from the early 1950s to 1957, it was renamed the El Vado Radar Base. 3) Then northeast of Albuquerque was the third radar installation, Moriarty. A triangle of sensitive geographic areas and three secret experimental microwave radar stations. Construction begun in late 1947 of El Vado (AFS-P8), Moriarty (AFS-P7), and Continental Divide (AFS-P51). The three radar stations were part of the U. S. Aircraft Control and Warning (AC&W) system that also became known as LASHUP. One of El Vado's specific missions was to protect the Los Alamos Laboratory and the Atomic Energy Commission's atomic bomb production at Los Alamos and Sandia Base. DO YOU THINK THEY KEPT CHANGING THE NAME AROUND LOS ALAMOS FOR SECURITY REASONS? No, it was more political. When the AEC handed it over to the AF in 1950, they named it the Tierra Amarilla because that was the nearest town. Then for whatever reason probably when they matched it up to the 8th Air Force, they renamed it the El Vado strategically probably because in the air you could locate it because of the El Vado Lake which is manmade. The reason it is manmade is to produce hydro-electricity that runs to this day to Los Alamos National Lab. THOSE THREE RADAR INSTALLATIONS WERE ALLEGEDLY CLOSED DOWN WHAT YEAR? 1957. ANY INDICATION THAT ONE OR MORE ARE STILL OPERATIONAL IN SOME WAY ? No, they are all gone. I've been to all three. WHAT LINK, IF ANY, IS THERE BETWEEN THE OPERATION OF THOSE THREE VERY STRONG AND POWERFUL RADAR SITES AND THE CRASH - OR PERHAPS LANDING OR FORCED LANDING OF - THE DISK IN HART CANYON NEAR AZTEC? It would be purely speculation at this point, but it's a good theory. See 04-02-00 Earthfiles, Parts 1 and 2 "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Police Officers and 1948? Aztec UFO Crash This police discovery probably started with our first witness, Ken Farley, that my colleague, Randy Barnes, and I interviewed back in the 1990s. Ken came off as a very credible witness. We flew down to Phoenix and drove to where he was living. He was dying at the time and he sent word to Randy that he wanted to get his story on the record before he passed away. So, we went down to meet with him and during his story, he told Randy and me about the two police officers that were at the Aztec crash site. We kind of parked Ken's story on the side until we interviewed Doug Nolan about a year ago (2003) right before he passed away. About half way through his interview, he talked about two police officers who were at the Hart Canyon crash site. I've got his interview notes in front of me right now and he talked about the one police officer from the local Aztec area and the other young police officer was from the town of Cuba, New Mexico. Doug Nolan went over and asked the policemen, 'Who are you?' Doug said one of the policemen described following an aerial 'thing' throughout the night through the early hours of the morning up what is now Highway 550. Back then, it would have been Highway 44, the old connector from Cuba up to the Four Corners area. So Doug's story matched Ken Farley's about the two police officers and the year he thinks it happened was 1948, but he did not have a more specific date. WHAT ABOUT THE EXACT LOCATION? He said the crash site where we we have built the plaque stand is it and he defined that by the oil field drip tanks that were removed in late 1990s the big storage tanks that are slightly visible on the cover of Bill Steinman's book and photos we have going back to the late 1980s that we photographed the area before the tanks were removed. He does correlate the date with the big brush fire that happened down in Hart Canyon, which is what drew him out to the canyon that day. SO THIS WOULD BE IN HART CANYON WHERE WE'VE ALL BEEN TO A SITE WHERE YOU HAVE PUT A MARKER THE LOCATION WHERE THE MARKER IS WHERE SOMETHING CAME DOWN FROM OUTER SPACE. Yes, the marker is just northwest of the epicenter where they said the craft came to rest. Policemen Describe Craft and Humanoids CAN YOU EXPLAIN IN SOME DETAILS THE POLICE OFFICERS HAVE SAID SO FA R ? There are three police officers we are interested in right now. We're working with families and have agreed not to release names. I have not talked with the police officers. The one police officer from Cuba died Nov. of 2000. The other died in the early 1990s. So now I'm going on secondhand testimony from family and friends. The main police officer from the local area basically came forward in 1972 at a 4th of July picnic when the Aztec story emerged during the picnic. He finally said to the family, 'That actually did happen. I was one of the police officers at the crash site that day.' Going back to the family members, they remember him saying, 'I was one of the police officers at the scene.'"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Apparently, though, there were three involved. The one I will mention and that was Andy Andrews, who was probably in his fifties back at the time of the Aztec incident we don't pinpoint him at the crash site, although he might have been with the Cuba police officer going up Highway 44 the night of the alleged crash. He might have gone into town to alert one of the sheriffs of San Juan County and drawn him out to the crash site and told him they had followed the object up Highway 44. That part we're still trying to pi ece together. WHAT EXACTLY DID THEY DESCRIBE THAT THEY SAW? Large saucer-shaped object, no visible markings, no seams, rivets or weld marks. Perfectly smooth. More pewter in color. going back to Ken Farley and Doug Nolan and the two police officers and going back and retrieving the testimony from the families, they kept using the words: 'It looked like it had been molded absolutely perfectly. No seams.' Very smooth, pewter in color, a sort of dull grey color. A computer simulation of a photograph allegedly seen by former military officer. Source said large, silver-colored disk was found near Farmington, New Mexico (15 miles from Aztec) prior to 1950. YOU HAVE SEEN MY BOOK, GLIMPSES OF OTHER REALITIES -VOL. II: HIGH STRANGENESS IN WHICH I HAVE A TRANSCRIPT FROM AN INTERVIEW DONE WITH A MAN WHO SAID HE WORKED FOR THE GOVERNMENT AND SAW PHOTOGRAPHS FROM AN AZTEC/FARMINGTON CRASH. HE SAID THE CRASH OCCURRED ON A ST. PATRICK DAY IN MARCH AND HINTED THE DATE WAS TWO YEARS BEFORE THE 1950 FARMINGTON 'UFO ARMADA' FLEW OVER. See: 03-16-02 Earthfiles. HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO THE COMPUTER-GENERATED GRAPHIC I HAVE IN GLIMPSES OF OTHER REALITIES, VOL. II: HIGH STRANGENESS ? Pretty close. Large object. Two lenses put together with a 15 to 18 foot bubble in the middle. We did have Ken Farley draw, even though he was on oxygen and near death, he did draw a hand-sketch of what he remembered and what angle it was laying in the ground and I'm looking at that as I talk to you. It's pretty consistent with what Doug Nolan's testimony was as well. Humanoid Entities in Aztec Crash? WHAT ABOUT ENTITIES? Doug Nolan did say he saw at least two. Again, I'll give you a little background on Doug Nolan. He was a 19-year-old employee of the El Paso Oil Company back at this time frame. That's why we are pinpointing it to 1948, based on his 19-year-old age. He was getting ready for work. They start very early out in the oil fields His boss, Bill Ferguson, who is also deceased when Doug picked him up he said, 'We've got to get out to Hart Canyon immediately. There is a bad brush fire and it's near one of the drip tanks that the company owned.' Obviously, with all the natural gas out there, a brush fire and drip tanks are ingredients for a disaster. They got out to the crash site and there were other oil workers that had surrounded basically it looked more like a lightning strike. They said the brush fire had nothing to do with what they discovered later, which was the disk. One of the other oil field workers that Doug had know for years from high school said, 'Hey, this brush fire isn't really what you need to see. What we have on the mesa is what we're amazed about. We don't know what it is.'"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"They went out with Bill Ferguson being the senior and lead man at the time and there laid the disk out on the end of the mesa. WERE THERE ENTITIES THERE? Doug and Bill Ferguson climbed up on the craft and looked in the window and Doug said he could see two humanoid beings slumped over. HAS ANYONE YOU'VE INTERVIEWED DRAWN FOR YOU ENTITIES OR CRAFT ? Just drawings of the craft. IS IT ALWAYS THE SAME DRAWING IN TERMS OF AZTEC? Yes. There are two things that I've left out my presentation that Doug Nolan and Ken Farley described on the craft, and I'm still withholding that and using it as my bait for other future eyewitnesses. After Doug's interview, we know there were a lot more locals and oil field workers at the crash site, which would tell me that some of these people are still alive. I'm withholding unique craft details to see if that would help verify any future claims as people come forward. Symbols Inside Aztec Crashed Disk MAY I ASK IF THIS INVOLVES SYMBOLS EITHER INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE CRAFT? Ye s . SO THE ISSUE WOULD BE WHETHER YOU CAN FIND PEOPLE WHO MIGHT INDEPENDENTLY BE ABLE TO DRAW SYMBOLS THAT MIGHT RELATE TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S WHO ACTUALLY SAW THEM INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE CRAFT? That is correct. Everybody, according to Doug and Ken who were there, commented and went up and looked at that symbol. WAS IT ONLY ONE? There were several. Where Is the Aztec Silver Disk Today? SCOTT, WHERE DO YOU THINK THE AZTEC DISK IS TODAY? Give me another year of research and I'll answer that intelligently because I've had some of the retired guys speculate where it was stored. WHERE DO YOU THINK? In the State of New Mexico. UNDERGROUND? It is now. WOULD IT BE A PLACE WE WOULD ALL RECOGNIZE? It would be a place where people drive by all the time and would not give it a second thought. HAVE YOU EVER TALKED WITH ANYONE WHO SAID THEY HAD WORKED FIRSTHAND INSIDE OR OUTSIDE AROUND THAT CRAFT? Not firsthand. Again, we have some good secondhand witnesses. One you and I talked about the other day a gentleman if I do a little more research in the next few days, I'll have some more information for you. He was a well-known cryptologist at the time. Before his death in 1972 remember, we are racing the undertaker - It's 56 years ago. Even if they were in their twenties or thirties at the time, they are all starting to get up in age. But in 1972, he told family members and close friends when the subject of UFOs came up, he said he had worked on trying to decipher the hieroglyphics that were on the Aztec crash"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"and said the word \"Aztec\" specifically. Not just a disk in New Mexico, but the Aztec UFO. HAS ANYBODY TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THE AZTEC CRAFT HAVING INTERIOR MOLDED CABINETS IN WHICH HUMAN AND ANIMAL PARTS WERE FOUND? I've heard that story over the years. I just have not interviewed anyone firsthand that witnessed that. As you know, I've talked to a gentleman retired from Air Force Intelligence and he and I have had several conversations. He was never at the crash site, but handled the daily intelligence reports on how the recovery was coming. I asked him about body parts being found in containers inside the Aztec disk. He had heard that, but did not believe it. He heard that after he left the Air Force. More rumor mill than anything else. IF TRUE, SCOTT, IT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS TRIED TO SUPPRESS ALL EVIDENCE ABOUT THE STRANGE EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITY LINK ON THIS PLANET. WHEN IT HAS COME TO AZTEC, NOTHING IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE EXISTED AND EVERYTHING SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ERASED. Let's look at it from a logical standpoint. If someone was visiting this planet from however light years away, look at what we do when we go to Mars and moon. We collect samples. It's logical that an expedition team came to this planet, they would probably want to leave with some type of samples. BUT THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES THOUSANDS OF ANIMALS WE KNOW HAVE BEEN AFFECTED. SO THIS APPEARS TO FALL INTO THE CATEGORY, AS PEOPLE HAVE TOLD ME, OF BEING A GENETIC HARVEST AS OPPOSED TO SAMPLING. Yes, it could be. IT COULD BE WHY AZTEC IS SO SENSITIVE. Going back and interviewing everybody the retired AF gentleman who worked on the daily intel reports. He feels that Aztec was so well kept a secret until recently because they had botched Roswell so badly. Putting it in the newspaper and then retracting the story and even up until a few years ago, they can't get their denial stories straight. Aztec was more clean. I think they had almost had time to prepare for 'another one.' They had a recovery operation, whether it was based in Colorado Springs or wherever (Interplanetary Unit, IPU) we're still declassifying records on that as we speak. There definitely was a retrieval group. They were more prepared for what would happen, whether a UFO, Soviet bomber, a satellite, a rocket booster, whatever. The Military at that point in the Cold War was very prepared to recover something in the utmost secrecy and sneak it to where they had to sneak it. One quick story I have to tell you: We were going through the classified records of one of these retrieval groups. In the mid-1950s, nine men in the former Soviet Union these are nine U. S. Air Force intel guys watched a rookie pilot botch a landing in a Soviet Mig. The pilot bailed out and the Mig went into a river. I'm going to give you the condensed version of a 48-page report. This group of guys in a period of two weeks disassembled a Mig under water and sneaked it out piece by piece in a hay wagon and that Mig ended up at Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio. While we were going through declassifying records, I went to Archie De Fontaine and said, 'Read this. This should be a made-for-TV movie.' At the end of it they were proud to say they recovered everything from the Mig, except the canopy, the pilot and the ejection seat. Now, if nine guys in the former Soviet Union can bring a Mig out of that country in a hay wagon in two weeks, what kind of group of well trained people on our own soil do with all the resources at their fingertips? AND IT'S ALL 'FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY,' WHETHER IT'S A CRAFT FROM ANOTHER SOLAR SYSTEM OR GALAXY OR A MIG FROM OUR ENEMY, THE SOVIET UNION, BACK THEN. HAVE ANY OF THESE PEOPLE WHO ALLEGED THEY HAD FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE, EITHER WITH TRYING TO BACK ENGINEER OR WORKING ON CRAFT OR TRYING TO DECIPHER SYMBOLS OR ANYONE WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH BODIES, ALIVE OR DEAD HAVE ANY OF THEM SAID TO YOU ON OR OFF THE RECORD WHAT THEY WERE TOLD ABOUT THE IMPLICATION OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES BEING HERE"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"FROM OUR GOVERNMENT'S POINT OF VIE? No, because my firsthand experience with anyone from the U. S. military has been very limited on the Aztec incident. The eyewitnesses that have come forward late in life, they were threatened and reminded of their patriotic duties and all those things we've heard over the years. But as far as anyone in the military the best witness I've had did not even work at the crash site. He worked behind the scenes on the intel reports, so that would not involve him at that point. WHAT DID HE SAY ABOUT THE DAILY REPORTS? Basically he was very compartmentalized. What his job was there were 200 (and he said he could remember that number pretty well because he was in charge of all the files) his job was to make sure of all the 200 people involved in whatever fashion of the (Aztec) recovery, to draw personnel files on a DAILY basis showing that they would never be in that area (covering up their work at Aztec with phony words about assignments in other parts of the country or world). The example he gave me when we met in 1999 was that if years later somebody would spout off and say, 'Hey, there was a crash at Aztec, or a recovery operation,' a quick check of their personnel files would show they were at McDill AFB during that time frame. These falsified records would also include notations such as , 'On Thursday, he sprained his ankle playing volleyball and was in the infirmary for two days.' So my source had essentially 200 personnel files to doctor during the entire recovery. TO COVER UP, TO MISINFORM, TO MAKE SURE NONE OF US WOULD HAVE ANY KIND OF SUCCESSFUL PAPER TRAIL TO THOSE PEOPLE. Exactly. \" More Information: Please see other Earthfiles reports about the alleged Aztec, New Mexico UFO crash and retrieval: · 10/20/2004 -- Pollok, Texas \"Chupa\": Strange Mammal or Mangy Coyote? · 08/18/2004 -- New Mexico Gov.
