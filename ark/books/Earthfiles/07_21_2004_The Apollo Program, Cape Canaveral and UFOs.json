Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 1 - The Apollo Program, Cape Canaveral and UFOs © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe July 21, 2004 DeLand, Florida - On June 21, 2004, I received an e-mail from Jim Oglesby, a writer and retired U. S. Postal Service letter carrier who had worked for Bendix Corporation as a machine tool technician in its contract with the Apollo program at Cape Canaveral, Florida. Apollo 11 was the first mission to put the American flag and human footprints on the moon. Its commander was aerospace engineer Neil A. Armstrong. The lunar module pilot was USAF Col. Buzz Aldrin and the command module pilot was USAF Lt. Col. Michael Collins. Left to right: 1969 Apollo 11 Commander Neil A. Armstrong; command module pilot USAF Lt. Col.

Navy from February 1962 to June 8, 1966, and spent time along the Vietnam coast. He did not see any unusual unexplained aerial phenomena in Vietnam, but during the 1960s around Cape Canaveral, he saw so many strange objects and beams in the sky - sometimes linked to the sudden, aggressive appearance of military helicopters and jets - Jim began to wonder if \"something big\" was going on between the U. S. government and whatever was in the unidentified objects that the public and media commonly lumped under the popular slang, \"UFOs.\" In an excerpt from his e-mail, Jim Oglesby wrote: \" I have kept a UFO story inside my brain since the initial UFO event that happened December 30, 1967. I think the time is now to bring it forward. In 1967, I was 27 and working at the Cape. I worked for Bendix. I was lucky in that way because the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) was just a stone's throw from the Bendix complex. Launch pad 39 set in the background. When an Apollo rocket roared off the pad on its way to the moon, all I had to do was step outside my office and watch the history-making moon mission Apollos. An experience that always touched me deeply. I was visiting my parents during New Year's Eve weekend 1967. At the time, my in-laws (who were also there) lived in a mobile home in Bithlo. Bithlo is about 32 miles west of the Cape. At the time the area was sparsely populated. Several ranches, a few homes, and a cluster of mobile dwellings made up the populace. Saturday night, December 30th, a cold front had settled over the state and temps were predicted to drop into the mid-forties. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Bithlo, Florida 32 miles west of Cape Canaveral Space Center. My brother-in-law and I were standing in the kitchen making coffee when an amber light reflected through the kitchen window that faced east. I reacted by throwing open the front door and staring outside expecting a meteor to hit the earth. Instead I watched an amber ball of light about the size of a basketball just hover momentarily in front of the mobile home and about a hundred feet east of the trailer. The amber ball then vanished, but before it did, I caught a glimpse of the outer rim and the silver metallic underside of a circular object before it vanished into the darkness. Moments later, a beam of cone-shaped infrared light shot out from the bottom of the mysterious object. The beam of light went off and on several times. I got the feeling that the extra-terrestrials were looking for a specific landing site. Then the object was joined by another object that came in from its right, obviously from another angle. The two objects dropped below the treeline and out of sight. Several minutes later, jets and choppers appeared and began combing the UFO hotspot area.\" There was a lot more in the e-mail and I asked for his phone number to follow up. On July 18, 2004, I talked with Jim Oglesby on the record about some of his many eyewitness experiences of unexplained objects - and sometimes even other human interaction with the phenomenon. The following are highlights from that discussion, illustrated with Jim's digital drawings, beginning with the New Year's Eve 1967 weekend in which he visited his brother-in-law, John, and his family at their mobile home in Bithlo, Florida, about 32 miles west of Cape Canaveral. Interview: Jim Oglesby, writer and retired U. S. Postal Service letter carrier 1977 to 1987; former machine tool technician for Bendix Corp.'s Cape Canaveral's Apollo 11 program in the 1960s; U. S. Navy in Vietnam from February 1962 to June 8, 1966, now living in DeLand, Florida: New Year's Eve Weekend December 30-31, 1967, Bithlo, Florida \"My brother-in-law, John, and I moved into the kitchen and he was making a fresh pot of coffee. His trailer faces north and south. He had a small kitchen window that faced east. Suddenly an amber, golden glow reflected through that small window. And when it did, I was probably standing about three feet from the front door and I leaped to the front door. I mean, I leaped! I swung it open and stood on the porch and looked up. At that time of the year, the moon just happened to be in a New Moon phase and it had already settled below the western horizon, so it was very dark outside. I looked up and saw an amber ball about the size of a football. I say amber ball, amber sphere, amber orb, and it seemed to be swirling with electrical properties. And as soon as I looked at it, it went out. WHY DID YOU THINK IT HAD ELECTRICAL PROPERTIES? Because inside of it, there was swirling, movement inside a confined area and it was like swirling around. It was not just an orange ball or orange orb. It was active inside of itself if that makes any sense."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"December 30, 1967, at approximately 7:10 p.m. ET, Jim Oglesby watched an unidentified aerial object fly over the mobile home of relatives on Sixth Street in Bithlo, Florida. Drawing © 2004 by James Oglesby. This was about 100 feet above his mobile home and about 100 feet east of where I was standing. Just as it went out - and there was no sound to this. It was very quiet. Just as it went out, I caught the outer rim of a circular object and the under belly of what seemed to be a silver metallic substance. Then it was just swallowed up by the darkness. MEANING THAT IT SEEMED TO BE EITHER FADING OUT OR DISAPPEARING? Yes. It just seemed to fade out. It must have been two or three seconds later, right directly east and in line of where that orange orb had seemingly vanished, I saw a red beam of light that came on and it went off, came back on again, went off, came back on and went off again. It was moving very swiftly and away from me because it was getting smaller as it moved. \" Moments later a beam of cone-shaped red light emitted from the bottom of the craft and flashed off and on several times as if preparing to land.\" Drawing © 2004 by James Oglesby. And then, there was darkness and I noticed a disk or round-shaped object and it had a row of red flashing lights around the middle of it. The lights were flashing in a right to left and left to right pattern. Within a second, another object moved up along the right of the first one and one rose and the other descended. Then they alternated their up and down motion and started dropping rather like a falling leaf below the tree line. I thought pretty sure that they were about to land on the ground. \" Then the craft paused just above the tree line, hovered and a pattern of red lights began flashing around the craft's midsection in a 5-4-3-2-1-1-2-3-4-5, right to left and left to right sequence. A second craft glided in from the right and hovered alongside its companion. The two UFO's then floated like two leaves caught on the wind until they disappeared from sight below the tree line.\" Drawing © 2004 by James Oglesby."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Then I see some more lights east and right well beyond where the two craft or objects had seemingly landed. They were getting closer and closer. Pretty soon, I could hear the familiar sound of blades thumping in the air and they were helicopters. There was a line of helicopters in a straight line formation and they were headed directly in the direction of where I had just watched the two objects land below the tree line. \"Within minutes a single-line formation of helicopters drew near the UFO hotspot.\" Drawing © 2004 by James Oglesby. Then I noticed two jets and I could hear the roar of the engines were coming in from the south and they crossed the area where I watched the two objects settle below the tree line. They were very, very low. I thought they were going to clip the top of the trees because they were so low. They banked on out and turned around and they banked back north and I could hear the roaring of the jet engines while I'm also watching the formation of helicopters. As it seemed like they were close to the spot (of the craft objects), they fanned out in a circle and they switched on these really brilliant lights. They were cone-shaped, they looked like search lights to me. They were flying around in a circle and the beams of light were really doing some aerial surgery on the ground below. \"Then the choppers fanned out before directing their bright funnel-shaped beams of light toward the ground. Moments later two jets flew low and over the area where the two UFOs had seemingly landed minutes earlier. Oddly, the helicopters and the two jets abandoned the area after a short time of concentrating on the dark terrain below their aircraft.\" Drawing © 2004 by James Oglesby. They were trying not to miss a spot. And they did that for probably a minute to a minute and a half. Then, oddly enough, they resumed their formation and headed back east, which I thought was very odd because I had just watched two objects settle below the tree line in the general area where they had approached. So, I thought that was very odd that the jets and helicopters would leave so prematurely. IT MAKES YOU WONDER WHAT THEY EITHER DID OR THOUGHT THEY DID THAT THEN WOULD GIVE THEM A REASON TO LEAVE? Yes, exactly. That ended the activity for the time being. This event happened around 7:10 p.m. that early evening and it was probably around 7:30 p.m. by the time the helicopters came in and the jets had gone around. And the jets did not go back around again. They made one pass across there, banked, turned back around and headed back to base. THE HELICOPTERS STAYED? The helicopters left, too. They resumed their formation and I watched them as they headed back in a more southeast direction toward what would have been Patrick AFB. It's around 7:30 p.m. and I'm standing on the porch and I did not move from that position for hours and hours. I stayed right there locked on that area and I don't know why, but I"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"did. And around 1:50 a.m., I'm looking straight out where the two craft had seemingly landed and one of the row of red flashing lights began to move above the trees. Once again, I could see a circular object from where I was and the row of red flashing lights were definitely right around the middle of this craft. And the red flashing lights were moving in a left to right, right to left pattern. As the craft rose, that row of red lights got faster and faster and faster as the craft continued to ascend. Then, it got up to an altitude and it began to change into a more glowing affect around the craft. Then, it paused and shot up again and then from where I was looking, it seemed to be about half the size of its original shape. WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF GLOW? Ve r y w h i t e . SO, IT WENT FROM RED LIGHTS THAT WERE ROTATING RAPIDLY TO ALL WHITE? Yes. When it rose to a certain position, as it was rising to a higher altitude, I could see the white starting to fill in the area where the red lights were, as if it were changing vibrations or fading. The red lights seemed to be fading out as the white became more prominent. It paused. Then it went up in several very quick ascending spurts, and then it just hovered there and looked like a star in the sky, except it was definitely very brilliant and larger than you would think of a star. It sat there for a second. And then the eastern horizon lit up in a very white-orangish-golden color. And it fanned all across the eastern horizon. \"At approximately 1:50 a.m. New Year's Eve, one of the UFOs began rising above the dark topography until the mysterious intruder had climbed high enough to take on the appearance of a star.\" Drawing © 2004 by James Oglesby. Minuteman II Missile Launched from Cape Canaveral Moments later, a missile come up and you could see it rising in the air and it got up maybe 50 degrees above the horizon. The star-like UFO zipped over to the left and came right up what looked to me to be very close to the rocket. It hovered there and then shot back over to the right and then it did a falling leaf pattern in the sky and then it shot off to the right and paused. Then it was gone. WHEN YOU SAY MISSILE OR ROCKET, ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT A LAUNCH OF ONE OF OUR SHUTTLES FROM CAPE CANAVERAL? I'm talking about a Minute Man II rocket. I found out it was a Minute Man II missile that was launched from one of the launch complexes. There were two they launched from and that is what happened."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\" Suddenly, the eastern horizon exploded in brilliant orange and white light as a Minuteman 2 missile launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station climbed swiftly above the Cape. The UFO then flew up alongside the fast-moving rocket momentarily, before it zipped to the right before pausing, drifted down like a falling leaf, then shot to the right and vanished.\" Drawing © 2004 by James Oglesby. I'm going to jump ahead and we can come back to this point.... but in April of 1968, the New Year, I was over at my parents on Easter weekend. I'm sitting in the living room and opened up what was then the Orlando Evening Star newspaper. It is no longer. It is now not in operation, but back then it was part of the Orlando Sentinel . I was going through the newspaper and found a special edition and pulled it and about flipped out! I said, 'I wasn't crazy!' It said, \"UFO Tracks Minuteman Missile Over Cape Canaveral\" and gave the date and approximate time. DO YOU HAVE THIS NEWSPAPER? It ran in the UPI (United Press International) press and I believe the gentleman who wrote the article was Dick Young. He's no longer alive. I think he was a PR rep for Kennedy Space Center, but he had something to do with some of the operations because he was certainly aware of this launch because someone had blabbed and it had become leaked. HOW OFTEN WERE THEIR MISSILE LAUNCH EXERCISES AROUND CAPE CANAVERAL? That is interesting you should mention that because I did some research and found out that I contacted a historian, Mark Wade, over at the Cape. He's been keeping up with all the launches. I e-mailed him and asked him how many Minuteman launches had there been and specifically, over the Cape. He said, 'For Minuteman I, II and III there were exactly 92 launches.' I said, 'But there is only 91 listed in your chronology.' He said, 'I don't know why that would be.' I went back and researched and came up with only 91. The last one that was launched I have the date here but I believe it was in November 1967. That was the last Minuteman launch from Cape Canaveral. THAT THEY HAVE OFFICIALLY LISTED. Officially listed. So, I thought, 'Why would they not list that 1967 New Year's Eve launch? And what an odd time to launch a missile, you know? YES, WAS IT TRULY AN EXERCISE OR WAS IT INTENT UPON INTERACTING WITH WHATEVER THIS OBJECT WAS THAT ROSE BACK FROM THE GROUND AND UP INTO THE SKY? I think I would lean toward your implication because I've never heard of a launch going on a night like this New Year's Eve weekend. DID YOU EVER GET TO HEAR OR LEARN ANYTHING MORE OFF THE RECORD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED? OK, I found a website and at this time, I won't use the name because he asked that I not use his name because evidently he worked during the Apollo program and was a very high profile employee of NASA. He rubbed elbows with some of the astronauts and was very familiar with some of the Minuteman launches. I e-mailed him and I gave him the December 30, 1967 event. He did not e-mail me until a couple of weeks later. Then he said, 'I had to think about contacting you because of the sensitivity of this matter that is still ongoing about our Minuteman rockets and UFOs.' He also said, 'I know you are not lying because I know of the incident.' He said at the time,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"'his group' as he referred to it was well aware of the incident that I wrote about in my e-mail. He said, 'But not to the degree of detail that you shared with me in your letter.' So it was known at the time. AMONG PEOPLE WHO WORKED AT CAPE CANAVERAL. Who worked at the Cape, yes. DID HE TELL YOU ANY INFORMATION THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW? You mean about that night? RIGHT, ABOUT THE OBJECT, ABOUT THE MISSILE, ABOUT THE JETS, THE HELICOPTERS? No, he said they had only known from what he heard that the missile had been launched and its telemetry had locked onto the object. That was their take on it. Somebody had gone out and done a visual on the UFO and saw it from their perspective. The tracking and telemetry that works with the missile while it's going up locked, moved onto the UFO. I guess everyone at the launch control, whoever was in charge of destroying the rocket, they didn't know what to do because they couldn't - their rocket integrity had been compromised. But evidently, it was on it for only a few seconds, and I can confirm that, and I was actually watching it as it moved away from the rocket. AND THE PART THAT COULD ALWAYS BE HIDDEN FROM THE PUBLIC AND THE MEDIA THAT THERE HAD ACTUALLY BEEN A LOCK-ON INTERCHANGE BETWEEN A MINUTEMAN MISSILE OFF CAPE CANAVERAL WITH AN UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECT? Correct. AND WHY? Exactly. Why? - is still a mystery. This is the one out of all the UFO Minuteman missile- related events this one here is yet to surface publicly. Blue Flashing Light and Disturbed Cattle on February 27, 1969 On Feb. 27, 1969, I returned to the corner of Fort Christmas Road and State Road 420, parked there again where I'd been two prior nights. And it's getting about dark and I'm facing east and I'm looking across a field and there are probably 25 or 30 cattle that have been grazing and kind of huddled together in the corner by this fence. I'm standing there and all of a sudden, the cattle get up and start running sort of like in a circle. I look up and there is a flashing blue light. It's right above the field, probably 40 or 50 feet above the field and maybe a couple hundred feet away from me and it's sitting there flashing. then it goes out and here comes a jet just as low above the tree line as it could, comes flying in right over that spot right where the flashing blue light was, roared right across, banked out to the left, and went back to the base. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CATTLE? The cattle were going crazy. Then the flashing blue light returned right back in the same spot that it was where the jet went over. It stood there and hovered and flashed for three or four seconds and I'm standing there looking at it. then I get back in my car, and it leaves. I write it down as an experience. YOU DID NOT SEE A DIRECT EXCHANGE OF A BEAM OF LIGHT COMING OUT OF THE BLUE OBJECT DOWN TOWARD THE CATTLE AT ANY POINT? No, I did not. It was definitely above them sitting there. Have you seen those 4th of July sparklers? SURE . If you take one of those and fill it full of blue with just a lithe bit of white in it and have it flashing on and off, that's kind of what it reminded me of. It was not very brilliant. It did not affect a lot of the area around it. It was contained. After I leave there, I drive down Old Fort Christmas Road, probably a couple hundred yards and pull off the road and park my car. I'm sitting there and all of a sudden, I look up and I could barely hear a noise and I'm looking up and can barely see in the darkness I almost had a heart attack! This huge, huge aircraft rose up just above the tree line and as"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"soon as it came up to where I could see it, I recognized it right away as a B-52. I knew that right away. All of a sudden, I could hear the pilots did something with the engine because it labored and then banked to the left and then below the B-52, out near the front of it, came this brilliant light that looked like it would light up a football field. It went swish, swish, swish... a sequence of three flashes four times. Lights underneath came out from underneath the B-52 as it was moving very slowly just above the treetops. It shot out this sequence of brilliant flashes of light and I counted 12 of them, but they were in three sequence intervals. AS FAR AS I KNOW IN TERRESTRIAL AVIONICS, THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A B-52 THAT COULD JUST CREEP OVER TREES SLOWLY. I'm telling you, when I say slowly, that's been 30 some years ago I can go back and visualize that. I know for a fact, it was just above treetop level. This thing is going to cut off the top of the trees and moving very slow. Then it made a turn and the engines kind of labored and then it did the sequence of lights. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IT WAS SOMETHING MIMICKING WHAT A B-52 MIGHT LOOK LIKE? I went back and did a lot of research on the various B-52 models and what they do on their night reconnaissance stuff. I can get that info later on. What I gathered from the research, this could have possibly happened. Let me go a little further. The next night, I'm back in that same spot, and I'm parked there and a car pulls up beside me and rolls down a window and says, 'What are you doing out here?' I said, 'Do you really want to know the truth?' He said, 'Yes, I do.' I didn't know who he was at the time. I said, 'Well, do you believe in UFO?' His wife kind of snickered because she was with him. I related to him what had just happened the night before. Because I was in that same location at about the same time and he just happened to come along about that time, guess what popped up over the tree line no sooner than I had told him what I had seen the night before that I thought was a B-=52. ANOTHER BLUE LIGHT? A repeat of the night before with the B-52 and the lights. OH, NOT THE BLUE LIGHT, BUT THE B-51.. No, the B-52. IT WAS NOT THE BLUE LIGHT FLASHING. IT LOOKED LIKE THE B-52 COMING BACK OVER THE TREES AND FLASHING A SEQUENCE OF BRIGHT LIGHTS THAT WERE WHITE AND FLASHED THEM IN A SEQUENCE THAT WOULD BE FOUR FLASHES A PAUSE, FOUR ... No, three. A sequence of three and an interval between each sequence of three flashes. SO IT WAS 12 FLASHES SEPARATED INTO THREES? Yes. Definitely as clear today to me. DID THOSE LIGHTS LIGHT UP AS BRIGHT AS DAYLIGHT ALL OF THE GROUND? Ye s . THEN WHAT HAPPENED? Then the farmer he got very still. He says, 'That's my property where that just happened,' is the way he put it. He said, 'You're talking about UFOs. Let me tell you what just happened a short while ago, just a few weeks ago. I had a young heifer which was one of my favorite little calves, so I had her in this nice elaborate pen to keep her in because she had a habit of jumping out. So I built it up high enough to where there was no way she could get out. I was awakened one morning by a sound that sounded like a calf in distress. I walked outside and found the calf out of the pen standing in the middle of the road.' He said, 'I thought that was the oddest, most strange thing because there was no way that cow could have gotten out of her pen.' I asked him, 'Have you been missing any cattle lately?' I had no idea where I was stepping."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"He looked at me and said, 'We have been missing so many cattle that we've had to have ongoing meetings with the Florida Cattlemen's Association because the cattle have been missing left and right and we have caught only a few rustlers could not in any way account for the epidemic of cattle that we've had missing around here.' That's the way he put it. ANY REPORTED CATTLE MUTILATIONS? One afternoon, either in March 1968 or April, I had two buddies come out with me one afternoon. We had driven down past the corner of State Road 420 and Old Fort Christmas Road (near small town called Christmas, Florida). There is another road called Brown Road and we had drove down to the end of it. At that time in 1968, it dead ended and there were some fruit trees hanging over the fence. So, I'm standing on my buddy's shoulder and we're picking off some fruit off this tree. And this car pulls up and I said, 'Oh, no, we're in trouble.' But the car driver said, 'Don't worry. Go ahead and have some fruit.' So we started talking and I mentioned UFOs and he says, 'You know what, back about 4 years ago we found a heifer out on our spread out here and I don't know why anybody would do this, but the animal was our most friendly and one of our most the animal was just in the best of health. And we found the mouth open. We looked inside and the tongue had been removed. He said, 'It was like as if somebody had come in with some special surgical tools and removed the tongue.' He said it was so precise and it has always been a mystery. That ended the conversation. THAT WAS 1964 AND THE TONGUE WAS REMOVED. Ye s . \" Worldwide Animal Mutiations As occurred in Florida in the 1960s, unusual deaths of cattle and other domestic and wild animals with the same pattern of excisions have been reported by media around the world since the 1960s. Removal of the tongue vertically deep within the throat, often along with the trachea and esophagus, has long been associated with classic \"animal mutilations,\" a phrase originally used by ranchers and sheriffs. The typical animal mutilation includes excisions of an ear and eye on the same side of the head; the bone-clean removal of hide and tissue from that side of the head or the entire lower jaw; removal of udder and vulva in females and removal of penis and testicles in males; and coring out of rectal tissue in nearly all animals, regardless of age or gender. 1976 Sterling, Colorado cow was typical of so many: circular excision of tissue around eye, eyeball removed from socket, tongue excised from deep within throat, jaw stripped of all flesh, smooth excision of upper jaw bone and teeth. Dead only hours, animals like this were warm to touch when sheriffs reached the scene. Photograph by Logan County, Colorado Sheriff Tex Graves. In his 1998 book The Day After Roswell, U. S. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso (now deceased) wrote on pages 180 -181: \"In the Pentagon from 1961 to 1963, I reviewed field reports from local and state police agencies about the discoveries of dead cattle whose carcasses looked as though they had been systematically mutilated and reports from people who claimed to have been abducted by aliens and experimented on. ... Local police reported that when veterinarians were called to the scene to examine the dead cattle left in fields, they often found evidence not just that the animal's blood had been drained, but that entire organs were removed with such surgical skill that it couldn't have been the work of predators or vandals removing the organs for some depraved ritual. ... We had no medical instruments that even remotely approached what the aliens could do. It was as though some device had simply excised the organs with techniques that even went beyond our own surgical precision. ... It was the EBEs (extraterrestrial biological entities) who were experimenting with organ harvesting ...\" "},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Continued in Part 2 More Information: See An Alien Harvest and Glimpses of Other Realities, Volumes I and II at Earthfiles Shop.
