Stewart, Georgia © 2005 by Linda Moulton Howe B ody lifted upward in light beam, Hinesville, Georgia, near Fort Stewart and Hunter Army Air Field (HAAF), in April 1974. Drawing by Derek Smith. October 7, 2005 Savannah and Hinesville, Georgia - Glowing beams which can lift and lower people have also been described in the modern age of the human abduction syndrome that was first reported in the 1960s. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso (Ret.) wrote in his best-selling book, The Day After Roswell, that the U. S. government knew by the 1950s that extraterrestrials were mutilating animals, abducting humans and interfering with military weapons and communication systems. Lt. Col. Corso: \"It was the UFOs, alien spacecraft thinking themselves invulnerable and invisible as they soared around the edges of our atmosphere, swooping down at will to destroy our communications with EMP bursts, buzz our spacecraft, colonize our lunar surface, mutilate cattle in their own horrendous biological experiments, and even abduct human beings for their medical tests and hybridization of the species. And what was worse, we had to let them do it because we had no weapon to defend ourselves.\" Another former U. S. Army man was an attack helicopter pilot who had the unnerving experience of watching what he thought was a person rising in a beam of light into a round, glowing object that hovered above the ground not far from a drive-in movie theater where he and his wife were watching a movie. He also heard about Men In Black (MIBs) threatening a police officer. Derek Smith (real name withheld at his request) entered the U. S. Army in 1966. By 1970, he was in Vietnam and told me, \"I started working with a group called CCN (Command and Control North) MAG-V-SOG (Military Assistance Group Vietnam Special Operations Group). It was a Special Forces Unit. We conducted special classified missions. That was my first exposure to the secret world of special operations and the beginning of an exciting twenty-five year career as an investigator in military intelligence.\" Smith retired in June 1992, but prior to that in 1973, he was stationed at Hunter Army Airfield (HAAF) in Savannah, Georgia. The next year he was reassigned to Fort Stewart, located near Hinesville, Georgia. I talked with him about his military experiences prior to seeing the strange disc-shaped light, beam and what looked like a human body rising inside the beam. F ort Stewart and Hunter (Wright) Army Air Field form a military complex between Hinesville and Savannah, Georgia. It is the home of the 3rd Infantry Division of the United States Army. Hunter's 11,375 ft long runway (the longest on the east coast) supports the installation's rapid deployment needs as any aircraft, including the C-5 Galaxy, can land at Hunter. It also has a unique distinction as being identified as an alternate landing site for NASA's space shuttles. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"1973 - Hunter Army Airfield (HAAF), Savannah, Georgia DS: \"While serving with A Company, 75th Rangers, I co-authored the U. S. Army's first desert warfare and survival manual. The research behind that work required us to operate and live in the desert for approximately six months. During that period, we also instructed other U. S. Army personnel in desert warfare tactics. As a result of the success of this operation, I was given an experimental platoon of soldiers which had no formal military training other than Basic Training. The Pentagon directed me to instruct the platoon in Special Forces and Ranger skills as well as special warfare tactics. The war in Vietnam was at an end and I think the Army was searching for new ways to train fresh soldiers. The idea was to take a group of new soldiers and maximize their training in the shortest period of time to be useful in special operations work.\" Howe: \"And what would be an example of the special ops work then?\" DS: \"Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol (LRRP) teams working far behind enemy lines.\" Howe: \"Working as soldiers under the direction of U. S. intelligence agencies?\" DS: \"Right.\" Howe: \"Did you ever work directly for the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)?\" DS: \"Absolutely.\" Howe: \"If the CIA was your Special Ops boss prior to the 1973 incident, had you been on any special operations group activity that involved moving lights, UFOs, alien beings, anything like that?\" DS: \"I don't know about the alien beings or UFOs. However, I flew several missions in Vietnam which involved us intentionally chasing strange lights in the sky over rugged mountain terrain. These lights were a dull red color and were impossible to catch up to. No one ever told us what they were.\" Howe: \"So your first unusual experience in the United States was at HAAF in Savannah in 1973?\" DS: \"Right. I had a second job to make more money to help support my family and I was returning to the base after my second job around 11:30 PM. I came into the main gate and stopped my vehicle. I had a procedure that I always did so I didn't get in trouble on the base with a loaded weapon. I would always stop at the gate and inform the military police officer (MP) on duty at the gate that I was going to unload my weapon. The MP would acknowledge that and I would unfasten my weapon, unload it and proceed through the gate to my quarters. But this night when I got to the gate, it was different. The MP freaked out! He was afraid and I thought he was going to shoot me. \"So I said, 'Hey, you know me!' And he said, 'Yeah, I know who you are, but don't unload your weapon.' \"I asked, 'Why not?' \"He said, 'Keep it with you, keep it loaded. You have to go to the MP station. The Provost Marshal wants to see you as soon as possible.' \"So I drove from the Main Gate to the MP station which was about a half a mile away, parked, and started walking toward the front door. It was warm outside and I could see the main door was opened all the way to allow the breeze to flow in through the screen door. Inside at the MP Station, the Desk Sergeant was sitting at a high, wooden podium with his .45 caliber semi-automatic pistol out, cocked and loaded, pointed right at me when I walked in. I could see his hands were trembling. \"He said, 'Goddamn, sir, I almost killed you! I thought you were one of them!' \"I said, 'One of who?' \"And he said, 'I can't tell you any more.' He was shaking. His eyes were big. I could tell that he was very frightened. Then he said, 'You have to stay here because the PM ordered me to keep you here until he arrives.'"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"I said, 'Have I done something wrong?' \"And he answered, 'No, but you have to stay here.'\" Howe: \"Did you know the Provost Marshal?\" DS: \"Yes, we were the only officers left on the base at the time. The base was in the process of being shut down. The base hospital was being torn down. The BOQ (bachelor officer quarters) had placed us in one duplex that shared a kitchenette and bath so that the other BOQ rooms could be disassembled. I also did a favor for the PM and had been training the remaining MPs in unarmed defense tactics.\" Howe: \"So the Provost Marshal knew you would be returning to the base and wanted to keep you from walking into a dangerous situation?\" DS: \"Right.\" Howe: \"Did you ever get an explanation from the PM about who the THEY were?\" DS: \"No. I was concerned because these people were frightened and I didn't know why they were frightened.\" Howe: \"So at that point all you knew was a dangerous situation surrounded you some how?\" DS: \"Yes. And in my mind, I'm thinking sabotage, terrorists. Then the Provost Marshal pulled up and I went out to meet him. I walked up to his car door and said, 'OK, I'm here. What's going on?' He said, 'Get in the car.'\" \"So I walked around to the passenger side and got in the car with him and he asked me, 'Are you armed?' And I said, 'Yeah, I haven't had a chance to put my weapon up. What's going on?'\" \"He said, 'Good. Keep your weapon and go with me.'\" \"We drove away from the MP station and headed to the BOQ because he wanted to get his binoculars. While he was inside, I was curious about a row of street lights which were in a line that passed the BOQ and headed toward the airfield but seemed to be a slightly different color. The regular lights were dull white with an orange tint. I could see a light that seemed to have more orange and red in it and it was larger.\" \"When the PM came back out, he asked, 'What are you looking at?'\" \"I pointed and said, 'That street light looks odd.'\" \"He said, 'Well, that's not a street light. That's why we are out here.' And then the light disappeared. \"We got back in the car and drove out to a little boat dock in a marsh where the Savannah River comes through there. I could see one of the interstates that went around half of the base perimeter. It looked like a bridge because it was built on a swamp and had to be raised very high. It made a great observation platform overlooking the base. And up there, I could see a long line of law enforcement vehicles with blue lights flashing on them. I counted twenty-six of them from city, county and state.\" \"I asked the Provost Marshal, 'What is going on here? Is this some kind of drug bust or did prisoners escape from prison or what?'\" \"And he said, 'No, they're watching the base.'\" \"I asked why and he said, 'Do you remember that light that you were looking at that you thought was a street light? That's not a street light. I don't know what it is, but there are a lot of them here tonight. They have been flying down the base runway at low level, about six at a time in a V-formation. And they've been hovering over the atomic storage area.'\" \"And I said, 'Yeah, right!'\" \"The PM said, 'No, there really is something going on.'\" Howe: \"Did you ask him what was flying the formations?\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"DS: \"No, I was really confused. The PM and I were friends, we trusted each other, but I could see in his face that he was having a hard time believing what was going on. I saw all the police cars and knew the Desk Sergeant had almost shot me, so everyone was afraid of something.\" Howe: \"And one of the two MPs that were interviewed on television about being run off the road by a UFO got transferred into your attack helicopter unit?\" DS: \"Yeah. I don't remember as what because he was an MP! They just transferred him in there. I remember one day at lunch time I decided to stay in the office to talk with him. I wanted to help him somehow because he was really depressed over the treatment he had received and the transfer out of the MPs. He had tears in his eyes and was crying and he said, 'I don't do drugs. Why did they lie about me? I'm a good person. I'm not a drug addict or drunk. Why did they do that?'\" Howe: \"He was betrayed by his own Army.\" DS: \"Yes, he didn't understand. I befriended him because he was a good person and I felt sorry for him.\" Howe: \"What did he tell you about being run off the road by a UFO?\" DS: \"He told me that he and the other guy were on radar to watch for speeders on the back road. He was the driver and he was watching his radar equipment and his buddy in the passenger side of the car was reading a book. It was late at night and nothing going on. Then the radar started acting up and he caught out of the corner of his eye a light, looked up and saw this huge saucer-shaped thing the size of a house moving toward him at treetop level. It was black with multi-colored lights. And they were different colored lights. I think he did say that the colors were in a certain spectrum like white and orange that flashed in sequence around the entire perimeter rim of the thing. Above the rim, he saw what looked like windows. And he said it didn't make any noise whatsoever. \"This thing was moving slowly at treetop level and just barely missed the top of the police cruiser. They got scared and were trying to get back to the base. They got up to over 100 m.p.h. and the thing was actually chasing them and then passed their vehicle - like maybe to head them off and stopped in front of them and started coming down lower like it was maybe going to land and block their path. They did a quick turn around in the road and headed back the other direction and this thing was giving chase and he said he was scared to death. The next thing he knew, they were sitting in the ditch. That's all he could remember.\" S eptember 9, 1973, Associated Press article as it appeared in The Atlanta Journal and Constitution. Howe: \"Did the MPs then get in touch with the base commander or the police? What happened?\" "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"DS: \"While they were driving, he requested assistance as an officer in trouble. And the MP station listening to his radio calls would have been the one that called the city police.\" Howe: \"Did he describe being debriefed by any intelligence, civilian or otherwise?\" DS: \"No.\" Howe: \"The only thing he knew was that the next day he was on national TV and his own Army was castigating him.\" DS: \"Right. A few days later, I spoke with one of the Chatham County Police Officers that had observed the events at the base from his vantage point on one of the state highways. He said he saw strange lights flying in formation over HAAF. But when I pressed him for more details, he said, 'Look, I don't know who you are and I don't want to talk about this anymore.'\" \"So I said, 'What's the problem? Were you told you couldn't talk about it by military intelligence?' He said, 'No, I drove home after work that night. I only live about seventeen miles away and there were two guys in black suits at my house when I went into the driveway.' They just matter of fact told him that he was not to discuss anything he saw flying around the base that night. If he did, he and his family would be killed. And that's the only information I got from him.\" Howe: \"What was your reaction to such a dramatic statement?\" DS: \"I believed him.\" Howe: \"Do you have any idea who those black-suited men were?\" DS: \"No. But the work I had done before with Special Operations, you learn a lot through osmosis. And I just believed that what he told me was true and that people might actually kill you and your family to keep something shut up.\" Howe: \"You mean CIA types?\" DS: \"I don't know. I just know the possibility was there.\" Howe: \"Was there any more information from anyone else who was there that night?\" DS: \"A policeman buddy of mine. He was the first one on the scene at the MP car that was off the road. And he told me that he walked up to the car that was in a ditch. He could see the two MPs sitting in the car not moving and he thought they were dead. He had his flashlight and looked into the driver's side and discovered they weren't dead, but were just scared to death, frozen there. He asked them what was going on because he couldn't see any threat around them and he didn't see them shot full of holes or anything. The guys couldn't give him an answer, they couldn't talk coherently. He said they were so scared they were just mumbling. \"Then about the same time, a black sedan pulled up on the opposite side of the road. It was driven by a man in U.S. Army dress green uniform wearing an overcoat and Specialist rank. He got out of the car, went to the back passenger door and opened it. Sitting there was a man in a black suit. That man handed the uniformed man a piece of paper. The Specialist walked over to the policeman standing by the MP car and handed him the piece of paper and said, 'This is your report. This is what you will write and nothing else.' Then the guy in uniform walked back over to the sedan, got inside and pulled away. \"My friend said the paper was just nonsense, like a prowler had been in the area and had nothing to do with the actual event.\" Howe: \"A made-up story handed to the Savannah police officer implying that without any explanation it was assumed he would take orders from an unidentified man in a black car?\" DS: \"Yeah! I don't think they understand civilian police very well.\" Howe: \"What did he do?\" DS: \"Well, my friend wrote a report about what the two MPs had actually told him and filed the report at the Savannah Police Station. He also told me a few days later"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"that he decided to get a copy of his report and it wasn't there. All reports have a unique identification number called a Case Report Number (CRN). It's an eleven digit number that includes the date. For example, if a report was written on the first day of June 1996, and it was the first case for the month of June, the case number would be CRN - 9906010001. So, my friend was handed a copy of a report with his original CRN number. However, instead of a full report on an 8 1/2 x 11 form, it was on an Incident Card. This is a small card that is used for reporting dogs barking, suspicious vehicles, unsubstantiated prowler calls. The card had some nonsense written on it. The scary thing was that my friend's actual signature was on the card, but he never signed that card and it wasn't his report.\" Howe: \"Did he go to the Chief of Police at that moment?\" DS: \"No. You don't do things like that. It doesn't go anywhere.\" Howe: \"Well, someone had to have access to the records.\" DS: \"I'm not saying the Chief didn't know. It's possible that he did know.\" Howe: \"OK, this MP encounter was the end of August or first of September 1973. What was the date of the next event at the drive-in with your wife?\" ontinued in Part 2 Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
