The first die off was 200,000 menhaden and other freshwater fish. Then this past week, another half million were found floating belly up and piled along the creek banks. This brings the total for July in just those two tributaries to over 700,000 dead fish the Chesapeake's worst fish kill in a decade. Maryland Governor Parris Glendening and other officials are trying to sort out the cause. So far, tests indicate that the part animal/part plant dinoflagellate called Pfiesteria is NOT involved. Pfiesteria eats the flesh of fish producing large, round sores and affects the nervous system so that the fish swim in circles and upside down. No fish found this past week had such lesions. The culprit this time seems to be lack of dissolved oxygen caused by severe drought along the Eastern seaboard. Phosphorous and nitrogen from fertilizer and pesticide runoffs have built up in shallow estuaries, causing algae blooms that take oxygen from the water and leave fish gasping for air. Global Warming In other environmental news, computer projections of earth's climate keep showing the same trend: the next ten years could warm up as much as the world has warmed in the last 100 years. Such an increase in the rapidity of global warming has a variety of consequences both predictable and unpredictable. For example, there are few if any icebergs in the Grand Banks shipping lanes off Newfoundland. The Monterey California Bay Institute reports that since 1992, there has been a huge decline in salmon on the Pacific Coast. Plus, they're smaller and have less fat. California will have more rain and more coast flooding as computers project that sea levels will rise by one to three feet around North America in the next 100 years. New York City could also suffer repeated flooding, soaking subways and turning parts of Brooklyn into wetlands, according to a recent Environmental Defense Fund and Columbia University study. New projections of global warming indicate it might be even slightly worse than originally forecast. Instead of one to six degrees Fahrenheit increase in average global temperature, new computer projections show a two to seven degree increase, according to the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. To put that one more degree increase into perspective that one degree equals the entire amount of rise in average "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"global temperature over the last century. Scientists are more and more convinced that all this is happening because 20th Century industries have put greenhouse gasses into the earth's atmosphere, creating a kind of blanket around the world which holds in heat. Link Between Epidemics and Warm Ocean Surface Temperatures In last week's journal Science , researchers at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland reported the first confirmed link between warm ocean surface temperatures in the Pacific and Indian oceans with epidemics of Rift Valley Fever in Africa. That disease is hemorrhagic meaning that affected animals and people vomit blood and bleed from body orifices. Goddard senior earth scientist, Dr. Compton Tucker, says: \"We feel the links between ocean warming and Rift Valley Fever are solid and the associations are clear.\" The warming of ocean waters begins with El Nino in the Pacific which produces more rain in parts of Africa. More rain means more mosquitoes such as the Aedes macintoshi and others which can carry the Rift Valley Fever virus. Photo Credit: Aedes mosquito, a species that carries different viruses, including the virus responsible for Rift Valley Fever which causes hemorrhaging and can be fatal. Some of those insect eggs already have the viral disease in them when the rains come. After hatching, the infected mosquitoes bite goats, cattle and other animals to drink blood and spread the Rift Valley Fever hemorrhagic virus to animals and people. There were serious epidemics of the virus in the mid-1970s and again twenty years later in the mid-1990s. Dr. Tucker says the epidemics are directly linked to periods of abnormally high rainfall. Interview: Compton Tucker, Ph.D., Senior Earth Scientist (Satellite Studies of Ecology and Biology), NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland 20771: \"It is the rainfall which triggers the hatching of the mosquitoes and we simply use satellite data to study large areas in Africa to identify when those periods of abnormally high rainfall occur. In the course of that study, we determined that this was actually driven for large scale events by a concurrent or simultaneous sea surface temperature warming in the Indian Ocean and in the Tropical Pacific. The Tropical Pacific situation we know as El Nino. When that is coupled with a very high sea surface temperature situation in the Indian Ocean when both of these areas are dancing to the same tune we have periods of very high rainfall and we have outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever in Africa."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"NOW HOW DOES THE RIFT VALLEY FEVER DIFFER FROM EBOLA? Well, in the case of Ebola, if you've read The Hot Zone or have seen that movie with Dustin Hoffman that dealt with something like Ebola or the Marburg virus. Those are very virulent and nasty hemorrhagic fevers with a high degree of mortality in people who are infected. In the case of Rift Valley Fever that is also a hemorrhagic fever - it is much less dangerous than Ebola or Marburg. Its primary effect is on the animal population sheep, goats, cattle, camels, animals like that. But during virulent periods in east and southern Africa, it can jump from the animal population into people and cause a fairly high degree of mortality as well. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY CASES IN WHICH PEOPLE TRAVELING FROM THE U. S. OR EUROPE TO AFRICA HAVE CONTRACTED RIFT VALLEY FEVER AND BROUGHT IT BACK TO THE U. S., FOR EXAMPLE? During serious outbreaks of Rift Valley Fever, which on average occur every 8 to 10 years, and as we report in our paper this occurs when you have these very unusual periods of rainfall which we're able to predict with satellite data of sea surface temperatures. And we then confirm that with satellite data which we collect every day over Africa to double check on our predictions. To my knowledge, no one has returned to the U. S. with Rift Valley Fever, but I'm sure it's probably happened. During some of the serious Rift Valley outbreaks, thousands of people have perished, unfortunately. WHAT RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF GLOBAL OCEAN SURFACE TEMPERATURES IS SHOWING UP IN SATELLITE DATA IN TERMS OF ANY WARMING? At the moment we are in what is called a La Nina which is the opposite of El Nino which means you have COOLER than normal sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific. This tends to cause dry periods in southern and eastern South America as well as other areas. At the moment, this is not too pronounced, although everyone is watching with great curiosity and interest in case it might develop into something more serious. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS TIE BETWEEN WARMING OCEANS AND HEALTH SEEMS TO IMPLY THAT IT MIGHT EXTEND TO DISEASES BEYOND THE RIFT VALLEY FEVER. IS THAT CORRECT? Ebola : Yes, that's correct. I'm working with a graduate student on a new paper and we're looking at the cluster of Ebola outbreaks in Equatorial Africa in the mid-1970s. Things were then very quiet for 20 years until the mid-1990s, 1994-95, when you had a series of Ebola outbreaks again. These are very curious events. By using satellite data, we are able to get an idea and to study these widely different areas objectively. If we didn't have satellite data, these studies would be very difficult to do. Hanta Virus: We're also looking at some other ecologically or climatically connected diseases such as the Hanta virus which occurs in the southwestern U. S. This is also hemorrhagic fever, it's linked to very wet periods following dry periods when you have an outbreak of the rodents apparently which are the hosts, or are implicated in the spread of the disease. That is one disease which does effect the U. S. and which I think satellite data should be very useful to identify when these outbreaks will occur and then to identify more specifically the actual areas which will be affected. IT WOULD SEEM THAT WHAT'S EMERGING FROM YOUR WORK IS SOMETHING LIKE LONG TERM HEALTH FORECASTS, SIMILAR TO WEATHER FORECASTS. Malaria, Dengue and Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis : Well, you can probably think of it as a subset of the weather forecast. There are several"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"diseases such as the Hanta virus, Ebola, Rift Valley Fever, perhaps malaria, dengue and other diseases which we don't have in the U. S. fortunately such as Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis. These diseases appear to be directly and unequivocally coupled with climate and with weather abnormalities. And so by having more accurate weather forecasts and also having a time history of information back over the past 20 or 30 years, you are then able to identify what the circumstances were that were associated with the outbreaks of these diseases from their respective outbreak locations. And then apply that in the future. THE CONDITIONS COULD VARY FROM EITHER NEEDING A LOT OF MOISTURE OR DRYNESS? They could. For example, in the case of Ebola it looks like it may be triggered by a period of very wet conditions followed by a period over several years of very dry conditions. It could easily be one way or the other. It just depends on what the vectors or hosts are (mosquitoes are one type of host in which the viruses spread) and what triggers their jump from their host into the vector (infected animals) and then into the human population. ARE THERE EXAMPLES IN THE 1990S WHERE YOUR WORK AND SATELLITE DATA HAVE ACTUALLY AFFECTED PUBLIC HEALTH ANTICIPATING THE BREAK OUT OF DISEASE AND GETTING MORE MEDICINES IN STOCK? In an indirect way. For example, a month or two ago, there was a reported Ebola outbreak in Zaire, or the Congo. And at this time, the World Health Organization contacted Mr. Jim Wilson, who is a 4th year medical student who has been working with me the past several months studying Ebola. Mr. Wilson and I then compared our satellite data history of the cluster of Ebola outbreaks in the mid-1970s and the mid-1990s to the particular circumstances for this specific location in equatorial Africa. We concluded very quickly in just a matter of a few minutes that this did not match the profile. We then informed WHO that in our opinion this was not an outbreak of Ebola. It turned out one or two weeks later when the detailed lab work was done on some of the people who perished from this disease that it had been an outbreak of the Marburg virus instead. So, we were able to alert people even though they had no confidence in our findings at the time that this was not Ebola. Bit it just didn't match the profile and we were right based on the profile of past historic satellite data. We hope in the future to be able to turn this around and actually have advance warning of the outbreak of diseases based upon climatic and satellite data and actually predict, as you said, when these will occur and where.\" More Information: Global Travel and Virus Spread: How fast could a virus spread from one part of the world to another? Nearly all of the world's major cities are less than 24 hours apart by air. For example, from Nairobi, Kenya in Africa, it is possible that a virus could be spread by infected passengers to any cities listed below within a day.
