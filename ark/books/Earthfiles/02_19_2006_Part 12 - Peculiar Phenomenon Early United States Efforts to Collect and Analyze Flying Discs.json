Andrew Kissner Return to Part 1 Increased Plane Crashes and the National Reaction O n June 4, 1947, the same day President Truman requested an extension of the Second War Powers Act from Congress, a curious announcement appeared in the June 4, 1947, El Paso Times, about 300 cadets who had graduated from the National Military Academy at West Point and would arrive in El Paso in ten transport planes to watch nine B-29 bombers drop 500 pound bombs reportedly south and east of the main post area of WSPG. The graduates would also have the opportunity to watch Ft. Bliss Antiaircraft Artillery demonstrate antiaircraft weapons and observe U. S. Army Ordnance launch a WAC Corporal missile. The announcement was made five days later Col. Turner departed for Washington, D. C., following the \"Juarez V-2 Incident.\" Using military non-combatants as cover for covert military activity is not new. This is especially necessary when the military activity will be observable to the public or a potential adversary. Explanations are needed for the press and public when large numbers of antiaircraft artillery are moved, when artillery is deployed to unusual locations, when bombing an area in full view or even in hearing range of a population, or when missiles are launched. West Point cadets entering military service for much of their lives might be the perfect viewing audience to demonstrate attack on a new adversary. The Eighth Air Force based at Davis-Monthan Field in Tucson would supply the B-29s of the 43rd Bombing Group for the demonstration at \"Orogrande Bombing Range.\" The cadets on a tour of U. S. Army installations around the U. S. arrived at Biggs Army Airfield from Wright Field, Ohio. Later renamed Wright-Patterson AFB, this base vital to the American military was home of General Nathan Twining (MJ-4) and the Armed Forces Air Material Command where the cadets \"had the opportunity to see the Army Air Forces laboratories there.\" [ Ibid.] The cadet announcement was the first of two publicly announced live bombing exercises in the White Sands region over the next five weeks. After \"Juarez Incident,\" Plane Crashes All Over the World In that same week after the May 29, 1947, \"peculiar phenomenon and Juarez rocket crash,\" airplanes began to crash all over the world. The night of May 29, a four-engine C-54 Army courier plane with 42 persons on board crashed in mountains southwest of Tokyo. The same night, a B-29 bomber crashed and burned shortly after taking off from Ladd Field in Fairbanks, Alaska. The same day, an Icelandic Airways plane with 25 persons aboard was reported missing on a flight from Reykjavik to Kureyri. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"F ront Page, The New York Times , May 30, 1947. On June 2, 1947, Lieut. Comdr. Conrad J. Welling of Edgewater, Md., landed his pusher-type Republic Seabee plane upside down in a plowed field after a sharp turn at a 20-foot altitude in order to avoid crashing into a power line because \"a freak wind had kept the plane from gaining altitude.\" [ Front Page, The New York Times , June 2, 1947.] F ront Page, The New York Times , June 2, 1947. On June 2, a former Army BT-13 piloted by Johnny Scott flying above U. S. Route 66 on his way to Colexico, California (the site of Project Y; Z Division's Test Center at Sandy"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Beach) crashed and burned 80 miles east of Albuquerque and 100 miles north of WSPG. Johnny tried to hitchhike from the crash and was picked up by tourist, John Kelly, who took Johnny to an Albuquerque doctor's office but who did not want to file an official accident report. Instead Kelly called Associated Press and said, \"I just thought that someone should know about this (airplane crash).\" [ Las Cruces Sun-News , June 3, 1947.] Also on June 2, 1947, in Pasadena, California, downtown shoppers were surprised when two full 250-gallon wing tanks of a U. S. Army P-80 jet fighter were jettisoned above them. One of the tanks landed in Central Park and blew out a large crater a few yards from the famed Green Hotel. The other landed in a bus depot parking lot creating a hole 10 feet long by five feet wide by two feet deep in the pavement. [ The Arizona Republic , June 3, 1947.] F ront Page, The Arizona Republic , June 3, 1947. On June 3, the 200th Coast Artillery antiaircraft battalion was reportedly reorganized in Las Cruces. Its instructor, Capt. Robert M. Walker, who had only arrived to train troops two weeks before, was now reassigned to a unit in Demming, New Mexico. [ Ibid.] On June 3, a \"twin engine Army patrol plane\" crashed two hundred feet short of the end of the runway at San Bernardino, California, when it \"miscalculated its altitude on landing\" and killed four and injured one. [ El Paso Times , June 5, 1947.] Also on June 3, Mr. N. H. Craphern was critically injured, and his wife only slightly less injured and in shock, when their Stinson light plane failed to maintain altitude near Wilcox, Arizona, on a flight from Tucson. [ The Arizona Republic , June 4, 1947.] On June 5, a \"seaplane\" crashed into a house near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, engulfing four homes in flames. Eyewitnesses said that the airplane was having difficulty gaining altitude after taking off from the Allegheny river. On its second attempt to climb above a hillside along the river, the seaplane flew directly into the north side of a house and exploded on impact, killing three. The plane missed a crowded playground by only a few feet. [ The New York Times, June 6, 1947.]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"F ront Page, The New York Times , June 6, 1947. On June 6, the U. S. Army Transport Command grounded all C-54 (DC-4) Douglas Skymasters. With 196 C-54s in its inventory, the Army grounded the planes as a \"safety precaution.\" A spokesman for the Army Air Forces discussed the two largest U. S. commercial air disasters in history which involved DC-4s the first week of June 1947. But the Army Air Force did not discuss the other air accidents that totaled over 40 and involved almost every time of airplane in military and general aviation service. On June 6, the British steamship, Kelowna, rescued two U. S. Navy airmen about 50 miles off the Virginia Capes. The two pilots were flying a Navy F7-F twin engine, carrier-based bomber and made a water landing about 300 yards from the rescue ship. No debrief o this incident has ever been published. [ The New York Times, June 8, 1947.] On June 7, a single engine Navy bomber over the Atlantic Ocean 50 miles east of Savannah, Georgia, crashed into the sea. Two of the three airmen were rescued. The last words heard over the radio were \"we're going in.\" No debriefing of the two rescued was ever published and no cause of the crash determined. [ Ibid.] On June 7, Hanson W. Baldwin of The New York Times wrote another story - this time about the need to recruit personnel in larger numbers into the antiaircraft artillery. He suggested that only 1,000 men were assigned to this area and that the new threats \"of planes and the long range robot looms over every battlefield.\" [ The New York Times , June 8, 1947.] Evidently when Baldwin was in southern New Mexico or west Texas, he had heard a reliable story concerning the possibility that \"long range robots\" would be employed as offensive weapons in future wars. On June 8, a 14-year-old swimming in a gravel pit in Owosso, Michigan, was decapitated when the propeller blade of a \"low flying\" airplane stuck him. Eyewitnesses reported that the airplane appeared to loose power before it crashed into the lake and injured the pilot and passenger. [ The New York Times, June 9, 1947.] Also on June 8, an Oklahoma couple was killed in Hope, New Mexico, 65 miles west of Artesia and approximately 50 miles east of WSPG when their airplane crashed on take off, failing to gain altitude at the end of the runway. On June 9, the Atomic Energy Commission announced that it would begin recruiting a new civilian \"commando\" guard force to watch \"over western U. S. atomic energy plants.\" The commandos would be given one year's training before being put into the field, but they were warned that they would be subjected to \"physical danger and protracted hours of work ... in severe climatic conditions and high altitudes.\" Applications would be available"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"in post offices in New Mexico and Texas beginning that day with personnel selections made by June 23, 1947. [ Las Cruces Sun-News , June 9, 1947.] On June 10, the \"huge main hanger at John Rogers Airport in Honolulu was totally destroyed by a mysterious fire\" causing more than $1 million in damages and destroying or damaging eight aircraft which belonged to the Naval Air Transport Service. [ El Paso Times , June 12, 1947.] On June 11, Col. Turner announced that a V-2 test scheduled to be conducted on Thursday, June 12, was postponed and that all future V-2 flights would be suspended until such time as \"safety devices\" could be installed to prevent a recurrence of May 29's flight into Juarez, Mexico. This announcement was made five days after all C-54 transports were grounded by the U. S. Army Air Transport Command. [ Las Cruces Sun-News , June 6 and 11, 1947.] F ront Page, Las Cruces Sun-News, June 11, 1947. Previously, one ground station and one individual was responsible for determining if a V-2 rocket was flying off course. It was changed to two more flight safety officers as well as two other ground stations would watch for a rocket malfunction and terminate the flight if a problem developed. No mention was made by Col. Turner that the safety device on the May 15, 1947, V-2 (26th launch) worked perfectly. Col. Turner indicated that the next V-2 launch would probably be on July 3, 1947.
