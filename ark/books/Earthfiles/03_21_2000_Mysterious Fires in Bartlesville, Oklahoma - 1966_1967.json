March 21, 2000 Dallas, Texas - After hearing my radio reports about the mysterious fires southeast of Little Rock, Arkansas first reported on March 9, 2000, a listener in The Colony north of Dallas, Texas sent me an e-mail that began: \"Back in the summer of 1966 or 1967 in the hills around Bartlesville, Oklahoma about fifty miles north of Tulsa, there were several mysterious fires which broke out from unknown causes. We could see them up in the Osage Hills to the east and southeast, some getting too close for comfort at times. \"I was a teenager at the time and decided to ask a group of friends to go up on a high ridge overlooking the town and surrounding area to look for UFOs for fun. We took binoculars and telescopes and had a great time, really not expecting to see anything. But what we did see startled us greatly that night.\" The writer is Brenda Livingston, an artist, who provided this firsthand report that seems to link two unidentified lights in the sky directly with a fire in the Radar Mountain area above Bartlesville, Oklahoma more than thirty years ago. Interview: Brenda Livingston, Artist, The Colony north of Dallas, Texas : \"My group separated off a little bit and spotted two bright lights off to the south about two to five miles away. And they started to descend. They were larger than I would expect from an aircraft or helicopter. Certainly back then, there weren't very many aircraft going over there or helicopters in the area at that time. The lights were much larger than you would expect on any kind of aircraft. And there were "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"no other lights on it. \"We started looking with our telescopes and binoculars and got a pretty good look at them. They started to descend at an angle looking like they were coming in from the south and descending towards the east slowly. And then one of the lights stayed and began to hover. And the other light began to descend at an angle going closer, almost above the treetops. We could tell where it was at another place where we used to frequent. And I can't remember, but I think the name was Round Rock Hill or something like that. And it looked right in that area and we started getting very excited and nervous about it. But we kept on watching them. And this other light, the lower one right above the treetops, it seemed to just hover there for awhile. Suddenly while we were watching, it seemed to emit this light - kind of a golden spike coming from underneath it. And it just stayed in that position for quite a few minutes. What color was the upper part emitting the gold spike? White. It was a really bright white light, rounded. And everybody by this time was starting to gather around. The other group had joined us and we were sharing our binoculars and getting very excited about it trying to figure out what it was. Through binoculars, could you see any structure anywhere? Not any structure at all. It was total light and very bright. We certainly looked for that thinking maybe it was a helicopter, trying to explain it. There just wasn't any explanation for it. They were just too large and too bright to be a normal aircraft. And that light stayed in that position for quite awhile and then hovered in that position without the gold spike and then began to ascend. It ascended at an angle rather haphazardly. It wasn't a very straight line. And it moved very close to the other light and hovered there very briefly. Then they both moved off to the southeast pretty rapidly. Within thirty seconds or so, they were gone. We were very stunned and excited and we were really wanting to find out what it was and what was going on over there. Since we knew where it was, we all hopped into our cars and raced over there, a couple of car loads of us. And we went around the corner to go on the road that would lead up on to this hill. And just before the turnoff to go up the hill, we noticed that the area I mean, we just stopped. It was amazing! The area was charred, burned to a crisp. There was a field area that was rectangular in shape. The grass had been totally burned. We shined our headlights off in that direction. The car behind us stayed about a few seconds and they just did a U-turn and left very rapidly. I guess they got scared. It was just a very eerie feeling. There was a large tree directly in front of us which was totally charred inside and out and had fallen over on to the road in front of us. And there were still flames, some coming out of the middle of the tree and on the branches. There were small fires around the area. The area looked like it was about a fourth of a mile long and there were trees surrounding the grassy area. Those trees were all charred and on fire a little bit. It wasn't like a large fire, but there were some flames coming up from those trees."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Computer drawing by Brenda Livingston depicting her teenage memory of charred area, burned and fallen tree across road and scattered fires in grass and other trees after unidentified light emitted gold beam on to this hill area in summer of 1966/1967. Drawing © 2000 by Brenda Livingston. There were trees in the background which were several hundred yards away that were also charred and there were several fires in those trees. Most of the grass was smoking, although there were a few fires kind of separated out across the grass area. It was so contained. That's what struck me. It was in a rectangular area and there was nothing affected nearby. Ordinarily when I've seen fires, they race along and create their own little pathways. You'll see some of the fire or leftovers from the fires in patterns coming out from it. This was like it was contained in a rectangular area. It was very strange! It was such an eerie feeling. It struck me. I could not move. My friend wanted to pick up and leave. She was in tears by this point and scared. But I was mesmerized by this feeling I got at looking how unusual it was and a strange feeling in the air. Did you go from there back to town to the police or fire department? When it finally hit me that perhaps this was a UFO kind of thing and that it was very strange, I finally went into a panic like my friend and turned around and got out of there at a very rapid rate. We just raced home. I took her immediately home because she was not in good shape. And it really I felt it had died down enough that it wasn't a threat. But if something in the air put a beam down that you could see. Then you go there and find an entire scorched area with trees burning, isn't that something that would be reported to the police and fire department? Wouldn't everyone want to know what did this? Yes. I agree now at this point in my life I would have done that. But back when I was a teenager, I was frightened by it. I was weirded out. I wanted to forget it as fast as possible, actually. I really could not figure out why would they go around if these two objects or lights were the source of this fire, were they the source of the other fires? And I wondered why they would go around from place to place and risk I guess the fires were incidental to whatever they were doing? And if they were associated with the other fires in the area. When you went back a month later and were looking at the ground, how would you compare that charring with other more normal forest charring? What we noticed was there was not any areas that were re-growing. Usually you see a few sprigs or sprouts. But that whole field area was still looking very charred and burned. Blackened."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"So, it was a quarter mile by about 600 feet in a rectangle that was almost pure black in color and surrounded by normal trees and plants? Everything was black. And everything around it was normal. It just ended rather abruptly where the trees that were affected were charred and broken off and then the trees next to them were normal.\" More Information: I welcome any information from long time Bartlesville, Oklahoma residents about fires in the Osage Hills back in either the summer of 1966 or 1967.
