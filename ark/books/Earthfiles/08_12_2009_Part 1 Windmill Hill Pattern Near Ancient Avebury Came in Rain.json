August 12, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - I returned from England today with my photographs of the 350-foot-diameter formation at Windmill Hill near Avebury Trusloe in Wiltshire County. There was heavy rain in Wiltshire through nearly every day and night of late July and the first week of August. British newspapers reported that the unrelenting rain was delaying crop harvests in Wiltshire, Devon and other regions of England. All day and night of August 5 to 6, there had been rain in Wiltshire, so I was surprised when Charles Mallett, Director of the Silent Circle Research Centre in Compton Bassett, told me there was a report of a new formation at Windmill Hill. I took the following images that August 6 morning when it rained so much I struggled to keep the camera from getting too wet between shots, worried that it might stop working in all the moisture. The next day on August 7, 2009, Charles Mallett took his 20-foot-pole and camera to the Windmill Hill formation when the sun finally came out for awhile. Those photos are in Part 2 of this Earthfiles report. Rainy Morning of August 6, 2009 Windmill Hill near Avebury Trusloe, Wiltshire County, England Images © 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
