Across the road to the south, the topography rises to another hill nearly as high as Silbury Hill. The 350-foot-diameter “Quetzalcoatl Headdress” is marked by the green circle. R eturn to Part 1 August 18, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - While I was in England July 24 to August 11, 2009, I met Ryan O'Hara, cameraman working with a documentary film crew that had been doing a night watch on top of 5,000-year-old Silbury Hill from 3 AM to dawn in the early morning hours of July 5. As the sunset turned to darkness on July 4th around 10 PM, no one amid all the air traffic over the ancient Avebury and Silbury complex had reported any new formation across the road from the 130-foot-tall Silbury Hill. But near 4:15 AM, cameraman Ryan O'Hara spotted a shadowy line in the hilltop wheat field south of Silbury Hill and the Roman Road and ran his visible light camera in the pre-dawn. He gave me permission to reprint his first greenish image, followed by more detail as dawn light increased to first sunrise images when the heavy dew sparkled undisturbed without any human presence in the wheat.
