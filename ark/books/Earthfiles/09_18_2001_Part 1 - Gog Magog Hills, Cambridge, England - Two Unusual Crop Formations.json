Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 1 - Gog Magog Hills, Cambridge, England - Two Unusual Crop Formations © 2001 by Linda Moulton Howe \" When the thousand years end, Satan will be let out of his prison. He will go out to deceive the nations of the world and gather them together, wi th Gog and Magog , for battle - a mighty host, numberless as sand along the shore. They will go up across the broad plain of the earth and surround God's people and the beloved city of Jerusalem on every side. But fire from God in heaven will flash down on the attacking armies and consume them.\" The Revelation in the Bible 20:7-9 July 11, 2001 began the first formation that unfolded in three stages, followed by a second formation in a nearby wheat field on July 25, 2001 southeast of Cambridge, England at the Gog Magog Hills near an ancient Neolithic circle of stones called Wandlebury Ring. September 18, 2001 Gog Magog Hills, Cambridge, England - Two months to the day before the horrorific attacks on New York City's World Trade Center, the Pentagon in Washington, D. C. and the airliner over Shanksville, Pennsylvania, an unusual series of evolving crop formations occurred in wheat at the Gog Magog Hills southeast of Cambridge, England near an ancient Neolithic circle of stones called Wandlebury Ring. First Crop Formation Began Emerging on July 11, 2001 at Go g Mago g Hil l s, Camb rid ge, E n gl an d : "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The big ring, 666 feet in diameter, came first by itself on July 11, 2001. A week later around July 18 the 237 feet diameter labyrinth emerged inside the ring. Then a few days after that, the 225 feet diameter \"step pyramid\" showed up.

British investigator, Charles Mallett, visited the changing fields several times and wrote about his impressions at his website, http://www.cropcircleconnector.com /c&f/c&f.html. With his permission, I am excerpting from his July 2001 reports and ground photographs. Charles Mallett, CFPR Field Report, Gog & Magog Hills, Cambridgeshire July 11-18, 2001 : Stage One - The Ring Measured 666 Feet In Diameter \"What started life on the 11th of July as a vast but nevertheless simple ring of flattened corn in a Cambridgeshire wheat field has now morphed several times into what can only be described as a mind-stretching, paradigm-shifting, orgasmagram of the very highest order. ...First came the big ring ... spanning a massive and potentially rather ominous 666 feet diameter. (This is a definite figure, not an approximation). Most of the field has been used in the creation of this formation making it one of the most expansive crop glyphs in the brief history of the circle phenom enon. ...To my amazement, the ring itself repeated the same numbers in its width that were found in the overall diameter of the formation, with the tape measure pulling tight at exactly 18 feet. At the center of the mighty ring is a beautifully swirled circle with a diameter of 45 feet. This also arrived as part of the initial Stage One event. Stage Two - The Labyrinth Measured 237 Feet In Diameter "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Second stage, center of 237-foot-diameter labyrinth. Photograph © 2001 by Charles Mallett. \"About a week later, the Magog field took its second hit with the arrival of a most elegant 237 feet diameter labyrinth that is positioned just inside the inner edge of the Stage One ring. A very fine wall of standing wheat, only a few stems thick, separates the maze from the ring itself. This labyrinth seems to be crafted out of the ripe wheat with an attention to detail not seen for some years in the crop fields of England. Every aspect of the winding walkway has been finished with a razor sharp edge that gives one the impression that whatever is responsible for this awesome creation has a fanatical zeal for absolute, total perfection. \"At the center of the labyrinth is a standing ring of crop positioned within the central circle, offset from center by a considerable degree. The purpose is not clear, but nevertheless is a fine detail worthy of our admiration. Walking through this network of 3 feet diameter paths left me in no doubt that the agency that created this marvel is able to gain absolute control over the chosen area and seemingly does with ease what I would consider nearly impossible.

This effect is consistent throughout the whole three stages of the overall formation and was, for me, an excellent example of what a real crop glyph looks and feels like. ..."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Circles in center of 666-foot-diameter ring with labyrinth in background.

Stage Three - The \"Step Pyramid\" Measured 225 Feet In Diameter \"Some days later, the third addition arrived on the scene. ...From an aerial perspective a kind of step pyramid is now seen rising out of the field next to the maze. At ground level, this is a bizarre sight. Six standing square-like walls of wheat with rounded corners, each eighteen inches thick, fit together to produce a most amazing design, very much in keeping with the uniqueness and originality of the overall formation. The quality of construction, as with the labyrinth, shows absolutely no compromise whatsoever. There is no doubt that the same agency that produced the ring and maze has returned to the field to work the same magic once again. Stunning. At the center of this crafted temple, the crop has been laid down in such a way as to create a shining, four-sided apex stone. ...

Photograph © 2001 by Charles Mallett. \"It is rather interesting to note the positioning of the two major formations within the ring. First, the maze arrives and takes up a quarter of the inner expanse of standing crop. Next the steps come down, or possibly up, next to the maze, thus using up another quarter of the available space. This suggests that we are possibly in for another couple of major events at this site.\" But after Stage Three, the wheat patterns in the Gog Magog Hills stopped changing. Then came the second formation in a nearby wheat field. Continued in Part 2.
