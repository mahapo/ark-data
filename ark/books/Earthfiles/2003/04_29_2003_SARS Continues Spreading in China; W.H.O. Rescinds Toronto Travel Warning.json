Rescinds Toronto Travel Warning© 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe Tiananmen Square in downtown Beijing, a city of 14 million residents,is eerily silent as the SARS coronavirus has provoked the government to close downall public entertainment venues, forced thousands into quarantine while thousands more arestayingin their homes or have left the city in fear of contracting the deadly disease. Photograph ©2003 by AFP. April 29, 2003 Beijing, China - On this date, China announced nine newdeaths from severe acute respiratory syndrome known as SARS and 202 newcases, bringing the country's death toll to 148 and case number to 3,303. Somemedical authorities have expressed concern that given China's deliberate effortsto hide SARS patients and even deny their was a disease problem until onlyrecently, the actual number of cases might be double or triple the currentpublicly reported number. The World Health Organization's advisory againstnonessential travel to Beijing and China's Shanxi Province, Guangdong Provinceand Hong Kong remains in effect where SARS is still a serious epidemic. There,as the government tries to clean buses, public buildings, schools and hospitals,the economies have collapsed in the face of a disease that is keeping thousandsof people home, either in quarantine or in fear of catching the dangerous illness.Toronto General Hospital SARS sanitation warning.Photograph © 2003 by Associated Press.W.H.O. Rescinds Toronto Travel WarningBut apparently giving into the political pressure from Toronto governmentofficials who were angry about the suggestion that their SARS-infected city isnot safe, W.H.O. today rescinded its SARS advisory against nonessential travelto Toronto. However, it's still a fact that Toronto has the largest number ofSARS cases and deaths outside Asia. So far, Canada has reported 146 cases and"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"20 deaths. That is a mortality rate of 13.7%.In exchange for the lifted travel warning, the Canadian government says it willnow screen all passengers leaving the country for symptoms of SARS, whichincludes a fever above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit, body aches, dry cough anddifficulty breathing. Association of Southeast Asian Nations Meet to Battle SARSToday was also the first time that high-level government officials from China,Hong Kong and ten other Asian nations met in Bangkok, Thailand, specificallyto come up with ways to fight the SARS epidemic.\"Every country must be responsible for the health of their citizens, not allowingtheir sick people to travel to other parts of the region,\" said Thailand's PublicHealth Minister.The group agreed to screen international travelers at both departure and arrivalgates. Some airports are investing in thermal imaging cameras which can detecthigh fevers. There will now be an emphasis on sharing information, not hiding it,and creating an international emergency SARS hotline.Backing up the Thai Public Health Minister's statement, China today bannedtourists from visiting Tibet, central China and the Chinese countryside, eventhough W.H.O. has so far not reported any SARS cases in Tibet.W.H.O. continues to report that new SARS cases are slowing in Vietnam,Canada, Singapore and even Hong Kong, suggesting the deadly new coronaviruslinked to SARS is being contained in those regions.Can China get control over the virus it refused to acknowledge since it firstemerged in November 2002? Is this new coronavirus now destined to stay in theworld, flaring up with unexpected virulence under environmental conditions androutes of transmission that are still not fully understood? If we don't yet have avaccine for the common cold, another coronavirus, is a vaccine for this brandnew coronavirus really feasible any time soon? What happens if this newcoronavirus continues to mutate as it \"learns\" to operate in the humanpopulation? Could it become more virulent? Or less?SARS Cases as of April 29, 2003 Reported by CDC andW.H.O.
