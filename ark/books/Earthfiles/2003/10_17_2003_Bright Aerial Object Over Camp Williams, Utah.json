As a precaution and in standard operating procedure in theevent of a pending air crash, the Salt Lake City International Airport stoppedtwo airliners from landing. But the FAA said there weren't any aircraft in thearea. When the NCO's report reached higher authorities, NORAD at CheyenneMountain, Colorado, became involved. As of this date, NORAD has notreleased any official statement about the NCO's report. The unofficial guess isthat the object was \"probably a meteorite.\"Interview:Lt. Col Brad Blackner, Public Affairs Officer, Utah National Guard(employed 24 years), Camp Williams, Salt Lake City, Utah: \"Yesterdaymorning at 10:50 a.m. (Oct. 16, 2003), one of our sergeants from CampWilliams, a training range in south Salt Lake City, was doing some work out onthe range and he witnessed what he explained to be an aircraft traveling south tonorth with either a contrail or fire or light coming out of the rear. He originallythought it was a plane in distress. As he watched, it went out of sight and didn'treappear again. So, he assumed that the aircraft went down.He notified our range control who in turn called the FAA. From the reports wereceived, the FAA said there weren't any aircraft in the area. So, the reportcontinued up the channels and got to the national level and NORAD out ofCheyenne Mountain called to follow up.So, we took the individual back out to the range who witnessed this and to thearea where he had worked to try to find out some type of debris or indication ofwreckage which was not found. There had been some meteor showers accordingto NORAD and some of the other federal agencies. This is supposed to be a hightime of the year for meteor showers. That's what they thought it was.In fact, one of the television stations relayed information to me that it was ameteor shower. But there has been no conclusions as of yet."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"IN THE REPORT YOU FILED WITH NORAD, DID THE NCO DESCRIBESEEING THIS OBJECT HAVE ANY TYPE OF EXPLOSION? THE REASONI'M ASKING IS THAT THE TV REPORT ON CHANNEL 4 DESCRIBED ONEOR TWO EXPLOSIONS?I haven't personally read the report, so I can't say.THERE WAS ALSO A STATEMENT THAT SOME AIR TRAFFIC GOINGINTO THE SALT LAKE CITY AIRPORT WAS DIVERTED?When the original report came out and they notified the FAA, I guess that wasnormal procedure. That was the first thing they did because Camp Williams is inthe path of airplanes coming into Salt Lake City International.SO, IF THEY HAD A QUESTION ABOUT ANYTHING IN THE SKY THATMIGHT BE AN AIRLINER IN DISTRESS THEY WOULD DIVERT OTHERAIRLINERS?Yes, that's correct. (The NCO's) been with the National Guard for quite anumber of years. He's a senior NCO, and he has worked out there for quite anumber of years, so he was taken very seriously at the time and still as the reportcomes in, he anticipates action or steps we might need to take after NORAD seesthe report.IT'S FAIR TO SAY RIGHT NOW, IT'S STILL AN UNKNOWN?I would say yes. We haven't come to any conclusions. We basically just fill outour reports and take them to higher headquarters and wait for a response fromthem.WAS THERE ANY DEBRIS FIELD OF ANY KIND FOUND TODAYANYWHERE?No. No. They returned to the area, as I mentioned earlier, where he first madethe sighting, and there was no indication of wreckage of any kind.AND MAKES IT MORE MYSTERIOUS ABOUT WHAT IT WAS THAT EVENA LARGE METEORITE COMING IN MIGHT HAVE AT LEAST LEFT ADEBRIS FIELD SOMEWHERE.It makes it a bit unusual.\"More Information:Lt. Col. Brad Blackner says NORAD is analyzing the Utah National GuardNCO's eyewitness report and that further official comment might beforthcoming.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
