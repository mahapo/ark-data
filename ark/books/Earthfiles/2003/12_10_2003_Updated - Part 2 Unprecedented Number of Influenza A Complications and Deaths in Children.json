Map courtesy Centers for Disease Control. Updated - December 12, 2003 Little Rock, Arkansas - The way the Fujianflu has hit so early and so hard in the Northern Hemisphere has left someseasoned doctors stunned. Dr. James Todd, Director of Epidemiology at DenverChildren's Hospital where at least four flu-related deaths have occurred, said thisweek, \"In my 30 years on the job I've never seen an outbreak this bad.\"This is dangerous, deadly flu and to make matters worse, the nation has beenrunning out of flu vaccines. But yesterday on December 11th, U. S. Secretary ofHealth and Human Services, Tommy Thompson, announced at a pressconference at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta:\"The Department has just completed the purchase of 100,000 doses of adultInfluenza A vaccine from Aventis Pasteur (in Europe). It is being shipped to statehealth departments now. It is expected to arrive in the states by the end of thisweek. Each state's supply will be based upon its population.\"Secretary Thompson said an additional 150,000 doses of pediatric vaccine hadalso been purchased from Aventis and is expected to be ready for shipment tothe states by January, 2004. Secretary Thompson emphasized that hisdepartment was looking for other vaccines wherever possible.CDC says the dangerous Fujian virus has now spread to every state and schoolsthroughout the United States are reporting high absentee rates because of theflu. With so many students and teachers ill, some schools have temporarily"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"closed. One example is the Trousdale County schools near Nashville, Tennessee.It's a district of 1,300 students and classes were canceled on Tuesday with noplans to open again until Monday, December 15.Also this week at Dallas Children's Medical Center in Texas and in ColoradoSprings, Colorado hospitals, doctors have been reporting children with so muchdamage from the Fujian flu strain that they are put on heart-lung bypassmachines just to stay alive. The number of deaths has climbed to an estimatedtwo dozen, including a teenager.Further, Dr. Steve Schexnayder, the Chief of Critical Care Medicine inPediatrics at the Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, reports anunprecedented number of flu cases - including his own daughter - and moresevere complications in children from flu than he has ever seen before.Steve Schexnayder, M. D., Chief of Critical Care Medicine, Dept. ofPediatrics, Arkansas Children's Hospital, Little Rock, Arkansas:\"We have been treating children from Louisiana with severe complications andin terms of confirmed influenza, our complications at this point have come fromthe Arkansas/Texas border and Louisiana the most severe complications we haveseen.HOW MANY CASES HAVE YOU HAD SO FAR OF CONFIRMEDINFLUENZA AND WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THE INCREASE TO BE?I don't have an accurate number. I believe the hospital had reported 400 positivetests as of yesterday. We are very concerned. Yesterday we set a record for thenumber of in-patients in our hospital and we simply do not have room for moresick children at this point. We are very close to maxing out the resources wehave to care for them. So, we're obviously very concerned on a number of fronts.THAT WOULD BE HOW MANY AS OF YESTERDAY?Yesterday we had 260 in the hospital. We have never gotten 260 patients in thehospital before and that was essentially using most beds that weren't in aspecialty area such as a burn unit or the natal intensive care.DOES THAT MEAN YOU ARE NOW HAVING TO TURN CHILDREN AWAYWHO ARE SICK AND SENDING THEM OFF TO OTHER HOSPITALS?We have not. We have delayed transfer of some in, but we're fortunate that wehave been able to either provide or ensure that children who needed particularlyour services in critical care were able to get their needs met through ourinstitution or one with similar capabilities.BUT IF YOU MAXED OUT YESTERDAY ON DECEMBER 10, 2003, ANDTHIS INCREASES OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, WHAT WILL HAPPEN?We could be faced with a situation that we've actually never encountered that isroutine in most cities in the country of actually diverting ambulances and saying"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"we don't have the resources to take more patients in the emergency departmentat this point. In addition to a really unprecedented number of flu cases through ourout-patient areas within the hospital, meaning our clinics and the EmergencyDepartment, we're also seeing a number of children with severe complications.The severe complications have included staph pneumonia which was mentionedin that AP article, we've seen a condition where there is an inflammation of theheart which causes the heart to function very poorly. We've seen breakdown ofmuscles resulting in kidney failure. We have seen little babies with pneumonia.In addition to some more common illnesses that can be associated withinfluenza such as croup or one called bronchiolitis.WHAT ABOUT THE BRAIN?We have not seen any influenza encephalitis yet. But with the volume ofinfluenza we're seeing this year, we may. But we have not seen braincomplications to my knowledge at this point through the intensive care unit.They may have in other parts of the hospital. But if the children, if they've hadthat, it's been mild and not sick enough to require admission to the ICU.IF THE AMOUNT OF COMPLICATIONS IN THIS FLU ISUNPRECEDENTED, WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS FUJIAN INFLUENZA ATHAT IS CAUSING SO MUCH DAMAGE IN CHILDREN?We simply don't know. I think that is the target of the CDC trying to examinethis. Is it a really different strain? Or are we just seeing a larger number ofchildren affected by it? We're not clear why this seems to be an incrediblycontagious and in some cases, very virulent strain.WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE BODY OF A CHILD OR ADULT THAT HASTO GO ON A HEART-LUNG BYPASS MACHINE?Generally that is from failure of the heart and/or lungs. It can be from what wecall myocarditis which is an inflammation of the heart muscle or you can alsohave a severe pneumonia, or a combination of both. And a patient with severeshock who is literally dying, it might be a rescue therapy we would use.WHAT THE VIRUS IS DOING IS ATTACKING LUNG TISSUE, HEARTTISSUE, MUSCLE TISSUE AND POTENTIALLY BRAIN TISSUE IN SUCHAN AGGRESSIVE WAY THAT IT'S CAUSING THIS MUCH DAMAGE?Yes, in general, and with lung it might be a particular secondary infection likepneumonia. Certainly how many patients we are seeing causes me an alarm.Pneumonia is a complication of influenza every year, but the vast numbers ofchildren we are seeing with influenza make me very concerned that we could beset up for having a large number of complications that potentially couldoverwhelm our resources.THE CDC REPORTED YESTERDAY THEY HAVE FLU REPORTED INEVERY STATE EXCEPT WASHINGTON, D. C., AND MASSACHUSETTS.THEY ARE EXPECTING THOSE PLACES TO BE INFECTED AS WELL."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"WE ARE MOVING TOWARD EPIDEMIC LEVELS OF THIS FLU. IFYOU'VE HAD UNPRECEDENTED NUMBERS OF CHILDREN WITHTHESE VERY SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS, WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTINGTO SEE IN THE NEXT THREE OR FOUR WEEKS?I think we will be at risk to continue to see these complications as we see moreand more children with the disease. I think the onus is on medical professionalsto be aware of complications and for parents for a child who seemsdisproportionately ill to get that child to medical attention quickly. TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE IN THINGS LIKE STAPH INFECTIONS WHICHCAN TAKE OVER THE BODY PRETTY QUICKLY. I'M CURIOUS WHATYOU KNOW ABOUT THE STAPH- DRUG-RESISTANT GERMS THATSEEM TO BE INFECTING PEOPLE?More and more of the infections that we are seeing now that are caused by staphare being caused by resistant organisms. Five years ago, we would typically see arare case of any type of staph infection the most common being a skin infectionlike an abscess of the skin or what we call cellulitis, just inflammation of theskin and soft tissues from staph infections.Five years ago, only a few percent of those were caused by drug-resistantorganisms. Currently, we are seeing probably around 40% to 50% of theorganisms are resistant to the traditional antibodies that we've treated them with.WHAT DO YOU DO IN THESE CASES?We use different antibiotics. Fortunately, there are some alternatives available.Sometimes they are more costly and frequently more toxic than some of theother medications we have more classically used. But there are other antibioticsavailable.WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL GREATEST CONCERN AS WE TALK NOWON DECEMBER 10?That we are still on the up-slope of this widespread illness. We will continue tosee more and more cases of influenza with potentially inadequate vaccineprotection this year because of the shift, what we call the antigenic shift. And aswe see increased numbers (of patients), we will see increased numbers ofcomplications.THAT MEANS INCREASED NUMBER OF DEATHS, DOESN'T IT?It can. We've been fortunate that we've been able to support all the children.We've taken care of complications and have not had any deaths. However, thatcould change today. I THINK WE TEND TO UNDERESTIMATE THE SERIOUSNESS OF FLU. I"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"REMEMBER HAVING THE HONG KONG FLU 1968 AND FEELING LIKE IHAD BEEN HIT BY A MACK TRUCK AND UNABLE TO MOVE FOR FIVEOR SIX DAYS. IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY, THESE ARE THE KINDSOF SYMPTOMS THAT SHOULD BE EXPECTED FROM CHILDREN TOADULTS WITH THE FUJIAN STRAIN?Correct. I have a daughter at home right now with it who developed flu despitebeing vaccinated about a month ago. So, clearly no vaccine is 100%; however,we have seen a number of children and adults that have had flu symptomsdespite being immunized.COULD YOU DESCRIBE FROM YOUR MEDICAL POINT OF VIEWEXACTLY THE SYMPTOMS YOUR DAUGHTER HAS HAD WHICHWOULD MAYBE HELP PARENTS WHO ARE LISTENING?Fever, headache, cough and muscle aches have really been the predominantones. Occasional vomiting. But really the fever, muscle aches, headache andcough and some sore throat. In fact, it started with a store throat and cough.WHAT KIND OF FEVER HAVE YOU BEEN DEALING WITH?She began treatment with an anti-viral medicine within about 12 hours of hersymptoms and her fever has only been to about 102, which has been relativelylow compared to some kids we've been seeing in the emergency department.We've seen temperatures of 105 not uncommonly.THAT IS REALLY SERIOUS.Ye s , i t i s . WHAT SHOULD PEOPLE DO ABOUT GETTING ANTI-VIRALS?Contact your physician and the physician might want to see them and test themto see if it is influenza. There is a time window, though, for anti-viral medicationin that it needs to be given within 24 to 48 hours of onset of symptoms. It doesnot cure it immediately. Most of the data suggests that you can reducepotentially the severity and length of symptoms by approximately a day. Wehave already seen a regional shortage of some of the anti-viral medicines as well.BECAUSE THEY ARE BEING USED SO MUCH IN OTHER PLACES?Just because we were using so many of them. We had a stock this week, but twoweeks ago we had none available in liquid form for a period of time.THAT MUST BE FRUSTRATING AS A DOCTOR KNOWING IT COULDHELP. AND THAT RAISES A QUESTION THAT IS COMING INTOEVERYONE'S MINDS: WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT DISTRIBUTION OFBOTH VACCINES AND ANTI-VIRALS IF IN THIS YEAR WE ARE JUSTDEALING WITH FUJIAN, WHICH IS AN EPIDEMIC, NOT A PANDEMIC.WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF WE WERE FACING A PANDEMIC LIKE THE1918 SWINE FLU?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"We would be in a much more serious condition because clearly the supply ofanti-virals is not sufficient to treat the United States, much less to treat theworld.\"http://www.cdc.govCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
