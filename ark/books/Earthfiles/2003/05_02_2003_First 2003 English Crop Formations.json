It was a simple circle in oilseed rape below Cliffe Hill inLewes, East Sussex.Cliffe Hill, Lewes, East Sussex, England circle in oilseed rape56 feet in diameter, discovered by the farmer on or about April 12, 2003.Photograph © 2003 by Jamie Hiscocks.Not far from the Cliffe Hill crop circle is the home of Andy Thomas, editor ofthe crop circle website, SwirledNews.com. He is author of a wonderful bookrecently released in North America entitled, Vital Signs: A Complete Guide tothe Crop Circle Mystery and Why It Is Not A Hoax. Andy received an e-mailsaying there was a circle below Cliffe Hill east of Lewes and he set out to find it.Andy Thomas, Author and Editor, SwirledNews.com, Cooksbridge, Lewes,East Sussex, England: \"So, we went out there, myself and my colleague AlanBrown, and there sure enough in oilseed rape just at the foot of some downlands there was a simple circle. We managed to find the farmer and have a chatwith him and he told us that it had been there for at least three weeks, so thatwould put it back before any of the other reports we've had so far this year. Wecan date it pretty much to around the 12th of April.LAST YEAR, APRIL 12TH, ON EXACTLY THE SAME DATE WAS THESOBERTON FORMATION IN HAMPSHIRE. See: Earthfiles 04-29-03."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Discovered April 12, 2002, about 50 feet in oilseed rapeat Long Road, near Soberton, Hampshire. Aerial photograph © 2002 by Peter R. Sorensen.Yes, and so, I was lucky enough although I didn't know it at the time to have thefirst formation of 2003 just a few miles from my own home.W H AT WA S T H E D I A M E T E R ?It was 56 feet across. And it sits at the foot of a place called Cliffe Hill, which isnear Lewes. Lewes is a very historic town. It was built on a series of burialmounds and on the downs just above the circle, there's a long barrow. There aresome strange tales told about the long barrow because various people over theyears have reported seeing this huge, shimmering demonic figure howling fromthe top of the hill.Now, I would have perhaps been slightly cynical about this were it not for thefact that one of the people who told me this is a close friend and a devoutskeptic on anything remotely strange at all. And he saw this with some friendsabout 30 years now when he was walking back along that road and he said itterrified the life out of him. He knows exactly what he saw and it sticks in hismind to this day even though he can't explain it.WAS IT SOMETHING SHIMMERING IN THE AIR LOW TO THE GROUND?It appeared to be standing, from what I can gather, on the long barrow. Heestimated it was about ten feet all. He said it was taller than an average humanbeing. This might not have nothing to do with the crop circle whatsoever! Butit's just interesting this is an area associated with paranormal happenings, as itwere, and now we get a circle down there.WHAT WAS THE ROTATION INSIDE THE CIRCLE? CLOCKWISE?It was a clockwise circle, yes. Oh, and there were quite a few stems in there thatseemed to be nicely bent without any damage. But on the other hand, there weresome snapped stems. But from what the farmer told me, other people had beenin before to look at it.But there were no trails coming out of it which went through any other parts ofthe field that we could see on the ground. The oilseed rape was pretty high. Ithink people don't often appreciate actually how tall rape is until you actuallywalk in it. I think you call it canola in the States. I mean this stuff can reach to 4and 5 feet high and when you walk amongst it, you are absolutely fighting yourway through it even in the tractor lines! And you come out absolutely yellow,covered in yellow pollen. You're pulling it out of your clothes and ears for thenext three days!\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Privett, Hampshire formation laying amid the thick, flowering yellowoilseed rape. Photograph © 2003 by Lucy Pringle.Another researcher who ended up this week neck high in yellow, wet oilseedrape was Lucy Pringle from Petersfield, Hampshire. Lucy has beenphotographing crop formations since the early 1990s, has done biophysicalresearch in them and is author of a wonderful book entitled, Crop Circles: TheGreatest Mystery of Modern Times. She lives in Petersfield, not far from theApril 20th crop formation of a figure eight or infinity symbol cut in the middleand surrounded by a ring. But she did not hear about the Privett formation forseveral days and then was frustrated by rainy weather that interfered with flying.The first person who did fly over the Privett formation was photographer DavidRussell who gave Lucy the ground coordinates. She tried to find the pattern, butcould not. Then a couple of days ago, she asked the farmer for help and he toldher where to walk.Lucy Pringle, Photographer, Crop Formation Researcher and Author,Petersfield, Hampshire, England: \"When one got closer walking along theperimeter, one could see a sort of scar in the field. It was quite easy, especiallyhaving my photographs to tell which tramlines to go up. But it was a helluvawalk. It couldn't have been much short of half a mile! Maybe even more.YES, AND YOU HAD THE FRUSTRATION OF TRYING VERY HARD INRECENT DAYS TO FIND THE FORMATION AT ALL FROM THE GROUND."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"That's right because you simply cannot see it from the (flat) ground.Even photographed from raised rail embankment to the south of the field,the Privett formation is hard to see. Photograph © 2003 by Tony Purser.BUT THE FORMATION IS IN THE LOWEST PART OF THE FIELD?In a little dip. It's a steeper gradient than it looks from the road and you walk up.And yesterday, it had been raining, so I can tell you that we walked through theflowering oilseed rape, canola, it just doused its water, emptied its water fromthe petals, onto our trousers that then went into our boots. Oh, we were soakedto the skin, I can't tell you! But you go up this gradient you see this formation.But it's not visible from the road.AS YOU WERE GETTING DOUSED WITH WATER, WERE YOU ALSOGETTING DOUSED WITH ALL THAT YELLOW POLLEN?Oh, yes, covered in yellow, absolutely covered with yellow! What was veryinteresting was that the height of the crop on the lower part was really quiteshort. I'd say it couldn't have been much more than 2 feet six inches. But as wegot up to the dip part of the formation, it was almost five foot. It was well overmy shoulders.I have always been under the impression that oilseed rape being a hollowstemmed crop would snap if it was bent at an angle of more than 40 degrees.Normally when you go into these canola formations, you hear snap, snap, snap,snap if you are one of the first ones as you walk over the crop. Now, in thisformation, there was no snapping whatsoever.There was evidence of muddy footprints, but I understand from the farmer'sdaughter that about 8 people had been into it already. Looking at the stems,there were very few broken. There were quite a few broken around the two littlestanding circles on the perimeter, and in the center, there was a lot of evidenceof broken stems. But on the outside in the perimeter, there were virtually none,and some of the really thick, big stalks were bent over at 90 degrees absolutelyperfectly. And this I've taken a picture of. I thought, 'This is just amazing!'"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The red circles on this well-worn map indicate the famous sacred stone circlesof Avebury in Wiltshire where so many formations have focused over the years.Then a little south All Cannings is highlighted with yellow and surrounded by farmswhere formations have emerged nearly every year for more than a decade.The difficulty in seeing some crop formations from the ground and people notreporting them also happened at another formation further west in Wiltshire.Pilot Busty Taylor has been photographing and investigating English cropformations since 1985. He heard about the Privett formation and wanted to seeit. So, on April 26th, he got in his airplane. Not only did he find the Privettpattern, but he was surprised to find another formation near the farming villageof All Cannings, Wiltshire, that seemed like it must have been visible toresidents in houses around the field but no one had reported it.Busty Taylor, Pilot, Author and Crop Formation Investigator Since 1985,Andover, Hampshire, England: \"Having heard there was something out atPrivett and not knowing the exact location, I just got in the plane and startedheading that way and slowly let the plane fly around because over the years 17to 18 years of doing this I basically got an instinct as to where it could be. I justlet the plane fly along and recognized one or two landmarks and kinked theplane over to the right, and there it was basically right under the nose. And thatwas the Privett one. I did a few circuits of that having a look at it.I just flew around the area looking for the crop circles and headed northwestand arrived in the Alton Barnes area and chugged along, and sure enough underthe nose again and slightly to the left this time, I thought, 'That looks likeanother circle about two miles out.' I peeled around and had another look andrealized it wasn't very far from All Cannings village. The actual circle is onlyabout 150 yards from the actual buildings there and about 70 yards from thecanal. I thought, 'That's pretty close. Certainly, everybody must know aboutthis.' I flew around it and took some more pictures and decided to fly on. To meit looked like it had been there at least a week. Even though I say I fly at 800feet, it looked to me as though the growth, the heads of the plants were startingto pick back up vertically again and that normally takes 3 to 4 days.SO THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN CREATED ABOUT THE SAME EASTERSUNDAY AS THE PRIVETT ONE?If you could say no more than seven days before or somewhere in between, Ithink you would be about right. I do estimate it was about 120 to 130 feet inlength."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"As far as I know, no one had reported anything in the All Cannings area at allprior to that, but what I couldn't understand was that the people from the houses150 yards away from their upper windows, they should have seen that at AllCannings quite easily.YES, AND IF THEY DID, WHY DIDN'T THEY REPORT IT?Again, it could be down to the farmers. You must remember that a lot of farmerstreat these as the devil, so to speak, because it makes people walk all over theirland and create extra damage. They may have known about it, but wanted tokeep it quiet. Then I come along and upset the apple cart a little bit.\"Click on cover for link to amazon.com.Copyright 1998 and 2002 by Andy Thomas.\"...
