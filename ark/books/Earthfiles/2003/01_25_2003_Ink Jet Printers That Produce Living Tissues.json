The goal is to pinpoint specific biological units inprecise X and Ycoordinates on plastic sheets to grow tissue, in the same manner that ink jetprinters distribute dotsof color on paper.

January 25, 2003 Clemson, South Carolina - According to bioengineer,Thomas Boland, at Clemson University in South Carolina, a future is coming inwhich ink jet printer technology will provide hospitals with full grown organsfor transplant into diseased patients - starting from a flat sheet!Dr. Boland was born in Dinslaken, West Germany and traveled to Toulouse,France, to study chemical engineering. Then in 1995, he completed his chemicalengineering Ph.D. at the University of Washington in Seattle. He began workingfor Clemson University in 1999 and began his research with ink jet printers toproduce tissues with great skepticism. Today, he thinks the process will helppharmaceuticals test drugs on various organs, human or animal, and ultimatelywill provide fresh, whole organs for the growing transplant demand.Interview:Thomas Boland, Ph.D., Asst.

Prof. of Bioengineering, Clemson University,Clemson, South Carolina: \"When I started this work maybe a year and a halfor two years ago, we were thinking of using ink jet printers to print biologicalmolecules instead of ink. These molecules could be proteins, DNA and someothers.BUT WHY AN INK JET PRINTER?Because they are an affordable means to pattern particular proteins or moleculeson a surface. And we were interested in studying patterns of cells, for example.IS IT BECAUSE HEAT IS INVOLVED IN AN INK JET PRINTER?No. It is just a convenient way for us to reproducibly place molecules in acertain X and Y position on a support. Ink jet printers do just that. We actually -in our experiments - turn off the heat because it will damage the cells. We justuse pressure that is put on the cartridges. In fact the mechanism is pretty muchthe same as an ordinary ink jet printer.WHAT IS IT THAT YOU PUT THROUGH THE INK JET PRINTER?I usually empty out the cartridges and clean them very thoroughly and then wefill the cartridge with whatever we would like to print for a particularexperiment. Sometimes we use proteins or other molecules. Sometimes we usecells, depending upon the structure we would like to do. We have the printerhooked up to a computer and we open up a file, like a Power Point file, andmake a design of what we would like to print and then print.HOW ARE YOU GETTING THE CELLS OR THE PROTEINS OUT OF THEROLLER ON TO A VERY PARTICULAR PART OF IS IT PAPER ORPLASTIC?It's plastic. We are using plastic. The cartridges themselves have actually beenordered, so it's at the bottom of the cartridge where your ink or in our case, thecells would come out. And the cartridge sits on top of a horizontal, usually ahorizontal bar that can move right and left. Then the roller just moves the paper.In our experiment, we have sometimes taken the rollers off and reassembledthem so the rollers are now moving a glass slide or Petri dish or sometimes atransparency, a plastic sheet, onto what we would like to print.BUT YOU CAN'T PUT A PETRI DISH THROUGH AN INK JET PRINTER.Right. In the case of Petri dishes, we actually disassemble the entire printer andreassemble it so that instead of having to feed a sheet we just have everythinglaid out flat in front of us and the only movement that the paper does, or ourPetri dish does, is move back and forth underneath the cartridge and thecartridge moves on top in the other direction, X and Y."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Ink jet printer modified to lay down cells, proteins or specific biological moleculesin precise patterns with X and Y coordinates on a Petri dish.Photograph © 2003 by Thomas Boland, Ph.D.SO, WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS MOVING THE PLASTIC MATERIALAGAINST WHATEVER IS IN THE PETRI DISH TO GET IT TO CLINGONTO THAT PLASTIC?Correct. Sometimes we would just use the rollers to move a sheet such as atransparency slide and we would glue our Petri dish on top of that. And so asthe paper is moved by the rollers, the Petri dish moves as well and then anotherthing on top shoots down into the Petri dish.WHY ARE YOU GOING TO ALL OF THIS TROUBLE TO USE PROTEINAND CELLS IN INK JET PRINTERS?One of the current challenges in tissue engineering which is the growing oforgans and tissues to replace diseased organ is that at this point not more thanone cell type be ordinarily seated onto a scaffold to make an organ. However,you need many cell types that would function in conjunction to have afunctioning organ.Now, using an ink jet printer, because just as the printer has the ability to printdifferent colors out of different cartridges, we can fill each cartridge with adifferent cell type or different protein or different growth factor and then deliverthese to the specified locations (on the plastic sheet that goes through the ink jetprinter).AND ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE DIFFERENT CELLS AND PROTEINS ONTHIS SHEET OF PLASTIC THAT CAN GO THROUGH THE INK JETPRINTER, HOW DO YOU GO FROM THERE TO PRODUCING ANORGAN?Yes, that is a big challenge! So far, we have shown that when we take these cellsand have them go through this process, the cells will stay alive. That was ourmain goal to find out can we actually do this. So, we have proven that they notonly stay alive during this process, they tend to fuse and aggregate which showssome biological function. Much work still needs to be done to find out whatother changes the cells go through biological changes that we haven't measuredyet.Also, there is a challenge in how to do this in 3 dimensions. Right now, what wedo is have the cartridge move back and forth over the same areas, and you cankind of layer the cells, but there is a limit to how thick we can layer it. So, it is ahuge challenge of extending this (process) into the 3rd dimension which requiresa lot of work.I would think ink jet printing, if this technology works out, may be used fororgans that are have a distinct 3-dimensional shape such as a kidney or liver and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"profuse with blood by the blood vessels.YOUR GOAL IS TO TRY TO MAKE THESE KINDS OF ORGANS BECAUSETHERE IS SUCH A DEMAND FOR ORGANS IN TRANSPLANTS?One of my collaborators is interested in this. I personally think there is a lot ofinterest not only in human transplantations, but in drug companies using thesetissues as test beds for some of the drugs they are working on. They can makethem it's a computer-controlled machine, so they can make many of them whichare all fairly consistent.HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT IS GOING TO BE UNTIL YOU SEE A3-DIMENSIONAL ORGAN GROW UP FROM THIS PLASTIC SHEET?Right now, we are getting a network of capillaries formed in 3 dimensions. Ithink this will take us until the end of this year or into next year to do this. thenafter that, if this works successfully it is everyone's guess, depending on the kindof collaborators and expertise we can assemble and the organ we concentrate on it might take another year or two to finish that work.IN TWO OR THREE YEARS, IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL IN GROWINGTHE 3-DIMENSIONAL ORGAN, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?Well, I haven't thought about that yet. My primary goal is to overcome otherlimitations of tissue engineering at this point. I'm just looking at the technicalside of it. I would imagine there will be many - let's say this works out, manyhospitals would probably have this technology on hand where if a patient wouldneed a particular organ, they would just go and collect a sample of the patient'scells and have them grow into an organ and re-implanted (in the patient).IT'S ALMOST LIKE THE HOLODECK ON STAR TREK?Yes, that's how I describe it to my graduate students. If they a machine called a\"replicator,\" basically that's kind of what we are doing.IT'S AMAZING.Yes, it is. And we were skeptical at the beginning, but so far it is amazing to usjust to think that you can print it (cells and proteins) out on an X & Y axis.\"We b s it e s :http://www.ces.clemson.edu/bio/people/boland/boland.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
