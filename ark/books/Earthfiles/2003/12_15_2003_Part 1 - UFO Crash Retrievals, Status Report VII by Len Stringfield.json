Now, on the tenth anniversaryof his passing, I would like to honor Len Stringfield's pioneering spirit andcourage to research the politically unacceptable topic of crashed aerial vehiclesand entities of unknown origin and to report what he learned - even in the faceof threats. Earthfiles will reprint all seven of his famous \"Status Reports\" aboutalleged UFO crash retrievals covering the period of 1978 to 1994. This reprintedseries will begin with Status Report VII, first published in February 1994, andwill go backward in time to the first report in 1978. This is done with thepermission and cooperation of his surviving family. Leonard H. Stringfield1920-1994BackgroundLeonard Stringfield was born on December 17,1920, in Cincinnati, Ohio. Heattended the University of Cincinnati in journalism and served in the U. S. ArmyAir Force from early 1943 until his discharge in November 1945 as a PrivateFirst Class. He married Adella Romero in 1947 and they had three daughters. In1950, Len began working in public relations and marketing services for DuBoisChemicals, a division of Chemed Corp., in Cincinnati, Ohio.Len told me that he knew in the early 1950s that there was a standing militaryorder to try to bring down \"flying saucers,\" whatever they were. But he said theUnited States lost a lot of good pilots trying to carry out that order, so it waseventually rescinded.Len Stringfield wanted to understand the truth about the UFO phenomenon andbecame director of the Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects(CRIFO), one of the world's largest research groups during the mid-195Os. Lenalso published CRIFO's newsletter, ORBIT from 1953 to 1957. During thatsame time period, he also helped the United States Air Force investigate andreport UFO activity. Len was even assigned a special code number, \"3-0 Blue,\"with which he could report by phone to the Air Defense Command inColumbus, Ohio. Eventually, he gathered his CRIFO reports to the USAF in hisfirst book, Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue, published in 1957."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"From 1957 to 1970, he was public relations adviser with the NationalInvestigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP). Later on he wasdirector of public relations and board member of the Mutual UFO Network(MUFON). He was also regional investigator for the Center for UFO Studies(CUFOS) directed by astronomer, Dr. J. Allen Hynek. From 1967-1968 heserved as an Early Warning Coordinator for the University of Colorado UFOProject, screening UFO reports for possible scientific study. Stringfield was alsoadvisor to Sir Eric Gairy, former Prime Minister of Grenada, 1977-78, during hisefforts to establish a UFO research agency within the framework of the UnitedNations. In 1977, Len's second book was published, Situation Red: The UFOSiege, which set the stage for his continued investigation into alleged crashes ofUFO craft and their occupants - and U. S. government retrievals of those craftand entities.Stringfield continued that research after his retirement in 1981 as Director ofPublic Relations and Marketing Services for DuBois Chemicals until his deathon December 18,1994.Summary of Leonard Stringfield's publications and books:CRIFO Newsletters (1953-1957)Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue (1957) Describing Len's activities asDirector of Civilian Research, Interplanetary Flying Objects (C.R.I.F.O.)and his reports to the USAF.Situation Red : The UFO Siege (1977)Status Report I - Retrievals Of The Third Kind (1978)Status Report II - The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome (1980)Status Report III - UFO Crash/Retrievals : Amassing The Evidence(1982)Status Report IV - The Fatal Encounter At Ft.

Stringfield February 1994 I cannot tell how the truth may be;I say the tale as 'twas said to me. Sir Walter Scott Acknowledgements A special thanks to the major research organizations, such as the Fund forUFO Research for past funding, the cooperation of the Mutual UFONetwork, the J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies and the Mid-OhioResearch Associates. Also, thanks to all the contributors, entrusting me with material theysubmitted for my critique and use in this Status Report. Also, special recognition to Chris Coffey for her help in coordinating myroughly-typed copy to its final rendition on the word processor. During the summer of 1993, notably after the MUFON Symposium inRichmond, Virginia, a surprising number of new sources emerged, somemaking significant disclosures, or providing leads about UFOcrash/retrievals. s my probes deepened into several cases, I was pleased to findcorroborative data that supported an event I had learned from a source inmy earlier years of research. One case, however, stood out as a potentialbreakthrough with a promise of supporting evidence. The informant, a ladyscientist, alleged that she, as a student, under the tutelage of one of theworld's greatest scientists, accompanied him to a secret location to see thealien craft and bodies. But, the evidence never materialized, though itprovided, with other equally provocative cases, the impetus to work onanother Status Report, herewith my seventh. Many contacts were newcomers; others came through trustedintermediaries and there were the usual few who made brief disclosuresabout their knowledge of crashes or alien anatomy, but faded away likeCheshires. Through September, pondering this new collection of data, mythoughts soon drifted into my many years of investigations into thecrash/retrieval syndrome. As I got deeper into case histories, new and old, Ifound myself inexorably drawn into UFOlogy's infamous Hall of Mirrors.Like my contemporaries devoted to serious specialization, such asabductions, animal mutilations, crop circles and so on, comes a time ofreckoning. Around me, in this abode of the surreal were a mix of people,facing mirrors, seeming both real and unreal. Some looked frightened,some staunchly authoritative. Somewhere in this mix, all showing distortedimages in mirrors, were surely pawns, working with suspect agendas, betterknown as misinformants. I cannot make a final rational judgment when I look at distortions inmirrors, but despite the surrealism, I think that I can pick out some of thereal that I can trust from those of the unreal, the tricksters. At this writing, I have 45 firsthand sources who claim to have witnessedthe alien craft and/or the bodies in government custody. This is a large"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"number of independent sources since I started my research in this realm in1976. I reiterate, I believe that most are telling the truth. Following are thenew data from sources I met in the Hall of Mirrors from which to make ajudgment. New Source Confirms Arizona 1953 Crash In spite of interruptive moments of feeling subservient to the negativeinfluences of UFO crash/retrieval surreality, there are moments of reward,too. One, euphorically happened March 24, 1993, when I spoke before anopen-to-the-public meeting at the Milford Public Library near Cincinnati.This meeting was initiated by Pat Packard, the new MUFON SectionDirector in Southwestern Ohio which got a lot of widespread publicity. In my extemporaneous talk, I reviewed my crash/retrieval research inwhich I cited the first of my firsthand sources in 1977 who revealed thathe had witnessed three alien bodies arrive at Wright-Patterson AFB freshfrom a crash in Arizona in 1953. This revelation prompted a member of theaudience to stand up and ask that I repeat the place and time and thenumber of retrieved aliens. When I had finished my talk, he took me asideto reveal that he had information that would back up my 1977 source 100percent. The case in question, published first in the paper I had presented at theMUFON Symposium in Dayton, Ohio, in 1978 and republished in greaterdetail as Status Report II in 1980, is excerpted as follows:\"In September 1977, I was invited to speak before 25 pilot membersof the Cincinnati Chapter of the World Wings at Lunken Airport,Cincinnati, Ohio. Once the crowd milled away, a former U. S. ArmyWarrant Officer who had been a helicopter pilot took me alone intothe large map room of the administration building. With a pointer, heindicated an area in Arizona where a UFO crash had occurred in1953. \"I have seen the bodies,\" he said, which had arrived at night bya DC-7 at Wright-Patterson AFB where he was on special duty. The pilot at that time in 1977, who worked as an engineer, recalledthat he stood inside a hangar at a distance of about 12 feet peering atfive crates on a forklift. Inside of three of smaller size werehumanoids about 4 feet tall lying enshrouded on a fabric which heexplained prevented a freeze burn from the dry ice packed beneath. Anumber of air police stood silent guard nearby the crates. Before thecargo was whisked away, he said he got a good look at two of thecadavers closest to him. The pilot said, 'Their disproportionately largeheads, by human standards, were hairless with skin that lookedbrown under the hangar lights. The eyes were large and dark; themouth small and an indistinct nose.' Asked about their attire, he saidthey were wearing tight-fitting dark suits. He said he had no ideawhat was inside of the two additional crates. I had about a dozen private chats with the pilot since we met atLunken Airport. Once on my request, I asked if he would sign aposthumous statement describing his experience. When he checkedwith his security office, he was advised to decline. In the fall of 1978,still serving as flight commander in the national guard, he strangelybecame unreachable by phone, leaving no forwarding address. Two UFO Crashes in Arizona I have heard of a number of stories about UFO crashes in Arizona,but it was not until the meeting at the Milford Library that I gotreliable confirmation to back up the pilot's claims. My new source,JLD, a resident of Ohio, north of Cincinnati, in a surprisingdisclosure claimed that a close relative - the late Mr. Holly, who had"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"served in the top command in a defense department capacity atWright-Patterson AFB in 1953 - told him about one of two crashes inArizona. He also told him three bodies, one severely burned andparts of the wrecked craft, were delivered to that base. On July 16, 1993, when JLD and wife visited me in Cincinnati, hetold me that Holly had seen the bodies that were maintained in anoff-limits building - and it was not the legendary Hangar 18. Of note,he also learned that the aliens were free of harmful bacteria andsuffered no teeth decay. In trust, JLD gave me his relative's name, title of his position atWright-Patterson and, having the highest security clearance, wasinformed with 'eyes only' details of the Arizona incident. Said JLD, asa young teenager when he was told about the crash, his interest wasairplanes, making models of World War II aircraft and admitted thathe had a curiosity about flying saucers. However, in later years whenhe asked for more details, his relative did not wish to discuss thesubject. American Jet Disintegrated in Presence of UFO During our meeting at my home, I got another item of concern whichcame from his relative. With the highest security clearance, he hadaccess to Project Bluebook personnel from whom he learned somedetails of an air force intercept mission on the east coast nearLangley, Virginia (site of CIA headquarters) in the late 1950s.According to the story, there were four fighters in a landing pattern.Two were out of fuel and one had landed. But the fourth wasvectored in for the chase, which on close approach with the UFO,disintegrated. There was no trace of the pilot or the ejection seat.\"(End of excerpt) Military aircraft encounters with UFOs occasionally end in disaster. Somelose their electronic control systems, causing crashes or forced landings, orthey are suddenly banished from the skies without a trace. This activitysince WWII has indeed complicated the UFO agenda factor. Major Donald Keyhoe, a former head of NICAP and the premiere pioneerof the 'outer space' hypothesis, shared a few details of one encounter in theearly 1970s when three U. S. jet interceptors disappeared without a trace. Irecall asking him if I could publish the full story in my book, SituationRed: The UFO Siege. But he agreed only to the barest details, declining toname the coastal location where the incident occurred. He said he fearedhe might compromise his Pentagon source. I know of a number of off-the-record encounters with UFOs, both old andnew, most of which I never published. In one recent incident in Arizona,the instruments of two fighter jets went dead and crashed. Others, to namea hot spot, is in Puerto Rico. Three such incidents have been investigatedand released by researcher and journalist, Jorge Martin, which hepublished in a lengthy report covering intense activities on the islandreleased at the MUFON Symposium in Richmond. World War II's Foo Fighters: A 1942 Crash Case Revealed The following UFO crash/retrieval case, occurring in 1942 during WWII, isso shrouded in super secrecy that persons and places involved are not forme to know except for the identity of my informant, Mary Nunn. Using thispseudonym, and in respect to her source, she also prefers that her locationnot be identified in this report. Serving in a key civil capacity at the time ofthe incident, she said that her source could suffer severe penalties if certaindetails were divulged."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" However, to soften the stigma of no-no's, my informant seemed to shyaway from the glitzy fringe in her UFO research and has felt free, in thepast, to pass on other important and sensitive information to me withouttoo many restrictions. Some of it concerned Roswell from a former militarysource, but his guarded disclosures - minus name - are already in publicdomain and I find no need here to review them lest it may compromise herlink with her deep-throat source. Nunn's revelations about the 1942 case are sketchy, mainly dealing withthe description of the retrieved bodies and some general input regardingthe craft. She hopes that others, still alive, may share additionalinformation or at least, confirmation of the event. The spacecraft, she said, is still held at the army base where it crashedcausing damage to a building on the premises and minor ruptures to theone side of the craft. According to her source, the crash occurred in a state\"north of Georgia,\" but there was no explanation given for the reason whyGeorgia was named. Unless it was a deliberate cover, it suggests that it mayhave been in the Carolinas or somewhere north along the Atlanticseaboard. The craft generally round in shape was described as 15 feet wide and 10feet high divided into three main sections, a control room, a compartmentwith four seats and a bottom bay equipped with a trap door exit. In thecontrol section was one large window and a number of smaller windowsaround the sides. The craft, she said, was silver in color which exhibitedmarkings on its exterior as well as inside. The four crew members taken alive, died about two weeks later of apparentstarvation. Described at 5 feet tall, weighing about 90 to 100 pounds, theskin also - unlike the little greys - was a milky white, smooth like a baby'sand without hair. Facial features were generalized. The eyes large and black like bug eyes.Ears were small, lips thin slits. The fingers, numbering five, were long,bony; the feet flat, about size six with half inch bony toes. The female hadsmall breasts and, according to the source, the race could reproduce, butthere was no hint as to their genitalia. Then came the shocker: They hadteeth, very white, wide and short. With teeth, I asked about nourishment,how it was digested and eliminated. No answers. Like the greys, communications were telepathic, but when I asked aboutother details such as anatomical, organic or emotional or about their craft,propulsion and all the other usual questions, came silence. That was it.Perhaps my friend, Mary Nunn, knows more, but I am thankful for thatwhich she had trustingly shared. The 1942 crash incident, whatever the explanation, as a precursor to theRoswell affair, according to Nunn's source, happened in the summer at atime when the United States armed forces were in action worldwide. But itstill was not an historical first. In the Spring of 1941, an alleged crash andrecovery occurred in Cape Girardeau, Missouri, which is described in mystatus report, UFO Crash/Retrievals: The Inner Sanctum. Pre-WWII UFO activity, especially crashes, are a rarity and getting detailsfrom a firsthand, or a support, witness is indeed an achievement. WalterWebb, an astronomer and veteran UFO researcher, gets an \"A\" for hisextensive investigation into a UFO incident, possibly a crash involving anarmy serviceman, the late Guy Simeone, who was with the 26th InfantryDivision prior to the U. S. entry into the war. According to Webb, whowrote an in-depth monograph for CUFOS about the alleged incidententitled, An Anecdotal Report of a UFO Crash/Retrieval 1941, Simeone,who was one of 400,000 troops involved in a massive war-game maneuver"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"in the Carolinas, informed his family cryptically, that he was restrictedfrom discussing his \"secret assignment\" during operations. Later a witnesstold Webb that she overheard Simeone's mother talking about her sonbeing in a situation involving a crashed round metallic object and areference to little dead bodies from space. However, there are conflictingdetails, said Webb, from family members and friends. The best guess, saidWebb, is that something crashed in North Carolina where his unit wasactive during the month of October in 1941. Concludes Webb, \"Takingeverything into account, I believe the Simeone episode should be classifiedas a tentative unknown.\" To be continued in Part 2.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
