Thousands of images have been captured foranalysis, and yet as of November 2003, only about 3% of the Martian surfacehas been photographed. From the continual stream of images sent back toNASA, the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, California, and to MSSS, Dr. Malinplaces an image each day at his website, http://www.msss.com, that he thinks isimportant or visually interesting.On November 13, 2003, he highlighted in a special MSSS report entitled,\"'Smoking Gun' Evidence for Persistent Water Flow and Sediment Deposition onAncient Mars\" an article from the journal Science that featured analysis ofMartian images that seem to confirm once and for all that liquid water hasflowed across the Martian surface."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"A \"distributary fan,\" a geologist's term for deposits in river deltasand alluvial fans, photographed (MOC2-543a) inside a Martian crater not far fromthe Holden Crater at 24.3 degrees South/ 33.5 degrees West , between August 2000and September 2003. Image courtesy NASA/JPL/MSSS.Malin writes about the above image: \"The picture is a mosaic of Mars OrbiterCamera (MOC) high resolution images acquired between August 2000 andSeptember 2003. The area covered is 14 kilometers wide (8.7 miles) and 19.3kilometers high (12 miles). North is up and the scene is illuminated by sunlightfrom the left. The MOC NA camera takes grayscale images; the color added tothis and other images was derived from data collected nearby using the ThermalEmission Imaging System (THEMIS) Visible Imaging Subsystem, built by MalinSpace Science Systems for Arizona State University which is on-board the MarsOdyssey spacecraft.\"The picture shows the entire distributary fan. The fan is a fossil landform, aneroded remnant of a somewhat larger, somewhat thicker deposit. The originallyloose sediment has been turned to rock and then eroded over time to present thefeatures seen today. The channels through which sediment was transported areno longer present. Instead, only their floors have remained and these have beenelevated by erosion so that former channels now stand as ridges. The floors offormer channels became inverted because they were more resistant to the forcesof erosion either they were more strongly cemented than the surroundingmaterials or they have more coarse grains (which are harder to remove), orboth.\"The Distributary Fan's SignificanceThe fan's discovery \"provides clear, unequivocal evidence that some valleys onMars experienced the same type of on-going, or persistent, flow over longperiods of time as rivers do on Earth. Second, because the fan is today a depositof sedimentary rock, it demonstrates that some sedimentary rocks on Mars weredeposited in a liquid (probably water) environment (suspected but neverdemonstrated). Third, the general shape of its channels and low topographicslopes provide circumstantial evidence that the feature was actually a delta. Thatis a deposit made when a river or stream enters a body of water. In other words,the landform discovered by the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) might be thestrongest indicator yet that some craters and other depressions on Mars onceheld lakes. Although hundreds of other locations on Mars where valleys entercraters and basins have been imaged by MOC, this is the first to show landformslike these (that are so earthlike).\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The areas in white rectangles are highlighted and shown inclose-ups below.

Image courtesy NASA/JPL/MSSS.Malin summarized: \"In the above image, meanders and cut-off meanders areprime evidence for on-going, persistent flow of water through this area sometime in the Martian past. Below are inverted channels at different levels withinthe sedimentary deposit, also indicating a long and complex history of water-related processes. One ridge crosses over another just left of the center of theframe. The top of the lower ridge is the former floor of a channel that wastransporting water and sediment toward the lower right. The top of the upperridge was once the floor of a channel that moved material toward the right/upperright. The lower ridge is the older channel. It was completely filled and buriedbeneath the surface when the upper channel formed.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Inverted channels (MOC2-543d) at different levels allegedly created by flowingwater on Mars.
