Some people wondered if the announcement was pressuredby the work of Dr. Severino Antinori in Italy. He is an Italian gynecologist whosays that he is also expecting cloned human babies from his research efforts tobe born soon.Now, Dr. Boisselier and Clonaid have announced that their DNA test is on hold.In addition to her Clonaid company, Dr. Boisselier is also a member of theworldwide religious Raelian movement that believes the Elohim mentioned inthe Bible are extraterrestrials who genetically manipulated life on this planet toproduce humans. Cloning is extraterrestrial technology that the non-humanswant our planet to use, according to Rael, leader of the Raelian movement. Butin the past couple of days, Rael asked Dr. Boisselier to not let the mother of theallegedly cloned baby girl return to the United States for the DNA testing.The reason appears to be a lawsuit filed on December 31st in Broward County,Florida, by attorney Bernard Siegel. Mr. Siegel told me today that he thinks acloned human is an abused child in danger of being exploited.Bernard Siegel, Attorney, Aronfeld & Associates, Coral Gables, Florida:\"When this was announced, no governmental entity took any action that I couldsee. There was a lot of debate. There was theological debate, medical ethics, butno one seemed focused on this individual child. Now, if this child exists, thischild could have serious medical problems. Animal cloning generally endsunsuccessfully. So, it occurred to me with a child in grave risk it was the same asan abused child. Anyone who knows about an abused child has a legal andmoral obligation to take action.Under Florida law, if an individual becomes aware of an abused child, they havea right to file a dependency petition for a motion to appoint a guardian. That'sthe point of this legal action. I can't think of any child in the planet that needs aguardian more than this one.DID ANYBODY APPROACH YOU ABOUT BRINGING THIS LAWSUIT?No, I thought of it on my own. I was reflecting on the fact of how unique this is."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"It's a very intriguing legal issue. I had the ability, because I'm a lawyer, to filethis. So, on December 31, I chose to do so.The Clonaid people, out of the entire world for some reason, selected BrowardCounty, Florida, to announce this. They are involved in money-makingbusinesses there. They are participating in money conferences there. They haveat their conferences, some of there principals vacation and live part time in southFlorida. So, I felt there was a nexus, enough there, to bring this action inBroward County.DO YOU THINK YOUR FILING THIS LAW SUIT HAS HAD ANYTHING TODO WITH IN THE LAST 24 HOURS TODAY WE ARE SPEAKING ONJANUARY 3, THERE SEEMS TO BE NOW TO BE BACK PEDDLING ONTHE PART OF DR. BOISSELIER AND CLONAID ABOUT THE MOTHERBEING WILLING TO DO THE DNA ANALYSIS.I don't think the testing they are talking about is going to settle any kind of issue,really, unless it's a legitimate DNA test at an appropriate facility that isguaranteed accurate with safeguards so it's just not a publicity stunt of somekind. I don't know if we could rely on any DNA test that they would provide us.But if this happened, if this actually happened, wouldn't they present the childto Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in New York, or some serious medical center,given the fact that Dolly, for instance, is aging too rapidly and has geneticdefects. Do we want what happened to Dolly to happen to this child?They are presenting the picture that this child is a bouncing baby girl andeverything is fine and the couple is so happy. Well, what if a month from now,the child develops terrible genetic defects. There is no body of medical researchto safeguard the child. So, that's the point. The child is in danger and needs alegal guardian.IF YOU ARE SUCCESSFUL ON JANUARY 22 IN THE FIRSTARRAIGNMENT, WHAT WOULD BE THE PROCEDURES AND STEPSAFTER THAT?Well, this is really uncharted territory. This is the first legal action that is tryingto establish legal rights for a cloned person. So, again, assuming the child exists and I'm more and more skeptical as this goes on that the child does exist but thescience is out there, so it's a possibility. We really don't know. Under the law, in30 days after the arraignment, the court can set a final hearing and so the issuesdiscussed in the legal action can be resolved.\"RaelThis evening, I talked with the head of the Raelian Movement. Originally hisname was Claude Vorilhon, a former French race car journalist in the early1970s. For the past several years, he has called himself Rael, head of theworldwide Raelian movement that was granted official religious status byQuebec, Canada in the 1990s. The Raelian membership is said to be 55,000 andthe biggest concentration is in Japan. In the second half-hour, we will hear Raeldescribe his encounter with an extraterrestrial in France in 1973, whocommunicated that the French man's mission would be to bring cloning to theearth.I asked Rael if Florida Attorney Bernard Siegel's lawsuit in Broward County iswhy Rael has recommended to chemist Brigitte Boisselier, head of Clonaid, thatthe parents not come forward and have the DNA testing done on the allegedlycloned baby girl.Rael, Leader of the worldwide Raelian Movement, Montreal, Canada:\"Exactly. You have described it perfectly the truth. When I learn about this, Ithink he (lawyer) is trying to get some huge publicity for his own career. I am soshocked to say the mere reason is the cloning process, which of course disturbssome people, but I cannot accept the idea of giving custody of a guardian"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"(because someone says it is a) handicapped children. I think all the handicappedpeople of the world should be extremely revolted this very idea.I called Dr. Boisselier and said you have to choose now between your credibilityand the future of this child and my opinion, the future of the child is moreimportant. And that was my advice to her and I think she agree with her.COULD YOU NOT PROCEED WITH GETTING THE DNA ANALYSIS DONEON THE BABY AND PRESENTING IT AS OFTEN LABS DO IN WHICHTHE PARENTS, THE CHILD, COULD REMAIN ANONYMOUS AND NOTIDENTIFIED, BUT INFORMATION COULD BE PRESENTED TOINDEPENDENT MEDICAL PEOPLE TO LOOK AT IT AND SAY ONE WAYOR THE OTHER IF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT IS TRUE THAT THIS IS ACLONED BABY BECAUSE THIS IS BECOMING SUCH ACONTROVERSY?I think it will be possible at the time, but right now, I think for me there is a bigdangerous for the removal of the child. The future and happiness andpsychological balance of the child and mother are of the utmost importance. Ithink in the future it will be possible, but we have to wait until all danger ofseparating this family is finished.Even through an independent team of scientists, the more you put people in asecret, the more the identity of the family could be revealed. So, these peopledon't want to be in a circus exhibition and they want to have their private lifeprotected and I agree with that.TODAY, THERE WAS A HEADLINE THAT CLONAID SAYS THERE WILLBE A SECOND BIRTH BY THIS COMING SUNDAY IN EUROPE?Yes, I learned about that and when we talk about Dr. Boisselier a long time agoand she started the company, I said what would be great is if one day if you canhave a lesbian or gay couple to have a child among the first people, you willhelp. I understand this next child will be the child of a European lesbian coupleand I think this is beautiful.WILL YOU THEN BE ABLE TO MORE IMMEDIATELY PRESENT DNAANALYSIS THAT THAT CHILD IS CLONED?I hope so. Not me, but Dr. Boisselier. I think she would like to have it happenbecause she created this company for profit and the more she can give credibilityto her company and the more money she will make and good for her.DO YOU THINK SHE FELT UNDER SOME TIME URGENCY PRESSURETO MAKE THIS PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT ON DECEMBER 26WITHOUT DNA RESULTS BECAUSE DR. ANTONARI IN ITALY IS SAYINGHE IS CLOSE TO ANNOUNCING CLONED BIRTHS?I think there was a competition from the beginning between them and a fewother things. I remember when we were testifying in front of the AmericanCongress, already I could feel this competition between them and I am notsurprised that they tried to do it as fast and as safe but at the same time.BUT IT DOES APPEAR NOW SINCE DECEMBER 26 THATCONTROVERSY IS GROWING IN WASHINGTON AND THERE IS MOREAND MORE TALK THAT THE CONGRESS IN THE UNITED STATES WILLMOVE TOWARD BANNING ALTOGETHER OR PUT A MORATORIUM ONANY CLONING IN THE UNITED STATES.Yes, but we are going through one more time what happened 22 years ago I don'tknow if you remember the first test tube baby, Liz Brown, was born. There wasa kind of same headlines in newspapers 'They are playing God. They are playingFrankenstein. They will create monsters. Handicap children.' The same thing.Liz Brown is a person now, she is healthy. In the world now, you have morethan 200,000 babies born through in vitro fertilization who are most of them inperfect health. In vitro fertilization is happening every day and well accepted. I"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"am sure that 20 years from now, it will be the same for human cloning. We arethe beginning and, of course, all the conservative people must live by religiousprejudice against it (cloning).They will try like it was done 22 years ago there was a law banning in vitrofertilization. Then the families went to the Supreme Court and the Court saidthey have a right to have a baby the way they want. And many people say that ifthis case goes to the Supreme Court, human cloning will win.\" Robert Lanza, M. D., Advanced Cell TechnologyOne of the world's experts on cloning research is Dr. Robert Lanza, VicePresident of Medical and Scientific Development at Advanced Cell Technologyin Worcester, Massachusetts. Dr. Lanza received his medical degree from theUniversity of Pennsylvania in 1983 and then worked with Dr. Christian Bernardon heart transplants, worked with Dr. Jonas Salk at the Salk Institute andpublished papers with B. F. Skinner at Harvard University. Dr. Lanza has been aco-author on the book, Principals of Cloning and Principals of TissueEngineering. He and his colleagues cloned the world's first embryo and clonedthe first endangered animal.I asked Dr. Lanza today why he thinks Clonaid held a major press conference toannounce a cloned baby without having the DNA verification first?Robert Lanza, M. D., Vice President of Medical and ScientificDevelopment, Advanced Cell Technology, Worcester, Massachusetts: \"Youdon't make such an important announcement without any scientific data tosubstantiate your claims. So, one would have to wonder whether or not this wasto generate publicity perhaps to raise funding or whatever, but certainly this isnot the way we do things in science.WHAT IS YOUR MEDICAL OPINION SINCE YOU HAVE SUCH A DEEPBACKGROUND HAVING TO DO WITH ISSUES OF CLONING ANDGENETIC WORK WHAT IS YOUR REACTION AS A PROFESSIONAL TOTHEIR EFFORTS TO CLONE A HUMAN BEING?Well, we are appalled. It is scientifically irresponsible and we're in particularconcerned about the backlash that this could cause. It could cripple animportant area of medical research that has the potential to eliminate a range ofserious diseases.HOW COULD IT CRIPPLE IT?We are concerned there is going to be tremendous pressure now on the U. S.Congress to ban all forms of cloning. Of course, all of society from scientists topoliticians are against human reproductive cloning. No one wants to see 100copies of Madonna or Michael Jordan. But it would be tragic if this outragespills over into the legitimate medical research which could cure millions ofpatients.YOU MEAN, I THINK, STEM CELL RESEARCH?Yes. The use of therapeutic cloning to generate stem cells that could then beused to fix a damaged heart if you had heart disease or to generate insulin-producing cells if you had diabetes, or neurons if you had Parkinson's disease.According to the most recent data, about 3,000 Americans die every day fromdiseases that stem cells could be used to treat. We know, for instance, that thistechnology already in animals can be used to treat a damaged heart. We'veactually used this technology to generate miniature kidneys. It has been used toreverse diabetes in mice and even rats that have been paralyzed have had theirmovement partially restored. So, I think the promise here is enormous and Ithink it would be really tragic if we were to eliminate the possibility ofdeveloping this technology to help these patients who are desperately in need."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"IF SOME PARENTS WHO ARE DESPERATE FOR A CHILD AND HADTRIED OTHER FERTILITY APPROACHES WENT TO YOUR GROUP ANDSAID, 'WE REALLY WANT A CHILD AND IF CLONING IS THE ONLY WAYTO HAVE IT, THIS IS WHAT WE WANT.' WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TOTHEM?Absolutely not! It would be very much like sending the mom and the baby up ina rocket with a 20 to 30% chance it was going to blow up. You simply do not dothat in medicine. It's just not acceptable.BECAUSE THE TERRITORY IS TOO UNKNOWN AND YOU CAN'T GIVEANY GUARANTEES?Yes, oh absolutely! The procedure is highly variable. Also, too, there are verysevere ethical and moral issues here, that many of us don't find acceptable, asidefrom the safety issues.WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IN EXPLAINING WHAT THE ETHICAL ANDMORAL ISSUES ARE TO YOU?Well, I think it poses very serious psychological questions and I think most ofsociety finds it abhorrent that you would be creating identical copies of anindividual. I don't think anyone wants to go down that slope.AND IN FACT, IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT THE MOTHER IN THISCASE, IF IT WERE A CLONED BABY AND IF SHE WERE MARRIED ANDHAD A HUSBAND, AT SOME POINT THE FATHER WOULD BE LOOKINGAT AN IDENTICAL MATCH TO WHO HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH ATSOME TEENAGE OR YOUNG YEAR.Oh, certainly, there are all sorts of problems you can foresee if this technologywere to be abused to generate children. That's just one.IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TODAY RIGHT NOW TO TALK WITH DR.BOISSELIER, WHAT WOULD YOU WANT TO ASK HER?Give us some evidence! Obviously at this point here, we are getting concernedthat this is just a hoax.\" Rael's Alleged Encounter With An Extraterrestrial in 1973What happened to Claude Vorilhon, also known as Rael, in France 30 years agothat inspired his obsession with cloning humans and creating the Raelianmovement?Rael, Leader of the worldwide Raelian Movement, Montreal, Canada: \"In1973, I was a race car journalist and race car driver myself in France andpublisher of a number one company of race cars in France. I was on my way tomy office. It was about 9 a.m. Something guided me with my car to a volcano, adead volcano, which is close to the city of Clermont-Ferrand, not so far fromLyons in the center of France.I went to this volcano in my car and then in this volcano I stopped my car andwent by foot to the center of the crater. And then I saw in the sky a very strongflashing light and without any noise, a huge craft appeared which was shapedlike a flattened bell made of a very shiny silver metal and this object cameslowly down. And I have to summarize because it took a long time, but a smallhuman being came outside looking a little bit more like Asian people thanEuropeans. He came to me and that was the beginning of it and he started togive me the message he wanted me to spread on the earth. And I can summarizethis message if you like.YES."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"OK, these people are the Elohim the Bible talks about. As you may know, theBible doesn't talk about gods, but the first word you have is Elohim and Elohimin Hebrew means 'those who came from the sky.' It doesn't mean at all, 'god.'That was a wrong translation.In fact, the Bible describes the creation of life on earth by the advancedcivilization, the Elohim, using DNA mastering genetic engineering. They wereexactly at the same level of science that we are about to be today. We start to docloning, we start to create artificial life. A few months ago, the scientists createdon earth the first synthetic virus and they will create soon some small syntheticanimals. So, they did all these things, exactly like it is happening on the earthnow.WAS THERE CONCERN THEN IN 1973 THAT CLONING SHOULDBECOME A PART OF THE REPRODUCTIVE EVOLUTION OF OURPLANET?Yes, more than that. They explained to me that on their planet, they havereached the level of eternal life with a different body using cloning. And theysaid this would come soon on the earth. 'You have to prepare humanity to beready for that because it is a key to reach eternal life' like we are doing on ourplanet, we will be soon able to do the same.AND IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY, THEY WERE TALKING ABOUTAN ETERNAL LIFE IN WHICH THE CONTAINERS OF THE BODIESCOULD BE MADE FROM CLONING AN INDIVIDUAL OVER AND OVERAGAIN AND TRANSFERRING THE LIFE FORCE OF THE INDIVIDUALFROM CLONE TO CLONE?Yes, when you are about to die, you just clone yourself younger and you transferall the data in your brain which makes you who you are memory, personality,everything in this new body and you can do it again and again and again andthat is the secret of eternal life through different bodies.\"More Information:For more about the transfer of life force from dying human bodies to clonedhuman bodies under the control of non-human entities, please see Glimpses ofOther Realities, Volume II: High Strangeness in the Earthfiles Shop.We b s it e s :http://www.clonaid.comhttp://www.rael.orgCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
