The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the United Statesis now reporting 39 suspected cases in 18 states. Today, fourteen new cases ofSARS were reported in Singapore, bringing the new total to 65. Twelve patientsare in serious condition in intensive care.The Singapore government on Monday announced 740 people there might havebeen exposed to SARS patients and ordered them to stay quarantined in theirhomes for the next ten days. This is the first time Singapore's Infectious DiseasesAct has been applied and is the largest government-ordered quarantine since themysterious SARS pneumonia emerged in February to March 2003. Anyquarantined person caught outside their home will face a monetary fine as highas $2,825 U. S.In addition to investigations of the Paramyxo virus, CDC announced today that\"a previously unrecognized virus from the Corona virus family is now a leadingcandidate for the viral cause of the SARS pneumonia syndrome.Corona viruses are named because their shape is like a sun with rays. Discoveredin the 1960s, France's Laboratory of Human and Molecular Virology reported in1998 that in human medicine Corona viruses can cause colds and might beimplicated in Multiple Sclerosis, Necrotizing Enterocolitis and LowerRespiratory Tract Infections, particularly in infants. But the biology of theseRNA viruses is complex and poorly understood.SARS is an acronym for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, an atypicalpneumonia that rapidly attacks alveoli lung tissue. CDC confirms that:\"Some of the individuals with the severe SARS pneumonia and death havebeen relatively healthy, middle-aged people, and that tells us that this is adisease that can be virulent and life-threatening, even among those who areotherwise probably immunologically healthy. ...Further, the high attackrate in health care workers caring for the early hospitalized patients ...suggests that it is certainly contagious.\" United StatesSuspected SARS pneumonia cases in the United States have climbed to 39 in 18states.California 10Connecticut 1Hawaii 3Illinois 1Maine 1Massachusetts 1Michigan 2Missouri 2"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Mississippi 1New Jersey 1New Mexico 1North Carolina 2New York 5Pennsylvania 1Rhode Island 1Te x a s 3Utah 1Virginia 2Total Suspected U.
