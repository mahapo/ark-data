Smith, Freedland Publishers Chapter 2, Part ThreeBlueprint for Confusion\"HELICOPTER MENACES GIRLS,\" 7:10 PM,July 24, 1975, Ranchland Farm News, Simla, Elbert County, Colorado.Photograph © 1975 by John Hines, Editor and Publisher.\"At 6 PM, the chopper had hovered over three teenaged girls and followed themas they ran. When it returned, and the above picture was taken, it wasobserved through binoculars and identified as the same machine: 'Very darkgreen, without a mark on it.' Then it came back at 11 PM when, 'It hoveredover the barn and had a brilliant light shining underneath.' - John Hines, Ranchland Farm News, Simla, Colorado, July 1975 he helicopter theory has some serious drawbacks. A Colorado Bureau ofInvestigation (CBI) spokesman has observed that the helicopters to do what'srequired would cost between a quarter and a half million dollars, cost $90/hourfor fuel alone, and have only a 150 mile working range. That's not even tomention the upkeep, and the NOISE!! If whoever's doing this did not care to getan almost unlimited supply of all those organs for little or nothing at any one ofa thousand packing plants, they could easily afford to keep large herds of theirown for a fraction of the cost of their helicopters.Also, from many points of view, those helicopter flights would be extremelydangerous. by this time, one would have crashed. And the operations are knownto cover many hundreds of miles at the same time. Where could all thosevehicles be kept hidden? Could a noisy chopper swoop down time after timeunerringly on cattle without spooking them? Could it do that even once?Helicopter noise comes primarily from the rotor rather than from the engine orexhaust. The silent ones haven't been invented yet. They aren't eventheoretically possible.Still, because of the widely reported fact that unexplainable helicopter activityseems to accompany cattle mutilations not only in Colorado, but also in otherstates where the phenomenon occurs, a connection can't be summarily dismissedas impossible. Extremely powerful ground lights moving from one point of thesky to another aren't necessarily helicopters."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The same phenomenon has long been associated with UFOs. In Montana, whenmutilations were also occurring, those lights were shutting down automobileignition systems, something helicopters don't do. (The Billings Gazette, Billings,Montana, October 1975.)And if they are as silent as many witnesses have reported them to be, that couldbe extremely intriguing. Maybe helicopters, especially silent ones, could belinked to mutilations, but in a more or less diversionary sort of way. If thosechoppers were being supported from above instead of merely by their rotors,then the rotors could freewheel and make almost no noise. It would look like anormal helicopter, but not fly like one. Its home base could be a hangarhundreds of miles up in the sky. Range could be unlimited because there wouldbe no need of refueling, landing, or getting caught. That's not nearly as far out asit might seem at first glance. One important aspect of cattle mutilation isappearance, the \"calling card\" part, and pseudo helicopters would fit into thatvery n eat l y.Where would the (animal mutilators) get the choppers? What most people havenot grasped yet is that cattle mutilation is only one very tiny aspect of animmense operation, the biggest, most complex and important operation thisworld has ever seen. Where would they get the choppers? They are parked inlong lines at Ft. Carson, for one very handy place. The mutilators would simplyhelp themselves to one, or to several, or to all of them whenever they wanted todo that. They'd just lift them up into the air where they'd disappear into the blue. High StrangenessFantastic? Maybe not. Strange things are happening in the world today. How doyou know that hasn't happened? If the truth were known, it probably has. Forexample, a five ton wrecking ball belonging to the Dowling ConstructionCompany in Indianapolis was left hanging 200 feet in the air one night and thenext morning, it had mysteriously disappeared. Five tons of solid steel hanginghigh in the air in the city of Indianapolis that no one has ever accounted for oreven known who would have wanted it. In Scranton, Pennsylvania, a hugedisabled bulldozer vanished one night without leaving a track. (Saga Magazine,New York City, November 1975, \"The Space Vandals\" by John A. Keel.)Hundreds of thousands of cars are stolen every year and airplanes are eveneasier to take. A major part of the lost vehicles is never accounted for. True, theoverwhelming majority of them end up in somebody's very mundane garage orhangar. But are we sure they all do? The same with cattle. A thousand head areslaughtered surreptitiously and end up in someone's locker for every one that'smutilated. Still, the fact is that a few ARE being mutilated for show purposesand for a few economically worthless organs rather than rustled for resale or forthe meat.Whoever follows the news has heard of whole houses being stolen. The ownersget home and there's only a vacant lot waiting for them. How could anyoneexpect to get away with a house? Yet, it's not uncommon. Stone houses andbarns have been taken, according to John Keel's article.How could things like that be taken and not easily traced? It seems incredible,but it happens. Keep things like that in mind because they'll be happening moreand more often. An article some years ago in Readers' Digest told of an orangehelicopter removing weathervanes from houses and barns in New England.Helicopters are expensive to buy and to operate. How could that illegal,dangerous and enraging activity be made to pay off? Have the cases ever beensolved? Were the culprits brought to justice?Another common phenomenon is the toppling of gravestones, whole lines ofthem. Kids? Vandals? Kids have been around a long time, so moderngravestones are rebarred into concrete footers. A truck or a bulldozer might"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"topple them, but hardly kids. Yet, hundreds of graveyards have been vandalizedlike that. Is this another form of calling card? Authorities usually try to hushthings like that up. As with cattle mutilations, the theory is that if the callingcards are kept from the public, then our visitors will go away. That may turn outlike the plagues that were visited on Egypt. We can be sure Pharaoh and hisadvisors did everything in their power to keep the facts from their people. Theyfinally received calling cards that could not possibly be overlooked or hidden.(The Bible, Exodus, Chapters 5-14) The Lord had something bigger than Egyptin mind then, and something far bigger even than that for the whole world now.In the news now, as the reader might have heard, is the removal of huge treesfrom homes and from parks. Lumber, of course, is valuable these days. But is itworth that much? How can ordinary folks expect to get away with huge trees,often from the middle of town? Watch to see if those tree snatchers are broughtto justice. Strange things like that, and like cattle mutilation, are happening allthe time now. But unless they are fitted into a pattern, they can't becomprehended and slip quickly out of mind. For the most part, police areashamed to even record such things, let alone think seriously about them. Ifsomeone looked closely at weathervane snatching, he'd probably discover it's asmystifying as cattle mutilation. but as long as we absolutely refuse to look at athing, it's impossible to really see it - unless we come home some evening andfind a mysterious vacant place where our house used to be.Accepting the far out explanation that our former home is now parked inside ahuge aerial ship 500 miles up in the sky, what possible reason could there be forthat? The same basic reasons there are cattle mutilations. those people, andthere are many of them, are coming from very far away. They are extremelyinterested in examining and analyzing every minute detail of our homes. Theycan learn a great deal from that very easily. And there's the idea of their callingcard, making us aware that they can do things like that. Shaking us out of ourstupidity. Trying to wake people up, if possible.One explanation that has been forwarded, and that will be ultimately accepted ifthe CBI authorities in other states can have their way, is that the cattlemutilation phenomenon can be attributed almost entirely to predators. That's byfar the most convenient theory for whoever is willing to turn his back on thefacts and refuse to see what should be obvious. Predators are like the poor thatwe have with us always. People who tend livestock have lived with predatorsfrom time immemorial. It should be apparent to city folks that those who haveseen coyotes, foxes, skunks, badgers, hawks, buzzards, crows and magpies alltheir life are at least equally familiar with what various predators can do.Cattlemen, by the way, tend to regard coyotes as more beneficial thandetrimental.Experienced stockmen have seen many animals die. City folks may spend largesums of money and go to ridiculous lengths to keep death out of sight and out ofmind. But to ranchers and farmers, even as children, seeing things die is acommonplace experience. To help put these facts in perspective for city readerswe might consider another cattle story in the Canon City Daily Record. It wasnot in any way related to cattle mutilation, and no rancher or farmer could everget the two very different phenomena mixed up in his mind. Natural Predators Won't Eat Mutilated AnimalsThe headline of the story is: \"AREA RANCHERS LOSE SEVERALHUNDRED CATTLE TO OAK POISON.\" Accompanying the story is a pictureof several dozen cattle lying dead in a little meadow. This happened, we aretold, because of the unseasonably cold wet weather. Snow covered the grasswhile the oak brush was retarded by cold weather and became unusually toxic.Many ranchers fed extra hay, but still the losses were heavy. One rancher lost 70head and expected to lose over 100. Another lost 30 and expected at least 10more deaths. So, dead animals aren't an oddity. Those who have been inbusiness a long time or in a big way have seen hundreds of carcasses and they"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"inevitably attract predators.It would be redundant to present more evidence here that what stockmen aretalking about in cattle mutilations is a very different phenomenon than thecommon feeding of various kinds of birds and animals on carcasses. That mightsell in the city, but it won't among those who can see the situation with theirown eyes and experience it in their pocketbooks. In fact, the predator theory ofcattle mutilation does not even rise to the level of normality because it has beenobserved that in many cases, the birds and animals that have always fed on othercarcasses refuse to touch mutilated ones.That's how it was with Jim and Roma Lee Russell's heifer. She was left whereshe was found, an obvious place beyond the barns and corrals and in sight of thehouse. But no predators, not even magpies, were ever attracted to the carcassand finally insects devoured her, a most unusual circumstance they had neverheard of before. Other references to this predator avoidance have already beenquoted in examples such as bears in Idaho and even maggots in GunnisonCounty. Do bears, coyotes, skunks, magpies and even maggots avoid carcassesjust because they've been touched by humans? That's ridiculous.\"Kenny Blake frowned. 'It was a young heifer missing both ears, the lefteye, its sex organs and its rectum' Blake figured it had been dead maybethree days. But he thought it was odd how maggots ate right up to theareas that had been mutilated and then stopped. He'd never seen anythinglike that before.\" (The Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles, California,September 11, 1975.) What might be much less ridiculous is that mutilated carcasses, and especiallythe cut areas, are sometimes sprayed or coated with something to repelpredators. Why would that be done? To make sure the mutilations arerecognized for what they actually are. The repellent would be another form ofcalling card. Have any labs checked for that? We doubt it, and also doubt thatlabs would know what they had after they had found it. Can we conclude fromthis that predators are inherently smarter than scientists? The story now is that all but a tiny fraction of the so-called mutilations are infact only the normal damage caused by common predators. Here is the latest andperhaps final bit of CBI wit and wisdom obediently delivered nationwide to thegullible public by the big time news services: \"DENVER (AP) - An extensiveinvestigation by the Colorado Bureau of Investigations indicates that humanswere responsible for only a few cattle mutilations in the state. A CBI reportindicates that of the 203 suspected cases of cattle mutilations, only eleven coulddefinitely be attributed to humans. The rest were caused by predators.\" (TheGrand Junction Sentinel, Grand Junction, Colorado, December 14, 1975.) Now there is a beautiful leap of logic for you by the man who says he \"onlydeals with the facts.\" Ah! Very true!! But HOW does he deal with them? Therehave been lots of those dealers in high government positions lately. A few didtime in the pen for dealing that way with facts before grand juries. Yet, this iswhat goes out over the wires of the news services and settles like a pall ofignorance over the whole land, showing, among other things, how naive,gullible, self-serving and downright dumb big time reporters can be. Let's analyze that Associated Press news release a little. \"203 suspected cases,\"means 203 cases reported to the CBI. Not all sheriffs reported their cases tothem, and many more ranchers and farmers did not report mutilations even totheir own sheriffs. Some mutilations were probably never found or recognized asmutilations if they were found. It's a big country out there. So \"the suspectedcases\" must be twice or maybe three times the number stated. \"Eleven could definitely be attributed to humans. The rest were caused bypredators.\" But how does that conclusion follow from those premises when itisn't even related to them. Couldn't they see that? We can be sure they could.They just wanted to flim flam the public, who they must think is too dumb to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"see through their shell games. Let's see what this AP story says the CBI bases its remarkable conclusion on. Itcontinues, \"He (Carl Whiteside, Director, CBI) said veterinarians at Colorado StateUniversity conducted animal autopsies on 19 animals and discovered 9 hadbeen mutilated by humans.\" (The Grand Junction Sentinel, GrandJunction, Colorado, December 14, 1975.) In other words, about half of their tiny sample had been unmistakably mutilatedby humans. What about the hundreds of cases they did not examine andtherefore, could not possibly have evaluated? Just because the CBI has notexamined a thing does that mean it had not existed? One Elbert County womanthought \"predators\" might someday attack the CBI. Furthermore, \"He (Whiteside) said of the many cases reported in five otherstates, only one was laid to a human. And that case, in Wyoming, wasqualified with the word 'possibly,' Whiteside said. Hasn't he ever heard about Watergate? A lot of politicians have not, but theAmerican people, fortunately, have. Let's consider other aspects of that \"predator\" theory, since there is more to itthan meets the eye. We can begin with what is obvious and then work our waygradually to the subtle. First, its timing is all wrong. It's not in midsummer, butin midwinter that predators really get voracious. the mutilations in Coloradohappened at exactly the wrong season for it to have been unusual predatoractivity. Second, how did the predators get to the carcasses and do all that mischiefwithout leaving any tracks, not in soft sand, or in dust, or in mud, or in snow? Third, why did the mutilators, in almost every case, make off with large patchesof hide? It's true that all predators will eat hide. But they have to be hard up todo it. Yet, here they've very carefully removed the hide without ever touchingthe choice meat that the mutilation operation exposes. Very unusual predators. Fourth, why don't the mutilators ever eat any of the choice meat? Whenevermeat has been taken from a carcass it is not considered to have been amutilation. fifth, why do they almost invariably take ears? It's true that predators sometimeschew the ears off newborn stock. But old ears are not the least succulent, andthey have wax in them which nature has designed to repel insects. Predators donot relish that wax either. Nor is tongue a choice item on the predator menu.They are rough, touch, harden quickly and are generally left till last. Steaks,when available, are always preferred and in these cases, steak is always availablebut is never taken.\" Continued in Chapter 2, Part Four.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Refund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
