But the travelerstold Delsey Knoechelman that thought the soybean field was glowing anddescribed the appearance as similar to turning on a car headlight in the middleof a field filled with fog. A similar glowing field phenomena has been reportedin England as well. September 6, 2003 Enschede, The Netherlands:The Geometry of the Serpent Mound, Ohio FormationTed Robertson, Jeffrey Wilson, Roger Sugden, Tony and Delsey Knoechelmanworked hard on August 29th to measure the Serpent Mound formation and Tedmade a diagram with measurements.Survey diagram © 2003 by Ted Robertson based on field survey at soybeanformation near Serpent Mound, Adams County, Ohio, on morning of August 29, 2003.Some Dimensions:271 feet from top of large ring to bottom of small, ringed circle. Thelongest length of the formation is oriented east to west.The diameter of the \"Eye\" circle is 74 feet.The horizontal diameter of the \"Eye pupil\" is 21 feet 8 inches.From the outside of the \"left midline circle\" to the outside of the \"rightmidline circle\" = 198 feet.Bottom ringed small circle:Ring measures north to south: 42 feet 3 inches and east to west: 44 feet 4inches Circle inside the small ring is 20 feet 1 inch in both north/south andeast/west axis.

Simple, elegant, eye-catching. It can be reconstructed, itdoes make sense and it is not a random collection of circles and rings. See mydiagrams. First I included a diagram of the formation itself.Diagram based on aerial photograph of Serpent Mound, Ohio,crop formation first reported August 24, 2003. Diagram © 2003 by Bert Janssen.Then I made diagrams with red circles in them so you can see how the core ofthe formation is based on a Vesica Piscis. It is constructed by drawing two equalcircles so that the center of each lies on the circumference of the other.Chalice Well and its Vesica Piscis covering in Glastonbury, Somerset,England from Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles.Diagrams 2, 3 and 4 with red circles © 2003 by Bert Janssen.After that, the two red circles that form this Vesica Piscis are used again, butnow their centers are on the intersection points of the first two red circles."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Interestingly enough, these four red circles form the basis of the two 'Cats-Eye'formations we had in Wiltshire at Fyfield near Marlborough on June 21, 1998,and Furze Hill the next day on June 22, 1998.Fyfield near Marlborough, Wiltshire, England, reportedon June 21, 1998.

Samuels.Furze Hill, Wiltshire, England, reported on June 22, 1998.Aerial photograph © 1998 by Lucy Pringle.Now we can draw a fifth red circle (same dimension as the other four) with itscenter in the center of the formation and all comes together. The top little circleforms the center of the outer ring."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Are There Any Similarities with Morgan's Hill,Wiltshire, England, Reported August 3, 2003?See: Earthfiles 080503\"There are not that many similarities between Serpent Mount and Morgan's Hill.They do look the same but that is because both have a Vesica Piscis included.Morgan's Hill is based on three circles with a radii ratio of 2, 3, 4. With that Imean that if the radius of the smallest circle in Morgan's Hill is 50, then theradius of the middle circle is 75 and the radius of the biggest circle is 100.The Serpent Mound formation in Ohio is based on two circles - or three if youcount the small one in the center of the Vesica Piscis as well. If this small one is25, then the circles that form the Vesica Piscis are 50 and the larger circle is66.144, a little more than 66. You can see that the ratios do differ a lot betweenthe Morgan's Hill and Ohio patterns.\"We b s it e s :http://www.cropcirclenews.comhttp://www.bertjanssen.nlhttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://home.clara.net/lucy pringlehttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://www.cccrn.cahttp://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.invisiblecircle.de and http://www.invisiblecircle.org/ser/d-archiv-2003.htmlhttp://www.kornkreise.chhttp://www.heramagazine.nethttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmhttp://www.bltresearch.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
