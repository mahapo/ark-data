Sonar images© 2000 by ADC International, Inc. and used with permission. September 24, 2003 Havana, Cuba - It was a summer day in 2000 that thefirst surprising side scan sonar images of what looked like architecture were seena half mile down off the western tip of Cuba. The ocean floor there is very flatand covered with white sand. The camera was run by the Remote OperatedVideo control room on the \"BIC Ulises\" ship owned and operated by engineerand oceanographer, Paulina Zelitsky, and her husband and business partner,Paul Weinzweig co-owners of Advanced Digital Communications International,Inc. or ADC International, Inc. Paulina was born and educated in the SovietUnion and was assigned to work in Cuba. Later, after she married Paul, aCanadian citizen, ADC was based in Canada. More recently, ADC Internationalhas become an international business company incorporated in theCommonwealth of the Bahamas to conduct deep ocean bottom survey in theCaribbean and Gulf of Mexico.

Its limestone,clay and sand substrata is geologically more similar to theYucatan Peninsula than the island of Cuba.Back in 2000, Paulina Zelitsky had been contracted to take ocean currenttemperatures at various depths for a global warming study and was working inthe waters northeast of Cabo San Antonio offshore from the GuanacahabibesPeninsula. That peninsula is geologically anomalous compared to the rest ofCuba and geologists think it originated from the continental margin of theYucatan Peninsula. Both have lots of porous limestone mixed with bentoniteclay and extremely fine sand. What stunned Paulina about the unexpectedstructures on the sea floor were the 90 degree angles and regular spacing of largeobjects as deep as 2200 feet.Dr. Manuel Iturralde, Ph.D., Geologist at the National Museum of NaturalHistory in Havana, presented a scientific paper about his examination of the sidescan sonar images and videos of the stone structures referred to as megalithicbecause they seem to be shaped or molded.Manuel Iturralde, Ph.D., Geologist, Cuba's National Museum of Natural History in Havana,going over maps and side scan sonar data with ocean engineer, Paulina Zelitsky,co-owner, ADC International, Inc, Havana.

Paulina had discovered in late 1998 the100-year-old battleship, The Maine, that blew up mysteriously in 1898, killed260 American sailors and set off the Spanish-American War. So when she sawthe Cuban side scan sonar images with 90 degree angles and long, straightcorridors, she thought of Meso American architecture and places likeTeotihuacan."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Teotihuacan, Mexico archaeological remains from Chronology and Catastrophism Review,Vol. 1, 1999, showing three mile long Avenue of the Dead passing the 15-story-highPyramid of the Sun and square stepped buildings spaced along the avenue.Teotihuacan might have been the largest city on Earth 2,000 years ago.Archaeologists estimate that nearly a quarter of a million people inhabitedhouses, apartments and palaces covering almost ten square miles on thenortheast outskirts of what we know today to be Mexico City.Pyramid of the Moon built at Teotihuacan, Mexico, between A.D. 150 and 225,its base measures 492 feet on each side and its height is 138 feet. The bigger Pyramidof the Sun also has a square base, measures 738 feet on each side and rises 210 feet high.Teotihuacan was dominated by the 15-story-high Pyramid of the Sun and thePyramid of the Moon, plus the smaller but intricately carved Pyramid ofQuetzacoatl. Aztecs did not discover Teotihuacan until the 1400s and gave themysterious place the name \"Teotihuacan,\" which in the Aztec language meant\"City of the Gods\" The Aztecs were impressed by the city's size, splendor andthe huge rectangular rocks that fit closely together in its buildings and pyramids.Teotihuacan's most important religious structures were concentrated in theceremonial center of the city, an area about two square miles in size. A greatavenue ran north south for three miles with buildings arranged symmetrically oneither side while other streets intersected going east and west in a perpendiculargrid pattern. The pyramid sizes ranged from 492 (Moon) to 738 feet (Sun) basesand rose as high as 210 feet.Those dimensions are similar to the estimated sizes of some of the deepunderwater megalithic structures ADC International, Inc. has on sonar images.On videotape, there are also singular, large, granite-like stones that are curvedwith an unidentified line detail, or squared off, or one that seems to be apyramid-shape rising up out of a rectangular stone."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Rounded, megalithic granite-like rock with unidentified line detail.Video image © 2002 by ADC International, Inc.Squared off large block of granite-like stone amid megalithic structuresa half mile deep covering an estimated 10 square kilometers.Video image © 2002 by ADC International, Inc.Pyramid shape seems \"carved out of\" massive rectangular stonethat can be seen behind the pyramid glowing in the glare of the ROV's light(Remote Operated Video).

Or natural mineral or marine life deposit?Video image © 2002 by ADC International, Inc.Interview:Paul Weinzweig, Partner with Paulina Zelitsky, Advanced DigitalCommunications International, Inc., Havana, Cuba: \"We're still veryinterested and excited about the initial finds that we made in cooperation withDr. Iturralde. He's taken a respectable conservative, but intelligent, approach:'We don't know what it is, but it doesn't look like geology to us.'Where we stand really is that we have the sonar images which showarchitectural types of structures with geometry, perpendicular lines, symmetries,that one does not tend to find in nature and are not repeated anywhere else inthe region. They are extensive and large and we have video, but is suggestivebecause the stones that we have videotaped are very large, very smooth. They donot belong to the local geology at all, according to our ocean bottom surveywork and to Dr. Iturralde. And the stones appear to have some aspects of cutand polished features.Paulina and I do feel that we have found something remarkable. Our intuitiontells us in addition to the data that we have that there is a good chance that therewas some remarkable civilization on an island many thousands of years ago tothe west of present day Cuba.AND THE SIZES OF WHAT DR. ITURRALDE CALLS MEGALITHICSTRUCTURES DO YOU HAVE BETTER ESTIMATES ON WHAT THELENGTH, WIDTH AND HEIGHT OF THOSE RECTANGULARSTRUCTURES WOULD BE?According to our estimates, the sonar images are up to 150 to 200 meters (492to 656 feet) in length and maybe up to 50 to 100 meters (164 to 328 feet) inwidth. So they are very large structures.ABOUT HOW HIGH?Well, it's difficult to say because what we see is only above the sandy soil of theocean bottom. That could be up to 15 to 20 meters, but there could be extensivestructures below the loose sand, white sand on the ocean bottom.WHEN PAULINA WAS DESCRIBING ONE OF THE CROSSED OVALS ATLEAST ONE OF THE INVESTIGATORS THOUGHT MIGHT BE ON ONE OFTHOSE, WAS IT ON ONE OF THE MEGALITHIC STRUCTURES OR WASIT ON A SINGLE, SEPARATED STONE?It was on what we call the word 'megalith' is used to describe both the structuresand the individual stones that are part of the structures. The stones are also verylarge.WHAT'S THE SIZE OF THEM?They could be 10 to 15 feet high."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"BY ABOUT WHAT WIDTH?5 to 10 feet wide. We did not videotape many of these stones, so we have a fewsamples. But they are very large and some of them appear to be fitted that is,one on top of the other in a comfortable position.AND IN FITTINGS, WOULD IT LOOK SORT OF LIKE STONEHENGE KINDOF CONSTRUCTION OR?That's right. Not so long, but certainly more square, more rounded, moreperpendicular. As I say, the entire ocean bottom in that region is simply whitesand with a few outcroppings of blackened limestone. By the way, whenlimestone is blackened, it's because of contact with oxygen. So, that alsosuggests the area was once above sea water. These things (megalithic structures)just appear out of nowhere that look like granite. Because there is no granite onCuba. Cuba is a limestone similar to the Yucatan. It's mostly limestone, thewhole area is limestone.WHAT ABOUT THAT PYRAMIDAL SHAPE THAT WAS IN THE IMAGE OFPAULINA LOOKING AT THE COMPUTER MONITOR?That's a stone. It's one of the stones.AND IT DOES SEEM TO BE PYRAMIDAL SHAPED?Yes. Yeah, it has a shape that doesn't appear often in nature. It's not a shape onewould expect to see in nature.IN TERMS OF THE ROBOT YOU HAD HOPED YOU COULD GET DOWNTHERE WITH MAYBE ONE OF THE ADVANCED SPACE ROBOTS THATCOULD GO AND DRILL INTO SOME OF THESE STRUCTURES AND FINDOUT EXACTLY WHAT THEY ARE?We are discussing a proposal with National Geographic right now to do apreliminary survey using our own technology, but a more extensive survey thanwe've done before and on the basis of those findings, to decide whether to goforward or not. If we do go forward, of course, it would be with more advancedtechnology.ARE YOU NOW CLOSER FOR NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC TO HELP WITHSOME FUNDING AND EQUIPMENT HERE?They would like to send their own camera, their own person down, on our shipto validate what we've found and to get a little more information that wouldsupport a more strongly the hypothesis that there was a civilization there. Andthen they would, of course, take the next step which would be a more seriousfinancial and logistical effort.Then it's a matter of timing their people have to be ready, we have to be ready.We have to have all permits and approvals in place. The weather has to be right.The season has to be right. It's a complex scenario, you know?WOULD YOU THINK THE SPRING OR SUMMER OF 2004 MIGHT BE ANOPPORTUNE TIME?Yes, that sounds very possible.HAS THERE BEEN ANY OTHER DATA THAT HAS SUPPORTED THEPOSSIBLE HYPOTHESIS THAT THERE MIGHT BE METAL COATINGS ONSOME OF THE MEGALITHIC STRUCTURES?It's possible from our sonar images that there could be metal because the darkerthe image, the more dense the material. So we do have but again, this is onlyhypothetical and would need to be verified by visual probes, by an ROV andcameras and good lighting. The area is quite extensive, spread out over severalkilometers and really we've barely touched it in terms of video probes."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"IS IT TRUE THAT THE MEGALITHIC STRUCTURES COVER ABOUT 10SQUARE KILOMETERS?Could be more.THAT'S A BIG AREA.It is very extensive. We don't know the full extent of it because we haven'tanalyzed all of the data from the region. We have a great deal of side scan sonardata and this is just one area that we've done in-depth analysis.\"To be continued in Part 2.More Information:Andrew Collins, British researcher of the Caribbean and the Atlantis legend,hypothesizes in his 2000 book, Gateway to Atlantis, that Cuba was in fact partof the great lost continent that sank into the Atlantic at least 11,000 years ago,according to the famous Greek philosopher, Plato.Collins says, \"I also concluded that Plato's claim that Atlantis's destruction inone single night and day through earthquakes and floods was based oncatastrophe legends told to Phoenician and Carthaginian mariners by theindigenous peoples of the Bahamas and Caribbean. They were told to the firstSpanish explorers to reach the islands, and speak of a catastrophic eventinvolving a period of darkness, as well as an all-encompassing flood whichengulfed a former great land mass, leaving behind the thousands of islands andcays which today make up these same archipelagos.\"In my opinion,\" Collins says, \"these stories relate to a cosmic event whichoccurred at the end of the last ice age and involved the creation of 500,000elliptical craters in the eastern states of the United States.
