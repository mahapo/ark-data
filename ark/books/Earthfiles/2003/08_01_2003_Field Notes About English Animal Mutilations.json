David is retired, but spent hisprofessional life heading the non-destructive testing laboratory at British Aerospace after tenyears in the U. K. Air Force. David has taken a serious interest in researching the earthmysteries of crop formations and sheep, cattle and other animal mutilations in England whichfall into the category of high strangeness – sometimes associated with mysterious lights orbeams in the sky. David and Robert are familiar with my documentaries and books about theworldwide animal mutilation phenomenon and wanted to show me images of a mutilated3-month-old lamb discovered in May 2001. The lamb had an odd teardrop-shaped cut at thehip area of its left leg, similar to other such cuts on animal deaths I have investigated in NorthAmerica. Three-month-old lamb discovered dead and mutilated in May 2001,Beddgelert, North Wales, England. Photographed by David Schindler.Interview: David Cayton, retired from British Aerospace and now researching crop formations andunusual animal deaths in England, interviewed at his camp site in Calne, Wiltshire: “People often ask me, ‘Is there a particular location in the U. K. where the animal mutilationshappen? I think there are, a bit like UFO sightings, as though there are points of exits andentries. They seem to focus on an area in Shropshire, which is about 20 miles south ofShrewsbury southwest of Birmingham, England. There are three or four farms no more thanfour or five miles apart, some only two miles apart, where they seem to get repeatedmutilations. In some cases, animals have gone mysteriously missing in large numbers. The May 2001 lamb case happened about three miles from the village of Beddgalert, which isin Snowdonia part of Wales. The farmer has holiday accommodations as well as the farm. Aguy from London named David Schindler was there with his family on holiday. They werewalking through the field which was only 400 yards from the farm house one evening and hisdaughter said, ‘Oh, we’ve got a dead lamb here, Daddy.’ Fortunately, David was aware of thisproblem through UFO Magazine and your work, Linda. He recognized this rather interestinghole in the rear hip area of the left leg of the lamb. So, he got the children home and came backwith the camera and took some pictures. I went back some months later after he gave me negatives to make some prints. I went twice tothe farmer to appeal to retrieve the carcass because it was so interesting and he claimed thatthe predators had taken it away, the foxes or whatever, and I didn’t believe that. I think heburied it because he was bothered by it. My first thought was that it was a hip bone. The hole is much larger than the normal thing we"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"have seen in the U. K. and the shape is interesting because it is a teardrop, an uneven oval thatis wider than high and it has this beautiful smooth edging. There is also a clean area around theedges of the wool and tissue. There is no blood and it’s very smooth and it looks like a smoothcrater edge around the hole. Unfortunately, I wasn’t there to look in it or bring the carcassback and poke some optical device in the hole to see what was missing. It’s quite big, at least 4inches wide by 2 inches deep, and you’ve got the clean area around the edges of the hole thatmay be half an inch.

Oh, no, they don’t want to spend the money. The vets charge quite high fees and the animalwas already dead, so it’s a loss to him. I suppose they think there is no point in adding morecosts to the loss of the animal. He was very polite to me and I explained about Prof. TonyFreemont and we’re doing a serious investigation here and how anxious we were to get thatspecimen back in the laboratory. The farmer tried to say the fox did it or the otters in the river– he kept harping that it was a fox down there. But I took this further, thinking this was bone, and contacted a neurologist, Mr. Richardson,who lives in Manchester. Robert mailed him the photographs. We had some discussion and inthe end he said I need to see the images. I know they cut circular holes in human skulls forbrain surgery and I wanted to know what tooling they use in our medical technology tocompare with the tooling that has been used to cut the hole in the lamb. Mr. Richardson virtually said that the tool used to cut holes in human skulls is only like 15 millimeters and iscircular. They would never cut an oval or tear-shaped hole in a human skull or anywhere else.To cut something so large, they would have to use a 5 millimeter burr and do a series of holesand sort of join it up rather crudely. So basically he is saying he couldn’t do it. Now a professor of veterinarian pathology, Prof. Donald Kelly, retired, but still lectures atLiverpool University, responded to my advertisement in the Farmer’s Guardian that I placed in2002 and March 2003. He was intrigued from his professional point of view about what wasgoing on with the injuries that I described in the farming press.”March 14, 2003 Farmers Guardian Page 45 An Appeal for Assistance to all Farmers, Veterinary Surgeons, AnimalWelfare Officers, Gamekeepers & Estate Managers, etc. Any discovered animal fresh carcasses with specific unusual injuriessought by Manchester-based Professor of Pathology for researchpurpose. Injuries to look for: -Precise local removal of flesh, hide or skin tissue from around neck, leg orhead and jaw exposing clean bone.1."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"1-3 cm.

N.B. Animals do not always exhibit every injury. Other relevant signs are:Complete blood loss, sometimes lack, of decomposition, or predatordamage. All types of livestock can be affected, including wild animals; i.e. fox,badger, deer, birds, seals, dolphins, and domestic animals. If possible, photograph own carcass where found including close-uppictures. Keep carcass chilled or freeze if delay in my attendance.6. Please contact David Cayton ASAP, when a suitable sample isdiscovered. Autopsy results available to donor if required; allcalls in strict confidence.0161-483-4956 or 07899-941-291 Please cut out this ‘Appeal Notice’ for your notice board for futurereference.Information on past events would also be welcome.“The result was that he agreed to an interview and Robert Hulse came along and we took awhole load of photographs, including this Beddgalert lamb and some of your images from theUnited States on your Earthfiles website, as well. And he thought from looking at thesephotographs that the hole was not in bone. He thought it had missed the femur. That wouldmean if he is correct that this would be the flesh, just skin. But nevertheless, it would bedifficult to produce that shape in skin. Why is it so taught and smooth and not sagged, I don’tknow. But he didn’t have an answer to it and in fact, during the two hours that we were with him, hisline was very defensive, looking after his reputation, and he wanted to put on the handle ofnatural predation.” Field Notes from England To Be Continued.
