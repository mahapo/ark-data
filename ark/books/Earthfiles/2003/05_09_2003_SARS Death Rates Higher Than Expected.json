The epidemic is still most severe inChina where the rural provinces around Beijing are reporting a rapid increase inSARS cases.The global average death rate is now broken down by age groups:50% for patients 65 or older;15% for people 45 to 64;6% for patients 25 to 44;and below 1% for patients 24 or younger.For comparison, the death rate from influenza viruses is 2%.Further, a Lancet medical study based on data learned the past few monthsindicates that so far the SARS coronavirus samples collected from patients donot show mutation and are remarkably stable. This suggests something that Dr.Mark Jackwood at the University of Georgia said about coronaviruses being sospecies-specific that he doubted this new one had jumped from animal tohuman. See: Earthfiles 05-02-03. Dr. Jackwood said he thought it was morelikely the new SARS coronavirus has been in the human population in a morebenign form for a long time without being detected. Then it mutated to the morevirulent SARS already adapted in the human system to infect and spread in thehuman population.The Lancet study says the stability of the SARS coronavirus so far means that asuccessful vaccine might be developed. But it also means the virus is notmutating to a more benign form and SARS might persist as the first new anddangerous disease of the 21st Century.SARS Cases as of May 9, 2003 Reported by CDC andW.H.O."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" United StatesSuspected SARS pneumonia cases in the United States have climbed to 328 in38 states with 63 probable cases; no deaths.Alabama 1Arizona 1Arkansas 1California 64Colorado 11Connecticut 8Florida 18Georgia 7Hawaii 6Illinois 16Indiana 1Kansas 3Kentucky 4Maine 2Maryland 4Massachusetts 19Michigan 3Minnesota 10Mississippi 2Missouri 2Nevada 4New Hampshire 1New Jersey 4New Mexico 1New York 38North Carolina 8Ohio 13Oregon 1Pennsylvania 12Rhode Island 2South Carolina 2South Dakota 1Te x a s 7Utah 7Vermont 2Virginia 9Washington 24Wisconsin 9 Wo r l d w i d e :May 9, 2003 - Current World Total: 7053 Cases, 34 countries, and 506 DeathsAustralia 4Brazil 2Bulgaria 1Canada 146 cases, 22 deaths China 4698 cases, 224 deaths China, Hong Kong 1661 cases, 208 deathsChina, Macao 1China, Taiwan, 131 cases, 13 deathsColombia 1Finland 1France, 6 Germany 8"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"India 1Indonesia 2Italy 9Japan 2Korea 1Kuwait 1Malaysia 7 cases, 2 deathsMongolia 9New Zealand 1Philippines 10 cases, 2 deathPoland 1Ireland 1Romania 1Singapore 204 cases, 27 deathsSouth Africa 1, 1 deathSpain 1Sweden 3Switzerland, 1Thailand 7 cases, 2 deathsUnited Kingdom 6United States 63 probable; 328 suspectViet Nam 63 cases, 5 deathsMore Information:CDC Recommendations for Travelers:Wash hands frequently and use alcohol-based rubs.Avoid crowds.Wear surgical mask #95 if in close contact with people who haverespiratory symptoms such as coughing or shortness of breath.Avoid sharing eating utensils, towels and bedding.Do not touch toilets and sinks that have been soiled by body fluids.When you return from an infected area, for 10 days SARS symptoms couldemerge.SARS Symptoms:Fever above 101.4 degrees F. that \"feels like the thermostat in too high andI can't escape.\"Painful, achy body.Nausea, possibly diarrhea.Dry cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing.We b s it e s :http://www.who.int/en/ (World Health Organization)http://www.cdc.gov/ (Centers for Disease Control)http://www.bcgsc.ca/bioinfo/SARS/ (BCGenome Sciences Centre)Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expressly"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"prohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
