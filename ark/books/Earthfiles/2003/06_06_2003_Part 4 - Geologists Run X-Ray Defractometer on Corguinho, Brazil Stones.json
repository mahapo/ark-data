Right: Stone 1, in profile to show disk-shape. Stone 1 is 16mm in diameterand weighs3.2051 grams. Stone 2, before being broken in two, was also 16mm in diameter andweighed 3.3068 grams.Both Stone 1 and Stone 2 were collected by Brazil businessman, Felipe Branco, onSeptember 15,2002 after the \"rain of rocks\" on the Urandir Oliveira farm in Corguinho, Brazil.Photograph © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe.Melted rock sample from shallow crater on Corguinho,Brazil hilltop discovered in October 2000 by local residents who saw a light come downout of the sky toward the hill and rise up again.

Levengood'sobservations about the titanium and magnetic quality of the Corguinho, Brazilstones were reinforced by the x-ray diffractometry (XRD) work done May 22-23at the University of Pennsylvania. Prof. Johnson, whose field is soil analysis, hadselected nine objects from my rock trays and collection bags. I also gave himtwo halves of Stone 2 that Phyllis Budinger had split open. During the first XRDrun, he was joined by Prof. Gomaa Omar, an eminent rock expert, and another"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"geologist who specializes in rare earth isotopes. First up was one half of Stone 2,which they called the \"button\" on the XRD analysis shown below.Second was a piece of the melted rock that local Corguinho eyewitnesses foundin October 2000 after a light came down to the top of a hill and took off again.That rock was arbitrarily labeled \"lightening strike\" because Dr. Omar said veryhigh temperature had to have been involved.Melted Rock BackgroundLinda Moulton Howe standing at the crater of melted rock on February 14, 2003,on the hilltop that local eyewitnesses said in October 2000 a light came down from the skyand went back up again.

It's Peak List arrangedby quantity starts with Quartz, Goethite, Hematite, Rutile (which containstitanium), Albite and Cubanite. That last name on the Peak List, is Cubanite(CuFe2S3 and I apologize my software won't make subscripts of the numbers), acopper-iron sulphide mineral that occurs in copper-zinc deposits and is namedafter its first discovery in Cuba. Prof. Johnson told me he had never heard ofCubanite before and it was not familiar to the geology group running the XRD.In an article entitled, Canadian Rockhound Geological Magazine atcanadianrockhound.com, David Joyce and Dirk Schmid wrote, \"The mineral(Cubanite) is rare and can be differentiated from chalcopyrite on the basis ofmagnetism, which is strong in Cubanite. As a crystal, Cubanite forms a6-pointed star with the points radiating from a common center.\"Cubanite, CuFe2S3, crystal from the Thompson Minein Thompson, Manitoba, Canada, a large nickel mine.Another form of Cubanite, Pyrrhotite, Dolmite (CuFe2S3) was found in Brazil"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"at the Morro Velho mine, Nova Lima, Minas Gerais, Southeast Region, which isthe opposite from Corguinho in the state of Mato Grosso do Sul in north centralBrazil.Cubanite, Pyrrhotite, Dolomite (CuFe2S3) crystalsfound in the Morro Velho mine, Nova Lima, Minas Gerais,Southeast Region, Brazil.

But it is rutile on the XRD Peak List that contains the titanium, notilmenite.The geologists are intrigued by current data from both samples and now rareearth isotope and other studies are ongoing.
