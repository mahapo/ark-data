If we look at the scientific evidence of what we know aboutcoronaviruses, I could also make the argument that under the rightconditions, under the right incubation conditions, that it couldhappen. The mechanism is there.But boy! It's like a trillion to one shot.\"- Mark Jackwood, Ph.D., Avian Coronaviruses, University of Georgia,Athens April 25, 2003 Athens, Georgia - Professor Mark Jackwood, Ph.D., studiesbird coronaviruses in the College of Veterinary Medicine at the University ofGeorgia in Athens. One puzzle that he and his colleagues helped solve was whychickens vaccinated for a deadly avian infectious bronchitis known as DE072(72nd virus isolate in Delaware) were still getting sick and dying. Dr. Jackwoodand Professor Chang Wong Lee studied the birds' blood and discovered adifferent coronavirus they named \"Georgia 98.\" 1998 was the year of thediscovery. What caused the mutation from DE072 to GA98? The coronavirus'sresponse to vaccinations.\"Our speculation was that one of the pathogenic field viruses, DE072, had tomutate over time to create a strain (GA98) that had a selective advantage thatcould cause disease in the face of the vaccine we were using at the time. ThoseGA98 viruses are quite unique and not related to any of the other infectiousbronchitis diseases that we know about, so we started doing some of thecalculations on the evolutionary aspect of that virus and how it would havecreated a new serotype and wrote our conclusions for a 2001 virus journalentitled, Origin and Evolution of Georgia 98 (GA98), A New Serotype ofAvian Infectious Bronchitis Virus. [Vi r u s R e s 2001 Nov 28;80(1-2):33-9]Dr. Jackwood says that coronaviruses are known to keep mutating over and overagain, explained why, and doubts that the SARS disease came from animals.Interview:Mark Jackwood, Ph.D., Professor, Department of Avian Medicine, Collegeof Veterinary Medicine, Univ. of Georgia, Athens, Georgia:Coronaviruses Are RNA WhichCannot Correct Sequence Mistakes\"One reason (for mutations) is vaccine pressure. They have the ability to changebecause they are RNA viruses. This RNA virus has a polymerase that makesmore copies of the virus that can't change its mistakes, has no proofreadingability. So that's one way it can mutate.IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY WAY TO CORRECT ITSELF WHEN IT MAKES A"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"MISTAKE?Right. That polymerase, when it replicates a new virus particle, if it makes amistake in the genetic code, it can't go back and fix it.LET'S GO TO THIS NEW SARS CORONAVIRUS AND THE DISCUSSIONTHAT I HAD RECENTLY WITH DAVID HEYMANN AT THE WORLDHEALTH ORGANIZATION (W.H.O.) IN GENEVA. WHICH ANIMAL WASHOLDING THIS NEWLY MUTATED CORONAVIRUS? WHERE IS THATANIMAL? WHY DID THIS NEW SARS CORONAVIRUS HAVE THEABILITY TO JUMP FROM THE UNKNOWN ANIMAL INTO HUMANSWITH THE ABILITY TO SPREAD HUMAN TO HUMAN?First of all. I'm not convinced that this SARS coronavirus came from an animal.And let me tell you why. When you look at the genetic sequence of the SARSvirus, it's about 50% give or take 5% or so, related to all the other coronavirusesthat we know about. But I can take any animal coronavirus and show that kindof relationship between it and any other coronavirus that we know about.IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'VE GOT CORONAVIRUSES THAT CAN CAUSE,FOR EXAMPLE, HEPATITIS IN A MOUSE AND YOU'VE GOT ACORONAVIRUS THAT CAN CAUSE A COLD IN HUMANS. YOU'RESAYING THIS NEW SARS CORONAVIRUS IS EQUALLY DISTANT FROMBOTH THE CORONAVIRUS THAT MAKES HUMANS SICK AND THECORONAVIRUSES THAT MAKE ANIMALS SICK?That's right. Let me give you a different example. We've got a coronavirus thatcauses hepatitis in mice. Now we have a coronavirus that causes upperrespiratory disease in birds. Genetically, in any given gene, I can show you 50%similarity between those two viruses. But that doesn't mean that the bird's viruscame from the mouse or that the mouse virus came from the bird. Coronaviruses Are Extremely Species-SpecificHaving said that, what we know about coronaviruses is they are extremelyspecies-specific. Extremely species specific! So, if you take a mouse virus andput it into a bird, it does absolutely nothing. If you take the bird virus, theinfectious bronchitis virus that I work with, and put it in a human, it doesn't doanything. I've done it accidentally to myself. That characteristic of coronavirusesleads me to believe that this SARS virus probably did not come directly from ananimal.I'm not saying it couldn't happen under the right conditions, under the rightincubator, if you will. But, what I know about this coronavirus and othercoronaviruses like it, I would be very surprised if it made a direct jump from ananimal to a person.WHY IS IT THAT WHO AND CDC AND EVERYBODY ELSE SEEMS TO BEOF A CONSENSUS THAT THIS CAME FROM AN ANIMAL TO HUMAN?I'm not sure. Perhaps because the influenza virus does this (Spanish Flupandemic of 1918 jumped from swine to humans) and they are assuming that acoronavirus could jump from an animal, too. There is some scientific evidencethat coronaviruses can cross species. We have a lot of evidence thatcoronaviruses can mutate and we know how they do it. They can do it by what Itold you, the mutations, and they can do it by recombination events, byinsertions or deletions.BUT DOESN'T THIS CONTRADICT WHAT YOU WERE SAYING WITHSOME EMOTION THAT CORONAVIRUSES ARE SPECIES-SPECIFIC?In a way, it does. And I guess that's what I'm trying to let you know is we don'tknow for sure. If I look at the past history of the way coronaviruses behave, thenI have to come to a logical conclusion that they are very species-specific and a"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"coronavirus doesn't just jump from an animal to a person. If we look at thescientific evidence of what we know about coronaviruses, I could also make theargument that under the right conditions, under the right incubation conditions,that it could happen. The mechanism is there. But boy! It's like a trillion to oneshot.SO, WHAT IN THE WORLD HAS HAPPENED IN GUANGDONGPROVINCE, CHINA, THAT SET IN MOTION A BRAND NEWCORONAVIRUS WHICH, ACCORDING TO VIROLOGIST ALBERTOSTERHAUS, IS NOW IN ITS OWN FOURTH CATEGORY AS A UNIQUECORONAVIRUS?I know. Let me tell you a little bit about our research and what we found withbirds. We developed a diagnostic test here at the Univ. of Georgia that allows usto detect very rapidly the coronavirus that I work with in birds, the avianinfectious bronchitis virus, and to also determine what type virus that is. Wehave a whole bunch of serotypes of that virus. Within one day, we can type awhole bunch of different viruses from the field. New Diagnostic Tests Revealed Dozensof Avian Coronaviruses Never Seen Before\"It was like turning a light on in a room.\"When we first started doing that test back in 1993, we found all kind ofcoronaviruses in birds that we never knew about, of the infectious bronchitisvirus. They were circulating in perfectly healthy birds and we never knew theywere there because we didn't have the tools to be able to see them.THE BIRDS WEREN'T SICK?No, the birds were not sick. We got vaccines we use for infectious bronchitis thatwe give birds and that doesn't make them sick. So, we were surprised that therewere other coronaviruses floating around out there in the field that wereinfecting birds and not making them sick. They exist.BY 1993 YOU FINALLY HAD SOME TECHNOLOGY THAT YOU CAN SEEAND SEPARATE OUT CORONAVIRUSES THAT YOU DIDN'T EVENKNOW EXISTED?Right, it was like turning a light on in a room. We could now see what was therewhereas before, we couldn't. So, we're assuming these are all new viruses andeverybody is panicking and thinking all their birds are going to get sick. Thereality is that ten years later, those viruses are still out there circulating around.We still find them from time to time and they aren't doing a darn thing.Now here is the big point of the story, I guess. If those viruses are there in thepopulation and in the birds and they are circulating through those birds, they dohave a potential to change and cause disease.How do we know that in China those viruses weren't circulating around inpeople already? We don't know if they are there. There are no tools to look forthem. The virus just happened to mutate and caused some people to get sick andsome people to die.SO WHAT YOU ARE SUGGESTING IS NOT THAT THE CORONAVIRUS INTHE BIRDS OR ANOTHER ANIMAL JUMPED TO PEOPLE, BUT THATCORONAVIRUSES COULD HAVE BEEN CARRIED BY PEOPLE LIKE THECOMMON COLD AND THEN SUDDENLY, SOMETHING CAUSED THATMUTATION, THE RNA MADE A MISTAKE, AND IT WENT FROM JUST ABENIGN COLD TO SOMETHING THAT CAN KILL PEOPLE?Yes, that's very possible. I find that a much more plausible story to swallow thanI do that it jumped from a bird to a person. Or any animal. Mouse, bovine and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"chicken are the three coronaviruses that the (genetic) sequences of the SARSvirus are most close to. But 50% is not close.It's (SARS virus) still not very similar to any of them (mouse, bovine andchicken coronaviruses). It falls into its own new coronavirus group.But it makes me very uncomfortable when people talk about a coronavirusjumping species like that. It just doesn't happen in nature, and if it does, it's anextremely, extremely rare event. To my knowledge, it's never been documentedin nature.In my mind, a more plausible explanation for where it came from is that it wasthere all the time. We just never looked for it. We didn't have the tools to see it.And now that it's changed and causing disease, now we're obviously looking forthe cause of what this disease is. We come up with the SARS coronavirus that isunlike anything we've ever seen before. But there aren't that many humancoronaviruses we've ever looked at. Two Common Human CoronavirusesWHAT ARE THEY? IS THE COMMON COLD THE ONLY CORONAVIRUSTHAT WE REALLY KNOW ABOUT?There are two human coronaviruses that we know about. One is in Group 1 andone is in Group 2. One is respiratory and the other gastric.SO ONE CAUSES A COLD AND THE OTHER CAUSES SOMETHING LIKEVOMITING AND DIARRHEA?Diarrhea, yes. But those isolates have been around for a long time. They've beenfully sequenced and we've known about them for quite awhile.HOW CLOSE IS THE NEW SARS CORONAVIRUS TO EITHER OF THOSEGROUPS?It's not as close as it is to bovine, chicken or mouse.BUT DON'T YOU THINK THAT SOME OF THE MEDICAL PEOPLE ARECONCLUDING SARS IS A JUMP FROM ANIMALS TO HUMANSBECAUSE THERE IS A CLOSER GENETIC ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THENEW SARS CORONAVIRUS AND THE MOUSE HEPATITIS, THE BOVINECORONAVIRUS AND THE AVIAN INFECTIOUS BRONCHITIS?Maybe. But again, what percentage is that? Somewhere around 57%. Havingworked with coronaviruses for the last fifteen years, 50 some percent is notsimilar at all. In my mind, two coronaviruses that are merely 50% similar arecompletely different viruses. Is SARS A Mutation of A Human Coronavirus?SO YOU WOULD GUESS THAT EVEN THOUGH WE KNEW AND HADSEQUENCED TWO CORONAVIRUSES IN HUMANS - ONE CAUSINGRESPIRATORY PROBLEMS AND THE OTHER CAUSING DIARRHEA -THAT THERE ARE OTHER CORONAVIRUSES THAT HAVE BEENCIRCULATING AROUND IN THE HUMAN POPULATION UNIDENTIFIEDJUST AS YOU HAVE SEEN IN BIRD POPULATIONS?That's my speculation, yes.AND THAT SOMETHING MUTATED IN THE RNA THAT TOOK ANOTHERWISE UNIDENTIFIED CORONAVIRUSES THAT WERE BENIGN(ALREADY CIRCULATING IN HUMAN SYSTEMS) AND MADE ITLETHAL?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yes, and the reason I say that is because of our experience with what we knowhappens in chickens. That's what happens in chickens with the virus I work with.THE NEXT QUESTION ON EVERYBODY'S MIND: THIS COULD BE ONTHE VERGE OF A GLOBAL PANDEMIC BECAUSE THE HUMANPOPULATION DOES NOT HAVE ANY IMMUNITY TO THIS NEWCORONAVIRUS. IF SARS HAS MUTATED ONCE INSIDE OF HUMANSAND HAS BECOME MORE LETHAL, COULD IT MUTATE AGAIN ANDBECOME EITHER MORE LETHAL OR LESS LETHAL?Yes. It's going to continue to change as long as it is circulating in the humanpopulation. That's the nature of coronaviruses.But let me make this point: in your life time, how many times has a coronavirusmutated like this and caused disease?NOT IN MY LIFE TIME.There you go. So you think it's a fairly common event? Like flu? No.Coronaviruses don't typically do this. This is not their mode of operation.HOW DANGEROUS IS SARS?It's dangerous! No doubt about it. It's changed and it's killing people and weneed to treat it as the experts at CDC and WHO those are the guys who knowhow to deal with these kinds of things and I have faith in their ability.WHICH IS ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE BECAUSE WE HAVE NOMEDICINES THAT CAN DO ANYTHING.We don't have any medicines that can do anything right now. They are workingon diagnostic tests and I think they've got something in line that hopefully willhelp them a lot.\" SARS Cases as of April 24, 2003 Reported by CDC andW.H.O.
