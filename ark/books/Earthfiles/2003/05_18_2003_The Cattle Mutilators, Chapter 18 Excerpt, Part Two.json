Dalton (pseudonym)Manor Books, Inc., New York, New York(out of business since 1988.) The creature's eyes blinked slowly, his grotesque face wrinkled in thought,pondering a comprehensive answer. The diaphragm mouth began to oscillate,emitting the bone-chilling sounds of an idiot; then came the mentalcommunication: \"We are the Meues. We occupy all space.\" \"No, I mean which planet or solar system are you from?\" Brandon asked. \"Everywhere.\" The being held up his long index finger in a manner that urgedBrandon to listen. \"You see, earthlings, or humans, as you refer to yourselves,live only in the time and dimension that your limited knowledge affords you.You are so preoccupied with finding life in your own galaxy that you overlookthe obvious.\" \"Are you saying you are from here, earth?\" Brandon asked, not understanding. \"Everywhere in the universe or any void in between. We are from a differentdimension, a different plane of existence. We have no boundaries or limits, asyou have. We are an anti-log of everything you see visually. We can travel in anydimension and occupy the same area as say, earth, but not the same time orspace without being observed. The possibilities of existence are infinite.\" TheMeue clasped his hands, his forefingers twisting around one another. \"In other words, we could both be in the same spot and neither of us would beaware of the other?\" Brandon said. \"That's correct. Now you are within our dimension. Since you have boarded,we've moved back into our dimension. Neither the lab or yourself is any longervisible to humans, but we are still here.\" \"Can you be what we call ghosts - something that can be there, but we can't seeyou?\" Brandon's eyebrow raised quizzically. \"Ghosts?\" The Meue's eyes closed slowly. Brandon thought they would neveropen. \"No. Ghosts, as you call them, are a different matter. When the human"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"body ceases to function in your dimension, the entity is given the choice ofanother dimension to continue in. For reasons we cannot fully understand, theemotional electron patterns found only in the human race cling to your plane,becoming locked between the two. It cannot be freed without destroying theentity.\" \"Wait a minute!\" Brandon interrupted. \"Are you saying you're God? That youhave the power of life and death? The determination of what happens afterdeath?\" \"God? Doctor, I would have believed a man of your scientific knowledge wouldhave guessed the truth. God is nothing more than a human word to give faith tothe weak. You know as a scientist that matter never dies, it changes form.Therefore, there is no beginning or end, no life or death. It's simply a matter ofchanging form.\" The creature's neck swooped down in an arch, bringing his faceclose to Brandon's Jerry felt sick. \"Do you understand?\" the being asked, itshead lolling from side to side. \"No!\" Brandon shouted. \"If that's the case, who created life on earth?\" \"Matter never dies, remember. It changes form. Earth was designed andconstructed by the Meues billions of your years ago, as an experimental colony.We chose your dimension because it had a number of planets and stars alreadyinhabited. We allowed them to transplant thirty males and thirty females of theirspecies from the mother planet. I'm sure you are aware they return periodicallyto check on their contribution to the experiment. No one is allowed to interfereor alter what takes place. Some of the human forms have not survived. Evenyou, Doctor, generations away from the original implant, will be awarded thechoice of another dimension when you cease to function in the colony.\" \"This is the most ridiculous thing I ever heard. Are you trying to tell me I'm somekind of guinea pig? Bullshit! I can't believe it.\" Brandon was terrified by what he had heard. If the Meue was right, the veryquality of life and death, heaven and hell, morality meant nothing. \"But you have a choice. That's the point of the experiment. We cannot interfereto change the outcome. The experiment would be invalid. And ponder this, Dr.Brandon: I know you're well versed in the science called genetics. Where did theman with the slanted eyes come from, or the black man, or the brown or red orwhite, or the almond-eyed humans? Can you honestly believe all these geneticdeviations came from the Adam and Eve myth? The Meue's neck retracted, then extended straight up from his shoulders. Thelong neck of the creature gave the Meue the advantage of looking down atBrandon. Its dull red eyes fixed on Jerry's frightened face. \"No, this can't be true.\" Brandon felt panicky. He touched his feverish forehead.Beads of sweat trickled from his hairline onto his fingers. \"It just can't be true.To live a life that has been predetermined and designed by people like yourselfis not worth living. We're not laboratory animals.\" \"Is it any different that we designed the Earth, and regulated the living forms thatexist on it, as opposed to this God that humans wish to believe in? Does it"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"matter who controls it or for what reason? The only important thing is that youenjoy it and try to make it a more habitable place for future generations. You areliving in a small cultural microcosm with inhabitants from vast spaces in theuniverse. Look at the different cultures, temperaments, levels of tolerance andaggressiveness you are exposed to. Look how some of the races have advancedand others remain primitive. Look ...\"\"That's part of the problem of believing you,\" Brandon interrupted, visiblytroubled. \"If we are transplants from advanced civilizations, why aren't we moreadvanced? Why aren't we traveling in space?\" \"A very good question. Because transplants to the colony were not allowed anyprevious knowledge, only the ability to learn, and the basic drive for survival. Inthis way, each culture was allowed to develop at its own pace. I'm afraid from anintelligence standpoint, the human race is a bitter failure, stupid beyondcomprehension, and ...\" \"Just a damn minute. We've had some great men in our history,\" Brandoninterjected. \"By whose standards? And who were these great men?\" \"What about Edison or Einstein? What's your explanation for Jesus Christ?\" \"Child's play, all of it. They tried, but man abused them. Edison managed asmall knowledge of electricity, a basic principle. Man in his ignorance has allbut used up the resources for producing it. He has never looked into the future.This man Einstein was probably the closest the human race has ever come topure intelligence and logic. He, like Edison, was a first-generation transplant,but his mind was not dulled by the trivia of everyday problems. I guess by yourstandards, he was brilliant. By ours, he was a child. And then, of course, thehuman race took his small discoveries and instead of using them for improvingthe colony, they tried to annihilate one another.\" \"And what about Jesus Christ, the son of God?\" Brandon felt humbly frustrated.Surely the being had to know Christ. \"Yes, and then there was Jesus Christ.\" The Meue's hands unfolded. He calmlyplaced them on the arms of his chair. His voice of mind projection neverwavered. It was always clear and emotionless. Brandon alertly watched thehideous face for some sign of distaste or happiness, but while the face collapsedand expanded with breathing and word formation, it always remainedexpressionless. \"This man, Jesus, was a good man and an intelligent philosopher, but he was notthe son of any God. He, too, was a first-generation implant, endowed with manyof the metaphysical abilities that were commonplace on his mother planet. Hetried to bring some order to the colony earth, but we both know what happenedto him. There were three others that followed him at different intervals, but theytoo were assassinated. Since the last, the mother planet has ceased to exist.There will be no more of their species. Under these men, there was hope forearth, but now it's doubtful. The experimental colony earth has turned into aviolent tribe of chaos and hate. All peaceful and intellectual things have beenlaid aside and replaced by the power syndrome. The very thing we feared wouldhappen at the beginning of the experiment.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" \"But why all this? Why an experimental colony with people from otherplanets?\" \"In the next millennium, some of the planets will cease to function. Colonyearth was a small-scale model of a super-planned planet. One where all entitiescould exist in harmony. It was an idealist plan that I myself had hoped for, but itis no longer plausible.\" \"You don't know that. It can still work. Sure we have wars and diseases. We killone another, but you forget we're human. Genetically we've changed drasticallyfrom the original hybrids that were placed here. You can't possibly predict whatthe human race will do.\" \"And that's why I wanted to meet you, Dr. Brandon. You not only have areasonable amount of scientific intelligence, you are something of an idealist,like myself and the others that had a hand in the earth experiment. A rareattribute in the human race.\" His head lolled back and forth approvingly. \"Whydid you concern yourself with the few human forms we needed for ourexperiments?\" \"You can't butcher people like animals.\" \"Earth is an experiment, remember? You conduct experiments in your labs. Whyshouldn't we do it in ours?\" The Meue's grotesque face seemed to smile. \"Because we have the powers of reason. Our actions don't stem from pure logic,as do yours. Everything we do is tempered by feelings and emotions. Can't youunderstand that?\" After a log period of silence, the Meue's head nodded awkwardly. \"Yes, I knowvaguely of this emotion syndrome. Some of the early transplants manifested thestrange parameter. Why is it so important to the human race?\" \"Because it's a driving force that makes every day different. Emotion is lovingyour family, having friends, laughing and crying, caring about each other. Wehaven't evolved to your status where pure logic controls our existence, and I'mnot sure we want to.\" \"Emotion also promotes killings. This is not logical.\" \"Yes, but we're learning and evolving. We have the right to be left alone andwork our way through the trials of evolution.\" \"You have no rights.\" The Meue's long neck swooped down, his face confrontingBrandon's. \"Let me ask you a question.\" Brandon nodded. \"You humans use rats and dogs in many of your lab experiments, don't you?\" Brandon said, \"Yes, generally. Sometimes other animals.\" \"Let's assume you put five rats in a small area to observe their interaction over aperiod of time. Then they began fighting, overproducing, killing. The greater the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"population increased, the worse the savagery until there exists constantdisharmony and death. Would you let the experiment go on or end it?\" \"I would have to terminate it at some point. But ...\" \"Exactly.\" The Meue's neck straightened. \"It is our responsibility to terminatethe experiment when we feel earth has reached the final point. That point seemsto be very near.\" Continued in - The Cattle Mutilators, Chapter 18, Part Three.
