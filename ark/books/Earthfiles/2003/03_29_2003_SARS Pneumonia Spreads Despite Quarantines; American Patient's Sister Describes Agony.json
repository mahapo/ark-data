Singapore officials are warning this is the worsthealth crisis in years and doubled the number of people under quarantine there.In Singapore now, at least 1500 people are confined to their homes for the nextten days. In Hong Kong, 1000 people are quarantined and more than 700 inToronto.Globally, the World Health Organization lists 1,485 Cases and 53 Deaths. In theUnited States, CDC is monitoring 60 patients with the symptoms of the still-unidentified SARS disease (microbe candidates are in the families of theParamyxo and Corona viruses, as reported in earlier Earthfiles reports).One of those American patient's has been hospitalized in a southeastern statesince mid-February. The patient's sister has been following my news reportsabout the SARS illness in my Earthfiles reports. She contacted me because shefeels strongly that people need to know the disease is here in the United Statesand is truly life threatening as she has seen in her sister and her mother, whoapparently also contracted pneumonia within five days of visiting her sickdaughter in the hospital.The patient's sister works as a chemical lab and medical lab technician and hasrequested anonymity to protect her family's privacy. She has watched herpreviously healthy and active sister go suddenly into hospital isolation, unableto breath on her own, suffering a heart attack after fluid poured through holes inher lungs, and is now bone thin. The sister says even if American doctors andhospitals are not yet speaking up about the cases they are coping with, thepublic has to take the symptoms and the potential severity of the SARSpneumonia seriously.Interview:Sister (Mid-Western home) of Assumed SARS Patient in Major MedicalCenter of Southeastern U. S. : \"It started out with flu-like symptoms and forsay four or five days she was sick in bed with what she thought was the flu.AND HOW OLD IS SHE?She's only 38.DID SHE TELL YOU WHAT HER TEMPERATURE WAS?No, I know it was over 101 or 102. In fact, I wasn't talking to her when she wasreal sick because she was too sick to talk on the phone."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"WHAT MADE HER SO SICK BEYOND THE FEVER?Cramping, aching body, nausea, diarrhea, vomiting. Not as much vomitingbecause she really was not able to eat much. But she's a health nut. She's avegetarian, she bicycles miles every day, a non-smoker.REALLY HEALTHY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN SO SICK SHE CANNOT GETOUT OF BED.She could not get out of bed.AND HOW LONG DID THIS PART GO?Well, for about 5 days she laid trying to work it through like a flu normally runsits course. Two days later, she couldn't breath or walk.WHO DOES SHE LIVE WITH?She has a husband and baby.THIS WAS THEN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION?Yes, she was in such bad shape they took her straight to the emergency room.When she got to the emergency room, they did blood gases on her and she hadmore carbon dioxide than oxygen in her blood. She was already in respiratoryacidosis.WHY?Because there was no exchange of oxygen in her lungs. This kind of pneumoniaattacks the alveoli that do the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.AT THAT POINT, WHAT DATE WOULD THAT HAVE BEEN THAT SHEWAS ADMITTED INTO THE EMERGENCY ROOM?The 25th of February, 2003.ON THAT DAY, DID ANYBODY IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM SAY TOYOU OR TO YOUR FAMILY THIS IS A CASE OF THE SARS PNEUMONIA?At that time, it had not broken out in the news. It really did not come out in thenews until I was visiting her and I was down there to see her in the hospital andthe first day we were there, we saw it on the news. That was when it finallycame out publicly.IF SHE IS ADMITTED AT THE END OF FEBRUARY, THE FIRST STORIESON THE SARS PNEUMONIA BROKE IN EARLY MARCH. SO WHEN THEYADMITTED HER, WHAT DID THEY TELL YOU OR THE FAMILY THEYTHOUGHT WAS THE PROBLEM?They did a CATSCAN and a chest x-ray of her lungs and it was total masses.Her lungs were just in masses of what they first thought could be canceroustumors or massive TB. And they said if it was pneumonia, it was the worst casethey had ever seen. This is a major medical center.They put her in a negative pressure room with isolation. The negative pressure isso that whatever germ does not get out into the rest of the hospital. It is filteredthrough heavy duty filters before it goes into the ventilation system.RIGHT, AND ALL THE AIR COMES INTO THE ROOM INSTEAD OF OUT.Correct. And everyone had to wear the masks and the gowns.WHEN YOU WENT TO VISIT HER, YOU WERE GOWNED ANDMASKED?No. I don't understand that. I don't know if at that point, they didn't realize whatthey were dealing with, how contagious it is, but we were not required to wear"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"masks, rubber gloves or anything. They had the hand wash stations outside eachroom and inside the room and we were required to wash our hands entering andleaving.AND YET IT WAS A NEGATIVE FLOW ROOM?When I got there, they didn't have the pressure reversed by then. It was in theearly stages when she got there for about a week. They had her in the negativeflow room immediately up to about a week and then they discontinued that.WHY?I have no idea. And I have no idea why greater precautions weren't taken withpeople coming to visit.YES, ESPECIALLY IF SHE WERE IN A NEGATIVE FLOW ROOM ANDYOU AND YOUR MOTHER AND OTHERS WERE STILL ALLOWED TOGO INTO THE ROOM WITHOUT BEING MASKED OR GOWNED.Right. I don't understand that. At that point and still to this day, they do notknow what caused it. They could not isolate a certain bacteria or a certain virusand they could not tell me if it was viral or bacterial and they still can't tell me.THEN WHEN WAS THIS CASE, AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED,OFFICIALLY CATEGORIZED BY CDC IN THE STATE IN WHICH YOURSISTER IS STILL HOSPITALIZED AS THE SARS PNEUMONIA?Actually, they will not tell her or us that's what she has and they will not say itis not what she has. They won't deny or confirm.BUT THEY HAVE HER LISTED IN THE NUMBER OF STATES AND CASESBY CDC?Yes. But they will not inform her or the family that that is indeed what it is. Ithink it's because there is not a confirmatory test for it yet. It's just a set ofsymptoms right now until they can identify what the cause if it's viral and whatkind of virus and establish a test.YOU AND I ARE TALKING ON MARCH 28. THAT MEANS YOUR SISTERHAS BEEN HOSPITALIZED FOR A MONTH.Correct, and she has three more weeks to go.THREE MORE WEEKS?Yes, she has just had a surgery where half of her left lung had to be removedbecause this pneumonia eats through your lungs. What they kind of nicknamedit to us was, 'atypical necrotic pneumonia.'AND NECROTIC MEANS?Killing, killing the flesh, dead flesh.E AT IN G AWAY T IS S U E .Right.CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE MORE DETAIL ABOUT THIS SURGERYAND WITH HER BEING AS SICK AS SHE IS, WHY DID THE DOCTORSDECIDE THEY HAD TO OPERATE?They were initially going to go in to remove dead tissue and repair a hole in herleft lung. Her right lung has several small holes, but her left lung had a gapinghole that was not going to close on its own. They are confident that the holes inthe right lung will close on their own.So, they went in to remove the dead tissue and close the hole and when they gotthe scope in there, they realized the whole upper lobe was just dead, decayed"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"tissue. So she is still not aware of this. She has been heavily sedated since thenand this was four days ago.WAS THERE ANYTHING IN YOUR SISTER'S PROFESSION OR LIFE THATHAD HER IN CONTACT WITH ANYBODY FROM CHINA, SINGAPORE,VIETNAM OR ANY PLACE IN ASIA?This place where she lives and works is a heavily traveled place and people areflying in and out from other countries all the time. She's a very sociable personand her job is in the public also. So it could have been anyone. She could havemade contact and didn't know it. In fact, the doctors were asking her a couple ofdays before her surgery whether she had inhaled anything or sniffed anything orsmelled anything out of the ordinary that was suspicious. She told then no, notthat she was aware of.AGAIN, WE'RE AT THE MYSTERY OF HOW EXACTLY DOES THE SARSPNEUMONIA TRANSMIT ITSELF AROUND THE WORLD BECAUSE INSOME CASES IT IS SUGGESTING THAT IT MIGHT EVEN BE AIRBORNE.I believe that it could have been a sneeze or cough. I don't think it would havebeen a ventilation system, or there would have been more people than just her.DID THE DOCTORS TELL YOU THAT THEY HAD SEEN OTHER CASESOF THIS NECROTIZING LUNG DISEASE?They said they had never seen it before. And they said many times that it is theworst pneumonia they had ever seen, they had never seen anything like it.IT WOULD ALSO EXPLAIN WHY TEN PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE INHONG KONG AND CHINA HAVE HAD TO GO ON VENTILATORS.Correct. My sister was on a ventilator for almost three weeks.WHEN YOU ASK THE DOCTORS TODAY ABOUT THE SARSPNEUMONIA WHICH IS IN HEADLINES EVERYWHERE, WHAT DO THEYSAY?I haven't asked them in the past week. It was about four or five days that sheasked them last and they are still saying we are not sure, we don't know,probably not, maybe not, we cannot get a straight yes or no.BUT THIS HAS ALL THE EARMARKS.Everything. After the respiratory acidosis and she was put on a ventilator, theytold us she had adult respiratory distress syndrome. It followed exactly what thesymptoms are of SARS.\"More Information:On March 9, 2003, on the Sunday before the sister in this interview and hermother first visited on Wednesday, March 12, both traveling from other states -the pneumonia had eaten through the patient's lungs and caused fluid to fill herchest cavity. The pressure from the fluid collapsed her right lung and caused herheart to stop because it could not beat properly. Doctors had to give the patientCPR and an adrenalin shot into her heart to get it started again.David Heymann, Executive Director of Communicable Diseases at the WorldHealth Organization (W.H.O.) in Geneva, Switzerland, recommends that anyperson who has a sudden fever above 100 degrees Fahrenheit accompanied bydifficulty breathing should go immediately to an emergency room. Patients whohave received good hospital support care, including ventilators, have survived. Infact, the mortality rate of the SARS pneumonia is running only about 3 to 5 %,but the potential severe lung damage in some of the cases demands expertmedical treatment and x-rays."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"We b s it e s :http://www.who.int/en/ (World Health Organization)http://www.cdc.gov/ (Centers for Disease Control)Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
