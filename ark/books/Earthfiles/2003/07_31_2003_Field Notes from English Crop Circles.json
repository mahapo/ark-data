July 31, 2003 Devizes, Wiltshire, England – I arrived in Wiltshire early Tuesdaymorning, July 29, 2003, after the Glastonbury Symposium and went directly toWoodborough Hill in Alton Barnes. The East Field, beneath Adam’s Grave andKnap Hill, is famous for receiving crop circles over the past decade and was stilluntouched by patterns. So was the spring barley across the road extending up to thebase of Woodborough Hill. I could hear a helicopter, then another, which begancircling over Woodborough and then on to the East Field, moved on to WestStowell and back around again. The helicopters were hovering, then lowering downtoward the fields and then rising back up again. I had seen these same maneuversback in August 2000 during one day that seven of us did a night watch at the EastField and watched through a night vision scope as an oval-shaped light jumpedfrom side to side and changed shape into a bright square. (See Earthfiles August2000.) I decided to drive over to the Woodborough church to park my car and walk thepath that would take me to Woodborough Hill. From the top, I would have clearviews in all directions to watch the helicopter activity and to see the two formationsthat had been discovered previously in wheat near farmer Tim Carson’s barns at thebase of the hill. One pattern was being called the “bear claw” and another nearbywas dubbed the “snake.” I drove to the church parking lot and could hearhelicopters in the distance. I walked into the open church to see its stained glasswindows. A few minutes later, I walked outside toward my car and was astonishedby the sudden loud roar of a helicopter. It was a solid black Apache bristling withall its gun ports and other technologies only about 300 feet above me. The helicopter turned tightly over my head as if observing me and I took photographs ofit with my 35mm camera. As the black helicopter flew away with a great roaringsound, I wondered why I, or anyone, would be subjected to such a threateningaerial machine at close range near a church. Soon after, it began to rain hard and oninto the night. In Glastonbury, I had heard another story about two Apache helicoptersmaneuvering near the Carson barns July 14th, the day the so-called “bear claw”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"was discovered. Andy Buckley, a computer graphic artist from Manchester, likes tonight watch from Woodborough Hill during the crop circle season in Wiltshire, dayor night. Beginning July 14th around 11 a.m. and ongoing until at least 1:30 p.m.,Andy watched and videotaped off and on two Apache helicopters. At one point hethought one of the Apaches descended toward the wheat behind the barn, followedby the release of what looked like steam or fog from beneath the helicopter. Andysaid the steam rose quickly in the air. He went to the field to get a closer look anddiscovered the formation was there. He was afraid to enter at first, not knowingwhat had happened or what possibly toxic substances could be in the air. Afternearly an hour, he finally walked into the wheat pattern and described it as “veryclean and crisp.” On Sunday, July 27, while many of us were attending the last day of theGlastonbury Symposium, a “snake” pattern was laid down in the same wheat fieldnear the Carson barns not far from the “bear claw.” Walking through that formationon Tuesday, July 29, the wheat plants were so lifeless and laid so flatly andmechanically that the likelihood is that pranksters were responsible. Last night, July 30, Andy Buckley, his friend Hazel, and I climbed to the top ofWoodborough Hill for a night watch, given all the helicopter activity. When redMars rose in the east as large as it’s been in about seventy thousand years (itsclosest approach will be August 27), we were viewing it through our variouscameras and binoculars. In my Sony digital video camera on Super Night Shot,there were two small, blue-white objects in the frame that were pulsing oddly outof sync with each other, almost as if in reaction to each other. None of usunderstood what the pulsing objects could be. There was no motion, only erraticpulsing. One object would pulse, then the other and so on, alternating for at leastfifteen minutes of steady camera viewing. After awhile, the pulsing objects in theframe with Mars disappeared. The Extraordinary North Down Formation The crop pattern I was most interested in seeing on the ground was the elevenconcentric rings of repeating patterns in barley discovered in line with four ancienttumuli behind Cherhill on July 6, 2003. See Earthfiles July report. Known as NorthDown, there is no easy way to get there. Yesterday, July 30th, researchers DavidCayton, Robert Hulse and I walked for about a half hour up hill and down toreach the field. There is one place where you can see the four ancient burialgrounds – more than 4,000 years old – in the foreground and the obelisk at the topof Cherhill Down in the background. In my earlier North Down report at Earthfiles,there is a map with a straight line along the tumuli which intersects Silbury Hill.Who were buried in the ancient North Down mounds? What were theirrelationship to the great stone circles of Avebury and the sacred sites of WindmillHill and Silbury? And what is the meaning of the “fifth mound” created soperfectly in line with the tumuli out of the July 2003 barley? Even though it had been twenty-four days since the formation was first discoveredand after days of heavy summer rains, the barley with its long hairs was stillsustained in undulating waves. Throughout the formation, each of the “dots” inaerial photographs separated by vertical arcs, were standing barley surrounded byfluid barley waves. I didn’t want to step forward because the plants are still sospringy, alive and make a crunching sound as if any weight breaks them down fromtheir exquisite, transcendant undulations and flows. I touched one of the 12-inchhigh waves and it felt like a sculpture. I tried to pick up the beautifully combedbarley hairs that swirled in the wave, but they were all stuck together as ifhairsprayed. Biophysicist W. C. Levengood has long hypothesized that the energy that interactswith the crops in the truly mysterious patterns is a “spinning plasma vortexcontaining microwave energies.” The microwaves might be responsible for rapidheating that causes water in the growth nodes to burst out creating small holescalled “expulsion cavities.” Dozens of barley plants that I examined had expulsioncavities, lengthened and darkened nodes, in addition to the hairsprayed solidity of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the barley waves that turned and swirled only at the nodes without any wrinkles,creases or breaks between the nodes. If spinning plasma energies and mysterioussmall lights are the non-human circlemakers, to date no one knows what the sourceof those spinning energies might be. It is that mystery which draws some of us backto the fields with the hope that one day, or night, we might see a formation likeNorth Down in the moments of creation.
