Drawing for Linda Moulton Howe by Urandir Oliveira of the violet-coloredlight that filled the bedroom on September 15, 2002, and allegedly transportedUrandir to a non-human craft, © 2003 by Earthfiles.com.March 1, 2003 Corguinho, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil - Last night I learnedfrom analytical chemist Phyllis A. Budinger of Frontier Analysis, Ltd., inChagrin Falls, Ohio, that the blue threads in the affected Oliveira sheet arecotton and the white are polyester. The blue and white threads are woventogether throughout the sheet, but there is great variability in the body imprintfrom what looks like burned and charred cloth right next to cloth with onlyslightly darker blue discoloration that also outlines the entire body print.This is especially interesting when you consider the facts that cottondecomposes, or scorches, at about 148 degrees Centigrade, or about 300 degreesFahrenheit. But polyester threads don't melt until 500 degrees F. There aremelted, gummy threads intricately woven throughout the blue cotton threads -even in places where the cotton is not scorched, or even brown, as indicated bythe white arrow in the photograph below."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The close-up above shows the subtle range of the energy that interactedwith the cotton fibers, scorching through sections down into the mattress, while leavingfibers in between partially intact.

C. Levengood, who talked tome yesterday about his preliminary examination of the samples I brought backfrom Brazil.Sampling process on February 9, 2003, where I measuredand removed sections from the body print along with normal controlsfrom the sheet, pillow and ceiling.

Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, GrassLake, Michigan: \"I've never seen anything like this. This takes a very, very highprecision kind of energy, probably at the molecular level, to transform thisbecause it changed the internal energy of the material. Whatever the energy was,it was extremely precise.I ran on to one region right at the edge of the brown material and the threads -you could actually see where they were white, normal threads, and then just afraction of a millimeter away, they had begun to be transformed. They wereglassy-looking, but you could still see the individual fibers inside. Then inanother half millimeter, they were totally homogeneous into this opalescentmaterial. So, that transition is very precise and you could see the line ofdemarcation if you had the incident light just at the right angle on the sample,you can see this band of change. So, the energy here is very, very precise.I measured the weight per unit area of a control sample. The weight of thecontrol cloth is 17 milligrams per square centimeter. The blue region is 24%higher in weight than the control cloth. I don't think anything was added. Itmeans the energy has changed the density of the polyethylene and to changedensity means you have to change the molecular structure. There is someincredible technology here.On the mattress cover which is all polyester, there is a section of six verticalfibers which are normal and crossed by three horizontal fibers. In the middle ofthe horizontal threads, there is one single thread at the mid-point which ismelted and none of the fibers on either side are melted, horizontally orvertically. The diameter of that single melted vertical thread is 0.5 millimeterswhich is a bit wider than the .44 millimeters measured in the normal polyesterfibers. That increase in diameter is found only in the melted threads, probablydue to surface tension effects.In my examination of the bed sheet Sample 2 (left leg), the melted (vitreous)threads were applied in one area as very uniform, precise \"ribbons.\" But, acentimeter away the melted threads were very irregular and drawn out into spiralshapes and \"neck-down\" affect like a water drop. This occurs when a viscousliquid like a molten glass thread is pulled, you get a \"neck down\" region fromthermal effects and as it cools it hardens that way.\" In Part 5 of this series from my research in Corguinho, Brazil, farmer TulioCosta describes a November 24, 2001 light that moved above his land,\"exploded without sound,\" broke a tree in two, blinded two calves and killedthree others and a cow.Continued in Part 5.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
