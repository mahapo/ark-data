September 9, 2003 Grass Lake, Michigan - Earlier this year on March 14,2003, a restaurant owner in Salt Lake City contacted The Salt Lake Tribuneabout the banana squash he cut open filled with seeds seemingly carved withsymbols and letters. (See Earthfiles 03/15/03 and 03/28/03) Kasim Barakzia isowner of Salt Lake's Baba Afghan Restaurant in which he has also been themain cook for nine years. Banana squash is a staple in his restaurant meals andhe was shocked while cutting open one to find what he thought were symbolsand letters on the seeds, including several with what he perceived to be theArabic symbol for \"Allah.\" On left, close-up banana squash seed \"engraved\" with Arabic symbol for \"Allah.\"On right, close-up of Arabic symbol for \"Allah.\" I interviewed Kasim and he agreed to ship some of the seeds to biophysicist W.C. Levengood for examination. Levengood's photographs and findings aredetailed below. His conclusion is the same as the Utah State UniversityExtension Service: the markings were made by insect larvae.W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, GrassLake, Michigan: \"The adult squash bug bores a hole into the squash that youdon't even see and goes into the parenchyma tissue that holds the seeds and laysits eggs. Later, the eggs hatch into larvae which immediately go to the hilum, thenatural holes at the tip of each seed. The hilum controls the amount of waterthat the seeds take up from the plant.HOW DO THE WORMS END UP IN NEARLY ALL THE SQUASH SEEDS?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Because the adult lays a helluva lot of eggs. They are the same color as thesquash inside, so in the mature fruit, you don't even see them. Kasim (restaurantowner) has probably thrown thousands of these egg/worm-infested seeds awaycleaning other squash and didn't even know it.)\"Fibers of insect cocoon formed on seed by larva going into pupation.Photomicrograph 40X © 2003 by W.
