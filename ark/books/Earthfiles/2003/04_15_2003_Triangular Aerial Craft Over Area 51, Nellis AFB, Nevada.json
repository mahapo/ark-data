On page 20, Restricted SOM1-01Majestic-12 Group Special Operations Manual \"Extraterrestrial Entitiesand Technology, Recovery and Disposal,\" published April 1954by the United States of America War Office.April 14, 2003 Boise, Idaho - In early August 1995, I received a plain manilaenvelope with only a San Francisco terminal annex postal stamp to indicate itsorigin. Inside were several pages and a title sheet that said, \"Restricted SOM1-01Majestic-12 Group Special Operations Manual - Extraterrestrial Entities andTechnology, Recovery and Disposal, TOP SECRET/magic eyes only, Warning!This is a TOP SECRET-MAJIC EYES ONLY document containingcompartmentalized information essential to the national security of the UnitedStates.

Description of the Craft states: \"Documented extraterrestrial craft (UFOBs) are classified in one of fourcategories based on general shape, as follows:a) Elliptical, or disc shape.b . Fu sel age o r cigar sh ap e.c. Ovoid or circular shape.d. Airfoil or triangular shape. This craft is believed to be new technologydue to the rarity and (sic) recency of the observations. Radar indicates anisoceles triangle profile, the longest side being nearly 300 feet in length.Little is known about the performance of these craft due to the rarity ofgood sightings, but they are believed capable of high speeds and abruptmaneuvers similar to or exceeding the performance attributed to types \"a\"and \"c.\" The caption below the 1954 drawings said: \"Illustrations in this diagram are gathered from documented sightings in AirForce and Central Intelligence and from examination of wreckagecollected from various sources years 1947-1953 inclusive.\" Since receiving the SOM1-01 manual, I have talked with a former CIA employeewho said he saw a very similar manual during his intelligence career, but that itwas a 1970 version. If the training manual is real and is a true insight intogovernment knowledge and cover-up, insiders knew long ago that large,unidentified, triangle-shaped aerial craft are not made on Earth. Between Groom Lake and Papoose Lake is Area 51 and S-4 at Nellis AFB, Nevada,allegedly devoted to back-engineering extraterrestrial technology and housingextraterrestrial biological entities, both alive and dead. Triangle-Shaped Craft Over Area 51, Nellis AFB, NevadaIke Bishop, of Boise, Idaho and State Director and Chief Field Investigator forthe Mutual UFO Network (MUFON), saw his first large triangular aircraft onTuesday, May 21, 2002. He was parked at Mail Box Road near Area 51 atNellis AFB, Nevada that night for a skywatch with his friends and colleagues.Ike and others were meeting together for Memorial Day weekend as they havedone each year for some time in order to share information about the secretiveand TOP SECRET Area 51.Ike, along with his friends, was surprised to see aerial, triangle-shaped craft onthree nights, beginning May 21, 2002.Interview:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Ike Bishop, Idaho State Director and Chief Field Investigator, MutualUFO Network (MUFON), Boise, Idaho: \"We were sitting at Mail Box Roadand watching the mountain tops of Area 51 and S-4 and behind us, we noticedthree triangular lights that were coming through right behind the peak ofTimpahute Peek, three lights in a triangle and this appeared to be a craft and thecraft had thousands - and I'm not exaggerating with that figure - of littletwinkling lights around it. They were like flashes. Had it not been for thoseflashes, we probably would have missed the craft altogether.WERE THE TWINKLING LIGHTS COVERING THE TRIANGULAR BASE?WERE YOU SEEING A SOLID TRIANGLE OF THESE FLASHING LITTLELIGHTS? OR WERE THEY ONLY ON THE PERIMETER?They were completely around it. They appeared to engulf the craft. However,the three triangle lights on the tips of the craft were very much evident. Theywere more prominent than the little flashes.YOU'VE GOT FLASHES OF SMALL LIGHTS THAT ARE DEFINING THESHAPE OF THE TRIANGLE AND THEN AT THE VERTICES WITHIN THESHAPE OF THE TRIANGLE, YOU'VE GOT A LIGHT AT EACH OF THOSECORNERS?That's correct.WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE CORNER LIGHTS?It appeared to be a very dull yellowish-white and there appeared to be no lightin the center bottom of the craft.WAS THIS PASSING OVER YOU AS YOU WERE STANDING OUTSIDEYOUR CAR?Yes, I stopped and got out to take a look at it and it was traveling very slow. Itcame between Badger Peak and Tickabo and I've been up that peak many timesand I know the size of that valley. This craft appeared to take up almost theentire valley, which would put it - I estimate the craft to be about half a mile inlength.HUGE THEN?It was very huge.HOW CLOSE OVER YOU DID IT COME?It came within 1.5 to 2 miles because it went right down the top of the mountainrange north towards Rachel and it was just above the mountain peaks there.Those mountains in that area are quite low. I would say probably a total of5,000 feet above elevation.WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING IS SOMETHING THAT IF IT WERE HALFA MILE LONG AND IT WAS ONLY A COUPLE OF MILES FROM YOU AND5,000 FEET UP, ANYTHING THAT BIG, YOU WOULD THINK YOUWOULD HAVE HEARD SOME SOUND.There was absolutely no sound. It was silent and it was moving very slow. Weestimate it was moving about 25 to 30 mph and just gliding along very quietlywith these little flashes. While it was under power, these flashes were veryevident.WHAT HAPPENED?It traveled on down through the mountain ranges towards Rachel. We watched itwith binoculars. It left one valley and into another and eventually was out ofsight. But then 10 minutes later, here it came back. Total sighting time that nightwas a couple of hours, I would estimate.DID IT GO RIGHT BACK OVER THE SAME VALLEY."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Went right back over the same valley and disappeared over Tickabo peak again,basically right back where it came from.AT THAT POINT, HAD YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE IT BEFORE?No, this is the first one that I've seen down there. I've had other sightings, butthis is the first I've seen that large and that close up.IN TERMS OF TRYING TO CONFIRM WHETHER THIS COULD BESOMETHING THAT THE UNITED STATES IS DEVELOPING AT AREA 51,OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD FALL IN THE EXTRATERRESTRIALCATEGORY, IF IT TRULY WERE A HALF MILE LONG, DOESN'T THATSEEM TO ARGUE AGAINST ITS BEING AMERICAN MADE?When I talked about this at the Little Ailey Inn the next day at breakfast, someof the locals were telling me that they had been watching them for the pastcouple of weeks.And I asked, 'Them? You mean, there's more than one?' And they said, 'Yeah,there are theirs and ours.'And I asked, 'How do you tell the difference?' And they said, 'Apparently ourshas a red light in the center of the craft itself on the bottom side. Theirs doesnot.' I have nothing to confirm that, but that's apparently what the locals seem tothink. We were able to see them three nights in a row.WHAT HAPPENED THE NEXT NIGHT AND THE THIRD NIGHT.The next night, it appeared at about the same time and the time frame wasbetween 9:45 p.m. and 10 p.m. at night. Other sightings of craft we've had downthere have been very early in the morning, but this was about 9:45-10 p.m. atnight when we first saw it. Same thing the second night.On the third night in Rachel, people were starting to arrive for the gathering andwe had a local affiliate CBS news crew out of Boise, Idaho here. They were ableto capture this on video by watching the mountains over Area 51 there.(Videotape Frames of the Triangle-ShapedAerial Craft Will Be Posted Here Soon)About the same time of night, we were watching the flares that came up over themountain and all of a sudden, up popped that craft.WHY DID YOU KNOW THERE WERE FLARES?There was a huge ground flare that came up.HOW DID YOU KNOW IT WAS A FLARE?We've seen a lot of flares down there that they drop from the jets and there was alot of flare activity that night because at Indian Springs, there was some kind of amilitary maneuver going on down there and there were a lot of flares beingdropped by the airplanes. But this one came up from the ground, similar to arocket. You could see the trail (arcing up into the sky) and then there was a hugeillumination.THAT ILLUMINATION LIGHTED UP THE SKY FOR ABOUT FIVEMINUTES AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED?This craft popped up just to the left of it. The way it looked when it popped upover the mountains is that it came just straight up and on this sighting, therewere no flashes, no miniature flashes around it. It hung motionless forapproximately a minute or two and then began to move slowly towards thesouth. This was the only night that it did not have the little miniature flashesgoing on around it. My guess is that those flashes were some kind of cloakingdevice. We took several still photos of this and the only thing that comes out inthe pictures are the little flashes of lights. So, it's my guess that this is some kind"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"of cloaking device.\"More Information:See Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume II: High Strangeness in theEarthfiles Shop.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
