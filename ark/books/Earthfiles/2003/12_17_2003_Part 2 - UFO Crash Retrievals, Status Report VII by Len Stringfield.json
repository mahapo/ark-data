Question: While the Simeone case probably had no connection with the1942 incident, occurring \"north of Georgia,\" were the three WWII eracrashes happening so close together, time-wise, a freak coincidence?Hardly. Or, were the mishaps a result of increased surveillance during aperiod of world conflict which began in September 1939? Digressing a moment, despite the reports of early mishaps, I opted tostretch a bit in my working hypothesis to allow for the susceptibility ofcrashes in 1947 in the USA Southwest, notably in New Mexico. As apostulate, the alien mind set might have had a concern for the U. S. rapiddevelopment of a nuclear and rocket-missile arsenal, and thus, werewilling to take greater risks in low-level tactical missions. And, despitetheir marvels of technology, it is feasible that they might haveunderestimated the effects of radar or New Mexico's sudden violentelectrical storms. Once again considering the 1941-1942 incidents, one other aspect to lendcredence to an early alien presence during WWII is the so-calledfoo-fighter, a frequent aerial interloper observed by personnel flying in alltypes of military aircraft, in all theaters of war. Numerous reports ofencounters started coming in during the latter part of 1943, a few earlier.

For details of thiswell-known incident, I refer to a massive report: The White Sands ProvingGround UFO Incidents of 1947, by researcher Tim Cooper, whospecializes in the history of UFO happenings in the early days of thepost-war period. I quote the following, in part, from his report: Excerpt from: The White Sands Proving Ground UFO Incidents of 1947by Tim Cooper\"Military Pilot Reports - 1941 to 1946 To put things into perspective, it is necessary to review some of theverified UFO reports from the newspaper accounts and officialUSAAF records. Much of the Army and Navy intelligence UFOreports covering the Pacific, Southeast Asia and European Theatersof War are still classified to this day. Only a few reports haveemerged through the Freedom of Information Act. As a result of the Japanese Naval air attack on the U. S. naval base atPearl Harbor, Hawaii, invasion fears were at a fever pitch. The firstfly-over of unidentified aircraft occurred at 1800 hours, December 8,1941. Army radar operators detected 50 aircraft 100 miles east ofSan Francisco. The alert was given and a blackout issued. The 50unidentified aircraft broke formation and became two flights. Oneentered the Bay Area and the other proceeded in a southwesterlycourse. The next night San Francisco came under two more air alerts.The first alarm occurred at 0145 hours, and the second again at 0202hours. A blackout was ordered and fighter aircraft were on standby tointercept. It is reported that engine noises could be heard in the Bayarea, but no bombs were dropped. Another alert was sounded at0405 hours, but as before, no bombs were dropped and no fighterswere sent up to intercept the unidentified aircraft. Lt. General JohnL. DeWitt was convinced that California was being invaded by aJapanese aircraft carrier task force, which was never located. Early on the morning of February 25, 1942, people of Los Angelesand surrounding communities were awakened by the thuds ofanti-aircraft fire. For eleven weeks, Los Angeles, San Francisco,Portland, Seattle and other west coast cities had been on alert. Radar"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"stations reported unidentified aircraft and nightly blackouts wereordered from the San Joaquin Valley to the Mexican border.Newspapers reported in banner headlines about the 'Air Raid' thathad taken place over Los Angeles. There was, however, no air raid. What had happened on thatFebruary morning was a by-product of the fear and hysteria thatgripped many parts of the country in the early months of World WarII. Radar personnel thought they had detected enemy planes.Anti-aircraft gun crews, who shot more than 1,400 rounds into thenight sky, thought they saw and heard targets in the intersectingsearchlights. Fighter aircraft of the 4th Interceptor Command hadfighter pilots on hold as their engines were overheating whileawaiting permission to take off and attack the unidentified. No suchorder was ever given that night, which no doubt left many militaryand civilian observers on the ground wondering what radar hadpicked up (radar was a top secret device developed just before thewar) and what the AAA batteries were firing at. From approximately0245 to 0720 hours, a blackout existed over Southern California.There were several questions left unanswered. A declassified secret memorandum released in 1974 through theFreedom of Information Act, provides some clues as to why the airraid over Los Angeles has remained a mystery to this day. Thememorandum was written by General George C. Marshall, Chief ofStaff, U. S. Army, to President Franklin Roosevelt, dated 26February 1942. In part it reads:\"The following is the information we have from GHQ at thismoment regarding the air alarm over Los Angeles ofyesterday morning: Unidentified airplanes, other than American Army or Navyplanes, were probably over Los Angeles, and were fired on byelements of the 37th CA Brigade (AA) between 3:12 and 4:15a.m. These units expended 1,430 rounds of ammunition. As many as fifteen airplanes may have been involved, flyingat various speeds from what is officially reported as being'very slow' to as much as 200 mph and at elevations from9,000 to 18,000 feet.\" It is obvious from this 'officially reported' tracking of fifteen aircraft'flying at various speeds' and 'elevations,' that distance and heightradar were accurate enough to convince the War Department thatformations at various altitudes were operating over Los Angeles. Themost interesting disclosure suggested that Army G-2 knew more thanthey were willing to admit by saying:Investigation continuing. It seems reasonable to conclude thatif unidentified airplanes were involved, they may have beenagents for purposes of spreading alarm. Such conclusion issupported by varying speed of operation and the fact that nobombs were dropped. The embarrassed military kept a tight-lip on this event and refused tooffer any detailed explanation to the confused public as expressed insuch statements from Frank Knox, Secretary of the Navy, who said,'as far as I know, the whole raid was a false alarm and could beattributed to jittery nerves,' or Henry Stimson, Secretary of War, whostuck to the official report issued by General Marshall, that the raid"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"was caused by fifteen planes - from somewhere. It has been suggested that what was seen by the AAA batteries wereflares or balloons, but in any case the radar operators and gun crewshad locked onto something flying slowly over Los Angeles andsurrounding cities. A photographer from the Los Angeles EveningHerald Examiner had photographed something in the intersectingsearchlights which caused a considerable targeting effort by the AAAbatteries. From several eyewitness accounts, it was metallic and washit repeatedly, and yet no debris or crash was ever recovered. There were other such 'attacks' on the West Coast and mainland ofthe United States and Canada. When the 'airplanes' flew over thecities and rural areas, no anti-aircraft fire greeted them. Nor didnewspapers report the 'bombings.' The air raids of North Americawas, in fact, one of the best-kept secrets of World War II. Obviously, the U. S. military intelligence did not want news of this toget out in the press for fear that enemy intelligence agents would pickthis up and use it for propaganda and possible targeting for anysabotage operations being planned. The Formation SightingsUnidentified formations of 'silvery aircraft' were reported by militaryground forces in the Pacific island campaigns. One comes from aMarine Sergeant Stephen J. Brickner, 1st Paratroop Brigade, 1stMarine Division, USMC, on Tulagi Island, the Solomon Islands,Guadalcanal Campaign. According to Brickner, on the morning of 12August 1942, '...the air raid warning sounded. There had been no'Condition Red' ...I was puzzled by the sound. It was a mighty roar that seemed toecho in the heavens. It didn't sound at all like the high-pitched'sewing machine' (Charlie) drone of Jap formations ... the formationwas huge; I would say over 150 objects were in it. (According toretired Brigadier General Edwin H. Simmons, USMC, the Japanesedid try to attack Tulagi Island by air, but did not get underway until17 August 1942. The only air raids by the Japanese on Tulagi,occurred on 21 August and 26 August, and was met by VMF-223.Any reference to the 12 August air raid does not appear in anyofficial Marine Corps historical records.) Instead of the usual tight 'V' of 25 planes, this formation was instraight lines of 10 or 12 objects ... A few things puzzled me; Icouldn't seem to make out any wings or tails. They seemed to wobbleslightly and every time they wobbled, they would shimmer brightlyfrom the sun. Their color was like highly polished silver. No bombswere dropped ...' Mission 115In a secret message sent by Major Ryan to all formation leaders ofMission 115, a brief but direct operations order was read. It stated:'THIS AIR OPERATION TODAY IS THE MOST IMPORTANTAIR OPERATION YET CONDUCTED IN THIS WAR. THETARGET MUST BE DESTROYED. IT IS OF VITALIMPORTANCE TO THE ENEMY. YOUR FRIENDS ANDCOMRADES THAT HAVE BEEN LOST AND THAT WILLBE LOST TODAY ARE DEPENDING ON YOU. THEIRSACRIFICE MUST NOT BE IN VAIN. GOOD LUCK. GOODSHOOTING, AND GOOD BOMBING. ANDERSON.COMBOMDIV ONE.'"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" It was October 14, 1943. It was one of the largest aerial fleets everassembled. It was also destined to be one of the strangest encountersof UFOs experienced by Air Force pilots and crews. The details of the famous Schweinfurt raid are documented by theBritish Royal Air Force and the Headquarters Eighth BomberCommand, United States Strategic Bombing Survey, and the ArmyAir Force Bombing Mission Reports. Mission 115 comprised of twohundred fifty-seven B-17 Flying Fortresses. The late Colonel Budd J.Peaslee, was the air commander of Mission 115. Martin Caidininterviewed Colonel Peaslee just before his death. Colonel Peasleetold Caidin that as the B-17 formations made their bomb run,'something strange' was encountered in the skies over Schweinfurt,Germany, on that October day in 1943. The attack formations are at 20,000 feet with fighter escorts. Thebombardiers are instructed to carry Polaroid lenses and filters fortheir bombsights because a slight haze is anticipated overSchweinfurt. Colonel Peaslee is designated 1st ATF Air Commander.During the German fighter attacks and exploding AAA fire, the crewsof the B-17 formations observe another element in the sky. Smallformations of unknown objects were descending upon the bomberformations. They were not aircraft, or flak bursts, or falling bombs, orfighters, or debris of destroyed aircraft, or parachutes, or fallingbodies. It is recorded by the historical files 'as one of the mostbaffling incidents of World War II, and an enigma that to this daydefies all explanation.' According to a recently declassified teletype report to theHeadquarters, 1st Bombardment Division, the strange 'formations'were described.'NEAR THE TARGET A CLUSTER OF DISCS WEREOBSERVED IN THE PATH OF THE FORMATION. NO E/AABOVE. DISCS WERE SILVER COLOR. SEEMED ABOUT1\" THICK AND 3\" IN DIAMETER. WERE GLIDINGSLOWLY DOWN IN VERY UNIFORM CLUSTER. A/C 026WAS UNABLE TO AVOID DISCS AND RIGHT WING WENTDIRECTLY THROUGH A CLUSTER WITH ABSOLUTELYNO EFFECT ON ENGINES OR PLANE SURFACE. ABOUT20 FEET FROM THESE DISCS NOTICED MASS OF BLACKDEBRIS OF VARYING SIZES IN CLUSTER 3 X 4 FEET.OBSERVED TWO OTHER A/C FLYING THROUGH SILVERDISCS WITH NO APPARENT DAMAGE. OBSERVED DISCSAND DEBRIS 2 OTHER TIMES BUT COULD NOTDETERMINE WHERE IT CAME FROM.' The interrogation of the bomber crews was intense concerning thedescriptions given of the 'silver discs.' Every man gave the sameaccount and did not deviate, 'at the time there were no enemy aircraftabove.' This is confirmed in a secret memorandum dated 24 October1943, from Major E.R.T. Holmes, F.L.O., of the 1st BombardmentDivision to Colonel E. W. Thompson, A-2 Pinetree. Theinterrogation and debriefing was classified SECRET/EYES ONLY.According to the Group Leader's Report of Mission 115 flown on 14October, 1943, there was nothing to indicate there was any confusionby the crews of enemy air attack or weather conditions that couldexplain the sightings of the 'discs.' Major W. E. Dolan reported:'...we were attacked by approximately 200 E/A, consisting ofME 109s, ME 210s, FW 190s, JU 88s, and ME 110s. ...The"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"weather over the target was clear with a slight haze and a goodbomb run was made.' It should be noted that the 'discs' approached the B-17 formationsfrom above and that no enemy aircraft were observed at that time. Allenemy aircraft were below the formations.The size of the discs, fromthe observer's vantage point, were quite large, given the distancesinvolved. Also, the fact that the 'cluster' was 'gliding slowly'downward in 'very uniform cluster' suggest that some intelligence wasin control. Also, the mention of 'black debris of varying sizes' werealso observed within the cluster. No engine failures or surfacedamage was the most puzzling of the encounter. The sightings so unnerved the Army Air Force intelligence officersthat a special intelligence operation began that same month. Aclassified project was undertaken in England with the cooperation ofthe SIS and OSS. The project was called the 'Massey Project,' itsobjective was to determine the source of the 'silver discs' and prove ordisprove its Nazi German origin. The project began in October 1943after the Schweinfurt raid and allegedly after a 'disc' had crashed innorthern England near Scotland.
