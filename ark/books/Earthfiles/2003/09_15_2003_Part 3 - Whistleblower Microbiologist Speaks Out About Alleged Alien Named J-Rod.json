Hamilton. Bill: I WANT TO GO BACK TO SOMETHING YOU SAID. YOUSAID THAT TERRESTRIAL VIRUSES WERE AN ARCHIVE.HOWEVER, PREVIOUSLY YOU HAD SAID THAT THEY ASKEDYOU TO MANIPULATE NON-TERRESTRIAL SOURCEMATERIAL AND MOCK IT UP WITH SOMETHINGEXTRATERRESTRIAL. SO IF WE ARE TRYING TO TAP ASOURCE MATERIAL THAT IS EXTRATERRESTRIAL ANDVIRAL IN NATURE, ARE WE GOING BACK INTO THEEXTRATERRESTRIAL HISTORY TO TRY TO FIND ANEXTRATERRESTRIAL ANCIENT VIRUS THAT WE DON'TKNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE EXTRATERRESTRIALS NOW? First of all, I didn't say that viruses WERE evolutionary archives. I said,that it is currently thought that viruses are evolutionary archives. Secondly, are we dipping into the primordial soup of the human genomeandpossibly going to capture other encoded retro-viruses and activate them asaresult of the present time giving of our ???? table???? Yes, possibly weare. Thirdly, do we know for certain when the percentage of the humangenomewhich we know is virally and it's other fragments, viroid fragments - do weknow the percentage that came via natural selection, micro-evolutionarychange? I'm not going to have myself classified as a monkey's uncle.(laughter) Although I can accept that since it is the ultimate reality - why not? If Ican accept what I've seen already in my life, I ought to be able to acceptthat. Will we be able to discern between the two I think is the question. BJ: THAT'S MY QUESTION. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The answer is 'No' unless we are receiving more information from the Orionfolks - whoever the hell they are - purely ascended spiritual beings orwhatever. I don't have an answer for that. Or seeking more informationfromthe J-Rods of that which I am privy. then the answer is - if we're not, thenthe answer is, 'No, we don't.' If we are, 'Possibly.' I don't know thenature of the information that is coming from them because they are notproviding me with that information. WHAT YOU GET IS COMPARTMENTALIZED. JUST EXACTLYWHAT THEY THINK YOU NEED TO KNOW. Look, look, if it comes out that we are in the fix that we are in - what isthat going to do? How is it going to help or hinder? Hell, I don't know.With the collective mind of present humanity, we're going to get a positiveanswer? Look at the fate of the world? BJ: IT COULDN'T GET MUCH WORSE. What are we going to do? Are we going to hand (the Paradox) to KofiAnnan,Secretary General, United Nations. (laughter) I'm not belittling him. He'san intelligent wonderful man, but what the hell is he going to do with it?!!What the hell is the United Nations going to do with it? What's thecollective mind of humanity - given our present mentality - do?!!!This may bring us to a faster demise by increasing more fractionation of thehuman populace. We haven't even figured out yet that this God and thatGodand this God and that God are all part of the same God. Why don't wefigureout that problem?!!!! No matter what you want to call him, her, whatever -the beautiful thing from which we come. People want to own everything,except the solutions. The thing that will free us is if we own the solution.But they want to own the process. (Transcription note: There is a break here.) Dan: The clean sphere would raise up through a diaphragm iris from thefloor. They kept him (J-Rod) in a separate location - I don't know whattheywere doing while he was being staged there before we came in. They nevertold me that, OK? However, the 4-5 designation was given specifically tomake him comfortable because of the addition of the two numbers, whichis infact why they built a 9-level base. And there have been a number of peoplein the past - Robert Lazar, I believe mentioned nine.But going in, there would be an entry team, usually a team of one when wewould go into the clean sphere. We would be given a medical and suitedwhilecatheterized and plugged.... TURN TO TAPE SIDE # 2 (first words about degeneration of something are not clear) which was associated with a heat loss problem due to the peripheralnerves.(LINDA HOWE QUESTION: Then how could J-Rod be in a veryCOLD hydrogenatmosphere?) BJ Wolf: I have tried to answer her question as best I can, based uponmy notes from conversations with Dan over the last few years. Dan"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"indicated that the EBEs had a two part biochemical system. One partinvolved an external secretion that was pumped to the skin surfaceusing their secretory system (exocrine system). This system apparentlywas a parallel development in which their version of sebaceous glandsbecame fused with their version of sweat glands. It apparently cameabout when the alteration took place in their physiology that beganwhen they were driven into a subterranean existence.The second part of the biochemical issue involves the systemicallyproduced antifreeze Glycoproteins (AFPs) which are present in thesurface and subintegumental tissues. These, if I understood correctly,help to regulate their internal responses to the external temperature,helping them maintain internal regulation of their body temp.As they suffered pathology and degenerative problems, their exocrinesystem started to limit the production of the Antifreeze Glycoproteins,and cause glycerol/glycol stability issues. This meant that they werestarting to have trouble managing the cold temperatures, and theirbodies were losing heat. That's one of the big things they wanted tohave our scientists work on, to repair at a genetic level for them.I hope this helps. Dan: I was asked specifically to find out the origin of that problem havingnoidea at the time about this time paradox business and all of that. No cluewhatsoever about it. I was basically just trying to help a fellow being.Finally, it was determined that the only way would be a cloning effort, orclone therapy, genetic therapy. The only way to proceed with that therapywould be to produce hybrid associations between present genomes, humangenomes - (very hard to hear)- a present human genome with their (J-Rod)present genomes. We tinkered a little bit with (says something here notunderstandable) fresh human medium - (I'm not going to get into the originof that fresh human medium.) - so that we could by associating geneticallythe fresh human media with his medium, a partial alleviation of theperipheral neuropathy. This then lead to the next level - that we were chatting about earlier -and it also lead to the end of the Q-94 document referenced earlier. NOW CAN YOU SAY FOR A MOMENT, DAN, WHATMOTIVATES YOU TO NOW DISCLOSE THIS MATERIAL TOTHE PUBLIC? Sure. That's not a problem at all. We speak in America freely. In 1986, Iwas told to \"Be All You Can Be.\" (military slogan?) I was not told therewould be a circumventing of the United States Constitution for me to beallI could be. I was not told there was a certain ???? of the United StatesConstitution in the group for which I worked. I feel a pressing need forfreedom and having grown up in a reasonably free environment, havingsignedmyself into the slavery that I now find myself within, it's pretty easy forme to say, \"Enough is enough.\" Now, on to the higher values that people would probably want to say therealreason why I want out - (I just gave that's a personal reason I want thehell out. DO YOU KNOW WHO IS CONTROLLING THIS SHOW ON THETOP? They probably know I'm seated here today (room in Las Vegas, Nevadalibrary).I'm sure they do. I'm sure they do. Now, whether or not they want this"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"information evolved and are aware that I am sitting here, or they are justaware that I'm sitting here, I don't know. I don't know. That's the bigquestion: is what I heard was a project called PATCHWORK, which wouldbe aspoon feeding of the people of the information, because I only know acertain amount. I don't know everything. WHO IS RUNNING THE SHOW? You asked who is running the show? YES. I've come to know a group - I shouldn't say I've come to know the group.I've come to know of the group called the Committee of the Majority. Thiscommittee is built of thirty-three men. They are Masonic-based and theyarepeople who set in the highest positions of privilege and power within theUnited States government and other governments. THIS COMMITTEE HAS MEMBERS NOT RESTRICTED TO THEUNITED STATES ALONE? As I understand, yes. It would be difficult for me to name names of peopleand I don't know for sure are seated there. It would also be dangerous tothe very cause that I set here for freedom (for myself.) HOW DOES THIS GROUP, MAJESTIC 12, FIT INTO THAT? Majestic 12 is a group of scientists and scientific advisors who work forthe Committee of the Majority. Now, I have had occasion when I wasinvolvedwith Project Aquarius to have to send to the so--called Majestic 12 thedocuments which you are privy, the leaked material from my deceasedfriends.And I had association with them on that level. One of the Majestic 12 - or Ishould say was alleged to be a member of Majestic 12 - was present at theclean sphere when I was in the clean sphere. I've mentioned his namebefore.This might be risking again my freedom because of the very problems wefacenow as a society. So, I've got to be careful about that whether or not thatsacrifices my freedom. OK. His first name is Zbigniew. That's as far as I will go. I had personalexperience with that man Zbigniew. He was in fact present at Sector 4when Iwas involved with the J-Rod. Going out from Project Aquarius, I had cometoa closer association by means of up and down the line, the conduit, withtheCommittee of the Majority. I believe that the Majestic 12 group onlyassociated with particular extraterrestrial projects that are going on thatare going on within the community and not associated with the entirety ofthe scientific projects which are going on within the community. Theprojectwe are currently working with, for instance, is not per se an extraterrestrialsubject-based project. So, the fact that I've been told not to route things tothe Majestic Committee of 12 concerning the documents that I've beenproducing is kind of indicative to me that they are onlydealing within a certain subset of the scientific projects. More than that,I don't know or can't say. I would just be stabbing in the dark."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" BJ: BUT ESSENTIALLY, THE COMMITTEE OF THE MAJORITYIS OVER MAJESTIC 12? Yes, is the umbrella group. Again, as I understand, they are Scottish riteMasonic based. I think they might be a little lenient with me because mygrandfather was a (high ranking) Mason. Maybe that's why the leniency.But Idon't see the leniency, I see the fuse running short, starting to run shortwith me and I - you know, you can hear the clarion call in the distance. Bill: IS THERE ANY PARTICULAR SIGNIFICANCE - YOU WEREMENTIONING A CYCLE OF MINE AND YOURS THAT THESEALIENS SEEM TO BE ADHERING TO AND THE NEXT PERIODCOMING UP WOULD BE OF 2003. Ye s . IS THERE ANY INSIGHT ON WHAT MIGHT CHANGE? The only thing I know for sure is that their relationship with us istreaty-based. YOU MEAN AS? As in the alleged Orion visitors and confirmed Reticulan visitors. It's atreaty-based relationship. That treaty and negotiations for furthercooperative work is due for re-upping and that re-upping is due in 2003.Now, I've been kind of hurried up in the project in which I am currentlyassigned. I've been told to have a working model of this theory presentableby March 15 next year (2003). There might be coincidence having to dowiththose two dates, or it might be entirely coincidental. I'm not sure.Why are they letting this happen? I don't know. I have not been able tomoveright or left without getting watched, that I know. BJ: OVER HERE... I don't think they are doing it out of their good graces! WANTED TO MEET WITH YOU ONE NIGHT AND SHE HAD ANENCOUNTER INSTEAD WITH THREE CLASSIC MEN INBLACK? BJ: They had the classic look, the feel. They didn't feel right. They werewearing black, they were wearing like a fedora (hat). It was terrifying.Instead of meeting Dan, I was met and I don't know what these peoplewere. Bill: THEY SHOWED NO EXPRESSION? No expression in their faces. It was terrifying. They spoke and it was likethey had rehearsed what they were saying because they couldn't speaknaturally. It was wrong. The whole thing was wrong. It felt wrong. Theywalked wrong. They moved wrong. They were pale. I finally broke andran. Iwas scared to death! I haven't been able to go back to that park since. Ican't do it. Dan: My experience - your description is consistent with gentlemen withwhomI've had previous encounters. They would come in and observe what wasgo in gon. A few of them attempted to interact with me and frankly, I don't care to"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"interact with them. Like I said, it might look like a duck and it mightquack like a duck, but if it ain't a duck it ain't a duck! BJ: I was made to feel threatened. I was definitely made to feel threatened. Dan: Their presence is threatening and the reason why it is threatening isbecause you can - have you had the experience of being in the presence ofadead body? BJ: Oh, yes, I have. Dan: An animated dead body, isn't that approximately the same - ananimateddead body? BJ: Oh, my God, that is so close it is unbelievable. Dan: It's not - this is going to sound like something out of an idiotichorror movie, but it gives - to not overuse the word, it gives an 'alienfeeling.' They sang me Happy Birthday one year, two of them. Bill: They are like ghouls. BJ: That's it! Dan: I don't know what the hell they are, to be very honest with you. Bill: That (ghoul) is what we would think of. BJ: Yes, it felt ghoulish. When they walked towards me, it felt ghoulish,it felt like they were thinking about each step they took. They weren'tmoving normally. Dan: They seemed out of place. Or maybe it is that we feel out of placebeing around them. I don't know. But they seem out of place. Bill: Dan, we should start wrapping this up. Is there anything you wouldlike to make a statement or something as if you were talking to like thelarge audience I was talking to up in the Bay area. What would you like tosay to the people? Dan: Besides the fact that I don't believe the Queen of England is areptilian?! Bill: Yes! (laughter) Is there some kind of statement you would like tomake? Dan: I could sit here and be self-serving with a statement. But there arethings which are much more important than my selfish nature. We arewalkingtoward, at the moment, a time of human destiny. The decisions that we aremaking at present are enhancing the potential for the ill-fated decisionsthat we are supposed to make in our future to occur. I hope and I pray that we make the right decisions. However, I have no ideawhat those right decisions are. The only thing that I can hold topersonally, taking off the guise of the biologist, is being a human being.the only thing I can hope is that whoever he or she or it is - we wish tocall it Creator - that protective force that is surrounding humanity sinceits inception - I pray that he is listening to our weeping and pulls us backfrom a precipice made of our own designs.

But ..."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Dan: I'd like to know in whose armies?
