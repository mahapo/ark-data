June 18, 2003 Ogbourne St. George, Wiltshire, England - Ye s t e r d a yafternoon, British crop formation researcher and author Lucy Pringle, called meright after she and a friend had walked through the new Ogbourne St. George,Wiltshire crop formation. The 37-circle pattern was discovered Sunday, June 15,in young wheat in the natural bowl below the Ridgeway as shown in the upperphotograph. Essentially, the location is isolated and well hidden if you are onthe ground. The nearest house is the farmer's two miles away.In addition to looking for physical signs of human footprints, stomper boards,poles or damage on the crop and not finding any, Lucy also buried twenty"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"bottles of water for scientific study of changes in water frequencies after a week'sexposure underground in the crop formation soil.Close-up center of Ogbourne St. George crop formation.Aerial photograph © 2003 by Lucy Pringle.Interview:Lucy Pringle, Crop Formation Researcher and Author, Petersfield,Hampshire, England: \"I have to say, Linda, this is the first formation that I'mreally excited about this year for a number of reasons. It's so beautiful it sort ofgives one a kick, you know? It's fantastic and your heart sort of swells. And yousee the surrounding countryside and it just fits in so perfectly as though it's apalette and some wonderful artist has been out there and picked the right spot todo a painting.WAS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS FORMATION THAT REMINDEDYOU OF PAST FORMATIONS?Yes, there was one a couple three years ago that was remotely similar atBeckhampton, in young green, barley. But nothing of the intricacies of this oneand not of this size. I took a friend with me named Christopher Weeks. He iskeenly observant. If anything is manmade, Christopher is going to find it out ifanybody can.One of the impressive things is the formation's total inaccessibility. It is milesaway from anything, from roads, tracks, anything. It's in a bowl in a big field justbelow the Ridgeway and there just are no tracks or roads leading to it. In fact,the farmer very kindly took us in his Land Rover because we could only get inso far, and he took us in the remainder of the way. Even the Land Rover wasbouncing around roughly. He is not a happy farmer. He doesn't want peoplegoing into it and this I do have to stress. The farmer thinks it's done by vandalsand went on about his work.But we walked in and examined very closely the crop which is almost standingupright again. It's in young wheat and the formation was very lightly imprinted. Ithink one of the things you can find, if a plank or bamboo poles had been used,is where they step forward, there is the weight of a man's foot. You get crushedstalks and you certainly in green wheat or green barley you get that grey film,which is part of the growing part of the plant. You get that wiped off (fromimplements) and that can never be replaced. So, this is something you look for. No Evidence of Tracks, Boards, PolesWe couldn't find a single stalk that was crushed or where the grey film had beenremoved. And if people had used a stomping board, they very often do it at anangle. If you feel one crushed stalk, you can go along at an angle. You then takeanother man-sized step and you will find exactly the same thing, a systematicthing. Very often, you can't see it visibly. It's only by running your finger alongthe stems that you find it crushed and then you run your finger in a diagonalmanner and you find all the other stalks crushed in this diagonal manner. Then"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"you take another man's step forward and you'll find exactly the same evidence.NONE OF THAT IS IN THE OGBOURNE ST. GEORGE FORMATION?Absolutely, none whatsoever. And it's huge. It straddles more than eighttramlines. The spaces in between the tramlines are 60 feet, and each tramline is6 feet itself, so you're getting close to 600 feet diameter.Another thing, Linda, when you go into a formation is that the perimeter whereyou get the cut off point between the standing crop and the falling crop ifsomeone is using a plank or a board or canes or whatever, you get a chaffing or abruising along the first line, the first row of the standing crop. This is visible inyoung crop and in canola because canola bruises and in the young crop youhave the grey film. But this one (at Ogbourne St. George) was absolutelyperfect!I asked Christopher if he had an explanation and he said, 'I haven't. I'mmystified.' Lucy's Scientific ResearchSo we buried my (water) bottles and we go back in a week's time to collectthem.COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU DO WITH THE BURIED BOTTLES OFWAT E R ?They are tested. I bury control samples outside the formations and this is vitalbecause when you test the ones inside, they have to be compared with thecontrol tests outside. Over the years, they have been tested by a number ofscientists by Dr. Farrell Smith. He tested them for resonances and he found acompletely different pattern of resonances in the ones buried inside theformation as opposed to the controls samples. Dr. Beniste, who is very wellknown with his hypothesis of water having a memory, he tested them for me andhe was so amazed by the results he couldn't believe it. So, he had to retest them.He found exactly the same results.We also tested the bottled water for nitrates. This is interesting because nomolecule of nitrate can actually enter the glass bottles. This is what Jim Lyons isalways talking about that we are dealing with frequencies and a residualfrequencies after the (circle-making) force has hit. Those frequencies are in theseeds and in the plants and in the soils. When a bottle is buried, it is in contactwith the residual frequencies from the original hit, if you like, so it is thefrequencies that have penetrated the bottles and the water inside.AND CAN BE MEASURED IN THAT WATER?Yes. I am working now with a Dutch doctor and he particularly wants samples totest for homeopathic qualities. Today I buried two bottles in each place, so Ithink we buried 20 bottles (in Ogbourne St. George.)WHAT WAS THE WEATHER LIKE ON THE NIGHT BEFORE THIS WASFOUND ON JUNE 15?It appeared on Saturday night (June 14, 2003) and it was a fine night, noweather.SINCE IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT, WAS ANYONE OUT AND NOTICEANYTHING UNUSUAL, SOUNDS, LIGHTS OR ANYTHING?No, it's so isolated. You just wouldn't. There is nobody around to see it. Thefarmer himself is about 2 miles from the formation.I am also excited that I collected seeds from the center, from the perimeter andfrom control areas outside and those are going to go off to Jim Lyons with whom"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I do a lot of work. He's an academic at York University. We're going to test thosefor using the infrared technique to test the protein and moisture content, whichwe did for the first time last year in the wonderful formation at Alton Barnes,the Celtic Knot in 2002. That was the most magical one last year.I have been in so many circles over the year, but I find one or two each year thatreally give me a sense of wonder and awe and something I cannot explain. Theyare totally different from anything else. Physical Effects Inside FormationANY SWOLLEN OR BURST NODES, ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THEPLANTS?No, and I looked for that, but I think you're going to find that more often inmature crop than in green crop. But the crop had risen up so far.I'll tell you one thing, both Christopher and I were starting to feel very ill. It wasaccumulative. Sometimes you get a whammy of energy when you go in. AndChristopher was standing there looking quite dazed and said, 'We'll do this lastbottle and then we'll get out. I can't think. I'm really feeling very strange. I'mtotally disoriented. My thought processes aren't working. I've got to go!'\"We b s it e :http://home.clara.net/lucypringleCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
