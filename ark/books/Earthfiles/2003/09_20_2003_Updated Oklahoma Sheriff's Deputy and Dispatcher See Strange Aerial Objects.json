But it was in either August of '98or '99 when my wife and I saw two black objects, looking like flyingbowling balls but of an unknown size, flying silently from West to Eastover Broomfield, CO. A severe weather watch was out, and I was watching a tornado \"wannabe\"black cloud hanging quite low to the SE of our house where I was standingat the bend of our front sidewalk. I happened to glance to my left when thefirst black globe appeared from behind the pine tree of the neighbor acrossthe street. I watched in amazement and yelled to my wife after I got overmy initial astonishment. By the time she got outside, the ball had passedbehind the sagging cloud of the tornado \"wannabe\" and then the ball wasbut a black speck in the sky to the East. She returned to the kitchen andabout perhaps 15 to 20 minutes later, I saw another emerge from behindthe pine tree and follow the exact same path.

The objects were absolutely silent and on adetermined path. Have never seen anything (like it) before or after since.Richard BeckerBroomfield, CO 80020\" September 20, 2003 Hugo, Oklahoma - For at least fifty years, lawenforcement, pilots, scientists and other credible eyewitnesses have described,sketched, photographed and videotaped a bewildering variety of shapes andsizes in unidentified aerial craft that are completely silent. See: MoreInformation at the end of this report. This past week on Tuesday, September 16,two employees of the Choctaw County, Oklahoma Sheriff's Department inHugo, Oklahoma - northeast of Dallas, Texas, near the border - watched threeobjects in broad daylight which have left them both shocked and wanting toknow where the craft came from and what were they doing flying over theirsmall town of about 6,000 people? Larry Taylor is Deputy Sheriff at the Choctaw, Oklahoma Sheriff's Departmentand has been in law enforcement for thirty years. His wife, Darnette, is thedispatcher at the Choctaw Sheriff's Department. On Tuesday at 3 p.m., thecouple were driving from downtown Hugo after lunch on a clear, sunnyafternoon, when both were stunned to see what was in the sky.

There wasjust a small amount of clouds and a slight breeze from the north kind of a coolday. I observed a silver, round ball-like object high in the sky. I assumed thiswas about 5,000 feet up in the sky to the west. This was a silver object like around ball and very luminous and shiny silver colored."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Large, silver, luminous sphere that Choctaw County Deputy Sheriff Larry Taylorand Choctaw Sheriff's Dispatcher, Darnette Taylor, watched hovering silently high in thewestern sky aboveHugo, Oklahoma, for several minutes on September 16, 2003, untilit changed colorto grey and disappeared. Drawing © 2003 by Darnette Taylor.We watched this for three or four minutes as I was driving west out of town. Wegot out of town and observed this same object turn to what I would call a dullgrey color and then simply disappeared.At this point I had turned south on another road, a country road, and had startedtowards our house and my wife was sitting in the passenger seat. She pointedout her passenger door window and said, 'Look at that!' I tried to look. I sawsomething above the trees, but I couldn't see good, so I stopped my carcompletely in the middle of the road and got out of my car. My wife stayed inthe car. She was shocked and didn't get out. But I walked behind the car andlooked over the trees and there were two what I would call cylinder-like objects,which was no more than 600 to 800 feet in the air, just to our west, and theywere silently proceeding in a southwesterly direction. They were above the treesand I watched them maybe two minutes until they were out of sight. They werenot going very fast. They were just gliding and there was absolutely no soundwhatsoever.Two, large, tan-colored, cylinder-shaped aerial objects about 600-800 feet altitude driftingtogether slowly and silently in a southwesterly direction a few minutes after the silversphere disappeared. Drawing © 2003 by Darnette Taylor.These objects I would describe as cylinder-like. One was a little bit in front ofthe other one and also probably either a light tan or very light brown in color. Idid not distinguish any changes in color on these two objects. They stayed about"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the same color and drifted off to the southwest and because of the terrain, Icould not see them anymore.WAS THERE ANYTHING IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT COULD GIVEYOU ANY SENSE OF SIZE, BOTH IN THE SPHERE AND THE TWOCYLINDERS?The silver orb, or ball, as I call it, it was huge. Because of the height and size ofit and how high it was, it almost looked like a small moon. But I'm sure it was alot closer. The cylinders themselves, I've flown in a 757, which is bigger than a747. And each one of these seemed to me to be bigger than a 757 jet.SO, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REALLY LARGE.Very large. Very large. Darnette Taylor, Dispatcher, Choctaw, Oklahoma Sheriff's Department:\"DID YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND WHO IS A DEPUTY SHERIFF DISCUSSTHE POSSIBILITY THAT WHATEVER YOU WERE SEEING MIGHT NOTBE FROM THIS PLANET?We were in shock and we talked about it several times. It was really strange. Allthe objects were strange, unique.AND NO SOUND FROM ANY OF THE THREE?No, no, not that I could hear. They had to be really big, but they were close tothe treetops and stayed real close to the treetops.WHICH SUGGESTS THEY WERE TRYING TO AVOID BEING PICKED UPON RADAR?I would think so, because it's different to see you see planes, but these were notplanes. There were no wings. Different. Just like the drawing. What I saw is whatI drew.\" Dep. Larry Taylor: One of them (cylinders) nearest me, it had something onthe side, but I cannot remember what it was, but the best I can remember, itresembled you know how these there used to be a show on television that had adrawing of Infinity, like a stretched out 8. It seemed like it resembled thatsideways, not up and down, but sideways.LIKE AN INFINITY SYMBOL.Ye s .AND IF IT WERE MADE IN SOME ENGINEERING PLACE ON EARTH,WHERE DO YOU THINK THOSE AERIAL CRAFT WOULD BE MADE?I find it hard to believe that they would have completely silent craft this size,our government would, that would be so silent.AND SO BIG."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yeah, and so big. I mean, that's incredible. And how is it tied into a large, roundorb, object like we saw. It shocked me that I would see two at the same time. Isaw one object. And then just a minute or two later, I see two more objects andof different configurations.Those cylinders could have fitted in it. It was that big But I don't know how tocompute the size. It was very big, I'll put it that way. It reminded me of what themoon looks like in the sky. But this was broad daylight and it was not a moon,that's for sure.AND IT WAS SILVER.It was very silver. It was shimmering and shiny, silver colored until all of asudden it went to a dull grey and then POP! it was gone. And we couldn't see it.And if it was our government, I can't see them flying it in broad daylight if theywant to keep it secret.RIGHT. AND WHAT THE HECK ARE THEY USED FOR?Now, that I would have no idea.\"Deputy Taylor said he thought the two cylinder-shaped aerial objects could fitinside the huge, silver sphere. The size of the cylinder objects might have beenknown by the U. S. government as far back as the early 1950s.In the April 1954-dated \"Majestic-12 Group Special Operations ManualSOM1-01\" that was mysteriously distributed to some of us in the 1990s.

Air Forceradar reports indicate they are approximately 2 thousand feet long and 95feet thick, and apparently they do not operate in the lower atmosphere.Very little information is available on the performance of these craft, butradar reports have indicated speeds in excess of 7,000 miles per hour. Theydo not appear to engage in the violent and erratic maneuvers associatedwith the smaller types of craft.\" There is no specific description in the SOM1-01 manual about perfectly round,gigantic silver spheres large enough to hold two of the cylinder-shaped aerialcraft.Page 20, \"Description of Craft,\" SOM1-01 Operations Manual, April 1954.The SOM1-01 Operations Manual that was sent to Bob and Ryan Wood, me,and others, is reprinted in its entirety with its images in my book, Glimpses ofOther Realities, Volume II: High Strangeness.
