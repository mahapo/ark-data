January 31, 2003 Olympia, Washington - On Thursday, January 30, 2003,Associated Press and local media in Olympia and Seattle, Washington, reportedthat a man's body had been found forty feet up in a tree inside the Olympia citylimits. Police got it down and transferred to the Thurston County Coroner'sOffice. This morning, I talked with Deputy Coroner Terry Harper who confirmedthat the official cause of death is \"cerebral anoxia and suicide.\" That means lackof oxygen to the brain caused by hanging.Mr. Harper said that the victim was Mark Steven Budd, 39-years-old when hecommitted suicide in the tree several months ago. His mother, who lives in SanDiego, told the coroner that her son had a history of depression, substance abuseand even attempts at suicide by hanging before. Apparently Mr. Budd had\"camped right at the base of where this tree was. And he had been staying outthere for quite some time.\"Interview:Terry Harper, Deputy Coroner for Thurston County, Coroner's Office,Court House, Olympia, Washington: \"What we have been able to find, itlooks like the person has been up there a little less than a year. It looks like he"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"climbed forty feet up in the tree and tied a rope around his neck and hunghimself.HE WAS NOT SLUNG OVER BRANCHES AS IF HE HAD BEEN DROPPEDFROM SOMETHING?Oh, no.WAS THE MAN IN A SKELETAL STATE HAVING BEEN UP IN A TREEFOR MONTHS?Yeah, pretty much. His flesh was very hard and dry. His flesh was more or lessmummified. He was whole and mostly skeletal underneath. There was somehardened muscle tissue and unrecognizable remains of organs. He was prettymuch a skeleton and skin.THERE HAD BEEN NO SCAVENGING ON HIM BY SMALL ANIMALS?No small animals, it did not appear. Mostly just your standard flies and a littlebit of ant activity, but he was quite a ways up in the tree, so it kept him clear ofmost of those things.YOU WOULD THINK THAT MAYBE EVEN SQUIRRELS OR BEARS ORSOMETHING MIGHT CLIMB A TREE IF THERE WAS A HUMAN BODYHANGING THERE?You might think, but this tree was in the city limits of Olympia. Large scavengersand predators probably don't even hang out down there. As far as maybe aopossum might try to go up that high, squirrels easily could. I don't know. Butfor the most part, he was pretty clean.DID YOU FIND THE EVIDENCE OF THE ROPE THAT HE HAD HUNGHIMSELF WITH?Oh, absolutely. He was still connected. The rope appeared to have a nylonbraid, so it was very durable.IT WAS STILL AROUND HIS NECK?Oh, yes.THE PERSON WHO FIRST SAW HIM LAST YEAR DID NOT WANT TOREPORT SEEING A BODY IN THE TREE BECAUSE HE WAS AFRAID OFTANGLING WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT?That's the message that law enforcement gave me. Apparently he was justsurprised that the person was still there and wanted to get it off his chest.IT'S A SAD STORY,It is a sad story, but at least we were able to find someone. He could have been avery difficult person to identify. And families are always wondering. They needto know the reason they can't find their loved one. They need to know thereason he is not at family events and holidays. The truth is hard, but I'm just gladwe were able to identify him quickly and let them know.SO THERE IS SOME CLOSURE.Absolutely. Without it, you have none. You always wonder. You never knowwho that knock at the door is going to be. And even in their heart, they mightknow something is wrong. They still need to know. As well as other familieswho are looking for closure who this person (in the tree) is not connected with.They at least need to know that this is not their loved one because their anxietylevels go up as soon as they hear about an unidentified person. So, it affects alot of people.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
