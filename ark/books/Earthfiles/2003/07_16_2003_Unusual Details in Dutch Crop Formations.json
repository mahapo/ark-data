To the east is Stadskanaalwhich had formations in 2002 and 2001 that changed over time. July 16, 2003 Wilhelminaoord, Drenthe, Holland - Yesterday Dutch cropcircle researcher, Robert Boerman, who produces the website, www.dcca.nl,received a phone call about two crop circles in the same wheat field nearWilhelminaoord, Drenthe, Holland. The farmer is 60 years old and told Roberthe had been working his fields for about forty years. He said he had never seensuch patterns in his crops before and he was very happy that circles had finallycome in his field. \"That's a different reaction than we are used to receiving fromfarmers!\" Robert told me. Usually farmers are frustrated and angry.The farmer was definite that the patterns had to have formed during the night ofSaturday to Sunday, July 12 to 13 because Saturday night at 6 p.m. he was inthe field and there was nothing to see. But the next morning at 9:30 a.m., hefound the formations. He entered the field and said there were no footsteps orother tracks that would suggest the work of humans. 'Nothing, nothing at all,' hesaid. He showed Robert in the field today that if he put his booted foot on thecrop, physical marks could clearly be seen. But the farmer said there were nomarks anywhere on Sunday morning.Single circle with odd ring indentation inside in the foreground; ringed circlewith two odd indentations on inside circle and outside ring in background.Photograph on July 16, 2003 © 2003 by Robert Boerman."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Formation Measurements:The single circle in the foreground is about 13.70 meters (45 feet) and hasa 20-centimeters-wide (8 inches) border pressed down deeply around theinside of its perimeter. All wheat crops laid down counter-clockwise.The ringed circle in the background is about 23 meters (75 feet) indiameter and has a 20-centimeters-wide (8 inches) border pressed downdeeply on the inside perimeter of the ring. The ring's width is 2 meters.10(7 feet).

It wasa beautiful lay, really!ALL OF THE PLANTS IN EVERY PART OF THE FORMATIONS WERELAID IN A COUNTER-CLOCKWISE ROTATION?Yes, that is correct. Then there was the unusual part. It looked like three thinrings only 20 centimeters wide that were different from the rest of the formationsthat we could see because the plants were pressed lower than the rest of theformations. For example, in the single circle, there was this narrow band goingaround the inside perimeter of the circle, but it was all the same direction to theleft, counter-clockwise, only a bit lower than the rest of the downed plants inthe circle. Really strange.I think the ring of 20 centimeters was flattened first and then the rest of thecircle. It looked like that because they were overlapping each other.Close-up of 20-centimeter-wide (8 inches) borderin shadow around inside perimeter of single circle. Border plantswere pressed down more deeply than the rest of the flattened crop inside the circle.All plants laid counter-clockwise, including those in the deeper border.Photograph © 2003 by Robert Boerman.IN THAT 20 CENTIMETER RING, COULD YOU SEE ANY DAMAGE TOTHE CROP AS IF IT HAD BEEN PUSHED DOWN HARD BY SOMEFORCE?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"No, nothing. Nothing at all just as the farmer told me, 'Absolutely nobody hadentered the field before I did.'The pressed thin ring around the inside of the flattened circle's perimetercan faintly be seen on the left in this photograph © 2003 by Robert Boerman.Both the inner flattened circle and the outer flattened ring have the narrow20-centimeters-wide borders of more deeply pressed plants in them as well, making a totalof three unusual details in the formations. Photograph © 2003 by Robert Boerman.SOME PEOPLE WOULD ARGUE, 'WELL, THERE IS A TRAMLINE GOINGRIGHT THROUGH THE RINGED CIRCLE AND RIGHT ALONG THE EDGEOF THE BIG CIRCLE AND THEY WOULD BE EASY TO WALK INTO TOMAKE THESE PATTERNS.' WHAT DO YOU THINK?Yeah, that is possible, but the farmer said there was some grass growing in thetramlines and absolutely no traces at all (of footprints). The ground was soft, soif you walk inside it you have to damage the soft plants and soil. But he saidthere were no traces at all. When we walked around the big ring, you couldexactly see where we put our feet, our tracks were clear.DID ANYONE SEE OR HEAR ANYTHING UNUSUAL?No. I asked the farmer if anyone saw lights or even that cylindrical cloud(reported by two people at Oss on July 9). But he said no one had reportedanything, 'Nothing at all.'\"More Information:291 Crop Formations in Holland, 1990 - 20032003, as of July 16: 82002: 212001: 172000: 181999: 19"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"1998: 191997: 431996: 1001995: 71994: 301993: 71992: 01991: 11990: 1We b s i t e s :http://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://home.clara.net/lucy pringlehttp://www.invisiblecircle.de and http://www.invisiblecircle.org/ser/d-archiv-2003.htmlhttp://www.kornkreise.chhttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://www.heramagazine.nethttp://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://www.cropcirclenews.comhttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
