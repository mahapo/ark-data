Many of thosereports have reached Kenny Young, an award-winning TV producer-writer-director who works full time as InfoChannel Coordinator for theTelecommunications Board of Northern Kentucky in Florence, Kentucky. In hisoff-hours, out of personal curiosity, Kenny produces and reports the UFOResearch website, http://home.fuse.net/ufo.Interview:Kenny Young, Award-winning TV producer-writer-director; Coordinator,InfoChannel for Telecommunications Board of Northern Kentucky; andreporter of the UFO Research website, http://home.fuse.net/ufo, Florence,Kentucky: \"Certainly we've had more than our normal share of UFO sightings inOhio, including with the most recent on October 15, 2003, in Hamilton, Ohio.That was an object witnessed by Mr. Stuart Linder who I did speak with shortlyafter the sighting. The object he described was very unusual, sounding like anupside down diamond that rotated with multi-colored lights. Mr. Linderindicated that the object was visible for almost a ten minute duration and made arapid departure that he said was of extreme acceleration.I found that report to be quite interesting in the context of many other reportsfrom southern Ohio recently. We've had several dramatic reports from AdamsCounty, from Hillsboro, Ohio, several reports. Also from southern Ohio regionsaround Canton, Akron and Proctorville, people have observed unusual lights inthe sky.WHAT WOULD BE THE MOST UNUSUAL THAT YOU'VE HEARD IN THEPAST FEW MONTHS, GIVEN THAT YOU'VE BEEN GETTING REPORTSFROM OHIO FOR SOME TIME?I received a very dramatic report from a gentleman in Gahanna, Ohio, northeastof Columbus. He explained to me that he had observed a tremendous object. Hedescribed this as a monster object that appeared over Gahanna. The gentlemandescribed to me as he was driving his car toward town, this tremendous sizedobject literally filled the windshield of his car.\"Gahanna, marked in yellow, northeast of Columbus where the familyof four saw huge disk on September 22, 2003, at sunset.Gahanna, Ohio Family Sees Huge DiskA computer analyst husband, his wife, their 9-year-old son and 13-year-olddaughter were driving home in Gahanna, Ohio, on September 22, around 8 p.m.The sun was low on the horizon right above the tree line. Suddenly, all four sawa huge, dark disk-shaped object surrounded by changing colored lights appear infront of the setting sun. The family has asked not to have their names used in"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"this report, but gave permission to share their experiences in hopes that othereyewitnesses in Gahanna might have seen the same, bizarre object. The husbandand wife told me this week that they were all shocked by the huge disk.Mr. \"Smith,\" Gahanna, Ohio: \"Because we couldn't really believe what wewere seeing. It was not an airplane, a blimp, any type of aircraft I'm familiarwith, and it was big enough to fit at least three or four 747 jumbo jets in it.Drawing of large disk-shaped aerial object above car by Mr. \"Smith,\" who wasdriving to Gahanna, Ohio, home with his wife, 9-year-old son and13-year-old daughter on September 22, 2003, at 8 p.m.WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE THIS SO EXTRAORDINARY?It made no sound whatsoever. Something that size usually makes quite a bit ofnoise. When we first saw it, there were lights, and the lights seemed to changecolor. Then the lights went out and the object turned totally black. When I saidit turned black, it turned absolutely black. Not like it was black paint, butalmost like it was sucking in the light around it. I mean it was pitch black. Itstarted with lights on it. After the lights shut off, it was just black.\"Drawing by Mrs. \"Smith,\" age 31, of large disk-shaped aerial object as it moved slowlyand closely over the family's Honda, blocking out their view of the sunset, on September22, 2003, at 8 p.m.Mrs. \"Smith,\" Gahanna, Ohio: \"It almost looked like an oval or big frisbee!WHAT WERE THE COLOR OF THE LIGHTS THAT YOU SAW ANDWHERE WERE THEY?They were going all in a line, not flashing like you would see red, orange andpink and then they would just disappear and the lights were gone. So, we alllooked at each other and said, 'OK, where did it go?' I sped up to drive and golook for it and we couldn't find it. It was like we looked down for a minute andlooked back and it was gone.HOW HIGH IN THE SKY DO YOU THINK THIS OBJECT WAS?If it had been an airplane, it would have crashed into my house that's how low itwas. The sun was actually setting in the sky at the horizon and this thing passedat about the same level from our angle where we were and literally completelyblocked the sun out for a good fifteen seconds. It was moving very slow, and thesize of it took forever to go across the tree line. And for something that big tonot make a sound and then take off somewhere with no trace seemed prettyunbelievable.IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW IF ANYBODY ELSE AROUND 8P.M. ON SEPTEMBER 22, IN GAHANNA, OHIO, SAW THIS OBJECTBLOCK THE SUN?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"If they did, I want to know! I don't want to be the only people who sawsomething that large in the sky. Impossible. We couldn't have been. Or maybe ifwe had been at the right angle at the right time. But somebody else had to see it.It had to be over the freeway. It had to be as big as it looks. We were only twoblocks away from the freeway.\" Drawing on left by 13-year-old daughter.

DIDYOU GET ANY REPORTS ABOUT UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTSAROUND THAT AUGUST 24, 2003 TO SEPTEMBER 9, 2003, PERIOD OFTIME?Kenny Young: \"I tell you we had so many reports that involved multi-coloredobjects and lights. But what really surprised me were the number of reports inwhich people described large objects, tremendous objects. In addition to theGahanna, Ohio sighting, there was an eyewitness from Seaman, Ohio, which isestimated to be around seven miles south of the Adams County Crop formation(Serpent Mound.) This person also describes a very large triangular-shapedobject that had head lights that the witness said was situated around the outerrim of the triangle. It was visible in the night sky and the object had brilliantlights which rotated around it.DID ANYONE REPORT SEEING ANY OBJECT IN THE SKY LOWER TOTHE GROUND?There was a Hillsboro sighting that was investigated by researcher, DonnyBlessing, from southern Ohio MUFON (Mutual UFO Network.) The object wasvery low to the ground and seen by residents near a trailer park in the area. This,I believe, was on August 22, and we have looked at this sighting with interestbecause it was shortly after this that the crop formation was discovered adjacentto the legendary Serpent Mound burial site in Adams County. It was at ll p.m. inthe evening. It was a very peculiar object with a ring of yellow lights thatapparently, the witness claims, came low overhead.We tried to do some follow up by contacting the Highland county Sheriff'sDepartment. They had nothing, of course, in their logs about this sighting. Butnevertheless, we were impressed by the report and much to our surprise the dayafter we find out that a crop circle appeared in this locality. So, we are leftwondering exactly what is going on here (in Ohio)?\"More Information:If anyone has more information about the Gahanna, Ohio, disk of September 22,2003, at 8 p.m. CT, please contact me: earthfiles@earthfiles.comWe b s it e :http://home.fuse.net/ufoCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund PolicyCopyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
