No oneknew where I was and I had no set itinerary. I could see and hear helicopterscircling over Woodborough and then on to the East Field, on to West Stowelland back around again. The helicopters were hovering, then lowering downtoward the fields and then rising back up again. I had seen these same maneuversback in August 2000 during one day that seven of us did a night watch at theEast Field and watched through a night vision scope as an oval-shaped lightjumped from side to side and changed shape into a bright square.I decided to drive over to the Woodborough church to park my car and walk thepath that would take me to Woodborough Hill. From the top, I would have clearviews in all directions to watch the helicopter activity and to see the twoformations that had been discovered previously in wheat near farmer TimCarson's barns at the base of the hill. One pattern was being called the \"bearclaw\" and another nearby was dubbed the \"snake.\"The \"bear claw\" crop formation reported on July 14, 2003, by Andy Buckley,near the Tim and David Carson barns on the right; the \"snake\" that was discoveredlater on July 25, 2003 directly below Woodborough Hill and its beech treesin foreground.

Iwalked into the open church to see its stained glass windows and a few minuteslater, I walked outside toward my car and was astonished by the sudden loudroar of a helicopter. It was a solid black Apache bristling with all its gun portsonly about 300 feet above me. The helicopter turned tightly over my head as ifobserving me and I took photographs of it with my 35mm camera. As the blackhelicopter flew away with a great roaring sound, I wondered why I, or anyone,would be subjected to such a threatening aerial machine at close range near achurch."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Solid black Apache helicopter that turned low over me at theWoodborough church around 10 a.m. on Tuesday, August 29, 2003.Photographs © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe. Soon I was to hear another story about an encounter with Apache helicoptersfrom Andy Buckley, a computer graphic artist from Manchester, who likes toclimb Woodborough Hill during the crop circle season in Wiltshire, day or night,to look for helicopters and the mysterious balls of light linked to formations.Andy told me that on July 14th he was on top of Woodborough Hill for aboutan hour and then started back down the hill around 12:45 p.m. When Andyreached the style he had to climb over, he looked over the fields in front of him.\"I was absolutely certain there was nothing in the field then. Otherwise, I wouldhave done something about it. I would have gone down there and investigated it.But I did not notice anything.\"After that - close to 1 p.m. - he was walking near the Woodborough canal bridgeabout a quarter of a mile from Tim Carson's barns at the base of WoodboroughHill when he heard and videotaped two Apache helicopters maneuvering lowover the wheat field next to the barns. After the helicopters were gone, a cropformation was there, but Andy does not think the pattern that some called the\"bear claw\" was there before the helicopters arrived.White arrow points to the Woodborough bridge between the Woodboroughchurch and the Carson barns. \"Bear claw\" formation is on the left of the barns, reported onJuly 14, 2003, by Andy Buckley.

At first I thought it was a farm vehicle. It wasquite a low-pitched rumbling sound. But it got louder and louder and suddenlyrealized it was a helicopter. So, what I did then was I ran back to the bridge andstood on top of the canal bridge and saw two large, military helicopters and theywere sort of maneuvering over the field where this crop formation is or was.BUT IT WASN'T THERE THEN FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW?From my point of view, there was nothing there. I just saw these helicopters. Iidentified them as Apache long bow helicopters because I've seen them beforearound this area this year. They are obviously black and don't seem to carry anydiscernible markings. Now what was interesting is that one of the helicoptersseemed to be hovering above the crop. I estimated it was quite low down, maybeno more than 20 to 40 feet above the crop.AND THIS IS RIGHT BEHIND TIM CARSON'S BARN?Just in the field that basically is joining the canal on the right hand side if youare walking up to the barns. So, this helicopter is hovering over the field. Theother helicopter was circling around higher up. I don't think at that point theyknew I was there because they wouldn't have been able to see me on the otherside of the bridge. I got to the top of the bridge and was aware of this helicopterand the helicopter that was hovering close to the ground seemed to have a kindof appendage hanging underneath it which looked rather like a black sphere orpod which was attached to the helicopter. The helicopter was stationary.What Andy Buckley's perspective from the bridge would have been on July 14, 2003,when the black Apache helicopter was hovering low over the field to the right of the barnsbelow Woodborough Hill.

It seemed to just appearjust below the helicopter. But I would have said it rose from the ground. It didseem to be rising upwards and it was in a very local space on the ground. Itwasn't across the field. It was in a very restricted space just below the helicopterand it had the appearance of mist, or maybe water vapor or that effect that youget .That helicopter then just flew across towards Salisbury Plain and at that point, Ithen got my camera out of the bag and switched it on. The other helicopter, thepilot had obviously seen me by then and for the next few minutes it just circledme in a very low level and could have been filming me. I don't know - observingme, but obviously the pilot had noted my presence which was quite intimidatingbecause the helicopter was flying quite low. It circled for several minutes andthen flew off in the same direction (that the first had gone).I HAD THAT SAME EXPERIENCE AT THE WOODBOROUGH CHURCHWHEN I ARRIVED ON JULY 29 AND HAD A BLACK APACHE CIRCLERIGHT OVER ME NOT MORE THAN 300 FEET ABOVE ME IN THECHURCH PARKING LOT.Yeah. Well, I've observed these two Apaches flying around here for at least thelast three weeks (in July 2003), usually in pairs. I also filmed one of the Apachehelicopters hovering over a crop formation near Tan Hill for nearly five minuteswhich I filmed. It was obvious that he was observing the crop formation atHuish, the people in the formation and me as well. I was on the side of the hill.He did the same thing and circled over my head.13-point geometry reported below hills in wheat near Huish not farfrom West Stowell on July 20, 2003. Aerial photograph © 2003 by Lucy Pringle.YOU'VE HAD ALL THIS HELICOPTER ACTIVITY OVER YOU AND YOUFEEL INTIMIDATED, HOW DO YOU DISCOVER THE FORMATION? DIDYOU IMMEDIATELY SEE IT? OR DID IT TAKE AWHILE FOR YOU TO SEEIT WAS THERE?I suspected something was in the area of the field, but at the time, it didn't reallyregister. It was a hot day, but I find myself walking back up toward the hillagain. I got beyond the barns and I looked around as I normally do and noticedthat this crop formation was situated just behind the barns. It was quite obviousto see. It was quite a large formation. I just kind of stood there with my mouthopen. At the time, I was slightly confused because having seen the helicoptersthere and having seen this mist effect or whatever it was, I was a little concernedthat there might be some kind of harmful radiation or something in the field. So,I didn't immediately go and have a look. I waited around for a half hour or so.And then I went in it and investigated it.NOW THE QUESTION IS: WAS THE FORMATION IN THE ACT OF BEINGCREATED BY SOMETHING WE DON'T UNDERSTAND AND THEHELICOPTERS WERE THERE TO MONITOR? OR WERE THEHELICOPTERS SOMEHOW INVOLVED IN ITS CREATION?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Well, that's the $1,000 question I suppose. All I can say is that there were twoApache helicopters hovering over that field in what looked like suspiciouscircumstances. I don't recall seeing the formation there before the helicoptersarrived, but there was certainly a formation after they disappeared. Butunfortunately, I didn't actually see the formation appear. All I saw was this kindof mist effect. But again, there are theories people have observed mists formingover fields and there is a train of thought that suggests that perhaps at the time ofcreation of a crop formation, the release of water vapor due to rapid dehydrationcould cause this kind of effect.CAN YOU PUT THIS IN THE CONTEXT AND DESCRIBE WHAT THATMAN WHO HAD MILITARY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT BRITISHINTELLIGENCE WITH AMERICAN INTELLIGENCE STUDYING THEGRID HERE THE IMPLICATION BEING SOME KIND OFELECTROMAGNETIC GRID AND TRACKING INVISIBLE OBJECTS?Yeah, the theory goes that there is an invisible geomagnetic grid well over thewhole earth, obviously! but in terms of the Vale of Pewsey in this area, yeah,they would I was told they are aware of a kind of grid, a kind of matrix thatcovers this area which is a natural thing. They are aware of this and research it,fly over it, and are aware of certain points in the matrix where there are magneticanomalies.It's obvious in this area we have a lot of unexplained phenomena. We have cropformations, UFOs, balls of light, paranormal experiences... and I've come to theconclusion that just as the military defense has a task of investigating what theywould consider intrusions into our airspace by unexplained objects, theypresumably would extend to interference in terms of ground space. I'm talkingabout unexplained crop formations, crop markings, however you look at it, Ithink the M.O.D. (Ministry of Defence) would look at it in the same light.All I was told is that they have avionics technology which is capable of seeinginto areas of the electromagnetic spectrum, infrared, ultraviolet, whatever, thatwe can't. They obviously can see they have thermal imaging, they can see atnight objects on the ground emitting heat or light. They presumably can recordanomalies. These objects are manifesting in other parts of the spectrum. Theyhave been picked up in infrared photographs, so therefore, they would be ableto detect objects which would be invisible to us but to them would probably bevery visible. So, I was told that probably a high percentage of these unexplainedobjects are invisible to the naked eye, but to them are quite visible.\" While we were all wondering if all the helicopter activity in the crop fields wasan effort to interfere or block crop formation creations, two extraordinaryformations were reported on August 3 at Morgan's Hill and on August 4 beneaththe White Horse in Alton Barnes.Continued in Part 2.We b s it e s :http://www.cccrn.cahttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://home.clara.net/lucy pringlehttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.dcca.nl"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"http://www.bertjanssen.nlhttp://www.invisiblecircle.de and http://www.invisiblecircle.org/ser/d-archiv-2003.htmlhttp://www.kornkreise.chhttp://www.heramagazine.nethttp://www.cropcirclenews.comhttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmhttp://www.bltresearch.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
