Aerialphotograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson.November 1, 2003 West Union, Ohio - This week, crop circle investigatorsJeffrey Wilson, Roger Sugden, Ted Robertson, Delsey and Tony Knoechelmanand several others went to see yet another crop formation in soybeans south ofthe Serpent Mound and Seip Mound where other soybean formations werefound in August and September this year. This latest one was a little south ofWest Union on Route 41.The farmer and residents near the field thought the pattern first appeared in the soybeans inlateSeptember or early October.

Perhaps to avoid controversialpublicity, no one had reported it early on. The farmer said he had not seentracks or paths around the formation before the investigators began their workon the weekend of October 25-26. I asked Jeff Wilson how he compared thismonth-old formation with the other significant and mysterious soybeanformations earlier this year near the ancient Serpent Mound in Locust Grove,Ohio, and the Seip Mound in Bainbridge.Interview:Jeffrey Wilson, Independent Crop Formation Investigator, Master'sDegree in General Science, Dexter, Michigan: \"This was quite a puzzle to uswhen we arrived on the scene for a couple of reasons. First, there have been veryfew crop circle formations in soybeans ever recorded in the U. S. And of those,few had been studied very well. This is the first one that we've looked at this latein the season where the soybean plants are dried out and ready for harvest. Allthe dry branches and leaves fall off and leave just the stem of the plant and theseed pods of the soybeans themselves. So, these West Union soybean plantswere quite different than what we had seen in the previous formations at SerpentMound (Locust Grove) and Paint Creek (Bainbridge). We do not have enoughevidence to conclude one way or the other that the formation is authentic or thatit was hoaxed.Ringed circle in dry soybean formation at West Union, Ohio.Investigators arrived in the rain on the weekend of October 25-26, 2003.Photograph © 2003 by Delsey Knoechelman and Jeffrey Wilson.Also, we believe after talking with residents who live near the field that it camedown three to four weeks previous either last week of September or first days ofOctober. The formation had been down before there had been any frosts andthere have been several frosts there. Plant AnomaliesEight Green Plants Among Dry BrownWHAT DID YOU FIND IN THE FORMATION THAT YOU THOUGHTMIGHT BE IN THE MYSTERIOUS CATEGORY?Although the field is dry and ripe for harvest, we were really surprised todiscover eight stalks scattered in different places in the circles that were stillgreen and alive and that had kept their branches and leaves. These wereflattened right down with all the rest of the plants that are now dry and dead. Tobe honest with you, we are really puzzled about how this could be the case thislate in the season and having these eight plants manage to somehow survive thefrost and the lateness of the year. This is just really a puzzle. We don'tunderstand that at all."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Jeffrey Wilson in West Union formation finding one of the eightgreen soybean plants amid the dry, brown plants ready for harvest.Photograph © 2003 by Delsey Knoechelman.Close-up, one of eight green soybean plants discovered by Tony Knoechelmanin West Union formation.

Photograph © 2003 byJeffrey Wilson.Larger Seeds in Circle's Upright PlantsI UNDERSTAND THAT TONY KNOECHELMAN FOUND SEEDS IN THEDOWNED PLANTS OF THE FLATTENED CIRCLES THAT WERE LARGERTHAN OTHER SEEDS IN THE FORMATION?Tony Knoechelman was in the largest circle and he was picking off some of theseed pods from different plants. One of the things that struck us right away isthat where all the flattened plants were, there is a significant percentage thatsprang back up. The crop formation was there a long enough time for some"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"phototropism (plants rising back up toward the sun after having been blowndown or pushed to the ground) to occur. So, there were a lot of stems that werestanding back up. Tony took seed pods from those, opened them up and lookedat the seeds and compared them to the sizes of the seeds that he had pulled fromthe plants flattened and laying on the ground.In the largest circle, phototropism apparently caused some soybean plantsto rise back toward the sun, implying the plants had not been broken when the formationwas created. Also, seeds on the standing plants appeared larger than seeds in theflattened plants. Cause is unknown. Photograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson.What he found was that the seeds laying flattened on the ground weresignificantly larger than the ones he had pulled from the standing plants insidethe circles. That was a field observation, so we don't know if that holdsstatistically throughout the whole formation. We did sample upright stems in thecircles and we're going to compare them to the ones flattened and to normalcontrol plants that grew outside the formation. Normal Soybean Fuzz Missing On One Side of Standing CropWHAT OTHER PLANT ANOMALIES DID YOU FIND?Soybean plants have a short fuzz that runs the length of the plant from tip to tip.But in this formation, the side of the plants upright (from phototropism?) in theformation that faced the direction of the flow (counterclockwise), that side didnot have the fuzz. The hairs were all missing on that down-facing side of thesoybean stalks, tip to tip.Normal soybean fuzz missing on one side of standing crop.Photograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson.This struck us as unusual because if you were going to hoax a formation and usethe typical methods of boards or a garden roller, you would have impact orscraping marks from the boards that removed only small sections of those hairs.But you wouldn't mechanically remove it from tip to tip. But we're not sure ifthat could be due to a weathering process. We don't think so because it showedit only on the up right plants and their sides facing the direction of the flow."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"That was anomalous.The other find was that sometimes you find upright stalks in authenticformations in which all of the surrounding plants have flowed around thestanding stalks. It's a kind of subtle detail that many people miss, but the plantsflow around the standing plants.In this West Union case, the plants did not flow around the standing stalks, butthe plants had been flattened at one time and had come back up. (Phototropismis assumed.) What makes that kind of significant is that all of those plants musthave been flattened at one point and were not broken. So, there is a significantpercentage of the plants that were not snapped or broken. If you try to bendover soybean plants, it's like trying to snap a celery stalk. Try to make a bend inthe celery stalk. They break very easily.The fact that forty to fifty feet areas of crop were flattened and not broken,making it possible for some of the soybean plants to spring back up, I think, isunusual. Unusual Humming Sound in the Soybean FieldDID YOU TALK WITH ANY OF THOSE PEOPLE IN THE HOUSE ON THEHILL OR OTHERS ABOUT WHETHER THEY SAW OR HEARD ANYTHINGUNUSUAL THREE OR FOUR WEEKS AGO?We talked with a number of people in the area, not just the people on the hill.But the only person who reported anything unusual was the farmer's wife whomentioned that she woke up about three weeks ago in the middle of the nightand heard a low, mechanical humming sound coming from the field. But thatwas after the formation was there. She said the sound came about a week afterthe formation had been there.The sound that she described was exactly the same kind of sound that the landowner described hearing in association with the Bainbridge Paint Creek islandformation. See 10/5/03 Earthfiles. Alignment of 2003 Ohio FormationsI ALSO MARKED ON A MAP AS I HAVE BEEN MARKING THE SERPENTMOUND AND SEIP MOUND FORMATIONS IN OHIO. WHEN YOU MARKWEST UNION, YOU REALIZE IT IS ALMOST A STRAIGHT LINE GOINGNORTHEAST THROUGH THE STATE OF OHIO AND THE 2003 SOYBEANFORMATIONS HAVE EITHER BEEN ON OR AT THE SIDE OF THAT LINE."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The four 2003 soybean formations at West Union, Serpent Mound,and Seip Mound are on an alignment with the Chillicothe and Newark Octagon earthmounds.Yes. And if you happen to extend that line southward into Kentucky, you'll alsocome very close to a crop formation that was reported back in May inFlemingsburg, Kentucky. It falls pretty much on the same line. So, you havefrom Flemingsburg, Kentucky, going northeast to West Union, going northeast toSerpent Mound, going northeast to Bainbridge. They are all pretty much on thesame line.HAVE YOU TALKED WITH ANYONE WHO STUDIES THE EARTHMOUND WORKS OR THE HISTORY OF NATIVE AMERICANS OROTHERS IN OHIO. WHAT DO THEY THINK ABOUT THIS PARTICULARLINE ORIENTATION THROUGH THESE GEOGRAPHICAL SPOTS?There have been numerous speculations about why this could be the case. If youwant to relate it to something known archaeologically, there was a road that isnow known as the Great Hopewell Road that extended from Chilicothe, Ohio toNewark, Ohio, where the Great Octagon is. That road was 60 miles in length andperfectly straight. Recently, the Ohio Historical Society has put together adocumentary showing evidence for this road.In talking with some of the Native Americans in the area, their hypothesis is thatthese formations might be marking out a shift in the Great Hopewell Road,which they consider to be a sacred line that was laid out in the ancient past. Ifthere is a shift in the line, it now needs to be remarked. That's what is theirinterpretation. Native Americans See \"Medicine Shield\" andMedicine Drum\" in West Union Soybean Formation"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Upper large circle and two rings: \"medicine drum.\"Lower ring, lines and three circles: \"medicine shield.\"Aerial photograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson.Regarding the West Union formation, Native Americans have said that it looksvery stylized in terms of the kinds of hieroglyphics that the Native Americanshad used in the area. Some looked at the formation and said one part was like a'medicine shield' and one part was like the 'medicine drum.'COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHICH IS WHICH?The circle with the ring and three line extensions from it is what the NativeAmericans consider to be the medicine shield. The circle that overlaps the tworings is what they consider to be the medicine drum.IT'S ALMOST LIKE SOME OF THE EARLY PICTOGRAMS IN ENGLAND.Yes, and I seem to recall a couple of formations that came down in Wisconsin afew years ago one near Port Washington, Wisconsin.1998 Port Washington, Wisconsin, pictogram in barley.Aerial photograph © 1998 by Jeffrey Wilson.The other was near Verona, Wisconsin. Both of those formations looked verysimilar to this West Union one, but the other patterns were in barley. They hadthe same kind of rough appearance and similar design. So I've seen this a coupleof times, but this new formation is unique. There might be elements of the samestyle, but it's definitely different.1999 Verona, Wisconsin, ring pattern in barley.Aerial photograph © 1999 by Jeffrey Wilson.Great Hopewell Road"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Over ten thousand ancient mounds and earthworks once dotted the Ohio Valleywhich include the Serpent Mound, Seip Mound and a perfectly straight road 60miles long called the Great Hopewell Road that extended from Chilicothe toNewark, Ohio along the same alignment that now stands out on my map of cropformations in Ohio in 2003. The ancient Earthworks of the Ohio Valleyastonished European and American explorers in the late 1700s.Now, it appears the Ohio Valley is joining England, Germany and otherEuropean countries as a place where truly mysterious crop formations haveoccurred in or near ancient sacred sites. As I wrote in my book, MysteriousLights and Crop Circles, could crop formations be connected to the sameancient intelligence which inspired other marks around the world in ziggurats,pyramids, stone circles and earth mounds?If so, we should continue to see patterns emerge in the crop fields around theOhio Valley earth works. But always there is the question: what is the reason forthe formations? Is the phenomenon here to stay? Or will it end one day in a finalseason of worldwide patterns as mysteriously as it began, without explanationand the haunting feeling that Something in another order of intelligence passedamong us for reasons unknown.More Information:Upper circle flattened in soybeans was 45 feet 4 inches in diameter.All the other rings and flattened circles were about 28 feet in diameter.Diagram © 2003 by Ted Robertson.We b s it e :http://www.cropcirclenews.com/http://greatserpentmound.org/features/romain_octagon_threatened.htmlhttp://greatserpentmound.org/articles/giants.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Refund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
