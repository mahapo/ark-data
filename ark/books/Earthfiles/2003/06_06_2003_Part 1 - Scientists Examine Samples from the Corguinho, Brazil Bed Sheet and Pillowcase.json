The original event was around 7:30 p.m. on September 15,2002,when Urandir says he was transported in a violet beam from the bed through the ceiling andinto an \"extraterrestrial craft\" at the same time that a \"rain of rocks\" came downon his farm. Photograph © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe.June 6, 2003 Grass Lake, Michigan - I first sent samples of the cloth, woodand stone samples I collected in Corguinho, Brazil in February to biophysicistW. C. Levengood for initial study and photomicrographs. See: 03-15-03Earthfiles. He in turn asked analytical chemist, Phyllis A. Budinger, Owner,Frontier Analysis, Ltd., Chagrin Falls, Ohio, to do infrared studies on smallpieces of the samples. Phyllis did not find any \"unusual residues\" on the clothsamples in her infrared studies. But Phyllis wanted to see some larger pieces ofthe bed sheet samples. On March 2, 2003, I sent Samples 1 (right leg), Sample 6(pillowcase), sample of normal control bed sheet, two of the disc-shaped stonesfrom the September 15, 2002, \"rain of rocks\" and a common Corguinho rock forcomparison.I learned from Phyllis that the blue threads in the bed sheet are dyed cotton andthe white threads are polyester (polyethylene terephthalate), PET. The blue andwhite threads are cross woven together throughout the sheet. Phyllis's infraredstudy indicated that the pillowcase was also cross woven cotton and polyester.Samples collected beneath the bed sheet were a beige-colored polyester thatencased a thin, foam rubber mattress pad.Cotton decomposes, or scorches, at about 148 degrees Centigrade (300 degreesFahrenheit). But polyester threads don't melt until about 500 degrees F. Thedarker blue of the body pattern on the bed sheet that looks wet is where thepolyester threads melted. Phyllis calls those \"halo-like areas.\" The meltedpolyester threads are intricately woven throughout the blue cotton threads evenwhere the cotton is unaffected and not scorched or even brown. How can this beif polyester is supposed to melt at a temperature 200 degrees hotter than cottonis expected to scorch?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Phyllis Budinger wrote in her final April 22, 2003, analysis report: \"This can beexplained by the differences in rates of heat conduction (Thermal Conductivity)of these materials.\" PET (0.28 W/m*K) conducts heat about ten times fasterthan cotton (0.029W/m*K). Therefore, a fast burst of heat (above the meltingpoint of PET) would melt the PET, but not degrade the cotton. This wasexperimentally accomplished with an iron on the control sheet swath by thislaboratory\" in which a thermocouple was placed between the soleplate andTeflon iron cover to record the temperature range which was between 235-260degrees Centigrade, which is near the 500 degrees F. melting temperature forpolyester.The assumption that \"PET conducts heat about ten times faster than cotton\" isdisputed further below by the director of a major textile research lab. Further,biophysicist Levengood noted that Phyllis's iron experiment on pieces of theCorguinho bed sheet did not look the same on the reverse side of the Corguinhobed sheet. However, in the actual anomalous bed sheet, the polyester in thebody pattern is melted the same way on both sides of the fabric. Hot Iron Experiment Flattens Melted Polyester Threads. Corguinho Bed SheetPolyester Not Flattened.From her iron experiment, Phyllis showed on page 13 of her report threephotographs at 3 seconds, 4 seconds and 10 seconds which she says resemblethe halo-like areas on the Corguinho bed sheet. But in her experiment, themelted polyester cross woven with the cotton is flattened out in herphotographs.Page 13, Phyllis Budinger's report about her experiment with \"a hot ironat its highest setting\" applied to control samples of the Corguinho bed sheet for 3, 4 and10 seconds. The pressure of the iron has flattened the melted polyester.Photomicrographs by Phyllis A. Budinger.Compare Phyllis's flattened polyester threads above to the 40Xphotomicrograph below taken of the original Corguinho bed sheet Sample 1 bybiophysicist W. C. Levengood.

Levengood.Soldering Iron Experiment Does Not Match Corguinho Bed SheetPhyllis also brought Nick Reiter, Owner, Avalon Foundation, Energy DispersiveSpectroscopy, Gibsonville, Ohio, into the investigation to do some EDS plots onthe Brazil round stones and to examine a piece of the bed sheet sample. In herreport, she included the supplied photomicrographs he supplied of hisexperiment with a soldering iron. Compare to a scorched section of thepillowcase below. The textiles expert from Philadelphia University's School ofTextiles and Materials Technology says in Part 2 that neither an iron nor asoldering iron nor any heated object that would come in physical contact withthe fabrics could produce the body pattern and explains why.Images of \"soldering iron experiment\" supplied by Nick Reiterin Phyllis Budinger's April 22, 2003, analysis report.Close-up scorched head area of pillowcase, Sample 6 region.Photograph © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe. While the above work was ongoing, I talked with some textile researchers whowanted to see the entire bed sheet and pillowcase, if possible. I contactedUrandir Oliveira and asked if he would be willing to ship them to me and he did.Continued in Part 2.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"earthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
