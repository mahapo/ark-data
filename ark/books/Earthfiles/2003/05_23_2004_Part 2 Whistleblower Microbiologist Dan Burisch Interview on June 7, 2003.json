Photograph by BJ.Click here for Part 1 May 23, 2004 Las Vegas, Nevada - On June 7, 2003, Bill Hamilton - then ExecutiveDirector of Skywatch International - was given permission by microbiologist Dan Burisch,Ph.D., to interview Dr. Burisch on-the-record as a whistleblower in a videotaped sessionattended by five other researchers with their own videotape cameras. The subjects wereDan Burisch's 1994 work with the J-Rod entity at the S-4/5 underground laboratory, Area51, Nellis AFB, Nevada; the Doctrine for Converging Time Line Paradox (DCTP); andDan's concern about the future of this planet. Here is Part 2 of that June 7, 2003, videotaped interview in Las Vegas, reviewed andcorrected by Danny B Burisch, Ph.D. (His family says his middle initial has no period. Seebirth certificate in More Information below) In this section of the interview, questions wereasked by Bill Hamilton and the others. The questions are ALL CAPS without specifyingspecific questioner, except where specifically noted for Bill Hamilton.Interview:PART 2 - June 7, 2003 Transcript of Dan Burisch, Ph.D., InterviewVideotaped in Las Vegas, NevadaPreliminary comment before formal interview began.Dan B Burisch, Ph.D., Microbiologist IV, formerly Nevada Test Site, Area 50 Sector 2,Area 51 Sectors 3 and 4, Las Vegas, Nevada: \"We spoke about another person who had aheart condition. I figured it was a Need-To-Know basis above that. I didn't figure there wasdirect - the rumors coming at me about the potential for public acclimation that would befor him, those initials (person unnamed), to take back as the hero in this situation becausehe loves playing hero. You show me a piece of paper that says, 'Ordered to remain in thecapacity' which means there is a greater loop. I've had a chance to speak to the individualone time."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"BILL HAMILTON: AND I HAVE A RECORD OF THAT.I heard there is a transcript involving that which got out. In fact, I was shown it one timefrom the first meeting where I bolted, the one where you scared the hell out of me! Not asmuch as you did today (laughter). This is a more relaxed circumstance (here).(IN DOCUMENTS) I INFER THEIR (MJ-12) USE OF THE WORD 'BIRD' REFERS TOEBEs (extraterrestrial biological entities).Ye s .I INFER THAT THE USE OF THE WORD 'CLOCK' REFERS TO THE TIME LINEPARADOX.Yes, I would buy that.\" Part 2 of Interview Begins Here:\"WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE LOOKING AT WHEN YOULOOKED AT THE SLIDES OF THE J-ROD MATERIAL?We were looking at extremely minute microglial cells (pathologic sensors in the brain). Weknew that they were eukaryotic.\"(Editor's Note: Eukaryote cells contain specialized organelles and are found in all livingplants, animals and fungi. See More Information below.)Eukaryote cells contain specialized organelles and are found in all living plants, animals and fungi.(Editor's Note continued: Another type of cell is the prokaryotes that make up bacteria andother organisms that do not have special organelles. Prokaryotes are believed by some tohave preceded eukaryotic cells. But what caused the prokaryote cells to change to themuch more complicated eukaryote design is not understood.) Prokaryote cells are the basis for bacterial and other primordial microorganisms that allegedly came beforeeukaryote cells.Dan Burisch: \"However, the J-Rod cells were unusual in the sense that their cytoplasmand their internal organization, the organelle structures, were fused such as lysosome orperoxisome to mitochondria and things like that. We had no idea what we were looking at.The original contention made by individuals next to me was that we were looking at sometype of biological warfare material. They were intermediate (level) with more experience"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"than me involving such matters, so - and being that I was new - I was letting them take thelead. Entering the S-4 and 5 Level Clean Sphere \"Home\" of the J-RodTELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF PREPARINGFOR ENTRY INTO THE CLEAN SPHERE.Right. Well, we would undergo a medical examination, at least during the early time frameof the introductions of the 1991 to 1992 time frame when we were doing introductions. Wehad regular systematic medicals by physicians. Following that, we would be suited first,catheterized, plugged and suited. A communication apparatus was placed on our heads.There was a cooling system set up. For all intents and purposes, it was a space suit, a totalencapsulated suit something like what you would find in a NASA facility. Not so muchsomething you would see, for instance, at CDC (Centers for Disease Control)- not that typeof Level 4 suit. It was more a regular space-type suit with joints. We were suited up, wewere pressurized and then walked with our cooling system and our hosing down a rampinto the Ambassadorial Suite (where J-Rod kept). Following that, we were lead up a gantryway which had been moved into position by the Clean Sphere, which had been previouslyrotated up through an iris through the floor.He (J-Rod) was held actually below the Ambassadorial Suite level and that was raised up asneeded. What they did with him down there, he did not say. And they (bosses) did not tellme. It was not a need-to-know issue. Apparently that's where they dealt with the cleaningof the Sphere and all that down there. It was regular housed-animal maintenance, as theytreated him.We would be lead up the gantry way. The hoses would be hooked into an interior systeminside the doorway that was exterior to the Clean Sphere. And it was called 'Six DegreeSystem.'We would be lead in. The door would be closed and we would be pressurized inside of thegantry way. Following that, there was a drug system that was set up. Once there was anequal pressurization between the gantry way and the Clean Sphere, we would then be toldto proceed forward. I would raise a hand in acknowledgment. We were not supposed to talkat the time at all because nothing verbal around the specimen, around the J-Rod. Why? (noverbal) I was never told, but we were not supposed to talk around the J-Rod.I moved the drug system and re-hooked a secondary set of hosing inside the Clean Sphere,checked the pressurization and once that was done, the door to the Clean Sphere would beclosed behind me and I would presume that the pressurization remained the same in thegantry way.Following that I would do my business inside the Clean Sphere involving contact with theJ-Rod and removing the samples (from the J-Rod.) J-Rod's Neuropathy DiseaseWHAT WAS THE REASON YOU WERE REMOVING SAMPLES FROM THE J-ROD?We were removing samples to attempt a treatment, a full diagnosis and treatment for aparaprotein-related monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance type disorder whichhad various attributes to it.\"(Editor's Note from 1997 Leukemia Research Fund: The blood normally contains a largenumber of different proteins called the plasma proteins. One type of protein is calledgamma globulin and combines to make antibodies. Normally many different types ofgamma globulin are produced to deal with different infections. When most of the proteinbeing produced is one particular form of gamma globulin this is called monoclonalgammopathy. A clone is a population of cells which are all derived from one original cell.In monoclonal gammopathy all of the abnormal protein is identical proving that it camefrom cells of one clone (monoclonal). If there is no evidence of disease such as myelomaor lymphoma which would explain the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy it is calledmonoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). The clinical importance ofmonoclonal gammopathy in patients with no symptoms and no other signs of disease is notyet understood. In about 80% of people with MGUS the level of monoclonal protein is lowand the vast majority of these people will remain well and never have symptoms related toMGUS.)Dan Burisch: \"Among those were a Cockayne type presence to the J-Rod, Cockayne"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"syndrome type presence and certain genetic issues involving chromosome 5 and 17, whichlead us to Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT). CMT is a hereditary progressive neuromusculardisorder that primarily affects the feet, legs and hands and their glycoprotein problems.Essentially they were losing heat. They were not transmitting energy, something like adystrophy.Cockayne syndrome sufferers have multi-systemic disordersdue to a defect in the ability of cells to repair DNA thatis being transcribed. Photograph by D. Atherton.Because of the problems at their axons, there were difficulties of action potentialpropagation in Schwann cells and nodes of Ranviere. They were not transmitting energy,something like a dystrophy. When an action potential puts down axon, the action potentialswere dying at the synapses. They were also loosing energy because there was ademyelination of the myelin sheath protecting the nerve axon underway. Thatdemylenation process was well, since the Q-94 document was tied to a CMT 1a typeproblem like Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) called PMP22, which is a protein over 22 whichan over-expression of that gene causes a greater demylenation.We tied that to the demyelination issue involving the promoters for the PMP22. Those twopromoters for it were selectively deselected with the use of TFOs or \"Triplex Forming\"Oligonucleotides. It's essentially an SSBNA vector expression system that we are using.(Editor's Note about Oligonucleotides: sequence of a few - to many hundreds - ofnucleotides, linked with each other. An oligonucleotide thus corresponds to a (very) shortDNA single strand.)(Editor's Note from medical text about ssDNA: DNA cloning vectors combine the cloningand expression advantages of DNA plasmid (orcosmid) systems with the sequencing andmutagenesis advantages of single-strand phage systems. The pMEX vectors contain theColE1 origin of replication and the phage f1 intergenic region. Thus, genes and genebanks can be cloned, sequenced, mutagenized, and expressed in the same vector system.)Each nerve cell (ne uron) within the ganglion sends out a long, microscopically thin extension called an axon. The axon extends to larger body objects such as muscle and teeth. Individual axons combine within severallayersof connective tissue myelin sheaths to form larger nerve bundles. These in turn combine to form nerve trunks. Inhumanswhen myelin sheaths deteriorate and form plaques, such as in multiple sclerosis, paralysis can occur.BILL HAMILTON: \"DOESN'T THAT INTERFERE THE DEMYELINATION PROCESS -ISN'T THAT SIMILAR TO CONDITIONS THAT HUMANS SOMETIMES HAVE LIKEMUSCULAR DYSTROPHY AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS?Yes, except that he was not forming plaques. He was simply demyelinating, repairing thedemyelinating area with the immune system. They've got a cell-mediated immune systemjust like we have. The cells are different. They've got glycoproteins - very strange-lookingblood-like material. But that's why we use the term 'analog' so much because it wasdifferent."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" What was S-4 and 5, Area 51 Like?COULD YOU TELL ABOUT GENERALITIES AROUND THE BUILDING IN WHICHYOU WORKED? WHERE IT WAS AND HOW YOU GOT THERE?Sure. If you want to experience a Site 4, watch The Andromeda Strain (movie).\"(Editor's note with feature film summary: When a small space probe falls to earth in aremote village of New Mexico, all but two of the town's inhabitants--an infant and an oldalcoholic - meet death as their blood turns to powder. After two reconnaissance pilotshave also perished, a national state of emergency is declared. The two survivors and therecovered space probe are transported to a mammoth five-story underground laboratory,and a team of scientists swiftly brought to the lab to discover the nature of the deadlyorganism brought by the space probe. Through exhaustive tests, the team learns that theminute organism, dubbed the 'Andromeda Strain' (nearest large galaxy to Milky Way), isalien in nature, and the scientists must quickly find a cure before all of humanity is wipedout.)Dan Burisch: \"Except at the real S-4, there's a little more color. Out at Site-4, they've got anice orange stripe on the wall and they've got a red and blue stripe on the floor which givesyou general directions, depending upon the floor you're on and you can't move withoutgetting stopped anyway.Now we're talking separate from the Groom facility here. I'm aware of several floors at theGroom Lake facility and finally the majority of the hot stuff was taken over to Site 4. AtSite 4, we're talking four basic levels. The first level they are coded 4-1, 4-2, 4-3, 4-4 andfinally where he (J-Rod) was stored, it's 4-5. That 4-5 designation was painted on the wallfor him because 4 and 5 equals 9. That's in fact why they built nine hangars on the Galileoand Side Kick levels at the 4-1 level. The 4-2 level contained Looking Glass (Project),Alice's Glass. In fact, outside the door for the major facility, there is a White Rabbit with aclock it's a very large statue and it's wired above the doorway. Project Looking Glass (MJ-12) and the Physics of Time TravelThe Looking Glass Project I find out is related to one of the ERPs (Einstein, Rosen,Podolsky, also known as Einstein-Rosen Bridges, ERBs). It uses some kind of and this wasfound out just in the last two weeks it's composed of a spherical spinning arc rectangularsolid matrix of nickel, cadmium and barium. There is a spinning disk underneath it which issuper cooled. Into this is injected into the center of these spinning I'm not a physicist spinning disks is injected an argon gas. Into that is injected some type of repulsion matter gravity repulsion matter. They are obtaining the gravity repulsion matter from the heavymaterials that have been obtained from the J-Rods: Element 115 variety material.\"(Editor's Note: First referenced by Robert Lazar in 1990 after he worked at S-4 and Area51 to help figure out the gravity-controlled propulsion system of an alien spacecraft.)Photograph of what Robert Lazar referred to as a \"scout ship\" based on his workat S-4 at Area 51, Nellis AFB, Nevada from December 1989 until March 1990.

Why do you think the British are running around in Iraq right now looking for theclimatological records that just happened to disappear out of the Baghdad Museum with therest of the cylinder seals? I have done a report detailing information about those cylinderseals."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"SO, DAN, DOES THAT MEAN WHEN THEY ARE ENGAGING THIS DEVICE INPROJECT LOOKING GLASS, IS THIS SOMETHING THAT THEY USE ONLY FORTHE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION? OR CAN THEY TRANSPORT AMATERIAL OBJECT THROUGH TIME?You know the answer to that. At least you have probably heard some rumor. There havebeen mistakes. There were mistakes. Animals were attempted to transport from onelocation to another in the production of two of the devices and they put them in resonanceor something like that. I'm not a physicist. I don't know. But I was in fact present during ahuman account. The human did not survive. The human was not put in there under duressof any sort. It was a volunteer situation and the human did not survive. The human did notmove. The human stayed where the human was put. But the human changed and - I don'twant to talk about it anymore.IT WAS AN ATTEMPT AT TIME TRAVEL?In essence, yes. It was a linear, an attempt to transport an individual over a linear distancewhich I understand is the same thing as time travel. Distance is time. From what Iunderstand, they have only used it for information purposes. How they get the informationout of it, I have no clue. I don't know. What specific information, they've obtained? I onlyknow of one piece of information and that is why the rush is underway to get LOTUS doneby the 2005 (T-9 Treaty) deadline. In fact, this group of J-Rods that are not complying withthe wishes of the Committee and the wishes of the rest of the J-Rods and associatedbrothers (there is an effort) to put a clamp on them so they stop their influence within thepolitical structures of our government, including the financial structures. It is in fact theywho are slowing down the progress to stop picking up these little (Einstein Rosen ) gatesthat were put together and would be our downfall in 2012.

I would be very happy and relieved to feel as though I wasresponding to the elected government of the United States of America with what talentsGod has given me. I am responsible to the people of the United States of America. Thenature of the information to which I am privy is sensitive enough that the full disclosure ofthat information would have to be done in an appropriate location and under appropriatecircumstances. Certain military application information would have to be done in a closedsession for the national security.As I said to you at the Luxor (Hotel in Las Vegas), the Congress knows it is NOT in control.They know this is a wild train out of control and they want that control back. They are notstupid. They know there are things going on down the hall from them that they can'tfathom. They deserve to have that back in their hands because that's what they wereelected to do. And if we care at all about what's left of our Constitution, they deserve tohave that in their hands. Are we the masters of our destiny in our country? Aren't wesupposed to be? Yes, we're supposed to be. Dan Burisch's First Encounter with the J-Rod at S-4 and 5CAN YOU DESCRIBE IN DETAIL WHAT IT IS LIKE WHEN YOU SAW THE J-RODFOR THE FIRST TIME (IN THE CLEAN SPHERE)?My original feeling was that I was looking at a giant insect. That's the best I can do just offthe cuff. It looked like a giant insect, being dark brown and hunched over in the corner,very insectoid in appearance. It almost looked like it had an exoskeleton. I felt afraid insidebecause I was always told that monsters weren't real. And now I find out that they are, butthey live in the hearts of men. It was fear, excitement, complete astonishment. Honestly,(before other knowledge), I thought we were dealing with some kind of monkey, somethinglike an Old World ape. But indeed it wasn't. But that's what my feeling was (scared). I'mnot going to try to talk about how intellectual I was at the time about it. It scared the hell"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"out of me!WHEN DID YOU FIRST ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT THIS WAS A NON-HUMANBEING, EXTRATERRESTRIAL, SOMETHING OUT OF THIS WORLD?I'm trying to remember what I was feeling when I was looking at the briefing books becauseeven when I was first introduced to the J-Rod, they were hem hawing around as to itsorigin. His origin. (I thought), 'Poppycock!' I did not believe it. However, deep inside I heldopen a possibility because of what happened to me earlier in my life. I held open thepossibility that such things could be true. But it could not happen to me, that old, 'It can'thappen to you,' feeling. So, to me it was poppycock, rubbish until I found out otherwise. DTIC and \"King Tut\" Briefing Books About J-RodsCAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE BRIEFING BOOKS?Sure, (The J-Rod briefing books) were called 'King Tuts.' They were in blue binders and allwere labeled with the letter 'K.' They (also) had the letters 'DTIC\" on the front of them. (OnJune 7, 2003) I still don't know what those letters stand for. That was 1987, the end of1987, and I still don't know what the letters stand for. I haven't done independent searches.Can you tell me what DTIC means?BILL HAMILTON: I DON'T KNOW.\"(Editor's Note: Later Bill Hamilton learned DTIC stands for Defense Technical InformationCenter. The Defense Technical Information Center, DTIC, is the central facility for thecollection and dissemination of scientific and technical information for the Departmentof Defense (DoD). As an element of the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA),DTIC serves as a vital link in the transfer of information among DoD personnel, DoDcontractors and potential contractors and other U.S. Government agency personnel andtheir contractors.)Dan Burisch: \"Shocks me that you don't know either. They had a white-colored DTICprinted on the front of them (blue binders). They were marked with several sections,including physiology, general biology, social structure, political structure of the J-Rods,their origins, potential implications for interactions with humankind, cross-contaminationissues. They were full of as much information as I could take in during the times they wereallowing me to read them. I still don't know what that damned DTIC means.They were called 'King Tuts.' They were update books. This is another reason why I didn'tfigure how Steven how I could be promoted to a Working Group Leader above Steven. ButI found out and I told you why.RIGHT.At the time, I couldn't figure it out because he (Steven) kept the updates. He made sure thatall of the King Tuts were updated. He did the briefing films that are still resident at Site-4,or at least were on my last visit. So, the man of that importance, I could not figure out why(I would be promoted above him.) But again, that's mute now.WHAT DID THE DOCUMENTS SAY ABOUT THE J-RODS?Close-knit, very well ordered society, one which is numerologically based, one whichspeaks to others that were called 'Brothers.' I now find out they are those who left on aspiritual path to another location to the famed Duwat (heavenly domain) of Orion and theEpsilon Eridani area.Astronomy photograph of the Orion's Belt stars in lower left and the star Epsilon Eridani in the upper rightÂ© James B.

He can't sue me for that, I hope. But they (Santilli) weredisgusting.The Brookings Institution paper was present, as well as several position papers clarifyingthe Brookings Institute. However, each of these I was allowed into they had separatefolders and separate clips within them inside the 3-ring binders. I was told which numbers Iwas allowed to open up. They were given to me on a card and those were the ones I wasallowed to review during the times I was allowed to review them. Most of the stuff rangedfrom military applications, physics of the craft I could not have cared less (about thetechnology).I was more interested in taking in the biology issues. (The craft technology) just doesn'tinterest me, aside from the fact that I am interested in the biophysical interface between thehand, mind and craft. The beings have on their hands a number of pads. There are opennerves which are protected by various glycoproteins and those glycoproteins are selectivelypushed forward or sucked backwards via capillary action. Or they can be through an activefashion pulled back and it kind of pulls a viscous sheath back and allows the J-Rod to havedirect interface with the craft. That interested me, although most of it at the time and stillsome of it now, I have no understanding of. A lot of it has to do with electronics and I don'tpretend to understand.I was most interested in looking at issues involving their histology, histo-pathology issues,including some autopsy photographs that showed disease processes which were naturallyoccurring within them. Isolations of viral material to include new protocols which werebeing written as they were being worked, which is what we are doing. That's what we aredoing, writing new protocols as we are working forward. All of the old standbys are there:everything from electrofluoresis to anything. But we are writing new protocols as we aregoing because this is not new territory. This is, pardon the pun, alien territory.HOW MANY BEINGS HAVE WE (U. S. GOVERNMENT) HAD TO WORK WITH?I only met one. I am aware of possibly three from the reading. And at that time, I was sostunned by what I was doing, a lot of it was getting by me. When I read the word'extraterrestrial,\" I tunnel-visioned. When I finally believed and understood that it was infact an extraterrestrial (I was) numb, numb.\"Continued in Part 3.More Information:Cockayne SyndromeCockayne syndrome is a rare inherited disorder in which people are sensitive to sunlight,have short stature, and have the appearance of premature aging. In the classical form ofCockayne syndrome (Type I), the symptoms are progressive and typically become apparentafter the age of 1 year. An early onset or congenital form of Cockayne syndrome (Type II)is apparent at birth. Interestingly, unlike other DNA repair diseases, Cockayne syndrome isnot linked to cancer.After exposure to UV radiation (found in sunlight), people with Cockayne syndrome can nolonger perform a certain type of DNA repair, known as \"transcription-coupled repair.\" Thistype of DNA repair occurs \"on the fly\" right as the DNA that codes for proteins is beingreplicated. Two genes defective in Cockayne syndrome, CSA and CSB, have beenidentified so far. The CSA gene is found on chromosome 5. Both genes code for proteinsthat interacts with components of the transcriptional machinery and with DNA repairproteins.Escherichia coli, a bacterium, also undergoes transcription-coupled repair, and a yeastcounterpart of the CSB gene has also recently been discovered. These similar mechanismsto the one found in humans are invaluable for studying the molecular processes involved intranscription-coupled repair because powerful molecular genetics techniques can be used.A better understanding of the mechanisms involved will help unravel the pathogenesis ofdisease and may identify potential drug targets. Charcot-Marie-ToothCharcot-Marie-Tooth is a hereditary progressive nerve disorder. The most common formsof CMT disease cause demyelination of the myelin sheath protecting the nerve axon of theperoneal nerve. CMT type 2, the neuronal form of the disease, affects the nerve axon. The"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"nerve deteriorates causes wasting of muscles, loss of sensation, and claw foot. The severityof the disease ranges from unnoticeable even by the individual affected, to wheelchairbound. The amount of deterioration varies substantially, even within a single family. CMTis not a single disease, but a collection of diseases caused by defects in different genes.CMT can be inherited in a number of different patterns: autosomal dominant, autosomalrecessive or X linked. The dominant form is the most common.CMT is referred to as Charcot-Marie disease and Peroneal Muscular Atrophy. And CMT isincluded in the more general term Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy (HMSN) (seethe MD Australia Fact Sheet for more discussion). One name is not used consistentlyeverywhere even today. In addition, the forms of the disease that are included in thedefinition of CMT, has changed over the years. New forms were identified in 1994 (refer tothe genome database on-line). Black Holes and Einstein Rosen BridgesIn 1963, the New Zealand mathematician, Roy Kerr, found that if a black hole is rotating asingularity still forms, but in the form of a ring, not a point. It was believed that in principlea particle may be able to fall towards the singularity but if at some point it moved throughthe hole instead of the ring the particle may not be lost forever. When this was publishedblack holes were not believed to exist and therefore the Kerr solution only really developedin the 1970s, after astronomers discovered what seem to be real black holes.Unfortunately, more modern work published in late August 1998 by Piran and Shahar Hodhas seemingly ended this idea. They used complex computer simulations to study how anelectrically charged black hole might form and how the singularity would behave. It wasthe first time that a single computer program has simulated these two processes at once.They showed that a process known as \"mass inflation\" violated the Kerr hypothesis. Whena particle moves towards the black hole, the apparent mass of the hole increases to infinityas observed by the object. (Physical Review Letters, vol 81, p 1554). \"This singularity goesthrough the entire system,\" says Piran. \"It doesn't leave any hole through which matter maypass.\"New Scientist, September 5, 1998: \"The use of black holes as objects that may aidinterstellar travel was to be included in a novel called Contact. While writing the novel in1985, Carl Sagan turned to for advice to Kip Thorne, at CalTech. Sagan wanted a methodof moving a character faster than light, though not in a manner violating the Theory ofRelativity. Thorne set two of his PhD students, Michael Morris and Ulvi Yurtsever, the taskof working out some details of the physical behaviour of 'wormholes.' This story oftenappears to attribute the discovery of wormholes to Thorne or Sagan.\"In fact, they were investigated almost as soon as Einstein published General Relativity, farbefore black holes were established to exist. As early as 1916, less than a year afterEinstein had formulated his equations of the general theory, Austrian Ludwig Flamm hadrealized that Schwarzschild's solution to Einstein's equations actually describes a wormholeconnecting two regions of flat spacetime; two universes, or two parts of the sameuniverse.\"Continued in Part 3.More Information:See these previous Earthfiles.com reports:Â·Â· 06/08/2004 -- Part 3: Whistleblower Microbiologist Dan Burisch Interview on June7, 2003Â· 05/23/2004 -- Part 2: Whistleblower Microbiologist Dan Burisch Interview on June7, 2003Â· 05/19/2004 -- Part 1: Whistleblower Microbiologist Dan Burisch Interview on June7, 2003Â· 04/26/2004 -- Update About Microbiologist Dan Burisch, Ph.D.Â· 03/17/2004 -- Part 2 - \"Horrible Secret\" in UFO Crash Retrievals Near Roswell,New Mexico, in July 1947?Â· 11/19/2003 -- Updated - 1954 Manual: \"Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology\" -Reasons It Is AuthenticÂ· 09/15/2003 -- Part 3 - Whistleblower Microbiologist Speaks Out About Alleged\"Alien\" Named J-RodÂ· 09/15/2003 -- Part 2 - Whistleblower Microbiologist Speaks Out About Alleged\"Alien\" Named J-Rod"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Â· 09/15/2003 -- Part 1 - Whistleblower Microbiologist Speaks Out About Alleged\"Alien\" Named J-RodÂ· 10/05/2002 -- Part 2 - J-Rod and Microbiologist Danny B Burisch, Ph.D.Â· 10/05/2002 -- Part 1 - Two Scientists Describe An Extraterrestrial Biological EntityCalled \"J-Rod\"Â· 10/05/2002 -- Part 3 - More Background On the Scientists Linked To \"J-Rod\"Â· 06/22/1999 -- The Strange Story of J-Rod, An EBEWebsites:Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC)Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
