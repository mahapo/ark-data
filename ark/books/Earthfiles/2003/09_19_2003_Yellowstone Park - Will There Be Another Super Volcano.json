The Norris geothermal region marked with a redstar hasperiodically had sections closed because of intense heating from below ground.Graphic courtesy the U. S. Geological Service. September 19, 2003 Menlo Park, California - In the past three weeks since Ireported about potential threats of volcanic activity in the Pacific Northwest andchanges in hydrothermal activity in Yellowstone Park, internet chat rooms havebeen buzzing about the idea of a \"Super Volcano\" erupting in Yellowstone.Excerpts from one e-mailer at rumormillnews.com said: \"Yellowstone is worsethan we thought. ...there is a large dead zone of animals and vegetation. ...Newgeysers and mud pots are springing up daily. ...They have closed more areas tothe public than is being reported. There are several areas where the groundtemperature tops 200 degrees. And earthquakes are becoming a dailyoccurrence.\" People are asking if all the increased heating could be the preludeto a \"Super Volcano?\"I went back to the United States Geological Survey office in Menlo Park,California, where Jacob Lowenstern, Ph.D., is the Scientist-In-Charge of theYellowstone Volcano Observatory. He and I had talked at the end of Augustabout changes this summer in the Norris geothermal system at Yellowstone inwhich some trails were closed because surface temperatures exceeded 200degrees Fahrenheit due to increased boiling water bubbling up from below. Thisweek, I read the e-mail to him and asked if there was any continuing evidence ofincreasing pressures and temperatures at Yellowstone Park.Jacob Lowenstern, Ph.D., Scientist-In-Charge, Yellowstone VolcanoObservatory, U. S. Geological Survey, Menlo Park, California: \"There aretwo different press releases by the National Park Service about the Norrisgeothermal system. There were some changes. There is an area with some deadtrees. I don't think I saw any dead animals when I was there. It's not changing atthis time. It changed in July and has pretty much stayed the same ever since."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Norris Geyser Basin, Yellowstone National Park.Photograph courtesy USGS.There was increased boiling that sort of spread onto the area where the trail is sothe ground temperatures are very high in some areas. There has been release ofthermal water up to the surface in some areas. So there are a few new featuresand once again, those features formed in late July and they haven't changedsince then.IS IT THE HOT WATER THAT'S BOILING TO THE SURFACE IN MUDTHAT IS KILLING THE TREES?Yes, there is increased flow of hot water from the underground to the surface. it'sactually increased heat. There is more boiling than normal. The actual amountof flow of water out of the ground, we don't know if that has increased. Itprobably has not.WHAT ABOUT EARTHQUAKES BECOMING A DAILY OCCURRENCE?Seismic events, earthquakes at Yellowstone, are lower than normal at this timeand have been for a couple of months. Yellowstone has a lot of very smallearthquakes. It's an active area. But again, there's no indication that things havechanged or increased in the last few weeks to few months.WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON A CONCEPT THAT IS BEING KICKEDAROUND ON THE INTERNET OF A POTENTIAL SUPER VOLCANOERUPTING IN YELLOWSTONE?Could Yellowstone Erupt Again?The periodicity of super volcanic eruptions at Yellowstonehave been 2 million years ago; 1.3 million years ago; and 630,000 years ago.Graphic courtesy U. S. Geological Survey.The Yellowstone area has been host to some of the largest volcanic eruptions onearth. They were a long time ago. There have been about three of them, and themost recent one was 640,000 years ago. Since that time, there have been about30 more eruptions, most of them much smaller, and causing much less potentialdamage than the so-called super volcano event.It's always possible that there can be more volcanic activity at Yellowstone andthat's why there is a Yellowstone Volcano Observatory. But the probability thatthat event is going to happen any time soon is exceedingly small. There is no"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"reason to believe at this time that there is any heightened chance of a volcaniceruption at Yellowstone.Hawaiian magma eruption. Photograph by J.D. Griggs.WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A NORMAL VOLCANO AND ASUPER VOLCANO?I think what they mean is that the amount of magma that leaves the volcanoduring the eruption is much, much larger than a typical volcanic eruption suchas in Hawaii or Mount St. Helens, or some of the ones we've seen over the pastfew decades.(Super volcanoes) are really large events and they form what we call calderaswhere the ground actually sinks down because there is so much magma removedfrom beneath the ground and there's a big hole that is left. The one atYellowstone is on the order of 40 miles across.HOW DEEP?It would be a few thousand feet.A FEW THOUSAND FEET DEEP?Yes. Similar to what you can see at Crater Lake, Oregon, but on a larger scale.That sort of thing does happen. There are several similar kinds of calderasystems around the world. Yellowstone is not the only one. These events dohappen, but they are very infrequent.IF I'M UNDERSTANDING, THERE WOULD BE A GIGANTIC ERUPTIONOF MAGMA AND THE WHOLE LAND 50 MILES ACROSS SANK?That's right.IF THAT HAPPENED AGAIN TODAY, WOULD THE SAME AREA THATSUNK, SINK LOWER?Possibly. We don't know exactly what area would be the location for thecaldera. It would be somewhere in and around Yellowstone, if it happened atYellowstone. But again, it's a very remote possibility that this will happen anytime soon, if ever.IF THERE WAS A SUPER VOLCANO AND ALL OF THIS MAGMA BEGANERUPTING, WOULD THERE BE A GIGANTIC SOUND ASSOCIATED WITHALL THIS?Yes, I'm sure you would hear it from hundreds of miles away.WHAT WOULD PEOPLE BE HEARING?They would be hearing explosions essentially.EXPLOSIONS FROM THE EARTH SPEWING OUT THE MAGMA?That's right.WHEN YOU SAY HUNDREDS OF MILES, THINKING OF WYOMING,WOULD PEOPLE IN SAY WASHINGTON STATE ON THE WEST ANDHOW FAR EAST WOULD PEOPLE HEAR?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I'm not an expert and couldn't tell you how far people could hear it.IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE IN OUR GEOLOGICAL STUDIES TO SUGGESTWHAT THE FREQUENCY MIGHT BE OF A SUPER VOLCANO LIKE THISIN YELLOWSTONE?Well, there have been three of them and they occurred 2 million years ago;around 1.2 million years ago; and around 640,000 years ago. so, they'veoccurred on the order of every 600,000 to 700,000 years. But there is no reasonfor us to know that that means anything or that conditions have not stayed wedon't know they are going to occur that often every time.BUT IF IT DID, THEN WE WOULD START BEING IN THE WINDOW OFTIME IN WHICH THERE COULD BE ANOTHER SUPER VOLCANICEVENT?If it did.WE WOULD BE IN SUCH A WINDOW?Within 100,000 years or so. Again, these things don't happen very often. Humancivilization has never seen one in historic times, but even far longer than that.IN SUMMARY, THESE REPORTS THAT ARE BEING SPREAD ONRUMORMILLNEWS.COM AND OTHERS ABOUT A SUPER VOLCANOGETTING READY TO BLOW UP IN YELLOWSTONE PARK WHAT'S YOURBOTTOM LINE RESPONSE?Most of it is trying to sort of excite people without using facts.\"Dr. Lowenstern says that he is confident that the U. S. Geological Survey hasenough seismic and other monitors spread throughout Yellowstone Park to giveplenty of warning about major seismic and temperature changes.We b s it e :http://www.solcomhouse.com/yellowstone.htmhttp://volcanoes.usgs.gov/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
