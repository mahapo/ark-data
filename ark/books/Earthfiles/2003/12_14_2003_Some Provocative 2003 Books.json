Each of the book titles islinked to a distributor. Just click to connect. The Book: Hidden Meanings: A Study of the Founding Symbols ofCivilization The mythology of the African Dogon tribe of Mali - which had detailedknowledge from some unknown source about the binary star system Sirius A andB - describes how their one true god, Amma, created all of the matter of theuniverse. But the system defined by these tribal myths, Laird Scrantonpostulates, bears a striking resemblance to the actual scientific structure ofmatter, starting with the atom and continuing all the way down to the vibratingthreads of string theory. Moreover, many of the Dogon words, symbols andrituals used to describe this structure are a close match for those found in themyths of ancient Egypt and in the daily rituals of Judaism. Hidden Meanings presents a side-by-side comparison of Dogon descriptionsand drawings with matching scientific diagrams and definitions fromastrophysicists such as Stephen Hawking and Brian Greene, then traces thesesymbols to their ancient Egyptian and Judaic counterparts. What is ultimatelyrevealed is a scientific basis for theEgyptian hieroglyphic language - perhaps deliberately encoded more than 5000years ago, and hidden from all but the most knowledgeable Egyptian priests.Along the way, it presents compelling new explanations for many of the mostfamiliar Egyptian symbols, such as the pyramid, the benben stone, and thescarab, along with new derivations for words used in Judaism and Christianity,such as Adonai, Yahweh/Jehovah, and even the origin of the name Satan. The Author: Laird Scranton \"By profession, I am a software consultant who specializes in writing customcomputer programs for businesses. What this means in terms of my daily job isthat I am paid to interpret, understand and maintain old computer programs andto design and write new programs for a wide variety of companies. Theprofessional skill set which I have acquired while performing my job may seemdistantly removed from the study of ancient religious symbols, since my job is"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"sometimes a highly technical one and ancient religions would appear bydefinition to be inherently primitive. In fact, if you believe that the stories andsymbols of the most ancient religions evolved without intentional design overmany hundreds or thousands of years, then it is debatable whether myprofessional skills would have any bearing at all on the subject. On the otherhand, if you imagine for a moment that any given religious symbol such as acharacter that forms a hieroglyphic word were specifically chose to represent itsmeaning, then my software design skills start to come into play. The reason isthat one of the most common tasks while writing a computer program involvesthe deliberate selection of symbols to represent concepts.\" The Book: Human Devolution: A Vedic Alternative to Darwin's Theory In their controversial bestseller Forbidden Archeology, Michael A. Cremo andRichard L. Thompson documented evidence showing that humans - or somekind of humanoid - have existed on earth for hundreds of millions of years. Suchanomalous evidence, contradicting Darwinian evolution, catalyzed a globalinquiry: \"If we did not evolve from apes, then where did we come from?\" Human Devolution is Michael A. Cremo's definitive answer to that question:\"We did not evolve up from matter; instead, we devolved, or came down, fromthe realm of pure consciousness, spirit.\" Basing his response on modern scienceand the world's great wisdom traditions, including the Vedic philosophy ofancient India, Cremo proposes that before we ask the question, \"Where didhuman beings come from?\" we should first contemplate, \"What is a humanbeing?\" for much of the 20th century, most scientists assumed that a human being issimply a combination of ordinary physical elements. In Human Devolution,Cremo says it is more reasonable to assume that a human being is a combinationof three distinct substances: matter, mind and consciousness (or spirit). Heshows how solid scientific evidence for a subtle mind element and a consciousself that can exist apart from the body have been systematically eliminated frommainstream science by a process of knowledge filtration. The Author: Michael A. Cremo Cremo is a research associate of the Bhaktivedanta Institute, specializing in thehistory and philosophy of science. He is a member of the World ArcheologicalCongress, the European Association of Archeologists, the History of ScienceSociety and the Philosophy of Science Association. \"I am not unhappy that Human Devolution appeared after ForbiddenArcheology rather than along with it. Before presenting an alternative to theDarwinian concept of human origins, it is reasonable to show that one is reallynecessary. I have therefore welcomed the chance to introduce to scientists andother scholars the evidence in Forbidden Archeology before moving on tosystematically presenting an alternative. After hearing the ForbiddenArcheology presentations, many ask, \"If we did not evolve from the apes, thenwhat alternative explanation do you propose?\" To them, I reply, 'Do you admit a"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"new explanation is required? If not, I have more work to do in showing that oneis required. And if you do admit that a new explanation is really required, then itis not just my responsibility to come up with a new explanation. It is also yourresponsibility. We should all be thinking about this.'\" The Book: Lost Secrets of the Sacred Ark, Amazing Revelations of theIncredible Power of Gold The sacred Ark of the Covenant, created from a legendary substance, is thesource of one of the deepest mysteries of the Western world. No reason is givenin the Bible as to why the Ark of the Covenant was so richly contrived, and noexplanation exists of its alleged awesome and deadly powers. What was the Arkof the Covenant? Where is it today? By accessing Rosicrucian archives in liaisonwith eminent nuclear physicist, Laurence Gardner reveals how this lost secret ofthe distant past has led to the phenomenal new science of space-timemanipulation. The Egyptian Book of the Dead refers to a mysterious parallel dimension ofspace-time associated with a magical powder of projection. Quantum physicistshave now discovered this powder to be superconductive monatomic gold. Thisamazing substance was the secret of the pharaohs' rite of passage to the Afterlife,and was directly associated with the pyramids and the biblical Ark of theCovenant. In Alexandria it became known as the Philosopher's Stone, while intoday's corridors of quantum mechanics, its attributes are classified as 'the mostremarkable physical property in the universe' (exotic matter). From the tombs of pharaonic Egypt, to the laboratories of modern science,comes this extraordinary account of gravity defiance and teleportation in theancient world and amazing revelations about the past power and futuresignificance of the sacred Ark. The Author: Sir Laurence Gardner Laurence Gardner, a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, is aconstitutional historian, lecturer and broadcaster. Distinguished as the Chevalierde St. Germain, he is attached to the European Council of Princes (aconstitutional advisory body established in 1946) as the JacobiteHistoriographer Royal. In the artistic domain, he has been ConservationConsultant to the Fine Art Trade Guild, and in the world of music, his librettocompositions have been performed at London's Royal Opera House. A KnightTemplar of St. Anthony and Prior of the Sacred Kindred of St. Columba, he isalso the internationally best-selling author of Bloodline of the Holy Grail,Realm of the Ring Lords and Genesis of the Grail Kings. \"It is clear from the documentary evidence of ancient times that the attributes ofsuperconductors and gravity defiance were known then, if not understood, in adistant world of priestly levitation, godly communication, and the phenomenalpower of the electrikus. In Greek mythology the quest for the secret of this(white gold) substance was at the heart of the Golden Fleece legend, while inbiblical terms it was the mystical realm of the Ark of the Covenant - the golden"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"coffer which Moses brought out of Sinai, and was later housed in the Temple ofJerusalem.\" The Book: Swirled Harvest, Views from the Crop Circle Frontline Swirled Harvest is a collection of essays and pieces written over an eleven yearperiod a valuable glimpse into the crop circle culture and how those within itview the world outside. It provides an informative, entertaining and importantdocument of the ins and outs of researching the crop mystery. The Author: Andy Thomas Andy Thomas was born and raised in southeast England at Lewes, East Sussex,an area where he still lives and works. He was a founding member of theSouthern Circular Research group (SCR), which investigates crop formations.Andy is now Editor of the crop formation news and editorial website,http://www.swirlednews.com. Andy has written four other books: Fields ofMystery: The Crop Circle Phenomenon in Sussex (1996); co-wrote with PaulBura Quest for Contact: A True Story of Crop Circles, Psychics and UFOs(1997); Vital Signs: A Complete Guide to the Crop Circle Mystery and Why ItIs NOT a Hoax (1998 and updated in 2002); A Oneness of Mind (2003). Concerning this new book, I interviewed Andy Thomas on September 15, 2003,and asked him to discuss one of the chapters in the book about small lightsmaking a crop formation on videotape:\"AFTER YOUR INVOLVEMENT IN CROP CIRCLE RESEARCH FORELEVEN YEARS, ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING SUBJECTS LISTEDIN YOUR BOOK IS THE OLIVER'S CASTLE VIDEOTAPE ALLEGEDLY OFLIGHTS CREATING THE 6-FOLD GEOMETRY. COULD YOU DESCRIBETHE CONTROVERSY?The piece in Swirled Harvest, I think what is valuable about it is that it waswritten only about three months after that piece of video that purports to show aformation appearing (in the presence of balls of light). So, the article in SwirledHarvest is very good, raw description of what was happening at the time. Whosaid what, and who did what. We originally published that in our old journal,SC, which is now defunct, and nobody ever challenged it.Here we are all these years later and still no one has decided whether the videois genuine or not. I think the same arguments that were being put forward forand against back in 1996 still stand today. We're not really any further forwardwith it than we were back then, which in itself says something about the wholeintrigue that surrounded this video.THE GUY WHO TOOK THAT VIDEO, I BELIEVE HIS NAME WAS JOHNWA B E ?Well, even that is not definite. At the time, the chap's name was supposed to beJohn Wayleigh under a number of possible spellings. Then somebody tracked"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"down a John Wabe who they thought might be one and the same person. Butyou know, that was never firmly established. A Japanese television crew trackeddown a chap they thought was him and went to his work place which wassupposedly a video editing place in Bristol. Then they chased him across a carpark and the chap refused to be interviewed. This was offered as proof that hewas obviously a faker and had faked this piece of video. There has been talk of aconfession video with this John Wabe or Wayleigh sitting there telling the worldthat, 'Yes, I faked it,' and here's why. But nobody in the public domain has everseen this video (of the alleged confession.)IS IT A FACT THAT PETER SORENSEN AND COLLIN ANDREWS ARETHE ONLY PEOPLE WHO TALKED WITH THE VIDEOTAPER?That I wouldn't like to say for sure. I think a few other people did speak withhim because on the night this video was first shown at the Barge Inn (AltonBarnes, Wiltshire), this Wayleigh chap as he called himself then did turn up atthe pub in the evening and showed this video (in his camera) to a group (5 or 6people) of people who were at the bar. But after two or three months, this chapvanished from view and was never found again. Depending on whether youbelieve Wabe is Wayleigh, this is where it starts to get very confused.The way I look at it is this: my book doesn't say whether it's genuine or not. ButI'm very interested in looking at the possibility of the video, the implications if itwere faked, the implications if it is genuine. I think in all the rush to condemnthe video as a piece of fakery, a lot of people didn't stop to consider: what if itwere genuine? Or, what if it isn't the genuine thing? Then a genuine video of acrop circle appearing does come along, will that be treated any differently? Ihave a horrible suspicion it wouldn't be. I think unless a crop circle isvideotaped in the making like in front of multiple witnesses, I think there wouldalways be this doubt and intrigue and claims it was special effects. So, it'sinteresting that since 1996, no body has ever come forward with another videopurporting to show this happening. And yet, all the debunkers of the OliversCastle video at the time said, 'Oh, it would be very easy to fake this footage.Anybody could do it with any computer.'Well, that's plainly not the case because no one else has come forward andclaimed that they have produced a similar piece of footage. There was a U.K.movie that was made a few years back (although it's never been officiallyreleased as a film) called, A Place to Stay about crop circles. The end of thestory has a crop circle that appears in the field. It's interesting to note there thatwith all the facilities at their fingertips, the filmmakers don't show a lovelysweeping shot of the formation appearing like you get in the Oliver's Castlevideo. It's all kind of done cheaply with cameras swishing through the crop.So, again, you say, 'If this was so easy to fake like everybody said it was, whyhaven't we seen lots of other people having a go at a similar piece of footage?' Ithink that is something worth considering.\"The Book: Connecting the Dots ... Making Sense of the UFO Phenomenon Connecting the Dots includes twenty-five personal interviews with researchersof the non-human phenomenon, including U. S. Army Lt. Col. Philip Corso's"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"own alleged encounter with an entity and the Vatican's preparation for ETcontact. Paola says, \"We are not now, nor have we ever been, alone\" in thecosmos. The Author: Paola Leopizzi Harris received from Centro UfologicoInternational a best researcher award for Connecting the Dots at the CUIconference in Rovigo, Italy, October 2003. Paola received her Masters of Artsdegree in Curriculum Development, Education, from Leslie College in Boston,Massachusetts in 1991 and teaches history and photojournalism at AmericanOverseas of Rome, Inc., in Rome, Italy. Paola has written for Nexus, UFOMagazine, Notizario UFO and Dossier Alieni. From 1980-1986, she assisted Dr.J. Allen Hynek with his UFO investigations. Then she evolved into interviewingexperiencers and most recently she has been exploring the psychic connectionsto the UFO phenomenon. See her website: http://utenti.lycos.it/paolaharrisConcerning her book, I interviewed Paola Harris on August 23, 2003, and askedwhat had provoked her most to write this book:\"It isn't until I worked with Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso in 1997 that I began puttingtogether the dots and began seeing a worldwide picture and I began gettingexposed to all these researchers who had been working for years all of them inmy book.COL. CORSO CAME IN FOR SUCH ATTACK BY MEDIA AND OTHERSAFTER HIS JULY 1997 BOOK, THE DAY AFTER ROSWELL, WA SRELEASED. I KNOW THAT YOU HOSTED HIM IN ITALY. WHATCONVINCED YOU THAT HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH?We have to look at the person himself. Col. Corso was head of intelligence inItaly in Rome from 1944 to 1947. As an aside, when he came to Rome, Idragged the poor man to where his office was and to where he lodged at theAmbassadorio Hotel. I did extensive research on it because I believed the detailshe was telling about what he did and was, but I personally was curious. TheAmbassadorio Hotel has since been remodeled, but when he walked in, he toldme where everything was and I called one of the gentlemen who had been therein 1944 and he verified Corso's story. And he worked under PresidentEisenhower and President Kennedy.It's very rare to have a background like this and write such a revealing bookabout extraterrestrials and their technologies! Why would a witness who hadthis kind of background lie? I was on a radio show just the other day (HickmanReport) and one woman called in and said she had worked with Corso and shesaid he was appalled by how he was treated in this country.So why were he and his book attacked so badly? Books in competition. Corso'sbook was 17th on the New York Times best seller list, so it sold a lot of copies.Therefore, I think who is doing the debunking and criticizing are jealous fellowresearchers.\"Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
