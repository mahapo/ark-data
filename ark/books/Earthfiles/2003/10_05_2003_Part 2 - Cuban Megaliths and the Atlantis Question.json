October 5, 2003 Havana, Cuba - Three years ago when Paulina Zelitsky andPaul Weinzweig, co-owners of Advanced Digital Communications, saw the firstside scan sonar images of the deep water structures off the western tip of Cuba,some underwater objects were dark as metals sometimes show up onmagnetometers. I asked Paul if any more data supported the initial cesiummagnetometer data which implied there might be metal coatings on some of themegalithic structures.

One kind of stone was white, another black, and a third red,and as they quarried, they at the same time hollowed out rocks doublewithin, having roofs formed out of the native rock. ...The entire circuit ofthe wall, which went round the outermost one, they covered with a coatingof brass, and the circuit of the next wall they coated with tin, and thethird,m which encompassed the citadel, flashed with the red light oforichalcum (copper or copper alloy). \"...In the center was a holy temple dedicated to Cleito and Poseidon,which remained inaccessible, and was surrounded by an enclosure of gold....All the outside of the temple, with the exception of the pinnacles, theycovered with silver, and the pinnacles with gold. In the interior of thetemple the roof was of ivory, adorned everywhere with gold and silver andorichalcum; all the other parts of the walls and pillars and floor they linedwith orichalcum.\"Map of Atlantis by 17th Century German Jesuit scholar and physicist"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Anthanasius Kircher, from Gateway to Atlantis © 2000 by Andrew Collins.Andrew Collins, British researcher of the Caribbean and the Atlantis legend,hypothesizes in his 2000 book, Gateway to Atlantis, that Cuba was in fact partof the great lost continent that sank into the Atlantic around 11,000 years ago.Above: Symbolic drawing made in 1931 by Mayan glyph researcher,James Churchward, depicting a cataclysm of earthquakes and volcanoes that allegedlysank the continent of Mu in the Pacific Ocean. Below: Churchward's map showing how hethought Mu refugees spread out after the cataclysm through South America, alongthe shores of Atlantis and into Africa. Drawings © 1931 by James Churchward.Collins says, \"I also concluded that Plato's claim that Atlantis's destruction inone single night and day through earthquakes and floods was based oncatastrophe legends told to Phoenician and Carthaginian mariners by theindigenous peoples of the Bahamas and Caribbean. They were told first to theSpanish explorers who reached the islands and spoke of a catastrophic eventinvolving a period of darkness, as well as an all-encompassing flood whichengulfed a former great land mass, leaving behind the thousands of islands andcays which today make up these same archipelagos.\"In my opinion,\" Collins says, \"these stories relate to a cosmic event whichoccurred at the end of the last ice age and involved the creation of 500,000elliptical craters in the eastern United States.\"What Andrew Collins is talking about are the so-called Carolina Bays, whichare found across six states and range in size from a few hundred meters to 11kilometers in length. The latest theories regarding their formation say a cometbroke up into thousands of pieces which impacted a wide area, including a largepart of the Atlantic Ocean off the U. S., sometime between 8500 to 9,000 B. C.Such an event would have caused super-tsunami waves that would haveengulfed the low-lying regions of the Bahamas and Caribbean killing everythingin their path."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Thousands of elliptical craters called \"Carolina Bays\" cover parts of North and SouthCarolina,Georgia, Florida, Virginia and Maryland, such as these at Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Ageof the event is still not known.

Satellite photograph byDonnie McKish.Moreover, Collins points out that Italian academic Emilio Spedicato of BergamoUniversity proposes that such a comet impact on the Atlantic seaboard of the U.S. most probably catalyzed the retreat of the ice sheets which had covered NorthAmerica and Europe for up to 40,000 years.With the sudden comet-caused end of the ice age, rising melt water would havedrowned low lying regions on a permanent basis. That might be the memorypassed on from generation to generation in the Bahamas, Cuba and rest of theCaribbean before and during the age of Plato."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Giant Skeletons - A Link to Ancient Megalithic Builders?The puzzle about who first peopled Meso-America and when? - has been furtherprovoked by other archaeological discoveries. In 1967, scientists working a sitesoutheast of Mexico City in Tlapacoya, uncovered a finely made blade ofobsidian that was dated to about 21,000 B. C.Near Puebla, Mexico, excavations in the Valsequillo region revealed culturalremains of human groups that were hunting mammoth and other animals withunifacially worked blades that dated to 21,800 B. C.In 2002, anthropologist Dr. Silvia Gonzalez reported new radiocarbon testing ontwenty-seven skulls found in Mexico a century ago that are almost 13,000 yearsold. Remarkably, two of the 100 Mexico skulls were long and narrow as weresome elongated skulls found in Mayan excavations and art such as the \"Lord ofthe Double Scroll\" below, carved in green serpentine by an Olmec artisancenturies ago.Very large and elongated skull found in the Yucatan.Was this a genetic anomaly? Or the result of skull-wrapping in theSerpent priesthood of the Maya? Andrew Collins asks, \"Do such skulls implyan ancestral line in which giantism was present?\"Elongated head carved in green serpentine of whatcould have been an ancient Olmec ruler. Two faint lines on his right cheek, now barelyvisible, give the name \"The Lord of the Double Scroll.\" Source: Mysteries of theAncient Americas © 1986 by The Reader's Digest Association Far East Ltd.The elongated Mexican and Olmec heads are also reminiscent of thelong-headed, reptilian humanoids known as Ubaid figurines from Sumeria,carved at least 4,500 years ago. Thousands of terra-cotta figurines from Ur insouthern Mesopotamia dating back to about 3500 B. C., depict tall, thin beingswith elongated heads and reptilian features.

Cave in Mexico Gives Up the Bones of an Ancient Race.\" The articlesaid that a Mr. Charles Clapp had returned from Mexico where he ran mininginterests and said,\"He found a cave containing some 200 skeletons of men each above eightfeet in height. The cave was evidently the burial place of a race of giantswho preceded the Aztecs. Mr. Clapp arranged the bones of one of theskeletons and found the total length to be 8 feet 11 inches. The headmeasured eighteen inches from front to back.\"A few years later on June 21, 1924, the Ti mes reported, \"Find Skeleton ofGiant. A huge skeleton, believed to be that of a prehistoric human being, hasbeen discovered in the Salmon River country south of Lewiston, Idaho, by twomembers of the State Highway Department who have brought their find toLewiston. ...Measuring more than eight feet in height and possessing numerousstrange features, the skeleton has aroused widespread interest. ...Both the upperand lower jaws have only ten teeth each and all are intact.\" That giant skeletonwas sent to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D. C.There are many other such reports from the 1900s and through the 20th Centuryabout unusually tall skeletons discovered around our planet.Who were the very tall, long-headed people which possibly preceded the betterknown human civilizations of Sumeria, Egypt, Europe, North, Central andSouth America? Could the giant skeletons of the earth be connected to theAtlantis legend, as described by Plato (circa 428 to 347 B. C.), nearly 2,400years ago?
