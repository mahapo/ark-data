But I would say we aremuch less vulnerable, in the sense of being unable to respond, thanwe were a year ago. It's like night and day even from a year ago. Doesthat mean we are really well prepared to do all that needs to bedone? No! There is a lot to be done, particularly at the local levels.\"- D. H. Henderson, M. D.Smallpox face lesions on boy.Photograph by Cheryl Tyron, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia.Man with smallpox. Photograph by Barbra Rice, Centers for Disease Control. January 17, 2003 - Over the past several days, there have been nationalheadlines such as:\"Flu has turned deadlier in the last decade, new study says.\"\"Postal Service tests facility for anthrax, Possible bacteria found in FederalReserve sample.\"\"Bubonic plague suspected in New York City visitors.\"\"U.S. is unprepared for germ warfare.\"That last headline is a quote from Colonel Erik Henchal, Head of the U. S.Army's Biological Defense Laboratory. He has complained that the military'sefforts to develop defenses against biological weapons have not had monetary"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"support for development from Congress or pharmaceutical companies. Yet,Saddam Hussein has acknowledged in the past that his scientists have madethousands of gallons of toxins such as botulinum, anthrax, plague and virusessuch as smallpox for biological weapons of war. Since the first symptoms of these diseases are often like influenza, some federalmonies from the new bio-defense fund are now supporting research at theUniversity of Maryland's Institute of Human Virology. Scientists are nowmonitoring influenza cases at a Baltimore hospital. The goal is to come up witha genetic test of blood that will rapidly be able to tell the difference between adangerous disease such as smallpox and the flu. The head of that research is Professor Maria Salvato, a molecular virologist atthe University of Maryland's Institute of Human Virology in Baltimore. Today Iasked her to comment on Army Colonel Erik Henchal's statement that the \"U. S.is unprepared for germ warfare.\"Interviews:Maria Salvato, Ph.D. (Molecular Virology), Professor of Virology,University of Maryland, Institute of Human Virology, Baltimore,Maryland: \"I think it is generally accepted that the U. S. could be betterprepared. Current surveillance is very poor. I receive monthly reports of virusinfections from our local diagnostic lab at the hospital. They make diagnoses ononly about 1 out of 30 patients that come through with flu-like illness. Eachdiagnosis costs from $100 to $500 dollars. And it takes almost two weeks forsome of them to come back. So, cheaper diagnostics, faster diagnostics areneeded, and a lot more surveillance is needed. More diagnoses need to be made.SO, IN THE UNITED STATES RIGHT NOW, TRYING TO SEPARATE OUTWHAT MIGHT BE NATURALLY OCCURRING LET'S SAY, A FLU VIRUS FROM SOMETHING THAT COULD BE A BIOTERRORIST ATTACK, ISREALLY NOT HAPPENING?No. That's a very critical thing that needs to be done.AS AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE EXPERT, WHAT ARE YOUR GREATESTCONCERNS NOW IN COPING WITH THIS PROBLEM OF DISCERNINGBETWEEN NATURALLY OCCURRING DISEASE OUTBREAKS AND ABIOTERRORIST ATTACK?The biggest problem is speed how fast can all this be done? Once an outbreakhas been identified, the biggest difficulty is containing it. People will fly off fromthe place where the outbreak occurred to another state and start spreadingthings. The speed of diagnostics and speed of surveillance needs to be steppedup.HOW ARE YOU TRYING TO HELP WITH THAT?I have actually received IHS funds which are new bio-defense funds to conductflu surveillance in our local hospital. So, I know what the current rate ofsurveillance is. I know that very few diagnostics are done, so I am paying forthem from this research grant and I am trying to make a more rapid form ofdiagnostic, one that can detect the infection before the pathogen builds up in thebloodstream.HOW DO YOU DO THAT?What we believe is that the blood cells change their messenger RNA once theyare exposed to a virus. So, we know that in monkey models, for example, if youexpose them to flu virus, monkeys have a temperature change in two days of theexposure. And yet you can only detect the virus in day 7 or later. That meansthe body is going through a lot of changes way before the pathogen builds upand causes disease. We want to look at blood cell messenger RNA changes usingmicro technology in order to determine what type of virus or pathogen is"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"affecting the body.HOW DO YOU THINK THE UNITED STATES CAN COPE WITH TRYINGTO SCREEN FOR SOMETHING LIKE AN UNEXPECTED SMALL POXOUTBREAK?That's a very big, almost a political problem because responders are stretchedthin and the U. S. government has to somehow make incentives for moresurveillance and set up a health care system that can cope with bio warfareoutbreaks.SO, YOU WOULD AGREE THAT WITH MEDICAL DOCTORS QUITTINGUNDER INSURANCE PRESSURES AND PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICESSTRUGGLING TO JUST COPE DAY-TO-DAY, THE UNITED STATES ISVULNERABLE TO A BIOCHEMICAL ATTACK, MAYBE EVEN MORE SOTHAN BEFORE 9/11?Yeah, I would say. It's very stretched.\"Flu Turned Deadlier in the 1990sComplicating the American challenge to know the difference between a flu bugand a bioterrorist disease, influenza has been deadlier in the United States since1992. A new study about flu mortality in the United States conducted by theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, was publishedin the January 8, 2003 Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).When decades were compared, in the 1970s and 1980s, flu killed fewer than5,600 people in three separate years.But in the 1990s, from the fall of 1992 through the spring of 1999, annual fludeaths never dropped below 27,000 and reached a high of 51,296 in the 1997 to1998 season. Final numbers aren't in yet for 1999 to 2000 which some medicalexperts think will show an even higher flu death rate. For the first time inAmerican history, one influenza strain reached epidemic levels four years in arow from fall 1996 to spring 2000. That's the Influenza A, subtype H3N2, anddoctors still don't know why that particular virus affected so many people in the1990s.Flu and pneumonia together are now the 7th leading cause of death in America,after heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic lung diseases, accidents and diabetes.W. Paul Glezen, M. D., Professor of Molecular Virology, Microbiology andPediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, says the four yearsof epidemic Type A/H3N2 influenza were unique and he, like many otherepidemiologists, wonder if the trend will continue.This week I asked Dr. Glezen if something has changed in the H3N2 virus thatmakes it more lethal to humans.Paul Glezen, M. D., Professor of Molecular Virology, Microbiology andPediatrics, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas: \"What happensconstantly with flu virus that the surface coat changes, so even if you had flu lastyear, you may not be immune to this year's flu. The flu virus is unique in thatnone of the surface antigens are conserved like they are for other respiratoryviruses. Therefore, our immunity is short-lived because the virus escapes ourimmune system. This happens constantly. This is nothing new.Now, what the CDC was saying in this report that was published in the JAMAon January 8 is that in the period since 1968 when H3N2 viruses appeared, mostof the excess mortality that has occurred in the last 34 years can be attributed toepidemics with the influenza A, H3N2 sub-type. Perhaps there has been somechange in the virulence of that virus because I think in the period of 1993 to2000, 6 our of 7 epidemics were caused by H3N2. That's unusual to have, asoccurred then, four consecutive H3N2 epidemics. Usually we saw them everyother year, rather than every year. And there is no good explanation for why wehad so many H3N2 epidemics in the decade of the 1990s."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"DO YOU HAVE ANY EDUCATED GUESS?There are some theories. One is that it's been shown in the last few years thatinfluenza virus makes an anti-interferon. Remember interferon is part of ourinnate immunity, part of our natural ability to control all virus infections, ormost virus infections. It allows time for specific immunity to develop.Well, influenza virus has a component which makes an anti-interferon and if thisis particularly strong, then this would block the individual's ability to control theinfection when it first occurred, as ordinarily we hope it will and allow thespecific immunity to take hold.There are other factors that may impinge on this. One of them is air pollution.Any time you damage a mucosa with a virus infection, you make yourself forvulnerable to pollutants that are in the air. So if these people are living in a citywhere air pollution is bad, that's going to continue to aggravate. If you'reallergic, then there are a lot of factors. All of these things can be initiated by avirus infection. But there are other processes that can take over to prolong theillness.IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT FROM AN EPIDEMIOLOGY POINT OF VIEWTHAT THE INFLUENZA VIRUS DOES SEEM TO BE HARMING MOREPEOPLE AND CAUSING MORE DEATHS SINCE THE MID-1990S?Well, the main reason it's causing more deaths is because there are morevulnerable people. You have to also work into this the population thing. Ourpopulation is increasing, our population density is increasing, and viruses lovethat because they can spread much more readily. When we are living in urbanareas and our population has become urbanized considerably in the last 50years. So, instead of living on small farms, we are all crowding into the city.That allows viruses to spread much readily in the population.The other factor is our population is aging. Most of the excess deaths I talkedabout are in people over 65 years of age. If you look at the population statistics,you know that population has doubled in the last few years so many morepeople are vulnerable. In fact, the death rate has not increased. It's the numberof deaths that have increased simply because there is a larger pool of peoplewho are in the vulnerable age group.SO, THAT 85% INCREASE IN DEATHS SINCE THE MID 1990S TO DATE ISRELATED TO THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A LARGER POPULATION OFPEOPLE OVER AGE 65?Right, and it's going to get worse. Baby boomers are just starting to reach thatage and over the next 20 or 30 years, the population over 65 is going to doubleagain. So, if we're up to 51,000 excess deaths in the 1990s, we're going toprobably be at 100,000 excess deaths at 2030 if we don't do something else tocontrol influenza.WHAT CAN WE DO IF THE DEATH RATE ITSELF IS LARGELY RELATEDTO OPPORTUNISTIC BACTERIA THAT GETS INTO A SYSTEM AFTER ANINFLUENZA VIRUS HAS TAKEN HOLD AND CAUSES BRONCHITIS ANDPNEUMONIA?We can prevent the influenza infection. You prevent the initiator of the processand that's the way you can control it.YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT FLU SHOTS.Right. Or nasal spray flu vaccine which we hope will be licensed soon.WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD BE A SMART AND LOGICAL PROGRAMFOR THE UNITED STATES?I think that universal influenza immunization would be important. We'reinterested in the possibility that giving flu vaccine to school children will"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"dampen influenza epidemics and reduce the chance of exposure of high riskpatients to influenza. Because school kids are generally the main spreaders of fluin the community.WHY IS IT THAT OLDER PEOPLE DON'T SEEM TO HAVE AS MUCHRESISTANCE TO FLU IF THEY GET A VACCINE?It looks like the immune system becomes less responsive. Cell immunity seemsto be diminished. What we know is that antibody response to flu vaccine goesdown as we age.WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE THESE DAYS AFTER 9/11 ANDBIOTERRORISM AND THE GULF WAR SYNDROME 'LOOK, I DON'TWANT ANYTHING BEING PUT INSIDE OF ME BECAUSE I DON'T TRUSTTHE GOVERNMENT ANYMORE.'I think when we look at our ability to establish bio -security, one of the thingswe need to do is to diminish influenza type illnesses. One of the diseasesyndromes that is under surveillance now because so many disease start with flulike illnesses if we are going to be able to recognize when something unusualoccurs like airborne anthrax spores.OR SMALL POX?Small pox. It would be good not to have influenza to worry about. So if wecould set up good methods for surveillance and control of influenza, we'll be inmuch better shape IF a bioterrorism occurs.WHAT IS YOUR MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OFSOMETHING LIKE SMALL POX OR ANTHRAX BEING ABLE TO BEDELIVERED THROUGH THE AIR AND CAUSE PEOPLE TO GET SICK?I think it's very possible, pretty frightening, the possibilities.DO YOU THINK WE ARE GETTING ANY CLOSER TO BEING PREPAREDFOR A BIOTERRORIST ATTACK?I think we're getting closer, but we have a long way to go to really be protected.SO MAYBE THAT'S WHERE THIS COUNTRY'S GREATESTVULNERABILITY IS NOW?I think that we are always going to be vulnerable to these types of attacks simplybecause it's much less expensive to produce these agents of bioterrorism to, say,atomic bombs or other things. So, we have to be very wary of this and keep upour defenses.AS AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST FOR SEVERAL DECADES, WHAT IS YOURGREATEST CONCERN NOW AS WE SEEM TO BE IN A NEW COUNTRYWITH GREATER CONCERNS HAVING TO DO WITH BIOTERRORISM.WHAT IS YOUR PERSONAL GREATEST CONCERN?My concern is that we concentrate on the things that we CAN prevent and useour resources wisely so we don't spend billions of dollars on remotepossibilities, but develop I think my big concern now is that we strengthen ourpublic health infrastructure so we are better able to cope with any sort of bioemergency, no matter what it is. What this requires is a strong public health thathas good surveillance, good laboratories and good communications so that wecan be alert and know when something unusual happens and be right on top ofit. So, I think that a lot has to be invested in our public health infrastructurebecause this will provide dividends no matter what happens, you know? Thereare remote possibilities that we could have serious attacks. But with a strongpublic health infrastructure, out health will improve overall and we'll be betterprepared if those emergencies arise.BUT WITH ALL THE COMPETITIONS FOR FEDERAL DOLLARS FORHOMELAND SECURITY AND ALL OF THE OTHER BURDENS THAT"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"HAVE BEEN PLACED SINCE 9/11, IS PUBLIC HEALTH GETTING THEKIND OF MONEY AND SUPPORT THAT IT NEEDS?I haven't seen that it is.SO WHERE DOES THAT LEAVE US?We have to order our priorities and think about this and see what our leaders aresuggesting and see if we agree.HOW DO YOU LEVERAGE SUPPORT FOR ORGANIZING PRIORITIESAROUND LOGIC INSTEAD OF POLITICS?(laughs) That's pretty difficult! I don't have the answer to that because I'm not apolitician. All I can do is voice the concerns, particularly for the areas where Ihave some expertise and hope that things move in the right direction.\"United States Is Still Vulnerable to BioterrorismDonald H. Henderson, M. D., Principal Science Advisor in the Office ofPublic Health and Emergency Preparedness for the Secretary of Healthand Human Services, Washington, D. C.:\"I think the man from Baylor is right in the sense that the public healthinfrastructure is still weak. But the President has asked for another $1 billionthis year. We talked with both Republicans and Democrats and there is reallystrong bilateral support and understanding that we are not going to create whatwe think is best overnight or even in a couple of years. This is going to have togo on out over the future. When you let a system deteriorate for 40 or 50 years,you can't build it back in just a couple of years. It's going to take time. We aremoving as fast as we can on that, but there are real shortages, shortages ofpeople to fill slots, shortages of money. But I think the commitment is there. It isa big change already to what it was.BUT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS - AS THE DOCTOR FROM BAYLORPOINTED OUT - THE UNITED STATES IS STILL VERY VULNERABLE IFWE DID HAVE SOME KIND OF MAJOR BIOTERRORISM ATTACK?I would say certainly we are vulnerable. I would say we are much lessvulnerable in the sense of being unable to respond than we were a year ago. It'slike night and day even from a year ago. Does that mean we are really wellprepared to do all that needs to be done? No! There is a lot to be done,particularly at the local levels. But we receive now reports on a regular basisfrom the states and local areas and we just finished a review of the reports thatcame in the first of November and I'm very impressed that they are really makinggreat progress.WHAT IS YOUR OWN PERSONAL GREATEST CONCERN RIGHT NOW INJANUARY 2003 BEING A PERSON WHO IS HAVING TO SIT IN ALLTHESE MEETINGS ABOUT AMERICAN EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESSAND GOING HOME AT NIGHT AND WORRYING?I go home at night and worry! No question about it.WHAT DO YOU WORRY THE MOST ABOUT?Well, it is very difficult to deal with an outbreak. I've been throughout all my lifeworking on epidemics in various places. Any epidemic of a disease is not easilyhandled. It's something new, it's strange, people are concerned. And the problemis trying to put into place very rapidly measures which are effective and at thesame time to keep the communication with the public very open and keep themvery much aboard and explain to them what it is and getting that message out ina very clear way: what is really the problem, what can you do about it, what arewe doing about it. These are very difficult things to handle.I think one of the problems is that in regard to bioterrorism, we're anticipatingand worried about a number of diseases about which very few physicians know"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"anything, or have known anything. I don't think there are more than a handfulphysicians who have dealt with any one of the major diseases we are concernedabout: small pox, botulism, plague, tularemia, or Ebola. The physicians are justnot familiar with it and it's understandable: we don't have those diseases. So, it'simportant for us and we recognize this to get information out to them the best,the latest, the most comprehensive information that we can. We're very muchinvolved with that at the present time.ANY ONE OF THOSE DISEASES SHOWING UP IS SORT OF A HAIRTRIGGER THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG.That's right. But the thing that is often the problem is there comes a point ofenormous fear of, let's say, that exaggerates the seriousness of the problem. Andthere is the concern not to appreciate how likely a disease is to spread. Forexample, is plague. People think of the Black Death of the Middle Ages andthey think, 'Oh, my goodness, we're going to have huge epidemics and people aregoing to be dying right, left and center.' Well, we've been very active in trying tounderstand what is plague like in today's contemporary world and we have beenworking on all the data from 1900 outbreaks that have occurred. What hasbecome perfectly clear is that plague does not spread very well. It does notspread at all well. In the Middle Ages, it spread for a very different set ofreasons. We've got good antibiotics to treat the cases.IN THE MIDDLE AGES, IT SPREAD EASILY BECAUSE?The problems of housing, of the rats, the whole standard of housing, crowding,people living very packed into areas with poor sanitation and poor nutrition.When you put everything together, it really requires a lot of factors like this forit to really spread.SO WHEN THESE ISOLATED CASES SHOW UP IN PLACES SOMETIMESLIKE NEW MEXICO AND IN THIS CASE IN NEW YORK CITY WHERETHERE IS A COUPLE FROM NEW MEXICO NOW CONFIRMED TO HAVEBUBONIC PLAGUE, YOU AND OTHERS YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT THISAS A WORRY THAT THEY COULD SPREAD BUBONIC PLAGUE BYBEING IN NEW YORK CITY?No, not at all. I wouldn't be the least bit worried.WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO ARE SO AFRAID OF GETTING ASMALLPOX VACCINATION?Well, I think they forget that up until 1972 every child in this country, virtuallyevery child, got vaccinated. It was required in most states for entry into school.We have since then, there have been a number of others who have beenvaccinated. As adults, you had to be vaccinated successfully within the previousthree years to go to most countries of the world. The military was regularlyvaccinated. I think the point is that vaccination has been very extensively used inthis country. We were doing about 12 to 15 million vaccinations a year. But it isa procedure which has not been performed for quite a long time.Just myself in calculating this, I thought about it. In 1972 we stopped. Let us saythat the youngest physicians then who would have been administering thevaccines at that time would be about 30 years old, so that now they are 60 yearsold. So physicians themselves have not seen vaccination, they have not seenwhat (smallpox) looks like. It is recognized that there are complications with thevaccine, but it's hard to keep this in perspective. Is everyone who is going to getthe vaccine going to have a severe reaction, the answer is no.RECENTLY THERE WAS RELEASE OF INFORMATION FROM ONE OFTHE MEDICAL JOURNALS THAT SINCE THE MID-1990S, THERE HASBEEN AN INCREASE OF MORTALITY FROM INFLUENZA, ESPECIALLYTYPE A INFLUENZA, AN INCREASE OF 85% MORTALITY SINCE THELAST DECADE. DO YOU LOOK AT THAT AND HAVE ANY CONCERNABOUT INFLUENZA A VIRUSES BEING USED FOR BIOTERRORISM?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"What we are really worried about is that the virus might change and may start tobehave like the swine flu, or what we call the 1918 influenza where you had alot of deaths. That has been a very great worry. That's why there is right now aglobal network of laboratories that has been in existence for many years to try topick up anything unusual so that if something, a new virus does pop up, wewould be able to retrieve it and move to produce new vaccines.WASN'T THE STRANGENESS OF THE SWINE FLU IN THE 1918 PERIODBECAUSE IT TARGETED AND KILLED THE YOUNGER, SAY BETWEEN18 AND 30, AND THAT MOST OF THOSE DEATHS WERE CAUSED BYPNEUMONIA?Yeah, it killed an unusual number in that age group. It's a very unusualphenomenon and they died primarily of an influenza pneumonia.WHAT CAUSES PNEUMONIA TO SUDDENLY TAKE OVER A HEALTHYBODY?It's a virus. It depends on the characteristics of the virus. If you have an influenzavirus which has unusual characteristics of pathogenicity, it might do that. We'vehad recently about 3 to 4 years ago in Hong Kong a new strain of influenzacalled H5N1. In all there were 18 cases that occurred, and 6 of those peopledeveloped pneumonia and died. But fortunately, that strain did not seem tospread very well. But this is what everybody keeps a close alert out to be surethat we get and detect as soon as possible and are ready to move quickly and dosomething.\"We b s it e s :http://www.bt.cdc.gov/agent/smallpox/index.aspCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
