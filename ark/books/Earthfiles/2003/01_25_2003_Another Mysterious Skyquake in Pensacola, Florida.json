January 25, 2003 Pensacola, Florida - On Monday, January 13, at 3 p.m.,69-year-old retiree, Barbara Heindl, had just come home from the grocery storeand was starting to put food away in her Pensacola, Florida kitchen when sheheard a sound that stopped her in her tracks.Interview:Barbara Heindl, Retired, Pensacola, Florida: \"A slight rumbling. At first, Ithought it sounded like a distant thunder, not too loud, and it kept gettinglouder. And then well, it was a noise I can't really describe. It was like I said, Inever heard anything like it. I stood there. I wasn't in shock or anything, but Ithought, 'What in the devil is that?' I might have used a little stronger tone. I'mnot too sure.CAN YOU MIMIC THE SOUND TO GIVE US AN IDEA OF WHAT THISSTRANGE...?I don't think I could. It was like between an explosion and a trembling sound.I've lived in the area long enough to think it was not a sonic boom because livingin this area with all the military aircraft all around you've experienced sonicbooms before. I don't know if my windows were rattling or not. I don't believethey were. But I stood there and thought it would never stop. It seemed likeforever. It must have been 30 seconds, but not that long probably.YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT MANY SECONDS?I'm saying 6 or 7 seconds, I would say it seemed like, you know? And mythoughts were when it stopped, 'What in the world could that have been?' I amclose to the Pensacola Regional Airport. The north runway is behind my home. Ihave very little traffic. You can't hear it much."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"My first thought was that a plane must have crashed and that caused thevibration of the ground. I went out my back door , but I didn't see any smoke orfire and went out the front door and looked. Nothing! Came back in the house,stood in my dining room and thought, 'Well, dear gosh, could my car haveexploded?' Opened the door and thought just before I did, 'That's a bad idea incase there is a fire out there.' But everything was fine. Just didn't know what itwas, you know?The reason I called the news bureau after I read that first article was I couldn'tremember the dates that I could recall vividly that we had two other occasionsthat windows shook and rattled, but they never told us what it was.Now, Eglin AFB is not too far from here. My other thought was that Eglin wasdoing testing because I believe there were articles in the paper that they wouldbe doing different testing there but they would notify the public.RIGHT NOW, NO ONE KNOWS FOR SURE AND THEY HAVEE L I M I N AT E D T H AT O N J A N U A R Y 1 3 , T H AT M O N D AY , I T WA S N O T A NEARTHQUAKE, IT WAS NOT A METEOR, IT WAS NOT AN INDUSTRIALEXPLOSION, IT WAS NOT ANYTHING FROM ANY KNOWN MILITARYBASE.I know it!IN THE PENSACOLA NEWS JOURNAL, IT QUOTES EGLIN AFBOFFICIALS WHO INSIST THEY HAD NO AIRCRAFT IN OPERATION THATPRODUCED A SONIC BOOM AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT WHICHOCCURRED SHORTLY BEFORE 3 PM ON MONDAY, JANUARY 13.Yes, exactly, and that's what I'm telling you. I realized it was not a sonic boombecause I've experienced a sonic boom.\" History of Other Skyquakes Around the World Since AtLeast 1989According to newspaper records, huge \"unknown tremors,\" or skyquakes,shook Pensacola, Florida in November 1989 and January 1990. Then inNovember 1991, \"unusually loud, rumbling sonic booms\" were heard andfelt near Pensacola. Then came this latest event on January 13, 2003. In late 1991, around the same time that Pensacola was shaken, a series ofunusual sonic booms were detected in Southern California. The incidentswere recorded on U.S. Geological Survey sensors in June, October,November and late January 1991. An anonymous arms-control analyst saidhe examined a Landsat image of \"Dreamland\" at Area 51, Groom Lake,Nellis AFB, that showed three white triangles sitting by the main runwayat the air base, each about the size of a Boeing 747. In early 1992, a number of houses in the Netherlands were damaged by ahuge sonic boom. A Dutch newspaper reported there was no aircraft in thearea that could have caused such a noise and structural damage andsuggested the skyquake came from a top secret plane temporarily based inScotland for testing. By mid-1992, aviation reporter Bill Sweetman concluded that, \"Thefrequency of the sonic booms indicates that whatever is making them isnow an operational aircraft.\" On July 20, 1996, there was another report of a skyquake over OrangeCounty, California that occurred around 3 p.m. the same time as theJanuary 13, 2003 skyquake in Pensacola, and some of the other skyquakereports suggesting a repeating schedule in whatever the source is.Several military insiders think the skyquakes are caused by the TOP"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"SECRET Aurora aircraft which has been talked about for a decade, buthas never been officially revealed to the public.
