Five miles further northeast ofMildenhall is RAF Lakenheath, an American USAF facility with nuclear missiles.RAF Mildenhall, England, 100th Air Refueling Wing, USAF.November 3, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Around the summer solstice of June 22,2003, at Royal Air Force Mildenhall in England, USAF security guards on nightshift werealerted that a bright, unidentified light was approaching restricted airspace at the baserunway. One of the security guards that night recently contacted me. He had enlisted in theU. S. Air Force in 2000, had trained in the Air Traffic Technical School and was stationedat Langley AFB, Virginia, in Security Forces. In August 2002, he received orders to workat RAF Mildenhall, about 25 miles northeast of Cambridge.[ Editor’s Note: Royal Air Force Mildenhall - The United States Air Forceactivated the 100th Air Refueling Wing, host wing at RAF Mildenhall, UnitedKingdom, on February 1, 1992. From the time of its reactivation, the 100thARW has served as the lone air refueling wing for U.S. Air Forces in Europe.The diverse mission of aerial refueling, special operations, air mobility,reconnaissance and intelligence makes RAF Mildenhall a unique U.S. AirForce base.]Mildenhall is headquarters for the 100th Air Refueling Wing that supports the USAF andother NATO ally countries.

As the host wing, the 48thFighter Wing is also designated the Air Force’s Statue of Liberty Wing -making it the only wing with both a numerical designation and an officialname. The Liberty Wing has nearly 5,700 active-duty military members, 2,000British and U.S. civilians, and includes a geographically separated unit atnearby RAF Feltwell. In addition to supporting three combat-ready squadronsof F-15E Strike Eagle and F-15C Eagle fighter aircraft, the Liberty Winghouses the 56th Rescue Squadron’s HH-60G Combat Search and Rescuehelicopters. RAF Lakenheath is the largest U.S. Air Force-operated base inEngland and the only U.S. Air Forces in Europe (USAFE) F-15 fighter wing.]What happened at RAF Mildenhall on June 22, 2003, around 9 p.m. local time, was themost dramatic incident of the American security guard's four-year career in the Air Force.He agreed to talk with me for Earthfiles and radio, provided I did not use his name orcurrent location.Interview:Former USAF Security, RAF Mildenhall near Cambridge, Suffolk County, England:\"I worked the night shift in security forces. My main job was patrolling the installation,securing the perimeter. We were responsible for law enforcement activities on theinstallation as well. Primarily that evening, we were on a little bit more of a high alertbecause we did have an F-117 stealth fighter from Holloman AFB, New Mexico. It wasstopped over for the night. So, our security level goes up a little bit when we have ahigh-protection asset like that. We made daily rounds and patrols of the airfield.At approximately 21:00 hours in the evening (9 p.m. local time), we started getting phonecalls to the law enforcement desk from people off base (civilians). They said they saw astrange object in the sky hovering out near the base. Sometimes locals did call in and saythey saw crazy things. We have a lot of operations happening in the night with helicopters,so everyone (on base) assumed the locals were talking about the helicopter landing lights orsomething like that. We did have helicopters flying that night.Probably about a half hour later, I got a call from the second member of my team, AlphaFlight. The kid was saying that he saw something on the approach end of the runway aboutfive miles out. So we headed out to take a look. When we got there, we saw a bright objectin the sky, a lot brighter than a landing light of any helicopter or plane. The light waspulsating from blue to green and then back to kind of white, almost a translucent kind ofpulsing. Kind of hard to explain, to put into words exactly what it was doing.After that, we saw the object was gone right then. It kind of just before our eyes lookedlike it vaporized, disappeared. I don’t really have any words for what it did.At that point we headed back to the other guys to discuss what we saw and we went intothe Radar Approach Control. On the radar, the Air Traffic Controllers had an unidentifiedcontact. One of my friends who was an Air Traffic Controller who happened to reside inthe barracks where I lived said that at the same time we saw this thing (at the far end of therunway), they had identified contact on radar. They had tried to establish frequency, the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"protocol how they do it. You try to establish on a certain frequency, identify the aircraft. Atthat point, the object was not in restricted air space. It was not into our Mildenhall air spaceyet. Unidentified Aerial Light EnteredMildenhall Restricted Air SpaceWhile we were there, the Air Traffic Controllers had not identified contact and the phonecalls started coming in from engine mechanics and other people working the flight line thatthe object was back. Now, it was in fact within our air space. It was about 3.5 miles off theapproach end of the runway.At that point our security level was heightened. At the point, the Security ForcesCommander decided that since Air Traffic Control was trying to make contact with it andreceived no response; they tried on an emergency frequency and received no response. Theunidentified aircraft, or whatever it was, showed up as a return on radar and it woulddisappear from radar while the object was still visible to people outside. A lot of guys sawit. There were jet mechanics working late on aircraft.At that point, one of my friends who was an air traffic controller said that three helicopterpilots out doing maneuvers did see the aircraft. They had visual contact in the air and sodid several other security force members. At that point, we left the radar facility, the tower,and we headed out to the approach end of the runway.We got to the approach end of the runway and there it was, the same object as before,pulsating blue to green, green to white. Not moving. Stationary. One thing I noticed aboutthis object that was peculiar at first. It was so bright, but when it did pulsate back down to abluish color, you could make out a silhouette almost. I, being trained to look for differentkinds of aircraft, I was looking for any type of warning lights on the aircraft, on thewingtips, any type of beacon light. But there was nothing. Large Triangular CraftIt did have shape to it, did have form. The closest I could describe the shape wouldprobably be like almost like a triangle. It was like – it almost kind of looked like if Icompared it to any aircraft that we had – maybe like one of the F-117s, one of the stealths.But it was way beyond that. Besides, no F-117 or any other aircraft can hover withoutmaking a noise! Yeah, no sound – that was weird, too. If it had been a helicopter that close,you would really have heard the rotor wash from the rotor.F-117 Nighthawk.HOW BIG DO YOU ESTIMATE IT WAS?At first I could not tell. But the object did start moving closer to us. It did start coming incloser. I think as long as we were looking at it and no one realized it was getting closer.When it got into about 1.5 miles at that point, I had no reference to compare it to, but fromseeing other aircraft up in the air I would say probably about the size of one of our tankerjets – about the size of a KC-135, which is equivalent to a civilian 767.THAT’S HOW LONG?Those aircraft are over 100 feet. I would say that the aerial object was definitely over 100feet long and over 50 feet wide.[ Editor’s Note:767 AirlinerWing span is 47.57m (156ft 1in), length 48.51m (159ft 2in), height 15.85m(52ft 0in). Wing area 283.3m2 (3050sq ft).Source: Wings of the Web http://www.airliners.net/info/stats.main?id=103Nighthawk F-117"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"First flown in 1981, the F-117 was kept secret until its first operational use in1989 in Panama. The F-117's minimal radar cross-section and ability to dropprecision ordnance place it in a class by itself. Also known as the \"Wobblin'Goblin,\" the Night Hawk flew 1,271 sorties during Operation Desert Storm in1991, achieving an 80% mission success rate while suffering no losses or battledamage.The designation \"F-117\" does not fit in the logical \"F number\" series whichwas restarted at F-1 in 1962 with 11 then-current fighters being redesignated. The USAF had allocated F-112 through F-116 to Soviet fighters acquiredthrough various means. One theory is that the Night Hawk was designatedF-117 to draw less attention.Source: Military Analysis Network: http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/ac/f-117.htm ]SO, THIS WAS A LARGE TRIANGULAR SHAPE THAT WAS HOVERING?It was weird! It was triangular when it was not pulsating the brightest. When it waspulsating at the brightest again, it looked like it was just a light. It did not look like it hadany mass or shape to it. When the light would pulsate again to another color, then youcould see the shape of it.HOW LONG DID IT STAY PULSING IN ANY GIVEN COLOR?I’d say it was about three second intervals.IF I WERE STANDING OUT THERE, I WOULD SEE IT BE WHITE FOR THREESECONDS, BLUE FOR THREE SECONDS, GREEN FOR THREE SECONDS ANDBACK TO WHITE FOR THREE SECONDS?At first, yes. As the object got closer to us, the pulsating times got shorter and it almost wasnot pulsating anymore. I wouldn’t say it changed color. It was like melting from one colorto another, like fading into one color from another.AS IF THE PULSING WERE SPEEDING UP?Yes, the closer it got it speeded up. I then heard fighter aircraft, F-15s. Later, I came to findout that after they (Air Traffic Controllers) could not establish contact with the object,fighter jets from Lakenheath five miles away were scrambled to identify the object fromthe air. There orders were it had to be removed from our airspace.American F-15 Eagles.At that time, when I heard the F-15s getting closer, as we looked at this object, the objectseemed to react, I guess, to the sound of the jets coming closer.As the F-15s got closer, we could hear them coming closer, the object’s pulsating increasedand the object started to back off from the Mildenhall facility. Right as the F-15s werecoming over our air space, the object made a couple of erratic maneuvers: vertical, backdown vertical, horizontal, very quick, very smooth. No sound. At that point, it faded awayagain the same way it did earlier in the evening, disappeared, vaporized, I don’t know.Then we saw the F-15s come into our pattern, noticed the lights from the F-15s. They werecircling our air space at that point. That was it for the sighting of the object. Lakenheath Nuclear Missile OperationsShut Down After Radar Lock On Triangular CraftAfterward, we had to go to debriefing. The base was on heightened alert. I came to find out"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"afterward that the installation next door, Lakenheath, I guess from people I know in theSecurity Forces Squadron over there, some of their systems were compromised concerningthe nuclear weapons. I don’t know the details of what happened, but it all correlated at thesame time this object was in between our facilities. [ Editor's emphasis.]I’VE HAD OTHER REPORTS FROM PEOPLE IN THE MILITARY ABOUT LOCKINGON TO UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS, OR BOGIES. IN ONE CASE THAT IREPORTED ABOUT RECENTLY, WHEN THE LOCK ON WAS DONE WITH ADOPPLER TYPE OF RADAR, THERE WAS APPARENTLY RETALIATION ON THEPART OF THE UNIDENTIFIED. ALL OF THE POLARITY IN ALL OF THE RADAREQUIPMENT ...Was reversed.RIGHT, WAS REVERSED. EVERYTHING SHUT DOWN. A LOT OF IT WASDAMAGED. DID THIS SAME THING HAPPEN AT LAKENHEATH?From what I’m told by some of the people there, I don’t know except the radar on theobject that came into our airspace did lock on to that object. The F-15s would have hadradar locked on to it as soon as they took off. Approximately the same time, the systemswere compromised. I guess some of the powering systems went down. The back-ups werenot responding where the nuclear weapons were secured. That’s as far as I know.SO SPECIFICALLY, THE EQUIPMENT THAT WAS EFFECTED WAS THE NUCLEARMISSILE AREA AT RAF LAKENHEATH?Yes, from what I know, there were no other systems on that facility affected that nightexcept for the security equipment pertaining to the nuclear weapons.SO, IF THERE WAS ANY COMMUNICATION ON THE PART OF THEINTELLIGENCE INSIDE OF THE MYSTERIOUS TRIANGLE, IT WOULD BE ‘IHAVE THE POWER TO SHUT DOWN YOUR NUCLEAR FACILITY?’Yeah, if you think about it, you could look at it that way. Something is saying, ‘Hey, anytime we want.’ But if that were the message, it would be a pretty understood message. Unidentified Aerial TriangleSimilar to Belgium UFOHAVE YOU SEEN ANY PHOTOGRAPHS THAT RESEMBLE WHAT YOU SAWABOVE THE MILDENHALL AFB IN 2003?Yes, actually I saw a photograph on the computer that resembled the object when it wasnot brightly lit. It was over Belgium, I think. It was the same triangular type object. Itlooked really similar to that. Left: F-117 American Nighthawk stealth fighters. Right: The Belgium UFOtriangle was photographed at an unknown location in Belgiumon November 29, 1989, by unknown source. False Official Explanation:\"NATO Training Exercise\"DID YOU EVER SIGN A NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT ABOUT THATINCIDENT BETWEEN MILDENHALL AND LAKENHEATH?No, I never signed any type of agreement. The only thing we signed was anacknowledgement that we received a (NATO) training exercise.THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A TRAINING EXERCISE?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Ye s .SO, YOU HAD TO SIGN A PAPER THAT WAS A LIE?Ye s .AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU NEVER SIGNED A NON-DISCLOSUREAGREEMENT AND THE ONLY PAPER YOU WERE GIVEN TO SIGN WAS A LIE,WHY DO YOU FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE USING YOUR REAL NAME AND YOURMILITARY RECORD AND BACKGROUND TO TELL THIS STORY?Scared. (laughs) Not to be laughed at. I know a lot of guys in the military who haveexperienced the same things, but there are a lot of people who are still ignorant to what ishappening and would rather laugh at you and say you are an idiot, you’re not qualified,you don’t know what you are talking about. Embarrassment. I haven’t really told the storybefore, except to some of the guys who were there with me.SO, IT’S REALLY MORE A FEAR OF YOUR FELLOW MALE COLLEAGUES THANIT IS EVEN FROM SOME GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY CLAMPING DOWN ONYOU?Yes, more so. The possibility is always there that someone could in the government. But Idon’t think they would waste their time. I think they count on that – they count on otherpeople laughing at other people. That’s kind of their weapon, I think.IN OTHER WORDS, THE GOVERNMENT COUNTS ON THE RIDICULE FACTOR OFHUMAN-TO-HUMAN KEEPING EVERYTHING UNDER WRAPS?Absolutely! Especially guys in the military. We’re trained to do something and not to lookweak in front of each other. Definitely.WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS GOING TO TAKE TO CHANGE THIS POLICY OFDENIAL?I don’t think it will ever change. I don’t think there’s anything anyone can do, nothing shortof one of these things landing in downtown Times Square! (laughs) I don’t think it willchange.WONDER WHY THE INTELLIGENCE ITSELF DOESN’T JUST DO THAT?My answer? I heard a scientist say once, ‘Would you bother explaining your day to an anthill?’ People have no concept, no understanding – whatever these things are I believe theyare so far beyond us, so outside the scope of our understanding. Policy of Denial About UFOs/ExtraterrestrialsDID ANY OF YOU GET A SPECIFIC DEBRIEFING FROM ANY SUPERIOROFFICERS ABOUT THIS INCIDENT IN THE CONTEXT OF UFOS,INTERPLANETARY, OTHER INTELLIGENCES, ANY OF THAT KIND OF SUBJECTMATTER?Afterwards, we were debriefed by OSI, Office of Special Investigations. The word ‘UFO’did come up once from one of the investigators, kind of in a joking manner trying to makeit lighthearted, I guess. Like, ‘If you guys thought you saw a UFO tonight, tell me about it.’That’s the only time that word came up from anybody with power.The only thing I have to say about it that upsets me the most is how we were treated afterthe incident by our own superiors. We were treated like we were ignorant. Afterwards afew days later, we were told that it was an exercise, a NATO exercise to determine thesecurity at the installation and what we were witnessing was a helicopter with landinglights. All of us laughed about it because we’re not idiots! We know what a helicopterlanding light is and this was not it. That was probably the most upsetting. The other guysI’ve talked to be told that is a basic flat out lie to your face.AND YOU HAD DESCRIBED WATCHING THIS OBJECT WITH YOUR OWN EYESMOVING RAPIDLY VERTICALLY UP, VERTICALLY DOWN, RIGHT, LEFT AND INDOING SO IN A SPEED THAT NO TERRESTRIAL HELICOPTER COULD DO.No, and being in helicopters a lot and aircraft a lot, an object moving like that – if we didhave an object that could move like that – whatever human occupants were insidewouldn’t survive that! (laughs) The G-Forces alone looked to me like unreal. No one would"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"be able to survive that.It was hard because someone joining the military wanting to protect the country and do theright thing and be a stand up guy, it’s tough when you think you’re doing the right thing andpeople treat you like you don’t matter.DID ANYBODY TALK WITH YOU OFF THE RECORD ABOUT THE GOVERNMENTHAVING KNOWLEDGE OF AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL PRESENCE IN THESEOBJECTS?No. A couple of pilots I talked to that I know from the Air Force said they’ve hadencounters with things in the air, but it was more like guys hanging out after work at thebar.SO, IN YOUR MILITARY CAREER, DID YOU EVER HAVE A DISCUSSION ON OROFF THE RECORD WITH ANYONE SPECIFICALLY ABOUT ANEXTRATERRESTRIAL INTELLIGENCE INTERACTING WITH OUR PLANET? Area 51, Groom Lake, Nellis AFB, NevadaYes. It was off the record. It was with a couple of security forces, individuals that I knewthat I went to initial training with, who are stationed out in Nevada at the Groom Lakearea, the test facility. They said they saw a lot of weird things and them having a TOPSECRET clearance only had access to the outer perimeter of the installation for security.They were never allowed inside any of the research facilities. One of the guys who worksthere believes something extraterrestrial was probably going on. Research on differentkinds of craft and things of that nature. But it was never on the record.DID ANYBODY EVER TELL YOU THAT SECURITY GUARDS AT AREA 51 HADDISAPPEARED?I heard rumors of that because after I got out of the service, I myself got a job on agovernment contract under the Department of Energy at the Nevada Test Site, pretty muchdoing similar work that I did in the military. I only remained there for about six months. Iwanted to come back to the East Coast. The things I was exposed to out there (Area 51), Ijust wasn’t comfortable. So, I decided to leave, but I did hear a lot of rumors and talk. Thearea we were responsible for is roughly the size of Rhode Island. So, it was a lot ofperimeter to patrol! We were responsible for the border of Groom Lake. Well, weinteracted with other security from there contracted under Dynacorp. We were contractedunder Wackenhut. A couple of the guys we talked to out there heard rumors not so muchabout disappearing, but guys being sick.They would tell you one thing, ‘Oh, there’s nothing to worry about out here.’ There wasone area saying ‘Radiation exposure’ and on the other side, they are saying, ‘No, it’s fine.’We had to wear dosimeters at work. Things like that. Your boots having to be shaken outwhen you left work. After about six months of that, I had enough.WHAT I UNDERSTAND IS THAT THE MEN YOU REFERRED TO BEING SICK ARESICK FROM RADIATION POISONING?No one was really sure about what they are sick from. From what I heard from people isthey developed a scab thing, almost like a psoriasis or shingles kind of disease, but no oneis really sure.DID ANYBODY SPECULATE ABOUT WHAT THE CAUSE MIGHT BE?Chemicals or some type of unknown exposure to something out there at the Groom Laketest facility. But at the same time, there were a lot of scientists were ill at the Nevada TestSite as well. I was still in the process of obtaining my government Q Clearance while I wasthere, so I didn’t really have access to a lot more than just TOP SECRET clearance that Ialready had for the military (USAF).BUT IT’S FAIR TO SAY THAT AMONG SOME OF THE SECURITY PEOPLE THATYOU WERE ABLE TO TALK WITH, THEY SEEMED TO HAVE KNOWLEDGEABOUT SOME KIND OF UFO/EXTRATERRESTRIAL CONNECTION TO AREA 51?Oh, yeah. Absolutely!\"More Information:For further information about UFOs and military, please see reports below in the Earthfiles"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Archives:• 10/28/2006 -- Close UFO Encounter by USAF Eyewitnesses• 10/19/2006 -- UFO Retaliation to U.
