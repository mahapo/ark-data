March 8, 2003 Corguinho, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil - On November 24,2001, a farmer named Tulio Alves Costa who has lived on the eastern side ofCorguinho, Brazil's big mesa for twenty-four years, saw mysterious, bright, whitelights he estimates were about six inches long move in the air over his landthroughout the day. Eventually after sunset, at least one of the small lights grewvery large. Tulio, not understanding what was happening, called his friendUrandir Oliveira on the other side of the mesa to come see. Urandir and severalothers from the farm arrived when it was dark and could clearly see the large,glowing white light. At 8:30 p.m., the light kept expanding and seemed toexplode near the eastern slope of the mesa above Tulio's farm.The next day, the group made the rough climb with machetes up the steep sideof the mesa toward the area they estimated the light had exploded. Eventually,amid the humid, tropical plants, they found a tree broken in two. The fallensection was smoldering from the inside of the trunk. Tulio, Urandir and the restof the group - including an American scientist originally from Brazil - all beganto itch, felt nauseous and their eyes reddened and teared so much that they leftthe land. Tulio waited several days before trying to return with Urandir, FelipeBranco, and the American scientist who requests anonymity, but has confirmedhe was there, found radioactivity and has continued to research the explosionsite over the past year. Plants around the broken tree were scorched, insects andmushrooms were suddenly a red color not seen before, three of Tulio's calvesand a cow died and two other calves went blind.Interviews:On left, Urandir Oliveira, with Tulio Alves Costa, on February 15, 2003,Corguinho, M.G.

Translators: Luciano Didier and Felipe Brancoon February 15, 2003: \"As long as Tulio has been on his farm, there hasalways been some manifestation of strange lights and phenomena. And on thisdate (November 24, 2001), and a few days before, there were some small lightsappearing on his farm during the day.COLOR?Very bright, white lights. He did not know what they were."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHAT WERE THE SIZE?Small ones, about this size. (Tulio held up his hands and made an oval about 6inches in diameter.)LIKE EGGS?No, like circles. They were far away, so maybe they were actually bigger inphysical size, but he's showing how they appeared to him from where he wasworking on the farm.He knew that something was increasing beyond his knowledge and he wasscared about what was going on, so he called Urandir. (Oliveira at his farmabout 10 kilometers from Tulio's farm on the western side of the big mesa.)WERE THE LIGHTS DIFFERENT COLORS?There were several different colors: violet, golden. Changing colors constantly.LIKE PULSING LIGHTS?No, very still, not pulsating, and suddenly one opens with a very bright color asif the light spreads and then like an explosion, but NO SOUND. Like a lightexpanding outwards very quickly.HOW BIG?He cannot calculate, more than 15 meters.IS IT HIGH IN THE SKY OR LOW?High in the sky, a good height.SO THIS IS A LIGHT THAT IS MORE DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING HEHAS SEEN IN THE PAST?It was the biggest, the size, he had never seen anything so big. It expanded, thisbig bright light, and then exploded and disappeared.WHERE IT EXPLODED WAS, TO HIS EYES, OVER WHERE WE CLIMBEDUP YESTERDAY?Exactly there where we climbed. The next day they tried to get close to the area,but they couldn't because there was too much radiation.SO YOU SAW THE EXPLOSION AND IT'S NIGHT AND YOU COULD NOTCLIMB UP THERE IN THE DARK?Right.Our February 14, 2003, long, steep, hike up the east side of the big Corguinho mesainto the thick forest to collect physical evidence where a tree broke in two afterthe large light exploded silently at 8:30 p.m. on November 24, 2001.Photograph © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Urandir Oliveira cutting down thick vines and plant growthto clear a path on February 14, 2003, as he, Tulio and others did beforeon November 25, 2001, to get to the exploded tree on the east side of the bigCorguinho mesa. Photograph © 2003 Linda Moulton Howe.YOU WAITED UNTIL THE NEXT DAY AND WHAT HAPPENED?It was around 2 p.m., Tulio and everyone tried to walk up on the mesa to wherethey estimated the light had exploded. After three hours, the group finally foundthe broken, or exploded, tree but they became worried about radiation.HEAT?No, tingling and scratching over the whole body, itching like an allergy. Thebody became red and irritated and the eyes were like crying. And the baby cattlewent blind and some died.HOW MANY DIED?Four, three baby cattle and one cow. And two went blind.THE SCIENTIST CONFIRMED RADIOACTIVITY?Ye s .HOW LONG DID IT TAKE FROM NOVEMBER 24 UNTIL THEY COULDGO THERE AND NOT HAVE BURNING EYES?12 days.WAS THE BROKEN TREE THEN WARM TO TOUCH?No, no heat.Above, the shattered tree trunk still rooted in the mesa soil.Below, the section of the tree that fell onto plants several feet below and burnedinside for approximately 4 feet 9 inches, but there was no evidence of burning on theoutsideof the fallen trunk on February 14, 2003.

But meteors don't keep flying in thesky. And it could be a piece of a satellite. But then when they realized the redmushrooms, the measured radioactivity, the cattle blind and dead, so they knewit was not a piece of a satellite.THE RED MUSHROOMS SHOWED UP HOW LONG AFTER NOVEMBER24?4 or 6 days, about a week.Red mushrooms still growing on February 14, 2003,in the vicinity of the November 24, 2001, exploded tree.Photograph © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe.Melted rock found near broken tree after the November 24, 2001,light explosion on the east side of the big mesa.

They killed them.WHERE WERE THE INSECTS?Some were taken to the (American scientist's lab for analysis. Results andphotos will be upcoming.)HOW LONG DID INSECTS STAY RED THERE?They could see this strange influence on insects for about a week.SINCE NOVEMBER 24, 2001, HOW MANY MORE LIGHTS HAVE COMEAROUND TULIO'S FARM?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"About four or five times more. Right at the same mountain where we wereyesterday. He saw lights again in November 2002.DO THE LIGHTS HAVE A SPECIFIC SHAPE?Round. The particular one that caught Tulio's attention was quite remarkablebecause at first he thought it was the light of a car and he was thinking there wassomeone with a car approaching. Then this light became much bigger andstopped moving low to the ground and went up to the sky and then went up theside of the mesa and it was really bright and very big. Huge!DOES TULIO SEE LIGHTS EVERY THREE OR FOUR MONTHS?It's very irregular he doesn't know. Sometimes he sees them twice or three timesin the same month. Sometimes it appears later after three or four months. For 24years, he has owned this farm. He bought it from another person and the personwho he bought the farm from told him about the lights that used to happen onthis farm, so this has occurred for a long time.HAS HE EVER FELT AFRAID OF ANY OF THE LIGHTS?No, never. Except he didn't know why some of the small lights were gettingbigger (on November 24, 2001.)HAS HE EVER SEEN ANYTHING COME OUT OF THE LIGHTS?No. Nothing coming out from them. Large, Hairy Creature On Tulio's Farm in 1996HAS HE EVER SEEN ANY KIND OF BEINGS ANYWHERE ON HIS FARM?Not Tulio, but someone who worked for him about seven years ago went tocheck on palm trees and this man saw a creature that was hairy and bigger than acow and he was so afraid he couldn't pull his gun. He had never seen such athing and it had big eyes.FELIPE: He had his dogs with him and was pointing for the dogs to go after thebeing. But the dogs would not. He thought 'This thing is much more powerfulthan me' and if I shoot him and he is more powerful than this bullet then hecomes after me.'CAN HE DRAW WHAT HIS WORKER SAW?No because he did not see it. But it was like the size of a cow not the shape butbig and hairy, very hairy with big eyes. It was not a monkey. A monkey wouldnever be that size.ANYTHING ABOUT THE EYES?No details, except very big. He was scared.WHAT ABOUT TULIO? WOULD HE LIKE TO SEE ANY OF THE BEINGS?He would love to see them.WHY DOES HE THINK HE HAS NOT SEEN THEM?He went to this same spot to see the big hairy creature. He wanted to see it, buthe couldn't find it.THE BIG HAIRY BEING.Yes. He wanted the worker to go with him, but the worker was too scared anddid not want to go with him."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"DID HE FIND ANY TRACKS?It was a year later that he went back to the place.WHY DIDN'T HE GO BACK IMMEDIATELY?There was a time when it was raining a lot. He says his neighbors witnessed thisbig light that came up from the same spot where this happened and flew over abig mango tree that they have and went into the hill opposite his house.SO, THE LIGHT CAME OUT OF THE GROUND WHERE THE BIG HAIRYCREATURE WAS SEEN?URANDIR, DO YOU KNOW HOW THE LIGHTS GO IN AND OUT OF THEMESA?Plasma interacting with the matter. Didn't I go through the ceiling?\" Continued in Part 6.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
