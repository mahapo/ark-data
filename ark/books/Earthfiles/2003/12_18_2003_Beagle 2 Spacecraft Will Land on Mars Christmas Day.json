C. - NASA Science News has released astory worth sharing about next Thursday's projected landing of the Beagle 2spacecraft on Mars. NASA begins: \"It's wintertime in the northern hemisphere ofMars and a flying saucer is about to land.\"Back on Earth where it came from, the craft is known as the Beagle 2, sent toMars by the European Space Agency (ESA) in search of life. More accurately,the Beagle 2 will be looking for chemical traces of life - telltale signs that lifeonce existed, or perhaps, exists right now on the red planet. Named after theship that carried Charles Darwin, the Beagle 2 is a self-contained laboratoryshaped like a saucer, or a pocket watch, about three feet in diameter that canspread out its solar panels. Although it carries many powerful scientific tools, itweighs a mere 70 pounds. Being so light and compact, the Beagle 2 was able tohitch a ride to Mars onboard the ESA's Mars Express spacecraft launched lastJune 2003.Artist's conception of Beagle 2, on the ground.

'The rock abrasion tool goes right upagainst a rock, removes its weathered surface, and can continue to go in and takeout a little core - about 20 to 100 milligrams of sample,' says Everett Gibson,NASA's interdisciplinary scientist for the Mars Express/Beagle 2 mission. Theability to remove the surface of a rock is important, as scientists learned whenNASA's Sojourner rover scrutinized Martian rocks in 1997. They all lookedmuch the same because their surfaces had been weathered by dusty winds andsolar radiation. Beagle 2 will be able to sample the minerals inside.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Beagle 2 rover will dig for signs of water andmicrobial life. Image courtesy Beagle 2. Beagle 2's Search for Carbon-12 and Methane on MarsBeagle 2's other tool called 'the mole' is able to reach as far as two meters (6.5feet) from Beagle 2 and drill down about 1.5 meters to gather samples back intoits shallow 'mouth.' Just like the cored samples from surface rocks, soil collectedfrom underground will have been shielded from solar ultraviolet radiation. Inthose more protected samples, life of some kind might have more easilydeveloped. Collected soil will go into the Beagle 2's lab oven where releasedgases will be analyzed by a mass spectrometer. Beagle 2 will look at the types ofcarbon ranging from lighter carbon-12 to heavier carbon-13.NASA says, \"On Earth, things that are alive tend to prefer the lighter carbon anduse more carbon-12 in their metabolism. If the spectrometer identifies a samplecontaining more carbon-12 than would be expected in an inorganic sample ofsoil, that might be a sign that life had once dwelled there.\"The spectrometer will also check the atmosphere for traces of methane. Thatgas can be produced by living creatures. On Earth, it comes from termites, cowsand swamps. If Beagle 2 detects any methane on Mars, something must havecreated it recently since the strong ultraviolet radiation that shines on Marswould destroy methane in a matter of months.\"If Beagle 2 finds methane, there's a good chance that biological processes areoperating on Mars.
