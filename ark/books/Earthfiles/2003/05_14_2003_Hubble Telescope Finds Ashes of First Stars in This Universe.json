May 14, 2003 Garching, Germany - The Hubble Space Telescope-EuropeanCoordinating Facility and European Southern Observatory in Garching,Germany, near Munich, announced in April 2003 that Hubble has discoveredwhat might be the \"ashes\" from the first stars in this universe. The powerfultelescope found significant iron in the light from primordial quasars only 900million years old. The theory is that the iron is the residue, the ashes, of firstgeneration stars that formed perhaps as early as 200 million years after the BigBang and then died in supernova explosions that produced all the iron laterrecycled into the quasars. According to Wolfram Freudling who led the Hubbleresearch, 200 million years for first star births is much earlier than previouslythought.Quasars are a paradox: they are some of the brightest objects in the universe, butalso the oldest and most distant. That's why astrophysicists hypothesize thattheir immense power must come from supermassive black holes in their centersthat eat away at matter and convert it into energy that we can \"see\" with theHubble Telescope. The universe's birth was probably 13 billion years ago.Quasars emerged in the early first billion years and astrophysicists think they gettheir extremely intense energy and brightness from massive black holes at theircenters. An unresolved question is: which came first - the stars or black holes?Freudling's team focused Hubble on three primordial quasars going back in timeto at least 12.8 billion years ago. The spectra showed large amounts of iron.Assuming the heavy metal was first produced in the first suns to light up the newand expanding universe, no one has ever before seen such early elements."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"At the center of each image above is one of the remote quasars studied by WolframFreudling'sEuropean Southern Observatory team in Germany.
