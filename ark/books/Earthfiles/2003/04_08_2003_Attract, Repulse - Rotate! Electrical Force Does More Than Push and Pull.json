Electrical ForceDoes More Than Push and Pull© 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe \"We have only looked at the electrostatic case. We have no magneticfields here, nothing is moving, there is no current, only the chargessitting stationary on these conducting metal spheres. So, what weobserve is just action of charges causing this rotation of the spheres.\"- Anders Wistrom, Ph.D., Univ. of California-RiversideApril 8, 2003 Riverside, California - War and disease are not the only forcesof change in the world around us. This week, even electricity was updated. TheUniversity of California, Riverside sent out a news release entitled, \"UCRiverside researchers' discovery of electrostatic spin challenges century-oldtheory. New physical phenomenon will likely impact atomic physics, chemistryand nanotechnology.\"The scientists who have discovered electrostatic rotation are Anders Wistrom,Ph.D., and Armik Khachatourian, Ph.D. Their work has been published in boththe Journal of Mathematical Physics and Applied Physics Letters and showsthat when a direct current voltage is applied to three metal spheres suspendedwithout friction, the spheres begin to rotate. This newly documentedphenomenon has been named \"electrostatic rotation.\"This was a surprise and could not be explained by available theory. Since LordKelvin in the 19th Century postulated his ideas about electrical potentialsurrounding charged objects, no one apparently had questioned that he mightnot have the whole story. Now, the UC-Riverside team's revelation could changethe way we look at atoms, molecules and maybe even propulsion systems.Dr. Wistrom told me today that in their laboratory, he puts one metal sphere ona stand that can be charged with DC voltage. Then he hangs two more metalspheres by thin plastic or metal wire so that the three spheres are in a triangleformation with each other. As long as the DC voltage is applied to the sphere onthe stand, the other two free-hanging spheres will rotate into a new position.The spheres will keep rotating until the wires holding the metal spheres stiffenand prevent further rotation. What would happen if the wires weren't there? Photograph of experimental assembly with stainless-steel spheres.

Photographs © 2002 by Anders Wistromand Armik Khachatourian.Interview:Asst. Professor Anders Wistrom, Ph.D., Dept. of Chemical andEnvironmental Engineering, University of California - Riverside,Riverside, California: \"Once we turn on the current, what we note then is thatthe spheres begin to twist in one orientation or another. Then after some time,we will have a slight oscillation and they will find a new position that is offsetfrom the original one.We have only looked at the electrostatic case. We have no magnetic fields here,nothing is moving, there is no current, only the charges sitting stationary onthese conducting metal spheres. So, what we observe is just action of chargescausing this rotation of the spheres.WHY IS THIS AN UNEXPECTED RESULT?The result itself, when one considers that it's just a symmetry of charges on thesurface, it appears very intuitive that this would happen. However, over the last100 years or so, it has been stated that the direction of the electric field isperpendicular to the surface of the conductor. With that assumption, it followsthat any rotation cannot take place. So, the question is: why was this assumptionmade in the first place and why has it persisted for so long?Of course, it's difficult to read the minds of these giants in science that camebefore us, like Thompson and Maxwell and these innovators of enormousimportance to us. But one explanation could be that at the time in themid-1800s, people were not interested, or scientists and engineers were notinterested in electrostatic phenomena. At the time, that was mainly parlor games you can push the comb through your hair and you can lift small objects and itwas a nice conversation piece. At the time, the scientific interest was to unify thetheory of magnetism with electricity and combine that into one unified theory.That at the time was much more important because it had implications forcommunications. The first trans-Atlantic cables were built at that time. WilliamThompson, who later became Lord Kelvin, was instrumental in calculating someof the properties of cables for communications.It was those aspects that were important. The assumption that an electric field isperpendicular to the surface provided a wonderful way where the equationscould be written in vector form and this provided the mathematical tools tounify magnetism with electricity.For our experiments, we built several different experimental set ups using smallmetal spheres ranging in sizes from about 2 centimeters to 25 centimeters indiameter. We suspended them using monofilament nylon in some cases, verythin steel wires in other cases, from the ceiling or from the support of asurrounding box we built specifically for the purpose. In some instances, wesupported one of the spheres with a rigid stand by which we could connect thatsphere to a power supply.THE OTHER TWO SPHERES WERE HUNG TO REDUCE FRICTION?Exactly, strings or very thin metal wires that varied in length maybe from 10centimeters up to a meter.ONLY THE TWO FREE-HANGING SPHERES BEGIN TO ROTATE ANDTHE ONE THAT IS ON THE STAND DOES NOT?Yes, exactly."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHICH WAY DO THOSE SUSPENDED BY THE WIRE OR THREAD GO?In the configuration we have reported in our papers, they go in oppositedirections.A STATEMENT IN THE NEWS RELEASE SAID: \"THE EFFECTS AREPARTICULARLY NOTICEABLE WHEN THE SPHERES ARE VERY CLOSETO ONE ANOTHER.\"Yes. According to the experiments we have done and also according to thecalculations, it appears as though the torque is proportional to the inverse of thedistance to the 4th power.SO, THE CLOSER THEY ARE, THE FASTER THEY SHOULD SPIN.Or the stronger the torque, exactly. Of course, that leads to some experimentalcomplications because if in the laboratory we bring the spheres too closetogether, then we will have current flowing from one sphere to the other. Wehave limitations. We have to have an air gap big enough to prevent that leap ofcurrent.IF THE SPHERES WERE ATTACHED TO SOME SORT OF CYLINDER ORPLATE THAT COULD MOVE AND IF YOU SCALED IT UP TO A LARGERSCALE, IT'S POSSIBLE THAT SPHERES THAT HAD THISELECTROSTATIC CHARGE COULD THEN BEGIN TO ROTATE IN ASYSTEM THAT WAS RELATED TO PROPULSION.It could be possible. I can see very difficult engineering problems in controllingfriction and how to put a device like that together. But in the absence of allother disturbances, yes. Then you would have a motor, if you will.IS THERE ANYTHING IN AN ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELD THAT COULDSUBSTITUTE FOR A WIRE WHERE YOU WOULD BE SUSPENDINGTHEM (SPHERES) IN SOME WAY WITHOUT PHYSICAL MATTER?I don't know. It's a very interesting question that you are asking and I thinkultimately it might be a very important question on how to conduct anexperiment without any physical restraints. Right now, I can't imagine a way todo that. But again, hopefully what we are looking for is more scientists andengineers will be interested in our findings and come up with ideas of thatnature.WHAT KIND OF RESPONSE HAVE YOU HAD FROM OTHER PHYSICISTSAND ENGINEERS AND OTHERS?People have been very curious and congratulatory. I had an e-mail today fromsomeone who is trying to set up their own experiments in their laboratory. Thatto me is maybe the most encouraging that other people are beginning to look atwhat we have done and hopefully can challenge our findings or confirm ourfindings because again, that's how the scientific method works. Good ideassurvive, bad ideas die.WHAT'S THE NEXT BIG STEP FOR YOU?The next big step for me is to work on the mathematical model so we can predictthe magnitude of the force at very close separations, or at any separation.WHEN YOU HAVE FUN IN YOUR MIND THINKING ABOUT HOW THISMIGHT APPLY TO SOMETHING REALLY COOL IN THE FUTURE, WHATDO YOU THINK ABOUT?If we can imagine ourselves being shrunk down to molecular size and we canstart manipulating molecules one at a time to assemble them or to bring themtogether or to react with each other. Those are the things that I have in the backof my mind that may be possible in the future.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"We b s it e s :http://www.engr.ucr.edu/~wistrom/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
