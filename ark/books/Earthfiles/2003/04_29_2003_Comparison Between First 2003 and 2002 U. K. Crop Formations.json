CropFormations© 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe Soberton Heath south of Privett had the first crop formation of 2002,as Privett had the first of 2003. West and East Meon and Petersfield have repeatedlyreceived crop formations since the early 1990s. April 29, 2003 - I remembered that the first English formation last year on April12, 2002, had two small, standing crop circles in its outer ring. They were largerbut similar to the two in the ring surrounding the \"broken 8\" or \"truncatedinfinity symbol\" that is the first English crop formation in 2003. See: Earthfiles04-26-03. I have no idea what the meaning might be, nor what the source oftheir creation is, but thought I would share the comparison in this report.
