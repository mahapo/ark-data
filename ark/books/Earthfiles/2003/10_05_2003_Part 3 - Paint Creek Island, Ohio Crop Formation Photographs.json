The formation isfour miles west of the ancient Seip Mound and about thirty miles from theSerpent Mound. This is the third formation at the mounds in 2003.Paint Creek Island, near Bainbridge in Ross County, Ohio, formationin soybeans about 30 miles from the Serpent Mound pattern - both probably occurredaround same date of August 24, 2003.

Jeffrey Wilson, Independent Crop Formation Investigator, Master'sDegree in General Science, Dexter, Michigan: \"To make the triangle, theplants were actually curved and bent at the proper angle to make the points ofthe triangle. It wasn't as if the plants were laid down flat and then another set ofplants were laid down flat to make that angle of the triangle. The plants werebent in that angle. You can't really bend soybean plants without snapping thestalks. So we found that to be quite convincing.\"Corner of triangle in soybeans."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Close-up triangle corner.At the end of one of the arms, there is a Y-shaped pattern which is also crossedby half an arc. That feature is there and is part of the formation. The arc wasabout three or four feet wide and it started on the western most side and swirledin the direction clockwise to the eastern most side before it just ended. Theplants are curved in on themselves to define the end of that little arc. The armsthemselves are laid down directed toward the edge from the center, and whereall three of those arms meet - that is one of the places where they are woventogether in about four different layers. The thin, half arc on the Y-shaped pattern where soybean plantswere laid down in four different layers woven together.We also discovered the same kinds of leaf base damage that we discovered in theSerpent Mound formation. Again, we don't believe that is a hoaxable effect,although we're still studying the effects on soybeans from certain things and wecouldn't say for 100% sure, but we're pretty certain that's not a hoaxable effect.Leaf base damage in some of the soybean plants laid down in the Paint Creek formation.Some people talk about a 'veil' pattern where there will be single standing stalksof wheat that are separating two circles. That also happened with this PaintCreek one. The triangular circles away from the central circle were down almostto a single line of soybean plants that were still standing, kind of a 'veil' effectthere.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Thin \"veil\" of single row of plants separating the central circle fromthe triangle at the end of one of the formation's three arms.Single soybean plant standing alone in the clockwiseswirl of the Paint Creek island formation.Central circle in the soybean formation, 90 feet in diameter, swirling clockwise."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The southern most arm in the Paint Creek islandformation as it swirls clockwise to the north.Above and below, the south central circle was full of water.One of the formation's \"arms\" of green soybean plants flowsin at right angles over the clockwise swirled center.We b s it e :http://www.cropcirclenews.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund PolicyCopyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
