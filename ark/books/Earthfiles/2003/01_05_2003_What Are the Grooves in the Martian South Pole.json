Carbon dioxide hoar frost freezes out of theatmosphere in the polar winter on the surface. But ten meters below the surface,it's almost exclusively water ice. In the Martian south pole, the icy layereddeposits cover an area much bigger than the actual polar cap.When the first Viking spacecraft flew around Mars in 1976, its photographsfaintly show mysterious grooves across some of the south pole ice. Modernimages from the Mars Global Surveyor show the long, sweeping grooves are atleast 200 kilometers long and 80 to 100 kilometers wide.Long, sweeping grooves at least 200 kilometers long and 80 to 100 kilometers widein the layered deposits of ice and dust at the south polar cap of Mars.Photograph courtesy JPL and Malin Space Science Systems.So far, no one knows what is creating the long, parallel grooves in the southpolar ice. One scientist who has been studying them presented a paper withphotographs at the recent American Geophysical Union meeting in SanFrancisco. He is Zane Crawford, a Ph.D. candidate in Geological Sciences at theUniversity of Colorado, Boulder. In 1998, he received his B. S. in Engineeringand Applied Science from California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. Thisweek I asked him why the grooves are mysterious.Interview:Zane Crawford, Ph.D. Candidate, Geological Sciences, University ofColorado, Boulder, Colorado: \"The grooves are very shallow and they arealmost perfectly in line with each other, but they don't seem to pay much"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"attention to the surrounding topography. When people first saw them, theythought maybe it was an error in the data. These are topographical grooves, sothere are rises and falls of grooves in the mounds of the icy deposits.These three photographs in sequence range from a wide shot of the grooves in the Martiansouth pole, to medium close on two of the parallel grooves, to an extreme close-up of threeof the grooves.Photographs courtesy JPL and Malin Space Science Systems.But it turns out they really are there, and as we got more and more data, theybecame more and more clear. Nobody really has a good idea of what kind ofthings would cause that because we haven't seen that kind of feature on Earthand most of the geophysics we've done on other planets is by analogy to thingswe have seen on Earth.WHAT ARE THE BEST SPECULATIONS?The two hypotheses that we've considered:1) Glacial flows so an ice material flowing by gravity over the surface of the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"layered deposits like you would get in the polar regions here on Earth or icestreams in Antarctica.But there are problems with that.2) The other hypothesis is that they are wind features, Aeolian erosion, polarwinds coming down off the south polar cap headed toward the lower areasaround the layered deposits and eroding as they go along. Could the Grooves Be Carved by Glacier Movement at the Martian South Pole?On Earth, glaciers usually flow on top of rocks or on other non-ice substrates.But this would have to be a glacier flowing on top of something else that ismostly ice, which seems pretty strange. The reasons glaciers flow across rockson Earth is because of gravity, usually going down hill. But these south polarcap grooves on Mars really don't go down hill. They are almost perfectly flat.Then at the edge of the layered deposits, there is a steep drop off, but we don'tsee that they go all the way to that steep drop off. And also, grooves underneathglaciers on Earth are formed because rocks and boulders and other debris arebeing dragged along beneath the ice. But on Mars on these layered deposits,there are no rocks other than meteorites, and there aren't many of them. So, it'snot clear what would cause grooves underneath the glacier.And the temperatures are so low that ice there is as hard as concrete. It doesn'tdeform like ice would here on Earth. Warmer ice is softer than colder ice, sowarmer ice flows more smoothly than colder ice.HOW FLAT IS THE GROOVED REGION?Very flat. It only goes down less than 1 degree of inclination. So, if you weregoing up a well-graded mountain road, that would be much steeper than theslope that these grooves are going down. If you were walking across the surface,you might not even see the grooves. The only reason that we can see them isbecause of the sensitivity of the laser altimeter on the Mars Global Surveyorspacecraft.MEASURING THE CHANGES IN THE ALTITUDE OF VARIOUSF E AT U R E S W I T H A L A S E R T H AT I S AT TA C H E D T O T H E G L O B A LSURVEYOR.Yes. It gives you basically a topographic map. It tells you where it is high andlow.IF IT IS THIS FLAT, THEN THE HYPOTHESIS OF ANY GLACIATION JUSTDOESN'T SEEM TO MAKE ANY SENSE, DOES IT?No, not really. On ice caps like Greenland or Antarctica, you get flow even if itis flat you get flow because ice and snow is being deposited in the center and it'sbreaking away at the edges where it's connected to the oceans. But there is noevidence that there has been any kind of ocean - -at least in the southern portionof Mars. So, glacial flow, we would not expect to see in the southern polarregions on top of these layered deposits. Could High Velocity Winds Be Carving Grooves into the Martian South Pole?Wind if it's a wind feature, then you would expect the wind to deflect aroundobstacles in its path to kind of follow the topography, but it doesn't really seemto do that on the grooves. They just seem to go straight over what ever isunderneath them. The curvature of the grooves, as they go away from the southpole, they curve a bit to the west, which is what you would expect from a windcoming away from a pole on Earth and on Mars and other planets because theplanet is spinning as the wind moves away from the pole to keep its linear speedthe same, it has to change direction. That is called the Coriolis force and it's whya lot of the weather patterns we have on Earth exist, the large scale weather"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"patterns.To get this curvature, you would have to have very high speed winds, over 60 to80 meters per second which is not crazy. There are winds that fast. We've seenevidence of them on Mars. But it's kind of at the upper limits of feasibility.HOW COULD FAST WINDS CARVE PERFECTLY PARALLEL TRACKSTHAT ARE 200 KILOMETERS LONG?This would have to be a wind that is going in the same direction for hundreds ofkilometers without really turning at all, which seems very strange. That's not thekind of thing you would generally see on Earth. If it were just a perfectlyspherical body with nothing operating on it except the Coriolis force, you mightsee that. But there is topography underneath there, beneath the wind. The polarcaps undulate and there is a big scarp at the end of them and kind of downhilloverall. The winds are cutting across a gentle slope which if it were winds goingdown hill, you would expect it to just go down hill, not across the hill.So, both of these hypotheses have pretty serious problems. The truth is we don'treally know what causes these grooves. Could Non-Human Intelligences Be Mining Ice at the Martian South Pole?WHAT ABOUT SOME OTHER INTELLIGENCE IN THE UNIVERSE ORTHE SOLAR SYSTEM THAT IS MINING SOMETHING FROM THE ICE?That's certainly a possible hypothesis, but I don't think anyone would fall backon that until really all possible simple geological explanations had beenexhausted. There is nothing here that really seems to imply anything as complexas another intelligence or life of any kind. It's overall a very simple feature.BUT VERY MYSTERIOUS.But very mysterious, yes. There is no hypothesis that seems to fit all the data wehave about them. But there is a lot of geology even here on Earth that we don'tfully understand. Could the Grooves Be Caused by Liquid Water Flowing at the Martian SouthPole?If you look further up toward the polar cap and there is not very much good datafor right around the south Martian pole because of the orbit the Mars GlobalSurveyor is in. But in some of the old Viking pictures, you can see features thatalmost look alluvial, very sinuous river and channel flow, and some people havespeculated that it might be a liquid outflow over the surface of the ice. Somespring being heated underneath the ice that breaks through the surfaceoccasionally. This happens in Iceland where they have both glaciers andvolcanoes. But it's not the kind of erosion you usually see from liquid flow. Toget the polar caps of Mars warm enough that you would have liquid waterflowing over their surfaces, you would really have to do spectacular things tothe Martian climate that would probably destroy the polar caps altogether. Butthey clearly exist."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Mars Orbital Camera (MOC) view of the Martian south polar residual mesasand pits in frozen carbon dioxide (MOC2-298), December 6, 2001. The portionof the Martian south polar cap that persists through each southern hemisphere summer isknownas the residual cap. In summer, as carbon dioxide is subliming away, the scarps boundingthe pitsand mesas darken with the red Martian soil, suggesting the layered ice and dust melt.Recent Mars Global SurveyorMOC images acquired in 2001 indicate the scarps are retreating an average of 3 meters (3.3yards) per Martianyear and might mean global warming. Photograph courtesy JPL and Malin Space ScienceSystems.Could A Change in the Sun Be Causing Global Warming on Mars?IS THERE ANY DATA THAT MARS IS WARMING UP INCREMENTALLYAS WE ARE SEEING ON THE EARTH THAT IS ATTRIBUTED TO GLOBALWARMING FROM CARBON DIOXIDE HERE. WHAT ABOUT MARS?Interestingly, Mike Malin of Malin Space Sciences, have detected changes in thecarbon dioxide veneer of the south polar cap which seem to change from year toyear. It's not just that there are seasonal changes, but that from the first Martianyear that the spacecraft observed to the second Martian year that the spacecraftobserved, there was an overall loss of carbon dioxide ice. So, over the pastcouple of years at least, there has been a warming of the south Martian polarregions.

But we don't haveenough data about the Martian climate and how it changes over time to be sure.It might be a multi-year cycle that Mars undergoes where dust and iceaccumulates, then sublimates away. It might be because of an obliquity changethat Mars has undergone and its tilt has changed and so it'' having more severeseasonal changes, hotter summers, colder winters. That overall would lead to aloss of ices and volatiles from the polar regions.The Martian climate has changed much more dramatically in the past thanEarth's, it appears. So, it might be just one of the Martian fluctuations. Or, itcould be because of changes in the sun.HAS DR. MIKE MALIN GOTTEN ANY PHOTOGRAPHS PRIOR TO THEONES YOU HAVE BEEN STUDYING OF THIS SOUTH POLE REGION FORCOMPARISON?Prior photographs of the grooves?YES.Well, pretty much all of the pictures I've looked at, except for a couple of Vikingimages, have been from the Mars Orbital Camera which Malin built.SPANNING HOW MANY YEARS?Spanning a little more than 2 Martian years, which is around 4 Earth years.SO NO MORE DATA FROM THE SOUTH POLES ON THESE GROOVEAREAS PRIOR TO ABOUT 4 YEARS AGO?You can see them faintly in a couple of Viking images from the 1970s. But otherthan that, it's all come from Mars Global Surveyor. We're hoping to get newinformation from the Mars Odyssey Spacecraft which just arrived last year. Mars Odyssey Spacecraft Upcoming Photographs Might Help Answer theMysteryWHEN WOULD THOSE IMAGES START COMING BACK?We've gotten some Mars Odyssey pictures from the south pole, but it's not a veryhigh priority observation because they are trying to pick good landing sites forthe mission that is going out later this year. But once they've done observationsthat are critical for future landing missions, they will start taking suggestions forpictures from the general Mars science community and we're hoping we'll getbetter coverage.The resolution of the Mars Odyssey Camera is not as good as the MOC narrowangle. But we'll get much fuller coverage. So, right now, we've got pictures hereand there of various things, but there are a lot of gaps in between. It will be niceto be able to fill in those gaps.WHEN WOULD YOU NEXT EXPECT TO GET PHOTOGRAPHS OF THESOUTH POLE?I would guess there will be significant numbers of pictures from the polarregions within the next year, just because the polar regions are very well coveredcompared to the rest of the planet because the spacecraft are in near polarorbits. They go over the poles every time they make an orbit and their tracks arevery near together at the poles and very spread out near the equator. So, weexpect to get pretty much full coverage of the poles eventually from the Odysseyspacecraft. I think the resolution is about 20 meters per pixel."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD SOLVE THE MYSTERY OF THEGROOVES AT THE SOUTH POLE?I think it will definitely give us a better chance at solving it. Beyond Ice Groove Mysteries, Where Did All the Ancient Martian Water Go?The greatest mystery on Mars right now is: where did the water go? And why didit go there? Mars has a very extreme hydrological history. There is a lot ofwatery features from early in its history. The great Valles Marineris and outflowchannels, the northern plains that look to some like they could have been thefloor of an ancient Martian ocean. But today, the Martian atmosphere is almostcompletely devoid of water. You've got small polar caps and apparently a lot ofpermafrost trapped near the poles underneath the surface. But it's a huge changein the Martian climate that is a little bit scary that planets can change that much.It would be very interesting to know how quickly it changed and what exactly itwas that was driving the change.BECAUSE THE SAME THING MIGHT HAPPEN HERE?Yes, the same kind of thing could happen here. It would be nice to have ageneral idea of how climates change over time, of the changes that can happento planets and the kinds of things that can effect a global climate so we can bemore careful with our own climate if it comes to the point we have the power toinfluence it significantly.IS IT STILL THOUGHT POSSIBLE THAT ALL OF THE WATER THATMIGHT HAVE BEEN ON THE SURFACE OF MARS A COUPLE OFBILLION YEARS AGO COULD STILL BE TRAPPED INSIDE OF THELAYERS OF THE MARTIAN SOIL FOR REASONS THAT ARE NOTKNOWN, BUT COULD ALL THE WATER STILL BE THERE?Well, we know that Mars has lost at least some water. It doesn't have everythingit started with because of the deuterium to hydrogen ratio of the water that stillexists in the atmosphere.There are two different kinds of hydrogen, which is one of the atoms that makesup water. There is hydrogen and deuterium. Hydrogen has one proton in itsnucleus. Deuterium has a proton and a neutron. So, deuterium is about twice asmassive. One of the ways that planets can lose water or other volatiles or gasesfrom their atmospheres is by something called thermal escape. At the very toplayer of the atmosphere, there aren't a lot of molecules. So, as they bouncearound because they are warm, sometimes they will bounce away from theplanet and just happen to never hit another molecule and bounce back. If theyare going fast enough, they will be lost from the planet forever. They don't comeback. This is easier for a light atom like hydrogen, and harder for somethingheavier like deuterium. So over time, you tend to lose more hydrogen thandeuterium.We know about what the ratio was that it started with. We assume it's prettyclose to the ratio that Earth had. So, we look at the ratio in the atmospheretoday and we see an excess of deuterium. There is too much left over deuteriumfor the amount of hydrogen there is. So we assume that it has lost some of itscomplement of hydrogen. The most common molecule on Mars that would havehydrogen in it is water. So, we assume that it has lost a lot of water.COULD THAT HAVE HAPPENED BY THE IMPACT OF SOMETHING LIKEAN ASTEROID OR PLANET HITTING THE PLANET?If you were losing atmosphere because of an impactor, you would expect thatyou would lose about the same amounts of deuterium and hydrogen. Theprocesses that lose hydrogen preferentially tend to be very slow, gradualprocesses that operate over hundreds of millions of years."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"WHAT IF THERE WERE A STRONG IMPACT THAT ACTUALLY EJECTEDWATER ALONG WITH GASES AWAY FROM MARS?We expect this kind of thing has happened in the past. It's called impact erosion,you're eroding the atmosphere away. But you would be losing mostly bulkchunks of the atmosphere, which is well mixed. You would be losing both at thesame time, hydrogen and deuterium.YOU ARE SAYING THAT THE AMOUNT OF DEUTERIUM YOU HAVEBEEN ABLE TO MEASURE IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE INDICATESTHAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE WATER BEFORE?Yes, more water. More water. Venus has undergone the same kind of process.But it's lost virtually all of its water. It has a huge deuterium to hydrogen ratio,whereas the amount of deuterium in the atmosphere on Mars is much closer tothat of the Earth's.VENUS, EARTH AND MARS AT SOME TIME IN THE SOLAR SYSTEMALL HAD WATER?Yes, we think that rocky planets like the terrestrial planets that are close to thesun in our solar system, are born with a fairly large complement of water.BORN WITH, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?When they form out of the nebula of gas and dust that collect around a starwhen it's forming, some of that gas is water vapor and a lot of minerals can takeup a significant amount of water. In their solid form, you've got water not reallydissolved in, but taken up in the mineral structure. Then over time as it heats ona large planet, that water and other volatiles like carbon dioxide can beout-gased and that's a lot of where we think the Earth's atmosphere came from,from out-gasing of volatiles trapped within its interior.WHAT IS THE CURRENT BEST SCIENTIFIC GUESS ABOUT WHATMIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO ALL THE WATER ON MARS?We know it's lost water from thermal escape. We suspect it's lost water fromimpact erosion, from big impacts splattering off bits of its atmosphere. the waterit has today is trapped as ice near the polar regions. there is also sputteringwhich is a process in which almost any constituent, molecule in the atmosphere,can be lost. this is a problem on Mars because it does not have a magnetic fieldlike the Earth does. So, the charged particles streaming off of the sun that wecall the solar wind make it all the way to the top of the atmosphere and can stripoff whatever is near the top over time. The Earth is protected by a magneticfield. Charged particles don't like to cross magnetic field lines. So, they nevermake it to the top of our atmosphere, except sometimes near the poles wherethey follow the lines down to the surface and that's what causes the auroraborealis, the Northern Lights.There are all these processes that have taken place, but we don't really knowwhich ones have been more important and what portion of the water has beenlost because of each one.\"More Information:See: Earthfiles July 1, 2002 - Scientists Surprised by Abundance of WaterIce on Mars Future Mars Missions2003 - Mars Express"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Launches June 2003 to arrive Mars in December 2003.NASA is participating with the European Space Agency and Italian spaceAgency to explore the atmosphere and surface of Mars from polar orbit.
