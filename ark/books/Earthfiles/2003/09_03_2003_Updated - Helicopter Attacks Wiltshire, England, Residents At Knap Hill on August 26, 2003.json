Mrs. Blower, a researcher into the various phenomenathat occur in the Marlborough area, and her husband Tom, a landscapegardener, held their planet vigil on Tuesday last week.\" The newspaper recounts the same story I posted yesterday at Earthfiles after aninterview with Kerry Blower and concludes: \"A military spokesman said: 'The Army can confirm there were a number ofhelicopters in the vicinity. If the pilots did fly too low, we are sorry, but itcan be difficult to spot parked cars in the dark. If a formal complaint ismade to the Ministry of Defence, it will be investigated fully.'\" 9/4/03 E-Mail from Kerry Blower:\"More amazing information today, Linda. Someone saw my write up thethe paper and contacted me. I went to see them. The couple concerned livein Bottlesford which is situated 1 mile approx south of East Field (nearWoodborough Hill).They are a couple in their mid-60's called Mr and Mrs Hyde. They were intheir home on the 26th August (the same night as mine and Tom's incident)when they heard a helicopter approaching. To their horror. it hovered just3 feet away from their chimney stack. Mr Hyde ran out to shout at them.The helicopter was black with guns either side. It rocked forwards andbackwards in the same spot for a few minutes. It totally horrified Mr Hyde.The whole house shuddered and Mrs Hyde was too frightened to gooutside. It was 6.30 in the evening just a few hours before our incident.When it left, Mr Hyde went into the house and phoned the SouthernCommand headquarters. It was discovered that the pilot was called MrRory Burnett and he lives local working as an instructor for the military.Mr Hyde was given an apology which he didn't accept as this hadhappened to him before. He is still furious. The awful thing is that theyhave noticed that since the incident they can see big cracks appearing allover the house after the intence shuddering caused by the helicopter.I am going to see them again tomorrow and I will videotape the house"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"cracks and interview the couple. If you would like me to send that also onvideo I will do so next week.They have talked to other people and there was a little boy that wastraumatised by the helicopter's noise. This makes me real mad that they canget away with it. Oh, by the way. The reporter that took my story had aresponse from a military spokesman who said 'The army can confirm theirwere a number of helicopters in that area that evening but we are sorry thatit can be very difficult to spot parked cars'. Wow!! I was amazed and thesepeople defend us!!!! I don't believe for one minute that they cannot see inthe dark. What an awful explanation, don't you think?\" September 3, 2003 East Kennett, Wiltshire, England - Over the years, I andothers who have visited the Vale of Pewsey in Wiltshire, England, to explorecrop formations have encountered helicopters maneuvering directly over cropformations - or over some of us on foot or in our cars. Once such incidentoccurred on July 25, 1996, when Kerry Blower of East Kennett had gone upKnap Hill to videotape the eerie \"DNA Molecule\" pattern first discovered in theEast Field on June 17, 1996. A week later on June 25th, Kerry watched severalhelicopters over the East Field near the road leading from Lockeridge to AltonBarnes. That is the same area in which Colin Andrews had his own closeencounter with a helicopter in 1994.Kerry reported that at least three helicopters were hovering low over East Field,apparently photographing the crop formation. She ran her camera on them untilthe aircraft suddenly flew directly toward her in a dangerously low andintimidating maneuver.She was very scared and got back to her car, but kept the camera runningwrapped inside her coat. Below is one frame from the videotape that Kerry'scamera recorded.Unidentified helicopter rises from East Field over the barbed wire fence along the roadand hovered low over Kerry Blower's car.

Kerry Blower, Musician and Singer, East Kennett near Marlborough,Wiltshire, England: \"It was Tuesday, August 26, at 21:30 in the evening ( 9:30p.m.). Tom and I went to Knap Hill with my camcorder to try and film Mars. Wethought we would get a real clear view from that vantage point. While we werethere, we noticed a helicopter blowing the field in front of us in the East Field.It was hugging the contours of the field and moving very slowly in front of usaround the field. Then it flew off to our right about 300 feet in front of us thefirst time. Then the second time, it started doing the same maneuver again infront of us when suddenly it turns toward us and just flew straight toward us. Icouldn't believe he was heading straight toward us at the same height as the car.So I thought, 'I've got to film this.' I put the camcorder through the front windowof the car. The window was down on the car at the time. Tom said, 'Oh, my God,it's going to come straight towards us!' And I thought, 'I'm terrified, but I'm stillgoing to film it.' It came right towards the car. It looked like it was going totouch the car. The sound was absolutely horrific. I was so frightened. I couldn'tbelieve a helicopter was doing this. It picked up all the dust and gravel andeverything around the car and it was flying in the car and hitting us on the face.It was so frightening! I tried to put the camcorder right through the open windowto film it behind us as it left, but the downdraft from the helicopter was so badthat it hit me back in the car because something hit my face. (Frames fromKerry's night time video will be posted at Earthfiles.com as soon as available.)I was so mad and angry and furious that our military can do this to people on apublic place, you know? We drove around the area for awhile that night. I wasso traumatized. As soon as I got home that evening around 11 o'clock, I decidedto phone the military. They gave me seven different telephone numbers ofdifferent people passing the buck from one person to another until in the end,someone eventually said, 'Right, OK. I'm logging this as an official complaint.And we will take it further. We will find out exactly where they came from.' Andhe said that if he hadn't heard from 'them' (identity unknown) in a week, I shouldcontact this guy back. He was from the Seventh Regiment in Netheravon inWiltshire. And he said he will sort this out personally.In the meantime, I took it to the local paper (Gazette & Herald) and luckilyenough a journalist there said he knows so many people now in Wiltshire whohave been buzzed by these helicopters that he himself would call White Hall"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"(government offices in London) to find out further and demand to know what isgoing on in all the harassments of people in this area. He has taken the storyfrom me and it's going in the paper tomorrow, so I would like to collecteverybody else's experiences and really find out what is going on in the EastField and others.SO FAR YOU HAVEN'T HEARD ANY WORD FROM WHITE HALL ORNETHERAVON?Not a thing. Strangely enough, the same incident happened in 1996 in thedaytime. I also filmed that incident as well. I got them in broad daylightharassing me in the same area.COULD YOU GO BACK OVER WHAT HAPPENED IN 1996?In 1996, there was a crop circle in the field down there (in the East Field) it wasthe 'DNA' formation. And I decided to go there with my camcorder and sit onthe hill opposite about 12 o'clock in the day. And as I was there, I noticed amilitary helicopter was flying over the circle, hovering there for a few minutes,and then flying off. It did this about three times in an hour period. On each time,I filmed them doing this.Then, I got bored with that and I thought I should leave. But this feeling of hellcame over me, 'Get off the hill! Get off the hill!' I didn't know what was wrongwith me. But I got to my car and I heard this noise. I thought it was like ajuggernaut coming down the hill or something like that. to my horror, ahelicopter came up over the field right in front of me and the propeller bladeswere literally feet from my head. The belly of the helicopter was sunk towardEast Field, so the propeller blades were coming up and over the public road. Hedidn't know I was filming him because what I did was put the camcorder on thebonnet of the car and threw my coat over it. So, he didn't know he was beingfilmed. I put my fingers in my ears because the noise was unbearable and then Igrabbed my coat and the camcorder and it was still running and I got into thepassenger seat.At this time then, he then came over the top of the car, almost touching the topof my car, and came with me all the way down the hill. I was absolutelytraumatized by that experience. It gave me a fear of helicopters for two years.And now I thought I was over it and OK, and now it happens again.DO YOU THINK IT'S BECAUSE THERE COULD BE SOME KIND OFMYSTERIOUS ENERGY IN THE ENVIRONMENT THAT IS INVISIBLE TOYOUR AND MY EYES, BUT THAT IT WAS SOME HOW AROUND YOUAND TOM AND THAT IS WHAT THE BRITISH AND AMERICANMILITARY ARE SCRAMBLING WHATEVER THE SO-CALLED INVISIBLEOBJECTS ARE THAT ANDY BUCKLEY HAS SAID SOMEONE WORKINGINSIDE THE M.O..D. HAS TOLD HIM THAT THEY DO TRACK AND DOGO AFTER OBJECTS THAT ARE INVISIBLE?I've been very interested in that particular area (Knap Hill) for thirteen years andI know that there is something so strange going on there. I've seen so manyvideos by people who have filmed harassing helicopters, balls of light. I don'tknow what on Earth is happening, but something is happening and they seem towant to get us away from there. It's like they want to frighten us off 'Just goaway, please. We've got things to do.' Whatever it is.Because I've been harassed twice now. It's a horrible thing to be harassed by avery loud helicopter and I'm angry as well now. It's made me angry to think Ican't go and sit on my favorite hill without the fear of being harassed by ourmilitary who are supposed to be defending us.DO YOU OR TOM HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT KIND OF HELICOPTER ITWAS, COMPARED TO AN APACHE OR GAZELLE?Didn't have a clue. It didn't have any lights, no search lights, just red and a greenflashing lights underneath. Other than that, you couldn't see the helicopter at all."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"All you could see were the red and green lights. You could see it as itapproached the car windscreen, but really what you could pick up on the videoin the night time was just the noise and the downdraft on the grass and that iswhat you could pick up there.DID YOU AND TOM HAVE ANY SENSE OF HOW CLOSE THEHELICOPTER GOT TO YOU ON KNAP HILL THIS TIME?Tom said he could see the belly of the helicopter when he looked through thewindow and he estimates it could have been between 12 and 20 feet above thecar.WHY WOULD THE MILITARY BE TAKING THESE AGGRESSIVEHELICOPTER ACTIONS AGAINST YOU, AGAINST ME, ANDY BUCKLEYOR ANYBODY ELSE?I think it just proves that there is something they don't want us to see in thatarea, definitely. Otherwise, why would they do this? Initially, I thought theywere doing it for a bit of fun. But there again, they wouldn't harass all of us for abit of fun. I reckon there is something they don't want us to see. I don't knowwhat it is. Maybe the balls of light flying around. I don't know. Maybe a secretmilitary weapon flying out in this area and they don't want anyone to see itunder any circumstances. but there is definitely something and what they aredoing in effect by trying to keep us away they are attracting us more to the area!Because I want to go there more often now with my camcorder and I know I'mgoing to be frightened. So I'm going to take other people with me. I'm hoping toalmost tease them to come back again because I want to know why they aredoing it! It's absolutely ridiculous to do this and very dangerous.YES, IT IS. FOR ANYBODY TO SAY THAT ANY OF THIS BEHAVIOR ISEXCUSABLE AS PREPARATIONS FOR THE BRITISH AND AMERICANMILITARY FOR DUTY IN IRAQ DOES NOT JUSTIFY COMING DOWNOVER ME AT THE WOODBOROUGH CHURCH OR OVER YOU AND TOMAT KNAP HILL.Not at all. My argument like I told the newspaper was, 'How did they know thatone of us in that car that night hadn't just come out of hospital, or had apacemaker, or heart operation. They could have killed us because it was such atraumatic experience. So loud, and stuff flying around in the car, hitting us inthe face from the downdraft. It was such a horrible experience to go through,especially in the dark. They can't be allowed to get away with this. I am justfurious beyond words.\"We b s it e s :http://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://home.clara.net/lucy pringlehttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://www.cccrn.cahttp://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.bertjanssen.nlhttp://www.invisiblecircle.de and http://www.invisiblecircle.org/ser/d-archiv-2003.htmlhttp://www.kornkreise.ch"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"http://www.heramagazine.nethttp://www.cropcirclenews.comhttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmhttp://www.bltresearch.com/Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
