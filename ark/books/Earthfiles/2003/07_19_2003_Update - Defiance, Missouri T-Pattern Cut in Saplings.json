July 18, 2003 Defiance, Missouri Unusual patterns in cereal crops around theworld have provoked some people to wonder if the formations are a warningthat the Earth's environment and food supplies are not guaranteed and in fact,might be seriously threatened. The past ten years on Dreamland radio and nowDreamland Online, I have interviewed dozens of scientists about problems inthe air, land and sea, including increasing extinctions of plant and animal life.Now comes a new study reported in the journal Science which shows that inonly thirty years, the amount of coral reefs in the Caribbean have declined 80%from what they once were.Heading the study is biology professor, Isabelle Cote, from the University ofEast Anglia in Norwich, England. She points to human pollutions, landdevelopment and deforestation that put toxins and sediments into the water asmajor human causes of the coral crisis. As coral reefs die off, the marine life thatdepends on them for protection and food must move away. That falling dominoeffect means the once beautiful Caribbean island culture that has depended onscuba diving, snorkeling and eco-tourism for money is \"shooting themselves inthe foot,\" says Prof. Cote, if they don't take the dying coral seriously and try to"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"build marine sanctuaries.In this uneasy standoff between humans and our planet, 2003 is turning out tobe one of the most prolific years for crop formations.

ReportingOfficer Frank Spencer stated in his Offense Incident Report: \"Mr. Brown noticedthat all the trees were cut off at about one foot from the ground all at the sameheight. Upon my investigation, I observed exactly what Mr. Brown had stated. Ialso noticed that there were no signs of footprints, tire tracks or wood chippingfrom where the trees were cut.\"The Browns and Sheriff's Department didn't take any photographs. ThePost-Dispatch got a couple of ground photographs, but none of the media in thearea got any aerials of the pattern. Then in June, Bill Kranz, Director of TheCelestial Theatre in Maryland Heights, Missouri, talked to the Browns who gavehim permission to photograph the cut trees in their lake bed on June 21. Hecontacted me about the research he was doing and put me in touch with theperplexed owners. Arthur Brown, has lived with his wife, Pat, and now-grownsons in the same house in rural Defiance for sixteen years. Mr. Brown workedfor Hughes Aircraft and other aerospace companies as a procurement manageruntil recent retirement. The Brown's house sits a thousand feet off a highwaycalled \"F\" that runs through the very rural countryside west of St. Louis andDefiance. The most famous feature in their neighborhood is a log houseoriginally built by Daniel Boone for his nephew, Nathaniel.The Browns decided fifteen years ago that they wanted to build a large pondbehind their house that would cover two acres. But after the digging was doneand rains came, all the water seeped away into what must be caverns and aquiferbelow the limestone that covers their land. That dry lake bed that would neverhold water filled up with willow and poplar saplings until the morning of PalmSunday, April 13, this year. Mr. Brown heard his married son who was visiting"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"for the holiday yell, \"Hey, Dad, come down and take a look here. This isstrange!\" He only had to walk 150 or 200 feet downhill from the house to thesaplings, and Mr. Brown could not believe what he was seeing.Interview:Arthur Brown, retired aerospace procurement manager, Defiance,Missouri: \"I couldn't really think too much about anything except how in theworld did this thing get here!? And so my son and I started back tracking. Youhave to go down an incline to get down into this area. We were looking fortracks. We thought maybe a brush hog (vehicle) had come down there. But notracks.So, then we thought maybe somebody walked in here with a saw and cut it. Welooked at some of the larger sapling stumps there are stumps all over the place.Probably up to 1000 and no sawdust. (Bill Kranz said there were a few hundredstill visible in the undergrowth on June 21.)Then we thought maybe kids were out there playing a prank on us and so welooked for beer cans or cigarette butts, any kind of residue that might be there.There was nothing.AND WHAT ABOUT FOOTPRINTS?No footprints. None.SO, NO KIDS NO MATTER WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DOWN THERE.That's right. We don't know what was down there. It had me so worried that wecalled the police the next day. It was a Sunday when this happened and wecalled the police on Monday. We wanted to think about what in the world wasgoing on here? We didn't want to involve the police unless there was somethinggoing on, you know? So, they sent a deputy sheriff out on Tuesday of that weekthe day after I called and he said it was the most bizarre and weird thing he hadever seen. He couldn't figure it out. He looked for all kinds of clues and thereweren't any. I wanted this to go in a file in case someone wanted to do harmhere. That's the first thing that came to my mind because that path looked rightdirectly at our house.\"Excerpt from April 15, 2003, St. Charles County Sheriff's Department Offense/IncidentReportabout the T-shape cut in the saplings growing in the dry pond on the Arthur and Pat Brownproperty in Defiance, Missouri, discovered on Palm Sunday, April 13, 2003. \"WERE THE RECTANGLES THAT FORMED THE 'T' PATTERN VERYSTRAIGHT?They were straight."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THAT'S WHAT I SEE IN THE PHOTOS THAT BILL KRANZ TOOK.Yes, and that was two months after this happened.

Photograph © 2003 by Bill Kranz.WHAT WERE YOU SEEING IN TERMS OF HOW THOSE SAPLINGS HADBEEN CUT OFF?I looked at them pretty closely. Some of them looked like they were whackedoff with a knife. Some of them looked like they were chewed off, quite frankly.The little ones looked like they were chewed off. I couldn't tell. They didn't looklike they were cut off with a saw, but maybe with a blade or something. I don'tknow. I couldn't really tell.WERE THERE 45 DEGREE ANGLES ON A LOT OF THE CUTS?There were angles on some of the cuts. I don't know how many. I didn't countthem, but there were slanted angles.Straight cut across 3-inch-diameter sapling trunk.All photographs © 2003 by Bill Kranz.White arrow points to unusual tiered cut."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Two levels of sapling trunks intersect. There is a rippled cut on the trunkto the left, a straight cut on the trunk to the right, and what appears to bea 45 degree angle cut on the smaller sapling trunk.This sapling trunk looks as if some force tore off the top.IN BILL KRANZ'S PHOTOS, HE SHOWS THERE ARE MULTIPLE LAYERSWHERE THE SAPLINGS WERE LAID VERY NEATLY - IN SOME CASES,FIVE LAYERS DEEP, CROSSING AT 90 DEGREE ANGLES.I know there were some layers. And keep in mind, these saplings, some of themwere at least 20 feet long or more. They weren't little.Examples of the 90-degree angle piles of sapling trunks that had been cut down and,in some cases, were layered five levels deep in Art and Pat Brown'sdry pond.

It's probably the least traveled highway in Missouri. It's in southwest St.Charles County, which is a rapidly growing county. My nearest neighbor isapproximately he's next door but to get to his house by driving would probablybe 3/8th of a mile. And then where there's an intersection of another road calledFemme Osage Creek Road. And we're a mile from Daniel Boone's home that'swhat they call it here. It's a home he helped build and lived there.WOULD IT BE EVEN FEASIBLE THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY COULDBE HOME ALL PALM SUNDAY WEEKEND AND NOT KNOW THATSOMEBODY DROVE ON TO YOUR PROPERTY?No, we would know. We would know. Certainly, if there was equipment, wewould have heard it. And Channel 2, one of the television stations here, theyflew over. They couldn't see it from the air because the saplings these are willowsaplings and from the air I guess you can't see anything. The trees surroundingthe path were all pretty tall. I mean anywhere from 15 to 25 feet. They are verythin at the top and they bend with the wind. So I guess that's why they couldn'tsee the pattern. Browns' Home and Pond Atop Limestone and AquiferDO YOU KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY INDIAN BURIAL GROUNDS ON ORNEAR YOUR PROPERTY?I don't know that. I don't know. The one thing I do know is that this lake we haddug, or just a very large pond, will not hold water and the MissouriConservation Department told us that it should. So, then we find out that thisarea before prohibition was called 'Vine Hill.' That's where they planted grapesand they had a vineyard here and apparently they kept a lot of the wine in casksbeneath the ground, so there might be caves down there. Could have beenIndian caves for all I know. There are caves across the street from us.I SEE, SO UNDERNEATH WHERE THE 'T' PATTERN WAS PLACED INTHE LAKE BED, IT MIGHT BE COMPLETELY HOLLOWUNDERGROUND?It could very well be because the water just goes in and goes down quickly.DOES THAT MEAN YOU ARE SITTING ON PROPERTY THAT IS"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"LARGELY MADE OF LIMESTONE?I believe so, yes.LIMESTONE IS ONE OF THE MOST PREVALENT COMMONDENOMINATORS AROUND THE WORLD IN ANY COUNTRYASSOCIATED WITH WHERE CROP FORMATIONS OR IN THIS CASE, ACUT FORMATION MIGHT OCCUR.Yes, in fact, roughly about a mile from us is one of the largest quarries in thewhole area that they mine limestone. It's huge. Mysterious LightsHAS ANYBODY, WHETHER INDIAN LEGENDS OR ANYBODY BEFOREYOU MOVED THERE 16 YEARS AGO, WHO HAVE TALKED ABOUTSEEING ANY SMALL, STRANGE, MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS?I don't know about other people, but we did.WHAT?This is a strange experience that happened about eight years ago. We were on asecurity system. We still are and we were linked with two other neighbors: oneabout half a mile away and the other about a mile away in case there was anemergency, all three would know about it. Saturday night, my wife and I hadbeen out late and got home around midnight and went to bed. We were wakedup about 1 a.m. with the alarm going off. We got a phone call from Brinks, thatwas our custodian. It was a medic alert for the Raymeyers who were the closestto us, about half a mile away. Quickly I put on a pair of pants and my wife puton a robe and we drove over there and there was Raymeyer and the Fire Chiefstanding on the porch. And Warren Raymeyer said, 'There's nothing wrong here,nothing at all.'I said, 'I'll drive up to Cokes,' (which was the one about a mile away) 'and maybethere is something wrong with Mr. Coke.'So I got in the car, my wife and I, and drove out of the driveway and went downHighway F. Right next door to us is this huge grist mill and Nathaniel Boone'shome. And right over the top of it was this humongous red ball, shining the FireChief saw it, everybody saw it. So we don't know what that was.WAS THE RED BALL GLOWING IN AN EVEN LIGHT, OR DID IT LOOK ABIT LIKE FIRE, OR WHAT?No, it didn't look like fire. It was just nice even light.THE COLOR OF A RIPE CHERRY TOMATO?Yes, it was strange in the middle of the night. It was a clear night. We could seestars and everything.DID THE FIRE PEOPLE TRY TO APPROACH?No, this thing was up in the air. I don't know how high it was I was in a hurryand a panic to make sure that the Cokes were all right, so we just kept on drivingand said, 'What in the world is that?'BUT THAT'S PROBABLY WHAT SET OFF THE ALARM.Oh, yeah, that's what we think.YEAH, AND HOW BIG DO YOU ESTIMATE IT WAS - BASED ON THESIZE OF THE DANIEL BOONE HOUSE - AND HOW HIGH ABOVE THEHOUSE?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Well, let's put it this way it was relatively high, probably I'd say somewherebetween 750 and 1000 feet over the building. When you see the moon at itsfullest, it was about 1.5 times the size of a full moon.AND PURE RED?Pure red and stationary. Not moving.THAT IS FASCINATING AND IS THAT THE ONLY REPORT OFMYSTERIOUS LIGHTS IN YOUR AREA THAT YOU'VE EVERPERSONALLY HAD KNOWLEDGE OF?There was another time when we were driving down Highway F and a runoffcreek runs along that road as we are going south. That night, the Raymeyerswere ahead of us we didn't know that at the time but all of a sudden it got aslight as day and a light ran down, a light from the sky, ran down that creek bed.I mean, it was just like noon time. But there were stars above. It wasn't lightning,or ball lightning. I've seen ball lightning on airplanes and that wasn't it. We keptit to ourselves and the next day was Sunday and we were in church and Mr.Raymeyer said, 'The strangest thing happened last night,' and he told us what wesaw because they saw it, too.THAT CREEK WHERE THAT OCCURRED IS HOW FAR FROM YOURHOUSE?Probably about 1500 feet.SO EVERYTHING THAT HAS OCCURRED HAS BEEN RIGHT IN YOURAREA?Yeah. My wife and I have talked about that. In fact, before that thing happenedto our trees, we had been talking and said, 'We haven't seen anything recently, orhad anything weird happen here.' And then that happened.SOME HOW, THIS EIGHTY FEET BY EIGHTY FEET BY SIX FEET'T'-SHAPED PATTERN GOT CUT OUT OF THE SAPLINGS GROWING INTHAT DRY LAKE BED WHICH SEEMS TO FILTER WATER DOWN INTOWHEREVER ALL THIS UNDERGROUND WATER IS IN THE LIMESTONE?I guess that's a good way to describe it.AND WHO, OR WHAT, WOULD WANT TO MARK THAT SITE?I have no idea. But you know, one thing that crossed our minds were youngpeople out there who wanted to grow marijuana.BUT THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE LEFT FOOTPRINTS.You would think so. I mean, it would be impossible to not leave some kind ofclues.WHICH IS WHAT THE POLICE CONCLUDED AND WHY THIS IS SOBAFFLING BECAUSE THERE IS NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCEWHATSOEVER BEYOND ALL THE CUT TREES IN THE SHAPE OF THAT'T.'That's correct.\"We b s i t e s :http://www.ctheatre.homestead.com/ctindex.html (Bill Kranz, Missouri)http://home.clara.net/lucy pringlehttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.swirlednews.com"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"http://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.invisiblecircle.de and http://www.invisiblecircle.org/ser/d-archiv-2003.htmlhttp://www.kornkreise.chhttp://www.heramagazine.nethttp://www.cropcirclenews.comhttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
