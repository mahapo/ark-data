The firstwas near the ancient earthworks known as the Serpent Mound between LocustGrove and Peebles, Ohio. The second was on Paint Creek island near theancient Seip Mound in Bainbridge, Ohio, about 30 miles north of the SerpentMound. Paint Creek was reported September 28 by a local newspaper after apilot flew over it. The exact date of its creation is not known, but investigatorsthink it was probably created the same time as the Serpent Mound pattern firstdiscovered on August 24, 2003. A third pattern resembling a Mercedes-Benz hood ornament was reported onSeptember 9, but turned out to be manmade. Jeffrey Wilson and his researchcolleagues reported what seemed to be military interest in the crop patterns. See:10/03/03 Earthfiles. I have also reported about British military activity overWiltshire, England crop formations and a Ministry of Defence insider's statementthat the military uses infrared cameras and other equipment to track downmysterious lights associated with crop pattern creations, of which \"95% areinvisible to the human eye.\" On September 23rd, five days before the impressive Paint Creek formation wasreported, a resident of Aberdeen, Ohio, 30 miles southwest of the SerpentMound near the Kentucky border, had his automatic \"deer camera\" running at asalt lick. Update - Camera Model "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Stealth Cam, Model MC2-G, 35mm Infrared Motion Detector Scouting Camera.Can be purchased from:Stealth Cam, LLC805 W.N. Carrier Parkway, Suite 260Grand Prairie, Tx, 75050Phone: 877-269-8490. The camera was camouflaged in deep grass so it could not be easily seen. Hewanted to find out how many does and bucks were there and how old theywere. The camera is equipped with motion detection and infrared heat sensorsand was loaded with 400 ASA print film. Once the camera is triggered by eithermotion or heat or both, it will take one frame every six minutes until thetriggering event is gone. When 56-year-old Michael Franklin saw the prints from one of two rolls hiscamera filmed on September 23, he was shocked to see a white disk in the clearblue sky near the tree line. More frames on the roll contained a bright sun-likeobject surrounded by a halo. The film was old and the prints have a blue cast tothem, but the camera store processor examined the negatives and said theanomalies are in the film and not a processing defect.First frame of second roll of 400 ASA film taken by motion and heat sensitive\"deer camera\" on September 23, 2003, in Aberdeen, Ohio, 30 miles south of the SerpentMound.Two rolls of film were shot that day. The first roll was completely normal and containedimages of deer.The second roll began with the anomalous print above that was followed by normaland a few more anomalous images. Photograph © 2003 by Michael Franklin.Interview: Michael Franklin, Owner, Hawg Knives, Aberdeen, Ohio: \"And I saw thatdisk and my stomach just hit the floor. I just couldn't believe it. I just kind of satthere looking at this thing. I know this area like the back of my hand. I've beenhere 13 years and to see that disk on there was absolutely flabbergasting.I have it set up so that when the camera is triggered, it takes one picture every sixminutes if that motion detector is still there. If the animal is there in six minutes,then it will take another picture and it will take another picture every sixminutes until that trigger is gone.I've had the camera up there approximately a month and I've taken several rollsof film, all of which had deer in them. I was very pleased with the results. In factwhen we took the last two rolls for processing, one of the rolls was perfect. Ithad lots of deer and very good pictures of them. Then the second roll was notexactly what we had been expecting because it had the disk on the very firstphotograph.The camera faces almost due west right where the setting sun would be, butthere are no shadows anywhere, which means the sun was pretty high in the sky.The progression of the way the object moves is from west to east.WHICH IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE SUN'S TRAVEL."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Right.WHAT TIME WAS THIS?Probably between 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. There were no shadows at all because thesun was high in the sky.IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M LOOKING AT: THE FIRST FRAME THATWAS TAKEN HAS THE WHITE OVAL IN THE SKY. THE NEXT FRAME,WOULD IT HAVE BEEN 6 MINUTES LATER?Ye s .IT WAS COMPLETELY NORMAL?Yes, the next two frames after the first one were normal.Frames 2 and 3 do not have a disc or lights in them, but Frame 3 belowand others that followed are a bit wider than the first two frames for unknown reasonand a large shadow appears in the lower left corner. All photographs © 2003 by MichaelFranklin.Frame 4 has a very bright light and halo seemingly closeto the top of the tree. Mike Franklin estimates the focuswas about 30 feet from the \"deer camera.\"The fourth photo had a glowing 'disk' with an aura coming off it. What we don'tknow is if some how the camera mechanism was compromised. I guess it waspossible. If you figured up the 6 minutes per frame, this thing (light) was around"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"for over 2 hours, which is amazing. (Six minutes times 24 frames = 144 minutes.)The bright disc with the aura is in front of the treeline. The trees areapproximately 50 yds. away from the camera. The camera normally has a rangeof 30 to 40 ft. for motion and heat. Also, in the last two photos you can see thewhite \"cloud\" or whatever coming in from ground level on the right. Iteventually goes almost across the photo and then goes back to the right,disappearing.WOULD THIS CAMERA HAVE BEEN TRIGGERED DURING THEDAYLIGHT HOURS BY INFRARED?Yes, it could be triggered by any heat source. If there was a heat source withinthat area, then it would have triggered the camera.Frame 5 has shafts of light on the far left side of the print.Frame 6 below was taken six minutes later and thereis a faint glow in the upper left corner of the print.HAVE YOU SHOWN THESE PHOTOGRAPHS TO ANY PROFESSIONALPHOTOGRAPHER OR SCIENTIST OR TO ANYBODY TO GET THEIRFEEDBACK?We took them back to the people who processed them. The weird thing is thatwhen we first looked at the pictures, they were out of order. So, the disk picturewas the only one we thought was really weird. The other pictures we justassumed were the sun. Then we got to looking and said, 'If that was the sun,where is it on the rest of these pictures?' And it's going backwards (right to leftin frames which is west to east) and we figured that out.My wife and I talked a long time about even making these pictures publicbecause we watch all those shows about being abducted and all that stuff. Wehave jokes about it and then the crop circles hit and we heard about that. Andthen these photographs surfaced, which believe me, I did not ask for! We talkedabout not letting anyone see them simply because of what we thought might bemisconstrued and a lot of publicity. But then it just seemed like it wouldn't beright to have these photographs and not show anybody. It's not just one picture it's a whole bunch of pictures.WHAT THE HECK DOES IT MEAN AND WHAT IS HAPPENING IN THISREGION OF OHIO WITH SO MUCH PHENOMENA?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yes, that's what the newspaper said. There were people who came and didelectromagnetic testing at the crop site and I think they said the amount ofelectromagnetic energy was very high at those sites.IT'S TRUE THAT THEY FOUND A LOT OF ANOMALIES. I'VE DONE ALOT OF INVESTIGATION OF CROP FORMATIONS IN ENGLAND ANDOTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD, AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ISCONSTANTLY LINKED ARE MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS. THIS SUMMERWHEN I WAS IN ENGLAND, I INTERVIEWED A MAN WHO TALKEDWITH SOME OFF THE RECORD WHO WORKS FOR THE BRITISHGOVERNMENT. HE TOLD MY RESEARCHER FRIEND THAT HE KNEWFOR A FACT THAT BRITISH MILITARY WERE TRACKING ENERGYSYSTEMS IN THE CROP FIELDS THAT COULD ONLY BE SEEN ININFRARED AND OTHER FREQUENCIES THAT WERE OUTSIDE THERANGE OF THE HUMAN EYE.Makes sense, doesn't it?BUT WHAT ARE THEY?We are technologically pretty advanced. Well, these guys, if they are comingfrom some place else are extremely more advanced. So, why would they even letus see them when we have things that are not visible on radar. So, they musthave some way to cover or cloak their ships or whatever.\"More Information:To read about the crop formations at the Serpent and Seip Mounds andeyewitness accounts of military presence in the that Ohio area, please see theEarthfiles.com reports below:· 10/05/2003 -- Part 3 - Paint Creek Island, Ohio Crop Formation Photographs· 10/03/2003 -- Part 2 - Military Interest in Serpent Mound and Seip MoundFormations?· 10/02/2003 -- Part 1 - Another Soybean Formation Near Seip Mound in Ohio· 09/12/2003 -- 2nd Soybean Crop Formation in Ohio is Manmade.
