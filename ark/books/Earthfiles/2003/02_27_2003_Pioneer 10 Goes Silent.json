February 27, 2002 JPL, Pasadena, California - Thirty-one years ago onMarch 2, 1972, NASA launched the Pioneer 10 spacecraft from Cape Kennedyaboard an Atlas Centaur rocket. According to officials, it was the \"fastestspacecraft ever to leave Earth.\" Its mission was to travel through the asteroidbelt, be the first manmade machine to pass Jupiter and be the first spacecraft touse planetary gravity to change course and to reach escape velocity from thesolar system.Its twin spacecraft Pioneer 11 was launched on April 5, 1973. It was Pioneer 11that obtained dramatic images of the Great Red Spot. As it passed the greatplanet, NASA reported the craft \"used Jupiter to accelerate to a velocity 55times that of the muzzle velocity of a high speed rifle bullet, 108,000 mph(173,000 kilometers per hour).\" Both Pioneer 10 and 11 were designed and builtby engineers at TRW. Both probes passed Pluto and headed out into deep spacelong ago, traveling at 27,000 mph and are now more than 7 billion miles fromearth. According to NASA, only Pioneer 10 is moving in the opposite directionto the Sun's motion through the galaxy. Pioneer 11 took an opposite route withthe direction of the Sun's path.Pioneer 10 was powered by electricity derived from the warmth of decayingplutonium 238 and was intended to last only 21 months. Thirty-one years later,it was still going and sending signals until its last known beep on January 22,2003. Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL) officials now say the connection is gone forgood.In memory of all that Pioneer 10 has contributed to human knowledge, a greatplus to weigh against the tragic explosion of Columbia, I received permissionfrom The Philadelphia Inquirer to reprint at Earthfiles.com its February 27,2003 editorial about the \"passing away\" of the indefatigable satellite.\"Pioneer 10 Lost In Space After 31 Years of Success\"With a gentle dying-out in outer space, an era has ended. Pioneer 10, asatellite launched in 1972, has evidently ceased to send signals or returncalls. The Deep Space Network of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory inPasadena received its last known beep on January 22, 2003. JPL calledagain on February 7. Nothing - and lab officials have decided to let it"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"rest. \"Pioneer is a needed reminder, as the country still grieves for the shuttleColumbia astronauts, that sometimes these things go right. Sometimesthe U. S. space program does the impossible pretty darned well. \"After 31 years of space flight, Pioneer is more than 7.6 billion milesaway from Earth, way out of the solar system. That's far. That's so farthat when JPL sent out its electronic hello, it took the signal - althoughtraveling at the speed of light - 11 hours and 20 minutes to reachPioneer.\"Just like the Skipper's boat set out for a three-hour tour, Pioneer blastedoff on March 2, 1972, for what was supposed to be a 21-month mission.It ended up establishing a lot of firsts in the history of spaceexploration. \"It became the first humanly made object to get through the asteroid beltbetween Mars and Jupiter (many skeptics thought it wouldn't survive). Ittook the first close-up photos of Jupiter. It has made valuablemeasurements of the edges of the heliosphere (the solar wind). And itbecame the very first us-built thing to leave the solar system. For manyyears, Pioneer was the most distant object we ever threw out there, untilVoyager 1 (flying in the opposite direction) outpaced it in 1998, a yearafter Pioneer's mission officially ended. Now Pioneer's littleradioisotope-powered battery, which still was followed for futureinterstellar adventures, is too weak to send a signal. NASA and all of us got far more than our money's worth from Pioneer,and we still can from space exploration, even with its deadly risks. Out there in space, there's next to nothing to slow Pioneer down, so itwill keep sliding through space at about 27,380 m.p.h. towardAldebaran, a giant red star that's the eye of the constellation Taurus, thebull, about 68 light years away. At that rate, Pioneer should get there intwo million years. For Pioneer and for us (if we're still around), that'llbe the ultimate bull's-eye.\" The Crab Nebula in the constellation Taurus is the remnant of a supernovae explosionthat was seen on Earth in 1054 AD. It is 6000 light years from Earth. At the center of thebrightnebula is a rapidly spinning neutron star, or pulsar, that emits pulses of radiation 30 timesa second.
