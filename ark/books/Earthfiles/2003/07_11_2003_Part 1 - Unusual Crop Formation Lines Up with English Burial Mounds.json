Aerial photograph © 2003 by Lucy Pringle.Several tumuli (mounds) along an old Roman Road in the North Down of Wiltshire,Englandare aligned with Silbury Hill to the east near Avebury, sacred sites dating back at least4,500 or more years. July 10, 2003 Beckhampton, England - Farmer David Sheppard wasdismayed when he found more than the usual ancient line up of burial moundsin his North Down spring barley field on July 6, 2003. Right at the end of fourtumuli that have been lined up pointing towards Silbury Hill near Avebury formore than 4,000 years, was another bigger circle made from his own crop. StuartDike and Mark Fussell of the Cropcircleconnector.com, with the farmer'spermission, were able to get in on the ground and photograph the remarkabledetail of hundreds of small, swirled clumps of standing plants that dot elevenconcentric rings that radiate from a downed center."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Hundreds of clumps of standing young barley plants surrounded by other swirledbarley plants around them make up the eleven concentric rings in the \"fifth tumulus\" inNorth Down,Wiltshire, England, reported on July 6, 2003. Video image © 2003 by Stuart Dike.Stuart Dike wrote in his report at the Connector, \"The floor construction itselfcertainly needed an immature crop to create this design. I felt that if the barleyhad been any riper, the whole process would have looked rather messy (olderplants would be stiffer and not as fluid). However, from our rather brief visit tothe formation, kindly granted by the farmer, we noticed the fluidity of the croparound the small standing clumps. This ultimately creates hundreds of smallrings, which then creates the standing crop shapes. It is a masterful piece ofwork, which sends out a clear and concise communication to our subconscious.You can feel the ancient atmosphere at this location, surrounded by burialmounds.\"Lucy Pringle, crop formation researcher and author, flew over the formation andprovided the aerial photographs for this report. Lucy has flown over and walkedin more than a hundred formations the past decade and this week I talked withher about her observations over the extraordinary North Down \"fifth tumulus\"created in the barley.

Aerial photograph © 2003 by Lucy Pringle.Interview:Lucy Pringle, Crop Formation Researcher and Author, Petersfield,Hampshire, England: \"I don't think these are random alignments. I think ourancestors in the ancient times in the olden days, they took these things intoconsideration.YES, THE ORIENTATION TO THE MAJOR SACRED SITES OF AVEBURYAND SILBURY HILL.That's correct. But whether it would then line up again with Avebury, I don'tthink it would."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"RIGHT, IT APPEARS TO BE WITH SILBURY HILL. AND I'M CURIOUS, IFIN YOUR YEARS OF STUDYING CROP FORMATIONS AND SOME OFTHE HISTORY, HAVE YOU EVER COME ACORSS ANYTHINGSPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE NORTH DOWN AREA AND ALL THETUMULI THERE?No, I haven't, but I think it's worth investigating now that it has actuallyhappened because it is unusual to have these four (tumuli) in direct alignment.One wonders if somebody, rather like the Archer. Did you read the article aboutthe Archer being found in a burial mound close to Stonehenge? The \"Archer\" Discovered in Stonehenge Burial MoundBy examining the oxygen taken from his teeth which contain certain isotopes,they were able to identify that he originated probably in the Nordic countries inSweden. Also they were able to carbon date him and he was thought to liveduring the period that Stonehenge was being built and possibly he was part ofthe construction's process. He certainly was an important person because goldartifacts were found which are very rare and specific of that period of time thathaven't been found before. That was a very exciting find so in a way one couldask: could the people buried in the four tumuli in direct alignment to SilburyHill have had some unique connection with the hill itself?These are the only four in this particular area in such alignment, but who is tosay that the other ones which appear to be random might have been in alignmentwith others that have been destroyed over the years? One simply can't tell.I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT IF THERE IS ONE COMMONDENOMINATOR FOR EVERYONE WHO HAS PAID CLOSE ATTENTIONTO CROP FORMATIONS OVER THE PAST DECADE OR SO, IT WOULDBE THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE PATTERNS TO THE GEOLOGY,GEOGRAPHY AND THE SACRED SITES.Very strongly. You are absolutely correct. There is a very strong link betweencrop circles and the ancient sacred sites and I think that a lot of work particularly in the British Dowsing Society is going on and Jim Lawrence withwhom I do a lot of work who is an academic at York University. He is leadingthis particular scientific investigation and he is finding that you will find thesame energies or same physical effects within the sacred sites that you findwithin the genuine crop circles.WHEN YOU CONTEMPLATE THAT, WHAT INTUITIVE THOUGHTS RUNTHROUGH YOUR MIND ABOUT THE PAST, PRESENT AND FUTURE ALLCOMING TOGETHER IN CROP FORMATIONS?I think it is rather a special connection which is reminding us possibly that ourancestors have a knowledge which we have lost through time, through ourmodernization through technology usurping our natural instincts. In fact,drawing us back to the time when we needed to be close to the Earth, weneeded to understand the astronomy, we needed to understand the seasonalchanges, to understand our landscape and energies within our landscape whichwe've lost, we've put to one side thinking they were unimportant. They are not.They are absolutely vitally important and maybe this is making re-think that ourancient ancestors had a lot going for them that we have lost in the process oftime. Time Travelers? Angels? Intelligent Force of Nature?WOULD THE CIRCLEMAKERS BE TIME TRAVELERS? OR EVENANGELS, AS ROBBERT VAN DE BROEKE SAYS IN HOLLAND?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Well, what is time, Linda? This is another conundrum, isn't it? Time is the past,present and the future.WHEN SOMEONE ASKS YOU TODAY AFTER ALL YOUR YEARS OFGOING INTO THE CROP FORMATIONS AND FLYING OVER THEM, WHOIS OR WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF THE CROP FORMATIONS, WHAT DOYOU THINK IN YOUR OWN MIND NOW?(Lucy laughs) Oh, dear, that is the $64,000 question, isn't it? I think it changes ifyou keep an open mind. One may think one thing one day and another thing thenext. What I do believe is there is an intelligence behind this crop circlephenomenon. What, who, where that intelligence is, I simply have no idea. Andthis, I think, is one of the whole fascinations of this whole enigma, if you like,that we come to an area where we just have to say or admit we don't know. Wesimply do not know the answer. This is the part I love about it because we haveto be brave enough to say, 'I don't know.'But I do believe if there is intelligence, it is a beneficial intelligence. I think ituses all the forces of Nature available to it. When it actually hits the ground,you don't want to be there because it hits the ground with such terrific force thatit wouldn't do you any good. But of the few people who have seen it happen,they are far and few between and I think the majority of the time, theintelligence actually directs the force away from the observers.There are people who have overnight vigils at this time of year sitting on theWansdyke, sitting above Alton Barnes, East Field, all over the place, andvirtually nobody has seen one of these formations appear. They happen behindthe shoulder, they happen in the field next door, over the hedge, they do nothappen where the people are observing them. Do Crop Patterns Form In Seconds?YOU AND BIOPHYSICIST W. C. LEVENGOOD FOR YEARS HAVE SAIDTHAT WHAT HAPPENS, IT HAPPENS IN SECONDS.Yes, in a time scale between four and seven seconds, I think, which is so rapid.When you take into consideration the scale of time that it takes for the manmadeones to be stomped out it can take hours, days it's just not the same thing at all.OVER AND OVER AGAIN IT'S VERY CLEAR THAT WHAT EVER THEENERGY IS, IT IS ABLE TO FUNCTION IN FULL BLOWNTHUNDERSTORMS.Yes, absolutely. It certainly is. And when you go in the next day, there is not ascrap of mud on the crop. It's quite extraordinary.DO YOU FEEL THE FORCE IS THE 'FINGER OF GOD,' IN SOME LITERALWAY ?Oh, I think so, because God is behind everything, isn't He. Absolutely.THE ENERGY FORCE OF THE UNIVERSE.Yes. He directs the force of the universe. Maybe we don't always respond orlisten or whatever, but certainly yes, I especially think the finger of God isbehind the truly mysterious crop formations, without a doubt.\"More Information:Previous North Down FormationsJuly 25, 2000"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"May 6, 2002 General Measurements of Tramlines in English FieldsLucy Pringle: \"The space between the tramlines is 60 feet and then you havethe tramlines themselves and they are each 6 feet.
