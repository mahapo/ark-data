Photograph © 2003 by AFP.April 16, 2003 Rotterdam, Netherlands - World Health Organization(W.H.O.) scientists have infected monkeys with the same new coronavirussuspected of causing the severe acute respiratory syndrome known as SARS.The primates developed the same disease symptoms experienced by humanSARS patients. This is the same coronavirus that Canadian and Centers forDisease Control geneticists were finally able to gene sequence this pastweekend. This particular genetic structure has not been seen before in thecoronavirus family, but was extracted from some SARS patients.\"So we can now say for certain that the new coronavirus is the cause of SARS,\"said Dr. Klaus Stohr, a W.H.O. virologist. Researchers agree that the firstmutation that created this new coronavirus occurred in animals and then jumpedspecies to humans with the ability to spread itself like the common cold throughcoughs, sneezes, close contact and contaminated surfaces.When University of Hong Kong microbiologist, Malik Peiris, was asked if thenew virus could be man-made, he answered, \"No, that whole genome isessentially new. Nature has been the terrorist throwing up this virus.\" He andother researchers think the reason Hong Kong's Amoy Garden apartments hassuch an intense cluster of SARS patients (at least 217) is that the SARScoronavirus mutated into a more dangerous form for some unknown reason.That hypothesis has not been proved yet, but implies experts are worried aboutwhat forms this coronavirus can take.So far, the mortality rate is still averaging 4%, but many young, healthy patientsin their 30s and 40s have been hospitalized with severe breathing problems.Some of those younger patients who would ordinarily have been expected tosurvive have died in China. In fact, four of the deaths reported in Hong Kong onApril 15 were people in their 30s or 40s who had no known chronic disease. How Long and How Far Will SARS Spread?David Heymann, M. D., Director of W.H.O.'s Communicable Diseases section,said today, \"What's dangerous about this is we don't know its potential. For thepresent, everything hinges on what we find out in China, as far as ourprojections\" are for how persistently contagious and global this new virus mightbe."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Dr. Eskild Petersen, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Arizonasaid, \"This has the potential to be a very big global health problem, possibly apandemic on the order of the 1918 Spanish flu.\"Donald Low, M.D., Chief of Microbiology at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Toronto,Canada, told me he agrees. \"I think we are already seeing evidence that it'sbecoming a pandemic because did you see reports today I haven't seen theseverified but cases in Brazil, cases in Indonesia, possibly in Africa. You know, theamount of energy and time and resources that we're putting to control thisoutbreak in Toronto what would happen if this gets into Brazil and into SaoPaulo? My God! I think we start to meet the definition of a pandemic.\"I think we might find that SARS causes quite a massive immune response onthe part of the human host that the virus is able to trick the sick human host andhave it over react. ...Maybe the way this SARS disease hurts the host is almostlike the host turning on itself (in an auto-immune way).\"The next major step will be to produce a test which can detect the presence ofthe SARS virus in a patient's blood so doctors and hospital emergency roomscan more quickly identify who needs to be quarantined and who does not.
