Only Glaciers?© 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe \"Mars has probably always been very cold and if (occasional melted) waterrushed out of those massive outflow channels and flowed out onto thenorthern plain, it likely froze very quickly.\" Philip Christensen, Ph.D., Planetary Geologist, Arizona State University Hubble Telescope image of Mars and the largest canyonin the solar system, Valles Marineris, that stretches for 2,500 miles (4,000 km). August 27, 2003 Tempe, Arizona - Observations of Mars go back to the 1700s.People saw bright and dark markings on Mars and they speculated that the darkareas were oceans and the bright regions were continents. So, the idea of oceanson Mars has been postulated for three hundred years.When we went to Mars in spacecraft in the 1960s, we learned there were nooceans. But there were huge river channels, things that dwarf anything on theEarth. Huge craters hundreds of miles across filled with sediments were seen andscientists suggested they might have been lakes at one time. People have arguedthat early in the Martian history, the climate was warmer, that water flowed onthe surface, that lakes formed, that oceans formed, and that early in its history,Mars was a very different place than the cold, frozen, dry place we see today.Tiu Vallis is a Martian \"river\" outflow that appears to have started"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"from an area of collapsed terrain (a region known as Hydaspis Chaos), movednorthward through a fairly narrow channel, and then spread out and erodeda large area to the north and west. Old craters are in the lower left.The huge river channels we see are the oldest terrain on Mars and we can tellthat because they are heavily cratered and look like they have been beat up overthe history of Mars. But in the past billion years or so, younger geologicalfeatures don't show any river channels. That fact has fueled speculation thatearly in the Martian history, the climate was much warmer with oceans.However, planetary geologists at Arizona State University in Tempe have beenlooking with the THEMIS infrared satellite that has orbited Mars over the pastsix years for any evidence of limestone rocks on the surface that scientists sayshould be there if water was abundant in a carbon dioxide atmosphere. The dataso far was recently published and this week I talked with ASU Prof. PhilipChristensen, team leader of the Thermal Emissions Spectrometer research.Interview: Philip Christensen, Ph.D., Korrick Professor of Geological Sciences,Arizona State University, Department of Geological Sciences, Tempe,Arizona: \"I can't build a time machine and go back four billion years and seewhat Mars looked like. But the rocks of Mars hold that record. They are likethese books lying on the surface that tell the history of Mars. So, for example,on the Earth we have oceans and in those oceans, the water reacts with carbondioxide in our atmosphere, and it produces limestone, lots of it. That limestoneis used to make concrete. That limestone hardens into marble. We havelimestone all over North America and Great Britain, limestones that formed inancient oceans on the Earth. So, the theory was that if Mars had oceans and ithas a carbon dioxide atmosphere, so it should also have made lots of limestone.And I wanted to look for it.So, in the mid-1980s when NASA said they were sending a spacecraft to Mars, Iproposed an experiment called the Thermal Emissions Spectrometer, or TES.One of its main objectives was to go and search out evidence for the limestonerocks. The way TES works very briefly is that it measures the infrared light fromthe surface. We break that up into a spectrum. Every mineral has a characteristicspectrum and so we can look at the spectrum of light coming from the surfaceand use that to identify different minerals. August 2003 - Results of Search for Limestone on MarsFast forward to now and we've been looking for five or six years for thelimestone rocks and we have not seen them. There is no evidence at all forlimestone rocks laying around on the surface of Mars. Since we have arguedquietly that we are not seeing any evidence for these limestone rocks, otherpeople have suggested two things:1) Perhaps TES can't see limestone or carbonate minerals in general forwhatever reason.2) Or maybe these minerals break down when exposed to UV light as they sit onthe Martian surface.So, in a paper we just published we show that after years of hard work we havemanaged to detect only tiny amounts of carbonate minerals a percent or two inthe dust of Mars, vastly less than what people thought we would find as massivelimestone deposits. So, our conclusion is that Mars did not have the big, warmoceans.DOES LIMESTONE HAVE TO BE A BYPRODUCT OF WATER SITTING ONTHE MARTIAN SOIL?It pretty much does if you have a carbon dioxide atmosphere and Mars currentlyhas a carbon dioxide atmosphere. When you look at and walk on thoselimestones, you are basically walking on the ancient atmosphere of the Earth"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"because huge amounts of carbon dioxide have been taken out of our atmosphereand locked up in those rocks. So, if I take a beaker full of seawater and put somerocks in it and put carbon dioxide in it and leave it for a few thousand years, I'llcome back to find limestone. These carbonate minerals will have precipitatedout and be sitting on the bottom of my beaker. So, that's the idea if Mars reallyhad warm oceans, it should have made those limestone rocks. Could Martian Limestone Be Under the Iron Oxide Surface?ANY CHANCE THERE COULD HAVE STILL BEEN THE OCEANS OFWATER AND THAT THE LIMESTONE THAT FORMED IS NOW BENEATHTHE SURFACE OF WHAT IS OXIDIZED IRON ON MARS?That's certainly possible. We can never prove the negative. I can never provethere is no limestone on Mars. It's like trying to prove there aren't dinosaursswimming in the ocean that we haven't found yet.But if you look at pictures of Mars, there are huge canyons and you can see thewalls and see layers of rock in the walls of the canyons. It has craters all overthe place that basically explode huge holes in the ground and throw rocks outon the surface. You can see layers in the walls of those impact craters. There areplaces where huge amounts of erosion have occurred on Mars, stripping downthe rock layers. Our argument is that it seems unlikely that if Mars had massiveoceans and made lots of these limestone rocks, that we're not finding them.BUT ISN'T THERE ALSO THE PROBLEM THAT THERE APPEARS TO BEA DISCREPANCY IN THE ALTITUDES OF GEOGRAPHY BETWEEN THENORTHERN AND SOUTHERN HEMISPHERES ON MARS. ONE OF THEARGUMENTS HAS BEEN THAT WHERE THERE IS A FLATTER, LOWERLARGE AREAS, IT IS BECAUSE THERE WAS A LOT OF WATER INTHOSE AREAS ONCE? Glaciers, Not Ancient Oceans?That's certainly the argument. Another thing I want to emphasize here. There's aton of water on Mars, no doubt about that. And there is no question that thereare these massive outflow channels and those channels look like they flow intothe northern plains. Undoubtedly water ponded there. The question is: is it anocean or a glacier?My sense is that Mars is very cold. The water that's there today is frozen. It'sprobably always been very cold and if water rushed out of those massiveoutflow channels and flowed out onto the northern plain, it likely froze veryquickly. Rather than thinking warm ocean in the Bahamas, think the North Seacovered with icebergs and very cold, frozen environment with that waterfreezing very rapidly in hundreds of thousands of years, rather than a warmtropical ocean. Even on the Earth today, in reality limestones (carbonates), areonly forming in the relatively warm tropical parts of our oceans. They don't formrapidly in the very cold waters of the North Sea. Why Has Any Melted Water Flowed on Mars?WHAT CAUSED GLACIAL ICE TO MELT INTO ALL THOSE GULLIESAND RIVER CHANNELS IN THE FIRST PLACE?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The braided pattern suggests that water flowed through this Martian fracturein the past. Image by NASA/Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA) Team.That's really interesting. You look at places where there are what is called'chaotic terrains.' There is one in particular I'm looking at with a student calledAram Chaos.The large, circular feature in the upper left is Aram Chaos,an ancient impact crater filled with layered sedimentary rock that waslater disrupted and eroded to form a blocky, \"chaotic\" appearance. Image from the MarsGlobal Surveyor (MGS) and Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) in data constructedby Malin Space Science Systems and the California Institute of Technology.Aram Chaos started off life as a crater 200 miles across. It was filled in withmaterial. something heated it from below. There was probably a great deal of icein the subsurface, melted that ice, the ice roared out through a channel and thewhole surface of this crater collapsed. We see this collapsed and chaotic terrainall over the place. The argument for 30 years has been that water and ice frombeneath flowed out when the terrain collapsed. So, the question has been: whatmelted that massive amount of ice? The thinking is that it was probably volcanicheat from below. Another possibility although this is a little harder to figure out- -is heat produced by large impact craters. But it's most likely some kind ofvolcanic heat from below that melted the ices and roars out across the surface.That would also explain why most of them occurred in the first half of Earth'shistory when the interior of the planet was warmer. There was more volcanicactivity, more heat available to melt the subsurface ice. Volcanic Heating of Water on Mars?OLYMPUS MONS IS THE BIGGEST VOLCANO KNOWN IN THE SOLARSYSTEM. DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHEN THE LAST TIME OR EPOCHWA S T H AT I T WA S A C T I V E ?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"A great question. Olympus Mons and some of the other volcanic structures theonly way we get a handle on age on Mars is by counting the number of impactcraters. The idea is the older it is, the more impact craters. There are places onthe volcanoes like Olympus Mons and other ones that have very few impactcraters and it has been suggested that the last gasp of volcanism on some ofthose may have occurred very recently -- perhaps in some places on Mars whereit might occur more or less today, again in geologic terms. So there is probablysome volcanic activity. I would be shocked if there wasn't some place on Marswith a little dribble of volcanic activity going on today. For the most part, it hasfrozen up and volcanic activity is over.SO, THE ANSWER IS THAT WE AREN'T CERTAIN WHEN OLYMPUSMONS WAS LAST ACTIVE?Yes, I think that's fair. It could be relatively recent in the last millions of years,as opposed to going extinct a billion years ago. The camera a few years ago Iproposed an infrared camera which is orbiting Mars today and one of the thingswe are looking for is that we can make temperature measurements/images withthat camera and we are actually looking for evidence of hot spots, places wherethere are evidences of hot springs or volcanic heating. So far we haven't seenany, but clearly we are looking and the reason we are looking is that we thinkit's not impossible there is some volcanic activity going on.BUT IT'S PROBABLY LOGICAL TO CONCLUDE THAT WHENEVEROLYMPUS MONS WAS LAST ACTIVE THAT THERE WOULD HAVE BEENENOUGH HEAT TO MELT THE PERMAFROST AND BEEN PARTLYRESPONSIBLE FOR THE WATER ON MARS.Exactly. There's other volcanic areas as well. I think that's quite likely. One ofthe questions I've been asked in the last few days is, 'Well, is the lack of oceanmean lack of life on Mars?' And the answer to that question is absolutely notbecause of all the volcanic activity all the big volcanoes. They are going tolocally melt ice and create hot springs so there are still ways to get local hotwater from volcanoes and ice without needing a big ocean. Is Warm Water Necessary for LifeIT'S THE HEATED WATER THAT WE LINK TO THE PRESENCE OREVOLUTION OF LIFE?Yes, and rightly or wrongly. We think of the oceans as the great stew in whichlife formed and evolved in on the Earth. There is evidence I don't want to get toofar beyond what I know but there is a lot of evidence that life on Earth mighthave started in very extreme environments. Places like hot springs where youhave very hot water coming out of volcanic vents and those are places where lifemight have started on Earth. Mars very likely had those places. The oceans ideamight be a red herring or side track in terms of the search for life on Mars.the other thing I'll point out is that there is a lot of biological activity in verycold climates on the Earth. There is algae that live in snow and ice. There arelichens that live in very cold environments. So, life can get by in snow and ice. Itdoesn't have to have a warm, tropical ocean. Ice Ages on Mars?IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE WOBBLING ORBIT OF MARS THATRIGHT NOW IS BRINGING IT CLOSER TO THE EARTH THAN IT'S BEENFOR 60,000 YEARS ON AUGUST 27. THEN IT GOES FURTHER AWAYAND COMES BACK. IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THAT WOBBLINGORBIT OF MARS THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE MELTING ANDFREEZING?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Absolutely. Absolutely. That's one of the most exciting things about Mars. Twothings: Mars has a very wobbly orbit in a lot of ways. It varies in distance fromthe sun by quite a bit. Also, the tilt the angle at which the rotation axis is tilted varies dramatically on Mars. As that changes over 50,000 year cycles, a changein the tilt can have dramatic changes to the climate of Mars. Imagine therotational axis of Mars being more or less vertical to its path around the Sun. Inthat case, the poles of Mars hardly ever get any sunlight and they get extremelycold. Most of the water probably migrates to the poles. Now, 50,000 years go byand the axis of Mars is tilted over as much as 35 or 40 degrees and now thepoles get a lot of sunlight. And it turns out they aren't the coldest place. So, thatwater migrates away from the poles and into the mid-latitudes and are colderthan the poles and that's where the water ends up.So, there have been a number of papers written in the last few years that suggestthat Mars has these dramatic changes where it will get big, thick snow depositsin mid latitudes and those go away and come back and go away and come backevery 50,000 to 500,000 years.WHERE WOULD WE BE IN THAT KIND OF CYCLE RIGHT NOW?We're actually in sort of the warm the mid latitudes are relatively warm at themoment. I wrote a paper a few months ago arguing that there are snow depositsthat melt during relatively warm periods and the melting of the snows areforming the very small, relatively young gullies that we've seen on Mars in thelast few years.If you look at pictures, there are patches, remnants of those snow deposits, thatare still present in the mid-latitudes. I've argued that those are remnants of whatwere much more extensive snow deposits and those snow deposits will comeback in a few hundred thousand years. So, Mars goes through the remarkablestage of snows that melt and retreat and then come back and melt and retreat.Even in this cold climate today, there is snow, melting of snow, and gulliesforming. So, locally you can get quite a bit of liquid water in a very coldclimate.Gullies on Martian crater walls that might be carvedby liquid water melting from remnant snow packs.

IS THERE ANYPOSSIBILITY THAT THERE HAVE BEEN PARALLEL CYCLES BETWEENMARS AND EARTH IN TERMS OF GLACIATION GIVEN THE FACT THATOUR OWN PLANET HAS EXPERIENCED GLACIATION THAT HASCOVERED ALL OF NORTH AMERICA AT ONE POINT?Absolutely. I think it's a perfect parallel. In fact, the suggestion is that tinychanges in the tilt of our planet's orbit are related to these periods of Ice Ages.SO WE CAN HAVE AN ICE AGE ON EARTH AND SIMULTANEOUSLYTHE SAME THING COULD BE OCCURRING ON MARS?That's right. They are out of sequence. Our orbit wobbles around differentlythan Mars's does, but the idea is the same. I mean, we've definitely had cycles ofice ages and so has Mars. I think we've learned a lot about our own ice ages bystudying the effects on Mars.DOES THAT EXPLAIN SOME OF THE PROVOCATIVE PHOTOGRAPHSFROM MALIN'S CAMERA THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS THAT LOOKLIKE DARK TRIANGLES OR LONG, DARK PATCHES THAT PEOPLE AREINTERPRETING PERHAPS AS FRESH WATER OR SPRINGS THATDARKEN IN THE OTHERWISE REDDISH SOIL?I think it does. Mike and I are very good friends, but we disagree about theformation of these gullies and some of the patches. Mike has argued that it'sground water coming out in springs that are making the dark patches andforming the gullies. And I've argued that it's snow that sits on top of the surfacethat melts and forms the gullies. I think either way, the images are incrediblyprovocative and do suggest pretty much without doubt that liquid water ispresent at or near the surface today."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Southern flank of massive Pavonis Mons volcano showsdeep channels that likely began as subsurface lava tubes whose roofs collapsed.Lava channels and flow textures are evident on the uppermost surfaces, indicatingmore recent Martian geology.

IS THERE ANYTHING THAT HAS BEEN PARTICULARLYEXCITING TO YOU IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS IN TERMS OF ANYNEW DATA?I think we are continuing to pour over the data we are getting from thespacecraft which went into orbit around Mars in 1996. I think that really pointsto how difficult it is to interpret and puzzle out story from the data we get. Italso points to the fact that we are asking very sophisticated questions. Twentyyears ago, it was enough to say, 'Oh, my God, Mars has volcanoes.' today, we'reasking much more complicated questions about the composition of the rock. Ithink we really are in a golden age of exploring Mars. The knowledge we aregaining, the information, in our understanding is improving dramatically. Ourview of Mars this whole idea of a cold Mars is really just coming about in thelast few years from images, from arguments about snow on the surface,arguments about the lack of oceans. I think our view of Mars is really at a cuspof a dramatic improvement of our knowledge of that planet.IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THERE HAVE NOT BEEN OCEANS ON MARS ASHAS BEEN SPECULATED FOR THE PAST 20 TO 30 YEARS, DOES THATCHANGE YOUR THINKING IN GENERAL ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OFTHE PLANET?For me, it doesn't. I was joking with someone that if I could go back to everypaper written and just do a global change of the word 'ocean' to the word,'glacier,' I think that might reflect some of the current thinking. But Mars is still aremarkably wet place. There is a lot of water there. If we just come to think notof oceans covering the northern plains, but massive glaciers covering thenorthern plain. In many ways, those aren't that different. It's still a massiveamount of water. there are a lot of neat things going on in that ice.

Image from NASA files.Viking 1976 image, one of two passes over the \"Face\"in Cydonia region of Mars. Image from NASA files.Ah, one of my favorite subjects, or least favorite, depending upon how you lookat it. The close-up high resolution images from MOC, and even ones we've takenfrom the THEMIS camera, in my mind, clearly show those features to be naturalhills and knobs carved by wind and water and snow and ice. In the area aroundCydonia, there are literally hundreds of more knobs that don't look like anythingin particular and look like they were carved by natural processes. So, my view isthat's it's unquestionable that they are natural phenomenon. It's interesting thatthey look a certain way. But of the hundreds of thousands of images we have,you can look at almost anyone of them and find an unusual feature and say, 'Oh,that looks a little too geometric to be natural.'
