Â© 2003 by Linda Moulton HoweAt 20:48 UT on October 29, 2003, the fifth intense solar X-Flare (near sun's center)in a week erupted on the sun, emitting light, x-rays, ultraviolet rays andplasma energies which will impact Earth yet again on October 30.Image courtesy Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO).October 29, 2003 Grenbelt, Maryland - Today at 20:48 UT (4:58 p.m. ET),the fifth intense solar X-Flare (10) in a week erupted on the sun. The massiveJupiter-sized sunspot known as 486 has been the source of two of the mostpowerful solar flares ever recorded in the X category that indicates most intensesunspot eruptions. The unprecedented series of five X-flares within a weekbegan last Thursday, October 23, 2003, when there was a powerful X-sizedsolar flare, followed by two weaker X-flares. Then on Tuesday, October 28th,came the third largest solar flare ever recorded - an X 17.2. The strongest knownis an X 20. That was followed on Wednesday, October 29th, with an X 10.The five X-class solar flares have caused x-rays, ultraviolet rays and plasmaenergies to impact the Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere causinginterference with radio and satellite transmissions, the re-routing of some airlineflights and provoking beautiful Northern Lights as far south as Florida.Sunspot 486 and another large one, 488, still pose a threat of more strongX-class solar flares which could continue to interfere with Earth cell phones,pagers, electric grids, and satellites.October 28, 2003, Solar and Heliospheric Satellite imageof third largest solar flare on record, the white flarenear center of the sun.

The sun isvery active right now and the fact that the same region of the sun explodes withX-sized flares two days in a row is not very common. What happened? We don'treally know. The sun is very unpredictable and just two weeks ago, we thought"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the sun was unusually quiet. There were no sunspots on the surface and wethought this would be a very long and kind of dull decay down from solarmaximum. But suddenly, the sun changed its mind and this is the result.\"Interview:Paal Brekke, Ph.D., Solar Physicist, European Space Agency, Solar andHeliospheric Observatory (SOHO), NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,Greenbelt, Maryland: \"Just about two hours ago (at 4:58 p.m. ET), anothervery powerful flare erupted from the sun. And this is also a very strong flarecompared to normal flares. It's classified as X-9.8, which is still among some ofthe twenty strongest flares ever recorded in the last 25 years.YESTERDAY'S WAS A 17.2?Yes, the one yesterday was much more powerful, but the one today is also verypowerful compared to normal flares. When a flare goes up like this, it is a veryintense flash of x-rays and UV light. That light will move at the speed of lightand reach the Earth in eight minutes and slam into the atmosphere. It doesn'treach the ground because these energies are absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere,but it will heat up the atmosphere and make it turbulent so that many radiocommunication systems will not be able to reflect from the ionosphere or gothrough it. So, they usually call this a 'radio black out' when radiocommunications are falling out due to this intense flare that happened.HAS THERE EVER BEEN A TIME PREVIOUSLY RECORDED IN WHICHTHERE HAVE BEEN FIVE SUCH LARGE SOLAR FLARES IN JUST AMATTER OF A FEW DAYS?I don't think so big, no. The first one was not that extraordinary. It was an X-5and X-1. But then you have X-10 and X-17.2 and the next one X-9.8 that's veryunusual, I think.We don't know really why the sun acts like this. Sometimes it has a very quietperiod and then suddenly activity runs up again. If you're looking at the top ofthe solar cycle and sunspots, you will see it's not a very smooth curve. It'sjumping up and down and very active for a few weeks. Then it can drop downand be very inactive for another couple of weeks. It goes up and down, but stillthis period must be regarded as quite special these big flares. Also, by luck, theywere centered on the central portion of the sun, so the storms are headed towardus. That is not always the case. We can still see big flares, but if they are on thelimb (edge) of the sun, we can see the flash, but we don't receive the stormbecause the CME cloud will go off on the side.DO YOU KNOW SINCE YESTERDAY AFTER THE 17.2 X FLARE, DO YOUKNOW WHAT CONSEQUENCES THERE HAVE BEEN ON EARTHTODAY?From the flare today, I don't know. The flare yesterday had an immediate effectlasting for a few hours. It's the cloud of gas that is coming off the flare that hasaffect for several days. Right now, the flare is ongoing as we are talking, there issevere radio blackouts on the sunlit side of the Earth, the one facing the sun.That's where the rays are hitting right now. So, that's the immediate effect: onradio communications, some satellite telephone will have problems workingbecause they have to go through this region (ionosphere) and also GlobalPositioning Systems (GPS) can be interfered with during these solar flare storms.One group that is using those radio frequencies are the commercial airlines andthose blackouts are usually more severe closer to the poles, the North and Southpoles. They try to avoid those regions when there is a blackout because theydon't want to lose contact with aircraft from the tower. They usually reroutetheir airplanes to go further south, which mean a longer flight and more delays.That's one thing I know happened the last couple of days - air traffic controlrerouting planes."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I also heard today that aircraft flying to the South pole for the station downthere also had problems with their radio communications.WHAT EXACTLY IS THE MATERIAL THAT MOVES FROM THE SUN TOEARTH IN EIGHT MINUTES FROM A SOLAR FLARE?The flare is just light, like any other light, but moves very fast. It takes only eightminutes from the sun to Earth.Then there is also a second wave of particles which is called 'high energyprotons.' That takes about an hour or less from the sun to the Earth. The highenergy protons move almost at the speed of light and they can kill satellites andbe harmful to astronauts in space.The third wave that usually comes is called a 'Coronal Mass Ejection' (CME).It's a big blob of gas that is pushed out from the sun at high speed and takesabout one to three days to reach Earth, depending upon the speed. That is thebig cloud that contains protons, electrons, particles and negatively or positivelycharged ion plasma, plus the magnetic field. The CME is the one that slams intoour magnetosphere a couple of days later after the flare on the sun.SINCE THIS IS UNUSUAL AND PERHAPS UNPRECEDENTED TO DATE,COULD IT MEAN THERE IS SOMETHING ON THE SUN THAT ISCHANGING?The sun has always been changing. That's a very interesting topic. We know thesun is more active today than it was like 150 years ago. In fact, there was aperiod further back in time around 1650 when the sun did not have sunspots for70 years. People looking into this since the sun is the ultimate driver for our heatand climate, people think the sun might drive the climate's variations. So, thisperiod back about 400 years ago, corresponded to a very cold time period on theEarth called the Little Ice Age. So people have tried to understand how much ofthe recent global warming, for instance, is due to the sun which is more activenow, sends out more energy and particles. This is a very interesting topic tounderstand: how much of the warming is caused by the sun and how much byatmospheric gases?WHAT DO YOU THINK?I personally think that the sun is more important than the general climate societywill admit it is. Right now, I think it is a consensus within the climate researchsociety that the sun can explain quite a lot of the warming up in 1940 when thetemperature had decreased for 30 years and then is increasing for 30 years. Thesun can only explain about 20% of the warming the last few years, but I thinkthe sun can be more important that currently used in climate models.IF WE WERE GOING TO SEE A PATTERN OF AN INCREASING NUMBEROF THESE LARGE X-FLARES, WOULD WE SEE ANY INCREMENTALINCREASE IN THE TEMPERATURE ON OUR PLANET?No, these flares only send out UV and X-rays and they will be absorbed in theatmosphere. It also lasts for only a few hours. If you want to change thetemperature on the Earth, you have to have a change in the sun's activity overmany years. So, even an 11 year cycle, we can see there is a signal in the surfacetemperature in the solar 11-year-cycle, so the sun has some effect. But it has tobe shining bright for many years, maybe 20 or 30 years before the Earthresponds with temperature increase.SO, THE BIGGEST IMPACT OF HAVING THIS UNUSUAL SERIES OFLARGE X-FLARES IS THE INTERRUPTION WITH OURCOMMUNICATION SYSTEMS?Yes, that is a serious one because a lot of people depend on this. We mentionedaircraft and control towers. You can imagine you want to go out and rescuepeople in a snowstorm up in the mountains. You have to send out the rescue"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"team and they will depend on their walkie talkies. Those systems can fail, it canbe dangerous to send out people into the mountains to rescue that person sittingthere. Many types of things that we have to be aware of and society needs to beaware that if you depend on a system very much, you need to know about thesesolar flare storms and maybe pay attention to the forecasts and maybe have abackup system for storms.No, it has happened before in some of the active regions. Very often we see thatthe sunspots lump themselves on the same side of the sun. Then they rotatearound to the backside. And then we see no sunspots until some come back thenext month. It takes 27 days for the sun to rotate around its own axis one time.So sometimes sunspots can live for several orbits around the sun. It's not oftenyou have two such powerful flares so close together (October 28 and 29).DO YOU AND OTHER SOLAR PHYSICISTS HAVE HYPOTHESES ABOUTWHAT IS HAPPENING IN THE SUN TO CREATE THESE GIGANTICFLARES?We think we know a little bit about that, especially after SOHO was launchedand we can see inside the sun and we can now see beneath the surface of thesunspots. What we think it is: the inner portion of the sun rotates a bit differentfrom the outer layer and this boundary layer where this difference happens,there will be very strong 'friction,' you might say. That is what we think iscausing the sun's magnetic field to form. Sometimes these magnetic fields canraise up to the surface and that's what is creating sunspots when some of thesestrong magnetic fields or areas come up to the surface. They will block some ofthe energies trying to escape from beneath, but have to come out other places onthe sun. That's why sunspots look darker. There is less energy coming out ofthem and they are a little bit colder.That's why we think the internal magnetic fields are popping out and afterawhile the surface field will become unstable and snap. And we think again youcan look at this as rubber bands, two pieces of a rubber band that connect ontwo places on the sun. You wind them up and if you wind a rubberband upenough, it will snap. And when a rubberband snaps, it goes in one direction andusually with a sound snap, too. So, the snap can be the flare that the energy isreleased very suddenly and the rest of the energy is going to throw thisrubberband away.IN LOOKING BACK OVER OUR SOLAR RECORDS HAVING TO DO WITHTHE 11-YEAR SUNSPOT CYCLE, IS THERE ANY PRECEDENT FORTHERE BEING THIS KIND OF INTENSE SOLAR FLARE ACTIVITY INBETWEEN SUNSPOT CYCLES?A sunspot cycle on the 11 year cycle has been measured only with the numberof sunspots. You can have fairly good solar storms even if there are a fewsunspots on the sun. If you go back in the literature and look at the previoussolar cycles, very often some of the biggest flares have happened actually on thedecay phase of the solar cycle. We are now in a decaying phase. We reachedmaximum solar cycle in 2000. But increases can happen any time. We can neverbe for sure. But most of the flares happen during solar max or just after.IF THESE WERE COMING DAY BY DAY FOR A PERIOD OF TIME,WOULD THEIR IMPACT INCREASE ON THE EARTH BECAUSE SOMANY WERE COMING? OR DOES IT DISSIPATE QUICKLY?I think it dissipates very quickly, but if the storm that came yesterday and hit ustoday if the storm continues for two days like they sometimes do, the next stormfrom today will maybe arrive early tomorrow and then they might add up. If youhad three or four of these flares in four days, then it will increase impact on theEarth. But the sun has existed for many thousands of years and there have beenmany flares back in history. I don't think that is a worry.YOU ARE NOT PERSONALLY CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THISINTENSE X-FLARE ACTIVITY MIGHT MEAN?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"No, the Earth system will accommodate this easily. It's done it before. It will justbe a lot of activity in the system right now and in a few days, we will be back tonormal. Unless there is another flare. But in four or five days, all this activitywill be out of sight from us and it will probably be at least 14 days with a quietand peaceful time.\"We b s it e :http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
