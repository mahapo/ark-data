D., Microbiologist,working in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2004. Photograph by BJ.Click here for Part 1 May 23, 2004 Las Vegas, Nevada - On June 7, 2003, Bill Hamilton - then ExecutiveDirector of Skywatch International - was given permission by microbiologist Dan Burisch,Ph.D., to interview Dr. Burisch on-the-record as a whistleblower in a videotaped sessionattended by five other researchers with their own videotape cameras. The subjects wereDan Burisch's 1994 work with the J-Rod entity at the S-4/5 underground laboratory, Area51, Nellis AFB, Nevada; the Doctrine for Converging Time Line Paradox (DCTP); andDan's concern about the future of this planet. Here is Part 3 of that June 7, 2003, videotaped interview in Las Vegas, reviewed andcorrected by Danny B Burisch, Ph.D. (His family says his middle initial has no period. Seebirth certificate in More Information below) In this section of the interview, questions wereasked by Bill Hamilton and the others. The questions are ALL CAPS without specifyingspecific questioner, except where specifically noted for Bill Hamilton.Interview, Part 3:Telepathic Communication with J-Rods"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A QUESTION ABOUT TELEPATHICCOMMUNICATION AND THE NATURE OF IT. WHAT IS IT ACTUALLY LIKE WHENYOU COMMUNICATE WITH ONE OF THESE BEINGS TELEPATHICALLY?I could hear my voice and it was like you hear yourself think. I could hear my voice (insidemy head). However, the cadence, the affect, was something that distinguished it (assomething) other than me. It was no great booming voice from the heavens or anything likethat. And I'm glad I do not have a proclivity to hear voice in my head, and I have heardnone since! (laughs)I could tell it was somebody other than me and I could tell because I felt drawn towards thesubject (entity) that was sending the communication. When the J-Rod spoke with me priorto the bombardment of images, it was something that was part of me, but not part of me. Iactually felt non-resident for a moment (out of my body). It was almost an OBE (out ofbody) type feeling and then I could feel myself pull back and experience the sound (insidemy head). It was physical! It was more real than touching an object. That's the only realtime that I ever felt anything more physical than physical.WAS THERE ANY CONVEYANCE OF EMOTION?100% emotion. If he was upset, I could feel his pain. It got to the point where as I wasdoing the needle introductions, I could feel what he was feeling. So as I would inject theneedle under the integument (arm muscle) and find my proper location prior to removingthe sample, I could feel the needle entering him. So, I could feel his feelings.Robert Lazar and S-4 and Area 51Robert Lazar had a U. S. Naval Intelligence tax form for the year 1989,the year that Bob said he traveled four times to S-4 Area 51 as a subcontracted engineerto examine the propulsion apparatus of a disk-shaped vehicle identifiedas non-terrestrial. Photograph 1989 courtesy Robert Lazar.WERE YOU AWARE OF BOB LAZAR ANY TIME YOU WERE THERE?I saw a guy out on the tarmac outside of the Galileo and 4-1 area who was barefoot. Hewas just standing and staring off into the distance. This was as we were coming in from ahelicopter. They keep you within a very confined walking area. This was before theystarted taking the buses, we were choppered in. When I saw him subsequent to that whenhe did the famous (Las Vegas Channel 8 TV reporter George) Knapp videos, it could havebeen him. This was early on. This was I can't prove it. I couldn't positively identify him. Iam aware of his name being mentioned out there and it was associated with the term,'bottle washer,' which means an engineer but not a Working Group Leader or anything ofthe kind. They would have said a 'director' or a 'geek.' I was called a geek. His name wasmentioned. I heard the name 'Lazar.' I did not hear Bob. I heard Lazar and it was not 'laser.'It was 'luh-ZAHR.' But I never had any interaction with him or anyone else from Galileo,Side Kick or radionics."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Medical Treatment for J-Rods?HOW SUCCESSFUL WERE YOU IN ASSISTING THE J-ROD MEDICALLY?Temporary assistance, temporary relief of pain. Temporary meaning for weeks. Temporaryadjustment of muscle tone and then flat out nothing. He got worse. The exacerbation gotout of control. Since then, there have been and I'm not certain if he's still resident there ornot now. There has been a progress let's say progress involving what I was yammeringabout earlier concerning the Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT).Their (J-Rods) DNA is triplets. And it's not triplets in the way you would think of a number3 helix wrapping around a major group of Watson-Crick double helix DNA. Their DNA istriplets to the extent that there are what we nickname 'hangars.' They look like they arerosettes. Their DNA looks like rosettes. They are triplets in that they are a super-coiledDNA situation. We had difficulty even doing anything, let anything like a single stepmarker or anything like that. We had difficulty even sequencing the DNA. Homo sapiens sapiens Is Result of J-Rod Manipulationof Genes in Already-Evolving Primates on EarthOur long intersperced nuclear elements in our genes that have been shut off that whencombined with the appropriate Hoogstein base pairs produce a different being, what wewere before they made a mistake, a grave mistake. (Editor's Note: Hoogstein base pairswere the first base pairs observed in X-ray crystallography experiments and not the Watsonand Crick base pairs.)DID THEY MENTION ANY EXCHANGES (BETWEEN J-RODS AND HUMANS)?There have been exchanges going on since well, they spoke with us in 1941. Connection with Fatal Prion Disease?WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF THE EXCHANGE?They wish to find a resolution to the broken resonance between 'they' and the other half of'they' the so-called 'Orions' and 'Zeta Reticulans.' They also wish for fear of extinction tohave a relief of the paraprotein-related problem. Speaking about that just for a moment, wefound out that some of the disease process under which they are (trying to survive) is aPNA it's a peptide nucleic acid, which is a protein-associated background nucleic acid. Thatprotein associated background is a prion. (Destructive prion disease?) That leads to one ofthe things they wanted me to do at Sweetness. They are dangerous, were dangerous. \"T-9 Treaty\" and Trying to Prevent Catastrophe in 2012But the exchange process is to solve the problem to prevent what went wrong in 2012. Andthe rogue group of the J-Rods are not cooperating with that. But a deal has been brokeredfor the T-9 Treaty to be held in abeyance until 2005 (March 15, 2005) When that treaty isup in 2005, once they have received what they've asked for and they should be receiving alittle more. I've already mentioned some of that material that they are not aware of yet.DNA material and some of the things we can do with the nucleotides that could possiblyhelp with the problems. But once that's up, they are supposed to come under the auspicesof the general agreement between the Committee of the Majority and the respectivesocieties (of J-rods and Brothers). If so, nothing will get turned on (star gates on Earth)"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"except what Nature and God are providing us in 2012 and we will separate.However, they (J-Rods and Brothers) will remain as they are their future selves as well they will remain as they are and we will remain as we are (Homo sapiens sapiens). We can'tgo back. That's just something that's impossible, what they've been told the Looking Glasspeople and the people who are overseeing STAAR FLOWER, ERBs (Einstein/RosenBridges) and all of that.CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT? IT'S SO COMPACTED.LET'S STRETCH IT OUT A LITTLE BIT. IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE YOU ARETALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY (J-RODS) ARE GOING TO GET OUT OF THISEXCHANGE. I'M CURIOUS AS TO WHAT WE ARE GOING TO GET?Oh, we're going to get not wiped out!BECAUSE THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE IS NOT TO BE WIPED OUT(IN 2012)? Threat of Einstein-Rosen Bridge \"Star Gate\" Time MachinesThe biggest problem is to make sure that there are no human-created ERB (Einstein-RosenBridge) machines (Star Gates). It sounds science fiction, I know, and it's hokey-sounding.OK? But to make sure there are none of those in existence which can automatically turn onwhen the next age begins on December 21, 2012. We are apparently going to cross over theplane of the galaxy in which there is a dense network of wormholes. There is supposed tobe some sort of enlightenment. Whether or not that's the Christ event or whether that's aburp on a Sunday morning, I don't know what that's going to be. I'm not enough of a scholarin that area to figure that out. I do know that failure would result in too much energy beingdirected at our planet from our own star. And hence, my interest in looking at the prettySOHO pictures of our sun. The pace at which these unusual forms (more intense solarflares? Worm holes?) are being produced is increasing.ARE WE ENTERING AN AREA AS WE APPROACH THE EQUATORIAL PLANE OFTHE GALAXY WHERE THERE IS A GREATER CONCENTRATION OF DUST THATCAN SURROUND OUR SUN?So I've heard.\"(Editor's Note: Priscella Frisch at the University of Chicago and Mark Landgraf with theEuropean Space Agency in Darmstadt, Germany have respectively studied the gas and dustin which our solar system moves. No gas and dust of any appreciable density is expected toaffect our solar system in the next several decades.) Einstein-Rosen Bridges (ERBs) and \"Worm Holes\"WHAT THEY ARE CALLING ERBs (Einstein-Rosen Bridges) - NOW CALLEDWORMHOLES ARE THERE NATURALLY OCCURRING WORM HOLES?There are a number of nodes on our planet of what I am understanding that are naturallysensitive electromagnetically? I don't know, but are naturally sensitive to the space throughwhich we pass. These nodes activate spontaneously when we pass through them (wormholes) or can be struck with electromagnetism and be temporarily opened.WHAT HAPPENS IF WE USE A MACHINE TO OPEN AN ARTIFICIAL WORMHOLE?There are two different things. One, they have been putting Saddam Hussein did put two ofthem together in Iraq which conformed to the ancient cylinder seals which are now missing"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"from the Baghdad Museum. Obviously, some one looted them. They were looted by the\"best,\" I'll put it that way.HAVEN'T YOU BEEN INVESTIGATING A SITE WHERE THERE IS A NATURALWORM HOLE?Frenchman Mountain. (Las Vegas, Nevada)Frenchman Mountain, location of the vishnu schist and granite geological Great Unconformity,near Sunrise Mountain on eastern edge of Las Vegas, Nevada marked in yellow below.Photograph Â© 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe.YOUR WORK CONTINUES ON FRENCHMAN MOUNTAIN?Yes, it does. Our remote viewing unit first brought the notion that this could be a wormholesituation. Yes, we have employed remote viewers for it. Since then, there have beenoccurrences at the mountain that are far afield from the research I have been doing for theLOTUS Project.Those are two separate things. I originally went there (Frenchman Mountain) with a teamto do an endosymbiotic research program. I was trying to nail down book about theMcMenamin hypersea theory.\"(Editor's Note: In 1994, Mark McMenamin, Prof. of Geology at Mount Holyoke College,introduced the theory that life forms that moved from the sea to the land diversified to a fargreater extent than marine life did. In his book, Hypersea: Life on Land, the \"hypersea\"theory was called one of \"seven ideas that could change the world\" by Discover magazine.Later in 1994, McMenamin proposed that the 600-million-year-old fossils he discovered inMexico-the oldest ever found-didn't merely push back the timeline for the earliest animals,but indicated an entirely new division of life, a division (now extinct) that was evolvingheads and nervous systems apart from animals through a process called \"convergentevolution.\" The contemporary implications of his hypothesis are profound, providingevidence that the potential for development of humanlike brains is not a unique occurrencein our universe.)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\"Ganesh Particle,\" Seed of Life\"And also I had presumed that we were looking for what past we were in (given the timeconvergence paradox). So, I was looking for an artifact that might interact selectively withourselves. That's when I fell into the issue involving the \"Ganesh particle\" when a flare (oflight) passed across the surface of some algae during a test. We found out that the flare andit's included in the report that flare is associated with the speed that the Ganesh particlepasses. So, for a Ganesh particle, it was actually overly flaring on us that day. It was May31, 2001, at Frenchman Mountain. You have access to one of those reports that I'm awareof.CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT THE CURRENT STATUS IS AT THE PRESENT TIME?We're in a chimera (Dan's metaphor to illustrate the multiple temporal loop overlays).\"(Editor's Note: Greek mythology - fire-breathing she-monster with a lion's head and agoat's body and a serpent's tail; daughter of Typhon, Greek Mythology. One of the bestexamples is perhaps from the book \"Gods Men and Monsters\" written by Michael Gibsonand illustrated by Giovanni Caselli.)Chimera, a triplicate combination of genes from a lion, goat and snake.Illustration Â© by Giovanni Caselli from Gods, Men and Monsters Â© by Michael Gibson. Past, Present and Future Time Lines on Earth and Mars\"What we see for instance I mentioned earlier - ruins on the moon and Mars. You areprobably aware that I was involved in Inca City research (on Mars). That's because theJ-Rod that showed me (telepathically) the Inca City image, but didn't show it to me as adead city. He showed it to me as a future city a living, breathing, society post-damage,post-catastrophe, here."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Mars Global Surveyor image of \"Inca City.\"Credit: NASA/JPL/Malin Space Science Systems.We are literally looking at things that are present, but according to a linear time line, havenot been built yet! Now if that isn't confusing!! You said you wanted me to explain whatthe hell I was talking about if that's not confusing, it confuses me.According to the Doctrine of Convergent Timeline Paradox, the J-Rods to solve theirpara-protein problem used these ERBs (Einstein-Rosen Bridges) to go back in time. Someof them were worshiped. They were treated as gods and temples were built for them. It's soscience fiction! It sounds like poppycock, I know.But this is what I got in exchange for the information that he gave me, so what the hell.Literally, there are two or more concurrent time lines that we are living in. Two separateexistences. What that means exactly? That's what I read. What that means exactly, I'm notsure. I am intellectually limited in that area. I took some philosophy, but I'm intellectuallylimited in that area. And I don't want to present something that I don't know is fact.But, to solve their problem, the J-Rods messed around with us even earlier than when theywere treated as gods. They went back (in time), were treated as gods, and then went furtherback before. In other words, they could select the time line (they enter here on Earth). Howthey do that? I have no clue.They manipulated our original DNA and removed a single strand from us (of DNA). Thismade us able to mate with another experiment that was underway at the time calledNeanderthalensis. And yes, I know there is no genetic evidence concerning the matingbetween the Neanderthals and the other brand of our kind (Homo sapiens sapiens). That'sbecause all the genes have been turned off. Any of the unusual mating sequences asidefrom retro-viruses that tagged along were turned off as part of our long intermittentsequences (so-called 'junk DNA'). They are part of the great repeats. In fact, inNeanderthals, take a look at the number of long interspersing elements that they have intheir genomes and that will bear out what I'm saying.I THINK THERE IS A NEW ARTICLE IN THE NEW SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN BY AWOMAN ANTHROPOLOGIST WHO SAYS HER RESEARCH SHOWS THAT HOMOSAPIENS SAPIENS DID MATE WITH HOMO NEANDERTHALENSIS AT SOME TIME.It has been believed that the cross-breeding mismatched our chemical and structuralarchitecture neurophysiologically and that was one of the primary promoters for theproblem that the J-Rods now suffer.WE ARE TALKING ABOUT GOING TO TWO DIFFERENT POINTS IN THE PAST:ONE NOW AND ONE EARLIER. WHAT EXACTLY IS THE DOCTRINE OFCONVERGING TIME PARADOX?It's the paradox of killing your grandfather. If you kill your grandfather, you cease to exist.Michio Kaku, from what I can glean from his work, would say, 'No. It would cause two"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"separate universes, or two separate time streams.'But in accordance with the Doctrine that I read, his theory does not take into account thatthose two time streams could occur simultaneously that the reality could be mixed! Whichis why there are so many confusing data sets involving everything from fossil finds tostrata. It's why there are so many conundrums involving the speed of planetary formation.There was a recent thing out that I read about our planet being formed in a very shortperiod of time, much shorter than they had counted for the accretion period. The way itcame through to me was that it was (my source) was a Keystone DCTP flyer.\"(Editor's Note: Keystone DCTP: the process of engineering molecules with desiredproperties is the keystone of molecular evolution. It is achieved through a repeating processof changes in the DNA, followed by screening or selection of the optimum sequence. Thechanges in the DNA occur in evolution as a result of recombination and mutagenesis. DNAshuffling describes a combination of in vitro recombination of related sequences and a lowrate of random point mutagenesis in one experiment. If the size of the template DNA is toosimilar to the size of the products, it is necessary to digest the template DNA enzymatically.Deoxycytidine 5'-Triphosphate (dCTP) : Radioactive Nucleotides.)\"That these things are happening simultaneously. That a planet can form at one rate and thereality can mix such that we can perceive it having formed at a separate rate. And then youcan go back and look at it at another time and have another perception because the realitiesare actually mixed.ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT SOMETHING ONE DAY AND THENGO BACK THE NEXT DAY AND IT WOULD SEEM DIFFERENT BECAUSE ADIFFERENT TIME LINE HAS COME INTO PLAY?Yes. Biologists, chemists, natural philosophers, call that 'error.' If something falls outsidethe acceptable range of error, they call it 'non-written' because you would call itnon-publicized and they would not get their funding. That's the nature of the Big Businessof science.And I asked a guy associated with my mentor at SUNY (State University of New York). Hisname was Carl and he had a problem in Louisiana, let's say that. He jumped ship and hewanted to measure some things having to do with free radicals. This will give you an ideaof what happens if you piss people off and where you don't get enough funding. He hadfunding ten days prior to his separation (from the University), but they separated himanyway and he lost his funding. If you don't show the progressive upkeep for the funding,you are not there any more. It goes much deeper and wider than 'publish or perish.' T-9 Treaty with J-RODSWHAT IS IT IN THE (T-9)TREATY WE HAVE (WITH THE J-RODS)? WHAT IS IT WEARE TRYING TO WORK WITH AND THEY WITH US?100% cooperation in getting rid of the ERBs (Einstein-Rosen Bridges time machines nowon Earth from past interactions of the J-Rods coming back in time and leaving the ERBs onthis planet) in exchange for 100% cooperation to solve their physical problem and toattempt their rejoining (in this timeline). That's a big, big order. Where that will go? I'm notsure. However, the project under which I'm working right now might help some. Dan Burisch Research of the \"Ganesh Particle\"WHAT IS YOUR CURRENT WORK?It's an electro-physiological resonance which is present around, in and through our DNA,which it is believed by some of the more esoteric people to come via the Supernal Triad,"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"the Divine Sephira Tree of Life, which holds us together as intellectual and emotionalbeings. It is that dualism that keeps us in sync with the universe.WHAT IS YOUR WORKING ENVIRONMENT LIKE NOW?I'm in an environment I'm not going to get personal here I'm in an apartment environment.There are children around me, which is wonderful. I direct the project from that location. Ido some minor microscopy work from there. Nothing of a hazardous nature, no more thandust would be hazardous to you. In times of need, I transfer to various facilities, notworldwide, but nationwide and work within those facilities under whatever the protocolsthat we need to complete. Those facilities are wide-ranging such as Dulce, New Mexico,the Shady Rest Site 4, the Groom Lake facility, Brookhaven National Lab (Long Island),the Los Alamos area (New Mexico) of the T-5 section proper, and recently in this littleevent near Los Alamos in the Alamo Canyon. As well as give testimony, I had to showsome evidence when I was there to a mirror. (Someone) was sitting on the other side of themirror, so I hear. As God as my witness, there maybe was not anyone on the other side ofthat damn mirror! But they told me they were.TO DEMONSTRATE RESULTS?To demonstrate data, yes. Show data sets relative to Project LOTUS.YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING ON THIS EXCLUSIVELY FOR HOW LONG?Since 1986. I've played with local jobs around town (as cover for microbiology work).That's when I was Danny Crain.YOU'RE PRETTY MUCH EXCLUSIVELY ENGAGED IN A PROJECT WHICH ISFUNDAMENTALLY TIED TO THE FUTURE OF OUR SPECIES?It is. Fundamentally. This project without getting too deep into it, this project is anall-encompassing attempt to grab for the brass ring and make sure that that brass ring is notthe fruit of the Tree of Life. To grab just until we get to that point. Aside from that, I'm notgoing to try to barge my way past the East Gate of Eden. The people who do that get hurt,at least so I've heard.IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE BRIDGING WHAT WE HAVE CALLED PHYSICS ANDMETAPHYSICS INTO ONE THING.Indeed. And that's not even pop metaphysics, but ancient esoteric sciences. For millennia,we've conceived of the supernatural and that supernatural interaction with humankind.What we are seeing in this project that it isn't so much supernatural. It's natural and it'sthere with us all along. We just haven't taken the time to look. In fact, our lab procedureshave been mutually exclusive to find what we have now found! they would destroy ormask over the process we are now beholding. These particles have the ability, in essence,to bend light. In the report, you'll see a series of images that show clearly where the particleis changing into the shape of a yeast cell (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). It's masking thecloser it gets to it, the more it masks. But when it passes by, it looks like it. Then when itgets in close proximity, the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing steps out and it does its business.Meanwhile, the average biological investigator has ceased looking. The protocol has movedon. He or she has scaled a slide and has seen two eukaryotic cells and has moved on!HOW DO YOU WANT TO GET OUT OF ALL THIS NOW?'Getting out' is a loaded term right now. I don't know where it's going to go, but what I doforesee is that if that same elected U. S. government is interested in information, I do seemyself providing that to my elected government as I have been sworn to do so. Whether ornot I'm prevented from doing so, we'll find out. Again, we all have to go some time.I see that as the logical step because once the information is presented to the electedgovernment and once I'm no longer officially held. And it's not just the information"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"involving the Lotus. There are military applications associated with it as well, biologicalapplications.

I don't know which one. There has to be one withthe right name on it.

I have met and talked with hismother, Dodie Crain, and with Dan Burisch, Ph.D., who confirm the name change after hismarriage.Copy of Danny B Crain (aka Dan Burisch) \"Certificate of Live Birth\" at 4:28 a.m. on February 2, 1964,in St. Francis Hospital in Lynwood, California - a suburb of Los Angeles. Birth certificate provided by\"Dodie\" Crain.In 1990, he married Deborah Kay Burisch who had a child from a previous marriage. Fiveyears later in 1995, Dan legally changed his last name from Crain to Burisch to match thechild's legal last name.In 1989, as Dan Crain graduated from SUNY Stonybrook with a Ph.D. in Microbiology andMolecular Genetics, Dan was at the same time employed by the U. S. Navy's DOD NavalResearch Laboratory. His rank was Captain and his title Microbiologist IV.In 1994, he was assigned to work in an underground laboratory at S-4/5 at Area 51, fivefloors under the Papoose Mountain installation at Nellis AFB, Nevada. The fifth floor isaccessible only by one secure elevator. Dr. Burisch said in the years 1991 to 1994, hesuited up in the fifth floor underground laboratory in an astronaut-type suit with breathingand urination hoses. His assignment was to enter a round, \"clean sphere\" filled with a coldatmosphere of 4% by volume hydrogen and other gases including argon. Inside the cleansphere was an entity originally called \"extraterrestrial\" by Dr. Burisch's governmentsuperiors and later described as a \"time traveler\" from 50,000 years in the future.According to Dr. Burisch, his boss reported to a MAJI committee, an extension of theMajestic-12 Special Studies Group organized by President Harry S.
