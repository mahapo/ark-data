S. population.\"- The New England Journal of Medicine, April 10, 2003 In April 2003, actual SARS coronaviruses under electronmicroscope © 2003 by Erasmus Medical Centre Departmentof Virology, Rotterdam, The Netherlands.May 2, 2003 Hong Kong, China - Today, health officials in China reportedanother 176 new cases of the severe acute respiratory syndrome known asSARS, plus 11 more deaths. That boosts the world total to more than 6,000cases and 402 deaths. That means the global average death rate for SARS is nowabout 7%. But in Toronto, Canada, which reports 147 cases and 20 deaths, themortality rate is nearly 14%.As new SARS cases continue to surge in the countryside around Beijing wherethousands fled trying to escape the deadly virus in the nation's capitol, healthauthorities are afraid the death rate will climb higher in China as well.Current Estimated SARS Mortality Rates:- Patients over 60, the SARS death rate is 20%.- Patients in Canada, SARS death rate is 13.6%- Patients in Hong Kong, Beijing, and Singapore, SARS death rate rose from 4%to 10%.Global average SARS death rate is 7%.- Patients in the United States, so far death rate is 0%.Influenza Mortality Rate:- In general, worldwide influenza death rates are around 2%.New complications are cropping up in Hong Kong. Doctors there say they have"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"discovered traces of the SARS coronavirus in the feces and urine of patientsthought to be free of SARS and discharged from hospitals. No one yet knowshow long the SARS virus can remain contagious in human feces and urine. Ifpeople are being released from home quarantines and hospital beds while thevirus can still infect other people, then controlling the SARS spread will be evenmore difficult.Another new development: This week, Hong Kong health authorities found 12previous SARS patients they thought had recovered, but who had to bereadmitted to hospitals sick again with SARS symptoms.What no one knows is whether these patients were not fully recovered whenfirst released from hospitals? Or if their weakened immune systems left themvulnerable to other infections? Or if the SARS coronavirus is mutating insidehuman systems into new strains that can re-infect, just as people get the commoncold over and over again because that coronavirus keeps mutating into newstrains.I talked about these new developments with Dr. Mark Jackwood, Professor ofAvian Medicine and one of the world's experts on avian infectious bronchitiscoronaviruses, at the University of Georgia's College of Veterinary Medicine inAthens. I asked Dr. Jackwood if he thought the new SARS coronavirus wouldbe any different from coronaviruses he has studied for fifteen years? And if theSARS virus does mutate, how can a vaccine be developed that will cure SARS?Interview:Mark Jackwood, Ph.D., Professor of Avian Medicine, College of VeterinaryMedicine, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia:Coronaviruses Mutate Into Different StrainsThat Require Different Vaccines\"Coronaviruses change and we can have multiple types that don't cross protect.So, one way you can get the common cold over and over again is that you getone coronavirus that makes you sick. Then the next coronavirus is different, soyou have no immunity to the new one and you get sick again.MUTATIONS IN CORONAVIRUSES ARE BECAUSE THEY ARE MADE UPOF RNA WHICH CANNOT CORRECT ITS OWN MISTAKES AS ITREPLICATES?Right.THIS SAME THING COULD BE GOING ON RIGHT NOW IN CHINA,RIGHT?Sure. The same thing has been going on for years and years. That's the waycoronaviruses have behaved forever and ever. But the other way you can getre-infected is you can actually get disease from the exact same coronavirus. Theway that works is that when you get infected the first time, you develop animmunity to that particular strain of the virus. Then you recover and over time,that local immunity that has built up in your upper respiratory tract will begin tofade. When it fades to the point where it is low enough, that same virus cancome back in and re-infect you. What we've recognized is that the immunity tocoronaviruses in the upper respiratory tract is fairly short lived.IF IT IS TRUE THAT SARS PATIENTS WHO THOUGHT THEY HADRECOVERED ARE NOW ILL AGAIN WITH THE SAME KIND OFSYMPTOMS, WOULD THAT SURPRISE YOU?No, that would not surprise me a bit. Not a bit.WHAT WOULD THAT BODE FOR THE FUTURE?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"That makes it very, very difficult to make a vaccine for a virus like this. Thevaccines that we have for animals and the ones I work with in chickens we haveseveral different vaccines against different types of the virus. We need to mix andmatch these vaccines depending upon the area and which viruses happen to becirculating in that specific area for those animals. We can properly vaccinatethem against the strains that happen to be there circulating at the time.SO YOU ARE CONSTANTLY HAVING TO COME UP WITH NEWVACCINES AS YOU DID BETWEEN DELAWARE 072 AND GEORGIA 98AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT DEVELOPS. YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TOKEEP DEVELOPING VACCINES PER NEW CORONAVIRUS STRAINS?That's exactly right. That is why a good diagnostic test that can distinguishbetween different strains of the virus and also can detect new variations of thevirus is absolutely critical to control this disease.IN ADDITION TO THE QUARANTINE OF PROBABLY MORE THAN 10,000PEOPLE IN THE CITY, THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS MORE FLEDOUT INTO THE COUNTRYSIDE. NOW, THEY ARE SEEING ERUPTIONSOF SARS IN THE COUNTRYSIDE WHERE THOSE PEOPLE FROMBEIJING WENT TO. RIGHT NOW IN THE BEIJING AREA, THIS REALLY ISOUT OF CONTROL, ISN'T IT?It appears to be from the news reports, that's right. What we know about thetransmissibility of this virus it's highly infectious, but you need fairly closecontact between people to actually spread the disease.IF YOU TAKE THE NUMBER OF DEATHS AND DIVIDE THEM BY THENUMBER OF CASES FROM PLACE TO PLACE: TORONTO, CANADA,FOR EXAMPLE, HAS BEEN 13.7%. THAT'S ACROSS THE BOARD IN THEPOPULATION THERE. IN PEOPLE 60 YEARS OR OLDER, THEMORTALITY RATE OF SARS HAS BEEN AVERAGING 20%. IN CHINAAND HONG KONG, IT HAS BEEN AVERAGING 9%. THAT IS ACCORDINGTO THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL. So Little Is Known About Human CoronavirusesThe problem here is that nobody has really done a lot of research on the humancoronaviruses because they are so difficult to grow. We've got two strains thathave been characterized in terms of sequence data and that kind of thing andthey don't seem to be any closer to the SARS virus than any of the animalcoronaviruses. Most of the work that has been done with mutation rates and theability of the virus to change over time have been done with animal viruses. Inparticular, the mouse hepatitis virus which Dr. Michael Lai (Univ. of So. Calif.)has done a lot of that work.With infectious bronchitis virus, of which most of the work has been done in mylab and there are some folks who have done some work in Compton, England.THERE IS NO ONE COMPARABLE ON THE HUMAN SIDE?Not that I'm aware of. The reason for that is that we don't have very manyisolations of human coronaviruses. They are extremely difficult to grow and theyare very transient to isolate the virus from an infected person it's very difficult toget one. I think that if you think back about the SARS outbreak when they weretrying to isolate viruses from those cases initially, it was very difficult for them tofigure out which virus it was and find it in those people.THAT IS ALWAYS THE CHALLENGE WITH CORONAVIRUSES?Always.WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO GROW?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"We just don't have a really good system in the laboratory to grow it initially fromthat primary isolation from the individual. The virus is adapted to grow inpeople. It's not adapted to grow in cell lines that we have propagating in thelaboratory. And we can take those viruses and 'blind pass' them several timeswhere we pass them in the laboratory system hoping they will adapt to thatsystem so they will eventually grow to a point that we can detect them. Indeed,we were very lucky that SARS did that in lab cells. Very lucky that we wereable to do that with the SARS virus because it allowed us to sequence it andstudy it further.HAS ANYONE COME TO YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES ON THEANIMAL CORONAVIRUS SIDE AND SAID, 'CAN YOU HELP US?'No. They haven't and it's interesting that you would ask that. I contacted a friendat CDC who was actually working in the SARS group early on about three orfour days that they found it was a coronavirus that was causing this and offeredmy services. I said we have a diagnostic test for coronaviruses. We've beenworking with it for 15 years and if there is anything at all we can do. We have alot of sequence data and the computer data base for all these viruses, mutationrates and evolutionary trends of coronaviruses and all that. I said, 'If we can doanything, let us know.' And I have not heard back from them at all, not a thing.WHY DO YOU THINK YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TAPPED?I don't know, to be perfectly honest with you. I don't know. Apparently they feelthey don't need help at this point. I really don't know. Maybe their hands are sofull, that they have so many things going on that they don't have time to turnaround twice to ask who can help.BUT THERE AREN'T THAT MANY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD WHO HAVEDONE AS MUCH WORK AS YOU HAVE ON CORONAVIRUSES.On at least this coronavirus that we work with, yes. That's right. The Challenge of Producing A SARS VaccineIF WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO COME UP WITH A VACCINE FOR THECOMMON COLD CORONAVIRUSES AS OF 2003, WHY DO WE THINKTHERE IS EVEN A CHANCE AT COMING UP WITH A VACCINE TO THISSARS CORONAVIRUS?I think what you said is in fact true, but I don't know there are too many peoplewho are actually working on trying to develop a vaccine for humancoronaviruses up to this point because coronaviruses traditionally caused a verymild upper respiratory disease in people. For a vaccine company orpharmaceutical company to make a vaccine for that would be extremelyexpensive to do, to get it licensed through FDA. It might not be to theiradvantage to do that economically because it (common cold) is such a milddisease.Having said that, we have the SARS virus that is a much more virulent form ofthat obviously and is killing people. We certainly can make a vaccine againstthat virus. There's no doubt about that. However, if there are different mutatedforms of that virus out there and that's indeed why these people are gettingreinfected and sick again then we're going to have to make a vaccine against thatmutated form and against the next one and so on.THAT IS THE HUGE PROBLEM. CORONAVIRUSES MUTATE. YOUYOURSELF HAVE FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE ON THE ANIMAL SIDETHAT YOU HAVE TO KEEP COMING UP WITH NEW VACCINES TO NEWSTRAINS. SO WHY SHOULD IT BE ANY DIFFERENT ON THE HUMANSIDE?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I don't expect it would be different on the human side. I think it will be exactlythe same.THEN IS IT FAIR TO CONCLUDE THAT THIS BRAND NEW SARSCORONAVIRUS, NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE ITBEFORE IS NOT GOING TO BE GOING AWAY. IT'S PROBABLY HERE TOSTAY ON THIS PLANET FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE DOINGHARM IN EXPLOSIVE WAYS AND LEAVING THE MEDICALCOMMUNITY WITH CONSTANTLY HAVING TO COME UP WITH NEWVACCINES JUST AS THEY DO WITH THE CHALLENGES OF NEWFLUES?In a way, you're right, yes, but not totally. I don't know that I could agree thatthe virus is going to be here to stay for ever and ever and cause all sorts ofproblems. From what we know about coronaviruses, some of them do that.Some of them don't. Some of them are here for a little while and then they goaway and we don't have a problem with that particular strain again.But the issue here is that over time there will be - if not this (particular SARS)virus - other coronaviruses that can mutate and cause the same kind of disease.So, just because this one may or may not hang around does not necessarily meanthere isn't another one out there that could not do the same kind of mutationand cause a disease situation like SARS.WE NOW HAVE A CLEAR DEMONSTRATION THAT WE HAVE ACORONAVIRUS IN THE HUMAN POPULATION THAT CAN BE LETHALAND BASED ON THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE, THESECORONAVIRUSES ONCE THEY ARE IN A BODY SYSTEM THEY KEEPADAPTING TO THAT SYSTEM JUST AS YOU HAVE SEENCORONAVIRUSES ADAPT IN AVIAN INFECTIOUS BRONCHITIS TO THEPRESSURE OF A VACCINE AND CHANGE SO THAT THEY CAN INFECTBIRDS BEYOND THE VACCINE.Yes, that's exactly right. So we develop a vaccine against this SARS virus and westart vaccinating people for it and they will be protected against that virus, butthe virus will continue to mutate and can possibly mutate to the point that it canbreak through the immunity due to the vaccine and still cause disease.IT'S ALMOST AS IF THE COMMON COLD CORONAVIRUS HASSUDDENLY BECOME A LETHAL COLD VIRUS THAT CAN KILL LUNGCELLS, AND IT'S LOOSE ON THE WORLD.In a way that's right. Yeah. That's what's happening with this particular (SARS)one. Yeah. It's scary.March 17 to May 1, 2003 increase in SARS cases.Source: The New England Journal of Medicine. Could SARS Become A Pandemic?COULD THE OUT-OF-CONTROL SITUATION IN CHINA LEAD TO AN"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"EXPLOSION BEYOND THE BORDER INTO ASIA AND EVENTUALLY GOINTO THE PANDEMIC STATE THAT EVERY ONE HAS WORRIED ABOUTAND TRIED TO PREVENT?I think that's possible, but I've never traveled to China. I don't know the situationat the border, what kind of control that they have. It's a huge country and it'seasy to believe that it could get out of hand quite easily with a virus that is thisinfectious. quite frankly, I think that's what everybody at W.H.O. and CDC arevery scared about and China's ability to handle this. Apparently, from the newsreports I've been reading, this is putting an extreme economic burden on thatcountry.IT'S COLLAPSED. BEIJING STREETS ARE EMPTY AND TODAY, THEOTHER NEWS IS THAT THEY HAVE RUN OUT OF BEDS. THEY DON'THAVE THE HOSPITAL SUPPORT SYSTEM. THIS IS THE PUBLIC HEALTHNIGHTMARE.It really is, isn't it?! The only thing I can tell you is how we try to combat andcontrol this disease and the best way is to get a rapid diagnostic test, which Ithink we have worked out now. But that needs to be made available in the areaswhere the outbreaks are occurring. We need to monitor not just the sick people,but the healthy ones as well and find out where this virus is. Then quarantineand isolation system that we already have been attempting to put in place needsto be used religiously where that virus is detected. And that's not just in China.That's all over the world.INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES.Oh, yes, ma'am, including the United States. But the hinge in controlling thisdisease in my mind is the diagnostic test to have that be extremely rapid and doit on across the board test everyone you can get your hands on in an area whereyou suspect the virus is.W.H.O. HAS BEEN TRYING TO DO THAT IN CHINA, BUT UNTIL LASTWEEK, THE GOVERNMENT WAS STILL HIDING SARS PATIENTS.Well, that's the political issues I think I'm talking about. And just the logistics ofgoing into a country like that with that many people and that widespread of anarea and now you are saying people out in the country are having outbreaks.Boy! Can you imagine the logistical nightmare that would be to do what we'vejust talked about. Incredible!YES, AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE GOVERNMENT IN CHINA ISREALIZING THAT THEY HAVE ON THEIR HANDS IS A LOGISTICAL ANDPUBLIC HEALTH NIGHTMARE AND THEY ARE NOT IN CONTROL OF IT.ANY CHANCE THIS CORONAVIRUS COULD GO AWAY?That's a good question. I don't know that anybody could predict that. I wish Icould. We have examples in animals where we've had coronaviruses that havepopped up in highly populated regions where we have a lot of chickens. Thevirus pops up and causes a lot of disease and then it just goes away and we neversee it again. We've also had other situations where we've had a virus pop up likethat and it spread throughout the entire United States.So, why one does that, why one is here for just a little while and thendisappears, and why another one persists and continues to cause problems, Idon't have any clue. I wish I did know. But it can go either way.\" SARS Is Causing Permanent Lung ScarringDoctors are now reporting evidence of permanent lung scarring. It's called\"pulmonary fibrosis,\" and occurs when lung tissues die and are unable totransport oxygen.
