The similarity is that in both cases theplants were cut off 6 to 12 inches above the ground, some cut flat across andothers cut on a sharp angle. In the Mission, Canada formations, the plants were9 feet tall corn. See Earthfiles 10-1-02 and Earthfiles 10-11-02, plus MoreInformation below.In Defiance, Missouri, the plants were trees varying in trunk diameter from 1inch to 4 inches, according to Police and Fire Reporter Susan Weich of the St.Louis Post-Dispatch newspaper. She traveled to the very rural home of Art andPat Brown where hundreds of young trees were downed in the shape of a capitalT, made from straight corridors 6 feet wide and 80 feet long in both directionsthat intersected. The T-pattern was only 200 yards from the Brown's house. Thefamily was home all Palm Sunday weekend, but never heard nor saw anyone oranything unusual. Yet, somehow hundreds of the young trees growing up in amuddy lake bed were cut off. Most of the severed trunks were missing. The St.Charles Sheriff's Department investigated, but could not find any footprints ortire tracks.I talked with reporter Susan Weich this week about the mystery and got herfirsthand observations from her trip to the T-pattern. Unfortunately, no one hasyet been able to provide any aerial photographs or good close-ups of cuts."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In Defiance, Missouri, on Palm Sunday weekend of April 12-13, 2003,an unexplained T-shaped pattern was created amid saplings and young trees growingin a muddy drylake bed at the home of Pat and Art Brown. Some trees were cut off straightacross;others had sharp angle cuts, all in different directions. A few looked twisted off. Mostof the severed trunks were gone. Diagram by Linda Moulton Howe.Interview:Susan Weich, Police and Fire Reporter, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Bureau inSt. Charles, Missouri: \"You had to go down a pretty steep incline to get downinto the area where the trees are into this dry lake bed. It was very muddy. We'vehad a lot of rain here. all of these pieces of trees, these stumps were sticking upabout ankle high and I was wearing sandals at the time and I was thinking that Iwanted to be very careful because it was very dangerous. I mean it was not likesomeone cleared a path. It was almost like someone was trying to booby trapsomeone because these stumps were very small trees, but some of them wereprobably 4 inches wide and they were hacked off with either a saw or an axeand they were very jagged and pointy and then when you got down into themiddle there, then the pathway started going at an angle towards the house. Youcould see the house directly as you looked down (the path) and there didn'tappear to be any sawdust anywhere like you would expect if someone hadsawed these trees down. Actually, the trees themselves weren't lying aroundanywhere, just the stumps.YOU MEAN THAT EVEN THE TOPS OF THESE TREES THAT HAD BEENCUT OFF WERE NOT THERE?Right, there were some saplings on the ground, but not all of them. Someonehad cut these trees, saplings, down in the shape of a \"T.\" The trees weren't like atraditional crop circle where they are just bent over pieces of corn. As trees, theywere actually cut and they were not all cut the same way. That was kind ofweird because some of them looked like they might have been chopped off withan axe because they were at an angle. Then there would be a higher piece ofwood on one side, but they weren't all cut at the same angle. Some were cut atone angle, some were cut the opposite angle and then some of them looked likethey had been sawed off and others looked like they had been torn over. Itlooked like it was the work of quite a few people, not just one person.The elderly couple don't believe in aliens and they don't think it's aliens, butthey thought it was just someone doing some sort of vandalism. But they can'tfigure out why they would pick the shape of a T. Their name does not beginwith a T and they don't know anyone around whose name begins with T. And ithappened right around Easter, so were joking about if it had been in the shape ofa cross, we might have understood it. But anyway, there weren't any cigarettesaround. There weren't any beer cans lying around, so it didn't look likejuveniles.WHAT ABOUT PRINTS?We didn't see any footprints at all. They actually said it looked like somethingthat could have been done with something called a brush hog. But there weren't"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"any tire tracks, either. So, it must have been done by hand. I think it would havetaken someone quite a few hours to do what they did.I'M WONDERING COULD THESE PEOPLE SEE THIS DRY LAKE BEDFROM THEIR HOUSE?They can see the dry lake bed, but they couldn't see the damage really becausefrom their angle, it doesn't look like there is a path in the trees. But theyapparently the weekend they discovered it were moving some rocks out of agarden and their son was over there and he sort of saw a clearing in the trees andwhen he went down inside, he realized there was this T. The thing that botheredhim was that the leg of the T actually is a direct pathway to the house. Eventhough you can't see it from the house, you can see from the pathway to thehouse. And they were afraid that somebody was hiding in there and planning torob them. They weren't sure. I guess that's what maybe the most creepy thingabout it is: why would someone go through all that trouble? The couple felt liketheir property had been violated.And that was another thing that bothered them. They never heard any noises.They felt certain if someone had been out there with a saw or something thatthey would have heard something.ABOUT HOW FAR FROM THE HOUSE?Probably 200 yards from the house.THAT'S ONLY A COUPLE OF FOOTBALL FIELDS AWAY. HOW COULDTHAT HAPPEN WITHOUT THEM HEARING SOMETHING OR KNOWINGTHAT SOMEBODY WAS OUT WORKING ON THEIR PROPERTY THATCLOSE TO THE HOUSE?I don't know. It's a mystery, that's for sure.DID THE POLICE INVESTIGATE?The police were called out there and the deputy who responded said it lookedlike something you would see on The Discovery Channel or something. He hadnever seen anything like it in all the years he has worked on the force. I certainlyhaven't experienced anything like that and the people whose property this wason, they had a very good sense of humor. We said, 'Do you think it's beavers? Doyou think it's aliens? What do you think it is?' They don't think it's anything buta bunch of kids, but it's still very troubling that someone could come on theirproperty, do so much damage to these trees, and they not hear a thing or see athing.RIGHT. WERE THE LINES THAT WOULD DEFINE THE SWATHS WHERETHE TREES HAD BEEN CUT, WAS IT VERY STRAIGHT?Yes, it was. They were very defined lines. They were about 6 feet wide and verystraight.HOW COULD ANYBODY HAVE GOTTEN DOWN THERE WITHOUTLEAVING TRACKS IN WHAT YOU YOURSELF SAID WAS MUDDY?Right. I don't know. It's very bizarre and like I said, there was none of that, andthey didn't see anybody. It's close enough to the house that if somebody wouldhave driven up there, they would have had to seen lights or something. It's soremote out there that I don't believe anyone could have pulled up without beingseen. Their headlights would have been facing right towards the house.It's kind of spooky, really, to think that someone could get that close to yourhouse.\" Anyone With Information, Please Contact"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"St. Charles County Sheriff's Department636-949-0809More Information:Corn stalk cut off straight across stem about 12 inches above groundin Mission, British Columbia, Canada, corn field in early September 2002.Photograph © 2002 by Paul Anderson. Excerpt from Earthfiles 10-1-02: Paul Anderson, Director, Canadian CropCircle Research Network, Vancouver, British Columbia: Some were brokenoff like that close to the ground, almost at the ground. Other ones, again likethese other ones, were broken off as much as a foot or foot and a half above theground. So, it was all kind of mixed. And then there were a few other isolatedones I did find that were curved over close to the ground and then laying flat onthe ground like that, but not broken. So, it was all kind of mixed. Some like thisand some like that. and you would have some right beside each other. Therewould be one broken completely off and one beside it that was just curved overand not broken.Would you say that what you were looking at in either of the formations inMission could fall into the category of violent energy applied?That's a good question. That is a term I guess you could use for this certainlylooking at it. Again, going back the description I gave for the first formationapplied pretty much to the second one as well, even though that one was almosttwice as large as the first one. It was - there wasn't any radial lay in either one ofthese. It was all just in both of them in the main circle just clockwise lay andthen in the pathways themselves, just straight lay, straight down to the groundgoing out away from the circle respective to each formation.But the way that the plants were all - a lot of people would look at this and say,'Obviously, it was kids with planks doing this.' And yet, the way a lot of theplants were either broken off or completely snapped off, that might be a gooddescription (violence) to use because whatever , who or whatever did this, musthave used a fair amount of force. I would definitely say that just because whenyou had stalks that were completely cut off, whether just at the ground or a footand a half above the ground like other ones, this laying, thrown onto the groundlike match sticks kind of thing - yeah, I think that would be a good description,actually.Violence, violent energy?Ye a h . \"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"earthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
