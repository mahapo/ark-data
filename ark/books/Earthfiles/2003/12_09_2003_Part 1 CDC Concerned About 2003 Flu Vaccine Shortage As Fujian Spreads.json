Julie Gerberding, M.D., Director, Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta,Georgia: \"We have a flu season that is getting off to a rapid start. It has notreached what we call the 'epidemic threshold' yet in terms of deaths. But wewouldn't be surprised to see that happen, given the pattern that is emerging rightnow. The good news is that we've probably vaccinated more people than weever have before against influenza and that means more people than ever areprotected. But the unfortunate situation is that there are still local shortages andwe have to take steps to address those shortages.THERE ARE A LOT OF REPORTS OF CHILDREN BEING ILL AND SOMEOF THEM DYING. ARE THEY HAVING A PARTICULARLY DIFFICULTTIME WITH THE FUJIAN STRAIN?Yes, there are reports of children with serious influenza and deaths. That is verysad and something we are evaluating carefully to see if there is anything aboutthis particular flu strain that is preferentially affecting children or causing moredisease in children. We don't know the answer to that question yet. It is commonfor children to develop severe influenza and for deaths to occur in every fluseason, unfortunately. So, it will take some time to figure this season out.When severe flu occurs, usually it causes a pneumonia in those people who haveto be hospitalized. But a common cause of more severe illness and death is abacterial infection that can complicate the viral influenza illness. Some of thechildren who have died have had complicating bacterial infections.We know that some areas of the country are especially hit hard (Colorado,Texas, Arkansas) with influenza and it's been a very difficult and frighteningthing for many people, particularly in the context of reports of vaccineshortages. Influenza typically kills more than 36,000 Americans each year andsome of those are children and some are seniors and can affect people of all"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"ages.What we know right now is that flu is widespread in 13 states and at the end oflast week there were only 2 states that had not reported any influenza: that wasWashington, D. C. and Massachusetts. But we expect flu to reach those areas.The heaviest hit states so far have been in the West and we're waiting to see whathappens in the East. The bottom line is that we have not peaked the flu seasonthis year. We expect more cases and will keep watching the outbreaks. The mainconcern we are faced with at CDC is the gap between demand for vaccine andthe supply of vaccine. Flu Vaccine ShortageThis year 83 million doses of influenza vaccine were manufactured in thesecategories:- about 4 million doses of Flu-Mist, which is for healthy people between theages of 5 and 49.- about 4 million doses of pediatric formulation for children between the ages of6 months and 23 months- 73 million doses of inactivated (killed viruses) tri-valent vaccine for adultimmunization. That vaccine has largely been distributed and manufacturers arepretty much out of the killed virus vaccine. There are however almost 4 millionof the Flu-Mist that is breathed in the nose for healthy people.You said you are looking for more vaccine products overseas. Whatproducts are those and how much do you think you can get?Secretary Tommy Thompson has asked us to look into purchasing what might beavailable from a European manufacture of flu vaccine in the U. K. (ChironCorp.) They do have less than half a million doses that might be available that islicensed for use in the U. S., but is not cleared because it has not gone throughall the stages of approval. We're working with the FDA and the company to seeif it would be safe to get that vaccine supplies into the United States to have anyimpact on this year's flu season.Is the flu vaccine you are considering purchasing from Europe the same wehave here?The European vaccine that we are looking at has the same protection as thevaccine we are using here. So, it's a different manufacturer, but created using thesame principals and decisions that were used to create the one we're using here. Flu-Mist Dangerous for Some - Made From Live Flu VirusFlu-Mist is made from live flu virus and I understand that is not safe forhealth care professionals to get? Also, is Flu-Mist safe for children overage 5 because it is a live virus? What are the pros and cons of Flu-Mist?The question about Flu-Mist is a good one. Flu mist is a live attenuated virus,unlike the vaccine shot which is a killed influenza virus. Flu-Mist is attenuatedin more than one way, but one of the ways is that it does not grow very well atcertain temperatures and so it's very unlikely to cause flu disease. But becausethere is concern that in an immuno-suppressed individual perhaps there could begreater potential for even an attenuated virus to cause severe disease ofinfluenza-like illness, it's not been recommended for people in those groups. Inaddition, health care workers who take care of people in those groups shouldnot have contact with the patients after they have the nasal spray."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Unusually Severe Symptoms in Adults and ChildrenThere are unusual symptoms associated with this flu, stomach cramps inadults and some mental status changes in children. Is this unusualappearing this year? And could you comment on the multi-drug-resistantstaph infection is complicating flu this year in a way we haven't seenbefore?The range of symptoms in flu can include stomach and intestinal cramping andnausea. So the abdominal symptoms aren't outside what might be seen in atypical flu season.In children who are severely ill and have high fever, there are many things thatcan be related. I don't know the specifics of the cases you are reporting, but ifthere is anything unusual, I'm sure the investigators will look into that.Drug-resistant bacterial staph infections are often seen in association withinfluenza and when a drug-resistant staph would complicate influenza. Thereare some reports, but we don't have the organisms here at CDC. But it wouldn'tsurprise me to see staph-resistant bacteria complicating influenza patients. Itadds an additional complexity to the treatment.\" See Part 2: Unprecedented Number of Influenza A Complications and Deathsin Children.We b s it e :http://www.cdc.govCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
