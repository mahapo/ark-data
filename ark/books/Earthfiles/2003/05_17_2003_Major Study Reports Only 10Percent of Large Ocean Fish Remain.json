May 16, 2003 Halifax, Nova Scotia - For years, marine biologists havewarned that many ocean creatures are facing elimination in the largest extinctionevent since the dinosaurs were hit by a big asteroid. Now comes a majorten-year-long study reported in Nature this week that concludes only 10% ofbig ocean fish are left, compared to their populations 50 years ago. In thetropics, the guitar fish and grouper are nearly gone; off the coast ofNewfoundland, the cod, haddock and halibut have never replenished; and in theopen oceans the magnificent large predators - sharks, bluefin tuna, gilfish,swordfish, marlin - that have dominated for so long are down to their lowestnumbers on record.Bow-mouth guitar fish courtesy AdRiver.The funding for the study was the Pew Charitable Trust and the lead author isProfessor Ransom Myers, a fisheries biologist at Dalhousie University in Halifax,Nova Scotia, Canada. I talked with him this week about the sobering facts of somany sharks, bluefin tuna, sturgeon and other big fish facing extinction.Ransom Myers, Ph.D., Professor of Biology, Dalhousie University, Halifax,Nova Scotia, Canada: \"The fundamental question I wanted to ask was: whatdid the world's oceans look like before massive commercial exploitation on anindustrial level? So we went back and we looked at old data and in a few placesin the world, we have data that goes back to the very beginning of industrialfishing in the southern Grand Banks of Newfoundland, in the Gulf of Thailand,and in about half the world's oceans, we have data that allows us to estimate theabundance and weight of fish from the very beginning of commercialexploitation.WHICH IS AROUND 1950?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"It depends on the area, but 1950 for most areas.AND WHAT DID YOU FIND?Basically what we found was everywhere in the world where we had data, theabundance and weight of the fish combined was at least ten times greater thanwhat we find now. This is for the larger fish. That is, the top predators of theworld's oceans have been reduced by a factor of ten, they are one-tenth of whatthey were.All around the world wherever you have data, the great sharks of the world aregoing the way of the dinosaurs. The white sharks, the hammerheads, these sharksare declining everywhere we have data at enormous rates. Just for these sharkspecies to survive, we need to reduce fishing mortality. We need to reduce thenumber of hooks in the water by 50 or 60 percent.100 million sharks were killed in 2002.Image courtesy Shark Research Institute.HOW COULD YOU GET THAT DONE?With national boundaries, it just requires political will. Alaska has done it. NewZealand has largely done it. It's just a matter of will. Internationally, the peopleof the world have decided that it was intolerable for the great whales to goextinct. It was intolerable for the mass destruction that resulted from drift netfishing in the north Pacific the destruction of sea birds and many mammals andturtles. This was simply reasonable and human because we really like largeanimals. We enjoy hunting and fishing. We enjoy looking at them and knowingthese great animals exist. I believe that's why the people of the world willdemand their preservation.YOU HAVE STATED THAT ALL OF THE BIG FISH, INCLUDING SHARKS,ARE FACING EXTINCTION AND I KNOW THAT IN ONE OF YOURINTERVIEWS, YOU WERE QUOTED AS WARNING THAT ALL OF THEWORLD'S GREAT FISH COULD GO THE WAY OF THE DINOSAURS,WHICH IS TOTAL EXTINCTION, IF IMMEDIATE ACTION IS NOT TAKEN.IF WE DID LOSE THE SHARKS AND LARGE PREDATORS IN ALL THEOCEANS OF THE WORLD THAT YOU'VE STUDIED, WHAT WOULD THECONSEQUENCES BE ON THE REST OF THE FOOD CHAIN?We don't know. But wherever we studied this in detail, for example, if youoverfish coral reefs, what you find is they are overgrown by algae and scum. Youcan easily turn great beautiful coral reefs into scummy gunk simply by taking outall the predators. Similarly, if you remove predators on land, very unusual,unpredictable things will happen in ecosystems. We need the large predators.I think a good analogy for this is the great Pleistocene extinction. When humansfirst arrived in North America, there were woolly rhinoceroses and mammothsand mastodons and giant ground sloth. Humans were very good at killinganimals and wiped out seventy large species in just a few centuries, a very rapidand massive extinction. Then, the technology was sharpened stones attached tospears and group hunting.In the last fifty years, we have covered the world in much more advanced, muchmore sophisticated technology and in general, we haven't been keeping verygood track of what's going on."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHY WOULD THE SHARK, WHICH HAS LASTED FOR SO MANY EONS,BE THE ANIMAL NOW THAT SEEMS THE ONE MOST IN CRISIS ANDFACED WITH EXTINCTION?They are like humans in many ways. They often give birth, live, to relatively fewoffspring. They take a very long time to reach maturity. So you have a speciesthat may not mature until age 10 or older, produce a few offspring, and if theyare caught very efficiently by the fishing gear, they can quickly be driventowards extinction simply because the rate at which you are catching them isfaster than the rate that they can reproduce.DOES ANYONE HAVE AN IDEA ABOUT WHAT WOULD BE THECONSEQUENCES IN THE OCEANS OF THE WORLD IF ALL OF THESHARKS WERE GONE?We only have guesses. We know that in areas where we have over-fished, forexample, like cod in Newfoundland and associated species, that those specieshave not recovered after we have fished them. This was totally unpredicted andit's not understood by ecologists. We just simply don't understand these systemswell enough and it's so difficult to measure species other than fishes - things likejellyfish and squid are very difficult for us to estimate and they are key players inthe marine ecosystem. So we can't predict.Newfoundland cod have never recovered from overfishing.Photograph courtesy Ransom Myers.ISN'T IT TRUE THAT THE BIG BELUGA STURGEON IS JUST ABOUTGONE AND THAT WILL BE THE END OF THE DELECTABLE CAVIAR?There will probably be replacements by cheaper caviar, but the fundamentaldifficulty is if you have anything very valuable as a large sturgeon with tens ofthousands of dollars worth of roe, caviar, it's very difficult to control (fishermengoing after them).Beluga sturgeon could be completely gone in the oceans in another ten years."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Beluga sturgeon eggs, known as caviar, sells for more than $40/ounce.Sturgeon photographs © 2003 by Orion Online.Similarly the $40,000 giant bluefin tuna are so valuable, it's economicallyworthwhile to fish them even though there are very few of them left. Similarly,for the abalone off the coast of South Africa, they are so valuable in certainmarkets that it's very difficult to police and control the harvesting of theseanimals.THERE ARE ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE NATURE CONSERVANCYGROUP THAT BUYS UP LAND IN PLACES LIKE BRAZIL AND OTHERCOUNTRIES TO TRY TO PREVENT THE CUTTING AND BURNINGDOWN OF RAINFORESTS. IS THERE ANY WAY OF PAYING NATIONSTHROUGH THE U. N. OR SOME OTHER GROUP TO NOT FISH ANDOVERFISH THE SHARKS AND SOME OF THE VERY VALUABLE FISHLIKE THE BLUEFIN TUNA?Once it's understood that the largest species face extinction completelyunnecessarily simply because of over-harvesting and greed, the people of theworld, the children of the world, will demand that the great sharks not go theway of the dinosaurs.HAVE YOU TALKED WITH PEOPLE IN THE CANADIAN OR U. S.GOVERNMENTS ABOUT WHAT ACTIONS COULD BE TAKEN NOW TOHALT THE MASSIVE DECLINES IN THE BIG FISH POPULATIONS?I think that both governments are becoming aware of this, but it is very difficultto act politically. If you own a fishing boat, there is so much demand to harvestfish so that you can pay off your mortgage on your boat and on your house andyou are in competition with the next fisherman, or fishermen from the nextcountry. What our calculations show is that you have to reduce the mortality onthe sharks by 50 or 60 percent. That means reducing, for example, the numberof hooks in the water where sharks live by 50 or 60%. This doesn't mean youhave to quit fishing. This doesn't mean you can't have a productive fishery. Itsimply means you have to fish responsibly.\"We b s it e :http://www.mscs.dal.ca/~myers/welcome.htmlhttp://www.sharks.org/main_menu.htmlhttp://fish.dal.ca/~myers/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
