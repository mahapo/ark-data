Hamilton. Bill Hamilton: HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANY SIMILAR ACTIVITY AT THEPAPOOSE LAKE SITE, S-4? 4-3. Level 3, which is basically considered the housing unit. It's also beencalled various things. It's been called the Museum. It's been called theHousing Unit. It's been called the Hall of Tortures. An animal retentionfacility. One of the horrifying things about the S-4 facility is travelingin the elevator system. There is enough of a sound conduit in the elevatorsystem where you can hear the sounds of the test subjects from the thirdfloor while you are in the elevators on various other floors. And the soundsare akin to what I heard at the Dulce facility. Every once in awhile you can hear the sounds of other vertebrates, dogs,cats, monkeys screaming - some of which are natural behaviors due to howthey are being kept. Very sterile. When I say sterile, I mean not conduciveto a play environment. More of a housing facility like a kennel. Then youoccasionally hear are the sounds you know are one of your brothers orsisters. NOW, J-ROD WAS KEPT ON THE 5TH LEVEL, THE BOTTOM MOSTLEVEL TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN A CLEAN ENVIRONMENTAL....? Pressurized hydrogen clean sphere, yes. PART OF WHAT WAS THE ATMOSPHERIC MIXTURE THAT J-ROD WASBREATHING - WAS THAT DIFFERENT FROM OUR OWN OXYGEN-NITROGEN ATMOSPHERE IN WHAT RESPECT? In the respect that the larger partial pressure of the environment washydrogen and in so doing, we have a pressurization and temperaturedifference. It was an extremely cold facility within the clean sphere andthere was insufficient oxygen within the gaseous mixture to support humanlife, human as we understand it presently. In other words, if I would havebeen introduced into the clean sphere not wearing a TBS (sp?), I would diefairly rapidly from asphyxiation and from cold. WAS THE MIXTURE FLAMMABLE? Yes. Flammable - not flammable at the temperature that it was beingmaintained. BECAUSE IT WAS A COLD TEMPERATURE?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" It was extremely cold, yes. I don't remember the exact number. It was a longtime ago since I was in there. WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME? 1994? 1995? 1995, I believe. You're probably referring back to the Q-94 document. YES. That is in fact a date. The 94 is in fact a date. And the number would be109 - the infamous 109 (Is it 109-A? or 1098?) B, C, D and E. Unfortunately,the rest of the document did not leak. Sorry, I just thought about how itgot out by helping my friends. THIS REQUEST, WHICH I GUESS YOU TURNED DOWN (PAPILLOMAVIRUS) AT DULCE AND THEY WEREN'T TOO HAPPY ABOUT, I'M SURE. I turned down the request the following morning at which point, I wasthreatened to be maintained as a permanent resident. I asked them whether ornot I would be taken to the Kennel, so to speak - would that be the resultof my residency. They kind of laughed it off almost carelessly. I wastransported later that afternoon back to the Air Force Base near Nelliswhere I was taken back to Watertown where I was released to my ownrecognizance and back to my residence. DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GAINED FURTHER INSIGHT ABOUT WHATTHE PROGRAM IS ABOUT AND WHAT MAJESTIC IS DOING? I know full well what Majestic is doing on a few different levels. I don'tknow all of the activities. I wouldn't be privy to them, but I know fullwell the activities involving the association of the J-Rods - I know fullwell that the work that they have undergone involving Rain Dancer - which isa compartmentalized project within the chemtrail project - and I know fullwell what they are involved with regard to BCW work (biological-chemicalwarfare) involving the retro-viruses. a) I agree with trying to help, but moving cautiously.b) The second of the two, I am in disagreement with the philosophy becauseit was the employment of a hela???? restriction virus, and (probably helicase)c) I'm in total disagreement at the moral and ethical reasons. WAS THERE ANY INDICATION TO YOU THAT WE ARE STILL CAUGHTON A TIME LINE THAT IS PROBABLY HEADED FOR FUTURECATASTROPHE? We're talking about the Doctrine of the Converging Time Lines? YES, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT. As I understand from - I've got a personal - how can I have personalexperience with a time paradox, aside from living in the reality in whichwe exist - but from what I understand from what I've read and from theconversations to which I have been privy, we are in fact living in a timeera, a reality time era which hodge podges together the reality time linethat we would normally associate with moving from A to B, cause to effect,with the nexus being the passage of clock time. And a hodge podging togethersuperimposed upon that in our reality of errors that we made in our futureto attempt to go back into our past to correct the problems of our future.Those results have hodge podged a - rather than splitting a time stream asis - maybe such people as Michio Kaiku would posit - I'm no theoreticalphysicist. I'm just a lowly biologist that looks at patterns. but it hodge podges in a real sense to us - does things which happened, orare to happen in the future with our present time line due to aninterruption of the time stream. Instead of splitting into two time streams,what happened is that as soon as we mucked around with something, weoverlaid a second time stream into the present reality. The problem withthat, as I understand it, is that we did it more than once. so what we haveis a snowball effect, a time stream upon timestream. OK, I SEE WHAT YOU ARE SEEING - A LOOP WITHIN A LOOP?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Yes, and more I would say in my framework, moving from A to B, looping likethis, and each of those node would be an overlay of a time stream. So themore we muck with it, the worse we get. AND THE CRITICAL PERIOD OF TIME IS COMING UP IN ABOUT TENYEARS? The critical period, according to the history that has not technically beenwritten - if you walk outside, they are going to charge you withincoherency. (laughter) The history has not been written yet if you walkoutside of here. But according to the history books that I read, there is adifficulty - unless there is a further overlay of something in the timestream that either corrects it or gets us out of the Paradox in which welive. I don't know how the hell that would happen. I don't pretend Iunderstand that kind of stuff. Put a slide in front of me and I'll do amicro on it, OK. But.... yeah, around 2012. We're talking about the famous December 21, 2012in the Mayan issues. The catastrophe is alleged to have and to occur ataround that date, yes. And what we can do about it, I have no clue. I haveno clue. BUT WE HAVE A SPLIT, SO TO SPEAK, IN THE HUMAN SPECIES. Following the catastrophe, there is a split between those individuals whotake a more spiritual path and will move forward to places such as the Moonand Mars, and then onward from there to Orion. And those folks who take amore rudimentary path because it's the alleged spiritual nature of humankindfrom the philosophy at that time which lead us to not deal with the pressingproblems of the day because we were too busy fighting our petty religiousbattles that then go off into a more logical mathematical, numerologicalphilosophy. those folks who then progress slower because of the lack ofambition, the lack of spiritual ambition, they are gradually moving on tothe Reticulum area. (Zeta Reticulum 1 and 2, binary star system in Milky WayGalaxy). They then become the J-Rods. THEY BECOME, BY WHAT PROCESS? IS IT SOME KIND OF RADIATIONMUTATION THAT TAKES PLACE IN THEIR CELL STRUCTURE? The adaptive radiation occurs time past the catastrophe. This is accordingto what I've read. The only thing I can say for sure, say for damn sure! -is the interaction with the being I've had in Sector 4. I can say nothingauthoritatively about the peculiar adaptive radiation that occurred towardOrion - the spiritual half of the species who were all in the catastrophe. -(?words uncertain there) - aside from the few things I've read about it(sounds like: any chap going on at Jahova)???? But, the J-Rods undergo adaptive radiation to the form that we see presently - theword \"presently\" is kind of relative when it comes to these issues now - butpresently, dueto time and exposure after they have moved off to Reticulum. The heightbegan to decrease as a function of micro-evolutionary changes. The eye size,the same. The eyes started getting larger, which by the way is aninteresting thing because as the eyes were getting larger - this is beforethe true darkening via the cover lenses and the double lid system that theyhave - it's a very beautiful architecture. But something happened - they are traveling back into time - that is part ofthe problem - they actually landed in the Land of Enchantment (New Mexico)before the structures changed for their eyes. THE LAND OF ENCHANTMENT. 1947. NEW MEXICO, RIGHT? Yes. I'm not so certain how close the young lady was - this fits in her ownlife, Jean Crain. But the little folks that were obtained there were notfully - what I would say fully Greys at the time - and they would now becalled J-Rods at the time because they had not moved later on to the Gleise"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"system to gradually try to correct the problem they are making worse andworse. Paradoxes. I sound incoherent. (laughter) THIS MAY HAVE BEEN AT SOME POINT WHERE THEY HADDEVELOPED SPACE AND TIME TRAVEL, BUT NOT AT THE LATERSTAGES - MAYBE THE EARLIER? Well, the evolution hadn't even been completed at that point. Completedleading to the point where I had experience of meeting the gentleman that Imet at Sector 4. it's difficult. We were trained to call them specimens andthey, frankly, are NOT specimens. People are people. They had not developedthe darkening system yet. In fact, that was a micro-evolutionary change thatoccurred because of the particular solar issues that were going on theplanet that we - meaning the shorter folks - moved off to. These stages werejust beginning to take place at the time when they were working with timetravel issues and landed by whatever means in 1947. Their eyes actuallycontained a structure, while larger - but very similar to ours which theydon't have now. But that may account for the varying opinions about thedarkened eyes and the structure of the eyes that the eyewitnesses providedfrom - I guess, it was the Brazel ranch or something like that. I understandthere was some kind of difference between the two descriptions. WHOSE TWO DESCRIPTIONS? I've not seen any of the bodies from Roswell, so Ican't speak for certain on that. YOU DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY GET BRIEFED ON WHAT HAPPENED ATROSWELL? Well, in the briefing books, there were mentions. And there were probably avery heavy specific briefing in there, but when I was sort of brought up tothe Groom area - when we were provided with the briefing books - frankly, Ididn't care. I thought I was there, to be very honest with you, to work withsome sort of bio-remediation project, leading to what ended up in reality isthe Rain Dancer program - the Rain Dancer and chemtrail program because Iwas extremely interested at the time in the pathology and histology, but Iwas also extremely interested in biospherics, which is what got meinterested in forwarding me with the NASA folks and the ABL project, theArmy Biological Lab project. So, I wasn't particularly interested.In fact, before I experienced the gentleman in the clean sphere, I franklythought honestly that those people who believed in aliens were (laughter)Egg on my face! TO YOUR KNOWLEDGE, ARE THERE ALIENS AT THE DULCEFACILITY? OR WERE YOU NOT MADE AWARE OF ANY? I was in fact made aware in a conversation that there are processes underwaywhereby they are in fact producing hybrids. And this is just - it isinconceivable! We are in the middle of a Paradox as it is. We've got our ownprogeny making our Paradox worse. And we're adding to it!! God only knowswhere this is going to lead to simply because we are producing these - Idon't want to say monsters because I don't know what, I don't know what!!!it is, to be very honest with you. I do know we have taken the process ofnatural selection and thrown it out the window. And not only have we donethat, we have done so willfully and with negligence toward our own future.It's extremely angering to me because I'm watching us - I'm going to have towatch my language here - I'm watching us muck our world at worse withindifference. WITH ARROGANCE (BJ) (words unclear????) As soon as you add two things together which are notmeant to be together. It's the old thing that if you want to go into thepopular movies - dinosaurs and them being separated by 65 million years ofhistory in the Jurassic Park or whatever - it's the rape of the naturalworld. Well, by God, he got it right - we are raping her!!!! And damn us forus, damn us for it. WHAT DOES IT ACCOMPLISH TO PRODUCE HYBRIDS? That they didn't tell me, not specifically. I can theorize. I can theorize"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"what they are doing is taking the Aquarius Project and taking it to the nextstep, the next level, if you will. Like taking the atom bomb and turning itinto the hydrogen bomb, no matter what evil comes out of it. BJ: AT THE END OF THE Q-94 DOCUMENT, THEY MADE SOMERATHER STRONG STATEMENTS AGAINST YOU AND EXACTLY THIS. \"Wild types.\" \"WILD TYPES.\" Yes, see the problem is this: we have viruses that are resident within ourgenome. When you begin combining - or cloning, if you will, serologicalcloning - when you begin doing cloning which is a better term - you begincombining the retro-viruses that are present in our genome (we would say\"naturally\"). No one really knows what is in there because of the reality inwhich we are dealing. And those things that we know are non-resident, notnormally resident - what are we possibly going to release? Can any biologisttell us what the origin of viruses are? They tell us they are evolutionaryarchives, throwbacks to a time immemorial in the evolutionary history oflife on Earth. Really!! I was asked about inconsistencies a little while ago, about U.S. versusU.S.M.C. I brought out an inconsistency having to do with my own birth date,an inconsistency. 1960 versus 1964. I say, 'Gosh, I was awfully young then.'Well, how young were we when man evolved on this planet? Or in fact wasseeded? How young were we then? How do we know? We don't. ?????? causes theresident danger of even the project within which I'm currently working. WHICH IS THE STAR FLOWER PROJECT? It's a subset of a Star Flower - well, I originally prodded it's name toLotus and Star Flower ended up being an umbrella project above it. I'VE SEEN THAT SPELLED TWO WAYS: STAR OR STAAR. The way I originally envisioned it was STAR. Then you see the way theyapplied it within the actual classification system which is STAAR. DOES THAT REFER TO A GROUP? It's a bean box. We're referred to as bean boxes. I'm in a particular beanbox which is called Aquarius. There is a STAAR bean box and that groupspecifically deals with time issues, with issues involving the larger milieuof extraterrestrial interactions. And with the historical issues involvingthe imprints of the extraterrestrials on civilization past and how thoseimprints affect us today. That's as I understand it. But that's not my beanbox. THAT'S STAR? That's STAAR. IS THAT STRATEGIC - ??? ** See footnote: (3) That's not my bean box.\" **(1) Dan called S-4 either Sector 4 or Site 4 variously.(2) FM usually means \"Facility Maintenance\"(3) Strategic Tactical Advanced Alien Response Continued in Part 3More Information:Other Earthfiles.com Reports - See Archives:· 10/05/2002 -- Part 2 - J-Rod and Microbiologist Dan B.
