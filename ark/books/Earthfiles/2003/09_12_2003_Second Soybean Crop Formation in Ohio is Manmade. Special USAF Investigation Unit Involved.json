Aerial photograph © 2003 by Roger Sugden and Jeffrey Wilson. September 12, 2003 Bainbridge, Ohio - On Tuesday this week, September 9,crop circle investigators, Jeffrey Wilson and Roger Sugden, called to tell me asecond soybean circle had been spotted near Bainbridge, Ohio, not far from anancient mound called \"Seip.\" The new formation resembled a Mercedes hoodornament and is about twenty miles from the first soybean formation discoveredon August 24, 2003, near the Serpent Mound outside Peebles and LocustGrove, Ohio.The ancient Serpent Mound, built around 800 A.D. or earlier, lies alongsideBrush Creek outside Peebles and Locust Grove, Ohio. About twenty miles northeast,is another ancient mound called Seip in Bainbridge, Ohio. Plant, soil, radiation andelectromagnetic field tests in the soybean formation near the Serpent Mound have allhad anomalous results. Tests at the Seip Mound soybean formation have been completelynormal.Jeff and his colleagues, Roger Sugden and Charles Leitzau, have now been up ina plane to take aerials and down on the ground to investigate the soybeans.Unlike the truly mysterious and anomalous Serpent Mound soybean formation,this second one near the Seip Mound is definitely manmade, Jeff says.Jeff Wilson has been in more than a hundred crop formations in the centralUnited States the past few years, so I asked him to describe what he found in thenew Seip pattern that is clearly different from the anomalous Serpent Mound"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"formation since both are in soybeans.Interview:Jeffrey Wilson, Independent Crop Formation Investigator, Master'sDegree in General Science, Dexter, Michigan: \"The Seip formation is a 100%authentic hoax! We found plenty of evidence of that from mechanical damage tohuge errors in the design to we even found a gum wrapper out there. It is quitelarge. It is about 400 feet across, but it is one huge mess!YOU HAVE BEEN INSIDE OF BOTH THE SERPENT MOUND AND NOWTHE SEIP ONE. CAN YOU GIVE THE LAY AUDIENCE A KIND OFOVERVIEW ABOUT WHY THE SERPENT MOUND IS SO GENUINELYMYSTERIOUS AND THE SEIP MOUND IS SO OBVIOUSLY MANMADEAND HOAXED?In this (Seip) case, all of the plants were smashed mechanically instead ofwhatever energy put down the ones over by Serpent Mound. There was a cleardistinction between the way the plants looked on the ground. I'll have to sendyou the photographs so you can see the difference. Almost all of the plantsinside this new formation were all dead, like someone had come in and kickedthe plants down every which way. It was pretty apparent quickly that this wasjust one gigantic mess.WERE MOST OF THE SOYBEAN PLANTS IN THE SEIP FORMATIONBROKEN COMPARED?Probably 90% or more.OK, 90% OR MORE WERE BROKEN, BUT IN THE SERPENT MOUNDFORMATION...Maybe 30% were.OK, SO 70% WERE NOT IN THE SERPENT MOUND.TO MAKE A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE TRULY MYSTERIOUSFORMATION, WHICH I THINK WE ALL FEEL THAT THE SERPENTMOUND IS, AND WHAT HAPPENED AT SEIP, WHY WOULD ANY OF THEPLANTS BE BROKEN IN THE SERPENT MOUND FORMATION?I think that's just the nature of the plants themselves. When you try to bend overa soybean plant, it snaps pretty quickly. It snaps quicker than if you try to bendcelery. You can just start to bend it slightly and it will just snap. So I think thatwhen whatever energy went down over by Serpent Mound, most of the plantswent down without being snapped. But in some areas, there were I want to saythere were three or four areas about 10 to 12 feet long in which that wholesection, all the plants had been snapped. And it may be such that whatever theenergy is, it had to use more force or energy there to get those plants to go downand they just snapped. I'm not really sure. I couldn't give a completeexplanation. I'm just hazarding a guess at this point. Not A Single Anomaly in Seip Formation TestsWe also did the full range of testing and we tested for radioactivity. We did themagnetic field testing. We did the electric field testing. We did all that stuff. Andat no point did we get anything anomalous at all. In fact, we got mostly zeroeson everything.AGAIN, ANOTHER CONTRAST SINCE THE SERPENT MOUND YOU SAIDWAS PERHAPS THE FIRST FORMATION OUT OF MORE THAN AHUNDRED THAT YOU'VE INVESTIGATED IN WHICH EVERY SINGLETEST SHOWED ANOMALIES."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Correct. In this one (Seip), not a single test showed a single anomaly. We lookedat the plants very carefully and the tests that Chuck (Charles) Lietzau and I didwhere we looked at the damage to the leaf bases, I spent quite a bit of time outthere looking at the leaf bases in this formation and I didn't find a single leafbase that had any sort of desiccation on (dried or heat damage) it at all. Therewas no damage at all to any of the leaf bases, even though the plants had beensnapped and broken right off and dried out and dead, there wasn't that kind ofdamage.Normal leaf bases (no evidence of desiccation or heat)throughout the soybean formation near the Seip Mound in Bainbridge, Ohio.Photograph © 2003 by Roger Sugden and Jeffrey Wilson.Are Some Manmade Formations Being Madeby An Agency to Deliberately Confuse the Public?\"Mr. Rantala reported that there was no apparent means for the wheat tohave been swirled and flattened nothing unusual in the sky, no lights, nounusual sounds, and no unusual odors. Whatever the energetic force wasthat caused the circles to form, it was beyond the range of visible sight.\" -Jeff Wilson, July 2003 View from Art Rantala's workshop in Mayville, Wisconsin, of the three circleshe allegedly saw go down one after the other over a time span of about 15 seconds inthewheat field across the road. It was raining, but no wind or thunderstorm.Photograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson.When we started this summer, we visited what we found afterwards was anauthentic formation in between Mayville and Kekoskee, Wisconsin the threecircles that were eyewitnessed by Art Rantala (at 7:40 a.m. CDT on July 4,2003. See More Information below).Above: Mayville, Wisconsin circles that resident Art Rantalaallegedly watched form one at a time over about 15 seconds while rainwas falling on the wheat field. Below, the small circle of standingwheat inside one of the three Mayville circles. Photographs"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"© 2003 by MilwaukeeChannel.com.HE SAW THEM COME DOWN IN A THUNDERSTORM?Well, the circles formed during a rainstorm, but there was no wind, no lightning,no UFOS, nothing that made the circles. They just swirled down, all three insuccession, one at a time in about 15 seconds.AND IT WAS ONLY RAINING.It was just raining. That was it. We went to that formation and a week later, therewas a hoax circle that showed up about two miles away in wheat. It was clearlya hoax.We then took another trip out to Wisconsin and discovered the authenticformation near Clyman that was reported July 18, about 20 miles from theMayville crop circles discovered earlier. Then another week went by and yetanother hoaxed formation showed up in corn.Then in the last week of august, we went down to visit this crop circle insoybeans near Serpent Mound, and a week after that, this one in Bainbridgeshows up twenty miles away.THAT IS CLEARLY A HOAX.That is clearly a hoax. So we seem to be seeing a pattern that somebody outthere is copy catting or trying to show that hoaxed circles are the same asauthentic ones, or that they can be made. But we have managed to identify thehoaxed ones in every case.AND THAT WHICH IS TRYING TO MUDDY THE WATERS HERE COULDBE THE FINGER OF OUR GOVERNMENT?That's a possibility and we don't know for sure. But when I was contacted againby the people that we met inside the Mayville, Ohio, crop circle who claimedthey were from the military, they asked us specifically about what we had seenin that hoaxed corn circle later.USAF man who identified himself to Jeffrey Wilson and Roger Sugdenin the July 2003 Mayville, Wisconsin, wheat formation as being a member of a \"SpecialCropCircle Investigative Unit in the US Air Force,\" that had been looking into this Mayvilleformationfor a couple of weeks, temporarily based out of a hanger in Milwaukee.Photograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson and Roger Sugden.We thought that was kind of odd that out of all the formations that we had beento in Wisconsin, that (hoaxed one in corn) was the one they wanted informationon. So, whether they were trying to test us to see if we could identify theirhandiwork or not, that's as good a suspicion as anything else."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE IMPLICATION IS THAT BOTH IN ENGLAND AND IN THE UNITEDSTATES, THERE ARE ORGANIZED EFFORTS TO MUDDY THE WATERSAND KEEP THE PUBLIC IN CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT IS HOAXED ANDWHAT IS NOT?Yes, that seems to be what whoever is making these (hoaxed patterns) wants,that might be one of their aims, or goals, to confuse. And I think it is maybegetting us to waste more resources and waste more time and kind of run usaround trying to chase after these hoaxed ones because we have to check themout. And they know that. And they are going to continue to put them downwhenever we find a new (real) one.\"More Information:US Military Visited After Mayville, Wisconsin,Circles Formed In RainExcerpt from Jeffrey Wilson, Roger Sugden, Charles Lietzau and Gary Kahilmereport:(Full report at: www.cropcirclenews.com)\"Roger Sugden and I arrived at the formation after Roger's aerial photoflight, meeting Dr. Lietzau and Gary Kahilmer who were already there. Wewere surprised by the appearance of a military helicopter circling theformation very low to the ground. View of the military helicopter circling over the Mayville, Wisconsin,crop formation in July 2003. Photograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson and RogerSugden. The helicopter circled the formation for a few minutes (with our team inexcited amazement), at which point it then flew off in the direction of theHoricon Marsh. It looked as if it flew the length of the marsh, and thenflew back in our direction, but not as close. It then flew off towards theSoutheast where we eventually lost sight of it. In all the crop circle reportsin the USA in my database (over 250) I have never seen one thatmentioned overflights by US military helicopters, or that the US militarymight be interested in crop circle reports. Of course, we have seen thisrepeatedly in the UK, but not in the USA.After the helicopter left and ourteam settled down, we returned to gathering additional soil and plantsamples from the field. After about 40-45 minutes, I noticed that we werealso under surveillance on the ground. Looking up the hill towards Mr. (Arthur) Rantala's workshop, I noticed aman in a camouflage uniform watching us with binoculars.After I informedthe rest of the team that we were being watched, the uniformed soldier gotinto his car, drove down the hill towards where we were parked, andslowly passed us noting our license plates. He drove to the end of theblock, turned his car around, drove back to where we were standing andparked his car. He got out and walked directly into the formation. Dr.Lietzau was practically jogging after him into the field. We decided on thespot that since we were going to publish our results on the Internet foreveryone to share, we were not going to hold back anything from themilitary."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" As we chatted with this soldier from the US Air Force (who we had nowidentified by his uniform), he told us that he was part of a Special CropCircle Investigative Unit in the US Air Force, and that they had beenlooking into this formation for the past couple of weeks, temporarily basedout of a hanger in Milwaukee. He also told us that this unit was originallybased out of Scott Air Force base located in Illinois (southeast of St.Louis, Missouri). He further told us that this team had investigated twocrop circles that appeared near \"Downing, Illinois\" last summer (2002), butthat he hadn't participated in that investigation -- but others had. We hadnot heard of that crop circle report in Illinois, so we are checking to verifythat information. As far as we have uncovered, there is a \"Downing Park,Illinois\" which isn't too far from Scott A.F.B., but no \"Downing, Illinois\"(using MapQuest and MS Streets), so Downing Park is what he may havemeant. [If anyone has information about this reported formation pleasecontact us and let us know so we can confirm this piece of information.] US Air Force soldier, July 2003, in Mayville, Ohio, formationof three circles that Arthur Rantala allegedly watched form in the rain on July 4,2003.Photograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson and Roger Sugden. I (Jeff Wilson) played tour guide, and walked him around the formation --pointing out the various crop lay anomalies, our ideas on where theformation began to be flattened, and how various parts of it were flattenedin which order. We told him of some of our plant anomaly findings, andasked several questions (including a few rather silly ones) most of whichhe dodged or declined to answer. I offered my contact information to him,which he took, and our team offered to cooperate with his investigativeteam by providing them with any information we might find (and hopingthey might reciprocate). I told him that we had traveled up from Michigan,and that our investigative report would be published onCropCircleNews.com. He said he was familiar with the website, andbelieved that someone from his team would most likely get in contact withme soon about the formation. He said he knew we were from Michigan(most likely from our license plates), and that their team was familiar withCropCircleNews.com. He stayed in the formation about 10-15 minutes, atwhich point he seemed satisfied, and he returned to his car andimmediately got on his cell phone, and then left. One of the questions we asked him has left us with a nagginginconsistency: we asked him if he had been on the helicopter when it hadoverflown us about 45 minutes before he appeared. He said he had beenon board the helicopter, and that besides himself there were two othermembers of this special crop circle investigative unit, a pilot, and a co-piloton board. He had also told us that they were operating out of a hanger inMilwaukee. Milwaukee is at least an hour and a half drive from where thecrop circles were located. From the time we lost sight of the helicopter tothe time he appeared, he couldn't have flown all the way to Milwaukee,got in a car and driven all the way back to the site. Either he wasn't onboard the helicopter, or the helicopter landed elsewhere closer by for himto drive back to the formation in the allotted time. We don't know at thispoint."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Of course, we are working to confirm all the details of this soldier'sfreely-given information. Over the next few days we will be in the processof filing Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests for additionalinformation about this possible USAF special investigative crop circle unit,and any crop circle information they may have uncovered. Anyinformation we obtain we will share with the crop circle community.\" Above: Many of the plants inside the Mayville, Ohio circles had 'blown node collars,'or expulsion cavities. Below: Other anomalies were twisted somatic stem tissue thathad to havebeen affected by some kind of energy two or three weeks before Art Rantalaallegedly saw the circles godown in the wheat on July 4, 2003. Jeff Wilson: \"The joint or node collars were flashheated by so muchenergy, that their internal moisture turned to steam causing them to explode andrupture like popcorn.We also located plants with blown node collars inside 'randomly-downed' patches offlattenedwheat that were also found in the field as far away as 500 feet from the circleformation.\"We b s it e :http://www.cropcirclenews.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
