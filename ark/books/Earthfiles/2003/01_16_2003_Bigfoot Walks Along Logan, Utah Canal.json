January 15, 2003 North Logan, Utah - The mother and son in a NorthLogan, Utah family who have seen tall, hairy Bigfoot creatures walk along thecanal behind their house have asked not to be identified for fear of publicridicule. The mother first saw a Bigfoot when she was 15-years-old in 1968 inalmost the same place that her 16-year-old son saw another large, hairy creatureon January 2, 2003. It was 11:30 p.m. MST and \"Billy,\" as I'll call him, wastalking with his cousin on his grandma's back porch two houses over from hisparents' house.Interviews:\"Billy,\" 16-year-old teenager, North Logan, Utah: \"My cousin said, 'What isthat across the canal?'I looked, but I didn't see anything. Then it walked out of the trees. It wassomething big, maybe 7 feet tall. The thing came walking out with pretty bigarms and it was making this big growling noise. That's what I heard the most.CAN YOU MIMIC THE GROWL THAT YOU HEARD?Billy makes a big breathing/grunting sound twice.WAS IT HEAVY BREATHING OR TRULY LIKE A GROWL?I think it was heavy breathing, something like that. And we just got reallyfreaked out about the breathing, so me and my cousin ran straight for the door. Ilooked back once and it didn't look at us or anything. It just looked like it wasgoing where it needed to go and just kept walking.EVEN THOUGH IT WAS DARK, WAS THERE ENOUGH MOONLIGHT TOSEE IF IT HAD HAIR?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Yeah, it looked like something was coming off of it, like off its head. I saw thatquite good.SO, IT WAS THE SOUND, THE SIZE THAT YOU COULD SEE, AND WASTHERE ANYTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE FACE? SOME PEOPLE HAVESAID THAT IN THE DARKNESS THEY HAVE SEEN EYES ON SOME OFTHESE TALL SASQUATCH OR BIGFOOT CREATURES GLOW?I didn't see anything like that. It wasn't facing me. It was just looking down thecanal. It didn't even turn its head, I don't think.DID YOU GO BACK IN THE DAYLIGHT TO SEE IF YOU COULD FINDANY TRACKS?Yes. We couldn't find any on the canal trail, but we found some down in mygranddad's orchard.HOW BIG?Pretty big size. About 18 inches, I think.DID YOU TAKE PHOTOGRAPHS?Ye s .Approximate 18-inch-long footprint that Billy found in his granddad'sorchard on January 3, 2003 off the canal where he and his cousin saw the large,hairy creature the night before. The blue material is actually white frost. Colordistortion by digital camera Digital image © 2003 by Billy's sister. WHAT ARE YOU LEFT THINKING HAVING SEEN THIS HUGE, STRANGE,HAIRY CREATURE RIGHT BEHIND YOUR HOUSE?Pretty frightened. It scared me a lot! I didn't know what to do.WHEN YOU RAN BACK TO THE HOUSE, DID YOU GET A FLASHLIGHT?We ran into my grandma's house and I went downstairs to grab the flashlight,but I didn't dare to go back outside after that.\"Billy's Mother\"It was frightening to me, too. I was about the same age as my son, about"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"15-years-old in 1968. I was actually in the same location that Billy was. In factthe place where we live right now is only two houses away from my parents'house which is where my son saw the same thing on January 2.I was sleeping out in my parents' backyard. It faces a canal and Utah StateUniversity research farm. (different kinds of plants for research since at least theearly 1960s.) I was sleeping out with a sister and a friend. It was pretty late atnight. I would imagine it was midnight or 1 a.m.Over on the other side of the canal, I saw basically the same thing he (Billy)saw.WAS THERE A MOON OUT?There was a moon out. It was just a very large thing walking on two legs, but itwas not human.IN THE MOONLIGHT, COULD YOU SEE HAIR?Yes, I could see it had some type of hair, but I was seeing this from the side,whatever it is. It is walking north and I am facing west, looking at it in a sideview. I did not see any facial features whatsoever. But I saw the form. I saw thearms were extremely long and really moving and this thing was taking large stepsbecause it walked by and was gone in a matter of seconds. It was very large.HOW CLOSE TO YOU DO YOU THINK IT WAS WHEN IT WALKED BY?It was about 35 to 40 feet away. I could hear it breathing. It never looked backat me. Of course, it probably didn't know we were there. We were laying flat onthe ground in our sleeping bags. Then the part about it that is extremely funny isthat I never told anyone about it. It was totally mind-boggling to me!ANY CAVES?Yes, there is Logan Canyon and Green Canyon which is closest to where we liveand there are some large caves up Green Canyon and also up Logan Canyon.\"More Information:My sincere thanks to Ryan Layton in Utah who called me about this JanuaryBigfoot sighting and who has devoted so many hours and resources toinvestigating Bigfoot and other unusual phenomena in his home state and thewestern region.For Other Related Earthfiles.com Reports, Please See Archives by Dates:· 11/03/2002 -- Chapter 13 - Mystery Stalks The Prairie· 11/03/2002 -- Chapter 12 - Mystery Stalks The Prairie· 10/28/2002 -- Chapter 11 - Mystery Stalks The Prairie· 09/29/2001 -- Part 1 - Sasquatch Bigfoot, Physical Evidence in North America· 09/29/2001 -- Part 2 - Sasquatch Bigfoot, Visible and Invisible Evidence in NorthAmerica· 07/12/2001 -- Laos - Part 4, The Rugged Road to Vilabouli· 07/10/2001 -- Laos - Part 3, A Brief History of the Wildmen of Laos· 07/08/2001 -- Laos - Part 2, Vientiane, The Capitol· 07/07/2001 -- Laos - Part I, Unexploded Ordnance on the Trail of \"Wild Men\"· 10/08/2000 -- Unidentified Primate (Bigfoot?)
