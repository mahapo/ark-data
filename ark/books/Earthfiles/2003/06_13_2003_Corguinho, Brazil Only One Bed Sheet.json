Videotape by Fabricio Da Silva. June 13, 2003 Corguinho, Brazil - On September 15, 2002, at around 7:30p.m., Brazil businessman Felipe Branco was driving his truck into the UrandirOliveira farm when he was stopped by rocks falling on his truck. Felipe couldsee small, round stones bouncing off the hood into the beams from his headlights. Felipe had driven from his Campo Grande fazenda (cattle farm) becausehis friend, Urandir Oliveira, had told him he expected to be taken by blond-haired extraterrestrials into a spacecraft before 9 p.m. on September 15th. Asignal of that event, Urandir had said, would be a \"rain of rocks\" on the farm.At the same time that Felipe Branco stopped his truck, stunned by the soundand sight of the stones falling on his truck, another friend of the Oliveira familywas reading in his rented bed and breakfast room about a quarter of a mile fromthe Oliveira home. \"It sounded like hail on the tin roof,\" Fabricio Da Silva toldme in Corguinho in February. Fabricio grabbed his digital video camera and ranoutside with the camera running. Urandir Oliveira's teenage son, cousins andhalf a dozen other visitors were outside, too, some pointing at the sky while afew rocks continued to fall with a knocking sound on the metal roofs. Fabriciokept running his camera as people picked up small, round stones from theground. Eventually, Felipe Branco joined them and everyone headed for theOliveira home. There, they found in the bedroom the pattern of a body with itsright arm outstretched, seemingly melted into the bed sheet and pillowcase onthe bed and another similar body pattern darkly scorched into the wood ceiling.Felipe Branco videotaping the body pattern on the bed sheet at 8:04:08 p.m.on September 15, 2002, inside the Urandir and Jessica Oliveira bedroom.

J. Gevaerd in Braziland Charlette LeFevre in Seattle with a laundry list of allegations. I calledBrazilian businessman, Felipe Branco, this week for his comments on theallegations, and specifically in this report the false accusation that there wasmore than one bed sheet containing a body pattern.Interview:Felipe Branco, Owner, Fazenda Castelo, Campo Grande, Mato Grosso doSul, Brazil: \"ONE OF THE ALLEGATIONS IS THAT URANDIR OLIVEIRAHAD TWO OR THREE BED SHEETS AND GEVAERD IS SHOWING THEPHOTOGRAPHS ON A WEBSITE SAYING, 'LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCEIN COLOR.' CHARLETTE LE FEVRE AND GEVAERD ARE ALSO SAYINGTHAT URANDIR OLIVEIRA BEAT UP HIS FIRST WIFE. THEY ARESAYING THAT HE IS A CROOK, THAT HE IS GUILTY OF LAND FRAUD,THAT HE WAS PUT IN JAIL, THERE IS THE PHOTOGRAPH OF URANDIRBEHIND BARS, THAT IT'S BEEN A CULT, LIKE A JIM JONES CULT....(Felipe begins laughing.) \"This is ridiculous, this! This is ridiculous. My God!Beating up the ex-wife. I know her personally. I've known her for the past sevenyears. They are divorced, but they are still very good friends, she is a friend ofUrandir's. She is (also my) very close friend. I have been to her house severaltimes, even after the separation. She is a lovely person. When I spoke to herabout this, she was so upset! She said, 'My God, this A. J. Gevaerd, he neverstops persecuting Urandir. It's incredible! I want to testify. I want to clear this upbecause this is a lie, a total lie, you know!' She was amazed.SO URANDIR OLIVEIRA, FROM HIS EX-WIFE TALKING TO YOU, NEVERBEAT HER UP?Never! This is a lie.ALL RIGHT. TAKING SOME OF THE OTHER ACCUSATIONS, THAT HEMADE TWO OR THREE BED SHEETS.It's a lie also because first of all, Gevaerd, he has never been there to his room"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"(Urandir's bedroom.) He has never seen it personally. He has never taken asample, nothing! The only researcher who has gone inside to look was you.Nobody else.WHERE DID HE (Gevaerd) GET THE PHOTOS OF URANDIR SITTING ONTHE BED MAKING IT LOOK LIKE IT'S A DIFFERENT COLORED BEDSHEET IN ONE PHOTO VERSUS THE WOVEN BED SHEET?This is easily done using PhotoShop or any digital manipulation, easily done.These photos went around the world because many people took photos there,may 8, 7, 10 people who took photos there.DO YOU REMEMBER TAKING PICTURES OF URANDIR SITTING ONTHE BED ON SEPTEMBER 18, 2002 AFTER HE GOT BACK?
