May 27, 2003 Salt Lake City, Utah - Since May 14, 2002, the Salt LakeCounty Animal Services in Utah has received nine reports of mutilated cats andone report of a mutilated dog. The May 14th case was a domestic male cat withblack short hair. The officer who picked it up thought it might have beenattacked by another animal, but the resident who found it thought its throat hadbeen slit.Then on July 2, 2002, another domestic cat with short black and white hair wasreported, sex unknown. Ray Kelleher, Staff Sergeant and Senior Officer, whohas worked 25 years for the Salt Lake County Animal Services, talked to meabout that case and the eight others since that have all been found in a six blockradius \"in the Avenues\" of northeastern Salt Lake City.Ray Kelleher, Staff Sergeant and Senior Officer, Salt Lake County AnimalServices, Salt Lake City, Utah: \"That July 2, 2002, cat appeared to be gutted,decapitated and it looked to be cut open from the side and the head and internalorgans were missing. That's what we've been finding - either we find the backhalf or the front half and the organs are missing, cleaned out. No blood oranything around, so we are suspecting that the perpetrators are dropping the cats or catching them somehow and taking them somewhere and doing their thingwith them. Then taking the half they don't need or want back to the Avenueswhere and dropping it back off in the same location.Salt Lake City, Utah Animal Mutilation CasesReported Between July 2, 2002 and May 22, 2003:1) May 14, 2002, cat.2) July 2, 2002, cat.3) July 17, 2002, cat."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"4) July 18, 2002, cat.5) July 21, 2002, cat.6) July 25, 2002, cat.7) October 17, 2002, dog.8) Oct. 28, 2002, cat.9) November 7, 2002, cat.10) April 23, 2003, cat.TO DATE, HAS ANYONE SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING UNUSUAL?No. Out of the ten, we've only been able to identify three owners. They cameand positively identified what they could of theirs. We've talked with them andasked if they've had any problems with neighbors, if anyone has threatened tokill their cats or have they had any juvenile kids around, any suspicious vehiclesparked in front of their house or slowing down in front of their house oranything like that? Each one has said no. It's been really a quiet neighborhoodand they've never had any problems with juveniles and haven't even seenanything suspicious in their neighborhood.THOSE THREE OWNERS OF THOSE THREE CATS, WERE THOSE CATSKEPT IN THE HOUSE AND LET OUT? OR WERE THEY OUTDOOR CATS?They would let them out at night and that's when the attacks seemed to occur, inthe middle of the nights. We would end up getting a call in the morning about 6or 7 a.m., when people would find the cat. It wouldn't be at the same house, butwould be a couple of blocks from their house. It would be left on someone else'slawn. So, it's being done sometime after midnight or so when the perpetratorsassume everyone is asleep and no one is out looking.IN ALL TEN ANIMALS, IT'S BEEN A BLOODLESS SCENE?Yes. And they were all within probably a five to six block radius of each other(in the Avenues).DID YOU PUT CRUISERS OR PEOPLE OUT TO LOOK THERE?Yes, we do have mobile neighborhood watch that is patrolling now at night andif they see anything suspicious or strange people they don't recognize in thatneighborhood. The patrols will be calling the police on them. The police willcheck them out and see what they are doing up there.HAVE YOU HAD A REWARD?We do. It's $6,500 through the Human Society. Anyone with information cancontact me at my phone number: 801-269-7497, Ex. 470. Aurora, Colorado hasalso had similar half cats and other animals and have a $9,000 reward out. (SeeMore Information below.)IN THE TWENTY-FIVE YEARS THAT YOU HAVE WORKED FOR THESALT LAKE COUNTY ANIMAL SERVICES, HOW MANY TIMES BEFOREHAVE THESE KINDS OF CAT AND DOG MUTILATIONS OCCURRED?None. They just started happening last year. We've never had any cases like thishappening at all before.WHEN YOU'VE LOOKED AT THEM, WHAT WENT THROUGH YOURMIND?Sick, perverted people. It's either some young kids, maybe high school age,possibly doing this. They might be dabbling into the occult a little bit, maybeeven someone who doesn't care for cats and doing this. Because it's like they putit back out in the same area they catch the cats, like saying, 'Look at what I did.'"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS SAME EXACT PATTERN HASBEEN GOING ON WORLDWIDE FOR DECADES, REPORTED IN THE NEWYORK TIMES AND MANY NEWSPAPERS FROM LONDON, ENGLANDTHROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES?Well, that's interesting. We've been looking at e-mails to see if there is acorrelation with something on the internet that tells people, advises people, howto do these things.BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE AN INTERNET IN THE 1960S, 1970S OR THEEARLY 1980S.That's true. I don't know if it's some kind of big collaboration in the cults that isnationwide. That's a possibility. Because mostly the more pronounced cultsusually don't leave any type of body or carcass for anyone to see. They disposeof everything they don't use because they don't want to be known.WHAT ABOUT UFOS?I don't know. That could be a possibility. I believe in those, actually, and thatcould be a possibility.DEPUTY SHERIFFS AND SHERIFFS WHO HAVE WORKED ON THECATTLE MUTILATION CASES HAVE SEEN BEAMS OF LIGHT COMEDOWN IN PASTURES, THEY'VE SEEN STRANGE GLOWING DISCS INTHE SKY. IT CERTAINLY MAKES ME WONDER ABOUT THE LINK?That's true. I'm open for any leads, for any information on this. I'm not closingmy mind on any possibilities.\"More Information:Salt Lake City Animal MutilationsTo report information and inquire about Humane Society's $6,500 reward forarrest and conviction of any perpetrators, call:Ray Kelleher, Staff SergeantSalt Lake County Animal ServicesSalt Lake City, Utah801-269-7497, Ex. 470Aurora, Colorado Animal MutilationsNine cats, two squirrels and one rabbit have been found the past year withbloodless, precise cuts and usually only the front half or back half of the animal.Internal organs removed.To report information and inquire about $9,000 reward for arrest and convictionof any perpetrators, call:Barbara NovoritaChief Cruelty InvestigatorDenver Dumb Friends LeagueAurora Animal Care Division303-326-8288Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Republication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
