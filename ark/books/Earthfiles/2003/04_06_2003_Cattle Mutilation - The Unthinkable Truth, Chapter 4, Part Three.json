Smith, Freedland Publishers Chapter 4, Part Three -The UFO Mystery rom the very first sightings of unidentified aerial disks in the skies, UnitedStates, Russian and other air forces have persistently tried to force or shootdown UFOs in order, among other things, to learn the secrets of their propulsionsystems. Among the most determined to do this has been Soviet Russia. Afterthe constant failure of their fighters, Soviet anti-aircraft gunners have beenordered to bring down UFOs. \"On July 24, 1957, the USAF IntelligenceAcademy report stated, 'Russian anti-aircraft batteries on the Kouril Islandsopened fire on UFOs. Although all Soviet anti-aircraft batteries on the islandswere in action, no hits were made. The UFOs were luminous and moved veryfast. As in the U. S. and Russia, military pilots have persistently tried to forcedown UFOs in England, France, Brazil, Canada, the Union of South Africa,Norway, the Netherlands and several other countries.'\" (Aliens From Space ©1973 by Major Donald E. Keyhoe, USMC Ret.) Major Keyhoe goes on to say that many pilots and intelligence analysts believethat UFOs are immune to gunfire and rockets. But one special evaluation of U.S. and foreign reports by a top control group found evidence that some UFOsseem to have been crippled and possibly destroyed by missile or rocket fire.(Ibid, Keyhoe.) Ever since UFOs have made the news, a number of prominent scientists andmilitary men have strongly warned that any communication with extraterrestrialscould bring on disaster. Lt. Gen. James M. Gavin issued a public warning, \"Weare likely to encounter beings inimical to Earth's existence.\" There is also thewell known and remarkable statement by General Douglas MacArthur that theworld's peoples must unite, since the next great war will be an interplanetaryone. We cannot be sure what the highest levels of intelligence in various governmentshave managed to learn. But there are suggestions. There's a report, for example,of a South American who was taken by extraterrestrials to another planet andshown a huge fleet of UFOs being prepared for an invasion of Earth, after whichhe was returned home unharmed. (Ibid, Keyhoe.) There is another bit ofworldwide insanity this might explain. Why do the nations with nuclearcapability keep on producing nukes at top speed when there is already enoughof them, many tens of thousands, to kill everyone on earth dozens of times over?The answer might be that they aren't being produced to attack humans. During the mid-1960s, faced with the impossible task of refuting all public UFOsightings, the Air Force was looking for a graceful way to rid itself of thatonerous burden. What it needed was a prestigious scientific report that wouldonce and for all end public interest in the subject of UFOs. Finally in 1966, for"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"a cool half million, it contracted with Dr. Edward U. Condon and the Universityof Colorado for what was advertised to be a scientific study of UFOs. Dr. Condon, widely known for his liberal views had, like many prominentscientists of his generation, won his spurs by helping provide mankind withA-bombs. His credentials, except for an earlier run in with Richard Nixon, wereperfect for the job. At last the truth would all be published, it was said. Dr.Condon was a complete skeptic concerning UFOs and at no time before, during,or after the so-called study did he hesitate to make his views known. During theentire two year project, he did not make a single field investigation or interviewone pilot, astronomer, aerospace engineer, control tower operator or any othercompetent witness. (NICAP Report on the Condon Report) From the beginning, those hoping for an objective investigation began to smellsomething rotten. The only thing that seemed to interest Dr. Condon were thosereally spaced out contactees which he condescended to interview occasionallyand publicized with ribald jokes. This deeply disturbed the naive souls whoactually thought the government was shelling out half a million to make thepublic aware of the truth about UFOs. Some of the hired hands had come to work on the project, however, thinking itwas on the level. But the continued adamant refusal of its leaders to even lookat the most significant sightings deeply troubled them. A real crisis developed inthe middle of the Condon project when one of the investigators found a memowritten by Condon's first mate to University of Colorado officials. The memoread in part: \"In order to undertake such a project, one has to approach it objectively.That is, one has to admit the possibility that such things (UFOs) exist. It isnot respectable to give serious consideration to such a possibility.Believers, in other words, remain outcasts. ...Admitting such possibilities ...puts us beyond the pale and we would lose more in prestige in thescientific community than we could possibly gain by undertaking theinvestigation. Our study would be conducted almost exclusively bynon-believers, who, although they could not possibly prove a negativeresult, could and probably would add an impressive body of evidence thatthere is no reality to the observations. \"The trick would be, I think, to describe the project so that to the public, itwould appear a totally objective study, but to the scientific communitywould present the image of a group of non-believers trying their best to beobjective, but having almost zero expectation of finding a saucer. One wayto do this would be to stress investigation, not of the physical phenomena,but rather the people who do the observing - the psychology and sociologyof persons and groups who report seeing UFOs.\" When those on the project who had not been told it was a half million dollartrick saw this, they were so deeply disturbed they showed it to NICAP. WhenDr. Condon learned of that, he became absolutely furious. Not at the trick, butat their discovery of it.\"For an act like that, you should be professionally ruined!\" he thundered at thePh.D. who was guilty. The next day two researchers were fired and no doubtblackballed and NICAP, having a suspicion that one aim of the project was toget hold of and claim to have scientifically examined and rejected all of theirexcellent material, disavowed the project and stopped feeding them information.(Aliens From Space © 1973 by Major Donald E. Keyhoe, USMC Ret.) Since several congressmen had become interested in UFOs, the stink aroused acongressional investigation. Actually, it only turned out to be a one daysymposium where a half dozen scientists presented papers, some quiteinteresting. But there was to be absolutely no comment on the Air Force'shandling of the UFO problem, or on the Condon CU study. Whenever acongressman ventured close to those verboten areas, he was immediately called"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"to order and told to shush up. (Congressional Record, July 29, 1968.) Something else interesting happened about that time. On November 11, 1966,the Soviets announced a large scale UFO investigation. It was to be headed byone of their big wig generals, eighteen scientists and a lot of Air Force officers,supported by a network of 200 observers. That was a startling bit of informationthat must have given some top American policy makers the queazies. Moscowhad always been extremely scornful of UFO sightings. Of course, nothing cameof the project. On second thought, it was killed and buried. In the 1966 Condon Report, toward the back some interesting and unexplainedsightings are described, slipped in by disgusted staff members. Some people havewondered about the remarkable opposition between the actual cases the textdescribes and the conclusions purportedly drawn from them. The explanationmust be that Dr. Condon had no idea what the back pages of the report said.After offering up his allegedly good name and pocketing a lion's share of theloot, he probably wanted to just forget the whole thing. There's a way to manage news so that insignificant things get headlines andsignificant things get lost. The report was held up until newsmen werethoroughly buried under inauguration hoopla. Then it was released one daybefore the news conference was to be held about the Condon Project. Since noone could be expected to dig the hidden gems out of that huge 1500-page tomeovernight, the press was told the essence of it was in the first part - Dr. Condon'sfalse snow job, that also included the really dumb recommendation from theNational Academy of Sciences. Apparently people in the NAS cannot read theback pages either. Some newsmen outside the New York-Washington circuit did not swallowCondon's line, but all the big time national media did. So that's what standstoday as the all time official scientific refutation of the existence of UFOs. NOWWILL THEY PLEASE ALL GO AWAY!!
