Max Halverson, Des Moines, Iowa Police DepartmentThe warm body of a male horse was found dead in a Des Moines, Iowa, pastureon January 4, 2003, with the right side of its head stripped of flesh to dry bone, withoutblood.January 21, 2003 Des Moines, Iowa - On the morning of January 4, 2003,owners of a horse stable in Des Moines, Iowa were putting out feed when theynoticed that one of the male horses owned by Roy and Margie Whitten wasmissing. All the horses were fine the day before. But during the search, thehorse's body, still warm to touch, was found dead and mutilated in a pastureabout a half mile from the stable. Like so many of the hundreds of horses andthousands of cattle also found dead and mutilated around the world since the1960s, the right side of the horse's head was stripped of flesh to dry bone,without blood.The Des Moines Police Department is withholding photographs of the January 4, 2003,horse mutilation, but this photograph shows another similar mutilation of a fourteen-year-oldgelding found June 22, 1993, in Raymer, Colorado, by owner and horse raiser DorisWilliams.Photograph by Mike Peters, The Greeley Tribune."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The lead investigator on the case is Sgt. Max Halverson in the Animal ControlUnit of the Des Moines, Iowa Police Department. Sgt. Halverson told me thisweek he worked in the Robbery/Homicide division for seven years and in Trafficinvestigating fatalities for five years. He's never seen anything like the bloodlessremoval of half a horse's face before now.Interview:Sgt. Max Halverson, Des Moines, Iowa Police Department, Animal ControlUnit: \"I contacted our intelligence section and had them ask not only the FBI,but the DCI for any similar cases in this area and they turned up nothing. Thiswas so unusual that we threw all of our work force at it, trying to resolve it rightoff. And we're still in that process.WAS THE EXCISION VERY CLEAN LEAVING NO FLESH OF ANY KINDON THE BONE?Yes, it was. The entire side of the face was removed completely behind the lineof the skull, the jaw bone and up the center line of the nose. This was a knife cutexcision, but it was not a clean excision, not just one line. It was like they werepeeling flesh back and hacking at the same time. Like someone with a pair ofscissors cutting through paper, there are several stops and starts in it. So, wethink that's clear indication that a knife was used in this case and that the side ofthe face was cleaned back down to the bone, the whole side of the face.WHICH IS DIFFICULT, EVEN FOR BIRDS TO DO?Yes, it is. I'm keeping an open mind. I don't think birds were involved in itbecause we had no bird droppings around it which would have been a normaloccurrence if they were there feeding on the flesh.GE N ITAL S W E R E INTA C T ?Yes. There are no marks on the animal anywhere to indicate anything, and that'swhat is real mystifying. We are either looking at someone injected somethinginto this horse to bring it down, or it died of natural causes, some sort of disease.AND THEN SOMETHING CAME...As bizarre as it is, something came along and removed half the face from thehorse.DID THE PERSON DOING THE NECROPSY EXAMINE TO SEE IF THETONGUE, TRACHEA OR ESOPHAGUS WERE REMOVED?We did a complete necropsy right out there in the field. We split this animalstem to stern. Everything else was in place. The trachea had some indicationsthat the horse had suffocated some during its death throws, but nothing was cutor removed as far as tongue, trachea or any other organs or any other marks onthe horse whatsoever.If you are knowledgeable, what we are looking at right now is a tetanus typedisease that is in the soil and can pass through a wound into the animal and theydie of poisoning from the bacteria.FROM THE VETERINARIAN PATHOLOGIST'S POINT OF VIEW, THEANIMAL MIGHT HAVE DIED FROM TETANUS AND THEN THISEXCISION FROM THE FACE WAS DONE?Yes. And the lack of blood, just a small amount of blood, indicates that theanimal was already dead when this occurred. The time element here is thatmaybe we have a 24-hour period we're looking at. It was about 20 degrees F.during the evening and the carcass was still warm enough that it was probablywithin 12 hours that the death had occurred. (Linda Howe's emphasis.)"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO REMOVE ALL TISSUE FROM BONEWITHOUT BOILING IT.I'm aware of (the difficulty to remove). In fact, the jaw part of the horse wasalmost dry in appearance. All this is very curious to me and I'm trying to keep anopen mind, but to believe other than human intervention at this time, I would bevery skeptical of that. Not that I don't believe if we are leading down the path ofUFOs or something like that not that I don't believe in that, but I would find itquite difficult.THIS WAS THE ONLY HORSE AFFECTED AT THE STABLES?Ye s .DID YOU OR THE OWNERS OF THE STABLE NOTICE ANY UNUSUALBEHAVIOR ON THE PART OF THE OTHER HORSES?Nobody said anything about it and we've interviewed quite a few people thatwere down there. Detectives are involved in this and they went out andinterviewed everybody at that time. Nobody said anything about unusualoccurrences. The only thing they mentioned was that when they went to feedthe horses that morning, he did not come up to be fed like the rest of them.AT THE SCENE, WAS THERE ENOUGH GRASS IN THE PASTUREUNDERNEATH THE HORSE TO NOTICE IF THERE WAS ANYDEPRESSION OR ANYTHING CHANGED ABOUT THE GRASS LAIDDOWN ON THE SOIL?Like I said, the horses go through this area. So, the grass - which is probablyabout knee-high in certain areas - was trampled. There was a lot of fecal materialaround the area where the horses go back there quite often. We didn't find anyblood we searched the area for blood, footprints, tire tracks, anything, andcouldn't find anything unusual around there. The horse had laid on its side forawhile and through flailing with its feet and all had cleared some grass, whichwould be normal death throws for this type of disease. That was the onlyindication that the horse had been down for some period. It didn't just dropdead. It was on its side suffering for some time.IN THE NECROPSY, ALL THE INTERNAL ORGANS WERE THERE?Yes. We took liver samples, spleen samples, urine samples. We took theesophagus, lungs, heart. We decapitated the animal and even took the head andsent it in up to Iowa State University for testing. But the horse, like I said, therewere no injuries anywhere no cuts, no lacerations, no missing parts other thanthe side of the face which was the side that was up where the animal was laying.DID YOU DO AN EXAMINATION OF THE EXCISION TO LOOK FOR THEPRESENCE OF HEAT?We sent the whole head up to Iowa State University and there is no indicationthat heat was used on the incision. I even got down and looked at the incision.We even have hairs that were cut by what we assume to be the knife. And hairs,if there is heat, will melt and have a little bump on the side. There is noindication of that. On the jaw line of the horse, there is quite a bit of hair therewhere it was cut by a knife and it was cleanly cut. There was no melting thehairs.IN YOUR DES MOINES OFFENSE REPORT FILES, DO YOU HAVE ANYOTHER SIMILAR MUTILATION CASES OF CATTLE OR HORSES ORCATS?I contacted our intelligence section and had them ask not only the FBI, but theDCI for any similar cases in this area and they turned up nothing.This was so unusual that we threw all of our work force at it, trying to resolve itright off. And we're still in that process.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"More Information:If anyone has any information, please call:Sgt.
