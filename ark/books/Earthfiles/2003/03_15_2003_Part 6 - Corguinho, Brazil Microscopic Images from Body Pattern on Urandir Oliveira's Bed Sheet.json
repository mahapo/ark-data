Photograph © 2003 by LindaMoulton Howe. March 15, 2003 Grass Lake, Michigan - Biophysicist W. C. Levengood hasbeen examining both normal control and body pattern samples I collected fromthe cotton and polyester woven bed sheet in Urandir Oliveira's home inFebruary. The body pattern was discovered by several people at Oliveira's farmaround 8 p.m. on September 15, 2002. (See previous Earthfiles reports aboutCorguinho, Brazil.)This week I received photomicrographs from Levengood taken at 40Xmagnification under his microscope and today we discussed the images shownbelow with his comments.Interview:W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, GrassLake, Michigan:Photomicrographs were all taken at 40X magnification:Photomicrograph 1\"This shows a control sample from one of the bed sheet corners where noalterations were observed. This is a simple checkerboard weave of whitepolyester fibers interwoven with cotton, blue cotton fiber,which gives the very light blue color to the sheet."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"So, the cotton has been dyed blue and the poyester does not have any dye init.That's right.Photomicrograph 2\"This is a photomicrograph of a sample of the body pattern on the UrandirOliveira bed that was not scorched, but almost looks wet when you arelooking at the bed sheet. But in fact that wet look has been caused by achange in the polyester?It sure has. These I call a transition, or the polyester is converted into what I callvitreous fibers. It looks wet, but this is actually sort of an opalescent liquid-looking, but it's like a plastic. It's very hard.Could Oliveira have used a candle, a match, a laser, a blow torch,something like that to heat this pattern on that sheet?No, absolutely not. The astounding thing about this Photomicrograph 2 is thatthe polyester fibers are completely transformed from looking like a bundle offibers, which they were. Each thread we are talking about here is roughly a littleover .4 millimeters in diameter. The fibers themselves are down in the micronregion, 1/1000th of that size - only three to four microns. Each thread iscomposed of probably several hundred fibers. The same is true with the cottonand they are roughly the same diameter fibers. The cotton, of course, has adistinctly different look.We know that polyester is listed in The Condensed Chemical Dictionary ashaving a melting temperature of 500 degrees F. and that cotton has a scorchtemperature of 300 degrees F. That is a difference of 200 degrees F. In thisphotograph, it looks as if the polyester threads have melted and the bluecotton threads seem completely untouched.That's right. There is that difference of 200 degrees F., but the cotton threads aretotally undisturbed. Photomicrograph 3"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The red arrow points to polyester fibers inside a vitreous thread. You can seesome faint horizontal lines inside the vitreous polyester, which means that notall the polyester fibers were transformed into the vitreous state. So, it's atransition region. This suggests that a change has occurred in the molecularstructure of the 3 to 4 micron diameter polyester fibers, but did not affect all ofthe fibers at once and not in the same way. The fibers are transformed from onestate to another.But you don't know how this occurred?Of course not, no. You can't transform the molecules in a polyester fiber byheating it with a match, is what I'm saying. (Whatever the energy is), it has tofingerprint the actual molecular structure of the material itself. If it were a matchor laser, the heat would spill over where you have these cotton fibers right inproximity. The cotton threads are lying right on the vitreous polyester fibers,over and under. But there is no apparent heat transfer here between thepolyester fibers and the cotton fibers. The fibers are transformed from one stateto another. Photomicrograph 4This was taken within a brown region where the blue dye in the cotton fiberswas altered to a brown color. Note how the vitreous polyester threads arebroken up, perhaps due to surface tension.Again, this is not typical of charring. If you heat this with a laser or anythingelse, you would get carbonization. But there is no carbonization here. There isno oxidation. It's just a browning, and I think what that is is a break down of thedye inside the blue fibers. That's what gives it the brown color. With thecontinued application of this energy, of course, the polyester fibers begin to ballup and flow around a little because of surface tension affects, or wetting affects.Photomicrograph 5This was taken within a brown region where the blue dye in the cotton fiberswas altered to a brown color.

Note that in the region between theblue at the top and the brown at the bottom, the (blue dyed) cotton threadsbecome very pale in color. In a space of 2 millimeters, this energy is changingfrom the discreet heating of the polyester and leaving the blue fibers as they areto a complete transformation in both the cotton and the polyester.So what we have in Photomicrograph 5 is a really good example of a veryrefined control on what is happening just 2 millimeters apart. The cottonremains blue in the upper part of the photoraph and yet it is scorching orturning brown only 2 millimeters away at the bottom of the photograph.That's right. That emphasizes this is not the usual kind of heating. Let's go to theanalogy of the burner on your stove. You turn the burner on high and you knowthat if you come within a foot or six or eight inches of the burner with the backof your hand, you can feel the heat.Whatever this energy this is, it can keep something cool only 2 millimetersfrom something else that is heated up?That's right. (Imagine that your) hand moved only 2 millimeters and you wouldfeel the heat and it would be hotter than hell, and you move it 2 millimetersaway and it would be cold. The energy that did this is precisely controlled downto micron levels.Photomicrograph 6This shows the normal weave of polyester threads in the mattress cover, which isall polyester. The beige color appears to be uniform throughout.Photomicrograph 7"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"This shows a missing vertical thread and three vitreous spots where horizontalfibers cross the missing thread space in the mattress cover. None of the otherpolyester fibers appear to be affected. This again demonstrates the very preciseapplication of the energy that produced these anomalous effects.Yes, and it means that whatever interacted with this bed sheet, it selectedone of the vertical threads in some strange way that caused this melting ofthe vertical thread and some of it is what we see deposited on thehorizontal threads.That's right.Why did this one thin, vertical thread suddenly change its composition insome way without affecting any of the threads around it?That's right. Here the (interacting) energy can pick one fiber and totally convertit. I think this is both a chemical and structural conversion of the molecules. Tochange to and deposit vitreous material on the horizontal fibers and not affectanything underneath. It's astounding.\" Photomicrograph 8\"The arrow shows a region where cotton fibers are embedded, apparentlyunchanged, within the hard vitreous polyester threads.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
