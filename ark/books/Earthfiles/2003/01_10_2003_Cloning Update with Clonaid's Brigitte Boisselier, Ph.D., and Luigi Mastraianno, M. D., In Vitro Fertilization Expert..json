D., In Vitro FertilizationExpert.© 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe Time magazine, February 19, 2001, and book Cloning: For and Against, Volume 3© 1998, Edited by M. L. Rantala and Arthur J.Milgram, Ph.D. January 10, 2003 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - Last Friday, January 3rd,while I was reporting on Coast to Coast AM radio and Earthfiles.com (seeprevious report) about the cloning or hoaxed cloning? - controversy that nowsurrounds Clonaid and the Raelian movement, another baby clone wassupposed to have been born that very night to a Dutch mother and her femalepartner. Again, the location is not disclosed and no proof has been provided, butClonaid's Chief Executive Officer and analytical chemist, Brigitte Boisselier,told me this week by phone that she will show the world irrefutable DNA proof\"soon.\"As I reported last week, she and her spiritual leader, Rael, decided not to allowthe DNA testing of the first alleged baby clone born on December 26 becauseFlorida attorney, Bernard Siegel, filed a lawsuit in Broward County to declareany cloned baby to be an abused child which should have a court-appointedguardian. An arraignment on that case will be heard on January 22, with orwithout the presence of Dr. Boisselier, Rael, the parents and the alleged babyclone girl.That legal development brought to a screeching halt whatever steps were beingtaken by the independent science group that was supposed to sample DNA fromthe first baby clone and her mother. Then the journalist who was organizing theindependent science team - former ABC television producer, Michael Guillen -went on television talk shows to defend his eroding credibility and say it couldall be a big, bad hoax.Whatever the truth finally is, Clonaid is not the only group claiming to bemaking baby clones. Reproductive fertility specialist, Dr. Severino Antinori inItaly, says he also has cloned babies about to be born. So, Dr. Boisselier and Dr.Antinori are competitors, each trying to go down in history with the first provencloned human. That means in this New Year of 2003, to clone - or not to clone humans is an issue that's here to stay.This week I asked Dr. Boisselier about her competition with Dr. Antinori, thelawsuit in Florida, criticisms from the mainstream medical community thatcloning human babies is \"outrageous,\" \"premature\" and \"reckless,\" and whatother birth announcements Clonaid expects to make in the near future."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Brigitte Boisselier, Ph.D., Chemist, and Chief Executive Officer,Clonaid, sitting next to Rael, leader of the worldwide Raelian Movement.Photograph © 2003 by Associated Press.Interview:Brigitte Boisselier, Ph.D., Analytical Chemist and Chief Executive Officer,Clonaid, main headquarters address not disclosed, but there is an office inMontreal, Quebec, Canada:\"WHAT ARE YOU EXPECTING TO HAPPEN NOW BEYONDMID-JANUARY?Well, there are three more babies due by February 5. That's the latest we expect.The next one should be born around January 20, if everything goes well. But itcould happen any time.ARE THESE ALL OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES?There are three coming to us from outside the United States.ANY IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES?Well, two are from Asia and one is from North America.WHAT HAPPENS NOW WITH THE FAMILY OF BABY EVE, AS SHE ISCALLED, WITH THE JANUARY 22ND ARRAIGNMENT SCHEDULED INBROWARD COUNTY, FLORIDA, AND THE ATTORNEY BERNIE SIEGELWANTING THE COURT TO DESIGNATE ANY CHILD FOUND TO BECLONED AS AN ABUSED CHILD AND NEEDS A GUARDIAN OF THESTATE FOR PROTECTION. WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS AMERICANFAM ILY NOW?The parents were shocked when they heard that. We discussed this at length.They discussed it with their attorney, with mine, and they have several options.One is that they don't declare the baby as a U. S. citizen. That is still apossibility. This is terrible for them. They are U. S. citizens and they are feelingso bad to imagine that their loved baby couldn't be a U. S. citizen. They are stillworking on that, what is the best solution. We will find a way, I think.ARE YOU AND THE PARENTS GOING TO SHOW UP AT THATARRAIGNMENT ON JANUARY 22?Again, I don't know exactly what will be the decision. We will probably makethat decision a few days before. I will certainly be represented.IF THE PARENTS DO NOT SHOW UP, DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHATTHE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES COULD BE DEPENDING UPON THEJUDGE'S RULING?I think my attorney knows everything. There are so many things we have to dealwith. We are dealing with that. The parents will make a decision, but they aregoing as far as saying, 'Maybe we should live in another country.' I would likeyou to realize how far this is going. They want to keep their baby, but theymight have to live in another country.DO YOU THINK THIS ATTORNEY WOULD HAVE ACTED IF YOU HADPRESENTED AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE THE HARD DNA PROOFWITH A RESPECTED MEDICAL TEAM THAT WAS SUPPORTING WHAT"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"HAD OCCURRED AND THAT THE ANNOUNCEMENT HAD HAPPENEDIN A MORE CREDIBLE AND MEDICALLY AND SCIENTIFICALLYACCEPTABLE WAY?I don't think that this man is doing that because he wants the proof. He is sayingthat this child is abused and that's the reason why he is doing it. I don't think heneeds any proof. He wants probably some fame and show how good he is and heforgets there are human beings behind.ONE OF HIS MAJOR CONTENTIONS IS THAT CURRENTLY THE TRACKRECORD OF CLONING IN ANIMALS HAS PRODUCED SO MANYPROBLEMS. THEREFORE, HE SAYS ANY POTENTIAL HUMAN BABYCLONE IS FACED WITH MANY BIOLOGICAL AND MEDICALPROBLEMS.It's funny that a lawyer could say something about science. I have been sayingall along that they should look at the results on the animal cloning in a differentway. There is a different way to look at these things. Animal cloning that havebeen born with defects show exactly the same defect that the animals bornthrough in vitro fertilization do. This means that these defects are not related tocloning, but to assisted reproduction in those species. I have been saying that fortwo years now and talked with animal experts and still the media likes to saythere will be defects and there is a low success rate. Of course, they have lowsuccess rate. They implant everything and they don't care. This is not how weproceed with assisted reproduction of humans. And we have had in vitrofertilization clinics running for 24 years. We know how to prepare humanembryos. We know how to check them. We know so much on how to preparethe women before. That's the main difference.When people are saying we should improve the cloning of animals before doinganything with humans, this is wrong, because we know so much more aboutassisted reproduction in humans. The moment you see this baby and everythingwill be shown on TV, people will realize that there has been misinformation forthe last two years. Completely irrational information!SO, WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT THE CLONING PROCEDURE,FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW, IS AS EASY OR COMPLEX AS IN VITROFERTILIZATION WITH THE SAME PROBLEMS?Absolutely. Once you know how to handle the egg which is tricky, but there arehundreds of technicians who can do that. Once you know that, once you knowwhat is the right media that you need for the activation of the embryo, then it fitsin what has been defined in IVS and will benefit from this huge experience IVShas developed.\"Cloning embryos. Photograph courtesy Clonaid.Brigitte Boisselier's reference to in vitro fertilization (IVF) is the medicalprocedure in which fresh semen is obtained from the husband or male donor andcombined with a female egg in a lab dish where fertilization occurs. Theresulting embryo is then transferred to the mother's uterus to grow into a baby.In vitro fertilization was used successfully for the first time in the United Statesin 1981. Since then, more than 45,000 in vitro babies have been born inAmerica, averaging about $8,000 per fertilized egg implantation into the uterus.Often, several cycles of implantations are necessary to produce a healthy"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"pregnancy.The success rate of in vitro fertilization is similar to the 20% chance of a normal,healthy baby from natural reproduction. Children resulting from in vitrofertilization have the same incidence of birth defects as children conceivednaturally.One of the world research pioneers behind in vitro fertilization is Dr. LuigiMastroianni, Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University ofPennsylvania Medical Center and member of the Ethics Committee for theAmerican Society of Reproductive Medicine. This week I asked him aboutBrigitte Boisselier's argument that the cloning procedure is not much differentthan in vitro fertilization.Luigi Mastroianni, M. D., Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at theUniversity of Pennsylvania Medical Center and member of the EthicsCommittee for the American Society of Reproductive Medicine: \"No, it'sentirely different. It's an operative procedure on the egg itself and the nucleus ofthe egg is removed and it is replaced by the nucleus from the skin cell or anothersomatic cell, and that is quite different from introducing a sperm into the egg inorder to produce a fertilized egg. You see, this is not in vitro fertilization at all. Itdoesn't involve any fertilization. Therefore, it is an entirely new approach to theprocess of assisted reproductive technology. Therefore, we have to be carefulthat what we are doing is not going to produce an abnormal offspring. How areyou going to face that child who is delivered grossly abnormal simply becauseyou were cavalier in your efforts to obtain fame and fortune using a techniquewhich hasn't been clearly established as safe in the laboratory?YOU ARE MAKING A VERY IMPORTANT POINT BECAUSE WHEN YOUCLONE, YOU ARE TAKING ALREADY EXISTING CELLS IN WHICH THECHROMOSOMES ARE AGED, VERSUS SPERM THAT UNITE WITH ANEGG IN NATURAL REPRODUCTION THAT IS A FRESH FORCE OF LIFE.It is. And as far as the sperm goes, it is clearly a fresh force of life becausespermatogenesis is a continuing process in the male. Those are fresh sperm.Those sperm haven't been hanging around forever. The ones that are sittingaround in the male reproductive tract and don't get out in time are dead ordying. These are nice fresh sperm. So what we have then is Nature's way ofprotecting us from some of these abnormalities of aging. We are learning a greatdeal about the cellular biology of aging these days. It's quite clear there aremajor chromosomal changes that occur as a result of aging that can result inabnormalities.\" Brigitte Boisselier, Ph.D.: \"DID YOU HAVE THAT PRESS CONFERENCEWITHOUT EVIDENCE BECAUSE YOU FELT PRESSURE TO BEAT, SO TOSPEAK, IN A RACE WITH DR. ANTONARI IN ITALY TO HAVE THEANNOUNCEMENT OF THE FIRST CLONED HUMAN BABY?Not at all. If you remember, Eve was born on December 26 and it takes about 5days to do the test. So, we could have done the announcement some time inJanuary 1 or 2 without any problems. Dr. Antonari said his babies would beborn in January. So, if you look at that, there would be no pressure.BUT ON FRIDAY WHEN I INTERVIEWED RAEL, I ASKED HIM THISSAME QUESTION AND HE SAID, 'YES,' HE THOUGHT THERE WASCOMPETITION BETWEEN YOU IN CLONAID AND DR. ANTONARI INITALY."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"There are competitions and you can tell how they reacted to me, but the reason Isaid that on December 27 was not because of competition, but from pure joy.WHAT ABOUT THE LESBIAN COUPLE IN HOLLAND? YOU ARE NOTFACING THE LAWSUIT AND ARRAIGNMENT IN FLORIDA THERE. WILLYOU HAVE OBJECTIVE, SCIENTIFICALLY ACCEPTABLE DNA PROOFTHERE?Ye s . Ye s .HOW? AND WHEN?This is underway.NOW THAT THERE IS SO MUCH SKEPTICISM, HOW ARE YOU GOINGTO PROVE THAT THE CELLS ARE TAKEN FROM THE MOTHER ANDFROM THE BABY AND NOT SOMEHOW AS THE SUGGESTION IS NOWTHAT CELLS COULD BE TAKEN FROM THE BABY TWICE OR THEMOTHER TWICE AND PASSED OFF AS BEING THE CELLS FROM AMOTHER AND BABY?Yes, it has to be from an independent expert. I have several proposals fromdifferent scientists. So, there will be those tests performed. And also on the thirdone. It's only a matter of time and I am feeling very comfortable.WILL YOU HAVE TO PUT ON TELEVISION OR VIDEOTAPE NOW THETAKING OF THE CELLS FROM THE BABY AND THE MOTHER SO THATEVERYONE CAN SEE THE PROCESS OF THE REMOVAL OF THE TISSUEAND THEN HAVING SOME DOCUMENTATION THROUGH THEANALYSIS?I don't think I will grant access to any cameraman. With the whole circus aroundthat, I believe they deserve more respect. But the independent experts will be atsuch a level that you cannot doubt what he says, 'I did those samples.'WHAT HAPPENS, DO YOU THINK, IF BABY EVE OR ANY OF THEMBEING BORN NOW IN YOUR PROGRAM OR DR. ANTONARI'SPROGRAM IN ITALY AND IN A MONTH OR TWO OR A YEAR THEYDEVELOP SOME SEVERE MEDICAL PROBLEMS?So far, there are no indications of anything like that. But a baby is born like anyother baby and we are watching very closely. When they are a baby born with asevere defect by natural reproduction, people say 'This is terrible and I try tohelp them.' They will never say it's because the mother has been drinking duringthe pregnancy and things like that. So, these baby clones will be watched veryclosely and if anything happens, the whole world will say, 'This is terrible.' Butthere are deformities born every day because people are not taking care of theirchild. So, I am pretty sure that there will be less problem with the cloned babythen with naturally conceived babies. Luigi Mastroianni, M. D.: \"You cannot assume that simply because an embryoprogresses in vitro to the blastocyst stage which means it's five or six days old that it is a normal embryo. There is no way to tell. In fact, there is very goodevidence that many of these may be abnormal. Even under normal conditions ofreproduction, when years ago the famous Dr. John Roth of Boston Harvard andothers looked at implanted embryos in people, he found there was a substantialnumber of abnormal development in these embryos.there is no way to be absolutely sure that the embryo is normal. Furthermore, ifyou have additional evidence on top of it that the animals are not normal, howcan you in conscience even think about proceeding to this kind ofexperimentation in a human being? It's outrageous. It's wrong!\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ON FRIDAY I ALSO INTERVIEWED DR. ROBERT LANZA, WHO IS ACLONING EXPERT AT ADVANCED CELL TECHNOLOGY INWORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS. HE SAID THAT WITHOUT THIS BEINGCONDUCTED THROUGH SOME KIND OF CORROBORATION OF THENATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OR SOME IMPECCABLE SCIENCEAND MEDICAL GROUP, THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A BACKLASHNOW IN THE AMERICAN CONGRESS TRYING TO SHUT DOWN ANYCLONING EFFORTS AND THAT WILL SWOOP UP INTO THATCONGRESSIONAL EFFORT, A BANNING EVEN ON CLONING OF STEMCELLS. IT SEEMS THAT DISTINCTION IS BEING LOST IN THE FUROROVER A HOAXED CLONING PROCESS. COULD YOU COMMENT ON HISCONCERN?I think it's easy for Dr. Lanza to say what he says because then he looks like thegood guy who is saying what is good to do. But I am pretty sure that in a fewyears from now if we discuss with Dr. Lanza, he will have a different perception.Hopefully, he will agree.COULD YOU ADDRESS HIS CONCERN THAT THE CLONING OF STEMCELL RESEARCH TO APPLY TO THERAPEUTIC CLONING WILL BEBANNED OUT OF THIS CONCERN IN CONGRESS THAT YOU, CLONAID,ARE HOAXING CLONING FOR MONEY AND COMMERCIAL PURPOSESAND THAT CLONING IS NOT SAFE, THEREFORE, ALL CLONINGSHOULD BE BANNED?How can people say we are hoaxing for money? How can people say that? Inever took any money and there are no money coming into the company. So,this is easy to demonstrate. Even the FDA went through our records before andthey could still do it and they will see there is no money. But ACT is having alot of money with stem cells. So, who are the ones talking about money anddealing with money? His concern about stem cells being banned I don't thinkthey will. I think the Congress has more they know what is at stake with stemcells. And I don't think they will.ON THE MONEY ISSUE, YOU DID SAY THAT CLONAID HAS RECEIVEDQUITE A BIT OF MONEY FROM INTERESTED INVESTORS IN ORDER TOMAKE THIS CLONAID EFFORT POSSIBLE?This is correct.YOU HAVE INVESTOR MONEY AND YOU ARE MAKING THEDISTINCTION THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN CHARGING ANY CURRENTPARENTS THAT YOU'VE GONE THROUGH THE CLONING PROCESS?Yes, there is a distinction between building a company and having shareholdersand having customers. I never had any customer in this company. We are aresearch company with investors putting money into the research. We have goodresults. There will be more research done and experiments done at the end ofJanuary. The real commercial activity in our plan should start some time in Juneor July.IN JUNE OR JULY 2003, YOU WILL START CHARGING COUPLES TO GOTHROUGH THE CLONING PROCESS?This is correct, yes.DO YOU KNOW NOW WHAT YOU WILL CHARGE?No, not yet. It will depend on how much we will spend in between. Obviously,the legal aspects will cost more than the scientific aspects.YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COVER LEGAL COSTS AS WELL ASMEDICAL COSTS?Ye s . \""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" If Dr. Boisselier and Clonaid do not prove their claims of human cloning, whatdid she and the Raelian movement have to gain? Professor Arthur Caplan,Director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, offers hisperspective.Arthur Caplan, Ph.D., Director, Center for Bioethics, University ofPennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: \"What's to gain for the cult ispublicity, the possibility of new members and money. They can get people togive them $200,000 to $300,000 a try to make babies. They have done that inthe past. They haven't produced any babies, but they certainly have taken themoney. Their name is everywhere, so they have become well known. If they canstring the hoax along by saying, 'Well, you know, there are reasons why we can'tgive you proof,' they may actually be able to come out of this at most leaving theissue of evidence unsettled. So, they get the PR, they get the attention and itactually doesn't cost them much in terms of reputation lost.Then maybe the public will pay attention to cloning and realize that the battlethat is in front of them is not about cloning people. That's off in the distancesomewhere, maybe never. But using cloning for research that the Chinese, theIndians, the people and scientists in Singapore, and scientists in the UnitedKingdom are doing. And that's very real. And the question becomes: Should webe doing that? Or do we want to prohibit that? If we are going to prohibit that,then we are faced with the choice will we prohibit cures that might pop up inthose other countries from coming in to this country? That's the issue I thinkshould have our attention.\"We b s it e s :http://www.humancloning.org/http://www.bioethics.gov/cloningreport/http://www.clonaid.com/http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~jones/tmp352/projects98/group1/how.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
