Updated - December 5, 2003 - Two influenza vaccine manufacturers announcedtoday that they have shipped all their vaccines and will not have any more untilthe spring of 2004. So, if one doctor's office is out of flu shots, try another.Some offices and clinics have more flu vaccines than others. Explaining the current flu vaccine shortage, Dr. Julie Gerberding, Director of theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said, \"This year it appearsthat many more people than in recent years received a flu shot during Octoberand November, and unlike other years, there is high interest in obtaining flushots into December. CDC is doing everything possible to assess the availabilityof flu vaccine to identify any locations that have supplies that may be able to bemade available to locations that need vaccine. Some states have plans in place toredistribute vaccine supplies should that be needed. Dr. Gerberding said that in more typical years, about 70-75 million Americansreceive a flu shot. In 2003, flu vaccine manufacturers \"produced approximately83 million doses of flu vaccine. The United States has never used more than 80million doses of flu vaccine in a season.\" December 1, 2003 Houston, Texas - In Denver, Colorado, this week, eightchildren have died of the nasty Fujian Influenza A flu bug known to doctors asH3N2. Another death this week in New Mexico has been linked to Fujian. TheFujian virus originated in the Fujian province of China and was the main flustrain in Australia this summer.H3N2 is the same subtype virus that caused the 1968 epidemic known as \"Hong"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Kong Flu.\" But H3N2 has changed its surface antigens so much over the pastthirty-five years that even people who had the Hong Kong flu won't have muchimmunity from the current Fujian version. The result is a severe and earlyoutbreak of this serious viral strain in Texas, Colorado, Scotland and England.And it's bound to spread much further around the Northern Hemisphere thiswinter.Paul Glezen, Director of the Influenza Research Center at Baylor College ofMedicine in Houston, Texas, says, \"We will probably see more excess deathsthan we saw in the 1968 Hong Kong Flu pandemic. We have to expect this yearthat we'll see U. S. mortality in the range of 70,000, which is high.\"Interview:Paul Glezen, M. D., Professor of Molecular Virology and Microbiology andPediatricsand Epidemiologist for the Influenza Research Center, Baylor College ofMedicine, Houston, Texas: \"It's the same influenza subtype, but antigenically,it's quite different because the surface antigens of the virus are changing almostconstantly. So, in 35 years, this virus has changed a lot antigenically, but it's stillan influenza A H3N2 subtype which is the subtype that appeared in 1968.DOES THAT MEAN PEOPLE WHO GOT THE HONG KONG FLU IN 1968AND WERE VERY ILL WOULD HAVE SOME INCREASED IMMUNITY TOTHIS PARTICULAR VIRUS?Not much left because the surface antigens are the antigens that we makeantibodies to and those antigens have changed considerably since 1968. So, Idon't think the 1968 immunity helps much. Influenza H3N2 SymptomsIN TERMS OF SYMPTOMS, WOULD THE SYMPTOMS OF THE FUJIANH3N2 BE ANY DIFFERENT FROM THE 1968 HONG KONG?Symptoms of flu will depend on dose of virus and susceptibility of the host. It'spretty standard. If you're susceptible, you're going to get a high fever, achingbody, chills, sore throat, cough and then whatever happens whether you are ableto handle the infection and slow it down or whether you get a complicationwhich can be a bacterial or a progression of the viral infection. But they all startabout the same. Child DeathsWHY HAVE CHILDREN DIED?Children are 'naive' virgin to influenza because they haven't lived long enough tobe exposed to flu virus and that means they are susceptible. Studies have shownthat young children have a very high risk of ending up in the hospital with theirfirst exposure to influenza. And of course, there are three different viruses, sothey have to get exposed to three different ones. (See: More Information below)We have to assume that if hospitalization rates are high that some of those kidsare going to die. I think most studies show that there is some mortality, but it'smuch lower than we see in the elderly patients that have chronic underlyingconditions. They are going to be more vulnerable and more likely to die.IN THE CHILDREN IN COLORADO, DO YOU HAVE ANUNDERSTANDING OF WHAT EXACTLY KILLED THEM?No, I don't. I haven't seen any clinical descriptions of what they had. But I cantell you what has been seen around the country the past two years."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Influenza Viruses Attack Vital OrgansNumber one: there is encephalopathy and that is brain swelling and that can befatal.Number two: you can get a fulminating pneumonia and that can be fatal.Number three: then there is a possibility of getting myocarditis, inflammation ofthe heart muscle. That has been suspected in some of those cases.In all three of those anything that affects the vital organ system can be fatal. Andflu can affect the central nervous system (CNS), heart or lung. Most commonlyis lung, but in the fatal cases, the central nervous system and heart can beinvolved as well.IS IT BRONCHITIS AND PNEUMONIA THAT CAUSES THE MOSTDEATHS IN THE H3N2 FLU?Probably, yes. Probably the lower respiratory tract involvement causes the mostdeaths, but they occur in people who have an underlying condition and becauseof the underlying condition, the death often gets attributed to their chronicdisease like heart disease or cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, orwhatever their underlying condition is. So, it's kind of hard to tell what iscausing the death. But I think that you're correct. It's probably the bronchitis andpneumonia that are contributing to deaths in people who are already chronicallyill.FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE AS DIRECTOR OF THE INFLUENZARESEARCH CENTER AT BAYLOR MEDICAL CENTER, DO YOU THINKTHAT H3N2 FUJIAN COULD END UP BEING WORSE THAN 1968 HONGKONG?I've been quoting as saying, and this is correct, that there will be more deathsthis year than there were in 1968 when that was the new pandemic strain. Butyou've got to realize that our population increased and we have a much largerelderly population of vulnerable people. There are a lot of factors involved inthat, but I do think there will be more deaths this year than there were in 1968. Estimated 2003 Mortality Rate From Influenza A H3N2Fujian VirusWe've had three mild years and now it looks like we are getting caught up andgetting another bad year. I would expect this year to be more like the number ofdeaths we saw between 1997 and 2000, which would be in the range of 70,000excess deaths.AS OPPOSED TO AROUND 35,000 IN A SO-CALLED AVERAGE YEAR?That's just for deaths attributed to heart and lung disease from influenza, 36,000.But what we generally use is total excess mortality and that previously was20,000. Now, it's 51,000.OF THE 280 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE UNITED STATES, WHATPERCENTAGE WOULD END UP WITH THIS FLU THIS TIME?I think at least 20%. So, we're talking about 50 million people at least in2003-2004. And about 70,000 excess deaths. How Best To Protect Yourself Against InfluenzaFlu Vaccine"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Anti-viral DrugsI think the main thing is that people take the vaccine and remind them about theanti-virals because anti-virals have to be used early to be effective. They are veryeffective if they are used promptly after the onset of illness. Number one:vaccine. And if they get a breakthrough of the flu despite the vaccine, it can betreated because the treatment will not only shorten the course of the illness, butit will reduce the chance that they will get a complication and it will reduce thechance that they will spread it to their contacts. So, it's a wise thing to do.IS IT TRUE THAT IN THE CURRENT VACCINES, THERE IS NOTHINGTHAT IS DEALING WITH THE SPECIFIC ANTIGENIC CHANGES OF THEFUJIAN VIRUS?Well, the current flu vaccine has the Panama in it which was the previous variantand there is definitely some cross-protection. We just can't say how much yet.HOW LONG WILL IT BE BEFORE THEY HAVE THE CURRENT FUJIANSTRAIN IN AN INFLUENZA SHOT?They are making a vaccine for the Southern Hemisphere right now that willcontain it and that will be available here in the spring (of 2004).WHICH WILL BE AFTER IT'S DONE ITS...Right, after our epidemic here.SO IT IS WORTH IT TO GO OUT AND TRY TO GET THE CURRENTINFLUENZA SHOT?Very definitely, yes, very definitely.DOES WASHING HANDS CONSTANTLY HELP?Not too much because influenza is airborne and you inhale it in. It's better tohave the antibodies to fight it off rather than trying to protect yourselfphysically.But hand washing is important, because you've got to remember there are tenother viruses circulating around right now - coronaviruses like SARS and therhinoviruses that cause colds. Hand washing is very important in fending offcoronaviruses. But those viruses are more stable and remain viable andinfectious on surfaces that we are in contact with all the time. So, hand washingis important. But it's not necessarily going to protect you against gettinginfluenza that you can breathe in. Persistent High Fever Demands Doctor or EmergencyAttentionWHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND TO PARENTS WHO HAVE A COUGHINGCHILD WHO HAS BEEN SICK WITH FLU SYMPTOMS, OR OLDERPERSON WHO IS COUGHING HARD? WHAT ARE THE WARNINGSIGNALS THAT THEY SHOULD GO TO AN EMERGENCY ROOM ORDOCTOR?Fever is probably the best guide. If they are still running a pretty good fever,then they should go in. Coughs can persist for a long time. You also have tothink about the possibility of active airway disease or asthma because that willbe exacerbated by the flu and if they have persistent coughing, then you have tothink about whether they have to be taken in for active airway disease. So, thereare several possibilities. But they definitely need to see the doctor if a high feverpersists.IF THERE WERE INFLAMMATION IN THE HEART MUSCLE OR HEARTSAC, WHAT WOULD THOSE SYMPTOMS BE?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Heart failure or in the sac, you get a lot of pain, too.SO, IF YOU'RE IN THAT CATEGORY, YOU'RE ALREADY IN SO MUCHTROUBLE THAT SOMEONE IS GETTING YOU 911 TO THE HOSPITAL?Depends on how rapidly it comes on, but you definitely need to have medicalcare.HOW DO YOU KNOW, HOW DOES A PATIENT KNOW THE DIFFERENCEBETWEEN A NORMAL BAD HEADACHE AND HAVINGENCEPHALOPATHY WITH THIS H3N2 VIRUS?Persistent bad headache. If they start to become disoriented that would be anearly sign. Not know where they are or what time it is or whatever.Unfortunately, a lot of kids have seizures and that's a pretty sharp sign ofproblems.More Information:Three Influenza Viruses in United States NowThere are two sub types of Influenza A:1) H3N2 (Panama subtype in the current vaccine, which is not exactly the sameas the new variant.)2) H1N1 (New Caladonia in the vaccine now.)Structure of the influenza A virus, © Science Photo Library, GlaxoKlineSmith.3) Influenza B.Influenza B and Influenza A H1N1 don't change as fast as H3N2, so that meansolder people and older children and adults are more likely to have some partialimmunity to B or H1N1. But all three viruses are bad for little kids who are stillvery susceptible to infection.We b s it e :http://www.cdc.govhttp://www.medmall.org/Proflu/page5.htmlhttp://www.eurosurveillance.org/ew/2003/031023.aspCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Republication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
