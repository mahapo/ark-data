Cherlette emphasized that MUFON members had beene-mailing her group to protest a presentation of the Urandir Oliveira \"hoax,\" asbranded by Brazil MUFON Director and publisher of Brazilian UFOMagazine, Ademar Jose Gevaerd, known as A. J.I asked her, \"Isn't this censorship before even the physical evidence from thescientists has been reported?\" She said, \"No, we just don't want to be abattleground.\" I said, \"I'm not doing battle with anyone. I was invited to go toBrazil to collect physical evidence and have it analyzed in American labs that Itrust, with the goal of science insights about what happened to the bed sheet andceiling in Urandir Oliveira's bedroom on September 15, 2002. It is A. J. Gevaerdwho is doing the attacking.\" Then she said, \"A. J. Gevaerd is internationalMUFON and MUFON people in the United States have sent us a lot of e-mailssaying they don't want to hear about a hoax.\"So, I called John Schuessler, Director, International Mutual UFO Network(MUFON) in Littleton, Colorado, to see if MUFON had in fact taken an officialor unofficial position to ignore the Corguinho, Brazil phenomena, as dictated byA. J. Gevaerd. I said I really would like to understand, \"since you are theDirector of MUFON in the United States, why the Director of MUFON inBrazil, A. J. Gevaerd, should be blasting the United States e-mail lists, includingsome MUFON, with protests about this Urandir Oliveira case, calling me namesfor ignoring his claims that it's all a hoax. Linda Howe is not researching forMUFON or anybody else. I'm an investigative reporter and I'm workingindependently. And to be attacked the way A. J. Gevaerd is attacking, John, Iwould like to understand why?\"Interviews:John Schuessler, Director, International Mutual UFO Network (MUFON),Littleton, Colorado: \"I would, too. First of all, MUFON does not supportattacks on individuals, no matter who they are. We do not support that. That'sfor the record. We only attack data, not people. Anything other than that isreprehensible, as far as I'm concerned. I don't attack people and I don't expectother people to attack people. That's only done by people who do not have data.For the record, if you are doing an investigation where you collect samples andyou take them to the laboratory, the results should stand on the results of thelaboratory, not on somebody's opinion.I SHARE EXACTLY THAT POSITION. THAT'S WHY I'M BAFFLED. YOUMUST BE GETTING THE SAME.E-MAILS?I haven't gotten anything from him, or anyone else. Not a single e-mail."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"YOU, DIRECTOR OF MUFON, IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE NOTRECEIVED THE E-MAILS FROM A. J. GEVAERD IN BRAZIL?Not a one. I haven't seen anything from anybody on this. You are completelysurprising me. The State Director of Washington was here at MUFONheadquarters (in Littleton, Colorado) all weekend and didn't know anythingabout it.Any case has the right to be investigated and re-investigated by anybody anytime. That's the first thing. There is no reason why a person who investigates, orwho claims to investigate a case, should object to someone else doing it. It'sdone in police work all the time. Police cases are cross-checked. One guy's sidesays, 'This is not the case.' The other guy's side says, 'It is.' So, there is aninvestigation by both teams usually. And that's just common practice. It'snothing untoward.Secondarily, you have been open about what I have seen today by putting whatyou have found on your website for all the world to see and read.AND I HAVE REPORTED THE CASE ON THREE RADIO PROGRAMS.And reported it openly. Nothing else has been posted except I don't know ifGevaerd has a website or not. I doubt it, but he has not bothered to send anyoneanything except the e-mails I got (forwarded) from you that claim it's a hoax.That's an empty claim if there isn't any proof. I'm disappointed that something iscoming into this country saying MUFON is behind it and MUFON doesn't evenhave a case report. At least as far as I know, there is no case report.YOU TOOK OVER THE DIRECTORSHIP OF MUFON IN WHAT MONTHAND YEAR?October 2000.SINCE OCTOBER 2000, HAVE YOU HAD ANY CASE FILE SENT TO YOUFROM A. J. GEVAERD IN BRAZIL?I can't say I have had none, but I don't remember any. But I know there has beennothing on this that has reached me.MY POSITION IS THAT THERE IS PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THAT SHOULDBE INVESTIGATED AND WE SHOULD HEAR WHAT SCIENTISTS SAY.Well, you're an independent investigator and I uphold your right toindependently investigate something, whether or not I would agree with you onthe answer. You have a right to do that and I wholeheartedly support that. That'swhat this is all about, free inquiry. If we cancel free inquiry, we might as welltake anybody's answer for anything and say, 'That's good enough for me, duh.'IF THEY ARE ATTACKING EVEN BEFORE THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCEHAS BEN ANALYZED...That's not the way we do it. It's officially not the way we do it.IT'S WORTH CLARIFYING TONIGHT THAT THIS IS NOT YOUR POSITIONAND YOU KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THIS CASE UNTIL I CALLED YOUTODAY!Yes, nobody has even bothered to tell me. Now, having seen your websitereports today, I am really impressed with what you have done. I have a lot ofrespect for Lefty Levengood and when he does an analysis he usually tries veryhard to clearly and simply tell the truth about the analysis. He doesn't makethings up. As such, his analysis is one good data point. If someone wants to do asecond analysis, which I always encourage more than one analysis by more thanone lab, they would probably find the same thing, that is really damningevidence for something."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"PHYLLIS BUDINGER, SHE IS A WELL RESPECTED ANALYTICALCHEMIST WHO HAS WORKED WITH LEVENGOOD ON MANYINVESTIGATIONS AND SHE HAS NO EXPLANATION FOR HOW THERECOULD BE POLYESTER WOVEN IN COTTON WITH POLYESTERHAVING A 500 DEGREE F. MELTING TEMPERATURE, COTTON HAVINGA 300 DEGREE F. SCORCH TEMPERATURE, AND YET HERE AREMELTED POLYESTER THREADS THROUGHOUT THE (UNSCORCHED)COTTON. ONE OF THE SUGGESTIONS HAS BEEN THAT WHATEVERTHIS WAS WAS MOLECULARLY MAKING A DIFFERENTIATIONBETWEEN THE COTTON AND THE POLYESTER IN WHATEVERENERGY WAS APPLIED.That's an interesting hypothesis that needs to be followed and determined whatcould do that. One of the problems we have in this field is that everyone wantsto investigate it like they did 30 years ago and not look at new technologies andnew concepts. I think that's one reason we don't get answers. That's why Iencourage revisiting cases and looking again at them.\"We b s it e :http://www.mufon.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
