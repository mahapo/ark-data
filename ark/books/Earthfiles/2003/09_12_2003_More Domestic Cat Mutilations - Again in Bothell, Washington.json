It was done very cleanly and very precisely.\"- Cherie Good, D.V.M., Bothell, Washington Bothell, Washington circled on the map is twelve miles northeast of Seattle,Washington, has a population of 32,985 and 23 parks.September 12, 2003 Bothell, Washington - Domestic cat mutilations have been reportedsince at least the 1970s, and now more have turned up in Bothell, Washington. Twelvemiles northeast of Seattle, Bothell is a city of 32,985 people, 23 parks and the BothellPolice Department has case files on three cat mutilations in May and June 2002, and threecat mutilations between August 1 and September 1, 2003. Not far to the northwest, AnimalControl for the Vancouver, B. C. City Pound filed several mutilation reports in 1992 to1994 on domestic cats found neatly cut in half without blood.Two of the 2003 Bothell cats were cut up into thirds and the middle part taken. The catbody portions left behind show on x-rays that all internal organs are missing except for thebladder, all without any blood on the animal or in the owner's or neighbor's yards where thedead cats have been discovered.Over the past several months in Salt Lake City, Utah, a dozen cats have also been foundcut up the same bloodless way. In Denver, Colorado, more than forty small animals havebeen mutilated over the past couple of years and the Denver Dumb Friends League isoffering a $12,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyonefound responsible. In Bothell, Washington, a non-profit group known as Pasado Safe Havennow has a $5,000 reward there.In addition to Bothell, Vancouver, Denver, and Salt Lake City, hundreds of other catmutilations over the years have been reported in Falls Church, Virginia; Lee, New York;Los Alamos, New Mexico; Ahwatakee Foothills, Arizona; Plano and Austin, Texas;Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Navarre and Pensacola, Florida; Tustin, San Diego and SanJose, California, London, England, and Toronto, Canada.In 1978 in St. Catharines near Toronto, Canada, authorities were frustrated by more than100 missing cats and dogs and many others found in their owners' yards skinned,decapitated, disemboweled, cut in half or paws removed, without blood at the site.The New York Times Reported About Mutilated CatsTen years later on August 13, 1989, The New York Times reported that 67 cats had beenfound mutilated in Tustin, California - a suburb of Los Angeles near Santa Ana. The NYT"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"wrote:\"Some of them were cut in half with what some say is almost surgical precision,others disemboweled or skinned. One resident said, 'There is never any blood at thescene, the animals are often dismembered with surgical precision and paws and otherbody parts are often left on the ground in strikingly similar arrangements. No oneever seems to hear anything, nor do dogs bark during the killing.' It was believed thecats are captured, taken elsewhere, their blood drained and organs removed, thenreplaced on their owners' lawns.\" Bothell, Washington Cat Mutilationsin August to September 2003Now it's happening again in Bothell, Washington, and so far all the victims have beenmales. The first case was reported the first week of August and the most recent was foundSeptember 1st. This week I talked with a veterinarian there who has examined the threemutilated cats in the past four weeks. She is Cherie Good, D.V.M., who runs The Cat Clinicat Canyon Park in Bothell. She received her Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine fromOklahoma State University in 1995 and has been practicing in the Bothell area since then,now exclusively for cats.Interview:First Mutilation, Cat BloodlesslyCut Into Three PartsCherie Good, D.V.M., The Cat Clinic at Canyon Park (exclusively cat veterinaryservices), Bothell, Washington: \"The very first one we had was cut in thirds. The middlesection of the animal was completely missing and all of his organs were missing, the entirethoracic contents, the stomach, liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys. The only thing that wasleft with him was his bladder was intact and a small section of the colon. The remains, thefront third and the remaining third were put back in the owner's backyard the followingday.The first case shown below also had a tremendous amount of dirt in the oral cavity andseveral nails were shredded indicating to me some kind of a struggle. Also, the first andthird cases both had a very similar bone break high up in the neck region at the atlanto-occipital joint, basically where the headattaches to the neck. But there was very little bruising or any other lesion associated withit.Mutilated male cat found in the first week of August 2003,bloodlessly cut into thirds with the middle section gone. Dr. Good is holding the cat'shead in this photo to show the dirt inside the cat's mouth. Photograph© 2003 by Cherie Good, D.V.M., Bothell, Washington.WERE THEY IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER AS IF YOU WOULD SAY IFTHE FIRST THIRD AND BACK THIRD WERE PUT TOGETHER, SO IT WAS LIKE ASHORT CAT? OR WERE THEY SEPARATED?It was very close proximity. In fact, the owner didn't even realize. They were in suchshock, they didn't even realize that there was any of him missing. They actually thought hehad been cut in half and that he was placed back that way."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Above, first mutilated male cat found cut in three parts first week of August 2003.Dr. Good laid cat out to show the correct width of severed and removed middle sectionof the cat. Below is an x-ray of the same cat showing the dark space in the back half that indicatesall internal organs there have been removed. Photograph and x-ray © 2003 by Cherie Good, D.V.M.You can see there is a very clear demarcation where the cuts were made. Then there is anobvious section of the spine that is missing which should be connecting there and the entireabdominal and thoracic contents are missing and that's very clearly visible on theradiograph. Everything is missing from there. What you are getting is that entire space isfilled with air as opposed to intestinal contents which would show up whiter or with tissuedensity like the muscles of the legs would be. If you are looking at everything else aroundthe cat on the outside of the cat, it shows up black. That's just air. That's not going toradiograph at all. It doesn't have any density to it. So it's showing up dark in the centralsection because there are no contents in there except for the bladder in the very last part ofthe colon there.Arrow points at remaining bladder and small section of pink colon,the only organs remaining in the back half of the first mutilated male cat foundin Bothell the first week of August 2003. Photograph © 2003 by Cherie Good, D.V.M.Second Mutilation, Only Back Third FoundThe second case, we don't have quite as much evidence with him because what was foundwith him was just the back third and the owner had buried him. She knew it was amutilation, but she hadn't thought that there was any pattern or had not heard about any ofthe other reports going on. She had a friend of hers exhume that part of the body and wedid a necropsy on him, too, and that was a similar presentation: just the bladder and thecolon were left in that back section.X-ray of back half of second male cat mutilation in Bothell."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Only bladder and small portion of colon were present.X-ray © 2003 by Cherie Good, D.V.M.Third Mutilation Case, Police ThinkOccurred Within Six Hour Time PeriodThe last case we had, the most recent one, was only slightly different, but the same kind ofpresentation that he was missing somewhere between the early AM hours and then wasreturned to the neighbor's yard where the cat would hang out quite often and visit theneighbor's kitten through the window. With his case, he wasn't cut completely in half, butthere was one very precise incision made from the backbone down to the mid portion ofthe stomach, right behind the rib cage, and again, the entire thoracic contents were missing,including the diaphragm. Very clean cuts in the trachea and esophagus and then at thecolon and the bladder was remaining and he was placed back in the neighbor's yard, too.They (police) are pretty sure this mutilation took place within a period of six hours. In thefirst couple of cases, the cats might have been gone for about a day, but not more than 24hours.

X-ray © 2003 by Cherie Good, D.V.M.Precise, Bloodless ExcisionsFROM YOUR PROFESSIONAL PERSPECTIVE AS A VETERINARIAN, WOULD YOUSAY THAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT SURGICAL CUTS IN ALL THREE ANIMALS?They are very precise cuts. I don't know if surgical is the right term to use for it, but it'ssomething that took what had to be a very sharp instrument with very precise cuts. Whatwas done to the cats was done with three or four cuts and that was it. There was noevidence of any sawing or jagged edges or tearing, or anything like that. It was done verycleanly and very precisely.THAT WOULD IMPLY THAT WHOEVER DID THIS KNEW WHAT THEY WEREDOING MEDICALLY?Medically? For me, it seems you would have to know a little bit about anatomy to knowwhat you were going after specifically. It wouldn't have to be specifically cat anatomy. Itwould be very similar with dog anatomy or other small animals, the same kinds of thingsmissing would be pretty uniform from the cat to the dog. So, (the mutilators) have to havesome kind of knowledge about what they are going for. The purpose of what they are goingfor, I don't know.WAS THERE ANY FLUID BLOOD IN ANY OF THE REMAINING PARTS OF THECATS OR ON THE GROUND AROUND THEM?In the first two cases, there was not evidence of any. In the third case, there was maybewhat I estimated to be about 20 or 30 cc's of blood remaining in the cavity. But there"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"wasn't anything else around the ground area that they could see.WAS THERE ANYTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT THE BLOOD IN THAT THIRD ANIMALYOU EXAMINED?It was not clotted which indicated to me it was very fresh.Why Are Cat Remains Returned to Home Neighborhood?IN YOUR EIGHT YEARS OF WORKING AS A PRACTICING VETERINARIAN, HAVEYOU EVER SEEN ANY OTHER CASES LIKE THESE THREE BEFORE?No. And I never thought I would either. That's not something I fathomed. I've heard aboutcat mutilations and I have seen other animals that have been abused in various ways, butI've never seen something this deliberate and purposeful, especially with the remains beingplaced back to the owners to find it.THAT'S PUZZLING, ISN'T IT? WHY ARE THE BODIES RETURNED?Right.ANY SP ECULATION?I have no idea. There is obviously a point trying to be made, but it's something that's justvery, very disturbing. I've heard cases before that are somewhat cult or Satanic-related orsomething like that and I don't even begin to understand what goes on with that. But I'veheard about rituals before where they are using the heart for some purpose, whatever thatmight be, but I don't think in any of those cases that I've heard an animal has been placedback for the owners to find.AND IN SATANIC CULT OPERATIONS THAT I'VE BEEN INVOLVED ININVESTIGATING REPORTS ABOUT SATANIC CULT OPERATIONS WITH LAWENFORCEMENT, BLOOD IS ALWAYS INVOLVED. AND THE THING THAT ISEERIE ABOUT CAT MUTILATIONS AND SMALL ANIMAL MUTILATIONS AROUNDTHE WORLD, IS THEY ARE SO BLOOD-LESS.Right. Yeah, and these are very clean.Bothell Police Call in FederalU.S.D.A. Forensics ExpertDID YOU EXAMINE IN EACH CAT HOW THE SPINE WAS SEVERED TO DIVIDETHEM INTO THREES? DOES THERE SEEM TO BE A GLASSY SURFACE AS IFTHEY HAVE BEEN SUBJECTED TO HIGH HEAT?That, I did not get. I do know that all the bodies that are being examined by somebody elsewho is more or a specialist in that field. The necropsies we did initially. I mean we are noway a forensic specialist, so I wouldn't be able to determine that. All I can say is they wereclean cuts, but I have no idea by what kind of instrumentation it was done.WHO IS DOING THAT KIND OF FOLLOW UP WORK?It's somebody that the police are dealing with. We are supposed to get the bodies back actually returned to the owners so we can have them for private cremation. But I believethat's in the police's hands right now. I know they are going with someone associated withthe U.S.D.A., so it's a federal case at this time.DID THE BOTHELL POLICE CALL THE FEDS IN?Yes, they did after the third case, they finally started believing that it was more than just ananimal attack.\"More Information:$5,000 Reward Offered in Bothell, WashingtonIn Bothell, the non-profit organization called Pasado Safehaven is offering a $5,000reward for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of anyone responsible forthe cat mutilations."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Previous Earthfiles.com Reports About Domestic Cat Mutilations.See Earthfiles Archives for 1999 through 2002 reports:· 07/01/2003 -- 40 Small Animal Mutilations in Denver and 11 in Salt Lake City· 11/16/2002 -- More Cat and Cow Mutilations: Colorado, Utah and Missouri· 05/31/2002 -- Bloodless Cat Mutilations in Bellingham, Washington· 10/20/2001 -- Dozen Mutilated Cats Found in San Diego, California· 09/08/2001 -- 23 \"Half Cat\" and 2 Deer Mutilations Confirmed by Austin, Texas Law Enforcement· 08/12/2001 -- Unusual Cat Deaths in Navarre, Florida and Austin, Texas· 11/18/1999 -- Short Environmental Updates· 11/07/1999 -- Environmental Updates and Calf Fetus Shocks Los Brazos, New Mexico· 11/05/1999 -- Reward Offered As Cat Mutilations Continue in Toronto, Canada· 10/10/1999 -- More Cat Mutilation Reports from Ft.
