This lightning was striking the ground, and sometimesstriking the ground twice in a second. And no noise!IT LOOKED LIKE LIGHTNING BOLTS, BUT THE COLOR WAS ORANGE?Bright orange. What happened was that it drifted in a great circle around us, butwhere we were stayed bone dry. There was no rain, no noise, just these lightningstrikes going all the way through the night. It was actually still going at dawn. Itwasn't until around 7 a.m. that these heavy dark clouds rolled overhead and thehail and rain howled down. Silver white lightning was striking us quite closelyover East Field and definitely was noisy.To make things stranger, there were lightning strikes between the clouds. At thesame time, it looked like a cookie cutter had cut through the clouds and therewas this glow inside, sort of a circle that was glowing orange. Al l in all, it waspretty weird. I heard people in the crop circle cafe over at Cherhill reportedseeing orange lightning that night, too.BUT STILL NO FORMATION IN THE EAST FIELD.Not yet.\"http://home.clara.net/lucy pringlehttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.invisiblecircle.de and http://www.invisiblecircle.org/ser/d-archiv-2003.htmlhttp://www.kornkreise.chhttp://www.heramagazine.nethttp://www.cropcirclenews.comhttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expressly"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"prohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
