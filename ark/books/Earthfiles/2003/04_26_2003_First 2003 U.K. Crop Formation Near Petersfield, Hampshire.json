A mathematicalinfinity symbol? Photograph 1994 by Michael Hesemann.April 26, 2003 Privett, Hampshire, England - Andy Thomas, Editor, SwirledNews, told me Friday morning that microlite pilot, David Russell, has flown overan oilseed rape (canola) field southwest of Privett, Hampshire, and takenphotographs of the first crop formation of 2003 in England. David estimated the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"diameter at 160 feet. Another British source told me the circle surrounding a\"broken figure 8\" was discovered Easter Sunday, April 20, 2003, but notreported at the time.The mathematical symbol for \"infinity\" resembles a figure 8 laid downhorizontally and is sometimes called a lemniscate. The English mathematician,John Wallis (1616-1703) used this symbol to represent mathematical infinity inhis book, Arithmetica Infinitorum in 1655.In spiritual terms, the infinity symbol represents eternity and higher spiritualpowers. In Egypt, the lemniscate was a symbol for the eight primeval forces ofchaos which existed before the creation of the sun god. Those eight were Nunand Naunet, the god and goddess of the primordial waters; Kek and Keket, thedeities of darkness; Amon and Amaunet that represent invisible power; and Hehand Hehet that represent infinity.In numerology, the number eight is also linked to the power of all there is beforecreation. The number eight also represents karma, or the repayment of karma.Interview:Andy Thomas, Editor, Swirled News, Cooksbridge, Lewes, East Sussex,England, and Author, Vital Signs: A Complete Guide to the Crop CircleMystery and Why It Is Not A Hoax: (See More Information below). \"The newformation we've just had it's still so new that information is only just percolatingthrough. Although we only heard about it in the last few days it did appear onthe 20th of April, which was Easter Sunday. News is still going around and Ihave not yet met anyone who has been inside it. This is a fair distance from meand I haven't had a chance to go over.I GOT AN AERIAL FROM DAVID RUSSELL LAST NIGHT AND IT ISALMOST A CLEAR NUMERAL 8 WITH A VERY STRANGE DISCONNECTAT THE CENTER, WHERE NORMALLY A NUMBER 8 WOULD JUSTSMOOTHLY FLOW. THE DISCONNECT WAS PUZZLING AND IWONDERED IF YOU OR ANYBODY HAD ANY THOUGHTS ABOUT THECHARACTER OF THAT WHERE IT IS DISCONNECTED?I think we have to be careful not to jump to conclusion that it is the number 8.We're describing here for those who haven't seen it, it does look like a digit 8inside a ring, a bit like the beginning of a film where you get the countdowns ona proper film. If you turn it up the other way, maybe it's not the digit 8 at all.And as you say, the loop in the middle of the 8 does not join up. This is not anaccident. You can see clearly this is a very deliberate part of the design and thatdisconnection in itself might have some kind of message. It will be veryinteresting to see if someone else comes along and says, 'No, this is this ancientsymbol.' Or represents this. But as yet, I haven't come across anybody who says,'Well, yes, I recognize it.' A lot of people are calling it the number 8, but Isuspect there's more to it than that.YES, BECAUSE IT IS NEITHER WHAT WE THINK OF AS THE NUMBER 8AND IT IS NOT THE CLASSIC INFINITY SYMBOL WHICH LIESHORIZONTALLY BUT HAS FLUIDITY OF THE INFINITY SYMBOL. THISIS ALMOST DELIBERATELY SAYING THESE ARE TRUNCATED HERE.THESE ARE CUT.I agree. It's a very deliberate symbol. It's not like somebody went around andmissed the other loop. It is very clear in the way it does it. And as you say, we'vehad mathematical infinity symbols in crop before and they have always beenvery definite, flowing. This is a little unexpected start for the season.Having said that, it's a fairly typical, not too big (160 feet diameter), not too"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"complex, fairly simple start to the season. By and large, that's the way it beginsand then will take a trajectory from there. Of course, what you find by the timeyou get to the middle of July these early formations are completely forgottenabout in all the hooha over the fantastic huge formations that we tend to get atthe peak time. We need to concentrate on this one now before it's eaten up byall the others that appear around it.ANOTHER THING THAT IS STRANGE. I TALKED WITH LUCY PRINGLEYESTERDAY. SHE LIVES ONLY ABOUT 8 MILES FROM THISFORMATION. SHE SAID THAT SHE TRIED TO FIND IT IN A FIELD THATDAVID RUSSELL, WHO HAD FLOWN OVER IN THE MICROLITE ANDTAKEN THE PHOTOGRAPHS, TOLD HER WAS IN A FIELD SLIGHTLYSOUTHWEST OF PRIVETT. BUT SHE STILL HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TOFIND THE FORMATION. THAT SAYS SOMETHING ABOUT SO MANY OFTHESE PATTERNS ARE SO DISGUISED ON THE GROUND AS IF ONLYTO BE SEEN FROM THE AIR. AND WHY?It would seem that way. One report we had from a chap who contacted us saidhe could see the formation from the old railway line that runs between WestMeon and Privett. So, there obviously is a place on the ground where if you arein the right place you can see it, or at least get an inkling that there is somethingin the field. But as you say, you need elevation, you need to be above theseformations to really appreciate what they are.I can think of one example in 1996 here in Sussex at a place called ManningsHeath where we had a circle in the field where you could not see it fromanywhere. It was just chance that one of our microlight pilots flew over that weever knew it was there. No one would ever have spotted it from the ground itwas just a completely isolated field. So, yeah, it does make you wonder, likethey are waiting to be seen from above. Even now, with all these people flyingaround, I'm sure formations get missed, even here in England.YES, AND DAVID RUSSELL HAS FLOWN A LOT OVER THE LAND AND IASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT JUST TAKING THE SHOTS LOOKINGDOWN ON THIS NEW \"FIGURE 8\" IN THE CIRCLE, FOR LACK OF ABETTER TERM. HE SAID THAT THIS LOOKED ESPECIALLY CRISPHAVING PHOTOGRAPHED OTHER FORMATIONS.It is nice. It's a very clear and precise design. From that point of view, it's a niceway to start the season. Sometimes you'll find that the first formation of theseason gets missed for about three weeks and by the time it's photographed, theoilseed rape - which is usually the crop for the first formation for the obviousreason that that is the highest crop which comes up first - by the time youphotograph it, it's so vague and grown up so much you can hardly see it. Butwith this one, it's been caught in plenty of time to see it in its prime. It's verypristine and very clear. I look forward to hearing reports from people - if theycan find it on the ground! - of what the lay is like inside.The trouble with oilseed rape formations is by the time you've had only a fewvisitors wandering around inside, you're going to start to get damage to theplants. Unless you get reports from people who have gone in very early, it's hardto say too much about the condition of the crop.THAT LEADS TO THE QUESTION, WHY IS IT THAT PEOPLEDISCOVERED IT ON EASTER SUNDAY, APRIL 20, BUT THEY DID NOTREPORT IT AND THIS WAS NOT REPORTED UNTIL THE 23 OR 24TH?I did read something today saying that there is an accusation that information onthis formation was deliberately withheld so certain individuals could get theirown photographs of it before anybody else came in to ruin it. I don't knowwhether that's true or not. Unfortunately, this occasionally does happen wheresomebody will find a formation and keep it all to themselves, which I think is abit of a silly thing when you're dealing with a phenomenon that's so out there inthe public. These are for everyone."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"TO ME YOU WERE STRESSING THE REASON IT'S IMPORTANT FOREVERYBODY TO KNOW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND THAT IS THATTHE CROPS EVOLVE, RAPE SEED MATURES, AND TO GETPHOTOGRAPHS AND FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO GET SOIL SAMPLES,OR PLANT SAMPLES, OR WHATEVER TESTS THEY ARE DOING, TO DOIT AS SOON AS THE FORMATION IS DISCOVERED HELPS EVERYONE.SO, THIS DELAY ON THIS FIRST ONE SEEMS STRANGE.Particularly in oilseed rape. Obviously, it is good if you can get in early becauseit's such a brittle plant. This has been said for so many years, but I still think thisis not appreciated by everyone. To bend a piece of oilseed rape is really adifficult thing to do without a lot of damage occurring. I've certainly been informations in years past where there is a 90 degree bend on a stem of rape. Now,you get a stem of rape and try to do that over your knee or whatever, and you'llbreak and crack it. So, it is interesting to examine these plants if you can to seewhat the effects are like inside the formation.I would imagine at the moment in England we've got fields of oilseed rapeglowing yellow. I imagine there will be other formations, hopefully, in the nextfew days, certainly in the next few weeks, where we'll get a chance to see themat close quarters.ONE OF THE SUBTITLES IN YOUR WONDERFUL BOOK, VITAL SIGNS: ACOMPLETE GUIDE TO THE CROP CIRCLE MYSTERY AND WHY IT ISNOT A HOAX - WHAT ARE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE CLAIMED YEARAFTER YEAR THAT THEY ARE THE ANSWER AND THE ONESRESPONSIBLE FOR CROP FORMATIONS SAYING? HAS ANYBODYTRIED TO CLAIM THIS 8 IN THE CIRCLE AT PRIVETT?I've not heard anyone claim it. The human circlemakers generally don't claimindividual formations, or at least not publicly. What tends to happen is thatrumors go around in the pubs and you never really get down to the bottom of it.It's very rare that someone actually comes forward and claims in a big way, 'Imade this formation.' I think they would even say that is not the game that theyplay.But on the other hand, of course, that doesn't really help anyone at all and it'sthis whole vagueness that surrounds the people who claim they make themwhich I think gives them a very sloppy case. You have to accept there are somemanmade formations. No one would deny that now. But unfortunately, evennow after years of opportunities, when you look at the manmade demonstrationswhich are made for TV programs or newspapers and you compare not only thequality of the formation but the time and circumstances under which they aremade, this is where you find something very lacking in the majority of themanmade formations. They just don't look the same, or are made under veryunrealistic conditions. So, twelve years after Doug and Dave came forward toclaim they had made all of them, here we are twelve years later...AND ONE OF THEM HAS PASSED ON!Right. So there is still no definitive proof of how many are made by people. Ithink if they were all made by people, by now that definitive proof would bethere out in the public domain. But that hasn't happened.ANDY, ISN'T IT A FACT THAT FROM AT LEAST 1990 TO 2003, NO ONEWHO HAS EVER DEMONSTRATED MAKING A FORMATION IN FRESHOILSEED RAPE?Certainly, I've never come across a televised demonstration where people aremaking a film of one in oilseed rape. I would think that most hoax claimantswould not dare to come out and do one publicly because...IT'S TOO DIFFICULT.That's right, there is too much damage."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"IN THIS DECADE OF EXPLORATION AND INVESTIGATION THATYOU'VE BEEN ON SINCE 1991, DO YOU KNOW IF THERE IS ANYTHINGABOUT THAT PETERSFIELD AND EAST AND WEST MEON AREAHISTORICALLY THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY THERE HAS ALWAYSBEEN SOME FOCUS OF CROP FORMATIONS THERE. IF I REMEMBERCORRECTLY, IT SEEMS THAT IN MORE YEARS THAN NOT, MANYFORMATIONS START SOMEWHERE IN THAT REGION IN HAMPSHIRE.Yes, it's a strange thing. That whole Meon area, as you say, is a place that hasattracted crop circles so many times and you often find that the first crop circleof the year does not necessarily appear in the obvious places. It is true that mostpeople spend their time looking for crop circles in Wiltshire, but very often itwill be this area in Hampshire that will produce one of the early formations ofthe year. Then a few weeks or days later, the usual famous areas in the Aveburyregion will start up and producing their own shapes.But some people would say there's a scientific explanation for why these areasattract crop circles. I'm very struck by this connection between undergroundwater which has been made before, which is that the majority of crop circles -certainly in England - do appear over areas where there is a lot of undergroundwater, or the aquifers, as they are called. And when you look at the map of theaquifers, certainly the Meon Valley in Hampshire is one of the major areas. So,maybe that is an explanation.THAT LINKS WITH THAT OTHER POSSIBLE CONNECTION, LIMESTONE,WHICH IS A KIND OF CRYSTAL AND THE ENTIRE BRITISH ISLES AREMADE BASICALLY OF LIMESTONE. WATER PERCOLATING INTO THATLIMESTONE HAS POCKETED INTO THESE AQUIFERS THAT YOU AREDESCRIBING, BUT WHY WOULD THE SURFACE LAND WHERE CROPSGROW BE LINKED SOMEHOW TO WATER UNDERGROUND?It is known, for instance, that underground water and particularly quartz - otherwalks as well - but quartz especially, can produce what are called piezoelectricfields which are like buzzing energy fields. How exactly they would produce orattract a crop circle to appear is something that a lot of work is being done tounderstand. But there does seem to be perhaps sometime of charge, electricalcharge, or call it what you will, that is present in these areas because of theunderground water and its association with the make-up of the rocks.What is interesting is that you tend to get more crop circles in years following asummer where the aquifers were low, where the water is actually lower. Thisseems to raise the electrical charge, when you look at the way it works. In yearswhen the aquifers are higher, you get slightly less crop circles. It's an area ofresearch that needs far more work and I'm not claiming to be an expert onaquifers and electrical fields, but certainly people looking into this would pointto this as being a factor definitely in where and when certain crop formationsappear.\" Previous Crop Formation At Privett in June 1998In her book, Crop Circles, The Greatest Mystery of Modern Times,photographer and author, Lucy Pringle, discussed a 1998 crop formationdiscovered in Privett on June 15, 1998. \"The farmer at Privett, Hampshire,visited the formation the following day. There had been torrential rain that weekand as the farmer walked down the tractor tramline, he noticed that it wasunmarked. When he looked back over his shoulder, however, his footprints wereclearly visible in the waterlogged ground. When he reached the formation, healso noticed that there was no mud on the flattened crop, which there wouldhave been if the crop had been flattened by some implement.\" His conclusionwas that something must have come from the air downward into the field."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"More Information:Click on cover for link to amazon.com.Copyright 1998 and 2002 by Andy Thomas.\"...
