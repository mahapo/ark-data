Sheehan has long beena Civil Rights attorney. He was involved with the Pentagon Papers, the Silkwood Case,Three Mile Island and defended Harvard psychiatrist John Mack, Ph.D., the abductionresearcher. Sheehan was was also involved in Iran-Contra and studied under HenryKissinger. He's a prominent attorney who was legal counsel to the Jesuit headquarters inWashington, D. C. Sheehan tells the story that he was brought as a consultant into twostudies that were being done for President Jimmy Carter. These studies were being writtenby Marcia Smith, who is now the pre-eminent expert on the Russian space program. If yougo to the Congressional Research Service, all the UFO and extraterrestrial intelligencereports that have been put out have been written by this Marcia Smith.Danny Sheehan currently is still an attorney in San Francisco working on various programs.He made several strong speeches after 9/11 and focuses on civil rights cases. He stated thathe was brought into two studies Marcia Smith was doing for President Jimmy Carter thatthe President had asked for.President James Earl Carter, Jr. and his wife,Rosalynn Carter, on Inauguration day, January 20, 1977."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Sheehan was to give a lecture for the top fifty people at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory inthe SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) section about the implications ofextraterrestrial intelligence on mankind. In order to do that, Sheehan said he wanted accessto the classified Blue Book files. Marcia Smith got him access in the basement of theMadison Building which is one of the three buildings for the Library of Congress inWashington. Sheehan says he was brought into a vault in the basement of the MadisonBuilding and then while looking through microfilms of the classified Blue Book files, hecame across clear pictures of a crashed flying saucer in an embankment with snow andUSAF officers around it. You can clearly read their name tags, he said. There wereclose-ups of writing on the side of the craft and this material Sheehan reported back toMarcia Smith.When I interviewed him, Sheehan said that in one of two studies that were written at theLibrary of Congress for reading by President Jimmy Carter, the reports stated there are atleast six extraterrestrial races from this galaxy visiting our planet. This was in one of thetwo official studies by the Library of Congress for the President of the United States.DID HE DETAIL WHAT THE SIX TYPES WERE AND WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE?No. He basically saw the reports before they went. At that point, they had no classificationmarkings on them. I guess it was sort of the final draft before they went and no exactdetails. He might have them, but I've heard him tell the story a dozen times. I've neverheard him mention details, but he has always mentioned the fact that this statement was inthis one report that was going to the President of the United States.DID HE TRY TO FOLLOW UP FURTHER?Danny Sheehan knows an awful lot. I don't know Marcia Smith. I contacted her by e-mailand Danny Sheehan found out I did and was quite upset that I had contacted Marcia Smithto get her side of the story. The Vatican LibraryHe also tells a story about the Vatican letters. He had contacted the Vatican on behalf of theWhite House after asking for the ET files inside the Vatican library. He knew the guy whoran the Vatican library and Danny Sheehan was Chief Counsel to the Jesuit headquarters inWashington, D. C.He got a reply back that the Vatican library would not release these files and he said it wasthe first time he had ever asked and received a denial from the Vatican. Sheehan wrote asecond letter to the Vatican library and that letter specifically stated the letter was on behalfof the President of the United States (Jimmy Carter.) The Vatican library wrote back, 'No,you can't have the files.'Danny Sheehan still has those letters which is fairly significant. He is close friends withMarcia Smith and my e-mail letter to Marcia Smith, I guess Sheehan was upset because Iwas asking, 'Is Danny Sheehan telling the truth?' He has been protective of her situation. Isaw Danny Sheehan trace out the writing on the craft in the photograph and he did an exacttracing because of overhead on microfilm, he was able to trace on the back of a legal padthe exact symbols that were on the side of the craft inside the classified Blue Book files.So, Danny Sheehan has some stuff that would be pretty dramatic and substantial andbacking his story. But for some reason, I don't know why he hasn't released this.WHAT WAS THE NATURE OF THOSE SYMBOLS IN TERMS OF LANGUAGESAROUND THE WORLD YOU HAVE SEEN?To me, it was just sort of dots and slashes, the way Danny Sheehan showed it.SORT OF TIBETAN?Example of Tibetan script.Maybe, but all that writing of Tibet and hieroglyphs or Arabic Arabic has that same sort oflong slashes and a lot of dots. I didn't recognize it as being anything similar to what I have"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"ever seen.WHAT WAS MARCIA SMITH'S EXACT TITLE IN RELATIONSHIP TO THEPRESIDENT?This is part of the controversy, that she worked for the Library of Congress with theCongressional Research Service. You can read everything I've reported about Marcia S.Smith at my website, www.presidentialUFO.com. She's doing something different now andis fairly high up in the hierarchy of the Library of Congress.She did a number of UFO and extraterrestrial studies. I think there have been four or fivethat have been released by the Library of Congress. All of them were released by her, butas far as I know, she's never been interviewed. She gave Danny Sheehan access to the BlueBook files and tells the story to Sheehan that George Bush, Sr., who was the Director of theCentral Intelligence Agency under Ford he briefed President-Elect Jimmy Carter onintelligence and special programs when Carter was becoming president. When Carter askedfor the UFO files, George Bush told him, 'You don't have the need-to-know. Beingpresident is not sufficient need-to-know. You're going to have to go to Congress and getthem to declassify the files. Marcia Smith is also the source of that story, according toDanny Sheehan.\"More Information:If anyone has more information to contribute to linking American presidents to knowledgeabout crashed aerial vehicles from outer space, please contact Grant Cameron at:E-MAIL: presidentialUFO @presidency.comWebsite:http://www.presidentialUFO.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
