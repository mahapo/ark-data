Rome is acity with a lot of green places and Tre Fontane is important because there is amonastery there where the virgin appeared last century. So, it's a very sacredplace.It's a strange formation because there were four patterns on the ground which isthe property of the priests and they were scared by the publicity and they cut thecrop down, so we were not able to do any research on the field. There existsonly one photograph from the air that was published by an Italian newspaper.(Shown above.)The symbols are very strange there are some circles, one S and other circleconnected with other little circle and some tracks. We don't know if it is anoriginal crop formation or not. It's very strange that someone had an idea to dothis in a sacred place. We are Rome and we have the Vatican, so people don'tjoke with this. So I don't think it is a fake, but we have no proof to tell this isoriginal because it was cut immediately by the priests.When the news arrived to us, the crop was cut. The priests don't want to talkabout this. I talked with the office of the newspaper, and they said they receivedthe information by the police so they went and rented a plane to makephotograph. But when we heard about it, it was late.ARE THE PRIESTS AFRAID OF THE CROP FORMATIONS?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Oh, yes. We are in Rome everything is going out from the normal view ofreligion. It is very difficult to explain and speak to them. They are very scared bypublicity it is a monastic place and they want to be alone.WHAT DO YOU THINK THERE IS ABOUT CROP FORMATIONS THATWOULD SCARE PRIESTS, MONKS OR CITIZENS?They don't want to think about this or UFOs or other intelligent life in theuniverse. They are scared. Of course, the Vatican is talking about other forms oflife in the universe. But for normal priests, everything is going out from thenormal point of view. They are very strange and don't want to talk about it.13) June 19, 2003Location: Perosa Canavese, near Torino in northeastern Italy.Pattern: Pictogram or large circle with extending corridors and arcs.Images: Aerial photo by La Sentinella magazine.Pictogram discovered June 19, 2003 in Perosa Canavesewheat field near Torino.

Aerial photograph by Gianni Basso. Montegranaro, we translate into English like \"the mountain of grain.\" In ancienttimes, the Romans had places where they preserved the crops and they left theresome ruins from stocking the grain. So we have a direct connection with thecrop phenomenon. Also the heraldic symbol of Montegranaro depicts amountain and three pictures of crop, perhaps similar to the June 13 formation inMontegranaro.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"We b s it e s :http://www.heramagazine.nethttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.invisiblecircle.de and http://www.invisiblecircle.org/ser/d-archiv-2003.htmlhttp://www.kornkriese.chhttp://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://home.clara.net/lucy pringlehttp://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://www.cropcirclenews.comhttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
