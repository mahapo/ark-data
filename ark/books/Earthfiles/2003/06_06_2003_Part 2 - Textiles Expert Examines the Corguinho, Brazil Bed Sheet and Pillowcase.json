Barndt, Director of the Grundy Testing Laboratory, School of Textilesand Materials Technology, Philadelphia, University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,photomicrographs by biophysicist Levengood and the entire bed sheet andpillowcase. Prof. Barndt has been working in textiles research for 35 years. Hecollected a control sample from the Corguinho bed sheet to test with the goal oftrying to duplicate the melted polyester threads neatly cross woven with theunaffected cotton threads.Prof. Herbert Barndt cutting a sample from a corner of the bed sheetwhere the material was normal for his experiments to try to reproduce the blue \"halo\"juxtaposed with scorch as seen in the body pattern.

On a very small scale, he was able to simulate the bluehalo around a dark burned scorch after a brief 2 to 4 second exposure of theheat to the bed sheet sample. But the resulting scorch was darker than most ofthe body print on the bed sheet. On May 13, 2003, I talked with him about historch experiment, analytical chemist Phyllis Budinger's report and his overallimpressions of the Corguinho bed sheet and pillowcase.Interview:Prof. Herbert J. Barndt, Director, Grundy Testing Laboratory, School ofTextiles and Materials Technology, Philadelphia University, Philadelphia,Pennsylvania: \"I took a small square of the fabric which you left with me and Iwet it to simulate the conditions that were described.PERSPIRATION.And moisture from the shower. I used a small heat source, a (small blow) torch.I heated the center of the fabric. You can see it started to char in the middle. Butthe (blue) ring around the charred area is darker in color, similar to some of the(blue halo) areas on the fabric and that's because of the polyester shrinking awayfrom the heat.Slight enlargement of the glass slide Prof. Herbert Barndt prepared to examinethe Corguinho cloth sample that he exposed to the 1500 degrees F. blow torch for 2 to 4seconds.There is a blue \"halo\" around the very dark center, darker than most of the body pattern ontheUrandir Oliveira bed sheet. Photograph by Linda Moulton Howe.Blow-up of Prof. Barndt's blow torch test.SO, THE HALO IS CREATED BY THE POLYESTER MELTING AND...?And shrinking and exposing more of the cotton.CAN YOU DEMONSTRATE?(Prof. Barndt turns on the blow torch). You can hear it. Want to feel it? Trustme, it's warm.YEAH, IT SURE IS. AND THE TEMPERATURE THAT'S PUTTING OUT ISABOUT WHAT?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"That's about 1500 degrees F. It's very hot.SO YOU COULD ONLY THEN EXPOSE THAT (FABRIC) FOR LIKE ONESECOND? TWO SECONDS?It was two to four seconds, something in that range. As soon as it started to char,I withdrew the heat. But as you can see, we did accomplish some meltingaround that area.THE SHAPE OF YOUR MELTED POLYESTER, IT'S NOT QUITEIDENTICAL TO THE BRAZIL. THIS IS THAT 40X PHOTOMICROGRAPHTHAT BIOPHYSICIST W. C. LEVENGOOD DID.Prof. Barndt's photomicrograph of the Corguinho bed sheetsample he subjected to the 1500 degrees F. blow torch for 2 to 4 seconds.Photomicrograph by Prof. Herbert J. Barndt.40X photomicrograph by biophysicist W. C. Levengood in early March2003 of Corguinho bed sheet Sample 1 cut from lower right leg of body pattern.WHEN YOU TAKE THE EXPERIMENT THAT PHYLLIS BUDINGER DIDWITH AN IRON AND YOU PUT IT DOWN THE 3 SECONDS, 4 SECONDSAND 10 SECONDS OF THE IRON ON SOME OF THE CONTROL FROMTHIS BED SHEET, IT SEEMED TO BE KIND OF FLATTENED.It's flattened because when polyester is heated under pressure, it spreads andmakes it look flat on top. In fact, it is flat on top. You can do that at home whenyou iron something if you want to.ALSO, WE KNOW NOW THAT AN IRON LIKE AN IRON ON AN IRONINGBOARD COULD NOT MAKE THIS PATTERN BECAUSE IT WOULDSQUASH THE POLYESTER THREADS.Flatten. It would flatten them.AND WE KNOW FROM THE PHOTOGRAPHS UNDER THEMICROSCOPE, YOUR EXPERIMENT AND THE ORIGINALPHOTOGRAPHS FROM THE BIOPHYSICIST THAT IT (POLYESTERTHREADS IN BED SHEET) HAS A VERY NEAT, PRECISE, TOTAL CURVETO IT, SO IT IS NOT FLATTENED.Right.SO, WE HAVE ELIMINATED THE IRON AS A POSSIBILITY.Yes. Could someone have taken a torch and created this? Improbable. Theywould have to have understood an awful lot about what they were doing."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"WHAT ABOUT A SOLDERING IRON?No, anything that has to put pressure against the fabric is not going to producewhat you see in this bed sheet.HOW WOULD YOU DO IT IF YOU WERE GOING TO TRY TOREPRODUCE EVERYTHING THAT YOU ARE SEEING HERE?I don't know exactly what I would do, but I can tell you we'd probably need alot of bedspreads before we got it right. It wouldn't happen the first time, at leastnot what I see happening here.SO, THIS IS EXTRAORDINARY?I think so. It's very unusual. As I said, if you were going to try to duplicate this ina laboratory, you'd probably go through quite a few bedspreads. And why didn'tit just ignite and burn up? Probably because of the presence of moisture orsomething else we can't explain.BECAUSE AN EXPOSURE TO 500 DEGREES F. FOR LET'S SAY 5MINUTES...?It would be a mess.IT WOULD BE A CONGEALED MESS.Well, possibly, it would be worse than that. The cotton would burn for thatlength of time, definitely. The fabric would have dried out, the cotton wouldhave burned, the polyester would have melted. Yeah, it would be a puddle.THERE REALLY ISN'T MUCH CARBONIZATION ANYWHERE ON THIS.Ye s .AGAIN SUPPORTING, IT SEEMS, THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THISHAPPENED QUICKLY.Yeah, that sounds reasonable.This 40X photomicrograph shows a missing vertical thread and threevitreous spots where horizontal fibers cross the missing thread space in the mattress cover.Each thread is .4 millimeters wide. None of the other polyester fibers appear to be affected.Photomicrograph by biophysicist W. C. Levengood. WHAT ABOUT SOME OF THESE DETAILS THAT THE BIOPHYSICISTFOUND UNDER THE MICROSCOPE SUCH AS THAT ONE .4MILLIMETER THREAD (THAT'S MISSING AMONG OTHER UNTOUCHEDONES.)How about I have no idea why that could have happened. You have polyesterhere and here and all along here. You have this one that is obviously missing.Why? You'd almost have to have a very, a pinpoint heat source like a laser to dosomething like that."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"IF YOU HAD A PINPOINT THAT COULD GO DOWN TO .4MM, COULD A.4MM LASER MAKE THIS COMPLICATED PATTERN?No. No. I don't really know what kind of energy source would do that. That's amystery as far as I'm concerned. In the report that you have, if you'll flip back several pages, she talks aboutthermal conductivity. If you look here, the numbers she has given you indicatethat polyester is 10 times more conductive than cotton. And if that is the case,then of course, the polyester could absorb the heat more rapidly than the cotton.FROM YOUR KNOWLEDGE AS BEING A TESTING LABORATORY INTEXTILES, YOU WOULD AGREE WITH THE TEN TIMES NUMBER THATPOLYESTER HAS A HEAT TRANSFER THAT IS TEN TIMES FASTERTHAN COTTON?No. No, I wouldn't.TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW.What I know is from several different texts that they generally suggest thatcotton is more conductive than polyester, which is why polyester is used as aninsulating material in winter clothing and other things. You don't fill a ski jacketwith cotton. You fill it with polyester because polyester is a better insulator thancotton. When we talk about thermal conductivity in the sense of what we do inthis laboratory, it is measuring the conductivity of fabrics, not the conductivityof a sample polymer.OK, SO AN INDIVIDUAL THREAD...Or fiber.OR FIBER CAN GIVE ONE RESULT THAT MIGHT BE COMPLETELYDIFFERENT IF IT IS WOVEN THOUSANDS OF THREADS INTO A WHOLEPIECE OF FABRIC.Yes. And it's also the measurement technique. We use a technique when wemeasure conductivity of a fabric that simulates skin temperature because we'retalking about comfort of the wearer. If you test it at a different temperature level,you might get a different set of results. SO, AS YOU LOOK AT IT NOW CLOSE UP WITH ALL OF YOUR YEARSOF EXPERIENCE WITH FABRIC, WHAT IS KIND OF YOUR BOTTOMLINE RESIDUE ABOUT THIS?Oh, I can't explain it. The only thing I can tell you about it is there are obviousheat damage to the fabric. Surprisingly, the polyester has melted and the cottonhas burned in some areas, but not all of them. It has the general shape, as yousay, of a body. I would be at a loss to explain how a body could have beenpresent in the amount of heat that was required to do the damage that you seehere and not suffer serious burns. So, from a scientific standpoint, that's prettymuch what I can tell you. I don't know exactly how this was done.IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE MORE STUDIES PEOPLE HAVE DONE ONTHIS, THAT WHAT EVER HAPPENED, IT HAD TO HAPPEN IN SECONDS,"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"NOT MINUTES.Yeah, the exposure of a particular area of the fabric has to occur very quickly.Can someone with a heat source start down here and spend twenty minutesdoing this? Perhaps, but the point is if you have a heat source that is intenseenough to melt the polyester and still not cause intense damage to the cotton, orat least not to some of the cotton, it has to move fairly quickly along thispattern. It either happens, the whole thing, all at once. Or it has to be verycarefully guided to get this effect without actually starting a fire of some kind.BECAUSE REALLY AT 500 DEGREES FAHRENHEIT AND WE HAVE TOBE SOMEWHERE IN THAT RANGE THAT KIND OF EXPOSURE TO THISPOLYESTER AND COTTON BLEND FOR MORE THAN SAY LIKE 2 OR 3MINUTES, YOU WOULD END UP WITH BLACK, CHARRED, PROBABLYTARRY...Oh, that kind of exposure, that kind of heat on this fabric, you're talking aboutno more than ten seconds in any one area, probably. Otherwise, you wouldignite it.YOU WOULD IGNITE IT INTO FIRE.Ye s .WHY ISN'T IT ALL BROWN OR ALL HALO-LIKE BLUE?Excellent question. I don't know. Why is this area which is presumably betweenthe shoulders of the individual, why is it essentially undamaged?RIGHT, THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.Was it some kind of an energy that did this that we don't know anything about? Idon't know the answer to that. I guess it's possible.\"Continued in Part 3.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
