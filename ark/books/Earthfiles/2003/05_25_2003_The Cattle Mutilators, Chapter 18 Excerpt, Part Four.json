Dalton (pseudonym)Manor Books, Inc., New York, New York(out of business since 1988.) The Meue replies to Dr. Brandon's speculation that the genetically engineeredalbino Meuemen would not have any consciousness about their origin andpurpose. Meue: \"That's right. They will be given the historical record of knowledge of avirtual unknown that has moved into another dimension. They will eat, sleepand live like everyone else. The only difference is the supreme Meue brain andthe lack of entity.\" \"You mean these things don't have a soul?\" Brandon asked, puzzled. \"But theyare born with human genes and chromosomes.\" \"They are synthesized in a laboratory, not born. You must be born to have entityor soul, as you call it.\" \"Then they're just flesh-and-blood robots.\" \"No, we have no control over them other than to receive their assessment ofearth's condition from their sleeping thoughts. They are truly human with aMeue nervous system and no soul or entity.\" \"You can't sit there and tell me the fate of the entire earth is going to depend onthose bastardized things out there,\" Brandon said, angrily waving his hand at thetanks containing the albinos. \"That's crazy as hell.\" \"There is no other way. Earth has reached a critical turning point in itsevolution. It's become an overcrowded, ravenous pack of rats, like thehypothetical case we talked about. Living within the populace, the nineMeuemen will logically be able to assess when the experiment should beterminated.\" \"Why send those things?\" Brandon yelled. \"It's your experiment; you watch it.\" \"We have since the beginning, but this emotion thing has brought the earth to astate that changes almost daily. At the beginning of the experiment, we returnedevery one or two hundred years to check on it. But now with all your nuclearstupidity, the earth is on the brink of disaster almost daily. We no longer havethe hope, or the time, to waste on the colony earth. But we do have the logicalresponsibility to terminate the suffering of the test humans when it becomesintolerable.\" \"I still don't see the purpose of having those things out there, then. You still haveto communicate.\" Brandon felt panicky and helpless. \"A pure evaluation and assessment as perceived through the logical Meue mind"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"from controlling positions in your society. We will not have to visit or lingeraround earth, waiting. Thoughts have no barriers and can be pulled throughtime, space and dimensions in an instant. We can be anywhere in the universe orwithin any plane or dimension and know what's taking place here.\" \"What if we don't want your logical responsibility for the experiment. What ifwe just want to be left alone to work it out for ourselves.\" Brandon felt hatecoupled with fear building inside him. \"You have no choice. We are the monitors of this experiment, as you are in yourlab. We will compile and assess the information logically. When the time comes,I will make the decision and it will be done faster than you could ever imagine.\" Brandon stared at the grotesque Meue hatefully. He thought of the words in theBible, \"in the twinkling of an eye.\" Could this be the God that everyone prays tofor help, who created the heavens and earth? He was sickened and filled withdespair. The Meue was right; no one would ever believe him, even if he did livethrough this and remember. The Meue knew nothing of emotion, just pure,unadulterated logic. He faced the Meue defiantly. \"You're wrong, absolutelywrong.\" The Meue's neck swept down again until the rubbery face was inches away. \"I'mnot wrong; everything I've told you is logical.\" \"That's the point. I told you the hope for earth was founded in emotion and incaring for the people. Emotion is a variable you know nothing about. Neverhaving felt it, how can you logically leave it out in the determination of thedestiny of earth? It's a variable you can't comprehend.\" The Meue's head lolled, his eyes closed slowly, then opened. Brandon'sreasoning had touched the inner workings of the Meue's mind. Then he spoke,\"It is true we know nothing of the emotion variable, but the universe is built onsound logic, abstract mathematics. Earth is the only planet that has emotion, andit is the only one where the inhabitants are nearing complete annihilation.\" \"Yes, emotion sometimes brings on critical situations, but it also resolves. It's avariable of action-reaction. Those things won't be any good for assessing thecondition of Earth.\" Brandon waved his hand at the tanked creatures. \"They willnever understand emotion. And not having lived among the inhabitants, theywill not have acquired it. How can they honestly assess people whose actionsare governed by emotion as much as by logic? Just leave us alone. We don't needthose bastards spying on us. I have a lot of hope for the earth and its people.\" The Meue remained silent for a long period of time, watching Brandon glare athim. \"You have much of this emotion yourself. We've also seen it in many of thetest humans we've encountered. Maybe this driving force can save the colonyearth. Only time will tell. But the Meuemen still must be planted among yourrace. We cannot rely on this strange phenomenon that we don't understand toprevent disaster. After all that you've told me, we are still responsible for whatwe've begun,\" the Meue replied logically and coldly. While Brandon had tried to show the weakness of the Meue transplants, thequestion of the experimenters' responsibility for earth's destiny couldn't bechallenged. The earth meant nothing to the Meue, other than a responsibility.Brandon tightened his fists into knots of anger. He took a deep breath, thenanother before speaking again. \"What would happen if those abortions out therestopped communicating with you, if you received no more messages from them?\"Brandon tried to suppress the underlying reason for the question, but it was notpossible. \"You would kill nine men with the status of Einstein or Christ because you don'tbelieve in their ability, nine brilliant leaders?\" The Meue stared unblinkingly atJerry."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"Every last one of them, yes, knowing that the fate of millions of people justtrying to live and be happy depended on those things. You're goddamned right Iwould!\" Brandon yelled. \"But you would surely be killed by other humans for destroying them.\" \"What difference does it make if I die trying, or if you blow it all to hell becausethey don't understand? I'll take my chances,\" Brandon snorted. The Meue's head retracted. The room fell silent. Brandon reached for acigarette, but they had been confiscated in the sterilization process. \"Damn,\" hegrowled, clasping his hands in his lap. After what seemed like an eternity, the Meue spoke. \"From my mind, I make nosense of what you wish to do or why you wish to do it, when we have taken somuch time to develop the Meueman for your protection and guidance. Youbelieve so strongly that I feel logically compelled to give you an alternative.\"The creature clasped his hands thoughtfully. \"By placing the Meueman on earth,we have filled our responsibilities as logical scientists. We will always have theircommunication of the data and as I promised, earth will be destroyed when thesituation becomes hopeless. However, you seem to believe the colony willsurvive without our intervening and it is possible, not logical, that you might becorrect. If you can succeed in destroying all nine Meumen, we will have nocommunication with earth and as I've told you, we will not pass this way again.\" Brandon smiled at the Meue, hoping he really understood the message. \"Youmean you would allow me to kill those things and you wouldn't do anything tostop me?\" he asked hesitatingly. \"That is correct. They have no entity. But remember this -\" the creature held hislong finger in front of Brandon's face - \"you are answering for the entire humanrace now, and future generations. If you succeed in destroying all nine, youmight see the day when you wish we were here to end it. Earth's fate will trulybe in the hands of its emotional inhabitants.\" \"By God, I'll do it. I know how everyone would feel. I...\" \"There is no decision to make now. What you decide can be done at any time. Ifyou should succeed and the colony continues, good or bad, it makes nodifference; earth takes little space in only one plane.\" \"Why have you told me all this?\" Brandon asked. \"Why not? By the time you're able to communicate the conversation to anyone,we will be gone and non one will believe you. And I believe I've learnedsomething from you, oddly enough.\" \"What are you going to do now?\" \"You will be rendered numb with this,\" the Meue held up a tiny silver cylinderthe size of a pencil, pointing a small aperture on the end at Brandon. A burst ofbrilliant light flared, striking Brandon high on the bridge of the nose. He couldsee and hear, but there was no feeling. \"The technician behind you will insert asubstance plug into the base of your skull and for a short period of time, youwill not be able to think or formulate words. By the end of two of your weeks,the plug will have become normal body tissue, leaving no scar, and you willreturn to normal, as you perceive it. \"I wish you luck, Dr. Brandon, in whatever you decide. I wish the colony Earthluck. I will look for you when you pass from your dimension and we willcommunicate again.\" End of Chapter 18 excerpt.
