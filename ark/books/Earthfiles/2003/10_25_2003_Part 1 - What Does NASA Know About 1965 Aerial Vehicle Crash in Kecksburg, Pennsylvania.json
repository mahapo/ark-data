Aerial photograph© 1998 by Stan Gordon Productions.October 25, 2003 Greensburg, Pennsylvania - In 2002, former President Bill Clinton'sChief of Staff, John Podesta, joined the Sci-Fi Channel in a request to the Bushadministration to release all documents it has on the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania \"UFO crash\"of December 9, 1965.Sci-Fi Channel President, Bonnie Hammer, says, \"Now, one year later, despite seriouseffort to uncover the facts, NASA and the Department of Defense are still maintaining theirwall of silence. Whether or not this has anything to do with UFOs - the public has the rightto know.\" With her statement, the Sci-Fi Channel also threatened to file a lawsuit againstNASA and other government agencies for documents about the Kecksburg event. Eventhough there were many Kecksburg eyewitnesses, for the past thirty-eight years NASA andthe U. S. government have remained silent about what was retrieved. On Friday, October 24, 2003, NASA agreed to turn over documents relating to the allegedcrash of a UFO in Kecksburg. According to the Sci-Fi Channel's website, \"NASA informedLee Helfrich, attorney for the Sci-Fi Channel-sponsored Coalition for Freedom ofInformation (CFI), that it is releasing 36 pages of documents,\" the Channel said. The release comes after ten months of pursuing the records through the Freedom ofInformation Act. The Department of Defense and the U.S. Army have yet to release anyrecords under similar requests, Sci-Fi said. “For more than four months we have received no response from NASA, but one day afterJohn Podesta, President Clinton's former chief of staff and member of the MoynihanCommission, and Bonnie Hammer, president of Sci-Fi Channel, called on government"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"agencies to make public records that are over 25 years old, lo and behold, NASAresponds,” Helfrich said in a statement. “I think it's fair to say that we have truly entered the realm of science fiction inWashington, D.C., when it's fair game to disclose the identity of a clandestine CIA agent,but not the records of an unexplained crash in Kecksburg, Pa., that occurred 38 years ago,”Podesta said at a news conference this week.Kecksburg Background:On Dec. 9, 1965, witnesses described seeing a fireball in the sky, a controlled landing andthe systematic military recovery of an object by individuals wearing NASA badges. Thisweek, I asked Pennsylvania UFO researcher, Stan Gordon, about eyewitness descriptionsof NASA's presence at the 1965 Kecksburg crash site. Stan has persisted for many yearstrying to get facts about what happened beginning at 4:47 p.m. on Thursday afternoon,December 9, 1965, in the small town southeast of Pittsburgh. He has interviewed dozens ofeyewitnesses, including people who saw NASA badges on the white overalls of men whoshowed up that night in Kecksburg and went to the crash site to retrieve the object.Witnesses claim to have seen a metallic acorn-shaped objectwith strange markings in the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania woods on December 9, 1965.Drawing by Charles Hanna © 1998 by Stan Gordon Productions.Interview:Stan Gordon, Electronics Technician, UFO Researcher and producer of the award-winning documentary, Kecksburg, The Untold Story, Greensburg, Pennsylvania:\"There are a number of people who mentioned to us that NASA personnel had beeninvolved in the NASA incident. Ron Hayes, who was a young boy at the time, it was hisfamily that was renting a small farm house very close to the vicinity of the impact site. Italked to several of the children who lived there at the time such as the mother and thefather who has been deceased for many years. But Ron very clearly remembers the eventsof that night because what really stuck out in his mind was the excitement of seeing themilitary and all the military vehicles coming in and out of his home that night.He did mention that at one particular time as he was going down the stairs, he heard aconversation that NASA was going to be arriving soon and that it wasn't too long after thathe heard a knock on the door and there was a man in a white coverall with a NASA insigniaon it.A number of different people described to us seeing men in white coveralls, some withwhat appeared to be some type of protective gear which is very possibly associated withNASA. One of the persons in particular was Bill Weaver who was on this lane with anumber of people in that evening who saw various types of activity. He was there whenthis large light colored box truck pulled up. Out of that box truck came four men in what hecalled 'moon suits.' They took a piece of equipment out that looked like a big box, possibly4 x 5 foot square, and carried it down on a stretcher towards the ravine.But there was also another family who had been involved in events who told me back yearsago that a NASA representative had come to visit them and interview them about theexperiences at that time. They indicated that a man spent a few days in the areainterviewing witnesses about the events of that time.So, that was just one reason why they (Sci-Fi Channel) went after the NASA information.They are looking at several other things with NASA. They were looking for any documentsconcerning Cosmos 1996, which was a Soviet Venus probe that we know re-entered theEarth's atmosphere about 3:18 a.m. that same morning (December 9, 1965), but in Canada.This (Kecksburg) happened about 4:47 p.m. in the afternoon.But there were a number of different things they were going after concerning NASAinformation and one of the things was something I showed you several years ago: adocument I had obtained. Something was unique, I believe, in the information on it. It waswhat was called the NASA Fragology files (fragments of space debris from a variety of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"sources) and it was an interesting document that turned up in I think 1994 when I had filedanother FOIA request with NASA concerning NASA's involvement and the recovery ofspace material. I was looking in particular for any type of involvement for any event theywould have been involved with in that time period, either in the United States or outside inother countries. Surprisingly, I got this document released by the NASA Historical Office.National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),Washington, D. C. 20544 document, classified \"Confidential\" and labeled\"NASA Fragology Files consisting of reports of space objects recovery, analysisof fragments to determine national ownership and vehicle origin. 1962-1967. Obtained byStan Gordon in 1994 response to one of his Freedom of Information Act requests. F 36 Moon Dust - KATOTO Estate line item stands out on the Fragology Fileslist because MOONDUST is defined in the July 26, 1973, Department of State Airgrambelow as, “a designator used in cases involving the examination of non-USspace objects or objects of unknown origin.”U. S. Department of State Airgram dated July 26, 1973, that includes paragraphbelow about \"MOONDUST.\" Source: U.F.O.s Are Real - Extraterrestrial EncountersDocumented by the U. S. Government © 1997 by U. S. Army (Ret.) Sergeant Clifford E. Stone."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Example of MOONDUST classification on an August 18, 1962,U. S. Air Force document that had been classified \"Confidential\"concerni ng \"Uni dentifi ed Fl yi ng Objects.\" Source: UFOs: Let the EvidenceSpeak for Itself © 1991 by U. S. Army (Ret.) Sergeant Clifford E. Stone. Just to make the story short, I went back in to request all the different files that werereportedly contained in the document I had. Basically after a long period of time with noresponse, the indication initially was that the documents had been destroyed. Then, later itwas clarified that they believed the records had been missing since 1987.As I recall in that document, there was a hand-written memo it still had, 'National RecordCenter 1994.' So that is something that also they have been looking deeper to find thoseother documents pertaining to the NASA Fragology files.IF SCI-FI ACTS LEGALLY AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE FIRSTHANDEXPERIENCE IF THEY SPEAK OUT, WOULDN'T THAT MAKE IT EVEN MOREDIFFICULT FOR THE U. S. GOVERNMENT TO WITHHOLD INFORMATION?I think this is the opportunity that in fact many of the eyewitnesses would be very hopefulfor this. While only a small number of the witnesses that I've interviewed have gone public,there are multitude of eyewitnesses that I have interviewed, have statements and/orinterviews on tape. Again, there is a lot of difference in the age factor. Some of thesepeople are getting older. But a lot of the eyewitnesses we're dealing with are young childrenor teenagers at the time. Many of these people remember the events very clearly. Many ofthese people have grown up and like to be professionals. We have executives of companies,school teachers, police officers, a lot of people with a wide variety of professionalbackgrounds. And these people are looking for the opportunity to tell the story under oathto tell the people what they saw. In fact, there are quite a lot of witnesses I talked to thathave good information on the case and while not having gone public at this point, have toldme they are more than willing to swear under oath about what they experienced on thatday on September 9, 1965.” Kecksburg Crashed Vehicle Takento Wright-Patterson AFB?According to two truck drivers that Stan Gordon interviewed, the Kecksburg crashed aerialvehicle was transported to Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio where the bell-shaped object anda lizard-skinned entity were contained within a solid brick building specifically constructedto contain the non-human physical evidence.Stan Gordon: \"The story is that this gentleman was a truck driver working for a largesupply house in Ohio at the time. He said that within a few days after the incident inPennsylvania, a Navy officer brought a special type of engineering brick into the supplyhouse. They ordered a large supply of the special engineering brick to be delivered toWright-Patterson AFB.Now, another truck driver has verified the story that he took in the first load of those bricksinto the base the day before Myron got there where they BOTH unloaded a truck load ofbricks. The other truck driver verified that when he got there the day before, there was aflatbed trailer. On that flatbed outside of this building, was a large tarpaulin-covered whathe described as a \"liberty bell,\" a bell-shaped object which he verified now."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Myron, a truck driver, delivered a load of bricks to Wright-PattersonAir Force Base in Ohio, and states that he saw a strange bell-shaped object beingexamined in a building that was being entirely bricked over. Drawing byCharles Hanna © 1998 by Stan Gordon Productions.The next day is when both he and Myron went to the base. They were told to stay aroundthe truck, not to go looking around, but to do their job. Myron was very curious because ofthe fact that he had these men in white covering with side arms and they were periodicallychanging their outer clothing. He was wondering what was going on inside the building. Hehad the opportunity when he thought the coast was clear to go and look inside thatbuilding. He saw up on scaffolding this bell-shaped object with ladders going up to it andthese men apparently climbing up ladders working on this thing trying to open it up.He claimed he got little bits of information from them, up to the point where they finallyrealized he didn't have the clearance to be there. Basically, he said he was threatened, hewas told that 'If you ever talk about what you saw, you'll be thrown in jail and you'll throwthe keys.' But in 20 years, this would all be public knowledge.What is intriguing is the fact that while I was filming interviews when I did my videodocumentary: Kecksburg, The Untold Story and I went to interview him, you could tell hewas in very bad health. He was on oxygen at the time. He told myself and the productioncrew - we were all very surprised that he revealed an aspect of the story he never toldbefore. And we asked him, 'Why are you telling us now?' And he said, 'I talked to my sonabout it and he asked me the same question and I told him that the situation I'm in, I mightnot be here tomorrow or the next day, so I'm going to tell it all about what I saw.'What he said he saw was the fact that the room was not very well-lit. There was thebell-shaped object up on the scaffolding. He said there was a work bench also inside thatsame room and all he could see was a body laying on the work bench. As I recall, he said itwas under 5 feet tall, he estimated, and was covered over with a light sheet. All he couldsee was the arm and three index fingers when we laid down from it. That's all he could see,but the skin looked kind of lizard-like to him. That was all he was able to see.SO, YOU'VE GOT TWO PEOPLE NOW MYRON AND THIS OTHER INDIVIDUAL AND THEY ARE BOTH BASICALLY TELLING THE SAME STORY?Except the first individual only saw the object OUTSIDE of the building on the flatbedtrailer the day before he and Myron went to the base. At that point, the object had beentaken inside the other warehouse off the base. What Myron said they were doing they gotthe exact color and type of brick that matched that building. His understanding was thatthey were going to build some type of protective shield and they were going to entomb theobject. They were building the bricks up inside the building to completely cover the objectinside the other building, so you wouldn't be able to see it.”To be continued in Part 2.Websites:http://www.westol.com/~paufo/kecks.htmlhttp://www.westol.com/~paufo/stan.htmlhttp://www.majesticdocuments.comhttp://www.presidentialufo.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Republication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
