Smith, Freedland Publishers Chapter 4, Part One -The UFO Mystery n June 24, 1947, Kenneth Arnold, an experienced mountain pilot, leftChehalis, Washington for Yakima. The flight took him over a part of theCascades he was as familiar with as his own living room. As he approached Mt.Ranier, he noticed a series of bright flashes off to one side and slightly belowhim. On closer inspection, they appeared to be nine very bright disc-shapedobjects. The objects, whatever they were, moved rapidly from north to south in areverse echelon formation, weaving in and out among the mountains with astrange oscillating and skipping type of flight. Since at one point, they passedbehind a peak, Arnold was able to estimate their size and speed. They had tohave been some twenty miles away, perhaps fifty feet in diameter, and moving atabout 1700 miles per hour. Since it is not unusual for people to see strange things in the sky, local newsmensaw this at first as just another interesting hoax. But the more they examined thestory, the more convinced they became that Arnold had really seen what he haddescribed to them. In any case, it struck the public fancy and was soon receivingnational and international publicity. A number of similar UFO reports beganflooding in from all over the United States and the \"flying saucer\" era was born. The U. S. Air Force was quite aware of these reports, many of them coming fromtheir own men. Within a month, the subject was under the very tightest securitywraps. Air Force intelligence had to know what was happening in American airspace. According to Edward J. Ruppelt, who was later put in charge of the AirForce investigation of UFOs, confusion surrounded the investigation; confusionalmost to the point of panic. The brass wanted to know the answer quickly, andpeople were taking off in all directions. (Report On UFOs © 1956 by Edward J.Ruppelt.) The Air Force, according to Ruppelt, had essentially two theories. Thephenomena were either earthly or unearthly. They could be Russian, or German,or from some other nation. They could even be a super secret U. S. project. Orthey could be interplanetary vehicles. Or even space animals of some kind. Themiracle of the atomic bomb was still fresh enough in everyone's mind to makeanything seem possible. At first, there was no doubt in the military mind that an all out investigationwould quickly get to the bottom of the mystery. Events have proved that not tobe true. Twenty-nine years and untold thousands of sightings later, the subject iseven more baffling than when it began, as far as the public is concerned. Still,decades of public experience with Air Force investigations, generalstonewalling, media apathy, official secrecy, cover-up, ignorance and appliedconfusion couldn't help but generate a few sparks of enlightenment. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"One of the most intriguing things about UFOs has been what seems an irrationalcompulsion to make them disappear. The official denials are far more interestingthan convincing. Why go to such ridiculous lengths to cover-up what is alreadynon-existent? Long before the author had any real idea what UFOs were or howthey were propelled, he was completely fascinated by the cover-up. When thereis such an elaborate smokescreen, there has to be a little fire somewhere. Whatis it about them that keeps making the authorities so nervous? In spite of the intense ridicule, misrepresentation and official pooh-poohing ofthe phenomenon, people are far from being convinced. It has been estimatedthat at least fifteen million Americans have seen UFOs and an overwhelmingmajority believe they exist. (Aliens In Our Skies © 1969 by John A. Fuller) Onecommon error is to imagine most reports come from UFO buffs. The fact is thatmost reports come from astonished skeptics - who become former skeptics. Theyrepresent every strata of society, especially upper, perhaps since those peopletend to take government protection for granted. Another error is to suppose thatonly Americans see them. Actually, the U. S. produces no more, and maybeless, reports per capita than other areas such as South America, Europe andAustralia, around the world. Nor are UFOs really new. During World War II, it was not uncommon for Alliedand Axis planes to be accompanied by unknowns that Americans dubbed \"foofighters.\" These were a small fireball type of apparition that flew in formationjust beyond the planes' wingtips, apparently to observe and obviously underintelligent control. Unidentifiable flying objects have been seen throughouthistory. Charles Fort (1874-1932), a tireless American chronicler ofunexplained events, had a special category for the strange airships seen byfarmers, milkmaids, above county fairs, cities and villages, by soldiers, sailors,astronomers and judges. In fact, all kinds of people in the most diverse situationssaw the airships. Many ancient and venerable documents and scriptures recordsimilar aerial phenomena. (The Works of Charles Fort © 1941, The ForteanSociety.) This is not the place to list sightings since a number of books and magazines areavailable that devote themselves almost exclusively to that. Objects of variousshapes, sizes and colors, alone and in formation, have been seen all over theglobe. They've been seen by military and commercial pilots and by astronauts. Infact, pilots who have logged lots of hours are almost sure to have seen strangeflying objects they could not identify. Military sightings are kept secret by aspecial regulation, while commercial pilots usually try to avoid the publicity andridicule unless the sighting has been especially spectacular or hair raising, orpassengers have been injured during violent evasive actions. A few sightings are especially memorable. For example, during an air show atLongview, Washington on July 3, 1949, a UFO was observed near a plane thatwas skywriting overhead. The crowd's attention was drawn to it through thepublic address system. During a period of twenty minutes, three successiveobjects fluttered over from different directions and were seen by the crowd,many using binoculars. (The Congressional Record, July 29, 1968, reported byDr. James A. Harder.) An interesting sighting was reported by a chemist near Yuma, Arizona. Whilewatching some aircraft in the sky, he also noticed a small moving cloud-likeobject. Through the polarized glasses he was wearing, he could see a series ofdark rings surrounding it. The outermost ring was about six times the diameter ofthe silvery UFO, or about the diameter of the full moon. He could see throughhis glasses, but not without them. Dr. James Harder, testifying before acongressional committee looking into UFOs, calculated from the Faraday effectthat in order to rotate the plane of polarization like that an electromagnetic fieldof at least a million gauss over a distance of 40 meters would be required. Afield of that size and intensity is hard to even imagine. (The CongressionalRecord, July 29, 1968, Dr. James A. Harder.) Another remarkable sighting comes from Russia. A joint civilian-military team"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"headed by Major Anton Kopeikin and environmental scientist Fydor Denidovreported to their government that 25 witnesses had seen a bluish green,oval-shaped object the size of a jetliner head east at tremendous speed, andsilently. Flying very low, the object struck a ridge, but continued on coursewithout slackening its speed, leaving a trench ten feet deep and fifty feet long inthe frozen ground, along with two smaller trenches. UFOs have also been seenplunging into the ocean at a terrific speed, only to re-emerge at the same speed. Let me present a recent sighting not because it is unusual, but because it is sotypical of thousands and perhaps hundreds of thousands of sightings the worldover. Also, it is firsthand, happening in late December of 1975 while this bookwas being written. Three of our youngest children and I had gone skating on anearby reservoir. The sky was perfectly clear and cloudless, the temperatureabout 20 degrees, the moon several days past full. About 11 p.m., we weregetting ready to leave. I was already at the car, walking back and forth on thehighway, skywatching and occasionally looking through binoculars. Suddenly, I noticed a strange light in the east, slightly north of the ecliptic andthree or four degrees above the horizon. What star could be there? I glanced upat Capella, which was still in its proper place. But this new object was nothinglike Capella. It was ruddy red like Mars, but far brighter. I called the others'attention to it. My older boy, a college physics major and properly skeptical,thought it might be Mars. But Mars was still in its right place, too, almostdirectly overhead not far from the moon. Then the red object began moving toward the northwest. We got in the car anddrove up a nearby hill to watch. it kept accelerating, getting higher, dimmer andprobably father away as we watched. All of us looked at it through our excellent7 x 50 binoculars, but that did not make it any less hazy. I signaled with aflashlight, but it might have been twenty miles away and there was no response.It seemed to be traveling in a perfectly straight line, passing seven or eightdegrees below Polaris, and then we finally lost sight of it somewhere along thecurving back to the constellation Draco. What was it? We did not know, although we watched it for maybe ten minutes.It appeared suddenly in the east and disappeared in the northwest, perfectlysilent, climbing and becoming dimmer as it went. It might never have been closerthan five or ten miles, but there was no way to accurately judge its distance. Weall agreed it could not have been a meteor, satellite or plane. Our youngest boy, 13, was enthusiastic about it being a UFO. What else could ithave been? As for myself, I'm interested as an amateur astronomer and am fairlyfamiliar with the sky, having observed it intently for years over hours at a time atnight. So I know there are strange and interesting things overhead and what wesaw was not easily identifiable as a natural phenomenon. It was not a secret withus, but like millions of people the world over, we knew reporting such acommon experience would have been ridiculous. It is sometimes thought that UFOs cannot be picked up on radar. Nothing couldbe farther from the truth. \"Angels\" and \"bogies\" are a constant problem to radaroperators. If the \"angel\" does not fit into the pre-programmed patterns ofaircraft, missile or satellite flight or trajectory calculations, it is automaticallyrejected and ignored. (The Congressional Record, July 29, 1968 by Dr. RobertL. Hall.) Perhaps the best known combined radar and visual sighting happened duringtwo long July 1952 nights over Washington, D. c. A number of fighter planeswere scrambled and several hundred interceptor chases were admitted to by theDirector of Air Force Intelligence, Major General John M. Sanford. It alsobecame apparent at that time that UFOs were monitoring militarycommunications. (Aliens from Space © 1973 by Major Donald E. Keyhoe.) In 1953, the Air Force began experimenting with a new type of long range radarequipment that immediately picked up a gigantic object orbiting the equator"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"about 600 miles out. Shortly thereafter, it moved in to 400 miles. (Aliens fromSpace © 1973 by Major Donald E. Keyhoe.) Even at that time, the ArgentineNavy and the U. S. Air Force are alleged to have had motion pictures of giantspace ships operating near the earth. The public has seen a number of UFOpictures. Some are fakes and most of them are indistinct. Many privateinvestigators believe \"the Air Force itself has thousands of photos of UFOs, butcan't release them because of government restrictions.\" (St. Paul Pioneer Press,St. Paul, Minn., April 21, 1975) Another common phenomenon that has been reported worldwide is a completefailure of automotive electrical systems in the presence of UFOs. Cars stall andtheir lights go out. Then everything returns to normal when the UFO leaves.Utility failures in private homes and in entire communities have also occurredwhile UFOs were in the neighborhood. Many believe the famous Northeastblackout of 1965 was UFO-caused, since UFOs and also strange \"fireballs\" wereseen at the time near Syracuse, New York where the trouble seems to haveoriginally developed.
