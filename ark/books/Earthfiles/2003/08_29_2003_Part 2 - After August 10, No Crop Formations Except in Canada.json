Very similar to the Gog Magog Hills \"angel\" formation belowdiscovered July 25, 2001, southeast of Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England. \"Disturbinghumming sound\" was reported by people living near the field in Belgium.So, on August 10, many of us were trying to decide where we should do nightwatches that night and on August 11th when cell phones began to ringannouncing the discovery of a new, large formation. It was 750 feet in diameterin wheat between Morgan's Hill and Cherhill Down directly east of the fourburial mounds and 11-concentric-ring formation that had astonished everyoneback on July 6 in North Down. From the air, the new pattern contained 61circles that alternated dark and light: the light was flattened crop and the darkwas standing. The circles created a 3-dimensional object that had three branchesthat resembled a hexagonal-structured molecule."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Large \"molecule\" formation reported August 10, 2003, spanningapproximately 750 feet in a wheat field directly east of the July 6, 2003, 11-concentric-ringformation. Aerial photograph © 2003 by Mark Fussell, cropcircleconnector.Since it was August 10th with at least five more days of the typical British cropcircle season to go - everyone said the \"molecule\" could not be the last one.Another big one would certainly come down somewhere else in the Vale ofPewsey. But now it is August 29th, and crop circle researchers are puzzled bythe fact that not a single other formation was reported anywhere in England orEurope after August 10th. But after that date, crop patterns have been reportedin Burlington, North Dakota near Minot, and Canada. Burlington, North Dakota Barley Formation, August 11, 2003Farmer Delos Haugen from Burlington, North Dakota near Minot, was runninghis swathing tractor in his barley field on August 11th when he ran right throughthe edge of a circle. He was so shocked to see his barley laid down flat andswirled so perfectly clockwise that he called his girlfriend, Donna (last namewithheld at her request) to come see for herself. She road back out with Deloson the swather and talked to me this week about what they saw."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Pictogram in barley about 130 feet long on farm ownedby Delos Haugen in Burlington near Minot, North Dakota.

I believe there are six circles. The barley was laying down. Itwasn't broke. It was laying down, really flat, it wasn't sticking up. Althoughthere was a sunflower stalk in the middle sticking up. I don't know what causesit.WERE THE PLANTS LAID DOWN CIRCLING IN ANY PARTICULARDIRECTION THAT YOU REMEMBER?Yes, they were all clockwise. And there is like four circles in a straight line andthen two off the side of that. But the paths that go to the other circles wereabout 2 feet wide, they were laid down before the outside circles.AND YOU KNOW THAT BECAUSE?Because we looked at it and the barley where the straight patches were waslaying underneath the stuff that was twisted clockwise.OH, I SEE WHAT YOU MEAN, THAT THE CORRIDORS WERE LAIDDOWN UNDERNEATH THE CLOCKWISE LAID CIRCLES ON TOP OFTHEM.Correct.HAD ANY OF YOU HEARD ANYTHING UNUSUAL LEADING UP TO"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"AUGUST 11?We talked to one of the neighbors who said his dog was barking and he saidnormally he would go out and shoot off the gun and the dog would stop becauseit was just animals in the yard. But he said that he was out there and shot thegun off and the gun would not stop. It barked all night.\" Seventeen Crop Formations in Canada as of August 29, 2003Geographic triangular pattern of crop formations: Minot, North Dakota,Boissevain, Manitoba, and Canada's longtime crop formation hotspot, Estevan,Saskatchewan.Not very far north of Minot, North Dakota over the border into Canada isEstevan, Saskatchewan - a Canadian hot spot for crop formations over the years.In fact, on August 15th, a circle was found at Steelman, Saskatchewan andtoday, a dumbbell of two circles connected by a pathway was reported in wheatin Boissevain, Manitoba. Paul Anderson, Director of the Canadian Crop CircleNetwork (CCCRN), points out that on a map Minot, North Dakota, Boissevain,Manitoba and Steelman, Saskatchewan form a near-perfect triangle not far fromEstevan.I asked Paul today about the sudden stop of crop formations in the world sinceAugust 10th, except for Minot and Canada.Paul Anderson, Director, Canadian Crop Circle Research Network,Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada: \"I went looking through all thedifferent archives I have for all these different countries, even for ones in Polandand Switzerland and countries like that, and I can't find any reports of anycountry that I could find any way for after the 9th or 10th of August... We werestill getting them after that date. We were getting reports almost every day. So,I'm not certain what to make of that.LET'S TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FACT THAT IN CANADA DURINGTHIS TIME THAT EVERYTHING SEEMED TO STOP IN ENGLAND SOSURPRISINGLY AFTER AUGUST 10, BUT KEPT GOING IN ENGLAND,THAT YOU HAVE HAD SOME VERY LARGE PATTERNS THAT HAVEBEEN VERY SIMILAR TO PICTOGRAMS IN ENGLAND EARLIER IN THE1990S.Yes. It was surprising. A couple two formations in particular in Ontario werequite similar to the early pictogram type formations in England, which issomething that we talked about before. So that was kind of an interesting start tothe year, of course. And then as we got into Saskatchewan later in August, therewas that large formation just over 400 feet in length near that tiny outpost ofRevenue, Saskatchewan, which is just west of Saskatoon. And that one from theaerial photographs looked gorgeous. For a Canadian one in particular, thegeometry looks very good. And it was huge! Longer than a football field and thegeometry was something we haven't seen before either. But again similar to earlypictograms in Europe."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Large pictogram measured at 439 feet in length reported in Revenue,Saskatchewan on August 8, 2003 in wheat. Aerial photograph © 2003 by Brent Latumus.Section of downed and standing wheat plants in Revenue, Saskatchewan formation.Ground photograph © 2003 by Dennis Eklund, CCCRN.COULD YOU GO OVER SOME OF THE DIMENSIONS AGAIN IN TERMSOF THE LENGTH AND SOME OF THE OTHER MEASUREMENTS THATHAVE BEEN MADE?The overall length was just over 439 feet. One of the components that was kindof unusual were the nested rings. That's something we haven't seen before threethin rings nested together like concentric, but offset. So, they are like heavytoward one side, kind of like a warped bull's eye. That's something we haven'tseen before. The whole formation was something we haven't seen before.And there have been reports since that one. But that one is still the largest Ithink it is the largest on record in Canada.DID ANYONE ANYWHERE AROUND THAT REVENUE FORMATIONREPORT ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THE SKY DAY OR NIGHT, ORSOUND?The only thing I did hear was that the farmer reported that his dog was acting upabout the time they think it happened. As you know, that's something we hearquite commonly.WHEN PEOPLE INVESTIGATED THE BIG PICTOGRAM AT REVENUE,DID THEY FIND ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THE PLANTS?In terms of lay patterns, the lay itself was pretty standard, not too complex withmultiple layering or things like that. What was found by our coordinator and herassistant they found quite a few stalks that were bent at 90 degrees at some ofthe nodes."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Somatic developmental abnormalities in looping and twisted stemsbetween seed head and first growth node found throughout the Revenue, Saskatchewanwheat formation reported on August 8, 2003. Photograph by Dennis Eklund, CCCRN.But they also did find the twisted stem affect where the stem as you talked aboutbefore, twisted, almost knotted, just below the seed head. They did find quite afew of those in the Revenue formation. I find that is quite interesting.I THINK THAT IS EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE BIOPHYSICISTW. C. LEVENGOOD SAYS YOU COULD NOT HAVE THAT KIND OFSOMATIC CHANGE UNLESS THERE HAD BEEN ENERGY INTERACTINGWITH THOSE CELLS A FEW WEEKS BEFORE THE FORMATION.That's correct. We did find that also in two or three of the other formations thisyear, including Wallacetown, Ontario. Before we've only found that one timebefore at Mooseman, Saskatchewan in 2000. And now this year, we have foundthat affect in two or three formations.\"We b s it e s :http://www.cccrn.cahttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://home.clara.net/lucy pringlehttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.bertjanssen.nlhttp://www.invisiblecircle.de and http://www.invisiblecircle.org/ser/d-archiv-2003.htmlhttp://www.kornkreise.chhttp://www.heramagazine.nethttp://www.cropcirclenews.comhttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmhttp://www.bltresearch.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
