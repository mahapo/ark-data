To render imperfect by damaging or excising a part.\" -American Heritage DictionaryBroken radius and ulna bones in a California Brown Pelican's wing.Photograph provided by Karen Benzel, International BirdRescue Research Center, Fairfield, California.January 18, 2003 Fairfield, California - Since the 1980s, along the PacificCoast from Oregon to California, brown pelicans have been found with eithertheir upper beaks cut off or wing bones cut. Holes have also been cut out insome of the birds' food pouches and behind their eyes, without blood. Wildlifeexperts are puzzled and upset since the California Brown Pelican has been onthe Federal Endangered Species list since the 1970s after the pesticide DDTkilled off so many of the ocean birds.The most recent cycle of mutilated birds began around Christmas time and havecontinued to this week. The International Bird Rescue Research Center inFairfield, California, has retrieved fourteen of the dead, or dying, birds and sentthe bodies to the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Law Enforcement Division fornecropsies at their Medford, Oregon laboratory. It is hoped that the pathologistscan determine specific causes of deaths and other details about how the viciouswounds were made. This week I talked with the Bird Rescue Center's Director,Jay Holcomb.Interview:Jay Holcomb, Director, International Bird Rescue Research Center,Fairfield, California:\"We started receiving calls in the week around Christmas time of a number ofdead pelicans in the harbor, in the Long Beach Harbor near Cabrillo Beach,which is where the large breakwaters are that the pelicans spend a lot of timeroosting and feeding. When our staff at our rehabilitation facility in San Pedro,which is adjacent to Long Beach, went to check it out, they found a number ofpelicans had holes in them, that looked to be shot based on just the appearance.Also, these birds had been feeding. They had a lot of fish in their pouches andwere healthy birds that had died immediately by whatever these wounds werecaused by. So, we picked those up and took them to the U. S. Fish and Wildlife"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Service who immediately started an investigation.In the weeks following, we have managed to find more birds with holes in themand birds with severely crushed wings. I don't mean just broken wings. We dooccasionally get birds with broken wings. These are pretty much crushed. Theseare big healthy birds that are in good condition and then come to shore with aseverely injured wing that can only be done to them by someone hurting them.Dead California Brown Pelican with its wing radius and ulna bones broken in two.Photograph provided by Karen Benzel, IBRRC.AND THE BEAKS?In this situation, none have been cut. They are all fine. It's really the wings andthe holes.THE UPPER BEAK WAS CLEANLY CUT OFF IN OREGON LAST YEAR?Right, Oregon last year, the beaks were cut off. And actually, in the 1980s, therewas another incident in California where beaks were also cut off.ON THESE HOLES, HAS ANYBODY RETRIEVED ANY BULLETS?As far as I know, no bullets have been retrieved. The Fish and Wildlife Servicehave taken the bodies to their forensic lab in Medford, Oregon. I know they arelooking at them, but I don't have any reports.WAS THEIR ANY BLOOD AROUND ANY OF THE HOLES?They were pretty clean. The birds were floating in the water, so it's hard it'swashed away by the ocean. However, the broken wings were very blood, ofcourse.IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE PHYSICAL EVIDENCE THATSUGGESTS HOW THE WINGS WERE CRUSHED?It's hard to say how they were done, but it's the radius and ulna bones. If youlook at your forearm, there are two bones that go down your forearm. Thepelicans have the same thing. They hold their wings to their sides. The break onall of them is usually four or five inches wide, so the bones are literallyshattered.What happens with birds is that once they've had an injury like this, they don'tjust sit there and hold it like we would. They try to fly. They start flapping andin doing that, they rip their muscles and tendons and do even more damage to it."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"It was pretty much severely smashed up by the time we got the birds.IT'S SO BAFFLINGLY EVIL, AWFUL TO ME, THAT WHATEVER COULDPERPETRATE THIS IS BEYOND MY COMPREHENSION.Yeah, we pretty much feel the same way, too. Why would you hurt an animalthat causes humans no harm and is just trying to survive in its world. Peoplewho do this are pretty unconscious and cruel and we are hopeful some evidencecomes up so we can find whoever did this.IN OREGON, DID THEY EVER ARREST OR ARRAIGN ANYONE?My understanding is that they have not found anyone. I would talk to the U. S.Wildlife Service to confirm that, but I haven't heard of anything.IN YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL BIRD RESCUECENTER, WHAT REASONS DO YOU FIND THAT PEOPLE WOULD HURTBIRDS?Well, you know, it's interesting. what I've found with my years of working withthe public and wildlife rehabilitation is that almost every species of animal tosomebody can become a pest. We've seen people in Alaska complain becausethe eagles are sitting on their building and their droppings were affecting them.You and I would think, \"Oh, my God, an eagle on my house would bewonderful!\"But people it's what becomes common in their area. So, in a case like SouthernCalifornia and the California coast and all the way up to Oregon, BrownPelicans even though they are still an endangered species have made anincredible come back and their are a lot of them. And when the fish schools arein and the pelicans are feeding, there are literally thousands of pelicans there.Pelicans are really incredible animals and like many, like gulls and other birds,they are very opportunistic. Their whole life is about competing for fish andfinding fish and being aggressive about it. That's why they are good hunters andwhy they are designed to be able to catch fish. What they've learned to do is tofigure out that fishing boats, commercial fishing fleets, nets and peoplesometimes with fishing lines sometimes mean free fish. They don't understandwe want the fish and it's not theirs. They think everything is theirs because theirminds do not have those limitations. The ocean is just their smorgasbord, so tospeak. So, what they do is they start to become a pest to some people. We'veactually seen them people sitting on the rocks fishing, pulling in their line, andhaving a pelican fly in and grab the fish off the line and pull it. People get angryat that.Actually in Long Beach Harbor where this is happening, we've seen fishing boatscome in early in the morning, the commercial fishermen that have been usinglarge nets to get herring and sardines and anchovies out at sea they will come inand the pelicans are swarming their boats trying to get loose fish that are fallingthrough the nets and so on. Literally it is like a cloud of pelicans. Sometimesbirds are sitting all over the bait docks just waiting for fish. They will becomevery aggressive about it.We know from the past that people have complained about them that they arepests and in the way and they don't want them around. However, we wouldnever assume that responsible fishermen would do anything like this. I knowthat wouldn't happen, but sometimes I think these animals become such a pestthat people get angry with them. We have seen and heard that over the years.That's one way this particular beautiful animal can be an annoyance.IT'S IRONIC, ISN'T IT, BECAUSE IT WAS IN THE 1970S THAT THECALIFORNIA BROWN PELICAN WAS DECLARED AN ENDANGEREDSPECIES ON THE FEDERAL LIST BECAUSE SO MUCH OF THE BIRDSWERE ELIMINATED BY DDT.Yeah, it's interesting. They are really sensitive birds. Even though there are a lotof them out there sometimes it looks like they are everywhere. But, they are very"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"sensitive animals. They are sensitive to problems in our environment. DDT is thebest example. Also, oil spills and other instances. Last year in SouthernCalifornia, we had many pelicans come to our center that were experiencingpoisoning from demoic acid which has to do with the algae growth (diatoms ofthe genus Pseudonitzschia) sometimes in warm currents. These animals hadcentral nervous system problems and we treated and released quite a few ofthem. Many of them died. It hit their population really hard. So, these are thingsthat happen to these animals. And the last thing we need is for these nice,healthy birds to be killed by someone.AND IN SUCH A HORRIBLE MANNER.Oh, yeah, it's absolutely ridiculous.WE SHOULD BE REJOICING THAT THE BROWN PELICAN HAS BEGUNTO FLOURISH AGAIN BECAUSE IN A WAY THEY ARE LIKE A CANARYIN A BIRD CAGE IN A COAL MINE SETTING OFF ALARMS IF THERE ISSOMETHING AMISS IN THE ENVIRONMENT.That's a beautiful analogy. That's exactly what they are like. Pelicans are knownfor that they are birds that are called \"indicator species.\" When something isgoing on with the pelicans, because they are high on the food chain out in theocean, you know there is something wrong with the environment.And I think that they are indicating right now there is something wrong with oursociety if we are actually killing birds, innocent animals, in a horrible way likethis.\"Healthy California Brown Pelican.Photograph provided by Karen Benzel, IBRRC.More Information:If anyone sees suspicious behavior around birds along the Pacific coast, JayHolcomb says to call:U.S. Wildlife Service Law Enforcement Division: 310-328-1516If residents in the Long Beach Harbor area see anything suspicious, or find deador injured birds,International Bird Rescue Research Center's local phone number there is: 310-514-2573 We b s it e s :"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"http://www.ibrrc.org/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
