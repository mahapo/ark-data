The rising bulgeis under the northern rim of the caldera about 15 miles from Yellowstone Lake's Mary Bay. December 12, 2003 Yellowstone National Park - This past week in SanFrancisco, the American Geophysical Union (AGU) had its Fall meeting whichincluded two dozen presentations about research concerning YellowstoneNational Park. Yellowstone is an active volcano and the world's largestconcentration of thermal features. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Yellowstone National Park's Frying Pan Geysers. Photograph courtesy USGS. The heat comes from the volcano that created the current geography of the park640,000 years ago after a gigantic eruption. Yellowstone volcanic eruptions haveoccurred in the past 2.1 million years ago; 1.3 million years ago, then 640,000years ago. Some scientists wonder if the volcano is overdue for anotherexplosion? Or is it perhaps headed for quiet extinction?There were several scientific papers at the Geophysical Union meeting thatfocused on thermal and land deformation changes in Yellowstone. Satelliteradar images confirm a large area of uplift, about 30 by 40 kilometers, or 19 x25 miles, which is centered under the north rim of the Yellowstone caldera.Geologists call it the Norris Uplift Anomaly, which began raising up in 1997 afew millimeters a year.Writing about the bulge, United States Geological Survey scientists appearingbefore for the American Geophysical Union spoke about: \"Stress Transfer,Thermal Unrest, and Implications for Seismic Hazards Associated with theNorris Uplift Anomaly in Yellowstone National Park.\"These are their words (see AGU website below):\"The spring and summer of 2003 has been a time of vigorous thermalunrest in the Norris Uplift Anomaly... Unrest began with the eruption ofSteamboat Geyser in May 2000, and has intensified in the 2003 spring andsummer with the eruption of Porkchop Geyser on July 16, which had beendormant since 1989. From April 1 through July 1, 2003, the temperatureof waters in Porkshop's vent increased continuously.Steamboat Geyser's steam eruptions became more intensein the summer of 2003.

This year, the 'Norris disturbance' beganaround July 11, 2003, when pronounced changes were noted, includingthermal pools that were boiled to dryness, creating fumaroles. \"The National Park Service has closed some footpaths in the geyser basinowing to near-boiling ground temperatures. The uplift has also led to anincrease in seismic hazard potential in the area of uplift.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"July 25, 2003, new thermal feature at Norris Geyser Basin © 2003 by C. Jaworowski.Other USGS research this year was conducted by geologist Lisa Morgan whotook a team underwater at Mary Bay in Yellowstone Lake. Mary Bay wasapparently created 13,000 years ago when a gigantic steam explosion ejectedrocks and gas all around the area. Nearby at the bottom of the lake itself, there iswhat park geologists call a \"structural dome\" that is 2100 feet across and 100feet high. Is the dome an indication of more building pressure below the lakethat could blow like it did 13,000 years ago? Dr. Morgan thinks the dome isstatic, but in Mary Bay her diving team reported 250 thermal vents, fissures,geyser basins and 30-foot-high columns of silica.What is happening at Yellowstone? Could all the hot temperature changes, newsteam and water eruptions, and large land bulge be related? Are they precursorsto a big steam, or water, or carbon dioxide, or lava eruption that might becoming?I talked about these questions on December 11th with Hank Heasler, Ph. D.,Supervisory Geologist for Yellowstone National Park in Yellowstone.Interview:Hank Heasler, Ph.D., Supervisory Geologist, Yellowstone National Park,Wyoming: \"You're right it's all related because it is caused by the heat from theYellowstone volcano as far as this bulge and all the hydrothermal features, allthe hot springs geysers, mud pots and steam vents in Yellowstone, are the resultof the volcanic forces. Does this signify an imminent danger?We don't believe so because there are things that you analyze and look for toindicate any sort of imminent hazard that is getting ready to occur.LIKE WHAT?Let's go through the process and see if you can tell me. If we started having avast amount, cubic miles of molten rock starting to move to the surface of theearth, what do you think might happen?PROBABLY SEISMIC EVENTS.You've got it. That's our number one indicator. And they would not be minorseismic events. These would be seismic events in the 5 to 6 magnitude (RichterScale). Basically people in Yellowstone can feel seismic events that begin about3, so by the time they are up to magnitude 5 or so, the tremors can be felt 100times easier.If we have a lot of molten rock forcing its way up to the surface of the earth, asthe rock moves up, there will be some fairly significant earthquakes.Then if it got to the point that we were having felt swarms of earthquakes, we"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"would focus in a lot, the next thing would be ground deformation, ground upliftor subsidence. Do we see highly unusual patterns of that? That would then tendto focus in on perhaps the scale of the eruption and whether it would be a small,local event? Or perhaps bigger? Then from there, we would look at chemistryand temperatures.AND NONE OF THESE THINGS THAT YOU HAVE JUST OUTLINED HAVEOCCURRED IN 2003?None. In fact, last year in 2002, we had some interesting earthquake swarmsaround Grant Village and progressing from Grant Village toward the calderaboundary that were fascinating scientific-wise. We haven't had any such swarmsthis year.We've had one magnitude 4.4 earthquake that's been the strongest earthquake.So, the seismic action is at or below background levels for Yellowstone.AND THE LAST BIG ERUPTION OF THE YELLOWSTONE VOLCANOWAS 640,000 YEARS AGO. IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT NEITHER YOU NORANY GEOLOGIST EXISTING ON THE PLANET TODAY KNOWS IF WEARE NOW AT ANOTHER POINT WHERE IF THERE IS SOMETHING LIKETHIS 640,000 CYCLE, THAT WE COULD BE MOVING INTO A PERIODWHERE IT COULD BLOW AGAIN?I think that's a fair statement. You're right in your statement that Yellowstone is avery, very active volcano. I think a main question that comes up: Is it somethingto be feared? I don't think it's something to be feared, but it's something we needto be aware of and keep our finger on the pulse of.Now, if you want to start playing the odds game the most likely type of volcaniceruption would be just a simple lava flow. We've had 30 of those since 640,000years ago and those definitely, if they flow over a road, affect travel. But theydon't affect anything regionally. They are just very local, like in Hawaii,depending on the type of lava flow.SO BOTTOM LINE AS A GEOLOGIST WHO WORKS AND LIVES INYELLOWSTONE PARK, YOU ARE NOT CONCERNED ABOUT THEREBEING SOME KIND OF GEOTHERMAL OR VOLCANIC EVENT ANYTIME SOON?That's it exactly. Now, am I diligent and do I keep aware? Constantly. That's myjob.And sometimes do we have calls at 1:30 in the morning because something looksinteresting and peaks our curiosity as a scientist? Yes. But have any of those thengone on to indicate major changes? No.\"More Information:What about that big bulge under the north side of the Yellowstone caldera thathas been rising a few millimeters each year since 1997?Professor Bob Smith at the University of Utah and his students reported at theAmerican Geophysical Union meeting that they have done seismic tomographicimaging of the bulge which covers 19 x 25 miles. Their seismic velocity datasuggest there is leakage of gas, maybe carbon dioxide, causing some of theground to lift. There is a possibility that there might be some magma movement,but the seismic tomography shows magma only in small amounts under theMallard Lake and Sour Creek resurgent domes in Yellowstone. The Universityof Utah data suggests that 90% of the large bulge is solidified. Anotherpossibility for the slowly rising bulge could be superheated water movingunderground.We b s it e s :"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/yvo/2003norris.html (U. S.
