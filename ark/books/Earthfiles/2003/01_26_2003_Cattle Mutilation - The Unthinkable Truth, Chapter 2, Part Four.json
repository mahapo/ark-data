Smith, Freedland Publishers Chapter 2, Part FourBlueprint for Confusion yes are also an interesting item. Birds take them out quickly and cleanly.When birds take out the eyeballs, however, they leave the lids. Mutilators notonly take the lids, they almost invariably take a perfectly round patch of skinfrom around the eye also. Furthermore, eyeballs are socketed in a succulent padof fat. The predator that takes an eyeball is even more interested in that pad offat. But in mutilations, that fatty pad is not taken. (The Denver Post, September29, 1975, quoting Dr. A. E. McChesney, a veterinarian and pathologist in theColorado State University lab where post mortems were done on mutilatedanimals.)

How can anyone tell the difference between predator damage and the surgicallyprecise work of the phantom mutilators? Stockmen and sheriffs think they canimmediately see the differences between that fantastically precise workmanshipand the chewing, ripping and tearing predator damage that most of them haveseen dozens or maybe even hundreds of times before. During the summer (of1975) while the Colorado Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was still very naive andhonestly perplexed about what was going on here, the \"experts\" were sayingthat, too. The best way to tell predator damage from a man-made mutilation isby simple visual observation. But after they had gotten together with the authorities in other states that hadgone through the same experience a year or so earlier, and had a better ideawhat the score was, the story began to change. They became a lot less naive andbegan saying the only way to tell the difference was by a close microscopicexamination. (The Rocky Mountain News, Denver, Colorado, August 10, 1975,and The Billings Gazette, September 12, 1975.) For one thing, not many farmers or ranchers have expensive microscopes and are"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"expert at using them. The final verdict in these important matters must beremoved as far as possible from the plain speaking amateur and placed in therealm of the professionals, who always know which side their bread is butteredon, and who butters it for them. In order to get a better control of the situation, the CBI began using its ownlaboratory to examine \"hide and tissue samples from 36 reported mutilatedanimals and found only two cases in which cuts had been made with sharpinstruments,\" Whiteside said. \"The damage in the other cases was done bypredators,\" the lab men say.

By doing a little lab work of their own, they were able to undercut and disputethe findings of the Colorado State University Large Animal Pathology Lab at Ft.Collins, where the pathologists doing the actual carcass examinations areundoubtedly competent, conscientious and honest men. The reader might be interested to know the inside story of one of those 36 hideand tissue samples the CBI allegedly examined. One sheriff and his deputieswere sure they were being told bedtime tales by the CBI. So, they decided tofind out. They submitted a sample of hide and tissue they themselves had verycarefully cut from a carcass. The report came back that a fox had done it. Notonly had the teeth marks showed up under the microscope, but also a distal hairfrom a fox had been found on the specimen. The amazing thing to the sheriff'sdepartment, and to that entire community, was that no one had seen a fox therefor twenty years. After having said all this, it must also in all honesty be said that the CBI and theofficial investigating bodies of several other states that have looked into thecattle mutilation phenomenon are probably right and the ranchers and sheriffsare probably wrong in their determination that \"sharp instruments\" have or havenot been used on mutilated carcasses. It is very doubtful that scalpels or anykind of sharp bladed instruments were used. In fact, we can almost be certainthey were not used. There's a story in scripture, Acts, 12:6-10, that throws a little light on this. Weare told that St. Peter had been thrown into prison, and a lot of good peoplewere praying for his release. Then we are told that during the night as Peter wassleeping between two soldiers, chained to each of them, a man came and wokehim up. \"Come quickly,\" he said, \"get dressed and put on your shoes.\" And weread that: \"The chains fell from his hands.\" Then the man led him outside andleft. The point for us to consider is how the chains were made to fall from his hands.Did the man say, \"Hocus pocus ali kazam?\" Of course, many people will say thatreally did not happen and that cattle mutilations did not really happen, either."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Behind every \"miracle\" is a technique. Did the man use a knife or a scalpel tocut off those iron manacles? He surely had some other technique, probably asmall instrument no larger than a knife to slice through those irons so easily. So, when the CBI and other authoritative bodies say their microscopicexamination of the cuts make them appear to be teeth marks rather than blademarks, we can believe they are telling the truth. The instrument that made themprobably cut by means of vibrations and might leave edges that appear serratedunder a microscope. We can't really believe the mutilators use scalpels or knivesof any kind. Even in the most skillful hands, knives and scalpels could not dowhat many have seen done in those cases. It had to be \"something better thananything we've got on this earth; something we don't know about.\" (CapitolTi mes, Madison, Wisconsin, March 12, 1975.) Colorado Bureau of Investigation, Denver CBI headquarters is a plain white unpretentious building in south Denver. Thereceptionist asked my name and business. I answered, \"I research cattlemutilations.\" She disappeared into an inner office. In a few minutes a tall,impeccably groomed man came out and beckoned me into his inner sanctum, abright comfortably carpeted place where he sat down behind his perfectly cleandesk and I in front. He crossed his legs easily and fondled his pipe with a faraway thoughtful look in his eyes. He could have been a CIA agent unobtrusivelyattached to some foreign embassy, a graduate from Harvard or Yale with hisname in the social register. We talked briefly of predators and he reminded me that commissions in otherstates had come to the same conclusion they had, that mutilations were almostall predator-caused. I told him I was especially interested in the buffalo deathsat the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo. He was without doubt a well-trained sleuth,sizing me up word by word. A coyote was seen feeding on one of the carcasses,he said, which I had already heard. Then we discussed helicopter sightings and their alleged harassment of ranchfamilies. He was fully aware of the Ft. Carson soldiers who touched down andfound themselves facing a row of drawn guns, and supplied details I had notknown. Everything I brought up he knew about. He was not dumb, far from it.The helicopter sightings all had a simple explanation in his view. Men training atFt. Carson have to put in so many flying hours. So, they were in the skies a lot.Soldiers have chased girls from time immemorial, on foot, horseback, helicopteror by any other means available. \"If I asked the commanding officer, he wouldnot say that,\" I said. \"Of course not,\" he replied. \"He would not say that if Iasked him, either.\" There was a lot of truth to what he said about helicoptersthat had not occurred to me before. I had not expected to learn much there, but it would have been foolish to avoidCBI. The important thing was to get the feel of the place. Also, I'd read they hada map pinpointing all the reported mutilations. That's the one thing they had thatI really wanted to see. I asked, but there seemed a little reluctance aboutshowing it. \"Is it secret?\" \"No,\" he replied, \"it's just that it's in an office that'sbusy now.\" I told him I was willing to wait. It was only a minute or so till we were standing before a map of Colorado on thewall behind the chief's desk. It was about the size of a common road map andstuck with various colored pins. I could see at a glance that it was not the sort ofthing that interested me. A political map in every sense of the term, a differentcolored pin for the several counties. What I had hoped to see was the pattern themutilations had been following. Next, I looked for those mutilations that had occurred in the most interestingplaces, the ones at NORAD, Cheyenne Mountain Zoo and in the nearby town ofFountain, also the two mutilated cows that had been left at the Rocky Flats'gate, the only reported cases in all of Jefferson County. They were not even"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"marked. But the disappointment and disgust on my face must have beenobserved by my companion. \"They are marked by counties,\" he said, looking as closely at me as I waslooking at their map. That only took a minute. I thanked him for his time andcourtesy. \"I think cattle mutilations are a lot more interesting than you'd like tolet on,\" I told him. \"Maybe so,\" he said, shrugging his shoulders as though it wasa free country for anyone to think whatever he cared to. But it was all a put-onthat I did not buy for a second. Without doubt, every room there was bugged. - Continued in Chapter 3, Part One: Bounty On Devil WorshipersCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
