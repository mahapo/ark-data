Pole image© 2003 by Robert Boerman, www.dcca.nl. July 11, 2003 Oss, Noord Brabant, Holland and see Update below - TodayRobert Boerman of the Dutch Crop Circle Archive e-mailed me about the fifthreported Dutch formation of 2003 in Oss that he investigated yesterday west ofGroesbeek. The circle nearest the camera measured about 15 meters.10, or fiftyfeet in diameter; the largest middle circle measured about 25 meters.70, oreighty-five feet; and the furthest smaller circle measured about 9 meters.90, orabout thirty-three feet in diameter.Based on an eyewitness, the triple circle pattern must have formed some timeafter 9:30 p.m. on Wednesday, July 9, to the early morning of Thursday, July 10,when the farmer found it.Interview:Robert Boerman, Dutch Crop Circle Archive (www.dcca.nl), Brummen,Holland: \"An eyewitness walking with a dog said that at 9:30 p.m., there wasnothing in the field. And then about 11 p.m., there was another eyewitnessdriving on the highway in his car, and he said there were some high clouds and it"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"was a very large column of a cloud come down from the sky. He thought it wasin the area of the crop circle (discovered the next morning), but he is not sure.He said, \"The only thing I saw was a column of clouds.\"A COLUMN IN THE AIR THAT LOOKED LIKE IT WAS MADE OF ACLOUD, BUT IT HAD STRAIGHT SIDES TO IT THE WAY WE WOULDTHINK OF A CYLINDER?Yes, like a cylinder, but it was sort of bent to the left.MEANING, IT WASN'T A STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN COLUMN, BUT ITHAD KIND OF A CURVE TO IT AT THE BOTTOM?It was about 300 feet above the ground and then it bent to the left.Drawing based on discussion with the farmer who witnessedthe cylinder-shaped cloud around 11:00 p.m. on July 9, the night before he discoveredthe three circle pattern in his field the next morning. Drawing © 2003 by Robert Boerman. IT DIDN'T RESEMBLE A TORNADO OR WATER SPOUT OR A DUSTDEVIL?No, nothing.IN OTHER WORDS, THIS IS A DESCRIPTION OF SOMETHING THISPERSON HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE?Yes, that's correct. He was living close to the field. He could see the formationfrom the farmer on the right. He said, 'I was driving on the highway and onlydrank one beer,\" he told me. 'My wife was driving and that is what I saw.Whether you believe it or not, that's what I saw a cylinder of clouds. It was inthe same area that the crop circles were found, but I'm not sure if it was the samefield, but it was in the same area.'The circles were discovered the next morning. I don't know the exact time, but itwas early in the morning, and the same farmer who saw the cylinder of cloudssaid it was absolutely flattened, the crop. It was beautiful and no traces ofhumans, no footprints or whatever. 'It was really beautiful!' he said.NOW LOOKING AT THE PHOTOGRAPH, I WOULD AGREE. IT LOOKSBEAUTIFUL AND CRISP AND PRECISE. AND THEN YOU SAY, WHY ISTHAT BIG CENTRAL CIRCLE SORT OF SHIFTED TO ONE SIDE?I have no idea. What we have measured, the leylines every single circle hasleylines crossing in the center and the leylines are connected to the outside ofevery circle. I have to draw the image tonight. It wasn't possible to create thatpattern any other way because it's connected exactly inside the leylines."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Robert Boerman used dowsing rods to detect energy leylines in the wheat field and reportsthat the leylines crossed at the centers of each of the three circles and also defined theexteriorperimeters of the circles. Graphic overlay of leylines as he detected them © 2003 byRobert Boerman. SO, WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT IN TERMS OF MEASURINGLEYLINES, THAT THE CENTRAL CIRCLE WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEENSHIFTED INTO THE POSITION THAT IT IS IN ORDER TO HAVE THELEYLINES CROSS AT THE CENTER OF THAT LARGE CIRCLE.Yes, that's the only way to make it.HOW DID YOU MEASURE THE LEYLINES?With dowsing rods. And my son, Bart, he joined me. He is 9 years old and hesaid he saw a ball of light coming out of the crops and landed 20 or 30 metersinside the crop.ON THIS MOST RECENT ONE OF JULY 10?Yes, this one.AND WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THAT LIGHT APPEARED?I was doing some measurements and taking some photos. and he said, 'Daddy,look here!' I said, 'What?' He said, 'I just saw a ball of light coming out of thestanding crop and then 20 meters further, it's going down in the crop.' He hasbeen several times in crop circles. He knows what he is talking about. He's only9 years old, but he can feel the leylines with his hands and can see them. And Itold him to do whatever he wanted to in the formation and that's what he toldme.DID HE DESCRIBE THE COLOR AND SIZE?White. It was white color. He thought about the size of a tennis ball.DID YOU GET DOWN AND LOOK AT THE BENDS, THE NODES, THESOIL AND THAT SORT OF THING?Yes, and we didn't found anything. Nothing like blown nodes or whatever.DID YOU LOOK FOR POLE MARKS IN THE CENTERS OF THOSECIRCLES?Yes, and there weren't any. No pole marks.SO NO OBVIOUS EVIDENCE OF MANMADE MECHANICAL CREATION?No, nothing. It was also what the farmer told us. When he first entered the field,he said the lay was very beautiful and no traces of humans or whatever.AND THIS IS THE SAME FARMER WHO NOTICED THAT CYLINDER OFCLOUDS. DID HE HEAR ANYTHING WHEN HE SAW THE CYLINDER OF"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"CLOUDS?No. He was on the highway a few miles away. I also remembered, I talked toanother person who said a dog was barking all night that night.IN THAT SAME AREA?Ye s . \" Updated on July 16, 2003:Second Eyewitness of Cylindrical-Shaped CloudEric Van Houtum, Musician, Nijmegen, Holland: \"On the night of July 9, itwas my birthday and I came back from rehearsal with my band. I was heading tothe highway, the A-50. then I saw this it was a cloud shaped like a column orpillar. Then I got on the highway and the cloud didn't move at all. It didn't movefrom my point of view.WHEN YOU WERE DRIVING AND FIRST SAW THIS, DID YOU SEEMOTION FROM THE CLOUD DOWNWARD?No, not at all.SO THE FIRST THING YOU SAW, THIS CLOUD CYLINDER WASALREADY EXTENDING FROM THE CLOUDS ABOVE DOWNWARD?Yes. It was bended at one point around one third of the entire length of the well,I call it a cloud. One third was bent.WOULD YOU SAY IT SEEMED TO BE CYLINDRICAL LIKE A PIPE?Yeah, OK. It maybe seemed round, yes.HOW LONG DID YOU SEE IT IN THIS CYLINDRICAL, STATIONARYPOSITION?I guess it's at least ten minutes and the highway where I was driving, it makes aslow bend over a distance from maybe ten or fifteen kilometers and the bendgoes north. So, I expected that if it was an optical illusion, I expected it tochange position or become horizontal, but it didn't.AFTER THOSE TEN OR SO MINUTES, WHAT HAPPENED?Then it got too dark to see. I was driving in dusk, twilight, and it was only in thenorth side enough light to see it in the direction where the cloud was. When Igot over the bridge, it was too dark to see it.AND IN THE AREA OF HOLLAND THAT YOU LIVE, ABOUT WHAT TIMEWOULD THAT BE WHEN IT GETS DARK?Then, it was 9th of July it must be very late, I think, 23 hours, 11 or 11:30before it gets pitch dark.\"More Information:2003 Crop Formations Reported in Holland:1) May 6, 2003, Hoeven, Holland: Twenty circles scattered in grass in Hoeven,Holland.

He was in theformation in Belgium and he said he wanted to call someone with his cellphone. But he said, 'My cell phone refuses. So I asked my wife and her cellphone also refuses. We had a good connection there outside the circle verymuch outside the circle. But inside the circle, absolutely no connection with thecell phones, two cell phones.'SO THEY COULD COMMUNICATE WITH THEIR CELL PHONES AS LONGAS THEY WERE OUTSIDE THE BEAUTIFUL BELGIUM FORMATIONTHAT MATCHES GOG MAGOG OF ENGLAND IN 2001, BUT AS SOON ASTHEY WENT INTO THE BELGIUM PATTERN, THEY COULD NOT MAKEANY CELL PHONE CONNECTION?That's correct.\"Continued in Part 3 - ItalyWe b s it e s :http://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://home.clara.net/lucy pringlehttp://www.invisiblecircle.de and http://www.invisiblecircle.org/ser/d-archiv-2003.htmlhttp://www.kornkreise.chhttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://www.heramagazine.net"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"http://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://www.cropcirclenews.comhttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
