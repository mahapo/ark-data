Such revelations,based on information from the CIA, would be a reversal of official policythat in the past has downgraded UFO incidents.\"U.S. News and World Report, April 18, 1977 To be more computer-upload-friendly, the reprints will be divided into parts.Here begins Part 4 of Status Report VII, from February 1994. 1974, A Year of Strange Strategies: Emily's Morgue Test Emily's case is bizarre. In fact, it is unique in crash/retrieval research. Shehad witnessed, firsthand, a deceased alien in a morgue drawer at Wright-Patterson AFB. To her, it was like a bad dream, admitting that she has hada hard time believing her own experience - or, why it happened. Occurring in 1974, Emily's story could easily be brushed aside as fantasy.But, as certain details of her high-intrigue case gradually surfaced, shemight have been an unwitting victim of a broader high level scheme. In thisrespect, I felt that her experience deserved a niche in this report. Despitethe high strangeness of her case, is hers any less credible than others whorelate mind-boggling experiences? My personal involvement in Emily's case began March 3, 1993, when sheconsented to join Pat Packard, a local researcher, (later to becomeMUFON's Section Director in Southwestern Ohio), and a friend to visit mein my home. She had been reluctant to see me, or anyone else, about herexperience until April 1992 when Packard first learned of the case fromher friend, a business acquaintance. But, after questioning her briefly atvarious times, he could not come to grips in accepting it as reality. On theother hand, he admitted that Emily could have experienced somethingextraordinary, stating: \"She cried, really cried, when trying to tell about herseeing the alien cadaver.\" Learning that we had a mutual interest in exotic plants, Emily brought mea tray of seedlings of a Kalanchoe species for my garden room collection ofsucculents and cacti and bromelieads, and some other hard-to-growtropical plants. Having just sprinkled the tropicals, the smell of a jungleeased our way into the subject of cadavers. Emily being an experienced artist for a large department store indowntown Cincinnati, she was offered an art job with attractive pay by herUncle John who was a top executive of a company, now defunct, namedHoelche Environmental Services, in western Cincinnati. An interview withher prospective boss, Mr. Kern, went smoothly, she said, discussingenvironmental issues and the nature of her artwork. Hired, she was allowedtwo weeks to give proper notice to her former employer and was to start"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"work on a given Monday. During this waiting period, Emily went out one evening for a dinner party.While toasting a drink, to her surprise, Mr. Kern just happened to show upand was quick to explain how he knew she would be at the restaurant,hoping to see her. Of course, she said, he was invited to join her table. Somehow, said Emily, the subject got onto UFOs, most of it critical.Again, surprise, Kern took issue with the critics, but she has forgotten thepoints of his argument. Later, privately, he asked her if she would like tosee the proof - a real alien. Thinking he must be joking, she agreed to thechallenge. According to Emily, he said, \"Tonight.\" I asked Emily if she felt safe with a stranger making such an unusualproposition. She said that she did because he was a friend of her UncleJohn's, and too, she wondered if it might be just a test of her ability toperform on the job. They drove to Wright-Patterson AFB. \"He had the right kind of credentials to get past all the guarded gates,\" saidEmily, adding, \"At one of the guard posts, I was given a clearance badge,but beyond that, he used a plastic key to open doors, one to an elevator. Itall seemed too pat, just as though they were expecting both of us to bethere.\" Again, using the magic plastic key, said Emily, showing some discomfort,they entered an underground room, well-lighted, in which there was abuilt-in section with several tiers of drawers. During one period of lull,with Kern seemingly preoccupied by staring at the drawers, a person inuniform, unarmed, entered the room. He smiled curtly, nodded toacknowledge her presence, said a few words inaudibly to Kern, thendeparted through a door on the opposite side of the room. Kern thenwalked up to one of the drawers, pulled it open and asked her to lookinside. Emily was shocked: unable, she recalls to utter a sound. There before her,at face level, was a small, lifeless body in a zipper bag, opened to thewaist. In disbelief, she said, \"The eyes got me. They were so big andpowerful and live-looking that I felt like I was hypnotized. Kern saidnothing, but I could sense that he was watching me, my every move.\" Non-Human Entity's Skin Like An Iguana's Photograph of iguana from http://iguanaden.fotopic.net.When I asked if she recognized any cameras mounted in the room, shesaid, \"I didn't think to look.\" I responded that more than one was probablyrigged to record her behavior. At that point, Emily, sitting across from me,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"her eyes watering and hands clasping, said that she was so unnerved at thattime, she could only vaguely recall other features of the half-exposedcadaver. \"It was grey,\" she said, \"about 4 feet tall with a slim torso withskin that looked like an iguana in texture.\" After a moment's pause, shecontinued: \"I should know, I have a large iguana as a pet.\" Of the face, sheremembered a small slit of a mouth and no nose. Then, after a prolongedsilence, she looked at me squarely and said, \"Mr. Kern invited me to touchit and I did. It was cold, but those eyes; they looked alive to me.\" Emily continued, \"On the return trip home, little was said. I remembertrembling in the car and I guess I mumbled about the body, the morgue andsecrecy, but Mr. Kern - except to remind me that I was not to tell anybodyabout the trip - was very quiet, not at all like he had been at the party andduring the interview.\" Finally, her eyes showed her inner stress and she said, \"So, I have seen theproof, but who was the real Mr. Kern? Why me? I had hoped to find outwhen I reported to work Monday.\" Other shocks were in store for Emily. Reporting to work on Monday, shewas informed by Kerns' secretary that he had died suddenly of a heartattack and that her job had been canceled. And, checking the newspapersfor Kern's obituary, his demise was never listed. Emily was left adrift foryears in her own surreal Hall of Mirrors, wondering who was who atHoelche's. I had talked with Pat Packard before Emily's visit to relate that I might beable to explain the reason for her misadventure at the morgue and itsconnection with other high-level strategies. Based on the known data, Ilater told Emily that it was my belief that the Hoelche Company was afront for a special intelligence operation. Speculating further, I said, some -if not all - of its personnel were undercover agents with Mr. Kern. He wasusing a fake name and credentials and was the key player. But, Iemphasized, I needed to know more about another player, her Uncle John. When Emily had finished her narrative, my first question to her concernedhis past military duties, if any. Response: Yes, he held a high rank in the U.S. Army. Next question: What was his specialty or assigned duty?Response: Intelligence. She knew this by his own admission based on anincident that occurred when she was a teenager. \"Looking back,\" she said,\"I got into a petty family quarrel and ran away to stay with my girlfriend,hid in my car behind a dumpster in an out-of-the-way parking lot. But,Uncle John found the car and revealed that he had the ways and means tosolve such problems. Boastingly, he said that was his job in armyintelligence.\" With this fact in mind, his executive post at Hoelche's probably dealt withmatters beyond environment. In Emily's case, and I'm guessing, he wasresponsible for offering his niece employment as an artist for Mr. Kern,knowing full well that she was to be used as a guinea pig in some kind ofweird psychological reaction test. Appearing disturbed, Emily said shenever thought of her Uncle John, who passed away shortly after theincident, would be involved in such a dirty trick. The rest of the story isobvious, I said, adding that Kern, according to plan, then disappearedwithout a trace, leaving his secretary to give out the false story of his death. Additional evidence of foul play, Emily recollects, involved a lady whosehusband worked at the firm. During the same time-frame as Emily's, shesuddenly became ill which led to a nervous breakdown. She declined togive a reason for her state of mind, but Emily wondered if Kern also usedher, and others, in a similar experiment. In summary, the \"Hoelche\" game plan was to ascertain human behavioralreaction to the sudden exposure to an alien being. To that end, 1974 might"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"have marked the beginning of a new policy - a plan to tell the world thetruth about the extraterrestrial UFO. According to leaks from insiders, there was an official concern in 1973,like in 1952, that the intensive low-level UFO activity would be a preludeto a larger scale tactical incursion. Also, there was a concern that the massmedia, over-stimulated by the inundation of sightings, was playing it updaily on the local TV and radio news and on the front pages ofnewspapers. Even the popular John Chancellor anchor on NBC-TV newsgave the UFO top billing at the peak period of the October flap. Theslumbering, benighted public, was being aroused. Was President Gerald Ford Preparingto Tell World About ETs in 1974? 1974 was also a year with persistent leaks from reliable sources reachingtop UFO researchers avowing that the government would soon formallyannounce that the UFO was real and of extraterrestrial origin. Oneexample, to put it briefly, was reported in my Status Report III, UFOCrash/Retrievals: Amassing the Evidence, in which I cited a sergeant inthe California Highway Patrol who was privy to hear a former high-rankingarmy officer address a survival course group and claimed he had firsthandinformation about a crashed saucer in New Mexico. He stated further thathe had no problem in releasing sensitive details to the sergeant because theU. S. government would be going public soon. My comment to follow the sergeant's disclosure in Status Report IIIaccents 1974's high strangeness of events contrived by phantom-likepeople in a Hall of Mirrors, follows in part: \"His (the sergeant's) reference to an imminent 1974 announcementdeclaring UFOs were of extraterrestrial origin, is extraordinary as I knewthat a report was quietly circulating among responsible researchersanticipating such an announcement jointly by the United States andFrance. According to my notes, December 3, 1974, I was alerted by WalterAndrus, Director of MUFON, to be prepared as public relations director torush to Chicago to join him and Dr. J. Allen Hynek of CUFOS in a pressconference if official word was released. \"Straws in the wind,\" I noted inmy log, were rife that the announcement would be made December 15 byPresident Gerald Ford.\" On the suggestion of Andrus, I prepared a tentativepress release which got both his and Hynek's approval and we waited. Inmy log entry for December 16, I noted, \"Wonder what President Ford andGiscard de Estaing, President of France, are discussing in Martiniquebesides the oil problem?\" There was no UFO announcement. Adding to the intrigue is the well-timed news wire release in 1974 by UPIfeaturing Professor John Spencer Carr's story about a saucer crash andrecovery of \"little men\" in New Mexico, in 1948. Never mind the detailsabout the anatomy of the bodies. I find the manner in which the story wasapparently controlled in the media to be more significant. As I recall, it gotthe usual funny treatment in Cincinnati and in Chicago. It caught theattention of Sherman Larsen, a no-nonsense researcher with CUFOS inEvanston, Illinois. He called me for comments, but oddly, I didn't hearabout the Carr \"little men\" story from any other of my many contacts fromcoast to coast. Curious, I called the local UPI office about the coverage.Answer: It probably was a controlled release, limited to three states: Ohio,Indiana and Illinois. Trying to rationalize a reason for such control, I couldonly deduce that it would be easier for the eyes and ears of a Hoelche-like\"company\" to keep tabs on reaction. Certainly before any publicannouncement, the officials would like to know how people think and notdepend wholly on the thinkers in \"Think Tanks.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Allowing for misinformation or embellished rumors and contriveddisinformation, I can only speculate about Emily's alleged experience andother coincidental happenings. Looking for a logical reason, the samesupposition applies to my own case in 1978 when I was bestowed acornucopia of anatomical information about the alien body from twounquestionably reliable doctors, one of whom had performed an autopsy.I, too, felt that I had been selected or used to receive bonafide informationfor release to the public as a test for reaction. Coincidentally, this was thesame year that Major Jesse Marcel, intelligence officer for the 509th BombGroup, made his famous disclosure about the Roswell incident. Albeit, the same \"testing\" theory can apply to any major UFO event orbook or movie or whistle blower that will appear to some researchers to be\"loaded\" with ulterior purposes. Again, the Hall of Mirrors. Charles Dickens in his book, A Ta l e o f Two Ci t i e s, described the times in1775 in France and England in part, \"...it was the age of wisdom, it was theage of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch ofincredulity ... it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair. ...\" In the decade of the 1970s, 200 years later, many UFO researchers foundthemselves in the same conflicting state of affairs thrust upon them byevents and by people and cells of people who emerged presto! from theHall of Mirrors. Emily's episode is just one of hundreds, affected by the\"epoch of incredulity\" in the 1970s. Looking back, the most sobering tochange the status quo was the UFO wave of 1973, the biggest since 1952.But, among the \"hopes\" and the \"despairs\" was the rise of Dr. Hynek andCUFOS, the fall of NICAP, the advent of animal mutilations, the upsurgeof abductions, the impact of Hollywood's highly touted Star Wars andClose Encounters of the Third Kind, the breakthrough of nut and boldcrash/retrievals and Jesse Marcel's disclosures on Roswell, ad infinitum -all concurrent with persistent rumors of an imminent officialannouncement that UFOs were real. Before my formal disclosures on crash/retrievals at the MUFONSymposium in Dayton in 1978, I remember being impressed - and still am -by an item appearing in the prestigious magazine, U.S. News and WorldReport on April 18, 1977, which stated:\"(In 1977) before the year is out, the government - perhaps thePresident (Gerald Ford) - is expected to make what are describedas \"unsettling disclosures\" about UFOs - unidentified flying objects.Such revelations, based on information from the CIA, would be areversal of official policy that in the past has downgraded UFOincidents.\"U.S. News and World Report, April 18, 1977 To be continued in Part 5.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
