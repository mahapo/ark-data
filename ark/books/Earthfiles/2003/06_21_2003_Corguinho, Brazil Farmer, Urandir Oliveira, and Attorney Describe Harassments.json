Photograph © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe.June 21, 2003 Campo Grande, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil - On Friday,Corguinho, Brazil farmer Urandir Oliveira traveled to Campo Grande to joinwith his first wife, Maria do Carmo da Silva, and his attorney, Mr. DaniloCostalunga, in a telephone discussion with Whitley Strieber and me forDreamland Online and Earthfiles.com. The Portuguese-to-English translationduring the interview was provided by Felipe Branco, University of London-trained businessman, who is now an executive in Rocheston Ltd., Milan, Italy,and cattle rancher, Campo Grande, Brazil.Brazilian UFO magazine editor, A. J. Gevaerd, and Charlette LeFevre,Coordinator Seattle UFO/Paranormal Group, have e-mailed allegations aboutUrandir Oliveira which Oliveira, his attorney and ex-wife say are false. I beganby asking Mr. Danilo Costalunga, Attorney and Law Professor, Rio Grande doSul State University and Santa Catarina State University, Porto Alegre, aboutthe March 2000 alleged 'land fraud' lawsuit brought against Urandir Oliveira inwhich Mr. Costalunga represented Urandir. Costalunga says a judge dismissedthe case as having no merit.As of April 2, 2001, the Federal Judiciary in Sao Paulo, Brazil, shows in itscomputer records about Urandir Oliveira that there have been no legaljudgments against Urandir Oliveira in the nation of Brazil, \"Nada Consta,\" no"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"charges against.April 2, 2001 Certificate from Sao Paulo Federal Courtwhich declares that Urandir Fernandes de Oliveira is \"Nada Consta,\"has no guilty charges against him in Brazil.Interview:Felipe Branco translating phone conversation from Portuguese-to-English,Campo Grande, Brazil:Attorney Danilo CostalungaExplains the March 2000 \"Land Fraud\" Incident\"A lawyer was hired by three persons who bought land there (in Corguinho,Brazil). They said that Urandir was selling land, that he was not the legal owner.(That lawyer) was saying that he (Urandir) was selling his land so that peoplewould be protected against future cataclysms (by ETs) and things like that. Hesaid that Urandir had a group involved in this and was parceling and selling thisland. That's basically the accusation.WHITLEY: WHAT HAPPENED IN COURT?Within two days, the police illegally arrested him (Urandir). Immediately afterhe was arrested, he asked the court to release him under habeas corpus. ThenMr. Costalunga asked the Supreme Court of Rio Grande do Sul to issue ahabeas corpus and they were successful in releasing him (Urandir). TheSupreme Court issued a habeas corpus and also issued a statement thatUrandir's arrest was totally illegal and all the accusations were unfounded.LINDA: FELIPE, CAN MR. COSTALUNGA EXPLAIN HOW URANDIROLIVEIRA COULD HAVE BEEN ARRESTED IN THE FIRST PLACE ONSOMETHING LIKE SIMPLY A CHARGE BEFORE THERE HAD EVENBEEN ANY COURT PROCEEDINGS?He said that Urandir was arrested by the police, not by court order, simplybecause the documents showed that the police, without any court order, decidedto arrest him without any reason.WHO IS IT THAT FILED THE LAWSUIT?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"It was a lawyer.WHO WAS THE LAWYER FILING THE CHARGE FOR?It was represented for three persons who had bought land there (in Corguinho).LINDA: WHEN I WAS THERE IN FEBRUARY, FELIPE, YOU SAID THENTHAT A. J. GEVAERD SPECIFICALLY WAS THE ONE WHO FILED THISLAWSUIT ON THE LAND FRAUD CHARGES.He (Costalunga) says A. J. Gevaerd helped them (lawyer and three plaintiffs)produce the documents and he (Costalunga) has documents here that can showyou that the (land fraud) documents originated from the fax number ofBrazilian UFO magazine, which is A. J. Gevaerd's magazine.LINDA: WHAT IS THE TRUTH ON THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT HAS BEENWIDELY DISSEMINATED BY GEVAERD AND CHARLETTE LE FEVRE OFSHOWING URANDIR BEHIND BLACK BARS?I asked the lawyer this. He said that it was a TV crew that filmed it. There wasno photograph.It was Globo TV from Rio Grande do Sul.AND WHY WAS GLOBO TV THERE?He (Danilo Costalunga) is saying RBS-TV is an affiliate of Globo televisionfrom Rio Grande do Sul. (Costalunga) says that someone called them (RBS)there. It is impossible to know who.WOULD IT BE NORMAL FOR SOMEBODY TO BE ARRESTED BYPOLICE AND TAKEN DOWN TO A JAIL ON AN ALLEGED LAND FRAUDCHARGE AND TELEVISED?You are asking, is this normal, this?YES.He is saying that it's highly unlikely this is not normal procedure at all. He saidthat it was a police inquiry. With the police inquiry, two days after he wasarrested with the TV crew there and everything was as if previously arranged.And he (Costalunga) said the TV crew filmed and showed all over Brazil, thisimage passed to all newspapers and everything (of Urandir behind bars at thepolice station.) He (attorney Costalunga) says it is highly unlikely, this.WITHIN TWO DAYS OR SO, URANDIR OLIVEIRA WAS RELEASED ANDALL CHARGES WERE CLEARED IN A COURT?He said that after he was released, he (Costalunga) he continued for six monthsmore making inquiries on the accusation because they were totally crazy. He isexplaining me that the police was making, charging, (Urandir). But who issupposed to (do the) charge is the Attorney General of the state. But it was thepolice who did it arbitrarily and when they (land fraud claim-lawyer) sent this tothe Attorney General and they wanted the Attorney General to prosecute him(Urandir), the Attorney General said, 'There is nothing here. I'm not going to dothat.' It is the state that is supposed to move against Urandir, not the police andit was the police in the case. They are supposed to investigate only. TheAttorney General said there are no grounds for the arresting him, for nothing.'I'm not going to do anything.' And the case was totally dismissed.SO IS THE IMPLICATION THAT SOME ONE PERHAPS A. J. GEVAERD PAID THE POLICE TO MAKE THIS ARREST SO IT COULD BE COVEREDON GLOBO TV?Lawyer (Costalunga) says he has no grounds, no knowledge, and no capacity toanswer such a question.BUT THAT WAS THE IMPLICATION THAT YOU HAD?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Yes. The implication is that it was highly illegal and highly abnormal. The Judgeof the Rio Grande Do Sul court issued a statement saying that he (Urandir) wasnot guilty of any crime.OK, THIS IS THE FEDERAL JUSTICA DOCUMENT THAT HAS 'NADACONSTA' WRITTEN ON IT. DID ATTORNEY COSTALUNGA GO TOCOURT TO SHOW THERE WERE NO LAWSUIT CHARGES OR GUILTYFINDINGS AGAINST URANDIR OLIVEIRA?Yes, it means he was never prosecuted by any tribunal in Brazil. He was neverprosecuted.WHITLEY: BUT THERE IS ANOTHER WORD IN ENGLISH THAT MIGHTFIT HERE AND THAT IS, 'PERSECUTED.' DO YOU THINK YOU CAN ASKHIM (URANDIR) THIS AS WELL THAT HE IS BEING PERSECUTED BYMEMBERS OF THE UFO COMMUNITY IN BRAZIL WHO DO NOT LIKEHIS CLAIMS BECAUSE THEY FIND THEM EMBARRASSING?Felipe: You want me to ask Urandir that?YES.Yes, he has been persecuted and he doesn't know why. He said he doesn'tunderstand why because he used to provide them with information he got fromETs. (Also), because he said he has refused some of their propositions (forexclusivity) that these UFO researchers made to him. They started harassing him.They even tried to kill him. Some One Shot Urandir Oliveira in 2000CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT GUN SHOT IN WHICH HE HAS THE SCAR INHIS LEFT ARM?He said that he has heard that there were some people around his farm who werethere to kill him. He heard a rumor, no?WHITLEY: WHEN WAS THIS?(In 2000), fifteen days after the rumors he started hearing, he was going back tothe farm for a day and a night and when he stopped at the gate to open the gateand go, he was shot by a couple of persons. He did not know them. This wasthree years ago (2000) and he said that they were hidden in the bush. He wasshot, so he couldn't see. He tried to find out about these people, but he did notmanage to find out who was behind this nor to get these two persons thatattempted against his life.WHITLEY: LINDA, HAVE YOU SEEN THE SCAR?LINDA: YES. IT IS A ROUND (DARK) SCAR ON HIS LEFT ARMSLIGHTLY BELOW HIS ELBOW AND I ASKED ABOUT IT AND HEARDTHIS STORY IN FEBRUARY WHEN I WAS IN CORGUINHO. FELIPE, YOUSAID HE WROTE DOWN A PARTIAL NUMBER AND THERE WAS ALICENSE PLATE THAT WAS TRACKED? After Bullet, Second Attack On Urandir in 2000No, this is another attack this was six months after (the bullet) one (in 2000). He(Urandir) was being followed by a dark pickup truck for about 1,400 kilometers.Three days after, they attacked him on a road, on a highway. The pickup truckstopped beside him in a gas station. They stopped right beside him and theperson on the passenger seat was in front of Urandir (meaning the dark truckstopped on the left side of Urandir who was in his truck's driver's seat) and the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"(person in the dark truck's passenger seat) had a large object in his hand andtried to hit his(Urandir's) head. And he managed to hit him in the face (with therock) and then they drove away and he (Urandir) managed to write down thelicense plate. He followed the pickup truck and while he was following, hemanaged to write down the license plate.WHERE WAS THAT TRACED TO?The same day he went to a police station. He pressed charges and the policechief checked the license plate and the pickup truck was in the name of A. J.Gevaerd. And two days later, A. J. Gevaerd transferred the car to anotherperson.WAS THAT THE ROCK-THROWING INCIDENT THAT IS IN THE LEGALDOCUMENT (I HAVE SEEN)?Yes, he said (the person in passenger seat) hit him in the head with that rock.AND THE FIRST INCIDENT SIX MONTHS BEFORE WAS A GUN SHOT INHIS LEFT ARM THAT LEFT A SCAR?Ye s .SO, THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT INCIDENTS, NOT JUST ONE. WHATABOUT ATTORNEY COSTALUNGA'S EFFORTS TO FILE HARASSMENT,DEFAMATION AND LIBEL CHARGES AGAINST, AS I UNDERSTAND IT,AGAINST A. J. GEVAERD MORE THAN ONCE?No, Prof. Costalunga just took care of this (illegal) arrest ('land fraud' in March2000). Another lawyer from Sao Paulo is pressing charges against (Gevaerd) fordefamation, Urandir's lawyer in Sao Paulo.WHAT IS THE NAME OF THE LAWYER IN SAO PAULO WHO HAS FILEDTHE LIBEL AND DEFAMATION AND HARASSMENT CHARGE ORCHARGES AGAINST GEVAERD?Dr. Lincoln Huttun and Elenice Pereira of Campo Grande. Urandir says he hasnine accusations we call it 'processes.'WHY IS IT THAT NONE OF THEM HAVE STUCK AND IMPEDED A. J.GEVAERD'S ATTEMPTS TO KEEP HARASSING?There are two reasons mainly: Brazilian justice, the judicial system is very slow.Second is that he (A. J. Gevaerd) is kind of well known here. He has friends inthe judiciary of the Mato Grosso do Sul state (in which Corguinho exists), sothey can slow things up for him a little bit.WHO ARE THINGS SLOWED UP FOR?A. J. Gevaerd. Whitley Asks Urandir Oliveira About ET InteractionsWHITLEY: OK, SO GEVAERD DID HAVE A HAND IN (THE 'LAND FRAUD'INCIDENT) AND IT REALLY CAME TO NOTHING. I WOULD LIKE, IFYOU DON'T MIND, TO ASK URANDIR ABOUT HIS EXPERIENCES. THISIS WHAT I THINK WOULD BE OF INTEREST TO MY LISTENERS. I MUSTBE HONEST WITH YOU THAT THE VARIOUS IN-FIGHTING BETWEENTHE VARIOUS UFO GROUPS AND WHAT NOT IS OF VERY LITTLEINTEREST. I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT IN TRYING TO SET THE RECORDSTRAIGHT IN THAT A. J. GEVAERD WAS INVOLVED IN THIS AND THE(LAND FRAUD) SUIT WAS DISMISSED. SO, WE'VE ESTABLISHED THAT.WHY DON'T YOU GET URANDIR ON THE LINE AND YOU CAN DOSOME TRANSLATING AND WE CAN GET A LITTLE INTO HIS OWN"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO HIM.Felipe: Urandir is on the line.WHITLEY: OK, URANDIR, I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU A COUPLE OFQUESTIONS.

URANDIR WAS TALKING ABOUT PROJECT VESTIBULE HEDESCRIBED IT AS BEING THE RESULT OF A DREAM HE HAD BACK ONMAY 2, 1999 IN AN INTERVIEW.Felipe: He (Urandir) doesn't know what you are talking about.I'M SITTING HERE READING AN INTERVIEW WITH HIM THAT WASTAKEN DOWN ON MAY 2, 1999, IN WHICH HE DISCUSSES PROJECTVESTIBULE AND SAYS, 'MANY HAVE BEEN IN CHARGE OF THISWORK OF SPREADING AND PREPARATION BETWEEN THEM THATARE SENSITIVE AND THE ONES THAT SOME HAVE DEVELOPED IN APARANORMAL COLLEGE.'

DID ALL THE BEINGS IN IT LOOK HUMAN?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"He said there were 16 persons in this room, but only one talked to him.AND THEY WERE PEOPLE, OR BLOND BEINGS?Yes, they were human like us, but different there were blondes, black hair, redhair, different colors. Urandir Oliveira Says \"Cult\" Video Image and Claims AreFalseI HAVE SEEN A VIDEOTAPE OF A LECTURE (IN SEATTLE MAY 2003) BYA. J. GEVAERD AND IN THIS VIDEOTAPE HE SHOWS PEOPLE IN WHITECLOTHING WHO LOOK LIKE THEY ARE WORSHIPING HIM (URANDIR).COULD HE EXPLAIN THAT?He is saying that it's very hard it cannot be real, this. He thinks they played withthe film or something like that because there doesn't exist any uniform orworship or nothing of the source.I SEE, SO HE DOESN'T ACTUALLY WEAR THAT TYPE OF CLOTHINGTHAT IS SHOWN IN THIS?There is no white clothes whatsoever.NONE.None.ARE THERE PEOPLE LIVING THERE AT THE FARM WHO ARE LIVINGTHERE BECAUSE THEY ARE INVOLVED IN THIS AND ATTEMPTINGCONTACT WITH OTHER BEINGS?No, there are only farm workers there.HAVE THERE EVER BEEN A GROUP OF PEOPLE LIKE THAT THERE?That live there?THAT WOULD COME THERE AND ENGAGE IN CONTACT ATTEMPTSAND PAY MONEY TO DO IT?No, he said the groups of people who occasionally come there to do vigils in thenight and night watches and things like that that just stay room and board thathe provides for them (most are small A-frames for sleeping bags). Earth's Magnetic FieldONE OF THE THINGS HE (URANDIR) HAS SAID IS A WARNING ABOUTTHE EARTH'S MAGNETIC FIELD. WHAT IS THE WARNING EXACTLY?He is saying that Earth's magnetic field is lowering its intensity and this is goingto have a very dangerous affect on peoples' consciousness and emotionalbehavior.HOW DOES HE REACT TO THIS?He is saying that people have to sort of like balance themselves emotionally inthis magnetic field.IN APRIL 2002, A SCIENTIST AT THE INSTITUTE OF EARTH SCIENCESIN PARIS ANNOUNCED THAT HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES AT THEINSTITUTE HAD OBSERVED STRANGE ANOMALIES IN EARTH'SMAGNETIC FIELDS. AND THAT THE MAGNETIC FIELD WAS IN A STATE"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"OF FLUX - THAT THESE TWO SCIENTISTS HAVE DISCOVERED THATTHE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH HAS GONE INTO A STATE OFFLUX, THAT MEANS THAT IT IS CHANGING. I WOULD LIKE URANDIRTO COMMENT ON WHAT HE THINKS ABOUT THE FACT THAT THISUNEXPECTED EVENT IS TAKING PLACE.He said that ten years ago, the extraterrestrial beings told him about it. He hasspoken about it since then.YES, I NOTICE HE IS ON RECORD AS HAVING MADE THIS STATEMENTQUITE A BIT OF TIME, A COUPLE OF YEARS AT LEAST THAT I'VEBEEN ABLE TO FIND, THAT HE PUBLICLY STATED PRIOR TO THISANNOUNCEMENT ON THE PART OF THE FRENCH SCIENTISTS. WHAT,IN HIS OPINION, DO THE CHANGES THAT ARE TAKING PLACE NOW WHAT MIGHT THEY MEAN, BASED ON WHAT HE HAS BEEN TOLDBEFORE?He is saying it is going to provoke a few cataclysms around the planet. He saidthis process occurs every 5, 125 years. The last one was the one that the delugeis talked about in the Bible.WELL, THAT'S UTTERLY AT ODDS WITH THE SCIENCE OF THEMATTER. BUT THAT'S OK. THIS HAS BEEN REALLY FASCINATING, BUTI THINK WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO COME TO A CONCLUSION HERE.I WOULD LIKE TO ASK URANDIR IF HE HAS ANYTHING HE WOULDLIKE, ANY MESSAGE, HE WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE LISTENERS INCONCLUSION?I would like the people in general to pay more attention to these coming Earthchanges and that they would start thinking for themselves, instead of beinginfluenced by many peoples, by what people say to find (their own) inner truth.And that they walk with their own legs and feet because the one's best judge isone's consciousness. And the changes are already occurring on the planet andthey will increase. This is increasing, it's augmenting the difference betweennegativity and positivity. So, you must have a very positive approach to things ingeneral because by doing that, you will, things will start happening in a positiveway. Because he said, the Earth changes, the things are just beginning. Most ofall, they must believe in themselves and see life accordingly. And that theyshould have an open mind to this new reality of extraterrestrial interaction withour planet.\" Maria do Carmo da Silva, Urandir's Ex-wife,Denies Wife Beating Accusation\"It would be different if Linda ever confirmed Urandirs arrest overbeating his wife.
