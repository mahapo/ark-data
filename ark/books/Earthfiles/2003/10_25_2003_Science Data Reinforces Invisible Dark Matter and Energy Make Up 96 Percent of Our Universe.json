Cosmologists call it a \"baby picture\" of the universe.Colors indicate \"warmer\" (red) and \"cooler\" (blue) spots. The oval shape is a projection to displaythe whole sky; similar to the way the globe of the earth can be projected as an oval. The microwavelight captured in this picture is from 379,000 years after the Big Bang,over 13 billion years ago. Source: WMAP NASA.October 24, 2003 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - 2003 is turning out to be a pivotal yearfor cosmologists. In February, NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy (an-EYE-stro-pea) Probe - known as WMAP - made precise measurements of the oldest light in theuniverse, the microwave background radiation from the Big Bang. The map produced fromthe microwave data breaks our universe down this way:Age 13.3+ billion yearsComposition .4% glowing matter such as stars. 3.6% \"normal\" matter as we know it in planets and stars. 23.0% cold, invisible \"dark\" matter detectable only by its gravitational influence on\"normal\" matter. 73.0% invisible \"dark\" energy.SizeAt least 42 billion light-years and expanding.ShapeDebate whether curved, finite space versus flat, infinite space. Most recent datafavors flat, infinite."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Max Tegmark, Ph.D.:“ Our entire observable universe is inside this sphere of radius 13.3 billion light-years, with us at the center. Space continues outside the sphere, but this opaque glowing wall ofhydrogen plasma hides it from our view. This censorship is frustrating, since if we could see merely380,000 light-years beyond it, we would behold the beginning of the universe. Light from still furtheraway would not yet have had time to reach us, but most inflation theories predict that space is infinite.(Note for pundits: These 'distances' are merely light-travel times. After emitting the CMB 13.3 billionyears ago, the sphere above has kept expanding and is currently about 40 billion light-years away; itsco-moving radius is, was and always will be 40 billion light years.”High resolution \"seeds\" of temperature differences in the microwavelight bathing the universe after the Big Bang.

Thesepatterns are tiny temperature differences within an extraordinarily evenlydispersed microwave light bathing the Universe, which now averages a frigid2.73 degrees above absolute zero temperature. WMAP resolves slighttemperature fluctuations, which vary by only millionths of a degree.The new data support and strenghten the Big Bang and Inflation Theories. Thescience data for this mission is stored in a new on-line archive: Legacy Archivefor Microwave Background Data Analysis (LAMBDA).If transparent dark matter has been a necessary ingredient in the creation ofgalaxies and matter worlds, the opposite is true of \"dark energy.\" It makes upmost of the universe - 73% - but no one has a clue what it is or how it works.Scientists theorize that it came later in the evolution of the universe because itseems to be what is accelerating the expansion of the universe. If it had beenaround in the beginning, perhaps it would have torn apart any young galaxiesbeing clustered together by the equally strange but more primordial \"darkmatter.\" Scientists thought that the new 2003 data might solve once and for allthe question about whether our universe has a curved, finite shape that willcollapse back on itself - or is flat, infinite, and ever-expanding. But the datacomes down on a razor's edge in which the universe could go either way,depending upon what more is learned about mysterious, transparent, darkenergy and matter.Ironically, the stronger the data has supported the invisible universe of darkenergy and dark matter, the more disturbed cosmologists are. One of theparticipants in the Sloan Digital 3-D Mapping project is Max Tegmark, Ph.D.and Associate Professor of Physics and Astronomy at the University ofPennsylvania. He told me it is still hard for him to believe our universe is asstrange as the WMAP and Sloan measurements indicate.Interview:Max Tegmark, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Physics and Astronomy, Univ.of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Participant in Sloan"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Digital Sky Survey 3-D mapping of galaxies: \"For a long time, a series ofclues has been trickling in pointing in very strange directions, saying that most ofthe stuff in the universe is dark matter we couldn't see, maybe it was acceleratingand other funny things. But I think my gut feeling always was that somehow even though at some intellectual level I believed in this deep down inside, I didnot. I thought, 'No, it can't be this weird!' To me, when the WMAP data camealong, that's when it really hit me: 'Wow, it really is this way. This isn't all goingto go away.' WMAP did everything so much more carefully and accurately thatit eliminated all the lingering doubts.WHAT DO YOU THINK RIGHT NOW IS THE STRANGEST IMPLICATIONFROM THE DATA YOU ARE CHALLENGED WITH?For starters, I think it is pretty weird that we have no clue what 95% of theuniverse is made out of. All the atoms we learned about in school and chemistrymake up only a measly 5% of the stuff and that really disturbs me.It's important to remember that dark matter and dark energy are still mostlyfancy words for our ignorance. We are quite certain that dark matter is out thereand we have a good measurement about how much there is because we can seeits gravitational affects pulling on other stuff. But that's about all we knowabout, how much there is. We have no clue about what it's made of, if it's somestrange, exotic yet undiscovered particles or something else.About the 'dark energy,' we know even less. Dark matter is at least matter stuffthat you could have a big clump of some place. Whereas dark energy, you can'teven have more of in one place versus another place because by its very nature,it has exactly the same destiny everywhere in space.The question of what dark energy and dark matter is - that's perhaps the mostpressing question in all of physics right now.COULD THIS STRANGE DISPROPORTIONATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN95% OF THE UNIVERSE BEING MADE OF DARK MATTER AND ENERGYTHAT IS TRANSPARENT TO US VERSUS WE'RE IN 5% EXPLAIN SOMEOF THE ANOMALIES THAT FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OFEXTRASENSORY PERCEPTION, GHOSTS, THAT SOME OF THE THINGSTHAT INTERACT WITH THIS MATTER WORLD COULD BE COMINGFROM THIS OTHER 95% AND MIGHT ULTIMATELY EXPLAINPHENOMENA?My guess is no, that this does not have anything to do with ghosts and the like.But at the same time, Linda, what this really does tell you is that we scientistshave to be really humble and not have a knee jerk reaction that everything wecan't understand can't exist. By that argument you could have easily said thatdark energy can't exist and dark matter can't exist either.The universe has turned out to be stranger than we ever dreamed of and containsall sorts of things that I think none of us thought were actually out there andthere mayt be more. So, these maps we now see in our map simply trace out thedistribution of the dark matter.WE'RE SORT OF IN THE MATTER WE KNOW THAT'S THE NEW KID ONTHE BLOCK AND THE ASSUMPTION THAT DARK ENERGY AND DARKMATTER HAD TO BE THERE FIRST IN ORDER FOR THE MATTERWORLDS TO HAVE EVOLVED AND CREATED IN THE FIRST PLACE?Yes, dark matter. But dark energy, no. Dark matter helps us because it formsclumps and since there is six times more of it than ordinary matter, what darkmatter says, goes. If dark matter clumps somewhere, all the atoms that make upus also get sucked in there.But dark energy has the opposite effect creating sort of anti-gravity that sort ofblows things apart. It sabotages the formation of galaxies and stars. So,fortunately for us, dark energy only started taking over very recently after ourown Milky Way galaxy had formed. If the dark energy had taken over sooner, wewouldn't be here."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"SO THE FIRST MYSTERY IS WHAT IS DARK MATTER THAT MAKES UPSO MUCH OF THE UNIVERSE AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEFORMATION OF GALAXIES AND THESE LONG WALLS OF GALAXIES?THEN, WHY DID DARK ENERGY COME INTO THE PICTURE ANDWORK AGAINST THE CREATION OF GALAXIES?That's right. That's right. So, why dark energy came along and did this, yourguess is really as good as mine as a scientist. It came as a great shock to mostpeople and we frankly do not have a good explanation for why that is. And wewon't until we know what the dark energy is.ARE DARK ENERGY AND DARK MATTER COMPLETELY DEVOID OFPHOTON ENERGY?Dark matter is probably some particle like protons or neutrons, but are veryarrogant and don't want to interact with us. So if a dark matter particle cameflying at you, it would just go right through you and come out the other side. Itmight just go straight through Earth and out the other side. They don't want todeal with us.You can even magine a big thing made out of dark matter that would just passinvisibly right through you. So, the only way we know it's there is that it pullson us. If you made a whole planet out of dark matter, say, or say you made a starout of dark matter and put it in our solar system, then we could orbit that theway we orbit the sun now. You would very much be aware of its presence, evenif you couldn't see it.IF OUR SUN, FOR EXAMPLE, WERE SUDDENLY MADE OF DARKMATTER, WOULD IT BE LIKE A BLACKNESS, A HOLE, COMPLETELYDEVOID OF LIGHT?It wouldn't be emitting any light, but it would be transparent, so if there were astar behind it, you could see that star still. It would just look like it was notthere.BECAUSE THE UNIVERSE IS MADE OUT OF SO MUCH DARK MATTER,WE'RE STILL SEEING OUR 4%-5% DISTRIBUTED MATTER UNIVERSEWITH ALL OF THIS DARK MATTER THERE BECAUSE TO US IT'STRANSPARENT.Exactly, exactly, that's a good point. That's right exactly, the dark matter istransparent.WHY IS THAT?Well, (laughs), that's why we call it 'dark matter' because it's dark, we can't see it.What we mean by 'dark' is not dark like my black filing cabinet here thatobscures behind it. So, we mean dark as in not giving off any light. Maybe weshould call it transparent matter instead of invisible matter.WHAT IS IT ABOUT DARK MATTER THAT WOULD MAKE ITTRANSPARENT TO PHOTON ENERGY?The reason you actually see something like your hand when you hold it out infront of you is because light particles, the photons, bounce off the particles inyour hand rather than go through. If a photon comes from the light bulb in yourroom and bounces off an atom in the skin of your hand and then bounced toyour eye, you see it.Dark matter particles don't like bouncing off our kind of particles at all. Theythink we're not cool enough to interact with. So, light photons just go rightthrough them, right past them without bouncing. That's why they don't reflectanything, that's why they don't make their presence known.In a sense that might sound a wee bit crazy, but we've already detected particleslike that called 'neutrinos.' Those are the most arrogant particles we've"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"discovered so far. They really don't like to mingle. If you take a neutrino, youcan make them in a nuclear reactor. The sun also makes them. If it hits Earth, itjust goes straight through Earth and out the other side, rather than bounce off anatom like most normal particles would.SO YOU WOULD PUT A NEUTRINO INTO THE CATEGORY OF DARKMATTER?Yes. In fact, a lot of people thought that neutrinos were the dark matter for quitesome time. Then it was discovered that neutrinos have a little bit of mass, so wedo know that neutrinos make up at at least one-third of a percent of all thematter in the universe.FROM THE WMAP DATA THAT WE HAVE A UNIVERSE THAT WOULDBE AKIN TO A CLEAR JELLO IN WHICH WHAT WE CONSIDER TO BEMATTER WORLDS AND STARS ARE JUST SIMPLY EMBEDDED IN THISLARGE, TRANSPARENT JELLO?Yeah, that's a pretty good analogy because there really is all this tuff everywherethat we are seeing through. And if history teaches us anything, it is the universehas turned out to be stranger than we ever imagined over and over again.When Einstein came along and said, 'Hey, guys, if you go fast, time slows down.'That was so weird that he didn't even get the Nobel Prize for that theory becausethey thought it was too weird. And I'm saying that even though I'm Swedish andam embarrassed on behalf of the Nobel Committee.And then when the quantum mechanics pioneers came along and said, 'Look,guys, an atom can actually be in two places at once.' That was REALLY weirdand totally freaked people out and people are still arguing about what it means.So here we go again. Now we've discovered that the universe contains all thisinvisible stuff and I think we just need to accept once and for all that theuniverse is weird and learn to live with it.
