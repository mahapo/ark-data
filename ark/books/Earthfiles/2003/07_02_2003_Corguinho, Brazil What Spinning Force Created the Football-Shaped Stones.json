Video image © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe and Bob Terrio. July 2, 2003 Philadelphia, Pennsylvania - As reported in my June 6four-part Earthfiles series about scientific data emerging from analysis of thephysical evidence I gathered in Corguinho, Brazil, in February 2003, x-raydiffractometry (XRD) was done at the University of Pennsylvania across theinterior of one of the 75 small stones given to me from the September 15, 2002,\"rain of rocks.\" The XRD computer analysis produced a list of minerals,starting with quartz, which is the most abundant substance in the stones, andcontinuing in order of quantity: Quartz, Goethite, Hematite, Rutile (whichcontains titanium), Albite and Cubanite. The mineral, Cubanite, is very rare andstrongly magnetic. Biophysicist W. C. Levengood had discovered magnetic fieldsin two Corguinho stones I sent to his laboratory before the Cubanite wasdiscovered.After the XRD analysis, further work was done to examine thin slices ofCorguinho stones on a petrographic microscope by Prof. Gomaa Omar. Bornand raised in Egypt, Prof. Omar is a rock expert, published in Science, and hastaught and researched at the University of Pennsylvania Department of Earthand Environmental Science for twenty-five years. He is puzzled about the originand creation mechanism of the several disk-shaped Corguinho stones that heexamined.Gomaa Omar, Ph.D., Prof. of Geology, University of Pennsylvania,Philadelphia, examining slice through disk-shaped Corguinho, Brazil stone onJune 25, 2003.

See the banding here in each one of these.In addition to the football shape, really the most important thing is the bandingthere. This is a mystery to me. I don't see that very often. It's something thatshould be investigated further, no doubt about it.YOU'VE NEVER SEEN IT BEFORE THOUGH, YOU HAD SAID.No, I've never seen these particular football-like shapes and this particularmineral arrangement. I've never seen that before, no. The stone is primarily aniron matrix in which quartz crystals are embedded.All the white grains on the petrographic microscope monitor are quartz crystalsembedded in iron.

And definitely it's very clear that the quartz grains were floating in this ironliquid at high temperature. That's another observation we can make.\" Unidentified Fibrous Crystals Embeddedin Corguinho Disk-Shaped Stone"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"As we were looking at a slice from one of the disk-shaped Corguinho stones,Prof. Omar changed the lens power to 400X.

Video images © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe and Bob Terrio.Prof. Omar: \"These are spectacular ones. You see, the difference in colors hassomething to do with the thickness of the crystal. So whenever you get blue,yellow or golden-yellow like this, or greenish that has something to do with thethickness as you can see there.Above and below is a crystal with clear tube-like fibers, its composition still unidentified.AND IF THE QUARTZ GRAINS HAVE BEEN EATEN AWAY BY THEMELTED IRON, ARE YOU LOOKING HERE AT FIBROUS CRYSTALSTHAT HAVE NOT BEEN EATEN AWAY BY MELTED IRON?Maybe at the edges here, toward the edges a little bit. But it looks like it (fibrouscrystal) is more resistant to the decay and decomposition by the hot liquid thanthe quartz.SO, WHATEVER THESE ARE, THEY ARE ABLE TO RESIST A HIGHMELT TEMPERATURE MORE THAN THE QUARTZ?You could say that, yes. How much, I do not know.

But as to the banding and the stratificationgoing from the center outward, that has something to do with spinning force thatwe were talking about before. That's the most likely explanation so far and Ireally don't know what would cause this spinning force to form this. So that'sthe stratification inside (the stone). I think it's due to the spinning force, which itwould be nice to know how that happened.\"Above, close-up of disk-shaped slice of Corguinho stone in petrographicmicroscope slide.
