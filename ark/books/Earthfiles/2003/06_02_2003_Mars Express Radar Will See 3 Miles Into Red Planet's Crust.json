June 2, 2003 Baikonur, Kazakhstan - Today the European Space Agency(ESA) launched its first mission to Mars called \"Mars Express\" aboard a Russianrocket from Baikonur, Kazakhstan. Attached to the orbiter was Britain's Beagle2 lander which will land on the surface and look specifically for signs ofMartian life. The \"robotic geologist\" will dig into Mars soil and sample theatmosphere hunting for organic material or methane gas produced by livingorganisms.Overhead, the orbiter has radar to probe as deep as 5 kilometers (3 miles) whichwill increase understanding about the red planet's crust since little is knownbeyond three feet below the surface. The mission will reach Mars orbit on Dec.27, 2003 and then began its observations from an orbiter that has seveninstruments and will communicate on the surface with Beagle 2. The orbiter willpoint ground-penetrating radar at Mars for the first time, probing for evidence ofunderground water. Beagle 2 will conduct biochemical and geological tests at adifferent site than the two areas where NASA's Mars Exploration Rovers willland in January 2004.Collaborating with ESA, NASA said today, \"One major question about Mars,and about instability of a planet's environment, is what became of the water thatonce apparently flowed in abundance on Mars' surface. NASA's Mars Odysseyspacecraft now orbiting Mars has located ice mixed into the top meter (about 3feet) of Mars surface. Theories differ as to how much more water -- frozen ormelted -- lies deeper and how much may have dissipated from the planet's upperatmosphere. Mars Express will investigate the second possibility as well as thefirst. The radar instrument will examine the structure and variability of theionosphere -- the atmosphere's top layer. Other instruments will studyatmospheric chemistry and structure, and the interaction of the ionosphere withthe solar wind of charged particles speeding outward from the Sun.JPL's Dr. Jeffrey Plaut - co-principal investigator for the instrument - with Prof.Giovanni Picardi, principal investigator at the Universita di Roma in Rome, Italy,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"said: \"With the radar, we will try to detect boundaries between layers ofdifferent types of material. \"If there is a boundary between a rock-ice mixture atthe surface and a rock-water mixture at depth, it will reflect the radio waves andwe hope to detect it. We'll be looking for aquifers - subsurface reservoirs ofliquid water - but nobody really knows whether Mars has them.\"Richard Horttor, NASA Project Manager for Mars Express, said the radarinstrument, named the Mars Advanced Radar for Subsurface and IonosphericSounding, might also detect other types of layer boundaries, such as betweensediments and underlying volcanic rock, or between the polar ice caps andunderlying liquid water. This type of instrument, carried by aircraft, has detectedvast lakes under polar icecaps on Earth. It has not been used on another planet,though a similar instrument flew on an Apollo mission.NASA says additional instruments on the orbiter include a high-resolutionstereo color camera and an infrared mineralogical mapping spectrometer.Cooperation between American and European Mars missions extends to plansfor using Mars Odyssey to relay communications between Beagle 2 and Earthwhen Mars Express is not in good position to do so. The Mars ExplorationRovers will use Mars Express as a relay at least once as a demonstration for evenbroader international interdependence in future exploration of Mars.Two More American Rovers Are Expected to Launch June 8The United States is scheduled to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida twoMars Exploration Rovers on June 8.If all goes well, by late January 2004, there should be four Earth-made orbiterscruising in the atmosphere above Mars, the two American rovers searching onthe surface and the Beagle 2 lander digging into the Martian soils.We b s it e s :http://mars.jpl.nasa.gov/expresshttp://www.marsis.comCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
