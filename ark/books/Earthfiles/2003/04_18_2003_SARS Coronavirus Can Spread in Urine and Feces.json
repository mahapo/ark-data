The newvirus is related to coronaviruses that cause colds in humans and a variety ofserious diseases in mice, birds and pigs. But the gene sequence in the SARSvirus is so different, it's now classified as a brand new coronavirus in its owncategory that has jumped from animals to people and is contagious enough tohave spread to four continents since February. SARS spreads through closecontact, sneeze and cough droplets, and urine and feces - but does not appear tobe as easily airborne as influenza viruses.Today, the number of suspected SARS pneumonia cases went up in China,Canada, Singapore and other parts of the world to 3473 cases and 170 deaths.But the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta lowered its \"suspected\" Americancases of SARS from 220 down to 36 people who \"probably\" have the newdisease. The latest criteria for diagnosis are x-rays that show evidence ofpneumonia or respiratory distress such as damaged alveoli air sacs in the lungs.One of those probable CDC cases is in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. She is38-years-old, married with a young baby. Until late February, she was a healthyvegetarian who ran every day. Then she got sick with what she thought was abad flu. On February 25th, she was rushed to a hospital unable to breathe andwas put on a ventilator, like 10% of the SARS patients in China have been. Atfirst, she was also put in a negative flow room to prevent germs from spreadinginto the hospital because of SARS concerns, even though she had not traveledto Asia and did not know anyone who had."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"By the time her sister and mother arrived from their home states to the ChapelHill hospital, SARS was discussed as a possible explanation. But they weren'teven asked to put on gowns and masks. Her sister was reading about SARS atmy website, Earthfiles.com, and contacted me because she feels strongly thatpeople need to know the disease is here in the United States and is truly lifethreatening. Not only did her sister nearly die, but within 5 days of their firsthospital visit, their mother also contracted pneumonia. Yet there was no publicalert or effort to contact and quarantine her family, friends and work colleagues.The patient's sister, who works as a chemical and medical lab technician, hopedher sister could speak as a SARS patient tonight, but she still has troublebreathing. Instead her sister agreed to speak on the record with anonymity toprotect her family's privacy.Sister (from Ohio) of SARS \"Probable\" Patient in Chapel Hill, NorthCarolina: \"It was after getting x-rays and seeing the doctor that he finally toldthem that she did in fact have SARS and they knew it all along, but they wouldnot tell the family or her or her husband or anyone else that that was the case.He told her it was because the hospital didn't appreciate that kind of publicity.WHAT WAS YOUR AND YOUR FAMILY'S REACTION THAT THE DOCTORAND THE HOSPITAL WOULD BE CONCERNED ABOUT PUBLICITY INTHE FACE OF SOMETHING AS SERIOUS AS SARS?We were very upset that they withheld it from us. The first that we actually sawmy sister was 10 minutes to midnight on a Wednesday, and by Monday mymother was so sick. She was shaking violently, she was having chills, bodyaches, and it was just the way SARS started. And when she got home to herhome state and saw her doctor, he immediately started her on antibiotics and dida chest x-ray. She did have pneumonia.YOU AND YOUR MOTHER WERE NOT REQUIRED TO PUT ON GOWNSAND MASKS WHEN YOU WENT TO SEE HER?No. And no one around had gowns and masks on. No one was required to doanything except wash their hands upon entering and leaving the room. Therewas no barrier of any type to protect us from any airborne virus particles.\" How Does the SARS Coronavirus Spread?Where did the healthy young North Carolina mother get lung-damaging SARS?Why did her mother get pneumonia, but the visiting sister remained healthy?Why did more than 200 residents in the Amoy Gardens high-rise apartments ofHong Kong contract SARS - while others in surrounding apartment buildingsdid not? In addition to close contact with infected patients, how else could thisnew corona virus be spreading?Yesterday I asked Dr. David Heymann, M.D., Executive Director ofCommunicable Diseases at the World Health Organization in Geneva,Switzerland.David Heymann, M.D., Executive Director of Communicable Diseases atthe World Health Organization in Geneva, Switzerland: \"What weunderstand from Hong Kong is that what has occurred in the Amoy Gardens ispossibly from their studies related to their sewage system in the apartmentbuildings. In other words, they have found patients in Hong Kong and in fact inpatients around the world that patients do excrete the virus in their feces andalso in urine. So, their feeling is the sewage was contaminated and somehowcontaminated patients, people who now have the disease, in the toilets or thebathrooms.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Contagion from Close Contact with SARS-Infected Patients,Sneeze and Cough Droplets, and Urine and FecesIf the SARS virus can be on toilet seats or other surfaces where infected urineand feces are, how long is it contagious? I asked that question this morning toAlbert Osterhaus, Veterinarian and Director of the Department of Virology atErasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. His team announcedthis week that monkeys exposed to the coronavirus collected from SARSpatients became ill with the same SARS symptoms seen in humans.Albert Osterhaus, D.V.M. and Ph.D., Veterinarian and Virologist, Head ofthe Department of Virology, Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, TheNetherlands: \"It can remain infectious for a certain period of time. We don'thave all the figures yet, so all I can tell you is that we know from othercoronaviruses the animal coronaviruses that they can remain infectious inmaterial from patients, like stools, for days, and that depends on theenvironmental temperature. So if it is very warm, then the virus will degrademore rapidly than when it's around zero.SO THE CORONAVIRUS SARS, IF IT'S LIKE THE OTHERS, COULD BEVIABLE AS A CONTAGIOUS AGENT FOR SEVERAL DAYS?That's not impossible.SO WE'RE IN THE MOST DANGEROUS TIME RIGHT NOW BECAUSEPOPULATIONS EVERYWHERE DON'T CARRY ANY ANTIBODIES.Absolutely. I think it's what we call the 'virgin soil' outbreak - such a virusintroduced into a population that has no immunity. And that's the parallel with apandemic flu, although in a pandemic flu, the mortality rates are probably muchhigher.\" (SARS mortality rate is around 4%.) Dr. David Heymann, W.H.O.:\"HOW FAR DO YOU THINK THIS CAN SPREAD AND FOR HOW LONG?That's what we don't know. Our concern is that this would continue to spreadand become another human disease like tuberculosis or AIDS. What we hope isthat it can be contained and stopped and not continue to spread. It's a veryserious disease, especially for health workers who are the first in line to getinfected because they are taking care of infected patients. When you don't haveany drug to cure patients and we don't have any vaccine to prevent infection, theonly thing can you do is isolate patients and keep them from infecting others.SINCE NO ONE HAS SEEN THIS CORONAVIRUS BEFORE, COULD ITHAVE BEEN SOME BIOTERRORIST CREATION?Our laboratory group that met yesterday here in Geneva felt that this is in noway an engineered virus. This is a naturally occurring virus. Now the question is:where did it come from?\"In other words, which animals in Guangdong Province, China were the firsthosts for the new SARS corona virus? Where are they now? What is theirhealth? And how did the new virus get from those animals into humans and thenkeep spreading?More Information:SARS Virus Detection TestsThe next major step will be to produce a test which can detect the presence ofthe SARS virus in a patient's blood so doctors and hospital emergency rooms"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"can more quickly identify who needs to be quarantined and who does not. Intwo weeks, a new sensitive PCR test is expected to be developed which detectsthe SARS virus in a person's blood and will hopefully reduce the number offalse negative tests that have been a problem. Further, the antibody tests areconstantly being refined, but they are still tests that must be done later in theillness. Other Serious Infectious Diseases in HistorySARS is the first major new infectious disease to emerge in the 21st century but:a) AIDS entered the human population in the early 1980s and spreadworldwide.b) The Asian flu of the 1950s and the Hong Kong flu of the 1960s caused globalpandemics as well as high levels of death. What Are SARS Symptoms and What Should You Do?David Heymann, Executive Director of Communicable Diseases at the WorldHealth Organization (W.H.O.) in Geneva, Switzerland, recommends that anyperson who has:- a sudden fever above 100 degrees Fahrenheit that persists,- accompanied by a dry cough,- aching bones,- and difficulty breathing,- should go immediately to an emergency room.Patients who have received good hospital support care, including ventilators,have survived. In fact, the mortality rate of the SARS pneumonia is running onlyabout 3 to 5 %, but the potential severe lung damage in some of the casesdemands expert medical treatment and x-rays.SARS Suspected Cases as of April 19, 2003 Reported byCDC and W.H.O.
