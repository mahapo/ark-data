D., Director,Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Georgia March 30, 2003 Toronto, Ontario, Canada - The severe acute respiratorysyndrome, SARS, attacks the tiny alveoli lung sacs that get oxygen from theblood in normal healthy people. When alveoli are destroyed and eaten up, asSARS seems to do, people cannot get oxygen to breath and suffer acidosis, toomuch carbon dioxide in their blood. Until now, medical authorities have hopedthis new and still unidentified disease was not contagious through the air.But in less than a week, Toronto health officials have closed a second hospitalbecause the SARS pneumonia continues to spread despite quarantines, fuelinggrowing concerns that in fact the new pathogen can spread through the air.Toronto's York Central Hospital has been closed to new patients and hundredsof its employees have been asked to quarantine themselves at home for the nextten days in an effort to contain the ongoing outbreak of SARS. Toronto'sScarborough Grace Hospital was also closed to new patients on March 26, andemployees were asked to quarantine themselves at home. So far, SARS hasinfected 37 people in Canada and killed three.In addition to the hospital closings and quarantines, worried health officialsannounced Friday that international travelers flying from Toronto would bescreened for SARS symptoms. Toronto is a large Asian immigrant city, but otheraffected places have been Vancouver, British Columbia and Winnipeg,Manitoba. Carlo Urbani, M. D., Dies of SARSAlso yesterday, March 29, 2003, Dr. Carlo Urbani of the World HealthOrganization, who first recognized that a new and severe acute respiratorysyndrome had recently emerged in Vietnam and China, died of the mysteryillness. Dr. Urbani was an expert in communicable diseases and in early Marchtreated an American businessman hospitalized in Hanoi who also died of SARS.The presumption is that Dr. Urbani contracted SARS from that patient. Thecurrent W.H.O. case count worldwide for SARS is 1,610 and 57 deaths. Hong Kong SARS Cases Increase; Some Patients HaveRecuperated"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"People in Hong Kong are wearing face masks to helpprotect against the SARS pneumonia that might spread bothby air and close contact. Photograph © 2003 by Associated Press.In Hong Kong, 60 new SARS cases have been reported as of March 30, plusanother fatality. Many of the latest patients live in the same apartment complex.Medical experts still have not absolutely confirmed the identity of the SARSmicrobe and now wonder if the disease spreads through the air, as well as closecontact from sneeze and cough droplets. SARS might be a new mutation of aCorona virus which causes the common cold, or a new Paramyxo viru s t h atcauses measles and mumps - both of those virus families can spread through theair.W. H. O. is worried that the rapidly increasing case count in Hong Kong could\"start a chain reaction\" of newly infected people. One of the recent patients wasaboard Dragonair Flight KA901 from Beijing to Hong Kong on Wednesday,March 26, 2003. Hong Kong health officials are trying to find the other 222passengers and 15 crew to see if they have also been infected. Passengers on theairplane should immediately contact W. H. O. or the CDC, and both websiteswith contact information are listed at the end of this report.Some good news: as SARS is reaching epidemic proportions in Hong Kong, ninedoctors, nurses and medical students there who became ill with the pneumoniawere discharged from hospitals yesterday confirming that with adequate medicalcare, SARS can be overcome. Antiviral and Other Drugs Not Working Against SARSAt the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia yesterday, CDCDirector, Julie Gerberding, M. D., told a news conference, \"The global epidemiccontinues to expand. We recognize this is an epidemic that is evolving.\" CDCalso expanded its travel advisory to mainland China, Hong Kong, Singapore andVietnam, suggesting all such trips be postponed \"until further notice.\"Dr. Gerberding also emphasized that so far no drugs or treatments have beenfound to cure SARS. \"We have no evidence that any specific antiviral, steroidtreatment or other agents that are targeting this virus have any benefit topatients.\" One help has been ventilators and an estimated 10% of the SARSpatient population in Hong Kong and Vietnam have needed ventilator assistanceto breathe.As of March 30, 2003 United StatesSuspected SARS pneumonia cases in the United States have climbed to 62 in 23states.Alabama 1California 12Connecticut 1Hawaii 3Illinois 1"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Kansas 1Maine 2Massachusetts 1Michigan 2Missouri 2Mississippi 1Minnesota 2New Jersey 3New Mexico 1North Carolina 2New York 8Ohio 1Pennsylvania 3Rhode Island 1Te x a s 3Utah 4Virginia 4Wisconsin 1Total Suspected U.

Patients whohave received good hospital support care, including ventilators, have survived. Infact, the mortality rate of the SARS pneumonia is running only about 3 to 5 %,but the potential severe lung damage in some of the cases demands expertmedical treatment and x-rays.We b s it e s :http://www.who.int/en/ (World Health Organization)http://www.cdc.gov/ (Centers for Disease Control)"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
