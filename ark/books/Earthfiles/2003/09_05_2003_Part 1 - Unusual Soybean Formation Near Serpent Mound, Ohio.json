Upon seeing the strange pattern in thesoybeans, Delsey turned the car around and went back home for her camera.She also called a cousin who is very tall so he could help her get higher angledphotos of the crop formation. Delsey also called the Adams County Sheriff'sDepartment to see if there was a process for reporting crop formations. Thedeputy sheriff said there was not and that nothing could be done unless thelandowner filed a vandalism report.Finally through her father, a former deputy sheriff, Delsey was able to confirmwho the farm owner was and received permission to enter the field, along withher husband, Tony, and researchers Jeffrey Wilson, Ted Robertson, and RogerSugden, who contacted a pilot in order to take aerial photographs.Interviews:Crop formation investigator, Roger Sugden, flew to photographthe soybean pattern on the morning of Friday, August 29, 2003, five days after it wasreported.By then, paths had been made by the farm owner and researchers Jeffrey Wilson and TedRobertson.But the farmer said there were no paths or tracks in or around the formation when he firstinvestigated on August 27. Aerial photograph © 2003 by Roger Sugden.Delsey Knoechelman, mother of two daughters and co-owner with herhusband of the website design company, Knoechelman DevelopmentGroup, Peebles, Ohio: \"You can see from Roger Sugden's photographs ofFriday morning (August 29), the only paths into the crop circle (were made by)the farmer, Jeff Wilson, and Ted Robertson.My husband and I we were about the second group to go in and went out intothe field and helped them that morning to collect the data and everything.CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND SAW AS YOUWENT INTO THE FORMATION?Walking through soybeans is like walking through spaghetti. I spent more timetrying to protect the soybeans that I was trying to walk through to the pointwhere I was following what they call the 'sprayer lines.' Even that was anightmare. So, we are walking towards this design and I'm trying to separatethese crops to get through them and I was almost in the middle of the designbefore I realized I was there. You can't tell until you are right on top of itbecause of the particular lay of the land, the thickness of the crop andsometimes it went from waist to shoulder height.BECAUSE THERE WERE IRREGULARITIES IN THE FLATNESS OF THELAND?More in the crop. It is a very thick type of crop, thick and likes to run amongeach plant and they intertwine and it is very difficult to walk through.AS YOU WALKED AROUND IN THE PATTERN, DID YOU NOTICEANYTHING SPECIAL ABOUT THE SOYBEANS THAT WERE FLATTENED"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"- FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE 'PUPIL OF THE EYE,' COMPARED TO THESOYBEANS THAT WERE STANDING UP?The Vesica Piscis, or \"Eye,\" was green on one side where the clockwiselaid soybean plants reflected the sunlight one way, but brownish-gold on the other sidewhere the light reflected differently. The result was a half and half coloration that had aline running down the middle. Photograph © 2003 by Delsey Knoechelman.The plants had a very interesting design to the swirl. The 'eye' is shaped like afootball and there is yet a distinct line that goes right down the center. And yet,it still continues to swirl clockwise even though there is the center line.Right side of Vesica Piscis shows green while left side is golden-beige,an effect produced by the direction of the soybean leaves as they were swirled clockwise.Aerial photograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson and Roger Sugden.Another oddity was where all the crop would be going clockwise, we did findone particular plant was then woven back towards the other direction.GOING COUNTERCLOCKWISE?Ye s .No Tracks Around or In FormationBECAUSE THE FARMER DOES NOT WANT TO SPEAK PUBLICLY, DIDHE MAKE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT TRACKS SINCE HE WOULD HAVEBEEN THE FIRST PERSON IN THERE?Yes, he did and he said he did not see anything unusual. If anything, he mighthave caught animal tracks, but that was it. Deer run through there all the time.But he specifically said he never seen any tracks whatsoever.HAD HE EVER HAD ANY PATTERN LIKE THIS IN HIS CROPS BEFORE?No.IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE THAT STRUCK YOU AS UNUSUAL IN YOUREFFORTS TO WALK THROUGH THE FORMATION?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\"Chest Pressure\" Experienced by Some Inside FormationA couple of us kind of noticed on Friday, August 29, morning when we were thefirst ones, we were collecting data, we just kind of had a heavy feeling. Not allof us had it, just a few.HEAVY FEELING - CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU MEAN SINCE YOUFELT THAT HEAVINESS?It's kind of like a pressure where if you were starting to get heart burn in thatvicinity, and yet it is nothing like heart burn. It's just a pressure that you can feelin your abdomen and chest, like there is weight pushing down on you.\" To be continued in Part 2We b s it e s :http://www.cropcirclenews.comhttp://www.bertjanssen.nlhttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://home.clara.net/lucy pringlehttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://www.cccrn.cahttp://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.invisiblecircle.de and http://www.invisiblecircle.org/ser/d-archiv-2003.htmlhttp://www.kornkreise.chhttp://www.heramagazine.nethttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmhttp://www.bltresearch.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
