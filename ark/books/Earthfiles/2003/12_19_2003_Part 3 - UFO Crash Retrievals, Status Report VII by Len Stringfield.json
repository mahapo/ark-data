The Case of the Mosgrove Mandible John Mosgrove, a resident of Indiana, worked as a dental technician at theBrown Veterans Hospital in Dayton, Ohio, in 1979. He is proud of the facthe had won an award for adapting an effective guidance system, to reduceharmful radiation effects to patients receiving dental appliances. When he first called me March 30, 1993, he said that he was trying to findsomeone in a responsible position to hear out his story about dentalevidence with an alien connection and that a newspaper editor in Floridahad referred him to me. It was on a Thursday, Mosgrove recalls, a day normally slow, set aside forspecial training seminars, that he and a co-worker, who also worked on thenew radiation guidance system, were in their lab when the Chief of Staff ofthe dental clinic came in with an urgent assignment. According toMosgrove, the doctor removed from a well-packed container a dentalimpression of an anterior portion of mandible to form into a study model.This was a normal procedure, but he was further instructed to prioritize thejob and not to enter it into the records - which was not normal. This was the simple beginning of a day that ended in puzzlement anddisbelief. Once the model was formed and rinsed, he stood looking at itknowing it was not the mandible of a human being. Said Mosgrove, \"I'venever seen anything like it before or since. At first, yes, I felt excitement,but as reality set in, fear took over - a fear of something that I wasn'tsuppose to know about.\" To his good fortune, Mosgrove has a replica of the study model, but it wasnot a gift of the clinic. When the doctor came back to pick up the finishedproduct, he dutifully crunched up the impression and tossed the fragmentsinto the waste receptacle. Curious, Mosgrove's first reaction was to followthe doctor who went through the large swinging door of his quarters, nextto the reception office, and peered through its small window. In view weretwo USAF officers, one a colonel who placed the model into a containerand then stashed it into his briefcase. Both the officers shook hands withthe doctor and departed. Later, he learned that they were stationed atWright-Patterson AFB. But, the supposedly destroyed evidence becamepositive evidence. Mosgrove gathered the shattered pieces, took them to hishome workshop, and in four days reconstructed his own study model. Thanks to Mosgrove's trust, I now have a replica of the model which hesuggested I show to an anthropologist for scientific opinion. To me, itappears small by human standards. The toothless gum portion taperssharply to the cuspid region where one lone tooth is intact in the center,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the top surface of which is flat. In the posterior region are two molar-liketeeth, one each in opposite gums. They were not incisors, indicating meateaters, as the tops were round and flat. The remainder of the gum showswhat appears to be jagged indentations into where teeth might haveexisted. Mosgrove could only guess as to the reason for the missing teeth.\"Either they were extracted for study or had been knocked out as a resultof an accident.\" Model of unidentified mandible with flat teeth, no cutting surfaces, and \"radical-shaped\"jaw line, not U-shaped like a human's.

I have had several chats with Phillips, a formerUSAF dental technician at Wright-Patterson AFB, regarding his friend'sstudy model which he examined. In his opinion, the specimen is nothuman nor is it any other species of the anthropoidal family. He alsovouches for the integrity of Mosgrove. Having heard of Stan Friedman's UFO research on TV in 1990, Mosgrovesaid he made contact with him to share his dental discovery. Submitting adrawing of the mandible to him by mail, Friedman, after consulting adentist, responded with the comment that \"his story was interesting.\" ButMosgrove never heard from Stan again. Shown are two photographs taken by Phillips, with his comments aboutthe unidentified specimen compared with an adult human male mandible.Also is a sketch by Mosgrove which shows the portion of the mandible toform a study model and a hypothetical section of the posterior.Speculatively, this missing section might have provided more clues of analien interlocking system with the upper jaw or maxilla. Only the USAF medicos knew the purpose of their visit to Brown VetsHospital, picking a slow work day, to have a study model made in secrecyaway from their own facilities. Teeth! If the Mosgrove mandible is truly alien, it raises a number of issuesabout its origin, of its relationship with other types and even its agenda. To begin a good working hypothesis, it is no simple matter with limitedreliable information about alien physiology to take one body part, be itteeth, body liquid or the number of fingers and just say that the onesample, with or without teeth, are of different extraterrestrial origins withdifferent agendas. Nor is it simply said that the one with teeth and perhapsappearing more human might be the leader over the popular little greyswho are without teeth and digestive and alimentary systems. The little grey, without teeth in its small membranous cavity (mouth), areabundant in all close encounter cases such as abductions and also thoseretrieved from crashed UFOs. With minor exceptions, they all look and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"behave alike, which suggests they might be clones, robots or even acreature of a lower order from the same planet. But teeth existing in otherhumanoids, despite their rarity, is an important factor to consider if we areto find a meaning ultimately to an alien agenda. It is a teasing thought to postulate that an alien, appearing almost human,might have had a past affinity to Earth's Homo sapiens or some earlieranthropological creature. Furthermore, if we are willing to acceptMosgrove's mandible as evidence, we can only wonder if this alien typewhose \"molars\" are not incisors and thus, not flesh-eaters, if they chew softfoods or ingest liquid nutrients? Perhaps, they have reached theevolutionary state when incisors are atrophied and no longer vital tosurvival. While speculation can be fun, there is no substantive evidence tomake an educational appraisal. To augment the dental mystery is the case of the Arizona crash, in which atop official at Wright-Patterson AFB claimed that he knew of an alienbody (or bodies) that had been examined showing no teeth decay, and thecase of the informant describing aliens with round, flat teeth in the 1942east coast crash. There are other early-year cases which produced rumorsof aliens with perfect teeth whose lifespan exceeded Methuselah. But Ihave always relegated most of those stories as baseless. On a final, positive note, Mosgrove, in an attempt to identify the origin ofthe mandible, on November 4, 1993, called the doctor who gave him theassignment in 1979. Now on a staff of a Vets hospital in Chicago, heresponded, \"No comment. I still work for the federal government.\" To be continued in Part 4.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
