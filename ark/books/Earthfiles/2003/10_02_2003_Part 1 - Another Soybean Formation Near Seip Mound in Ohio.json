The newspaper reported that the two men \"were flying over the arearecently in their private plane and were surprised to see the designs cut into thisbean field. Local residents said they suspected young people on four-wheelershad made the design. Several other crop circles have been found in the area,including one discovered August 23 (correct date is August 24) near SerpentMound in Adams County. A third crop circle was recently found andphotographed near Seip Mound in Ross County.\" See 09/12/03 Earthfiles. The pattern in the aerial photograph is crisply laid out in 40-acres of soybeanssurrounded by Paint Creek, said to be the largest creek in the United States. Thecreek flows in a large heel-shaped loop around the soybean field and its water islined by tall trees. There are only two access points to the field and they are atleast a half mile from the nearest road that passes one of the landowner's homes.Then you still have to cross Paint Creek to get into the field. The circle of dense trees grow along the water of Paint Creek, Ross County nearBainbridge, Ohio, as it flows around the soybean field in which the three-armed patternwas createdby downed, woven and standing crops. Aerial photograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson. Delsey Knoechelman who discovered and first reported the August 24, 2003,Serpent Mound pattern that was also in soybeans, saw the newspaper article andcontacted field investigator, Jeffrey Wilson. On Saturday to Sunday, September27-28, Jeff, his team of investigators and several local volunteers set out toobtain permission from the soybean farm owners and to get out on the island tomake measurements, sample soil and plants and take a variety of instrumentreadings. Jeffrey Wilson, Independent Crop Formation Investigator, Master'sDegree in General Science, Dexter, Michigan: \"We managed to contact one ofthe land owners and had to do some convincing to get him to allow us into thefield. (Even with the newspaper's aerial photograph), he didn't believe at first"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"that there was any formation in the field. He finally took us out to the site andwe couldn't see the formation even from the edge of the field once you got ontothe island. We had to climb a tree to locate where it was in the field.There were no tracks whatsoever going into the formation itself. There were notramlines, no sprayer lines in the field, nothing like that whatsoever. We werethe first ones to make our way, rip our way, through that dense foliage ofsoybeans to get to where the formation was. We went around the entire field tolook for tracks.We did find one deer track that went into the field and found several deer beds,but found nothing else going into the formation. The aerial photos that wemanaged to obtain that people had taken before we got out there, they don'tshow any tracks. Other ones taken that show tracks are tracks that we made andothers made after we started investigating (on Saturday, September 27).Paint Creek Island, near Bainbridge in Ross County, Ohio, formationin soybeans about 30 miles from the Serpent Mound pattern - both probably occurredaround same date of August 24, 2003. Aerial photograph © 2003 by Dan Music and JeffreyWilson.WHY DO YOU THINK THIS PAINT CREEK FORMATION IS A MONTHOLD?There are multiple landowners that own this field at this point. I guess it's goingthrough a legal division. The first landowner took us out there the first day. Thesecond landowner we talked to on the second day of our investigation. He is apilot who owns a plane that he lands at a grass strip about a quarter-mile to halfa mile to the west of the island and flies over it quite regularly. He remembersone day back in late August where it had rained heavily early in the day untilabout noon. It cleared up and he flew over the field to land his airplane. Therewere no markings in the field.SO YOU'VE GOT A PILOT WHO CAN TESTIFY THAT HE HAD FLOWNOVER THE FIELD ON A SPECIFIC HOUR AND DAY AND THERE WAS NOPATTERN?Right. And the next morning, he flew back over the field and the formation wasthere.AND THAT WAS AUGUST 24?At this point, we're saying it's late August. He's trying to track down exactly the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"date and get back to us. We think it is roughly the same time as the SerpentMound formation. See 09/05/03 Earthfiles.Pattern in soybeans was 280 feet in diameter. Middle circle measured 90 feet across.Aerial photograph © 2003 by Dan Music and Jeffrey Wilson.WHAT WAS THE MEASURED DIAMETER FROM THE FURTHEST SIDEOF THIS PAINT CREEK PATTERN TO THE OTHER?It's roughly 280 feet by 280 feet by 280 feet if you consider it a triangularfeature, which is very comparable to the Serpent Mound formation that we wentto which was roughly the same size in its longest length, roughly 280 feet.The size being about the size of a football field that's a big formation to godown. Maybe they (formation-makers) need that much space to make thegeometry that is there. I don't know.To give you an example, the central circle in this new Paint Creek Islandformation the center circle was about 90 feet in diameter. When I got my startback in 1996, the very first crop formation I went to in Paulding, Ohio, which isin northwest Ohio that single circle was 90 feet in diameter. So, we've reallyexpanded the size of what we're looking at over the years. BEING A MONTH OLD, WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS PATTERN THATIMPRESSED YOU AS BEING IN THE CATEGORY OF THE MYSTERIOUS?We got to the formation and there weren't any tracks going in, no humanfootprints, no markings that made there way through the field. As inaccessible asit is, you can't see it from any road way. You have to walk at least half a mile toget to the field and then you've got to walk into the field and somehow manageto not make any markings. When we walked through the field as careful as wewere, we left tracks behind us.Second, we looked at the way the plants were laid down in the field. They wereall swirled clockwise and we found in the formation that there were severalareas that had multiple layers to them, up to four layers woven together. Wethink that would be extraordinarily difficult to weave together soybeans in the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"first place. You might be able to make a simple 2-layer pattern, but we don'tthink anybody could make a 4-layer pattern.We found, for instance, in the triangle of one of the arms to make the triangleitself, the plants were actually curved and bent at the proper angle to make thepoints of the triangle. It wasn't as if the plants were laid down flat and thenanother set of plants were laid down flat to make that angle of the triangle. Theplants were bent in that angle. You can't really bend soybean plants withoutsnapping the stalks. So we found that to be quite convincing.We also discovered the same kinds of leaf base damage that we discovered in theSerpent Mound formation. Again, we don't believe that is a hoaxable effect,although we're still studying the effects on soybeans from certain things and wecouldn't say for 100% sure, but we're pretty certain that's not a hoaxable effect.THAT IS WHAT APPEARS TO BE HEAT OR SCORCH OR DARKENING ATTHE BRANCHING OF THE SOYBEAN STEMS?Yes, that darkened, shriveled up affect.IN COMPARISON TO THE SERPENT MOUND FORMATION IN WHICHYOU FOUND ALL THE ANOMALIES THAT YOU WERE MEASURINGFROM THE MAGNETOMETER AND ELECTRIC FIELDS TO SOIL ANDPLANT ANOMALIES, WHERE DOES THIS NEW ONE FALL IN THECATEGORIES OF ANOMALIES THAT YOU HAVE BEEN ABLE TORECORD?It's been our experience over the last six or eight years doing the kinds ofmetered studies that we have done in terms of measuring for electric fields ormagnetic fields or measuring for radioactivity and things like that that we don'tfind any sort of anomalies after about ten days after the formation occurs forwhatever reasons. The measurable effects are very short-lived. So, for thisformation to be four weeks old, we didn't expect to find any of those anomalies,even though we did the tests. Even though I haven't done the statistical analysis,just eyeballing the numbers, it doesn't look like there are going to be anychanges there and we didn't expect to find them either (after so long).YOU HAVE STRESSED HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO MOVE THROUGH ASOYBEAN FIELD WITHOUT THE STEMS CRACKING AND BREAKINGOFF AND HERE IS A FORMATION THAT IS A MONTH OLD. AND YET, INTHE AERIALS, IT LOOKS EXTREMELY WELL-DEFINED AND CRISP,VERY SIMILAR TO THE SERPENT MOUND FORMATION, A MONTHLATER.Yes, it's quite interesting how formations can escape intact without any damagefor that length of time.ON THE GROUND, WAS THE CRISPNESS OF THE PATTERN THERE? ORIS IT ONLY A FUNCTION OF LIGHT ON THE PLANTS FROM THE AIR?No, it's pretty well defined, even on the ground. If you make the comparison towheat fields which show really well-defined patterns from one stalk down in thesame bundle of stalks that are standing up we found that to be the case even inthe soybeans. Even within the same grouping of plants along the planter line,half of them could be down and half of them could be standing. It was pretty"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"well defined.Some people talk about like sort of a 'veil' pattern where there will be singlestanding stalks of wheat that are separating two circles. That also happened withthis Paint Creek one. The triangular circles away from the central circle weredown almost to a single line of soybean plants that were still standing, kind of a'veil' effect there.ONE OF THE THINGS THAT FIRST HIT ME IN LOOKING AT ONE OF THEAERIALS THAT WAS A LITTLE FURTHER AWAY, I THOUGHT THERE ISTHAT MERCEDES HOOD ORNAMENT AGAIN. WHEN I SAY THAT, I'MREFERRING TO THE HOAX AT THE SEIP MOUND. Earthfiles 09/12/03.The circle feature that you're talking about is at the end of one of the arms. Thefeature there is standing crop and pressed down into the standing crop, there arethree arms that kind of come together in a 'Y.' That's what you are referring to aMercedes Benz type symbol. A lot of people are calling it a 'Peace' symbol, butit's not. If it were, it would have an additional arm going up between the Y. Butin this case, there are those three arms that make the Y, and then there is sort ofa half arc down below one of the arms of the Y.Diagrams based on aerial photographs© 2003 by Bert Janssen, The Netherlands.Bert Janssen: \"By far the most important point is the fact that all elementsin the Paint Creek, Ohio, formation are NOT random. All are connected to each otherthrough their geometry. The size and placing of all the elements follow strict geometricalrules."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"If one of the elements would haven been bigger or smaller or at a different spot, then thewhole geometry would have fallen apart.\"That feature is there and is part of the formation. The arc was about three or fourfeet wide and it started on the western most side and swirled in the directionclockwise to the eastern most side before it just ended. The plants are curved inon themselves to define the end of that little arc. The arms themselves are laiddown directed toward the edge from the center, and where all three of thosearms meet - that is one of the places where they are woven together, one inabout four different layers.THE PATTERN REMINDS ME OF FRACTAL ARMS EVEN IF THIS IS NOTTECHNICALLY A FRACTAL.It does have that curvature of the triple Julia Set or the formation that showedup at Knobel, Arkansas this year. See: 06/13/03 Earthfiles. The arms are curvedin the same direction. But I want to say this formation looks a little more similarto one that showed up in Kalispell, Montana a few years ago on August 14,2000. See 08/27/00 Earthfiles. That one had a central circle with three armscurved in the same direction with a circle at the end of each arm. That formationseemed a little more basic than this one (at Paint Creek, Ohio), but essentially asimilar geometry. It's a little more complex and defined than the Kalispell,Montana one, but I would compare it more to that than a fractal design.August 15, 2000, first aerial photograph of Kalispell/Whitefish, Montana wheat formationby pilot Gilbert Johnson near intersection of Highway 93 and Church Avenue.Photograph © 2000 by Gilbert Johnson."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Berwick Bassett, Wiltshire, England north of Avebury, discovered in wheaton May 28, 1994. Photograph © 1994 by Andrew King.COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE LAND ALIGNMENT ANDTHE FEATURES BETWEEN THE PAINT CREEK PATTERN AND THE SEIPMOUND?As best that we can tell from the aerial photos, we've been able to reconstructthe formation on an aerial satellite photo map and we believe at this point thatthe triangle in one of the outer arms, the easternmost arm, the point of thattriangle points in almost the perfect alignment with the central major mound inthe Seip Mound earthworks which is less than two miles away. The Seip Moundearthworks was a large area of earthworks in which only the major centralmound, which is about 35 feet high and about 60 feet high, is one of the fewremaining mounds that still exist at that earthworks site.Paint Creek island formation on left. Yellow line extends to Seip Mound about two milesaway.Satellite image and diagram produced by Delsey Knoechelman.THIS ALIGNMENT, OR PROXIMITY OF THIS NEW FORMATION, TO THESEIP MOUND IS SOMEWHAT ANALOGOUS TO THE SERPENT MOUNDFORMATION OF AUGUST 24 BEING ABOUT A HALF MILE OR SO FROMTHE SERPENT MOUND.The Paint Creek island itself upon which the formation sits has been known inhistoric times to have been the site of at least three different American Indianvillages over time. One of the landowner's homes sits on the site of a 2-tieredIndian platform mound that was destroyed within the last one hundred years.His grandfather destroyed half the mound constructing his house. Then therailroad built through the area and destroyed the other half of the mound, buthis grandfather put his house and basement right into where the mound was.That mound is about a quarter-mile away and Seip Mound is two miles away."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Satellite image © 2003 GlobeXplorer, United States Geological Survey,and titling produced by Jeffrey Wilson.HOW MANY MOUNDS IN TOTAL ARE THERE BETWEEN THE SERPENTMOUND AND THE SEIP MOUND IN BAINBRIDGE?That's a really difficult question because most of the mounds in Ohio have beenobliterated by agriculture. In the valley where Paint Creek is all the way toChilicothe, there are more than 50 mound sites and several are large geometricmound sites that exist in about a 10 to 12 mile line down this valley. One of themaps I sent you is from 1847 by Squire and Davis that shows a six mile sectionof the Cave Creek Valley.Squire & Davis map dated 1847 of the Paint Creek Valley in Ohio that containsat least fifty ancient mounds between the Seip Mound labeled \"A\" and Chilicothe about tenmiles east.On the farthest west or left side of the map, is the Seip Mound earthworks. Andright where the 'A' is, that long oval feature inside the geometric part, is themound that is left that we think is in alignment with this Paint Creek formation.The mounds, the little black dots just to the east of that Seip Mound earthworksenclosure, are known as the Dill Mounds. All of these are Hopewell Indian"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"mounds. The road that is on the map the Milford and Chilicothe Turnpike justto the north of the Seip Mound is now what is known as U. S. Route 50.Eastern half of the Squire & Davis map dated 1847 of the Paint Creek Valley in Ohio.As we continue towards the east, toward Bourneville (on old map, Bournville)on U. S. Route 50, the old Milford and Chilicothe Turnpike, just before you getto Bourneville - just southwest of Bournville - is the next major moundenclosure there. That is the Baum earthworks. That is also another Hopewellfeature that has been completely obliterated by agriculture. Just across the PaintCreek from whee the Baum earthworks are located is the hoaxedMercedes-Benz symbol that showed up just between U.S. Route 50, or theChilicothe Turnpike, and where the Baum earthworks is. Then as we continuefrom where the Baum earthworks are and we keep going east, the next featurebelow Paint Creek on the map is \"Fortified Hill.\" That is also known as SpruceHill, which is one of the hilltop enclosures that in this case is unusual in the factthat it is a stone enclosure, rather than an earthworks enclosure, which is veryrare to find in Native American sites.The feature just below Spruce Hill that kind of oval with the lines radiatingupward from it has also been obliterated and I don't think that feature has everbeen named. So, that six miles there has several major earthworks that were veryimportant to the Native American culture.If we continued west off the map, less than a mile or two, we would get to wherethe new Paint Creek formation is.THE QUESTION IN 2003 IS WHY IS SOMETHING TRYING TO FOCUSOUR ATTENTION ON THE SERPENT MOUND AND THE SEIP MOUNDAREA?Yeah, that's a good question. Although we might not have been paying attentionin previous years. Less than a mile from where this Paint Creek formation camedown across Route 50 to the south is the site of a crop formation that camedown in the year 2000. There were three circles in that formation two of themhad rings around them. Really, it was in close proximity to the Seip Mound andwhere the Paint Creek formation came down."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The landowner who is the pilot who spotted the formation back in late August,also told us this island itself has been the site of crop circles just about everyyear since he was a kid. He's in his 50s now. He said he has been seeing two orthree single circles not more than 18 or 20 feet in diameter show up just aboutevery year. He said he has never reported them because he thought they werenatural affects due to whirlwinds. He never took a picture of them and he neverreally reported anything like that. So, maybe this has been going on for awhile,but we just haven't been paying attention.WOULD THOSE HAVE BEEN IN SOYBEANS OR A DIFFERENT KIND OFCROP?He said that he has seen them in both soybeans and wheat. Although, theformation that came down in 2000 across Route 50 was in wheat.WHAT ABOUT THE INTEREST IN GETTING IN TOUCH WITH YOU BYTHE MAYOR OF BAINBRIDGE?On my way home from the formation on Monday of this week, I got a call fromthe Mayor of Bainbridge, Ms. Rocky Countryman, who had read about ourwork at the Serpent Mound formation and wanted to notify us of this newformation that had been reported and wondered if we could come down andtake a look at it. So, I called her back and we had a very nice conversation. Shesaid if anymore came down in her area, she's going to notify us. So, this is reallythe first time we've had any governmental interest local or otherwise that wouldreport formations to us. So, I think maybe we are turning a little bit of a cornerin terms of some recognition that there is someth ing more going on than just thatthese are all hoaxes, because clearly they are not. This mayor is open mindedenough and interested enough in finding out what is going on that she wouldgive us a call to come down and do our research.WHAT ABOUT THE AREA OF UNUSUAL SOUNDS OR LIGHTS? HASANYONE REPORTED ANYTHING WITH THIS PAINT CREEKFORMATION?We did manage to get 2 reports of unusual sounds associated with this formationabout the time of the formation. The landowner who is the pilot reported to usthat he heard a mechanical sound very similar to a 4-stroke engine humming orrunning in the area of where the island is while he was sitting in his hot tub athis house about a quarter-mile away. It lasted for about two hours that night. Henoticed it enough that he was concerned he might have to go back there and findout what was going on, but he didn't see any lights and didn't go to check it out.The motor sound that he is describing, he said that what was unusual about itwas no revving of the engine. The cadence was exactly the same the entire time,the sound did not go up or down or change in any way. It was like a monotonemechanical sound constant for about 2 hours."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"We also got the same description by another woman who lives to the west of theisland by about a mile or mile and a half and about at the same time.HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A STEADY DRONING MOTORASSOCIATED WITH CROP FORMATIONS BEFORE?Not exactly. There have been a handful of anecdotal reports of sounds beingassociated with crop circle formations. There was one that happened earlier thisyear in the state of New York in which the researchers who were there at thescene interviewed the local neighbors to where a randomly downed formationcame down. They described being awakened in the middle of the night by a3-toned harmonic sound that was loud enough to wake up just about everyonein the neighborhood around that area. Then, the next morning they found therandomly downed formation in the field.There have been other similar reports of different types of sounds associatedaround crop formations, but not in every case. So we are not sure what thesound means, or if it is indeed associated with the formation at Paint Creek.\"Triskelion, the Greek symbol of the sun in motion.The Triskelion (Greek for three legs) is a symbol of the sun intended to expressmotion. The design is common in old Celtic artwork and is often referred to as aCeltic Triskele (TRY-skeel). The Triskele has a varied history culturally, being used as a symbol in Celtic,Asian, Italian and Greek cultures. The Triskele is a common symbol used inancient Celtic design throughout Northern Europe and is especially associatedwith the Isle of Man where the ancient College of Druids was centered.Triskele is also one of Sicily's symbols that first appeared on the coins of ancientSyracuse. Also called the Triskelion, it is an ancient sun symbol. There is onemajor difference between the Sicilian and Celtic triskele. The Sicilian legs arebare and the Celtic legs are armored.
