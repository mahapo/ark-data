March 10, 2003 Cambridge, Massachusetts - Four thousand miles downbelow our planet's surface is the center of the earth's iron core, depicted asbrown in the illustration below. There is so much pressure there that the iron ishard from the center outward for about 746 miles (1200 km). But then it beginsto melt and flow like porridge cooking in the yellow area that pushes upward asorange magma. That moving, melted iron also produces the magnetic fields thatsurround the earth and upon which much of earth's surface life, satellites andspace technology depend upon for orientation and for protection. If magneticfields did not trap highly energetic particles racing from the sun, all kinds ofdamage could be done to living organisms and space technologies.From the Earth's crust, which averages only about 28 miles (30 km)thick, to the center of the iron core is 3,959 miles (6,371 km). The melted iron core beginsaround 1,794 miles (2,886 km) down. Image © by Gary Glatzmaier.For 800,000 years, magnetic field lines have been coming out of the south poleand entering the north pole of the earth. That is called the magnetic dipole. Butnow scientists are monitoring the strongest change ever recorded in the magneticfield at the surface of the Earth's iron core. The result is that the southeastern tipof Africa now has a magnetic field pointing in the opposite direction from therest of the earth's magnetic dipole, and it is getting stronger all the time,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"according to satellite data.Further, the North and South Pole magnetic fields have weakened in strength byabout 10% of what they once were. If the South African region continues to getstronger and the North and South Poles keep getting weaker, scientists think thatwithin the next millennia, the current poles could flip - or reverse - so themagnetic field lines would leave the north pole and enter the south pole.Based on ancient rock studies, geophysicists say that such magnetic pole flipshave occurred three or four times every million years in the Earth's history. Now,there is a new Hollywood movie that opens this coming Friday called, \"TheCore.\" The story is that something dramatic happens at the center of the Earththat causes a sudden change in the melted iron core and the magnetic field doesnot simply reverse, but disappears. In the movie, people with pacemakers dropin the streets, birds that depend upon the magnetic field for navigation falldisoriented from the skies, and huge lightning bolts hit Rio de Janeiro and theGolden Gate Bridge.Today I asked Harvard University geophysicist, Mathieu Dumberry, in theDepartment of Earth and Planetary Sciences, if such a magnetic field collapsewith catastrophic effects is scientifically feasible.Interview:Mathieu Dumberry, Graduate Student Assistant to Prof. Jeremy Bloxham,Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, Harvard University,Cambridge, Massachusetts:\"One idea that has been around for a long time is: if we do have a collapse of amagnetic field or if the strength of the field itself will decrease, then what will bethe consequences for life on Earth? The magnetic field has the property that itprotects us from the highly energetic particles coming from the sun that gettrapped in magnetic field lines and then create these northern lights.But, if the magnetic field strength is reduced, then perhaps more of theseparticles will reach the surface. So, in the terms of potential dangers associatedwith the magnetic field, that is the possibility.ARE THERE ANY EARTH RECORDS THAT INDICATE THERE HAS EVERBEEN A COMPLETE COLLAPSE OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THEEARTH?No. In all the rocks that would preserve a magnetic field that we have, theyshow evidence, but there was not a collapse of magnetic field in the past. In fact,we have rocks that date to 3.5 billion years ago that is quite early in Earth'shistory which show already the presence of the magnetic field. So, the magneticfield has been around with us for quite awhile. And if the magnetic field wouldsomehow die away, I'm not sure how you can restart it.But if the magnetic field is present, then the fluid motion acts in a way toregenerate constantly that magnetic field.IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT IF THE MAGNETIC FIELD OF THE EARTH DIDSUDDENLY COLLAPSE AND WAS NO LONGER THERE, THEN EARTHLIFE WOULD BE DAMAGED AND KILLED BECAUSE OF WHATMAGNETIC FIELDS DEFLECT FROM THE EARTH NOW SUCH ASSOLAR RADIATION AND SO FORTH COULD THEN REACH THESURFACE OF THE EARTH UNABATED?I'm not a biologist I'm not sure the affects on life would be. I don't think it isquite fair to say that everything would be wiped out. What would happenthough is that some of the genetics might be altered because some of theparticles coming from the sun are essentially equivalent to radioactive particlesand these act on the DNA of life and somehow they change the recipe. Butspecies will survive, they will just survive in a different way. They will adapt to"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"new conditions. That's essentially the process of evolution. If you make thingssuddenly colder, then the species which are best prepared to deal with a colderenvironment will preferentially survive over the ones that are not.WHY DO YOU THINK IN THE POPULAR CULTURE THAT THE PHRASE,'POLE FLIP' HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH SOMETHINGTREMENDOUSLY DAMAGING TO THE EARTH?In the great scheme of things, a polarity flip would certainly change things. I'mnot sure in what way exactly, but it would have an effect and it's unclear if wewould survive if the magnetic field should disappear. But I can guarantee thelisteners right now that the magnetic field is not about to disappear.The last change in polarity occurred about 800,000 years ago. Humans werearound, but not in the form we are today. But they were around and theysurvived through that, too. Although we don't know exactly how such a changein polarity would affect us, we can be confident that we will go through it.Also, an additional point, it turns out the magnetic field tries to reverse moretimes than it actually succeeds. As I said before, we see in the geology recordthat the magnetic field reverses three or four times per million years. It actuallytries to reverse perhaps 10 times that much, but very often it just doesn'tsucceed. So, the amplitude of the dipole field seems to decrease, but yet itbuilds back up in the same polarity afterwards.THE HYPOTHESIS ABOUT WHY THESE CHANGES IN THE POLES OFTHE EARTH WOULD OCCUR IN THE FIRST PLACE, IS RELATED TO THEFLUID DYNAMICS OF THIS MELTED IRON CORE INSIDE THE EARTH?Yes, that's correct.I'M TRYING TO IMAGINE IN MY OWN MIND RIGHT NOW IF THERE IS ACENTRAL CORE AND IT'S MELTED AND IT'S INSIDE THE EARTH ANDIT CAN'T REALLY MOVE ANY PLACE. WHAT DO YOU HYPOTHESIZECOULD BE HAPPENING AT THE CENTER OF THE EARTH THAT WOULDEVEN CAUSE ANY OF THESE POLE FLIPS?Oh, the answer to that question is unknown, to be short. But it's not, in a sense,surprising that the magnetic field reverses. You can do simple experiments withjust moving discs and wire and looking at the constant movement of these discsand somehow you end up with a magnetic field that is behaving chaotically. In asense, we are not surprised that the magnetic field reverses in a chaotic fashiononce in awhile. In terms of the fluid dynamics or fluid motion of the core andhow that fluid motion essentially triggers a reversal, that we don't understand.\"We b s it e :http://www.psc.edu/science/glatzmaier.htmlhttp://www.ems.psu.edu/info/explore/EarthMag.htmlhttp://www.jpl.nasa.gov/releases/2003/32.cfm (New data about Mars liquidiron core.)Credits"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
