Smith, Freedland Publishers Chapter 4, Part Two -The UFO Mystery he actual cause of that total Northeast electrical blackout of 1965 of whatwas supposed to be a completely \"fail-safe\" grid has never been satisfactorilyexplained. The explanations that have been given have the appearance of acover-up. Shortly after that, there were widespread and suspicious poweroutages in Wyoming, Utah, Nebraska, Colorado, New Mexico, Minnesota andTexas, as well as abroad in Italy, Peru, England, Finland, the Netherlands, SaudiArabia, Argentina and Mexico. (Aliens from Space © 1973 by Major Donald E.Keyhoe (USMC) Ret.) There have been persistent reports of radio contact with UFOs and claims thatsuch contact is fairly common. While a few scientists are giving public thoughtto using expensive equipment to communicate with remove stellar systems, itmight be that ham operators and teenagers with cheap walki-talkies areaccomplishing essentially the same thing much closer to home. There are evenclaims that ordinary radios have received UFO communication - when the powerswitches were off! Some of these alleged UFO communications might be hoaxes, but using theairwaves for such hoaxes seems too serious an offense for a ham operator to risklosing his license over. In January of 1954, people throughout the Mid-Westheard a strange voice on their radios, some of which were turned off. \"I wish noone to be afraid,\" the voice warned, \"although I speak from outer space. But ifyou do not stop preparations for war, you will be destroyed.\" A similar messagewas picked up in London. (UFO Report, Winter 1975, article by John A. Keel) On August 3, 1958, having been previously tipped off by contactees, hamoperators throughout the U. S. reported picking up something strange on the 75meter international band. One ham called it, \"the most powerful signal everpicked up.\" It lasted for two and a half hours and was repeated in English,German, Norwegian and the spokesman's own language that listeners describedas a \"musical gibberish.\" Listeners had time to call friends and neighbors, even inother states. It was the same message that preparation for nuclear war wouldlead mankind to disaster. Several weeks later, the U. S. fired a series of highaltitude nuclear devices over the Pacific. (UFO Report, Winter 1975, article byJohn A. Keel) Sometimes while UFOs are being seen in an area, a rapid fire gibberish thatsounds like a speeded up recording can also be picked up at very lowfrequencies. Americans and Russians have ultra expensive and ultra secretequipment operating at those frequencies, allegedly to communicate withsubmarines. Some independent researchers wonder if they might be designedeither primarily or secondarily to intercept more exotic messages."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Another aspect of the UFO phenomena is the contactee, those who claim tohave seen UFO occupants, or to have communicated telepathically with them, orto have been aboard their ships. What is their story? What kind of creatures dothey claim to have met? As a rule, they are represented as shy, retiring,non-violent folks who scramble aboard and take off like a flash as soon as theyhave been observed sampling the soil, water, plant life, or garden produce. thistype tends to be somewhat elfin, four feet tall or less, in metallic jumpers andsometimes helmeted. They appear very strong, wiry and tough enough that beingbowled over by a shotgun blast does not seem to seriously hurt them. Some are said to be tall, with high foreheads, intellects and principles. Otherslook and act so normal and nonchalant they could easily pass for a neighborliving across town - as some contactees claim they often are. Or others might bea mixture of those types aboard a ship. What appears to be a universal characteristic among them, or at least amongtheir contactees, is an equality of sex. the pilot is as likely to be a woman as aman, some of which are said to be extremely attractive, and none have beendescribed as downright ugly. On the other hand, people have apparently beenterrified by monsters accompanying UFOs, large, horrible, and even horriblysmelling apparitions that sometimes send the dogs yowling home to cower underthe bed for a few days. Wherever there's a real communication, the message seems to be the same. Theyare peaceful people from up in the sky somewhere, are concerned about ourdestructiveness, and almost invariably about our nuclear capabilities.Apparently they all think that's something we can't handle. Nor, apparently, canall contactees handle their UFO experiences, since some seem to have sizableblocks of time unaccountably missing from their memories. It is claimed thatunder hypnosis and other techniques, it has been shown these persons weretaken aboard UFOs and subjected to intense, but gentle physical examination.(The Interrupted Journey © 1966 by John A. Fuller.) Sometimes contacts with UFOs, or even seeing them, has been a severelyupsetting experience leading to emotional distress, inability to hold a job, or afamily, even to premature deterioration and death. A few contactees areapparently elated by their alleged meetings with extraterrestrials. At least asmany and probably more have found their contacts profoundly disturbing. Forbetter or for worse, it seems to be a watershed type of experience from whichone is never the same afterward. One's inward orientation is altered, maybediscovered, by just as likely lost. One of the more bizarre aspects of all this is the so-called MIB syndrome (MenIn Black). Some private UFO investigators who feel they might have gotten tooclose to the heart of the thing claim they have been shadowed, or interviewed, orthreatened by some mysterious Men In Black who come and go in big blackBuicks, or Chryslers, or Cads without lights or license plates under the mostdisconcerting circumstances. Whether these visitors represent UFOs, or the AirForce, or the CIA, or are even more immediate emissaries of hell, has never beenmade perfectly clear to the public. (They Knew Too Much About Flying Saucers© 1956 by Gray Barker and Saucer News, Fall-Winter 1968-69.) The easiest assumption is that those characters are CIA undercover agents atwork in their dirty trick category. If so, they can at least be credited with amorbid sense of humor. There are times, however, when the threats get toointernal and psychic for that explanation to adequately cover the circumstances.That is, unless the CIA knows how to effectively stick pins in dolls. It could wellbe that all of the parties interested in UFOs - heaven, earth and hell - find MIBsoccasionally useful. These and other phenomena surrounding UFOs and cattle mutilations, aredistinctly uncanny and otherworldly. They tell us that whoever goes here mustskate quickly over very thin ice and be prepared at any time to start swimming in"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"some very chilling water. What these things are all designed to do, in essence, issupply a powerful impetus toward judgment - an explication and analysis ofwhat's primarily inside us and really makes us go. The important and reallydeterminate thing is not what's \"out there.\" It's what's \"In here\" that is ultimatelyrewarding or terrifying. Nothing appears more evident or more frustrating to UFO buffs than the fact thatinformation on the subject is being distorted and concealed, not only in the U.S. and Russia, but by authorities the world over. This, of course, is vigorouslydenied. Also it seems impossible to pinpoint the source of this censorship, if itexists, or to agree on the reasons for it. There's the old saw that the public would panic if they discovered the earth wasunder surveillance by aliens from outer space. That's ridiculous in view of thefact that a large and vocal part of the population believes that any way and agreat majority of the people strongly suspect it. That argument can't hold waterwith anyone who has the least faith in the democratic processes or believes thatthe people have the right to know and to make their own decisions and are alsocapable of doing that. Many UFO sightings are profoundly, even shockingly, convincing. There areinstances on record of that happening to generals, admirals, congressmen,senators, and cabinet members. When people of that rank look to the Air Forcefor an explanation only to discover that their so-called investigation is reallynothing but a flim flam, a whitewash, and way of explaining reports away bymaking them appear ridiculous, they have been known to hit the ceiling.Nevertheless, it's interesting to notice that nothing ever comes of that. There's nopublic breast-beating or congressional probe that really blows the lid off thething. Why? Admittedly those who are in a position to oversee all U. S. intelligence andknow in detail the purpose and results of any secret study or installation, know alot more than the rest of us know. Why, for example, are all military personnelshut up, sworn to secrecy and threatened if they talk about UFO activity theymight have seen? It's an open secret that fighters pursue and try to down UFOs,that several have crashed and others have disappeared completely from the radarscreens monitoring the interception with no trace of them being found. These aresecrets that military security keeps out of the news. (UFO Report, Winter 1975,article by Stanton T. Friedman.) Until the late 1960s, the Air Force maintained Project Blue Book to receive andinvestigate all UFO reports. It was a pitiful operation, manned by a few harassedjunior officers and non-coms, with a basic questionnaire that was \"amateurish,almost cleverly designed in certain cases to get the wrong answer and lose trackof the facts.\" (Congressional Record, July 29, 1968, testimony by Dr. DonaldH. Menzel.) It's obvious now that Project Blue Book was only a cover. For mostof its life, it was probably an unwitting cover. That, of course, is by far the bestkind. Many of the people most interested in UFOs, for example NICAP (nationalInvestigations Committee for Aerial Phenomena), the best known and mostrespected of the private investigative groups, headed by Major Donald E.Keyhoe (USMC Ret.) a prolific writer on the subject, seem to have something ofa vendetta with the Air Force. Or more accurately, it might be with the CIA forthe constant whitewashing, stonewalling and subversion of all accurate publicknowledge on the subject. There's more to it than that, however. So we'd dowell to be more sympathetic to Air Force Intelligence and try to understand thedifficulties of their point of view. Major Keyhoe, with numerous high level military and Washington contacts,reports that it is the \"CIA's belief that the public can never be prepared,\" for thetruth about UFOs. \"But accepting such a hopeless attitude is a grave mistake.\"He also goes on to say that: \"At first, it might seem too difficult for our world toaccept alien beings - even if they are similar to us. But continuing to mislead the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"public will only increase the problems, leaving our people unprepared for anylandings and contacts.\" (Aliens from Space © 1973 by Major Donald E. Keyhoe(USMC) Ret.) Before joining in such a blanket condemnation of the USAF and the CIA, weshould consider that the highest intelligence services have access to far morefactual information than anyone else has, things that Major Keyhoe and his likeminded critics don't know. We must assume that they have learned from hardfactual evidence that the truth is such that the general public can never beprepared for it, and that the situation is in fact that hopeless, that UFOsrepresent the ultimate force, the armies of heaven, the heavenly hosts. And theirpurpose for coming here is to administer the ultimate poison to the powers ofthis present world and terminate this planet as a place for human habitation.
