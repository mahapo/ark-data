Meeting themin the field was Ted Robertson, a harpsichord craftsman volunteering to helpwith the survey and sampling work. The group had obtained permission from thefarm owner via Delsey Knoechelman to enter the field. Jeffrey estimates he hasbeen in more than 100 United States formations since his first investigation ofthe Paulding, Ohio pattern in 1996. \"Geometrically, the Serpent Mound patternis one of the most sophisticated that we've seen,\" he told me this week, and alltheir electronic testing and plant sampling have shown statistically significantanomalies. See Earthfiles, Part 3.Jeffrey Wilson, Independent Crop Formation Investigator, Master'sDegree in General Science, Dexter, Michigan: \"Seeing crop formations insoybeans is relatively rare. I've got about 250 or so reported formations in theUnited States and I want to say there are less than ten that have been insoybeans over the years.Soybeans is a tough crop to make your way through. It's a vine-like plant, sowhen you wade your way through the stuff which is about chest high, it isdifficult to make your way. You almost have to rip your way as you are walkingthrough the plants.Waist-high soybean field, looking at one of the rings east of the Vesica Piscis, or \"eye,\"in the Serpent Mound formation.

First of all, when you are inside the formation itself, the plants that aredown this formation is so large that when you are standing in any one of the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"circles, you cannot really see any part of the rest of the formation. It is very flatground there. Maybe only a four foot elevation across the entire formation (of271 feet length). You can't get up high enough to see any other part of it.No Tracks or Pathways to Four Small CirclesWhen we walked around to map out the formation while we were on theground, none of the four, small single circles in the formation had any pathwaysleading into them, including sprayer line pathways or pathways connected to theflattened rings or by people walking into them. There just was not anything thatwould allow us to get into those four, small circles. In one in particular, which isthe extreme left circle which is just underneath the two large rings that circlewas at least 15 feet from any access point where we had to cross into it.WHICH EMPHASIZES THAT SOMETHING INTERACTED WITH THOSEPLANTS THAT DID NOT LEAVE ANY TELLTALE FOOTPRINTS, POLEPRINTS OR ANY THING ELSE.That's correct, yes.Soybean Plants Inside Formation Exposed to Heat?In looking at the plants themselves, we normally would look at the growthnodes in cereal crops. But in this case, soybeans are a little bit different. Theydon't really have analogous growth nodes like on a wheat plant where youwould see elongation of the growth node or see expulsion cavities.In this case in soybeans, what we did find though is where those branches stemoff at the side of the plant that's called a leaf base we found there was a collapseand what we are calling necrosis setting in of the surface layer of cells called theparenchyma tissue. We've done a couple of cross sections where we've looked atthat leaf base versus controls. There is a clear layer of damage from whateverenergies hit the plants and heated up those cells.Normal soybean leaf base sampled as a control for comparison to plants gatheredfrom inside the Serpent Mound formation.

Photograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson and Charles Lietzau.What typically happens in the field crops is that the vessels that carry themoisture through the plants those heat up and it creates a pressure that explodesout of the growth nodes of the plants. But in this case, the layer of parenchymacells is much thicker in soybeans and acts as a kind of cushion and doesn'tactually reach the vessels that would carry that moisture. So, it's only that layerof damage that we see in these plants, again suggesting heating.Brown, damaged areas were mixed among the still-growingsoybean plants laid down clockwise in the large outer ring of the formation.Photograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson.Tony Knoechelman lifts up top layer of soybean plants to show othersoybean plants flattened in a perpendicular direction beneath the surfaceclockwise flow of the formation.

They are estimating around 230 million years ago ameteorite hit this area and shattered the bedrock for about a 5 mile radius andturned over some of the bedrock. Serpent Mound itself, which lies about 3,000feet to the east of this formation....A LITTLE OVER A HALF MILE.Right up on top of a 100-foot-high ridge is the western area of the impact site.The whole area is a spider web of faults and deformations. There actually is acontact fault that runs into this field about 50 feet to the north of where thisformation is and then it makes a severe bend and goes to the south, cuttingthrough Brush Creek that runs along adjacent to this field. As we know ingeometries, when you have faulting going on, there can be this piezoelectriceffect that may be responsible for some of the electromagnetic effects that wesee, although we are not certain.COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN THE ORIENTATION OF THE PATTERNTO THE SERPENT MOUND'S TAIL THAT YOU MENTIONED?The formation clearly has a central axis point. You have four circles spacedaround this Vesica Piscis where you can draw a line through the east circle,through the ring, through the center of that to the west circle and if youextended that line toward the east, that would run through the swirled tail of theserpent on Serpent Mound.SO, WE HAVE A GEOGRAPHIC ALIGNMENT THROUGH THE CENTERSOF THE CIRCLES IN THE FORMATION GOING RIGHT INTO THESPIRALED TAIL OF THE MOUND.Correct. And we confirmed that both visually and with our GPS units.Green arrow points at the soybean formation through early morning mist.Thin black line extends from the formation to lower right beige clearing which is the tail oftheSerpent Mound.

The center of this smaller circlewas offset from true center. Eccentric deviations of the crop swirled centers were foundin the other three small circles as well. Photograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson.WHAT EQUIPMENT DID YOU USE?We run a battery of tests. We have a standard protocol when we go into a cropcircle. The kind of tests that we do:1) We take plants that are down inside a formation and we compare them againstplants that are away from the formation, normal control plants.2) We take soil samples and typically send them off to a lab for analysis.3) I use a Geiger counter to measure radioactivity.4) I use a Tri-field Natural Electromagnetic Meter to measure the magnetic fieldstrength in micro Teslas.5) I measure the electric field strength in volts per meter.6) I measure the radio microwave emission in watts per meter squared.7) There is an additional one that we can use called a \"sum,\" which sums up oradds together the change in both the magnetic field and radio/microwave.8) We take GPS (Global Positioning Satellite) readings around the formation toget an approximate latitude and longitude and an elevation.We did all of those tests. I want to say this is the first formation that we havedone all these tests in that every one of the tests that we have run so far cameback statistically significant, which means that every one of the tests we didinside of the formation when we compared them to the numbers that we took asa control, everyone of them was anomalous versus the controls.IN THE PROCESS OF TRYING TO GET THESE MEASUREMENTS, WHATKIND OF PROBLEMS DID YOU HAVE WITH YOUR EQUIPMENT?We did have two equipment problems and we're really not sure at this point if itwas a result of energy in the formation or not. But, Roger (Sugden) had troublewith his digital camera in the south circle. While he was trying to take pictures,his camera actually heated up very rapidly and he pulled the batteries out of itand they were hot to touch. He never had that happen before.WHICH WOULD SUGGEST POSSIBLY THE PRESENCE OF SOMETHINGLIKE MICROWAVE RADIATION?Possibly. Well, we did pick up an emission of microwave energy which we'veactually never had before. we've never picked up anything in radio andmicrowave in any other formation that we've looked at. It was slight. I don'tthink we picked up more than .4 watt/meter, but when you are comparing that tooutside the formation which was zero, then we definitely have something there.And right after that, I usually use two GPS units kind of as a control, so we havea double check. And one of the GPS units that was being held by Ted Robertsonat the time, as we walked out of the formation just past the south circle, the GPSunit that he was holding, the electronics just fried right out.WHAT KIND OF ENERGY COULD DO THAT?To be honest with you, I'm not sure, but it would have to be an electroniccomponent that would override the circuitry and cause that malfunction.SO BOTH THE HEATING UP OF THE CAMERA AND THE BATTERIESAND THE GPS GOING OUT AND THE ELECTRONICS BEING FRIED THEY WOULD IMPLY THERE WAS SOME KIND OF HEATING ENERGYSTILL IN THAT FORMATION, WOULDN'T IT?Yes, in fact that's what we picked up when we measured the electric andmagnetic field strengths. We both picked up elevated readings using those tests.WHAT ABOUT ANYONE IN THE VICINITY SEEING ANYTHINGUNUSUAL IN THE SKY OR HEARING UNUSUAL SOUNDS?As far as we could determine, there hasn't been anyone who saw anything priorto the formation happening. Although, I want to say that the day or two before"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the formation was spotted, there was quite an electrical storm over this area ofAdams County, Ohio, which lasted quite a long time. The power went out for acouple of hours and affected three different power companies.\"More Information:The field report and data by Jeffrey Wilson, Roger Sugden and Ted Robertsonwill soon be posted at:http://www.cropcirclenews.com To Be Continued in Part 3We b s it e s :http://www.cropcirclenews.comhttp://www.bertjanssen.nlhttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://home.clara.net/lucy pringlehttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://www.cccrn.cahttp://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.invisiblecircle.de and http://www.invisiblecircle.org/ser/d-archiv-2003.htmlhttp://www.kornkreise.chhttp://www.heramagazine.nethttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmhttp://www.bltresearch.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
