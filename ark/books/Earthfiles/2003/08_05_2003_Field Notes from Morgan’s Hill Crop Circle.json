The next morning,Monday, I traveled to the formation and was impressed with the springy feeling the crop hadunder my feet. There, I met up with photographer and video producer, Bert Janssen, who hasstudied the geometry of crop formations for several years. He has produced two award-winning documentaries, Contact and Crop Circles: The Research. I explained to him that I hadcounted twenty-eight rays coming off one side of the large central flattened circle andseventy-eight coming off the opposite side. He walked around the top rays and into the largecentral circle trying to see if the rays lined up with the center “fountain” of wheat. They didnot and the formation’s geometric structure became a challenge to understand. Radio transmission towers atop Morgan’s Hill are south of the North Downformation. The crop formation at center lines up with the Morgan’s Hill stonemarker whichis the dark spot in the middle of tramlines to the right of theformation. Aerial photograph © 2003 by Nick Nicholson. Interview: Bert Janssen, Agricultural Engineer, Photographer and Video Producer, Devizes,Wiltshire, England: “When I first was in the formation August 4, it looked like the rays werereally random. It looked like the rays were going in all different directions. People told mewhen I was in this formation that this randomness was due to mistakes in the design of theformation. So I looked at them and noticed that in certain parts, some of the lines have anextension where there is a line, then standing crop, then the line extends further. That, Ithought, is difficult to do. It’s not easy to make a line, then a piece of standing crop and thenextend the line (that is perfectly straight from the other part of the line.) But if you are capableof doing that, then you are not going to make mistakes with the rays. That wouldn’t make anysense. So, when I looked further, I saw that the rays were not random. Although they were notpointed at the center (of the large flat circle), there was a definite purpose in them. They werepointed to one specific spot in the formation which was on the edge of the central circle. If youwould stand on that exact spot where the rays came together and you would look over thecenter of the circle, you would see that it was exactly aligned to the top of the hill where thereis a little stone monument marking the top of the hill. This one specific spot at the edge of thecenter circle and this monument were exactly on one line. The whole formation was aligned tothe top of the hill. So, the rays were not random and there were no mistakes in it."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" AT THAT SPOT WHERE ALL THE LINES INTERSECTED, YOU ALSO NOTICED IT WASTHE BEGINNING OF A CRESCENT? Yes. When I saw the aerial photograph, I noticed the central flattened circle looks like an eye.It’s not perfectly round. But if you look really closely, you will see that it’s a circle withsomething added to it. There is a crescent added to it and the crescent starts exactly at the spotat the edge of the circle where all the lines intersect. And on the other side of the circle wherethe imaginary line that connects to the stone monument leaves the formation, there thecrescent ends. So, it is exactly marking the start and the end of the crescent. The Morgan’s Hill rays come together at a point that lines up with the centralwheat ‘fountain’ and the stone marker which is the dark spot in the middle oftramlines to the right of the formation.

It looks much simpler inthe aerial picture. There are center points for each ring. The center of the flattened circle(where the wheat stands up in a little ‘fountain’) forms the center of the middle ring. Thecentral point for the entire formation is that spot at the edge of the center circle through whichall the rays converge. And that spot lines up exactly with the Morgan Hill stone monument sothe entire formation lines up on the imaginary straight line that runs through the stone and thatcentral spot. Another thing I notice looking at this photograph today is that there is a 3-dimensional aspectto the formation. It’s like a volcano that rises with a hole on top. FROM A GEOMETRY POINT OF VIEW, IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THAT YOUWOULD SAY IS REMARKABLE? Yes, this is one of the very few formations that I know about which has a distinct line up withthe landscape. Most of them have the geometry that is only in relationship with the field itself– let’s say, the tramlines in the field – but not with the landmarks around it. THAT ALIGNMENT IS WITH THAT MORGAN HILL MARKER STONE? Yes, the Morgan Hill marker stone is aligned with it perfectly. WHEN YOU ARE IN THE MORGAN HILL FORMATION, ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THEHILL IS THE NORTH DOWN OF FOUR TUMULI AND THE ‘FIFTH BARROW’ THATHAS BEEN CREATED BY THE 11-CONCENTRIC RINGS FORMATION THATOCCURRED ON JULY 6. NOW, THERE APPARENTLY IS A SIMPLE CIRCLE THATAPPEARED IN AND AROUND THE TIME THAT THIS MORGAN HILL FORMATIONCAME. HAS ANYBODY SEEN WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A STRAIGHT LINEALIGNMENT BETWEEN MORGAN'S HILL, THE SIMPLE CIRCLE AND THE FOURBURIAL MOUNDS AND THE JULY 6 CONCENTRIC RING FORMATION? The crop formations on a map do seem to line up. Further, North Down, the circle andMorgan’s Hill do seem to align with Oliver’s Castle where in the past, several formations havebeen discovered, including the 6-fold geometry ‘snowflake’ of 1996. A young man named John"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Weyleigh allegedly photographed several glowing balls of light that flew low over the crop andsimultaneously, the pattern seemed to form. To date, that videotape has never been proven ahoax or fact. ARE YOU AWARE OF ANY OTHER FORMATIONS THIS YEAR OR IN THE PAST THATHAVE BEEN ALIGNED WITH A SPECIFIC MARKER IN THE LANDSCAPE? The only other one I have seen is the one on the other side of the hill this year. We have theNorth Down formation which lines up with the barrows. But this one at Morgan's Hill is muchmore clear, lining up with that one specific stone marker to create the geometry of theformation. I have never seen that before. When I think about it, this 3-dimensional aspect could be a representation of a barrow. It looksa little like a raised barrow.” Field Notes from England to be continued.
