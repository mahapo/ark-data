Smith, Freedland Publishers Chapter 5, Part One -\"Confucius said, 'I won't teach a man who isn't anxious to learn,or explain to one who isn't trying to make things clear to himself.If I explain one-fourth and he doesn't go back and reflect and thinkout the remaining three-fourths for himself, I won't botherto instruct him again.'\" - The Analects he very last thing scientists want is solid evidence that extraterrestrials arevery intimately observing us - fearing, and rightly so - that this could underminetheir entire world view, and even their existence. An understanding of this factmakes it easy to see why rigorous investigations aren't wanted, why publicity isavoided, why evidence is suppressed and distorted, and why so much effort goesinto ridiculing what can't be entirely suppressed. That's all right. Let the censors follow their philosophy. Every dog has his day.This is theirs and it won't last forever. We are all being forced to play our cardsnow as time and the press of events deal them to us. It looks from where this isbeing written that the citizens of heaven hold all the kings, queens and aces,while their detractors and enemies have nothing but treys, deuces and jokers. Much of the explanation comes from the \"experts\" and \"authorities\" themselves.Dr. J. Allen Hynek, astronomer for the U. S. Air Force on Project Blue Book, isan outspoken representative of some of the most enlightened scientific thinkingon these subjects. He doesn't reject the idea that this planet is under surveillanceby extraterrestrials and keeps pressing for government funding and an end topublic ridicule of UFOs. Still, he has his reservations. The major impediment toa real understanding of the facts, he says, has been \"the adoption of the UFOphenomena by certain segments of the public for their own peculiar uses.\" Extraterrestrials might have two primary purposes for visiting this small planet.They've come to examine the quality of life here, and also to help extricate anygood spirits who might be caught in the toils of this ungodly mess. That's why itis very important for them, and for us, to recognize the qualities of those on thevarious sides of this and other questions. Now we can begin to explore the meaning of cattle mutilations and the growingnumbers of extraterrestrials in our skies. In order to get to a place where it ispossible to understand these phenomena, we must begin with a recognition ofour own place in the great cosmic background. What we see all around us is notthe result of a mindless concurrence of random and accidental events, but theworkmanship of an eternally creative wisdom that is pure spirit. (John 4:14) Something might be said first about stable suns and habitable planets. There arebelieved to be two hundred or so billion stars in this particular galaxy. Andthere are billions of galaxies. It is also now believed that planetary systems are"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"normal for most stars. So the number of planets in the cosmos is for all practicalpurposes infinite. It is the nature of all stars to fluctuate in time and most starsfluctuate over relatively short periods of time. Even our own sun has recentlybeen found to vary far more than had formerly been supposed. Although the violently dynamic nature of stellar processes prevents them fromtheir own accord remaining stable for very long periods of time; still, in order forthere to be habitable planets, a sun that remains relatively stable over a longperiod of time is needed. So it takes something special in the way of divinewisdom and creativity to stabilize suns so they can become life supporting. An error of this age is to believe that men have accidentally struggled up fromthe primeval slime through natural selection, survival of the fittest, or some otherevolutionary mechanism. there is much to commend an evolutionary hypothesis,but the truth of the matter is that men and other living forms have been put hereby the divine wisdom acting through superior agents. This planet has had extraterrestrial visitors ever since living forms were put hereand even before that. During the last few centuries, and especially the last fewdecades, those visits have been multiplying. Right now, many millions arecoming to make sure that when this place is terminated, as will happen when itbecomes impossible for children to be born here, or for men and women to enterheaven from this place, that everything is finally accomplished here according tothe divine order and purpose. Extraterrestrials visiting this planet come as soldiers on a tour of foreign duty.(Isaiah 13:3-5) We can hope they are out brothers, but that might be somewhatpresumptuous. They've identified themselves as our jailers, a nice description oftheir relationship to us as outlaws and rebels against the divine order of thecosmos. They've come, among other things, to see that nothing from earth leavesthis solar system without permission. Some earthlings will ultimately attain afree world status and be accepted into the kingdom of heaven. Most, however,will perish here. (Matthew 7:13) It's equally presumptuous for us to expect to communicate directly withextraterrestrials. They have not come to get involved or contaminated with thedelusions that are driving us inexorably toward judgment. After all, prisonersdon't bargain with their jailers, or with the soldiers guarding them, for theirrelease or commutation of sentence. Any attempt to do that would be apunishable crime for both parties. If we want to communicate with extraterrestrials, we'll have to do that throughtheir Heavenly Father, who is also ours. They neither love us nor hate us, andnothing could be more obvious to them than the fact that this is a community ofdangerous outlaws. Nevertheless, they have come here as soldiers, intelligent,courteous, gentle, powerful, high spirited, excellently equipped, and absolutelyobedient. That's the real difference between us and them. They are obedient totheir Creator and we are not. That's why they are free and immortal agents inGod's infinitely delightful cosmos, while we're only prisoners waiting here ondeath row. Who are they and where have they come from? They are representatives of thecitizens of heaven, God's mighty ones, and they've come from many places, veryfar away. (Isaiah 13:2-6) Some will say that's impossible. The cosmos is too vast.Stars are too far apart for anything to travel readily among them. Objections likethat are based on a common misunderstanding of the nature of time, and asimilar ignorance of the relationships between time, distance, mass and energy. The truth is that the cosmos has been perfectly designed for space travelers.Distances are immense, but that's no obstacle at all to God's children. Thesimple rule to remember is this: NO TIME ELAPSES AT THE SPEED OFLIGHT. As the velocity of light is approached, time slows down and finallystops. A hundred or a thousand or a million or a billion light years is traversedinstantly at that velocity."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" The commonplace belief that there's such a thing as simultaneous timethroughout the cosmos is no more than an ignorant provincialism. Time cannever be anything but a local phenomenon. Every system creates its own timethat varies according to its relative velocity. time is infinitely variable, on theother hand there's no going back from one time frame to an older one. But whyshould the citizens of heaven ever go back? They never go back. They always goon to the better things ahead that their Creator keeps presenting to them. The major difficulty with long distance space travel, from our worldly point ofview, is that it requires TREMENDOUS energy, something we're woefully shortof here. But none of our visitors are short of power. That's a commodity theyhave a great abundance of, all they cold ever need or want. For all practicalpurposes, they have infinite amounts of readily available power. That's onereason why the rewards being offered for the arrest and conviction of cattlemutilators are ridiculous, blasphemous and insane. Cattle mutilators have not come here to get arrested. The very nature of thesituation makes that impossible. If one of them ever gets caught, we can hope it'sa girl, and that her captors are present in full force: the CBI, the FBI, and theCIA, plus the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps. It would be a shame forthe confrontation to be all one sided. That, of course, will never happen. Theycome here divinely protected and could shatter this place into fine fragments, ifnecessary. But out of their deep respect for our human form, they are careful tonever let us force them to do that. Continued in - Chapter 5, Part Two - which concludes this historic book.
