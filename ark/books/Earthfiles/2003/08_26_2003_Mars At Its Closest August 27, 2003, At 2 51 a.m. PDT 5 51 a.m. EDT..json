Mars will have reached its closest approach to the Earth in 60,000years the day before on August 27 - only 34,650,000 miles away.The reason this happens is shown in the diagram below where the orbit of Marsis not quite a perfect circle. As Earth passes Mars about every two years, thedistance between the two planets varies. The next three oppositions will beNovember 7, 2005, December 24, 2007 and January 29, 2010.Basic facts from University of Washington Astronomy Department andPhiladelphia's Franklin Institute:Closest approach occurs on Aug 27, 2003 at 2:51 AM PDT / 5:51 AMEDT.Closest approach will be 55.76 million kilometers from Earth (34.6million miles, or 37% of the Earth-Sun distance).At opposition Mars will be as close as it has been since the year 57,537B.C. The next approach this close is 28 August 2287 A.D.The apparent size of Mars' disk at closest approach will be 25.1arcseconds, the apparent size of a dime at 500 feet.Mars will be the brightest object in the sky after about 10 PM PDT / 1 AMEDT in late August and early September. It will be found highest in the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"sky at about 1:30 A.M. PDT (from Seattle, about 27 degrees above thesouthern horizon.)Mars appears orange in color. So do a few stars. But Mars will be brighterthan all stars, and it won't twinkle.Maximum brightness will be near peak brightness (magnitude -2.9) forabout a week before and after 27 August. If you miss seeing Mars onenight, try again the next. Mars fades rapidly after early September as theEarth pulls ahead of it.Mars appears reddish-beige because it is covered with oxidized iron.Phobos and Deimos - the two moons of Mars - were named after the Greekgods of fear and panic.The Martian atmosphere is 95% carbon dioxide, 2.7% nitrogen, 1.6%argon, .13% oxygen, and .03% water.The red planet's highest temperature in Fahrenheit is 77 degrees and lowestis -193 degrees.A Martian day is 24.6 hours and a year is 687 days.Hubble Telescope image of Mars and the largest canyonin the solar system, Valles Marineris, that stretches for 2,500 miles (4,000 km).We b s it e :http://www.stsci.edu/exined/Mars.html (Hubble Telescope Images)http://www.astro.washington.edu/dept/mars_opposition.html (Univ. ofWashington Astronomy Dept.)http://www.fi.edu/tfi/info/fels/date_mars.html (Philadelphia's FelsPlanetarium)Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
