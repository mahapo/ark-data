Also, for the first time over a periodfrom April 25 to June 27, thirteen more unexplained patterns in cereal cropsbeyond the one in Rome have been reported from the north to the south andeast to west in the long \"boot\" of Italy. Whatever is happening, Italy has also hadmysterious lights associated with some of its crop formations this year.To better understand the chronology and location of the Italian crop patterns,this week I talked with Adriano Forgione, Editor, Hera magazine, in Rome. Thefollowing is a chronological evolution with Adriano's comments.Interview:Adriano Forgione, Editor, Hera magazine, Rome, Italy provided thissummary with comments:1) April 25, 2003Location: Settimo San Pietro, near Cagliari, on the island of Sardinia.Pattern: Diagram aboveImages: No aerial photographs, but two photographs of stretched nodes.Lengthened, darkened, reoriented growth node in plant samplefrom the Settimo San Pietro, Sardinia, formation discovered on April 25, 2003.Photograph © 2003 by Antonello Lupino."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Settimo lengthened, reoriented growth node and leaf twisted,perhaps by hypothesized spinning plasma vortex energy that mightbe responsible for the creation of crop formations.Photograph © 2003 by Antonello Lupino.Settimo growth node expulsion cavity in which the waterhas been heated up enough to explode out of the node. This phenomenonis usually found only inside crop patterns, not in the normal cropoutside.

One of the teenagers hada new cell phone that can snap digital photographs and he took two frames.Adriano Forgione, Editor of Hera magazine, heard about the young man'simages from the mayor of Montegranaro, a longtime friend.
