The total number of suchasteroids could be well over a thousand.\"- EarthSky.com Left: The 1994 XM asteroid appeared as a trail in images taken on December9, 1994.Right: Compare to image on right which shows the asteroid some 4.5 hourslater. The asteroidwas about 550,000 kilometers away from Earth at the time, on its way to arecord closeapproach of some 105,000 kilometers (65,258 miles) only 12 hours later. Updated - The Jet Propulsion Lab's Paul Chodas, a researchscientist who specializes in calculating the orbits of asteroids andother near-Earth objects, announced today that asteroid 2003 QQ47is not on a collision course with Earth in March 2014. Chodas said,\"This particular one was of interest because it is fairly large, 1.3kilometers [0.8 mile], and the predicted impact was only ten yearsaway. Combining those two factors, we raised it to some level ofconcern.\"September 2, 2003 Cloudcroft, New Mexico - The first eyes to see the newasteroid threat called \"2003 QQ47\" are at the Lincoln Near Earth AsteroidResearch Program at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts. LINEAR, as it's knownto astronomers, was an outgrowth of the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization(BMDO) that took over the Reagan Administration's Star Wars program.LINEAR rose from the development of very high tech surveillance equipmentthat was originally designed to look for orbiting space junk high above ourplanet. Scientists already know of 113 Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)tumbling on paths that will eventually lead them to within an astronomical hair'swidth of Earth. The total number of such asteroids could be well over athousand. And this newly discovered one is about two kilometers in diameter -big enough to do serious damage on Earth if it hit us.There was a smart astronomer in the Lincoln Laboratories at MIT named Brant"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Stokes who envisioned that all that BMDO high tech surveillance technologycould be used to search for near earth asteroids. MIT's Lincoln Labs had atelescope that was based at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico thatbegan testing the BMDO system in the mid-1990s. LINEAR made a fewdiscoveries of objects and then went online in early 1998. Since then, those guyshave kind of blown everyone else out of the water (with near earth objectdiscoveries).Another astronomer famous for co-discovering the Hale-Bopp Comet is AlanHale, Ph.D., Director of the Southwest Institute for Space Research inCloudcroft, New Mexico. He and his colleagues are looking over the first dataon QQ47 and making quiet bets that in the next several weeks, new orbital datawill change the potential Earth impact to at least a near miss in 2014. But - onthe other hand - if orbital calculations of QQ47 reinforce a likely impact withEarth on March 21, 2014, what could humanity in 2003 to 2014 do about it?Interviews:Alan Hale, Ph.D., Astronomer and Director, Southwest Institute for SpaceResearch, Cloudcroft, New Mexico: \"I receive all the information that comesfrom the Minor Planet Center (at the Harvard Smithsonian AstrophysicalCenter, Cambridge, Mass.). They are the world's clearinghouse for receiving anddisseminating information about all the asteroids that are discovered in theLinear and other survey programs that are reporting discoveries. I gatherpositional data for these things and the Minor Planet Center computes orbits anytime a new near earth object is discovered. The MPC issues information out toanyone on their mailing list, so I received the announcement for this one onAugust 27 or 28. It's one of several that come out all the time. We get two orthree of these announcements every day. So, there was nothing especiallyunusual about this one.They do denote objects that are deemed potentially hazardous and this one didhave that kind of description on it when it came. Again, that's nothingdramatically unusual. Those are usually discovered two or three a month.WHY DID THIS MAKE THE HEADLINE, \"GIANT ASTEROID COULD HITEARTH IN 2014?\"A lot of that I think is just sensationalism. I saw the preliminary orbitalcalculations which will continue to be studied over the next few weeks. Butwhat I presume has happened here is that the calculations have been runforward (computer projected), and assuming the orbit we have right now, thatwould indicate that object would be coming pretty close to Earth at that time in2014.WHICH IS MARCH 21.But there is always a significant amount of error. There is quite a bit ofuncertainty, especially in the first week or two after an object has beendiscovered. In astronomerese, we could say, 'The Earth is within the asteroid'serror ellipsoid.' What that means is that there is a volume of space that theasteroid could occupy at that time, based on the orbit we have now and theuncertainties, and the Earth is within that volume of space.WHAT WILL HAPPEN OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO TO REFINETHOSE CALCULATIONS?A number of things. One is that people are going out to observe it and collectpositional information on it and each set of observations that comes throughhelps in refining the orbit.Another thing that is being done is that people are searching old data data thatwas taken by LINEAR and other programs in the past five years data that mighthave shown up on photographs at Palomar when photographic surveys werebeing conducted there back in the 1980s and even as far back as the 1950s"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"sometimes.BECAUSE THIS HAS AN ORBIT OF 1.18 YEARS AND IT WOULD HAVEBEEN AROUND THREE OR FOUR TIMES POSSIBLY IN THE LAST FIVEYEARS?Ye s .IF YOU FIND A PHOTOGRAPH IN WHICH YOU CAN SEE WHERE IT WASBACK THEN, HOW DOES THAT HELP YOU?Then you have a much longer base line from which to calculate an orbit. Youcan get a much better base line from a three year or five year orbit when yourdata spans that long versus one week.HOW BIG IS THIS NEW ASTEROID?About all we can do is get the absolute magnitude or intrinsic brightness of theobject, which is the brightness it would have at a certain distance from the sunand Earth. Then we can convert that to an approximate diameter. The numberwe have now for the intrinsic brightness of this asteroid works out to a diameterof one to two kilometers (about a mile in diameter).What Would Happen If A Mile Wide Asteroid Hit the Earth?HOW MUCH DAMAGE COULD A MILE DIAMETER ASTEROID DO TOTHE EARTH IF THERE WAS A FULL IMPACT?It can do quite a bit. You are aware of the Tungunska event back in 1908. Well,that was believed to be only an 80-meter-diameter object that exploded in theatmosphere. It was the airburst that did all the damage in Siberia. A one to twokilometer asteroid could wreak a lot of havoc, certainly over a continental area,perhaps even over a global area if it were to hit.COULD YOU GIVE A SCENARIO BASED ON AN EDUCATEDPROJECTION OF WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN?There would be significant earthquakes. There would be significant pressurewaves of the object in the atmosphere. A lot of the atmosphere would be ionizedand create a lot of fires and burn damage over a wide area.If it struck in the ocean, there would be tsunamis created. There would be blastdamage from the actual impact itself. A lot of forest fires could throw a lot ofsmoke into the atmosphere that would create a bit of a nuclear winter affect oversome areas of the planet.WHAT WOULD HAPPEN RIGHT AT THE AREA OF IMPACT?Well, there wouldn't be much left. You wouldn't want to be underneath it!\"Conceptual images by Mary Parrish, Smithsonian NationalMuseum of Natural History (NMNH).The conceptual sketch above depicts an asteroid moments before impact onMexico's Yucatan coastline 65 million years ago. According to the SmithsonianNational Museum of Natural History, \"Approaching at an angle from the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"southeast, it sent the main force of its impact northward in a fire storm overNorth America. The evidence has grown so overwhelming that few scientistsdispute that an asteroid nearly 10 km (6 mi) wide slammed into what is nowMexico's Yucatan Peninsula. The impact blasted a 180 kilometer-wide (100miles) crater many kilometers deep into the Earth.\"The heat of impact sent a searing vapor cloud speeding northward which,within minutes, set the North American continent aflame. This fireball and thedarkness that followed caused major plant extinctions in North America.Environmental consequences led to global extinction of many plants andanimals, including the dinosaurs. Lingering airborne debris is believed to havetriggered darkness and a decline in the global temperature, making Earthuninhabitable not only for dinosaurs by also for many other plants and animals.Dinosaurs, like Triceratops depicted in this sketch, passed into extinction,ending more than 150 million years of evolution and dominance over life onEarth. Other organisms, including mammals like those shown in the lower left ofthis sketch, somehow survived. In the words of Dr. Brian Huber: \"This eventprofoundly changed the course of life on Earth. If it had not happened,evolution would have followed a different path and in all likelihood we wouldnot be here today.\"Dust and ash fallout as well as material blasted from the crater are clearlyevident in the deep-sea core, which scientists recovered more than 1,920 km(1200 miles) from the impact site off the east coast of Florida.Mark Boslough, Ph.D., Physicist and Principal Member, Technical Staff,Sandia National Laboratories, Computer modeling of climate, evolutionand asteroid and comet impacts, Sandia National Laboratories,Albuquerque, New Mexico:\"IF THE ASTEROID WAS 2 KILOMETERS IN DIAMETER AND THAT HITNEW YORK CITY, WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?It would be the end of New York City. In fact, it would be the end of the entireEastern seaboard and depending upon which direction it came from it would bethe end of most of the cities for great distances down range (of impact.) If it werea grazing impact, the asteroid coming in at a fairly low angle a lot of that debriswould just continue down range and be ejected into space. But then it wouldre-enter the atmosphere, so you would have multiple impacts downstream fromthe original impact. Each one of those would be devastating, heat up theatmosphere and create fires. All the material would be in motion and sweepacross a large part of the Earth's surface. So it would create a wide swath ofdestruction.SO YOU WOULD HAVE WIND AND FIRE FOLLOWED BY A NUCLEARWINTER?Potentially followed by a nuclear winter, depending upon how much materialactually ends up in the atmosphere. I think that would depend on how fast theobject hits, exactly where it hits, what kind of material is excavated, how steepan angle it comes in and so on. Every impact is not the same, but something ofthis magnitude is going to be devastating."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WHAT IF IT HITS INTO ONE OF THE OCEANS?There are different phenomena associated with impacts into oceans one beingtsunamis. You would generate a huge wave in the ocean basin that would sweepacross the coast lines that form the boundary of that ocean. But you also get theother effects associated with it as well: ejection of material and subsequentimpacts of ejected material re-entering the atmosphere.WHEN YOU'VE DONE COMPUTER MODELING ON THE IMPACT OFASTEROIDS OR COMETS AND YOU ARE DEALING IN THE SIZE OF ONETO TWO KILOMETERS, WHAT IS THE HEIGHT THAT A TSUNAMI WAVECOULD BE FROM SUCH AN IMPACT IN THE OCEAN?It depends on the depth of the ocean. it depends on a lot of things. But thecalculations show there is significant run up on the coastlines, so you would notwant to be on the beach.IS THERE A RANGE I THINK ALAN HALE SAID IT MIGHT GET UPTOWARD A MILE HIGH?I think if the coastline was near the impact point, that's not too ridiculous tothink about. I don't think it would be that high for the entire range of coastlinesin the distance, but in the near field, you could get extremely high waves.WHAT MIGHT WE AS A PLANET WITH CURRENT TECHNOLOGY DO IFWE KNEW THAT QQ 47 AFTER MONTHS OR A YEAR OFCALCULATION, WE KNEW IT WAS GOING TO HIT ON MARCH 21, 2014 DO WE HAVE ANYTHING GOING IN OUR MILITARY ARSENAL THATCOULD DEFLECT THIS ASTEROID?That's an interesting time frame. I think it's important to keep in mind that theseare preliminary numbers that are based on a lot of uncertainty. The kind ofnumbers I'm hearing are probabilities of roughly one in a million that's anextremely low probability. So it's not something to worry about at this point. Infact, I'd be willing to bet you there's enough new data to drive that number tozero.But if the number got higher and it really is on an impact trajectory we've gotwhat? eleven years to try to deflect this thing. I think when billions of lives areliterally at stake, a crash program could be put together to deflect something likethat. Of course, it would require nuclear explosions.IT WOULD REQUIRE THEM TO BE OUT NEAR THE ASTEROID INORBIT?That's right. Some how you're going to have to change the orbit of somethinglike this. On the kind of time scale we're talking about a decade the only way todeflect something that big and moving that fast is with nuclear weapons.WE WOULDN'T WANT TO BREAK IT UP?No. In fact, you would make the problem worse and I did look at the problem ofbroken up objects in the atmosphere. If that happens, you can actually put moreenergy into the atmosphere which can make the problem worse.BECAUSE YOU HAVE MORE PIECES COMING IN ALL AT ABOUT THESAME SPEED AND MULTIPLYING THEIR IMPACT?Multiplying their impact. It's the same amount of energy, but a larger fraction ofthe energy goes into the atmosphere if you have a lot of smaller objects. It's kindof like the difference between a shotgun blast and a single bullet.DO WE NOW HAVE ANYBODY WORKING ON HOW THEY WOULD USENUCLEAR WEAPONS TO DEFLECT INCOMING ASTEROIDS?There are certainly people thinking about the problem, but it's not an economic"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"priority right now.WAS THE 65 MILLION YEAR AGO EVENT THAT HIT NEAR THEYUCATAN AND IS LINKED TO THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DINOSAURSTHE LAST BIG IMPACT OF AN ASTEROID OR COMET THAT CAUSEDGLOBAL DEVASTATION?No, I think there have been others perhaps not extinction-causing, but impactsthat have caused global devastation, climate change, at least in the short term.One example of that would be the impact that gouged out the crater that'sunderneath Chesapeake Bay, Maryland.WHEN DID THAT OCCUR?That was about 30 to 35 million years ago.\"We b s it e s :http://www.swisr.orghttp://www.ll.mit.edu/LINEAR/http://www.lpl.arizona.edu/spacewatch/http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/ (JPL's \"Solar System Dynamics\")http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/iau/lists/Dangerous.html (PotentiallyHazardous Asteroids)http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/planets/asteroidpage.html (Asteroidsand Comets)http://www.boulder.swri.edu/clark/near.html (The Asteroid/Comet ImpactHazard by Clark Chapman.)Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
