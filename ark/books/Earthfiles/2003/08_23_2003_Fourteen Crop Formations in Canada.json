August 23, 2003 Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada - Even though thecrop formation season has ended in England because most fields have beenharvested, it has been evolving in Canada since July. At least fourteen cropformations have been reported in provinces ranging from British Columbia toSaskatchewan and Ontario - some eerily similar to the British pictograms of theearly 1990s.Paul Anderson, Director of the Canadian Crop Circle Research Network, talkedwith me this weekend about surprising physical changes to plants that have beenfound in some formations, a few mysterious aerial objects, and the pictograms.Interview:Paul Anderson, Director, Canadian Crop Circle Research Network(CCCRN), Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada: \"Since July 23, we havehad fourteen formations reported as of today, August 23, 2003 - exactly amonth. The most recent of those being in Scott, Saskatchewan, which is twolarge circles in wheat. That is all I know about that one so far; the report camein yesterday.Just before that we had the second formation at Tisdale, Saskatchewan reportedon the other side of the province. This is a formation close to the first formationnear Tisdale. This new second one had already been combined by the farmer, sowe don't have any more details about the second one yet."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"First 2003 formation near Tisdale, Saskatchewan, Canada, reportedon August 20, 2003 in wheat. Aerial photograph © 2003 by Michael Harpham.The first one at Tisdale was reported August 20, and this is a large one. I just gotnew photographs up at our CCCRN website of this one. It's a large formation inwheat consisting of four circles in a straight line going from the smallest to thelargest. The largest one has a small standing kind of crescent inside it and thereis a thin ring that goes around and connects the smallest circle to the largest one.The formation looks a bit rough, but it's interesting that the farmer reports thatthe plants inside the thin ring are bent over about four inches above the ground.WHAT ABOUT FARMERS AND INVESTIGATORS FINDING BLOWN ANDREORIENTED GROWTH NODES AND SIGNS OF THE TRULY STRANGEPHENOMENON THAT WE ASSOCIATE WITH MYSTERIOUS CROPFORMATIONS?In some of the cases, we found swollen nodes, but not ruptured. In several wehave found ruptured or expulsion cavities in the nodes.There's another surprising thing this year. In three or four of the formations all inwheat, we have found the twisted seed head anomaly where the stem directlybelow the seed head - and I know you are well familiar with this (See LindaHowe's book: Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles.) - has that twisting and kinking init. We found that in three or four of the Canadian formations so far.Wallacetown, Ontario formation reported August 11, 2003.Twisted stem beneath seed head, possibly because an energy affected the plant's stemgrowth a few weeks before the formation appeared.

LEVENGOOD, BECAUSEHE SAYS FOR THAT KINKING TO OCCUR WHERE IT DOES IN THEGROWTH NODES, IT WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN AN ENERGYIMPACT ON THE PLANT MUCH EARLIER IN ITS GROWTH THAN THEDISCOVERY OF THE FORMATIONS.Yes. And it's surprising to find it in this many. But we have, so we're"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"documenting all of this as fast as we can.Speaking of expulsion cavities, something that surprised me is the formation outin Agassiz, British Columbia, not too far from me and not too far from thelocation of the two formations at Mission, B. C. last year. (See: 09/28/02 and10/01/02 Earthfiles.com.)Agassiz, British Columbia, Canada formation in 9-foot-tall \"cattle corn,\"about 150 feet long, reported August 7, 2003. Photograph © 2003 by Ralph Noddin.The 2003 Agassiz formation is thirty or forty miles away from that site. Again,this is in cattle corn - like the 2002 Mission, B. C. formations - about nine feettall. The formation pattern is also similar to those at Mission last year as well.But what was surprising was that in this 2003 one, we have found quite a fewexpulsion cavities in the stalks. On the stalks, many of them have three or fourexpulsion cavities - meaning, three or four of the nodes are affected. Some nodesactually have two cavities in them. We didn't find any like that in the Missionformations last year. There were some nodes that were somewhat swollen andother ones that appeared to be cut through or sliced. So, this is kind of unusual,especially to have this many on one stalk. Keep in mind that these are stalksabout an half-inch thick.The farmer has been very cooperative in this case, unlike the one from Missionlast year who only let us (on his property) very grudgingly. This farmer (inAgassiz) has been very cooperative and quite interested, so he has been helpingus. He told us that he has never seen these expulsion cavities before in his crops.He's been farming that field since 1996.SO HE HAS NEVER SEEN EXPULSION CAVITIES IN HIS CATTLE CORNBEFORE?Not before this (2003 Agassiz formation).DID ANYONE AROUND THAT AREA REPORT ANY MYSTERIOUSLIGHTS OR SOUNDS?The only formation so far this year where we have had reports of unusual lights,or similar phenomena, was the formation at Hensall, Ontario, which wasreported July 30, 2003.Hensall, Ontario, Canada, wheat formation reported on July 30, 2003.Length of pattern was measured at 233 feet. Aerial photograph© 2003 by Hilary Long, Clinton News-Record.Peter Davenport's National UFO Reporting Center in Seattle (NUFORC) had asighting report of a cigar-shaped object on July 13 in that same area, as seen bytwo witnesses, moving across nearby a deserted road. This was late at night, Ithink it was, on a back country road and close to where that formation wasfound.There was also a newspaper report about people saying they had seen some"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"colored lights in that same area approximately July 21. But those are the onlytwo reports I've heard so far in connection with any of the formations.Going back to the formation at Hensall, Ontario (discovered July 30, 2003), thesimilarity of this one to the one I know you investigated back in August 1993 inEngland at Cherhill Down. As soon as I saw this one, it reminded meimmediately of that 1993 formation with the two outstretched 'hands' or 'hooks'coming together in the center part of the formation. Hensall is not quite as large,only 233 feet in length (compared to the 445-foot-long pattern at Cherhill in1993.) But the design similarity is there.445-foot-long formation found August 8, 1993, in awheat field below the White Horse at Cherhill Down west of Silbury Hill.Aerial photograph © 1993 by Colin Andrews.In my book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume I: Facts & Eyewitnesses, Idiscussed my investigation of the August 8, 1993, Cherhill, Wiltshire, Englandformation shown above for comparison to the July 30, 2003 Hensall, Ontarioformation. The central overlapping arcs at the center of both formations issimilar to an Old European script sign for \"lu.\"Examples of Old European script signs, including \"lu\" symbol,commonly used between 5300-4300 B. C. as sacred writing to inscribe on religious objectsand as communication between man and the gods. From: The Civilization of the Goddess,The World of Old Europe © 1991 by Marija Gimbutas.In the Hensall and others in Canada this year, the designs have certainly beendifferent from what we usually see and at least one or two notches morecomplex. So, whatever the origin of any of these, the evolution seems to havegone up this year in Canada. It's not over yet either.ECHOING SOME OF THOSE OLDER, BEAUTIFUL PATTERNS FROMENGLAND IN THE EARLY 1990S.That's right. Also the one before Hensall at Stewarttown, Ontario, reminded meof the earlier pictograms from England and that one actually came in two stages.That one was a bit larger - 326 feet in length - with the similarity to many of theearly pictograms in England.\""},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Stewarttown, Ontario, Canada, wheat pictogram measured at 326 feet long,reported on July 31, 2003.
