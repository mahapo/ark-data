The tables could be removed fromthe officers' mess during a banquet if that were worth doing. Maybe somethings like that have already happened. If so, they are deep, dark classifiedTop Secrets.\"Fred Smith, 1976 he extraterrestrials commanding UFOs are technically superior to earthlings.They are also our superiors in many other ways. Yet claw-handed dwarfs,mothmen, and other horrible and monstrous apparitions have been encounterednear or associated with UFOs. How can they be accounted for? They are whatearthlings call tulpas. If we were spiritually prepared, we might meet theirmasters, even wearing their halos and faces like lightning in whose presencetrained soldiers swoon away like dead men. (Isaiah 13:2-6)Personal contact with extraterrestrial visitors, and also strange ships in theheavens, have been reported throughout history. The sightings have increasedtremendously in modern times, and especially since World War II. If thesevisitors are from distant solar systems, as is now evident, why this multiplicationof sightings? The answer is their interest in our modern age of technology,roughly 300 years old now, with its subsequent population and knowledge"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"explosions. From their cosmic point of view, these developments have beenextremely significant. (Revelation 6:2)As we saw in Chapter 3, every perversion imaginable, or unimaginable, has beenattributed to cattle mutilators. Every motive except the real one seems to havebeen considered. What they're really interested in is reproduction, not of cattle,but of humans. They (ETs) are looking intently to see how far down the tube weare. That will tell them how long they might have to be here. They don't reallyknow that, but by this broad sampling of animal tissue, they'll be more able tomake an educated guess.What are the mutilators looking for and why do they select those particulartissues for analysis? What they're primarily interested in are genetic anomaliesthat relate to human reproduction, which they know is extremely precariousnow and can be expected to fail completely within several decades. Whathappens in an explosion? An explosion can be described as an extremely rapidrelease and degradation of energy. It booms then busts, which is also the courseof the modern wealth and population explosion. Every conceivable energy andquality, both human and natural, has been rapidly exploited, degraded anddestroyed.It would be hard to imagine anyone more obtuse about the long rangesignificance of human reproduction than the so-called \"population experts.\" Yet,in a vague way, even they can see there's something profoundly threatening inthis modern situation. More than mere egotistical comfort is involved, what'sbeing threatened is the viability of ALL life here on earth. The views ofextraterrestrials can only be seen as through a glass darkly. But we can judge theprofundity of their interest from what happened at Sodom, and by what's beenhappening here and now in this cattle mutilation phenomenon.The various organs and tissues that are taken for analysis blood, skin, ears,rectums, the salivary glands beneath the tongue, and sometimes tails, hearts andintestines, have been selected so that a variety of significant tissues can becompared with each other chromosomally and also formally. By comparing allthese to the norm, especially when done by those having the original design ofsuch things, much can be learned.The outward form of the genitals and any departure from the ideal wouldcertainly be significant to them. Even more significant would be the internalstructures of the sex cells and the effects that contaminants, feed additives,inbreeding and other genetic \"improvements\" have had on them. It is knownnow, for example, that plutonium among other deadly mutagenic agentsgradually migrates to the gonads. (Colorado Governor Richard Lamm andCongressman Tim Worth Report on Rocky Flats.) The overall progress of suchpoisons are found much more easily in the tissues of large and relativelylong-lived animals such as cattle. We can be sure they are able to recognizemutations, weakness, sterility and other genetic flaws and failures withouthaving to wait for an overt manifestation of those anomalies, as earthlyinvestigators must do.The various tissues they (ETs) select should be scientifically instructive to us.The digestive tract is lined with the fastest growing cells designed to be sloughedafter a few days of super activity. These would be most accessible and perhapsinformative at the rectum. Traces of excrement and urine would no doubt tell"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"them many things. Eye tissues are especially subject to mutation and radiationdamage. Ears would supply both hair and tough cartilage. Blood, skin andmammary glands would all have their significant stories to tell. Tails provide themost accessible bone samples.While the tongue is just about the least preferable and last eaten part of acarcass for predators, the salivary glands beneath it have a well known attractionfor geneticists. It was the discovery that chromosomes in the salivary glands ofdrosophila flies are about a thousand times larger than other body cells that ledto the modern understanding of the function of genes. No earthling seems toknow exactly what that remarkable gigantism means, but it has greatly assistedthe study of chromosomes and genes.After knowing who the mutilators are and why they do this, there is still thequestion about how they can do it without leaving a single track or any othertraces. How can a half ton animal be killed, cut up and left in plain sight besidea busy highway or a house with watchdogs and never be seen? Yet somethinglike that has happened many times. We must recognize that along with selectingtissues for examination, the mutilators have a secondary purpose. They want tomake their presence known. They don't go out of their way to be seen, nor dothey go out of their way to avoid being seen. They just go about their businesshere more or less oblivious to us. And they want us to know they are able to dothat.It's interesting to notice that when fresh snow falls, the mutilations usually stop.If animals were found recently mutilated in freshly fallen snow, it would bepretty obvious how it happened. If it had been done from the air, or byhelicopter, or if the carcass had been transported to the site, those things wouldbe evident. So, they don't do it that way. The mutilators never make the facts tooobvious. They follow a simple rule: There must never be incontrovertibleevidence. Why?Because everything they do tends toward judgment. They present people withplenty of evidence, for example, all these mutilated carcasses. But it mustalways be of a kind that people can either accept or reject. They avoidcompelling anyone to either believe or disbelieve anything. They're here to bringout what's inside us, what really makes us tick. That's what must ultimately goon display. Are we for heaven or against it? Do we respect it or hate everythingabout it? Do we believe our senses or accept the pronouncements of our expertseven when they're obviously lying? These are among the issues of judgment.That's why they want to make their presence known here, but only in ways thatcan be refuted and rejected by anyone who prefers it that way. So we can besure there will NEVER be what is called solid evidence of their activities oreven of their existence. On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence forwhoever wants to accept it. As for how they actually do these things withoutleaving a single clue, that's not so hard to understand either. Not that we knowall about their surgical techniques, any more than we can know all the details oftheir propulsion systems. but in a general way, it's possible to see how thesethings are done.First, there's the question of how the animals are killed. Pathologists are sayingofficially that the deaths are natural. What is a \"natural\" death? Maybe theanimals die of asphyxiation or of fright. There are many reports of animals being"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"terrified by UFOs or UFO occupants. This is probably the same mechanism, butintensified, whereby animals fear men, the innate recognition of a superiorpower. (Genesis 9:2) People have also been terrified by UFOs, as well as byghosts and snakes, even though such things might not be harmful, and in fact,might be beneficial. Some deaths from snake bite might be attributed to fear,which in itself can be deadly. Ghosts might have killed people in the same way.In any case, extraterrestrials are known to sometimes be extremely terrifying tomen and also to animals. So that can't be ruled out as a cause of death inmutilated cattle. More probably they are felled with an electromagnetic beam.As for how large animals are taken up and then replaced on the ground, wedon't know all the details of that. We do know, however, that extraterrestrialscontrol immense as well as intense electromagnetic force fields. Numerousreports tell of planes being sucked or pushed rapidly and uncontrollably upwardor downward by UFOs. There have also been reports of cars and trucks beingsuspended above the highways they have been traveling along.There are so many cases the world over of people and animals disappearingwithout a trace that this is almost commonplace. People have been reporteddisappearing from large groups, right before their neighbors' eyes, sometimesapparently being carried upward. Throughout history people have seen thingsfalling from the sky small and sometimes regular streams of water, also ice, fish,blood, flesh, manna, oil, metals, cannon balls, nails, dirt, oyster shells, money.(The Works of Charles Fort, The Fortean Society, New York, 1941.) You nameit and people somewhere have probably reported seeing it fall out of the sky.In this case, it's so obvious that large animals are being picked up, killed, organsand blood removed, and then put down again, that helicopters seem to providethe only rational answer except that isn't very rational either! There is no actualevidence of helicopters ever being used for this purpose, even though someclaim to have seen unidentified choppers, and even to have been chased bythem. Even when strange helicopters have been sighted, that in itself might beneither more nor less significant than the man who reported that to hisamazement he saw a UFO in a field as six shiny new green Chevrolets drove outof it and disappeared down the highway. This does not mean thatextraterrestrials have Chevrolet or helicopter production lines. Maybe thosevehicles were like the donkey in the Bible that the Lord has need of. (Matthew21:2)It's a mistake to think a machine would actually have to land, or grapple anobject with a cable, for example, in order to make off with it. The facts make itappear otherwise, and also from a theoretical point of view, a narrowly definedforce field could do the same thing. In fact, this is what the mutilators are tellingpeople they are able to do. that is, make off very easily with half or three-quarterton animals. They can also replace the carcasses gently on the ground after thetissues they need have been excised.The fact that extraterrestrials can take things up into the sky has been wellknown for thousands of years. Right now, they are trying to refresh ourcollective memories about things like that. We are told, for example, that Jesuswas \"taken up,\" and then disappeared into a cloud. (Acts 1:9) Whether he wastaken off the ground in a vehicle, or the vehicle was inside the cloud, theaccount does not say. Saint Paul wrote that at the end of this world's history,believers will be \"caught up in the clouds ... and so shall we ever be with the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Lord.\" (I Thessalonians 4:7) Jesus said that two will be working or sleepingtogether and one will be taken and the other left. (Matthew 24:40-41 and Luke17:34) The lifting in such cases would have to be perfectly localized andselective, and the impression is given that it isn't necessary for the vehicle to bein the immediate area, but the \"taking up\" can be controlled from someunknown distance overhead.That's what happens to animals in this testing program, and explains thecomplete absence of evidence at the scene. The animal is taken up, worked on,and then put down again in some very obvious location. The actual cuts mightbe made immediately overhead or thousands of feet in the sky. Since thepropulsion systems that support and propel UFOs impinge very gently on animmense volume of space, they can be completely silent even at very highspeeds. They can also become invisible. Let's think for a moment about how thatis done.There have been many reports of UFOs becoming invisible. While apparentlystill at close range, they suddenly blank out, disappearing from radar screensand also from sight. It's easy to see how this can happen, since UFO propulsionsystems keep the vehicles constantly surrounded with a broad field of ionizedparticles. Radar operates by beaming out an electromagnetic signal and thenpicking up whatever reflection comes back from planes, missiles, rain, clouds, orother objects.It doesn't take much electronic sophistication to tell when one's inside the beamof a radar \"spotlight.\" Nor would it take much sophistication if one were inside alarge precisely controlled field of ionized particles to completely absorb thatsignal so that nothing would be left of it to reflect back. There are reports of thisbeing done, on then off, on then off, in regular sequence, playing with the radaroperator, letting him know the UFO can either be seen or not seen however theychoose.The same thing can be done with visible light, which is also an electromagneticradiation. It can also be absorbed so completely that nothing appears. Or thesignal, either visually or on radar, can be strengthened so as to appear larger andbrighter than it actually is. The plasma field surrounding them seldom allowsUFOs to be seen distinctly. Usually the image will be hazy and indeterminate.We might be sure that whenever extraterrestrials are seen, it's because theychoose to be seen, or else don't care whether they're seen or not. It's alsopossible that objects being picked up or let down could also be made invisible.The force fields supporting such objects could also absorb rather than emitelectromagnetic radiation thereby making whatever's inside it invisible.With these factors taken into account, it's easy to see how even very largeanimals can be picked up and put down again in plain sight on the verydoorsteps of NORAD and the world's most sophisticated surveillance systems.The tables could be removed from the officers' mess during a banquet if thatwere worth doing. Maybe some things like that have already happened. If so,they are deep, dark classified Top Secrets.Cattle mutilation, on the other hand, happens on plain ordinary farms andranches where it's practically impossible to make folks understand that things ofthat nature must be top defense secrets. The bizarre sex angle has stirred up somuch public curiosity that it's a real ticklish operation to shush the whole thing"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"up and make everyone believe it really did not happen at all. And if it did, it's aclassified secret anyway. If anything, this is harder to keep the lid on thanWatergate. How can it be effectively suppressed without giving away the wholegame? The official anti-UFO apologists have a real hard in fact an impossibletask cut out for them. In some ways, even their enemies should feel sorry forthem.The fact is, and UFOs want everyone to know it, that they can take anythingfrom anywhere at any time. Nothing in the world can stop them from doing that.If they wanted, they could take the president out of his armored limousine whilehe's surrounded by dozens of armed guards, or from the podium at theinauguration in front of that huge crowd. They could do that and it would be atotal mystery. NO ONE could prevent it or even know what had happened tohim. Or they could just as easily make off with his whole helicopter, or AirForce One.Cattle mutilation is only a beginning. It can be predicted that more and moreinexplicable things will be happening: automotive and power failures over largeareas, objects and animals moved from place to place, intense and paralyzingdarkness at strange times and places. (Joel 3:15, Amos 5:18, Rev. 9:2) Thingslike this are to be expected, and even stranger things far beyond our presentimagination. They'll be making their presence known to whomever it mayconcern and testing their control systems to make sure everything is in first classworking order when the time comes to use them all at once on a worldwidescale.If we are really being visited by the large numbers of extraterrestrials that UFOssuggest, many people will want to ask the simple question that has beenexcellently stated by Dr. Donald H. Menzel, a Harvard astronomer and archcritic of UFOs. While Dr. Menzel concedes \"that the concept of mannedspaceships is not an absolute impossibility,\" he goes on to ask: \"is it not naturalthat beings from outer space should exhibit an interest in us? But, when weconsider that these beings if indeed they are beings have been bugging us forcenturies, why should one not have landed and shown himself to the Presidentof the United States, to a member of the National Academy of Sciences, or atleast to some member of Congress?\" (Congressional Record, July 29, 1968,Donald E. Menzel, Ph.D.)Whoever has had the patience to follow our discussion this far will have seenthe answer to that. Extraterrestrials don't negotiate with national leaders, or theU. N., or with anyone in a position of authority here for exactly the same reasonthe U. S. has refused to negotiate with Cuba, or Israel with the P.L.O., or theArabs with Israel. Contacts would be a defacto recognition of the legitimacy ofthose being dealt with. On the other hand, UFOs have shown no animositytoward private individuals as such.Cattle mutilation should be a shocking eye opener in at least one respect.Extraterrestrials have sometimes been called \"angels,\" thoroughly neuteredcharacters, ineffectual nobodies with wings, long flowing robes, soft effeminatemanners and no business here. Over the years, they've been degraded to chubbyinfants and finally to mere infant heads with ear wings to decorate sentimentalChristmas cards. How that ever got distilled out of scripture where angels aredreadful and dreadfully destructive beings, is hard to imagine. Only the archenemies of heaven could ever have devised such lying caricatures. (Judges 13:6,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"2 Chronicles 21:12 and Genesis 26:31-34.)Now we've the chance to return to the original and correct perceptions. We'd dowell to forget those \"kindly space brothers whose sole aim is a mission ofsalvation.\" Extraterrestrials now in our skies had better be thought of as soldiers,excellent soldiers, superb soldiers, ENEMY soldiers. What they've come herewith is POWER. And what they don't have any at all of is soft spinelesssentimentality. They'll do what they've been sent here to do, clean or dirty, andwithout the least inhibition or squeamishness, let there be no doubt about that.... Deception and secrecy mislead many gullible followers, but they always carrywithin themselves the seeds of their own destruction. In any case, realknowledge can only be based on actual facts. Lies and fantasies, since theynever rise even to the level of illusion, can never become the basis forknowledge. So although lies and fantasies seem to have a quasi-existence, timesoon discards them, consigning everything of that nature to the universal trashheap, incinerator, or hell.Then even when this planet and solar system are immersed in unquenchable fire,there will be nothing to fear from that. There will be delightful companions of asimilar nature who know all about such things. They are coming here from veryfar away and will take infinite pains to make sure no good spirit gets lost in thatholocaust.The End* USAF Academy Photo Information:The U. S. Air Force Academy, a popular tourist attraction that overlooks thecattle mutilation hot spots such as Elizabeth, Colorado. Elizabeth, in one of thevery hardest hit areas, lies to the northeast of the USAF Academy about 25miles as the crow flies (or the mutilators). Lowry Air Force Bombing Range andBase are a few miles north of Elizabeth. The heavily guarded gate to NORAD's(North American Air Defense Command) super secret brain center insideCheyenne Mountain, where one mutilation occurred, is about 16 miles duesouth of the Academy. Ft. Carson is immediately east of that. End AFB andPeterson Field, with its very heavy military air traffic, are just north of Ft.Carson.The Cheyenne Mountain Zoo, where a buffalo was mutilated, is about 2 milesnorth of NORAD's gate and 14 miles south of the Academy. The Rocky FlatsA-bomb plant, where two cows were mutilated, is about 55 miles away, justnorth of Denver. The Canon City and Cripple Creek mutilation areas lie beyondPike's Peak, about 30 miles southwest of the Academy. Immediately west of theAcademy are extremely rugged mountains. The summit of Pike's Peak is about13 miles due southwest. Since suburban sprawl, largely military oriented,extends a long distance every way from Colorado Springs, Security andFountain, someone must have had a very hard time finding close in cattle tomutilate, settling in one case for a buffalo.Credits"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
