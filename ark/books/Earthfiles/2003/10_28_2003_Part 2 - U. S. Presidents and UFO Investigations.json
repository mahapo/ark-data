Continued from Part 1:October 28, 2003 - Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada - Moments after thephotograph above was taken in late June 1982, Steven Spielberg screenedE.T.:The Extraterrestrial for President Ronald Reagan and First Lady, NancyReagan. Near the end of the movie, Reagan allegedly leaned over to Spielbergand stated, \"You know, I bet there aren't six people in this room who know justhow true this really is.\" (Source: Reagan Library)President Ronald Reagan with Apollo Astronaut, Harrison Schmitt,in October 1982 at the former Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF), Roswell, New Mexico.In October 1982, a few months after Spielberg screened the movie E.T. forPresident and Mrs. Reagan, President Reagan and Apollo Astronaut HarrisonSchmitt, one of the last men to walk on the moon, arrived on the tarmac at theRoswell (New Mexico) Industrial Air Center, formally known as the RoswellArmy Air Field (RAAF). Moments after this photograph was taken, Reaganspoke near the hanger where rumor has it that alien bodies were taken followinga 1947 extraterrestrial crash. In his speech, Reagan made reference to E.T: TheExtraterrestrial. Some believe Reagan's action was an indicator of his stronginterest in the subject. (Source: Reagan Library)UFO researchers have spent a lot of time in American presidential libraries andthe National Archives trying to find paper trails that will connect dates ofalleged UFO crashes with meetings between American presidents and militaryleaders, scientists and high ranking administration officials. Grant Cameron has"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"worked since 1974 at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, andworks as a building facility manager. Privately, he would like to come up withthe smoking gun that shows the U. S. government has had knowledge ofextraterrestrial interaction with this planet for a long time. He, like Stan Gordon,is convinced that a non-terrestrial object came down in Kecksburg, Pennsylvaniaon December 9, 1965.With the Sci-Fi Channel announcement that it might seek legal action againstNASA and other government agencies for documents about Kecksburg, Grantresearched President Lyndon B. Johnson's schedule to see what happened in thehours after the Pennsylvania event.Interview:Grant Cameron, a building facility manager at the University of Manitoba;reporter and producer of www.presidentialufo.com, Manitoba, Winnipeg,Canada: \"We now know that they (Sci-Fi Channel) are going after NASA forfiles because there were NASA people at the (Kecksburg) site. So, I pulled thePresident's schedule (Lyndon B. Johnson) when Kecksburg occurred I think itwas on a Thursday night the President was at his Austin ranch. The very nextmorning after the crash, James Webb who was the head of NASA - appeared atthe ranch. All the Joint Chiefs of Staff appeared at the ranch.Whatever photographs were taken on December 10, 1965, of Joint Chiefs of Staffat the LBJ Ranch, Grant Cameron could not find any. This photograph is of the JointChiefsof Staff when they met with President Johnson (1963-1969) at the LBJ Ranch outsideAustin, Texas,on December 22, 1964, a year before the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania incident. Source: LBJWhite House Photo Office Collection, Lyndon Baines Johnson Library, Austin, Texas.The Governor of Pennsylvania appeared I don't think it was the next day afterthe crash but the day after that. For example, the Joint Chiefs of Staff was listedas a 'Viet Nam budget discussion.' You have all these people sort of appearing,but when it comes to trying to nail down what those meetings were about or toget the records of the contacts of what was done at the ranch, there is basicallynothing there on paper.J. Leo Bourassa's boss the head of the Office of Emergency Planning, which isnow known as FEMA - was a fellow by the name of Buford Ellington."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Buford Ellington, served as 1960 Chairman,Democratic National convention, and head of Office of EmergencyPlanning in the Lyndon B. Johnson administration.The Kecksburg crash occurred on a Thursday night (December 9, 1965). ThePresident flew back to the White House on the Sunday evening (December 12,1965) and Buford Ellington met off the record with the President the very nextday just outside the Oval Office, in a lounge inside the Oval Office. So you haveall these things that seem to indicate that all the right people were movingaround and were there. But the actual paper trail about what was discussed isnot there yet. President Lyndon B. Johnson Had Huge Outer Space FileIt's kind of strange that LBJ probably has one of the biggest outer space files.That's where the UFO files are, in the outer space file. Johnson was fascinatedwith outer space. When Sputnik first went up, he was at the ranch in Austin andhe talked about how he went outside the ranch walking and watching Sputnikgo over. He was then a Congressman and was very upset that the Russians hadbeat us into space. He was very interested and has a lot of letters. I recovered aletter he actually wrote as Vice President and that is very rare to find aPresident's letter or Vice President's letter dealing with UFOs where theythemselves answer. It's usually cut off by someone way down the chain ofcommand. But he has massive outer space files.However, most UFO files in presidential libraries are just letters. For example,when Jimmy Carter made his famous promise that he would release the UFOsecret, there were 9,000 letters written to the Carter White House and theyactually took a photograph and I have a picture of the 9,000 letters that came inthere.Nine thousand letters concerning UFO phenomena were sent to theWhite House after President Jimmy Carter made a promiseto release the UFO files. Source: Carter Library.Jimmy Carter Wanted to Open Up U. S. Government UFO"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"FilesWhat people don't realize is that when Jimmy Carter made the promise torelease all the U. S. government's UFO files, he put an exemption where therewere national security concerns. He said if it had to do with national security ornew weapons system or plane, then he would not release it.The Carter one that deals with Shirley MacLaine is fairly impressive. I haven'tconfirmed this myself, but the story is that the actor Nicholas Cage went on theDave Letterman Show in 1995 and stated that Shirley MacLaine had told himthat Jimmy Carter had told her that he had had access to a crashed flying saucerand the bodies. Later Shirley MacLaine was asked about it by a researchernamed Art Greenfield from Florida on Larry King- Live. MacLaine denied whathe said about the hangar and the bodies. She just said, 'He didn't tell me that,but he did tell me that what I put in Out On A Limb was basically true and thatthere were craft and beings and that he (President Carter) couldn't and wouldn'tdisclose what he knew about it. This was probably her most significantcomment.The vast majority of the ET stories seem to center around Jimmy Carter.Whether or not he was briefed, there seems to be fairly good evidence thatJimmy Carter did accomplish an awful lot more than people give him credit forin trying to get this out into the open.IN ALL THE DOCUMENTS YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM FOIAREQUESTS, IS THERE ANYTHING THAT RELATES DIRECTLY TO THESHIRLEY MAC LAINE STORY?No, not FOIA. In fact, I was at the Carter Library and there is one archivist atthe Carter Library who is very interested in UFOs and I run the majority of anyrumor stories I have by him. He checks them out and if you heard the ShirleyMacLaine bit, she said that Jimmy Carter told her on a number of occasions thatthere is no record of her having talked to Jimmy Carter, according to the CarterLibrary. That's for the years when he was President (1976-1980). So, if it is true,then it's likely it was something that happened after he became president. Thereare a number of different stories dealing with Jimmy Carter, but again, nothingto back it up.I thought we were close to confirming that Jimmy Carter had been briefed! Youwould have the story of the century. U. S. presidents have only twice in 55 yearsbeen asked a question about UFOs. If you could ever get to the president on therecord to talk about the subject, I think it would be enough to break the thingwide open. But I think it's clear that insiders don't want any president talking onthe record. When I was at the Eisenhower Library, out of 22,000 pages ofmaterial, they gave me a list of five documents one was a Telex inviting PresidentEisenhower to a UFO conference. And there was a CIA Robertson Panel report.But other than that, there was like only five documents out of 22,000 pages.There was literally nothing there. Government Ops Plan for Alien Invasion by Robert M. Collins, 1996:\"Relating to these quotes of an elite committee of members known asMJ-12 who reportedly dealt with the aliens and their recovered artifacts,the following has been uncovered over the years of research. MJ-12 had acover under which it operated and that cover was reportedly the Office ofEmergency Preparedness, Special Facility's Division.\" J. Leo Bourassa and the Special Facilities Division, WhiteHouseI just came back from the Johnson Library where there is a document I was"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"checking about the Kecksburg crash. The person who is identified in the BlueBook file that Stan Gordon obtained was a guy by the name of J. Leo Bourassa(BORE-uh-saw). He was in the section known as the Special Facilities Divisioninside the Executive Office of the White House. I couldn't really figure out whatthis organization was. I did find a document at the Johnson Library where thisfellow Bourassa is on this sheet talking about Kecksburg. There were phonecalls going back and forth in the Blue Book file report. This Bourassa guy wasthe one who investigated the power black out in New York City in 1965. In thatdocument, he talks about the three things that they were looking at that causedthe power black out in New York. This is exactly one month before theKecksburg crash and he mentions 'sabotage, enemy actions or unknownphenomenon.'November 23, 1965, memorandum about unexplained power blackoutin northeast United States on November 9, 1965. Source: Lyndon B.Johnson's Presidential Library, Austin, Texas.It took me quite awhile to determine who Bourassa was. I learned that he wasthe guy who ran Mount Weather. If there were a nuclear attack, that's the placeoutside Washington, D., C. where they take the top officials of the governmentunderground. [Howe's note: Mt. Weather is an underground military basecarved deep inside a granite mountain near Bluemont, Virginia about 46 milesfrom Washington, D. C. The goal is \"continuity of government (COG) under theauthority of the top secret National Programming Office (NPO).]When I checked about him at the Eisenhower Library, they did have somematerial on him that he had written to President Eisenhower. At the time,whatever section of the government he was in, he wanted out because he wasbored with nothing to do. He is one of the few men referenced that he wasaround, but in terms of details about the Special Facility Division nothing. Special Advisory Committee to the Presidenton Alien Matters, FEMA Special Facilities Division,Tracking UFOs at Mt. Weather, Virginia"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"But that was the division run by J. Leo Bourassa who was involved in theKecksburg, Pennsylvania crash who was in the Blue Book file and he's making aphone call about some piece or wreckage fragment they had found. In another1996 article, Robert Collins puts up what he calls an MJ-12 PanelOrganizational Chart reported for the years 1984-1985. He has a flow chartwhich is connected to the flow chart shown on the TV program, UFOCover-Up: Live, in 1988. In this flow chart, he has the president at the top ofthe flow chart and right under, he has Special Advisory Committee to thePresident on Alien Matters and right below them, he has FEMA, SpecialFacilities Division, as cover office for MJ-12.The other thing that ties this in is that Brigadier General Stephen Lovekin of theU. S. Army National Guard Reserves in 1997 was in Washington for StevenGreer's Disclosure Project panel to try to convince Congress to do something.During that testimony, Brig. Gen. Lovekin says that he was at Mt. Weather andthat he was talking to a guy who told him that Mt. Weather was being used totrack UFOs.So out of the blue, here is a guy six years ago who suddenly talks about Mt.Weather and UFOs and Mt. Weather was where the Special Facility Divisionwas supposed to be. But as to finding the files for the Special Facility Division, Isaid I was at the National Archives and I spent two days going through hugeboxes of files and couldn't find a single piece of paper that even mentioned theorganization.So, you're stuck with trying to track stuff about this guy Bourassa from fortyyears ago and it's not in the National Archives. I copied everything that was atthe Johnson Library which is 50 or 60 pages on meetings that occurred, butreally nothing substantive. It wasn't until two weeks after I came back from theJohnson Library that I even figured out from a 1991 Time Magazine article whoBourassa was. Back at the point I was at the National Archives, I still didn'tknow what the Special Facilities Division was. It's mentioned in the KecksburgBlue Book Files and according to Robert Collins, it is one of the key units(related to MJ-12 and monitoring extraterrestrial activities on Earth).When I got that piece of information that Bouraassa had made phone contactfrom Mount Weather on the Kecksburg crash you get a situation where you havea guy who is in touch with everybody. He is basically running what is nowknown as FEMA the underground thing. He is making this phone call and youhave a situation where he is in contact with the Joint Chiefs of Staff CommandCenter and with all the fire departments, all the police departments. He has athis fingertips every major phone number because that's what he deals with emergencies and types of emergencies that would also involve a UFO crash. Soin that sense, you may have a situation where this thing called the SpecialFacilities Division is the unit that is used to bring the people to the site. At theKecksburg crash, we are trying to figure out why Dr. Eric Walker, why NASA,why all these people got there so fast when this crash went down. You mighthave this place, Mount Weather, that was coordinating all the special peoplewho were being notified to go in there.At the National Archives actual situation room file for this Special Facilitydivision, I went through just about everything that was in FEMA or at that timeit was called the Office of Emergency Planning (OEP). I went through almostevery document that they had that seemed to apply like the file names at theNational Archives and I couldn't find a document that even mentioned theSpecial Facilities Division.At the Johnson Library, they had a couple of files that had a bunch of stuff inthem. But at the National Archives which is a pretty big place, has an awful lotof material, there was not a single piece of paper. It was like it was gone. Therewas a lot of stuff on other departments, but this key department that seemed tohave been involved seemed to be completely gone. So whatever happened, it'sbeen very effective. There is just nothing there. And you get a situation where interms of the president, there is nothing in terms of documents and also nothing"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"in terms of a paper trail of actual contact with the presidents. We need to askpresidents this question: Did some one walk into your office and give you anofficial briefing where you have to sign for it and some one told you what wasgoing on?HAVE YOU TRIED TO GET A MEETING WITH JIMMY CARTER TO ASKTHAT QUESTION?I haven't. I know Billy Cox in Florida who I've dealt with for fifteen years hasmade numerous attempts through Florida Today, the Gannett news operation,to try to get a news interview with Jimmy Carter and there is absolutely noresponse whatsoever. Presidents are very hard to get to. Jimmy Carter is the typeof guy who says he will never lie to people and he has indicated the positionthat I've sort of come to which is the presidents know, but there is really notmuch that they can do about it. You probably know that the people who did thedocumentary, Out of the Blue, contacted Jimmy Carter at a book signing. Theyput their questioner in a wheelchair to slow down the book line. They askedCarter about his UFO sighting and he was happy to answer. Then they askedhim what he did in the White House, which is pretty close to the question theyshould ask.What Jimmy Carter said is, 'There are a lot of different answers, but no one hasproof of things.' Which is sort of what I'm tending now to think that what wehear in UFOlogy as leaks from intelligence people might be nothing more thantrying to convince us that they have control over a situation that they basicallydon't have control over. I think the president is told, but I think he is also toldabout the facts of animal mutilations or human abductions in which we don'treally have much control over the situation at all. The aliens are basicallyrunning the show and we're here watching and there is nothing we can do. If youget in the situation where the president is suddenly faced with these questions,you are the commander of the military, you are constitutionally responsible forthe protection of the American people while millions of people and children arebeing abducted what do you do about this, Mr. President? These type of thingsare issues no president really wants to address because it doesn't really gainthem anything.SO PEOPLE HAVE BECOME VERY SKILLED TO MAKE CERTAIN THATANYTHING THAT WOULD REINFORCE A PRESIDENT WHO DECIDEDTO ANSWER A QUESTION ABOUT HIS BEING DEBRIEFED, THEREWILL BE NO PAPER TRAIL TO CORROBORATE.Exactly. Or there may be so few people there that can produce a paper trail.There might be only one or two people who actually brief a president and theymight be outside the Executive Office. Bill Clinton supposedly said there is agovernment inside the government and there is nothing he can do about them aclaim he allegedly made to a reporter, according to Steven Greer. Brig. Gen. Robert B. Landry, USAF (1948-1953)Or if you go back to President Harry Truman. Truman's Air Advisor was RobertLandry from February 1948 to January 1953. He was in charge of what is nowknown as Air Force One, the U. S. President's plane. In the oral histories at theTruman Library, there is an admission that he debriefed President Truman everythree months. But he said he briefed him only orally. So there was no writtenrecord. This is the key thing."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Brig. Gen. Robert B. Landry, USAF (1948-1953),U. S. Air Force Aide to President Harry S. Truman pinning on a medal.THE CONTENT OF THE DEBRIEFINGS, DID HE EXPLAIN WHAT IT WAS?No, he just stated that he had briefed him every three months, that he was aliaison with the CIA and that Truman wanted to know and be kept informed.There was no real detail as to what he was being told.BUT WAS THE CONTEXT EXTRATERRESTRIAL?Yes, I would imagine, but he didn't specify exact details. Truman implied Landrywas being given stuff and was the liaison passing on whatever he could to thePresident, but no detail about content.LANDRY HE DIDN'T SPECIFY THAT PART OF THE REASON FOR THEORAL BRIEFING WAS BECAUSE HE WAS TALKING ABOUTEXTRATERRESTRIAL MATTERS?No. No. It was just in an interview that Landry was doing and he went fromquestion to question and wasn't dealing with it. In another oral history, he talksabout how he himself had been involved with UFOs in World War II and whenradar first came in. Landry was with the 8th Army Air Force in Hawaii and hesaid they saw a number of these unknown objects on the screen, but he does notsay he told Truman. But I would imagine that he came into office as the airadvisor and was quite believing in this stuff that was going on and probably toldTruman, but it doesn't appear in any of the Truman records. Further, in thepublic record, Truman is basically skeptical when he talks about UFOs.BUT PRIVATELY, THE IMPLICATION IS THAT HE WAS BEING BRIEFEDORALLY TO PREVENT THERE BEING A PAPER TRAIL ON THINGSCLASSIFIED IN THE INTEREST OF NATIONAL SECURITY. SOMEBODYWAS MAKING SURE THERE WAS NO PAPER TRAIL AND WE AREASSUMING THAT MAYBE PART OF THAT DISCUSSION WAS RELATEDTO CRASHED DISKS?Oh, sure. Because if you take a look at Truman after the Roswell crash. I lookedvery specifically after the Roswell crash to see all of the key witnesses likeVandenberg and Doolittle, all these big guys who have been rumored to havehandled the Roswell crash from Washington, D. C. I looked at their schedulesand Truman's schedules, they are going through someone else. There is no directcontact. Provost Marshall Edwin Easley,Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF), Roswell, New MexicoIt's the same as Edwin Easley (Provost Marshall at Roswell, New Mexico ArmyAir Force) who was in charge of security supposedly at the crash site. There isabsolutely no record in the Truman Library of Edwin Easley ever meetingTruman, and yet Edwin Easley's daughter says that her father would not talkafter making a promise with President Truman. Yet, there is no record of thatpromise."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"The same with Brig. General Roger Ramey there is absolutely no record in theTruman Library of him ever talking with the President, ever having written to thePresident, or having met the President. And yet, George Filer who runs Filer'sfiles, says he interviewed Mrs. Ramey and she said that she and her husband hadmet the president a number of times. They were very good friends. So, that's whyI say about the paper trail if you get these key witnesses I try to link them intothe president, have they met the president? is there any correspondence betweenthe president? In almost every case, it is missing. But when you take a look atthe Easley or Roger Ramey cases, it's pretty conclusive that they did meet withthe president. That would indicate that the presidential records are not ascomplete as they want us to believe.To be continued in Part 3.More Information:If anyone has more information to contribute to linking American presidents toknowledge about crashed aerial vehicles from outer space, please contact GrantCameron at:E-MAIL: presidentialUFO @presidency.comWe b s it e :http://members.aol.com/poesgirl/mtweathr.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
