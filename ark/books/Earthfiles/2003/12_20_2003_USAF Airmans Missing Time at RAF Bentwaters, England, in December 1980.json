Map © 1997 by LarryWarren and Peter Robbins. December 20, 2003 Phoenix, Arizona - Beginning Friday, December 12th, theSci Fi Channel broadcast a docudrama about the famous alleged UFO landingincidents at the American and British Air Force joint RAF Bentwaters base inEngland, near the Rendlesham forest. The exact time line of what happened,and when, has been part of the confusion over the years as various eyewitnesseshave had different descriptions of events at different times and dates.What has become clear is that highly strange events occurred on at least threenights, beginning at 3 a.m. in the early morning of December 26, 1980. That'swhen U. S. Air Force Airman John Burroughs, who was on patrol with anothersecurity airman near the RAF Bentwaters East Gate, was asked to investigateodd lights that were reported near Capel Green beyond the Woodbridge AirField. When Airman Burroughs reported back to Central Security Control thatthere were in fact eerie lights, screaming sounds and animals making noises, itwas decided that higher ranking Staff Sergeant Jim Penniston should join theinvestigation."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Guard shack at East Gate, RAF Bentwaters, England. Photograph © by Anthony James.The three men were walking through the Rendlesham forest toward what theythought was a distant light when suddenly, the light was right upon them andthe three men dove to the ground, scared. Burroughs said, \"more scared than I'veever been in my life.\" Penniston described an electricity in the air and said hecould see a dark, glass-like surface behind the bright light and described theobject as triangular with symbols on its surface. Burroughs does not remember atriangular shape or symbols, but emphasizes how strange the light was and howscared they all were. Burroughs even remembers Penniston ordering him to firehis weapon at the object, but none of the three men were armed with weapons.The light moved away and up into the sky and the men retreated back to thebase without filing a formal written report in the Shift Commander's log book.But in the morning, Bentwaters Deputy Base Commander, Lt. Col. Charles I.Halt, asked that Burroughs make a report and this is what John wrote:\"On the night of December 25-26 at around 03:00 while on patrol down atEast Gate, myself and my partner saw lights coming from the woods dueeast of the gate. The lights were red and blue, the red one above the blueone and they were flashing on and off. ...There was radio traffic back andforth and the decision was made by the shift commander that I shouldaccompany two security guys into the woods. \"On the night of December 25-26, (1980) at around 03:00 while on patroldown at East Gate, myself and my partner saw lights coming from thewoods due east of the gate. The lights were red and blue, the red oneabove the blue one and they were flashing on and off. ...There was radiotraffic back and forth and the decision was made by the shift commanderthat I should accompany two security guys into the woods. \"We crossed a small open field that led into the trees where the lights werecoming from and as we were coming into the trees, there were strangenoises, like a woman was screaming, also the woods lit up and you couldhear the farm animals making a lot of noise and there was a lot ofmovement in the woods. All three of us hit the ground and whatever it wasstarted moving back. ...After a minute or two, we got up and moved intothe trees and the lights moved out into the open field. \"Everything seemed like it was different when we were in that clearing, thesky didn't seem the same ...it was like a weird feeling, like everythingseemed slower than you were actually doing; and all of a sudden when theobject was gone, everything was like normal again. \"{The UFO was} a bank of lights, differently colored lights that threw offan image of like a craft. I never saw anything metallic or anything hard.\"The next night of December 26 to 27, John Burroughs was not on the base, butheard that more strange lights were reported that night and that Deputy BaseCommander, Lt. Col. Halt, was involved in that investigation."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Then the third night of December 27 to 28, John Burroughs was back on thebase to witness and participate in even more dramatic events that includedbeams shining down on the nuclear weapons storage area at Bentwaters. Backthen in 1980, government officials would not admit that nuclear weapons werestored at the British base, but now it has been confirmed that nuclear weaponswere there and definitely were a target of interest to the moving blue lights andtheir beams. In fact, Airman John Burroughs remembers that an investigativeteam specifically inspected the nuclear weapons the next day in the aftermath ofthe unidentified lights and beams.\"Weapons Storage Area,\" which in 1980 housed nuclear weapons at RAF Bentwaters.Photo taken in mid-1990s with 200mm telephoto lens © by Peter Robbins.Thus, USAF Airman John Burroughs was involved on two of the three nights ofUFO activity at Bentwaters December 25 to December 28, but was neverinterviewed for the Sci Fi Channel docudrama. He is troubled that the programemphasized only parts of the events and implied that participants had beenthreatened with sodium pentathol and other manipulative efforts to keep peoplequiet about what really happened. John says he doesn't recall intimidation byanyone even though military eyewitnesses on the night of December 28 recallseeing John Burroughs enter, or get on top of, the object casting the bright light.I think it is important to share what he remembers that goes beyond the Sci FiChannel production. Here now is John Burroughs who was 19-years-old inDecember 1980, is now in the US Air Force Reserve, pending call back to activeduty in 2004, describing what he, Col. Halt and others saw on the third night ofDecember 27-28, 1980.Interview:John Burroughs, United States Air Force Tech Sergeant in the USAFReserves and Protection Coordinator, Medtronics, Phoenix, Arizona:\"When we got out to the base that night on Dec. 27, stuff had already startedhappening out in the woods. so at that point, we went down to the back gatewhich was East Gate and made our presence known. They were able to contactthe party out there who was Col. Halt and we were given permission to go downto the area where Col. Halt and his party were.We initially went down to where the light-alls were and where the first landingsite was (Dec. 25-26) and waited there and eventually I was called out to Col.Halt and his party.SO NOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, THAT THE TRULY DRAMATICEVENTS HAPPENED ON THE NIGHT OF DECEMBER 27, NOT THE26TH?Right. There is another incident on December 27 to 28, yeah."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"LET'S GO INTO THIS ONE BECAUSE IF I UNDERSTAND FROMINTERVIEWING YOU AND JIM PENNISTON AND OTHERS, IT IS THISNIGHT OF DECEMBER 27-28, 1980, THAT INVOLVED NOT ONLY ACRAFT, BUT POSSIBLY ENTITIES. CAN YOU EXPLAIN IN DETAIL WHATYOU REMEMBER OF THE 27TH TO THE 28TH?When I met with Col. Halt and his group, they were starting to come up a littlebit from the area where they had been and I met up with them. He started sayingthey had seen some strange lights and so he started asking me some questionsabout what happened to me (on December 25-26). Then shortly after that, hepointed up into the sky because one of the guys with us said, 'There's some ofthose objects floating around up there in the sky again.'Up in the sky at one point, there were three or four and it's hard to explainanymore than that they appeared to be not like stars. They were transparent blueobjects that appeared to me almost like if you blew bubbles and how theywould float around and the wind would affect them and they would go oblong.They were up in the sky and they were flying around.He said they had seen them for quite a period of time prior to my being outthere, flying in their general direction. At that point, a couple of them broke offand went over toward the area of Bentwaters where they had a weapons storagearea and you could see beams of white light being beamed down from themdown into that area.The other two came toward our general direction. One of them shot downtowards us, shot out a beam of light at us, and then shot over the top of us andwent right toward the area where the group was with the light-alls. It shot downthrough the area where the light-alls were. They couldn't get the light-alls towork and as the lights went through that area, all the light-alls came on and off,flickered on and off. Then the \"bubble\" lights shot back up into the sky anddisappeared in the distance.JOHN, WHAT WAS YOUR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHY THEREWOULD BE LIGHT-ALLS OUT THERE IN THE RENDLESHAM FOREST?The way it was explained to me was that initially when the flight on duty thatnight saw strange lights in the forest again, Col. Halt and I'm not sure if this wasplanned prior to the night of Dec. 27 or was planned after they saw it but whatthey did was take light-alls out to the area where we had first seen all the objectsthe first night (Dec. 25-26) and then I don't know if they were going to light upthe area to investigate it or they were going to light up the area becausesomething appeared there. That was never totally explained to me, but theyhauled quite a few light-alls out in that area.HOW FAR ARE YOU FROM THE LIGHT-ALLS AND WHAT HAPPENED?I'm probably 100 yards or more from the light-alls where I met up with Col.Halt. The only people I remember for sure out there that night was MasterSergeant Ball, Lt. Englund, and there was a Sgt. Bustinza who was also there.AND THIS IS THE FAMOUS ADRIAN BUSTINZA THAT LARRY WARRENHAS TALKED ABOUT?Right.WHAT TRANSPIRES BETWEEN THE GROUP OF YOU AND WHERE THELIGHT-ALLS ARE?Whatever we saw the night before, was there again. It was like all of a sudden itwas in the distance. And Col. Halt is saying, 'Look at that!' I look out and aboutthat time also there were a couple more blue lights flying up above, up in thesky. They said, 'Is that what you saw the first night?' And I looked at it and said,'It looks a lot like what we saw in the distance from the gate the first night.'Sgt. Bustinza and I from looking at it, and we had radios and we were talking to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the tower which was in the weapons storage area and they also spotted an objectthat appeared in the distance all of a sudden. We verified with them that it wasout there and a discussion was made and I asked Col. Halt if it was OK for me togo out to get a closer look and see. He gave me permission and sent Bustinzawith me. It seems for a short period of time as we started walking toward it, itstarted coming towards us. When it did that, the tower we were talking with alsosaid it seemed to be moving toward our general direction. We started runningtoward it.At that point as we were running, Bustinza was on my right hand side, wentdown to the ground and I kept going. And then just that quick, all of a sudden whatever we were going to was gone and I was standing out in the middle of thefield and it was like everything was different. There was nothing there in thedistance and everything seemed different. And there was nothing there anymore.After talking with Bustinza on the way back, he claimed that he did not falldown. He said some force pushed him to the ground and held him down thereand wouldn't let him come up. Did John Burroughs Touch An Object in the Light?YOU HAVE TOLD ME IN THE PAST THAT YOU REMEMBERED BEINGCLOSE TO A LIGHT AND AT LEAST REACHING TOWARDS THE LIGHT.JIM PENNISTON HAS TOLD ME HE REMEMBERS BEING CLOSE TO ALIGHT AND REACHING WITH HIS LIGHT TOWARD A SILVER SURFACEON WHICH HE COULD SEE SOME KIND OF RAISED SYMBOLS. DO YOUHAVE ANY RECALL OF REACHING TOWARDS THE LIGHT AND SEEINGSOME KIND OF SILVER REFLECTIVE SURFACE? That's weird because the closest I ever felt I was ever to an object would havebeen the first night (December 25-26, 1980). I don't remember like reaching outor being able to identify any object.The third night (December 27-28, 1980) and it started when Bustinza and I werewalking back. The people behind me were saying that I was on top of somethingor right into the light and then the light disappeared and I was there.I do not, do not, I don't want to call it missing time totally, but I do know fromthe point when I felt like I was close to whatever this was the third night and itwas gone, it seemed like there was some time missing. It seemed like there was itjust didn't seem possible it would be like looking at a wall. You're right ready totouch it and then the wall is not there. That's the best way I can describe that.THAT MOMENT FOR YOU IS THAT YOU ARE RUNNING TOWARD THELIGHT. HALT IS RUNNING WITH YOU. BUSTINZA IS RUNNING WITHYOU. EGLUND IS RUNNING WITH YOU?No, none of them are running with me. They are standing back. Only Bustinzaand I were running towards the light.HAVE YOU PERSONALLY TALKED WITH ADRIAN BUSTINZA THATNIGHT OR ANY TIME BACK THEN ABOUT WHAT HE REMEMBERED?Yes, I talked with him a little bit that night and then a few years ago, over tenyears ago. That's where he verified that he thought there was a force that heldhim down and he told me that I was definitely on top of an object.WHEN HE TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE DEFINITELY ON TOP OF ANOBJECT, WHAT DETAILS DID HE GIVE?He just said that I continued to run. He could see me and it seemed like theobject came toward me and at that point and I don't know he described 'on top.'I don't know if I was on top of it or immersed in it, but the object and I met I"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"guess is the best way I could say what he said had happened.AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MEMORY WHATSOEVER OF TOUCHING,RUNNING TO GET INSIDE OF OR ON TOP OF WHATEVER WASEMANATING THIS LIGHT?I have no memory of that whatsoever.I KNOW YOU TRIED AN HYPNOSIS SESSION WITH JOHN CARPENTERIN MISSOURI BACK IN THE EARLY 1990S. I WAS THERE. WE NEVERCOULD PENETRATE THAT BLANK EITHER.Right. But I did go under hypnosis prior to that.AND IN THAT EARLIER HYPNOSIS SESSION, WHAT WAS IT THAT YOUREMEMBERED?As far as what comes out under hypnosis?YES.It's hard to deal with because this is where, this is why I don't want to totally saythat the Jim Penniston, Larry Warren, or anybody else is totally too bizarre. Butit comes out that there was alien contact, that they purposefully picked that areato make contact with certain individuals, that they seek out certain individuals tohave contact with, that there will be a point in time in the future where they willcome back to us for a reason, that - oh, God! that they are here among us as faras they are in different areas, that they are underground and they travel from faraway. They have bases stationed along the way and quite frankly, to see thevideotape afterwards and the people who were in the room, everyone was kindof in shock. I don't know why this information came out or how it came out.DO YOU HAVE ANY MEMORY OF THE TYPE OF ENTITIES WHO WERECOMMUNICATING THIS TO YOU? DO YOU HAVE ANY IMPRESSIONABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY FELL INTO THE CATEGORY OFWHAT IS REFERRED TO TODAY AS GREYS OR BLONDS ORREPTILIANS OR OTHER?No, it didn't come out that way. It came out more I don't know a lot about thedifferent ones you described it just came out more that they were here for areason and almost comes out like they are not necessarily going to stopsomething, but they are here to see what happens to us because whateverhappens now will affect what they are and what could happen to them.THAT DOVETAILS INTO JIM PENNISTON'S MEMORY UNDER HYPNOSISTHAT THE BENTWATERS VEHICLES, LIGHTS, WERE ASSOCIATEDWITH TIME TRAVELERS FROM A DISTANT FUTURE WHO HAVE BEENCOMING BACK THROUGH TIME TRYING TO SAVE THE CIVILIZATIONFAR IN THE FUTURE AND REFERRED TO US, THE CURRENT LIFEFORM ON THIS PLANET, AS 'BAND-AIDS.'WOULD THE CONCEPT OF TIME TRAVELERS FROM THE FUTURE FITANY OF WHAT YOU RECALLED UNDER ANY OF YOUR HYPNOSISSESSION?To the extent yeah, the way it was coming out, the individual who was doing thehypnosis was trying to find out and all that was coming out was that there wasgrave danger coming up and they were here to observe, to find out, that theymade contact with certain individuals for a reason because there will be a pointin time when it will be necessary to re-contact us. And then it became to me, Idon't understand hypnosis. But at one point, it almost seemed like I wasn'tmyself. I was speaking like somebody else and they actually, the individual(hypnotist) trying to get information, they wouldn't give him the information. Itwas that they (in the lights) were definitely here for a reason. The contact wasmade for a reason and there would be a point in time somewhere in the futurethat there would be re-contact."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" What Is the \"Grave Danger\" in the Future?SO WE'RE NOW AT THE END OF 2003, ALMOST INTO 2004, AS YOUAND I SPEAK NOW. THIS OCCURRED THE EARLY MORNING OFDECEMBER 26 TO THE EARLY MORNING OF DECEMBER 28, 1980.Right.SO, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 23 YEARS. IN THESE 23 YEARS, HAVEYOU EVER HAD A DREAM, AN INTUITION, THAT SOMETHING WASCOMING THAT YOU'VE HAD VISUAL IMPRESSION OR ANYTHING THATHAS HAUNTED YOU ABOUT LINKING BACK TO THAT NIGHT OF THE27-28TH OF DECEMBER (1980), THAT RELATES TO SOME GRAVETHING COMING THAT THESE ENTITIES ARE STUDYING?I can't say this for a fact, but I feel this time frame now is the time if what reallycame out under hypnosis or whatever happened out there really had somethingto do I think this is going to be the time frame in the next two to three years.DO YOU HAVE ANY DREAM IMPRESSION OR INTUITIVE SENSEABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE COMING?Oh, I think my personal I can only say this because I don't want to come out thatI know for sure but just a feeling of I think the whole issue with the Middle East there's a lot more to it than the public has been made aware. I think there isgetting to be a huge show down between this is not coming from anything, Ican't explain how I have this feeling there is going to be a huge showdown soonin the Middle East and it's going to involve the major world powers. And I thinkthere is going to be a defining moment for our whole civilization and I think itwill happen within the next three or four years.WILL IT INVOLVE NUCLEAR WEAPON EXCHANGE, DO YOU THINK?This is not my conscious level (of mind), but what came out under hypnosis wasthat the nukes were interesting to them, but they were very much moreconcerned with 'Star Wars' the lasers and everything else. They were much moreconcerned about what is going to happen involving outer space over nuclearweapons.The whole key to this involved Mars, it involved China, Mars, us and it didn'treally say the Middle East, but involved what controls our economy and world.The big show down was coming in that frame.YOU MENTIONED THAT ANOTHER DISCREPANCY FROM YOUR POINTOF VIEW WITH THE SCI-FI PRODUCTION WAS THAT THE FACT THATTHEY HAD WITNESSES WHO SAID THEY HAD BEEN THREATENEDEITHER WITH SODIUM PENTATHOL OR SOME WAY TO KEEP THEIRMOUTHS SHUT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT BENTWATERS AND YOUWERE MAKING THE DISTINCTION THAT THAT HAD NOT HAPPENEDTO YOU.Right.JOHN, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY LEFT YOU ALONE BECAUSE YOUWERE THE ONLY ONE WHO ENDED UP ON OR IN WHATEVER THEVEHICLE WAS BEHIND THE LIGHT?If you go down that route why would they still leave me alone and mess witheveryone else? Why wouldn't they be coming after me and interrogating memore to find out what happened? Why would they leave me alone?THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION, BUT WHY ARE YOU - SUCH A KEYFIGURE, - NOT INVOLVED IN ANY WAY IN THE BENTWATERSRECREATION ON THE SCI FI CHANNEL PRODUCTION?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I don't know. As a matter of fact what I thought was strange is when you see theshow, they focus a lot on Col. Halt and Penniston. On my particular night (Dec.25-26}, they talked to Cabanzak (Sp?) and Penniston. But they didn't talk withme. They actually showed a picture of me and a lot they zero in a lot on writtenstatements and one I think was mine.BUT YOU'VE BEEN HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. WHY COULDN'TTHEY INTERVIEW YOU LIVE FOR THIS PRODUCTION?I don't know. Even after the show, they had a website and I sent them a shortmessage stating that I was wondering there was a caption asking if you had anyknowledge of it (Bentwaters incident)?
