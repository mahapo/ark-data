Staff will be postedat checkpoints to look for travelers who show symptoms of the still-unidentifiedSARS virus. Photograph © 2003 by Associated Press.March 31, 2003 Hong Kong, China - SARS stands for severe acuterespiratory syndrome, a deadly new disease that attacks and destroys lungtissue. What the pathogen is exactly has still not been proved, although electronmicroscope observations suggest either a new Paramyxo (measles, mumps,childhood croup) or Corona (common cold) virus. Yesterday, sixty new patientswere admitted to Hong Kong hospitals suffering fever, dry cough and difficultybreathing - all symptoms of SARS pneumonia.Hong Kong health authorities discovered that 213 residents of Amoy Garden inthe Kowloon District had been hospitalized as SARS victims. Amoy Gardenconsists of ten 35-story buildings housing around 15,000 people. Healthofficials also discovered that about half of the Amoy Garden SARS patientslived in \"Block E,\" a series of apartments built vertically one on top of the other.Whatever the SARS microbe is, a vertical spread of the disease impliestransmission can occur beyond close human contact. So, World HealthOrganization (W.H.O.) investigators are following up \"the possibility that bodilysecretions containing the causative virus might somehow enter common systemsthat link rooms or flats together.\"The Hong Kong Department of Health issued an unprecedented order today toquarantine all the residents in Block E. Everyone must remain in theirapartments until midnight on April 9. Violators can be fined as much as $2,800U. S. dollars, or jailed.As of March 31, 2003 United StatesSuspected SARS pneumonia cases in the United States have climbed to 62 in 23states.Alabama 1California 14Connecticut 1"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Georgia 1Hawaii 3Illinois 2Kansas 1Maine 2Massachusetts 2Michigan 2Missouri 2Mississippi 1Minnesota 3New Hampshire 1New Jersey 2New Mexico 1North Carolina 2New York 10Ohio 1Pennsylvania 3Rhode Island 1Te x a s 3Utah 4Virginia 3Washington 1Wisconsin 2Total Suspected U.
