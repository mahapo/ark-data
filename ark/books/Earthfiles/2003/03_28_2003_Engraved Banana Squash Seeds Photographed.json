Photograph © 2003 by Dave Rosenfeld. March 28, 2003 Salt Lake City, Utah - As I reported on March 15, 2003,about 500 \"engraved\" seeds were found inside an otherwise fresh, healthybanana squash by Salt Lake City restaurant owner, Kasim Barakzia, on March14, at his restaurant, Baba Afghan. Almost every seed had letters or symbolsengraved on both sides in what appeared to be different languages. The firstsymbol that Kasim recognized was the Arabic symbol for Allah.Kasim has cut open dozens of banana squash every week since he opened hisrestaurant nine years ago and has never seen anything like these seeds before.Normal squash seeds are smooth and glisten with a thin, transparent membrane.Normal banana squash seeds, smooth and covered bya thin, transparent membrane that glistens."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"This week I was able to coordinate a photography session with Kasim Barakziaand Ryan Layton of Layton, Utah, with his friend, Dave Rosenfeld, a Salt Lakeresident who likes to explore earth mysteries through his group, Utah UFOHunters. I talked with Kasim about how important it would be to photograph asmany of the carved seeds as possible, both front and back of each labeled groupof seeds, to see how many of the engraved symbols could be recognized and if arelationship could be determined between the symbols on either side of eachseed. Kasim also wondered if there was a specific message in all the seedscoming at this critical time of war between the United States and Iraq.The following are a few of the several dozen photographs taken of the front andback \"engraved\" in the banana squash seeds. The far left seed below is carvedwith the Arabic symbol for \"Allah,\" or God.Far left seed is carved with the Arabic symbol for \"Allah,\" or God. See close-up ofengraved \"Allah\"seed below next to a close-up of the Arabic symbol printed on an Iraqi flag. Please notethat the reason the title,\"Frame 54\" is upside down is that Dave tried to photograph all the seeds as quickly aspossible to avoid dryingwithout knowing the symbol orientation for each seed. In this case, the far left seed's\"Allah\" symbol wasdiscovered when the photo is turned upside down. All seed photographs © 2003 by DaveRosenfeld.

Dave was surprisedto see that the thin, transparent membrane surrounding each seed was still intact.The engraved symbols are beneath the membrane."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Interview:Dave Rosenfeld, Photographer and Utah UFO Hunters, Salt Lake City,Utah: \"I was skeptical when I went to photograph. When Kasim (Barakzia)pulled out the seeds, they were all in vacuum packs, 30 to 40 seeds per pack,and he did not want them to leave his sight, that's for sure. He was prettyprotective of them.When he pulled them out and I started inspecting them, just the symbols at first looking at the different shapes of the symbols. I noticed that the seed itself stillhad the skin or a membrane around it which makes the seed smooth to thetouch. So, in fact, you would have to take off this skin or membrane to actuallyfeel the markings or engravings that are in the seed. After seeing the seeds upclose and seeing the membrane was still on the seeds intact, I was quite floored!WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT WHATEVER THIS ENGRAVINGPROCESS WAS, IT WAS BENEATH A TRANSLUCENT OR TRANSPARENTSKIN SURROUNDING THE SEEDS?Correct. There was no way that a worm or any insect could do that because itwould have eaten through the skin or membrane.DID YOU SEE THIS TRANSPARENT COVERING ON EVERY ONE OF THESEEDS?Yes, and even on the dry seeds he had, the ones that were really dry andcracking apart that's where you could really see the membrane as it was flakingoff the seed.THAT MAKES THIS EVEN MORE REMARKABLE BECAUSE HOW WERETHESE SYMBOLS ENGRAVED THROUGH THE TRANSPARENTCOVERING OF THE SEEDS WITHOUT LEAVING A MARK IN THECOVERING?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Exactly. That's what got me. I was like, 'Whoa! This is really strange.' Thenwhen you look at the symbols, you are pretty amazed by those alone. But thenwhen you see the skin is covering, you are like, 'There is no way somebodycould do this. No way!'Talking with Kasim, he says that he has been cutting open squash for 9 years andhe says that sometimes he gets squash from different locations. This squash wasfrom Mexico and he said if someone was to fake this, hoax this, if there is someway to do this, they would have to do it when the squash was quite young inorder for it to heal over after placing the (carved) seeds back in there.HOW COULD ANYBODY OPEN UP A SQUASH, CARVE 500 SEEDS ANDPUT THEM BACK INTO THE SQUASH WITHOUT IT BEING QUITEOBVIOUS?Yes, that's what Kasim has been saying, too. He has never seen anything like it.And he personally cut open that squash, so he knew that it wasn't piecedtogether.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
