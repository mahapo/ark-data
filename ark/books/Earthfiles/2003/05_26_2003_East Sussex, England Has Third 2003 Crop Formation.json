May 26, 2003 Woodingdean, East Sussex - Andy Thomas, Editor ofSwirlednews.com, reports that the second formation to appear in East Sussexthis month lies directly alongside the 'thought bubble' pattern reported May 14,2003. The crop is oilseed rape after the early yellow blooms have given way togreen in a field on Newmarket Hill near Woodingdean.Ringed circle with tail of five smaller circles. The diameterof the ring is 106 feet. The center circle's diameter is 53 feet. The five tail circlesare 26.5 feet, 18 feet, 13 feet, 9 feet and 6.5 feet. Aerial photograph © 2003 by DavidRussell.Andy writes about the new S-shaped pattern, \"It is much larger than itspredecessor and is comprised of a central 102-foot-diameter circle with fourdiminishing circles on each side (thus nine in all, forming an S-shape), bothsides leading to long 200-foot paths which culminate in 25-foot-diametercircles. These paths are not unlike the design of last year's first Sompting (WestSussex) formation. This new glyph's size is highly impressive and it must rate asone of the largest Sussex formations we've yet had.\"The farmer confirmed the crop formation was not there on May 24, so it musthave been created on the night of May 24-25. Yet, Andy Thomas reports, \"Thenight of its arrival was one of torrential rain between at least 12:30 a.m. and 1:00a.m. - not nice conditions!\"Andy also reported about the May 14, 2003, ring and tail of circles, \"It is worthmentioning that on Tuesday afternoon (May 13), there was thunder, heavy rainand hail all afternoon and the field would have been very wet and muddy on thenight of its appearance. Despite this, the stems of rape were clean andunscuffed.\" Andy also points out that the Newmarket Hill field is near aNeolithic track and that an ancient burial mound lies in the field below the ring"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"pattern. \"Crop formations have appeared in this area for many years, with asingle circle having been reported in the same field as early as 1974.\"The two May 2003 formations in Woodingdean are not far from the first simplecircle of the British 2003 crop formation season discovered by the farmer on orabout April 12, 2003, at Cliffe Hill, Lewes, East Sussex.
