Dalton (pseudonym)Manor Books, Inc., New York, New York(out of business since 1988.) \"You're not listening, dammit!\" Dr. Brandon slammed his fist into his thighangrily. \"If we are transplants of descendants of transplants, then we have mindsthat can think, reason, logic. We have emotion and feelings. We're not animalsyou can sacrifice. We're part of different races from God only knows where inthe universe.\" The Meue stared coldly, \"It is our responsibility. Can you measure this emotionsyndrome scientifically?\" \"Well, not exactly, not in a way that would satisfy science, but it is as importantto our existence as pure logic is to yours.\" \"How can you believe the colony earth will stabilize because of this emotion,when you can't even measure the parameter? You are a very complex andsometimes paradoxical man, Dr. Brandon. Our sight sphere has followed youmany times and we have seen this emotion change your logical mind. It is veryhard for us to predict if you will follow your emotion or logic.\" \"What's a sight sphere?\" \"A sphere of particles we send out which allows us to view you while we remainhere. It takes a vast amount of power to keep us in your dimension, so wheneverpossible we use the sphere to locate our target, then guide the target to us.\" \"But I came here because I wanted to,\" Brandon said. The Meue countered, \"You are here because I willed you. I had to meet and talkwith you. I had to know why you became so involved in the test humans. I alsoknow about the chemicals you've been taking to block our memory dissipater,but there are other ways. In three of your weeks, you will remember everything,but it won't matter. We will be gone and of course no one would ever believeyou.\" \"No.\" Brandon shook his head, smiling. \"You're right there. I find it hard tobelieve myself.\" He suddenly shifted the conversation, feeling his interview wasdrawing to a close. \"Who are the men in black and what do they have to do withall this?\" \"The men in black were our first attempt at genetic transfer. Have you seenthem?\" the Meue asked. \"No, but I've heard descriptions of them.\" \"Aligning and altering the chromosomes so that the transplant can inhabit earthwithout being radically different in appearance is a very time-consuming and"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"critical piece of ultra-microsurgery. The biggest problem, however, was thetransformation from our anti-plane to yours. Much of the DNA became lostduring transfer from the chemical changes due to high frequency. Until a shortwhile ago, the men in black, as you call them, were the best transplants wecould produce. Instead of destroying them, we used them to warn people not totalk about what they'd seen.\" \"But why?\" Brandon asked, surprised. \"What threat could we possibly be toyou? You could wipe us out in the blink of an eye.\" \"But we are a laboratory for testing. We have no weapons. Under certainconditions, this vehicle is extremely vulnerable to your primitive weaponry.When the anti-plane is reversed to enable us to make contact with things in yourplane, we are susceptible to the same laws that govern everything in your plane.There are also times when, under certain atmospheric conditions and certainspeeds, the positive electrons collect on the outer shell and the ship begins toglow. Many humans have seen us traveling under these conditions. In order toshed these electrons, we must charge the ship with positive force. This makes usvisible until the electrons fall away. Sometimes this might take several minutes,during which time we can be seen visually on radar. So you see, we have verycritical times. We have passed into your dimension over three hundred times tocollect cattle specimens and have been seen many times. If everyone who saw ustalked about it, we could no longer pass through. It would be too dangerous andwe couldn't finish our work here.\" \"Why the cattle?\" Brandon was sitting on the edge of his chair. He had forgottenhis own fate. Time had to be running short and he had to know all the answers.\"Did you practice on them, trying to establish the transfer method for humantransport?\" \"Yes, that is part of it. But there is more.\" The Meue sat absolutely motionless,eyes blinking slowly, the veins pulsing strangely under the skin of his elongatedforehead. \"Being the designers of the experimental earth colony, we originallywere never to implant our own species here. After much study of the colonyearth, we realized we had to have our species within the colony to gain bettercontrol over the conditions of the experiment, to determine when it should beterminated. The transplants will have no idea who they are, but will relay theinformation through nightly dreams. Now ...\" \"But the government - why are they involved?\" \"A few people highly placed in the intelligence community know the wholestory and keep it a secret to avoid panic. Some of them have gone mad becauseof it. Humans have a curious dislike of the truth. Forrestal went out a window afew weeks after he was briefed. Certain other elected officials and candidateshave had to be eliminated because they threatened to make trouble. We prefer tomaintain a stable environment until we're ready to terminate the experiment.\" \"What do you mean, 'terminate the experiment'?\" Brandon interrupted, finding ithard to contain himself. \"For Chrissake, you're talking about people.\" \"I know what I am talking about, Dr. Brandon.\" The Meue showed no sign ofemotion. \"I will explain when it is in logical sequence.\" \"Brandon took a deep breath, to regain his composure. He was slowly beginningto hate the creature delivering the monotone, telepathic message of doom. \"As you are aware, we are physically quite different. Genetically, manyattributes had to be puffed and replaced. Some genes mutated and reinstatedinto the chromosome chain. We've had to conduct thousands of experiments juston the genetic level, then the dimension transfer took thousands more. Weneeded a place to work undisturbed without having to switch dimensionsconstantly; the desert gave us that. We needed a number of donors for a freshsupply of sperm and eggs from your dimension. A butchered cow in a lonely"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"pasture draws little attention ...\" \"And,\" Brandon interrupted, \"high enough on the evolutionary scale that at leastyou knew the method would be correct.\" \"Exactly!\" The Meue's head nodded slowly. \"And when the genetic method wascorrect, human donors were taken from desolate places where we could goundetected.\" \"I assume, then, that you've mutilated more humans than the ones I've seen.\"Brandon fought to contain his heightening anger. \"Many more. While the method was correct, we found great differences in germlayer development.\" \"What happened to those people?\" \"Many were attended to by people like yourself, which was not necessary. Thedonors were treated with a substance that would have healed the incisioncompletely without a scar in four days. Others could not withstand the traumaand had to be transferred to other planes or dimensions.\" \"You mean they died,\" Brandon grunted. \"I guess that's what you call it.\" \"How close are you to having this creature perfected?\" \"The Meueman is as close as time will permit. Our power source is running low.There is only one vehicle like this, and it cannot be left on your side of thedimension.\" \"Why not go back, recharge it, and come back again?\" Brandon asked. \"It's not that important to us. The earth colony project appears to be a failure.We have many other important things that must be done. The Meueman is closeenough to your form to carry out the objectives he was developed for. Look!\" Before Jerry Brandon had an opportunity to again argue the importance of thefate of earth, the Meue's hand pushed a button on a small console sitting on thetable between them. The wall to Brandon's left illuminated a dull milky-white,then quickly cleared like window glass. Brandon's mouth gaped in disbelief. \"My God, what ...\" His voice stuck in his throat. Beyond the window was a lineof cylinders, filled with an aqueous solution bubbling life into the beings within.Meue technicians took notes, adjusted valves and hooked up electricalconnectors to attachments on the tanks. \"Nine, Dr. Brandon. The cube of the perfect number. Nine Meuemen will beimplanted into various positions in your society. Endowed with greaterknowledge than anyone in their fields, they will of course be greatly respected.\" \"But they're all albinos!\" Brandon glanced quickly at the Meue, whose neckcraned awkwardly, scanning his prized life forms, watching as they floated in theliquid. The mouths opened and closed, expelling a stream of bubbles from theirnostrils. Their skin was creamy white and their white hair floated around theirsmooth faces like seaweed. \"Yes,\" the long wrinkled gray neck of the Meuetwisted back and his hideous face returned to confront Brandon. \"Albinos. Notethat they all have different appearances.\" \"Why albinos?\" Brandon kept glancing at the cylinders (with beings in them.) \"An anomaly. An anomaly we thought would be a disaster to the project, butdon't have time to correct. In our plane, they would be removed immediately,but in your society with this caring, emotion thing, their difference will mean"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"nothing. After thousands of tests, we decided to use almost all humanchromosomes with the exception of the nervous tissue. You shouldn't beappalled by what you see because with the exception of the nervous system andthe brain, you are looking at a basically human form. To develop a Meuemanbrain and nervous system that would fit inside the small, primitive brain case ofthe human, we had to carefully select specific amino acids and synapses, theexact chromosomes we needed. The Meueman has a totally Meue ectoderm,brain and nervous system, but we've been able to reduce the brain sizeenormously.\" \"If you used nonhuman ectoderm, how did you derive human facial featuresfrom the epithelium?\" Brandon asked, astounded by the capabilities of theMeue's advanced science. \"The face, especially the mouth and lack of teeth, kept appearing until we used ahuman counterpart and crossed the genes. The teeth aren't perfect, but the Kumaorgan is active and we'll be able to communicate with the Meueman through hisdreams, without his knowing it.\" \"Is that the appendage between the hemisphere of the frontal lobe?\" Brandonnervously asked. \"Yes. The Meueman's is only a rudimentary stalk, not a full appendage, a smallbump covered by his hair. It took much longer than we expected to resolve theproblem in the epithelium. We had only a short time to work on the epidermislevel in the ectoderm, and so the Meueman will have to remain an albino.\" \"But albinos - they'll stick out like a sore thumb,\" exclaimed Brandon, trying tosuppress the idea of destroying them. \"These transplants will be leaders in their mental field.\" The Meue calmlycontinued, showing no emotion. \"While they might act slightly differently thanmost humans, the advanced knowledge they will possess in fields like science,mathematics, government and the humanities will make them unreproachable.Take this man Einstein you spoke of; was he normal according to humanstandards?\" \"He was a little eccentric, but he was brilliant,\" Brandon replied. \"Exactly. His knowledge made him acceptable and the Meueman will beaccepted in the same way. So you see, Dr. Brandon, to think about killing a manwith the status of an Einstein is ridiculous. The Meueman will be looked up toas eminent contributors for the betterment of man.\" Brandon thought for a moment. The Meue was right; albinos or not, they wouldbe heroes at a time when the world needed a few. \"And these creatures won'thave any knowledge of you or any of this? They'll just suddenly appear in ourmidst?\" Brandon asked, looking for a flaw in the diabolical scheme. Continued in - The Cattle Mutilators, Chapter 18, Part Four.
