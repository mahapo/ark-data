This introduction had been arranged, on my suggestion,with her friend and my contact, Kurt Thiel, a researcher in Texas. In thismanner, she agreed that her disclosure about an ailing alien having beentreated by medical specialists would safeguard her identity and locationand, in turn, not compromise her relationship with a doctor in his field ofexpertise who treated the patient. According to Beth, she was a secretary for a geriatrics (human agingspecialist) who operated a clinic near Los Alamos, New Mexico. In 1985,she said her \"boss,\" a former Navy officer with a top security clearance,was sent to a New Orleans, Louisiana, Veterans Hospital to diagnose analien patient suffering from a paralyzed larynx. Beth recalled that thedisorder that resulted from an injury prevented \"verbal communication\"and was designated by a high authority as \"urgent.\" Beth's only involvement in this case was at her doctor's clinic where shetyped his diagnostic recommendations from a Dictaphone tape. Theaddressee: another medical facility in another state. When the report wasfinished, she recalls putting it into an open folder with an addressedenvelope for his review. She made no carbon copy, she said. However, hemight have privately copied it for his confidential file. Although she doesnot recall the report's contents or details, she said that there was noquestion that the patient was of extraterrestrial origin. Here again, we have an alien with at least one human characteristic - avoice box which leaves a long trail of questions. Of course, if it had teeth(Beth did not know), it probably also had a digestive and alimentarysystem. Also, was it a crash victim or a guest? An Anecdotal Classic There is something extraordinary about this Hall of Mirrors case whichfirst surfaced to me shortly after my return from the MUFON RichmondSymposium. The source who made fabulous revelations, including being awitness of a retrieved alien craft and entities in 1947, is an active ladyprofessor who teaches chemistry at a southern college and agreed to thepseudonym, Edith Simpson. Briefly, after getting all of her disclosures into some semblance of order, Ifind that some fit into the scheme of events occurring in 1947 as I knowthem, and others that suggest foul play and harassment that are eitherimaginative or contrived by outside manipulators. Potentially, the Simpson story is a breakthrough - mainly because it"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"involved her alleged association with a person who can be rated as one ofthe world's greatest scientists. Professor Simpson also claims that she hasvarious kinds of material evidence to back up her claims, includingphotographs of her and the scientist together and still others that show thealien craft and the entities. But after a long wait, the evidence never came.Despite excuses, there are pluses in her testimony about her experiencesand maybe there are some plausible explanations for these shortcomings. The story began for me with a phone call from a long-trusted researcher inFlorida, Sheila Franklin. She confided that she had learned some basicdetails from an associate who got Simpson's story from one of her students.The rest of it she got on tape when she, accompanied by two friends, wereprivileged to interview her in a restaurant near her college in another city.A copy of the confidential tape, dated July 10, was sent to me so that Icould join in on the investigation. Because of the impact of the retrieved evidence on the scientificcommunity and the craft's high-tech military potential, scientists and otherson a need-to-know-basis were invited by the authorities to see the craft andcrew members - some still alive - at a secret location somewhere in asouthwestern state. Listening to the tape, it contained basically general information in responseto Sheila's questions. Apart from Simpson's claim to have seen \"ninebodies,\" her most stunning disclosure was that she had 48 photos showingthe aliens and some were close-ups. But her story became vague when sheexplained that she had most of them in a briefcase in her car which hadbeen stolen. The photographs were missing. She also spoke of being undersurveillance and complained of many kinds of harassments, housebreak-ins, muggings, and many other strange happenings - all a apropos tohaving been in the proverbial Hall of Mirrors. Sheila Franklin's in-depthobservations in her role of the case appears at the close of myinvestigations. According to bits and pieces of information gleaned from 15 phone calls,starting September 4, with Professor Simpson, here is a chronicle of her9-day adventures. As a top science student in competition with many nominees, Sheila wonthe honor of being selected as a summertime trainee under the wing of oneof the world's greatest scientists. It was during this summertime course in1947 that she got a fortuitous invitation to join her mentor on a scientificmission at a secret location in southwestern USA. Boarding a commercial airliner with a stopover in Chicago, she was amongthe scientist's entourage landing at a small airport. When I probed for cluesas to the airport location, at first she thought it was at Edwards AFBbecause it was a well-known base in a desert area. However, when Iinformed her that the base in 1947 was not named Edwards, she thenadmitted that she was unsure of the name and just assumed that it wasEdwards. I then asked if she was familiar with the name Muroc, the base'sname in 1947. \"Maybe,\" she said. \"I've heard that name, but I'm not sure.\" In later talks, I again tried to locate her landing field or airport. \"I'm sure itwas not Los Angeles,\" she said, \"but I remember it was a small airport -maybe in New Mexico or even Phoenix. No one told me anything. Afterall, I was just a peon.\" Still hoping for clues, allowing for the passing years when memory fails, Ichecked with Tim Cooper - a research authority on military bases, nuclearinstallations and rocket test sites in the late 1940s. In response, he sent mea raft of material on Muroc, which he considered as a possible storagearea. But his guess for the rendezvous was either Albuquerque, LosAlamos or near White Sands Proving Grounds, all locations where"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"need-to-know dignitaries had allegedly convened to see the evidence. Thisincluded viewing the crash victims reportedly flown to Ft. Worth fromRoswell and on to a secret location. But, back to Muroc, he referred me tohis source, a former Air Force operations officer, reminding me that I hadquoted him answering questions in my book, Status Report VI as follows:\"Cooper: Did the Air Force recover flying discs? Answer: Yes. Some were found in 1946 and 1947. Some in theMojave Desert and some in New Mexico. Cooper: Where were these discs taken to? Answer: Some to Muroc and others to Langley. They wanted toknow what they were made of and how they worked. Cooper: What were these things that were taken to Muroc? Answer: They were 'lifting bodies.' They looked like invertedbathtubs.\" Wherever Simpson's group landed, they were greeted in rainy weather byan officer of high rank. She believed he was a colonel because she couldsee what looked like a silver eagle on his shirt collar, hardly visible underhis raincoat with an attached hood. In a military vehicle, she said, theydrove 50 to 75 miles across desert to a base with scattered buildings.Unlike the others in her group, who probably stayed at the base, she wasescorted to a small motel. During her stay at this location, Professor Simpson recalls visits to awell-guarded old hangar. Inside, she got her first glimpse of the aliens ondisplay for all to see. \"Some of the specialists,\" she said, \"were allowedcloser looks, including my boss. To me, they all looked alike - all five ofthem. They were about five feet all, without hair, with big heads andenormous dark eyes. And yes, their skin was grey with a slight greenishtinge, but for the most part, their bodies were not exposed since they weredressed in tight-fitting suits. But I heard they had no navels or genitalia.\" After a brief pause, Simpson went on. \"One of the aliens stood out abovethe rest. It had a bilious green fluid oozing from its nostrils. But it wasstrange. After exposure to the air, the ooze gradually became bluish andsuggested perhaps a copper or cobalt base. I'm guessing, but it might haveseeped from a gall bladder-like organ. In fact, I wondered if it was stillalive, but I wasn't close enough to see any body movement or hear anycomments from the medics.\" In the same hangar at its far end was the alien craft. \"It was disc-shaped,sort of concaved,\" she said, and then added in a piteous moan: \"I'm aterrible judge of size and distances, but I'd say its size took up aboutone-fourth of the hangar floor.\" Sounding a little disappointed, Professor Simpson said she could not seemuch of the craft's features as she was not allowed to get up close for agood look. Besides, there were too many technicians and military peoplestanding around it. But she did observe that one side of the craft wasseverely damaged. Notably, she was told, that some of the privilegedonlookers were pilots. But there, before Professor Simpson's eyes, was theproof of an alien mission and its failure. \"My reaction,\" she said, \"waswonderment, half curiosity and maybe half fear.\" After pinning down the time-frame of her trip with the eminent scientist tothe early part of July in 1947, I asked the key question: Was the saucer yousaw the one that crashed near Roswell? Her non-committal response: \"No"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"one said that it was from the Roswell crash, but I did hear that name popup during my trip. Now, remember, I told you that they didn't tell meanything of importance. No secrets and no details. My boss who had theright clearance made a report, which I didn't see. I was just told to keep mymouth shut.\" One day during her stay over at the base, something unexplained happenedthat caused a change in her schedule. She and her team were boarded intoa troop carrier \"with a canvas top\" and driven about 50 miles across desertterrain, escorted by jeeps to an isolated building with a number of vehiclesparked outside. In the distance, she could see many one-floor buildingsand a bustle of activity. Once ushered into the lone building with guards at the door, her group wasgreeted by an officer and directed to an area where medical and uniformedpeople were concentrated around a gurney on which was a patientstruggling in pain. At times, it was prone and then it sat up trying to freeitself, making strange groans. But it never spoke. Although she was kept ata distance, she said she could readily recognize that it, too, was a greyalien biped that looked more human than the other five she had seen. Atone instant, according to Professor Simpson, its whole torso incrediblyexpanded, looking grotesque, and gave the attendants a hard time keepingit restrained. \"It must have been a fresh case,\" she said. \"But I was toldnothing and before long, all of us were dismissed from the premises.\" Shelearned later that the injured alien survived. For the sake of posterity and edification, I asked Professor Simpson - basedon her observation- for the reaction and/or any comments by her esteemedscientist who had more access to privileged information. Withouthesitation, she said, \"He was not disturbed at all by seeing the actualevidence. I didn't record in my notes is initial comments, but he saidsomething to the effect that he was not surprised that they came to Earthand that it gave him hope that we could learn more about the universe.Contact, he said, should be a benefit for both of our worlds.\" Later, I tried again to get more about his reaction, hoping to learn whatmight have interested him the most. Her response: propulsion and moreabout the universe. \"On the sensitive subject of secrecy, Simpson commented: \"We werereminded daily of our pledges of course, but I signed no papers. However, Iwas surprised to see photographers who were free to take photos, evenmovies of everything in view. Thanks to a trusting member of our group, Imanaged to get a set of photos. I kept these hidden for years until I made amistake and showed one to a student and the word got out.\"\\ Photos of real aliens? Photos are not proof of anything. Most, in UFOlogy,are fakes. But the thought that having a number of shots showing bodies invarious positions and close-ups of a face, a hand or even atrophiedgenitals, as I told Simpson, would be a \"godsend.\" At least, it wouldsubstantiate her claims and would, undoubtedly, open the eyes of medicalspecialists. The original plan was for Simpson to show Sheila Franklin the photos andother pertinent evidence such as dated letters, postmarked envelopes,school momentos, or any other materials, to lend credence to her casewhich I would accept in trust. Nothing materialized. Finally, on October27, I called Simpson to explain that I had reached a deadline. I needed thepromised evidence if her story were to be published credibly in my newStatus Report. In the interim, I said a FAX or photocopy of the originalwould do. Then I advised that she should call Sheila to visit her to see itsoriginal. To my surprise, she said that she had already started searching heroffice files where she knew she had hidden a photo in a folder with othernotes about her secret trip. \"So far, no luck,\" she said, \"but I'm sure I'll find"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"it.\" Then came the shocker. \"I've already decided to send the photo to youwith my permission to publish it in your report.\" As she suggested, I called her the following day,. She had finished hersearch and added glumly, \"I found the right folder, but the photo and someof the notes were missing.\" Needless to say, I was disappointed. Did she, or did she not, at any time have photos? If so, were those kepthidden in her home taken during a house break-in which happened severaltimes. Was the photo in her office also rifled? And what of the otherphotos of a total of 48 she mentioned on tape? If her collection of photoswere as revealing as she claimed, then it can be assumed that she wouldhave been a victim of surveillance, search and seizure. According to Simpson's mathematics, the live alien on the gurney - plusthe five supposedly deceased in the hangar with the craft - total six. Whatof the other three of the nine she claimed were in custody on her tapeinterview? When I questioned the discrepancy, she was quick to point outthat the others were in reference to aliens she heard about taken fromcrashed UFOs in Russia. How does Simpson's adjusted figures relate to Roswell? Frankly, we canonly guess. According to her vague testimony about Roswell, we cannotconclude that any of the bodies were retrieved from that sector. To furthercomplicate the issue of a body count, there were three other crashes inNew Mexico during the same time-frame in 1947. Tim Cooper in hisresearch named three locations. Researchers, Don Schmitt and Kevin Randle - authors of UFO Crash atRoswell, in their in-depth investigations into Roswell - suggested initiallythat four bodies were retrieved. However, despite the early version,Simpson remained adamant about her observation of five bodies which shebelieved came from the crash site. For an update, I called Mark Rodeghier,Scientific Director of CUFOS, at his office on November 6, 1994, for hislatest assessment of the Roswell retrieval figure. He said that two newindependent sources that had surfaced in 1993 claimed they had witnessedfive bodies and that there were a few other claimants who had earlier usedthe same number. While it is beyond the scope of this paper to analyze theRoswell retrieval operation, this one correlative detail not only givescredence to the two new informants, but also to Simpson and theprobability that her \"five\" were from Roswell. Addendum I called Professor Simpson on November 11, making an urgent appeal forthe photos she claimed she had hidden somewhere in her home or anyother evidence that we had discussed in the past two months. Her responsebrought me to the edge of my seat: \"I sent two photos to you about fourdays ago,\" she said. \"I thought you were calling me to say you receivedthem. One was a good close-up. I packed them carefully with cardboardbetween each photo.\" Later that day, I had a gut feeling that something was amiss. I remember Ihad instructed her if she found the mislaid photos that she should firstmake a photocopy to send to me by mail. Then, I suggested she call Sheilaas had been rearranged to show her the originals and let her deliver themto me the safest way. As an alternative, I suggested that once I received thephotocopy or even a FAX, she could send the originals to me by registeredmail or Federal Express. The photos never arrived. Following is a profile of Professor Simpson by researcher Sheila Franklin"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"based on her keen observation of her behaviorisms and revelations during apersonal interview on July 10, 1993:\"The Professor and the Professor Edith Simpson is one of those special teachers that we remember.She knows how to stimulate an often-difficult subject matter andmake it palatable and digestible. That is why I heard about her.Simpson is a professor at a southern college in the department ofEarth Sciences. My friend Wanda's son is one of her students,probably one of her more favored students, since Wanda also has asocial relationship with Simpson. When Wanda heard about myinterest in UFO research, she suggested that I meet Edith Simpson.She said that Simpson, in an attempt to keep students' minds open tothe infinite possibilities in the cosmos, told an incredible account ofher personal experience with the unknown. Simpson said that in1947, she had seen with her own eyes the bodies of non-humanoccupants of a spacecraft and the remnants of the craft in which theyhad crashed. Of course, I asked Wanda to set up a meeting with Edithand to do that as soon as possible. It took over 3 months until wemet. We met at a restaurant that Professor Simpson favored. It was acrossthe street from her home. She had been going there for many yearsand knew everyone. Simpson brought along her long-time friend,Marge. My friends Susan, Wanda and I completed the dining group.Professor Simpson is a tall, sturdy woman, 64-years-old. She has acommanding, pedagogical presence. She is definitely not a wimp. Sheuses language very precisely. Accustomed to the paranoia ofUFOlogy and witnesses' fears of being seen or heard in public, I wasamazed at Simpson's lack of paranoia. I had my tape recorder andmicrophone out and asked if there was a more private space to holdour conversation, but she insisted that it was perfectly fine tointerview her right in the center of the dining room, while we werebeing served. She made no attempt to lower her voice or mince herwords. It was her ball game and ballpark. Waiters and other dinersmust have overheard our conversations. Apparently, Simpson did notseem to care and she had quite a bit to say. Edith Simpson was a very bright student, probably brilliant. Herinterest was in the sciences. In the summer of 1947, she was one ofthe university students chosen to study advanced physics with aworld famous scientist at an eastern university. It was a dram cometrue for her. The time spent with him that summer was more of anexperience than she had expected. The Professor, as she called him,was very warm and friendly to all he met. He especially took a likingto her. While she was with The Professor that summer, he was summoned bythe U. S. government to come to an emergency meeting, a gatheringof the elite in many areas of sciences and military, to a place in thesouthwestern or western United States. Edith Simpson, 18-year-oldstudent, was asked by The Professor to go with him to his specialmeeting. Since all of the students that were studying with him thatsummer needed a security clearance, she already had one and wasallowed to attend the meeting with him, as part of his entourage. Shehad no idea, at the beginning of the trip, what would ensue. The details of her experience of the meeting are examined in theforegoing section of Stringfield's monograph, but how ProfessorSimpson related the details to me, I believe, is more than interesting.She did not expect such an intense inquisition on my part. At first,her responses were somewhat limited, at times cryptic. Often, shewould return to a past vague statement and embellish the details as ifsome kind of veil was being lifted away. Sometimes she would say, 'I"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"haven't really thought about this in a long time,' or 'I don't understandwhy I don't remember this now. I should know this!' The more Iprodded her and returned to past questions, the more she seemed tohave definite responses. Her eyes reflected brightly with every newlyremembered data bite. I wondered whether she was reallyremembering or just giving me what I wanted to hear. Probably, theanswer to my own internal query came in further questioning. I asked Simpson if after she returned to academic life she ever hadany follow-up hone calls or contacts with any government agencies.At first, she replied that she didn't think that she had, although soonafter she returned, she had a feeling that someone was listening in onher phone calls. But it was just a vague feeling and nothing came ofit. Then, Simpson recalled an experience she said she had forgotten,but upon my questioning just remembered. She said that she wascalled out of her college class by the Dean. He introduced her to a woman that he called a 'psychologist.' He saidthat the 'psychologist' wanted to ask her some questions and that sheshould go with her. Edith followed her to a cleared out utility closet.There were just two chairs in it. They sat down and the 'psychologist'proceeded to ask her one question: 'As a child, did you walk or talkfirst?' The next thing Edith could remember was that she looked ather watch and it was an hour and a half later! She couldn't recallanything that had transpired in that hour and a half. Professor EdithSimpson said, 'It was just as if she had hypnotized me, although I hadnothing to hide. But I just didn't know what the probe went to.' I thought that off-handed statement about the 'psychologist' could beimportant. It might prove the beginning of a mind control scenario,one way or another. I asked whether she had ever had any buzzing orringing in her ears currently. or in the near past had any strangephone calls come at regular intervals? Simpson looked across thetable at her friend Marge and they shared a knowing glance. 'Oh, yes,I often have had phone calls where no one was responding.' At first,Simpson said that she thought that they were just 'wackoos' who wereinterested possibly in breaking into her home. But then shecontinued, 'I thought for several years that maybe the governmentwanted to know whether I was telling anybody about what happenedand they'd listen in and I sensed that. But that was just my ownperception and has no basis in fact whatsoever.' Professor Simpson has a penchant for ambivalence on the matter ofgovernment concern about what she knows. At first, she denies thatthere is any interest in her and then she indicates the polar oppositeof that position. On one hand, she feels she is nobody important andin the next statement she states an experience of feeling watched. Shestated another incident while she was working at her current collegewhere a 'couple of Federal men came by one day and asked a lot ofgeneral questions about me to different people. I wondered what theywere asking those kind of questions for?' Professor Simpson revealed that she has been having continualproblems with the IRS since 1975 that have not been resolved yet,even though she has affidavits from many witnesses regarding theexisting problems. Then there is the unending scenario of disputesshe has with her local municipal government-related to her homeproperty. She is currently in court over these. In the last few years,her home phone service has been regularly interrupted. For the lastthree months, there has been a constant busy signal on her line. Shehas not been able to use her phone. The phone company says it is aproblem within the home lines and Simpson maintains that it is theBell System. No matter, she is incommunicado by phone and is onlyreachable at her school's office."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Most bizarre is Professor Simpson's being the one woman victim of amajor crime wave. In the last seven years, she states that she has beensubjected to six home invasion burglaries, fifteen muggins (we wereshown scars to corroborate this fact), and numerous car thefts andbreak-ins. Professor Simpson's friend, Marge, shook her head inagreement to all of this terror. I asked Marge, who is older and morefragile-looking than Simpson, if she has encountered the sameproblems. She replied that she just had one mugging only! Showingmy incredulous reaction at the large number of criminal events inEdith Simpson's last few years, I said, 'Don't you think that is anoutrageous amount of crime directed at you?' Professor Simpsonshrugged off her response with, 'This neighborhood isn't what it usedto be.' My friends and I looked at each other and knew that theremust be more to this than just a neighborhood in transition. There certainly was. Perhaps the reason for all of this crime was thefact that Professor Simpson said she had in her possession forty-eight35mm photos of what she saw with The Professor in 1947. She saidthat the 'scientific group' that was there had access to them. Thespaceship and the dead aliens, in both full figures and parts of bodies,appear in them. I asked her if I could see the photos and ProfessorSimpson replied that most of them are no longer in her possession.She said that her car was stolen from a large shopping mall and thatthe briefcase in which she carried most of the photos was in thestolen car. Simpson said that the car and the photos have been foundand retrieved, but that the police refuse to release them. She says thatthe police told her that they had the photos even though she did notlist the contents of her briefcase on the police report. She was afraidto say what the photos were, due to her position at the college and inthe community. Although when the police told her that her car hadbeen found, they also mentioned they found the photos and madesarcastic remarks about the subject matter. She said that she wasafraid to make an issue about the photos since she was having somany problems with the local municipal government, but would takeup the issue of their return once her problems have been resolved. The level of high strangeness in the every day life of Professor EdithSimpson seems to be more than the average person can tolerate orendure. There was a period of missing time in Simpson's life thatoccurred about 5 years ago. One Friday night, she went to sleep andwas awakened the following Monday morning by her friend Margeand Marge's husband, Allan. The couple had tried to phone Simpsonthe entire weekend, but with no response. They feared that she wasdead, since her car was in the driveway and she was expected to be athome. Allan had to break a window and enter her home. They foundher asleep in her bed. Professor Simpson said that she could notremember anything about that weekend, including getting up to go tothe bathroom. She said it was a total blank in her mind. Shesupposed that she might have had the 'flu or something.' In my attempt to corroborate Professor Simpson's statements, I had anumber of dead ends. She was vague on specific dates and having avery common first and last name, the computer lists of incidents ofcrime are difficult to penetrate. I know for sure that she is, indeed, aprofessor of long time standing at the college. She is also well-knownand has resided in the same community for 50 years. She showed noanxiety about discussing the issues of 1947 and The Professor sheadored. If she did experience the viewing of the aliens and the craftwith The Professor, it is very possible that she might be under mindcontrol and surveillance by governmental agencies and has beensince the viewing first occurred. This would explain the session withthe 'psychologist,' the 'lost weekend,' and the vagueness about datesthat things occurred. It also might relate to the municipal, IRS and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"telephone problems. But if she truly was under mind control andpressure, why would she even mention her experience - let alone saythat she has photographic evidence to substantiate this? If Professor Edith Simpson is not telling the truth, what would be hermotivation? She has a lot more to lose than to gain. She is anesteemed member of the community and has a job where being aweirdo is not well-tolerated. She carries herself with dignity and isvery articulate. If she is nothing but a nut, she could easily fool a lotof people into believing that she is telling the truth. But then there isalso the chance that the 'powers that be[' want us to THINK that sheisn't playing with a full deck and WANT us to feel that she lackscredulity! Simpson knows some details about a 1947 crash case thathas not been published, although, there are still many missing piecesin that puzzle that she created for us.\" Len Stringfield: There was one last effort to procure the photo. After Ihad expressed my dismay that I had not received the two photos sheclaimed she sent by First Class mail, I told her on November 18, that Iwould ask Sheila to call her to make an appointment to visit her college orher home to obtain the duplicate copy. Sheila called and ProfessorSimpson, busy, agreed to call back Monday, November 22. She did notcall. On November 23, Sheila called again offering to visit her at herearliest convenience, but her response was a story of woe. Following is Sheila's brief account that describes our failure to producewhat could have been a pictorial breakthrough. But, the Simpson scenariomight have had other arcane ties. Sheila explains in this, her final reportdated December 9, 1994, a sudden shift from Simpson to her own sinisterhappenings which follows.
