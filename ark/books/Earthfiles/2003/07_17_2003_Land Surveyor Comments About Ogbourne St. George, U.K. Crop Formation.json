July 17, 2003 Howell, New Jersey After the Ogbourne St. George formationwas discovered in Wiltshire, England, on Sunday, June 15, photographer andresearcher Lucy Pringle wondered if it could be an 8-fold geometry instead of6-fold? The reason is the \"butterfly wing\" distribution of the six arms, ratherthan an equally spaced distribution of the arms or spokes around the centralcircle. I was curious and asked professional land surveyor, Vincent Creevy, ofHowell, New Jersey, to look at Lucy's aerial photographs.Interview:Vincent Creevy, Professional Land Surveyor, Howell, New Jersey: \"It's myopinion that the formation is complete, that the intent of this was to make aseries of spokes radiating out from the central circle and that they were to bebased on the number three. There are three circles going out from the centralcircle there and each one of those \"arms\" is made up of three different circles.There is the small circle and then two intersecting circles that create a crescentand then they radiate getting progressively larger. You might want to take a lookat that and see if there is a ratio of three in how they are getting larger. Youmight find there is something in there as well.Also when you add up all the different radii, they equal 54, which is alsodivisible by 3. The central circle is in addition to the 54, but I think that's theintersection point to lay these out on.IS THREE A PRIME NUMBER?Ye s .THAT MEANS?It's divisible only by itself, or one."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Close-up center of Ogbourne St. George crop formation.Aerial photograph © 2003 by Lucy Pringle.IF YOU WERE GOING TO TRY TO LAY THIS OUT AS A SURVEYPROJECT, IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS THAT WOULD BEESPECIALLY DIFFICULT TO DO?Probably not. It looks like everything is laid out at a right angle from the centralpoint. You have four spokes that are out at 90 degrees. The other two come outbisecting that angle at 45 degrees. So, all of these things are laid out in a straightline. You would need 54 stakes or points of radii origin to lay these out and thenonce you've done that, it would probably take an hour or two in the office tocalculate and then probably two to three hours to lay it out in the field. Andthen I don't know how you would go about laying down the crop or how longthat would take, because I've never tried anything like that.ISN'T IT INTERESTING THAT THE BELGIUM FORMATION THIS YEAR ISSO SIMILAR TO THE JULY 25, 2001, GOG MAGOG HILLS 'ANGEL?' ANDTHE BELGIUM ONE HAS 54 RAYS INSTEAD OF 75 RAYS (IN 2001) ANDTHE CIRCLE SURROUNDED BY A CRESCENT IS A REPEATED PATTERNIN THE OGBOURNE ST. GEORGE FORMATION?Beautiful new crop formation discovered June 24, 2003,in Mielen-Boven-Aalst (Gingelom), Belgium. \"Disturbing humming sound\"was reported by people living near the field and at least two cell phones would not workinside the Belgium formation, even though they worked fine outside the formation. Patternis very similar to the Gog Magog Hills \"angel\" formation below, reported July 25, 2001,southeast of Cambridge,Cambridgeshire, England. The number of radiating lines aredifferent.The original Gog Magog Hills formation had 75 thin rays. The June 24, 2003 pattern has 54thin rays."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Gog Magog Hills wheat formation discovered July 25, 2001,southeast of Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England. Aerial photograph© 2001 by Steve Alexander, www.temporarytemples.That is interesting and the circles themselves do seem to be set up essentially onthe same kind of circle/crescent pattern in all of them. (the Ogbourne St. Georgeand Belgium and July 25, 2001 Gog Magog Hills.)The other thing that stands out is that if someone actually surveys this formationand measures it, you're probably going to find other ratios of three, either in areaof circles circumscribed there, or perhaps in the ratio of the radii among thecircles.SO IF WE WERE MEASURING THIS, WE MIGHT FIND THAT THECENTRAL CIRCLE AREA MIGHT BE ONE-THIRD OF THE AREA THAT ITTOOK TO MAKE A LARGE OUTER CRESCENT?Yes, it looks like it could be something like that. I know someone mentionedthat the formation was approximately 600 feet across, which once again wouldbe divisible by 3, which is interesting.IN THE SPIRITUAL WORLD, THREE HAS A VERY SACREDCONNECTION TO THE TRINITY AND IN CROP FORMATIONS OVER THELAST TWELVE TO FIFTEEN YEARS, THERE CERTAINLY SEEMS TO BEAN UNDERLYING MATHEMATICAL LANGUAGE THAT IS OFTENREPEATING THINGS THAT SEEM TO HAVE A SPIRITUAL SUBTEXT. ITIS ESPECIALLY INTERESTING THAT THIS FORMATION - IN WHICHEVERYTHING THAT FIRST HITS YOU AS A 6-FOLD GEOMETRY, OR8-FOLD WITH TWO ARMS MISSING, IS ACTUALLY BASED ON THENUMBER THREE.I never thought of that, but I guess you could bring the trinity into this,especially in light of the fact that these circles do look very similar to the 2001\"angel\" circles.FROM GOG MAGOG.Correct. The thing that amazes me (in that Magog formation) is not the circlesand circumscribing of the crescents and such. But, the straight lines out wouldbe incredibly difficult to do and they don't radiate out from a central radiuspoint. If you look at the original (Gog Magog Hills) Angel one if you look at thesmall circle that is the head and you drew a straight line bisecting the wholething down the center, going through the whole crescent and the head sort ofnear the second tramline there. That's where the radius point of all those linesare. So they radiate out from the bottom of the head.Putting those lines out would be very difficult. You would have to set up a pointat that (bottom of head) location and then turn angles and it looks like they areall equal angles out divide 360 degrees by how many lines?THAT ONE WAS 75 LINES.So you divide 360 by 75 and then you turn those angles and then you wouldhave to put a point out beyond the circle and then you would have to flatten outwhat looks to be maybe a foot wide or less line. How wide were those lines?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"IN 2001, I BELIEVE THEY WERE ONLY 6 TO 8 INCHES IN DIAMETER VERY, VERY THIN.Yes, so how do you do that?\"Spanning a little more than eight tramline sections, the diameterof the formation is estimated to be nearly 600 feet.Aerial photograph © 2003 by Lucy Pringle.We b s i t e s :http://home.clara.net/lucy pringlehttp://www.cropcircleconnector.comhttp://www.swirlednews.comhttp://www.cropcircleresearch.comhttp://www.temporarytemples.co.ukhttp://www.dcca.nlhttp://www.invisiblecircle.de and http://www.invisiblecircle.org/ser/d-archiv-2003.htmlhttp://www.kornkreise.chhttp://www.heramagazine.nethttp://www.cropcirclenews.comhttp://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
