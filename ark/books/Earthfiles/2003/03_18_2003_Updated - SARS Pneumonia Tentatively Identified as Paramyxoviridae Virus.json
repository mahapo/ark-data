Very unusual.\"...The good news is that patients can be managedsuccessfully even if we don't know what the treatment isto cure the infection. Patients can be managed and theirlife sustained and they can, we believe, eventuallyrecover.\"- David Heymann, M. D., Ex. Dir., CommunicableDiseases, W.H.O., GenevaTravelers from Hsiamen, China, are met by Taiwanese health officialhanding out leaflets warning about SARS symptoms.Photograph © 2003 by Associated Press.Update: ProMED, the International Society for Infectious Diseases, reportsthat the SARS microbe is tentatively identified as a virus in theParamyxoviridae family. There are hundreds of such Paramyxoviridae viruseswith varying degrees of danger to humans, including diseases such as measles,mumps, and croup in children. Professor John Tam of the Department ofMicrobiology, Chinese University, said the virus was detected by electronmicroscopy. There is no drug cure for this virus group and the SARS microbecould be a new variant.Asked if the SARS virus was curable, Tam said they still needed to monitorindividual patients for more knowledge about the virus, but agreed that currentanti-viral treatment applied to patients has been the right choice, combined withrespirators to help breathing where needed. Updated March 19, 2003 Geneva, Switzerland - This morning I talked withDavid Heymann, M. D., Executive Director of the Communicable DiseasesProgram at his World Health Organization office in Geneva, about themysterious SARS pneumonia that has infected at least 500 people worldwide(this number includes the 307 February cases in Guangdong Province, China)and killed fourteen as of March 19, 2003. The good news is that W.H.O. nowthinks this microbe is not airborne and patients can be hospitalized for treatmentin contained ways that will prevent disease spread."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"SARS is an acronym for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, an atypicalpneumonia that rapidly attacks lung tissue and first showed up in February 2003when 305 people became ill in Guangdong Province, China. In addition sincethen, at least 170 other people in Hong Kong, Vietnam, Singapore and Canadahave been infected. Medical experts still do not know if the microbe is a newvirus strain or bacteria and antibiotics are not killing whatever it is. Ten percentof the Hong Kong patients are still on respirators to help them breath.Other suspicious cases are now being investigated in England, Germany, France,Israel, Slovenia, Australia and the United States, the Philippines, Thailand, andGermany.Some airlines in China, Vietnam, Australia, Japan and New Zealand are notchecking in passengers who show any signs of the SARS illness.SARS Symptoms:Fever greater than 38 degrees Centigrade (100.4 Fahrenheit) thataccompaniesDry cough (no mucus)Difficulty breathing, shortness of breathHave recently traveled to infected areasHave had close contact with another SARS patient or health workerWhat to Do:Anyone with the combination of symptoms and associations above shouldimmediately go to a hospital or emergency room for evaluation andpossible isolation to contain the disease and be treated.Interview:David Heymann, M. D., Executive Director, Communicable Diseases,World Health Organization (W.H.O.), Geneva, Switzerland:WHAT DO YOU ESTIMATE RIGHT NOW THE MORTALITY RATE IS ANDDO YOU SEE IT INCREASING?We don't have a good idea of the mortality. What we know is there have been 9deaths our of 500 cases. We do know that people get very seriously ill and wealso know that if hospitals have the appropriate equipment, which they nowhave in Vietnam and have had in Hong Kong, lives can be saved if patients areput on ventilators.But this is very unusual for an epidemic of this type of atypical pneumonia torequire respirators in many incidents. Very unusual. Is SARS A Pandemic Like the 1918 Swine Flu?IN THE UNITED STATES LAST NIGHT ON TELEVISION, THERE WERENEWS BULLETINS SAYING THAT WHO WAS CONCERNED THAT THISCOULD BE THE BEGINNING OF A WORLDWIDE PANDEMIC LIKE THE1918 SWINE FLU THAT KILLED 20 MILLION PEOPLE WORLDWIDE.W.H.O. is always worried when there is an organism which can't be identifiedbecause we can't then predict what will happen. But based on the studies thathave gone on so far among the people involved in the outbreaks, it does not inany way look like this will be a major pandemic such as influenza. Thisorganism, this infectious agent, is transmitted much less efficiently thaninfluenza, so casual contact walking through a room where there might beairborne infection is not what is occurring with this disease."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"DO YOU PLACE THE 305 CASES IN GUANDONG PROVINCE IN CHINAIN THE SARS CATEGORY NOW?These cases are occurring in the same geographical area and at the same timeperiod, so they are linked. What they are not linked yet by is a commoncausative agent because we don't know that agent. But certainly now that we areworking closely with the Chinese, we believe that the information they have onthe outbreaks that have been occurring in Guandong will be of great use to us indetermining what further recommendations for patient management.IF GUANDONG IS INCLUDED, THAT BRINGS THE NUMBER OF PEOPLEINFECTED UP TO 500 AND COUNTING.That's correct. It's approximately 500 cases we believe are occurring with thesame symptoms. Will SARS Spread in Airplane Ventilation System?IF YOU ARE A PASSENGER IN AN AIRPLANE AND THERE ISSOMEBODY ON THAT AIRPLANE THAT HAS SARS, WILL IT SPREADTHROUGH THE AIR SYSTEM WITHIN THE AIRPLANE?We have no evidence to believe that based on the fact that there have been threedifferent patients who have been evacuated on airliners two on commercialairliners and one on a non-commercial airliner. None of those airplanes seem tohave produced epidemics, which is good news. SARS Is Treatable and ContainableWOULD YOU RECOMMEND TODAY ANYONE, ANYWHERE IN THEWORLD UNITED STATES, CANADA AND OTHER IF YOU HAVE A HIGHFEVER SUDDENLY THAT IS ACCOMPANIED BY HEADACHE ANDGOING INTO SOMETHING LIKE A DRY COUGH, THEY SHOULD GO TOA HOSPITAL OR AN EMERGENCY ROOM?They should do that if they have one other criteria that is met and that is havebeen exposed to either Vietnam or Hong Kong, or have been exposed to any ofthe sites where the currently known outbreaks are occurring in Canada.HOSPITAL WORKERS THAT HAVE BEEN THE LARGEST POPULATIONTO GET THE SARS SYNDROME. HAS THAT BEEN BECAUSE OF DIRECTCONTACT WITH SALIVA, BLOOD OR OTHER FLUIDS FROM PATIENTS?That's correct. From what we understand in the studies we have been doing inthe past three or four weeks, it appears that this can only be transmitted bycontact with droplets coming directly from a patient, or possibly from bodyfluids other than droplets.HOW DO WORKERS IN HOSPITALS PROTECT THEMSELVES WORKINGWITH PATIENTS WHEN NOBODY KNOWS WHETHER THEY HAVE SARSOR NOT?It's a very difficult job to be sure. Certainly, when a patient comes to besuspected, there must be all kinds of precautions including doctors that arewearing protective masks and goggles so that if the patient sneezes or coughs,they don't become infected themselves.HEALTH WORKERS AND SOME PEOPLE ON THE STREETS HAVE BEENPHOTOGRAPHED WEARING MASKS. WOULD MASKS HELP PREVENTTHE SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE?This is not warranted as far as we know for this particular infection. But it's"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"common place in many Asian countries to wear a mask if one has a respiratoryinfection, even for the common cold, in an attempt not to spread it to others. Sopossibly, some of the masks that are seen in those areas are just normally beingworn. Could SARS Be A Biological Weapon?AS WE ARE ABOUT TO GO TO WAR FROM THE UNITED STATES TOIRAQ, MANY PEOPLE HAVE ASKED: COULD THIS SARS OUTBREAKCOMING AT EXACTLY THIS PERIOD OF FEBRUARY TO MARCH 2003,BE ONE OF SADDAM HUSSEIN'S OR AL QUAEDA'S EXPERIMENTSWITH BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS?We have no evidence that this is a deliberately caused epidemic. Once we findthe organism, we'll be better able to determine where this outbreak might havecome from. In other words, how it became established. But at present, there isno evidence that this is a deliberately caused outbreak or bioterrorism.IS IT STRANGE TO YOU THAT AFTER A MONTH OF THIS DISEASEBREAKING OUT IN VARIOUS PLACES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA ANDCANADA, THAT IT IS SO DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY WHAT IS CAUSINGTHE DISEASE?This is often the case in new diseases. If you remember back to Legionnaire'sDisease in 1976 when it first occurred. It took weeks, if not months, to identifywhat was causing that outbreak. If it's an organism that is not recognized, it is avery difficult task to find that organism.However, studies are going on right now under the electron microscope andhopefully they will yield at least some preliminary information about whether itmight be viral or bacterial. Animal-To-Human Virus?THERE WAS A MAN AND A SON IN HONG KONG WHO DIED INFEBRUARY FROM AVIAN INFLUENZA, A BIRD-TO-HUMANTRANSMITTED DISEASE.That's correct. But the SARS outbreaks in Vietnam and Hong Kong are, as far aswe know, in no way related to those bird flu cases that also occurred in HongKong in February.COULD SARS BE AN ANIMAL-TO-HUMAN NEW VIRUS?Many times infections such as this which are extremely virulent in humans areinfections that come from an animal host into humans. In other words, they arean infection that is common in animal populations and for some reason, hasbeen able to jump the species barrier between animals and humans and infecthumans. When that happens, there are several options that the organism has. Itcan establish a residence in humans and become a disease that's common inhumans and remains in human populations and transmits through generations.Or it can transmit to a very few people and then it dies out because the human isnot a good host for this infection.So, what we are looking for in the studies that are going on now is to determinewhether or not this is an agent that will transmit for many successivegenerations. Or if it is one that will die out in time.WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO CONFIRM WHETHER IT IS A VIRUS ORBACTERIA OR IF IT IS A VIRUS COMING FROM ANIMALS TO HUMANS?There have been several problems. One has been getting the specimensdistributed to the laboratories which can do this. Hong Kong laboratories, for"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"example, have been doing an extremely excellent job in looking for an infectiousagent. Now, there are other labs working with them to look for an infectiousagent and this requires time because sometimes it requires culturing a specimenon both bacterial culture media and cells, human cells in test tubes, looking tosee if there is a virus or bacteria present. That takes up to 24 to 48 hours, orlonger, to determine that.At the same time, if you are looking in blood for evidence of infection,antibodies take 3 to 5 days to develop. So, you can't detect it until later in theinfection. Then, you must make sure that this antibody was not there beforehandand that it is actually being produced by the (new) infection.BUT WE'VE HAD A MONTH OF THESE CASES COMING FROMFEBRUARY AND WE'RE AT MARCH 18. WHY WOULD THIS STILL BE AMYSTERY?It's a very difficult infection to identify. But once it is identified, we'll knowwhere to go from there and the labs will be able to develop the diagnostic teststhat we need.\"We b s it e s :http://www.who.int/en/ (World Health Organization)http://www.cdc.gov/ (Centers for Disease Control)Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
