Burisch, Ph. D., Microbiologist,working in Las Vegas, Nevada in the 1990s. Photograph by BJ. September 15, 2003 Las Vegas, Nevada - The past year since September 2002, computeranalyst and UFO phenomenon investigator, Bill Hamilton, has talked to me about thefrustrations of microbiologist Dan Burisch. Bill was given permission by Burisch to makeon-the-record video and audio recordings about Burisch's inability to lead a free life and hisdesire to no longer work for the U. S. government on microbiology matters of the higheststrangeness. Currently, neither Dan Burisch's parents nor Bill or friends have anycommunication with the scientist who is supposed to be living and still working for thegovernment under a house arrest arrangement organized with Burisch's wife, Deborah. Thecouple married in 1990 when he was Danny Benjamin Crain. Because Deborah Burischalready had a child who had her last name and bore another child in their marriage, Danrequested a legal name change to Burisch which was granted in 1995. Why would his wife cooperate in a house arrest arrangement? Allegedly Deborah Burischworks for the same black operations group funded by the U. S. government to studybiological tissues and survival questions concerning humans and the entities referred to as\"J-Rods,\" which Bill Hamilton also heard about from retired mechanical engineer, BillUhouse.

At least one level is said to be used for maintaining one ormore extraterrestrial biological entities (Ebens) in special environmental spheres designed to providea different, non-earth atmosphere for Ebens kept as a \"guest\" or in a \"captive\" status.Uhouse, now 78-years-old and knowing his non-disclosure agreement with the U. S.government expires in 2003, began speaking publicly about his experiences. Back then onJune 14, 1999, I presented in Earthfiles.com with his permission, \"The Strange Story ofJ-Rod, An EBE\" © 1999 by Bill Hamilton.Since then, Bill has also had in-depth communications with microbiologist Dr. Dan Burisch(Ph.D., State University of New York, Stoneybrook), who alleges he has had assignments tostudy the biological fluids and tissues of an EBEN called J-Rod inside S-4/Area 51 up to1995. Then he was assigned to a new project called Star Flower in which he researchesmaterials allegedly related to panspermia, the seeding of life on earth from extraterrestrialor time traveler sources. Project STAAR Flower is ongoing to date, according to Burisch.Bill Hamilton gave me permission to transcribe the audio from his on-the-record interviewthat occurred in a Las Vegas library room last September 19, 2002, with colleague, B.J.Wolf. At the time, Dr. Burisch said he was protesting new work assignments, wanted out ofhis government work, had deep concerns about the future of this planet and wanted thepublic to know what he knows.The following transcript is provided with Bill Hamilton's permission, his introduction to theinterview, and with the implied permission of Dr. Dan Burisch who wanted to speak outpublicly before something happened to him.Introduction to September 19, 2002 InterviewBy William F. Hamilton\"There have been many whistleblowers over the last fifteen years who have comeforth claiming to be involved with a highly secret American UFO program involving"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the reverse engineering of extraterrestrial technology and contact withextraterrestrial life forms. When Robert Lazar first divulged his involvement in sucha program on Las Vegas television Channel 8 in 1989, his revelations seemedgrounded in science fact. The allure of his story put an obscure top secret facilitycalled S-4 on the map. Bus loads of visitors flocked to a little-known dirt roadmarked by a cattle rancher's mailbox on the edge of Nevada Highway 375 to see thetest flights of a flying saucer emerging from behind the hills in the Tikaboo Valley. Though later discredited when investigators could not confirm Lazar's degree inphysics, Las Vegas journalist, George Knapp, seemed to find some merit in his storyand found some evidence that Lazar had worked at Los Alamos National Labs as heclaimed. In 1999 I decided to focus on a common element to see if I could validate someaspect of the tales about Area 51 and S-4. That was when I ran across a draftdocument known as \"Q94-109A,\" a biological briefing document signed by one Dr.Danny B. Crain, microbiologist. The technical language in the document seemed toindicate that Dr. Crain had extracted over 200 tissue samples from a live EBE(Extraterrestrial Biological Entity), an assertion, if true, that would reveal an amazingdepth to the secret U. S. government program. The EBE was known as J-Rod, adesignation used previously by another whistleblower, mechanical engineer BillUhouse. Through a contact in Las Vegas, a meeting was arranged so that I could interview Dr.Dan Crain who had legally changed his last name to Burisch for purely personalfamily reasons. On our third meeting, after I had been informed that Dan had beentaken to another underground facility in New Mexico, I had the opportunity tointerview him on camera using my Sony 8 mm videocam. What follows is a transcriptof that interesting interview prepared by Linda Moulton Howe from an audiotapedub. Dr. Burisch's parents both support his claim of having worked at the NevadaTest Site which makes this case unique in that respect.I have only been able to confirm a few facts about Dan himself through documents Ihave in my possession, but it is unlikely that Dan's story will ever be authenticatedcompletely. Many will relegate it to the same bin they have for Bob Lazar. Whateverthe outcome, the mystery surrounding Dan Burisch continues and the desperatemeasures taken by mysterious agents to keep him from living and speaking freelyalso continues.\"On right, Dan B.

Hamilton.Dan B. Burisch, Ph.D., Microbiologist IV, formerly Nevada Test Site/Area 50 Sector2/ Area 51 Sectors 3 and 4, Las Vegas, Nevada:BH: \"YOU WERE TAKEN TO - THIS WAS UNUSUAL, RIGHT? TAKEN TOTHE DULCE (NEW MEXICO) FACILITY? This was the first time I was ever taken to the facility at LANL, yes.GO AHEAD AND JUST DESCRIBE.Well, I was just initially, I was not told I was being taken up to - firstto Watertown and then over to the Sector 4 Facility [???????? (words unclear)facility].I was asked to research slides at the Sector 4 Facility [???second fourth??? facility]See footnote: **(1)which showed papilloma virus. These slides were set up under transmission electronmicroscope.They were in mounts. They asked me what my knowledge was of papilloma virus. I told them it waslimited. They told me they needed to take me to another location. So, weboarded an aircraft, a very small Lear jet. We flew to a small airstrip. Ithink we had to go east. After landing, I boarded a chopper. It was a BlackHawk chopper, to the best of my knowledge. I'm not an expert in militaryaviation. The Black Hawk was blacked out. We flew out from the airstrip into what Iwas told would be part of LANL. From there, I was loaded into a light (orwhite?) van, taken up the road which was very bumpy. Then finally about 15to 20 minutes, maybe 15 minutes - that includes the loading time and allthat - (I was) allowed to raise the blinds on the van. I saw a couple of theroad signs. One was a square sign with black lettering on a white backgroundthat said \"R-4.\" I was then told that we would be taken into (something about cell phones?),taken into a facility which is code named \"Sweetness.\" They asked me if Ihad ever heard of the Dulce facility or the alleged \"Section B?? or SectionD?\" that you mentioned the other day. I believe that is what you arereferring to. YES. I told them I had heard of it only briefly, that it allegedly existed andthat a lot of genetic tinkering went on in the biological field of thatfacility. We rounded to the left in the van, taken to a large door. The dooropened and we were met by two gentlemen, one of which was wearing a U. S.Marine Corps (laughter about????), a Marine Corps uniform. Another waswearing a Polo shirt which was a grey Polo shirt with a black collar. Therewas a red cap with a very prominent red patch. It was a black triangle andsomething written in the triangle. You'd asked about the orientation of the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"triangle. One of the main points is that it was an equilateral triangle. Oneof the main points was down, so it had a flat top. Again, as God as mywitness, I'm trying to remember what was inside. It bothers me when I can'tremember a pattern. But we went inside. They greeted us. We went around to the left. There was aguard that provided us an orange badge. We then went in a series of roll-updoors which exited to a small foyer over to the right where there was anelevator. The elevator took us to the first level down. While we were goingthrough the foyer, I noticed there was an \"FM-1\" sprayed on the door. TheFM-1, I don't know what that meant. I was never told. If it's anything likethe Sector 4, Level 1 at Papoose Lake, then I would make the assumption thatthe \"1\" stood for \"Level 1.\" The FM, I don't know. See footnote: **(2) After traveling down to another floor, we exited - this turned intobasically a ???? business - we exited the elevator and we changed our(orange) badges to a blue badge. We re-signed in. We were fingerprinted atthat point, brought into a small room and were told that they had somebusiness that they needed to attend to with us regarding the papillomavirus. They asked if we had been briefed over the papilloma virus. At thatpoint, myself and two other gentlemen, looked at each other and said (Hekinds of shrugs like not much.) We were asked a few hours ago. Theybasically looked disturbed. They looked as though somebody had dropped theball. We then went with our blue badges in hand to a second set of elevators, wentdown one more floor, exited where they gave us our orange badges back - orit looked like our orange badges. Following our orange badges, we enteredinto - it looked like - well, I've never been to the New York City subway,but it looked like a small monorail system, something like Disneyland likeIt's A Small World little monorail. We traveled probably several hundred yards in the monorail, exited, weregreeted by a staff scientist who then told us he would escort us down ahallway to show us our areas of responsibility. At this point, they had anear civil rebellion on their hands because we didn't know what the hellthey wanted us for. I was started to get worried at this point that theywere just taking us further and further into a facility and that graduallydoors were going to lock. But given the number of guards they have in thefacility, I should have said all along the way there were people who lookedlike they had R-15s. (spelling?) Not a place to fight anybody. So we went down the hallway into the briefing room, at which point we wererequested to perform an analysis of a plasma (??) recombination involvingrestriction enzymes on a variety of tissue, to remove segments of aretro-virus fragment from a variety of tissue, and if possible, associatethat retro-virus fragment with the genome of the papilloma virus. WHAT WAS THE SOURCE OF THE TISSUE? DID THEY GIVE THAT? The source of the tissue was listed with a J number and a K number. The twoscientists that were with me did not immediately know what that meant, givenmy experience at Sector 4, I knew fairly quickly that I was dealing with aJ-Rod sample. OF AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL SOURCE? Yes, J-Rods are still defined - even though what we know concerning theissue of the Paradox - they are still defined as extraterrestrial biologicalentities, given the disassociation time between the Earth and where they end"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"up. RIGHT. I don't do things without reason. The two scientists who were with me, Ididn't know them from Adam previous to the meeting, but I sort of spilledthe beans and let them know about the K.4 samples at Sector 4. The K.4samples at Sector 4 specifically involved the research project having to dowith Project Aquarius, in which I was one of the Working Group Leaders.Pardon me, these are difficult things to say to the camera. I UNDERSTAND. PROCEED AT YOUR OWN PACE. I have no choice. (laughter and pause)Following spilling the beans, we were separated into three separate rooms.Then proceeded the interrogation. They wanted to know why I told them aboutthe K.4 samples. And it's the old axiom: if you are asked why, you ask whynot? The interrogation ceased fairly quickly at that point and we werebrought into a clean sphere environment, external capsule clean sphereenvironment, where we were told what the real purpose of the project was.Now, I have to be very careful. Having had no previous experience withbiological warfare - I don't have a polygraph hooked to me here - having hadno previous experience involving biological warfare materials, it came asquite the surprise to me that they could possibly be considering the usageof an alien retro-virus recombined with a terrestrial viral genome forpossible use in biological-chemical warfare activities - or at leastpossible use in activities which could move towards biological warfare asapplied terrestrially. But this was inconsistent - the potential, I should say, the potential, orits use in that type of environment - was inconsistent with my ethicalboundaries. It would have exited the ethical boundaries that I place uponmyself as a scientist and I believe that society places on me as ascientist. It also would divert from moral boundaries that I think myCreator places upon me as a human being. Therefore, my answer was no. And Ithought that was it, no more participation. I thought that would have beenall she wrote. They agreed to house me in the facility where I went with my cute littleorange badge to a residential unit a little further down the tramline andone level below that. They did not change my orange badge when I went onelevel below. My experience in the time that I think I stayed in aresidential unit there was horrifying. You know when you hear human beingsscreaming in pain? YES. (long pause) I think I said what I need to say.\" **(1) Dan called S-4 either Sector 4 or Site 4 variously.(2) FM usually means \"Facility Maintenance\"(3) Strategic Tactical Advanced Alien Response Continued in Part 2More Information:Dan B.
