O. and CDC© 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe March 28, 2003 Geneva, Switzerland -Q : What are the symptoms of SARS ?A : The main symptoms of SARS are high fever (greater than 38° Celsius or100.4 Fahrenheit), dry cough, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties.Changes in chest X-rays indicative of pneumonia also occur. SARS may beassociated with other symptoms, including headache, muscular stiffness, loss ofappetite, malaise, confusion, rash and diarrhea.In the early stages the symptoms are similar to those of many diseases includinginfluenza. Heightened awareness about the disease, and the vigilance of healthauthorities around the world, have resulted in a close watch for suspected casesand rapid and thorough reporting. Not all of these suspected cases may prove tobe SARS. There are many reports and rumors coming in from around the world,but quite a few of these will turn out to be normal wintertime activity of diseaseslike influenza whose early symptoms are similar.Q : How contagious is SARS ?A : Based on currently available evidence, close contact with an infected personis needed for the infective agent to spread from one person to another. Contactwith aerosolized (exhaled) droplets and bodily secretions from an infectedperson appears to be important. To date, the majority of cases have occurred inhospital workers who have cared for SARS patients and the close familymembers of these patients. However, the amount of the infective agent needed tocause an infection has not yet been determined. (Transmission by air is still apossibility.)Q : How should SARS patients be managed?A : Patients should be placed in an isolation unit. Strict respiratory and mucusolbarrier nursing is recommended. It is very important that suspected cases areseparated from other patients and placed in their own hospital room. Health careworkers and visitors should wear efficient filter masks, goggles, aprons, headcovers, and gloves when in close contact with the patient.Q : What is the treatment for SARS ?A : While some medicines have been tried, no drug can, at this time, berecommended for prophylaxis or treatment. Antibiotics do not appear to beeffective. Symptoms should be treated by adequately protected healthprofessionals. Ten percent of the China cases have needed ventilators.Q : When will this disease be identified ?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"A : An international research project to look for the pathogen was establishedMonday, March 17, 2003. Eleven top labs in ten countries are consulting dailyand are working together to identify what causes SARS. Various specimens havebeen collected from cases and post-mortem examinations. Laboratory tests areongoing and possible culprits are in the paramyxo (mumps, measles, croup) andcorona virus (common cold) families.Q : How fast does SARS spread ?A : SARS appears to be less infectious than influenza. The incubation period isshort, estimated to range from 2-7 days, with 3-5 days being more common.However, the speed of international travel creates a risk that cases can rapidlyspread around the world.Q : Where and when was the first case of SARS reported ?A : On 26 February, a man was admitted to hospital in Hanoi with high fever,dry cough, myalgia (muscle soreness) and mild sore throat. Over the next fourdays he developed increasing breathing difficulties, severe thrombocytopenia(low platelet count) and signs of adult respiratory distress syndrome requiringventilator support.Q : How many cases of SARS have been reported to date ?A : From 1 February to 24 March, 1485 cases and 53 deaths have been reported.The cumulative number of cases and deaths is continuously updated on theWHO web site.Q : How many countries report cases of SARS ?A . As of March 28, cases had been reported in fifteen countries, including HongKong, China; Guangdong Province, China; and Taiwan, China. Of these, fourcountries have only imported cases with no documented local transmission,indicating that the disease is not spreading in these countries and residents arenot at risk.Q : Could SARS result from bioterrorism?A : There is no indication so far that SARS is linked to bioterrorism.Q : Should we be worried ?A : This illness can be severe and, due to global travel, has spread to severalcountries in a relatively short period of time. However, SARS is not highlycontagious when protective measures are used, and the percentage of cases thathave been fatal is low, about 3% so far.Q : Could this be the next flu pandemic ?A : Tests have not yet conclusively identified the causative agent of SARS. Thepossible involvement of an influenza virus was an initial concern.Q What does WHO recommend ?A : WHO recommends that global surveillance continue and that suspectedcases are reported to national health authorities. WHO urges national healthauthorities to remain on the alert for suspected cases and followedrecommended protective measures. SARS patients should be isolated and caredfor using barrier nursing techniques and provided with symptomatic treatment.Singapore, Hong Kong and Toronto, Canada are enforcing quarantines to helprestrict the spread of SARS.As of March 28, 2003"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"United StatesSuspected SARS pneumonia cases in the United States have climbed to 45 in 20states.Alabama 1California 12Connecticut 1Hawaii 3Illinois 1Kansas 1Maine 2Massachusetts 1Michigan 2Missouri 2Mississippi 1Minnesota 2New Jersey 3New Mexico 1North Carolina 2New York 8Ohio 1Pennsylvania 3Rhode Island 1Te x a s 3Utah 4Virginia 4Wisconsin 1Total Suspected U.
