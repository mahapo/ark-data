Ifconfirmed, this is a major discovery about the nature of the universe.\" George F. R. Ellis, \"The Shape of the Universe,\" Nature,Vol. 425, October 9, 2003, www.nature.com/nature Graphic of the lattice work of a dodecahedron that has 20 polyhedron vertices,30 polyhedron edges, and 12 pentagonal faces. Graphic © 2003 by Jeffrey Weeks, Ph.D. October 11, 2003 Canton, New York - Two of the big cosmic questions forcenturies have been:1) What is the shape of our universe?2) Is the universe finite (closed in a wrap around shape) or infinite (endlesslyopen)? New astronomical data is finally making it possible to know the answers. After more than two millennia of speculation, observational data might finallysettle these ancient questions. Back in 1917, Albert Einstein proposed that aspatially closed universe would perhaps make more sense because there wouldnot be the problem of boundary conditions at infinity. In fact, it's been arguedthat the only universe in which we can predict the astronomical future such asorbits of comets is a small, finite universe. The reasoning is that only in a small,finite universe would we have all the data needed to make calculations andpredictions. In February 2003, NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP)made very refined measurements of the slight changes in temperature of thecosmic microwave background radiation (CMB). Anisotropy means the densityfluctuations in the microwave background. The microwave radiation resultedfrom the Big Bang theorized to be the beginning of this universe. A group of scientists who have studied the new microwave data have proposedin the October 9, 2003, issue of the journal, Nature, that our universe \"isspatially closed\" and that the only universe model so far known which wouldmatch all the microwave density fluctuations is a Poincare dodecahedral space."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"That would also be a finite universe. If the universe were flat and infinite which is the current standard model ofcosmology, then microwaves from the Big Bang would fill the universe onwavelengths at small and large scales. But in the new NASA data, the broadestwaves are missing. The lead scientist proposing the finite dodecahedral universe is Jeffrey Weeks,Ph.D., an independent mathematician in Canton, New York, who received hisPh.D. in Mathematics from Princeton University and is currently supported by aMacArthur Foundation grant. Joining him in the Nature paper are Dr.Jean-Pierre Luminet of the Paris Observatory and three other French scientists.Dr. Weeks and his colleagues write: \"Microwave background temperature fluctuations arise primarily (but notexclusively) from density fluctuations in the early Universe, becausephotons traveling from denser regions do a little extra work against gravityand therefore arrive cooler, while photons from less dense regions do lesswork against gravity and arrive warmer. The density fluctuations acrossspace split into a sum of three-dimensional harmonics - in effect, thevibrational overtones of space itself - just as temperature fluctuations onthe sky split into a sum of two-dimensional spherical harmonics and amusical note splits into a sum of one-dimensional harmonics. The low quadrupole implies a cut-off on the wavelengths of the three-dimensional harmonics. Such a cut-off presents an awkward problem ininfinite flat space because it defines a preferred length scale in anotherwise scale-invariant space. A more natural explanation invokes afinite universe, where the size of space itself imposes a cut-off on thewavelengths. Just as the vibrations of a bell cannot be larger than the bellitself, the density fluctuations in space cannot be larger than space itself.Whereas most potential spatial topologies fail to fit the WMAP results, thePoincare dodecahedral space fits them very well.\" Interview: Jeffrey Weeks, Ph.D. in Mathematics from Princeton University,Independent Mathematician and Recipient of MacArthur FoundationGrant, Canton, New York: \"If you just look back over the past millennia, farand away the predominant model of the universe has been Aristotle's picture ofspace as this finite ball that just has an edge. You go out past all the planets andstars and you get to a spherical wall out there that's the end of space and you'renot supposed to ask what is beyond that.That was in western thinking, at least, that went unquestioned from the time ofthe ancient Greeks until the 17th Century. The whole idea of an infiniteuniverse, in a larger historical context, is something new. It's just with theinvention of the telescope that we started seeing stuff and realized the universe isbigger than Aristotle had given it credit for.Really, the pendulum didn't start to swing back the other way until the mid tolate 19th Century when people were a little uncomfortable about the idea of aninfinite universe, but they didn't like the idea of having a boundary, either. So,the solution was found in the form of a wrap around universe.We can make one if you want. Do you have a piece of paper there?YES.OK, if you take a piece of paper and imagine that's a universe for 2-dimensionalpeople to live on. Now, just sitting there as a piece of paper, it has an edge. Butif you take it and roll it around to make a cylinder, then the 2-dimensional folkson it they can travel off to the west and go right around and come back from theeast."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"RIGHT. AND THEY'LL END UP WHERE THEY STARTED.And they'll end up back where they started, yes. So, that's really the driving ideabehind all of this.COULD YOU EXPLAIN YOUR WORK PUBLISHED IN THIS WEEK'SJOURNAL, NATURE?Yes. Getting back to that cylinder. You take the cylinder and cut it open againand flatten it out to a piece of paper. But you still remember that it should bewrapping around and the same from top to bottom as if it rolls around thecylinder from top to bottom as well. So, if those 2-D people head north, theyjust roll right on and come back from the south.IS THAT THE COSMOLOGIST'SMETAPHOR OF THE BAGEL? (But thedodecahedron would be spherical, not bagel-flattened.)Yes. Right. So, from your piece of paper, all you need to do is bump that up adimension. Instead of thinking of it as a 2-D rectangle where you go off one sideand come back from the other, think of a 3-D block of space. Are you in arectangular room as we're speaking?YES.Super. So, there's your rectangular block of space and just like the 2-D peoplego off one side and come back from the other, imagine that if you go past onewall you come back from the opposite wall.If it's infinite, you just keep going and see new stuff for as long as you care totravel. But if it's finite, you go out one wall and come back the other wall. It'swrapping around like the cylinder wraps around. So, if you travel a certaindistance, before you know it, you're back at your starting point.ALL RIGHT. NOW, YOUR WORK.OK, this work is based on the data that just came in February 2003 from themapping satellite that is up there taking a good look at the microwave radiation in effect, the afterglow of the Big Bang. The big surprise in that data is that wesee fluctuations in the early universe denser regions, less dense regions. But thesurprise is you see small scale fluctuations, but you see only very, very weaklarge scale fluctuations. In affect, those large scale fluctuations are missing.It's kind of like if you're out on the open ocean and there are big waves comingby. There can be real long wavelength waves and on top of those, you havesuperimposed sort of medium-sized waves and maybe a little bit of light chop ontop of those. You have waves at all different scales.You can create the same effect by sloshing the water around in your bathtub.You'll get waves of all different scales, all sloshing around on top of each other.The only difference is that you won't get any really long wavelength waves inyour bathtub because your bathtub is not big enough to hold them.So, it's the same story in the universe. If you have a wrap around universe likethe cylinder, you won't get any waves that are longer than the cylinder is big.THAT IS THE FINITE UNIVERSE?Ye s .NOW, THAT LEADS TO THE QUESTION IN YOUR MODEL: WHY IS ITTHAT YOU HAVE COME UP WITH A SOCCER BALL, OR 12-SIDEDSPHERE?Yes, the dodecahedron, the 12-sided solid. Basically, that picture is almostexactly like the rectangular room where the walls connect up. Except instead ofusing that rectangular block of space, we want to start with this dodecahedralblock of space the 12 pentagonal faces, rather than your 6 rectangular walls."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"A dodecahedron is made up of 12 pentagonal faces. The six pentagonal faceson the left is one half needed to cover the curved sphere of the dodecahedron on the right.If flat pentagonalfaces were \"tiled\" on a flat, infinite surface, they would not quite fit evenly. But whenspace is curved,pentagonal faces tile together with each other perfectly, as in a soccer ball.Image © 2003 by Jeffrey Weeks, Ph.D.BUT WHY?Ah! Because when you do the computation for each kind of universe and whatsort of fluctuations do you expect to see when you look up in the sky they makeslightly different predictions. In the case of a rectangular room, they really don'tmatch too well what the satellite is seeing. But in the case of the dodecahedron,they match quite well.IF IT IS 12-SIDED, THERE IS AN ARTICLE BY DENNIS OVERBYEENTITLED 'A NEW MODEL OF THE UNIVERSE THAT IS SHAPED LIKE ASOCCER BALL.\"HE QUOTES YOU AS SAYING THAT THIS WOULD BE A 12-SIDED HALLOF MIRRORS IN WHICH THE ILLUSION OF INFINITY IS CREATED BYLOOKING OUT AND SEEING MULTIPLE COPIES OF THE SAME STARS.'COULD YOU ELABORATE?Yes. It's kind of like when you wake up in the morning and look in the mirror. Itlooks like there is another copy of yourself on the other side of the mirror. Butreally, it's not another person there. It's just a second image of the same person.IF THERE ARE 12 SIDES TO THE UNIVERSE, HOW MANY STARSWOULD HAVE TO BE REDUCED, HOW MUCH SIZE OF THE UNIVERSEWOULD HAVE TO BE REDUCED IF YOU ARE RIGHT?Not by a lot. It turns out that what we're actually seeing we don't see an infiniteuniverse because as we look out into space, we're looking back in time becauseof the amount of time that it takes light to reach us. So, we only see just a singleball of space, looking back to the beginning of time. Now, this dodecahedron issmaller than that ball, but not a lot smaller. It's maybe 3/4's of the way out there.So in rough terms, it says that we are seeing stuff on average maybe twice. Butwe're not seeing it dozens of times or hundreds of times.MEANING THAT IT'S (UNIVERSE) FINITE OR INFINITE AND THEREWILL BE NO MORE TWILIGHT GREY ZONE ABOUT WHICH IS WHICH?If you find the circles (See: More Information below), then you know it's finiteand you're done. If you don't find them, then it might be infinite but it might bethat the universe is finite but just too big for us to see all the way around. We'reonly seeing something like 46 some billion light years out into space. That's asfar as we can see. If the universe is finite and bigger than that, then we might notbe able to tell. (Editor's Note: The age of the universe is estimated to be 14billion years in time. During the expansion from the Big Bang to now, light willhave traveled an estimated 46 billion light years. That's the furthest we havepenetrated in \"seeing the universe\" and that distance is assumed to be the edge ofthe physical universe.)GIVEN THE WILKINSON MICROWAVE SATELLITE DATA FROM"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR, IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE FOR THE VERYFIRST TIME AT THE END OF 2003 AFTER THE CENTURIES THAT MANHAS WONDERED WHETHER THIS WAS A FINITE OR INFINITEUNIVERSE, THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO HAVE AN ANSWERTHIS FALL?Yes, I think it could wrap up pretty well. The only caveat is that if you find it'sfinite, then you've found a definite answer. If you find, it's not what you arereally detecting is that it's not small enough to fit within the horizon of what weare seeing. So, you're still not sure whether it's finite and just too big to see allthe way around, or whether it's truly infinite. So, we wouldn't have an answersaying it's definitely infinite. Only an answer that it's bigger than we can see.But it is exciting after millennia of speculation to finally have real data to lookat and get some sort of answer.\"More Information:Tests are underway to test the dodecahedron universehypothesisExcerpt from \"New Model of the Universe: It's Shaped Like A Soccer ball\" byDennis Overbye, The New York Times, October 8, 2003:\"In the model proposed by Dr. Weeks and his colleagues, three-dimensional space has 12 sides, like a soccer ball, or more technically, adodecahedron. Each face is 'glued' to its opposite number. A spaceshipcrossing one face or panel of the soccer ball about 37 billion light yearsfrom here would find itself entering the other side of the soccer ball; aftertraveling twice that distance (74 billion light years), it would find itselfback where it had started. For comparison, the light from the Big Bang hasexpanded over the course of cosmic time to fill a sphere 46 billion lightyears across, Dr. Weeks said. \"While the lack of cosmic low notes is suggestive (of finite universe),cosmologists say there is a definitive test of finite universes in theWilkinson (microwave radiation) map. When the cosmic radiationintersects the side of whatever shaped box is the universe, it would makeidentical circles (of density fluctuations), like a balloon squashed in a box,on opposite sides of the sky. In the case of a bagel, there would be twocircles in the map, on opposite sides of the sky. But in the case of Dr.Weeks's dodecahedron, there would be six pairs of circles, each about 35degrees in diameter.\" Some Astronomers Disagree with Dodecahedral TheoryAstronomers led by Dr. David Spergel of Princeton University say their ongoinganalysis of the same WMAP data has probably ruled out the soccer ball-shapeduniverse because they haven't been able to find the six pairs of circles ofmicrowave density fluctuations. Dr. Weeks's and Dr. Spergel's groups plan tomeet in Paris in mid-November to compare data and discuss the possibility thatthe search has not looked at smaller diameters at 35 degrees or less. Dependingupon that Paris meeting, the shape of our universe and whether it is finite orinfinite might be forthcoming within the coming months.We b s it e :http://www.geometrygames.orgCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
