Composite by Andreas Mueller, www.invisiblecircle.de. August 21, 2003 - Avebury, Wiltshire, England - This morning I talked withreporters, Lewis Cowen and Tamash Lal, respectively at the Wiltshire Gazette &Herald in Devizes and Evening Advertiser in Swindon, about the multipleeyewitness sighting of a black and white rotating disk over the Avebury stonecircle on Saturday evening, August 16, 2003, after 9 p.m., near dark. Thereporters concluded in their stories that the object was a \"prank,\" either acamouflaged microlight or remote-controlled model, but neither has anysubstantive proof. I also talked with eyewitness, John Pearce, resident ofWinterbourne Monkton, who is quoted in the articles, but his version is differentthan the media's.The Wiltshire Gazette & Herald ran a story today, August 21, 2003, headlined:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"RESIDENTS in Avebury gawped in wonder on Saturday night as a white,saucer-shaped UFO skimmed through the air over the village.Many drinkers taking the air outside the Red Lion Inn at about 9 p.m. stood inamazement as the object circled over the ancient Sarsen stones. Many got ontheir mobile phones and soon others came from Marlborough to see it.Then, after about ten minutes, the craft turned towards Calne and flew off.David Williams, a cellarman at the Red Lion said: 'It was a wonderful sight,but most people realised quite quickly it was a very clever scam. It was yourtraditional saucer shape, like two white soup plates turned upside down. Atfirst, it was thought it was a microlight in disguise, but I have since heard that itwas a remote-controlled model plane. A group of people were seen standing ona line of hay bales and we now think they were controlling it. Everybodyenjoyed it. It was very well done and I think the people responsible should becongratulated for giving us all a bit of a buzz.'Resident Richard (Report error - actual first name is John) Pearce, 21, whowas at the Red Lion when the saucer appeared, said he tracked it, saw it landin a field and watched two men dismantle it and pack it into a van.\"The reporter of that story, Lewis Cowen, told me, \"The object was definitely nota microlight disguised as a UFO. It was a remote-controlled craft.\" But when Iasked him what facts substantiated that hypothesis, he did not have any factsbeyond speculation.Then I talked with Tamash Lal, reporter of an Evening Standard story onWednesday, August 20, 2003, headlined:It was like something out of a 1950s science fictio movie. A villager rushedinto the local pub and shouted, 'Come and have a look at this!'Drinkers rushed outside and stood open-mouthed as a circular metallic dischovered in the sky. This was the scene in Avebury at the weekend when whatappeared to be a flying saucer came from nowhere and flew over the Neolithicstone circle. Motorists pulled over to catch a glimpse of the object, which was40 feet in diameter and appeared to be slowly rotating.Even sceptics were forced to admit that they were baffled by the saucer,which appeared in the sky around 9:30 p.m. on Saturday. But now the X-Filestype mystery has been solved by Winterborne Monkton resident, John Pearce.UFO spotters will be dismayed to learn that the object was not being flown bylittle green men, but by a pair of pranksters in a disguised microlight. John, 21,tracked the object for half a mile in his truck (report error: car was owned byJohn's friend, Trevor) and watched it land in a field off the A4 Calne toAvebury road.John said: 'I saw it in a field. There were two men dismantling it and loading itinto a white van. I asked them what they were doing and they told me theycouldn't say because it was top secret. They seemed worried, as if they wantedto get it packed away before anyone saw them.'John said it looked just like a classic flying saucer. He said: 'We were allstanding outside the pub watching it. I thought my eyesight was playing up. Ihad never seen anything like it. The only thing that made me think it was fakewas that it was wobbling a bit, and making a humming sound, like a microlight.I couldn't see what it was made of, but it looked pretty solid.'One of those taken in by the prank was Shaun Roe, an English teacher fromLondon who was enjoying a weekend break in Avebury. Shaun, 34, who tooka photograph of the object, said: 'It was about a mile away from us and camefrom the West Overton direction. It was silver with one white light and wasspinning slowly emitting a high pitched sound.'UFO enthusiast, John Hqanson, 57, who is investigating sightings in the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Swindon area, was not surprised by the prank. He said, 'It doesn't surprise meat all. Some people get a kick out of winding people up. There was a similarprank in Wiltshire around 10 years ago.'Wiltshire is a hotspot for numerous sightings of Unidentified Flying Objects inrecent years. Many objects have been seen over ancient stone circles, such asAvebury and Stonehenge. And Warminster was at the centre of sightings inBritain in 1965 when thousands of visitors arrived there to look for what wasknown as The Thing.\"Evening Standard, Swindon, Wiltshire, England, © August 20, 2003, Page 1headlineand photograph of Avebury UFO eyewitness, John Pearce, who went down theA4road with his friend, Trevor, to follow the rotating disk westward.Major Contradictions With Above Newspaper ReportsThis morning I talked by phone with John Pearce about what he and his30-year-old friend, Trevor, actually saw Saturday evening in Avebury.He stressed that:the two men did not see the disk landand they did not see anyone dismantle the craft.But they did drive west along the A4 road to Calne following the aerial diskslowly moving westward, rotating and wobbling. About a half mile fromAvebury at the copse of trees at the top of the hill not far from stables and nearwhere the huge \"bicycle wheel\" crop formation of 2002 appeared, they turnedleft up the dirt road that runs through the copse to more open ground. Whenthey had a view of the harvested stubble field on the Avebury side of the hill,they could see the disk down on the stubble on one side of a hedgerow. On theother side of the hedgerow parked about fifty feet from the object were thesilhouettes of one large semi-trailer truck and a smaller van.John and Trevor got out of Trevor's car and started across the field on the vanside of the hedgerow opposite the disk. Two tall men appeared at the vans andone walked toward them.Interview:John Pearce, 21-years-old, Nurseryman for Wooten Bassett Nursery, Bornand Raised in Winterbourne, Monkton, Wiltshire, England: \"They musthave been 50 feet away from this thing. We didn't walk to them. They actuallycame to us, so we must have been about 50 feet away. They came toward us andthe first bloke came out and spoke to us and said, 'We can't tell you nothing. It'sall TOP SECRET. Sorry.'WHAT DID THEY LOOK LIKE, THESE TWO INDIVIDUALS?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"They were both in late twenties, early thirties. Don't ask me what color hair theyhad, because I couldn't see that part. They were definitely white, tallish people.WHITE, TALLISH PEOPLE. DID THEY HAVE ON CLOTHING THAT YOUREMEMBER?Obviously, they had on clothing, but I don't remember. Obviously, there weretrousers because it is getting quite cold at that time. They had a coat and usualdress, casual, I would say.THEY ARE TALL AND WHITE AND WHAT DID THEY FIRST SAY?They said, 'What can we do for you, lads?' And we said, 'We just want to knowwhat's going on. You've got half of Avebury worried.' (Linda Howe's Note: Lowflying over the public monument of the Avebury stone circle where many peoplewere walking on a Saturday evening is illegal.)WHAT DID THEY SAY?They said, 'Well, we can't tell you anything. It's top secret.' I can't tell you muchmore than I've already told you, my dear. I've told you everything that I know.YOU SAID YOU DID NOT SEE THE OBJECT LAND.That's right. I just told people what I saw, what it was doing up in the sky. I can'ttell you why they had vans or anything else there. I don't know that.WHEN YOU WERE THERE TALKING TO THEM, HOW FAR WAS THEDISK-SHAPED OBJECT FROM YOU?It was on the other side of the hedge. So it was a good 20 yards from the hedge,so we must have been maybe 50 or 60 feet away from the hedge. So that was sayanother 60 feet.SO YOU WERE MORE THAN 100 FEET FROM THE OBJECT WHENTHESE MEN APPROACHED YOU?Ye a h .COULD YOU SEE THE OBJECT MORE CLEARLY THEN?No, because the hedge is quite thick. So we couldn't see and it was quite a tallhedge so you couldn't see over the top or in through the hedge. Obviously, thedaylight was failing, so we didn't stand much of a chance to see this thing.WHEN TAMASH LAL QUOTES YOU AS SAYING, 'I ASKED THEM WHATTHEY WERE DOING AND THEY SAID THEY COULDN'T SAY BECAUSEIT WAS TOP SECRET.'It is, that's what they were telling me. That's all they said to me. I can't tell youanymore because they didn't tell us anything.OK, BUT TAMASH LAL ALSO SAYS YOU SAID TO HIM: 'THERE WERETWO MEN DISMANTLING THE OBJECT AND LOADING INTO A WHITEVAN.' IS THAT TRUE OR NOT?Well, I saw two men walk out across this field towards this object, so obviouslythey must have been there dismantling it.BUT YOU DID NOT SEE THEM DISMANTLE IT?No, sorry.AND YOU DID SEE THE TWO MEN WALK TOWARDS THE OBJECT, BUTYOU STARTED ACROSS THE FIELD THEN WHEN YOU SAW THE TWOM E N WA L K T O WA R D T H E O B J E C T ?Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WERE THEY IN THE FIELD WITH THE OBJECT?Well, they were going across. Honestly, they must have heard us walking downthe field and then realized that they better find out what this is. But I don'tknow. All I can say is what I told you before: we walked across one blokewalked out and spoke to me. They both looked worried because they thoughtthey were going to be in some sort of problem, but I don't know. They just mighthave been worried and spoke to us.THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN GOVERNMENT, AS WELL.Well, we didn't ask them that. We just asked them what they were doing. Whatwas going on? And that's it. They didn't say much more than, 'Sorry, TOPSECRET, can't tell you.'SO YOU DID NOT SEE THEM DISMANTLE THE OBJECT. AND IF IUNDERSTOOD, YOU ARE ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEDGE. THEOBJECT IS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEDGE.Ye s .WAS THE OTHER PERSON ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HEDGEWHERE THE OBJECT WAS?Both were walking across the field toward me, but you've got to remember I hadto walk up a bit to get to the gate to cross over into that field.SO YOU GOT TO THE GATE.I walked through the gate. I had to walk down in the field, so that gave themenough time to get back across the field (toward me). Obviously, they had to putsomething into the van, so we probably just caught them as they were (gettingready) to do that.BUT DID TWO MEN COME TO YOU OR ONLY ONE?Just the one at first and then the second one came up sort of behind the van andthat was it. The other one didn't say anything to me or anybody else. They wereobviously more worried about getting this thing dismantled and put away.BUT YOU NEVER SAW THEM DO ANYTHING TO THIS OBJECT IN THEFIELD?No, nothing whatsoever.SO, WHAT YOU'VE GOT IS THAT YOU SAW TWO MEN WALK ACROSS OR START WALKING ACROSS FROM THE VANS TOWARD THE OBJECTIN THE CORN STUBBLE FIELD. YOU AND TREVOR, STARTEDWALKING ACROSS THE CORN STUBBLE FIELD.IS THAT RIGHT?Ye s .AND THERE IS A HEDGE ROW IN THIS FIELD BETWEEN THE VANSAND THE OBJECT?Yes, because obviously they were trying...BUT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE DOING. YOU JUST KNOWTHERE ARE TWO VANS, TWO MEN. THERE IS A HEDGE ROW AND ONTHE OTHER SIDE IS THE OBJECT.Ye s .SO YOU STARTED ACROSS THE FIELD ON THE VAN SIDE OF THEHEDGE ROW, RIGHT?Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"AND YOU HAD NOT CROSSED OVER THE HEDGE ROW INTO THE PARTOF THE FIELD WHERE THE OBJECT WAS LANDED?No, we didn't go near it, no.BUT THAT WAS YOUR INTENT, TO GET OVER INTO THE FIELD WHERETHE OBJECT WAS?Not really, just to get to a place where we could see through the hedge, to seethe object. I would have been happy doing that.AS YOU WERE GETTING CLOSE TO THE HEDGE, THAT IS WHEN ONEOF THE TWO MEN APPROACHED YOU?Oh, yes, because they were afraid we were going to see more than what theythought we were going to see.AND THE MAN WALKS UP TO YOU AND HE IS TALL, WHITE-SKINNED...Yeah, tall, white male and in casual clothing.WAS THE CLOTHING DARK?I don't know. I didn't really care much about the clothing. I was more interestedin finding out what this object was.WHEN HE SPOKE, WHAT EXACTLY DID HE SAY?I asked him, 'What was going on?' And he said, 'I can't tell you because it is TOPSECRET.'AND DID HE TELL YOU GUYS TO LEAVE?No, no, we just said, 'Fair enough. We're going.' And we went.SO THE LAST YOU SAW WAS THE MAN WHO TALKED WITH YOU. THESECOND MAN WAS BACK NEAR ONE OF THE VANS THAT WERE ONTHE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HEDGE ROM FROM THE OBJECT OUT INTHE CORN STUBBLE FIELD?Ye s .AND THEN YOU NEVER SAW THEM APPROACH AND DISMANTLEANYTHING OF THIS OBJECT?No, nothing of the sort. We did not see them approach this. After we left, we didnot see them approach it or dismantle it. We just tried to find out what wasgoing on. They obviously didn't want to tell us, so we left and that's when wewent up to the other side of the field to have another look at it and obviously, itwas gone by then.YOU COULDN'T SEE THE VANS EITHER?Couldn't see nothing whatsoever.COULD THOSE VANS HAVE GOTTEN OUT WITHOUT PASSING YOU ONTHE ROAD?Well, we had to come back in the other side. Since we came in from the otherside, then they would have gone probably the other way. I don't know whathappened. I don't know which way they went. I never seen the vans go. Theywere gone by the time we got to the other side of the hill to have a look. I don'tknow what happened after that.WHICH WAS MAYBE ABOUT 5 OR 6 MINUTES LATER, AS YOU SAIDBEFORE?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Yes. Nobody will ever know what happened after we left there. That's all I canhelp you with.THE QUESTION ALSO REMAINS: WHO WERE THOSE TWO MEN ANDWHY?I really don't know who they were.AND WHY WERE THEY SAYING IT'S 'TOP SECRET' WHICH IS A PHRASEUSED BY GOVERNMENTS?I don't know. it was probably just a way to get rid of us. Obviously, it was just aquick method to get rid of us and you're not going to know what this thing is.I WOULD THINK THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PART OF YOUR STORY ISYOUR TRYING TO GET CLOSE TO SEE THE OBJECT AND HAVING AMAN APPROACH YOU AND SAY IT WAS TOP SECRET.I couldn't tell you if it was government or somebody down the road just having alaugh.HOW DID THEY MAKE THIS OBJECT THAT HOVERED OVER AVEBURYFOR TEN MINUTES AND THEN FLOATED WEST, WOBBLING? HOW DIDTHEY MAKE IT?I don't know. I can't tell you. I don't know. I really wish I knew!\" The videotape photographer at the Avebury stones, Simon Beard, this morningcalled British SKY Broadcasting's engineering tech, Miles Johnston, and toldhim that he had heard the disk had been made by the special effects people whoproduce the James Bond feature films.
