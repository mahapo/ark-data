D., is an internistgeriatrician at Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center in Denver, Colorado. Aftergraduating from the University of Colorado Medical School in 1982, he did afellowship in Health Administration at Harvard University in 1986 and asabbatical in clinical preventative medicine at Stanford University in 1991.Recently, Dr. Gahm has been caring for seventy-five elderly patients and two,who tested positive for Influenza A, died. That's 3% of his patients. Dr. Gahmpoints out that if the 80 some nursing homes in Colorado each had 75 patients,that's about 6000 sick people in nursing homes. Three percent of those is 180likely deaths from influenza A. But influenza deaths in the elderly are notrequired to be reported. It's pediatric deaths which must be reported. Currentlyin Colorado, there are eleven confirmed pediatric deaths with two moresuspected. Dr. Gahm thinks it is important to understand how many elderlydeaths are under-reported which emphasizes why it is as important for thoseover sixty with weaker immune systems to get vaccinated each flu season as it isfor young children whose immune systems are not developed. As of this date, Colorado's public health offices are reporting 9,300 confirmedcases of Influenza A since October. \"That's five weeks of hard hitting flu which isvery unusual and it's not over yet. Usually flu peaks for a couple of weeks andtapers off. No one was prepared for such a dangerous flu so early in the season -that's why most people had not even had flu vaccines in October and that's whythe Fujian was able to spread so fast,\" Dr. Gahm explained. I asked him today about the headlines he generated last week when he said hesuspects hundreds of elderly people in Colorado have died of the Fujian flustrain.Gregory Gahm, M. D., Internist Geriatrician, Department of Geriatrics,University of Colorado, Presbyterian St. Luke's Medical Center, Denver,Colorado: \"I stand by my earlier statement last week that many elderly peoplein Colorado's 80 nursing homes have died from Fujian-related illness. If we'vegot a close facility, there are very few more common viral diseases that spread asquickly as influenza does and come on all at once. So, if we have a facility withseven or eight people that all within a couple hours start coughing with a highfever and we test two or three and get one or two positives, we immediatelyjump to the conclusion that they are all influenza which is a reasonable jump tomake. But because we didn't actually go test the other ten or twelve people, wedon't report them.So, even in nursing homes probably when we're testing, we're only reportingabout 20% of the number of people who actually have it. I think last night wewere at about 9,300 positive influenza tests in Colorado and I think that is only10% to 20% of the actual number of people who have actually had clinicalinfluenza.HOW MANY HAVE DIED FROM INFANTS TO THE ELDERLY SO FAR?That gets tough because the Health Dept. only tracks pediatric deaths, and Ithink we are at 11 and two questionable. So we might be at 13 young childrenright now. In a normal year in this state, we have two to three. So we're at aboutfive times the normal in pediatric deaths."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"One of the misleading things that has come out in the media is, 'No elderlydeaths have been reported, so maybe it's just hitting kids.' No, elderly have beenreported because even in my patients, when I knew they died from influenza andI fill out their death certificate and list cause of death, influenza, that ends up ona death certificate. It goes to a county recorder's office. It gets filed away andthree to five months from now, somebody might pull those and enter them andtry to track and see. I'm trying to be specific about listing the death as influenzaif I think that's the cause. But more often death certificates for the elderly willsay emphysema, heart attack, cardio-pulmonary arrest they are not going to sayinfluenza. But if you track it back the fact that you had ten times as manymyocardial infarctions over a two week period and influenza happened to beterribly prevalent here is a good indication there is a link.But legally, I don't have to report those deaths as influenza. There is nobody toreport them to and nobody has the time to do that. So it ends up real misleadingto say that all the deaths are pediatric because that's the only thing we track.COMING BACK TO YOUR OWN SAMPLING OF 3% OF THE 75 PATIENTSTHAT YOU ARE TRACKING DYING WITHIN 48 HOURS. IF YOU TAKETHAT 3% OF THE 9,300 COLORADO CASES THAT HAVE BEENIDENTIFIED SO FAR, YOU ARE HAVING MANY MORE DEATHS THANHAVE BEEN REPORTED LINKED TO FUJIAN.Correct. Pandemic Threat in the Future?ARE WE MOVING INTO A TIME IN WHICH INFLUENZA A VIRUSESSUCH AS FUJIAN COULD BE CHANGING IN SUCH RADICAL FASHIONTHAT WE REALLY COULD BE HEADED TOWARD THE POSSIBILITY OFA PANDEMIC THAT COULD BE MORE DANGEROUS?I agree. I know there is a gentleman at Mayo and Paul Glezen, M. D., at Baylorwho have been trying to tell people, 'Don't be surprised if we get hit with apandemic.' But it probably won't be an A Fujian strain, something with differentproteins on the surface of the virus the H3N2 letters and numbers we talk about.If those are normal numbers if the H is a 1, 2 or 3 and the N is a 1 or 1 2, that'sjust not going to lead to a pandemic because there is a lot of natural immunity inthe human population against those kinds of viruses.I think the real scare is when there is a change to an H5N2, sort of like thechicken flu, and it happens to be a variant that people have not seen at all. Ifthere is a major change like that like with the chicken flu (that caused HongKong to kill over a million chickens to control the virus), it fortunately was notvery virulent. So, it didn't spread far and fast as SARS did later. I think if we seesomething like an H5N1 or H5N2 and it also spreads pretty quickly, then I thinkwe'll be in for a pandemic.AND WHAT DO WE DO THEN WHEN WE'VE HAD EVEN A PROBLEMNOW OF HAVING THE HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE DEAL WITH ANINFLUENZA IN THE FALL OF 2003?I think what we do then is hope that the World Health Organization (W.H.O.)keeps doing a good job of surveillance and can find it quickly and we candevelop vaccines quickly because that clearly is the best option. Still for thisyear, that's the best option. For people who haven't been vaccinated, getvaccinated. If you can't find normal vaccines, get FluMist. It's a little moreexpensive, but it's a lot cheaper and easier than putting up with the symptoms ofthe disease."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"2004 Flu VaccineWILL THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES SUCH AS CHIRON, WYETHAND AVENTIS HAVE MANUFACTURED A FLU VACCINE THAT WILLDEFINITELY COUNTER THE FUJIAN H3N2 NEXT FALL 2004? IUNDERSTAND IT IS HARD TO GROW AND I'M CURIOUS IF THATMEANS THAT THE AUSTRALIAN AND NEW ZEALAND DOCTORS WHOHAVE BEEN WORKING WITH IT SINCE E THE SUMMER WHEN FUJIANERUPTED THERE HAVE THEY BEEN ABLE TO COME UP WITH ASUCCESSFUL VACCINE TO FUJIAN IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE?Yes and no. There are a number of people, even here in the U. S., who have. Butit requires a little bit different technique. Whenever you do something new ordifferent, if you are Chiron, Aventis or Wyeth or anyone else, the first thing islitigation fears. I think they can grow this Fujian virus I think in dog kidney cells(and not in egg which is standard). But even if they do that to create Fujianvaccine that will protect 100,000 people, there are going to be 6 people in those100,000 that have a bad reaction to the dog-kidney-produced vaccine and whowill sue the manufacturer because the dog kidney was used.THE MEDICAL RESEARCHERS CANNOT GROW FUJIAN IN EGG THEWAY THEY USUALLY DO WITH INFLUENZA?Right, not the normal techniques. They have to use other techniques and thepharmaceuticals have to get those approved and have some sort of assurancebecause it is a little different that they are not going to be held liable if this doesnot work or causes problems they cannot foresee because they have not done itbefore.I think the other thing that makes the A Fujian this is sort of a mixed message:part of the good for 2004 about A Fujian is because so many people will beexposed this year, they will carry that immunogenicity over to next year. So, thechances that A Fujian will do the same thing a year from now are prettyminimal. But here is one A strain that could do this and means there could beothers. So, in general, we need to have a better national policy to figure out howto do this, how to make enough vaccine.One of the nice things about all this is that people are scared enough that theyare a little less worried about the shot than getting the flu from the shot, an oldwives tales and myth, that keep people from getting vaccinated every year.Maybe people will develop a better public policy and people will be morewilling to be vaccinated year to year.WHAT I'VE LEARNED FROM YOU TODAY IS THAT WE CAN'T ASSUMEA GUARANTEE THAT INFLUENZA CAN EVEN BE MADE EASILY IN AVACCINE.Right. And difficult to make them cost-effective to produce on a massive scale.In a good public policy, we need to have at least half or two-thirds of thepopulation vaccinated every year. We need to expand to healthy, school-agekids and healthy young adults. They are the ones that spread the flu so quickly.If we had such a national policy, then the pharmaceuticals would have the timeand ability to figure out how to make 160 million doses of vaccine of A Fujianthat does not grow well in eggs.WHAT DO WE DO ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE AFRAID OF GETTINGANY VACCINES BECAUSE OF THE CONSPIRACY THEORIES THATVACCINES ARE BEING USED AGAINST US?I run into that all the time and wish them the best if a bad strain comes alongand they get very sick. Those fears usually last clear up until you havesomething like this and then there is a fear of death for your kids and vaccinationlooks like it's protective. Again, once you stop and understand a little moreabout the vaccination process, it's a lot harder to justify that you get flu from the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"vaccine.
