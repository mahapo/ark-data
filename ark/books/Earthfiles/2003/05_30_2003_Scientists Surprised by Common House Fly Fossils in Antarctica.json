May 30, 2003 Fargo, North Dakota - Earlier in May, the journal Naturepublished the discovery of common house fly fossils in Antarctica that surprisedscientists and could re-write history about the now-ice continent, the evolutionof flies, and cycles of global warming and cooling on Earth.Geologist and paleontologist, Allan Ashworth, Professor and Chairman of theDept. of Geosciences at North Dakota State University, lead a team into theTransantarctic Mountains only 300 miles from the South Pole. There, rocks areexposed from all the churning of glaciers over millions of years on themountains. The scientists did not expect to find fossils of \"higher flies,\" theCyclorrhapha family, that include the modern day common house fly.Beardmore glacier, Antarctica, looking south from the fossil site.The mountains are part of the Dominion Range of the Transantarctic Mountains.The polar plateau is on the horizon.

Then big tectonic plate movements began and pushed the landmasses apart into what we know today as continents. Were the flies, or theirancestors, on Gonwanaland when it split up? Or did the flies some how get tothe Antarctic continent after the split?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Occurrences of unusual geological structures and of plant and animal fossilsfound on the matching coastlines of South America and Africa and their association withAntarctica and Australia, which are now widely separated by the Atlantic Ocean after theone large land mass, Gonwanaland, was split up at least 200 million years ago.I asked Prof. Ashworth whether the fly fossils could be from a time when therewas no ice at the South Pole or a time when there was a lot of ice?Looking eastward across the Beardmore glacier to the Queen Alexandra Range.The rippled blue surface sculpted by wind looks like frozen waves. When the flies of thefossils inhabited this region millions of years ago, the Beardmore valley would havebeen a huge, ice-choked fjord.

Weare working, it is the Trans-Antarctic Mountains which is an area of uplift. Thesemountains have been uplifted. As they uplift, the glaciers that flow from thisgreat central area of Antarctica the polar plateau then are eroding down intothose mountains. So along these great glaciers, the mountains and the rocks areall exposed in these polar deserts. As geologists, we can explore the edges ofthese glaciers and find the deposits of the ancient glaciers. That's basically whatthis sequence is, where we're getting these fossils out of. We can then collect thesamples just as rocks. We're not actually drilling in ice. We're not doing that tocollect the samples. We're like regular geologists, except we're on a very frozenlandscape."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Prof. Ashworth in front of a section of Sirius Group deposits (similar type and ageto those that the fossils came from) on Bennett Platform, Shackleton Glacier. Ashworth'shandis on a dropstone a boulder dropped from a melting iceberg. You can see how the boulderdeformedthe sediments when it landed on the lake or fjord floor. The layered nature of the depositsindicates that they were deposited in a glacial lake or a fjord.We imagine the environment they lived in was tundra. There are things likeshrub and form of a Southern Beech that only creeps along the ground a typicalgrowth form of tundra environments. There are cushion plants which are anothertypical growth form of tundra environments. There are buttercups. They werelike tundra meadows. This was the environment that this particular fly was livingin. There had to be - the Beardmore Glacier today must have been a fiord at thattime, a giant fiord that opened up from the Ross Sea all the way into the interioror Antarctica, more than 100 miles. It was a gigantic fiord and up this fiord then,these plants and animals including the fly, plus some beetles and some freshwater mollusks these animals or organisms had to be able to migrate up thisfiord during this warm episode.The question for us, for me as a paleontologist, is: Had these organisms thensurvived all the time from that very early time in Antarctica? Are these then thedescendants from organisms that lived back at the time of the dinosaurs?65 MILLION YEARS AGO.Yes. And did they live in all that time around the edges of Antarctica? Or furtherinland?HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR FLY FOSSIL WILL HELP YOU UNDERSTAND?What it does do from the point of view of the evolution of organisms is that ittell us that this particular group of flies were present in Antarctica, whereasbefore it was believed that they weren't there. And so, it gives us an alternativeways of looking at fly evolution. We don't have enough evidence at the momentto say that these higher flies might even have evolved on Gonwanaland and thenbeen taken to the Northern Hemisphere as the continents rafted apart inGonwana. We don't have the evidence to do that, but it opens up the possibilitythat that could have happened.COULD THE FLIES THAT YOU HAVE FOUND IN THE FOSSILS HAVEACTUALLY BEEN BUZZING AROUND DINOSAURS AT SOME TIME?Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.IF SO, AND WE KNOW THERE WERE DINOSAUR FOSSILS INANTARCTICA, YOU ARE TRYING TO FILL IN THESE MISSING PIECESOF A PUZZLE THAT CAN GET UP TO ABOUT 30 MILLION YEARS AGOAND THEN BETWEEN 30 OR 33 MILLION AND 23 MILLION, THERE IS AKIND OF MYSTERY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THE EARTH'SCLIMATE. AND SINCE 23 MILLION YEARS AGO, IT IS SORT OFACCEPTED THAT THERE HAS BEEN A GENERAL AND GRADUALBUILD UP OF ICE THERE.Yes, the picture of climate change over the last 65 million years there is ageneral cooling of the Earth's climate from the time of the dinosaurs at 65million years ago. What happens then, is until about 34 million years ago, theclimate oscillates in some pretty big swings going between warmer and coolerphases, but it was generally on the warmer side. And then right around 34million years ago, there is this big decline in carbon dioxide. Then once again,after that, it goes into a more cooler phase of Earth's history leading up to the iceages in there.Did the fly, this organism, was it flying around? Or were its ancestors flyingaround at the time of the dinosaurs? And did they then as the climate oscillated,did they periodically move their distributions across Antarctica. Then as the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"climate really started to cool down, were they forced to live just on the edges ofAntarctica and have their habitats on the edges? Maybe in one of these latephases of warming in Antarctica was this fly able to migrate along with all theseother organisms plants and animals up the fiords and reoccupy the interior of thecontinent again?LEAVING THE GIGANTIC QUESTION: WHAT FORCED ALL THIS TOHAPPEN?Yeah! What did? We just don't there are different hypotheses in there someinvolve tectonic changes on land and erosion of mountains, locking up then ofcarbon dioxide in rocks in the oceans so the oceans act as a sink for carbondioxide, they then reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmospherewhich then leads to cooling. Once you get ice, you can have albido affects of theice where you get reflection of heat back (into the atmosphere), so there is afeedback. There are all sorts of complicated events occurring that once you startthe process going, you can imagine that you can get this type of coolingoccurring.IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT PERHAPS THE EARTH NEVER HAD ICE CAPSPRIOR TO APPROXIMATELY 34 TO 23 MILLION YEARS AGO?No. No. The Earth has undergone several glaciations and they go all the wayback into what geologists call pre-Cambrian times, billions of years ago.WILL YOU BE ABLE TO DATE THE FOSSIL OF YOUR FLY VERYPRECISELY?Probably not. If we can get it within a million years, we would be extremelyhappy at this particular time.WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT TO GET A FINER AGE?The type of deposits that these fossils occur in are the deposits associated withglaciers. We any organic material that's in there we think of ways to date morerecent sediments, like we would use radio carbon dating. But radio carbondating is only good back to about 40,000 years. These fossils are definitely inthe order of millions of years old. So, we are beyond the capabilities of radiocarbon dating.Our best bet and we haven't been able to find it yet is to find volcanic ashes thatwould be included in these sediments, would be embedded in these sediments,so we might find a volcanic ash below the fossil-bearing beds or above it andthen we could use the minerals that occur in the volcanic ash the feldspar wecould use types of dating that are referred to as potassium-argon or argon-argondating to give age estimates.In that case, if we were able to do that, we probably could get within tens ofthousands of years if we had access to the volcanic ashes. But so far, we haven'tdiscovered any volcanic ashes at this particular locality.HOW LONG WILL IT BE BEFORE YOU THINK YOU'VE GOT A PRETTYGOOD AGE?I'd like to think that in a year's time, we would have a good age. But that'sprobably pretty optimistic. We're assuming at the moment that the age of this flyis going to come in somewhere between about 17 million and 3 million yearsago. There's an outside chance it could be older."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Prof. Ashworth: \"The fly fossil comes from siltstone containing other fossilsand obvious pieces of Nothofagus wood . An age of 3 million years has been assignedto the deposits based on reworked marine diatoms. However, the age is controversialbecause somescientists feel that the diatoms could be windblown and a lot younger the deposits. Thefossil flyand other fossils in the assemblage, including cushion plants that are 2 feet in diameter, aredefinitely not windblown. The organisms inhabited the head of a fjord and there fossilswerebrought together by meltwater stream processes of erosion and redeposition.\"AND THAT THESE LITTLE FLIES THAT YOU NOW HAVE IN THE FOSSIL,THEY HAVE FLOWN AROUND IN ANTARCTICA AND NOBODY KNOWSFOR SURE EXACTLY HOW LONG. THEY AREN'T THERE NOW,THOUGH.No. This type of fly is no longer present in Antarctica.I'VE ALWAYS THOUGHT ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS TOUNDERSTAND ABOUT THE EARTH IS IMAGINING A TIME WHEN THEPOLES HAD NO ICE AND THEN THE CONDITION TODAY OF THREEMILES THICK ICE. HOW DOES THAT MACHINERY GET SET IN MOTIONTHAT SOMETHING CAN GO FROM TREES AND INSECTS AND OPENLAND TO THREE MILES THICK OF ICE?Yes, and I think you have to think in terms of you do! you have to think in termsof a very different Earth. We know then, for instance, in the Cretaceous periodthat sea floor spreading rates were a lot different than they are now. They seemto have been faster. You have to think more CO2 being in that atmosphere. Butexactly what drives all those changes so we can understand the rhythms ofclimate change. We've got some clues. We know that the relationship of theEarth to the sun, the so-called Milankovitch cycles we know they are involvedin the rhythm of ice ages. But what is changing these big values in CO2 is one ofthe great quests that climate scientists are trying to solve.IT'S REALLY A MYSTERY.It is a mystery.THE FLY SORT OF SITS JUXTAPOSED AGAINST ALL THAT ICE AS AQUESTION WE HAVE ABOUT OURSELVES. HUMANS JUXTAPOSEDAGAINST A POSSIBLE GLOBAL WARMING TREND, BUT AS YOU HAVEPOINTED OUT, THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY VARIABLE CYCLES OFWARMING AND COOLING THAT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS. COULD WEIN THE FUTURE BE FACED WITH ANOTHER GIGANTIC ICE AGE?Oh, yeah. I think most scientists who work in my field, we work in this last partof geological time, we would argue that this last ice age we had was cyclical andthat the ice ages, glaciation, seem to occur on cycles of about 100,000 years forat least the last million years. There's a change in frequency of them, but at any"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"rate, the bets would be from the majority of us that there is going to be anotherice age.\"Prof. Allan Ashworth in front of the Beardmore glacier just above the locationthat the fossils come from.
