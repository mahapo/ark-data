December 13, 2003 Nine Mile Island, Ruby, Alaska - At the end of August2003, I reported about a mysterious crop pattern near the Serpent Mound inOhio discovered on August 24, and the interest of the United States Air Force inthat crop pattern and several others that emerged in the Ohio and Wisconsinregion during the 2003 summer. What none of us knew was that on the rainyand foggy night of August 22nd near remote Ruby, Alaska (population 188) onthe Yukon River, one or more loud jets flew low and loudly up and down theriver for about ten minutes, according to witnesses.Then a couple of days later around August 24th, local residents reported theoddest site they said they had ever seen in the forest: large trees snapped offabout 20 to 40 feet above the ground like broken match sticks at a place calledNine Mile Island. The broken trees seemed to be confined to a circular areaabout 200 feet in diameter.A meteorologist at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks who did not travel toresearch the site said he thought it was probably the result of a \"microburst\" (seeMore Information below) usually associated with the rush of air down from rainhigh above and very dry air at ground level. However, the weather conditionswere rainy and foggy on the ground in late August."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"This week I talked about the discovery with Timothy Stathis, the Principal of theKangas School in Ruby who traveled with some native American Indians byboat to Nine Mile Island a few weeks ago to see the odd \"tree circle.\"Interview:Timothy Stathis, Principal, Kangas School, Ruby, Alaska: \"We had to gothrough some thickets to get to the area and then suddenly I was quite shockedto see this wide circle of area where huge trees, some with trunks as big as 18 to24 inches in diameter were snapped off. And not just some trees. We're talkingabout dozens and dozens of trees all in one area, some blown over and manysnapped off anywhere from 20 to 40 feet up in the air, snapped completely likea broken stick, huge trees. I was just shocked. The other men with us were asequally shocked seeing this for the first time. I questioned them all if they hadever seen anything like this before and all of them stated they never had in theirentire life living in the forest by the river all their lives out here.A section of the circular area of tall trees snapped off on Nine Mile Islandnear Ruby, Alaska. Photograph © 2003 by Pat McCarty.One of the people with us thought it was a UFO because of the systematic waythat it was put in the middle of nowhere.A few weeks later, I was flying in the area as a passenger on a small plane and Iasked the pilot to divert the course to fly over that area so we could see it fromthe air. It was equally dramatic to see it from the air it does look like a UFOlanded there because it is one circular pattern in this vast array of forest.(Unfortunately, on that plane trip, Timothy Stathis did not have his camera forphotographs and none of the Fairbanks media took any aerial shots.)It's hard to imagine this up here because Alaska is truly the last frontieruntouched by man and Ruby is just a dot in the midst of the landscape, as manyvillages are dotted throughout the state. So, one can fly for two hours in a smallairplane and not see any sign of civilization. When one is flying toward Rubyand sees this swath of trees in a circle in the middle of nowhere totally cutdown, it's quite dramatic.ABOUT HOW MUCH DIAMETER?We estimated the area to be about 200 feet in diameter. As we were on theground walking around and then later (when I saw it) from the air, there wasn'teven any signs of trees having fallen outside of that circular area. It was just thisone spot. One would think that if wind hit with such a force, you would at leastsee some random trees outside that circle that had received some brunt of thewind. There really weren't any other trees outside that circle that were hit. Someof the trees were completely uprooted."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Large uprooted tree inside the circle of snapped off trees on Nine Mile Islandnear Ruby, Alaska. Photograph © 2003 by Pat McCarty.DO YOU THINK THE MICROBURST EXPLANATION SOLVES THISMYSTERY?For people in the area after they had read the article or seen the televisionreports, they were not satisfied because it stirred a lot of conversation among thepeople of other UFO phenomenon they had seen bright lights, waked up bybright lights, or several people discussed a phenomenon they had seen last yearwhere people simultaneously but from different locations in the village had seena bright light moving, descending suddenly and then re-ascending suddenly. Sothis provoked a lot of memories in peoples' minds and they felt it (the downedtrees)was more a confirmation of the nearness of UFOs.Connected to that also some time in August, many people had reported during astorm time when it was very cloudy and there appeared to be a storm nearbythat they heard jets nearby Air Force jets. They heard one or more Air Force jetsin the area for at least 10 minutes going up and down the river which theythought was extremely unusual. then it was only later that the phenomenon inthe woods was noticed and some people put 2 and 2 together and thatreinforced for them that the Air Force might have been investigating somethingthat had happened in the area because they were hearing the jets.\"Row of small trees laid down, not cut, in circle of tall cut trees.Photograph © 2003 by Pat McCarty.More Information:MicroburstsDownburst less than 2.5 miles in diameterA downburst is a strong downdraft which includes an outburst of potentiallydamaging winds on or near the ground. If the diameter of the downburst is lessthan 2.5 miles, it is called a microburst. The diagrams below depict the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"evolution of a microburst.Development of microburst. Graphic courtesy University of Illinois.A microburst initially develops (above) as the downdraft begins its descent fromcloud base. The downdraft accelerates and within minutes, reaches the ground(contact stage). It is during the contact stage that the highest winds are observed.During the outburst stage, the wind \"curls\" as the cold air of the microburstmoves away from the point of impact with the ground. During the cushion stage,winds about the curl continue to accelerate, posing a great threat to nearbyaircraft.Cushion stage of microburst. Drawing courtesy University of Illinois.Cushion StageThese are very weak, high based showers without thunder, but with microbursts.Studies have shown that they predominantly occur in the High Plains andwestern U.S. - particularly in unstable, very dry low level environments withsurface temperature-dew point spreads of 30 to 50 degrees and an area ofmid-level moisture as a source for the weak showers.We b s it e s :http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/(Gh)/guides/mtr/svr/comp/out/micro/home.rxmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
