The team was authorized to travel to the provinceyesterday.Meetings were held today with senior provincial health officials. The WHO teamalso listened to reports about the SARS outbreak, and held initial meetings withhealth workers at all levels. These workers, who have first-hand knowledge ofthe outbreak, include epidemiologists and clinicians treating SARS patients.Discussion focused on patterns of transmission, clinical profiles, and thesuspected causative agent.Chinese authorities had previously reported a cumulative total of 1153 cases and40 deaths in Guangdong Province from 16 November, when the outbreak began,to the end of March, making this province the area most seriously affected bySARS to date.The world's first recognized case of SARS occurred in Guangdong Province on16 November. Expectations are high that important clues will emergeconcerning the origins of SARS, which is thought to be caused by a new virus inthe coronavirus family. The exact identity of the virus has proved elusive.Scientists, who confer daily in teleconferences organized by WHO, currentlyspeculate that the SARS virus either jumped to humans from an animal speciesor mutated into a more virulent form.In its continuing work, the WHO team is expected to visit Foshan city, where thefirst case of SARS was reported, and Guangzhou city. The team will also visithealth care facilities, review case records, and hold further discussions beforereturning to Beijing early next week.In Beijing, the government of China is now gearing up to fight SARS on apriority basis. Reports in today's media referred to a State Council executivemeeting on SARS and described three key decisions.* A special task force, headed by Minister of Health Dr Zhang Wenkang, willtake charge of the fight against SARS. A vice secretary-general of the StateCouncil will coordinate actions by relevant ministries.* The task force will provide updates on SARS to WHO.* A nationwide mechanism for outbreak alert and response will be set up shortlyto ensure rapid detection and reporting of outbreaks.Situation in Hong Kong SARThe Department of Health in Hong Kong SAR reported 26 new cases today,compared with 23 yesterday.

Patients whohave received good hospital support care, including ventilators, have survived. Infact, the mortality rate of the SARS pneumonia is running only about 3 to 5 %,but the potential severe lung damage in some of the cases demands expertmedical treatment and x-rays.We b s it e s :http://www.who.int/en/ (World Health Organization)http://www.cdc.gov/ (Centers for Disease Control)Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
