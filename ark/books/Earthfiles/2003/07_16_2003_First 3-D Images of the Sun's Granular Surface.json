This image near theeasternlimb of the sun was first taken on July 24, 2002, by Prof. Goran Scharmer and processed byDr. Mats G. Lofdahl, Institute for Solar Physics, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.July 16, 2003 Palo Alto, California - At the recent American AstronomicalSociety's Solar Physics Division meeting in Laurel, Maryland, solar physicistsfrom Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Lab (LMSAL) at the company'sAdvanced Technology Center in Palo Alto, California, along with otherEuropean scientists, presented the highest resolution images ever taken near thevisible edge of the sun.Tom Berger, Ph.D., principal scientist on the LMSAL study said, \"Until recently,we thought of the solar photosphere as the relatively flat and featureless 'surface'of the Sun, punctuated only by an occasional sunspot. Now, using the newlycommissioned Swedish one-meter Solar Telescope (SST) on the island of LaPalma, Spain, we have - for the first time - imaged the three-dimensionalstructure of the convective 'granules' that cover the photosphere.\"Instead of a flat surface, new images show granules, or irregular cellularpatterns, thought to be caused by temperature changes similar to the waybubbles rise to the surface in boiling water. The size of each granule isastounding - about the size of Texas - and there are hundreds of thousands ofthem. In these new, highly detailed images, sunspots appear as dark holes amidall the granules."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Image of solar active region taken on May 13, 2003, near the center of the sun.Small magnetic elements show up as small bright features in the dark lanes betweengranules.Their actual physical size is about 100 kilometers in diameter. One of the great mysteriesaboutthe sun is how do magnetic fields go from being small bright 'dots\" at the sun's center tolargefaculae near the limb? 2003 image by Dr. Tom Berger of the LMSAL, Palo Alto,California. Increased Sunspots Produce A Brighter SunBright structures near the edge of the sun known as \"faculae\" (little torches),could be linked to increased solar brightness that occurs in the eleven yearcycles of maximum solar magnetic activity. One of the paradoxes has been thatsolar maximums bring high concentrations of dark sunspots and logic wouldassume all those black spots would decrease solar light radiation over days andweeks. Instead, satellite radiometer data in the 1980s showed the sun'sbrightness increased as sunspot magnetic storms proliferated. That \"extrabrightness\" of the sun is now thought to be caused by the faculae. SpaceflightNow writes, \"Most of the bright structures seen are between 150 and 400kilometers tall and are typically elongated towards the limb. Simultaneousmeasurements of the magnetic field establish that the bright faculae are exactlyaligned with the magnetic fields.\"Image of a solar active region taken on June 6, 2003, near the eastern limb of the sun.The circle in upper right corner shows the Earth's diameter. The 3-dimensional granularsurface of the sun is distinct, the regions aroud the dark sunspots are higher than thesurroundingsurface, and the faculae appear as bright \"walls\" on some of the solar granules.

The Bright Sun Connection to Global Climate Change"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"If increased magnetic storms/sunspots are linked to increasing brightness of thefaculae and increased brightness is linked to more solar radiation on Earth andsubsequent warming of temperatures, then understanding exactly what makesthe solar light fluctuate might give us insights into global climate change. Prof.John Lawrence of California State University, Northridge, said, \"We can hope toincorporate the effects of magnetoconvection into solar irradiance models tobetter predict variations in solar output.\"We b s i t e :http://www.lmsal.com/Press/SPD2003.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
