The World Health Organization (W.H.O.) is analyzing themedical datato determine if this is where the worldwide Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome known as\"SARS,\" originated.March 21, 2003 - SARS is an acronym for Severe Acute RespiratorySyndrome, an atypical pneumonia that rapidly attacks alveoli lung tissue. Thisafternoon, Julie Gerberding, M. D., Director, Centers for Disease Control inAtlanta announced that:\"Some of the individuals with the severe SARS pneumonia and death havebeen relatively healthy, middle-aged people, and that tells us that this is adisease that can be virulent and life-threatening, even among those who areotherwise probably immunologically healthy. ...Further, the high attackrate in health care workers caring for the early hospitalized patients ...suggests that it is certainly contagious.\"- CDC is now monitoring 22 cases of the SARS pneumonia in the United States.California 6Hawaii 3Maine 1Massachusetts 1New Jersey 1New Mexico 1North Carolina 2New York 2Rhode Island 1Utah 1Virginia 2Wisconsin 1Total Suspected U. S. Cases Under Investigation: 22 - The mystery illness that attacks lung tissue has now been reported in 14countries."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"- The number of people infected with SARS depends on whether 305 cases inGuangdong Province, China, last month are included. The World HealthOrganization thinks Guangdong should be included; so far, the CDC has not.Thus, the total ranges between 337 and 654.- Officially, 10 SARS victims have died, but the number is changing daily.- In the last 24 hours, CDC has issued 35,000 health alerts to travelers arrivingin the United States.- CDC has begun meeting airliner and cruise ships to talk with ill passengers andisolate them in hospitals if SARS symptoms are evident.Airport traveler in China wearing mask because of SARS scare.Photograph © 2003 by Associated Press.What are SARS symptoms?According to the World Health Organization and the Centers for DiseaseControl in Atlanta,\"Most patients identified have been previously healthy adults aged 25 to 70,\"plus a few children, who suddenly have a:1) Fever of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.2) Headache.3) Dry cough.4) Trouble breathing.5) And either traveled to Southeast Asia, or are in contact with someone whodid.Any treatments helping?- Antibiotics don't work.- Anti-viral medicines might help.- But no treatment is known.- In 10-20% of the cases, patients are so sick they have been put on ventilatorsto get oxygen. That need for so many ventilators surprised David Heymann, M.D., and Executive Director of Communicable Diseases for the World HealthOrganization. I talked with him by phone this week in his Geneva, Switzerlandoffice.Interviews:David Heymann, M. D., Executive Director, Communicable Diseases,World Health Organization, Geneva, Switzerland: \"We do know that peopleget very seriously ill and we also know that if hospitals have the appropriateequipment, which they now have in Vietnam and they have had in Hong Kong,lives can be saved if patients are put on ventilators. But this is very unusual foran epidemic of this type of an atypical pneumonia to require respirators in many"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"instances. It's very unusual.IS IT TRUE THAT NONE OF THE TYPICAL ANTIBIOTICS ARE WORKINGAGAINST THE SARS DISEASE?It appears that is the case that normal antibiotics are not working, and anti-viralsare being tried and it's not clear if they have had any impact either.THAT'S WHY EVERYBODY IS BEING TOLD ON TELEVISION ANDRADIO IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS, PLEASE GO TO ANEMERGENCY ROOM OR A HOSPITAL?As far as we understand, that's exactly the reason, yes. We're in a state of alertlooking for possible suspect cases. Then of containment, isolation andcontainment, and working together internationally throughout the world throughour laboratories to diagnose or find out what is causing this outbreak.AND EVEN IF ANTIBIOTICS ARE NOT WORKING, MOST OF THELARGER CITIES AND HOSPITALS HAVE RESPIRATORS THAT HAVEPROVEN TO BE VERY HELPFUL?That's correct. Hospital supportive treatment, including respirators if necessary,is the best possible treatment.COULD THIS OUTBREAK, COMING AT EXACTLY THIS PERIOD OFFEBRUARY TO MARCH, BE ONE OF SADDAM HUSSEIN'S OR ALQAEDA'S EXPERIMENTS WITH BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS?We have no evidence that this is a deliberately caused epidemic. Once we findthe organism, we'll be able better to determine where this outbreak might havecome from; in other words, how it became established. But at present, there isno evidence this is a deliberately caused outbreak or bioterrorism.\"If microbiologists could identify the pathogen, then tests for the disease - andpossibly a vaccine could be developed. But so far the culprit's definite identityhas not been proved. But electron microscope research is narrowing in on afamily of viruses known as Paramyxo. Professor John Tam in the Department ofMicrobiology at China University, reported this week that he had foundParamyxo virus in both blood and tissue of a SARS patient.There are hundreds of Paramyxo viruses with varying degrees of danger for bothanimals and humans. The same Paramyxo virus that causes measles in people,causes deadly distemper in dogs. Other examples of Paramyxo human diseasesare mumps and croup in children.I asked CDC's Chief of Respiratory and Enteric Viruses, Dr. Larry Anderson,about SARS being a Paramyxo virus that might spread through the air likemeasles. Is SARS Transmission Airborne?Larry Anderson, M. D., Chief, Respiratory and Enteric Viruses Branch,Centers for Disease Control, Atlanta, Georgia: \"That's certainly possible.Some of the Paramyxo viruses of course, measles is very efficient intransmitting. But I don't think it's going to be that's more of the small particleairborne transmission. But the other Paramyxo viruses, respiratory S. virus,Parainfluenza virus and the human metanuma virus recently discovered, arepretty efficient transmitters. What this means, we don't know, but that iscertainly one of the possibilities, that it would spread more widely. We don'tknow yet.There are two laboratories that have identified one in Germany and then Dr.Tam's lab in Hong Kong that have identified by electron microscopy andspecimens particles that are consistent with the Paramyxo virus particle. And it'sreported in one of the Hong Kong newspapers that Dr. Tam has also identified"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"genetic material suggestive of a Paramyxo virus. I think that is a veryencouraging finding and I think as in discussions with W. H. O. and Dr. Tam andothers, it's an encouraging finding, but we're not at least not in last discussionswe've had it's not yet been demonstrated for certain that it's the cause of theoutbreak.I TALKED WITH DR. GLEAZEN WHO IS PROFESSOR OF VIROLOGYAND MICROBIOLOGY TODAY?Ye s .HE SAID THAT HE DID NOT UNDERSTAND CDC'S PARTICULAR FOCUSON JUST THE CLOSE CONTACT OF FLUIDS WHEN IT SEEMED FROMWHAT HE WAS READING THAT THERE WERE CLEAR INDICATIONSTHAT PEOPLE IN THE HOTEL, FOR EXAMPLE, SOMEBODY IN A HOTELWHERE THERE WERE MORE THAN HALF A DOZEN PEOPLE CAMEDOWN WITH THE SAME SYNDROME THAT IT SUGGESTED AIRCONTACT.Well, I think I'm sure he's talking about the hotel in Hong Kong.THAT'S RIGHT. (Metropole)They were all on one floor of the hotel. We know that a couple of the peoplehad fairly close contact. We don't, I don't know more than that, so I can't reallyexplain it. What I can say is that what I've been told is that workers in the hoteldid not come down with the illness and people on other floors on the hotel didnot come down with the illness.There are two ways to look at it. I think the fact that workers in the hotel did notcome down with the illness and people on other floors did not come down,suggests that just casual contact was not enough to cause transmission.DO YOU HAVE ANY WORRIES THAT THIS IS A MICROBE THAT COULDEND UP CAUSING A PANDEMIC LIKE THE 1918 SWINE FLU?It doesn't transmit like that. I don't think that's what we're dealing with. I mean,it's not going to be a pandemic like 1918 swine flu which spread very rapidly.Where it's going to go in terms of further spread, we don't know. It doesn'tappear to have, at least so far, spread into the community and caused largeamounts of community-acquired respiratory disease, so far in the communities ofHong Kong, Hanoi and Singapore, where it has been to some extent so far.Now whether it's a new human pathogen that might be animal-to-humantransmitted virus, nobody knows. What we're seeing is, seems to be differentthan what we've seen before.\" A New Virus Spread from Animal to Human?Hong Kong has worried about avian influenza which recently infected a familyand the father and daughter died. That's a bird to human microbe. What if thereis a new Paramyxo virus, perhaps even one that originated in animals such asbats or pigs, and has now mutated to infect humans?I asked that question this week of Paul Glezen, M. D., Professor of MolecularVirology and Microbiology and Pediatrics and Epidemiologist for the InfluenzaResearch Center at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas.Paul Glezen, M. D., Professor of Molecular Virology and Microbiology andPediatrics and Epidemiologist for the Influenza Research Center at BaylorCollege of Medicine in Houston, Texas: \"I think there is a very good possibilityof that. We're obviously we are speculating based on limited information, but weknow that the laboratories that have looked for this were laboratories thatshould have been able to identify the usual human Paramyxo viruses. So, if itwas Parainfluenza 1, 2 or 3 or whatever, they should have identified that right"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"away. And the fact that they could not isolate or identify this with the PCR orwhatever, means that it is probably a new virus. So, that's why you have to beconcerned because if it had been one of the usual Paramyxo viruses thatcommonly cause upper respiratory illness in adults. They cause bad croup andpneumonia in little kids, but usually by the time we are adults, we don't get badillness. So, we don't expect a healthy adult to get a fulminating pneumonia froma Parainfluenza 1, 2, or 3.So, that's the way I look at it. I'm trusting the expertise of these labs, which weare told are all good labs. And I know that Hong Kong, since 1997, they havereally been tooling up their virus diagnosis and everything. I think the labs inHong Kong would have been right on top of this and if it had been one of theusual Paramyxo viruses, we would know it.THE FACT THAT IT MAY BE NEW IS WHY IT COULD BE SO VIRULENTAND THAT WE MIGHT BE FACING A PANDEMIC?I wouldn't call it a pandemic, but we could be facing another new respiratoryvirus pathogen which and since it had not circulated in the human populationbefore, it would mean the adults are as susceptible as young children are to theones we see commonly in humans.DR. HEYMANN IN GENEVA TOLD ME THIS WEEK THAT WHATSURPRISED HIM AND OTHERS IN THE WORLD HEALTHORGANIZATION IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SO MANY PEOPLENEEDING RESPIRATORY VENTILATOR ASSISTANCE.Right. That is very alarming. Now, the other thing that Dr. Anderson mentionedyesterday (CDC) is another Paramyxo virus that was discovered and it definitelywas an animal reservoir infecting humans. But up to now, those viruses had notspread from human to human, at least not that we can readily see.So, there was the Hindra virus first in Australia that people taking care of a sickhorse contracted and I think there were a couple of deaths, but only threehumans infected. Then they found this new Paramyxo virus. The source of thiseventually was determined to be fruit bats who infected the horse and thehumans got infected from this sick horse.Then in Malaysia, there was a report of an encephalitis disease in pig farmersand they of course first suspected Japanese B encephalitis, but couldn't find that.But they shipped their pigs to Singapore and then there was an outbreak in anabattoir in Singapore among the people who were butchering the pigs. Again, alot of these were encephalitis which is alarming.But it said I just reviewed the report they did have evidence of infiltrates in theirlung, too, like they had pneumonia.THIS WAS DEFINITELY LINKED TO A NEW PARAMYXO VIRUS?Yes. And this was called the Nippah virus, and it is closely related to the Hendraviru s.SO THESE TWO PRIOR INCIDENTS, NOW COMING TO FEBRUARY ANDMARCH OF 2003, DOES IT MEAN TO YOU AS A VIROLOGIST THATTHOSE TWO PARAMYXO VIRUSES THAT ERUPTED NEW FROMANIMAL TO HUMAN, THERE COULD HAVE BEEN YET ANOTHERVARIATION, THERE IS ANOTHER NEW PARAMYXO VIRUS IN THIS SARSSYNDROME?Right, either that. Or maybe one of these viruses (Hendra or Nippah) had amutation that now allows it to spread among humans.So this group of viruses are pretty interesting in the anatomic areas of the lungsthat they attack. But basically what we are talking about here (with SARS) thatcan occur with any of the Paramyxo viruses is interstitial pneumonitis and whathappens there is that you get inflammation in the lining of the alveoli so that the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"cells and fluid enters between the membranes of the alveoli and impairs theability to exchange oxygen just by mechanical obstruction there.So an interstitial pneumonia is probably what they are describing and then howextensive this is depends on how disabled the person is. Of course, if there issufficient interstitial involvement, then they are going to have to go on aventilator and need high concentrations of oxygen and everything to get themthrough it. And hopefully they will make it, but some of them won't.WHICH IS WHAT HAS BEEN HAPPENING AND IT IS BECAUSE THISSARS SYNDROME IS ATTACKING THE ALVEOLI INTERSTITIAL AREAAND THAT IS APPARENTLY WHY SO MANY PEOPLE ARE ENDING UPON VENTILATORS.Right, and this is different than a bacterial pneumonia where instead of justbeing an interstitial infiltration, you'll just have the alveoli full of pus. So,bacterial pneumonia will just generate pus that will fill the airways and alveoliand it is usually localized to just one area of the lung, fortunately.But the viral interstitial pneumonias tend to be pretty generalized in the lungand if they are extensive enough, then patients go into respiratory failure andone of the terms they (SARS investigators) have used is \"adult respiratorydistress syndrome.\" That's really lung failure, respiratory failure, when they haveto go on a ventilator to save them.RIGHT NOW, DR. HEYMANN THINKS, BASED ON THE EXPERIENCE SOFAR, THAT THEY CAN CONTAIN PATIENTS AWAY FROM THE GENERALPOPULATION AND AS LONG AS HEALTH WORKERS ARE WEARINGMASKS, THAT THEY CAN CONTAIN THE SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE.WHAT WOULD YOUR COMMENT BE?Well, ideally you need isolation rooms with negative pressure so that when youopen the door, air flows into the room and then it is exhausted out throughfilters. That's ideally what you need for isolation for airborne infections.Now, we can handle a few of these, but if this became an epidemic, you can seethat we would very quickly run out of good isolation rooms for these patients.That's a problem and it's one we need to think about, whether it is an influenzapandemic or a new agent like this, or whatever. Ore a bioterrorist attack wherewe need to isolate patients with smallpox, for instance. We don't have enoughfacilities right now to handle real epidemics of these. But if they are in limitednumbers, we can handle them well.Again, this goes back to pandemic preparedness and all this other stuff bioterrorism alert and all this stuff. We need to have the ability to sort out thesediseases and we need to do it quickly because it is not sufficient to say we havean outbreak of influenza-like illness that closes all the schools in Texas, whichwe've had this winter. If you're not able to go right in and identify the agent andsay, 'This is just influenza B, Victoria lineage. We don't need to worry about it.'Or is it some new agent? A new virus or some other new agent circulating?So, I think those tests are available, but they are not distributed strategically toallow us to make rapid decisions and conclusions and that's what we need.\"We b s it e s :http://www.who.int/en/ (World Health Organization)http://www.cdc.gov/ (Centers for Disease Control)Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"earthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
