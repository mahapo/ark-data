January 23, 2003 Miami, Florida, Broward County - Ye s t e r d a y , i n aBroward County, Florida courtroom under the gavel of Circuit Judge JohnFusciante, three lawyers, several state welfare agents and reporters from variouscountries gathered for an arraignment on the issue: is a cloned human baby anabused child?Coral Gables attorney, Bernard F. Siegel, first filed the lawsuit against thecompany, Clonaid, after Clonaid's Chief Executive Officer and chemist, BrigitteBoisselier, Ph.D., assembled a December 27th press conference in Miami toannounce the alleged birth of the first human clone. Since that date, Clonaid hasannounced that a second cloned baby was born and a third is due, but no DNAmedical proof has been provided to bolster the claims. Then Mr. Siegel resignedfrom his law firm, Aronson & Associates, so that I could direct all my efforts tothis lawsuit. I'm back as I have been for most of my 28 years of law practice. Iam now the law offices of Bernard F. Siegel.\"Attorney Bernie Siegel handed a subpoena to Clonaid's Vice President, ThomasKaenzig, on January 11, 2003, when Kaenzig was a keynote speaker at a MoneyWorld 2003 Conference in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. The subpoena orderedKaenzig to appear via telephone under oath at the January 22 arraignment toanswer questions about the location and wellbeing of the alleged cloned babywhose parents are Florida residents.But on January 21, 2003, in a last minute move to block the subpoena, Clonaidlawyers argued before the court that Kaenzig was based in Las Vegas, thatClonaid was not a registered company anywhere in the United States, that hehad no \"pertinent information\" about the cloned child, and therefore, theBroward County court had no jurisdictional right to compel a Clonaid officer toappear. But the judge ruled against Clonaid and the arraignment went forward asscheduled on January 22. By a telephone speaker that could be heard in thecourtroom, Judge Fusciante asked questions and listened to the responses ofThomas Kaenzig.Interview:Bernard F. Siegel, Attorney, Broward County, Coral Gables, Florida: \"It"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"didn't seem like there was a lot of information that he gave. He mainly pointedhis finger at his superior at Clonaid, Dr. Brigitte Boisselier, as having knowledgeabout the child, the cloning, the set up of Clonaid. Clonaid, he testified, is notregistered in any state of the United States. There wasn't very much informationthat he gave.The judge, Circuit Judge John Frusciante, directed him to appear inFlorida next week for a deposition.WHAT DATE?That is yet to be determined. I have to work that out with Clonaid, Clonaid'slawyers and Mr. Kaenzig's lawyers, but he also has to appear in court nextWednesday, January 29, 2003, so the matters that were started yesterday will becontinued.CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHAT MATTERS WERE COVERED IN SOMEDETAIL?This is really a unique case on first impression. We've never had allegations of acloned human being and a cloning company, as I assert, that has ties to BrowardCounty, Florida. I subpoenaed Mr. Kaenzig when he was at a MoneyConference (here) to attend a hearing. The judge, I think on a preliminary basisas he has a perfect right to do, made some direct inquiries to determine whatanyone especially the witness might know about a child that may be secretive, achild that might be in danger in any way or might have a substantial risk ofharm. The judge took it upon himself to ask about 90% of the questions aboutMr. Kaenzig and his knowledge of this. After all, he purports to be the numbertwo man in this organization called Clonaid.SO HE SHOULD KNOW WHERE THE CLONAID OFFICES ARE BASED?He is the number two man - what can I say? From my standpoint as thepetitioner in the case, I am trying to find out the whereabouts of the child so thechild can have some protection. Perhaps Clonaid will come in and have theequivalent of the Columbia Presbyterian Hospital and everything is going to befine with the child. Even though they have never cloned a chimpanzee orprimate, and nearly all animal cloning fails, maybe they've perfected a gem thefirst time and this child has nothing to worry about. And all the NationalAcademy of Sciences studies and all the medical association studies and twopresidential commissions are wrong. Maybe there are no substantial risks of ahandicapped child if a cloning experiment is done today.Maybe they (Clonaid) will have the opportunity to present that if they can comein from the cold. This is their opportunity to do that and satisfy the concerns atleast my concerns and hopefully the concerns of a Florida judge and perhaps theconcerns of the world. I don't know. But they are going to have the opportunityto appear in court.YOU HAVE FOCUSED IN BROWARD COUNTY BECAUSE OF CLONAIDACTIVITY THERE?Yes. I don't know if the child really exists. What I do know is that Clonaidpersists in coming to Broward County. They could have picked anywhere in theentire world and they picked Broward County to have their press conferenceannouncing this. They could have picked anywhere in the world, but Mr.Kaenzig appeared on January 11 to give the keynote address at a Money Worldconference where there were venture capitalists to talk about Clonaid. That'swhere he got served with a subpoena. So, if they are going to persist and makeBroward County their nest to do business, it seems to me that some place needsto take jurisdiction and some one should put a Clonaid official under oath justto try to get to the bottom of it.DID HE (KAENZIG) MAKE ANY COMMENT WHATSOEVER ON THESTATUS OF THE CHILD, OR EVEN SUGGEST WHERE THE PARENTSAND CHILD MIGHT BE?It seemed to me that he was saying that he didn't know. But I also heard I want"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"to review the transcript carefully of the hearing that he testified that there was achild. He sort of pointed a finger at Dr. Boisselier to answer these questions andperhaps she will have an opportunity to come to court. It remains to be seen.SO FAR, SHE HAS NOT BEEN SERVED WITH A SUBPOENA BECAUSEYOU HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO LOCATE HER?That's correct. It was a little difficult with Mr. Kaenzig's vagueness yesterday tobe able to ascertain even what continent she was on, although I think he finallysaid she was in Canada at least for today. I heard that she is going to be giving apress conference today about the birth of yet another cloned child. So, whoknows? All I know, as a Florida lawyer, I've tried to do what I can to shed somelight on this.THE QUESTION BEFORE THE COURT: SHOULD A CLONED BABY BEDEFINED AS AN ABUSED CHILD BASED ON MEDICAL INFORMATIONTHAT THERE CAN BE A LOT OF MEDICAL PROBLEMS IN CLONING HOW HAS THAT PROCEEDED SO FAR IN THIS BROWARD COUNTYCOURT?I think in order to climb Mt. Everest, you have to take the first step. I think thefirst thing the Florida court is wrestling with is jurisdictional issues. That's goingto be up to the judge to determine. I can only present what I have one step at atime. But the first step was taken when we went to the court yesterday at thearraignment. I am pleased Mr. Kaenzig will be coming to Florida and will haveto submit to further questioning. I think that's an important first step.IS THERE ANYTHING THAT THE BROWARD COUNTY JUDGE CAN DOIN TERMS OF REACHING OUT TO BRIGITTE BOISSELIER ANDGETTING HER THERE?I don't want to comment on that.THE FRUSTRATION IS THAT YOU HAVE A VALID ISSUE TO BRINGBEFORE COURT. BUT THE ONE PERSON WHO APPARENTLY HOLDSALL THE ANSWERS, BRIGITTE BOISSELIER, IS NOT GOING TO BEFORTHCOMING PHYSICALLY OR ANY OTHER WAY?As I said in court, it seems like they have all the cards. I, as the petitioner, amtrying to do a diligent search and get this information and that we have to startsomewhere and Mr. Kaenzig was served a subpoena and the judge has orderedhim to physically be in the courtroom on January 29, 2003.WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT CLONAID MAKING PRESSANNOUNCEMENTS THAT THEY ARE CLONING WITHOUT ANYBODYEVER SEEING ANY PROOF?I read some commentary or heard on television, 'Clonaid is giving birth toanother press release.' I don't know what to make of it. I can only do what I cando here and know they are persisting in saying they are cloning people and, if infact they are, it's my personal belief that at this stage of science, it's child abuse.It would be terrible. There is no consent that a child can sign. Just because theremight be science to do it, that doesn't mean you have the right to create a humanbeing that is maimed or handicapped. It's unethical. It even arises as a dangerousmedical experiment which is what the Nuremberg Code of 1947 was written toprohibit. It's a very, very serious matter and cloning is no joke.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of this"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"screen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
