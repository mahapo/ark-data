His work has appeared in MilitaryIllustrated, Eye-Spy, UFO Magazine and the London Daily Express. He is theauthor of four books: A Covert Agenda © 1997, The FBI Files © 1998, CosmicCrashes © 2000 and Strange Secrets, Real Government Files on the Unknown,co-authored with Andy Roberts © 2003.In the Foreword of the latest book, Strange Secrets, Redfern wrote: \"It shouldbe noted that the nature of intelligence work requires agencies to obtaininformation on just about anything and everything that might conceivably have abearing on national security. Therefore, it is really not at all surprising thatdocumentation on 'the unknown' has been created and studied at an officiallevel.\"But for years, the official files on these and other mysteries were tightly heldunder the strictest security. With the passing of legislation such as the U. S.government's Freedom of Information Act in the 1970s and the more recentBritish government's Thirty Year Ruling, that security blanket has, to a degree atleast, begun to ease - to the extent that we can now safely say that 'the truth isindeed out there.'\"In the process of filing for access to American and British documents concerningthe UFO phenomenon and spending a lot of time in the British Public RecordOffice outside London, Nick Redfern has discovered evidence of both real crashretrievals of unidentified vehicles in England and disinformation by governmentand military officials which imply a psychological warfare operation that hasbeen going on for at least half a century and which muddies the water foranyone trying to see clear facts about an alleged non-human interaction withEarth life.This week I talked with Nick about what he considers to be one of the hardestfactual cases of a UFO crash retrieval in Great Britain.England's Public Record Office outside London, similar to the United StatesNational Archives in Washington, D.

The genesis of this case goes back to Leonard Stringfieldand in his July 1991 UFO Crash/Retrievals: The Inner Sanctum, Status ReportVI the biggest one he ever wrote. He included details of an alleged UFO crash inEngland in 1964 in an area near Penkridge, Staffordshire, which is an area of theCannock Chase which is a huge forest in Staffordshire, England, which extendsfor miles and miles. In his report, Stringfield talks about how he was contactedby a source who knew about a crashed UFO incident in this Staffordshire forestin early 1964.Pages 72-73, UFO Crash/Retrievals: The Inner Sanctum, Status Report VIby Leonard H. StringfieldJuly 1991\"OVER THERE\"Some time in 1964, \"somewhere at sea,\" between the Caribbean and theAtlantic, a specially rigged LST, a flagship (AKA, \"spy ship\") for a navalamphibious force, received a coded radio message in its \"crypto-machine\"room, which reported that \"artifacts\" had been retrieved with three deadpersonnel. According to my informant, former Third Class Petty Officer, S. M.Brannigan (pseudonym) who was a specialist trained to translateintercepted Russian transmissions, the decoded report stated that a UFOhad crashed in two parts: the main section near Penkridge in Staffordshire,England; and the remains in West Germany. He further stated that theretrievals of the parts and the occupants were conducted by Air ForceIntelligence and shipped to Wright-Patterson AFB. He added that U. S.and other NATO interceptors were involved. Brannigan admitted there wasmore to the incident, involving coded information, that he preferred tokeep confidential. The Brannigan disclosure, while sketchy, might spotlight only the tip ofthe iceberg as to the scope of military crash/retrieval operations in foreignlands. Researchers know that reports of crashes are worldwide, from poleto pole, on every continent, and in many countries even in remoteMadagascar. If such incidents are to be secreted, it is my suspicion that U.S. special retrieval teams have been, and still are, prepared to \"go intoaction\" into any crash location within its sphere of military or economicinfluence such as was exercised with NATO in the \"artifact\" retrievals inEngland and West Germany.\"Penkridge, Staffordshire, England, near the center of Great Britain.Several years ago I looked into this case when I was still living back in Englandaround 1995 to 1996. Myself and a colleague began looking into the case andput adverts in local newspapers to see if anyone from the time recalled theincident. Several people came forward talking about how they recalled militaryroadblocks in the area and people being diverted out of the site where some sortof incident had taken place."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The most important eyewitness of all was a man named Harold South, who wasworking in the area at the time. He told us he witnessed the recovery of somesort of small triangular-shaped object that was loaded aboard a militarytransport vehicle and was taken out of the area. He also told us that shortlyafterward, he was contacted in his home by the military and local police and hadhis camera confiscated. He had actually covertly photographed this object beingrecovered from the forest. He said his camera was confiscated which he later gotback in the mail, but the pictures were never returned to him.This was one of these typical crash retrieval accounts that we hear on numerousoccasions. What kind of set this one apart for me and convinced me there was agreat deal more to it was the fact that when I and my colleague went to interviewhim at this house in December 1996, he was kind of perturbed and upset whenwe arrived. We asked him what was wrong. He said that in between us speakingwith him on the telephone before leaving my house in the morning and arrivinghis house, he had received a weird phone call from somebody identifyingthemselves as working for the Ministry of Defence suggesting that he not talk tous.Now this guy has no particular interest in the UFO subject. He's now about 73,elderly and retired, and lives in a small apartment in central England. We kindof looked at each other and asked: Is this genuine or a fantasist? In England, youhave something called a 1471 telephone system kind of similar to the Stateswhere you can dial and it will give you the number of the last person whotelephoned in. So, what we did is ask him, 'Can we dial 1471?' He said, 'Yes.'We did that and lo' and behold, we got a number which was an internal BritishArmy telephone number at a place called Whittington Army Barracks in CentralEngland. We traced the call back to a division called the Ministry of DefenceGuard Service and we were able to confirm that the call had been made to hishome at the time in question from the MOD Guard Service. When we tracked itdown to the internal department and got through to them, they wouldn't speakto us. But we were able to confirm at least that a call had been made. This kindof begs the question: what would be so important about the recovery of somesort of object in a Staffordshire field 40 years ago that today is requiring theMOD and the military to keep under surveillance the key witness to the case?That's the only time I've really been blown away by the fact that a 70-year-oldwitness seemed to be kept under some sort of surveillance for more than 40years to the extent where within 10 minutes of us telephoning him, he received acall suggesting that he not talk about this case. And he described the object as astrange triangular-shaped thing which did not have any markings, was kind of adull grey color, and seemed to be built out of one piece of formed metal withoutwings, without markings or anything like that at all. That case convinced memore than any other that there have been unusual recoveries within the U. K. ofsome sort of object. British Technical and Scientific Intelligence BranchInterested in Human AbducteesWHAT IS THE VERY STRANGEST THING YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD, EVENIF YOU COULD NOT VERIFY IT?I guess the strangest thing I've ever been told does not relate directly to crashedUFOs but I was told that there is a department within the Technical andScientific Intelligence Branch of the MOD that had an interest in so-called UFOabductees. Apparently some paper or report had been put together. I'm not sureif this was an official report or put together by people within the technicaldivision that had a personal interest. But nonetheless, it was co-authored bythree or four people from within the TSIB and it dealt with fears or concerns ontheir part that a number of abductees if not all abductees have been kind ofpre-programmed for some sort of future event that will involve a worldwide"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"catastrophe on the Earth like a nuclear exchange, or something like that.But afterward in the ruins of the planet, these people would have some specifictask to perform on behalf of someone else. The fact they had been lined up tocarry out this role concerned the Technical Intelligence people that this sort ofnuclear holocaust was inevitable, preplanned and that these survivors wouldhave some sort of role to play afterward. The whole angle was: if we canunderstand why these people will be involved, perhaps we can understand whythis nuclear exchange is going to occur.So it's going to be some sort of Judgment Day type event in the near futureinvolving UFOs and that alien abductees are somehow going to be involved inthe aftermath of reconstruction or whatever happens to the planet afterwards.IF ANY OF THAT WERE TRUE, THEN GOVERNMENTS WOULD NOTWANT ANY OF THIS TO COME OUT UNTIL THE VERY END BECAUSETHEY WOULD HAVE THE PROBLEM OF CONTROLLING SOCIAL ANDPOLITICAL INSTITUTIONS.Yes, I think that is the case. And unfortunately in England, the wholegovernment exists under this veil of secrecy and keeping information classified isvery easy.. I'll give you a good example: back in 1980, I tried to access files ofthe British Air Ministry's old Scientific and Technical Division (STD) from thelate 1940s. Although some files have been declassified in recent years, in 1990 Iwas told on the record in a letter from the Public Record Office which is theBritish equivalent of the American National Archives that some of the STD fileshave been classified for up to 100 years.There were no legislation back then to appeal the release of this material. It willbe sitting on the shelf for 100 years and then whoever is around at that time candetermine if it can be declassified. This goes to show that government secrecy isendemic and can be put into place very easily.Over the last few years, there have been Freedom of Information legislation inEngland and a number of files have surfaced from later years such as one file onthe Rendlesham Forest case of December 1980, as well as the 1970s and 1960s.Contained within those files, there are quite a few reports of UFO encounterssubmitted by military pilots, airline pilots, radar operators. Significantly, this issomething that will interest you even though it veers from the UFO crash angle.Crop Circles in Early 1940sA number of crop circle reports have surfaced, historical ones, contained withinthe official files. I talk about some of these files in Strange Secrets. The earliestones I've been able to document officially date from the early 1940s whenBritain's MI5 (FBI equivalent in U. S.) began receiving reports of strange cropformations found in mainland Europe at the height of the Second World War.The initial thought was that these were some kind of coded ground markings forGerman pilots informing them where to bomb, encoded messages. But thistheory was not born out upon investigation. It's kind of left unknown beyond thefact that these weird formations were found in European fields. Nobody knewwhat they were. I guess the important point is that because these files had beendeclassified officially and could be verified as being genuine and from the timeperiod in question we know these predate the modern day interest in crop circlesand I guess the idea that somebody would go hoax crop circles in war tornEurope when bombs were dropping in those areas, defies belief.WERE THERE ANY PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE CROP FORMATIONS IN THEEARLY 1940S?There are references to photographs, but they aren't in the files. What is in thefiles are photographs of some British formations which turned out to haveprosaic explanations where farmers had been driving tractors around a field. ButBritish aircraft have been ordered to fly over mainland England and report anyformations that have been seen in England and they reported back having found"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"several different formations in the south of England. British agents would go outand interview the farmers, but most of these came down to an explanation.But this goes to show that British intelligence was taking an interest in strangecrop formations to the extent that they actually sent agents out to the homes andasked farmers if people made the formations for themselves and what does itmean? Or was it just that you were raking the corn? Or something else? That waskind of an eye-opening fact that surfaced directly as a result of the Freedom ofInformation legislation in England.One other case of a similar nature from 1964 that I found in the MOD files was astraightforward circle found on farm land in the north of England. The nightprior to the formation having been found, the key witness reported seeing thisstrange column like electric blue light hovering above the field. Then the nextday, he went down to see if anything was there and here was this big circle. Thiswas 1964, 40 years ago, and again, shows that long before the modern dayinterest in crop circles surfaced, the MOD had quite a few records of this naturealready on file.\"March 23, 1964 letter from T. R. T. Burbury, Rector, Clifton Rectory,Pearith, Cumberland, England to Scientific and Industrial Research, London, concerningblue light and grass circle. Letter provided by Nick Redfern from his research in BritishPublic Record Office.More Information:1948 - First Book About UFOs Was Published in England AsA N o ve lNick Redfern: \"In 1948 in England, a book was published called, The FlyingSaucer. It is probably the first book ever published on UFOs, but it is actually anovel written by a man named Bernard Newman. Newman for many years hadalleged links with British intelligence."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" The Flying Saucer © 1948 by Bernard Newman, published in England, is the first knownbook about thecrashed flying saucer phenomenon, even though written as a fictional novel. How couldBernard Newman,known to have links with British intelligence, have written such a book and had it publishedin lessthan a year of the alleged July 1947 crashes of \"extraterrestrial aerial vehicles\" in NewMexico?When people actually see the book, people express amazement at the content ofit because it deals with kind of a supersecret organization (MJ-12?) made of elitescientists and military people throughout the United States who staged threecrashed UFO incidents. They actually built prototype flying saucers and crashedthem. One crashes in New Mexico, interestingly enough. One in Britain and onein Russia. But these aren't extraterrestrial spacecraft. They are just mockups. Thewhole idea is to create a kind of New World order where the whole human racewill be scared by this alien threat and we'll all unite in some one worldgo vern men t .To reinforce the reality of the crashed UFOs, the scientists actually fake andstage an alien autopsy which, of course, has a lot of tie-ins with what is going ontoday with the (Ray Santilli) alien autopsy controversy. Not only that, when theUFOs crashed, to make them look more believable, they paint strangehieroglyphics on the recovered wreckage. Of course, as you know,hieroglyphics, alien autopsies that may or may not be the real thing are stapleparts of the whole UFO controversy. But the Bernard Newman book wasactually written 55 years ago and includes all these key ingredients.MAY I ASK A QUESTION HERE: IF THIS MAN BERNARD NEWMAN HADCONNECTIONS WITH COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE ON THE U.S. SIDE, ORBRITISH SIDE, OR BOTH: IS IT NOT JUST AS LOGICAL TO ASSUMETHAT THEY WERE ANTICIPATING THAT THEY HAD A PROBLEM ONTHEIR HANDS IN TERMS OF UNIDENTIFIED CRAFT AND ENTITIESINTERACTING WITH THE PLANET AND THEY WANTED VERY MUCHTO BE ABLE TO MUDDY THE WATERS AND TO PUT A BOOK OUT THATWOULD PUT ALL OF THIS IN IT MIGHT BE AN ANTICIPATION OF WHATTHEY WOULD HAVE TO BE DEALING WITH AND IF IT WERE INFICTION THEN PERHAPS IT WOULD BE DISMISSED AS GOVERNMENTCONTAMINATION?That's quite true, Linda. I think there are several ways of looking at this. Theproblem is that 55 (1948) to 56 years ago (1947), the key players in this aren'taround any more. But I think it's intriguing that whatever happened in the NewMexico desert of 1947 that in less than 12 months, Bernard Newman had abook written and published that talked about the UFO crash in the New Mexicodesert with strange hieroglyphics found on the object, followed by the creationof a faked alien autopsy to try to convince people that this is an alien spacecraft.I don't pretend to have the key answers about what really happened at Roswell"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"or elsewhere in the summer of 1947, but I think it's intriguing that 55 years afterNewman's book was published that things like Majestic-12, the alien autopsyfilm are being discussed and look back at his book and see that it contains thissupersecret organization involved in UFO incidents and alien autopsies, plus thewhole hieroglyphic issue which I think I'm correct in saying: the issue ofhieroglyphics being found on the debris at Roswell really wasn't emphasizeduntil people like Jesse Marcel Sr. and Jr. began talking about it in the 1970s and1980s. And yet, in Newman's book it was talked about as far back as 1948 whenit was published. So, that would suggest that somehow he had information thatwhatever was recovered at Roswell or in the New Mexico desert did havehieroglyphics on it.I actually have done this. I have talked with several intelligence people. And theone story which is kind of unanimous in all accounts is this: if there ever hasbeen a genuine UFO crash, then the best way to hide it is by releasing crashedUFO stories which upon investigation turn out to be bogus or questionable. Ifthere ever has been a real one, then the bogus ones cast the seeds of doubt ontothat one as well. The story that's been given to me is that the best way to hide asecret is among a whole mass of lies and disinformation.\"This 2003 book can be purchased through either:amazon.com or Paraview Pocket Books.We b s it e :http://www.paraview.com/redfern/index.htmCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
