Stringfield, July 1991, Cincinnati, Ohio. January 14, 2003 - Leonard H. Stringfield, now deceased, became interested inthe truth behind government knowledge and cover-up of unidentified flyingobjects during his work for the Intelligence Service of the 5th Air Force in theSouthwest Pacific Theater during World War II. On August 28, 1945, he wasone of twelve men flying a C-46 to Tokyo. Near Iwo Jima, three glowing objectssomewhat tear-shaped approached and flew parallel with the C-46. Suddenly,the airplane's left engine stalled and the pilot warned the crew to get ready tobail out. But the unidentified aerial objects retreated into a cloud bank anddisappeared. Immediately, the engine came back to life and the aircraftcontinued on course. No one understood what had happened or what theglowing objects were. But Len Stringfield became determined to find out more.By 1953, Stringfield was Director of Civilian Research for Interplanetary FlyingObjects (CRIFO.) He was also employed as Director of Public Relations andMarketing Services of DuBoise Chemicals, a Division of Chemed Corporationheadquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio. By the late 1970s, Stringfield wrote abouthis investigations, including a series of \"UFO Crash/Retrieval\" status reports. ByJuly 1991 in his \"Status Report VI,\" Stringfield reprinted a letter passed on tohim for consideration from another UFO and human abduction investigator,Raymond Fowler, author of The Andreasson Affair and The Watchers. Theletter was from Charlette Mann.Charlette continued in her May 6, 1991 letter:\"It happened in the Spring of 1941. About 9 to 9:30 one evening, granddadgot a telephone call from the police department, saying they had receivedreports that a plane had crashed outside of town and would he go in case"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"someone needed him. Of course he said yes. A car was sent to get him, butgrandmother said it wasn't a police car. \"After grandfather returned that night, he explained what he had seen tograndmother, my father, Guy and Uncle Wayne, but that they were neverto speak of it again as he had given his word. Grandmother said he neverdid talk about it after that.He said they drove out of town 13-15 miles or so, then parked the cars onthe side of the road and had to walk 1/4 of a mile or so into a field wherehe could see fire burning.Grandfather said it wasn't an airplane or like any craft he'd ever seen. Itwas broken and scattered all around, but one large piece was still togetherand it appeared to have a rounded shape with no edges or seams. It had avery shiny metallic finish. You could see inside one section and see whatlooked like a metal chair with a panel with many dials and gauges - no onefamiliar looking to him. He said that when he got there, men were alreadysifting through things. There were some police officers, plain clothespeople and military men. \"There were three bodies, not human, that had been taken from thewreckage and laid on the ground. Grandfather said prayers over them so hegot a close look but didn't touch them. He didn't know what had killedthem because they didn't appear to have any injuries and they weren'tburnt. It was hard for him to tell if they had on suits or if it was their skin,but they were covered head to foot in what looked like wrinkled aluminumfoil. He could see no hair on the bodies and they had no ears. They weresmall framed like a child about 4 feet tall, but had larger heads and longerarms. They had very large oval shaped eyes, no noses - just holes - and nolips, just small slits for mouths. There were several people with camerastaking pictures of everything. Two of the plain clothes men picked up oneof the little men, held it under its arms. A picture was taken. That was thepicture I later saw. Then, one of the military officers talked to granddadand told him he was not to talk about or repeat anything that had takenplace for security reasons and so as not to alarm the people. Granddadreturned home, told his family. That was it. About two weeks after ithappened, he came home with a picture of the two men holding the littleman.After my grandfather died, my Dad kept the picture and was very interestedin UFO info. Then when I was 10 or 11, a close friend of my Dad's asked ifhe could borrow it to show to his folks, so Dad let him have it and nevergo t it b ack. \"My recollection from what I saw in the picture was a small man about 4feet tall with a large head and long arms. He was thin and no bonestructure was apparent; kind of soft looking. He had no hair on his head orbody with large, oval, slightly slanted eyes, but not like an oriental fromleft to right, more up and down. He had no ears at all and no nose likeours. There appeared to be only a couple of small holes where his noseshould have been. His mouth was as if you had just cut a small straight linewhere it should have been. His skin or suit looked like crinkled-up tin foiland it covered all of him. I can't remember much about how his feet werefor some reason. I guess my attention was focused more on his face. Ibelieve he had three fingers, all quite long, but I can't be sure on this. I'vetried to draw a picture for you, but I am not good at it. I hope it will giveyou some idea of how it looked to me.\" (See Earthfiles Part 1 fordrawings.)
