The second \"Mercedes-Benz\" pattern reported around September 9, 2003,wasfound four miles east of the Seip Mound outside Bainbridge, Ohio. The third Triskelionpatternat Paint Creek in Ross County was first seen by a pilot the end of August 2003,about two miles east of the Seip Mound. October 3, 2003 Bainbridge, Ohio - Serpent Mound\"JEFF, WHEN WE TALKED LAST WEEK OF SEPTEMBER, IT WASBECOMING CLEAR THAT THERE HAS BEEN MORE MILITARY FOCUSON THE SERPENT MOUND FORMATION.Yes, I heard two stories in the past week about people who had gone to visit theLocust Grove, Adams County formation located just near the Serpent Mound.One gentleman said he was just out there on Sunday and there was a militaryhelicopter that came over and hovered over the site less than 1000 feet up andthen made several circling passes over it before it left. And I did hear kind of avague report from someone who lives in the area that they were out at theformation site where they have not been allowing visitors into the formation. Wewere only allowed out there because of our agreement with the landowners.AND WE ARE TALKING SPECIFICALLY ABOUT WHAT WE CALL THESERPENT MOUND FORMATION?Yes, the Serpent Mound formation. And this person described a van pulling upto the side of the road. A number of people in black uniforms got out and ran tothe edge of the field and crawled their way into the formation, never stood up inthe soybeans, but crawled their way out there and then turned around after someperiod of time out there and crawled back out."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"ON THEIR HAND AND KNEES?Yes, I guess. I don't know if it was military or not, but he said there was a wholeteam of adults all dressed in what looked like black uniforms who crawled theirway in and then crawled back out.WHAT DATE DID THIS OCCUR APPROXIMATELY?Mid-September.ABOUT A WEEK AFTER THE PATTERN WAS FIRST FOUND?Ye s .DELSEY HAS SEEN A HELICOPTER?Delsey Knoechelman lives on the same ridge that the Serpent Mound sits on, soshe lives less than a mile away from where the Serpent Mound formation wasand where the mounds are. She also saw the helicopter on Sunday, September21, 2003, that this other gentleman wrote about and said the helicopter cameover her house and went in the direction that the formation was. So she musthave seen the same helicopter. She also said another helicopter showed up againon Monday, September 22. I'm not sure why the delayed interest in thatparticular formation (Serpent Mound), but they seem to be ferrying people overto look at it.IT WAS AUGUST 24, 2003 WHEN DELSEY FIRST SAW THE SERPENTMOUND PATTERN. I WONDER WHY ALMOST ONE MONTH LATERANYONE IN A MILITARY CONTEXT WOULD BE GOING BACK OVERTHE SERPENT MOUND?That's a good question, but that very same time frame happened to us when wewent to investigate the one in Wisconsin where we met the military there. Thatformation came down on the 4th of July and we didn't get out there until threeweeks later. That's when we encountered the military out there. So, I'm not surewhat the delay is or why they are coming out there after the fact, but they stillseem to be interested in them like we are interested maybe.I KEEP THINKING ABOUT ANDY BUCKLEY'S CONVERSATION IN THESUMMER OF 2003 WITH AN INSIDER IN THE M.O.D. IN ENGLAND WHOSAID THAT, 'YES,' THEY WERE MONITORING AND TRACKING ANDGOING AFTER SOME SORT OF ENERGY THAT WE HAVE DESCRIBEDAS BEING MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH CROPFORMATIONS IN WHICH THE PHRASE WAS USED, '95% OF WHAT THEHELICOPTER ACTIVITY IS GOING AFTER IS INVISIBLE TO THE HUMANEYE.' COULD THE SAME THING BE HAPPENING NOW IN OHIO?I guess it could be possible. The eyewitness to the formation in Wisconsinreported not seeing any lights or whirlwinds or anything in association with theformation of the plants going down. So, whatever he is seeing, the energy beingdriven there is beyond the visible part of the spectrum. So, that could bepossible if the military has figured out a way to have get a sensor to track that orpick that energy up.IF THE MILITARY WATCHES IN INFRARED OR SOME OTHER PART OFTHE ELECTROMAGNETIC SPECTRUM, WHAT ARE THE INVISIBLEENERGIES DOING A MONTH AFTER THE PATTERN FIRST EMERGED?Yes, another good question. I will say that the helicopter that we saw inWisconsin, we got a really good look at it. In fact, we managed to possibly trackdown where it came from. It just so happens that an almost exact duplicate ofthe helicopter we saw was pictured on a website of an Air National Guard baseabout 25 miles from where that formation came down in Wisconsin. they have apretty good picture of the kind of equipment that is housed on the front of thehelicopter. It has equipment called FLIR (Forward Looking Infrared). In mylimited understanding, it's a system that detects things in the infrared spectrum."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Now, I'm not sure if it is standard equipment on military helicopters now, but itwas on the one that we saw over the formation in Wisconsin. So, perhaps theyare using that kind of technology to attract or figure out what's out there. Seip MoundANY EVIDENCE OF MILITARY INTEREST IN THE PAINT CREEKFORMATION?Not to my knowledge, yet. We didn't experience anything in this particular trip no military sightings this time around. However, I think I described last timeabout the hoaxed formation, about four miles away from the Seip Mound to theeast that we had experienced military flyovers while we were there. When weleft that hoaxed formation after surveying it, we drove to the west to go visit theSeip Mound earthworks and while we were there, we noticed that a militaryhelicopter had come up over the ridge to the north and then flew over in thedirection where the hoaxed formation was. Just about at the point where thehelicopter appeared over the ridge is almost where this new Paint Creekformation is. So, whether they could see it or not, we don't know, but they werein close proximity at the time.September 11, 2003, military helicopter that flew over the ridge near the Seip Mound inBainbridge, Ohio, when Jeffrey Wilson and his colleagues investigated the\"Mercedes-Benz\" patternthat was determined to be manmade. Photograph © 2003 by Jeffrey Wilson.We think this newly reported formation on the Paint Creek Island came downbefore the hoaxed formation did on the road off Route 50 the Mercedes-Benzsymbol. That hoax came down after this new one (Paint Creek), but nobodyseemed to know about the Paint Creek Island formation until now.SO THE IMPLICATION IS THAT YOU SAW A HELICOPTER OVER THESAME HILL IN WHICH THIS PAINT CREEK FORMATION WOULD HAVEBEEN VISIBLE ON THAT DAY THAT YOU WERE AT THE SEIP MOUNDHOAXED FORMATION INVESTIGATING, AND THE MILITARY MIGHTHAVE KNOWN ABOUT THIS PATTERN AT PAINT CREEK FOR THE PASTTWO OR THREE WEEKS.It's possible. If you look at the photograph where you can see where the golfcourse is that golf course sits on a ridge to the north of Paint Creek and that isthe ridge over which the helicopter came over while we were at the Seip Moundand just about the same vicinity. So, it's possible they could have seen PaintCreek from that perspective."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Golf course is laid out on ridge north of Paint Creek soybean formation marked by arrow.The ancient Seip Mound is two miles west beyond the golf course. Aerial photograph© 2003 by Dan Music and Jeffrey Wilson.When we flew to photograph the hoaxed Seip formation, we flew right up Route50 and we had a hard time seeing when we did that because of the haze. If itweren't hazy, there's no doubt we would have seen it at the same time. We we n tto the location of where the 'Mercedes-Benz' crop circle formation was, which islocated about four miles to the east of the Native American Seip Mound. Wehad got permission to go out into the field to investigate it.We didn't stay more than an hour and a half inside the formation because we hadalready determined pretty quickly that it was a hoax. But in that hour and a half,while we were out there, we noticed a fighter jet flew over us. But after he flewover us, he kept circling around and coming back and each successive time, heflew lower and lower. And it was directly over the formation! Not off by 100yards or 300 yards. I mean, right over the top of us. Each successive time, he gotlower and lower. He started out about maybe 5,000 feet and on his last path, hewas maybe 800 feet up. We took photographs just about every time he cameover the top of us. We kind of got maybe the idea that he was using it as anavigational marker or something because right after he flew over it, he bankedin a turn and made this big loop around and came back over us again.Military jet made seven passes, each successively lower, over Jeff Wilson and hiscolleagues on September 11, 2003, during their investigation of the 'Mercedes-Benz'hoaxed patternfour miles east of the Seip Mound near Bainbridge, Ohio. Photograph © 2003 by JeffreyWilson.We finished our work there, documented the things we needed to document andthen we walked back to the side of the road to our cars. We went up the roadand wanted to go and visit the Seip Indian mound. That was the last past thefighter jet made over the area and this time went right over the top of my car. Iwant to say that was his lowest pass. I talked to Ted Robertson this morning toget him to recollect what he saw because he was in the van behind me. Hedescribed seeing the shadow of the plane on the ground. He could actually seethe defined shadow of the plane on the ground go right overI WONDER WHAT IT IS THAT THE MILITARY IS CONCERNED ABOUT?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"That's a good question. I know there has been some speculation out there thatthis is just the local soldiers' interest in this and they are people with interest justlike you and me. So, if they are in a helicopter or lane, they are going to fly overand take a look at it. That might be part of it, but there might be more to it.Obviously, our encounter with the soldier on the ground in Wisconsin indicatedotherwise. Whether we can get confirmation on his tory to us or not, that issomething else. But it does seem that the military in the U. S. does have morethan a passing interest for whatever reason this year.\"Continued in Part 3We b s it e :http://www.cropcirclenews.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
