March 1, 2003 Corguinho, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil - Last night I learned from analytical chemist Phyllis A. Budinger of Frontier Analysis, Ltd., in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, that the blue threads in the affected Oliveira sheet are cotton and the white are polyester. The blue and white threads are woven together throughout the sheet, but there is great variability in the body imprint from what looks like burned and charred cloth right next to cloth with only slightly darker blue discoloration that also outlines the entire body print. This is especially interesting when you consider the facts that cotton decomposes, or scorches, at about 148 degrees Centigrade, or about 300 degrees Fahrenheit. But polyester threads don't melt until 500 degrees F. There are melted, gummy threads intricately woven throughout the blue cotton threads - even in places where the cotton is not scorched, or even brown, as indicated by the white arrow in the photograph below.

Photographs © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe Close-up of the affected cotton sheet where Urandir Oliveira's right leg shows more scorching than the left leg,, as did the right side of the body print in general. Further, the energy that interacted with the sheet was \"very precise and compartmentalized,\" according to biophysicist W. C. Levengood, who talked to me yesterday about his preliminary examination of the samples I brought back from Brazil. Sampling process on February 9, 2003, where I measured and removed sections from the body print along with normal controls from the sheet, pillow and ceiling. Photograph © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe.

Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, Grass Lake, Michigan: \"I've never seen anything like this. This takes a very, very high precision kind of energy, probably at the molecular level, to transform this because it changed the internal energy of the material. Whatever the energy was, it was extremely precise. I ran on to one region right at the edge of the brown material and the threads - you could actually see where they were white, normal threads, and then just a fraction of a millimeter away, they had begun to be transformed. They were glassy-looking, but you could still see the individual fibers inside. Then in another half millimeter, they were totally homogeneous into this opalescent material. So, that transition is very precise and you could see the line of demarcation if you had the incident light just at the right angle on the sample, you can see this band of change. So, the energy here is very, very precise. I measured the weight per unit area of a control sample. The weight of the control cloth is 17 milligrams per square centimeter. The blue region is 24% higher in weight than the control cloth. I don't think anything was added. It means the energy has changed the density of the polyethylene and to change density means you have to change the molecular structure . There is some incredible technology here. On the mattress cover which is all polyester, there is a section of six vertical fibers which are normal and crossed by three horizontal fibers. In the middle of the horizontal threads, there is one single thread at the mid-point which is melted and none of the fibers on either side are melted, horizontally or vertically. The diameter of that single melted vertical thread is 0.5 millimeters which is a bit wider than the .44 millimeters measured in the normal polyester fibers. That increase in diameter is found only in the melted threads, probably due to surface tension effects. In my examination of the bed sheet Sample 2 (left leg), the melted (vitreous) threads were applied in one area as very uniform, precise \"ribbons.\" But, a centimeter away the melted threads were very irregular and drawn out into spiral shapes and \"neck-down\" affect like a water drop. This occurs when a viscous liquid like a molten glass thread is pulled, you get a \"neck down\" region from thermal effects and as it cools it hardens that way.\" In Part 5 of this series from my research in Corguinho, Brazil, farmer Tulio Costa describes a November 24, 2001 light that moved above his land, \"exploded without sound,\" broke a tree in two, blinded two calves and killed three others and a cow.
