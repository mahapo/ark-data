The formation below was discovered a few days ago, but Peter and his partner, Ulrich Kox, were not able to get an aerial of it because the field is inside the military air exclusion zone at Upavon. But finally, Ulrich and his pilot were able to obtain a special permit to fly in a micro light airplane over the area for five minutes only and photographed with Peter Sorensen's digital video camera.
