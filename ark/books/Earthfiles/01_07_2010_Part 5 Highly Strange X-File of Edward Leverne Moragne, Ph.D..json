Holt, Aerospace Engineer R eturn to Part 1 January 7, 2010 Albuquerque, New Mexico - My January 3, 2010, Earthfiles report included a letter from Alan C. Holt, President of Holt Research and Development Co. (1983 - 1986) to President Ronald Reagan with a copy to Edward L. Moragne dated March 27, 1983. After my report was posted, I received an email from Alan Holt. He has worked as an aerospace engineer since 1967, when he graduated from Iowa State University with a B. S. in physics, followed by an M. S. in physical sciences with an emphasis in astrophysics from the University of Houston's Clear Lake campus in 1969. Alan Craig Holt, now 64, grew up in Algona, Iowa, north of Des Moines and remembers reading all the science fiction books in the local library and being fascinated with space- related books and programs on television. “I grew up convinced that we could develop some transport capability based on manipulation of gravitational fields,” he told me. That conviction fueled his goal to work in aerospace and study propulsion systems. In 1983, using his own time and money, Alan Holt started Holt Research and Development Co. after many conversations with Edward Leverne Moragne about the Reagan administration's Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) and Dr. Moragne's ideas about faster- than-light propulsion. In fact, Alan Holt remembers Dr. Moragne encouraged Alan to write the letter to President Reagan for research money and contributed the last paragraph about how some seed money emerged for physicists J. Robert Oppenheimer, Albert Einstein and Edward Moragne during the Franklin Roosevelt administration. This week I contacted Alan Holt to discuss his recollections about the 1983 letter and his collaboration with Dr. Edward Leverne Moragne. Interview: Alan C. Holt, Aerospace Engineer, Houston, Texas: “I was definitely a supporter of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). I felt that it had a good opportunity to develop technologies that could be very helpful to the U. S. space program. My letter was written in the context of that particular SDI effort because that’s where the money was going at that point. WHAT WAS YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH EDWARD LEVERNE MORAGNE AT THAT TIME, WHO IS COPIED ON YOUR LETTER TO PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN? I had a friend in Houston who knew of Dr. Moragne and thought, based on my research interests, that I should talk to him. So I contacted Dr. Moragne on a personal basis and met with him. He had fascinating things to share and was interested in my research, so a friendship developed. THE LAST PARAGRAPH, WHICH I UNDERSTAND WAS WRITTEN BY DR. MORAGNE, STATES: ‘WE WOULD LIKE TO REMIND YOU OF THE WAY IN WHICH THE FIRST NUCLEAR PILE WAS FUNDED AFTER A VISIT BY DR. ROBERT OPPENHEIMER, DR. EDWARD L. MORAGNE, AND DR. ALBERT EINSTEIN – PRESIDENT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT PROVIDED A $5,000 GRANT TO START THE PROJECT. $1 TO 2 MILLION WAS REQUESTED. THIS GRANT WAS CONTINUALLY REFUNDED UNTIL THE PROJECT WAS OFF THE GROUND AND "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"WAS ABLE TO RECEIVE GREATER FUNDING SUPPORT.’ DID YOU CONFIRM TO YOUR SATISFACTION THAT DR. EDWARD MORAGNE WORKED WITH ROBERT OPPENHEIMER AND ALBERT EINSTEIN THEN AND LATER IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE MANHATTAN PROJECT AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ATOMIC BOMB? I was personally convinced, but I did not do any independent checking regarding his connections. I saw some of the same information that you received. THE PATENT? [ See: U. S. Patents, Electromagnetic Separator Click on partial Page 3 to see entire patent with illustrations.] The patent. So I took a lot of that on faith base on our friendship. I did try to check on a couple of things in his past, but I think because of his past position, it was not really possible to get any feedback. I think he was clearly involved in a lot of sensitive research over the years. I ASK BECAUSE BEYOND THE PATENT AND YOUR LETTER COPIED TO DR. MORAGNE, IF I SEARCH HIS NAME, OR VARIATIONS ON HIS NAME, I CAN’T FIND ANYTHING BUT THE PATENT. I don’t know. WHAT YEAR DID YOU MEET HIM? It had to be 1981 or 1982. I’m not sure which year. BY 1981, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LESS THAN 19 YEARS SINCE HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE BIG CRAFT COMING DOWN IN THE NEVADA DESERT, THE HUMANOID BODIES OUTSIDE ON THE GROUND AND BEING MOVED TO EDWARDS AFB. DID HE TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT INCIDENT? I don’t remember that description. He shared a lot of different things with me. It’s possible he could have mentioned that one, but I think not because I would have asked him more about all that. I did know he had interest in UFOs and advanced technologies, and we could talk about a lot of things openly in that regard. But my focus was on the physics research I was doing. DID HE EVER BRING UP NON-HUMAN EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT TECHNOLOGIES AND/OR ENTITIES? That’s something I don’t want to comment on. BECAUSE? There were a lot of things that Ed Moragne shared with me that I thought, if true, were very sensitive. Almost all the conversations we had and the information he shared with me I considered it to be sensitive. None of it I could personally confirm, but nevertheless, I felt what he was sharing was privileged information and I treated it that way. SPECIFICALLY ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES AND THEIR TECHNOLOGIES? The reason I was talking with him was about advanced technologies that had been demonstrated by what I presumed to be extraterrestrial vehicles, but I really wanted to concentrate on the physics research and experiments he had done. WHEN YOU COPIED YOUR LETTER TO PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN ON MARCH 27, 1983, YOU COPIED YOUR LETTER TO EDWARD LEVERNE MORAGNE. DID YOU COPY IT TO HIM BECAUSE HE HAD MADE PROPOSALS TO YOU ABOUT WHAT HE THOUGHT COULD BE DONE WITH ADVANCED P ROP ULSION SYSTE MS? I think he was supporting the research that I was interested in pursuing. He had conducted personal research that was significant in its own right and he saw the potential value of the path I was pursuing. ARE YOU REFERRING TO HIS STATEMENT WHEN I WAS INTERVIEWING HIM BACK IN 1997 WHEN HE SAID HE WANTED TO DEVELOP A SYSTEM THAT WOULD BE 30 TO 60 TIMES THE SPEED OF LIGHT?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The field resonance system work I was pursuing was basically a system that would bypass space and time and might effectively exceed the speed of light by at least Dr. Moragne's numbers - to some degree near instantaneous transport. DO YOU MEAN USING FIELD RESONANCE EFFECTS TO ALTER ATOMIC STRUCTURE, WHICH IS WHAT DR. MORAGNE SAID TO ME HE WAS PLANNING ON DOING IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE 30 TO 60 TIMES THE SPEED OF LIGHT. He had different methods than mine that might achieve the same result. DID YOU EVER WORK WITH DR. MORAGNE DIRECTLY IN A LAB OR ON ANY SMALL PROTOTYPES? No. We were only at the discussion stage. WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO READING MY INTERVIEW WITH DR. MORAGNE IN EARTHFILES? I was surprised and enjoyed reading your article and was glad you had a chance to interview him before he died. I was very interested in the report about the UFO landing because I didn’t recall him sharing that with me. HAD HE SHARED ANY INFORMATION WITH YOU ABOUT ANY UFO LANDINGS AND NON-HUMAN BODIES IN THE CONTEXT THAT THERE ARE ADVANCED EXTRATERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES AND INTELLIGENCES? We had discussions on that subject and I think he would agree that was the case. But we were really focused on the physics and how things worked - not only that extraterrestrials existed. DID YOU GET ANY REPLY FROM PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN’S WHITE HOUSE? I might have gotten either a form letter thanking me for my ideas. I don’t know if I have a copy because I don’t remember if I did receive any reply. It probably wouldn’t have been handled by a letter. At the time, there was a lot of research already going on in SDI (headaed by physicist Edward Teller) and I was probably one of thousands of people who had ideas to pursue and contacted the White House. So, no reply is not surprising. BUT YOU THOUGHT THAT IF DR. MORAGNE HAD WORKED WITH DR. EINSTEIN AND DR. OPPENHEIMER DURING THE PERIOD OF THE MANHATTAN PROJECT DEVELOPMENT (atomic bomb) IN LOS ALAMOS, NEW MEXICO, THAT HIS NAME REFERENCED AND COPIED IN THE LETTER WOULD HAVE CAUGHT THE ATTENTION OF PEOPLE IN THE WHITE HOUSE? I think the letter was Dr. Moragne’s idea because I would never have added that last paragraph. So at the time, I think Dr. Moragne was encouraging me to send the letter. I didn’t think it hurt for Dr. Moragne to be mentioned. But I really felt like the research had value in its own merits to warrant consideration. IN THE LAST PARAGRAPH ABOUT THE $5,000 GRANT OF SEED MONEY, IS THAT BASED ON A HISTORIC DOCUMENT? It’s just based on what Ed Moragne told me. HOW LONG AFTER MARCH 27, 1983, DID YOU CONTINUE YOUR WORKING DIALOGUE WITH EDWARD LEVERNE MORAGNE, PH.D.? I continued talking with him until 1987 when I moved up to Washington, D. C. to work on the space station program. I might have called him once or twice, but I was not as comfortable talking on the phone then. When I returned back to Houston in 1994, I renewed the friendship even though it was not as frequent as it was before. WHAT YEAR DID HE DIE? January 2000. HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT? I got a call from a person who had come into Houston to meet with him. The day she arrived, he died. Dr. Moragne’s wife wanted to get in touch with me and didn’t know how, so the other person called me. [ Editor's Note: Dr. Moragne was born in 1915, so he would have been 85-years-old at death. ]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"IN THE EARLY 1980s WHEN YOU WROTE THE LETTER, DID YOU HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT DR. MORAGNE WAS STILL IN COMMUNICATION WITH PHYSICISTS SUCH AS EDWARD TELLER OR OTHERS WORKING ON SDI? He indicated that he was still tied in and assisting in research and development reviews of different possible technologies. Yes, I think he was still connected and communicating, but I don’t know with what group specifically. WHEN YOU WROTE THE LETTER TO PRES. RONALD REAGAN WITH A COPY TO EDWARD MORAGNE, PH.D., HAD YOU AND DR. MORAGNE COME TO AN AGREEMENT THAT IF YOU DID GET SEED MONEY THAT DR. MORAGNE WOULD DO SPECIFIC WORK? No. The whole thrust of the letter was to get the White House interested in the technologies and to consider them. Of course, it was my and Ed Moragne’s desire that seed money be made available. DID DR. MORAGNE EVER SAY TO YOU, ‘ALAN, THIS IS WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO AND THIS IS HOW I WOULD DO IT’? No. Most of the information, except for the last paragraph of the letter that he wrote (I didn’t know anything about the historic seed funding), were my ideas supported by discussions with Dr. Moragne and knowing about the research he had done. So, I think he supported the ideas, but he had not independently done any research on them either. EXCEPT THAT HE TOLD ME IN 1996 THAT HE WANTED TO BUILD A PROPULSION SYSTEM THAT COULD GO 30 TO 60 TIMES THE SPEED OF LIGHT. Right. Certainly the one I was interested in getting developed would do that or better. THE LAST TIME YOU TALKED WITH DR.MORAGNE ABOUT PHYSICS WOULD HAVE BEEN WHAT YEAR? 1999. We Are Not Alone in the Universe FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE IN A CAREER HAVING TO DO WITH ADVANCED PROPULSION TECHNOLOGIES, WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR A REVELATION THAT EARTH HUMANS ARE NOT ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE, THAT THERE ARE OTHER INTELLIGENCES THAT CAN PERHAPS BEND SPACE/TIME AND MOVE IN TIME LINES? I think that’s almost a certainty. I expect that fact to eventually be part of our understanding of the universe and how it works. DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE REVEALED IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS? I don’t know. This might be something that happens in bits and pieces over a long time. Then some day, we wake up and the general discussion is that we knew all the time they were there. That’s not so strange. Or something more dramatic will happen. Every president that comes into office you hear rumors that the E. T.s will be revealed, but it never happens. WHY DO YOU THINK IT NEVER HAPPENS? I think it’s a very difficult subject. My personal opinion is that we’re not dealing with just visitors from another star system. We’re dealing with visitors that can travel through types of hyperspace. There might be beings that come from parallel realities and react with us in ways that we are not aware of. So, it’s not just the fact that we’re being visited, but the fact that there is a whole, vast multi-verse that we are not familiar with and a lot of people would have difficulty adjusting to. BUT YOU HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE ARE NOT ALONE IN THIS UNIVERSE? I have no doubt. MEANING EXTRATERRESTRIALS? Other beings as well as physics of other dimensions, consciousness and hyperspace travel. I think the universe is much stranger than we can possibly imagine.”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" C ontinued in Part 6.
