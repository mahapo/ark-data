Here begins Part 3, the end of Status Report V. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Status Report VI begins at Earthfiles 022404 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Len Stringfield continues: Case 12) Alien Humanoid Shot at Ft. Dix-McGuire AFB, 1978 McGuire AFB and Fort Dix Military Reservation near Wrightstown, New Jersey, are near the U. S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The bases are about 45 miles east of Philadelphia, 50 miles south of New York City, 60 miles north of Atlantic City and 10 miles west of the Atlantic ocean. The Fort Dix/McGuire Air Force Base/ Lakehurst Naval Air Station complex covers 42,000 acres. \"The answer to my source's question comes from still another officer allegedly on the scene in early January during a phase of significant UFO activity over the two large military compounds. During this phase, I was told one of the craft had malfunctioned and crash-landed. One survivor of the crew, lost and starving, managed to reach the outer perimeter near a guard post at Ft. Dix and was shot by an MP. Said my source, the interloper, mortally wounded, was later found dead at McGuire. Here, relying on Morse's testimony, the 'alien' was retrieved from an abandoned airstrip. The Lt. Colonel, referred to by the intelligence officer in his letter, who briefed General Sadler, had been previously identified by Morse as his Commanding Officer, whose name was made known to me. His name, rank and serial number, as well as the officers who interrogated Morse at Wright-Patterson AFB following the incident, had all been authenticated by the National Personnel Records Center in St. Louis, Missouri, in 1985. Also of interest is a letter of September 12, 1985, from the New Jersey State Police in response to a letter from Robert Bletchman, attorney in Manchester, Connecticut, asking about accessibility to their records of alleged involvement in the incident. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"New Jersey State Police Letter Dated September 12, 1985: ' ...Please be advised that it has been, and continues to be, the policy of the New Jersey State Police that the records, radio logs and other documents maintained at our stations are privileged and are to be kept confidential. We further advise that we do not consider them to be within the public domain in conjunction with general disclosure, etc...' This information should answer those in research who queried the State Police about its involvement and were told that the State Police have no such records. For me, the evidence collected over eight years of investigation into this case might not prove that UFOs are real or extraterrestrial, but it does show that such incidents, if true, would be difficult to explain to a benighted (unenlightened, kept in the dark) public. Thus, the cover-up. CASE 13) Puerto Rico UFO Crash February 19, 1984? If only I had known when I was touring San Juan in Puerto Rico on March 7, 1984, that a UFO had crashed on February 19, into the mountainous region of the El Yunque rain forest. Had I gone there, I would have found units of the military retrieval team still active. Barry Greenwood, Editor of Just Cause , first enlightened me about the crash at the MUFON Symposium in Washington, D. C., in 1987. He then had few details and I heard nothing more. Then in August 1988, Jorge Martin, Editor of Enigma, a UFO pictorial-news magazine published in Puerto Rico in Spanish, called me to relate that he had two items of significance. One concerned a possible alien underground facility on the island. The other contained new information about the 1984 UFO crash. His continuing investigations into the crash, he said, had produced new sources who had witnessed some important phases of the military retrieval operation. Through the gracious assistance of Ms. Anna Gloria Colon, MUFON State Director of Puerto Rico, Martin's records - including tapes - were translated from Spanish to English for use in this Status Report. Martin, like all Puerto Ricans, first learned of the crash in the news. Witnesses were many and most described the object as round, white, self-luminous, with a tinge of orange at its rear outer edge. Flying horizontally to the East, the object suddenly jerked and in arch fashion, went straight up, leveled, and then continued its soundless trajectory course eastward to where it was last seen crashing into the El Yunque mountains. Among the witnesses were the passengers and crew of a commercial airline flight from the Virgin Islands and a firsthand report from two men in FaJardo, who watched from their 10th floor apartment as the object was 'spinning' as it plummeted to Earth. And notably is the experience of Luis Morales, policeman, who worked out of the Rio Grande police station near El Yunque. He saw the object crash and said that when he tried to reach the area, his car suddenly went dead. Before too much suspense could be built up in the news, the story was snuffed. According to Martin, a diversionary tactic to keep everybody out of the crash area was that authorities told the police that the object was a meteorite that fell well beyond El Yunque and that investigations had been called off. Not so, said Martin, who talked with Benjamin Gascot, officer for the air rescue division operating out of Isla Grande Airport. According to Gascot, 'Something was wrong about this incident because we as a group of officials always worked together in the past.' Martin also learned from the officer that on the morning of the investigation, a mysterious helicopter painted black and without identification showed up at the site. 'The occupants,' he said, 'were dressed in military fatigues and in plain clothes.' He added, 'We were advised not to talk to the crew.' Confirmation came from another firsthand source, Michael Pazo, who operated a refueling station at the Isla Grande Airport. He, too, had seen the helicopter, identified as a Chinook, that brought in the military personnel. He further claimed that El Yunque had been under military surveillance for three weeks. Pazo also stated that the object that crashed was 'very radioactive' and that he, being a witness to the activities, was told by a federal agent named Swaggart to 'keep things quiet or else ...' Still another source, according to Martin, claimed that a second helicopter landed two days later with more personnel and that a Lear jet with NASA markings flew over the El Yunque area for two weeks. Of Martin's many sources, one working in security (unknown to me), provided him with"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"details of the on-site 'packaging' of the pieces of metal from the wreckage. Said the informant, the parts were cataloged, labeled and protectively wrapped before being boxed conforming to the exact size of each artifact. Then, the wooden boxes were sprayed with a leaded paint, followed by another coat of a chemical substance, the color of fuchsia. Still hoping to get some kind of official response to the crash, Martin said he asked Barry Greenwood to check with the FAA. Word came back from an official of its Southeast Division: no such incident took place. For Martin, it was a flat denial of everything he had heard from scores of firsthand sources. For me, it was one more case in keeping with the cover-up of all UFO crashes and retrievals and to hide the evidence at all costs. CASE 14) Norton AFB, California, 1973 John Lear, son of William Lear who invented the Lear Jet, was MUFON State Director for Nevada in September 1988. Undaunted in his pursuit of people anywhere to get UFO facts, John extensively lectured and made several radio and TV appearances in Las Vegas, Nevada, to tell his story. Listening was 'Mike,' (real name withheld on request) who surfaced in September 1988, to tell Lear his firsthand story. Admittedly troubled by his experience, Mike explained that in 1973 he had been a U.S. Air Force photographer stationed in Hawaii, following his duty in Vietnam. His prime duty in Hawaii was to process gun camera film. One day he said he was notified that his security clearance had been upgraded. Several weeks later, he and another photographer in his unit were flown on a temporary duty assignment to North AFB in California. Lear's letter to me dated November 21, 1988, recounted briefly his interview with Mike and is paraphrased as follows: John Lear Letter, November 21, 1988: 'On landing at Norton, Mike and companion were taken by air force vehicle with windows blacked out on a two hour drive. During the drive, Mike was told by the driver, 'So, you guys are going to photograph the UFO, eh?' The vehicle came to a halt on a platform which was then lowered into a large underground installation. Escorted to a briefing room, they were told that they were to photograph a flying saucer and the autopsy of three dead aliens. Ordered to disrobe, they were issued white smocks and combat boots for security purposes. Mike was then escorted into the installation where he saw a disc-shaped craft about 30 feet in diameter contained in a heavy net suspended from a large crane. Mike was boosted into the opening of the disc (no stairs or ramp) and proceeded to crawl inside. He was shocked, he said, to find that the inside looked to be about 10 times the size of the outside. He commented, 'I could have thrown a football as hard as I could and not hit the other side.' Disoriented, Mike poked his head back outside to check the size which appeared to be about 30 feet in diameter as before. Once inside, he met two persons similarly clothed in white smocks who showed him what they wanted photographed. He shot many photos of control panels and various other fixtures and later was asked to photograph the exterior from different angles and distances. He was later taken to a room in which there were three dead aliens. He described them as approximately 5 fee tall, with almost normal, human heads, except the eyes were more rounded. The skin texture was of baking dough, very white. Before the autopsy, the aliens had been dressed in blue uniforms, like flight suits. As the initial incisions were made for the (alien) autopsy, Mike saw green fluid and black innards. At this time, he became ill and called for the other photographer to continue the assignment. Later that day, they were driven back to Norton where they spent the night and were flown out the next day back to Hawaii. About two months later, Mike's companion disappeared and neither Mike nor his family have heard from him since.' Leonard Stringfield: The year 1973 brings to mind Case A-2, Status Report II (to be reprinted in future Earthfiles), where three humanoids were examined at Wright-Patterson AFB. While the head sizes described in each case differed and the body heights also differed by a foot or so, the description of the skin is strikingly similar. In Case A-2, according to the sergeant who stood guard in the underground facility, the color was 'off white or cream.' Both observers, it should be noted, were admittedly traumatized by the sight of alien bodies - which could account for visual differences of anatomical sizes and heights. CASE 15)"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Termination Orders for Insiders Who Know Too Much? For those of us in research who wonder or worry about the rigors of cover-up that's been so effective for a long time, that we have suspicion that the reason for the cover-up must be compelling. In fact, so compelling that it might explain why it is maintained at any price - even at the price of sudden death to those having sensitive information and might talk too much. Evidence of such thinking finds support in the recent disclosure of a retired police officer with 22 years of service in an Eastern state. Through the cooperation of John Ford, head of the Long Island UFO Network, I first received word on August 5, 1988, that his source had information concerning a crashed disc and the recovery of seven bodies in a western state, which in some way also involved the FBI. Filling Ford's request for a notarized statement and insuring his source's anonymity, I then received his videotaped interview with him. After viewing the tape, which firmly established the former officer's credentials, I reached him by phone for his firsthand story. It was 1973, he said, that he was joined by two FBI agents in a special 3-day training program for cadets on 'behavioral science' at the police academy. One evening after a long day's work, he and the two agents went out to dine and relax. The subject of UFOs came up. To his surprise, he said, one talked about a crashed disc in Colorado and the recovery of bodies. 'What he said next,' added my informant, 'I could tell by his body English that he was disturbed.' His concern was the means used to insure the cover-up, stating that a doctor who had been called upon in the night for urgent medical needs, died suddenly of 'cancer' three weeks later. At that point, according to my informant, he observed that the talkative agent was booted under the table by his companion. The subject was dropped and nothing was said about the FBI's role in the affair. Sudden and accidental death stories I've heard before. Never finding any substantiation, I relegated them to be a quirk of orchestrated propaganda, probably a scare tactic to intimidate potential whistle-blowers. Reports of suspicious deaths, darkly and deeply linked to UFOs, however, persist and continue to cause speculation. Word comes from Gordon Creighton, Editor of the informative British Flying Saucer Review, who notes a possible deathly tie-in with the U. S. 'Star Wars' program. Here I quote in part his letter of November 15, 1988: Gordon Creighton, November 15, 1988 letter: '...here in Britain, 22 scientists have recently either taken their own lives or died in very strange or mysterious circumstances. And it seems that most, or all, of them were engaged in British work on behalf of, or related to, the U. S. 'Star Wars' program. The British government, it seems, was trying to hush it up. But press statements here say that the U. S. government had put our British government on the spot and demanded full inquiry. So, quite clearly, it is either the Russians or THEM ...' Len Stringfield: As many researchers have surmised, 'Star Wars' - ostensibly conceived as a defensive system against Russian missile attacks - might have had from its beginning a 'defensive' UFO connection. Whatever the case, a 'mock test' in September 1988, of an earth-penetrating warhead, much like 'Star Wars' in reverse - was conducted at the Tonapah Test Range in Nevada. Announced as a proposed super-weapon designed to destroy Russian underground command centers dug in solid rock down to 1000 meters, some UFO analysts believe that the real target is not Russian, but another adversary down deep in cavernous installations in Nevada and New Mexico. According to the Pentagon, the proposed earth-penetrating warhead is 'urgently needed.' According to the rumor mills, an alien race of the 'grays' is in their fortressed underground laboratories and are genetically experimenting with the human race. Even more ominous, rumors say that their intransigence today might lead to new perils tomorrow. It is beyond the scope of this paper to speculate on all the sinister machinations attributed to the alien super-race. But news of the British death syndrome and my awareness of other suspicious deaths and disappearances - allegedly connected to UFO crash and retrieval events - must be reckoned with. They might indeed have at least a peripheral pertinence to fears, causing suicide or extreme security measures to maintain a monstrous cover-up. At this writing in early December 1988, I have four other sources with UFO crash/retrieval information not included in this report. Most, as far as I know, are in positions to throw strong light on the humanoid factor and other phases of retrieval operations. They could confirm information already cited in my previous papers. But at this stage, and in some instances, being dependent on intermediaries, I find the material to be either too fragmentary or too sensitive to even hint at its nature."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" The material herein was originally intended as an article to update my work for publication in the MUFON UFO Journal in early 1989.
