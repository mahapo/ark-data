Intelligence Agent R eturn to Part 1 Updated - May 14, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuing in Part 8 with Linda Moulton Howe's 1983 to 1987 High Strangeness file notes about EBENs and other non-human entities. The following are interview notes I wrote from a 1984 discussion with an intelligence source. Is it true there have been violent armed exchanges between our military and non-human entities? Yes, I have personally had a briefing with MJ-4, an expert on the different alien types, about military actions with aliens in Ohio and South Dakota. Why would advanced and sophisticated non-human entities have any respect for or problem encountering our human military? Sometimes we get the impression that craft are deliberately allowed to crash or be shot down by us so we can get our hands on it, but some of the technology we have retrieved has sent us down red herring paths that wasted a lot of our time. Tricky business. I often think of a cat playing with a mouse. Are the EBENs really trying to help us humans? Or are their ‘gifts’ really Trojan Horses designed to pull the rug out from under us technologically - maybe to slow us down because of their monitoring projects on Earth. I don't think the EBENs want to war with humans flying around in airplanes! Is there an agreement between MJ-12 authorities and the Tall Blonds? Or Greys? Or humanoid reptilians? about global animal mutilations? If DNA from animal mutilations is being used to create cloned body containers for various alien missions on Earth, could that cloning technology be used to literally take over Earth? The Tall Blonds are not in any agreement that I know about. They are generally a mystery to most everyone I have worked with and have caused us problems so we have been forced to contact the Greys for help. I don't really understand the exact relationship between the Tall Blonds and various Grey types, but I don't think they are friendly. MJ-12 and the USAF keep track of the Tall Blonds by tracking them through contact with EBENs to some extent. The EBENs can communicate with the Tall Blonds, but the Tall Blonds do not spend much time in direct communication with anyone, even though they are supposed to be able to speak English. Verbal speaking is something the EBENs cannot do because they don't have a larynx like humans do. But the Tall Blonds can talk when they want to, which is not very often. Telepathy seems to be the communication of choice of both the Tall Blonds and EBENs. Is the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) now the control center for MJ-12? It's split between DIA and NSA (National Security Agency). How often do MJ-12 authorities get involved in human abduction cases? I'm not sure, but I do know there are cases that have never been public, like one in Wright, Wyoming, in 1974. A deputy sheriff was picked up by a UFO and two days later was put down in Burlington, Vermont. Don't think anyone knows why, including that law officer. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Where was the deputy examined by MJ-12 agents? A USAF hospital and I think it was in Plattsburgh, New York. [ Editor's Note: Plattsburgh AFB, a SAC base, was located only twenty miles from the Canadian border. Immediately to the east was Lake Champlain. Burlington, Vermont was on the opposite shore. The base closed on September 25, 1995, pursuant to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (10 U.S.C. Sec. 2687 note) and the recommendations of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission. It is now an industrial complex, operated by the Plattsburgh Air Base Development Authority. See Plattsburgh USAF SAC Base, N. Y. ] What does MJ-12 know about the Bermuda Triangle? MJ-12 and USAF think the Tall Blonds had, or still have, an underwater base there, which is responsible for the magnetic anomalies that cause ships and people to disappear. One of the mysteries is which was here on Earth first - the Tall Blonds? Or the EBENs? Or did they end up here because they were at war with each other? We think that the Tall Blonds have long used the largest part of the Earth to cover their bases - what I mean is, underneath the oceans and seas and lakes. The EBENs are more underground, not underwater, as far as I know. Do the EBENs really try to keep check on the Tall Blonds for the U. S. government?! When the EBENs are here. That's what worries everyone - what happens if the EBENs are not around? Would the Tall Blonds try to take over? I don't know what the 300 Year War was about that supposedly happened between the Tall Blonds and EBENs. If we understood the truth there, we'd probably understand a lot more about why the two types are here on Earth now. When was that 300 Year War supposed to be? 5,000 years ago, having something to do with the time of Mesopotamia. If the Tall Blonds and EBENs ended their long war and are in some kind of truce, why do the Tall Blonds still interact with Earth where the EBENs are, too? All I know is that the Ebe at Los Alamos told the USAF Captain: ‘Everything the Tall Blonds do, they do for a reason.’ MJ-12 thinks the people the Tall Blonds abduct, like Travis Walton, were chosen at birth in some kind of monitoring scheme from birth to death. Some even think there is monitoring before birth and after death, but I'm not sure I know what that means. Are the Tall Blonds afraid of going to war again with the EBENs? I don't know. But I do know that before the Falkland Islands war, there was intense UFO activity there and an EBEN group rescued a human from the Tall Blonds. Two military men were in the process of being abducted by a Tall Blond craft when three EBEN craft appeared above the Tall Blond craft. Eyewitnesses said it looked as if the EBEN craft forced the Tall Blond craft to land. Two EBEN craft landed and one stayed above the scene protectively, or ready to take offensive action? Out of the Tall Blond craft walked a tall blond being. Out of the EBEN craft came two short EBENs. The three beings met and appeared to communicate while military personnel watched. Then the Tall Blond being and the craft left. The EBENs came to the military eyewitnesses and communicated telepathically: ‘They will not harm you any more.’ The Falkland Islands military personnel asked, ‘Who are you?’ The EBENs answered, ‘We are your protectors.’ [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - The Falklands War started between the United Kingdom and Argentina on Friday, April 2, 1982, with the Argentine invasion and occupation of the Falkland Islands and South Georgia, and ended with the Argentine surrender to the U. K. on June 14, 1982. The war lasted 74 days, with 255 British and 649 Argentine soldiers, sailors, and airmen, and three civilian Falklanders killed. The Falkland Islands consist of two large and many small islands in the South Atlantic Ocean east of Argentina. Another UFO-related incident in the Grenada War the next year in 1983 is reported in 051706Earthfiles. ]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"G renada War extended from October 23 to November 21, 1983. In illustration above, green lines indicate vines still clinging over the top of bell-shaped UFO after the USAF and Marine troops cut it out of the Grenada jungle on the northeastern end of the island near Pearls Airport and Tivoli. The craft was loaded aboard a C-5A for transport to Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, after one crew rest stop in Barbados. Government insiders have said this type of craft is linked to the blond humanoids referred to as “Nordics,” different from the grey EBENs (extraterrestrial biological entities) and another group described as “standing up lizards.” Draw ing © 2006 for Earthfiles by Dwayne Britnell. Some people in the government think the EBENs are our allies. Others think they lie to us. Maybe they all lie to us? It's really difficult when no human can get an honest and objective view of beings from somewhere else in the universe - especially when the EBENs and Tall Blonds both are involved in animal mutilations and human abductions. That means they are getting genetic material from Earth - so, what are they doing with it exactly? That's where the cloning technology to make body containers for all kinds of different missions comes in. MJ-12's greatest concern is who is walking around on this planet in a human body, but is not really human. Paul Bennewitz is convinced from the Cimarron case in New Mexico that those tall humanoids in charge of the short, grey ones, were mutilating animals in order to put blood in a vat as liquid sustenance for some kind of beings there. [ See 040306 Earthfiles. ] That's true. Probably part of the reason for the E. T. mutilation of animals around the world is literally for food. But there's more going on because genes are harvested from Earth life the way we grow crops to harvest. Paul Bennewitz did stumble into Project SIGMA - our communication efforts with the EBENs out of an NSA facility near Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque. MJ-12 couldn't allow Bennewitz to reach the public and media with credible information, which is what he was trying to do. Problem was, Bennewitz went to Kirtland first with his data! Set off alarm bells all over the place. So, a sophisticated misinformation campaign was organized to target Paul Bennewitz. One of the government's methods was to plant phony photographs of stuff on Archuleta Mesa near Dulce so that Bennewitz would talk about what counterintel operatives knew was phony. That's when they had Bennewitz in a noose and really kind of drove him over the edge. The CIA got involved, too, by moving the mother, Cindy, to a safe house in Los Angeles to get her away from the aliens after she and her young son were abducted from Cimarron. How often does Project SIGMA contact the EBENs and Tall Blonds? We didn't have regular contact until around 1978 and that's been mostly with the EBENs. We can send out a certain hertz frequency trying to make contact, but the EBENs have to initiate contact back to us. It's not like we can dial them up on a phone! The Tall Blonds are even more difficult. Occasionally, the Blonds will initiate contact for whatever reason, but they are entirely unpredictable. Have any of the alien groups tried to land where you have Project SIGMA broadcasting contact frequencies? Not that I know, but it's really classified. People in the human abduction syndrome also describe encounters with shorter blond-haired beings. Is there a genetic link between the Tall Blonds that have light blue eyes and the shorter blonds that can have yellow-gold eyes, sort of like the Greeks have had yellow eyes? All I know is that the Tall Blonds are more anatomically like us than the EBENs. EBENs have no voice box. The Oriental race on Earth is most similar to the EBENs culturally and physically. The Tall Blonds do have a voice box, but don't always choose to communicate verbally, or in English."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Are Earth's five races related to five different non-human groups that have all done genetic manipulation of already-evolving primates on this planet? From what I understand from MJ-4, this whole planet is some kind of cultural experiment by the EBENs and that experiment includes the five different Homo sapiens sapiens races. How many anthro-political experiments are going on with humans? Unknown, really. EBENs might have started it, but there have been lots of non-human visitors to Earth and that's a fact! Can you tell me more about what the Los Alamos Ebe said to the USAF officer about reincarnation, Christ and the Essenes? The one thing that really struck me was Ebe saying there are only a certain number of souls in this universe and that they do re-cycle. The EBENs call souls ‘living entities.’ [ Editor's Note: Wikipedi a - The Essenes were a Jewish religious group that flourished from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century CE. Being much fewer in number than the Pharisees and the Sadducees (the other two major sects at the time), the Essenes lived in various cities but congregated in communal life dedicated to asceticism, voluntary poverty, and abstinence from worldly pleasures, including sex. Many separate but related religious groups of that era shared similar mystic, eschatological, messianic, and ascetic beliefs. The Essenes gained fame in modern times after the discovery of an extensive group of religious documents known as the Dead Sea Scrolls, commonly believed to be their library. These documents include preserved multiple copies of the Hebrew Bible untouched from as early as 300 BCE until their discovery in 1946. ] Do souls re-cycle immediately upon mortal death? I think so. What is the black tunnel that opens into the light reported so many times in near death experiences (NDEs)? I don't know.” C ontinued in Part 9.
