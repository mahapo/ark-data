I know what it’s like to be around a high amount of power from electricity. ... I could hear a crackling noise. And I looked up and see this weird thing and it’s buzzing past me right above me.\" Ned White, Sitgreaves National Forest, Arizona, October 1995 A round 4 PM, in October 1995, Ned White set up camp inside the Sitgreaves National Forest between Payson and Heber, Arizona (middle green dot). June 22, 2007 Phoenix, Arizona - The first alleged \"drone\" photographs were dated May 5, 2007, from an anonymous Lake Tahoe, California source. The next day, on May 6, 2007, more digital images were taken by a man named Chad in the Bakersfield, California, region. The Lake Tahoe images were submitted to UFOcasebook.com and the Chad images were submitted to the Coast to Coast AM webmaster, Lex. He and I talked about the Chad images and Lex put me in touch with Chad. Since then, eyewitnesses to such a dragonfly-shaped aerial craft have gone back as far as 1987 in a hangar at Barksdale AFB, Louisiana. I now have a list of eleven witnesses. In addition to Shirley in Sequoia National Park and Robert Mariotti in Northridge, California – who talked with me for audio broadcast – another eyewitness has now agreed to speak about his October 1995, encounter north of Tucson in the Sitgreaves National Forest. He has requested anonymity and I will call him Ned White. Ned is 41-years-old and lives and works in Phoenix. He has spent his professional career in electronics and now works as an automation engineer producing assembly lines and robotics to supply a major pharmaceutical company. In October 1995, he was on a weekend camping trip a couple of miles north of Willow Springs Lake near Payson, Arizona, at about the 7,500-foot elevation. The big lake is 22 miles southwest of Heber and in the national forest in which Travis Walton was abducted on November 5, 1975.

Ned had set up his camp on one side of a meadow and realized that other people were there near a bordering tree line, people he thought looked like gun-carrying militiamen who were politically active in the mid-1990s. Ned said he didn’t want anything to do with them, but thought his camp site was far enough a way to not be bothered. Then something very strange happened. Interview: Ned White, Automation Engineer, Phoenix, Arizona: “I untied all my gear and was getting my tent up and I noticed the hair on my arms starting to feel like it was rising up. I know what it’s like to be around a high amount of power from electricity. And I started hearing like I was near a power transmission line. I could hear a crackling noise. And I looked up and see this weird thing and it’s buzzing past me right above me and I would say from some of the photos I’ve seen (since May 2007), this was in its simplest form. Some of these new pictures I've seen, the thing looks a lot more elaborate. This thing back in 1995 above my camp site was a lot more simple. 1995 Arizona \"Drone\" Looked Like Birmingham, Alabama 2006 \"Drone\" D ragonfly-shaped aerial object above power poles near construction site in May 2006, in Birmingham, Alabama. Photo by Mr. Smith. DID YOU LOOK AT THE BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, PHOTOGRAPH?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Yes, and that one looks more like it (what I saw). Not the later ones where it has all those extra things attached to it. And it just gracefully went over me. And I thought, ‘What the hell is that?’ That’s the family version of what I was thinking. When it passed me I felt as if I was near a power line. So there was a lot of electrical – like I said, I could hear the crackling. It was just above the trees, just barely clearing the trees. \"Drone\" Interfered with GPS I tried to get a GPS fix on it, but my LED screen kept going off and on, off and on, off and on, acting very weird. Whatever that thing was giving off, my GPS wouldn't work in its presence. I bought that GPS new in September 1995, one of the first ones on the market. N ed White: \"I found my old GPS and took a pic of the boot up screen. The software copyright is 1994-95 and it shows on the screen, even though I know it isn't the easiest to see. But it's there, and you can see that I've used this GPS lots of times.\" Image © 2007 by Ned White. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - \"The Global Positioning System (GPS) is currently the only fully functional Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Utilizing a constellation of at least 24 medium Earth orbit satellites that transmit precise microwave signals, the system enables a GPS receiver to determine its location, speed and direction. Developed by the United States Department of Defense, it is officially named NAVSTAR GPS. The satellite constellation is managed by the United States Air Force 50th Space Wing. GPS has become a widely used aid to navigation worldwide, and a useful tool for map-making, land surveying, commerce, and scientific uses. GPS also provides a precise time reference used in many applications including scientific study of earthquakes, and synchronization of telecommunications networks. GPS Interference and Jamming Since GPS signals at terrestrial receivers tend to be relatively weak, it is easy for other sources of electromagnetic radiation to desensitize the receiver, making acquiring and tracking the satellite signals difficult or impossible. Solar flares are one such naturally occurring emission with the potential to degrade GPS reception, and their impact can affect reception over the half of the Earth facing the sun. GPS signals can also be interfered with by naturally occurring geomagnetic storms, predominantly found near the poles of the Earth's magnetic field. Man-made interference can also disrupt, or jam, GPS signals. In one well documented case, an entire harbor was unable to receive GPS signals due to unintentional jamming caused by a malfunctioning TV antenna preamplifier. Intentional jamming is also possible. Generally, stronger signals can interfere with GPS receivers when they are within radio range, or line of sight.\"]"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HOW HIGH ABOVE YOUR HEAD WAS IT FLYING? Probably about 20 feet. And it didn’t pay any attention to me. It just bobbed around and then it went around and followed the tree line and got in basically behind them and it actually sunk down a ways into the trees. And it stayed there for a while behind those people (militia-types). LIKE IT WAS HIDING? Like it was hiding, watching and listening. This probably went on for a good ten minutes and then it rose up and took a right and just veered off as gently as you please and just disappeared out of sight. P ath of October 1995 dragonfly \"drone\" coming over Ned White's campsite about 20 feet above his head, proceeding straight, then curving around to trees across a meadow where \"militia people\" were gathered. The \"drone\" seemed to hide low in the trees for about ten minutes, without being seen by militia, and then flew off on path marked \"Exit path of Drone.\" Map © 2007 by Ned White. And I thought, ‘Great, all I need is to have someone spying on me!’ I wasn’t involved in any of that (militia activity). I do own guns, but I wasn’t involved in any of that stuff. This really bothered me. I thought, ‘Great, now they (government) are taking whatever these things are and following people.’ So at that point, I packed up my gear again and headed back to my truck. I didn’t stick around. I was pretty scared! I didn’t know what to expect next. Dragonfly-Shaped \"Drone\" Chan ged Direction by \"Jumping\" and Caused Tree Leaves to Move When it was moving in a constant direction, it was fairly smooth. But when it wanted to change, it was fairly jumpy – jumping in another direction. I’m thinking back in my mind’s eye and remember watching that thing settle in – I saw leaves on the trees where it moved over - they moved like it was pushing air down. THE OTHER PEOPLE DIDN’T HAVE ANY RESPONSE? I don’t think they even saw it. And that’s what scared me. It was hugging the treetops and just moving very gracefully. But when it changed direction, it was sort of like a skip. OTHER EYEWITNESSES THIS YEAR, LAST YEAR OR IN 2005, HAVE COMPARED IT TO THE WAY A DRAGONFLY MOVES OVER WATER OR THE WAY A WATER BUG – WHICH IS A JERKY, SKIPPING MOTION. When it was moving in a constant direction, it was fairly smooth. But when it wanted to change, it was fairly jumpy – jumping in another direction. Long \"Tail\" Turned First Before Direction Change SINCE IT WAS ONLY ABOUT 20 FEET ABOVE YOU, COULD YOU SEE ANYTHING"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"IN THAT DRAGONFLY-SHAPED VEHICLE THAT SEEMED TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR IT MAKING A CHANGE IN DIRECTION? No. I know airplanes. I know – my dream as a child was to be an astronaut. But when 2nd grade came around and I had to wear glasses, that dream was trashed. But I know airplanes, helicopters; I can recognize different kinds of engines. And looking at this thing, there were no moving parts. Now, looking back - after seeing the thing in photographs brought back the memory. Seeing the way that thing was moving, I swear by knowing about aviation, it is using electrostatic energy to force air down to make it stay up in the air. DID THE RING ALWAYS STAY GOING FORWARD? OR DID THE TAIL TURN AROUND THE RING? The tail, when it moved in a different direction, the tail would turn first and then it would move. THE TAIL MOVED FIRST? The tail moved first. So if it changed like making a right hand turn, the tail would move for the ring to be in front. LIKE IT WOULD STOP AND PIVOT? Yeah. THAT MATCHES THE MOTHER WITH TWO SONS LAST YEAR IN YOSEMITE PARK. SHE SAID WHEN THEY SHINED A FLASHLIGHT ON IT (“DRONE”), IT STOPPED IN MID-AIR AND THEN IT SEEMED TO MAKE A FAST, JERKY TURN GOING INI ANOTHER DIRECTION. EACH TIME THE AIMED THE FLASHLIGHT ON IT, THE CRAFT WOULD MAKE A STOP AND STRANGE, JERKY TURN, MAYBE LIKE A PIVOT. Right. IF YOUR EXPERIENCE OCCURRED IN OCTOBER OF 1995 AND WE’RE SPEAKING IN JUNE OF 2007 – THAT’S NEARLY TWELVE YEARS AGO – IN THOSE 12 YEARS, HAVE YOU DESCRIBED THIS DETAIL ABOUT THE MACHINE IN THE AIR TO ANYONE ELSE? Just recently to my sisters. Arizona \"Drone\" Witness Afraid of U. S. Government Retaliation SO YOU DIDN’T TALK ABOUT IT AT ALL UNTIL NOW? No. I had a scary experience some years before where I was at the wrong place at the wrong time and I saw something I should not have. And I was warned the next day not to talk about anything. That was fresh in my memory (in Oct. 1995) and I didn’t want to put myself at risk. So I bit my tongue. I didn’t know what it (“drone”) was and I didn’t want to draw attention to myself. WHAT DID YOU SEE BEFORE AND WERE WARNED ABOUT? It was a stealth fighter. It’s out in the open now. I used to work at the Goodyear plant (in Phoenix) and I answered an alarm call. I went out there – and this was about 1985. I went out to answer the alarm call and I saw this plane and it was having engine trouble. It landed at the Goodyear airport, not at Luke AFB (in Glendale suburb of Phoenix). I was like, ‘Wow, that’s a cool silhouette!’ I was talking to a police officer and decided to drive up past the Goodyear plant and there it was and there were guys out there with machine guns. I went, ‘Oh, that’s a neat looking plane. Oh, crap, these guys are looking at me.’ And then I got a visit at my apartment the next day. DID THEY TAKE DOWN YOUR NAME, ADDRESS AND PHONE NUMBER THERE AT THE SITE? No, they were behind a fence. I was driving on a road and they took down my plate"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"number, probably. And that’s how they tracked me down. They told me, ‘If you see that thing on TV, then you can talk about it. Other than that, At first, they were polite about it. They said, ‘We’re asking you as a patriot citizen not to say anything to anybody. THEN THEY BECAME MORE STERN? They became sterner and said, ‘If you do talk about this, there are things we can do because, you know, you should not have seen this and it’s not a good thing that you did. So, if you start bragging about this thing, we have found people out in the desert.’ THEY ACTUALLY SAID THAT TO YOU? Right, in front of my girlfriend at the time. AN IMPLIED DEATH THREAT. An implied death threat. And I turned around and told them, ‘Look, I’m a patriotic guy and there is no need for that. All you have to say is - Don’t say anything - and I’m not going to say anything.’ At the very end of this thing, they said, ‘If you see it on TV then you can tell everybody about what you saw. But until then, don’t say a word.’ Seeing that probe thing right above my camp and those militia guys was like, ‘I don’t want to be in another situation where I said something or saw something I was not supposed to and then talk about it and have some visit like the last time. I don’t want that to happen again. SO, YOU KEPT YOUR MOUTH ABSOLUTELY SHUT BETWEEN 1995 AND 2007 BECAUSE OF THE 1985 RUN IN WITH GOVERNMENT AGENTS CONCERNING THE STEALTH THEN. BUT NOW WE’RE DEALING WITH WHAT WE’RE NOT SURE WHAT IT IS, WHAT ITS ORIGIN IS OR WHO MADE IT. Right. IN 2007 WITH THESE DRAGONFLY-SHAPED ‘DRONES’ THAT HAVE BEEN MORPHING IN THE SHAPES AND WITH APPENDAGES AND NOW TO THIS CURRENT, VERY MENACING-LOOKING ONE WITH ALMOST A WAR MACHINE APPEARANCE, IF IT IS AMERICAN – IF IT IS A ‘BLACK PROJECT,’ WHY WOULD IT BE OUT IN THE PUBLIC BETWEEN 1995 WHEN YOU SAW IT AND NOW IN 2007? I don’t know. What I would be curious about is what kind of political situation is going on in the areas it is going to? WHY IS IT BEING SEEN ONLY IN STATE OR NATIONAL PARKS? Yeah, that’s kind of weird. I don’t know. I wish I had an answer for that! (laughs) BUT YOUR BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WHAT YOU SAW IN OCTOBER OF 1995 MOST CLOSELY RESEMBLES THE PHOTOGRAPH FROM BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA? Yes. What I saw was the more simpler version (than Big Basin, California). AND WHO IS BEHIND THIS IS WHAT WE WOULD ALL LIKE TO KNOW. Yeah. Out of fear, I just kept my mouth shut. My Mom and my two sisters, I have to be there for them. I don’t have any kids of my own and I’m not married. But, I worry about my Mom and my sisters. The reason I’m calling you now is that I called my sisters up and I talked to them and told them what I saw. And I told them what I was thinking about talking (to Linda for Earthfiles). My family turned around and said, ‘Tell them. Tell them what you saw.’” Writing In Chad \"Drone\" Image - A Link to NASA Clementine 1 Moon Mission? I first interviewed Ned White on Saturday, June 16. The next evening, I received an email from George Pettit, a truck driver based in Shermansdale, Pennsylvania. He uses Earthfiles.com and was aware of the ongoing and evolving dragonfly-shaped drone story."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"He was studying the Chad photographs at Earthfiles: http://www.earthfiles.com/news.php?ID=1247&category=Environment George decided to rotate 180 degrees the lettering on the long tail to see if he could figure it out more clearly.

The URL goes to information about Deep Space Program Science Experiment, Clementine 1 Lunar Mapping by Naval Research Laboratory - including a series of images of the moon's surface - the Planetary Data Portal (PDP) and even Home@SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence). Is there a connection between the dragonfly \"drones\" and the 1994 Clementine 1, or other lunar missions? Hundreds of people emailed me their own analyses of the \"drone\" tail and the code in the PDS_VERSION_ID=PDS3 above. Excerpts from June 21, 2007, email to Earthfiles.com: \"Now look at where the character combination yx7+ actually appears in the NASA document (use an in-page search, if your browser supports this). It is not in the upper textual part of the document but rather in a block below this which is obviously binary data of some sort (i.e., it is not meant to be directly intelligible to the human brain, but needs some kind of computer program to interpret it). In fact, this is NOT a normal text document, and the clue to what it actually is is given in the file header where it says \"PDS VERSION ID = PDS3\".PDS, in this case, stands for Planetary Data System, which is a NASA proprietary file format for storing space mission data and which requires the appropriate proprietary"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"program to fully interpret. \"The file header also contains the information that the binary part of the file consists of data from which the interpreting program can reconstruct three objects that the human brain can then apprehend, i.e., an IMAGE_HISTOGRAM, a BROWSE_IMAGE (presumably a thumbnail) and the IMAGE (presumably a Clementine photograph of the Moon) itself. In other words, the characters yx7+ in this document are merely ASCII character interpretations of what are really numerical data that are part of the digital description of an image made by the Clementine spacecraft ... \"While pondering this, I half remembered (here comes the frustratingly vague bit) a British TV documentary that I had seen maybe two or three years ago in which a senior journalist, who worked either for one of the major flying magazines ( Flight International ?), or maybe it was for Jane's Aircraft , set out to prove that while UFOs are real, they have nothing to do with aliens but are rather all the products of government black projects dating back to the Nazis in WWII. Because of the particular clout that he possessed in the aviation business, he was able to secure interviews with many top people in the industry including one in particular that my pondering on the drones had brought to mind. \"Electrostatic Levitation\" \"This was with a high-up executive in one of the major American aircraft (and defense) manufacturing companies. He enthusiastically endorsed the journalist's theory of the black-ops origin of UFO sightings, and by way of supporting evidence, proceeded to demonstrate electrostatic levitation by plugging a coil of bare copper wire into his office electricity socket and suspending it over an aluminum plate (not only was this extremely dangerous from the point of view of possible electrocution, but the heat generated was such that he had to end the experiment after a few seconds lest he set fire to the office). He then said something along the lines of: 'We in the industry are much further advanced along the line of exotic propulsion and lifting technologies than the public realizes.' \"Why he should make such an admission (when I would assume that he would be sworn to secrecy on the matter), I cannot even guess. I remember that in the documentary this demonstration of electrostatic levitation was then linked to an explanation of some of the Gulf Breeze UFO photographs which appeared to show glowing (it was suggested from heat) cylindrical apertures at the base of the craft.\" F or further information about the dragonfly-shaped \"drones,\" please see reports below : R eturn to: 06/18/2007 - Writing In Chad \"Drone\" Image - A Link to NASA Clementine 1 Moon Mission?
