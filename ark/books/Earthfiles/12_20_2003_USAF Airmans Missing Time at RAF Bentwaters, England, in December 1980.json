Map © 1997 by Larry Warren and Peter Robbins. December 20, 2003 Phoenix, Arizona - Beginning Friday, December 12th, the Sci Fi Channel broadcast a docudrama about the famous alleged UFO landing incidents at the American and British Air Force joint RAF Bentwaters base in England, near the Rendlesham forest. The exact time line of what happened, and when, has been part of the confusion over the years as various eyewitnesses have had different descriptions of events at different times and dates. What has become clear is that highly strange events occurred on at least three nights, beginning at 3 a.m. in the early morning of December 26, 1980. That's when U. S. Air Force Airman John Burroughs, who was on patrol with another security airman near the RAF Bentwaters East Gate, was asked to investigate odd lights that were reported near Capel Green beyond the Woodbridge Air Field. When Airman Burroughs reported back to Central Security Control that there were in fact eerie lights, screaming sounds and animals making noises, it was decided that higher ranking Staff Sergeant Jim Penniston should join the investigation.

The three men were walking through the Rendlesham forest toward what they thought was a distant light when suddenly, the light was right upon them and the three men dove to the ground, scared. Burroughs said, \"more scared than I've ever been in my life.\" Penniston described an electricity in the air and said he could see a dark, glass-like surface behind the bright light and described the object as triangular with symbols on its surface. Burroughs does not remember a triangular shape or symbols, but emphasizes how strange the light was and how scared they all were. Burroughs even remembers Penniston ordering him to fire his weapon at the object, but none of the three men were armed with weapons. The light moved away and up into the sky and the men retreated back to the base without filing a formal written report in the Shift Commander's log book. But in the morning, Bentwaters Deputy Base Commander, Lt. Col. Charles I. Halt, asked that Burroughs make a report and this is what John wrote: \"On the night of December 25-26 at around 03:00 while on patrol down at East Gate, myself and my partner saw lights coming from the woods due east of the gate. The lights were red and blue, the red one above the blue one and they were flashing on and off. ...There was radio traffic back and forth and the decision was made by the shift commander that I should accompany two security guys into the woods. \"On the night of December 25-26, (1980) at around 03:00 while on patrol down at East Gate, myself and my partner saw lights coming from the woods due east of the gate. The lights were red and blue, the red one above the blue one and they were flashing on and off. ...There was radio traffic back and forth and the decision was made by the shift commander that I should accompany two security guys into the woods. \"We crossed a small open field that led into the trees where the lights were coming from and as we were coming into the trees, there were strange noises, like a woman was screaming, also the woods lit up and you could hear the farm animals making a lot of noise and there was a lot of movement in the woods. All three of us hit the ground and whatever it was started moving back. ...After a minute or two, we got up and moved into the trees and the lights moved out into the open field. \"Everything seemed like it was different when we were in that clearing, the sky didn't seem the same ...it was like a weird feeling, like everything seemed slower than you were actually doing; and all of a sudden when the object was gone, everything was like normal again. \"{The UFO was} a bank of lights, differently colored lights that threw off an image of like a craft. I never saw anything metallic or anything hard.\" The next night of December 26 to 27, John Burroughs was not on the base, but heard that more strange lights were reported that night and that Deputy Base Commander, Lt. Col. Halt, was involved in that investigation."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Then the third night of December 27 to 28, John Burroughs was back on the base to witness and participate in even more dramatic events that included beams shining down on the nuclear weapons storage area at Bentwaters. Back then in 1980, government officials would not admit that nuclear weapons were stored at the British base, but now it has been confirmed that nuclear weapons were there and definitely were a target of interest to the moving blue lights and their beams. In fact, Airman John Burroughs remembers that an investigative team specifically inspected the nuclear weapons the next day in the aftermath of the unidentified lights and beams. \"Weapons Storage Area,\" which in 1980 housed nuclear weapons at RAF Bentwaters.

Thus, USAF Airman John Burroughs was involved on two of the three nights of UFO activity at Bentwaters December 25 to December 28, but was never interviewed for the Sci Fi Channel docudrama. He is troubled that the program emphasized only parts of the events and implied that participants had been threatened with sodium pentathol and other manipulative efforts to keep people quiet about what really happened. John says he doesn't recall intimidation by anyone even though military eyewitnesses on the night of December 28 recall seeing John Burroughs enter, or get on top of, the object casting the bright light. I think it is important to share what he remembers that goes beyond the Sci Fi Channel production. Here now is John Burroughs who was 19-years-old in December 1980, is now in the US Air Force Reserve, pending call back to active duty in 2004, describing what he, Col. Halt and others saw on the third night of December 27-28, 1980. Interview: John Burroughs, United States Air Force Tech Sergeant in the USAF Reserves and Protection Coordinator, Medtronics, Phoenix, Arizona: \"When we got out to the base that night on Dec. 27, stuff had already started happening out in the woods. so at that point, we went down to the back gate which was East Gate and made our presence known. They were able to contact the party out there who was Col. Halt and we were given permission to go down to the area where Col. Halt and his party were. We initially went down to where the light-alls were and where the first landing site was (Dec. 25-26) and waited there and eventually I was called out to Col. Halt and his party. SO NOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING, THAT THE TRULY DRAMATIC EVENTS HAPPENED ON THE NIGHT OF DECEMBER 27, NOT THE 26TH? Right. There is another incident on December 27 to 28, yeah."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"LET'S GO INTO THIS ONE BECAUSE IF I UNDERSTAND FROM INTERVIEWING YOU AND JIM PENNISTON AND OTHERS, IT IS THIS NIGHT OF DECEMBER 27-28, 1980, THAT INVOLVED NOT ONLY A CRAFT, BUT POSSIBLY ENTITIES. CAN YOU EXPLAIN IN DETAIL WHAT YOU REMEMBER OF THE 27TH TO THE 28TH? When I met with Col. Halt and his group, they were starting to come up a little bit from the area where they had been and I met up with them. He started saying they had seen some strange lights and so he started asking me some questions about what happened to me (on December 25-26). Then shortly after that, he pointed up into the sky because one of the guys with us said, 'There's some of those objects floating around up there in the sky again.' Up in the sky at one point, there were three or four and it's hard to explain anymore than that they appeared to be not like stars. They were transparent blue objects that appeared to me almost like if you blew bubbles and how they would float around and the wind would affect them and they would go oblong. They were up in the sky and they were flying around. He said they had seen them for quite a period of time prior to my being out there, flying in their general direction. At that point, a couple of them broke off and went over toward the area of Bentwaters where they had a weapons storage area and you could see beams of white light being beamed down from them down into that area. The other two came toward our general direction. One of them shot down towards us, shot out a beam of light at us, and then shot over the top of us and went right toward the area where the group was with the light-alls. It shot down through the area where the light-alls were. They couldn't get the light-alls to work and as the lights went through that area, all the light-alls came on and off, flickered on and off. Then the \"bubble\" lights shot back up into the sky and disappeared in the distance. JOHN, WHAT WAS YOUR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHY THERE WOULD BE LIGHT-ALLS OUT THERE IN THE RENDLESHAM FOREST? The way it was explained to me was that initially when the flight on duty that night saw strange lights in the forest again, Col. Halt and I'm not sure if this was planned prior to the night of Dec. 27 or was planned after they saw it but what they did was take light-alls out to the area where we had first seen all the objects the first night (Dec. 25-26) and then I don't know if they were going to light up the area to investigate it or they were going to light up the area because something appeared there. That was never totally explained to me, but they hauled quite a few light-alls out in that area. HOW FAR ARE YOU FROM THE LIGHT-ALLS AND WHAT HAPPENED? I'm probably 100 yards or more from the light-alls where I met up with Col. Halt. The only people I remember for sure out there that night was Master Sergeant Ball, Lt. Englund, and there was a Sgt. Bustinza who was also there. AND THIS IS THE FAMOUS ADRIAN BUSTINZA THAT LARRY WARREN HAS TALKED ABOUT? Right. WHAT TRANSPIRES BETWEEN THE GROUP OF YOU AND WHERE THE LIGHT-ALLS ARE? Whatever we saw the night before, was there again. It was like all of a sudden it was in the distance. And Col. Halt is saying, 'Look at that!' I look out and about that time also there were a couple more blue lights flying up above, up in the sky. They said, 'Is that what you saw the first night?' And I looked at it and said, 'It looks a lot like what we saw in the distance from the gate the first night.' Sgt. Bustinza and I from looking at it, and we had radios and we were talking to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the tower which was in the weapons storage area and they also spotted an object that appeared in the distance all of a sudden. We verified with them that it was out there and a discussion was made and I asked Col. Halt if it was OK for me to go out to get a closer look and see. He gave me permission and sent Bustinza with me. It seems for a short period of time as we started walking toward it, it started coming towards us. When it did that, the tower we were talking with also said it seemed to be moving toward our general direction. We started running toward it. At that point as we were running, Bustinza was on my right hand side, went down to the ground and I kept going. And then just that quick, all of a sudden whatever we were going to was gone and I was standing out in the middle of the field and it was like everything was different. There was nothing there in the distance and everything seemed different. And there was nothing there anymore. After talking with Bustinza on the way back, he claimed that he did not fall down. He said some force pushed him to the ground and held him down there and wouldn't let him come up. Did John Burroughs Touch An Object in the Light? YOU HAVE TOLD ME IN THE PAST THAT YOU REMEMBERED BEING CLOSE TO A LIGHT AND AT LEAST REACHING TOWARDS THE LIGHT. JIM PENNISTON HAS TOLD ME HE REMEMBERS BEING CLOSE TO A LIGHT AND REACHING WITH HIS LIGHT TOWARD A SILVER SURFACE ON WHICH HE COULD SEE SOME KIND OF RAISED SYMBOLS. DO YOU HAVE ANY RECALL OF REACHING TOWARDS THE LIGHT AND SEEING SOME KIND OF SILVER REFLECTIVE SURFACE? That's weird because the closest I ever felt I was ever to an object would have been the first night (December 25-26, 1980). I don't remember like reaching out or being able to identify any object. The third night (December 27-28, 1980) and it started when Bustinza and I were walking back. The people behind me were saying that I was on top of something or right into the light and then the light disappeared and I was there. I do not, do not, I don't want to call it missing time totally, but I do know from the point when I felt like I was close to whatever this was the third night and it was gone, it seemed like there was some time missing. It seemed like there was it just didn't seem possible it would be like looking at a wall. You're right ready to touch it and then the wall is not there. That's the best way I can describe that. THAT MOMENT FOR YOU IS THAT YOU ARE RUNNING TOWARD THE LIGHT. HALT IS RUNNING WITH YOU. BUSTINZA IS RUNNING WITH YOU. EGLUND IS RUNNING WITH YOU? No, none of them are running with me. They are standing back. Only Bustinza and I were running towards the light. HAVE YOU PERSONALLY TALKED WITH ADRIAN BUSTINZA THAT NIGHT OR ANY TIME BACK THEN ABOUT WHAT HE REMEMBERED? Yes, I talked with him a little bit that night and then a few years ago, over ten years ago. That's where he verified that he thought there was a force that held him down and he told me that I was definitely on top of an object. WHEN HE TOLD YOU THAT YOU WERE DEFINITELY ON TOP OF AN OBJECT, WHAT DETAILS DID HE GIVE? He just said that I continued to run. He could see me and it seemed like the object came toward me and at that point and I don't know he described 'on top.' I don't know if I was on top of it or immersed in it, but the object and I met I"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"guess is the best way I could say what he said had happened. AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MEMORY WHATSOEVER OF TOUCHING, RUNNING TO GET INSIDE OF OR ON TOP OF WHATEVER WAS EMANATING THIS LIGHT? I have no memory of that whatsoever. I KNOW YOU TRIED AN HYPNOSIS SESSION WITH JOHN CARPENTER IN MISSOURI BACK IN THE EARLY 1990S. I WAS THERE. WE NEVER COULD PENETRATE THAT BLANK EITHER. Right. But I did go under hypnosis prior to that. AND IN THAT EARLIER HYPNOSIS SESSION, WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU REMEMBERED? As far as what comes out under hypnosis? YES. It's hard to deal with because this is where, this is why I don't want to totally say that the Jim Penniston, Larry Warren, or anybody else is totally too bizarre. But it comes out that there was alien contact, that they purposefully picked that area to make contact with certain individuals, that they seek out certain individuals to have contact with, that there will be a point in time in the future where they will come back to us for a reason, that - oh, God! that they are here among us as far as they are in different areas, that they are underground and they travel from far away. They have bases stationed along the way and quite frankly, to see the videotape afterwards and the people who were in the room, everyone was kind of in shock. I don't know why this information came out or how it came out. DO YOU HAVE ANY MEMORY OF THE TYPE OF ENTITIES WHO WERE COMMUNICATING THIS TO YOU? DO YOU HAVE ANY IMPRESSION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY FELL INTO THE CATEGORY OF WHAT IS REFERRED TO TODAY AS GREYS OR BLONDS OR REPTILIANS OR OTHER? No, it didn't come out that way. It came out more I don't know a lot about the different ones you described it just came out more that they were here for a reason and almost comes out like they are not necessarily going to stop something, but they are here to see what happens to us because whatever happens now will affect what they are and what could happen to them. THAT DOVETAILS INTO JIM PENNISTON'S MEMORY UNDER HYPNOSIS THAT THE BENTWATERS VEHICLES, LIGHTS, WERE ASSOCIATED WITH TIME TRAVELERS FROM A DISTANT FUTURE WHO HAVE BEEN COMING BACK THROUGH TIME TRYING TO SAVE THE CIVILIZATION FAR IN THE FUTURE AND REFERRED TO US, THE CURRENT LIFE FORM ON THIS PLANET, AS 'BAND-AIDS.' WOULD THE CONCEPT OF TIME TRAVELERS FROM THE FUTURE FIT ANY OF WHAT YOU RECALLED UNDER ANY OF YOUR HYPNOSIS SESSION? To the extent yeah, the way it was coming out, the individual who was doing the hypnosis was trying to find out and all that was coming out was that there was grave danger coming up and they were here to observe, to find out, that they made contact with certain individuals for a reason because there will be a point in time when it will be necessary to re-contact us. And then it became to me, I don't understand hypnosis. But at one point, it almost seemed like I wasn't myself. I was speaking like somebody else and they actually, the individual (hypnotist) trying to get information, they wouldn't give him the information. It was that they (in the lights) were definitely here for a reason. The contact was made for a reason and there would be a point in time somewhere in the future that there would be re-contact."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" What Is the \"Grave Danger\" in the Future? SO WE'RE NOW AT THE END OF 2003, ALMOST INTO 2004, AS YOU AND I SPEAK NOW. THIS OCCURRED THE EARLY MORNING OF DECEMBER 26 TO THE EARLY MORNING OF DECEMBER 28, 1980. Right. SO, WE'RE TALKING ABOUT 23 YEARS. IN THESE 23 YEARS, HAVE YOU EVER HAD A DREAM, AN INTUITION, THAT SOMETHING WAS COMING THAT YOU'VE HAD VISUAL IMPRESSION OR ANYTHING THAT HAS HAUNTED YOU ABOUT LINKING BACK TO THAT NIGHT OF THE 27-28TH OF DECEMBER (1980), THAT RELATES TO SOME GRAVE THING COMING THAT THESE ENTITIES ARE STUDYING? I can't say this for a fact, but I feel this time frame now is the time if what really came out under hypnosis or whatever happened out there really had something to do I think this is going to be the time frame in the next two to three years. DO YOU HAVE ANY DREAM IMPRESSION OR INTUITIVE SENSE ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE COMING? Oh, I think my personal I can only say this because I don't want to come out that I know for sure but just a feeling of I think the whole issue with the Middle East there's a lot more to it than the public has been made aware. I think there is getting to be a huge show down between this is not coming from anything, I can't explain how I have this feeling there is going to be a huge showdown soon in the Middle East and it's going to involve the major world powers. And I think there is going to be a defining moment for our whole civilization and I think it will happen within the next three or four years. WILL IT INVOLVE NUCLEAR WEAPON EXCHANGE, DO YOU THINK? This is not my conscious level (of mind), but what came out under hypnosis was that the nukes were interesting to them, but they were very much more concerned with 'Star Wars' the lasers and everything else. They were much more concerned about what is going to happen involving outer space over nuclear weapons. The whole key to this involved Mars, it involved China, Mars, us and it didn't really say the Middle East, but involved what controls our economy and world. The big show down was coming in that frame. YOU MENTIONED THAT ANOTHER DISCREPANCY FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW WITH THE SCI-FI PRODUCTION WAS THAT THE FACT THAT THEY HAD WITNESSES WHO SAID THEY HAD BEEN THREATENED EITHER WITH SODIUM PENTATHOL OR SOME WAY TO KEEP THEIR MOUTHS SHUT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED AT BENTWATERS AND YOU WERE MAKING THE DISTINCTION THAT THAT HAD NOT HAPPENED TO YOU. Right. JOHN, IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THEY LEFT YOU ALONE BECAUSE YOU WERE THE ONLY ONE WHO ENDED UP ON OR IN WHATEVER THE VEHICLE WAS BEHIND THE LIGHT? If you go down that route why would they still leave me alone and mess with everyone else? Why wouldn't they be coming after me and interrogating me more to find out what happened? Why would they leave me alone? THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION, BUT WHY ARE YOU - SUCH A KEY FIGURE, - NOT INVOLVED IN ANY WAY IN THE BENTWATERS RECREATION ON THE SCI FI CHANNEL PRODUCTION?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I don't know. As a matter of fact what I thought was strange is when you see the show, they focus a lot on Col. Halt and Penniston. On my particular night (Dec. 25-26}, they talked to Cabanzak (Sp?) and Penniston. But they didn't talk with me. They actually showed a picture of me and a lot they zero in a lot on written statements and one I think was mine. BUT YOU'VE BEEN HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. WHY COULDN'T THEY INTERVIEW YOU LIVE FOR THIS PRODUCTION? I don't know. Even after the show, they had a website and I sent them a short message stating that I was wondering there was a caption asking if you had any knowledge of it (Bentwaters incident)? And I sent them a short message stating who I was and to contact me if you wanted to talk about it since you used my name and my statement. And I haven't heard from them.
