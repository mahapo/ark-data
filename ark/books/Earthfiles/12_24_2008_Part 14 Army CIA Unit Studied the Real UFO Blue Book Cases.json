One implant device was supposed to have produced hieroglyphs when passed over a certain kind of scanning device.” - “S tein,” Former Army/CIA UFO Analyst R eturn to Part 1 R eturn to Part 13 D ecember 24, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - My June 29, 1998, interview with Stein at his Florida home continues from Part 13, in which he describes CIA meetings at the White House, first in Fall 1958 with Richard Nixon and later in Part 15, a Spring 1959 White House meeting with both President Dwight Eisenhower and Vice President Richard M. Nixon. “AFTER YOU LEFT AREA 51, DID YOU GO BACK TO YOUR SOUTHEASTERN BASE? Yes, all five of us (Stein, Anthony Barden and three other CIA agents). IT’S AUGUST 1958 AND YOU’VE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE LIVE NON-HUMAN BEING. YOU’VE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE SEVEN DISCS. YOU’VE SEEN THE 16MM FILMED DISSECTION OF THE 6-FINGERED BEINGS. YOU’VE BEEN IN THE CIA LIBRARY AND SEEN FILES CONCERNING ROSWELL AND THE RETRIEVAL OF AT LEAST THREE KINDS OF DISCS, P LUS THERE ARE GERMAN-MADE DISCS IN ARGENTINA AND ANTARCTICA. YOU GO BACK TO THE SOUTHEASTERN BASE AND YOUR CIA/PROJECT BLUE BOOK UNIT. WHAT KIND OF NEW WORK DO YOU DO? When we got back, we had quite a few UFO sighting cases. One was from Puerto Rico. Some more in France and Belgium. 1958, Triangle-Shaped Craft Over Belgium WHAT WAS THE MOST DRAMATIC? I think the Belgium one. It was a triangle-shaped craft and had lights in each of the three corners. SO ALL THE WAY BACK TO 1958, YOU HAD REPORTS AND PHOTOS OF TRIANGLES IN BELGIUM LIKE THE 1990 REPORTS? Yes. But it was a fairly small craft back in 1958. I think the ones in the 1990s were very large. WHAT WAS THE DISCUSSION BETWEEN YOU AND ANTHONY AND THE OTHERS IN YOUR UNIT ABOUT THE TRIANGLE CRAFT? We were dumbfounded because we had never seen anything else up to that point except round discs. CIGARS? We didn’t see cigar shapes until probably 1960 when we had a cigar-shaped craft in the "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"atmosphere flying along at 5,000 to 6,000 mph. That was the only cigar-shaped craft that we had pictures on. WAS IT ON 16MM FILM? Ye s . WHO TOOK THAT FILM? It was foreign and I think the craft was down in Spain coming off the Mediterranean. THE TRIANGLES WERE ONLY IN BELGIUM? The only time I saw a photograph of a triangle-shaped craft, it was in Belgium and it came in from the coast into Belgium and then went back out to the English Channel before it went to Holland. DID YOU SIT DOWN WITH ANTHONY AND THE OTHERS AND SAY: ‘OK, THIS IS WHAT WE’VE SEEN. NOW IS THIS NEW PHOTO A GERMAN CRAFT? IS THIS NEW PHOTO A 6-FINGERED TYPE? IS THIS GREY?’ When we first saw the triangle-shaped craft, our first thoughts were that it was a phony picture because we had not seen anything that was triangular before. In fact, for that triangle in Belgium, we didn’t have much of a write-up. Langley and Ft. Belvoir never confirmed that it was an authentic photograph, not a hoaxed double exposure. So, we checked back with Ft. Belvoir to see what else they had on the triangle craft. They said, ‘We checked the photo, but the grain in the photo is apparently authentic. It’s not a triangle hanging on a string.’ SO, IT’S A NEW CRAFT AND NOBODY KNOWS WHO IS IN IT? Right, no one told us if they knew. I believe that was the first photo that our CIA Blue Book project ever passed on to us that was triangular instead of round. Different Aerial Craft: German and Interplanetary DID YOU AND ANTHONY SIT DOWN AND TALK WITH EACH OTHER ABOUT WHICH TYPE OF NON-HUMAN WAS IN THE TRIANGLE, THE DISC, THE CIGAR AND VARIOUS CRAFT TYPES? Yes, we figured the different shapes came from different parts of the universe maybe and that there probably are different types of aliens in the different craft. We did try to identify some of the foreign photographs. There was one from South America that we identified as a German Haunebu II. YOU DID HAVE A PHOTOGRAPH THAT CONFIRMED THE GERMANS WERE STILL FLYING SOME OF THEIR PEENEMUNDE CRAFT IN SOUTH AMERICA? Oh, yeah! The craft with a high center about 12-feet high – they all look like Haunebu IIs. Although they could be alien craft as well. But we labeled those photos as being German craft from Argentina. However, on radar, we used to see some of the real alien craft come from outer space right down into the Argentina region. We also saw craft come into the Antarctica region from outer space via radar we shared with the British down in the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean east of Argentina. The British would send us radar tapes of UFO"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"craft coming in at terrific speeds and down into the Antarctic region. DO YOU MEAN THAT THE RADAR CONFIRMED SOMETHING NOT FROM EARTH, BUT REALLY FROM OUTER SPACE, WAS WORKING WITH THE GERMANS ON CRAFT IN ANTARCTICA AND ARGENTINA? Yes, that was the implication. In 1959 to 1960, our unit was separating alien craft from the known German craft by the appearance of the craft. We always found the German craft to be much slower in speed than the alien craft. Some alien craft were tracked from outer space doing something like 30,000 mph! Alien Agendas? H uman abductions. Animal mutilations. Implants. WHAT WERE THE DISCUSSIONS IN YOUR CIA GROUP ABOUT WHAT INTELLIGENCE IS IN THE MACHINES AND WHAT DOES IT WANT? Anthony was always trying to get more information from Langley headquarters as far as the beings were concerned. Sometimes we had a huge amount of military sightings – something that we knew were completely legitimate observations of alien activity. All of a sudden we would have dozens of alien craft in one region on Earth in military radar screens that just flew right over at huge speeds. Those we knew were authentic because they were recorded on military equipment. We also had moving film of the craft on radar because there were cameras that could film the radar screens. DID ANYONE SAY, ‘THESE ARE HOSTILE’? No. But I think we had a couple of civilian reports about people abducted in Greece or Italy. There was one person who disappeared while walking up to look at a craft. The person either disappeared or was taken aboard the craft, examined, and then was found laying on the ground away from the area where the craft had originally landed. THESE WERE 1958 TO 1960 REPORTS YOUR CIA UNIT RECEIVED? Yes. We also had animal mutilation reports back then. I remember Colorado was one place. Those events were investigated locally by some agents, but not by us because our focus was international events. But we received photos and information so we would know what happened to the animal bodies to be able to look for the phenomenon in foreign sites. DID THE REPORTS TO YOUR CIA OFFICE SAY THAT THE ANIMAL MUTILATIONS WERE DIRECTLY LINKED TO EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT? Yes, because they had saucer craft spotted in the area and seen by ranchers. Then the ranchers found the mutilated animals near a saucer sighting. WHEN YOU GOT THOSE ANIMAL MUTILATIONS AND HUMAN ABDUCTION REPORTS, YOU WOULD SAY WHAT IN YOUR MEETINGS? Why are the aliens doing this? Why are they taking certain parts of these cattle and other animals? The reports we read said there were mutilations of other smaller animals, not just cows and horses. Anthony Barden came up with a twist. Our reports said that the sex organs were usually taken along with other parts and Anthony said, ‘Maybe the aliens are using them – because we had seen the autopsy of the 6-fingered ones that said the beings were neither male nor female – ‘maybe they are trying to use some of this material to manufacture a being that could reproduce?’ That was the main gist of our animal mutilation discussion. About the abductions, the humans were probed and examined. We had one or two that had implants. A woman in Puerto Rico had an implant in her neck. The agent there had a doctor remove this thing from her neck and found out it was a chip of some kind. She told the investigators that the aliens had implanted something in her, but she had a miscarriage right away. It was just a tiny little foetus and investigators could not tell if there was any difference between a normal human foetus of that age or an alien foetus or hybrid foetus. Apparently, something like that must be some of the alien experimentation. In the Puerto Rico case, we concluded that the aliens had put the implant in her neck not too far from the spinal column that would work like a homing device – the aliens would be able to find that particular woman any time and anywhere she might be. SO, YOU WERE DEALING WITH ABDUCTIONS, IMPLANTS, ANIMAL MUTILATIONS, CRAFT IN WHICH SOME WERE SAID TO BE GERMAN AND"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"SOME EXTRATERRESTRIAL, 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS AND GREY BEINGS - ALL IN THAT SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BETWEEN 1958 AND 1960? Yes. As far as the animal mutilations, our CIA Project Blue Book unit was not investigating the animal mutilations, but we were sent two cases from Colorado so we could see how the aliens were mutilating the animals. During my time with the CIA unit, we never ran across a foreign mutilation – or at least none were sent to us. CIA Trip to Brief Richard Nixon DID ANTHONY BARDEN EVER GO BACK TO WASHINGTON, D. C., TO ASK FOR MORE INFORMATION BECAUSE THE STORY WAS GETTING TO BE SO MUCH MORE COMPLICATED? Yes, the second trip when we went there and actually got into the White House was to see Richard Nixon at that time. I think that was late 1958 or early 1959. SOON AFTER GOING OUT TO AREA 51? Probably four or five months later and we went over all this material with him. WITH RICHARD NIXON? Ye s . IN THE OVAL OFFICE? Yes. And we had other people there with us from the CIA and they said, ‘We’re trying to send you everything that we have.’ We told them we had no foreign animal mutilations ever sent to us. But we had the Puerto Rico case of the ‘tagging’ of this woman. They called it ‘tagging’ when humans had implants in their neck or back or something like that. The other CIA people told us they had many cases of that occurring in the United States. OF TAGGING? Yes. ‘Tagging’ was when non-humans put little chips into the necks of people - the CIA had many cases. One implant device was supposed to have produced hieroglyphs when passed over a certain kind of scanning device. That was in 1960 just before I got out. The woman with that implant had been taken up in a craft that started out above her, then shone a beam of light down on her. When she was inside the beam of light, she floated up into the craft. DID SHE REMEMBER ANYTHING CONSCIOUSLY? No, but under hypnosis, she said that she was put on a table and examined and that the aliens had a probe come down that implanted the chip in her neck. After that, the aliens did not do anything of a sexual nature to her, but they gave her a thorough physical body exam – even her feet. She had a toe that had a problem, like a hammer toe. The aliens focused on that and ran some kind of gizmo over her big toe. She had terrible arthritis in that toe. But after the aliens finished, her toe was still curved, but she had no more arthritis at all in the small toes. The aliens helped her and took the arthritis away. DID SHE DESCRIBE THE BEINGS? If I remember correctly, she described them as small, about 3 feet tall, like greys with the big, dark eyes, and pointed chin. THE SAME TYPE AS THE ONE AT AREA 51 THAT YOU WERE AFRAID WAS A DEMON? WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT THIS CASE WHEN YOU LEARNED THE BEINGS HAD HEALED HER TOES? Well, we knew the aliens had various technologies such as laser cutters and other advanced tools. We just thought there was some kind of tool with a bright light they ran over her toes like they were trying to straighten her toe out. AT THAT POINT, WERE YOU RE-EVALUATING THE ISSUE OF DEMONS? DID YOU CONSIDER THAT NON-HUMANS MIGHT HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN EARTH THAT WAS NOT NECESSARILY EVIL? Yes. I would say we kind of swung back and forth, all of us swung back and forth. We thought there were some good aliens and some bad aliens, just like there are good and bad angels and good and bad humans. We thought some really were helpful and didn’t seem to do any harm to anybody. But why did they implant that particular woman? Maybe to see"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"how the toes turned out. We didn’t know. WHAT DID RICHARD NIXON SAY? First of all, he walked in and then we all sat down. The CIA used to always tease Nixon. The guys for some reason loved to tease him. They told him that somebody is out to kill you and he would flash his hands around. One time he called out my name and asked, ‘Why do you always sit there?’ And I answered, ‘Well, this is the first time I’ve ever been here. I think you’ve got me confused with someone else. But I sat here because I have a better shot from here.’ Nixon looked at the door and said, ‘That’s a good idea. Good thinking.’ But I was trying to tease him like the other guys! All through his career, the CIA always hassled him about somebody being out to get him. It was our big inside joke. R ichard Milhous Nixon, V. Pres. for 34th President, Dwight D. Eisenhower, and 37th American President, January 20, 1969 – August 9, 1974. WHAT DID NIXON KNOW CONCERNING THE ALIENS? He didn’t have that much knowledge. He said, ‘From all the reports I have received, we don’t know if they are trying to survey Earth for attack later. We don’t know. Some apparently do good. Some torture people and let them go. Or we are missing people altogether. We don’t know if some ever came back that were abducted and we have no idea where the aliens took them or where they went.’ That was the whole gist of information up to 1960 that we really were not sure whether the aliens had come to kill us eventually or come to help us or what? Why were they here on Earth? Why didn’t they go some place else and leave us alone? [ See Richard Nixon, Jackie Gleason and UFOs in websites below.] YOU HAD THE MEETING WITH NIXON TO DECIDE WHAT? In that White House meeting, we were reporting to Nixon because he helped President Eisenhower out in foreign affairs and Nixon always wanted to know everything that was going on in the foreign nations. He was very good at that and very knowledgeable. I never liked his personality, but he had a good mind. That might be why CIA people were always teasing him, trying to lighten him up! (laughs) Nixon must have been really paranoid! DID NIXON EVER SIT IN ON A MEETING WITH YOU AND ANTHONY BARDEN? One time with President Eisenhower and Nixon. When Nixon was covering foreign issues, Eisenhower would sort of let him speak to see what comments Nixon had. One time, Eisenhower got very aggravated with Nixon and told him to shut up."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"D wight David Eisenhower, 34th American President, January 20, 1953 – January 20, 1961. Eisenhower was very hard nose military. There was no joking with him. Everything was absolutely cut and dried and you kind of hoped to get out of his office as soon as you could. WHAT DID EISENHOWER SAY ABOUT THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL PRESENCE? He said, ‘I can’t figure out why we can’t get to the bottom of this!’” T o be continued in Part 15 - More details about Fall 1958 meeting with Richard Nixon.
