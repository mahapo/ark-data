Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon \"Stars\" That Move In Patterns © 2005 by Linda Moulton Howe A pril 21, 1966, Associated Press. October 3, 2005 Chattanooga, Tennessee - John Dotson was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee on October 16, 1953. By the time he was fourteen years old around Labor Day in 1967, he and his parents had moved to Jackson, Michigan. During 1966 to 1967, hundreds of people had reported unidentified flying objects in the Michigan skies. House Minority Leader, Gerald R. Ford, R-Mich, was so concerned about all the UFO sightings that on March 25, 1966, he broadcast the following statement on national radio: Gerald R. Ford: \" I believe Congress should thoroughly investigate the rash of reported sightings of unidentified flying objects in Southern Michigan and other parts of the country. \"I feel a congressional inquiry would be most worthwhile because the American people are intensely interested in the UFO stories, and some people are alarmed by them. Air Force investigators have been checking on such reports for years, but have come up with nothing very conclusive. \"In the light of these new sightings and incidents near Ann Arbor, Michigan, and elsewhere, it would be a very wholesome thing for a committee of the Congress to conduct hearings and to call responsible witnesses from the executive branch of the government and other witnesses who say they have sighted these objects. I think the American people would feel better if there was a full-blown investigation of these mysterious flying objects, which some persons honestly believe that they have seen.\" Congressman Ford's request for a congressional inquiry is what caused the controversial Condon Report to be produced by physicist Edward Condon, Ph.D., at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Today that historic report is considered to have been a deliberate whitewash of the UFO phenomenon in order to deflect media and public attention.

Condon, Scientific Director ------------------------------------------------------------------------ [1968] So glaring were the government's attempts to misinform the American people that when astronomer and USAF consultant, J. Allen Hynek, Ph.D., called one Michigan sighting \"swamp gas,\" people laughed at the feeble explanation. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"A stronomer J.

J ohn Dotson vividly remembers a night around Labor Day Weekend 1967 in Michigan that changed his own 8th grade mind about \"swamp gas\" being the explanation. Interview: John Dotson, Produce Seller, Chattanooga, Tennessee: \"It was just before I started back to school. The summer was cooling down, getting close to Labor Day, I think. I was asleep in my bedroom. We were in a 2-story house. My father had come in and woke me up. He said, 'John, John, wake up! Look at this!' I went to the window and looked up in the sky where he was indicating. All I saw were the stars. I thought it was just a very clear night. And he said, 'Keep watching.' All of a sudden, the stars started to move . It was like the little spaceships were exactly in front of where the stars would be so that I thought it was just stars. I didn't see the double image. Then all of a sudden, I saw a double image and they were spreading out. They were basically imitating the direction of the stars, but they were off angle just enough that I could see it.

Then they started moving around, a few at a time, kind of like a leaf blowing in the wind or something. Then they started chasing each other around. Pretty soon, they started making patterns in the sky: triangles, stars, hexagrams, pentagrams, circles.

But, by my clock, by the time it was all over, it was like 4 in the morning. And Dad had just come into my room soon after midnight. WAS YOUR DAD THERE AT THAT MOMENT, TOO? Yes, he was watching it all, too. I don't know why he would have bothered with such a thing, or even looking up at it. I would not have thought he was the kind of person who was into those things. YOU ARE DESCRIBING SOMETHING STARTLING THAT ANY HUMAN SHOULD FIND AMAZING AND WATCH. WHAT I'M TRYING TO ASK IS: IF YOUR FATHER CAME INTO YOUR ROOM AT MIDNIGHT, WAS HE STILL THERE AT 4 A.M.? Yes, he was there with me. DID YOU SAY TO EACH OTHER SOMETHING ABOUT FOUR HOURS HAVING PASSED? No, we really didn't notice the time until it all stopped. We just said, 'That's fantastic! Amazing!' He walked out and I headed back for the bed and looked at my clock and it was like around 4 in the morning. DO YOU AND YOUR FATHER THINK YOU WERE ABDUCTED? OR DID YOU WATCH FOR FOUR HOURS? I think we watched for four hours. We were mesmerized by what we saw, most surely. But at no time did I feel like he was not there. Did Anyone Else See 1967 Labor Day Weekend \"Moving Stars\"? IF YOU WATCHED THIS AMAZING DISPLAY IN THE SKY FOR FOUR HOURS, WOULDN'T YOUR NEIGHBORS AND OTHER RESIDENTS HAVE SEEN SOMETHING SIMILAR?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"To the best of my knowledge, no one ever said anything about having seen anything. As far as I know, my father and I were the only two people who witnessed that particular night. SO, HE DID NOT GO GET YOUR MOM? No. DID YOU ASK ANY OF YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT IT? In school, I kind of like hinted around about it. I said, 'During all this UFO stuff these last few weeks, few months, have any of you sever seen anything?' They all said they had not. YOU NEVER WENT TO A TEACHER OR A STUDENT AND EXPLAINED WHAT YOU AND YOUR DAD HAD SEEN? No, I never told anyone. WHY? WHY DO YOU THINK YOU NEVER TOLD ANYBODY? There wasn't anyone to tell. There was your standard gossip about it (UFOs), but specifically I never told anybody for a few years after that. AND YET THAT WAS THE YEAR UFOS WERE BEING TALKED ABOUT IN GENERAL AND CONGRESSMAN GERALD FORD CALLED FOR A CONGRESSIONAL INVESTIGATION. SO, WHAT PUZZLES ME WITH ALL OF THE NEWS AND WHAT WAS GOING ON, IT WOULD SEEM THAT YOU AND YOUR DAD WOULD HAVE CALLED UP THE POLICE, THE NEWSPAPER, WOULD HAVE CALLED UP EVERYBODY AND SAID, 'THE STARS WERE MOVING LAST NIGHT, BUT THEY WEREN'T THE STARS. THEY HAD TO BE UFOS.' Well, you have to take our background. We weren't originally from Michigan. We were from Tennessee. We are mountain folk. When something unusual like that happens, you might write it down in a memoir, but you don't talk about it. WHAT WERE YOU AFRAID OF? It just didn't seem the right thing to talk about it. I KNOW, BUT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU DID? You'd get noticed. Basically, the kind of people I was raised with, you just didn't want to get too noticed. It's all right to go out and do the farming and go to church and then have your business selling produce. But you don't want too many people looking too close at what you're doing because on top of the produce, you might have a basket of spinach covering up several half pints of moonshine. You never know! (laughs) I SEE. You don't want a lot of notoriety. Thirty-Eight Years Later in 2005 IN THE PAST 38 YEARS, I TAKE IT THAT THOSE FOUR HOURS OF OBJECTS MOVING IN THE SKY INTO ALL THOSE PATTERNS HAVE HAUNTED YOU EVER SINCE? Yes, really they have. YOU ARE 52-YEARS-OLD AS YOU TALK TO ME NOW, DO YOU HAVE ANYMORE INSIGHT ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP OF YOUR LIFE ON THIS PLANET TO SOMETHING ELSE OUT THERE? I contemplate that. I wonder about that. It's like somehow we've managed to co-exist and we're still managing to co-exist by not letting everybody know they are there. AND YOU WANTED ME TO KNOW ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU AND YOUR DAD IN 1967 WHY, EXACTLY? That one night changed his life (John's father deteriorated as an alcoholic) and it changed my life (new interest in the spiritual and paranormal) and there were thousands of Michigan people who had seen these events. According to records, that particular area of"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Michigan had huge percentages of increases in mental problems, depressions and anxieties and bipolar much more than the rest of the country. SO THE IMPLICATION IS THAT IF THERE WERE EXTRATERRESTRIALS IN THE CRAFT THAT WERE MAKING ALL THE PATTERNS FOR THOSE FOUR HOURS AS YOU AND YOUR FATHER WATCHED, THEY MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN TRYING OUT SOME KIND OF EXPERIMENTATION ON THE HUMAN COMMUNITY IN MICHIGAN IN 1967 THAT RESULTED IN A LOT OF MENTAL ANGUISH? Ye s . Ye s . BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MENTAL IMPRESSION MEANING LIKE A PICTURE IN YOUR HEAD, OR IN A DREAM, OR IN MEDITATION AN IMPRESSION OF WHICH SPECIFIC TYPE OF BEING OR ENTITY WAS INVOLVED IN THOSE CRAFT? Usually I used to find myself focusing on the greys, the standard greys.\" Website: http://www.presidentialufo.com/gerald_ford_ufos.htm http://ufocasebook.com/bestufopictures2.html Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
