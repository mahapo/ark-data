April 30, 2009 Wiltshire, England - Between April 14 and April 29, 2009, there have been six crop formations reported in oilseed rape in Wiltshire County, England. Five are described as “the most elaborate and geometrically sophisticated oilseed rape formations that have occurred in British crop circle history.” Those words were said to me earlier this week by long-time crop formation researcher Charles Mallett, who runs the Silent Circle Information Center in Calne west of Avebury. A recent formation reported in the Liddington Castle region is so hard to find that no one knows for sure when it formed and only two ground photographs have been shared so far. April 25, 2009, Liddington Castle near Chiseldon, Wiltshire Dene Hine sent the Cropcircleconnector this note after an April 25, excursion trying to find a rumored new formation: “After 3 hours of hunting in the field up and down the tramlines, I came across the circle that I was told about. Got totally rained on in the flash storms. This is not visible anywhere near the road. It must be visible from the top of the hill only. It's a small formation that contained 4 circles, 2 outlined and 2 solid, joined by lines. I would say the whole formation would be under 100 feet.” Update: An experienced crop formation investigator who flew low over this pattern some time later thought it was “too messy” to be considered a genuinely mysterious imprint in plants such as the other five formations in April.

This morning by phone, Charles told me that this brand new formation is also impossible to see from the ground b ecause it is right on top of Ro undway Hill and can only be seen from the air. In fact, it was spotted from an airplane early on the morning of April 29, and eyewitnesses assume it was made that night. The beautiful pattern is 230 feet in diameter and has 18 arcs swirling from a center made of five rings around a small flattened circle, 15 feet in diameter.

Yellow, flowering oilseed rape (canola) is one of the most difficult crops in the world to move in. Some varieties grow five to six feet tall and others three feet high. Blooming oilseed rape is thick and tangles around legs. The yellow pollen puffs off in clouds, leaving green trails of disturbance where people have walked. Yet, the first three 2009 crop formations reported in Wiltshire, England, between April 14 and April 24, were all precise, intricate patterns in blooming, oilseed rape. The third one, a sunburst pattern, stunned Silent Circle researcher, Charles Mallett, when his tape measure showed the longest length to be 298 feet, the size of a football field. Then the next day on April 24, came the extraordinary fourth pattern at Morgan's Hill southwest of Avebury. No one can recall seeing such a large, precise triangular pattern made up of seven circles and three near-half-circles in which the 5-foot-tall Morgan's Hill plants were laid down without a crease or break in their crisp stems.

The fifth one at Liddington Castle is north off the map. Charles Mallett has been examining plants and soils in patterns since the mid-1990s. After the first four amazing formations had turned up in only ten days, I phoned him to find out what his experienced mind and eyes were seeing."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Interview: Charles R. Mallett, Silent Circle Information Center, Calne, Wiltshire, England: “These current formations would probably be considered the most elaborate and geometrically sophisticated oilseed rape/canola formations that have occurred in British crop circle history, I would say. Right now in April 2009, we've had really huge, serious formations! This has never really happened before - kind of unprecedented. BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCES TRYING TO MOVE IN AND OUT OF OILSEED RAPE, WHETHER IT IS THE TALL 6-FOOT VARIETY OR THE HYBRID THAT IS LOWER, CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR A GENERAL AUDIENCE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO WORK IN AND MOVE THROUGH OILSEED RAPE? These are thick, heavy, succulent stems that contain a lot of water that the average diameter of the stem is probably half to three-quarters of an inch – more like three-quarters at full maturity. So, they are very stiff and brittle plants. If you walk out into the fields, it tends to tangle around your legs. You get pollen – you walk out of the fields covered in yellow with pollen all over you as you sneeze! Not a nice medium to be in. Considering the logistics and the problems with laying down a large, coherent pattern in that kind of crop, it would be a lot more difficult in oilseed rape than it would be in wheat or barley. The formations that have appeared so far this year, they are pretty sophisticated large, elaborate designs. 1) April 14, 2009, Ridgeway near Avebury. Diameter 118 feet. Even in the smaller, first one over east of Avebury, it’s pretty difficult to even see what it is on the ground because these plants are still relatively young. The plants spring back up pretty quickly unless they are crushed to the ground, which will obviously kill the plants. So, you’re walking around in a pattern, which is very vague on the ground. The patterns show up well from the air, but in the formation over at Avebury from April 14, probably 60% to 70% of the crop was bolt upright. The rest was semi-laid down, somewhat upright. So, it was hard to discern the actual nature of the pattern where it started and finished in places. And in many areas where visitors had not walked, I fo und many plants down flat to the ground without a break or crease.

Is Ridgeway A “Megalithic Sundial”? On April 17, 2009, I r eceived the following email with attached illustrations from the Australian scientist who has been collaborating with Italian crop researcher, Marina Sassi, and American astrophysicist, Mike Reed, who discovered the ratcheted spiral counting out Pi to ten decimal places last year at Barbury Castle.

Quite a few crop pictures have seemed to show yearly sundials; for example, Avebury 2003, Hackpen Hill 2003, Avebury 2005, or Oliver’s Castle 2007. (See http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/anasazi/sundials2007b.html ) The first crop picture of 2009 appeared on April 14, at Ridgeway near Avebury. At first its segmented circles seemed obscure, but then Italian researcher, Marina Sassi, noted its close resemblance to a megalithic sundial found in archaeological remains from Qumran in the Middle East:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"U ppe r le ft : April 14, 2009, oilseed rape pattern at Ridgeway near Avebury.

[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Qumran is located on a dry plateau about a mile inland from the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea in the West Bank, just next to the Israeli kibbutz of Kalia. The site was most likely constructed sometime during or before the reign of John Hyrcanus, 134-104 BC and saw various phases of occupation until probably after the fall of Jerusalem in 70 AD, when Titus and his X Fretensis destroyed it. Qumran is best known as the settlement nearest to the hiding place of the Dead Sea Scrolls buried in desert cliff caves.”] “A similar megalithic sundial was found also at Monte Bibele near Bologna in Italy. A nci ent megalithic sundi al comparisons by Mari na Sassi, Italy. “If the April 14, 2009, Ridgeway oilseed rape formation really is a ‘sundial,’ then various thick lines from that crop picture would seem to mark solar motions along the horizon over twelve months of any year, as the Sun passes through a series of different constellations on the zodiac. The angular breadth of those lines depends on latitude, but match fairly well an expected plus or minus 45 degrees away from due east or west at latitude 51 degrees N in southern England."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I llustration of modern sunwheel observatory created with standing stones by © Judith Young, Ph.D., Prof. of Astronomy, University of Massachusetts. “If that Ridgeway crop picture was truly paranormal (and this remains to be determined), then its overall message might be ‘four solar years left until the end of 2012,’ b ecause each of those four thick lines represents one complete motion of our Sun along the horizon, during any twelve-month period.” 2) April 19, 2009, West Kennett Longbarrow near Avebury. Diameter 211 feet. Charles Mallett: “Then on April 19, 2009, came the West Kennett Longbarrow pattern at 211 feet wide. That's so big that you’re wading around a long way from the tramlines and it is a thick, tangled, stinking mess, but it looked pretty in the landscape from the West Kennett Longbarrow, which is a very popular tourist site. It’s a very ancient burial site, thousands of years old. Those kinds of crop, the oilseed rape, they are very delicate with thick, chunky stems, as can be seen in the photographs. But if you even lightly stand on them, the stems smash and break. But again, looking into areas where people had not walked and would not generally walk, there were areas where all of the stems were bent neatly above the ground without breaking. There was no mechanical scrape marks on the stems. That's pretty impossible to reproduce using any kind of physical devices I’m aware of at this time. So, this Longbarrow formation is truly mysterious, as far as I'm concerned.
