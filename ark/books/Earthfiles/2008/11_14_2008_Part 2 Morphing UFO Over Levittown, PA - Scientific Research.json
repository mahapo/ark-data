C. LevengoodSummer privet leaves with abnormal red-brown discolorationassociated normally with fall production of the pigment anthocyanin.Hypothesis is that unusual external energies associated with theLevittown aerial phenomenon provoked premature anthocyaninproduction.

Image © 2008 by Robert Gardner.Return to Part 1November 14, 2008 Grass Lake, Michigan - W. C. Levengood, a biophysicist whoworked on his Ph.D. at the University of Michigan, has received several patentsconcerning seed development. His research work about evidence of spinning plasmavortices containing microwave and other energies affecting plants and grasses in the globalcrop circle phenomenon has been published in the prominent journal, PhysiologiaPlantarum: An International Journal for Plant Biology.W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, in his Grass Lake,Michigan, laboratory. Photograph © by Linda Moulton Howe.I began working with him in the early 1990s to investigate the global phenomenon of cropformations. Now retired at his Grass Lake, Michigan, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory,biophysicist Levengood has analyzed thousands of plants from crop formations in his owncuriosity about what unusual energies are interacting with the plants to produce some ofthe biochemical and biophysical changes he has confirmed. In his own words, he says that“a spinning plasma vortex with a microwave, electrical and complex low energyion-electron pulses” have interacted with many formation plants he has studied.He also asserts that the energy interaction that creates formations must occur rapidly, in afew seconds. Otherwise, he would find evidence of burning or charring from themicrowave heating. But he does not find such damage, and the formation plants continueto live and grow until harvest.When Robert Gardner, field investigator for Pennsylvania's Mutual UFO Network(MUFON) contacted me in July 2008 for scientific research help in the Levittown mysteryof a morphing aerial craft that dispersed little squares of light into the air around the privetand silver maple tree, I called biophysicist Levengood. The fourth appearance of themorphing UFO and its second time to disperse the mysterious little light squares occurredaround 4:10 AM on July 8, 2008.Bob Gardner collected branch and leaf samples from the exposed side of the privet bushand nearest silver maple tree for a Fed Ex shipment, which arrived at biophysicist'sMichigan lab on July 16, 2008.Then the sixth appearance of the morphing UFO and its third time to disperse themysterious little squares of light occurred between 1 AM and 4 AM on July 16, 2008. Bobgathered more samples after that exposure and that second shipment arrived in theMichigan lab on July 24, 2008. He received leaf and bud samples from the privet bush;leaf and bud samples from the silver maple tree about 65 feet from the privet bush; controlleaf and bud samples from another silver maple tree at the creek about 75 feet from theaffected silver maple tree. No other privet bush could be found in the apartment regionthat matched the one in the eyewitness’s yard; thus, no privet control was shipped tobiophysicist Levengood. Lab Report by Biophysicist W.

Upper photo shows insect-produced hole in a privet leaf and in lower photoan insect-produced hole in a silver maple leaf. Both holes show typical chew marks at the edges.In addition, note the absence of the red-brown pigment observed in all affected leaves. Significance of Anthocyanin PigmentOne of the functions of the pigment anthocyanin, which is present in most all land plants,is to provide plants with protection from excessively high levels of external radiation.Under normal conditions, the red color of the pigment is masked by the green colorationproduced by leaf chlorophyll. But anthocyanin is present during the entire growth season.In late fall when the green chlorophyll begins to break down, the anthocyanin colorbecomes apparent in the red, pink and purple leaves that fall from most deciduous trees.The red-brown color observed and photographed in the Levittown leaves implies that theJune and July leaves, filled with green chlorophyll, were subjected to external radiation,presumably the beamed energy from the aerial craft, that provoked leaf production of thered, protective pigment anthocyanin usually associated with fall leaves, not summergrowth. If red and green paint are mixed, the outcome is a red-brown paint similar to thecolors on the privet leaves in Figures 1 and 2. Further, if the healthy summer privet leavesshow red-brown splotches of color, that suggests the beamed energy striking the upper andouter leaves of the privet and maple tree was considerably outside the normal range ofradiant energy plants experience from the sun. It is significant that the leaves mostexposed to the beamed energy and splotched with the red-brown color were exposed tothe sky. Those outer leaves protected other leaves growing underneath them.Continued in Part 3: More plant anomalies.Return to Part 1More Information:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I would appreciate hearing from other eyewitnesses of strange aerial light events in theUnited States and world.
