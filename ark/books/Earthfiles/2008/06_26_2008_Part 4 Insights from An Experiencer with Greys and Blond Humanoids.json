But after it landed, I was walking around looking at it thinking, ‘Oh, great, whaif this is not Zo.’ I got worried that it might be somebody else inside who wouldn’t careabout me. Zo told me there were visitors who were not friendly to humans on this world.So, I took off running and I heard in my mind, ‘Stop! This is Zo!’I turned around thinking it was a trick, but it was him. My heart was racing! I didn’t wantto be caught up in the field of that craft because it would hurt. I did not know how badly iwould hurt, but I had a good idea from what happened to my dog. The dog was really kindof whacked.I heard in my mind, ‘William, stop! This is Zo!’ I was concerned and my heart was racingturned around to look, still ready to bolt, and it looked like him. So, I started walking backtowards that direction. He walked towards me and it was Zo.I asked him, ‘What is this craft?’He said, ‘This is just another one of our ships.’ He walked up and put his hand on the sideThe craft opened and we went inside. This time there was a passage way to the right. Thiswas larger than a 30-foot-diameter ship. This craft was probably at least 50 feet indiameter."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"There was an opening and it went into this room and the room was circular. It was almostlike walking into a sunken living room because you walked in and you took a step downand you sat down. Your feet were on the floor and there in front of your feet - probablytwo feet in front of your knees - was this big, black cube. This was just a matte black, likecube box painted flat black paint.William's illustration of the black cube image projector surrounded by cushionedseating so close that the cube was only two feet from his knees. “The room was dimly lit,like a theater. The cube (about 4 feet by 4 feet by 4 feet) was matte black at first. Zo hada device in his left hand. When he touched this control, the cube seemed (to go)transparent with (3-D) images inside.” 1969 when William was sixteen."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Zo walked in and I walked in behind him. He asked me to step in there and sit downbecause he had something to show me. He sat down to my left. He had something in his lehand and with his thumb, he was pushing some buttons. The room went darker and withouany sound, as the room became darker, the cube became more glossy and then I could seedim images inside of it. It was as though I were seeing small lights inside this cube, whichbecame like looking at stars in a planetarium, for example.HOW BIG WAS THE CUBE?I would say it was 4 feet by 4 feet. He was showing me the Milky Way galaxy because itzoomed out from Earth to show the Milky Way galaxy. It showed where we were on Eartin the Milky Way galaxy and then zoomed in and showed different stars and they weredifferent colors. They were yellow and red and blue and green and some were like a blacklight color.A scorpion under a black light. In normal lightingthis scorpion appears black. Black lights are often usedto find scorpions in the wilderness.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Black light is the common name for a lampemitting electromagnetic radiation that is almost exclusively in the soft nearultraviolet range, without much visible light. Sometimes, this type of lighting ismore commonly referred to as UV light.”]Inside the black cube where the different colored stars were projected holographically, Zowas pointing out different stars, ‘These are places where there are people.’ And he showeme where he is from and where other beings are from. YOU UNDERSTOOD ZO WAS FROM WHERE?I understood that he is from a planet orbiting a star called Tau Ceti.WHICH IS ABOUT 12 LIGHT-YEARS FROM THE EARTH."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Illustration of our sun with dark sunspots on left is both larger and somewhat hotterthan the less active Tau Ceti about 12 light-years from Earth (right).Illustration © 2007 by R. J. Hall.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Tau Ceti is a star in the constellation Cetus thatis similar to the Sun in mass and spectral type. At just under 12 light years'distance from the Solar System, it is a relatively close star. Tau Ceti is metal-deficient and therefore, thought to be less likely to have rocky planets.Observations have detected more than ten times as much dust surrounding TauCeti as is present in our Solar System. Tau Ceti appears stable, with little stellarvariation. It can be seen with the unaided eye as a faint third-magnitude star.As seen from Tau Ceti, our Sun would be a 3rd-magnitude star in theconstellation Boötes.” ]Portion of modern star map of our local Milky Way galaxy neighborhoodthat contains more than a dozen similar Spectral Class G suns, which could support life.Our Sun (Sol) is at the edge of the group, which includes Tau Ceti and other suns such as82 Eridani, Gliese 86 and Zeta Reticuli 1 and 2, binary yellow suns.Reproduction from scanned image by Jeffrey Pratt.OK. Around this star, Tau Ceti, there were several planets and one of the planets was likeEarth.IS EVERYTHING YOU ARE SEEING INSIDE THE CUBE? WHERE IS ALL THISOCCURING?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Inside the cube. The cube has become very transparent at this point. You can look inside oit, kind of like looking at a TV. In one instance, I got up and moved around and thatchanged the perspective of my view, so it was like it was all being generatedholographically in three dimensions within the cube.DID HE SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THOSE PEOPLE AND THE RELATIONSHIP OFTAU CETI TO THE EARTH?What Zo told me was that people here on Earth did not originate here on Earth. Theyoriginated out there some place. Humankind had spread itself across this part of theuniverse and at some point in past time, something occurred and the humans kind of gotseparated. They lost the ability to stay connected.DID HE EXPLAIN WHAT THAT LOSS WAS?He said there was some pretty violent conflicts that took place because as these differentworlds matured, they started to develop their own idea of what was right and wrong, howthings should be done and so forth. There was like a central governing agency that wasoverseeing all these planets and there was kind of a civil war.So, this was the cube and it was many years later (1969 to 1998, twenty-nine years) that Iwould see something similar in Peru. It was a location near Lake Titicaca at 13,000 feetabove sea level in a strange outcropping of rock that the locals have called the “Doorwayof Aramu Muru.” Lake Titicaca is a lake located on the border of Bolivia and Peru. It sits 3,812 meters(12,507 feet) above sea level making it the highest commercially navigable lake in the world.By volume of water it is also the largest lake in South America with a maximum depth of 932 feet."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Lake Titicaca, Peru, with snow-covered Andes Mountains in background,as seen from Bolivian homes © 2007 by Vico Ricab. Doorway of Aramu Muru, or “Place of the Gods,” is at Lake Titicaca, Peru,near the Bolivian border. Local Peruvians revere the site and say it is where life was firstcreated on Earth. The carved doorway is said to lead to another dimension. Locals claimsome people have disappeared and reappeared near the door. Many are afraid toapproach the door. Some have noted strange, tall men accompanied byglowing balls of lights walk through the doorway. Image by William.I had been told by an old shaman, Pedro, that this was a passageway between worlds. I wavastly fascinated by it because of the other experiences I've had in my life. So, here we arthirty years later at Lake Titicaca in Peru. It was November 11, 1998, and at 11 o'clock inthe evening.Kathy, my wife, and a few folks who were with me and we all went to the doorway. I usethe techniques that Pedro had provided to me and managed to open this doorway and goinside for a brief time.Kathy was watching and the others were watching. They said I shimmered and glowed anthen I was gone. There was no physical opening of the door or anything like that. It's justthat I glowed for a moment and I was gone.What I saw was as if I were moving very, very rapidly through the universe. I was moving"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"at an incredible speed. There was a strange hissing sound that was associated with it aswell. Once it was finished, I was in this white room. And in this white room when I finally gotmy wits about myself, I turned and saw that there was a very large, black mass floating infront of me. This black mass had all these stars - these points of light.THIS IS SUSPENDED IN THE AIR IN FRONT OF YOU AND NOT IN A CUBE LIKEIN 1969 WITH ZO IN THE CRAFT?There in front of me was this large, gelatinous-looking mass that was just floating in the aiIt was different than what I had seen inside of the craft with Zo. What I saw here in thewhite room was not a 4-foot-square black object with a holographic display. Instead, it wasomething that might have been as large as a football field - large, undulating, black andinside of it were pinpoints of light. There were large and small lights. There were wisps oflight.There was a presence there and I never saw who this was. But in a short amount of time,the male voice explained to me that what I was looking at was an experiment that they haconducted in order to understand their place in the universe and this experiment was theirattempt to create a small universe to observe. And somehow - and I was not sure and amstill not sure - somehow I had emerged from that large, black mass, according to them.Once that explanation was finished, they insisted I needed to go back. I immediately founmyself drawn back into this large, black mass traveling back through space again andending up back at the Doorway of Aramu Muru.OK, WHAT YOU ARE IMPLYING IS THAT YOU WENT THROUGH A DOORWAY INPERU AND YOU WENT INTO ANOTHER DIMENSION, ANOTHER LARGER BOXOF CONSCIOUSNESS AROUND THIS WHOLE UNIVERSE?Yeah, that's the implication. I mean, it sounds just crazy, but when I was there in the whiteroom, they explained to me that they had tried to understand where they are in the schemof things. They were trying to understand the nature of their universe. In doing so, they hacreated this whatever it was, wherever I was at, and they created the environment thatwould replicate their concept of what the universe was like. It was being held floating inthe air and what they were surprised to discover is that as they watched it and it wasprogressing, small reactions were taking place inside that they eventually discovered werethe makings of stars inside of this mass. They then went into the mass in order tounderstand what they were seeing. How they went into it was not made clear to me. Butthey came to the conclusion that they created this small model of the universe, small tothem, but to us quite vast.They placed these doorways indifferent places around this universe in order to travel todifferent places.THE UNIVERSE THAT WE ARE IN ON THEIR SCALE WAS THIS FLOATINGGELATINOUS MASS INSIDE OF A ROOM THAT THEY WERE STUDYING.Right. As I got closer and closer to this large black mass, it was obvious to me that it wasreally quite large - perhaps the size of a football field, hanging there floating in the air. Thawas very disorienting. I asked, ‘Where am I?’ It didn't really give me a clear answer aboutwhere I was.WAS IT TELEPATHIC IN YOUR MIND OR VERBAL?It sounded verbal to me, but I never saw the person. I only heard their voice. It was a manvoice."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"And past a certain point, I couldn't tell how long I'd been away. That's when I really startebecoming concerned because this fellow was saying that the ‘universe’ I was looking atwas for them created a short time ago, but for us it was billions of years. The time insidethe mass is much different than time outside and that's when I started thinking about timeand wondering what I was going to do because I didn't know what to do! Kathy waswaiting for me, as were these other people and I had lost track of time. I knew that Kathywould be really worried. We had been married for only three or four months. I was gettingfrantic! It's one of those heart-racing moments where you just don't have any idea at allwhat direction to turn, what to think, what to do or even how you got to where you are.SO, WHAT HAPPENED?Well, they told me I had to go back, that there were others like myself who had managed tget through the doorway and had ended up there (in the white room) and they would helpme to go back. They told me to just walk towards it and then the next thing I know, it's likI'm floating and I closed my eyes because I was going quite rapidly and this hissing noiseoccurred and again, I was flying through space. They told me to stay focused on where Iwanted to go. So, I was focusing on Kathy.And as I'm flying through this panorama, it was not like there were stars everywhere, butthere were lights and tremendous noise in my ears - it was like a dozen tires all releasing aat the same time out of the valve stems.I eventually noticed there was one point of light that I was headed for that eventuallyturned out to be our sun and I saw the Earth and I was just going incredibly fast falling rigtowards the Earth. So, I closed my eyes, tensed up, and the next thing I knew the hissinghad stopped and I'm sitting inside of this rock chamber looking out of the doorway out atKathy and the others and Lake Titicaca in the distance. From their time frame, I was gonemaybe a minute. For me, I was gone quite a long time.”ontinued in Part 5More Information:For further information about the human abduction syndrome, please see my books and documein the Earthfiles Shop and in the Earthfiles Archive:• 06/15/2008 — Part 3: Insights from An Experiencer with Greys and Blond Humanoids• 06/13/2008 — Part 2: Insights from An Experiencer with Greys and Blond Humanoids• 05/20/2008 — High Strangeness in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada• 04/29/2008 — Part 1: Insights from An Experiencer with Greys and Blond Humanoids• 04/06/2008 — Final Part 10: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 04/02/2008 — Part 9 - Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/30/2008 — Part 8 - Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/20/2008 — Part 7 - Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/15/2008 — Part 6 - Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/08/2008 — Part 5: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/04/2008 — Part 4: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/03/2008 — Updated Part 1: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/02/2008 — Part 2: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/02/2008 — Part 3: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 02/22/2008 — Updated: Three Eyewitnesses in Selden, Texas, Saw Two, Large Rectangles of “WhiteFlames” in Sky• 02/14/2008 — Update: Mysterious Symbols Projected in Night Sky by Aerial Disc Near Stephenville, TexaLocal Airport• 02/08/2008 — Law Officers Describe Unidentified Shape-Shifting Aerial Craft in Stephenville, Texas,Region• 01/28/2008 — Updated 01-28-08: Viewer Letters About Aerial Craft and Military Flyovers Above DublinStephenville and Selden, Texas• 01/18/2008 — Updated: Huge Aerial Craft Over Dublin, Texas, “Longer Than 3 Football Fields”• 01/07/2008 — Part 15: In League With A UFO• 12/22/2007 — Part 10: In League With A UFO• 12/16/2007 — Part 8: In League With A UFO• 12/14/2007 — Part 7: In League With A UFO• 12/11/2007 — More Confirmation of May 1974 Discs in Albuquerque and Huge Cylinder Craft At White"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Sands Proving Ground.• 11/25/2007 — Part 4: In League With A UFO• 09/16/2007 — Part 5: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/11/2007 — Part 4: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/07/2007 — Part 3: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/05/2007 — Part 2: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 08/31/2007 — Part 1: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured!• 08/31/2007 — Part 2: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured!• 08/30/2007 — Part 1: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 07/31/2007 — Part 2, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards• 06/26/2007 — Part 1: Explanation of the Recent \"Strange Craft\" Sightings• 05/11/2007 — CIA Origin of National Enquirer?• 03/16/2007 — Tenth Anniversary of March 1997 Phoenix Lights: What Was the 2-Mile-Long TriangularCraft?• 02/18/2007 — Part 4: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers andListeners• 02/15/2007 — Grey Non-Human Floats in Air At New Orleans Defense Contractor Site• 02/14/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers andListeners• 02/12/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers andListeners• 02/11/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers andListeners• 01/26/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans• 01/26/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans• 01/26/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans• 01/08/2007 — Updated: Attorney Describes His Encounter with Non-Human Entities• 12/14/2006 — Abductee Jim Sparks's Encounter with Reptillian Beings, Their Warning and Possible Agen• 10/11/2006 — Part 2: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee• 10/08/2006 — Part 1: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee• 09/29/2006 — Manipulation of Time and Matter by Non-Humans: The Experiences of Jim Sparks• 09/05/2006 — Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 09/04/2006 — Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 07/28/2006 — 1940s USAF Flight Surgeon's Account of E.
