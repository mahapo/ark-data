May 19, 2008 Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada - This past week I have been in theOkanagan Lake region of British Columbia, Canada, about two hours north of Spokane,Washington. Okanagan Lake runs north and south for 90 miles and is famous in Canada asone of the warmest and driest regions where grape vineyards, fruit trees and all kinds ofberries grow. Okanagan Lake itself is famous for high strangeness. The Native AmericanIndians said there was an “Ogopogo” in the lake, which translates as “lake monster.” Noone has produced public photographs of the creature, but alleged eyewitnesses havesketched three or four snake-like loops breaking the water that look very similar to theLoch Ness monster illustrations in Scotland."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"This photo, taken in 1972, seems to show the Loch Ness Monstermoving toward the right with its hump protruding well above the surfaceand its mouth open, Loch Ness, Scotland Highlands.A statue of the Lake Okanagan “Ogopogo” in a Kelowna,British Columbia, Canada, park.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Ogopogo of Lake Okanagan was described byNative Indians as a N'ha-a-itk, or lake demon, living in the lake long beforewhite men arrived. In modern times, Ogopogo sightings are reported each yearof a creature some 20 to 50 feet long, with a horse shaped head and anundulating serpent like body. Sightings have been reported throughout thelength of the lake, but the monster appears to favor an area just south ofKelowna in waters near Peachland. It is usually reported as dark blue, blackor brown with a lighter underside. It can move with astounding speed, butmany sightings in calm weather have been made of the creature apparentlyfeeding on either fish or aquatic weeds. People very close, between 50 and100 feet, report seeing fins or feet on the animal.” ] July 2, 2007:UFO War Over Lake Okanagan?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Lake Okanagan from Kelowna, B. C. downtown park.Image © 2008 by Linda Moulton Howe.Only one year ago on Monday, July 2, 2007, around 10:45 to 11 PM, several eyewitnessesfrom the Kelowna to Winfield region of Lake Okanagan saw differently shaped aerialcraft, which seemed to be at war with each other. One July 2nd, Kelowna eyewitnessreported that around 10:45 PM, “I saw two objects in the sky just hovering. One craft wasthin and long. The other was triangular in shape. They kept hovering there so I got upquickly to run and grab my camera. But the next thing I know before I take any photos, Ihear a small bang, almost like a gunshot. The long object begins to hurtle towards earth onfire, making a deep bass sound like a nuclear generator. And I’m thinking to myself, ‘Whatthe hell?!’“I watched the falling object and it disappeared at low altitude behind a small hill betweenmy neighborhood and the lake. I look up and see the triangular object make a small circlein the sky and then come a little lower and then I see it start to hurtle towards the sky at afast rate.“Then the long thing reappears from behind the hill. It’s no longer on fire and it’sascending at breakneck speed and it gets higher going after the triangle-shaped object. Isee the long thing literally shoot something at the triangle object and then a very loud bangand then the triangular craft was no longer visible. The long thing started to search the sky.It was going north, the south, then east and west – very quickly, almost like a hummingbirdwhen it goes side-to-side. “Then the object disappeared and I suppose its departure broke the sound barrier becauseimmediately I heard that sonic boom when the sound barrier is broken. After my manyyears of watching the skies, I finally saw what seemed like two E. T.s duking it out.”Fifteen minutes later at 11 PM, another eyewitness of warring UFOs in Westbank nearKelowna also saw a flaming object splash into Lake Okanagan and from there, rose backout of the water chasing after another aerial object in the sky. It is assumed that theeyewitnesses were watching the same astounding event, but estimated the two differenttimes of 10:45 and 11 PM.A woman walking her dog said that it looked like a “ torpedo on fire crashed into the lakeand created a big splash of water.” She also heard a loud, base “womp, womp, womp”sound as the fiery torpedo came down. That woman emailed Brian Vike of Houston,British Columbia UFO Research and she wrote: “I don’t know what happened last night,but it was the most frightening, incredible and down right terrifying thing I have everseen.” She described the fiery torpedo - that the other person called “long” – falling intothe lake and then explained, “it, or something, came literally shooting back out of thewater and I saw it hurtle towards a different-looking object very high in the sky.” Thewoman said the higher object she saw looked cone-shaped. In her email, she wrote: “I sawwhat looked like you see in a Star Wars movie and they have bullets or lasers that are kindof blasting out of things (that were) coming from that torpedo-object that was in the lakeand I heard a loud bang that knocked me off my feet. I looked up to see what the heck wasgoing on and the cone-shaped object was gone and the torpedo-shaped craft was justhovering, moving from side-to-side, almost like it was confused. Then there was a loudsonic boom and it was gone.”Other strange aerial objects over Lake Okanagan, Black Mountain and other sites in theregion were reported into September 2007. But a spokesman for Navigation Canada said,“There were no radar reports of unusual craft in the area.”"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Corina Saebels, Kelowna Residentand UFO ExperiencerCorina Saebels, Kelowna resident, experiencer in the UFO human abduction syndromeand author of The Collectors © 2007.

Corina wasborn in Brussels, Belgium, on August 14, 1956. By age five, in 1961, Corina’s parents hadmoved to Montreal, Canada, where she had her first encounter with large-eyed greybeings, which were to follow her the rest of her life to date, including after she moved toKelowna in 1994 with her own daughter, Nicole (now 20), and two sons, Chris (now 23)and Michael (now 25). Corina Saebels is the author of a 2007 book entitled, TheCollectors.I met with her and Nicole in Kelowna, B. C., in the week of May 12-16, 2008, and I askedCorina why she titled her 2007 book The Collectors?Order from: Corina Saebels.Interview:Corina Saebels, Author, The Collectors © 2007, Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada:“Because that’s what these beings have done our whole lives. My children and I have beenvisited by them, starting with me at about the age of five. They have come and collectedblood samples, eggs, sperm from my son, hair samples, and they have even removedfetuses from my daughter and myself."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WE’VE HEARD THE DESCRIPTION OF WHAT SOME PEOPLE CALL A GENETICHARVEST FROM HUMANS GOING BACK AT LEAST 30 TO 35 YEARS. TODAY, ATAGE 51 GOING BACK TO YOUR FIRST ENCOUNTER AT AGE 5, WHAT IS YOURPERSPECTIVE TODAY ABOUT WHY THESE BEINGS WOULD BE HARVESTINGAND COLLECTING GENETIC MATERIAL FROM YOU AND OTHERS?There are many different ideas about why these beings are doing this. Perhaps thenon-humans have done so many genetic things with themselves, including cloning, thatthere is something we humans have that they have lost? I think they need to create a newhybrid race, which is part them and part us that perhaps is going to help them regeneratetheir own race. But who knows? I don’t really have a definite answer.WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT IT WAS LESS THAN A YEAR AGO IN JULY 2007,THAT OVER YOUR HOME TOWN OF KELOWNA AND LAKE OKANAGAN,THERE WERE OTHER RESIDENTS WHO SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE ACONFLICT BETWEEN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECTS OF DIFFERENT SHAPES. WHATSPECULATION DO YOU HAVE ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BE GOING ON?Either they were two different kinds of ships and beings and they were actually having anaggressive interaction with each other? Or possibly, it could be like what happened to myson, Chris, in the Peachland area a few years ago when he woke up in the middle of thenight and saw a ship, was taken by some beings, which looked like greys and had what hedescribed as suction cups on the ends of their fingertips.Draw ing of grey being w ith suction cup fingertipsby Chris Saebels in 1995 at age 10.As my son was outside being taken into a craft, he said when he looked up, he saw anothercraft. There is a drawing of this in my book.Drawing of two different craft by Chris Saebels in 1995 at age 10.He told his mom, Corina, that the aerial object in the upper right had “bad ones” in it.The foreground craft were the grey beings that had come for him before the “bad ones”showed up.

The grey ones were bad, but the other ones were even worse.But the other greys got to me first.”So, it was not just one race that we were dealing with. It was actually two races and maybethat is part of that aggressive interaction. Maybe they were here to pick up someone (lastJuly)?DID CHRIS SAY WHY HE THOUGHT THE OTHER SPECIES WAS ‘BAD’?No, he did not have a feeling or knowledge about why the other ones were bad. He justsaid, ‘I have a feeling. I just know. I don’t know how, Mum, but I know these beings werevery bad and had they gotten me first, I probably would not have been returned to you.’That was his intuitive feeling. July 31, 2003: Conscious Night Encounterwith Grey EntitiesFOR PEOPLE WHO MIGHT THINK THAT THE ABDUCTION SYNDROME IS NOTHAPPENING NOW, COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT HAPPENED IN 2003? I WENTWITH YOU ON MAY 14, ALONG WITH NICOLE AND JOAN PEARSON OFCANADIAN QUESTERS, TO A ROAD AT A LANDFILL IN KELOWNA SO WECOULD SEE WHERE YOU AND A FRIEND HAD A REMARKABLE EXPERIENCE.Yes, it was July 31, 2003, and my girlfriend’s daughter had come up from Vancouver toKelowna to look at apartments and for a job. She was trying to move here. We were on thecomputer that night, about five minutes to midnight. It was the night before she wassupposed to go back to Vancouver. Quite suddenly she said out of the blue, ‘Let’s go stargazing.’ But I said to her that I was really tired and that she was leaving early in themorning, so why not put it off? ‘Why don’t we do it next time you come up here?’But she felt very strongly about it and said, ‘No, we’re going!’ So, it was midnight whenwe left my apartment and found ourselves going up into the Glenmore area, which is onthe outskirts of town and close to a landfill. But I did not realize that at the time. I justknew there were not many lights out there while we were driving.However, the car traffic was quite heavy and I told her that I wanted to pull over to theside of the road, but because there was so much traffic we would not be able to do muchstargazing. No sooner did I say that than suddenly there was no more traffic. The roadwent completely dead. That night, there was no moon and there were no street or houselights out there, so it was very, very black. There was nothing but a blanket of stars. So,then I pulled over to the right side of the road and we got out of the car right away. Shehad the binoculars and I had a million and a half candlelight to check for cougars and bearsbecause I had heard over the news that there had been sightings of animals recently on theoutskirts of Kelowna. I checked for animals and there was nothing.I turned off the light and she looked up to the sky and right away she said to me, ‘Oh,there are three stars up here in kind of a triangle shape. And they are moving aroundtogether, but erratically. Do satellites do that?’I told her, ‘No, a satellite is usually one light and it goes kind of steady.Then she said, ‘Wait, it’s just changed!’ As she said that – the air was quite hot that nightbecause it was July and very dry. But all of a sudden, the air turned quite cold and musky-smelling. All the coyotes everywhere were just howling like crazy! Then maybe within afew seconds, everything went dead quiet, the air changed and she said the stars hadchanged into what looked like a bright neon green colored ball or sphere. And then shesaid, ‘No, it’s an oval. Now it’s a sphere.’And I asked, ‘What is it?!’ because I had been handling the light and didn’t know exactlywhere she was looking.She said, ‘Now, it’s staying a sphere. Just look up.’By then, when I looked up, I could see the glowing light above the car, maybe 150 feet up.At that point, I knew it was not just an airplane or a helicopter. I had a strong feeling wewere in trouble. Something was not right. So, I grabbed my million and a half candlelight tocheck the area around us. I just felt fear. When I turned the light on, it was aimed in frontof the car about 40 to 45 feet away to the left side of the road where two bushes were sideby side. And there we saw five sets of eyes. I quickly realized the eyes were much biggerthan deer or animal eyes and that we were in trouble. I knew what was standing in front of"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"us.Corina Saebels pointing on May 14, 2008, at the two bushes across the roadfrom the Kelowna landfill where she and her friend saw five grey beings with large,black eyes first standing and then moving across the road toward them.Image © 2008 by Linda Moulton Howe.So, one started coming towards me because my next recollection is the eyes being muchcloser to me. I was trying to get back into the car, but I couldn’t seem to move very well. Itwas like going through quick sand and going in slow motion. Finally, I tried to yell to myfriend to get back in the car, but my voice was only a whisper. I don’t know if it was terroror what, but I definitely had a problem with my voice. I also felt such bad chest pains, Ithought I was having a heart attack from the terror of having these things coming at us.Next thing I know, we’re both climbing into the car and I was trying to turn the car on andit would not start. It took about half a dozen clicks in the ignition before the car finallystarted. I did a quick U-turn across the road and we started back toward Kelowna as fast asI could go.But then, my friend yells at me to pull over, ‘Stop, stop, stop! You’ve got to stop!’So, I pulled the car over to the side of the road and she said, ‘Something is wrong. We justgot here.’Looking at her watch, she said, ‘It’s after 1 AM.’I said, ‘That’s ridiculous! We haven’t been here an hour.’ And we still can’t rememberwhat happened after the eyes came toward us.YOU TWO HAVE AN HOUR OF MISSING TIME IN 2003 AFTER PHYSICALINTERACTION WITH BEINGS THAT BOTH OF YOU SAW IN A STRANGEALTERED STATE. BUT BY 2003, YOU HAD ALREADY HAD A COMPLETEHYSTERECTOMY AFTER YEARS OF FEMALE ORGAN PROBLEMS WHICH YOUTHINK WERE THE RESULT OF FETUS EXTRACTIONS FROM YOU BY THENON-HUMAN BEINGS?WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THOSE PARTICULAR GREY-COLORED BEINGSWOULD COME BACK INTO YOUR LIFE AT AGE 46 AFTER YOURGYNECOLOGICAL ORGANS ARE GONE? WHAT DO YOU THINK IS HAPPENINGWHEN THE BEINGS STAY IN YOUR LIFE AT THIS STAGE?One of the things that I was told by a doctor is that my daughter, Nicole, and I have a veryrare blood type. Are the beings coming back for more blood? I’m not sure. [ Editor’sNote: Corina is RH Negative O. Nicole is RH Negative A.]"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" But even after my hysterectomy, I actually believe that these beings do not need a uterus.They just need us human females like an incubator. They have a way of implanting somefetuses inside us for the period that they need – usually 3 to 3.5 months and sometimes upto 4 months. Then the beings come and collect that fetus.I REMEMBER HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH JOHN ALTSHULER, M. D.,HEMATOLOGIST AND PATHOLOGIST (NOW DECEASED) ABOUT WHETHERHUMAN DOCTORS COULD PROVE THAT A PERSON WAS A HUMAN AND E. T.HYBRID BY ANALYZING THE BLOOD TYPE. THE QUESTION AROSE BECAUSESOME PEOPLE IN THE HUMAN ABDUCTION SYNDROME REPORTED BEINGSHOWN OR TOLD THAT RH NEGATIVE BLOOD WAS PROOF OF SUCHHYBRIDIZATION.DR.

Missing Pregnancies and Hybrid InfantsFOR YOU AND NICOLE, HOW MANY DOCUMENTED MISSING PREGNANCIESHAVE EACH OF YOU HAD?My 20-year-old daughter, Nicole, has had two missing pregnancies. For myself, one forsure that has been documented and possible three more when I was much younger when Ihad no concept of such a phenomenon linked to the extraterrestrial presence. In each case,I seemed to be pregnant for about 3.5 months and then suddenly, there would be no fetus.I do remember in two specific disappearing pregnancies, I did not even go to the hospitalbecause I didn’t think the doctors would believe me at the time.BACK TO YOUR AGE FIVE, YOU MOVED FROM BELGIUM TO MONTREAL,CANADA.

Source: Page 22,The Collectors © 2007 by Corina Saebels.I remember one night that a bright, bluish-white light came through my bedroom windowand a being came in my room. My next recollection is that I’m in a strange, circular roomwith subdued lighting, it was kind of dark. I had my nightie on and I was sitting on a verycold, metal table, which seemed to be hovering in the air. The table did not appear to havelegs. In front of me was a very smooth, curved wall with a protruding ledge. The next thingI see on the ledge is a strange-looking fetus or infant. It had a large head, very skinnybody, the ears were barely noticeable, a very small nose – only two nostrils in a tiny bump.There was a slit for a mouth and the eyes were not like the grey beings and not like ourhuman eyes. The iris and pupil part were round like ours was surrounded by some white,but the whole pupil and iris were the same color. It was a light blue, but a blue I don’tknow how to describe.The little infant seemed so lethargic to me that I had mixed emotions. It was so scary-looking to me as a child that I was afraid of it. But I got a sense that I was supposed to helpit somehow. There were not any clothes on the infant. I did not see a sexual organ oranything. It was naked. It had no blanket. It was just lying there on the ledge, lookinglethargic like it was going to die.I was terrified, but I wanted to help the child and the next thing I know, the baby is gone.And then there is a very tall, scary-looking being coming through the shadows. I had thesense that he was a doctor. But that’s all I remember.SOME ABDUCTEES THAT I’VE INTERVIEWED OVER THE YEARS HAVESUGGESTED TWO THINGS:1) THE NON-HUMAN BEINGS ARE LOOKING TO HUMANS TO HAVECOMPASSION FOR THE HYBRIDS – THAT THE ACT OF COMPASSION IS ANEMOTION THEY ARE MEASURING OR USING.2) SOME ABDUCTEES HAVE SAID, ‘AS SCARY AS IT HAS BEEN, I HAVE FELTTHAT I SHOULD FEEL SORRY FOR THE BEINGS THAT ARE HAVING TO DO THIS,AS IF THERE IS A SURVIVAL ISSUE THE GREY BEINGS HAVE AND THAT IS WHYTHE ALIENS ARE FORCING AN ARTIFICIALLY ACCELERATED MERGING OFTWO SPECIES. AS I SAY THAT TO YOU, INTUITIVELY WHAT DO YOU FEEL IN2008?Our own experiences (hers and children) have been very negative and painful. Mychildren still have scars remaining on their bodies from the radiation burns, the cuts, theholes. So, for me, it is very difficult. I’m torn, to be very honest. But the hybrids – not thegrey beings – that I’ve been shown are the ones I feel sorry for.WHY?Because they don’t really belong to their world or our world. There is the question: whoare their parents? Us? Them? Who looks after the hybrid children? Who nurtures them?Those young hybrids don’t seem to have very much emotion. When a baby cries, your firstinstinct is to go and pick it up and pacify it, nurture it, do something. But these littlehybrids just seem to be on their own. That feels sad to me."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"INTUITIVELY, IF YOU WERE SAYING NOW WHERE YOU THINK THE HYBRIDSARE GOING TO BE PLACED TO LIVE AND TO WORK, WOULD IT BE HERE ONEARTH OR SOME PLACE ELSE?I’m not sure, but I think on an intuitive level, I believe they will be taken to some otherplace beyond Earth. I’m just guessing here.THAT WOULD MEAN THAT PERHAPS THE GENETIC HARVEST OF EARTH IS TOPERPETUATE LIFE SOMEWHERE ELSE.
