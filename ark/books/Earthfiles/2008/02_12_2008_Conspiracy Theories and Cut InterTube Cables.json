February 12, 2008 Palos Heights, Illinois - Robert A. Kezelis received his law degreefrom John Marshall Law School in Chicago, Illinois, in 1986. During the past twenty-twoyears, Attorney Kezelis has studied international politics and behind-the-scenes intriguesthat lead to wars. In addition to his law practice in Palos Heights, Illinois, Robert Kezelis isa regular contributor to the politically sassy CapitolHillBlue.com, whose motto at the topof its web page reads: “Because nobody's life, liberty or property is safe while Congress isin session or the White House is occupied.”On February 10, 2008, Attorney Kezelis submitted his commentary to CapitolHillBlue.comabout the recent February 1 through 4, 2008, international news that at least four (possiblynine, according to author and political science researcher, Richard Sauder, Ph.D.)undersea fiber optic cables had been cut in the Middle East, which I reported at Earthfiles:“February 4, 2008 - Fourth Undersea Fiber Optic Cable Cut.Cable linking Qatar to the United Arab Emirates was damagedon Sunday, February 3, causing more telecommunicationdisruptions.Egypt's Communications Ministry reported Sunday that damage to theundersea internet cables in the Mediterranean was not caused by ship anchors,as previously speculated. In fact, the Egyptian transport ministry said thatonshore video cameras at the location of the damaged cables did not show anyship traffic in the area when the communication cables were damaged.Third damaged cable on Friday, February 1, 2008, is called Falcon andprovides communication to countries in the Mediterranean and Gulf regions,according to Dow Jones Newswires. On Thursday, January 31, 2008, twoother undersea fiber optic cables owned by Flag Telecom and consortiumSeaMeWe-4 between Alexandria, Egypt and Palermo, Italy, were cut -according to Du, a state-owned Dubai telecom provider. Stephan Beckert, ananalyst with TeleGeography, told CNN the first two damaged cables providethe majority of international communications between Europe and the MiddleEast.Cause? With public communications cut off in Iran and other Middle Eastregions, a geopolitical speculation is that cutting major undersea fiber opticcommunication cables is deliberate sabotage before some unknown upcomingevent in the Middle East or elsewhere.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" February 10, 2008“Conspiracy Theories and Cut InterTube Cables”© 2008 by Robert Kezelis, AttorneyPalos Heights, Illinoisand Contributor, CapitolHillBlue.com“Truth is stranger than fiction, reality is weirder than any drug inducedHunter S. Thompson fairy tale, and sometimes obvious facts are so bad thatthe mind chooses to ignore what the eyes see right front and center.In 1985, FBI agent Robert Hanssen began spying for the USSR, just 6 yearsbefore its collapse. One of the secrets he sold to them was the fact that aspecial ops submarine managed to tap the most important USSR militaryundersea cable in existence. The sub did this not once, but repeatedly, comingback to pick up the recorded tapes, and to replace, even upgrade the tappingequipment.The exact dates of tapping and the results of that spying are murky, but by thefew, reliable accounts that discussed that op, it was incredibly successful.In 2001, after the attack by Saudi, Yemeni and other extremists, Iran initiatedcontact with the US, attempting to coordinate and deal once and for all withthe Taliban and the hated Al Qaida. Iran had as much distaste for AQ as theUS did.Bush, with the vainglorious advice of Dick Cheney, and the truly inaneinsights of Condi Rice, rejected all contact. Bush followed up that rejection bylabeling Iran part of the Axis of Evil.Iran was understandably chagrined. The moderate leaders, who had pushedfor more contact and cooperation, lost face, and worse, because of the USmoves, they also lost control, allowing the more conservative forces to extendtheir power.Iran decided to do more than simply react, they decided to take other steps tolimit the damage that America could do to Iran. Their first step? Cuttingeconomic ties. However, they were not the first to try.‘The man that actually did demand Euro for his oil was SaddamHussein in 2000. At first, his demand was met with ridicule, laterwith neglect, but as it became clearer that he meant business,political pressure was exerted to change his mind. When othercountries, like Iran, wanted payment in other currencies, mostnotably Euro and Yen, the danger to the dollar was clear andpresent, and a punitive action was in order. Bush’s Shock-and-Awe in Iraq was not about Saddam’s nuclear capabilities,about defending human rights, about spreading democracy, oreven about seizing oil fields; it was about defending the dollar,ergo the American Empire.’ Source:http://www.energybulletin.net/12125.htmlThis month, Iran was supposed to open its own bourse, trading oil and oilfutures in Euros and other currencies, but not the dollar. Delinking oil fromthe dollar would protect Iran from Bush's spendthrift invasion and occupationof Iraq, and the resulting collapse of the US dollar.Being a high tech project, the tubes of the internets would play a vital role inthis new market. And behold, four major cables linking the Middle East to therest of the world were severed, all within one week. Some ignorant US sourcesdutifully tried to blame it on ‘ship anchors,’ but even the Egyptians refused togo along with that bogus spin. Not only were two cables away from anyshipping lines, no ships had passed through there at the time of the disruption.Looking at the flotsam and jetsam that used to be the ancient and proudcountry of Iraq, replaced by a Green Zone which now sits next to the world'slargest open sewer, one might suspect that decoupling oil from the dollarmight incite a strong reaction by certain elements deep within the US powerstructure.US submarine technology has not stayed static since the 1970s.

As we learnedlast year from AT&T, tapping every single communication within a phonecompany is not all that hard, not for the NSA, CIA, and with the tacit supportof your DOJ and White House.How much of a stretch is it to add 2+2? Either the Israelis or the US, severedthe intertubes providing Iran with internet access, and in the process, tappedthe lines with hi-tech links, either before or during the repair process.He who controls information flow, controls pretty much everything.
