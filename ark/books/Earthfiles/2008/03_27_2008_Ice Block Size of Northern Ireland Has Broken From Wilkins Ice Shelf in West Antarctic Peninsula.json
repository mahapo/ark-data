We believe the Wilkins has been in place for at least a fewhundred years. But warm air and exposure to ocean waves are causing a break-up.” - Ted Scambos, Ph.D., Glaciologist, University of Colorado"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Above and below satellite images of the Wilkins Ice Shelf in the West Antarctic Peninsulawhere a huge 160-square-mile-chunk of ice disintegrated between February 28 and March 8, 2008.The ice section that broke away measured 25-miles-long (41 kilometers) by 1.5-miles-wide(2.5 kilometers).

Image courtesy NSIDC. March 27, 2008 Boulder, Colorado - In West Antarctica on March 8, 2008, at theWilkins Ice Shelf which floats on the Pacific Ocean not far from the southern tip of SouthAmerica, a slab of ice as large as Northern Ireland broke off. The 160-square-mile icechunk had been there for perhaps 1,500 years. But between February 28 and March 8,2008, NASA’s Earth Observing System Aqua and Terra satellites photographed theWilkins’ disintegration.Scientists say global warming continues to melt down West Antarctica faster than evencomputer models predicted. The rest of the Wilkins Ice Shelf, which now will likely breakup as well, is held back by only one narrow band of ice. After that collapses, more WilkinsIce Shelf will be vulnerable to melting, eventually leading to the ice that is on top ofAntarctic land. If that land-based ice ever goes into the ocean, sea levels will rise rapidly.The Wilkins Ice Shelf is one of many that have collapsed in the West Antarctic Peninsulaover the past thirty years. For example, the gigantic Larsen B disappeared in one month’stime in 2002. In March 2008, the United Nations Environment Program reported that 29glaciers around the world lost ice at record levels in 2006. The U. N. report warns that theloss of Himalayan glaciers would mean many glacier-fed rivers in India and the region willeventually dry up. What happens to the humans and animals dependent upon those rivers - not only in India but wherever mountain glaciers melt away?This week I talked with Ted Scambos, Ph.D., Glaciologist at the University of Colorado’sNational Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) in Boulder – one of the agencies thatmonitors and analyzes the satellite imagery. I asked Prof. Scambos how long he thinks therest of the Wilkins ice shelf will last.Interview:Ted Scambos, Ph.D., Glaciologist,NSIDC, University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado.Ted Scambos, Ph.D., Glaciologist, National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC),University of Colorado, Boulder, Colorado: “What’s left is an ice shelf that has a verynarrow band of ice propping up a much larger area the size of Connecticut, which wesuspect will disintegrate probably next year or in the next few years and put the rest of theother large plate of ice at further risk."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"March 8, 2008, graphic overlay of Wilkins Ice Shelf by NSIDC. Antarctic Western Peninsula, Alaska and Central Siberia AreThree Fastest Warming Areas On Earth“..about 5 to 10 times as fast as the global mean.That is about 1 degree F. per decade. So, in a decade, those sitessee as much warming as North America saw in the past century.”IS IT TRUE THAT ANTARCTICA AND SOME PORTIONS OF ALASKA AND THEARCTIC ARE THE MOST RAPIDLY WARMING PARTS OF THE EARTH?Yes, that’s absolutely true. Alaska, central Siberia and the Antarctic peninsula are the threefastest warming areas – about 5 to 10 times as fast as the global mean. That is about 1degree F. per decade. So, in a decade, those sites see as much warming as North Americasaw in the past century.IN GLOBAL WARMING, WHY IS IT THAT THE POLES WARM THE FASTEST?The poles have an interesting amplification going on related to global warming and that’srelated to the fact that there is lots of ice there. The amplification happened in those areaswhere the ice is close to the melting point. In the northern parts of Antarctica where thepeninsula sticks out toward South America or in the southern fringes of the Arctic – lowerelevations in the Arctic like the coast of Greenland – we’re seeing very rapid changesbecause a small amount of warming represents the difference between a snow-coveredland area or an ice-covered ocean that has dark open waters or ground. That darkeningthat comes with the loss of the snow and ice amplifies the warming trend because darksurfaces absorb a lot of solar energy.IN A WAY, IT CREATES A PARADOX THAT THE TWO COLDEST PLACES ON THEPLANET TRADITIONALLY WOULD BE THE PLACES THAT WARM THE FASTESTIN GLOBAL WARMING.That’s true. And they are also where things change the fastest during the onset of an iceage. It gives us some optimism that if we can turn around the current trend towardswarming by adjusting greenhouse gases or soot in the atmosphere or other manmade forglobal warming, at least some components of the Arctic and Antarctic systems couldrespond fairly quickly. The longer we wait, though, the more heat we put into the system.Once glaciers accelerate, they are not subject to the flip side of the amplification I wastalking about, so the system gets harder and harder to stop. We have a much longer run outwith this heat that’s been trapped from one century carrying over into other centuries. La Nina Cooled Northern Hemispherein Winter 2007-2008ON THE INTERNET, GLOBAL WARMING SKEPTICS POINT TO THIS HARSHWINTER OF 2007-2008 AS EVIDENCE THAT THE PLANET’S TEMPERATURESARE NO LONGER RISING, AS THE CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS SUGGESTWOULD BE THE CASE. COULD WE BE MOVING INTO A PERIOD OF GLOBALCOOLING?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"No, it’s very unlikely. The main reason we’ve seen a downward trend in globaltemperatures in just the last few months, a significant downward trend that is fairly abruptand large, is mostly related to the La Nina event in the Pacific and how that propagatesthroughout the Earth’s climate system. The current cooling trend is a blip. The forcing ofwarming by greenhouse gases are still there. We’ll see this (cooling) turn around and Ithink we’ll see some significant events indicating that the general warmth on Earth iscontinuing, including this Wilkins ice shelf event - but also with things we anticipate mighthappen in the Arctic in the coming summer or two. In fact, even though the temperatelatitudes of the Northern Hemisphere had a pretty cold winter, there are many other areason Earth that did have unusually warm conditions. Central Antarctica and the Wilkins areahad quite a warm 2007.In fact, if you look at the high Arctic, it was slightly warmer than average this past winter.So, we’re in no way fooled by the downward trend because the Earth’s climate system is anoisy one – much like the stock market. You know when you’ve got a Bull market versus aBear market, even though there might be jumps from day-to-day or month-to-month thattry to indicate otherwise.SO, IF LA NINA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE DOWN TEMPERATURES, COULD YOUEXPLAIN FOR A GENERAL NORTH AMERICAN AUDIENCE EXACTLY WHAT LANINA IS AND WHY IT COOLS TEMPERATURES?La Nina is a general cooling of the central Pacific and the areas to the west of SouthAmerica. It’s a very large area where cooler waters merge onto the surface and thatpropagates how it influences weather patterns, the tracks of low pressure systems aroundthe globe. It’s been associated with cooling trends in past years when there have beenmoderate to strong La Nina events. I believe the current La Nina is coming to a close,actually, and we’ll see what happens next, but I very much doubt that the cooling trendcould persist.WHAT DO YOU EXPECT THIS SUMMER AND GOING INTO 2009 TO BE LIKE?That’s a little hard to say. I think the Arctic is still poised for some very abrupt retreats thissummer, despite the fact that the ice grew back – as it always does – in winter. It cameback a little bit more than the previous winter, but our models and measurements showthat the ice is very thin. There is a good chance that most of the ice that grew back willmelt off again this summer.The long-term trend is inescapably a warming one. That’s because we have an obvious andinarguable forcing coming from greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. They are there. Weknow how they work. We know they are having this heat-trapping effect. We’ve detecteda very strong warming trend throughout many of the Earth’s systems that is consistent withthe trapping of greenhouse gases, particularly since about 1975. Quiet Sun Changing Earth Temperatures?IS IT POSSIBLE THAT WHAT IS BEING CALLED THE ‘NAKED SUN,’ OR QUIETSUN CURRENTLY AS IT PASSED ITS MINIMUM AND IS SUPPOSED TO BESTARTING IN THE NEXT SOLAR CYCLE. THERE HAVE NOT BEEN SUNSPOTSFOR QUITE AWHILE. THE SUN MIGHT GO THROUGH 2008 AS A VERY QUIETSUN. COULD THIS HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH PERTURBATIONS INTEMPERATURES ON THE EARTH?There’s a debate about that actually. It’s a good question. Some folks have said that the netlowering of energy during the quiet sun cycle - the effect is about a fifth of greenhousegases and in the opposite direction. The sun is producing about one-third of a watt less persquare meter. Greenhouse gases are contributing 1.5 to 2 watts per square meter all overthe Earth. The sun delivers 1300 watts per square meter to the Earth.ISN’T ONE OF THE BIG PROBLEMS WE’RE ALL GOING TO BE FACING IN ONLYANOTHER TEN TO TWENTY YEARS IS THAT WITHOUT GLACIERS INMOUNTAINS, THERE WON'T BE WATER FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE AND ANIMALS?It's true. Water shortages will be one of the first problems to come out of global warmingthat will effect people. Drought in the American southwest, drought in southern Europe, achange in areas that depend on mountain glaciers like central Asia, like many parts of theRockies. They depend on water from snow pack as a way of storing and moderating howtheir water cycle interacts with the needs of agriculture and cities, the people who livethere. These will be big challenges, the first of many that will come out as a result ofclimate change."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" 7 to 8 Degrees F. Increase in AverageMean Global Temperature by 2100WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE NEXT 90 YEARS TAKING US TO 2100, WHAT DOYOU THINK THE WORST CASE CENARIO MIGHT END UP BEING?I hesitate to forecast because most of the things I would have forecast ten years ago (for2100) are coming to pass much, much sooner than I thought they would. It’s one of thosethings where you can see what’s coming. So, why would you keep driving that way?The temperature forecast is one that is fairly confident that we’ll see temperaturessomething like 7 to 8 degrees F. warmer by the end of the century. There is a wide rangeof possibilities and it has a lot to do with how the Earth responds to this push we’re givingit by adding greenhouse gases.I think it’s fairly clear, knowing that we’re only at the beginning of the effects of thesegreenhouse gases, that global warming is going to have on the planet. We’re already seeingdramatic effects in far away areas like the Arctic and Antarctic. A prudent person wouldsay, ‘If we can solve this problem and save money or improve our economy or stimulateinnovation in the engineering and business sector, why not do it?A 7 TO 8 DEGREE F. TEMPERATURE INCREASE BY THE END OF THIS CENTURY,ONLY 90 YEARS FROM NOW, WOULD BE A 7 TO 8 TIMES INCREASE OVER THEINCREASE IN THE LAST CENTURY.That’s right.IT SEEMS TO ME AS A REPORTER COVERING ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS FORA LONG TIME THAT IT IS ALMOST INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ANTICIPATE WHATA 7 TO 8 DEGREE F. AVERAGE GLOBAL TEMPERATURE INCREASE WOULD BEIN ONLY 90 YEARS FROM NOW.You’re absolutely right. There’s a possibility for very dramatic changes in the environmentand ecosystems, in storminess, in snow pack. It will be a very big change. And it will behappening very fast. And the further we go down this road – if we wait until disasters arepopping up every day in the headlines, it will be much, much tougher to slow down andstop and turn around.” As the cold waters of the 2007 La Nina in the Pacific begin to fade away in 2008,temperatures are expected to warm up dramatically, while drought continues in thesouthern American plain states, including Texas, which received less than 25% of normalrainfall during the 2007 winter. On the heels of the La Nina, NOAA forecasters predictthat in late summer 2008, a weak or moderate El Nino event will emerge – which is theopposite of La Nina because El Ninos warm up the Pacific Ocean.[ Editor's Note: El Niño-Southern Oscillation is a global ocean-atmospherephenomenon in which Pacific Ocean sea surface temperatures are higher. Thename El Niño, from the Spanish for “the little boy,” refers to the Christ child,because the phenomenon is usually noticed around Christmas time in thePacific Ocean off the west coast of South America every few years. La Niñameans “the little girl” and is the opposite of El Nino with cooler sea surfacetemperatures in the Pacific Ocean. The most recent occurrence of El Niñostarted in September 2006, and lasted until early 2007. From June 2007 on,data indicates a weak to moderate La Niña event extending to mid-2008,which cooled winter temperatures in mid-latitudes of Northern Hemisphere.The first signs of an El Niño are below and generally opposite for La Nina:- Rise in air pressure over the Indian Ocean, Indonesia, and Australia.- Fall in air pressure over Tahiti and the rest of the central and eastern PacificOcean.- Trade winds in the south Pacific weaken or head east.- Warm air rises near Peru, causing rain in the northern Peruvian deserts.- Warm water spreads from the west Pacific and the Indian Ocean to the eastPacific. It takes the rain with it, causing extensive drought in the westernPacific and rainfall in the normally dry eastern Pacific.]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"More Information:For further information about Antarctica and Arctic ice melts, please see Earthfilesreports below in the Earthfiles Archive:• 10/05/2007 — Earlier, Faster and Deeper Arctic Ice Melt Down• 08/08/2007 — 2007's Warm, Erratic Global Weather• 07/11/2007 — Mystery of Night Shining Clouds - Another Global Warming Change?• 06/21/2007 — Large Lake in Southern Chile Has Disappeared• 06/01/2007 — Is Earth Close to Dangerous Tipping Point in Global Warming?• 05/18/2007 — Antarctica: Unprecedented Western Ice Melt and CO2-Saturated SouthernOcean• 02/02/2007 — Updated: New U.
