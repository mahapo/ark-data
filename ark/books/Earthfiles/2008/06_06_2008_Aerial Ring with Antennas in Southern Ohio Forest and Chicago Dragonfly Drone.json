Here is an excerpt from a May 30, 2008, email:“I just heard your piece about dragonfly probes and you talked about peoplesitting on their stories about contacts and encounters for fear of beingridiculed and chastised for their comments. Well, that’s what I’ve been doingfor about 7 years. In 2001, I was on my parents’ land in southern Ohio aboutan hour north of Cincinnati. It was early morning, about 8:30 AM, inmid-December 2001. I had been out hunting on my parents’ land where therewere a lot of Douglas fir trees that ran about a half-mile and about 300 yardsdeep. The deer I was hunting frequented that stand of fir trees, so I routinelywent to sit among the trees every hunting season. When I entered the stand oftrees to head to my normal spot, I felt a strange sensation like a static chargeenveloped my body.”That Ohio hunter has asked for anonymity because he now works in law enforcement anddoes not want to jeopardize his employment. So, I will call him “ David Smith.” David wasborn in 1982 and is now 26-years-old. The past four years he has worked as a police"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"dispatcher in a southwestern state. He told me he is haunted by what happened to him inthat southern Ohio stand of fir trees in December 2001.He vividly remembers a ring with three long antenna suspended in the air at treetop height.It had snowed the night before and apparently the strange aerial ring was interested in thenew snow. A perfect circle had been melted on the ground that included melt from somefir tree branches that hung inside the circle. The snow droplets were being raised by atranslucent column of energy into the completely silent, hovering aerial ring with its three,long appendages.Interview:“David Smith,” Southwestern Police Dispatcher, former resident of Cincinnati,Ohio:“I walked maybe 10 or 15 feet into the tree line and I heard this sound. It is veryhard to explain, but basically it would start from the lowest base that the human ear canpick up and raise up 4 or 5, maybe even 6, octaves to a very high-pitched note. It would dothis every 15 seconds. So, it would rise from base to high pitch and then back down to baseand start the process over again.I decided this was not natural. It was not an animal, it was not manmade. I needed to gohear this and find out what it is.So, I started walking in the general direction that I figured it would be, that I coulddecipher from my hearing. I’m walking through the tree rows and I remember that thesound never changed – the sound stayed the same volume as it was when I first heard it –like it was the same distance from me, even though I was walking closer. Or at least Iassumed I was walking closer to whatever was making this noise.I remember looking ahead of me and seeing a tree and the top of it was partially melted ontop with wet snow. Then, the tree directly after that one – the snow was a little bit moremelted. It was not gone, but still kind of there and wet and falling off the tree.Then the third tree, the next one, there was hardly any snow at all. It was mainly on thebottom needles of the tree.Then I vividly remember that the 4th tree, the next one, was completely devoid of snowand completely dry. This was the case for all of the trees that I could see on both sides ofthe row. And I assume it was the same for all the trees in a circle. When I remember in mymind, I get the image of a circle of trees with the melted snow and some with dry needles.So, I remember this as being incredibly puzzling. I didn’t have an answer for it. As Iwalked forward to inspect the trees, I put my head down below the limb line, as we call it(6 feet above ground), and I remember looking under the trees and seeing there was aperfect circle in the snow, as if someone had taken a knife and cut out a perfect circle ofsnow and all that lay there was grass.I proceeded to walk forward and when I raised my head up between the limbs, I sawsomething that is very hard to explain. To this day, I don’t know a good way of doing it. Melted Snow Droplets Rising In AirI saw what I assumed was the snow from the missing circle (of snow on the ground) and itwas floating in the air in droplet form. The snow was animated. I could see movement ofthe droplets. I recall seeing sunlight reflecting on the droplets. As I looked up the column(in which the snow droplets were rising) about 5 to 8 feet up from the ground, I noticedthat the water droplets got heavier as they went up the column. There were very fewdroplets at the bottom and as they rose to the top of the column, there were millions ofdroplets – very thick, very full.Then about 10 feet above that for the first time I saw the object. And the bizarre soundhad stopped when I walked into the trees. Ring-Shaped Craft with Three Long “Antennas”"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Melted snow rising in translucent column into aerial craft that had three 20-foot-long“antennas” equally spaced around central ring that was about 12 feet in diameter.Illustration © 2008 by “David Smith.”I remember looking up past the column of rising snow water droplets and seeing the objectthere for the first time. It was very awe-inspiring at first, very much like that small feelingyou get looking at large buildings. That was the feeling I got – ‘Wow! I’m incredibly punycompared to this thing!’ Not that it was large, because it was not. I would estimate thediameter of the inner ring of the object to maybe be 10 to 12 feet wide.There were three antennas. I called them antennas, but they were very thick. The width ofthe ring itself was about 2-feet-wide and 1 foot thick. The three antennas wereequi-distant apart. They were probably 20 feet long. They were huge.Illustration © 2008 by “David Smith.”Where the antennas actually met the ring, I could not tell any sort of coupling. I could nottell any kind of anchoring system. The ring and antennas looked like they were moldedinto one piece. There was absolutely no crack where they were anchored. There were nobolts, no obvious anchoring mechanisms. But the antennas were incredibly taught – 100%straight. There was no bow to them.CAN YOU PLACE ON THE RING BY NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST DIRECTIONSWHERE EACH OF THE 20-FOOT-LONG ANTENNAS WERE?I would have been facing west, so those antennas on that ring – one would have beenpointing exactly due north. Then the other two were pointed southwest and southeast.WERE THEY TAPERED? OR WAS IT THE SAME DIAMETER FROM ONE END TOTHE OTHER?The antennas were tapered. They came to a very fine point – they were so small andpointed that they blended in with the background. I remember that vividly. Where it came"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"to a point, I could not actually see its point.Computer 3-D recreation © 2008 by Andy Carolan Illustration and Design, U. K. Ring Drone Metal Absorbed Light?Charcoal gray.The material – I assume it was metal – that this thing was constructed out of was nothingI’ve never seen before. It was 100% smooth and very deep as in when you looked at it, itabsorbed light. It was almost as if it sucked in light around itself. But it was a charcoalgray. It was very, very shiny. And I saw no reflections. It was shiny, yet matte finish, ifthat makes any sense. I saw no reflections in it. I could not see myself or the surroundingtrees – I couldn’t see anything reflected in it.On the ends of each antenna, there were four rods that looked like an FM radio antenna -to me that’s what they looked like.AT THE END OF THE 20-FOOT-LONG ANTENNAS, YOU MEAN THAT CROSSINGEACH ANTENNA WERE FOUR SHORTER, STRAIGHT RODS THAT MADE90-DEGREE ANGLES TO THE LONG ANTENNAS?No, not 90 degrees. They were probably 35 degree angles, pointed semi-diagonallyupwards from the actual long antenna. Ring Drone Emitted “Heat Waves”I would guess a good two or three minutes had passed with no movement and no sound.The only thing that I can still recall vividly from this point on is that the snow droplets hadstopped moving. They were still floating in space – 100% floating in the air above thisarea.The fir trees there were very large. The limbs left only a one to two foot clearing to walkbetween the trees. So, it’s a big deal for that much snow to be melted from them.HOW TALL WERE THOSE TREES?The object was hovering right above one, almost touching one of the tips of the trees. Iwould say the ring object was about 20 to 25 feet above the ground.AND YOU ARE HOW TALL?I’m 6 foot 4 inches tall.SO, THE RING OBJECT WAS ONLY ABOUT 14 FEET ABOVE YOU?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Exactly. I got a very, very good look at it. The good thing is that nothing was obscured bythe trees, so I could see the whole ring and antenna array around the ring body. Was Ring Craft Conscious?When I tried to look at the ring object – with me looking at it directly with my eye contact– there would be a field around the ring that appeared and looked like heat waves. When Iwould first look at it, it would be just a ring. Then if I would linger in my stare at the objectfor a second, this field would just automatically appear. It would be like heat wavescoming off a hot road in the desert.The next thing I remember is looking at it and staring at the ring trying to get somecharacteristics from it – some sort of writing or inscription or anything – a seam wherethere was a metal panel or something, but I just could not find one. I remember intentlythinking to myself, ‘What is this thing? I’ve got to find out what this is.’ And as soon as Ithought that, I was overcome with the most frightening fear I’ve ever had in my life. Themost horrifying fear that you could ever imagine hit me very hard, so much so that mybody tensed. I remember that I tensed up so tight that I couldn’t move. It was like I hadlost control of my body. My brain was in fight or flight mode. It was telling me to flee veryquickly. But I couldn’t. I was stuck in place.That lasted for 15 to 20 seconds easily. I don’t know what happened to the floatingdroplets of water. I was very intent on the ring itself. I could not look away to tell whathappened to the water. Extreme Fear, Cold Tears and Spinning DroneThe next thing that I can recall happening is that as the fear progressed, as it got worse, Iactually started to cry. I remember it vividly, the warmth of my tears on my cold cheeks.And the last thing of the whole encounter that I really remember is the fact that it wentfrom no movement, no sound, no nothing – instantly! to spinning at a horrible speed. Itwas amazing how fast this thing was going – spinning right in place. No wind, there was nowind generated from the spinning. But it was spinning incredibly fast.As I was looking at the ring spinning, I remember seeing a white pinpoint of lightdeveloping – actually, right in the center of the ring, right where I was looking. Not in thecenter space of the ring, but in the center of the body of the ring. So, if I were looking atthe body of the ring itself spinning, right in the middle of that body this pinpoint of brilliantwhite light emerged.As I stared at it, the white light got larger and larger over time and then in an instant itexploded and enveloped my eyesight. I relate it to like reverse tunnel vision. If you havetunnel vision, everything goes dark from the outside in. Well, this went white light from theinside out and enveloped my vision. Beam of White Light Knocked David SmithUnconscious and Melted His BootsWhen the white light exploded into my sight, it knocked me unconscious. I woke up, Iwould guess, ten hours later. The sun was down. It was night. My watch had stopped, so Ican’t give you an accurate time. I still have that stopped watch. I was lying on the groundon my back. I remember feeling very disoriented when I woke up, almost to the point ofnot remembering what had happened.The weirdest thing about it was that the soles of my boots had melted. The rubber on thesoles of my boots was melted to the grass. It was horrible. There were two footprints inthe snow where my feet had been. In those footprints, there was no snow. There was justgrass underneath where I had been standing.Obviously, the melting of the boot soles would burn through the snow into the grass. Butthere were no burn marks on the ground! It was almost like I had been struck by lightning.I felt very disoriented. My body hurt all over. I couldn’t think very well. I was lost,actually. I could not figure out where I was. I sat there for half an hour to 45 minutes justtrying to figure out who I was, where I was and what I was doing. It was very, very"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"frightening. “I Hate You”DID YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF COMMUNICATION IN YOUR MIND FROM THEOBJECT WHEN IT WAS SPINNING AND WHEN THE WHITE LIGHT BEGAN TOAPPEAR?The only thing I felt when it started spinning was pure hatred, like I got this overwhelmingfeeling of, ‘I hate you. Why are you here? Leave me alone. Why are you alive?’ That kindof thing.I come from a military family and I’ve seen a lot of military hardware that performs verywell. But I’ve never seen any piece of metallic hardware perform that kind of spinningmaneuver in our atmosphere.SPINNING SO RAPIDLY AND NOT CAUSING ANY MOVEMENT IN THE AIRAROUND YOU.Nor any sound, for that matter. Try to imagine seeing a ring spinning, right? with the longantennas attached. But with absolutely no air movement and no sound coming from it. No‘whoosh,’ nothing. Just complete silence.WAS IT DURING THAT SPINNING THAT YOU HAD THE SENSE THAT IT WASDIRECTING HATRED AT YOU?When it started spinning like that, I genuinely believed it wanted my death.IF IT WERE THAT POWERFUL AND FROM SOME PLACE ELSE IN THEUNIVERSE, PERHAPS, WHY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE NOT KILLED?I don’t think it had the capability. Using everything I know to be valid in the world ofphysics and the world of chemistry, as we know them, I don’t think the ring object had thecapability to kill me.BUT IT WAS EXPRESSING TO YOUR MIND SOME HOW THE DESIRE THAT ITWANTED YOU ELIMINATED?Exactly. It was expressing its emotions, if I dare use the word emotion. I don’t knowwhere the ring with the antenna appendages was from. I definitely do not believe it wasmanmade. There’s a lot of stuff out there that I know can be manmade, but this was not.This was completely otherworldly. Again, I don’t think it had the ability to kill me. What itwas doing was expressing its desire to do so.WHEN THE WHITE, BRIGHT PINPOINT OF LIGHT BEGAN TO EXPAND, DID YOUHAVE ANY OTHER SENSE COMING FROM THE SPINNING OBJECT?Not that I can recall. It was almost as if I were in a trance. My vision was locked upon it. Ido remember thinking, ‘I’m going to die. This is it. I’m toast. I’m done!'I believe it either tried to kill me and failed somehow. Or it was just a defensive tactic. Or,it was an object that was sent here to Earth. What I got in stumbling upon it in the middleof nowhere was that it was on some sort of covert operation. Like, ‘My main objective isto not be discovered.’ That’s what I get from the whole situation, from re-living it over andover again. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time and I stumbled upon the wrongthing at the wrong time.YOU COULD SAY FROM WHAT YOU OBSERVED THAT ITS MISSION AT THATTIME WAS TO GATHER MELTED SNOW INTO THAT ENERGY COLUMN ANDTAKE IT SOMEWHERE INTO THAT RING?Yes. I definitely believe it was studying something, whether it was the snow? Or the snowwas just the top layer and it was trying to get to the dirt? Maybe there is something buriedunder there. I don’t know. I’ve never gone back. I refuse to go back. I will not go backinto that area. That’s how frightening this was. I’m scared thinking about it right now. Public Deserves to Know TruthAbout Ring DronesWHEN YOU HEARD MY RADIO DISCUSSIONS AND HEARD BRENT YEAROUT"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"UP IN CAMAS, WASHINGTON, DESCRIBE WHAT HE AND HIS FRIEND HADSEEN, WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION? [ See: May 9, 2008 Earthfileshttp://www.earthfiles.com/news.php?ID=1428&category=Environment ]To tell you the truth – and I’m not afraid to admit this – I broke down crying. I was veryglad to hear that I was not the only one who had heard about this stuff and I wasn’t theonly one who had seen one of these things. I’m very, very scared of it coming back. I feelthat its purpose was not good in nature.Something big is going to happen – I’m fairly certain of that. One of the staples of modernwarfare is reconnaissance. You have to know your enemy. You have to know how theythink, how they move, how they work, what they eat, how they eat, when they eat, thatsort of thing. I believe these (ring drones) are the tendrils of some sort of recon force, anexpeditionary unit that’s going over the target, figuring out what has to be done. That’swhat frightens me so much. That is the vibe, the feeling that I felt. I think the publicdeserves to know the truth about these ring craft. Police Dispatchers Are DebriefedAbout UFO PhenomenaWHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR POLICE DEPARTMENT WOULD BE FACED WITHIF THE RINGED DRONES SHOWED UP MORE PERSISTENTLY FOR THE PUBLICTO SEE?The first thing that would happen is that we would get the call and I can’t say the policecode over the phone, of course. But we would get a call that would indicate there is amysterious, no-explanation object.Then what would happen is everyone would be recalled from off duty and some leave ofabsence officers would be recalled. Then, depending upon how many officers there were,they would either go into crowd control duty or they would go into basically arrest duty.That would dictate that the officers go out and find out what is going on and try toapprehend anyone or any thing that was causing the disturbance. There is a policy for this.We do have a code for an unidentified flying object. I personally have only heard it once.I’ve never actually dealt with the call.DOES YOUR POLICE STATION INTRPRET THE CODE FOR A UFO EVENT TOMEAN DANGER OR CROWD CONTROL?The first process that needs to take place once the call (UFO code) is heard is that we callour On Duty Sergeant, the man who is directly above us. We must let him know that thisUFO has been sighted. He then goes ahead and calls the captain of the unit. From there, Ido not know what happens. I do not know if he calls the Police Commissioner or someonein the state and/or federal government? I don’t know how they report it, but I know theyDO report it. There is a sense of urgency, of course, but there is never a sense of fright.There is never a sense of danger. Stephenville, Texas, UFO AlertHAVE YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES AT YOUR POLICE STATION EVER BEENDEBRIEFED ABOUT THE NATURE OF UFOS AND WHAT THEIR MISSION MIGHTBE?We were actually debriefed about the Stephenville, Texas, UFO events.THAT WAS JANUARY 1, TO FEBRUARY 13, 2008.Yes, we were told when the UFO code was announced that a UFO had been spotted inStephenville. That’s quite a distance from where I’m based. A UFO had been sighted. Theonly information that authorities were allowed to give us was that ‘it had been handled’and to expect more phone calls coming in over the next few days.HOW DID YOU INTERPRET THE PHRASE, ‘IT HAD BEEN HANDLED’?Usually when you hear ‘it had been handled’ in a law enforcement environment, thatmeans that people had not been apprehended, but had been talked to. Basically, it alsomeans the matter is out of your jurisdiction, it’s out of your hands. What had happened isthat our Captain had talked to whoever was in charge and told them that if the higherauthorities needed our support, we are here. If not, that’s fine. We were not told much"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"more than that.DID YOU HEAR ANY INSIDE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT MIGHT BEHAPPENING IN THE STEPHENSVILLE REGION? I heard scuttlebut that there was a radio blackout some time in the night on January 24thto 25th.WHEN YOU SAY RADIO BLACKOUT, THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ORDERED ORCAUSED BY WHOM?Usually when we get radio blackouts, they are very drastic situations – like September 11,2001. There was a radio blackout at Wright-Patterson AFB then in Ohio where my fatherworked.Basically what happens is that all radio communication is shut down, except for 100%vital communications. So 100% emergency communications are the only ones that travelover the radio. The blackout is on military and police band frequencies. Basically, it’s arelic from the Cold War. They do it so they can get the most needed information frompoint-to-point as quickly as possible in an emergency.IIF THE STEPHENVILLE REGION HAD A RADIO BLACKOUT FOR A NIGHT,WHAT PROVOKED THE BLACKOUT?For that area and the surrounding cities like Dublin, Glen Rose and so on, for that small ofan area to have a blank radio blackout is bad news. Something went down. Of course,we’ve never been told any details about what happened. The only people who would beinvolved would be government – federal law enforcement and on up.DO YOU KNOW IF ANY OF THE ALPHABET AGENCIES TRAVELED TOSTEPHENVILLE AND THAT REGION?I do know that earlier in the month (January 2008), we were handling an incredibleamount of FBI and ATF (Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms) radio calls.WHY WOULD ATF BE INVOLVED?ATF has a very broad jurisdiction. They deal with anything exceedingly more dangerousthan the FBI deals with. ATF does a lot of counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency stuff.THAT WAS IN JANUARY. DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING BETWEEN JANUARY ANDJUNE, WHICH IS NOW 6 MONTHS LATER, THAT SOMEBODY TOLD YOU, ‘THIS ISWHAT WENT DOWN IN JANUARY’?I’ve never heard anything concrete. I’ve only heard whispers. I’ve heard that there was acrowd control issue. I’ve heard that even more lights were spotted over the Stephenvilleregion in mid-January 2008 in large number.DID YOU THINK ABOUT THE RING OBJECT THAT YOU ENCOUNTERED INDECEMBER 2001 IN THE SOUTHERN OHIO WOODS?(laughs) Yeah, it’s hard to go through a day without thinking about it, but yes! But I don’tknow if there is any connection between those ring things and what happened in Texas.” Chicago, Illinois Dragonfly Drone EyewitnessDecember 31, 2005“I saw it for about a full 2 minutes before it ‘sparkled’and de-materialized right before it turned the corner.I couldn't believe what I saw!” - Chicago Drone EyewitnessSubject: Drone in downtown Chicago New Year's Eve 2005Date: May 23, 2008To : earthfiles@earthfiles.com“Linda Moulton Howe,I read about the dragonfly drones on your Earthfiles.com site and it remindedme of an experience I had 3 years ago. On New Years Eve in 2005 (December31, 2005), my wife and I decided to go downtown Chicago and get a room atthe ‘W’ hotel on Lakeshore Drive."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"My parents were in town to watch our daughter at our condo. We wereplanning on getting away for the night, drinking some champagne and ringingin the new year. After a meal and a few drinks (2 or 3 glasses of champagne),we went back to the hotel room around 10:30 PM or so.As my wife was getting changed, I was standing looking out of the window,which I believe was facing south, making Lake Michigan on my left. I waslooking into the other lit windows of the high-rises around, people-watching...when I saw something that looked like it was hanging on the side of a buildingmaybe 2 blocks away. I thought at first it was a window washing scaffold, butnoticed it was moving slowly up on the right side of the building at a45-degree angle.I realized what I was looking at was an object with a tail, hovering unattachedto the building. The tail pointed away from the building. It was not even closeto looking like a helicopter as it had voids at the top and bottom that I couldsee with no rotors, no cockpit. I saw it for about a full 2 minutes before it‘sparkled’ and de-materialized right before it turned the corner. I couldn'tbelieve what I saw! I yelled for my wife to come look, but she couldn't get there in time. Thephotos I have seen of dragonfly drones on your Earthfiles website are similar,although I think this one was about the size of a Volkswagen beetle, judging bythe size of the glass on the building. When it sparkled, it was faint, anddefinitely not like a firecracker. It flickered a few times before fading out.The skin itself was a weird charcoal-greyish matte finish, but there wasdefinitely an underlying glow to it that drew my attention there in the firstplace. I had the impression this object was looking into the windows as well,but being very stealthy. It was an odd experience. I have never seen anythinglike that. I was wondering if you had received any other sightings like this. Itseems most have been in rural areas. This was right downtown Chicago. Maybe others saw it as well?”If any Earthfiles viewers have more information about ring-shaped craft with antennaappendages that stop and start in the sky like a dragonfly, please email me:earthfiles@earthfiles.com Confidentiality is always honored.More Information:For further information about the ring dragonfly drones, please see the Earthfiles Archivereports listed below:• 06/06/2008 — Aerial Ring with Antennas in Southern Ohio Forest and Chicago DragonflyDrone• 05/09/2008 — Dragonfly Drones - Surveillance Technology?• 04/04/2008 — Wingless, “Dragonfly” Sighting On March 31, 2008• 03/21/2008 — Part 2, Dragonfly-Shaped Aerial Craft: Current Media Misinformation VersusEyewitnesses 1987 to 2007• 03/07/2008 — Mysterious Aerial “Drones” - Oklahoma and Arkansas• 07/28/2007 — Clarifications and Comments by Isaac• 07/11/2007 — Professional Computer Engineers Comment About \"Isaac\" and CARETDocument• 07/10/2007 — 2005 and 2006 Memphis \"Drones\"?• 06/29/2007 — Another \"Drone\" This Week Near Maxwell AFB• 06/26/2007 — Part 1: Explanation of the Recent \"Strange Craft\" Sightings• 06/26/2007 — Part 2: Documentation, Palo Alto Caret Laboratory Q4-86 Research Report• 06/22/2007 — Dragonfly \"Drone\" Seen October 1995 in Arizona• 06/18/2007 — Writing In Chad \"Drone\" Image - A Link to NASA Clementine 1 MoonMission?• 06/15/2007 — Part 1: Yosemite National Park and Northridge, California, Aerial Dragonfly“Drones”• 06/08/2007 — More Drone Photos and Other Eyewitnesses• 05/30/2007 — Birmingham-Type \"Drone\" Seen At Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, in Mid-1980s• 05/28/2007 — Letters About Unidentified \"Drone\" Aerial Objects• 05/25/2007 — Two More Eyewitnesses of Aerial \"Drones\" in 2005 and 2006• 05/21/2007 — Updated: Odd Aerial \"Drone\"?
