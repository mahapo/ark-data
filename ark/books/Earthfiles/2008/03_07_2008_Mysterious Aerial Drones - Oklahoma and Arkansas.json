Jane Smith in Hartshorne saw a Big-Basin-type drone tw icein June 2003, at her rural home. Her sister, Melody Thaxton, saw a Chad-type drone onor about November 20, 2007, from her Van Buren, Arkansas, office parking lot. March 7, 2008 Hartshorne, Oklahoma, and Van Buren, Arkansas - A year ago onMay 11, 2007, Coast to Coast AM webmaster, Lex, received an email letter with several"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"images attached of an odd, dragonfly-shaped, aerial object from a Central Californiaresident who called himself “Chad.” The images were dated May 6, 2007. In addition tothe dragonfly-shaped body that had appendages sticking out from a large ring, there wasanother odd feature. Rising from the ring straight up into the air were slightly curved, thinwires that formed a tall, circular crown above the dragonfly body. Chad was worried abouthis family's safety and health after he saw the bizarre aerial object at least eight times fromhis house and on hikes near his home. Neighbors, he said, had also seen the unidentifiedaerial object.Other photographs of dragonfly-shaped aerial objects began to emerge between May andJune 2007 from Lake Tahoe, Capitola and Big Basin, California – all with appendagessticking out from a ring and the tall, thin wires extending high above. [ See MoreInformation below.]By June 17, 2007, I received a dozen paper photographs dated June 5th, 2007, in postoffice mail. The new “drone” looked more menacing and more complicated than theothers. I had taken to calling the objects “drones” because eyewitnesses had theimpression that the hovering craft were not manned. The dozen photographs were from aman who called himself “Ty B.” Ty explained he photographed the large, dragon-fly craftwhile bicycling with a group in the Big Basin Redwood Park near Saratoga, California. Hesaid they all saw the dragonfly-shaped craft fade in and fade out three times above them. Itwas on the third fade in that Ty was able to take twelve photos, which he mailed to me.After the Big Basin craft, no other photographs of the mysterious dragonfly-shaped“drones” emerged. But in January 2008, I received the following email from an Earthfilesviewer in Van Buren, Arkansas, a suburb of Fort Smith.Subject: DroneDate: January 6, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“Dear Linda,It was suggested that I send you a letter to let you know that I was prettycertain I saw a drone in Fort Smith, Arkansas. What was strange is at first Ibelieved it to be a helicopter, and then I realized it wasn't making the noise ofa helicopter. So I looked again and saw that wire cone-shaped part andrealized what I was seeing (the drones in the photos at Earthfiles.com).I was so shocked I didn't think about getting someone to take a picture of it.My cell phone isn't a newer one, so my camera on my phone sucks.Anyway, I saw it for what it's worth.I also asked my sister if I could tell you about her sighting in Oklahomaseveral years ago. When I told her what I saw, she told me she had seensomething like I was describing.Sincerely,Melody McIver Thaxton”I phoned Melody and her sister, who I will call Jane Smith to honor her request foranonymity. Jane explained that she had two sightings the same week in June 2003 - longbefore all the May to June 2007 excitement about the “drone” photographs andeyewitness reports. At the time, Jane lived in the very small rural town of Hartshorne,Oklahoma, about two hours southwest of Van Buren and Fort Smith, Arkansas. Janeagreed to talk about what she said is the most extraordinary sky object she has ever seen.Interview:Jane Smith, Housewife, Hartshorne, Oklahoma, region: “The day was warm and Iwent out on my porch. I saw what I thought was an airplane. But then, the strange thinggot closer and closer and had all kinds of arms and legs on it and spirally things (top wiresgoing up into the air) and lights all over it. And it had writing on it that looked like aforeign language. Then, it just kind of hovered. It didn’t like fly – it just hovered. It stayedin the same spot for several hours. Then I went inside. And I saw it again a couple of dayslater, but it was in the evening. I don’t remember what time in the evening. It was doingthe same thing and it was around the same area. And it just kind of hovers.WHAT COLOR ARE YOU SEEING AND HOW CLOSE IS IT ABOVE YOU WHEREYOU ARE SITTING ON YOUR HOUSE PORCH?Sort of a greyish color, like a pewter – like a metal.

OR COULD YOU SEE A PROFILE?It was more a profile – part of the front and side.WERE THE LIGHTS FORMING ANY KIND OF PATTERN ON THE OBJECT?Some of the lights seemed to like take turns lighting up – like they would gradually light upone at a time and be all lit.

Drone Hovered Near Porch for Hourand Made Intermittent Buzzing Sounds"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"HOW LONG DID YOU SIT ON THE PORCH AND WATCH THE OBJECT HOVERINGABOVE YOU?Oh, my. The first time I saw it, probably 45 minutes to an hour – a long time.DURING THAT HOUR, DID YOU EVER HEAR ANY SOUND FROM IT?Like a humming or buzzing sound.COULD YOU TRY TO MIMIC THAT FOR ME NOW?(makes intermittent buzzing sound and laughs)DID THE SOUND STAY STEADY? OR GO OFF AND ON? OR?Kind of off and on.IN THE HOUR THAT YOU WERE WATCHING, DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUTCALLING THE POLICE OR FIRE DEPARTMENT FOR SOME ONE TO COME TAKEA LOOK?I contemplated sharing it with a friend or neighbor, but to be honest, I was afraid theywould think I was crazy and not really listen to me.Later I talked about it with my husband and he said it was probably a satellite. And I said,‘No, it was not a satellite!’ (Laughs)Living out where I was in Hartshorne, we’re talking about hillbilly authority. They wouldnot , they would just think you were drinking or something. I knew that anyone that wouldtake it seriously or would want to check it out, it would take so long to get there. Anyauthority was two or three hours away. I was in a very small area way rural, way out in thecountry! (outside of Hartshorne)ANY MILITARY BASES AROUND THERE?McAlester, Oklahoma, has a base that makes ammunition and tests it. It's called McAlesterArmy Ammunition.

DID ANYTHING CHANGEWHEN IT STARTED TO MOVE BACKWARDS?It seemed to brighten up more.DID IT BACK AWAY FROM YOU VERY SLOWLY?No, it actually seemed to move kind of fast. It was surprising. I wondered if it wasn’tsomething from the government, like a secret project of some kind.AS THE OBJECT MOVED AWAY FROM YOU, WHAT HAPPENED?It just gradually fades away. It kind of disappears and it was as though it was never there. Second Drone EncounterThat Week of June 2003"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"HOW MANY DAYS OR NIGHTS LATER WAS IT UNTIL YOU SAW IT A SECONDTIME?Oh, it was pretty close, within the same week. It was evening time and I thought I saw justa bright star from a distance. Then, it got closer. I pulled into my driveway. Where I lived,it was on top of a hill, so I had a really good, clear view of the sky. As it approached, Irealized it was the same thing again, but it was not as close as it was before.YOU KNEW IT WAS THE SAME BECAUSE WHY?I don’t know. I just knew! I guess because I could see there were more lights on it and itjust seemed to hover like before. I just felt like it was the same thing.DID IT COME CLOSE ENOUGH FOR YOU TO HEAR THAT HUM?No.DID IT STOP IN THE AIR?Yeah, it was doing the hover thing again.THIS TIME, HOW CLOSE DID IT GET TO YOU AFTER YOU GOT OUT OF THECAR?A lot further away.IF IT WERE 50 FEET BEFORE, HOW FAR WOULD YOU GUESS IT WAS THESECOND TIME?It was probably 200 feet, 100 feet. Quite a bit further.BUT YOU DID SEE IT STOP?Yeah.THEN WHAT HAPPENED?It just stayed there for awhile.DID YOU STAND OUT IN THE YARD?Yeah, I watched it for awhile and kind of knew what to expect. But I knew it was time formy husband to call. He works away and calls at a certain time. So, I went in the house.THE LIGHTED OBJECT WAS STILL THERE HOVERING IN THE SKY?Yeah.YOU GET THROUGH WITH THE PHONE CALL, DO YOU GO BACK OUT?No, because we talked for a long period of time on the phone back then.SO YOU DON’T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LIGHTED CRAFT?No.BUT AS FAR AS YOU ARE CONCERNED, TWO OF THESE ODD, DRAGONFLY-SHAPED OBJECTS – ONE IN THE TWILIGHT AND ONE AT NIGHT – CAMEWITHIN ONE WEEK TO WHERE YOU LIVED IN HARTSHORNE, OKLAHOMA, INJUNE 2003?Right.” Hartshorne, Oklahoma, Aerial Craft Most CloselyMatched Big Basin, California, “Drone” of June 5, 2007I sent Jane Smith seven drone images shown below and asked her to pick out the one typethat matched most closely what she had seen from her Hartshorne, Oklahoma, porch. Shepicked the seventh one. She also surprised me by adding that in addition to many of theappendages moving, she watched the “cage” hanging beneath the aerial drone open andclose several times.

It was 5 PM Central and I was leaving thebuilding where I worked and went to my car. I just was looking in the direction where Iwas fixing to drive out of the parking lot. There is a business building next to where weare. Above that, I see this thing out of the corner of my eye. At first I thought it was ahelicopter.But when I looked at it, I thought, ‘Wait a minute! That’s no helicopter!’ Then I realizedthere was no sound. You know how much sound helicopters make, especially if you arewithin close vicinity?RIGHT.This was not making a sound and I realized I was looking at what appeared to be like thepictures of the drones at your Earthfiles website. It had this weird, funny, metal-lookingshaped thing on it and it looked like it has a tail – like a long, flat tail sticking out.WOULD THIS BE LIKE A DRAGONFLY SHAPE?Yes, kind of like that. If you want to compare it to something, I guess that’s the best way.That would be the closest shape I can think of. There’s nothing that I’ve ever seen that isshaped like that.IT WAS SO UNIQUE?Yeah, exactly.It was in pretty clear sight. And there was another person – I think they were a customerof where I work. They looked up and back at me and said, ‘Are you going to get a pictureof that?’ And I said, ‘All I’ve got is my camera phone.’ I headed back to the building to seeif I could find a photographer that was still there. As I was going back to the building, theaerial thing just kind of dissipated. You could tell it was moving very slowly, but notenough to – it wasn’t moving very fast!IT JUST FADED OUT?Yes, it just faded out.AT EARTHFILES, ALL OF THE PHOTOS SHOW PRONGS OR WIRY STRUCTURESRISING UP INTO THE SKY?Yes, that’s what I was telling you about the stuff that stuck out.SO YOU WERE SEEING THE PRONGS STICKING UP IN THE SKY ABOVE THEBODY?Yeah, that’s why I had to do a double take because it wasn’t – there was no sound. Andthen I realized it was not the right shape for a helicopter. When you are going home, youjust think, ‘I’m on my way home’ and you kind of look at other things at a glance. But itdefinitely had those prongs on it going up."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"YOUR SISTER SAID SHE COULD SEE SP IDER LEGS STICKING OUT FROMTHELONGER BODY? DID YOU SEE ANY OF THE PROJECTIONS MOVING?No, evidently from the way she described it, she saw it from a closer distance. Mine wasfurther away. I could not see anything moving. It was pretty hazy. But the thing itself waskind of floating.And it had these metal, spidery-looking things going up – almost like a funnel shape, theway it would go up, like it was an upside down funnel with the spider-leg-looking things.And then, it had like a tail sticking out that was metal-like. The object was slowly movingtoward the west.There was another person there. I have no idea who they were and they looked at me andasked, ‘Did you see that? Do you have a camera?’I did not have a camera, but I had my cell phone and I was going to go inside the buildingto see if I could find a photographer who was working. Before I got to the door, I was stillkeeping it in my peripheral vision and the thing faded out. It did not move away fast. It justdisappeared, kind of dissipated, like a cloud of smoke.THAT WAS NOVEMBER 2007. HAD YOU TALKED WITH YOU SISTER ABOUTWHAT SHE HAD SEEN FOUR YEARS EARLIER?No, we were at a Christmas party in December 2007 and I asked her, ‘You want to hearsomething odd that happened to me recently?’ And I told her about what I saw. And shesaid, ‘That sounds exactly like what I saw a few years back.’I said, ‘What did you think it was?’She said, ‘I thought it was some kind of spy equipment.’Most people around here, if you told them you saw something like that (laughs), theywould think you are crazy. I haven’t really discussed it with a whole lot of people becauseof that reason. This is the Bible Belt. I’m not saying that Christians can’t believe in UFOs.But a lot of them discourage it.” I also emailed the same seven photographs to Melody and asked her to pick the one thatmost closely matched what she saw in Van Buren, Arkansas. She picked photographnumber 3, one of the “Chad” photographs from Central California, dated May 6, 2007.Another odd aerial “drone” photographed by “Chad” in Central California,on May 6, 2007.
