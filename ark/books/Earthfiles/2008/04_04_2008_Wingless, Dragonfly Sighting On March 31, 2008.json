Sketch © 2008 by Cam for Earthfiles.com.April 4, 2008 Scotts Valley, California - A video has been circulating on the internet formonths as “Kaptive” - a CGI rock video manipulation of the dragonfly aerial dronephotographs that first emerged in May to June 2007. Not only is it a manipulation of thephotographs, the CGI operator named Kris Avery took my Earthfiles podcast news reportsabout the dragonfly drone phenomenon and edited in my voice and voices of people I’veinterviewed without asking permission.Now he has sent a letter to io9.com explaining his manipulation of the photographs andstates that since making his video, “I have been accused of being the originator of thewhole drone saga, and the photos were in fact just a viral campaign to promote theeventual video. This is definitely NOT the truth.” [ See whole letter in More Informationbelow.]What is the truth is that a dozen people came forward to me to describe dragonflybody-shaped aerial craft each had seen. Their reports span a time line of twenty years from1987 up to mid-November 2007, including California, Louisiana, Arizona, Alabama,Arkansas and Oklahoma locations. Now, another dragonfly aerial craft eyewitness hasemerged – a sighting as recently as Monday, March 31, 2008. The two privateinvestigators, who were hired by an international group to track down dragonfly droneeyewitnesses in the United States, talked with me on Tuesday evening, April 1. Tom Davisis the owner of TK Davis Investigations in California after retiring from police detectivework. Tom hired another retired police detective, Frank Dixon, to join him on the TKDavis Investigations of the mysterious dragonfly drones.Frank Dixon, left, and T.K.

On the map, Capitola is the bottom pink circle where eyewitness“Rajman” allegedly photographed the dragonfly drone above power lines on May 16,2007.Between Saratoga and Big Basin Redwoods State Park, on June 5, 2007, eyewitness“Stephen” photographed a dragonfly drone. The same date, Ty B. was bicycling with othersin the Big Basin Redwoods State Park when the same type of dragonfly drone flickeredin and out of sight - three times. The third time it slowly rotated above the bicyclers andTy B. took twelve photographs. Earlier on May 16, 2007, Rajman saw a dragonflydrone above a power pole in Capitola and took six photographs. In Scotts Valley,northwest of Capitola, on March 31, 2008, at 10:15 AM, Cam saw a wingless,dragonfly body moving high in the sky.Tom asked Cam if she would talk with me in a taped interview for Earthfiles andDreamland internet radio and she agreed. Her sighting was at 10:15 AM on Monday,March 31, 2008, when she was working in her kitchen while her boyfriend, Geoff, wasdoing yard work outside.Interview:Cam, Scotts Valley, California: “I was getting breakfast ready. I have a pan rack thathangs from my kitchen ceiling. Up above my pan rack are two, big skylights. I was in theprocess of getting ready to reach up and grab a pan from the rack when all of a sudden Icaught some movement up in the skylight.We live right under a flight path. We have a lot of airlines that go over and at first I thoughtthat might have been what it was. But it looked a little smaller than a commercial planelike the 747s or whatever. I know they are up around 30,000 to 40,000 feet, I think. Thisthing was lower than that and I thought maybe it was a military jet.Then all of a sudden I started realizing, ‘Wait a minute! There are no wings, no sound, andwe had the windows open and the door was open. We should have been able to hearsomething because you can hear planes in the kitchen. And then I realized that it had thishuge, long nose on the front of it. So, it was a really long nose and the body had a roundshape. I saw a little bit of what I thought could have been a tail, another round shape. But Ihad my hands up trying to figure out how long this thing was. If you held your handstraight up against a jet commercial plane – that’s a couple of inches. This thing wasmaybe an inch and a quarter. So, it was really high up there. It was hard to tell how long itwas because I didn’t have a whole lot of reference.Later, I saw pictures (of 2007 dragonfly drones) that showed spiky appendages coming offof it (ring). I didn’t see that, but I’m thinking it’s because it was so high that I couldn’t seethat.But as soon as I saw all this, I went running out the front door to yell to my boyfriend,Geoff, to look up in the sky really fast because there was this thing in the sky. But by thetime I got outside, it still should have been there like planes are, but it was gone. It was justgone! I don’t know where it went. But the path it was taking – we still should have beenable to see it by the time I went outside because it was not going a tremendously fastspeed. We should have been able to see it somewhere in the sky. But by the time I got tothe front door, it was just gone. And it was so odd that there was absolutely no sound atall. Geoff had been working outside and he had no reason to look up because there was nonoise."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"DID YOU SEE A RING AND SEE THE SKY THROUGH THE RING?That’s hard for me to decide. What I saw, it was so high up that I’m not positive if therereally was a ring that I could definitely see on that or not. To me, it seemed like a stainlesssteel color. It did not seem super shiny. But again, it was so high and the angle I was seeingat was kind of underneath it. But since it was heading away from me, it was at an anglewhere I couldn’t really get a good look at exactly the bottom of it and I sure could not seethe top of it. It could have had a ring in it because it could have been a little bit lighter inthe middle (of round part). But I couldn’t tell if I could see sky through it because it wasmoving. Right After Sighting, Cam SketchedWingless, Dragonfly Aerial CraftI did a quick sketch as soon as I came back into the house because I didn’t want to forgetwhat I saw. So I ran back in the house and drew what I saw on just the closest piece ofpaper I could find, which happened to be a brochure for a plant I had ordered. So, I justtook an ink pen and sketched out really quickly what I had seen.THAT’S THE PAD THAT SAYS ‘LILIES’ ON IT?That’s right.“Lilies” flower brochure on which Cam sketched the wingless,dragonfly body right after she saw it through her kitchen skylight around10:15 AM, Monday, March 31, 2008, in Scotts Valley, California.Sketch provided to Earthfiles.com by Tom Davis, TK Investigations.Didn't Look Or Move Like A HelicopterWHY DID YOU THINK IT WAS NOT A HELICOPTER?The main thing is that I’ve never seen a helicopter that had a huge, long point on it like thisthing did. It was really, really long. The point of it was longer than the body was and thebody was more of a round shape. It kind of came out a little on the sides (of body).[SEE: Birmingham, Alabama 2006 photograph below, which Cam picked out"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"as body shape closest to what she saw through her kitchen skylight.]So, I don’t know if it was perfectly round or had little triangular edges on the side of it.Then the back, the way it looked. But there was no way that was a helicopter! You wouldhave heard a helicopter.It didn’t move like a helicopter at all and there was no sound. A helicopter has a reallydistinctive look and they don’t have that big point coming off the front. And it didn’t havewings. It wasn’t like any kind of shaped object that I’ve ever seen. And to not have anynoise. We can hear plane sounds here, you can here helicopters, and they go over a lot.With our being in a flight pattern, you hear planes and you hear personal planes likeCessnas. You hear them all the time. With the windows open, there should have beensound if it were a helicopter. And there was nothing. Scotts Valley Dragonfly CraftMoved Tail FirstIS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT WHAT YOU SAW IN THE SKY WITH YOUR OWN EYESHAD THE SHAPE OF A DRAGONFLY?Yeah, except with no wings. But it did kind of have that shape with the long point in thefront. And I did some checking on the internet to see if anybody had seen anything like Isaw and I have heard that they go the other direction (ring ahead of long tail). But the oneI saw, the point of it was the direction it was going. So, mine would be headed tail first, Iguess. Others have considered that long part to be the tail of it, but to me it was the frontbecause I haven’t seen these before (or the photos before) and so what I was seeing wasthe long pointed end was the part that was headed forward. Cam Reported Sighting to Tom DavisTHAT WAS MONDAY, MARCH 31. HOW DID YOU COME TO TALK WITH TOMDAVIS WHO HAS BEEN INVESTIGATING THE DRAGONFLY DRONES?This is a real interesting story. My boyfriend, Geoff, knew about the Capitola sighting wehad up here. He had been checking out all this stuff on his own and had emailed him (TomDavis) about some thoughts on it.Geoff did show me a picture of the Capitola photo that was over a telephone pole. Ithought it was probably nothing, so I dismissed it and wasn’t paying much attention to it.But Geoff still was, though. When I happened to see this thing in the sky, I’m like, ‘Oh,my gosh, that looks kind of like what he’s talking about.’ I didn’t see a lot of the bottomhanging down or the stuff on top like the one photo, but it sure had that long pointy tip onit and I’ve never seen anything else like that.But it really happened and the more I thought about it, I thought, ‘Well, these guys areinvestigators and they are retired sheriffs, so if he wanted to hook me up to a lie detectortest, I had absolutely no problem because I honestly saw this. So I said (to Geoff), ‘Youcan go ahead and call him and email him and tell him that I would be willing to do the liedetector test so he would know I was telling the truth.' So, that’s why I was OK with Geoffcontacting Tom because I knew I could prove it. Air Traffic After DragonflyCraft DisappearedWhat’s really interesting is that about five minutes after this thing headed north fromwhere I am, a little Cessna headed south that was about 1500 or 2,000 feet. [Cam thoughtthe dragonfly object was higher, maybe even as high as 10,000 feet.]YOU COULD HEAR THE CESSNA, RIGHT?Oh, definitely! I could see and hear it (Cessna) and it made me realize how high that othermust have been. Then a little past that, a plane came south that looked like a military.Geoff thought it was a military plane because of the number of engines on it and it had thatwhite trail that comes out the back of it.I was really curious if anybody saw this on radar because those two planes came from the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"other direction not too long afterwards.DID GEOFF HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE MILITARY PLANE SHOWED UPBECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF THE DRAGONFLY?He didn’t know. He just thought it was a coincidence that all of a sudden here was this bigmilitary plane, up high enough that it had the white trail coming off the back of it, and wedon’t see those that often up here.” Cam Sketch, April 2, 2008“Winged” Body Like May 2006, Birmingham, Alabama?Cam made another drawing of the dragonfly aerial body for Earthfiles.com on April 2,2008.Cam of Scotts Valley, California, made this second sketch on April 2, 2008,of the wingless, dragonfly aerial craft she saw at 10:15 AM on Monday,March 31, 2008. The aerial craft moved tail first in the sky. “It seemed like a stainlesssteel color. It did not seem super shiny.” Sketch © 2008 by Cam for Earthfiles.com.What intrigues me is that when I asked Cam to look at all the 2006 and 2007 dragonflyphotos and pick the one shape (not size) closest to her own sighting, she picked May 2006,in Birmingham, Alabama. That aerial dragonfly craft was also above a power pole andphotographed by a military subcontractor. The reason for this selection, Cam explained,are the triangular “wings” that protrude from the sides of the ring body. She thought theround body of her Scotts Valley sighting had protrusions to the sides as well. Further, thesegmented tail in the Birmingham May 2006 photograph reminded her of the segments inthe much longer tail of the craft she saw."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Odd, aerial object above power poles near construction site in May 2006,in Birmingham, Alabama. Photo by John Smith, military subcontractor. When you look at a map of the locations where people have seen or photographed thedragonfly aerial drone in California, it's from Big Basins Redwood State Park and Saratogato Scotts Valley and Capitola and then going east to Yosemite National Park and SequoiaNational Park. Private investigators, Tom Davis and Frank Dixon, also think that the May2007 dragonfly drone photographs by the man who called himself “Chad” were taken notin the Bakersfield region, but up closer to the Capitola area. Directly to the east of theparks is the China Lake Naval Weapons Reserve. Further south near the Northridge Mall,a suburb of Los Angeles, another eyewitness on May 17, 2006, at 10 PM, saw a green,glowing aerial object shaped “like a horseshoe crab with a long tail.” China Lake Naval Weapons Center"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Upper left red dot marks Sequoia National Park and Forest where Shirley P.and her father saw the dragonfly drone twice in May 2005.

Confidentiality is always honored.More Information:Kris Avery's Letter to io9.com:“ The videos I created, which eventually culminated into the music video for 'Drone' themusician are all inspired by the original photos. I myself am totally unsure as to theorigin of the images beyond what I already known.. i.e., anonymous witnesses.Since then, I have been accused of being the originator of the whole drone saga, andthe photos were in fact just a viral campaign to promote the eventual video. This isdefinitely NOT the truth. In a way, I wish it had been, because that would make mesome kind of viral genius, and I'd be in completely the wrong job lol.I was involved in the discussions on OMF, Alien casebook, and other places formonths, and the whole thing just reached a real frustrating deadlock between thebelievers and the non-believers ... or real/hoax argument. I'd made my point until Iwas blue in the face, and was met by people telling me that the CG I had createdwas nowhere near as good as what was being shown in the photos. So I knuckleddown and set out to create a video and images that would shut them up. So really, itis the very people who refused to believe CG was capable of creating the images thatpushed me on.It is bizarre really. I'm not sure what people think I am, but honestly, I am just anormal guy who does 3D graphics for a living. I pay my bills, have a girlfriend, a dog,and am currently looking at doing a bit of decorating around the house.”For further information about the dragonfly-shaped aerial craft phenomenon, please seerelated Earthfiles reports below in the Earthfiles Archive:• 03/21/2008 — Part 2, Dragonfly-Shaped Aerial Craft: Current Media Misinformation VersusEyewitnesses 1987 to 2007• 03/09/2008 — Viewer Comments About Drone Mystery and Homeland Security Ban?
