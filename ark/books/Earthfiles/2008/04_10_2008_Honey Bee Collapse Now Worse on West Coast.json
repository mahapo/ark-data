So, it's bad. And there are a lot of good,big beekeepers that are having a lot of problems. I think we're comingin for a big train wreck.” - Gilly Sherman, BeekeeperWestern honey bee, or European honey bee (Apis mellifera),gathering pollen from purple aster. 34% of American honey bees incommercial hives have disappeared this spring of 2008, in apersistent mystery known as “colony collapse disorder.”April 10, 2008 Gainesville, Florida - On April 5, 2008, England's BBC News carried areport entitled, “U. S. Fears Over Honey Bee Collapse.” A California beekeeper, GillySherman, was interviewed and he said sobering words: “It's worse than last year, and lastyear was worse than the year before. So, it's bad. And there are a lot of good, bigbeekeepers that are having a lot of problems. I think we're coming in for a big trainwreck.”I took that quote to Jerry Hayes, Chief, Apiary Section, Florida Department of Agriculture,and President of the Apiary Inspectors of America in Gainesville, Florida and asked for hiscomment.Interview:Jerry Hayes, Chief, Apiary Section, Florida Department of Agriculture, andPresident of the Apiary Inspectors of America in Gainesville, Florida: “CertainlyWest Coast beekeepers were more dramatically affected this year than perhaps East Coastbeekeepers. Last year, East Coast beekeepers had the first and dramatic events happeningto their bee colonies. Sometimes, the West Coast beekeepers said, ‘Well, it’s not happeningto us. You must just be bad beekeepers.’ So, now the shoe is on the other foot and they aresuffering as badly as anybody has been. Everybody is on an even playing field right now.Bees are not healthy. Bees have not been healthy for a few years and they are becomingmore unhealthy. The beekeepers, the industry that uses them as a tool, is in a precarioussituation.SO WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THE BEEKEEPER QUOTED BY THE BBC NEWS,‘I THINK WE’RE COMING IN FOR A BIG TRAIN WRECK’?We’ll never know these things until after the train wreck. It certainly does not look good.I’ve been reading some reports about whole populations of bats dying and disappearing inthe Northeast. The quail population in the southeast has virtually disappeared. I don’tknow if any of these things have parallels and links, but it certainly is interesting thatsomething in the environment is impacting these other animals.WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATE OF COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER IN THEUNITED STATES AND CANADA?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 34% Bee Loss in U. S. by Spring 2008The Apiary Inspectors of America (AIA), of which I am a part – we just completed asurvey of 327 beekeepers and we came up with about a 34% loss rate over this past 2007to 2008 winter season.THAT’S EVEN MORE THAN LAST YEAR?Yes, a little bit. [ 2007 estimated American loss was 25%.]GOING INTO THIS SPRING OF 2008, WHAT ARE YOUR GREATEST WORRIES?Beekeepers cannot continue to take these kinds of losses and rebound in any kind of way. Cause of Colony Collapse Disorder?“Unfortunately, we still don’t have a clear picture of why this is happening.”THE LAST TIME WE TALKED, IT WAS THE ISRAELI VIRUS UNDER SUSPICIONOF COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES THROUGH AUSTRALIAN BEES THATHAD BEEN BROUGHT IN BECAUSE THE NORTH AMERICAN BEE POPULATIONHAD BEEN WEAKENED. IS THERE EVIDENCE THAT THE ISRAELI ACUTEPARALYSIS VIRUS IS STILL CAUSING THE MORTALITY? OR IS THERE STILLSOMETHING TO BE FOUND? WHAT IS CAUSING ONE-THIRD OF ALL THE BEESIN THE UNITED STATES TO DISAPPEAR IN THE WINTER OF 2007 TO SPRING OF2008?[ Editor’s Note: See 090707 Earthfiles: Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus (IAPV)September 2007 journal, Science.]Boy, if I knew that, I’d probably have a statue some place, Linda. Obviously it’s all theissues that are still on the table right now. Viruses – whether it’s the Israeli Acute ParalysisVirus, or other viruses that are known and impact honey bees? There again, pesticides,poor nutrition, stress whatever that is from moving bees back and forth, a shallow geneticpool in our managed bee colonies. Somehow, all these things are interacting. Basically, weneed more funds in order to hire smart people and expensive equipment to figure what isgoing on. Research is never quick.DID YOU EXPECT AN INCREASE IN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF BEES IN NORTHAMERICA?I was personally interested to find out if it was going to continue and to find out what wasgoing to happen to our West Coast beekeepers that seemed to have dodged a bit of thebullet last year. I was hoping that it would not, but I knew that something like this justgenerally does not go away on its own.BUT ARE YOU SURPRISED THAT THE WEST COAST BEEKEEPERS ARE BEINGHIT HARD NOW IN 2008?No, not really. You know how things spread – if this is a pathogen or something in whichall populations are not hit equally. So, it was unfortunately their turn.HAS THE ISRAELI ACUTE PARALYSIS VIRUS BEEN FOUND IN THE WEST COASTHONEY BEES?Yes, it’s there, but not at any dramatic levels. In fact, there’s kind of an East Coast variantand a West Coast variant of the Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus. There’s also the Kashmir beevirus that has shown up in quite large numbers. Then you add in all the other things wetalked about that could cause the immune system collapse. All those things are interacting.SO, IN APRIL 2008, YOU CAN’T SAY EVEN NOW THAT IT IS THE ISRAELI VIRUSTHAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MOST OF COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER?No, because in the CCD, the Israeli acute paralysis virus was found in most of the samplesand at the moment is considered just a marker. It was not present in tremendously highnumbers. And we can’t say it’s the varroa mite because in CCD, varroa and trachea mitesare in very low levels. The Nosema protozoan was found in less than 50% of the colonies.Unfortunately, we still don’t have a clear picture of why this is happening."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Future Almond and Other AmericanCrop Pollinations in Jeopardy?WITH A 33% DISAPPEARANCE RATE SO FAR IN 2008, WHAT HAPPENS TOALMOND POLLINATION AND CROPS BECAUSE THEY WERE STRETCHED LASTYEAR TRYING TO IMPORT ENOUGH BEES FROM THE EAST COAST ANDAUSTRALIA TO GET THE ALMOND GROVES POLLINATED. WHAT HAPPENSNOW WITH EVEN MORE BEES DISAPPEARING?Well, almond pollination is over right now. And most of the bees fell apart during ortowards the end of almond pollination. I think the almond guys got by in good shape, sothey don’t care as long as they get pollination for next year because this year is over with.To them, honey bees are an input, just like fertilizer, pesticides and fungicides. So, untilnext year, the almond growers probably don’t care.WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL THE OTHER CROPS THAT ARE DEPENDENT UPONHONEY BEES, IF THEY HAVE FALLEN APART IN SUCH GREAT NUMBERSTRYING TO POLLINATE THE ALMOND CROP?That’s a great question. The bees are coming back to Florida now and we’re talking aboutwatermelon pollination. And then the bees will be moving north for blueberries and applesand cranberries. But yours is a good question and I don’t have an answer for it at thismoment in time. U. S. Headed for Reliance OnInternational Food Imports”The USDA projects that something like 40% of our vegetablesare going to be coming from China in 2012 or some date like that and theU. S. is going to be a net food importer in fifty years.”I’d like to see people at the federal level and others realize how important honey bees are! But if people don’t care where food comes from, if people are happy that food is at thegrocery store and they don’t care how it gets to the grocery store, then maybe all thisconcern is a moot point. People have to care about this. The USDA projects that somethinglike 40% of our vegetables are going to be coming from China in 2012 or some date likethat and the U. S. is going to be a net food importer in fifty years.We already have someone who has us by the nose for energy production, oil (MiddleEast). And so now, we’re going to turn our food production over to someone else? This allhas larger strategic implications than just honey bees. This is talking about the food supplyand how secure our food supply is in the United States?So, I just hope that people realize how important honey bees are and somehow givesupport. We support sugar people. We have been throwing money at the corn people foryears and everything else. Why not honey bees, if they are important? Implications for Increasing Declineof American Honey Bees?“If the almond people come up short, my guess is that probably the Mexicans willpetition to bring their Africanized bee colonies across the border to fill that gap. Andthat will probably destroy the U.S. commercial beekeeping industry.”YOU AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT COLONY COLLAPSE DISORDER ANDTHE DISAPPEARANCE OF SO MANY HONEY BEES IN THE UNITED STATES ANDCANADA NOW FOR A YEAR. I THINK I THOUGHT, AS A REPORTER, THAT BYTHE SPRING OF 2008 THAT WE WOULD BE SEEING A RESTORATION OFBETTER HEALTH TO THE BEES AND THAT EVERYTHING MIGHT BE GETTINGBETTER. THE FACT THAT IT’S GONE DOWN HILL EVEN MORE, THE FACT THATEVEN MORE BEES HAVE DISAPPEARED THROUGH THE WINTER OF 2007 TO2008, THE FACT THAT AFTER THE ALMOND POLLINATION THAT, TO USE YOURWORDS, ‘THE BEES ARE FALLING APART IN THE UNITED STATES.’ WHAT"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HAPPENS WHEN EVERYTHING IS GOING DOWN HILL IN APRIL?There might be crops that are potentially impacted and as the almond acreage grows, thealmond growers will try to use every honey bee colony in the United States. If the almondpeople come up short, my guess is that probably the Mexicans will petition to bring theirAfricanized bee colonies across the border to fill that gap. And that will probably destroythe U.S. commercial beekeeping industry.BUT WOULD YOU AND OTHERS IN AGRICULTURE ALLOW THAT TO OCCUR?I’m just a mid-level civil servant. The almond people and value of the almond crop –money talks in our capitalistic society and the almond people will not be denied.BUT DO YOU SERIOUSLY MEAN THERE COULD BE A DECISION THAT WOULDBE ONLY POLITICAL AND ECONOMICAL FOR THE ALMOND INDUSTRY THATCOULD END UP BRINGING IN AFRICANIZED BEES THAT WOULD DESTROYTHE REST OF THE NORTH AMERICAN HONEY BEE?It’s very possible.THAT IS ACTUALLY BEING DISCUSSED NOW AS AN OPTION?I didn’t make that up! (laughs)I’M VERY DISTRESSED TO HEAR THIS.Me, too. A Year from Now in 2009?“(Richard Adee, largest beekeeper in U. S.) is truthfully shell shocked and numb anddoesn’t know what to do. You can’t replace 60,000 colonies overnight.”GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE PERCENTAGE IN THE NUMBER OF BEESDISAPPEARING IN 2008 IS EVEN HIGHER THAN IT WAS IN 2007, AND THAT THEBEE HEALTH IS NOT GOOD, WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT TO BE THE STATUS AYEAR FROM NOW IN 2009?I don’t know. I don’t know if this is Darwin in action and that this might go away as theweak are culled out and the strong survive – because if this continues on for another yearor two, there won’t be many commercial beekeepers left. There will be some smallbeekeepers left, but not of the size that can load up colonies on semi-trucks and take themover the United States.The largest beekeeper in the United States [ Richard Adee Honey Farms, Brookings, SouthDakota], I think lost 60,000 colonies out of his 80,000 colonies this past late winter andspring. He had something like 100 loads of empty equipment that he had to bring backfrom California. You just can’t replace those kinds of numbers very quickly.WHEN YOU TALK TO THAT LARGE HONEY BEE KEEPER, WHAT IS HISASSESSMENT, TALKING TO YOU, ABOUT THE NEXT FEW MONTHS INTO NEXTYEAR?He is truthfully shell shocked and numb and doesn’t know what to do. You can’t replace60,000 colonies overnight.WOULDN’T THIS RISE TO A NATIONAL SECURITY LEVEL? WE’RE TALKINGABOUT THE LOSS OF POLLINATORS THAT AFFECT SO MUCH OF OUR FOODSUPPLY?You would think so. Obviously, Senator Boxer is meeting tomorrow. So, certainly at highlevels of the government, there is interest. And of course, we’re at war and spending a lotof money on the war, and money can be authorized, but is it appropriated? So, the wholepolitical scene has to play out its course here in the way we handle things here in theUnited States.ARE YOU OPTIMISTIC OR PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF HONEY BEESIN THE UNITED STATES AND CANADA?I’m pessimistic. We have a tendency to wait until a crisis happens in western civilization.We might lose control of our food supply at some point."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"IF ONE-THIRD OF THE HONEY BEE POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATESDISAPPEARED IN THE 2007 TO 2008 WINTER-SPRING, AND IF NEXT YEAR, THEPERCENTAGE CLIMBS TO ABOUT A 50% LOSS, HAS THERE EVER BEEN A TIMEIN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY IN WHICH HALF OF THE HONEY BEEPOPULATION DISAPPEARED AND WAS ABLE TO COME BACK?Boy, not that I’m aware. We are in a precarious situation strategically for maintaining foodsupplies for our population. We need to have somebody at some level decide that honeybees are important. It’s like a lot of other agricultural industries in the U. S. – the Chinesehave basically wiped out the American apple industry; the Brazilians have virtually wipedout the citrus juice industry; and these trends continue. Maybe this is the natural order ofthings.DOESN’T IT SEEM THAT THIS WOULD BE ABSOLUTELY THE OPPOSITE OF THENATURAL ORDER OF THINGS?Yes, I would agree with you, but I’m a pragmatist and the low-cost producer gets theorders. It doesn’t make any difference where it’s produced or how it’s produced. Look atthe Chinese goods that have come in over the last year and there are other scary thingscoming in, not only from them but other countries that don’t have quite the regulations andpesticides and chemical oversight that we do. Genetically Modified Crops CouldAlso Be Killing Honey BeesIS THERE ANY MORE HARDER DATA LINKING THE GENETICALLY MODIFIEDCROPS TO THE WEAKENING AND DISAPPEARANCE OF THE HONEY BEES?Yes, that’s certainly being looked at. In fact, I read an article the other day talking aboutsome genetically modified crops that had the BT toxin in it (genetically modified cropswith built-in pesticide) and they found that with the BT toxin, there are a couple ofdifferent toxins involved, and one toxin they found was actually opening up the cell wallsof insects and animals to allow this second toxin in to affect it. So, we don’t understandwhat we do - and places such as Monsanto.So, we’re going down a precarious path and we don’t know everything. Unfortunately, wewill make mistakes as human beings, but the repercussions as things grow and becomemore global and widespread is that the repercussions will be more severe and moredramatic.SO, WHILE WE ARE PROMOTING A GM FOOD INTO THE FUTURE ON THE ONEHAND IN GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS, WE COULD BE KILLING THE VERYINSECT THAT KEEPS PLANTS ALIVE.Yes, but there again, if the seed companies can develop plants that don’t need insectpollinators, and keep selling seed to the farmers, maybe that’s the goal.WHAT I’M HEARING IN YOUR VOICE AND YOUR WORDS IS THAT YOU AREFEELING AND SENSING THAT THIS IS A VERY DEPRESSING SITUATION WITHVERY LITTLE LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.Boy, is that coming through my voice? I’m sorry, but yeah, it is. I’m sure there’s a light atthe end of the tunnel, but I can’t tell if it is an answer, or a train coming down the track.WHICH COMES BACK FULL CIRCLE TO THE BEEKEEPER WHO SAID TO THEBBC THIS WEEK, ‘I THINK WE’RE COMING IN FOR A BIG TRAIN WRECK.’It’s possible. We’ll know in the future. But the take home message is: honey bees are nothealthy and we, at this moment in time, have no way to make them healthier.”"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"On March 29, 2007, Brent Halsall, President, OntarioBeekeeper's Assoc., Greely, Ontario, Canada, opened his hivesand found about 40% of all his bees dead - some dried up;others fresh as if not long dead.
