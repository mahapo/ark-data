January 25, 2008 Auckland, New Zealand - A professor in Auckland, New Zealand,published a paper in December that seriously raises the question: could we be in a virtualreality world and universe where the “computer” behind-the-scenes has a processingspeed of 186,282.397 miles per second - the maximum speed of light? The professor isBrian Whitworth, Ph.D., in Information Systems and now Senior Lecturer at the Institutefor Information and Mathematical Sciences at Massey University in Auckland.In his paper, he quotes from a 2005 book entitled, The World’s 20 Greatest UnsolvedProblems edited by John Vacca: “Quantum physicists who work with quantum theoryevery day don’t really know quite what to make of it. They fill blackboards with quantumcalculations and acknowledge that it is probably the most powerful, accurate andpredictive scientific theory ever developed, but the very suggestion that it might beliterally true as a description of Nature is still greeted with cynicism, incomprehension andeven anger.”Click to Amazon Orders.Professor Whitworth’s goal is to provide another model in which cosmologists might lookat our universe that is not hamstrung by the paradoxes in trying to make sense of aphysically objective universe in which all the underlying processing creating the universe is"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"defined by quantum mechanics in which not even an atom can be directly measured intime and space because quantum mechanics says it is in all places at once.Professor Whitworth has worked for decades in mathematics and information systems andfinds many analogies in the computer world to how quantum mechanics says this universeactually works.I talked with him this week and began by asking him what the reaction has been from hisacademic colleagues.Interview:Brian Whitworth, Ph.D., Information Systems,Massey University, Auckland, New ZealandBrian Whitworth, Ph.D., Information Systems, Senior Lecturer, Institute forInformation and Mathematical Sciences, Massey University, Auckland, NewZealand: “The most common comment you would expect is, ‘You can’t prove it.’ But ifyou think about it, let’s suppose that everybody thought the world was a virtual reality.They were brought up from childhood to believe this. And you one day had the idea that itwas an objective reality – that it was not created by computer processing, that it was justactually there in existence. And I said to you, ‘OK, why don’t you prove it?’ I think youwould have a bit of trouble proving it.You could say, ‘Well, I know the world is objective because I experience it.’People would reply, ‘But you only experience your input.’And someone might say, ‘Well, I have lots of mathematical laws that can predict things.’And the other says, ‘Well, of course you do because it’s all based on mathematics.’Then you say, ‘Look, the universe is enormous! It’s huge!! How can it possibly be a virtualreality to be so big?’And the other would say, ‘It’s only big to you. It’s only big to people inside it.’And you might say, ‘But it’s been going for billions of years!’And the other might say, ‘Well, that might be just a few seconds of processing. Nobodyreally knows.’And so on. You would actually find it quite difficult to prove your case. So, I guess thepoint is that people assume that objective reality is a proven theory, but it is not. It’s anaxiom just as unproven as virtual reality theory.So from a scientific perspective, neither objective reality nor virtual reality is proven. Andwhat is happening is that modern physics with things like time dilation and spacecontraction, teleportation, multi-existence and so on, seem actually more supportive of avirtual reality universe than an objective reality one. Mass Increasing Toward Speed of LightTHE STRONGEST PIECE THAT SUPPORTS THE VIRTUAL REALITY FROM YOUR"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"POINT OF VIEW IS WHAT?There are a lot. For example, as objects go faster and faster, their mass increases. They getheavier and heavier. As they approach the speed of light, their mass increases to infinity,in theory. So, how come? If the world is physically objective, how can mass just get biggerand bigger and bigger just because a thing goes faster and faster?HOW DOES VIRTUAL REALITY ANSWER THAT QUESTION?There is a fixed amount of processing available, let’s say, in space. So, if an object is beingpassed from point to point in space, there’s only a certain amount of processing availableto each point in space, OK? And if that processing is involved in the calculation ofmovement, that changes the processing. The smaller and smaller amount that is left makesthe mass seem greater and greater.MEANING THAT THE PROCESSING ABILITY IS BEING USED UP?Being used up in the movement, and that leaves a smaller and smaller amount left over todo the mass, which then changes the mass. In other words, the processing takes longer todo what it has to do. The idea is that each part of space is like a network. None of theseare new ideas and each network is like a mini-processor.BUT THEY HAVE TO BE COORDINATED BY SOME BIG PROCESSOR WITH ACAPITAL ‘P’?Well, that’s one of the questions, isn’t it? Speed of Light Is Virtual Reality Processing SpeedYES, AND THIS IS WHERE YOU GET TO THE SPEED OF LIGHT. CAN YOUEXPLAIN WHY IN A VIRTUAL REALITY UNIVERSE THERE IS A SPEED OFLIGHT?Yes, it’s just like a screen. Your screen has a certain rate with which it refreshes, whichdepends upon the little points that make up the screen. And each of these points can onlyflash on and off at a certain rate. So when a pixel moves across the screen, what it meansis that it starts off and one point flashes. Then that point turns off and the next pointflashes and so on. So, the rate of movement depends on the rate of flashing of the screen.It’s the refresh rate and it might be 70 megahertz; it might be 80 megahertz ... Butwhatever it is, it doesn’t matter. That’s going to mean that a dot can move across yourscreen so fast and no faster.THAT WOULD BE THE SPEED OF LIGHT IN THIS UNIVERSE.That would be the speed of light that we see, yes.THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE QUESTION ABOUT WHY WOULD THERE BE AMAXIMUM SPEED OF LIGHT.Yes, it explains that question in relationship to space. Each point of space has a fixedamount of processing – a finite amount of allocation. So things that are moving point-to-point in space can only be processed at a certain rate. Then, the speed of light is therefresh rate of space. Big Bang = “Computer” Turns OnWHAT THEN IS THE BIG BANG?The Big Bang is when the simulation was started, when the virtual processing began.WHEN THE COMPUTER IS TURNED ON, RIGHT?Well, we don’t know it’s a computer. We only know it’s processing and the theory doesnot postulate any hardware or any machines running in another world or so. It just keepsaway from that.A lot of people have trouble with the idea that Time began at the Big Bang. I know Icertainly did – and that space began. How can Time begin? Surely something must havecaused Time to begin, but how can you cause anything if there is no Time to have a priorevent?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"But if you say we’re in a virtual reality, or local reality, then the Big Bang is when ourTime began and our Space began. That is perfectly reasonable. So, if you go online toSecond Life or something, when you switch on your computer and enter the reality. That’swhen that Time - or perhaps when Second Life was created – that’s when its Time began.[ Editor’s Note: “Second Life is an online, 3D virtual world imagined andcreated entirely by its Residents online.” See: http://secondlife.com/ ]THEN A SINGULARITY, A BIG BANG, WOULD BE THE EQUIVALENT OFTURNING ON THE COMPUTER.Correct. And that always – because it’s digital – it has to start at a particular point and aparticular Time and that Time is when your operating system – let’s say it’s Windows or aMac – at that specific time, the clock of that session has started up.NOW, IN THESE ANALOGIES BETWEEN THE COMPUTER WORLD’S VIRTUALREALITY AND THIS UNIVERSE WE’RE TRYING TO UNDERSTAND, HOWWOULD YOUR AXIOM OR HYPOTHESIS EXPLAIN WHY THIS VIRTUALUNIVERSE WOULD SEEM NOW TO BE EXPANDING AT AN EXPONENTIAL RATEINTO SOME INFINITY?That’s one of the questions that I’m thinking about! (laughs) So, if anyone has any ideas,including you, let me know! I guess the alternative would be that it starts at a particularsize and particular dimension. In that case, you would have to decide how big it was goingto be, wouldn’t you? PixelsFurther, if you are playing a game in a virtual world on a computer, are you the pixels?I’M HEARING YOUR QUESTION, I’M WATCHING THE COMPUTER SCREEN THATI’M IN FRONT OF THAT HAS PIXELS. BUT FROM MY POINT OF VIEW, I AMOUTSIDE THE SCREEN AND I'M CONTROLLING WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THECOMPUTER SCREEN, AT LEAST IN TERMS OF SELECTING THE PROGRAMS I’MUSING AND HOW I’M GOING TO EDIT. THEREFORE, I WOULD SAY THAT ‘I,’THE INTELLIGENCE OUTSIDE MY COMPUTER SCREEN, AM NOT APART OFTHE PIXELS I AM WATCHING.Yes, and your avatar (body-mind-spirit representative) is like the little moving arrow thatyour mouse generates on the screen, correct? That’s what acts for you.YES.That’s your little hand or sort of like your body.RIGHT.Now, if the physical world is a virtual reality that does not necessarily imply that ourconsciousness is in the virtual reality. It could be exactly the same as your playing anavatar in a game. It’s conceivable that while everything you see and hear is definitely partof the pixels – or certainly, part of the virtual reality – it’s possible that you are not lookingfrom inside the virtual reality.This relates to very deep questions about whether a mechanical universe could createconsciousness. I must admit I haven’t worked through all these things yet, but it’s certainlysomething that has concerned a lot of people from Descartes on.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - René Descartes (March 31, 1596 - February 11,1650) was a highly influential French philosopher, mathematician, scientist,and writer. He has been dubbed the Father of Modern Philosophy and theFather of Modern Mathematics. Much of subsequent Western philosophy is areaction to his writings, which continue to be studied closely, even to thepresent day. The Cartesian coordinate system that is used in plane geometryand algebra was named for him.Initially, Descartes arrived at only a single principle: thought exists. Thoughtcannot be separated from me, therefore, I exist (Discourse on the Method andPrinciples of Philosophy). Most famously, this is known as cogito ergo sum(Latin: “I think, therefore, I am.” Or, Dubito, ergo cogito, ergo sum (Latin: “ Idoubt, therefore I think, therefore I am.”) Descartes concluded that he can becertain that he exists because he thinks. ]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ALL OF THIS KEEPS LEADING TO THE QUESTION OF CONSCIOUSNESS WITH ACAPITAL ‘C,’ OR INTELLIGENCE WITH A CAPITAL ‘I,’ THAT WOULD BERESPONSIBLE FOR CREATING THE VIRTUAL REALITY UNIVERSE.You want to step out of this world and see what is going on elsewhere. And that’s notreally possible. But the second question is whether the interface of pixels is everythingthere is. That is a different question.BUT THE PIXELS WOULD NOT BE THE PRIME INTELLIGENCE ORCONSCIOUSNESS THAT CREATED THE PIXELS.The postulate is that the physical universe – if indeed it is a virtual reality – cannot createitself out of itself. It’s just not possible. So, there must be Something outside of it.Therefore, quantum mechanics is describing that Something. The equations of quantummechanics, which are quite different from our concepts of physical reality, are describingthis Something. The idea is that what we are seeing as we walk around is just an interfacewhich is calculated at the moment when we look, sort of an on-demand thing.Now, we’re just working from analogies here. If we compare to a person playing acomputer game and they are running around in the forest on the screen gathering thingsand fighting monsters and exploring, then their body would correspond to the avatar, thepixels that are running around. But in that particular case, we can see that they themselvesare not actually in the interface. They are outside the interface. But they might becomecompletely identified with the interface. They might get to such a point that they don’thear anyone around them talking to them and all they can see is the interface. But whetherthat is true in our case, I don’t know. That’s a question. Intelligence Behind Virtual Reality -Mechanical? Or God?YOUR HYPOTHESIS ABOUT THIS BEING A VIRTUAL REALITY UNIVERSEWOULD IMPLY A KIND OF PROOF OF INTELLIGENCE AND CONSCIOUSNESSON THE OUTSIDE THAT CAN CREATE THE VIRTUAL REALITY UNIVERSE.MANY PEOPLE WOULD SAY THAT IS GOD OR ALLAH OR WHATEVER THEWORDS ARE FOR THE FORCE BEHIND ALL LIFE.I think if you are looking for a final definitive, it’s this. I know if I was creating theuniverse, I wouldn’t leave that as an option. I’d leave them guessing. (laughs)WHICH IS EXACTLY WHERE EVERYBODY IS!Yes, and I don’t think we need to know everything. The number one thing we’re looking atat this point is whether this theory is useful. Physics is really in a bind at the moment. It’sgot a whole lot of problems created by quantum mechanics effects. Physics – objectiverealism – are facing these paradoxes that it probably will never solve. There’s no possiblesolution.String theory was supposed to come running to the rescue, but string theory seems boggeddown at the moment in a mire of complexity that is not coming out. There are moreversions of string theory than there are atoms in the world or universe! (laughter) Quantum Physics \"Is In A Bind\"Quantum physics is in a bind. What I am suggesting is that this particular (virtual reality)approach might be useful because it frees up the options for people to think about differenttypes of processing and how it might work.The problem is that a lot of people bring very fixed ideas to this. They have their idea ofGod or thinking there is a computer in the sky, or thinking there is a Matrix and we’re allbeing harvested, or the world is a dream and so on.BUT YOU CAN’T HAVE INTELLIGENCE AND THOUGHT AND BE DISCUSSINGWHAT WE ARE DISCUSSING AND NOT IMMEDIATELY GO IN YOUR MIND TOTHE QUESTION: WHAT WOULD BE THE INTELLIGENCE THAT WOULD CREATETHE VIRTUAL REALITY UNIVERSE? IT’S LIKE TWO SIDES OF A COIN. IF YOUHAVE A VIRTUAL REALITY UNIVERSE, SOMETHING HAD TO MAKE IT.Some processing, not just some thing. Some processing has to make it, yes. But that"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"doesn’t mean it’s a man with a beard in the sky, or it doesn’t even mean it’s only one god.It could be many gods. I mean this whole thing could be some kid playing in their room atnight when dad is not looking.IN ANOTHER REALITY.BUT WHAT YOU MEAN IS THERE COULD BE SO MANY PARALLELDIMENSIONS OF REALITIES IN WHICH WE COULD BE THE SCREEN IN THEROOM OF A CHILD OF ANOTHER DIMENSION OR ANOTHER UNIVERSE.We don’t know, that’s the point. Like one of the people who emailed about the paper said,‘If I’m in a virtual reality, the graphics are great, but the plot sucks.’ (laughter) I wouldn’targue with that.EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW: WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PLOTS THATSUCK?We all want to know everything, what’s running it. But maybe that’s not the deal. Maybethat’s just not how it works.”More Information:For further reports about cosmic phenomena and mysteries, please see EarthfilesArchive:• 01/12/2008 — Our Milky Way Galaxy On Collision Course with Huge Gas Cloud - 40Million Years from Now• 08/10/2007 — Levitation Possible by Reversing Casimir Force• 08/03/2007 — The Milky Way Is Devouring the Alien Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy• 10/18/2007 — A Quantum Math Description of Parallel Universes• 05/08/2007 — Exploded Star 5 Times Brighter Than Any Supernova Seen Before• 04/12/2007 — First 2007 Crop Pattern in United States• 12/19/2006 — First Stars - Or First Black Holes - in Universe?• 11/27/2006 — Namibia Telescopes Find First \"Gamma Clock\" in Milky Way Galaxy• 01/06/2006 — Einstein's \"Spooky Action At A Distance\"• 12/04/2005 — Central Black Hole Affects Massive Perseus Galaxy Cluster• 03/03/2005 — What Made Five Strong Radio Bursts At the Center of Our Galaxy?• 06/14/2004 — Part 2 - Danger of Time Loops and Wormhole On Frenchman Mountain, NV• 10/11/2003 — Is Our Universe Finite and Shaped Like A Dodecahedron?• 09/07/2002 — Does Gravity Travel the Same Speed as Light?• 12/20/2001 — Will Our Universe End With Its Final Light Frozen in Time?• 09/07/2001 — Black Hole At Center of Milky Way - More EvidenceWebsites:Brian Whitworth: http://www.massey.ac.nz/~wwiims/people/b.whitworth/MIT Center for Extreme Quantum Information Theory: http://www.rle.mit.edu/xqit/Ray Bradbury: http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north19.htmlPhilosophy and Physics: http://www.bottomlayer.com/Quantum Physics At Science Daily: http://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/matter_energy/quantum_physics/Quantum Computing: http://www.dwavesys.com/index.php?page=quantum-computing Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2010 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2010, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
