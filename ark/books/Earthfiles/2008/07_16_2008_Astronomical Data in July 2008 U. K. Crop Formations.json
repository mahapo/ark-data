Comment by Stuart Dike, Cropcircleconnector.com: “Hermetic PhilosophyThe three circles at Stanton Bridge, are extremely simplistic in form, andnothing we haven’t seen already since the dawn of crop circles. Thistriangular form of circles has appeared countless times; however, if we are togain anything from interpreting the design, we need to delve deeper into whythey have formed in this manner.An event of this kind would be totally ignored, being inevitably overshadowedby the more complex and spectacular formations we have come to expectfrom the phenomenon year after year. Although we must not spend any lesstime in trying to interpret what has occurred here, than decoding the moreimpressive designs due to form between the months of July and August."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"From my recent teachings involving Kabbalistic ideas, it has suddenly turnedon a light that a number of these formations could actually be showing usultimately the path of spiritual awareness, whether (the formations are) only afew feet across to hundreds of feet in length or diameter.Kabbalistic teaching suggests that the hidden processes were put into placewhen God uttered verbal commands and created a numerical sequence ofconsciousness or energy. This produced order in the cosmos by way of the 10sefirot and the Tree of Life. This order is reproduced by a number, theHebrew word, the English translation of the word and the modern meaning ofeach word.Without going into great depths of the Kabbalah ‘Tree of Life’ many readerswill already know of its structure with Keter (Kether) at the very top of thetree, and Malkhut (Malkuth) at the base. This is basically where humanitydwells and is the seat of our perceptions through the senses.Kabbalah Tree of Life. Source: Wikipedia.This small (triple circle) event at Stanton Bridge, I personally feel plays a hugepart in understanding the true nature of the crop circles, and how we canbreak through into higher levels of consciousness. It is showing us the lowerlevels of the ‘Tree of Life’ and the path we all need to take, as this is thecrucial step to enlightenment.If we take the lower circle (in image above by John Montgomery), this iscalled ‘Objective Consciousness.’ This is where we are here and now. It is alsothe place where we make the decision to act. Many teachings of Freud andJung have told us that we must proceed directly from ObjectiveConsciousness to Sub-Consciousness. This would be too hard for many peopleto undertake, and if we return to the Stanton Circles, we have no path to take.What this design could be showing us is an alternative path, which will allowus to truly understand ourselves before we are ready for the next journey. Sofrom the base circle of ‘Objective Consciousness,’ we move to Desire (topright circle). This takes us straight to our power house and the source of ourmotivation.From Desire we go to Intellect (top left circle). This is the source of ourbeliefs. This is where we must examine our faith and our belief system. Next,we return to Objective Consciousness (base circle) so that we can act withdesire and belief. From that point, we can then move to Sub-Consciousnessand then to Cosmic Consciousness. If the Stanton Circles had these twoelements attached to the design, it would have completed the bottom portionof the ‘Tree of Life’ However, how many times have we witnessed the classicdumbbell design with the two circles connected together! Is this (third circleand beyond to complete Tree of Life) the other part of our journey?”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Analysis by “ Red Collie” scientist from Australia: “Stanton St. Bernard three circle formation reported on July 4, 2008, is theMayan number 3.Mayan number system of dots and lines prepared by Red Collie,Australian scientist, for his 2007 comments about crop formation reportedAugust 12, 2007, at Stanton St. Bernard in Wiltshire County, England.A year earlier on August 12, 2007, the Mayan number 6 appeared at StantonSt. Bernard, Wiltshire, England.

The August 12, 2007, crop formation had two meanings: (a) six days left untilAugust 18, 2007, which was an inferior conjunction between Venus and ourSun, or (b) six Sun-Venus conjunctions left until Venus transit on June 6, 2012.The 2007 crop formation showed planetary locations of Jupiter, Saturn, Marsor Moon on several Sun-Venus conjunctions leading up to June 6, 2012.A crop picture from Secklendorf, Germany on June 23, 2008, used an ancientMayan Sun-Venus calendar of 104 years to date when their Long Countcalendar would end on December 21, 2012, see below in this Earthfiles reportand originally HERE.Now, on July 4, 2008, the Mayan number 3 has appeared at Stanton Bridge.

Given the long period of time which it represents, all nine planets of oursolar system need to be shown in order to mark its end uniquely. Such a cleverastronomical diagram was shown at Avebury Manor on July 15, 2008. All nineplanets appear there precisely as they will be located in space four andone-half years from now on December 23, 2012, with one exception.Thus, the outermost planet Pluto has been drawn in this new crop picturesomewhat further to the right (or closer to Neptune) than should be the case.Yet Pluto still seems to be located correctly relative to the crossover of itshighly elliptical orbit with the orbit of Neptune.
