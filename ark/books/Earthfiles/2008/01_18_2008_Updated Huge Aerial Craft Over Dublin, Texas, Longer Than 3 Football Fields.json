I’ve never seen anything like this.”- Ricky Sorrells, Metal Welder and Machinist, Dublin, TexasA triangle of three small tow ns southwest of Fort Worth includes Stephenville,a city in and the county seat of Erath County, Texas, population 14,921 in 2000 census.Dublin about eight miles southwest has a population of 3,754. Straight eastof Dublin about ten miles is Selden with a full time population of about seven. Updated with computer graphic illustration below on January 24, 2008January 18, 2008 Dublin, Texas - The first week of January 2008, came with shocks forat least three dozen people living in Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas, southwest ofFort Worth. The shocks were yellow, red, blue and white lights that showed up after sunset– lights so bright that eyewitnesses compared them to a welder’s torch.Some of the red lights moved together in pairs. Other red, blue and yellow lights movedaround as if “dancing” with each other and then would all turn to a bright, white light anddisappear.Even pilots were eyewitnesses and estimated unidentified lights moving at least 3,000miles per hour.One of those pilots is Steve Allen of Selden, Texas, not far from Glen Rose. Mr. Allen isowner of L & S Enterprises and Texas Freight in Glen Rose. It was Tuesday, January 8,about 6:15 PM when he noticed flashing, white lights about 3,500 feet above the ground.He told ABC network News that the lights formed a rectangle pattern that “spanned abouta mile long and a half mile wide and the pattern was headed toward Stephenville at 3,000miles per hour.”While watching, Mr. Allen said the white lights changed into two sets of huge rectangularpatterns in the sky and then disappeared. But 10 minutes later, the lights returned and“ two military jets, possibly F-16s, were in pursuit.”That was Tuesday, January 8. A week before on or around New Year’s Day, 37-year-oldmetal welder and machinist Ricky Sorrells felt like going deer hunting in the back woods ofhis Dublin, Texas, home that he shares with his wife and two daughters. Dublin is only"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"about 8 miles west of Stephenville. Both of those small towns form a triangle with close-bySelde n.The sun was a just lowering below some oak trees near his house and Ricky thought hehad enough time. He put on his hunting camouflage, grabbed his rifle that was set at9-Power for deer hunting, and headed for his feeders and a game trail.Little did Ricky know that he was about to encounter something so large just above hiswoods that he could not even see the edges of the huge craft. This New Years shock wouldalso be the only day light description so far of what might be flying around at night onlyvisible by the odd patterns of changing, intense lights.Interview:Ricky Sorrells, metal welder and machinist, at his Dublin, Texas, residencewhere he has seen a huge aerial craft three times since January 1, 2008.Image © 2008 by Stephenville Empire-Tribune.Ricky Sorrells, Metal Welder and Machinist, Dublin, Texas: “For some reason, I don’tknow what, I look up and look back down. I don’t know what made me look up, but then Irealized what I had seen with my eyes and immediately looked back up. There was thisthing. It covered from – I could not see the edges in my tree canopy. I couldn’t see thefront of it. I didn’t think about looking behind me to see if I could see an edge that way.BUT YOU MEAN THAT ABOVE YOU THE SKY IS NOW COMPLETELYOBLITERATED BY SOMETHING THAT IS COMPLETELY UNKNOWN TO YOU?Yes, ma’am. How far underneath it I was, I’m not for sure, but apparently I walkedunderneath this thing. When I first realized it and looked up, I thought: ‘What in the worldis this?’I raised my rifle up and because I was in such a hurry to go deer hunting and knew I wasgoing into the woods, I did not turn it (hunting scope) down from 9X to 3X. So, when Iraised my rifle up, it’s still on 9X. It was real blurry. I immediately turned down my riflescope power to 3X and I looked back up there at it and I can see what I would call a‘mirage’ coming off of it. It wasn’t steam. I don’t know really – I’ve seen it like on a hothighway how the heat waves come up. And this was coming down.I really didn’t know what to think. I was not scared, so I dropped my gun. And then Ireally started noticing how big this thing was. I also noticed that it had these roundindentations.They were in a grid pattern all running left to right, and front to back. They were all placedabout 40 feet apart. They were deep, like maybe 4 to 6 feet deep into this craft. It basicallylooked like a piece of sheet iron that had been pressed. I couldn’t see any nuts, no bolts,no rivets, no welds, no seams. I was really studying the structure of this trying to get anidea about how it was built."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Ricky Sorrells drew for Earthfiles his perspective looking up through the trees on his propertyat a “tin barn grey” metal emitting “mirage heat waves” and embedded with cone-shaped holes he thoughtwere equally separated by forty feet over the entire surface of the aerial craft above him. Ricky judged that theaerial craft was 300 feet above him and the trees. He also estimated the surface diameter of the coneswas about six feet, tapering another six to eight feet down into a cone-shaped hole that endedin a three-foot-diameter circle. Below is a drawing focused on one of the cone-shaped holes.Drawings © 2008 by Ricky Sorrells for Earthfiles.com.Close-up of one of the many cone-shaped holes embedded into the surface of the aerial craftthat obliterated the sky above Ricky Sorrells on January 1, 2008, and above the woods on his Dublin, Texas,property where Ricky had gone to hunt deer.

IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY, THESE ARE HOLES IN THE BOTTOMOF THIS GIGANTIC OBJECT ABOVE YOU, BUT THE HOLES ARE IN STRAIGHTLINES.The holes, to me, are placed strategically at points equally spaced apart. They were big. Ireally don’t know how big they were, but I’m going to guess. I’m going to say from whereI was at, they were anywhere from – they looked like 3 feet wide to me down on theground, but I’m sure they were larger. Maybe 6 feet.SO THESE ARE 6 FEET IN DIAMETER, 6 FEET ACROSS, HOLES THAT AREPENETRATING INTO THE BOTTOM OF THIS OTHERWISE FLAT METALLICSURFACE?Yes, ma’am. They go up, they dome up to another small circle at the top (deeper in thecraft skin). They are indented.If you’ll visualize the inside edges penetrating to a smaller diameter circle which was"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"smaller than half the larger circle on the surface.SO, LIKE A CONE?Ye s .GOING FROM 6 FEET AND TAPERING DOWN TO APPROXIMATELY 3 FEET,STILL BEING CIRCULAR. HOW MUCH DISTANCE DO Y OU THINK IT WAS FROMTHE FLAT SURFACE WHERE THE HOLES BEGAN TO WHERE THEY TAPEREDINTO THOSE 3-FOOT-DIAMETER CONE BOTTOMS, SO TO SPEAK?Boy, I don’t know. Again, I couldn’t see any rivets, bolts or welds to give me anyindication of how far apart they were.HOW DEEP DO YOU THINK THOSE HOLES WERE?I think they would have been 8 to 10 feet, maybe. It wasn’t a short, stubby hole. It wasn’tan elongated hole. It was in proportion, if that makes sense.WERE THE HOLES CONNECTED BY ANY LINES OR GROOVES RUNNINGBETWEEN THE HOLES?No, ma’am, they were not, not that I saw. The holes were spaced out equally, front to backand left to right. But they had nothing connecting them. Color of Huge Aerial Craft Was “Barn Tin Grey”WAS THE COLOR OF THE HOLES THAT WERE SPACED ABOUT 40 FEET APARTDIFFERENT FROM THE SURFACE?No, everything was the same color. I actually have a piece of barn tin that’s been faded –it’s not rusted – and it's that color - that greyish, faded color.IS THAT CLOSE TO A SIDEWALK OR DARKER?Darker, I suppose.Ricky Sorrells worked with his computer tech colleague,Colby Reynolds in Stephenville, to provided this computer-generatedgrey color that is close to the “barn tin grey” of the huge aerialcraft embedded with cone-shaped holes.Entire Aerial CraftLooked Like A Single Mold“I don’t know how you can make a piece of metal that largewith no bolts, rivets, seams or welds.

I don’t know. I didn’t get to touch or feel it in any way. I believe it wasmaybe. I don’t know. I don’t know how you can make that – which is what baffled me inmy mind – I don’t know how you can make a piece of metal that large with no bolts,rivets, seams or welds. I’ve never seen anything like this.MEANING THAT YOU’VE SEEN EVERY ASPECT OF WELDING AND WORKINGWITH METAL, BUT YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING THAT SEEMED TO BE AGIGANTIC MOLD?Correct, it was like a huge, single mold. That’s it exactly, yes ma’am. Longer Than 3 Football FieldsRICKY, HOW HIGH DO YOU THINK THE SURFACE COVERING EVERYTHINGABOVE YOU, HOW HIGH WAS THAT ABOVE YOU?I believe it to be right at 300 feet. The reason I think this is because I’ve been on grainelevators. When I was growing up, I worked in a grain elevator for my Dad. What we hadwas a 90-foot elevator. So, I put three of these together in my head from where I was atand that’s how I get the height.IF IT’S 300 FEET ABOVE YOU AND IT’S TAKING UP ALL OF THE SKY ABOVEYOU, DO YOU HAVE ANY ESTIMATE NOW LOOKING BACK ABOUT HOW BIGTHE CRAFT MIGHT HAVE BEEN?It is huge! I’ve actually been back into the woods and looked. In my mind, I did thefootball field measurement. I know it was longer than 3 football fields.WHICH WOULD BE 900 TO 1,000 FEET LONG.Ye s .THERE WAS AN ESTIMATE BY ANOTH ER EYEWITNESS IN YOUR AREA WHO IBELIEVE SAID THEY WERE ESTIMATING WHAT THEY SAW WAS A MILE BY AHALF MILE.Yes, ma’am, that’s what I’ve heard.THAT WOULD BE 5,280 FEET BY HALF THAT."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Ye s .DO YOU THINK IT’S FEASIBLE THAT WHAT WAS ABOVE YOU THE FIRST OFJANUARY OUT IN YOUR WOODS COULD HAVE BEEN A MILE LONG?With relationship with the other two I seen after this over pretty much the same spot, frommy third time I seen it, if it was, it would not surprise me. I have not seen any edges on thisthing, on any three sightings. I have basically seen flat surfaces. If it were, it wouldn’tsurprise me because in my trees there, I just went from as far as I could see one way to asfar as I could see another way and figured it was three hundred yards.While I was looking at this (craft), it drifted to the right by about 100 feet. And Iremember looking to my left to see if I could see the edge of this thing. And I could not seethe edge of it. I turned back to my right, and I was like, ‘Wow, this is crazy!’ And now, I’mrushed with emotion as far as ‘What is it? What is it going to do next? Do I need to get outof here?’ Huge Craft Went from Stationaryto Distance in A SecondI’m actually trying to figure out about my safety, if I should be alarmed? At this moment, ifI would have blinked, I would have thought it vanished. But I did not blink. I had my eyeson it. And it takes off at a 45-degree angle, but it is still flat. It did not tilt up to take off. Itremained flat and took off at a 45-degree angle. I never heard a sound. Never felt anyheat. I’ve been back to see if it burned any trees. But it didn’t. It didn’t burn anything.WHEN IT TOOK OFF AS SOMETHING THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETWEEN 1,000AND 5,000 FEET LONG – WE DON’T KNOW, BUT IT WAS HUGE. DID YOU SEEWITH YOUR EYES IN THAT MOMENT IT TOOK OFF NEARLY VANISHING, ANYCHANGE IN LIGHT OR HEAT?No, ma’am, it was so fast, I don’t know that a person could think that fast! It was so fast, Istill couldn’t see a shape. It was like it was here and then it was gone. I didn’t see anylights. I didn’t hear any sound. I didn’t smell anything different. It took off so fast that Iguarantee you if I had blinked, I would have thought it had just vanished. Other Residents See Strange LightConfigurations After DarkIN YOUR AREA OF DUBLIN AND STEPHENSVILLE, TEXAS, YOURS RIGHT NOWIS THE ONLY DAYLIGHT SIGHTING, FOLLOWED BY TWO OTHER SIGHTINGS INDAYLIGHT?As far as I know.EVERYBODY ELSE HAS BEEN SEEING A GIGANTIC OBJECT WITH MANYLIGHTS ON IT AT NIGHT?Yes, ma’am.THE PILOT OVER IN GLENROSE, TEXAS, HE DESCRIBED FOR TELEVISION ARECTANGLE PATTERN OF LIGHTS IN THE SKY THAT APPEARED TO CHANGETO TWO RECTANGLE PATTERNS OF LIGHTS. DO YOU THINK IT’S POSSIBLETHAT THE ACTUAL SHAPE OF WHAT WAS ABOVE YOU WAS NOT THE CLASSICCIRCLE, BUT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A RECTANGLE? Ricky Sorrells Saw Huge Craft Two More TimesThe reason I don’t know the shape is the next sighting. Every evening before I go in thehouse, I chop wood. I was out there (on the porch) chopping wood and I see from my leftto my right a blip, like it came in and left. And further to my right, another blip like it camein and left. And that’s all I saw. It was very huge – very long and very flat to me. I haven’tseen a side. I haven’t seen a top. Basically I’ve seen a side view (or bottom) of it eachtime."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"AS IF IT’S ON AN ANGLE – LIKE YOU SAID THE FIRST TIME YOU WERELOOKING UP 45 DEGREES, SO YOU WERE SEEING THE FLAT SIDE OFSOMETHING THAT DOESN’T SEEM TO HAVE MUCH DIMENSION TO IT?Correct. But I do believe it has a dimension because when I did see it the second and thirdtime, the second time made me think it has a dimension. I only saw it for two blips, but itwas like a thick piece of plate. But it was a long way away, like a 1.5 to 2 miles.WHAT ABOUT THE THIRD TIME? WAS THAT AROUND JANUARY 10?Yes, about a week and a half after my first sighting and I saw it the second time inbetween.THE FIRST SIGHTING WAS OUT IN THE WOODS ON YOUR PROPERTY WHEREYOU HAD GONE TO GO DEER HUNTING. THE SECOND AND THE THIRD TIMES,YOU WERE ON THE PORCH OF YOUR DUBLIN HOUSE?Yes, on the back part of it. The third time I saw it, it came from my left to my right.This iswhen I noticed how massive it was. It was very long. From the longest point of view, thiswas the widest I had seen it. It was so long, and it was at the same angle as before, so Icould see only the side or bottom part. But what makes this unusual is I could see thebottom and I could see the same indentations I saw on the first time. And they are big. Icould see the holes and knew what I was looking at. Other Witness Night Sightings OF Colored LightsWHAT HAPPENED AFTER YOUR FIRST SIGHTING AND YOU BEGAN TO TALKWITH OTHER PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE SEEING. COULD YOU SHAREWITH US WHAT YOUR NEIGHBORS HAVE SEEN AT NIGHT.I’ve talked to one person who saw it who has been on the news. From what I gather, it haslights on it and they dance around on this object. They have no formation. They dancehowever they want to, different lights. I know when it starts taking off, the lights go to oneintense bright light.THE COLORS BEFORE IT CHANGES TO WHITE HAVE BEEN WHAT?I believe red, blue, and yellow.SO THERE ARE RED, BLUE AND YELLOW LIGHTS THAT SEEM TOSPORADICALLY AND SPONTANEOUSLY MOVE OVER SOME KIND OF LARGESURFACE AND THEN WHEN IT TAKES OFF, THE COLORS CHANGE TO WHITE?Ye s .DOES ANYONE HAVE A SENSE OF THE OBJECT'S SHAPE AT NIGHT?Not that I have heard. Helicopters and Jets Keep Flying OverSince UFOs Showed UpCOULD YOU ALSO TALK ABOUT THE MILITARY ACTIVITY THAT SEEMED TOSHOW UP RIGHT AFTER YOU HAD YOUR FIRST EXPERIENCE IN THE WOODSWITH THAT GIGANTIC THING ABOVE YOU?Yes, I have had three small helicopters and one large helicopter at first come over. Theystarted about Dublin and they came over to where I’m at. Then they would go about thesame distance further out. I could hear them and actually see them when they were overme in Dublin. I could see them when they were the same width out and I could hear themfading. They would come back and forth and then move over to another line. They moveeast and west. They always seem to come from the west when they start this thing. Theydisappeared from over Dublin so I couldn’t see them, and then the next thing I knew, theywere over my house.AS IF THEY ARE RUNNING A GRID PATTERN?Yes, as if they are running a grid pattern."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"THAT THEY WERE DETECTING SOMETHING AND THEY HAVE BEEN FLYINGGRID PATTERNS AS IF IN A SEARCH MODE?Ye s .HAVE YOU OR ANYBODY SEEN JETS SHOW UP CHASING AN OBJECT IN THESKY DAY OR NIGHT?The first three guys who came out in the newspaper said they thought it was F-15s orF-16s chasing it. My experience has been that after the helicopters – and there still is onebig helicopter that is two-bladed and it’s huge – still comes by once in awhile. But now, it’smainly jets.WHAT ARE YOU LEFT THINKING ABOUT IN TERMS OF WHERE THIS MIGHTHAVE COME FROM?(sighs) I still haven’t formed a conclusion. I really don’t know. I hope it’s our military. Ihope we have something that is this advanced. Is It Extraterrestrial Craft?IF IT’S NOT OURS?If it’s not ours, then we’re in trouble. I don’t know the capabilities of this thing to move atsuch speed that it has and as big as it is. Does it have the capability of weapons? I don’tknow. But if they can build this, I’d sure hate to see if they got mad at us! You know whatI’m saying?(laughter)RIGHT. AND THAT THE ‘THEY’ COULD BE EXTRATERRESTRIAL?I’m not dismissing that. I don’t know that it’s not the military. I really don’t know what itis. I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s fascinating me. Why it keeps coming over like itdoes, I don’t know. I would like to know that.If it was the military, I sure wish they would call me and say, ‘Hey, we’re doing this overyour place. Don’t get alarmed.’ I don’t understand. I have no answers for these questions.IF IT IS EXTRATERRESTRIAL, WHAT RESIDUE DOES THAT LEAVE YOU?Well, I don’t really know. I hadn’t thought about it. I know I do believe in God and Ibelieve in Jesus Christ. I’m a Baptist.RICKY, WHEN YOU TALK TO YOUR LONG-TIME FRIENDS WHO HAVEACTUALLY THEMSELVES SEEN THE LARGE LIGHTED OBJECT AT NIGHT, HAVEYOU ANY OF YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS QUESTION – IT IS FROM OUTERSPACE. IT IS EXTRATERRESTRIAL. WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS?Yes, a little bit. I think the main question that everybody would like answered is: If it isfrom outer space; if it is Aliens – what do they want? Why don’t they just try to makecontact with us?Surely, if they are smart enough to build something like this, they are smart enough tocommunicate with us. Why don’t they just let us know? I think that’s the question thateverybody would like answered.And if it’s not (E. T.s), - if it is the military – why are they keeping it from us? I canunderstand national security. But if they have this thing (huge craft), we don’t neednational security. That IS our national security! Why don’t they just let it out and say,‘Hey, this is us. This is what we have. Basically, if you don’t leave us alone, this is whatyou are going to get.So, I really don’t know what it is or which way to think about it. All this has happenedvery quickly in my life and trying to keep my regular life different from this has beensomething! Why Government Policy of Denialand Secrecy About UFOs?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"RICKY, WOULD YOU SAY IT IS FAIR FOR EVERY AMERICAN AND FOR EVERYCITIZEN ON THE EARTH TO REASONABLY EXPECT THAT THEIRGOVERNMENTS WOULD TELL THEM IF WE HAVE INTELLIGENCES FROMOUTER SPACE THAT CAN MAKE SOMETHING A MILE LONG AND A HALF MILEWIDE AND THE GOVERNMENT KNOWS IT. AND THEY SEND OUTHELICOPTERS AND JETS, BUT THEY TELL US THERE IS NOTHING THERE.ULTIMATELY, ISN’T THAT HUGELY UNFAIR TO THE TAX PAYING PUBLIC?Maybe if we knew what the government knows, I could answer that question better. I canunderstand maybe – if they do know something – if the government came out and said,‘Hey, OK, this is alien craft. It is a mile by half-mile. We don’t know why they are hereand we’re trying to figure it out. You know, I think it would be panic everywhere! I couldcertainly see that. If they do know, I can understand why they wouldn’t want to tell usbecause of that.BUT RICKY, YOU WERE RIGHT UNDER ONE OF THESE THINGS AND IT DIDN’TDO ANYTHING TO YOU. AND IT HASN’T DONE ANYTHING TO ANY OF THOSENIGHT TIME EYEWITNESSES. SO, WHATEVER IT IS – IF IT IS FROM OUTERSPACE, ISN’T IT DEMONSTRATING THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY INTENTIONOF HURTING PEOPLE?So far, yes, ma’am. It’s a lot to think about. It’s not a joke.
