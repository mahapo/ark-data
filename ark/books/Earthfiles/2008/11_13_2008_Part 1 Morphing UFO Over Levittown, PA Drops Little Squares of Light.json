When three oval-shaped lights appeared on the bottom ...sparkling little squares of light came down in a triangular patternand surrounded the privet bush and silver maple tree.” - Robert Gardner, PA MUFON Left: Digital image of curved cylinder, or boomerang aerial object, that morphedinto middle pink-colored disc. Right: The pink disc then flashed three oval, white lights onits bottom surface and “little squares of light” dropped like snow in the air around privet bushand silver maple tree, but never reached the ground, floating three feet above yard. Halfa dozen sightings April through July 2008, Levittown, Pennsylvania.Image and drawings by resident and eyewitness. About thirteen miles northeast of Philadelphia up the Delaware River is Levittown.Close to Levittown is the Oxford Valley Mall, marked with red star above. 2008 UFO reportshave ranged from an unidentified aerial object over the mall in January to a series of sightings over aLevittown apartment complex that involved the “snowfall” of little squares of light.November 13, 2008 Levittown, Pennsylvania - On July 13, 2008, I received a phone callfrom Robert Gardner, MUFON Field Investigator living in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Bobwanted to know if I knew a scientist who could analyze “glitter” that had fallen from apink-colored, aerial disc over an apartment complex in Levittown. Bob's had talked withan eyewitness who first left him with the impression that sparkling, physical material hadfallen onto a privet bush growing next to the female eyewitness's apartment. After I asked"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"questions in order to get physical material to a scientist who helps me with energydispersive spectroscopy and other laboratory tests, Bob learned that there was no physicalmaterial. But the eyewitness wanted to know what might have happened to the privet bushgrowing next to her apartment door. She was alarmed when she found a dead bird near theprivet bush the next day after the April 20, 2008, sighting. Later on, the femaleeyewitness's daughter would also see the aerial craft.By July 20th, a week after his first phone inquiry, Bob gave me a phone update about hisprogress in trying to understand the complexities of a case that involved half a dozenmorphing UFO appearances over the same apartment and yard between April and July2008 by a strange aerial craft that changed from a boomerang shape to a pink disc shapethat flashed three oval lights from its bottom surface, and eventually would disperse whatlooked like little squares of light.Robert Gardner working at his home as a MUFON FieldInvestigator in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Robert Gardner Summary of Field Noteson July 20, 20081) First Levittown Apartment Event: April 20, 2008, 3 AM EasternThe first sighting was on April 20, 2008, at 3 AM, after the eyewitness's dog woke her upbarking and she took the dog outside. That’s when she saw an object hovering in the sky.The word “cylinder” has been used to describe what the female eyewitness saw, but infact the mother’s own digital photograph shows a curving, banana-shaped aerial objectthat changed shape to a disc. On April 20th, the object did emit a cone of light, but nothingelse came out, no glittering material.WHAT WAS THE FIRST SHAPE SHE SAW?A cylinder (curved banana-shape or boomerang).Digital image taken on July 8, 2008, at 4:10 AM Eastern,by Levittown, Pennsylvania, apartment resident and eyewitness. THEN THE BOOMERANG CRAFT CHANGED SHAPE?Yes, it changes shape into a pink-colored disc. The object hovered in the sky, emitting thebeam and then she went inside because she was scared.DID SHE ESTIMATE HOW HIGH THE OBJECT WAS ABOVE HER?She said the altitude was “treetops” about one mile away."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Boomerang morphed into pink-colored disc.Sketch by Levittown, Pennsylvania,apartment resident and eyewitness. 2) Second Levittown Apartment Event: May 2008, 2 AM EasternThe strange aerial object was changing shape from circle/sphere to disc to banana-shapedcylinder. Eyewitness did not file a MUFON report - the May 2008 sighting came up indiscussion with her about other sightings. 3) Third Levittown Apartment Event: June 12, 2008, 1 AM EasternThis is the first event with the sparkly “flakes,” or “little squares of light,” coming downaround the privet bush near her apartment door and a silver maple tree about 65 feet awayin her apartment yard.Privet bush about 15 feet high grows next to eyewitness's apartment back door in Levittown,Pennsylvania, where “little squares of light” first fell on June 12, 2008, from a pink-coloredaerial disc and surrounded the privet bush and a silver maple tree about 65 feet away.Image © 2008 by Robert Gardner. The morphing aerial object was about 60 to 100 feet away from where she stood in herLevittown yard near privet bush. When three oval-shaped lights appeared on the bottom,sparkly material came from both sides of the disc. The sparkling little squares of light camedown in a triangular pattern and surrounded the privet bush and silver maple tree.WHAT WAS THE SHAPE OF THE MORPHING AERIAL CRAFT WHEN IT EMITTEDTHE SPARKLING ‘FLAKES’?Circular with three oval lights appearing on the bottom of the disc."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Artistic highlight of three oval lights that were actually on the bottom surface of thepink-colored disc. From two sides of pink disc after oval lights flashed on, the small squaresof sparkling light fell in a pyramid-shaped pattern for about twenty minutes on June 12, 2008,around 1 AM Eastern.

Sketch by Robert Gardner,MUFON, on July 18, 2008, not drawn to scale.WERE BEAMS EMITTING THE SPARKLY FLAKES?No, no beams, just the metallic-sparkling “ flakes” raining down.AS THE SPARKLES FELL, YOU SAID THEY FORMED A KIND OF TRIANGULARPATTERN DROPPING AROUND THE PRIVET AND SILVER MAPLE?Yes, the metallic-looking, sparkly, flakes came down in a pyramid-shaped pattern falling,but she didn't see any beams of light - just the sparkly pieces falling in a pattern shapedlike a pyramid."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Upper pink-colored disc with three oval lights, estimated by eyewitness to beabout 60 to 100 feet above her. The grey pencil lines in triangular pattern represent the manylittle squares of sparkling light (about 1-inch square) that fell in air around the privet bush andsilver maple 65 feet away on June 12, 2008, for an estimated twenty minutes.Sketch by Robert Gardner, MUFON, on July 18, 2008, not drawn to scale. DID THE MOTHER EYEWITNESS SAY THE SPARKLES HAD ANY COLOR?Yes, silver flakes that were glowing like – the analogy she used while we were sitting in herhouse – she has a wine cabinet with wine glasses in it and track lights inside. The light wasreflecting off the wine glasses, and she compared the wine glass reflections with what shesaw falling from the pink disc - as bright as the light reflecting off glasses in her cabinet.DID SHE ESTIMATE THE LENGTH AND SHAPE OF EACH OF THE FLAKES?They were sort of like small, silver-shining pieces of tinfoil in little squares. Little Squares of Light Never Touched GroundTHEY WERE SMALL SQUARES?Yes. They were glittering, but nothing physical fell on the ground.ON THAT JUNE 12TH NIGHT, DID SHE TRY TO TOUCH THE SPARKLINGFLAKES?No, she did not approach them. The sparkling things came down to about three feet off theground.THEN THE GLITTERY FLAKES STOPPED DESCENDING?Yes, and they were just hanging around floating in the air for about 20 minutes.BOTH TREES WERE SURROUNDED BY THE GLITTERING, SMALL, SQUAREFLAKES?Ye s .BUT NOTHING EVER REACHED THE GROUND.Correct. Little Squares of Light “Sucked Back Up” to DiscTHEN WHAT HAPPENED?All the glittering flakes got sucked back up to the aerial craft all at once. It all just wentback up to the pink disc, all suddenly at the same moment."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"DID THE EYEWITNESS NOTICE IF THE PINK AERIAL DISC CHANGED SHAPE ATTHAT POINT?Yes, it went back to the bluish-white curved cylinder or boomerang shape.DID THE CRAFT REMAIN STATIONARY IN THE AIR?At that point, she didn't watch any more, but went back inside because it was a weirdexperience for her.IS THE VERY NEXT EVENT THE JULY 8TH NIGHT IN WHICH SHE GOTPHOTOGRAPHS AS WELL?Ye s . 4) Fourth Levittown Apartment Event: July 8, 2008, 4:10 AM EasternThree Digital ImagesWHY WAS SHE UP ?The dog woke her again.SHE GOES OUT INTO HER BACK YARD AND WHAT IS THE FIRST THING SHESEES AND HEARS?Rob reads mother eyewitness comments: “I was out in the yard with my dog. It was 4:10AM Eastern on July 8, 2008 (Tuesday). I looked up in the sky and saw four lights on thecraft. Three looked like two eyes and a nose. Bright headlights were further away, but partof the aerial object. There was a pink-colored light in the front of the object. There was ablue fog that came out of the back of the object.”She said the aerial object was again changing shapes, almost “wiggling” into differentforms from a boomerang-shape to a disc that flashed the triangle of oval lights underneath.This time, the prominent colors she saw were red, green, blue and a pink-rose. I guess thepink-rose was the front light and the blue was the fog and green and red were on the craft.The photos I have from her, the lights look something like a triangle.WHEN SHE WAS WAKED UP BY HER DOG AT 4:10 AM ON JULY 8TH, DID SHEGRAB A DIGITAL CAMERA ON HER WAY OUT TO THE BACK YARD?Yes, and that’s how she photographed the three images I have. The glittery flakes did notcome out on the pictures, but the curved banana-shape of the object did.HOW MANY IMAGES DID SHE TAKE?I’ve got three and she did a drawing of one.AS THE BLUE FOG CAME OUT OF THE BOOMERANG-SHAPED CRAFT, WHATHAPPENED NEXT?Like she saw it before on June 12, 2008, the boomerang morphed to the disc and a trianglepattern of falling silver, glittering flakes came down around the privet bush and silvermaple. There was no beam of light. The flakes were raining down in the wide pyramidpattern similar to June 12, and were glowing for about 20 minutes around the bush andtree. Then all the glittery flakes were sucked back up to the aerial craft simultaneously.JUST LIKE THE JUNE 12TH INCIDENT?Ye s .DID THE EYEWITNESS SEE ANY GLITTERY FLAKE MATERIAL REMAIN IN THEPRIVET OR SILVER MAPLE?No. Nothing remained.I’VE ASKED BIOPHYSICIST LEVENGOOD TO ANALYZE THE SAMPLES YOUARE SENDING HIM BECAUSE THE PRIVET AND THE SILVER MAPLE HAVEBOTH BEEN EXPOSED ON JUNE 12 AND JULY 8 TO THE GLITTERY MATERIALAND HE WILL TRY TO DETERMINE IF THE PLANTS HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TOMICROWAVE RADIATION, PLASMAS OR ANY OTHER EVIDENCE OF HEATING?I did find another silver maple tree there 75 feet away from the affected silver maple tree."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"THAT’S CLOSE FOR A CONTROL SAMPLE, BUT IF THAT’S THE ONLY ONE YOUCAN FIND, LET'S SAMPLE IT AS A CONTROL.The woman said the glittery flakes just stayed in the area of the privet and silver maple 65feet from the privet. So, the other silver maple at the end of the property is about 75 feetsoutheast from the affected silver maple. So, the second silver maple should work as acontrol. 5) Fifth Levittown Apartment Event: July 10, 2008, 2 AM to 2:45 AM EasternTwo eyewitnesses this time - mother and her daughter. Mother called the daughter to alerther that the aerial craft was back in the sky and both watched from their separateresidences in the Levittown apartment complex.Daughter called Robert Gardner at 2:45 AM to say that the object was back and wasmoving around in the sky, but no sparkling flakes. She and her mother had watched theaerial object changing shape between 2 AM to 2:45 AM, changing from circular to theblue-white, boomerang-shaped cylinder that morphed into a disc and kept repeating shapechanges. Everything was the same as the previous four sightings, except no sparklingflakes. 6) Sixth Levittown Apartment Event: July 16, 2008, Between 1 AM to 4 AM Eastern18 images and 6 short videos on Kodak Easy Share cameraWhat showed up was more of a banana-shaped cylinder that appears longer than theboomerang craft in the July 8th images. This object was changing back and forth betweena disc and the banana-shaped cylinder. The mother took 18 images and 6 short videos withher Kodak Easy Share camera that can take both still images and short video. The aerialobject in the images and videos looked more round like a horseshoe crab without a tail.The mother was out in the parking lot in front of the town home apartments this time, notin her back yard where the privet and silver maple grow.” Continued in Part 2: Biophysical and biochemical changes in privet and maple leavesMore Information:I would appreciate hearing from other eyewitnesses of strange aerial light events in theUnited States and world.
