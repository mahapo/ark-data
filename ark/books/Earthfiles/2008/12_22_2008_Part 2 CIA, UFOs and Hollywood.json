Robbie's writing partner isMatthew Alford, Ph.D., who earned his degree in 2008, from the University of Bathfocused on Film and Propaganda. Matthew is now a lecturer in film at the University ofBristol's Department of Drama: Theater, Film and Television. His Ph.D. thesis was entitled,“A Propaganda Model for Hollywood? Representations of American Foreign Policy inContemporary Films.” Matthew is also author of a forthcoming book, Projecting Power:American Foreign Policy and the Hollywood Propaganda System.Interview:Matthew Alford, Ph.D., Lecturer in Film, Dept. of Drama:Theater, Film and Television, Univ. of Bristol, Bristol, in South West England.Matthew Alford, Ph.D., Lecturer in Film, Dept. of Drama: Theater, Film andTelevision, University of Bristol, Bristol, in South West England: “My work focuseson the relationship between Washington, D. C. and Hollywood and looks at what kind of"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"political content is in films produced from 1990 to the present day, plus some historicclassics, and what kind of content they have had politically. I found that all of the films Iresearched pretty much without exception presented American foreign policy in verybenign terms, presenting America as a good power and also as an entity that used forceappropriately. When America did use force, it was effective and lead to peace, democracyand security. So, that was my initial research looking at all these films about what kind ofcontent they had.Then I asked myself what would cause that? Why is Hollywood so de-radicalized in itsapproach to American foreign policy. Why is it basically very positive about Americanpower. I found a lot of things about American society and western society in general thatmeant these films would be de-radicalized. One of those is the influence of the Departmentof Defense, the CIA and other agencies.WHAT IS STRONGEST EVIDENCE YOU HAVE FOUND OF CIA INFLUENCETHROUGH HOLLYWOOD FILMS?The strongest evidence that the CIA influences Hollywood films is from its own recordsand its own admission. The CIA has been very clear that since 1996, it set up its ownofficial entertainment industry liaison, the CIA’s own office that contacts and maintainsrelationships with Hollywood producers. Whenever different films are made, filmmakersoften come to the CIA and ask for advice. That’s just clear. It’s even clear in a CIAwebsite search of CIA and Hollywood.The way the CIA presents that, though, is to say, ‘We’re just providing advice and nothingmore.’ For instance, on the film, Meet the Parents with Robert De Niro, the CIA can say,‘We showed them how a lie detector works for that particular scene in the film.’ That’s abenign example.But we can make a pretty good guess from history that the CIA’s relationship withHollywood that the CIA is making rather more serious alterations, changes and requests inmovies. For instance, we have a film like Animal Farm from the 1950s, which was backedby the CIA and provided with at least several hundred thousand dollars by the CIA anddistributed by the U. S. Information Agency (USIA), which is closely connected to theCIA. That film was anti-Communist propaganda. That comes from lots of research on theinternal record. That’s also the case with the original George Orwell 1984 film, again fromthe mid-1950s.Also, the original film of The Quiet American from 1958. Edward Lansdale, a famed CIAoperative whose life was a model for the CIA character in the film, contacted the film’sdirector by letter and asked for certain changes to be made, which were then done. In thefeature film version, because of Edward Lansdale’s intervention, his character is changedfrom being a manufacturer of plastic explosives, which he distributes in order to stoke up afascist force in Indochina, to being a manufacturer of plastic children's toys. Thiscompletely contradicted the anti-war intent of Graham Greene's original novel. That's whyGreene denounced the film as propaganda.Video cover for The Quiet American, based on Graham Greene'sbest-selling anti-war novel, and released in 1958.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “The Quiet American was the first filmadaptation of Graham Greene's best-selling novel of same title released in1958.The film was directed and the script was written by Joseph L.Mankiewicz, with uncredited input from CIA officer, Edward Lansdale. The"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Hollywood film was also dedicated to the U.S.-backed president of SouthVietnam who took office shortly after the novel's publication. Graham Greenewas furious that his novel's anti-war message was taken out of the Hollywoodmovie and he disavowed the Mankiewicz film as a ‘propaganda film forAmerica.’”February 6, 1908 - February 23, 1987.Edward Geary Lansdale was a USAF officer who servedin the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and the CIA.“Lansdale rose to the rank of Major General,was awarded the DistinguishedService Medal in 1963. In the 1990s interest in Lansdale was sparked, in part,by the inclusion of a character named ‘General Y’ in the 1991 Oliver StoneHollywood film, JFK. It was implied that Lansdale was General Y, whoallegedly directed the covert operations to assassinate President John F.Kennedy (JFK) on November 22, 1963. This theory was inspired by questionsraised about Lansdale's presence in Dealy Plaza by a former colleague, L.Fletcher Prouty, who claimed to have recognized Lansdale in a photographtaken that day by a Dallas Morning News photographer immediately after theassassination. The photo allegedly shows Lansdale walking away from ‘thethree tramps’ who were arrested by Dallas police.” ]More modern examples are detailed in our November 14, 2008, Guardian article. We canlook at a film like The Recruit, with Al Pacino. We can only guess at the pressures andalterations the CIA brought to bear on that film. There’s also The Good Shepherd from2006, the Robert De Niro film about CIA counterintelligence and James Jesus Angleton(head of CIA's Counterintelligence from 1954 to 1974).Also, the 2007 film Charlie Wilson’s War is about the U. S. efforts to supply the Afghanmujahideen with weaponry during the Soviet occupation in the 1980s. Retired CIA agentMilt Bearden was an adviser on that Hollywood production. [ Bearden was selected in1986 to take charge of the CIA covert action mission to support Afghan resistance.] Infact, Bearden was talking about going around the mountains of Afghanistan with actorRobert De Niro firing off guns and drinking tea. The 2003 book by George Crile implied alink between American supply of arms to Afghanistan and 9/11. But the Hollywood filmpainted a less incriminating, more patriotic picture. What exact changes were made in thisfilm under CIA influence? We don’t know. In fact, it’s extremely difficult to find out.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - A Mujahid is a Muslim involved in jihad, a war.The plural is Mujahideen, Arabic for struggle. The mujahideen weresignificantly financed, armed and allegedly trained by the American CentralIntelligence Agency (CIA) during the Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reaganadministrations. The Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) was theinter-agent used in the majority of these activities to disguise the sources ofsupport for the resistance. Under Reagan, U.S. support for the mujahideenevolved into an official U.S. foreign policy, known as the ReaganDoctrine,which included U.S. support for anti-Soviet resistance movements inAfghanistan, Angola, Nicaragua and elsewhere. Reagan praised mujahideen as‘freedom fighters,’ and three mainstream Western films portrayed themujahideen as heroic: the 1987 James Bond film, The Living Daylights; the1988 Rambo III; and the 2007 biographical movie, Charlie Wilson's War. ] FOIA Requests: NASA Letterand CIA in HollywoodI’ve put in FOIA requests to the CIA about their filmmaking liaison and also submitted to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"NASA about the Steven Spielberg alleged 20-page letter concerning Close Encountersback in 1977, which you discussed with Robbie recently.It’s been two or three months and we haven’t heard back from them. Supposedly, we wereto hear something within a month or so, but we're still waiting.THE RESPONSE DELAY INDICATES THE SUBJECTS YOU ARE INQUIRINGABOUT ARE HOT BUTTONS IN THE FOIA SYSTEM?Yes, that would be an inference we could make. It does seem suspicious that we haven’treceived any reply about these FOIA requests, particularly the really simple ones. I am sofrustrated that the CIA press department has not got back to me at all and I ended upwriting a one-line letter just saying, ‘Could you tell me how many people work in youroffice?’ I figured that’s the kind of question and answer they can’t actually say, ‘This istaking a long time to find the answer to your inquiry because there are so many documentsto go through.’All they have to do is count their staff and reply! But I haven’t had any answer to thatquestion either.So, whether that’s indication of conspiracy or simply that they are not interested inactually being genuine with the Freedom of Information process, I don’t know.YOU ARE TRYING TO GET A COPY OF THE NASA 20-PAGE LETTER TO STEVENSPIELBERG, CORRECT?That’s right. I’ve gotten an automated response from NASA, which said, ‘We’re lookinginto your inquiry.’ But nothing more has emerged. The delay could simply be abureaucratic thing. I certainly would not leap to any conclusions at this point that it’s asign that authorities are covering something up, but it’s certainly a frustration for me, theresearcher! At least it shows, I think, they are not that keen on spending a great deal oftime and resources on providing information that might show the CIA and NASA worlds ina bad light. That’s not surprising. It’s just the way powerful systems work. Beyond “The Lies Are Out There”BEYOND THE GUARDIAN’S NOVEMBER 14, 2008, PUBLICATION OF YOUR DEEPPOLITICS OF HOLLYWOOD: PART 1 - SPOOKS AND THE SILVER SCREEN, WHATARE YOUR OTHER PARTS 2 AND 3?The Guardian changed our ‘Spooks’ title to ‘An Offer They Couldn’t Refuse,’ a titleRobbie and I don’t completely understand.Then the next two parts under the overall title, ‘The Deep Politics of Hollywood’ are 2) the UFO focused one, ‘The Lies Are Out There;’ and 3) ‘In the Parents' Best Interests’about Hollywood as a system where the power is in the parent companies that ownHollywood studios. In the popular imagination, when we think of Hollywood, we think of20th Century Fox, Universal, MGM and so on. We think of those as being the studios thatcontrol the movie-making. But in this modern world, each of those studios has a corporateowner that is a multi-billion dollar corporation with a vast array of interests.So, what Robbie Graham and I asked ourselves: If the parent companies such as Viacom,Disney and so on have other business interests – maybe even selling military arms, forinstance – or if the corporations have close relationships with the government of the day,might self-interest skew the content of any given film in a studio owned by the parentcompany? In other words, content with an ideological take could be provided by thecorporate owners. Parent Corporations of Hollywood StudiosIt’s our theory so far because it’s even harder to get information in documents and memosfrom a corporation than it is from the CIA, which is at least nominally accountable.Corporations are not accountable to anyone except their shareholders. So, I think we aretrying to highlight where there have been Hollywood films that have had a great difficultybeing released.For instance, the film Medium Cool, which was directed by Haskell Wexler in 1969.Wexler had considerable trouble releasing the movie, which was about anti-war protests atthe Democratic convention in 1968. Wexler learned a few years later after FOIA wasavailable that on the eve of Medium Cool’s release, the Mayor of Chicago and other"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Democratic players contacted Gulf and Western - then the parent company of ParamountStudios - that if Medium Cool was released then certain tax benefits and other perks inGulf and Western’s favor would not happen.Medium Cool, directed by Haskell Wexler about anti-war protestersat the 1968 Democratic convention was temporarily blocked from 1969 ParamountStudio release by Paramount's parent company, Gulf and Western,pressured by Chicago political forces.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “Medium Cool was directed by Haskell Wexlerand released in 1969, one year after the 1968 riots at the Democratconvention in Chicago. In 2003, the film was selected for preservation in theUnited States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being‘culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.’ 1968 was a tumultuousyear in America and the Hollywood film reflects the conflicted nature of thecountry at the time.“The Tet Offensive was launched; Robert Kennedy was assassinated in LosAngeles in June and Martin Luther King was murdered in Memphis in April;race riots occurred in major cities all over the country. Wexler's film wascontroversial with distributors and received an X-rating, which delayed itsrelease. Wexler said, ‘They also objected to the language and the nudity,things which ultimately meant the film received an X-rating. What no one hadthe nerve to say was that it was a political ‘X.’ Obviously, the film struck anerve as it was truly a product of the times in which it was made - there is noseparating the political climate of the United States and the material in thefilm.’”]Lo and behold, surprise, surprise, Medium Cool was badly advertised by Paramount.Wexler was not allowed to take it to film festivals. He was ordered to get authorizationreleases from all of the protesters in the park, which was almost impossible to do!Medium Cool is a case from the 1960s, but in the more modern time there is anotherexample in Fahrenheit 911, which was made by Miramax, a subsidiary of the DisneyCorporation.Fahrenheit 9/11 political documentary written and directed"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"by American filmmaker Michael Moore and released in 2004 by Miramax,a subsidiary of Disney. Disney management tried to block the release of the non-fiction film.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Fahrenheit 9/11 is an award-winning 2004documentary film by American filmmaker Michael Moore. The film takes acritical look at the presidency of George W. Bush, the War on Terrorism, andits coverage in the American news media. The film holds the record forhighest box office receipts by a political film in general movie release. In thefilm, Moore contends that American corporate media were ‘cheerleaders’ forthe 2003 invasion of Iraq and did not provide an accurate and objectiveanalysis of the rationale for the war or the resulting casualties there. The film'sattack on the Bush administration generated much controversy around thetime of the film's release, including disputes over its accuracy. In response,Moore published an extensive list of facts and sources for the film on hiswebsite. The film debuted at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival in thedocumentary film category and was awarded the Palme d'Or (Golden Palm),the festival's highest award.]Disney weighed in right before it was released and said, ‘Look, Miramax, you’re notallowed to release this. We don’t like it.’ Miramax turned around and said, ‘Yes, we canrelease it. There is no reason why we should not release it.’ But Disney prevented forawhile the release from happening, even though eventually Fahrenheit 911 was finallydistributed to great public interest.So, our third part of articles is looking at the upper echelon controllers of the Hollywoodsystem, which are not normally under a great deal of scrutiny. Why Won't The GuardianPublish All Three Parts?IF THE GUARDIAN PUBLISHED YOUR PART 1 AS ‘AN OFFER THEY COULD NOTREFUSE’ ON NOVEMBER 14, WHY WOULDN’T THE GUARDIAN KEEP GOINGWITH PARTS 2 AND 3?(laughs) Well, I don’t know. That’s a very interesting question. To date, The Guardian hasnot seen Part 3 yet. It’s a slightly more theoretical piece. Do people in the public evenknow a company like Viacom run by Sumner Redstone. Those aren’t exactly householdnames and makes for a harder story to sell.We did try to place Part 2 with The Guardian that is about the UFOs and misinformationthrough Hollywood cinema in which Robbie and I took no sides on the extraterrestrialhypothesis. But The Guardian would not accept it and the editors thought it was way toospeculative. I don’t think that is the case. We were very objective in our writing.YOUR OWN MINISTRY OF DEFENCE RELEASED MORE UFO FILES IN 2008. SOWHY WOULD THE GUARDIAN TURN ITS NOSE UP AT PART 2, ‘THE LIES AREOUT THERE’?I think it’s a bad thing that Ufology is dismissed in quite a knee jerk reaction in themainstream media. I think that’s regrettable and an interesting area to explore. There arewhole pieces of evidence in the subject that most people are not aware of, but I think thepeople we were speaking to at The Guardian were not in very powerful positions andrejected it mainly because of their own attitudes toward Ufology.WHY DO YOU THINK IN GENERAL THAT YOU HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GETTHE THREE PARTS PUBLISHED TOGETHER IN THE U. K.?I just think there is a dominant ideology, a political correctness, that dismisses UFOs with achuckle. You know how anchormen in TV news are actually told to treat UFO stories witha tongue-in-cheek, light-hearted attitude. In that sense, there is a top down thing going on– there are directives from on high to discredit the subject. But I think that is partly due tothe market in which some people have an aversion to ideas that are new. So, it’s a businesspolicy to cater to that politically safe market. Again, that is highly regrettable. All subjectsshould be allowed to be explored.AND EXPLORED HONESTLY. HOW CAN THERE BE ANY HONEST JOURNALISMWHEN THE ABILITY TO INVESTIGATE THE UFO PHENOMENON IS KEPT FROMTHE PUBLIC AND THE MEDIA BY GOVERNMENT POLICIES OF DENIAL IN THEINTEREST OF NATIONAL SECURITY?That’s absolutely accurate and a pertinent question, as far as I’m concerned. There are"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"CIA and other agencies in the United States that try to have an influence on Hollywoodproducts. Perhaps the biggest story is about how CIA agents have infiltrated news media.We didn’t go down that road too much because it’s been covered by Carl Bernstein(Wa sh i n g t o n P o st Watergate reporter) and the Senator Frank Church hearings. [ Sen.Church gained national prominence during his service in the Senate through hischairmanship of the Church Committees, which conducted extensive hearingsinvestigating extra-legal FBI and CIA intelligence-gathering and covert operations in the1970s.] Bernstein and others have gone into a lot of detail and found an enormous extentof CIA influence – people actually placed on major newspapers and in management ofmainstream news media.In terms of Hollywood, there certainly is a significant impact from the CIA on many films.But I also think the Department of Defense has been able to make the biggest scriptchanges. They are the ones who have been able to impact the largest number of films fordecades, back through the 1940s.Other agencies such as NASA and the FBI also have had long-term relationships with bothtelevision and Hollywood movies. Even Homeland Security had a representative who triedto represent its operations in a good light since its formation after 9/11. There’s a storyabout Republican congresswoman, Marilyn Musgrave, who actually campaigned to get aHomeland Security entertainment liaison removed because the congresswoman wanted toget rid of undue influence on movie scripts. Thousands of dollars were spent to hirersomeone to secretly make Homeland Security look good in the cinema. CongreswomanMusgrave saw the entertainment liaison as a bad use of funds when a lot of bullet proofvests could be purchased for the money spent on the liaison.If you’ve got government agencies working in Hollywood covertly to improve their ownimages, that’s not only a bad use of funds, it’s also fundamentally anti-Democratic andwrong. Propaganda Versus HonestyAND BOILS DOWN TO PROPAGANDA.Yes, it is propaganda in its most direct form. If something is done secretly and deliberatelyfor a political end – particularly if designed to promote an institution – that is propaganda!But I wouldn’t like to say that the forces of dishonesty are winning against the forces ofhonesty.DO YOU THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY TODAY AT THE END OF 2008 THAT BOTH THEBRITISH GOVERNMENT AND AMERICAN GOVERNMENT ARE NOW SHOWINGTHAT PROPAGANDA DOMINATES POLICY MORE THAN TRYING TO REPORTFACTUALLY TO THE P UBLIC?I think powerful systems are always going to try to burnish their own image in whateverway they can. The truth really is irrelevant as far as government authorities are concernedbecause they want to maintain an image of success for their institutions and policies.In any nation there has to be power exercised by a relatively small number of people.That’s the contract we have with our governments. We lend authority to governmentshoping the small number of leaders will use that authority wisely for the people. But it’squite another thing if the public allows that authority to get too strong and self-servingabout burnishing its own image and using propaganda for the sake of its own power. That Ithink is really the crux of your question. There is a great difference between an authoritythat is legitimate versus power with power games, which are often not legitimate andshould be challenged.Having a more open government that does release files and does not use Hollywoodmovies to spread misinformation would be a much healthier and genuine democracy. But itseems to me that America is not a genuine democracy, not a full one anyway. It’s really aplutocracy run by corporations and a very powerful government with a lot of tax payermoney at its disposal and misuses that power very often quite seriously. But there is stillroom for optimism because Americans and the British do reject extremism.”[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - Plutocracy is rule by the wealthy, or powerprovided by wealth.
