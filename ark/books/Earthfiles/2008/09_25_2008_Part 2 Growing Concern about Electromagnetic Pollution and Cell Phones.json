They placed half of the semensamples 2.5 centimeters away from a 850 MHz frequency cell phone in talkmode for one hour. Most cell phones used in the U.S. are 850-900 MHz. Theychose this distance because it is the typical distance between the testes and thetrouser pockets.” eturn to Part 1 September 25, 2008 Washington, D. C. - On September 19, 2008, the published researchof Ashok Agarwal, Ph.D., Director of the Center for Reproductive Medicine at theCleveland Clinic in Ohio made national and international headlines. This was Dr. Agarwal'ssecond study of cell phone radiation on sperm and he reported: “On average, there was an85% increase in the amount of free radicals for all the subjects in the study. Free radicalshave been linked to decreased sperm quality in previous studies.” In another study, Dr.Agarwal found that 361 men who used their cell phones more than four hours a day hadsignificantly lower sperm quality than those who used their cell phones for less time.Joining a chorus of medical warnings about electromagnetic pollution and the dangers oftoo much cell phone use is Devra Davis, Ph.D. Since 2004, she has been the Director of theUniversity of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute's Center for Environmental Oncology and Prof. ofEpidemiology in the Graduate School of Public Health. Dr. Davis is also author of the 2007acclaimed book, The Secret History of the War On Cancer.In the 1990s, Dr. Davis was Director of the Board on Environmental Studies andToxicology at the National Academy of Sciences and was a Clinton Administrationappointee to the National Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board. Recently Italked with Dr. Davis about Dr. Ronald Herberman’s cell phone warning memo distributedin July 2008 to the Cancer Institute's faculty and staff.Interview: Devra Davis, Ph.D., Director,Center for Environmental Oncology,University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute,Pittsburgh, PennsylvaniaDevra Davis, Ph.D., Prof. of Epidemiology, Graduate School of Public Health,University of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; former Director of the Board onEnvironmental Studies and Toxicology, National Academy of Sciences; ClintonAdministration appointee to National Chemical Safety and Hazard InvestigationBoard; and author of the 2007 book, The Secret History of the War On Cancer: “Thefocus of our effort has been to advise our staff to take precautions so they can reduce theirdirect exposure to their brains.IT IS SOBERING TO READ YOUR WARNING MEMO OF PRECAUTIONS THAT YOUALL, WHO ARE EXPERTS IN THE FIELD OF ONCOLOGY, ARE PUTTING OUT TOYOUR OWN COLLEAGUES. [ See list at end of this report.]"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Yes. Yes. And let me say that Dr. Herberman and I never imagined that an internaladvisory memo to our staff would get this global attention that it has received. We weredoing this simply because we spent about 8 months reviewing the literature on a number ofenvironmental hazards, where we concluded there needed to be advice given to thescientific staff so people could take appropriate precautions. It’s important to realize thatthe cell phone industry itself has reported that the cell signal reaches through the brain ofchildren.And I’m very concerned about the current attempt to market cell phones to toddlers, toyoung children, as something they should wear around their neck. Living tissue isvulnerable to electromagnetic fields. (Within the frequency bands typically used by cellphones, which are 800 to 2200 megahertz.) There is some evidence of an increase in braintumors in studies done in countries like Sweden where cell phones have been used longenough to see an effect.Cell phone next to right ear is focusingmicrowaves on man's head. Image © 2006 by AP.Our concern is not just with cancer. We know the brains of children continue to developand mature in various ways throughout the teenage years. Dr. Leonard Hardell is adistinguished oncologist and epidemiologist in Sweden at University Hospital and he haspublished a series of important papers in which he found that when you look at people whohave used cell phones for ten years or more, they have a substantial increase – a doubledincrease or more of a tumor of the hearing nerve called an ‘acoustical neuroma.’ That isgenerally a benign tumor that can be surgically removed. And they also have an increase ina type of brain tumor – unfortunately, a glioma. That shows up particularly on the sameside of the head where people report using their cell phones.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “A glioma is a type of cancer that starts in thebrain or spine. It is called a glioma because it arises from glial cells. The mostcommon site of gliomas is the brain. Gliomas cannot be cured. The prognosisfor patients with high-grade gliomas is generally poor, and is especially so forolder patients. Of 10,000 Americans diagnosed each year with malignantgliomas, about half are alive 1 year after diagnosis, and 25% after two years.Those with anaplastic astrocytoma survive about three years. Glioblastomamultiform has a worse prognosis.]WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT THE PUBLIC IS CONSTANTLY BEING TOLD BYPEOPLE IN POLITICAL AUTHORITY THAT THERE IS NO RISK FROM CELLPHONES AND MICROWAVE TOWERS TO HUMAN HEALTH, YOU CANUNDERSTAND THE CONFUSION THAT THE PUBLIC HAS ABOUT WHETHERCELL PHONES AND MICROWAVE TOWERS ARE SAFE OR NOT.I do. And I think it is very important to take a step back and recognize something. Humanevidence should not be the requirement for action to prevent further human harm.If we say that we have to have proof that people are already sick or dead because oflong-term exposure to radio frequency signals, we are basically dooming our children and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"grandchildren, treating them like laboratory rats in an experiment where we don’t reallyhave controls. I think we need to make more reliance on experimental studies, whichscientists have done in culture dishes where we take cultures of cells from the brain –which has been done – cultures of breast and prostate cells and expose them toelectromagnetic radio frequencies in the lab under controlled conditions to these signalsand see what happens to the sampled cells.Those studies have been done and in 2007, an excellent analysis of that work was reportedin the Bioinitiative Report prepared and edited by Dr. David Carpenter, the former Dean ofthe University of Albany’s School of Public Health, along with Cindy Sage, who is anexpert in this field as well. That Bioinitiative Report was put together by 15 internationallyrenowned scientists. It reported on the negative and positive studies and concluded therewas sufficient evidence for concern and for precautionary actions to be taken.At this point, we are not calling for people to stop using cell phones. We are calling onthem to use cell phones more safely.Many professionals are literally tied to their cell phones at their hip. And we advise againstthat. We think it is important for peoples’ mental and physical health to actually turn yourcell phone off sometimes. Dinnertime, it’s a good idea. And at night. Some people wereactually sleeping with their cell phone under their pillow. That is not a good idea!DR. ASHOK AGARWAL'S RESEARCH REINFORCES WHAT YOU HAVE BEENTELLING ME?Absolutely. In fact, here is what we understand. Dr. Ashok Agarwal’s work is brilliant andvery important. We have to be concerned because there are growing numbers of youngpeople with cancer. There is clear evidence that we have more survivors of cancer becausewe have succeeded in treating cancers of childhood, but we’re seeing more cancer inyoung people under the age of 40 – more than a million cancer survivors today. One of themost common malignancies in young people is testicular cancer. It is well known thatanything that can cause deformities of the sperm might also cause testicular cancer.We’re flying blind in respect to a lot of these questions because we don’t have access todata from the cell phone industry. Because of national security, cell phone companies nowhave to turn over records to the government about cell phone use for anyone suspected ofbeing involved with issues endangering the United States. We think our security is at risk ifwe face hazards from cell phone use. We are calling on the cell phone industries in thetestimony that Dr. Herberman will issue on Friday, Sept. 26, in Washington, D. C., tocooperate with independent researchers at M. D. Anderson (Houston, Texas), the Univ. ofPittsburgh Cancer Institute, and the Univ. of California – San Francisco. We want billingrecords released so we can tie those to detailed information that we need about cell phoneuse patterns in order to do a prospective study.If there is a risk that appears to be evolving here of brain tumors, we now have thefollowing situation: more than 90% of people in most industrial countries are currentlyusing cell phones. Ten years ago, it was less than 30%, except in Scandinavia where wehave some studies that have been positive. So if we wait until we have human evidence,we’re going to be in big trouble. AN EPIDEMIC POSSIBLY OF BRAIN TUMORS AND PROBLEMS WITH SPERMINCREASING OVER THE NEXT TEN TO TWENTY YEARS.Yes. Frankly, this is a real dilemma for public health. We think there is enough cause forconcern right now that we advised taking precaution and we think that everybody shouldchange their use of cell phones now."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"- We think it is a good idea not to keep cell phones ‘ON’ on their body all thetime.- We think it’s a good idea if you use a cell phone, try to shorten the amount oftime you use it.- Do not have it directly at your head.- If at all possible, use a wired headpiece or for short periods of time, a bluetooth headset.

On July 11, 2008, the Cellular Telephone Industries Association(CTIA), petitioned the FCC to declare new limitations on local zoning authority as itaffects cell tower sites. A deadline for public comments was extended to the end ofSeptember 2008 by the FCC, so click here for Public Notice for Comments.Specifically, CTIA requests the Federal Communications Commission to:1. Force municipalities to act on wireless antenna or tower zoning applicationswithin 45 or 75 days.2. Rule that applications are automatically \"deemed granted\" if a localgovernment misses the FCC's deadline.3. Prevent municipalities from considering the presence of service by othercarriers in evaluating an additional carrier's application for an antenna site.4. Pre-empt any local ordinance that would automatically require a variancefor cell tower applications.What You Can Do:Send a letter to the FCC by September 29, 2008 requesting that they do not furtherpreempt local zoning, stating that since 1996 municipalities have spent many hours creatinglegitimate bylaws unique to those areas, reflecting the will of citizens where they live, workand create community. Tell the FCC that the CTIA’s requests do not reflect the will of thepeople; rather this is an attempt to expedite the process for telecommunication carriers toplace more antennas to service new wireless products – and undo the hard work of localboards and citizens.ail to:Federal Communications Commission445 12th St, S.W.Washington, DC 20554Send this Alert to your local Planning and Zoning Boards, Selectmen, City CouncilRepresentatives, with a copy of your letter, and urge them to request that the FCC, onbehalf of their local citizens, deny the CTIA’s requests."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Legal Actions Taken To Date:On August 22, Montgomery County, Maryland, and NATOA et al. filed motions to extendthese deadlines.

While communicating using your cell phone, try to keep the cell phoneaway from the body as much as possible. The amplitude of the electromagneticfield is one fourth the strength at a distance of two inches and fifty times lowerat three feet.3. Whenever possible, use the speaker-phone mode or a wireless Bluetoothheadset, which has less than 1/100th of the electromagnetic emission of anormal cell phone. Use of a hands-free ear piece attachment may also reduceexposures.4. Avoid using your cell phone in places, like a bus, where you can passivelyexpose others to your phone’s electromagnetic fields.5. Avoid carrying your cell phone on your body at all times. Do not keep itnear your body at night such as under the pillow or on a bedside table,particularly if pregnant. You can also put it on ‘flight’ or ‘off-line’ mode, whichstops electromagnetic emissions.6. If you must carry your cell phone on you, make sure that the keypad ispositioned toward your body and the back is positioned toward the outside sothat the transmitted electromagnetic fields move away from your rather thanthrough you.7. Only use your cell phone to establish contact or for conversations lasting afew minutes as the biological effects are directly related to the duration ofexposure. For longer conversations, use a land line with a corded phone, not acordless phone, which uses electromagnetic emitting technology similar to thatof cell phones.8. Switch sides regularly while communicating on your cell phone to spreadout your exposure. Before putting your cell phone to the ear, wait until yourcorrespondent has picked up. This limits the power of the electromagnetic fieldemitted near your ear and the duration of your exposure.9. Avoid using your cell phone when the signal is weak or when moving at highspeed, such as in a car or train, as this automatically increases power to amaximum as the phone repeatedly attempts to connect to a new relay antenna.10. When possible, communicate via text messaging rather than making a call,limiting the duration of exposure and the proximity to the body."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"11.
