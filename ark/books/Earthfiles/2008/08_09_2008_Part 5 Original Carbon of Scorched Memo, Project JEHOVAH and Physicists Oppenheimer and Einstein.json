Robert Julius Oppenheimer is best known for his role as scientific director of theManhattan Project, America's TOP SECRET government project to develop the firstnuclear weapons in the early 1940s in Los Alamos, New Mexico, a facility that came to beknown as Los Alamos National Laboratory.In reference to the Trinity test in New Mexico, where his Los Alamos team first tested theatomic bomb, Oppenheimer famously recalled the Bhagavad Gita: “If the radiance of athousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of themighty one. ... Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.”After WWII, Oppenheimer was a chief advisor to the newly created United States AtomicEnergy Commission (AEC) and used that position to lobby for international control ofatomic energy and to avert the nuclear arms race with the Soviet Union. As a physicist,Oppenheimer is remembered most for being the chief founder of the American School ofTheoretical Physics at the University of California - Berkeley. Later, at the Institute forAdvanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, he would hold Einstein's old position of SeniorProfessor of Theoretical Physics. Oppenheimer's notable achievements in physics includethe Born-Oppenheimer approximation, work on electron-positron theory, theOppenheimer-Phillips process, quantum tunneling, relativistic quantum mechanics,quantum field theory, black holes, and cosmic rays.

Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physicsfor the discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect. Albert Einstein was one of the many concerned scientists during WWII who recognizedthe danger of German scientists developing an atomic bomb based on the newly-discoveredphenomena of nuclear fission. In 1939, the Hungarian émigré Leó Szilárd, having failed toarouse U.S. government interest on his own, worked with Einstein to write a letter to U.S.President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, which Einstein signed, urging U.S. development ofsuch a weapon. In August 1939, Roosevelt received the Einstein-Szilárd letter andauthorized secret research into the harnessing of nuclear fission for military purposes.By 1942, this effort had become the Manhattan Project directed by Robert Oppenheimer.Einstein himself did not play a role in the development of the atomic bomb, other thansigning the 1939 letter to FDR. According to Linus Pauling, Einstein later expressed regretabout his letter to Roosevelt. In 1947, Einstein wrote an article for The Atlantic Monthlyarguing that the United States should not try to pursue an atomic monopoly, but insteadshould equip the United Nations with nuclear weapons for the sole purpose of maintainingdeterrence.

He was involved withsubmarine detection research for the U. S. Navy early in hiscareer. In 1930, Bush and his group at MIT had developed thefirst machine to solve differential equations. By WWII and thrughthe 1940s, Vannevar Bush was a scientific adviser to PresidentHarry S. Truman, was Chairman of the National DefenseResources Commission (NDRC) and had the MJ-2 position in theMajestic-12 Special Studies Group appointed by PresidentTruman.

Robert Oppenheimer and Prof. Albert Einstein"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" MajesticDocuments.Com CommentsOn June 1947 Oppenheimer-Einstein Draft"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"June 5, 1996, note written by Salina to Timothy Cooper: “At my father's request (‘Cantwell’),I'm sending these private papers. Like my father, I worked in the Intelligence Community.I'm a retired CIA employee with thirty years in CI (counter-intelligence) under Jim Angleton.There are clues to be found in these documents. I can say no more. Good luck. Salina.” MajesticDocuments.com reports that the source of this Oppenheimer-Einstein draftdocument is Salina, June 1996. Salina is thought to be the daughter of CIA counter-intelligence operative under James Jesus Angleton dubbed “Cantwell,” who has leakedmany documents to Timothy Cooper, including the burned memo. See Earthfiles Parts1-4.MajesticDocuments.com: “This is probably a copy of a carbon copy of adraft prepared by a secretary from dictation, and the secretary did not knowhow to spell this word. Generally, forensic examiners find that errors presentin documents tend to indicate authenticity instead of lack of authenticity.Fakers usually try to make sure they're perfect. This is a six-page document,single-spaced, pica type. It has an elite type note with initials of VannevarBush at the end. This is the first document to use the phrase, ‘ExtraterrestrialBiological Entities, or EBEs.’“This Oppenheimer-Einstein Draft says the presence of unidentified spacecraftis accepted as de facto by the military, and the date is June 1947 - before thealleged crashs of discs or wedge-shaped aerial vehicles in New Mexico. Itdeals with the subjects that you'd expect competent scientists to deal with; i.e.,where do the non-humans come from, what does the law say about it, whatshould we do, and why are they here? Those are the subjects of this June 1947six-page document.“On the first page of the six-page document, note the TOP SECRETclassification. As you can see, there are not many extra marks on thedocument. The last page shows no signatures, but it does show VannevarBush's initials after the note that essentially says, ‘I don't think that we shouldlet Einstein talk to the President,’ and MJ-9 Gordon Gray agrees.“While the language usage does not reflect the refined writing ofOppenheimer, it is easy to imagine that Einstein, dictating with an accent,might have produced these words. The principal factors favoring authenticityof the Oppenheiimer-Einstein Draft are:- Literary analysis compares favorably with other Albert Einsteinpieces during 1940s such as the use of Latin, German and Jewishwords."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"- Period manual typewriter.- Authentic Vannevar Bush handwritten initials ‘VB’ on last page.- Einstein officially retired from the Institute of Advanced Studiesin 1945, but continued to live and work in Princeton, New Jersey,when the draft was written in 1947.“Further, the document suggests that in the event that EBEs desire to settlehere on Earth, there will be ‘profound change in traditional concepts’ of lawand the possible need for a new ‘Law Among Planetary Peoples.’ There arealso propositions concerning the necessary creation of a ‘Cosmic Internationallaw’ that would protect the rights of all celestial states to lay claim onotherwise unclaimed solar territories. Finally, the document addresses thepresence of celestial astroplanes in our atmosphere as possibly a result ofEarth military experiments with nuclear fission and fusion warfare devices.Oppenheimer and Einstein encourage consideration of our potential Earthfuture situation and safety due to our present and past actions in space.
