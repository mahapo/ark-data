Iused my Olympus E-500 camera with 40-150mm lens. It was around 8 PMCentral and I stopped in a parking lot to take the pictures out of the window ofmy car. If somebody can offer an explanation for these pictures, I will begrateful.Thank you.Ovi.” I emailed back:“Fascinating images. Can you give me more details about the exact location;i.e., central downtown Irving? Intersection? What are the buildings there? Howfar from the friends you were traveling to visit? How high was the movingobject above you and how far distant from you in feet? How many inches long,wide, and deep do you estimate the object was? Any sound from the object?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"About how many miles per hour was it traveling in comparison to surroundingtraffic?Also can you please give me some background about your age, where yougrew up, any academic degrees, general category of your profession, where doyou work and live now?With your written permission and without using your name, specific locationor email address, I would like to share more details and your images in anEarthfiles report and ask for any other eyewitnesses to contact me.” Subject: Re: Questions from Linda Moulton Howe, Earthfiles, Dec. 1, 2008Date: December 1, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“Hi, Linda,Thank you for responding to my e-mail.I will try to provide the answers in the order you asked me.Location: the intersection of W. Irving Blvd. and W. Pioneer Dr.; I do notknow what those buildings are since it was my first time visiting my friends. Iwas using a TomTom 730 GO GPS navigation system going from Plano toIrving, TX.I apologize for the measurement units used, but I am better with the metricsystem.- Distance to my friends: 26.8 miles (27min.) according to google maps.- Height of the object: approx. 200 - 300 meters ( 600 to 900 feet altitude)- Distance to the object: 1.5 - 2.5 kilometers ( .9 to 1.5 miles)- Object size: (estimated) 25 - 30 meters length (98 feet long), 7 - 8 metersheight and width (26 feet high and wide).- Zeppelin or cigar-shaped and glowing with greenish (turquoise) light.- There was no specific sound at all. The highway was between me and theobject and the traffic was pretty noisy.- Speed: approx. 10 - 20mph, or slower.- Time of the observation: around 19:03h (8:03 PM, the time embedded in theJPEG image shows 20:03h due to the fact that it was still set on Eastern Time -our previous home location).And now, a little bit about my background: I was born in 1970 in Romania,EU. I moved to US when I was 31. I have studied at Bucharest University andgraduated with a BA in Theology - Social Assistance in 1998, and a BA inPhysical Education from The Bucharest Sports Academy in 1994. I have beenwith the U.S. Navy from 2003 to 2008. In May 2007 I graduated \"Summa CumLaude\" from Oklahoma University's Human Relations Master's program -MHR. Now I am working with a local real estate company.Presently I reside in Texas along with my spouse and my two young children.The only other eyewitness was my wife who was traveling with me in the frontpassenger seat. She helped me with the camera since I had to change the lensto take better night pictures, switching from my usual 14 - 45mm to 40 -150mm.Along with this e-mail I have attached a Google maps satellite image of theintersection where the event took place with additional graphic details. I hopethis will offer you a better visual perspective. I will allow Earthfiles.com to usethe information provided above without mentioning my name, address ore-mail address. You may use my nickname, Ovi, if you would like.”9 of 20 Images by Ovi of StrangeMoving Aerial ObjectOlympus E-500 camera with 40-150mm lens"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The above nine images are in timeline order, but selected from a total of twentyimages by eyewitness and photographer, Ovi, in Irving, Texas, around 8 PMCentral, on Thanksgiving night, November 27, 2008.Olympus E-500 camera with 40-150mm lens."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Earthfiles cropped and enlarged this last image from Photo # 9 to showmore detail on strange aerial craft.
