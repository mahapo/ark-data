It might be ASCII, since its first few digits(reading left to right, standing near the cross) look like 00100000, which was a‘word spacer’ in the Crabwood message: [ See 081902 Earthfiles about alienface in Winchester wheat and 081902EarthfilesUpdate about code analysis.]01 (start)01000010S (B)01100101S (e)01110111S (w)01100001S (a)01110010S (r)01100101S (e)00100000S (space) ” Charles R. Mallett, Silent Circle,Compton Bassett, Wiltshire CommentsAlso see: Cropcircleconnector.comCharles R. Mallett excerpt of comments at Cropcircleconnector.com: “The ‘bar-code’' is a strip of irregular seeding of the maize plants. No cropsare laid in this area of the field.On the ground the cross is extremely messy. All the laid plants are smashedand dead on the ground, including the ‘construction lines’ that run under thepattern throughout.”"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Diagram © 2008 by Tommy Borms.
