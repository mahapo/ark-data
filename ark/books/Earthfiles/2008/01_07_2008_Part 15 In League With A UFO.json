Out of print.Return to Part 1January 7, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - *****Chapter 10Back from UtopiaBill Smith returned from his two-month hiatus and found the committeeswamped with material they received from Tim. The scientists were so busywith Tim's revelations that they had forgotten Bill was gone. He was notoffended. Bill was aware of all that was happening with Tim and thecommittee while he was away. Bill gave the scientists time to assimilate all theinformation that Tim had for them before Bill divulged all that he had learnedduring his time way. Bill told the committee that he would take thirty days offand spend them with his family. His two children were in college, so he spenta weekend with them. The rest of the time, he and his wife took a cruise to asecluded island.Bill Smith never divulged exactly what he did at work to his wife. Curiously,she never pried or attempted to find out what his work involved. She was apetite, shy woman. She kept to herself most of the time and was the exact"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"opposite of Bill, who was outgoing and loved to talk.After his encounters with the Aliens, Bill was no longer as extroverted as heonce was. He became quieter in the later years that he was with the programand only spoke when he had something to convey to the committee members.There was no more idle chat from him, which his colleagues missed becauseBill was the one with all the good jokes. He was also good at telling some talltales. That's why his colleagues did not believe him when Bill first disclosedthat he had made Alien contact.Even though Bill was a “kidder,” his friends and colleagues had a deeprespect for him. His knowledge and ability to grasp and understand conceptsimpressed everyone he met.He was talkative most of his adult life and only changed after his first fewcontacts with the Aliens. His personality changed drastically after that and hisknowledge seemed to quadruple every day. His colleagues called him“Spock,” a character in the Star Trek TV series. Unlike Spock, Bill Smithshowed compassion for all those around him while maintaining a “strictlybusiness” mentality.Bill's wife told him that when he was away those two months, she did not misshim at all. She was not being insensitive to him. She told Bill she could feel hispresence the whole time he was gone. Bill did not tell her that she was withhim the whole time. An Alien that took on his wife's looks and personality wasleft behind in her place.Bill had asked the Aliens if he could take his wife with him. The Aliens hadone condition: that she would not be allowed to remember and that Bill couldnot tell her that they went on a journey together to another planet. Bill agreed,although he would have preferred that this trip be the vacation of a lifetimefor the two of them. But it was more important for him that he had his wifewith him and was glad that he did not have to leave her at home for twomonths alone.While they were on the Earth island vacation after the long journey to anotherplanet, Bill's wife told him about a strange dream she had while he was away.She told him that they were in a strange place, just the two of them. The kidswere not with them. It was like another planet. She knew that because it hadmore than one sun. There were three suns all different sizes. One was a littlebigger than Earth's sun. The other two suns were much smaller, but brighter,than Earth's full moon. That planet had several moons, all different colors.Unlike our Earth moon, the inhabitants of that other planet could travel to allits moons, as she and Bill did.“The moons had cities on them, cities that can only exist in dreams becausethey were too beautiful to be real,” she told Bill. “The cities were so cleanthat they sparkled like diamonds.” The dream was so real that she actuallyremembered how the food tasted. Again, the food was so incredible that it hadto be a dream. She wished that she could share that dream with him. It was sohard to describe how wonderful it made her feel. If she didn't know better, shewould have thought it really happened!Bill was surprised at how much she was allowed to remember “in a dream.”He thought the Aliens were going to mask what had taken place. Bill waspleased that his wife had the gift of a fantasy vacation after all!Bill wished that he could tell her about the remaining 80% of things the twohad seen and experienced. Some of it was so fantastic that both Bill and hiswife had to be sedated to keep their senses from exploding. The couple alsohad to wear a special suit and put on headgear equipped with a sun visor,similar to those used on Earth ski slopes. The temperature of that Alien planetwas hotter than that of Earth and at least twice as bright. There was no night.It never got dark. Clouds did not exist there either. The variety of trees andplants, not to mention the colors and diversity of flowers, would have sent anearthly botanist into a frenzy.Bill was forbidden to reveal these experiences to anyone except thecommittee. The Aliens were not afraid that Bill would leak out damaginginformation about them to the general public or his wife. The Aliens were onlyconcerned that Bill would look foolish to his wife and friends if he revealedeven a small fraction of what he knew. Bill had enough discipline to keephimself from telling anyone in the community or the general public. But ittook extraordinary discipline to keep some secrets from his family and closest"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"friends.The most difficult time for Bill came when the Aliens took his own daughterand she woke up with her nose bleeding. Bill knew what happened to her andwhat she had been through, but he had to pretend and make up some storyabout what might have caused it. When Bill was young, his parents told himnose bleeds were something that happened to children. So that's what Billended up telling his daughter.She was twelve when Bill came to know the Aliens personally. He waspresent one time when the Aliens abducted his daughter. After that, Bill askednot to be present at any more of her abductions. It was difficult enough forhim to watch someone else's child crying during some of the procedures whilehaving no way to console them. It was completely unbearable to watch hisown child, especially when she looked up at him and cried, “Help me,Daddy!” Yet, Bill could do nothing but observe. He understood some of thethings that took place and why. The things he did not understand were themost painful. If Bill woke up one day and discovered that the Aliens weredoing evil things to him and his family, it would not matter. There is no wayhe could turn them off. The whole of the United States military, or of thewhole planet, could do nothing to stop the Aliens.Bill Smith was glad that down deep inside, he believed the Aliens to be goodand so he worked willingly with them. But Bill did have a twinge of suspicionin the back of his mind. He never felt like he was a slave to the Aliens, butbecause they were able to implant any reality into his mind, he was nevercompletely sure of their true intentions.The Aliens understood his suspicions and told him that his ability to besuspicious of them was proof that the Aliens do not have control over him. Ifthe Aliens did, they could easily mask over any doubts in his mind. Instead,since the Aliens have the upper hand anyway, they are able to work withhumans without resorting to glossing over all feelings of mistrust humanshave. The Aliens could turn all humans into zombies if they wanted to, butthat's not their mission.Few humans are able to work with the Aliens in the capacity that Bill and Timdo. The Aliens go through an extensive process of elimination before they finda human they can reveal themselves to.Bill met others like himself while visiting the other planet. Not all of themwere from Earth. Those who were not from Earth still had the same body andfacial features as Earth humans. In fact, they were all from the same genepool as Bill was. Bill only met with seven who were from other planets. Theyrepresented two planets that were exact duplicates of Earth. There are billionsof planets that are similar to Earth. There are billions of planets that aresignificantly different from Earth. Since the planets that are different had nobearing for Bill Smith and the others, those non-Earths were not discussed.But the Aliens told Bill that non-Earths was something he might learn moreabout in the future. Ancient LanguageIt was the strangest feeling for Bill and the others on the other planet when anAlien triggered a universal language in them. It was the first demonstration theAliens did. It took place while he was with the first group, “the group ofseven” as he called them. The first meeting was held in a magnificentcourtyard somewhere in the main city. An Alien spoke a single word to them.That word was an access code that triggered something inside their humanbrains.Once the Alien spoke the code word, a small area of the brain that waspreviously dormant in all seven people became activated. At that instant, thegroup all began to talk to each other in the same language.In a second group of twelve, Bill Smith was surprised to find a dozen otherslike him from planet Earth. Although he and the committee had theorizedearlier in the program that there had to be other countries on Earth which hadan Alien spacecraft, the committee had no evidence of it, nor did they eversuspect there could be a dozen or more!Bill Smith was one of two from the group of earthlings who spoke English."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The Aliens triggered that same language “ module” in them. One of thehumans present asked the Aliens if each of the twelve could access thatactivated language part of the human brain on their own. The Aliens told themthe humans could not. It was not a language that was currently being spokenon Earth, although it was used on Earth thousands of years ago.The intention of that visit was to broaden their human awareness and to learna little more about what is involved in being a human in this Milky Waygalaxy. And “little” was correct. The humans all left that place with morequestions and fewer answers.Bill expressed his feeling to the Aliens that “much was shown to the humangroup, but little was given for them to understand.” The Aliens responded thatnot only do many levels of Aliens exist, but so do many levels of humans.“The understanding that any one human will have depends on what level heor she is at.” That alone determines what each can comprehend and keep forthemselves when each leaves the other planet.On Earth, there are seven levels. On other planets, the range can vary fromone to fifty-two levels. The level that a person is on is not determined byintelligence alone, but comes mainly from something much deeper inside thesoul. It is something not easily obtained. It was not for the Aliens to elaborateabout what that was - except something that had to be determined by eachindividual.Only two out of the twelve humans at that meeting were at level seven. Therest had achieved the rank of level five or six. Who was at what level was notdisclosed. None of them could know at what level each was. Humans wouldonly know their level after they died. That was all that the Aliens were able totell Bill and the others. Once the people returned to Earth, it was unlikely thatBill would see or meet any of the other eleven again. Aliens recruited humansto do work for them throughout history. Bill and the others are only thenewest members of that fraternity.One of the things revealed to Bill at the meeting was that not all Aliens are ofthe good kind. Some are evil and spend their time interfering with the humanrace. Bill was told that the craft he and the committee had in their possessionwas not damaged in an accident. In reality, it had been attacked by one of theships belonging to renegade Aliens.The shipwreck could have been cleaned up with all signs of its existence keptsecret by the Aliens, but they were directed by others in a higher level of thematrix “to let it stay.” The Aliens allowed the craft to come into the hands ofcertain chosen people, the committee, who the Aliens knew were going to bebrought into their fold anyway. It also served to give the renegades a smallvictory, since they were determined to give the world a sampling of the “Alienterror that loomed before all mankind.”The Aliens let Bill Smith know that the renegades are only a minor irritation tothem and that the renegades are responsible for many of the sightings reportedby the general public.The Aliens are not here to make contact. The Aliens were here before humanswere conceived and the Aliens will be here when time for humanity hasexpired. The renegades have taken people and have done harm to the humancondition. The renegades don't always succeed with their plans, but havemanaged to plant their evil seed in every corner of the world!***** Continued in Part 16 - Interview with author Lou Baldin.More Information:For further reports about extraterrestrial biological entities and technologies, please seemy books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities in theEarthfiles Shop.
