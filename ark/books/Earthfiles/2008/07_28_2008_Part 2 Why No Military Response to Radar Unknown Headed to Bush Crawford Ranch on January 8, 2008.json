Further, that unknown aerial object was moving in a straight line between6:51 PM and 8 PM towards the George W. Bush ranch in Crawford, Texas. Yet, Glen andRobert could not find any radar signals of jet activity responding to that unknownapproaching the property of the American President. But in the 2.5 million returns of the FAA radar data Glen Schulze received from hisFreedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests, there is radar evidence that at least ten jetswere flying up to 8 PM on January 8, 2008, in unusual sorties that took some of those jetsover the Stephenville region. Glen's FOIA request was for FAA radar tower data between 4PM and 8 PM, so he and Robert do not have radar information after 8 PM.An “Unknown Aircraft” without transponder beacon, but reflecting nearly200 skin-paint returns, moved in a straight line from Dublin toward the Bush Crawfordranch between 6:51 PM and 8 PM, on January 8, 2008. The unknown object disappeared fromradar between 7:03 PM and 7:10 PM. Then at 7:32 PM, the unknown object acceleratedrapidly in 30 seconds to 532 mph and then ten seconds later, it decelerated to 49 mph.Graph © 2008 by Glen Schulze and Robert Powell.

I can’t say that it is, or is not, related to the first radar sighting wereceived at 6:15 PM when Steve Allen (and his friends) saw something.DO YOU HAVE SPEEDS OVER THAT HOUR OF THE UNKNOWN OBJECT?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Yes. The average speed is around 44 mph to 49 mph. That’s very slow. Radar was clockingit in every 10-second radar sweeps and there is one time when the object is at 532 mphand 10 seconds later, it’s at 49 mph. In 10-second radar sweeps (instead of 4.7) you losesome accuracy, but if an object is making any sudden movements, that’s the only way youcan catch it.The only one that might be able to do that in a 10-second time frame – and I just don’tknow if it can – I know it can travel that fast and it can slow down to that speed would beeither a Harrier-type-jet or, I believe, the new F-35s have Harrier jet-type capabilities. So,it’s possible those aircraft might be able to. The problem would be to maintain a slowspeed for over an hour – I would think they would run out of fuel, but I’m not an expert onthose type of aircraft.The Harrier II “Jump Jet” is the second generation of vertical/short takeoffand landing (V/STOL) jet aircraft of the late 20th century. They were developed fromthe earlier Hawker-Siddeley Harriers, are primarily used for light attack or multi-role tasks,and are almost all operated from small aircraft carriers. The Harrier is now built byMcDonnell Douglas. The Harrier in this picture is hovering just a few feet over the ground;the heat from the jet exhaust distorts the ground below.

YET,EVERYONE SAID WHAT THEY SAW WAS COMPLETELY SILENT.Right. And for this particular object we tracked for an hour, we only have one witness, the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"lady near Alexander, and she heard nothing from the object.We tried not to draw any conclusions about why the unknown would be there since thereis no way for us to know what it was or why it was there. Our main thought was: If thereis an object moving in that direction, what would be the reaction of military aircraft to theintrusion? Of course, we looked at the radar data and we did not see any reaction from themilitary to the unknown radar object. So, that was probably the most surprising part to us.Whether this unknown object was a military aircraft, civilian aircraft, or whatever it was, itjust seems strange that the military did not react to it. So that either indicates that themilitary already knows what it is and they are not concerned. Or the military has not seenthe unknown object on the F-16s’ radar (allegedly on training exercises that night).SO YOU HAVE ESTABLISHED AT LEAST ONE UNKNOWN AERIAL OBJECT WASNEAR THE CRAWFORD BUSH RANCH. HE IS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITEDSTATES. THIS IS A TIME OF WAR IN WHICH NATIONAL SECURITY FROM ANYKIND OF TERRORIST ATTACK IS THE HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR THISADMINISTRATION.SO, HOW COULD THERE BE UNKNOWNS FLYING AROUND IN THE AIR FROM6:15 PM TO 8 PM WHEN YOUR DATA ENDS, WITHOUT MILITARY RESPONSE,ESPECIALLY AT THE CRAWFORD BUSH COMPOUND?That’s a very good question – one for which I don’t have an answer.” Glen Schulze: “I was surprised the straight line led right to Crawford! Over the one hourperiod that target was tracked, Robert calculated several different velocities and hecalculated an average velocity of 49 miles per hour over that period. But in betweensweeps, during that hour period, there were instances where the velocity clearly sometimeswent to zero! This target sometimes hovered for ten or twenty seconds and then suddenly,it would move off again – but always in a straight line.Why was this target without a beacon? We know it was something physical there whenyou get almost 200 hits in an hour, all in a straight line. You know there is something there.The question is: why was it not checked out (by military)?” Aviation map of restricted air space inside white circle around President George W.

Major Karl Lewis, NAS JRB Fort Worth,Changes Story, Confirms F-16s Over StephenvilleOn January 8, 2008 Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth or NAS JRB Fort Worth,also known as Carswell Field, is now home to the U. S. Navy Reserve, U. S. Marine Corps Reserve,U. S. Air Force Reserve, and U. S. Air National Guard. The Carswell military complex is a militaryairfield located five miles (8 km) west of the central business district of Fort Worth, in Tarrant County, Texas,United States. This military airfield is operated by the United States Navy. The Air Force Reserve Command'sTenth Air Force headquarters and 301st Fighter Wing continue to be based at the installation, as well as the136th Airlift Wing of the Texas Air National Guard. A number of Marine Corps aviation and ground units arealso co-located at NAS JRB Fort Worth. Currently based Air Force aircraft arethe F-16 Fighting Falcon and C-130 Hercules. Currently based Marine Corps aircraftare the F/A-18 Hornet and KC-130 Hercules. Se e: NAS JRB Fort Worth.Nine days after the first denial of jets over Stephenville, on Wednesday, January 23,2008, there was another news release from Major Karl Lewis, a spokesman for the 301stFighter Wing at the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth (NAS JRB FortWorth), also known as Carswell Field. The Dallas Morning News reported that Major KarlLewis had issued a revision to his earlier statement and confirmed there were ten F-16sflying in the Stephenville region the night of January 8, 2008. National Public Radiofeatured the revised military release at its website and in a January 24, 2008, newsbroadcast: “Air Force Alters Texas UFO Explanation.”Glen Schulze was also able to confirm radar signals for ten jets in his January 8, 2008, FAAradar data, but what puzzles him are the peculiar sortie patterns the data implies."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"January 24, 2008, National Public Radio news story. Source : NPR we bsite . Confirmed Jet Sorties Between 6 PM and 8 PM,January 8, 2008Glen Schulze and Robert Powell report that within a minute or two, the jet sorties in theirFAA radar data departed Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth Carswell at:First sortie: 6:00 PM CSTSecond sortie : 6:15 PM CSTThird sortie: 6:29 pm CSTGlen found that “ the trailing F-16 wing men took off about 30 seconds behind the leaderand each other for separation safety.” Glen and Robert explained that the first sortie leftCarswell AFB at about 6 PM and the second sortie at about 6:15 PM, accurate to withinone to two minutes because “we can first see the jets once they reach an altitude of a fewhundred feet, but not prior to that. The third sortie of two jets headed to Oklahoma andfirst showed up at 6:29 PM on radar and returned shortly after 8 PM.”Glen Schulze, Semi-Retired Electrical Engineer and Radar Specialist, Littleton,Colorado: “The first four jets took off from Carswell AFB at 6 PM and went down themilitary training route straight to Stephenville and then they went to the BrownwoodMilitary Operations Area (MOA southwest of Stephenville), did their thing, came backover Stephenville and either went directly back to Carswell or took a little detour a fewmiles east. So, those first four jets took off from Carswell with one beacon in the lead andthey all four returned. Why Did Two F-16s Break Away from Formations?But, the third and fourth jet in that first sortie broke away from the first and second jetswith the lead beacon and they had to turn another beacon on. So, even though the firstfour jets left Carswell with a lead plane with one beacon, when they returned, there weretwo beacons now from that first group of four jets.To make things even more interesting is that the second sortie of four F-16s did exactly thesame thing. The first lead plane had one beacon and the other three were silent. But whenthey came back, there was another second beacon. So, now we have four beacons landingin those first eight jets, while only two beacons took off."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"WHY WOULD THEY HAVE DONE THAT?Because when they broke away from their formation, from their lead plane, they were nolonger safe. They only had a skin-paint return. They were flying near a major airport,DFW. They were not protected by the lead jet’s beacon. They had no way to know justwhere they were, so for safety reasons if I were the lead pilot, I certainly would not wantto fly around DFW without a beacon. So, I think for safety and regulations between theDepartment of Defense and the Federal Aviation Administration, if you have militaryplanes out there, the lead plane has to have a beacon. So when those jets broke away, theyhad to turn their beacon on, which they did.THEN WHAT IS NOT EXPLAINED IS WHY DID THOSE JETS BREAK AWAY ANDGO TO STEPHENVILLE?Exactly! In fact, the second group of jets that broke away were only in the militaryoperational area for ten minutes, so they did not do much training that day, did they?Those jets broke away from the lead plane and went back to Stephenville after only tenminutes in the training area. Why Did Two F-16s Go to Oklahomaand Circle Back Over Stephenville?Page 25: MUFON Special Research Report, Stephenville, Texas:“CAFB Jets 9 and 10 A 9th and 10th military jet departed CAFB to the northnear 6:30 PM and transited to a Military Operational Area (MOA) in southernOklahoma (well north of our primary area of interest (AOI), with the leadaircraft transmitting beacon returns on code 5241. These two aircraft remainedin loose formation for their entire flight and returned to CAFB using onlybeacon 5241 throughout. Their maneuvers in the Oklahoma MOA were limitedto simple and non-intricate concentric circular patterns. Their return to CAFBwas not direct as they traveled far to the south, and made a loop around theDublin-Stephenville area. It seems an odd occurrence that these two planesw ere di verted to the south after compl eti ng thei r maneuvers i n Okl ahoma. The9th and 10th jets then used the same southwestern military training route (MTR),between Stephenville and CAFB to return to base. Their return altitudes overStephenville and the AOI center near 7:40 PM was between 2,700 and 15,000above ground level (AGL) and their ground tracks were within 1 to 2 nauticalmiles east of the MTR centerline.”[Editor's Note: Nautical mile = 1/60 of a degree of longitude, which equals1.15 miles or 1.852 kilometers. This relationship is true for longitudes at theequator, which is 0 degrees latitude. At the Stephenville, Texas, latitude ofabout 30 degrees north, the relationship is about one degree of longitude equalsabout 51 nautical miles, rather than 60 nautical miles.] Now, let’s look at the 9th and 10th jets that went up north into Oklahoma. That was just asortie of two jets. The lead plane had its beacon on. The trailing plane stayed close to itand those two jets did the right thing. They stayed close enough flying together behind thatone beacon throughout their mission, even though it took them to Oklahoma and they did abig, wide swing back over Stephenville on their way back. They still had the same beacon"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"configuration on landing that they had on take off. But the first eight jets did not have thesame beacon configuration upon returning as they had on taking off. Confusing, isn’t it?The ninth and tenth jets that went up to Oklahoma are really a surprise to me becausewhen they got up to Oklahoma, all they did was make twelve circles in the air - no diving,no wing-overs, nothing like that. But the other eight jets that went to the Brownwoodmilitary operational area were doing all sorts of maneuvers. Their ground tracks look like abunch of spaghetti.The two Oklahoma jets made twelve very conventional circles and then went way southdown to Stephenville and came back up to Carswell in the same approach pattern that theoriginal eight jets did. So, I don’t know what was going on there. Carswell Log Book Blacked OutInformation on the Ten F-16s, January 8, 2008January 8, 2008, blacked out log book of times, codes and pin numbers for ten F-16 jetsout of the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth or NAS JRB Fort Worth,also known as Carswell Field, released in FOIA data to Schulze and Powell. The Carswell logbooks blacked out the ten F-16 codes, their pin numbers. The Carswelllog keeper did not want us to know what those beacons were when they took off or whatthey were when they landed.WHAT DO YOU SPECULATE WAS GOING ON?The scenario seemed to be a change of plans after the jets were in the air. That occurredfor reasons we don’t know, but apparently the ground controllers at Carswell must haveknown what was going on. So, I think the break ups into the two 4-plane sorties and the2-plane sortie that went to Oklahoma was commanded from Carswell AFB on the ground.Why that occurred? What the motivation was for that action? I don’t know.WHY WOULD CARSWELL BLACK OUT THE LOG RECORD?Oh, boy! I think the January 8, 2008, Carswell log book was blacked out on the ten F-16sbecause the military wanted as little known as possible about what their F-16s were doingthat day. They had been embarrassed by originally saying they had nothing in the air anddidn’t know anything about it. And then less than two weeks later when Karl Lewis sentout a revised press release, I think it was dawning on them that ‘Hey, people arerequesting the FAA radar data. Those planes of ours that had beacons are going to show uplike gang busters. We better come clean and tell the people that we did have F-16s in theair on January 8, 2008.’[ Editor's Note: Major Karl Lewis at the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve BaseFort Worth, also known as Carswell Field, issued a press release inmid-January 2008, to radio media only. Angelia Joiner, then working at theStephenville Empire-Tribune, had originally interviewed Major Lewis in earlyJanuary when he denied Carswell had any jets over Stephenville and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"dismissed the January 8, 2008, Steve Allen sighting as probably sunlightglinting off an airliner. But when he sent out his press release changing theCarswell story to confirm ten F-16s had been flying over the Stephenville,Texas, area on January 8, 2008, he did not send the news release to reporterAngelia Joiner. She had to call his office many times before he would evenspeak briefly with her in a formal and clipped manner that was completelydifferent than his relaxed demeanor during their first interview. ]So, I think it was my FOIA requests to the FAA that arrived eight days after the January 8events that got leaked over to the military and the military called Angelia to say, ‘We wantto be the first to tell you, the good guys that we are, that we did have ten F-16 jets in theair because they knew that Angelia would find out from us a month or so later.MEANING IT WAS THE FILING OF YOUR FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACTREQUESTS FOR THE FAA RADAR BEACON INFORMATION THAT WOULD HAVEGOTTEN TO MAJOR KARL LEWIS AT CARSWELL AND THEY WOULD HAVEKNOWN THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY ARE IN A SQUEEZE PLAY BETWEENWHAT THEY HAD FIRST DENIED AND WHAT WAS GOING TO BE REPORTEDFROM FOIA.Exactly! And the time line fits that scenario because there was only a four day span thereafter the FAA got our requests before Karl Lewis comes forth with, ‘Look, guys, we’regoing to level with you.’BUT WHY BLACK OUT THOSE RADAR LOGS?I think they wanted to expose to the public as little as possible on what the jet pin numberswere, what the codes were. They did not want people tracking their planes that day. Theydidn’t want people like Robert Powell and myself scooping them and proving beyond anyreasonable doubt where those planes were after they took off, when some broke off, whenother beacons were turned on. They don’t want all that made public because it looks likemission chaos to me.AS IF THEY WERE ALARMED BY SOMETHING? THAT THE JET ACTIVITY WASUNUSUALLY FOCUSED ON THE STEPHENVILLE REGION THE NIGHT OFJANUARY 8, BOTH IN THE SORTIE OF EIGHT JETS AND THE STRANGEBEHAVIOR OF THE TWO JETS THAT WENT UP INTO OKLAHOMA AND CAMEBACK DOWN TO STEPHENVILLE.That’s correct. From what I have been told by people who have looked at the normalincidents of fly-overs of the Stephenville area, on that night of January 8, 2008, there wasan abnormal level of military activity over Stephenville.” Radar Data Also Confirms AWAC At 41,000 FeetTHE IMPLICATIONS FOR ME ARE PUZZLING BECAUSE IF THE MILITARY DOESNOT KNOW WHAT THE UNKNOWN OBJECT IS, THEY ARE NOT GETTING ATRANSPONDER BEEP FROM IT, BUT CAN SEE SKIN-PAINT ON RADAR, WHYWOULDN'T THE MILITARY AT LEAST FLY UP AND TAKE A LOOK AT IT?Robert Powell: That would be a concern if the military did not get a radar signature onthe object because Glen and I were able to obtain the radar signature from a locationfarther away than the F-16s were. Additionally in our report, we believe there is probablyan AWAC (Airborne Early Warning Aircraft) in the area during this entire 4 PM to 8 PMtime frame.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – AWAC, Airborne Early Warning and Control, or Airborne Early Warning (AEW), is a radar system carried by an aircraft,which is designed to detect other aircraft.
