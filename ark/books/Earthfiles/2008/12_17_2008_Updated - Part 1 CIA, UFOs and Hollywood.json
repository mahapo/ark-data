Fifty-seven years ago on September 28, 1951, the original moviewas first released in black-and-white starring Michael Rennie and Patricia Neal. The storyis about a humanoid alien visitor named Klaatu who comes to Earth in a silver disc with hisrobot, Gort, to issue humankind a warning. The original screenwriter, Edmund H. North,based the script on a short story by Harry Bates entitled “Farewell to the Master,”published in the October 1940 issue of Astounding Science-Fiction.After demonstrating his ability to stop all machines and electric grids powered by magneticfields, Klaatu warns the people of Earth to either abandon warfare and peacefully joinother nations in the cosmos or be destroyed, adding, “The decision rests with you.” ThenKlaatu and Gort enter the spaceship and leave Earth.Original screenplay by Edmund H. North, w ho had servedin U. S. Army Signal Corps. Movie produced by 20th Century Foxfounded by Darryl F. Zanuck in 1933, who worked for the U. S.

Image source Wikipedia.Back in 1983, I was in the script development phase of producing an hour specialdocumentary for Home Box Office with the working title UFOs: The E. T. Factor. Duringresearch, I was told by an intelligence source that the funding and script inspiration for TheDay the Earth Stood Still were actually provided by the Central Intelligence Agencybehind-the-scenes in order to test the public's reaction to extraterrestrials that came inorganic form and robotic form and could cause large scale electrical blackouts.Reinforcing that concept of CIA manipulation of Hollywood to produce movies that canalter public perceptions and be used to monitor public reactions are two British authors,Robbie Graham and Matthew Alford. In the recent November 14, 2008, issue of TheGuardian newspaper in the U. K., one of their co-authored articles was published underthe headline, “An Offer They Couldn't Refuse. The CIA is often credited with ‘advice’ onHollywood films, but no one is truly sure about the extent of its shadowy involvement.Matthew Alford and Robbie Graham investigate.”See November 14, 2008, article at The Guardian.In their originally submitted article and title, “The Deep Politics of Hollywood - Part One:Spooks and the Silver Screen,” Graham and Alford wrote:“Hollywood’s history as a propaganda machine is a long one, and extensivelydocumented. It is common knowledge, for example, that during World War IIWashington had Hollywood give itself over completely to the propagandaeffort. Cinema was viewed by the U.S. government as essential to fosteringpopular support for its costly role in the Allied campaign, and this wasevidenced as early as 1942 when a selection of Hollywood directors–including such luminaries as Frank Capra and John Ford– were invited to theWhite House at the behest of President Franklin D. Roosevelt for the purposeof commissioning dozens of rallying productions, among them Capra’scelebrated propaganda series, Why We Fight (1943-1945).“By 1947, a permanent partnership had been established between Hollywoodand the Department of Defense (Pentagon) as the newly formed ‘nationalsecurity state’ became increasingly dependent upon the Cinema industry forthe maintenance of its righteous public image.”Robbie Graham is 27-years-old and was born and raised in North Staffordshire county inthe British Midlands. He earned a Masters Degree with Distinction in film and televisionfrom the University of Bristol in 2005-2006, and works as an Associate Lecturer in Mediaat Stafford College. Recently, Robbie submitted his application to work on his Ph.D. at the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"University of Bristol in Fall 2009, described in his application as: “UFOs and Hollywood,The Cinematic Construction of Ufological Perceptions – Past and Present.”Matthew Alford, Ph.D., earned his Ph.D. in 2008, from the University of Bath focused onFilm and Propaganda, and is now a lecturer in film at that university's Department ofDrama: Theater, Film and Television. He is author of a forthcoming book, ProjectingPower: American Foreign Policy and the Hollywood Propaganda System.Last week I talked with Robbie and Matthew about their November 14, 2008, co-authoredarticle in The Guardian that was the first part of a three-part series. As well-researchedand sourced as the three-part series is, so far among the several major English newspapersto which Robbie and Matthew submitted their work, only The Guardian agreed to publishthe first part and turned down the second part entitled, “The Lies Are Out There... .” Inthat second part, the two researchers include a surprising and provocative discovery aboutthe famous Hollywood film director, Steven Spielberg:“Shadowy government agendas aside, it is a demonstrable fact that variousU.S. agencies have in the past made concerted efforts to affect the output ofnational media for political purposes – cinema included. There is also ampleevidence to suggest that such efforts have, at times, been related to the UFOphenomenon.“Discussing his classic UFO blockbuster Close Encounters of the Third Kind(1977), Steven Spielberg once revealed in an obscure and now defunctacademic journal that he ‘really found faith [in alien visitation]’ when heheard that the government opposed the film. ‘If NASA took the time to writeme a 20-page letter, then I knew there must be something happening,’Spielberg said. ‘When they read the script, they got very angry and felt that itwas a film that would be dangerous. I felt they mainly wrote the letter becauseJaws convinced so many people around the world that there were sharks intoilets and bathtubs, not just in the oceans and rivers. They were afraid thesame kind of epidemic would happen with UFOs.’”Interview:Robbie Graham, M.A., Associate Lecturer in Media,Stafford College, Stafford, Staffordshire, U.K.Robbie Graham, M.A., Associate Lecturer in Media, Stafford College, Stafford,Staffordshire, England: “It seems likely that as early as 1951. the CIA had concludedUFOs to be of non-human design. Walt Disney and U. S. Air ForceWard Kimball, the Oscar-winning animator, revealed this story in 1979. He was talkingabout a project in the mid-1950s where the U. S. Air Force approached Walt Disneyhimself to make an animated educational documentary on the subject of UFOs, flyingsaucers. Disney had worked with the USAF and military previously during the SecondWorld War and he had a very close relationship with the Department of Defense. Heproduced propaganda shorts for the military during WWII and they were quite cozy,really."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"1954, Walt Disney holding on to V-2 rocket model while Dr. Werhner von Braunholds model of XR-1 plane. Dr. von Braun was then Chief of the Guided MissileDevelopment Operation Division at the U. S. Army's Ballistic Missile Agency in RedstoneArsenal, Alabama. In the 1950s, Dr. von Braun worked with the Disney Studio as a technicaldirector on three films about space exploration for television. Man in Space aired onABC-TV, March 9, 1955; Man and the Moon also aired in 1955; Mars and Beyondwas televised on December 4, 1957. Photo source NACA,National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.So, according to Kimball, Disney went along with this deal. According to Kimball, thepurpose of the documentary was to help acclimatize the American public to the existenceof extraterrestrials. That would seem to be a departure from the USAF's previous efforts tomore along the debunking side of things.So, what happened was the Air Force, according to Kimball, offered Disney real footage ofUFOs for use in his documentary. And Disney started to draw conceptual designs for thisUFO documentary. But at the last minute, the USAF decided to pull out and said theywould no longer provide the footage. When that happened, Kimball said he challenged theofficial USAF liaison to the documentary film project who was a Colonel. This Colonelallegedly told Kimball, ‘There was indeed plenty of UFO footage, but that neither Kimballnor anyone else was going to get access to it.’ So, of course, the project was abandoned.DID KIMBALL HAVE ANY INSIGHT ABOUT WHAT CHANGED ON THEGOVERNMENT'S SIDE TO PULL FILM THAT WAS GOING TO ITS LONG-TIMEALLY, WALT DISNEY?As the story stands, no, there was no further information given about the reasons why theUSAF pulled the footage.THAT IS MY EXPERIENCE. THAT IS BOB EMENEGGER'S EXPERIENCE ANDMAYBE OTHERS THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT WHERE WE AREAPPROACHED BY SOMEBODY REPRESENTING THEMSELVES WITH THE"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"GOVERNMENT WHO SAYS THAT FOOTAGE OF REAL UFOS WILL BE RELEASEDTO EACH OF US FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS. THEN AT THELAST MINUTE, NOTHING IS FORTHCOMING.Yeah, there seems to be a pattern here. The Ward Kimball story I just spoke about was, asfar as I'm aware, the first time the USAF had offered supposedly real UFO footage to afilmmaker only to suddenly, without explanation, withdraw that offer. It would happenagain in 1971, when filmmaker Robert Emenegger was approached by the USAF throughhis production partner, Alan Sandler.[ Editor's Note: Robert Emenegger, Grey Advertising, and Allan F. Sandler,Sandler Institutional Films, Inc., Los Angeles, produced a 1976 documentaryentitled, UFOS: It Has Begun, that allegedly contains a few seconds of actualmilitary footage of an egg-shaped UFO flying in the sky at Holloman AFB.Emenegger also authored a book entitled, UFOS: Past, Present and Future ©1974 by Sandler Institutional Films, Inc. and published by Ballantine Books.For more information about the Emenegger and Sandler production effortsand an offer of similar UFO footage at Holloman AFB presented to me for aHome Box Office documentary in 1983, please see my 2-volume book,Glimpses of Other Realities and my first book An Alien Harvest in theEarthfiles Shop.]I think, to be honest, Linda, that at the time, if the CIA or other agencies had reached thisfantastical conclusion, then I think the feeling would have been, ‘If we’re being visited,this is not going to stop over night. This is actually going to continue and it’s only going toget more visible. Therefore, there is only so much we can do to actually keep a lid on this.’And so the thinking might have been, ‘We can’t cover it up completely, but what we cando is manage public perception of it. We can monitor public perception of it andmanipulate that to suit us, or to at least cover our backs.’I also think that what was going on at that time in their minds was, ‘Well, this whole thingcould break open any day now. This could break open tomorrow, next week, next year, acouple of years, maybe ten years.’ But the fact is, I think any logical person who hadinformation about this at the time would have assumed that this (alien visiting) is onlygoing to continue, that the authorities were going to have to prepare for the time when thisall blows apart and is public knowledge. Was 1951 The Day The Earth Stood StillA CIA Test of Public?Therefore, I think that perhaps something like the original 1951 The Day The Earth StoodStill – if indeed, as you say, it was a CIA-inspired production – it might well have beensome kind of a test. It might have been partly an acclimatization, maybe misinformation – Itend to favor acclimatization – just to see peoples’ reactions to these things, or to perhapsfeed certain types of perceptions to the public.ROBBIE, COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN THE ROLE THAT SCREENWRITEREDMUND NORTH PLAYED IN THE FILM AND WHY THAT MIGHT SUPPORT THEIDEA THAT THE MOVIE WAS INSPIRED BY THE CIA?Yes, Edmund H. North – he was selected to adapt the short story from ‘Farewell to theMaster,’ a short science fiction story. He turned that into the script for The Day The EarthStood Still. North was selected by 20th Century Fox for this assignment. Only monthsbefore North was selected by Fox to pen the script, he was actively serving as a Major inthe U. S. Army Signal Corps. In fact, a lot of people working in Hollywood during the1950s had a background in the Army Signal Corps. His main role was actually to maketraining and educational documentaries, essentially propaganda films. Later on, Northestablished himself as a successful Hollywood screenwriter of war films and won an Oscarfor Patton in 1970.WHAT A NATURAL THEN FOR THE SCREENWRITER, WHO WOULD CONTROLTHE CONTENT, TO HAVE WORKED IN THE ARMY SIGNAL CORPS ONPROPAGANDA FILMS.Yeah! I think the scenario we can speculate about would be that perhaps the CIA decidessomeone should make a film about flying saucers with a particular message and particularUfological content. The CIA would have a good say about what goes into the film, and thebest way to do that would be to assign a sympathetic scriptwriter to do this in cooperationwith a sympathetic studio such as Fox. So, you’ve got all the ingredients there for the kindof film we’re talking about."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"BUT SIXTY YEARS LATER IN 2008, IT CERTAINLY SEEMS NOW MORE LOGICALTO DISCUSS THE HYPOTHESIS THAT EDMUND NORTH WAS ASSIGNED BYSOMEBODY IN THE GOVERNMENT TO BE THE SCREENWRITER THAT FOXWOULD END UP PRODUCING.Perhaps. The production head of 20th Century Fox at the time was Daryl Zanuck – thevery famous movie producer. He is the guy who would have been overseeing the 1951production of The Day The Earth Stood Still. And Zanuck was very closely tied to theestablishment in Washington, D. C. He was very sympathetic to government causes. Hegave a famous quote in the 1940s that is very relevant to what we are talking about here:‘If you have something worthwhile to say, dress it up in the glittering robes ofentertainment and you will find a ready market. Without entertainment, no propagandafilm is worth a dime.’ So, his views on the propagandist function of cinema were prettyclear, coupled with the fact that he was so closely tied to the Washington, D. C.establishment. Steven Spielberg Versus NASACOULD WE JUMP ABOUT A QUARTER CENTURY INTO THE FUTURE FROM1951'S THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL TO THE 1977 CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OFTHE THIRD KIND BY STEVEN SPIELBERG? CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHATHAPPENED WITH STEVEN SPIELBERG AND THAT 20-PAGE LETTER HERECEIVED FROM NASA?Yeah, well, Spielberg was denied cooperation by NASA for that film, Close Encounters.According to Spielberg, NASA sent him a 20-page letter in 1977 denying cooperation andSpielberg said: ‘I really found my faith [in alien visitation]’ when he heard the governmentopposed the film. ‘If NASA took the time to write me a 20-page letter, then I knew theremust be something happening. When they read the script, they got very angry and felt thatit was a film that would be dangerous. I felt they mainly wrote the letter because Jawsconvinced so many people around the world that there were sharks in toilets and bathtubs,not just in the oceans and rivers. They (NASA) were afraid the same kind of epidemicwould happen with UFOs.’Theatrical poster for Close Encounters of the Third Kind,released on November 16, 1977, directed by Steven Spielbergand distributed by Columbia Pictures.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Close Encounters of the Third Kind is a 1977science fiction film directed and written by Steven Spielberg, which tells thestory of an Indiana electrical lineman, and his encounter and obsessions withunidentified flying objects. The plot further develops due to the presence ofthe United States government and their scientific researchers.” ]Matthew Alford, my writing partner, and I were quite astounded by this quote and no oneelse had seemed to pick up on the importance and significance of it. So, we wanted totrace it back to its original source and see if it were authentic. We contacted Spielberg'spublicist, Martin Levy, at Dreamworks and put this quote to him and asked if it weregenuine and if he could confirm with Spielberg. He said he would do that. He was veryobliging. He said he would pursue Spielberg on the issue, but that was the end of that.We've not heard from him since.But thankfully, Matthew Alford did manage to trace the quote back to its original source,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"which was a very obscure and now defunct academic journal from Australia from 1978summer issue of Cinema Papers by Gail Heathwood, so the quote is authentic. That isquite significant in itself because you have NASA denying a big block bluster filmmakercooperation. According to Spielberg, this was on the grounds of its content in terms ofUFOs and NASA was worried about how this might impact public perception and interestin the UFO phenomenon.[ Editor's Note: Source of Spielberg quote is April - June 1978 summer issueof Cinema Papers, Australian film magazine, in an article entitled “StevenSpielberg” and authored by Gail Heathwood. ]WHY THE WORD ‘DANGEROUS’?And dangerous, yeah. We're trying to get hold of that original letter now. We put in aFreedom of Information Act request with NASA for that letter and we're also pursuing itthrough other avenues as well. So, we want to see that letter and its contents. For now, wecan only talk about what Spielberg said about the letter, which might be different fromwhat the letter actually contains. Spielberg's interpretation was that NASA felt that itwould be dangerous.One of the reasons for NASA's resistance might be linked to Jimmy Carter, who waselected U. S. president in 1977, the same year as Spielberg's Close Encounters film.President Carter was pushing NASA to do a UFO investigation. But USAF Col. CharlesSenn, Chief of USAF Community Relations Division, wrote a letter on September 1, 1977,to Lieutenant General Duward Crow of NASA, stating: ‘I sincerely hope that you aresuccessful in preventing a reopening of UFO investigations.’ So, President Carter tried tomake NASA bend to his will and the USAF didn't want the UFO subject focused on, sothat might explain why NASA denied Spielberg cooperation later on for his movie. [ SeeMore Information below for Jimmy Carter's UFO report.]Spielberg also did the recent Wa r o f t h e Wo r l d s (with Tom Cruise), another re-make thatwas very successful. Spielberg even had aliens and/or inter-dimensional beings show up iinthe latest installment of his latest 2008 Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the CrystalSkull. And he has produced a great many TV shows about aliens, including the 2002famous Ta k e n, Batteries Not Included, and other major feature films such as Men In Blackand Men In Black II, Transformers – which is very interesting. 2007 Hollywood Transformers Madewith DOD Help - and ‘Special Access’?“Their war, our world.”Transformers, produced by Steven Spielberg,and released July 2, 2007, in United States by DreamWorks,Paramount and United International Pictures.The DOD played a huge role in that film, Transformers – unprecedented cooperationbetween the Department of Defense and the filmmakers. The Transformers film script, for"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"anyone who watches carefully – although it appears on the surface as a big, dumb actionfilm, which it is - but beyond that, there is very interesting dialogue and the script is loadedwith Ufological references and insider intelligence terms. However, the terms ‘Area 51’and ‘Roswell’ are conspicuously absent. The film subtly absolves American electedofficials of complicity in what turns out to be a massive cover-up of the fact that the Earthhas been visited by aliens.Actually, what the film does more specifically is absolve the military. It absolves theDepartment of Defense and the Secretary of Defense of being involved in thisdecades-long cover-up and the fact we’ve been visited by aliens. The film pins theconspiracy instead on a quasi-governmental ‘Sector 7,’ as it is referred to, which fordecades has been concealing its UFO investigations beneath what they term in the filmamazingly as ‘Special Access Projects.’THAT WOULD BE MJ-12, OR MAJESTIC 12.Yes, ‘Special Access Project’ is a legitimate term. It is used in military intelligence circlesand research indicates that in real life, UFO projects are concealed within what are knownas Special Access Programs. So, it’s interesting that the Transformers film uses thatterminology.But what else is really important is there is very labored rhetoric in one of the sceneswhich absolves the Secretary of Defense and military of any kind of cover-up and theyactually pin the responsibility on someone else. The Secretary of Defense officials say thatcover-ups are going on without their knowledge and authorities are shocked andconcerned that this has been happening and they raise the idea that UFOs could be adefense threat. Non-Biological Extraterrestrials, NBEsROBBIE, HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE THE BOTTOM LINE INTRANSFORMERS CONCERNING HOW THE NON-HUMAN AGENDAS ARECHARACTERIZED?That’s interesting in itself. There are two competing factions. They are alien robots, thesetransformers are robots in disguise. Throughout the film, they are referred to as ‘robots,’but by the government, they are called ‘aliens.’ They are also more specifically referred toas ‘NBEs.’ NBEs in Tr ansf or mer s stands for ‘non-biological extraterrestrials.’ And in thefilm, they refer to one of the captured extraterrestrials as NBE1, which will ring a bell withmany people familiar with the subject such as EBEs and EBE1 and EBE2. Those are the‘extraterrestrial biological entities’ referred to in UFO literature and featured in theMajestic-12 documents. You know, it's very closely resembling what is supposed to bereal.MEANING EBE 1, EBE 2 AND WHO KNOWS HOW MANY MORE ENTITIESALLEGEDLY RETRIEVED FROM CRASH SITES?Ye s . I n Tr ansf or mer s, there are two factions: the good, savior transformer aliens whocome here to protect humanity. And then there are the evil, destructive aliens who come tous to enslave humanity. The good ones are there to protect and the bad ones are there todestroy. So, it’s this inter-galactic war going on with Earth as the battleground.That's very interesting politically. And all sorts of stuff could be read into it. All of thisstuff lacks smoking gun evidence, but I think from a certain amount of research into it andtaking into account documented history of cinematic propaganda, in America there iscertainly the foundation for information ideas to be filtered into Hollywood cinema andinto UFO films. Hidden Agenda Behind December 2008The Day The Earth Stood Still?WHY DO YOU THINK THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL HAS BEEN RE-MADENOW FOR RELEASE IN DECEMBER 2008?(laughs) Well, I do think there is some kind of release program. I don’t think it isconsistent and I think the agenda is changed and keeps changing from decade-to-decadeand perhaps from administration-to-administration in America and probably in the U. K. aswell. I think there is a slow movement towards disclosure."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" But what is disturbing and why I think it is important to look at the representation ofUFOs in cinema is that overwhelmingly, aliens are portrayed in Hollywood cinema ashostile and invasive. So everyone’s collective perception of aliens is as an invading force.They are hostile, evil entities.I don’t think that any one person anywhere really knows the full picture of what is goingon in terms of UFOs - not inside the government or out, or inside the corporate or privatebusiness worlds. I don’t think that any one person has the full picture.It’s an established fact, we can say with 100% certainty, that for various reasons we canonly speculate about, the U. S. government, the USAF in particular and probably the CIA,have taken a strong interest in the content of UFO films since at least 1949. That in itselfbegs a lot of questions. Why is that the case? Why are they so interested in affecting thecontent of what are supposed to be science fiction films?My interest in government concerns with UFO films and involvement with them and incinema in general has to do with the idea of perception management. We're trying to makepeople aware of the fact that what they are watching in the cinema, whether it be relatedto UFOs or to just anything is often more than it seems to be and there are a lot of powersbehind cinema pulling strings and pushing agendas. The government through the militaryand CIA and Department of Defense has for many years now taken a very strong interestin all sorts of films, not just related to UFOs, but related to other subjectts. And cinema,make no mistake, has been in the past and continues to date to be used as a propagandisttool.”To be continued in Part 2: CIA, UFOs and Hollywood with Matthew AlfordMore Information:“It was the darndest thing I've ever seen. It was big,it was very bright, it changed colors and it was about the size of the moon.We watched it for ten minutes, but none of us could figure out what it was.One thing's for sure, I'll never make fun of people who say they've seenunidentified objects in the sky.
