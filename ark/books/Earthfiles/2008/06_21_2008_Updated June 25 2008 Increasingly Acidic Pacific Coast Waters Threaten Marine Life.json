By the end of this centurythe models predict a total drop in pH of 0.4 which is actually morelike a 150% increase in acidity. For ocean chemistry, this is very dramatic –a bigger change than we’ve seen for at least the last 5 million years on planet Earth.And it’s more than 100 times faster rate of change than we’ve seenover that period.” - Christopher Sabine, Ph.D., NOAA Coccolithosphores, single-celled algae, that contain calcium carbonate shells.When exposed to acidic water equivalent to the 800 ppm upwelling ocean samples in 2007off the California coast, the Coccolithosphores become malformed and deteriorate.Images by Riebesell and Zondervan in 2000 and 2001.June 21, 2008 Corvallis, Oregon and Shelton, Washington - None of the globalwarming climate models saw open oceans increasing in acidity by 30% or more until theend of the 21st Century. But a new study published in the June 2008 journal, Science,shows that Pacific ocean water only four miles off the northern California shore, is already30% more acidic than normal. When I did my first Earthfiles.com report about theacidification of the world’s oceans [ 081304 Earthfiles ], computer models wereprojecting that open ocean acidity might seriously increase by at least 30% or more at theend of the 21st Century - not by 2008.By 2008, it is estimated that oceans have absorbed 525 billion tons of greenhouse gases.All the carbon dioxide absorbed by seawater has produced increasing amounts of carbonicacid. The calcium carbonate shells of clams, oysters, corals, small snails called Pteropodsand some planktons weaken and disintegrate in carbonic acid."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Sea Butterfly, a small Pteropod, or snail, that has a thin,calcium carbonate shell, which can easily dissolve in carbonic acid.Sea creatures make their shells in the surface waters where there is a lot of calcium andcarbonate. Deeper below, the ocean has such high concentrations of CO2 from bothatmospheric absorption and natural decay of organic material that the deep ocean CO2destroys carbonate ions which dissolves shells. That ocean level where carbon dioxidedissolves shells is getting higher and higher toward surface waters. And no one expected tosee it break through now on the West Coast.But last summer of 2007, NOAA and Oregon State University scientists sampled waterduring the spring and summer season of ocean upwelling when winds blow strongly fromthe north and push the surface waters away. In that displacement, deeper and much olderwater wells up to the surface carrying all its carbon dioxide. As CO2 has increased in theEarth’s atmosphere each year for nearly 200 years, that means upwelling ocean water hasstored an ever-increasing amount of carbon dioxide, which can create more carbonic acidthat dissolves calcium carbonate shells.Ken Caldeira, Ph.D., at the Carnegie Institution for Science, Department of GlobalEcology, Stanford University, pointed out in 2006 that “the oceans naturally absorb just0.1 gigatons more CO2 per year than they release. Now they are soaking up an extra 2gigatons a year, more than 20 times the natural rate. Even if we halve emissions, that willmerely double the time until we kill off your favorite plant or animal. ...The last time theoceans endured such a drastic change in chemistry was 65 million years ago, at about thesame time the dinosaurs went extinct.”What are the future implications of an increasingly acidic ocean? I asked both ChristopherSabine, Ph.D., and Prof. Burke Hales, Ph.D., oceanographers, who are two of theco-authors of the June 2008 Science journal study, plus Brett Bishop, a shellfish grower inShelton, Washington.Interviews:“We have already seen in 2007 a drop in pH of 0.1,which equates to ~30% increase in acidity.

In fact, we found it during our survey cruise all the wayto the surface. We found water, which had a pH of 7.8, which is much lower than weexpected to see, which can corrosively dissolve shellfish calcium carbonate shells at thesurface waters right near the California and Oregon border. That’s where we saw the mostacidified water. And of course, that’s where all the shellfish industries are on the shelf!I know that none of us really expected to find these acidified waters making it all the wayto the surface. So, we were quite shocked."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"NOAA research team recovered the water sampling package called a rosette.Each of the gray cylinders can be closed at whatever depth the scientists choose.Each bottle traps 11 liters of water that can then be sub-sampled by the various analystson the ship for a variety of measurements. Image courtesy NOAA.The pCO2 of the upwelled waters off of California was over 800ppm. This is becausemanmade industrial CO2 is adding to waters that were already naturally high in CO2 afterthe natural decomposition of organic matter in the water column. The surface waters aregenerally close to atmospheric CO2 concentrations (385ppm), but as you go deeper in thewater column, the CO2 concentrations increase from the accumulation of biological CO2.These vertical gradients will still exist in the future, but as atmospheric CO2 increases, thewhole curve will increase. Instead of going from 385 to 800 between the surface anddeeper, we could be seeing 800 to 1300ppm between the surface and deeper ocean waterby the year 2100.As the ocean concentration of carbon dioxide inicreases, so does acidity,causing pH to decline. Graphic courtesy NOAA.Ocean Level That Can DissolveCalcium Carbonate Shells Keeps RisingTHE IMPLICATION FOR 2008 AND GOING FORWARD IS WHAT?Next year, we estimate from the chemistry and the rate at which the oceans are taking upCO2 that the dissolving-shells-level is getting shallower by about 1 meter per year, or alittle more than 3 feet. So, this year of 2008, it’s going to be that much more shallow andmore acidified water is going to get up on the continental shelf. Next year, it will be evenshallower. This will just keep continuing. So, the chemistry is going to get worse and worseevery year.The oceans are absorbing about 2 billion metric tons of carbon per year. Every year, it"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"absorbs 2 more billion, 2 more billion, 2 more billion. And as long as atmospheric CO2continues to increase, the oceans will continue to absorb that CO2. That’s going tocontinue to change the chemistry of the oceans.SINCE THE DEEP UPWELLING OCEAN WATER ALREADY CONTAINS MORE CO2THAT IT HAS ABSORBED IN SOME PAST YEAR FROM THE ATMOSPHERE,DOESN’T THIS ALSO IMPLY THERE IS NO WAY NOW THAT HUMANCIVILIZATION CAN CHANGE THIS INCREASE OF CARBONIC ACID CURRENTLYIN THE OCEANS?If we have some way of decreasing atmospheric CO2, it can be reversed. But generally,that’s not likely to happen. And even if it did, it’s a very long process that can takethousands of years at best.SO ARE WE IN KIND OF AN IRRETRIEVABLE SITUATION NOW?In terms of the chemistry, it would be very difficult to reverse this. And one of the thingswe are concerned about is the viability of coral reefs. And the corals not only are affectedby ocean acidification, but are also affected by coral bleaching, which is a temperatureaffect, and are affected by pressures from the boating industry and pollution and all thesesorts of things.LIKE WARM TEMPERATURES FROM GLOBAL WARMING IN THE WATER.Exactly. As bad as ocean acidification is, it seems to be worse at high temperatures!Dr. Sabine: “Corals are dissolving from carbonic acid exposurein this image and you can actually see holes in the coral structure.”Image © Jason Hall-Spencer, The Royal Society, London, U.K.Will Rising Carbonic Acid LevelsCause Marine Extinctions?HOW IN THE WORLD WOULD ANY OF THESE LIFE FORMS MAKE IT OUT OFTHIS CENTURY WITH THE INEVITABLE INCREASE OF CARBONIC ACID?That’s our concern. That’s why we’re trying to make the public aware of this. I don’t knowexactly what the solutions will be. We’re trying to remain optimistic trying to find someway out of this, but until we fully understand what’s going on and what the ecologicalconsequences are going to be, we can’t really say what the future is going to hold for us.But I agree, it does not look great.ON THE OTHER SIDE OF NOT LOOKING GREAT ARE A LOT OF EXTINCTIONS,CORRECT?Potentially. My biggest fear is that we’re going to sit and ignore this until it’s too late. It’s acascading effect. As soon as you start to lose organisms at the lower end of the food chain,it will just propagate right on up the food chain. We don’t know what the consequences ofthat will be. But once a species goes extinct – and I don’t know if it will or not – but if itdoes, then there is no getting it back. That’s when it’s too late.ONE SCIENTIST SAID TO ME THAT WHAT HE SEES HAPPENING THIS CENTURYIS THAT THE SALMON WILL BE REPLACED BY JELLY FISH.There is evidence that jelly fish do live better in higher CO2 environments. They are oneof the species that seems to do better in a higher CO2 environment. For salmon, we’veseen, for example, that the pink salmon at a particular juvenile stage have 40% of their dietis made of these Pteropods, which produce calcium carbonate shells. So, if we lose thosePteropods, that’s potentially a major food source for these salmon."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Pink Salmon, Oncorhynchus gorbuscha.Illustration by Timothy Knepp for U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service.We don’t know what happens if you take away that major food source for the juvenilesalmon. But we could potentially lose the salmon.ALREADY THE SALMON ARE FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES ALONG THEPACIFIC COAST IN ALMOST ALL OF THE SPECIES.Exactly. The problem with ocean acidification is that there is a tremendous momentum tothe system – that it’s just going to continue to get worse and worse and worse. It’s not thekind of thing that you can just turn off once it gets going. Can Ocean Carbonic Acid Be Neutralized?SO, THE IDEA OF TAKING SODA POWDER AND SPREADING IT ON TO THEOCEANS TO NEUTRALIZE CARBONIC ACID IS NOT EFFECTIVE ORECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE?It’s not really economically feasible. And we worry about any time you’re trying to addanother chemical to counteract the chemicals you are putting into the ocean. Either way,you are changing the chemistry of the ocean. We don’t know that adding some materialthat would neutralize the carbon would not be just as bad in a different way as the carbon.If there is anything we’ve learned from history is that when we leap into trying tomanipulate the environment to our own needs, we frequently cause bigger problems thanwe intended.So, the ultimate solution for this is just to remove that CO2 from the atmosphere and stopdriving it into the oceans. The oceans will generally clean themselves up. It will be a slowprocess, but if we can find a way to stop putting CO2 into the atmosphere and find a wayto get it out of the atmosphere, then I think the oceans can fix themselves.BUT WHERE IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE THAT WE’RE SLOWING DOWN CO2GOING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE AND WATER?Oh, we’re not! We’re definitely not slowing down. But if we can at least slow it down,then that’s something! Even if you cooled the planet, ocean acidification would continue.That’s my concern with people who have suggested technological solutions to globalwarming by, for example, shielding, putting up sulfate aerosols to lower globaltemperatures, or shielding some of the solar energy coming into the Earth to try to lowertemperatures. Those are great – they would reduce temperature. But they don’t doanything for the rising CO2. So, you will still have ocean acidification. The only solutionsthat will help us are actually reducing the CO2 directly.

THE IPCC PROJECTS THERE WILL BE ALMOST A DOUBLING, I BELIEVE, INTHE ATMOSPHERE IN THIS REMAINING 90 YEARS IN THE REMAINDER OFTHIS CENTURY FROM 383 PPMV NOW TO ABOUT DOUBLE THAT (766 PPMV). IFTHAT IS WHERE CO2 ENDS UP OVER THE NEXT 90 YEARS, WHAT WOULDHAPPEN TO CARBONIC ACID IN THE OCEANS?In the last 200 years, we’ve seen a drop of about .1 pH units. It’s projected that if wedouble the CO2 from today’s concentration, by the end of this century we’ll see another .4drop in pH. So, that’s four times the change we’ve seen so far over the last 200 years.That’s because this is an exponential increase and then we don’t know what the impact onthe ecosystems will be.We have already seen in 2007 a drop in pH of 0.1, which equates to ~30% increase inacidity. By the end of this century the models predict a total drop in pH of 0.4 which isactually more like a 150% increase in acidity. For ocean chemistry, this is very dramatic –a bigger change than we’ve seen for at least the last 5 million years on planet Earth.And it’s more than 100 times faster rate of change than we’ve seen over that period. Forocean chemistry, this is very dramatic – a bigger change than we’ve seen for at least thelast 5 million years on planet Earth.

We know very well that you can’t change thechemistry and this is going to get worse. I’m hopeful that technologies will be developedthat can help us find a way out of this problem.IF THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN, WHAT?If that doesn’t happen, then we will be living in a very different world 50 years from nowand our kids will have to deal with that.DO YOU THINK IT’S REALISTIC TO SAY AS SOME SCIENTISTS DO THAT ONLAND THAT IT WILL BE THE ROACHES, RATS AND WEEDS THAT WILL TAKEOVER AND JELLY FISH IN THE OCEANS?I honestly don’t know. I hope not. That’s not the kind of world I want to live in.” Burke Hales, Ph.D., Assoc. Professor of Oceanography, Oregon State University,Corvallis, Oregon: “What we did is that we showed that there are acidity levels that arepotentially corrosive to these marine animals at the surface water today.AND EXPANDING, CORRECT?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Should be. Upwelled water takes a long time to get here. So, the water that is upwellingtoday was actually exposed to an atmosphere about 50 years ago (in 1958), which hadlower carbon dioxide concentration then. So, since the atmosphere’s concentration of CO2has increased over that time, the water that’s on its way here has seen ever-increasingcarbon dioxide levels. As a result, the water that upwells along the Pacific Ocean thissummer will have a higher acidity as its starting point than the water that upwelled lastsummer and so on.We think somewhere between one-third and one-half of the carbon dioxide that’s beenproduced by human processes over the Industrial Revolution is now in the ocean. What wefound is that upwelling areas of the coastal ocean are experiencing these corrosiveconditions sooner than we would have expected based on our studies of the open ocean.IN FACT, THE COMPUTER MODELS DID NOT HAVE THIS KIND OF ACIDITYOCCURRING BEFORE THE END OF THE 21ST CENTURY, CORRECT?For the open ocean, that’s correct. What we do know now is that things are this bad now(in the upwelling water along the Pacific Coast) when that water was originally exposed toan atmosphere that had 310 parts per million carbon dioxide and we’re now already up to385 ppm. What we expect is that the upwelling water we see between now and the nextfifty years is going to increase in acidity and increase in corrosiveness to the carbonateshells and it’s probably going to be an effect that is three or four times more acidic than wesee today. What Will Happen to Marine Life?We don’t really know that yet. What we’ve seen in the laboratory studies that look at thisis that in the coral reefs, their growth rate decreases. There have been some other studiesthat show economically important species of muscles and oysters start to decrease theirshell growth rate. What we don’t know is how the ecosystem as a whole will respond tothat (slower growth of muscles and oysters and other carbonate-shelled marine life). Canthe organisms adapt or will they just be lost from the ecosystem and the ecosystem willchange? We don’t know that.California mussels have calcium carbonate shells that can dissolve in carbonic acid.Other marine creatures with calcium carbonate shells that are threatened by increasingocean acidity are clams, oysters, corals, Pteropods and some plankton species.ARE THERE ANY STUDIES THAT INDICATE CLAMS AND OYSTERS WON’T BEABLE TO SURVIVE AT ALL?No, there is data that suggests they do worse when it gets acidic, but as to whether theywon’t survive at all, we just don’t know.We know it will hurt their survival. We don’t know the extent of it. We know that inlaboratory experiments, when you change the acidic conditions, they don’t do well. Whatwe don’t understand is whether the clams and oysters and so on have adaptationstrategies? Or if a little bit of acidification makes them more vulnerable to predators, forexample? It’s very possible that an oyster in the absence of predators could live just finewith a thinner shell. On the other hand, things that like to eat oysters probably are going todo much better in breaking down the oyster shells and getting to them to eat.WHAT OTHER LIFE FORMS THAT WE REALLY NEED IN THE FOOD CHAIN AREAFFECTED BY CARBONIC ACID?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Essentially anything that makes a carbonate-based shell – whether it is calcium carbonateor magnesium carbonate – those organisms are going to be sensitive to ocean acidification.Those are not limited to just corals and clams and muscles and oysters and barnacles. Anumber of plankton organisms make calcium carbonate shells. And these are very low onthe food chain, which means they provide sustenance for so many other creatures up thefood chain.There have been some studies that suggest some forms of plankton do better in a highcarbon dioxide world than in a low carbon dioxide world. So we don’t know how thisacidity is going to change things in terms of the total number of plankton biomass. What isfairly clear is that there will be changes in the food web structure. Will Jelly Fish Take Over the Oceans?Jelly fish thrive in low pH water and high carbon dioxide.One example is there have been some studies that suggest jelly fish do very well in a lowpH, high carbon dioxide world. So, it might be rather than widespread mortality in theoceans that we change to one that has a higher proportion of jelly fish in the food web.THAT'S LIKE SOME ZOOLOGISTS AND BOTANISTS HAVE PROJECTED THAT ONLAND THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE IN ROACHES AND RATS AND WEEDS!(laughs) Well, the jelly fish is a good analogy there.BECAUSE IF THE OCEANS FILL UP WITH JELLY FISH, THEN WHAT WILLHAPPEN IN THE DOMINO EFFECT ON THE FOOD CHAIN?Yes. If the jelly fish are favored, they are going to have to displace something else from thefood web.WHAT EATS JELLY FISH?Sea turtles and big giant sunfish.BUT ALL OF THE GREAT MARINE LIFE THAT WE HAVE DEPENDED UPON FORTHOUSANDS OF YEARS FOR NOT ONLY HUMANS BUT THE WHOLE FOODCHAIN WEB, IT IS GOING TO DECLINE WHILE THINGS LIKE JELLY FISH WILLINCREASE.With what we know now, things don’t look good. We don’t have a sense of how adaptivethe system is. What we don’t know is if the organisms can shift from more soluble forms ofcalcium carbonate shells to less soluble? Or can they live fine with smaller or less massiveshells? Or is there an organism that will take over their spot on the food web that won’tresult in as negative a result as we might think? We don’t have a good handle on thosethings.WE LOSE SALMON AND WE GAIN JELLY FISH!Well, yeah! (laughs) We don’t know exactly how the ecosystem is going to respond. Mostlaboratory studies suggest there will be a negative impact on the food web as we know it.Whether that means that things are going to get a lot worse? Or things are just going to bedifferent but not worse? We just really don’t know yet. No Way to Slow Down Carbonic Acid"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Increase in Oceans?IF I’M UNDERSTANDING YOU, THERE IS NO WAY THAT HUMANS CAN STOPTHE CARBONIC ACID BUILD UP IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN NOW. WE HAVE APROCESS THAT IS GOING TO HAVE TO PLAY ITSELF OUT THROUGH ALL THEUPWELLINGS OF DEEP WATERS FROM THE PAST FIFTY YEARS THAT AREGOING TO BE RELEASING MORE AND MORE CARBON DIOXIDE ANDINCREASING THE OCEAN ACIDITY.That’s true. If we stopped manmade carbon dioxide increase in the atmosphereimmediately, we would find out that the upwelled waters would increase in their acidityfor 50 years – even if we stopped CO2 emissions now.There are a number of suggestions about what to do to mitigate this, such as puttingsodium carbonate into the oceans, which is a basic mineral that could dissolve andneutralize some of the carbonic acid. So, the notion that we can reverse engineer this isprobably a little far fetched right now.WHAT IS THE DOWNSIDE IN TRYING TO NEUTRALIZE THE CARBONIC ACID?Energetically, it’s a very difficult thing to do. If you’re talking about making a lot of sodalime or sodium carbonate, that takes a bunch of energy. If you’re talking about steamingout into the ocean with ships and getting this stuff distributed broadly enough and into theright depths, that takes a bunch of energy. In the process of doing this, you’ve generated alot more carbon dioxide, which is ultimately going to dissolve into the ocean and increasethe acidity.IF THERE ARE 525 BILLION TONS OF ABSORBED GREENHOUSE GASES THATHAVE PRODUCED THE CARBONIC ACID, TO NEUTRALIZE THAT AT CURRENTLEVELS WOULD TAKE A HUGE AMOUNT. SO, WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS WEARE IN A SQUEEZE PLAY WHERE WE’RE TRYING TO SLOW DOWN THERELEASE OF CO2 AND METHANE AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GASES.

That is definitely a concern.THE IMPLICATIONS OF YOUR GEOCHEMISTRY WORK ON THIS CARBONICACID IMPLY THERE WILL BE A LOT OF DEATH AND POSSIBLY EXTINCTIONSOF MARINE LIFE.Well, what we are seeing are conditions in the ocean that people have done laboratorystudies that show negative impacts at these levels of acidity.

We’ve had a lot of publicity about low oxygen regions off our Pacific coast. The reasonyou have low oxygen conditions is because of decomposition of organic matter, whichconsumes oxygen and produces carbon dioxide. That decreases the pH and makes thewaters more corrosive. There have been suggestions that these dead zones off our coastsare actually increasing in frequency and size. Those might be related to changes in windand circulation patterns that might be related to climate change.What’s happening is that dead zones will worsen the ocean acidity problem. If those thingsare becoming more frequent, then the ocean acidity problem is going to become worse.AND THE LESS ABILITY FOR CORALS, OYSTERS, CLAMS, PTEROPODS ANDPLANKTON TO SURVIVE?Exactly.RIGHT NOW IN JUNE 2008, THERE IS A FUTURE POTENTIAL THAT THEINCREASING ACIDIFICATION OF OCEAN WATERS COULD END UP KILLING SOMUCH PLANKTON THAT IT COULD ALSO STARVE A LOT OF LIFE IN THEOCEANS?What will happen is that the food web will change.

The Science journal report by Prof.Burke Hales and NOAA's Christopher Sabine and Richard Feely has stunned many Pacificcoast shellfish farmers, including Brett Bishop, who has been in the shellfish business sinceleaving the U. S. Navy in 1983 to join his family as a fifth generation co-owner of thecompany, Little Skookum Shellfish Growers, in Shelton, Washington. Their specialty israising and wholesaling Manila clams.Manila clams, Little Skookum Shellfish Growers, Shelton, Washington.Brett Bishop, Co-Owner, Little Skookum Shellfish Growers, Shelton, Washington: “When I was made aware of that scientific report that was published in the journal,Science, it caught me by surprise. I was not aware that there was an issue withacidification of ocean water. So, I read the report and realized what a big deal it could beto us and then saw the data on how far ahead of the prediction the acid level was. Whatthey found off the coast of Oregon were levels of acidification that their computer modelshad not predicted to occur for another 50 to 100 years. So, that certainly shook me awakeand got my attention. Frankly, it scares me.Basically the underlying physics is that carbonic acid dissolves calcium carbonate andcalcium carbonate is what the shells of corals, Pteropods, clams and oysters are made of.So, it’s pretty simple. The physics means to me that if a certain level of acidification inseawater reaches my shellfish beds, it could potentially dissolve the shells of my crops(clams) and make it impossible to grow shellfish. That’s what it would mean personally tome. But in a much larger sense, it could mean the collapse of the whole food chain in themarine ecosystem. So, it’s very, very disturbing and troubling.GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF ACIDITY THAT IS THERE RIGHT NOW, IS THEREANYTHING THAT YOU AND OTHERS IN THE SHELLFISH INDUSTRY CAN DO?Right now, I think we are limited to watching and monitoring it. The scale of the problemin ocean upwelling that occurs over hundreds of miles of coastline is just beyond anyremedy that I can think of as far as fixing it. I don’t think flying up and down the coastwith a plane load of baking soda and dumping it into the ocean – I just don’t think that’spractical. So, I think we have to address the problem on the contributing end. In otherwords, what are the things contributing to the problem in the first place?Not being a scientist, what I came away with was the explanation that increased carbondioxide put into the air by industrial uses, the burning of fossil fuels, is what’s creating thisacidification. So, I think the only thing we can do about it is to try to cut off the supply ofatmospheric gases that are contributing to the problem. I don’t think we can do anythingabout the amount of seawater that’s already been acidified. I think we are just going tohave to weather that storm and try to stop feeding the cycle.IF THE ACIDIFICATION IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE INCREASING AMOUNTSOF CARBON DIOXIDE, METHANE AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GASES IN THEATMOSPHERE OF THE EARTH AND WE CAN’T SEPARATE THE TWO –INCREASING ACIDITY OF OCEANS AND INCREASE OF CO2 AND GREENHOUSEGASES, WHERE DO YOU THINK THAT LEAVES YOU AND THE SHELLFISHINDUSTRY?If what you just said is true, that they are linked, that the two are going forward togetherand global warming is part and parcel of ocean acidification, as a shellfish grower I wouldrealize that the first thing we have to do is to convince people to behave differently, tochange their lives so there could be a reduction in greenhouse gases. And hope we couldeducate and persuade before we lose our shellfish farm.But if ocean acidification starts interrupting production of Pteropods and algae and coral,it could be a system-wide crash.

I’m very concerned over that.THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT YOU AND OTHERS WOULD NO LONGER HAVE ANINDUSTRY IN WHICH TO EARN A LIVING?Right, we’d have a very nice piece of beachfront property that used to be a (shellfish)farm. In the meantime, we still have a mortgage that needs to be paid. I have two teenagesons who think they might want to be shellfish growers when they grow up. All of that is atstake.I’m the fifth generation in my family to grow shellfish and live on the old homestead. Ialways took it for granted that if we did our part and farmed industriously and we tookcare of the water quality that the rest would take care of itself. And then I hear this newsabout ocean acidification and what it says to me is that no matter what you do in your ownneighborhood – no matter how hard you try or how good you do it, this problem could justcome in and wipe you out and you would not have a thing to say about it. It’s veryhumbling. It makes me feel at the mercy of forces larger than I can control or evenunderstand.RIGHT. AND MR.
