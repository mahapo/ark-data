June 8, 2008 Timberlake, North Carolina - On June 7, 2008, I received the followingemail from a man who retired from an astrophysics career and is now a semi-retiredtechnology consultant for electronic and electro-optics industries living in Timberlake,North Carolina. Mike Reed once worked at the University of Arizona in Tucson on theMulti-Mirror Telescope (MMT) at Mt. Hopkins, a joint venture with the HarvardSmithsonian Observatory. He had been studying the June 1, 2008, formation in barley atBarbury Castle.Mr. Reed was studying aerial photographs at Earthfiles of an extraordinary crop formationat Barbury Castle in Wiltshire, England, reported June 1st. Here is his email:From: mreed@reedev.comSubject: Barbary Castle Pattern = First ten digits of Pi 3.141592654Date: June 5, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comHello Earthfiles,On looking at the Barbary Castle pattern the ratio of the angles of the radialjumps is apparently the first ten (10) digits of the mathematical constant Pi (the ratio of the of circumference of a circle to the diameter).The dot after the first radial jump is even positioned correctly as the decimalpoint.Take the pattern and draw radial lines from the center of the centraldepression through each radial jump. Take the smallest angle sector and call itone (1), then compare the other ten sectors contained angle to the smallestand pick the closest single digit for the ratio. They come out as 3.141592654.Note that the last ratio digit has even been rounded up to four (4) since thevalue of Pi out to twelve digits is 3.14159265358 and the tenth digit wouldnormally be rounded up to four (4) if the number was only given to ten (10)places.The significance of the three decreasing diameter circles at the end may betrying to convey the the idea that the number goes on indefinitely.I would be interested if there have been any other interpretations."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Cheers,Mike ReedMichael A. Reed, PresidentReed Development Associates Inc.Timbe rla ke , NCWhat Mike Reed calls radial jumps, some of us from long-time crop circle research callratcheted spirals. The most prominent ratcheted spiral was in the 1991 Barbury Castletriangle, one of the best crop formations of all time. Now, it’s seventeen years later back at Barbury Castle and here comes this new pattern infresh young barley that provoked Mike Reed to make a graphic to show how Pi to tendecimal places was precisely indicated in the crop. I interviewed Mike Reed not onlyabout his astonishing discovery, but asked him about the ratcheted spirals drawn in thecomplex diagrams of the 2007 CARET document from the Palo Alto Laboratory that wassent last year as a possible explanation of the aerial dragonfly drone phenomenon. Thatclassified research was leaked by a retired scientist calling himself “Isaac.” CARET is anacronym that stands for Commercial Applications Research for ExtraterrestrialTechnology. Isaac said in the mid-1980s, he worked at the Palo Alto Laboratory oncomplex diagrams related to back-engineering extraterrestrial technology. Ratchetedspirals are in those diagrams – and in the 1991 and 2008 Barbury Castle crop formations.Interview:Michael A. Reed, President, Reed Development Associates, Inc., and formerastrophysicist, University of Arizona, now retired in Timberlake, North Carolina: “Iwas on your Earthfiles website and saw the Barbury Castle photograph and saw thereference to Lucy Pringle as being the one who took the photograph. So, I clicked on theLucy Pringle website and there were more detailed photographs and more from a verticalshot so you could really see the pattern. Then, at the website of Cropcircleconnector.com,there was a clear diagram of the 2008 Barbury Castle pattern by Andreas Mueller, aGerman researcher with Cropcirclescience.org. (See websites below.)In looking at the pattern, the thing that struck me was the little dot right near the beginningof the pattern right outside the central circle. I thought, ‘That’s an odd thing to do. Why?There must be some significance to that dot.Center of June 1, 2008, Barbury Castle barley formation in which the small circleat the beginning of the ratcheted spiral is the decimal point for the Pi number encodedin this crop formation out to ten decimal places: 3.14159265358.Aerial image © 2008 by Lucy Pringle.I noticed that the first segment was longer that the second segment which was muchshorter than the third segment. It just sort of popped into my mind, ‘3.14.’ I thought, ‘Waita minute! I happen to remember Pi to six digits, which is 3.14159 because I use that all thetime in calculations.Then I noticed right where the next segment was, was a short segment again, which mightbe equivalent to 1. But Pi is 3.1415, so the next segment should be longer than theprevious long segment – and it was. I thought, ‘Whoa! This is really beginning to soundlike it matches to Pi.’So, I took the photograph initially and started drawing lines through all the jumps in radii.Well, they start to line up. There are three of them right where the first dot is. If you drawa straight line through that first jump, it goes right through another jump further out and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"another jump on the opposite side.Then I went back and started doing straight lines through the other jumps and I startedtrying to figure out the lengths of the other arcs before the jump – kind of proportional tothe values that you would see in the digits of Pi.Greek symbol for Pi,me a ni ng p e r i me te r .[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - Pi (Greek word for perimeter) is a mathematicalconstant, which represents the ratio of any circle's circumference to itsdiameter in Euclidian geometry, which is the same as the ratio of a circle'sarea to the square of its radius. It is approximately equal to 3.14159, but Pi isan “irrational number” in which the decimal expansion never ends and doesnot repeat. For instance, carried out 50 decimal places Pi equals:3.14159 26535 89793 23846 26433 83279 50288 41971 69399 37510.While the value of pi has been computed to more than a trillion digits,elementary applications, such as calculating the circumference of a circle, willrarely require more than a dozen decimal places. For example, a valuetruncated to 11 decimal places is accurate enough to calculate thecircumference of the earth with a precision of a millimeter, and one truncatedto 39 decimal places is sufficient to compute the circumference of any circlethat fits in the observable universe to a precision comparable to the size of ahydrogen atom.Pi is also a “transcendental number,” which means that no finite sequence ofalgebraic operations on powers, roots, sums could ever produce it.Circumference = π × diameterArea of the circle = π × area of the shaded square 10 “Ratchet Jumps” in 2008 Barbury Castle"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Barbury Castle barley crop formation near Wroughton, Wiltshire, U. K.,reported June 1, 2008, 300 feet in diameter. Aerial image © 2008 by Lucy Pringle.There are a total of 10 jumps (in 2008 Barbury Castle barley formation). So, I had to lookup the value of Pi up to twelve digits, which is 3.14159265358. The ratchet jumps and Pinumbers looked like they began to match, so I sent you a message at Earthfiles to say Ithought there was something here.Then I went back and took the diagram from Andreas Mueller (CropcircleScience.org) andI drew lines through all of the jumps, all the way out past the end of the crop pattern. ThenI started looking at the arcs in the jumps. The first segment equals three of those sections.Diagram of 2008 Barbury Castle formation © 2008 by Andre as Muelle r.What happened was that when I divided the formation up into ten of the jump sections,you get four lines cutting through the circle. So, there is only one line missing. So, I drew aline equi-distant from the other lines. In other words, I divided the circle up into a total of10 sectors. Therefore, each sector is 36 degrees (360 degrees = circle)."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Michael Reed: “This is an update to my previous email earlier today.I have drawn the sequence of arcs that indicate the value of Pi on a diagram preparedby Andreas Muller. It is attached as a PDF file. It clearly shows the progression of digits, whichmake up the first ten (10) digits of the value of Pi. I wonder if any of the previous patterns, whichuse the same method of communication have been analyzed using the same approach?”Spiral ratchet analysis that determines Pi to ten decimals © 2008 by Michael Reed.You look at the first sector and it’s three sectors long.Then there is a decimal point with that little circle.The next segment is one sector long.Then the next segment is four sectors long.The next segment is one sector long.The next segment is 5 sectors long. At that point, it was amazingand I just started following them out. That’s when I made up this diagram to send you.It’s clear as a bell that the crop pattern traces out basically as the first 10 digits of Pi,including the decimal point.The other interesting part was that if Pi carried out 12 numbers is: 3.141592653. Three isthe tenth digit. If you’re going to publish that long number version of Pi, normally youwould round it up, taking into account what the next digit was. The next digit in Pi is 5, sorounding would normally increase the last digit by one. The Mueller diagram shows thatthe 3 has been rounded up in the ratchet pattern to four, which I thought was veryinteresting.But certainly the ratchet design as a way of communicating – for example, you could havetaken the circle and divided it up into 50 segments. As a way of communicating numbers,the ratchet design is a pretty powerful method.This crop pattern happens to be very simple and very obvious in what the circle makershave done. But if that were more tightly packed and had more equivalent segments in it,you could pack a lot of information into that.

Spiral ratchet in foreground.Several people reported seeing mysterious lights over the field the night before.Photograph © 1991 by George Wingfield. DID YOU COMPARE THE 2008 BARBURY CASTLE TO THE 1991 BARBURYCASTLE THAT ALSO HAS A RATCHET DESIGN AS ONE OF ITS APPENDAGESOFF THE TRIANGLE?Yes, I noticed that the ratchets in the 1991 Barbury Castle were all 90-degree angles. Theratchets divided that circle into four segments and each segment is of equal arc length –not of equal radius. Very little information in that design, whereas the current 2008Barbury Castle pattern is quite informative in that it has clearly coded the first 10 digits ofPi.The interesting thing about this one (2008 Barbury Castle) is there is NO possibility ofmisinterpreting this. This is Pi to 10 digits, period.WHY WOULD SOMEBODY DO THIS?Good question. The fact that the Pi decimal point is included (in the 2008 Barbury Castlebarley pattern) and there is rounding up to 10 decimal places is to me a little mindboggling!

The difference in the CARET document has different thickness in the arcs,where there are jumps in radius. And the CARET arcs are a different thickness in90-degree sectors.PERHAPS SUGGESTING MORE MATHEMATICAL INFORMATION EMBEDDED INTHE CARET DOCUMENT DIAGRAMS?Certainly, you could code. There is definitely more information in the varying arcthicknesses than just jumping radius segments. I’ve looked at the CARET documents andthe things are so complex, they are a little mind boggling!

And it’s not a close approximation. It’s absolute. It’s very, very clear when you lookat the drawing of the sectors that these are digits. These are individual digits with very littleerror possibility, so the number that comes out are the first ten digits of Pi.WOULD IT BE FAIR TO SAY THAT SOME INTELLIGENCE MIGHT BE TRYING TOGIVE US A ROSETTA STONE FOR A MATHEMATICAL LANGUAGE THAT HASBEEN ENCODED IN CROP FORMATIONS OVER THE PAST QUARTER CENTURY?If the idea of using the ratcheted spiral radius changes has in fact had previous suchinformation in other crop formations and those have never been interpreted, this 2008Barbury Castle pattern is so essentially simple that it’s probably time to go back and ask,‘Is there some other way of interpreting previous crop formations?’ The ratchet design iscertainly an interesting way to communicate information, which is certainly clear in this2008 Barbury formation.THE RATCHET DESIGN WHICH CAME UP IN BARBURY 1991 AND BARBURY2008 AND IN THE CARET DOCUMENT, THEY ARE ALL THE SAME RATCHETDESIGN.Yes, the CARET document is identical to the 1991, other than the fact that the radial arcsin Barbury 1991 are not thicker and thinner as in the CARET document. The use ofsmaller sectors in angle to communicate a base 10 number set is what is really unique tothe current Barbury Castle pattern.The complexity of the CARET document is so high that it’s very hard to relate – there areso many other symbols relative to the ratchet spiral that there is an awful lot moreinformation there. What it means - who knows? I think I just happen to be the guy thinking about the number ratios because I happen touse the value of Pi a lot in my electronic calculations. So, I have it memorized and as youlook at those sectors, it started to ring a bell and got me going on the analysis.
