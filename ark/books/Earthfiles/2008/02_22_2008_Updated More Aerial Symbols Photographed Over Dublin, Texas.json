Lee Roy has been Constableabout four years and a police officer for seventeen years.

The aerial events started when Lee Roy received a call around 10:30 PM from aresident looking through a telescope between Dublin and Stephenville.Interview:Lee Roy Gaitan, Constable, Erath County Precinct 2, Courthouse Annex,Dublin, Texas, January 31, 2008.

I see it south towardDublin. It looks like an object that is spinning and hovering. Well, that was February 9,2008, OK. Well, that evening at 10:30 PM, I get a phone call from a guy who tells me:‘Lee Roy, that light is back up in the sky. It’s southeast of your house. I’m watching itthrough my telescope.’I bought my wife a pretty nice still camera and we saw it. The light was traveling southeasttowards the little town of Gustine, Texas. We get in the car and travel about 15 miles andmy wife takes some pictures. Did you see the video that David Caron had?THE PROJECTED SYMBOLS?Yeah, where they were bouncing around. That’s what this is with all the different colors.They are green, yellow, white, red and blue.SO, THESE ARE STILL PHOTOS BY YOUR WIFE.Yes, and it’s with a good digital camera.THEY LOOK LIKE COLORED HIEROGLYPHS?Yes. It looks just like what David had. Exactly what is happening in his video is what ishappening in my photos.It is not over. This was about 10:30 PM at night. Then about 11:30 PM – I had been at mysister’s house and I told her about it. She lives in town (Dublin) and they can see this lightfrom town and they are all freaking out. Anyway, around 11:30 PM, my wife and I lostsight of it, but my sister could still see it from town.Well, we come into town and the same guy who called me about the first one calls meagain. He says, ‘Hey, Lee Roy, there is a second one.’ He says it’s coming in from aroundthe Selden, Texas, area coming towards Dublin. And sure enough, there’s another one –same thing.PROJECTING THE SYMBOLS?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Yes. And at one time, we could see both in the sky at the same time. One was in thesoutheast and the other was in the northeast sky. We take pictures of the second one also.There are several eyewitnesses: my sister, her husband, my niece, their neighbor. Anyway,we still don’t know what this is. February 10, 2008, SundayOK, That’s February 9, 2008. Then on February 10, 2008, Sunday - I had to come up hereto Dallas and I forgot my cell phone. The next day, I check it and it was the same guy(with telescope) calling me back about 8:30 PM. He left a message saying, ‘Lee Roy,you’re not going to believe this, but there are five of those lights flying around the Dublinarea.DID THAT GUY GET ANY PHOTOS?No, he did not. He was watching through his telescope. He says he can see a capsule ontop and on the bottom of this round thing and it’s spinning around and bouncing around inthe sky.WHERE IS THE TELESCOPE GUY LIVING?He’s between Dublin and Stephenville somewhere. But I promised him I would not releaseanything (about him) at all. You know what it looks like? Remember the Lite Bright toyswhere you would put pegs in and they would light up different colors?EXACTLY.That’s what it looks like.”Angelia Joiner, Former Reporter,Stephenville Empire-TribuneUpdated February 22, 2008, about Angelia Joiner: As of Tuesday, February19, 2008, Angelia has been hired by KCUB-FM 98.5 radio in Stephenville.

Both her parents had become very ill and shequit teaching to help them. When her father's health improved, Angelia couldn't findanother teaching position, so she hired on at the Stephenville Empire-Tribune.As the New Year of 2008 began, Angelia's reported about all the strange, unidentifiedaerial light activity in the Dublin, Stephenville, Selden region after residents began callingthe newspaper on January 9. That was after nearly forty people saw a variety of differentand colorful aerial lights the night of January 8. One of the January 8 eyewitnesses wasSteve Allen, a long-time pilot and Owner, President and CEO of L & S Enterprises andTexas Freight, a trucking and transportation brokerage company in Glen Rose, Texas,which he founded with his wife, Laquita, in 1994.Steve Allen, Owner, President and CEO, L & S Enterprises and Texas Freight,Glen Rose, Texas, on January 31, 2008. Image © 2008 by Linda Moulton Howe.Steve and two of his friends were on a hill at sunset in Selden when lights arrived in thesky traveling very rapidly, as bright as magnesium welding torches. Those lights keptchanging shapes and eventually turned into “white fire” blazing inside large rectangular“frames” in the sky. See: 020508 Earthfiles. Not long after that, two F-16 jets camescreaming after the aerial lights with their afterburners red hot. Steve told Angelia and methat the strange lights were right in front of him on the Selden hill and then the next instantseemed to be at the far horizon, while the jets tried to catch up. It was “nothing from thisworld,” Steve Allen said.The high strangeness of the Texas events provoked constant phone calls and emails toAngelia Joiner at the Stephenville Empire-Tribune. She wanted to stay on the UFOreports, but newspaper management told her to move on to other local stories.Overwhelmed by the stress of conflicting priorities, on Friday, February 1, Angeliasubmitted her 2-week resignation notice. But the newspaper editor and publisher told herto leave on Thursday, February 7.This week I talked with Angelia Joiner about what she was facing prior to February 1,2008."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Strange aerial phenomena have been concentrated since January 1, 2008, in the trianglularregion of three small Texas towns southwest of Fort Worth.

It’s a very smallnewspaper because this is a small town.YES, I REMEMBER SEEING A POPULATION SIGN WHEN I WAS THERE ATABOUT 15,000.That’s right. The magnitude of the story drained the resources that the newspaper had.Everybody pitched in and tried to help out. But there were hundreds of calls and so manyemails. I had other responsibilities at the paper such as weekend pages. There was a lot ofwork that I was supposed to do that other people ended up helping with and put together.It strained the staff resources there.We did have very good paper sales through the month of January 2008, but one month ofgood sales really does not add more people to your staff. I think all newspapers arestrained in this day and time. Lots of them are pulling back from the areas they cover.Eventually, it was a lot for me and a lot for that newspaper.When I was asked not to report anymore on UFO things, I didn’t have a means toaccomplish that goal. I was still getting a lot of phone calls and emails. So, I tried to directthose to after hours to my home computer. Anyway, I just ended up putting in my notice.Sometimes you try to please everybody and what happens is you don’t please anybody."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"SO ON THE ISSUE: WAS ANGELIA FIRED? OR DID SHE RESIGN? COULD YOUEXPLAIN IN YOUR OWN TERMS WHAT LED UP TO YOUR SUBMITTING YOURRESIGNATION?I turned in my resignation (Friday, February 1, 2008) when I realized my employer wasunhappy with my performance, or at least that was my view.So, a week later (Thursday, February 7, 2008) I go in and they are very upset with me. Idon’t really know what happened, but they had taken my computer and Rolodex. Themanagers said various things. I think they were overwhelmed also and they asked me toleave and I did. It was quite an emotional day for me.WHAT HAPPENED IN THE DAYS RIGHT BEFORE YOU TURNED IN YOURRESIGNATION? DID SOMEBODY COME TO YOU SPECIFICALLY TO SAY: ‘DON’TREPORT ANYMORE ABOUT THE UFO ACTIVITY HERE BECAUSE...?The editor and publisher felt our readership had just grown tired of the stories. They justfelt it was time to move on to a new topic, new local community news, I suppose.BUT IT SEEMED TO ME WHEN I WAS THERE FROM JANUARY 29 TO FEBRUARY1, THERE WAS IN FACT MORE INTENSE INTEREST.I thought there was still a lot of interest, yes, judging from the phone calls and emails therewas still a lot of interest, I would say.IF YOU HAD AGREED TO HELP BY RE-DIRECTING THOSE EMAILS TO YOURHOME COMPUTER AND YOU WERE CONCENTRATING ON COMMUNITYAFFAIRS AGAIN, WHAT WOULD THE PROBLEM HAVE BEEN?Well, I’m not sure. I think they thought I was spending too much of my newspaper timeforwarding emails and trying to answer emails and I was still getting a lot of calls. So, theyjust felt I was not following their directions, I guess, because I didn’t drop it entirely. Ididn’t really say, ‘OK, I’ll try to do this after hours. But, if I had a meeting after hours, Idid not try to hide that. They knew where I was going for dinner to meet with this personand that sort of thing. It’s just hard to explain. Outside Political Pressure?STEVE ALLEN, RICKY SORRELLS, LEE ROY GAITAN AND POLICE OFFICERSWHO REMAIN UNNAMED, ALL DESCRIBED HAVING PHONE CALLS THATWERE BASICALLY INTIMIDATING OR TRYING TO PERSUADE THEM THATSOMETHING MILITARY AND NATURAL WAS GOING ON AND THEY FELT LIKEPRESSURE WAS BEING PUT ON THEM INDIVIDUALLY.DO YOU THINK IT’S POSSIBLE THAT SOME AUTHORITY IN OUR GOVERNMENTWAS PUTTING PRESSURE ON THE PUBLISHER OF THE STEPHENVILLENEW SPAP E R?No, I don’t think that at all. I don’t believe anybody military contacted them. If that hadbeen the case, they would have pulled me aside and said, ‘This is what’s happened.’Whenever you work in a small workplace that has very few employees, you know thepeople year round pretty well. If someone has pressured them, I believe they would havetold me that. I just believe it was in their judgment that there was enough of the UFO stuffand let’s go on.YOU TURNED IN YOUR LETTER OF RESIGNATION ON FEBRUARY 1, BECAUSEYOU FELT OVERWHELMED?I didn’t feel like I could please anybody. I was being pulled in a lot of directions and Ididn’t feel they were happy with my performance. So, I thought it might be the best thingat the time would be to end the relationship.SO, YOU WERE DOING THE RESIGNATION ON YOUR OWN VOLITION?Yes. Nobody threatened me. Nobody contacted me, like anyone I thought was militaryasking me to drop the stories. That did not happen.WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED BETWEEN FEBRUARY 1ST AND 7TH, THEFIRST WEEK OF YOUR 2-WEEK NOTICE OF RESIGNATION, THAT WOULD HAVEPROVOKED THE OWNERS OF THE NEWSPAPER TO BE AGGRESSIVE WITH YOUON FEBRUARY 7?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I suppose because they saw the number of emails that I was getting and because they felt Iwas spending too much of their newspaper time on UFO things still.WHAT IS YOUR PERSPECTIVE?Well, I honestly tried to honor their wishes. I did not want to give up the investigations onthe UFOs. I did not want to abandon those eyewitnesses. I tried to honor the newspaper’swishes by directing the attention to after-hours and to my home. Apparently that was notthe right thing to do in their eyes. I just really think the whole thing is unfortunate. New Website to Report MysteriousPhenomena in Dublin and Stephenville RegionWHAT DO YOU THINK YOU’RE GOING TO DO NEXT?(big laugh) I wish I knew! I’ve already done some freelance things. And now there is thewebsite, www.stephenvillelights.com (Angelia has written the first web article andhopefully will be doing more reporting if the phenomena continues in the region.)HAVE YOU SEEN ANYTHING HIGHLY UNUSUAL IN THE SKY YOURSELF?No, I have not. (laughs) I do look up at the sky a lot more now. I am more observant, butthe way it has turned the witnesses, just rocked their world, turned their world upsidedown, I’m not sure I want to see it.THE VIDEO THAT IMPRESSED ME THE MOST IN TERMS OF AN AERIAL OBJECTWAS THE PROJECTION OF THE SYMBOLS THAT DAVID CARON TOOK NEARTHE STEPHENVILLE AIRPORT.Yes, I interviewed him and saw that video also.I WONDERED WHAT YOU THOUGHT OF THE VIDEO FROM YOUR OWN EYES,HAVING INTERVIEWED A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE?I’ve never seen anything like that. Of course, you have to recognize that I’m new to theUFO world. I was really impressed with that video. It’s really not explainable, I don’tbelieve. When I talked with David Caron, he even showed me, ‘Here’s how I put thecamera up against the pole on my front porch to try to keep it steady.’ He seemedcompletely amazed by it also.I watched it all the way through two times. It seemed like the background noise from thetraffic – he lives on a fairly busy little road and it’s a paved road. All that backgroundnoise seemed constant (on the video) and the talk between him and the man that was thereat the time. It was just so unusual to see lights dance around like that in the sky. One ofthem said, ‘It almost looks like hieroglyphics.’ And I thought it does. I thought it wasunusual, too, because the thing does not just like curve – it makes 90-degree angles,40-degree angles, then it will have curvy spots in it.WITH ALL THOSE DIFFERENT COLORS, ALMOST STRIPED AND SPECKLED.Right! And it was so brilliantly colored – very bright, intense colors. I could not decide ifthis is something moving and it’s streaking like that? Or is this actually what you see? Canyou not keep up with it with your naked eye? I don’t know.IT APPEARS TO BE PROJECTIONS EVERY 15 FRAMES, WHICH IS A HALFSECOND. EVERY HALF A SECOND, EACH OF THOSE HIEROGLYPHS ORSYMBOLS IS CHANGING TO A NEW ONE.Yes, it is sort of a pulsating effect.WELL, I’M WITH YOU IN NEVER HAVING SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THATPARTICULAR PROJECTION BEFORE. I’VE RECEIVED A LOT OF EMAILS SAYINGIT COULD BE A JVC CAMERA GONE HAYWIRE.UNTIL I TALKED WITH LEE ROY GAITAN LAST NIGHT. NOW HIS WIFE HASTAKEN PHOTOGRAPHS THAT APPEAR TO BE EXACTLY THE SAME THING.Yes, I’ve seen his pictures and they do look the same."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Restricted Air Space Over Bush RanchNot Far from StephenvilleI GOT AN AVIATION MAP OF RESTRICTED MAPS AROUND THE GLEN ROSE,STEPHENVILLE, DUBLIN REGION. HERE IS A BIG WHITE CIRCLE OF THE BUSHCRAWFORD COMPOUND IN THE MIDDLE. THE COMPOUND IS NOT MORETHAN 60 MILES AWAY FROM MOST OF THE LOCATIONS WHERE THEPHENOMENA HAVE BEEN SEEN, VIDEOTAPED OR PHOTOGRAPHED.HAVE YOU HAD ANYBODY SPECULATE OR SUGGEST TO YOU THAT THEAERIAL PHENOMENON COULD BE FLAUNTING ITSELF BECAUSE OF THECRAWFORD/BUSH COMPOUND PROXIMITY?Well, more than flaunting itself – not really going in that direction. But I have hadcomments on the two F-16s that Steve Allen saw that seemed to be in pursuit of the thingthat came over the second time. Some people are speculating that the object crossed theCrawford air space, which is the reason those jets scrambled after it. Other than that, Idon’t have any more information.IT’S CLEAR TO EVERYONE, INCLUDING PILOTS, WHAT A PHONY EXCUSETHAT WAS DAYS AFTER JANUARY 8, FOR THE MILITARY TO BE TRYING TOBLAME ALL THE EYEWITNESSES FROM JANUARY 1 INTO LATE JANUARY ONTEN F-16S IN A TWO HOUR PERIOD BETWEEN 6 AND 8 PM ONLY ON JANUARY8.When I did the first story, I immediately began making phone calls to the military bases Ithought would be relevant. That’s when I got in touch with Major Lewis at the Naval AirStation in Fort Worth. It used to be called Carswell AFB. He was very nice and said, ‘Letme see what I can find out for you. Did we have jets in the area because I was relating thestory of the two F-16s that were in pursuit of the big object, according to Steve Allen.Major Lewis did call me back the next day and said, ‘There could have been jets fromsome other base, but they were not ours.’Then the next thing I know is two weeks later, I’m getting a call for a radio interviewabout the USAF backtracking on their statement. That was the first I heard of it. He didnot send me the press release or call me. So, I called him. His demeanor had absolutelychanged. It was quite clear that he was probably reading something over the phone to me.I feel like possibly he was reprimanded because all he could do was say, ‘Miss Joiner, atthis time all I can say is ...’ and he would read.Now, the thing that really kind of jumped out at me is in the military press release that saysthat military operating area is over Erath County. Boy, it didn’t take very long for me toget phone calls from pilots in the area and people coming to me, spreading out theiraeronautical maps and saying, ‘No, we are not in that Brownwood MOA. We’re way over"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"here.’ And they would point at the map. So, maybe that was a mistake in the military pressrelease. I’m not really sure.BUT YOUR POINT IS THAT WHEN YOU FIRST CALLED MAJOR LEWIS SOONAFTER THE JANUARY 8 EVENING WHEN SO MANY PEOPLE SAW THE LIGHTSAND STARTED CALLING YOU AT THE NEWSPAPER ON THE NEXT DAY, THATYOU WERE ABLE TO TALK TO THE NAVAL OFFICER AND TO TALK IN ACONVERSATIONAL WAY ABOUT WHAT COULD BE HAPPENING?Right. And he was just a regular guy. Real friendly. Very congenial. And it would be justlike me talking to you. It was not scripted, or anything like that (in the first phoneconversation).BUT, BY THE THIRD WEEK IN JANUARY OR THEREABOUTS, HE WAS VERYSTIFF AND FORMAL WITH YOU AND READING A PREPARED STATEMENT ONTHE PHONE.That’s what it sounded like. I think he was reading and he was a lot more cautious. Hisdemeanor had just completely changed.DID YOU ASK, ‘SIR, OFF THE RECORD, CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT KIND OFPRESSURE HAVE YOU HAD FROM HIGHER AUTHORITIES TO SHUT THIS STORYUP ?I did try to go in that direction, but he would still just say, ‘Miss Joiner, all I can say isthis...’ So, I could see that something had changed. He certainly was not the same guy thatI had spoken with a couple of weeks before.”Excerpt of Angelia Joiner's reporting summarized inAssociated Press wire story distributed nationally on January 15, 2008.More Information:For further information about Texas unidentified aerial phenomena, please see relatedEarthfiles reports:For other related Earthfiles reports, please see:• 02/22/2008 — Updated: More Aerial “Symbols” Photographed OverDublin, Texas Reporter Angelia Joiner Resigned from Newspaper.• 02/20/2008 — Updated Part 1: Viewer Comments About Aerial Flamesand “Symbols” Over Dublin and Stephenville, Texas• 02/06/2008 — Updated 02-14-08: Mysterious Symbols Projected inNight Sky by Aerial Disc Near Stephenville, Texas, Local Airport• 02/08/2008 — Law Officers Describe Unidentified Shape-Shifting AerialCraft in Stephenville, Texas, Region• 02/22/2008 — Updated: Three Eyewitnesses in Selden, Texas, Saw Two,Large Rectangles of “White Flames” in Sky Infrared Deer CameraAnomalies.• 01/28/2008 — Updated 01-28-08: Viewer Letters About Aerial Craftand Military Flyovers Above Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas• 01/18/2008 — Updated with graphic: Huge Aerial Craft Over Dublin,Texas, “Longer Than 3 Football Fields”"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Websites:Stephenville Lights: http://www.stephenvillelights.com Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
