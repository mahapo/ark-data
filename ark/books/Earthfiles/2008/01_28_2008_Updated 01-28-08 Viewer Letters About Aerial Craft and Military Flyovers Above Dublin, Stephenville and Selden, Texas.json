In nature, this field is unobserved because the ions are randomly arranged, thus causingtheir tiny gravito-electric fields to cancel out one another. In a Bose-Einstein condensate, whereall ions behave as one, something very different occurs.Spinning ions - that' s what my email below is about (see red text).I think I can explain what those cone-shaped holes and mirage heat waves are, but first let tellyou a little about myself. I'm 30 now. When I was about 18, I saw a strange light in the sky thatlooked like a red ball of light. As I was looking, it shot out of sight in the blink of an eye. Thefirst question I asked myself was not \"What was that?\" I asked, \"How?\"Sense then in my spare time, I've researched the how question. Without getting too technical, Icame to conclusion that an electromagnetic field can cause an antigravity effect IF the fields areshaped properly. There are actually two fields that need to be shaped properly. The electricalfield and the magnetic field.The electrical field has to be shaped like a tornado or a vortex. The magnetic field has to beshaped like a donut. If you can make a device that can create the electrical vortex, then theelectrical field will cause the magnetic field to take the donut shape. The same is true the otherway around. If you had a device that can make a donut-shaped magnetic field, it will build theelectrical field in a vortex shape. These shaped fields cancels gravity.Another thing to mention that might explain what Ricky Sorrells saw. It's known for a fact thatgravity bends lights. It's part of the theory of relativity that gravity can slow down time and causemass to change. These are relativity facts.Now, we can explain Ricky's drawing. Each cone-shaped indention is a device that creates anelectrical vortex (sometime called a plasma or ion vortex), and like a tornado with multiplevortexes, they all the add up to cause one big vortex around the craft. That big vortex causes alarge donut-shaped field around the craft. Within this donut shaped magnetic field, magnetic fluxlines are created in a little different shape than normal matter. Flux line are the force lines inmagnetic fields. You can see these flux lines if you sprinkle metal shaving over a piece of paperwith a magnet under it. Flux lines are always curved, except in the center of a donut-shapedfield.Now, a craft using fields as described are subject to some side effects. Because atoms vibratedifferently depending on gravity, a craft with a cancelling-gravity- effect will cause atoms tovibrate faster and make time seem faster (within the center). Or if you're on the edge of donut-shaped field like this, you'll be in a place were gravity is a little stronger then normal and timewould seem slower. So think that if you walked up to a running craft, as you get closer to themagnetic field your watch would slow down. Once you entered the field and started to walktoward the center, your watch will start speeding up again until you get to the center. At thatpoint, your watch will be running much faster then someone else's watch on the outside of thefield. With time dilation comes length contraction. This explains why people see various craft as"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"different sizes. The eyewitnesses are really seeing the craft's field changing and its time dilationfactor changing.As far as different lights around the craft - the color, size, and shape of the lights will depend onwhere you are in relationship to the craft, time of day, strength of field, and condition in theenvironment. Ionized air normally produces a blue hue like lightening. This is because most ofthe light emitted by ionized air is UV light, but some radiation is also in the visible spectrum.Water vapor in the air will split the UV light and other light into different colors. Kind of likehow water vapor splits white light into a rainbow. The field will be more visible at night andmight be drowned out completely during the day and the sun's light. Also, if you could see thefields around the craft, it would be like looking through a wavy pool of water. Light bends inwater. If you look at something like a vent at the bottom of swimming pools, you see that it notclear, but seems to dance around. Same thing with light coming off a craft such as this, but a littlebit more intense. Subject: Stephenville UFODate: January 23, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comI'm sure my info will be of little help, but I will add to your mountain of emails. I live on the SWside of Benbrook Lake which is SW of Fort Worth. This also happens to be south of theLockhead Martin / Joint Reserve base on Lake Worth. I am in the direct flight path of the F-16'sand C-130's (or are they C-140's?) that fly in and out every day, and I work from home so I amhere most of the time and pretty much know the basic routines.Although these guys don't have an exact schedule, I can tell when something is up by the waythey fly out of the base. On the afternoon of 9/11 when there was no air traffic and the skieswere calm, there were at least 3 jets that “screamed” out of the base flying over my house. Icouldn't see the afterburners, but they were in an extreme hurry flying very low and very fast.Normally it seems they take a higher altitude when doing routine flights in and out.Anyway, the reason for the observation is this:On Tuesday, Jan.15, 2008, a friend of mine was stopping by so I was outside waiting for her. Atabout 6:45 or 7pm (after sunset), I counted 5 jets (F-16's? couldn't see them, only their lights) flydirectly over my house heading SW very low and very fast. It reminded me of 9/11. These guyswere definitely on a mission. I was very surprised because it is very unusual for them to take offlike that after dark. I called my sister who lives 1/2 mile west of the base and she said she heardthem, too, and that they also did the same thing on the previous Sunday Jan. 13, 2008. I was nothome that night, so I missed it.At the time, I was unaware of any (UFO) sightings. I don't know if these dates will help withyour investigation or not, but I hope so. January 22, 2008 Fort Worth, Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas - The first week of January 2008,came with shocks for at least three dozen people living in Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas, southwestof Fort Worth. The shocks ranged from yellow, red, blue and white lights that showed up after sunset – lightsso bright that eyewitnesses compared them to a welder’s torch. There were also three daylight sightings bymetal welder and machinist, Ricky Sorrells, within the first week and a half of 2008. His closest sightingabout 300 feet above the woods on his property was of an aerial craft “at least three football field long (about1,000 feet).” See: 011808 Earthfiles.1) Subject: Air Force JetsDate: January 19, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comLinda,On Tuesday January 1, 2008, above Fort Worth, about 09:00 AM to 12:00 PM, we had somecrazy flyovers of F-18s, B1s, B2s, F-22s, and the new raptor jet. Flying very much like a searchpattern for something on the ground or in the air. Just East of I-35W and North to South ofI-20/820 East. It got my attention while I was on the computer checking on my emails for theday, when these jets flew so close that I could look up and see the outline of the wheel wells,about 700 feet off the ground. Next door neighbor also noticed the flight pattern and came out totalk about what might be going on at this time. Being a security officer at one time in my lifecame in handy about distance and type of equipment, whatever it might be!Sincerely,Bill Florin Jr. 2) Subject: 1/2 Mile Wide Nothing UnusualDate: January 19, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comMy name is Andrea. I am from South America (Colombia). I am a graphic designer and a visualdesigner. For 9 years I have studied human perception; therefore, I am a very visual person.YES! It is true that big unimaginable super size UFOs exist. In 1998, I saw an enormous"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"mother-ship over the city of Pereira, Colombia.I was in a bus coming from Cartago, a small town in the South. The bus driver did stop the car onthe top of a mountain. It is possible to see the city of Pereira at the bottom of the mountains. Thetime was 11 PM or 12 midnight. The bus driver was in trouble by what he was seeing, so hemade all the occupants of the bus - 10 or more people - get out the bus and confirm for him whathe was seeing: an enormous ship that covered the majority of the city. It was static over Pereira,Colombia, without a sound with green, orange, red, and yellow lights. It was not a product of thebus driver's imagination.It was not the first time I did see a UFO. When I was a young child, my father took me hikingover the Andes mountains and we saw so many UFOs, 3 at once, so close that we could touchthem if we wanted to, but we were so disconcerted by the flying discs that we could not react.They came so close like they were observing us as we were a curiosity.Going back to the 1/2-mile-long ship. I did find other person who saw the same mother-ship overthe city of Pereira, but in another date. This person wrote a report on http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/005/S05700.html .Thank you for caring about Mother earth and the environment. I do appreciate your work andintelligence. My best thoughts are with you. 3) Subject: Texas Jets Could Be ClueDate: January 19, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comIf the witness was sure of I.D. of jet fighters being F-16 or F-15, they are Air Force fighters andmostly didn't come from Navy air base - unless it was secret special Air Force temporary deployto Naval air base to observe UFOs. If Air Force F-16 didn't come from Navy air base, this meangovernment has been tracking and chasing UFOs from a far distant base. Navy fighters are F-18and F-14. This could aid in tracking the base these fighters came from. I believe it is a top secretair unit to chase and observe UFOs, not regular Air Force or Navy, which both can say they haveno planes in the air. 4) Subject: UFO over Aledo, TexasDate: January 19, 2008 2:01:01 AM MSTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comMy (January 1, or 2, 2008) sighting was something I’d never seen before. I live in a little towncalled Annetta. Our address is Aledo, Texas, probably because that’s where the post office is andit is about 3 miles or more away. We are about 10 miles east of Weatherford and 25 miles fromdowntown Fort Worth. I was outside of our house looking west toward Weatherford. Directlybehind our house are acres of ranch land.It was about 7 PM and a light caught my attention. I looked up thru a hazy winter night sky tosee a bright light about the size of a quarter at arm’s length. It was moving west towardStephenville. It was too fast for a balloon. It was completely silent, had no flashing red light likean aircraft has and it didn’t break up or go out like a flare or fireworks do. It suddenly shot out ofsight over the horizon as it got close to the tree line from my line of sight and was gone in ahurry. It didn’t disappear as a firework would, but traveled away over the horizon and was gone.It didn’t fit a flare, aircraft, helicopter, fireworks or comet because of the silence, speed andchange of direction of flight. This occurred on the night of about January 1st or 2nd.That is my story. Maybe not very dramatic compared to other experiences but it was a littleunnerving to me and scary. I didn’t see a ship or anything but the light. 5) Subject: Texas SightingDate: January 19, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comThanks for the report on the sighting in Texas by Mr. Sorrells. Truly amazing. It seems to mefrom his description, that he is detailing an image of a giant “ flat screen” display or a projectiondevice. I would equate the circle in a circle (reminiscent of Ezekiel), with a conical lens residingin the larger depression becoming something akin to a pixel. With the “ pixels” being distributedequally over the flat surface to form a viewing or projection surface. Of course, the neutral flatgray of the ship would provide the perfect background color, similar to an aluminum grayprojection screen. And judging from the estimated size of the craft - “three football fields”estimated by Ricky Sorrells - or a mile by a half a mile estimated by the pilot's sighting (close toour present day 16:9 display format), and the distance of 40 feet between the circles on the grid,the intended view would be from thousands of feet.The lights described in the night sightings and the basic geometric figures being shown wouldseem to indicate someone looking for ground reports on their light “ convergence” test. Similar toadjusting your TV and asking someone across the room, “How is it now?”"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"If terrestrial, I would believe our government would never risk exposure of such a technologyunless it was about to be used. What would be its use? I would guess for communications with apopulous “off the grid” from some catastrophic event, which negated conventionalcommunications.If extraterrestrial, I would think the sighting could be used for attuning the population to somesoon-to-occur event, such as a first contact.It would make sense that a first contact would be by a visual display that could not begovernment-controlled or censored. This could give us physical characteristics of the species,views of a home planet, a history, and of course, INTENTIONS. All this acclimation, withoutactual physical interaction, and the possibility of a negative response from the militaries of theworld. Of course, the other side of the equation, a device so large it could display an illusionevent over an entire city.Frankly, I have no idea and am just responding with my personal interpretations. However, Iwould say this, if these sightings are true and correct, whatever the purpose of this machine,whether for help or hurt, things don't appear to bode well for our immediate future. 6) Subject: Texas Sightings from Mesa, Arizona, ResidentDate: January 22, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comMy boyfriend has finally convinced me to write to you about my experience with the UFO seenaround the 8th of Jan, after listening to you on Coast to Coast. I listened and read your interviewwith Ricky Sorrells. I am still not sure what I saw; I will do my best to describe it.It was probably about 9:30 PM and I was out in my backyard just looking around. We own 2telescopes so we spend a lot of time looking up. At first, when I saw the blinking red light, Ithought it was an airplane (it was high up in the sky and had a blinking red light). But afterwatching it for a few minutes, I realized it was not an airplane. Then thought maybe a satellite.But it didn't fly in a straight line. And then the light turned white and was blinking, then strobing,then it would stop. It continually changed between red and white and was erratic. It would blinkfast, then slow, sometimes it would stay solid. And it did not fly in a straight pattern. There weretimes when the lights would stop and when they started again, it was in a different position, butnot in the spot you would think it would be. It moved diagonally, then straight. It would stop fora few seconds, then move really fast a short distance. I watched this object for about 10 mins,thinking this was the craziest thing I have ever seen.I had told my boyfriend about it, but didn't think too much of it until I read about others seeing itonline. Then he had me listen to Coast to Coast and go to your Earthfiles.com website to readabout what had been seen. All I know is what I saw was something I have never seen before.This week, on Wednesday, January 16, Ricky called me to say there had been more low-flying jet andhelicopter traffic over his Dublin property. While he was talking, another jet flew over so loud and so lowthat he stopped talking on his cell phone.Maj. Karl Lewis, a spokesman for the 301st Fighter Wing at the Joint Reserve Base Naval Air Station in FortWorth, told Reporter Angela Brown at the Stephenville Empire-Tribune that “no F-16s or other aircraft fromhis base were in the area the night of January 8, 2008, when most people reported the light sightings.” Partial List of Military Bases inFort Worth, Texas, RegionBrooks AFB, San Antonio, TexasDyess AFB, Abilene, TexasFort Bliss, Fort Bliss, TexasFort Hood, Killeen, TexasFort Sam Houston, San Antonio, TexasGoodfellow AFB, San Angelo, TexasKelly AFB, San Antonio, TexasLackland AFB, San Antonio, TexasLaughlin AFB, Del Rio, TexasNaval Air Station (NAS), Corpus Christi, Corpus Christi, TexasNaval Air Station, Joint Reserve Base (NAS JRB) Fort Worth, TexasNaval Air Station, Kingsville, TexasNaval Station Ingleside, Ingleside, TexasRandolph AFB, San Antonio, TexasRed River Army Depot, TexarkanaSheppard AFB, Wichita Falls, TexasFor other related Earthfiles reports, please see:• 02/14/2008 — More Aerial “Symbols” Photographed Over Dublin, Texas"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"• 02/06/2008 — Updated 02-14-08: Mysterious Symbols Projected in Night Sky by AerialDisc Near Stephenville, Texas, Local Airport• 02/08/2008 — Law Officers Describe Unidentified Shape-Shifting Aerial Craft inStephenville, Texas, Region• 02/05/2008 — Three Eyewitnesses in Selden, Texas, Saw Two, Large Rectangles of “WhiteFlames” in Sky• 01/28/2008 — Updated 01-28-08: Viewer Letters About Aerial Craft and MilitaryFlyovers Above Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas• 01/18/2008 — Updated with graphic: Huge Aerial Craft Over Dublin, Texas, “LongerThan 3 Football Fields” More Information:For further reports about unidentified aerial objects, please see my documentaries, A Strange Harvest andStrange Harvests 1993; also my books An Alien Harvest; Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles; and 2-VolumeGlimpses of Other Realities in the Earthfiles Shop.
