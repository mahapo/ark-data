The caller thought I should talk with the son-in-law tosee if I could speak with the 62-year-old father-in-law living in the southeastern UnitedStates whose health was deteriorating.After a lengthy discussion with the son-in-law, S. D., about my investigative journalismcareer as a TV producer, documentary filmmaker, radio reporter and writer concerningsubjects ranging from science and environment to earth mysteries that include the UFOphenomenon, S. D. said he would talk with his father-in-law and let me know if I couldtalk with him – either on or off the record. I assured S. D. that I was willing to speak withhis father-in-law in complete confidence, if necessary.S. D. called back and gave me his father-in-law’s home number. On May 2, 1998, I dialedthe number of the former CIA and U. S. Army analyst who I will call Stein.The first phone conversation had more surprising details than I expected and I asked Steinif I could record-by-phone, without using his real name, so I could share his allegedexperiences with the public on Dreamland and Coast to Coast AM, then hosted by ArtBell. Stein said as long as I didn’t reveal his name and current geographical location or thespecific military base in which he and others analyzed UFO photographs and film thatincluded autopsies of non-human beings, he would talk because he did not know howmuch longer he would be alive. But he did not want his surviving family to be jeopardized,so he wanted complete anonymity. Unfortunately, requests for anonymity have been toocommon in my long-time efforts to understand what the U.S. government knows about theagendas and interactions of non-human intelligences with planet Earth. It’s myunderstanding there has been a policy of strict denial in the interest of national securitysince 1947, after President Harry S. Truman signed a classified executive order to keep thepublic and media ignorant.In 1998, with his permission, I did share some excerpts of a phone-recorded interview withStein. But soon after our first discussion, Stein received a tip from a long-time friend of hiswho worked for the phone company in his home town. The friend told Stein that his phonewas tapped and wondered why, since Stein was retired and very ill.Stein let me know the situation and agreed that I could visit him at his home and record hisstory. Even that secret effort backfired on Stein in a surprising and disturbing way thatended our discussions, but not before I had recorded many hours of his story.Now, it is ten years later in August 2008, and I begin the following Real X-Files series ofStein's assertions that I cannot prove, but in the wake of Jim Marrs's latest book, Rise ofthe Fourth Reich, I think Stein's comments are valuable to share as alleged firsthandaccounts of 1950s CIA operations concerning extraterrestrial biological entities and theiradvanced technologies.Phone Interview # 1May 2, 1998Linda Moulton Howe: “PLEASE TELL ME IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY THATYOU WORKED FOR THE CIA BETWEEN 1957 AND 1960 ON TOP SECRET BLUEBOOK CASES FUNNELED TO THE CIA AND NOT TO THE PHONY PUBLIC BLUE"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"BOOK VERSION?Stein: “Yes, to me and my boss. It usually came directly to me.[ Editor's Note: Beginning in 1952, there was a public, misinforming U. S. AirForce Project Blue Book to explain away UFOs. Simultaneously, there was ahighly classified CIA Project Blue Book focused on actual non-humans andtheir advanced technologies. The public Project Blue Book was ended in1969. Both Project Blue Books had similar goals: to determine if UFOs were athreat to national security and to scientifically analyze UFO-related data.Some evidence suggests that the USAF continued to collect and study UFOreports after the public Project Blue Book ended, despite official claims to thecontrary.]WHO WAS YOUR BOSS?Anthony Barden was the name he used in the CIA.IS HE STILL ALIVE?No, in the late 1950s when I was working for him, he was in his sixties then.

S., the CIA had the country divided upfour ways. We also had an overseas administrative person as well as a European head.And, of course, we had spies in Russia and so on.DID YOU EVER SEE OR HEAR THE WORDS MAJESTIC 12, MAJIC OR MJ-12?That sounds familiar to the paperwork I read.DO YOU REMEMBER IN THE 1950S DOCUMENTS AND PHOTOGRAPHS YOURECEIVED CONCERNING UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTS, DID YOUR FILESINCLUDE UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS?No, nothing about animal deaths in the Blue Book files funneled to me and my boss. Whatdid stand out in the classified documents I saw was about a UFO crash on a ranch in NewMexico in 1947. The document said that it was a German-built saucer that had alienhieroglyphics on the outside and inside. They found out it was German when they didreverse engineering on it. There was something in the craft that linked to being built byNazi Germany in 1938, I think. But, there were also aliens on board. One was still alive,one was dying and, I think, one or two were dead.DID THEY HAVE PHOTOGRAPHS OF THOSE BEINGS?I saw photographs in our classified work at the military base in the southeast. But also, Ihad a TOP SECRET White House clearance and when I was in Washington, D. C. at CIAheadquarters, if I had time I would go into the library and read up on a lot of those things. Iused my security card to zip through the lock and go right in. That's where I read about theNazi Germany saucer constructions.DID THE REPORT ABOUT THE NEW MEXICO CRASH DESCRIBE THE BEINGS?Yes, it did. You probably saw the film of the alien autopsy that came out in the past fiveyears or so.[ Editor's Note: In 1995, British producer, Ray Santilli, publicly announced hehad purchased from the original military cameraman some autopsy footage oftwo 6-fingered, non-human entities retrieved from a crashed UFO that Santillisaid the cameraman dated between May 31 to June 2, 1947, which allegedlywas a recovery operation at a crash site southwest of Socorro, New Mexico,near the Plains of San Augustin (west of Roswell and not between Corona andRoswell - an example of the persistent confusion about geographic locationsand timelines for UFO crashes, which results from deliberate governmentinsider efforts to hide UFO crash dates and locations). Santilli first presentedhis film to an invited audience of media representatives, UFOlogists, and otherdignitaries at the Museum of London on May 5, 1995.

Photograph from16mm film © 1996 by Orbital Media Ltd.YOU READ ABOUT THE HAND-IMPRINTED PANELS IN THE 1950S?Yes, I did. The CIA report also said there were ‘alien hieroglyphics.’DID THE CIA REPORT GO INTO WHY THE 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS WOULDBE INSIDE A CRAFT THAT WAS ALLEGEDLY MADE IN GERMANY IN 1938?No, but I heard other information about the Germans in 1917 and 1927 when they hadtheir first saucer vehicle that could be flown. The Germans had supposedly contactedaliens at the time through two mediums they had working with them. It was the VrilSociety that worked on the original prototype model they made and flew. [ See 081208Earthfiles about Nazi Die Glocke.]WHAT WAS THE VRIL SOCIETY?It’s a pretty old society in Germany. I believe my grandfather belonged to it in the 1800s.We came from Germany and were part of the royal family over there at that time.Vril was a society that had different goals at different times. In the 1800s, Vril was lookingat various industrial projects and engines. In 1917, the Vril had a big meeting and decided at that time to go into alternate power sources.DO YOU HAVE ANY KNOWLEDGE THAT THE VRIL INSPIRATION FOR THE DISKCRAFT CAME FROM WORKING DIRECTLY WITH THE 6-FINGERED EXTRATERRESTRIALS?Yes, if I remember correctly, when Vril was building that first craft, the Vril had one or twoof the aliens that worked with them in Germany where they fired rockets fromPeenemunde. The documents I read in Washington said that’s where the first Vril vehiclewas made.HAS ANY DOCUMENT OR SOURCE YOU’VE BEEN EXPOSED TO INDICATEDWHAT THE RELATIONSHIP WAS BETWEEN THE 6-FINGERED BEINGS AND OURCIVILIZATION AND HOW FAR BACK IT GOES?I did not read any history like that back in the 1950s.DID THE DOCUMENTS EVER GIVE ANY INDICATION ABOUT THE ORIGIN OFTHE 6-FINGERED TYPES?What I read about the Roswell situation, apparently those 6-fingered aliens were supposedto be from two planets orbiting Aldebaran, the biggest star in the constellation Taurus.DID YOU EVER SEE ANY REFERENCE TO ZETA RETICULI 1 AND 2?No, I don’t recall, but it’s over forty years ago."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"IF YOU WERE IN THE CIA AND WERE READING REPORTS, INCLUDING ONEABOUT A NEW MEXICO CRASH IN 1947 THAT INVOLVED THE 6-FINGEREDBEINGS AND THE CRAFT WAS TRACED BACK TO GERMAN CONSTRUCTION IN1938 UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF THOSE BEINGS, DID YOU EVER HAVE ANYFIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE ABOUT OUR GOVERNMENT CONTACTINGGERMANS TO DISCUSS THE E.

But, I know we ran across the saucers and their beings in 1948.WHERE?Apparently, we (American OSS and British MI-5 and MI-6) learned that the Germans in1938 moved all the saucer crafts they had underground in Germany to Argentina andAntarctica.”Nazis raise the swastika flag in 1938 to mark the territory ofNeu-Schabenland occupied by Germany in Antarctica.

It was after the end of WWIIthat we had the altercation. The British had come up with photographs of the saucer craftin the 1930s, and so we knew Germany had the saucer craft with ‘laser guns’ on them.Hitler actually sent out all the craft that they had to Argentina and Antarctica apparentlyto make sure when he started WWII none of them would be captured. Hitler alwaysmentioned his top secret weapons and everyone thought it was the V-2 rockets. But itappears the V-2 rockets were only a side show to the saucer technology being developed.BUT IF HITLER WAS DESPERATE TO WIN AND TAKE OVER THE WORLD, WHYWOULDN’T HE HAVE USED THOSE DISCS?It had something to do with those 6-fingered entities retrieved from the 1947 crash aroundRoswell.There was another kind of being, too. My boss and I took a trip to Area 51 in Nevada.There, I saw an alien through a glass window, but I never went in.WAS IT ALIVE?Yes, it was alive. My boss went in and said the being did not speak at all, it was onlytelepathic. My boss said he would think of a question, but the being would already answerit before he even spoke the question out loud. The being could read my boss’s mind.WHAT DID THE BEING LOOK LIKE?That one was like a typical ‘Grey,’ as they are called today, with the large eyes andnarrow, pointed chin, and small nose, only ear canals without ear lobes. A very frail,skinny-type of body. The being was about 4.5 to 5 feet all.DO YOU REMEMBER THE EYES?Dark, looked like it was wearing sunglasses.THIS IS A DIFFERENT DESCRIPTION THAN THE 6-FINGERED ONES.Yes, the 6-fingered ones looked almost like – according to the photos I saw – they lookedlike small human beings as far as the roundness of the face.SO YOU HAD EXPOSURE TO TWO TYPES OF NON-HUMANS?Yes, that would be true as far as seeing photographs of the 6-fingered ones, which was theextent of my exposure on that first type that were supposed to have been in a New Mexicocrash.The way we got that Grey alien – and I was told there some others, too – is that thesaucers were crashing. And the reason the saucers were crashing was that in the 1950s, wecame out with a much stronger radar system for the USAF bases and control towers.Apparently, the stronger radar signals were interfering with the saucer propulsion in someway.After the early 1950s, maybe the aliens figured out how to counter our radar, because aftera few years, they weren’t crashing like they were.ANY INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THE SPINDLY GREYS CAME FROM?No, not from my CIA work.IF YOU WENT WITH YOUR BOSS TO AREA 51 TO LOOK AT A 4.5-FOOT-TALL,SPINDLY NON-HUMAN AND YOU HAD PREVIOUSLY READ ABOUT AND SEENPHOTOGRAPHS OF 6-FINGERED, MORE MUSCULAR BEINGS, WOULDN’T YOUHAVE ASKED?Yes, I asked if this was a different type and the only thing they said was that the Area 51being was different from the 6-fingered types. I understood that they had not run acrossmore 6-fingered types since a crash at Roswell. And there were photographs from anautopsy on the 6-fingered ones that is like the one shown on television recently (Santilli) They showed an autopsy on one of those beings that had a large wound on one of its legsand I saw that same leg damage in photos we had at the military base.WHAT YEARS DID YOU WORK FOR THE CIA?1957 to 1960. When my 4-year-term was up, because I was actually in the military andcame into the CIA operation through the back door.WHAT WAS YOUR RANK AND MILITARY BRANCH?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"I was a Lieutenant in the U. S. Army Signal Corps teaching at a southern military base.DO YOU KNOW WHY YOU HAD A CLEARANCE TO SEE REPORTS ABOUTEXTRATERRESTRIALS?Originally, I had just a TOP SECRET clearance because I was teaching classifiedcryptography, radio operations and cryptography to Signal Corps officers. Then I startedteaching all the NATO officers that they would bring over. I had European and Asiaticofficers who came from Laos and Vietnam and Cambodia at that time. So, I had a TOPSECRET clearance.My boss, Anthony Barden, was involved with the classified Signal Corps school. He wasactually in charge of the school for the military. but as a civilian CIA man in charge of themilitary school. He was in the background, but he was actually head of the CIA for thesoutheastern United States.Then the CIA got more and more involved with Project Blue Book and when AnthonyBarden was up in Washington, D. C. one time, the CIA assigned him to work on the casesthat the U. S. Air Force could not explain.Those were the cases where the eyewitnesses were very credible such as state patrolofficers and military officers. Those cases would be sent to Anthony Barden. The onlything the public Project Blue Book kept up in Washington were the explainable cases.That’s why Project Blue Book never really had anything solid in it when it was cancelled.My boss and I and our unit of a couple dozen men were seeing the real UFO photos anddocuments collected from Project Blue Book and funneled to the CIA.BY THIS TIME, 1957 TO 1960 – YOU SAID THAT THE HARRY S.

Wehad staff members in our unit that were going out and interviewing eyewitnesses.THAT MEANS WE REALLY DID NOT KNOW WHAT THE EXTRATERRESTRIALSWERE UP TO?That’s absolutely true. Even Truman asked what the aliens were doing here? Where dothey go? Where do they come from?HOW LONG WAS THAT BEING ALIVE AND KEPT AT AREA 51?As far as I know, the being was still alive there when I was working for the CIA(1957-1960). I don’t know if he died, or his species came and got him, or what.There was one report that was not very clear, but I read that a large craft did come overArea 51 in Nevada. The rest of the report pages had been taken out so I don't know whathappened.NOTHING ABOUT THE TYPE OF BEINGS IN THE LARGE CRAFT?No, nothing like that. It looked like someone had gone through the report and pulled all theimportant data out.One of the reports I read said the CIA had ‘silenced’ – they didn’t say killed – about half adozen people over a period of three to four years after the Roswell crash. They hadthreatened some and ‘silenced’ some of them, is what the report said.DID YOU EVER HAVE ASK YOUR BOSS IF THERE WERE 6-FINGERED BEINGSASSOCIATED WITH SAUCER CRAFT IN GERMANY IN 1938, PRIOR TO WORLDWAR II, DID THAT MEAN THE 6-FINGERED BEINGS WERE HELPERS TOGERMANY?They were helpers to Germany.DID YOU EVER TALK WITH YOUR BOSS ABOUT WHY THE 6-FINGERED BEINGSWORKED WITH GERMANY AND THEN WOULD BE RETRIEVED IN A U.S.CRASH?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"All I knew firsthand was a report reference to the German round aerial ships.

We read the same materials. We wereboth trying to get more information, but weren’t able to get hold of anyone else. Ifsomeone contacts you and says, ‘I know the whole story and know everything that’s goingon.’ That person would be a story teller, a liar, because that’s not the way the CIAoperates. Everybody working on the same project gets only assignments in certain areas,so you can never say you have the entire picture.YOU WERE IN THE EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION?Ye s .DID YOU KNOW LT. COL. PHILIP J. CORSO (author of The Day After Roswell.)I had heard of him, but I did not know him.AND GENERAL ARTHUR TRUDEAU? (Head of Army’s R & D in Pentagon,hand-picked by President Dwight Eisenhower)Ye s .ARE YOU AWARE OF LT. COL. PHILIP J. CORSO’S BOOK, THE DAY AFTERROSWELL?I have not read the book.WHAT IS YOUR UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHY THERE IS SUCH A STRICTPOLICY OF DENIAL ABOUT AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL PRESENCE ON THISPLANET?I could never figure that out myself. It’s a cover-up that started and just can’t stop, thattype of thing. I think it all goes back to the 1930s when the Nazis got all the saucer craftout of Germany and worked on the V-1s and V-2s. Then it was the end of the warfollowed by the crash or crashes in Roswell. Then in early 1947, they had the battle withthe flying saucers and what they termed the ‘Nazis’ in Antarctica.My boss’s theory on the whole thing was that we lost that battle down in Antarctica andlost all our airplanes, which were no competition for the flying saucers. We couldn’t do athing to counteract the ‘laser cannons’ on the saucer craft and the saucer craft couldmaneuver so rapidly and easily that we could not even shoot at them.My boss and I were discussing this with some other people that the Marshall Plan startedabout that same time. We felt there was some contact between the Nazis and Argentinaand our government at that time. We felt that was why the Marshall Plan started tore-build Europe. We had to in order to keep the Nazis in Argentina happy. It was almostlike we won the war, but later surrendered by paying for the war.IF WE LOST A LOT OF PLANES TO DISCS WITH ‘LASER CANNONS’ THAT WEREBEING OPERATED BY THE NAZIS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 6-FINGEREDBEINGS, WHY WOULD THAT ENCOUNTER HAVE BEEN CONFINED TOANTARCTICA? WHY WOULDN’T THE NAZIS AND THE BEINGS HAVE FLOWNALL OVER THE WORLD IN THOSE SAME SAUCERS KNOCKING EVERY PLANEOUT OF THE SKY AND TAKING OVER ANYWAY?I think when this thing happened down in Antarctica that beat us so badly, the U.S. startedworking on the Marshall Plan to re-build Europe and that was almost like a peace treatything – the aliens would not touch our cities if we re-built Europe."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"THE MARSHALL PLAN WAS A CAPITULATION TO THE NAZIS AND THEEXTRATERRESTRIALS?Yes, I think so.BUT THAT DOES NOT EXPLAIN - IF THEY HAD THAT KIND OFOVERWHELMING TECHNOLOGY, WHY WOULDN’T THEY HAVE SIMPLYTAKEN OVER THE WORLD ANYWAY?I don’t know.I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY GERMAN NAZIS LOST WWII IF THERE WERE6-FINGERED EXTRATERRESTRIAL BEINGS THAT HAD TECHNOLOGY ANDWERE TEACHING THE NAZIS HOW TO BUILD THEIR ADVANCED AERIALCRAFT. THOSE SAME BEINGS COULD DO WHATEVER THEY WANTED TO ONTHIS PLANET. SO, WHY DID THEY NOT MOVE AGAINST THE UNITED STATES,ENGLAND, AUSTRALIA AND THE ALLIES IF THEY DEMONSTRATED INANTARCTICA THEY COULD TAKE OUT OF THE SKY ANY PLANE THEYWANTED TO?I don’t know.DID YOU EVER SEE ANY HARD TEXT IN DOCUMENTS BETWEEN 1957 TO 1960ABOUT AGENDAS OF THE 6-FINGERED BEINGS OR THE SMALLER, GREYSPINDLY ONES?No, the only reference I saw in the documents boiled down to, ‘We would like to knowwhat they are really up to.” I have seen that comment, or something along those lines,dozens of times.WHEN DID YOU LEAVE THE ARMY?1960.YOU LEFT THE CIA AND THE ARMY AT THE SAME TIME?Yes. There were 24 of us in our CIA/Army group at that time and there were new peoplecome in. What happens in the CIA is that you don’t really retire. It’s like an ancientgladiator group – you don’t have to worry about old age and retirement. My boss died inthe mid-1970s. When I first got into it through the back door by helping him and getting aTOP SECRET clearance, I never used my real name with the CIA. I had a cover name thatI used. That's the only reason I got out – you might say – alive in that early time of 1960after four years – is because of the name I used. Two weeks after I got out, what the CIAwas doing at that time was they had a group that would pick up derelicts that had dieddowntown near our military base of alcoholism or over-dosing on drugs. That clandestinegroup put my CIA name and others identities on those dead people. Then the body orbodies would be cremated and the ashes scattered somewhere so no one could dig up anybody again. My CIA name and identity ended up ‘dead’ a couple of weeks after I left. Thatname died.Of the 24 people who were in that CIA unit, my boss died of natural causes and I got out,but I was the only one who survived out of that group. The others never made it outbecause they started getting involved with spying in Russia and Turkey and they were allkilled.I managed to get out through the help of my boss, but my wife never knew anything aboutthis until about one year ago (in 1997). Everything we worked on was classified for thirtyor thirty-five years. So, by the mid 1990s, the classifying was over and you have a lot ofpeople now coming out, like that military officer who wrote the book (Army Lt. Col. PhilipJ. Corso's The Day After Roswell © 1997 ).
