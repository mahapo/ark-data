February 26, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - I have received hundreds of emails thepast few days from Earthfiles viewers and Earthfiles podcast listeners, as well as COASTand Dreamland listeners, about the aerial lights and symbols in Stephenville and Dublin,Texas, as well as the unidentified white, glowing “plasma” sphere phenomenon at theBrownwood, Texas, deer feeder. Below are some of the images and correspondence.

The camera company had no explanation and only offered a freeroll of film for the trouble. I wish I could have seen what was captured on thatfilm.DG, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina 2) Subject: Strange Light in Infrared Camera at Deer FeederDate: February 23, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comLinda, I watch a deer cam that is in NJ. Here is a link to our club site where Iput some pictures. http://www.lakecountyfishandgame.org/Deercampage.htmlIncludes a strange egg-shaped light or object. The cam takes a picture every 5seconds. There was nothing else there and this object moved in from lowerleft and went about as far into the frame as pictured. It then left to the upperleft. No one has come up with a good answer as to what this is. The owner ofthe cam said it was a dust ball. I'm not too sure about that."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Infrared deer camera in New Jersey takes images every 5 seconds.None of the images before the one above had any white ovals in them.The second image in the sequence is below, in which the white object has moved furtherupward toward the upper left of image, but nothing was visible in the next frame.Please see: http://www.lake countyfishandgame.org/De e rcampage .html 3) Subject: Another Red Orb of SortsDate: February 23, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comI would like to share my experience of an encounter with a \"red orb\" I had 6or 7 years ago. It was the 4th of July in Falmouth, Massachusetts. I was sittingon the beach with friends and family. It was dark and we were waiting for theannual fireworks display to begin. From my right, I could see a smallpurplish-red object approaching very fast. It was just in my peripheral sightabout 3 feet off the ground. I turned to view it and as fast as I did, it zoomedin front of me making a small path correction so to not hit the 3 others sittingon my right. Then the object zipped to my left, again correcting for people onthe beach and on down the beach to the edge of the water. This object lookedto me a little smaller than a Silly Putty container, but about the same shape.It was completely quiet and probably traveling at over 80 mph. It was not abug and not a stray firework or new toy. I am not crazy because I saw itcoming, watched it make conscious course adjustments and continue on towherever it was going. When the event passed, which might have lasted 1-2seconds, I joked to my buddy by saying, \"What the hell was that?\" He said hedidn't know, but also saw it. No one else in my group saw it and there mighthave been 15 of us adults and kids. On the 4th of July, there are as many as40,000 people who come to view the fireworks on this 2 mile section ofbeach. I am sure someone else could have seen this also. 4) Subject: Light Balls in Sansom Park, Fort Worth, TexasDate: February 23, 2008 9:32:56 AM MST"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comMy grandmother told me that she saw light balls in her yard inFort Worth, Texas. I believe she saw them sometime in the 1970s.Additionally, my cousin - a child of a military officer who was stationed atRoswell around the early 1950s - contracted cancer. I believe she was in her20s and received compensation from the government because of adetermination that she had been exposed to high levels of radiation as a child.They also resided near Carswell Air Force Base in the 1960s. I have oftenwondered what my uncle knew about the Roswell incidents?[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Carswell Air Force Base (1942 -1994) is a former United States Air Force Strategic Air Commandbase located about 5 miles northwest of Fort Worth, Texas. Formost of it's operational lifetime, the base's mission was to trainand support heavy strategic bombing groups and wings. Today,the base is known as Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base in FortWorth and is operated by the United States Navy.The west side of the base still serves as Air Force Plant #4 andemploys 17,000 personnel, primarily Lockheed Martinemployees.

He could see the sky and part of the Saskatchewan river,at that moment iced-up, running alongside the RiversideMunicipal Golf Course far from the window - about 1500 metersas the crow flies. ... Suddenly, L.R. spotted a brilliant light in thedark sky. It came from the East headed fast towards the Northand moving on, perpendicular to his point of observation. At first,he thought it was an aeroplane, because the airport was not faraway, but its path and its behavior attracted his attention.In fact the brilliant dot started to become lower. Then it stopped,starting to emit an intense pulsating light. He noticed now itsglobular shape. The size was double that of a car’s headlight. Thelight was now fixed in the dark sky emanating a pulsating reddishlight. Suddenly the light went off. And the object was no longervisible. But in the position where the object should have been, abright blue ring appeared, becoming bigger and bigger while itwas directed towards the ground until it disappeared. Thisphenomena of the rings was repeated 3 times. Then the objectre-appeared with its reddish pulsating light."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"It remained there for about 10 minutes. It was about 11:45 p.m.when another extremely faint light came away from the mainobject and rapidly moved towards the ground in an oblique path.The little object was now at about the level of 500 meters. Itstarted to slow down, almost stopping, then started again to slowdown, still headed towards the ground. Now L.R. could see itclearly. It was round, terribly squashed at the poles. It was asilver color. It emanated a soft violet light. It rotated slowly onitself and emitted a buzzing sound like an electric transformer. Itflew over the Saskatchewan river and landed on the grass of theRiverside Municipal Golf Course - far from his window - about1.500 meters as the crow flies. There, the light of the object wentout. It remained extinguished for about 5 minutes. Then it lit upagain and took off towards the main object, still fixed in the samepoint as before. When the little object reached the main object, itwas literally swallowed by the main object. Then, the largerobject started to move slowly, then fast, at the same time thatlight became more brilliant and pulsating, and then it disappearedtowards the North.The day after, November 5th, Sunday, L.R. woke up early andlooked in the newspaper for some news about the phenomenon.He couldn't find any news, so he decided to look at the locationof the landing. He needed about half an hour to find, on the grass,the traces of the landing: a ring of 5 meters of squashed grass. Ata distance of about two meters from the ring's edge there weresome holes in the ground of about 10 cm. in diameter. He wasleaving the spot when a twinkling on the grass attracted hisattention. A piece of metal peeped out among the blades of grass.It was a square plate like copper, with strange characters andwriting engraved on it. The size of the plate was 17.3 cm. wide by12.5 cm. high. Thickness: about 1 mm. He took the plate homewith him.

After that experience, many interestingthings began happening to us. One experience that stands out in my mind wasan experience I had with strange symbols that looked very much like thesymbols that you are writing about on your website.Here is a written recount I did of the experience:“I was sitting on the edge of my bed, when suddenly a strangeand sudden 'projection' of light appeared to me as I closed myeyes. There was a sound like an electrical crackling, and theprojected light seemed to blink and appeared like an 'old time"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"movie.' The picture that I saw was a list of 'glyphs' or unknownwriting. They appeared in 4 long rows (like lists) and were blackon a white screen-like background. They flickered on and off (butnever entirely blinking out) and I could hear faint electricalsound—almost like an old movie projector sound. My grandfatherused to manage drive-in movie theaters in Cincinnati, Ohio, andsometimes he would take me with him so I could watch movies. Iwas shown the room that held the giant projector and oftenwatched and heard the large reel turning as it played the film.This is why I can compare what I saw with the movie projectorscenario. I could see the picture with my eyes open or closed.”Afterward I wrote some of the symbols down (my notes are packed away instorage), but I do remember distinctly that they were VERY much the same asthe symbols you are describing in your reports. Years ago, I thought I washaving some spiritual experience, but now many, many years later I do believethat experience and many others were purposely induced for whatever reason.Now I’m really wondering if some part of my consciousness knows andunderstands those symbols and I’ll understand more about it sometime in thefuture. Linda, thanks for letting me share this experience, and many thanks forall you do! 7) Subject: Sightings Over TexasDate: February 23, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comTwo weeks ago on a Friday morning (Feb. 8, 2008), I was on my way home inthe morning (I throw news papers in Dallas, TX) and I saw something odd. Iwas heading S.E. on Hwy. 175 (15 miles S.E. of Dallas) and I was looking upat Venus and Jupiter (they had been close together). It was a clear sky, noclouds no planes, nothing, but those two planets up there, just before sunrise.All of a sudden I saw a light up there between the two planets. It wasn't thereand then it was! I looked at it for a second or two and then the light took off ata high rate of speed, like the things you see if you watch the Star Trek moviesor TV show. Up and out and away, it was gone in a second.When I got home, I mentioned it to my husband, and he asked me if it was afalling star? NO, it went up and away between the two planets. I know what Isaw was far away, and it was the sun shining on it that made it visible, so I amassuming it was big and it was fast. I have watched the space station and theshuttle go over many times and I have seen many falling stars. This was fasterthan the space station (and that moves pretty fast). Don't know what it was,but once you are up in the air and can move fast, we are not that far fromwhere those other sightings happened in Stephenville, Texas.More Information:For further information about Texas unidentified aerial phenomena, please see relatedEarthfiles reports:• 02/22/2008 — Updated: More Aerial “Symbols” Photographed OverDublin, Texas Reporter Angelia Joiner Resigned from Newspaper.• 02/20/2008 — Updated Part 1: Viewer Comments About Aerial Flamesand “Symbols” Over Dublin and Stephenville, Texas• 02/06/2008 — Updated 02-14-08: Mysterious Symbols Projected inNight Sky by Aerial Disc Near Stephenville, Texas, Local Airport• 02/08/2008 — Law Officers Describe Unidentified Shape-Shifting AerialCraft in Stephenville, Texas, Region• 02/22/2008 — Updated: Three Eyewitnesses in Selden, Texas, Saw Two,Large Rectangles of “White Flames” in Sky Infrared Deer CameraAnomalies.• 01/28/2008 — Updated 01-28-08: Viewer Letters About Aerial Craftand Military Flyovers Above Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"• 01/18/2008 — Updated with graphic: Huge Aerial Craft Over Dublin,Texas, “Longer Than 3 Football Fields” For further information about Jim Sparks's many experiences and other UFO andnon-human encounters, please see reports below in the Earthfiles Archives and mybooks An Alien Harvest, the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities, and my documentaryfilms in the Earthfiles Shop:• 03/31/2007 -- The Strange Case of Ken Rose• 01/08/2007 -- Updated: Attorney Describes His Encounter with Non-Human Entities• 01/02/2007 -- Grey Aerial Disk Reported by Chicago O'Hare United Airlines Pilots andMechanics• 11/27/2006 -- Namibia Telescopes Find First \"Gamma Clock\" in Milky Way Galaxy• 10/28/2006 -- Close UFO Encounter by USAF Eyewitnesses• 10/23/2006 -- One, Maybe Two, More Mysterious Radio Bursts from Galactic Center• 10/19/2006 -- Another Cattle Mutilation in Pondera County, Montana• 09/29/2006 -- Manipulation of Time and Matter by Non-Humans: The Experiences of JimSparks• 09/16/2006 -- Disc Crash At Cedar Breaks Radar Site, Utah• 09/05/2006 -- Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 09/04/2006 -- Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 07/28/2006 -- 1940s USAF Flight Surgeon's Account of E.
