There weremany semi- trucks on the road who probably saw this, too. It is a verydesolate desert area.“Suddenly a bright blue light illuminated my whole car from above. Eventhough I was alone, I said, ‘What the hell is that?’ and had to lean forward tolook up through my windshield. I saw a huge blue light streak from above mycar off to the right side of the road. It stopped in mid air and appeared to be aextremely bright, icy blue colored ball. It then flashed even brighter andvanished. It did not hit the ground as say a meteor might. The only visiblecolor was blue. I had no way to determine the real size or distance from me. Agrapefruit held at arm's length was about the size of the ball as I could see itfrom my car. I am a professional artist and have never seen a UFO or anythinglike this before.”Subject: Turquoise colored object I photographedDate: June 6, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“Hi Linda,Your posting June 6, 2008 - Mysterious Crash Near Needles, California -immediately brought to my mind a series of pictures I had taken from the roofof my studio in Ohio when gathering cloud pictures for a project. Theturquoise color mentioned in your report seems to fit the color in my photos.Feel free to ask Frank Costigan if this is what it looked like?Notes about the 1997 photos:1) The lens I used in the pictures was a Nikkor 28 mm 1:2.8.2) The complex with a tall smoke stack that I was photographing is part ofBattelle Memorial Institute (Battelle is an international science andtechnology enterprise). I find the close proximity to Battelle worthy of note.”Early November 1997, Ohio: turquoise blue object caught while artist photographed clouds.Photographer: “(Turquoise object) moved up through 4 or 5 frames as I was doing a verticalpanorama of the sky. There were several frames before the sequence without the turquoiseobject and after as well. I did not see it with my eyes through the view finder. It may have been"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"there at the time. The size was pretty small so I could have missed it or it was not visible to thehuman eye. I only saw the object upon looking at the processed pictures. The image is in thenegatives and not a blemish or scratch. It appears in different parts of each frame.”June 6, 2008 Needles, California - On Wednesday, May 14, 2008, at 3 AM Pacific southof Needles, California, on the Colorado River near Topock, Arizona, a long-timehouseboat resident was stunned to see a large, bright “fiery object” hurtling from the skytoward him. From the upper deck on his houseboat, “R. B.” was puzzled by the vividturquoise-blue with touches of green he was seeing instead of reds, yellows and oranges inmore normal fire. Despite the strange blue-green color, Ted thought perhaps he waswatching a plane about to crash.Ted did not know there was another eyewitness - Frank Costigan, retired formerSuperintendent of Operations and Police Chief at Los Angeles International Airport from1978 to 1985 and Superintendent of Operations at Ontario International Airport inCalifornia from 1985 to 1986. Recently Frank Costigan has been doing special newsinvestigations and reports for KTOX AM 1340 Radio in Needles, California.At 3 AM on May 14, 2008, Frank had gotten up to let his Siamese cat out and wentoutside to look at the clear night sky. His home is about three miles east of the ColoradoRiver. To his surprise, a large, bright object of many colors dominated by turquoise bluewith some green was streaking through the sky toward the Colorado River area. Frankcould also see some red and yellow colors like flames and expected to hear the huge boomof a crash impact.“I thought I might hear something when it hit the ground because if it was as close as Ithought it was and as big as it was, I thought I would hear something. But I did not hearanything. And it went out of my view before it hit the ground.”But over on the Colorado River, R. B. was only about 400 yards from where the fieryturquoise-blue object hit the ground on the west side of the river. R. B. has requestedanonymity because he’s afraid the U. S. government hurts people who report UFOs. He didnot even want his voice recorded. R. B. has lived in a houseboat on the Colorado River forthirty some years. He was outside at 3 AM fishing when he saw the brilliant,turquoise-blue flaming object. When it hit the ground about 100 yards west of the river, hesaw the whole thing bounce back up in the air with even more glowing red-yellow piecesaround the big center object. And yet, he did not hear the crash sound he expected. “Therewas only a thump sound,” he told me.But he was afraid that some kind of plane had crashed and urgently went down to thelower deck of his houseboat to get his cell phone and climbed back up to the top deck toget a satellite signal for his phone. When he had a signal, he kept dialing 911, but only gota busy signal. All of this took about seven minutes after the crash. Then to his completeamazement, John Smith heard the loud sound of a sky-hook, or skycrane, helicoptercoming fast in the night sky. The next thing he knew, the still-glowing object was hookedunderneath the skycrane and carried away rapidly.I asked R. B. how big he thought the glowing object was? He said it was about the size of a10,000-gallon tank truck – big and oval-shaped.After the sun came up, David Hayes, the Owner and General Manager of KTOX AM1340, was driving to work along I-40 in Needles, when he saw very unusual vehiclestraveling together with black and white U. S. government license plates.Interviews:David Hayes, Owner and General Manager, KTOX AM 1340, Needles, California:“That same morning (May 14, 2008), when I drove to the KTOX station which is rightalong I-40 in Needles, I noticed strange vehicles coming off the freeway going west intoNeedles. The first one was a very strange, black vehicle that was 4-wheel drive, definitelylooked like it had a very beefed up suspension. It had a grill on the front of it and a utilitybed in the back that had some strange bumps and almost looked like a radar dome-shapedtype thing on top of it. It was black and had a triangular bed on the back. It kind of lookedstealthy.Right behind it was a green van. Both had U. S. government license plates, the white withblack letters. Behind those two, was a very long brand new stretch van also beefed up withgovernment plates and a very serious man who I looked at and made eye contact with andhe just stared me down. I was parallel with him on a frontage road as he was coming offthe freeway and he slowed down to my speed. I was on a dirt road and going only 10 to 15mph, when he could have been doing 40 mph over that bridge. He just got real slow andstared me down. I thought, ‘If you’re going to drive a Star Wars vehicle with U. S."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"government plates and not think people are not going to stare at you!?’ I just wonderedwhy he was staring at me so intently. After that, Frank told me what he had seen falling inthe sky from his place around 3 AM.Then another friend of ours in the Laughlin, Nevada, airport area said that flights fromMcCarran Airport to Area 51 were coming in and landing throughout that day (May 14,2008).So, it was like, ‘Wow, this is pretty strange!’One thing I’ll say about the government vehicles and the people in them is that they werevery, very serious. In fact, it was suspiciously serious. That’s what got my ears perked upand when you put it all together.” R. B.'s Experience in Colorado River HouseboatR. B. has requested anonymity as one of many people who live in houseboats on theColorado River and happened to be out fishing at 3 AM on Wednesday, May 14, 2008.R. B.: “Never seen anything this dramatic come out of sky before. Have seen green-bluemeteors, but this thing was bright, turquoise blue, almost like a lighter sky blue!Arizona turquoise gemstone.Source: Indianvillage.com.Whatever crashed, I thought at the time it was a plane crashing.BECAUSE IT HAD WINGS AND A TAIL?No, because it was flaming.ACTUAL FIRE?Oh, yes, but a turquoise-blue fire with some green in it. And it hit the ground and bounced.But there were many other pieces – there were at least nine other pieces that bounced upin a circle around the turquoise blue-green object.ALL BOUNCING UP IN THE AIR AT THE SAME TIME?No, the main unit that looked like the size of a tanker truck hit. I was sitting on top of myboat fishing and listening to the radio like I do living out here on the Colorado River, but Isaw it hit and thought, ‘My God, it has to be a plane that hit and bounced!’ Not like a ball,but it hit and came back up and went back down again. But there were other pieces thatwere coming with it. When it settled down, I couldn’t see it because of bushes between meon the river and where it came down.WHEN IT BOUNCED GLOWING, WHAT WAS THE SHAPE?More oval shaped. When it came down, that’s how I saw the shape of it – by theturquoise-blue fire that was in front of it that showed the oval shape.THE BIG PIECE WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SEMI-TRAILER TRUCK?Yes, about the size of a maybe a 10,000-gallon tank truck.HOW DID YOU JUDGE THE SIZE OF THE CRASHED OBJECT AS BEING LIKE A10,000-GALLON TANK TRUCK?Because there was a huge fire in front of it as it was coming down.DID THE OTHER SMALLER PIECES GLOW THE SAME BLUE-GREEN?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"No, they were more of a reddish color. But those smaller, glowing pieces did not appearuntil after the impact. It was like they broke off. The big object hit the ground at atremendous speed.DID IT MAKE A BIG BOOMING SOUND WHEN IT HIT?No, actually, there was just a thump. It hit hard, but there was no crash sound. That’s whenI saw the other pieces that flew off. I can’t believe I’m seeing this, and I had to go off theweather deck down to the main deck to get my phone because I thought a plane hascrashed. There was no signal for my phone. Where I stay on the river, it’s hard to get asignal. So, I had to wait for a phone signal for maybe seven or eight minutes because asatellite was not there. Finally, I got a signal indication and I called 911, but there was noanswer! My call would not go through. I kept getting a busy signal. Skycrane Retrieved Large,Still-Glowing, Oval-Shaped Crash ObjectAnyway, that’s when I heard the rotors going overhead. There were no lights, but I knowwhat a skycrane sounds like and I know what it looks like.Skycrane hauling up interferometer housing at Mt. Wilson Observatoryin Los Angeles, California, in 1998. Image source: Erickson Air-Crane , Inc.And that skycrane was with at least four smaller helicopters. The skycrane and the smallerhelicopters surrounded the crashed object and the sky crane picked the thing up stillglowing and off it went. From the time that object impacted to the time it was picked upwas only about 17 minutes!HOW DO YOU THINK THE SKYCRANE PICKED UP THE BIG OBJECT?That’s the funny part. I could not figure that out. I was there trying to call 911 about anairplane crash and I went back up to get the phone signal and the skycrane already had thebig object in the air! I could tell because it was still glowing – it was still red hot. And up itwent toward the northwest at an extremely high rate of speed, from where I’m at, directlytowards Las Vegas. When it was coming before it hit, the object had the turquoise-bluecolor to it. Then it hit and bounced and I went to get my phone. Then the skycrane cameand as they were hauling the object off, it had a gold-orange hot glow to it.WHEN THE SKY-CRANE PICKED UP THE OBJECT WITH THE GOLD-ORANGEHOT GLOW, WAS THERE STILL SOME OF THE TURQUOISE COLOR?Just in the front where it seemed to be wrinkled a bit. It was picked up either in a net or bycables, but they picked it up so quickly and flew it off so quickly.THAT MEANS SOMEONE WAS TRACKING THE OBJECT ALL THE WAY DOWNAND ALREADY HAD THE SKYCRANE IN THE AIR TO RETRIEVE IT."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"They must have because the time from when it hit the ground to when they flew off with itwas not more than about 17 minutes.WHERE WAS THE IMPACT IN RELATIONSHIP TO YOUR HOUSEBOAT? HOW FARWAS IT FROM YOU?Approximately less than 400 yards.WHICH DIRECTION FROM THE RIVER?Coming from straight up to straight down on the west side, California side, of the ColoradoRiver.DID ANY GOVERNMENT AGENTS OR VEHICLES SHOW UP AFTER SUN UP?No, the only thing that happened is that one of those small helicopters circled around myboat, shone a blue beam down that night, and then flew off. KTOX Weekly Tuesday Guest QuestionedOn Tuesday, May 27, 2008, David Hayes at KTOX hosted his regular morning radioprogram. Since May 14, he has talked about Frank Costigan's and R. B.'s fiery turquoisesighting and R. B.'s crash account. On May 27, David Hayes made a radio appeal for anyother eyewitnesses to call KTOX and asked R. B. if he would call David again off air.On May 27th, the KTOX regular weekly guest to discuss politics was Toni Sagan, amember of the local River Valley Democratic Club. Her radio topic was the Barack Obamaand Hilary Clinton battle for the presidential nomination. Toni told me she did not absorbthe details about R. B.'s experience during the radio broadcast and was very surprised atthe Democratic Club meeting that week when a well-dressed stranger approached her atthe meeting and began asking questions about the crash.Toni told me the stranger called himself “Phil” and asked her if she knew R. B. She saidshe did not. Phil asked her if she knew any details from the off air conversation betweenDavid Hayes and R. B. off air. Toni told Phil she had no information. Phil sounded irritatedand asked her if she heard any discussion about whether the object was on fire, what colorit was, how big it was, did it splash in the river, who came to get it and where did R. B.live?Toni Sagan told Phil she knew nothing about the crashed object or R. B., which furtherirritated him to say, ‘But you were sitting right there during the broadcast. Didn't you hearany discussion with R. B.?’Toni was puzzled by the stranger's impatient interrogation during a Democratic Partymeeting. The last she saw of Phil was his leaving the room to have a cigarette outside andhe never returned. “Who do you think he was?” Toni asked. “His clothes were too neatand nice for Bullhead country here and his hair was cut short and neat. Do you think hewas working for the military or government? If so, why would he ask me questions? It'sDavid who runs KTOX and knows R. B.”If any Earthfiles viewers have more information about the fiery turquoise-blue,oval-shaped object that crashed on the western side of the Colorado River south ofNeedles, California, near Topoc, Arizona, at 3 AM on Wednesday, May 14, 2008, pleaseemail me: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Confidentiality is always honored.More Information:For further information about unidentified aerial objects, please see my books anddocumentaries in the Earthfiles Shop and Earthfiles Archive reports listed below:• 05/20/2008 — High Strangeness in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada• 05/06/2008 — Viewer Comments on Decatur, Alabama, White Sphere Incident• 05/06/2008 — What Are the Strange “Pearls” in Google Map Images?• 04/29/2008 — Part 1: Insights from An Experiencer with Greys and Blond Humanoids• 04/24/2008 — Strange Aerial Lights Like Texas -
