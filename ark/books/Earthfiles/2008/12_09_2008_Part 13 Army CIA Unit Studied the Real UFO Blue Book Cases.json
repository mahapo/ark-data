WHAT DID COL. JIM SAY TO MOVE YOU FROM THE MOUNTAIN HANGAR OFDISCS BACK TO THE OFFICE BUILDING?He said we needed to move along to see one of the aliens in the interview room and saidhe wanted to have us see him. We were dumbfounded because at that moment, we had noidea we were going to be introduced to a real alien, non-human being!WERE YOU EXPECTING THEN TO SEE A 6-FINGERED BEING?Yes, all of us were. Then when we saw the being that we did with the large eyes and large,smooth head expanding upward above a slit mouth and narrow chin, we were kind ofshocked at how that alien actually looked. Like with the 6-fingered beings, there weremuscles showing, but on the one at Area 51, he was very thin with ‘anemic’ arms.FROM YOUR CLOSE-UP VIEW, WAS THE AREA 51 GREY BEING’S SKINTEXTURED? SOME ABDUCTEES COMPARE SKIN THEY HAVE SEEN TO CANVAS.Texture on canvas roll."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Brian Scott and others in the human abduction syndromeover the years have often described some grey, non-human skin as roughand textured. Image © by Brian Scott. Also see in Archive: 011103 Earthfiles.Yes, the being was definitely textured and there were areas of little outcroppings on hisskin that looked like a bee sting puffed up around his neck and down his arms. He wasn’tcompletely smooth everywhere. Canvas would be a good description for it along with theanomalies on his skin.I didn’t see his lower body because he had like a T-shirt over him. I don’t know why hewas dressed up in human clothes.PERHAPS TO MAKE THE BEING MORE ACCEPTABLE TO YOUR VIEWING.I couldn’t believe how big the eyes were!SO YOU LEAVE THE DISCS IN THE HANGAR INSIDE PAPOOSE MOUNTAIN ANDWALK BACK INTO THE OFFICE COMPLEX CONNECTED TO THE MOUNTAIN. Telepathic ExchangeYes, and Col. Jim said we could ‘talk’ to the alien for maybe ten minutes. I don’t knowwhat the big rush was. It was like they needed to take the alien somewhere after we sawhim. Col. Jim said the alien being does not speak to you verbally, only telepathically.That’s when I talked with my boss, Anthony Barden, about my growing up being taughtthat demons were telepathic and I was afraid the creature in the office was a demon. So, Iasked Anthony to ask the being if it was a demon and where it came from and how old itwas. Anthony said he did ask my questions.I stayed outside about 20 feet from the 1-way mirror that I could see through into theoffice where the grey being was, but inside the office what I was looking through lookedlike a mirror. So, I could see the being and I could see it was not very tall, probably 5 feetor a little less, but definitely taller than 3 feet like the 6-fingered ones.When my boss, Anthony Barden, went inside the office, I could see the being sittingbehind a table. And then when the pressure got to the alien after Anthony asked if thebeing was a demon.My CIA boss explained that when you came up with a question in your mind, none of thehumans had to say the question out loud. The grey being could read your mind and answertelepathically before you could even say the question.DID YOUR BOSS EXPLAIN LATER WHAT THE GREY BEING’S TELEPATHICCOMMUNICATION TO HIM SOUNDED LIKE?From the description that they gave that it sounded more electronic than a human voice, aneutral voice that didn’t sound high or low. But that still reminded me of the description ofdemonic voices when I was a child.Anthony first said out loud, ‘Are you a demon?’ And the being appeared frustrated ornervous."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WAS THE BEING SITTING DOWN?Yes, and the being moved around and communicated back to their minds that he was not ademon.Then the other CIA agents there asked the alien where he was from. The being answeredwith some kind of star or galaxy area with a number that no one had ever heard aboutbefore. Grey Being Upset by Demon QuestionsThen Anthony asked the being if it was a demon possessing the alien body – ‘Do youpossess these grey alien bodies because demons don’t have the power to manifestthemselves as physical beings?’The grey being looked up at the ceiling and made some kind of sighing sound and lookedupset and did not answer the question.Anthony asked a second time. Then the being got up and started pacing back and forthwith its hands behind its back, but in front of the table. Kind of walking sideways back andforth with his hands out of sight like he didn’t want us to see his hands. And we couldn’tsee the being’s feet, because the lower part of its body was behind the desk. Then thebeing sat down again.But when Anthony asked the first questions about the alien being a demon, Anthony couldhear the answers in his head, but the other men could not hear the answer. Only the personwho was communicating with the alien would hear the answer back, not the others. So themen began repeating the questions and answers out loud.DID ANYONE ASK THE GREY BEING, ‘WHY DON’T YOU TELEPATH TO ALLOUR HEADS SO WE CAN HEAR EVERYTHING AT THE SAME TIME?’Yes, they did, and the being said he was communicating the way he communicated, likeone-on-one. So, when they spoke out loud each other’s questions, that was the only waythe men knew what each was asking. And each man had to repeat the answer heindividually heard in his mind from the being.YOU ARE WATCHING AND YOU COULD SEE THE MOMENT WHERE THE GREYBEING GOT UP AND PACED. DID YOU ASK ANTHONY BARDEN LATER WHYTHE BEING SEEMED UPSET? Yes, I did and Anthony said he was trying to ask the question my demon questions and wasafraid if he kept on asking my questions, the being might leap across the desk and try tostrangle him. ‘Stein, you really pushed this alien’s buttons,’ Anthony said to me, laughing.I wondered then if the grey being was upset because it actually was occupied and operatedby a demon like demons can possess human beings? Grey Beings and 6-Fingered Beings -What Is Relationship?WHY WOULDN’T ANTHONY BARDEN HAVE ASKED THE BEING TO SHOW ITSHANDS SINCE YOU ALL HAD SEEN THE 6-FINGERED AUTOPSY?Yes, I think Anthony just thought at the time all aliens had six fingers. And Col. Jim, on theway out of that office complex, I asked, ‘Is this the only alien you have?’ Col. Jim did notanswer that question, but said, ‘If you’ve seen one alien, you’ve seen them all.’ Which Iknow now is not true.WHY DIDN’T YOU FROM THE CIA SAY YOU HAD SEEN AN AUTOPSY FILM OF A6-FINGERED BEING THAT DIDN’T LOOK ANYTHING LIKE THE GREY IN THEAREA 51 OFFICE COMPLEX?Yes, we did bring that up with Col. Jim right before our CIA group went into the room withthe being. Col. Jim said something like, ‘This is an alien called a ‘Grey.’ Some of the alienshave different features. There are different kinds, but this happens to be a ‘Grey.’ The6-fingered ones looked grey-colored, too.DID ANTHONY BARDEN ASK COL. JIM IF THEY HAD A 6-FINGERED BEING?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I did ask Col. Jim exactly how many aliens they had there at Area 51, but he would notanswer the question.DID YOU PERSIST ABOUT THE AUTOPSY FILM OF A BEING THAT DIDN’T EVENLOOK LIKE THE GREY IN THE OFFICE?Not really because Col. Jim did say before the meeting with the alien that there weredifferent types of aliens. Anthony mentioned the autopsy film and Col. Jim stressed thegrey alien in the office was entirely different from the being in the autopsy film.DID ANY OF YOU ASK WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP WAS BETWEEN THEDIFFERENT ALIEN TYPES?Col. Jim did say they all seemed to say the same thing – that they were all here to be a helpand not a hindrance, that they were not coming here to destroy the United States or theworld.DID ANTHONY BARDEN ASK HOW MANY DIFFERENT NON-HUMANS WERE ONEARTH?Yes, he asked the grey alien that question and the alien refused to answer.WASN’T THERE DISCUSSION BETWEEN YOUR BOSS AND COL. JIM ABOUTWHY THE GREY BEING WAS IN THE OFFICE?Anthony asked how long the being had been there? What was our government doing withthe alien? Where else was it going? Col. Jim answered that the being had been at Area 51‘for some time.’ But he would not say how long.HOW DID THE SESSION WITH THE GREY BEING IN THE OFFICE COME TO ANEND?Col. Jim was in there with my boss and the other guys at the beginning. But then he cameback out into the room where I was and seemed to be bored by the same questions thatothers asked the grey being before in other sessions. He looked at his watch and went backinto the office and said, ‘This is the last question.’” Continued in Part 14 - CIA Briefing with V. Pres. Richard M.
