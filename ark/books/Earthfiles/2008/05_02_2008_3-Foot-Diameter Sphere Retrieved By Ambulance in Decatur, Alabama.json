The aerial photographs weretaken in the winter months, and when the negatives were scanned (on a coolmorning back in our office in Phoenix) small drops of condensation hadformed on the glass of the scanner. These drops were so small, they wentun-detected by the operator. They were on the underside of the glass, and soappear to obscure the photograph.At one point, I remember the CEO, Bill Lands, joking about them because aprogram from the Discovery Channel had contacted him directly. He plannedon releasing a PR piece with a picture of the scanner, and operator in an aliencostume. He had a great sense of humor. Sorry to dispel the myth, just a bitof water under the scanner.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" May 3, 2008 Update: Today I received the following email from an Earthfiles viewer andDreamland/Unknowncountry.com listener about two, 2005 Google map images of apearl-like, unidentified object over Mangonia Park, Florida, near Palm Beach:Subject: The Decatur ‘White Pearl’ - previous sightingDate: May 3, 2008 3:37:59 PM MDTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“I read with much interest the story of the ‘white pearl.’Over at Whitley's (Unknowncountry.com) - some time ago - there was apicture - I believe it was taken by Google Maps, during the aerial mappingprocess over Florida. The picture inadvertantly captured an almost similar(pearl-like) item in flight.There was some discussion as to altitude, but the concensus was that itappeared to be ‘vibrating’ in flight.I've attached 2 pictures that were posted at Whitley's, but I cannot give a datefor the event.” I emailed Whitley Strieber, Unknowncountry.com co-producer with Anne Strieber andDreamland host to ask about their website report. Whitley emailed back the original May18, 2005, story with these comments: “Unfortunately, looking at the (current) Googlemaps, I think that they have been reshot, which happens on a schedule, so the objects areno longer visible by clicking on the Google map. If you read the sightseeing report, itmakes reference to a number of other UFOs that were in the area at the time. You'd needto find out Google's mapping satellite schedule to determine if the UFOs have disappearedbecause of new images, or if they were airbrushed out.”“Google Map Mystery© May 18, 2005www.unknowncountry.com Mangonia Park, Florida, near Palm Beach.

The Google Maps satellite map ofMangonia Park, Florida, shows a clear view of an unusual object floatingabove 39th Street in the town. The shadow on the object is similar to theshadows on the ground, meaning that it is in the atmosphere relatively close tothe surface, probably no higher than 20,000 feet.“There are no towers or unusual objects in the area that could account for theformation, which appears to be in rapid vibrational movement. Because of theunusual motion visible on its surface, it is not likely that this is a balloon.“Without knowing its distance from the ground, it is impossible to determinethe size of the object, but it would seem to be quite large, even huge.“Calls to individuals living in the area and a search of news sources for 2005revealed no reports of UFOs over Palm Beach or Magnolia Park this year.

Strangest of all was what happened over on 8th Street at theBrookhaven Middle School’s Aquadome parking lot. Police cars and fire trucks on theground and at least three military helicopters in the air were all concentrated on a singleambulance that had a stretcher outside its open doors. On the stretcher was a 3-foot-diameter sphere that looked like a glistening pearl.One of two teenage eyewitnesses who got close to the scene is 17-year-old Codey Terry, astudent at Madison’s Bob Jones High School. He explains what led to his being so close tothe sphere on the stretcher that he could see that ambulance light “sparkled like adiamond” on the sphere’s surface as if it were a large, round crystal.Interview: Codey Terry, 17-year-old student, Bob Jones High School, Madison, Alabama:“Friday afternoon (April 25, 2008) when I got out of school, my girlfriend and I hung outand went to see a movie. Then we went back to her house. I left her about 11 PM and wasgoing back to Decatur to my grandma’s house to spend the night. I was also going to pickup my friend, Zack, to spend the night with me.So, I got into Decatur and had just gotten past the Courthouse and on to Central Parkway.I was going down that road for – I don’t know – maybe three minutes and I saw thisbluish-white light coming through my windshield. I thought that was weird because I didnot remember seeing the moon out – plus, it just happened so quick. So, I leaned forwardand looked out my window and it looked like an airplane was coming straight downtowards me. It looked like two, big headlights.So, I slammed on the brakes and my car started spinning out of control. There were noother cars and I got out and was looking in the sky. I was also on the phone with Zack andI was yelling at him to get under his bed, to take cover, because a plane was about tocrash. Then, all of a sudden, whatever I was seeing, it just stopped in the middle of the air.And it never was making a sound. I don’t know if it changed shape, but it definitely gotbrighter. Those two lights that were on it changed to one huge, big, solid, complete circleof light and it was blinding bright.So, I held my hand up in front of my eyes looking through my hand and the light picked upspeed and went straight to the ground. I never heard an explosion. I didn’t see anything.And that’s weird!At that time, my mom was calling me because she wanted me to go to the store and getsome milk. I told her, ‘I can’t believe what I just saw!’ She said, ‘Well, don’t freak outbecause on the news they were saying something about strange lights over Decatur.’ So, Iget off the phone with my mom and I turned on to 8th Street, which is where it happened. 8th Street and AquadomeAll of a sudden, a few fire trucks and ambulances and cops pass me, running through thered lights as quick as they can. That was weird, too! I figured they were going to whateverI had seen. So, I got to my friend’s house and told Zack.Then, (Codey makes sound of helicopter blades whopping) there was the sound ofhelicopters coming from everywhere. Zack and I go outside and I know for sure we sawone helicopter. But to me, it looked like there were two more beside it (total three) allblack.We jumped in the car and hurried down there and by the time we got to the Aquadome,the helicopters had already landed. The fire trucks were in the middle of the road, so weparked in a driveway and jumped a fence. We were sitting there watching from beside anapartment that was so close, I was within fifteen feet of the action. A helicopter was on theground in the Aquadome parking lot and it was a Med Fly helicopter (from Huntsville, notDecatur). There were at least two more helicopters in the air."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"WHERE IT CAME DOWN, WHAT IS THERE?That is a middle school, but where they picked up the sphere is a recreational center with aswimming pool and play ground and basketball courts.WHAT IS THAT SCHOOL CALLED?Brookhaven Middle School.WHERE WERE YOU SEEING THE AMBULANCE ON THE BROOKHAVENMIDDLE SCHOOL LAND?Brookhaven is right next door to the Aquadome. They were on the Aquadome's backparking lot. Fire Trucks Circled Aquadome Parking LotSO, FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW, WHERE THE AMBULANCE CAME ON THATPARKING LOT IS WHERE THE SPHERE SOMEHOW ENDED UP?Right, and what was weird about it is that I sat there and watched the fire trucks pull up.Well, some of the fire trucks went straight and some took a right.They all came in the same way, but they branched out like they were circling – like theway the fire trucks went in, there is no road. They went down a gravel walking trail to theplayground. The fire trucks were circling like in a blockade, do you know what I mean?BUT THE FIRE TRUCKS CIRCLED, THE HELICOPTERS CIRCLED. DID THEPOLICE CARS CIRCLE AS WELL?They were in front of everything. I never saw which way they went, but it seemed likethey branched off – like I didn’t even see them pull up and park. And then after we parkedour car and came back, the police were there.ALL OF THE HELICOPTERS OR SOME CAME FROM HUNTSVILLE (20 miles east ofDecatur)?All of them.YOU KNOW THAT BECAUSE?I saw them fly from that direction. And I know there is no military base in Decatur. Notonly that, there is one hospital in Decatur and it’s called Decatur General and it has a MedFlight on top of it. But what’s weird is that the Med Flight helicopter did not come fromthat hospital. It did not come from that direction and it did not have Decatur Med Flight onit.IT DID NOT HAVE DECATUR MED FLIGHT WRITTEN ON IT.Right.DID IT HAVE ANY WRITING ON IT?I remember seeing Med Flight on it, but I don’t remember numbers and I’m pretty sure itwas Huntsville. But I do know what the Decatur Med Flight looks like and that was not it.WHAT ABOUT THE POLICE, FIRE AND ALL OF THAT?They were all from Decatur. White, Shiny Sphere On StretcherWas 3-Foot-DiameterThere was also an ambulance and the back of it was facing the road and a stretcher behindthe ambulance. I made sure to look at that stretcher because I knew at that point it waseither going to be something that I saw in the air; or it was going to be somebody who gothurt.On the Med Flight stretcher, the best I can describe it is a giant pearl - a shiny, white"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"sphere. It looked like the color of a diamond and a pearl – I mean, it was really bright,reflected light. Two guys were there looking like they were dusting on it or doingsomething.Spherical white pearl jewel.The two men put sheets over the sphere, they stuck it in the back of the ambulance and thehelicopter took off. What’s weird is that the ambulance and fire trucks were from Decatur.I recognized the fire truck because it’s the fire truck that’s down from my grandma’shouse. And it went towards Huntsville, too. It went completely the other direction. Thatwas kind of weird! The whole thing is weird, but that is especially so because it lets youknow that something is up.WHAT WAS THE DIAMETER OF THE VERY SHINY SPHERE?It was small enough to fit on the stretcher.WHAT SIZE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT – 3 OR 4 FEET IN DIAMETER?I’d say three to four feet.OK, SO THERE IS A HOSPITAL STRETCHER AND ON IT IS AN APPROXIMATE3-FOOT-DIAMETER PERFECT SPHERE. WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE SURFACEOF THE SPHERE WAS LIKE A MIRROR?Sort of. You know when you look at a pearl, it looked like that. But when the light hit it, itreflected off like a diamond does.SO IT WAS SORT OF WHITE .Correct.BUT WHAT LIGHT REFLECTED LIKE A DIAMOND?Just the light out of the ambulance – you know, when they have the doors open and therewas that light.THEY OPENED UP THE AMBULANCE DOORS AND LIGHT CAME ON IT ANDTHEN YOU SAW IT SPARKLE LIKE A DIAMOND?Right. It looked sort of like a crystal.THE PEOPLE WHO WERE AROUND THE SPHERE – HOW WERE THEY ACTINGIN RELATIONSHIP TO THE SPHERE?I don’t think any of the people there, besides the two men, saw the sphere. When all thishappened, my friend, Zack, went and asked a woman there what happened. And she didnot have a clue. She was like the closest one up there and she said, ‘I don’t know. Theywould not tell us anything.’ And a news reporter guy walked around door-to-door to askresidents, but nobody had seen the sphere. So, it was just me and my friend and he won’tsay anything to anybody. He’s too nervous.DID YOU FEEL THAT ALL THE PEOPLE COMING TO THE AREA WERETREATING THE SPHERE WITH DISTANCE AS IF AFRAID OF IT?I would say the distance, yes. Afraid, I can’t say that. For me, sort of. But when the twoguys were in the back dusting the sphere off, they looked like they knew what they weredoing.BUT SOMEBODY HAD TO GET THE SPHERE AND PUT IT ON THE STRETCHER?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I believe that was either the military or the cops, whoever got there first. White Contamination-Protection SuitsOn Two Men “Dusting Off” SphereWHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT YOU NEVER GOT TO SEE THE POLICEMENTOR MED TECHS OR ANYBODY INTERACTING WITH THE SPHERE?I don’t know who the two guys were (with the sphere). They worked for the city orgovernment or military – whoever they were. They had on white suits, but they didn’thave on gas masks, I don’t think.LIKE YOU WOULD USE IF THERE WAS CONTAMINATION AND YOU MIGHT PUTON BIOHAZARD OR RADIOACTIVE PROTECTION SUITS?Something like that. They didn’t have any gas masks, you know? They just had on thesereal long white suits all the way down to their feet. It looked to me like they were dustingthe sphere. The only thing I can think of is that it was some kind of machine dusting dirtoff the sphere.WHAT WERE THE TWO MEN DUSTING THE SPHERE WITH?I couldn’t tell. It did not look like a regular hand-held broom, but it didn’t look likeanything too high tech.DID YOU SEE EITHER OF THE MEN IN THE WHITE PROTECTIVE SUITS EXTENDTHEIR HANDS, OR GLOVED HANDS, ONTO THE SPHERE?No, I didn’t see them touch it, but I did see them rub it with whatever they were rubbing itwith. And when they threw sheets on it, they never touched it. They threw the sheets overit without touching it and then wrapped it up and tucked in the sheet.THEY DIDN’T TOUCH THE SPHERE, BUT YOU ARE SAYING THEY MADE SURETHE SHEET WAS TIGHTLY HOLDING DOWN THE SPHERE?Correct.THEN, DID THOSE TWO MEN ON EITHER SIDE PICK UP THE STRETCHER WITHTHE SPHERE ON IT AND PUT IT IN THE AMBULANCE?Yes, they picked up the stretcher and stuck it in the ambulance.DID THEY DO THAT EASILY AS IF THE SPHERE WERE LIGHT? OR DID THEYLOOK LIKE THEY WERE STRAINING AND THAT IT WAS HEAVY?Well, when they went to pick it up, another guy came to help them pick it up. So, I imagineit was too heavy for two men to pick it up, but not too heavy for three guys to carry. Was Sphere Taken by Ambulanceto Huntsville, Alabama?THEN WHAT HAPPENED?They backed out and the ambulance and two fire trucks went toward Huntsville, in thedirection there. They would either be going to the hospital or to Huntsville. But one ofthose fire trucks is based right down the street from where my grandma’s house is andthat's the opposite direction of where it went toward Huntsville.And this whole thing, from the time I saw it in the air to the time they put it (in theambulance) and left, was 20 minutes at the most. By then, it was 11:35 or 11:40 PM(Friday, April 25, 2008), getting close to midnight. So, whatever that sphere was, themilitary had to be tracking it on radar because nobody saw it crash and there were nocrash marks on the ground. And there was no sound because I was there. So, no citizenknew about it. There is a military base right down the highway toward Huntsville(Redstone Army Arsenal).The sphere could have been something from the military. It could have been like a new topsecret drone thing for a spy plane they don’t want us knowing about that got off course."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Whatever it was, they had to be tracking it on radar.TO BE THERE SO IMMEDIATELY.Right.[ Editor's Note: Huntsville, Alabama, is the home of:a) Redstone Army Arsenal1.
