I was warned that ifI saw the discs coming down to stay away a good distance and then they wouldlet me know when it was safe to come up to the craft.” - Arizona AbducteeArizona Abductee: “Here's a painting on the internetI found that closely resembles one event I had.” Return to: Part 1June 13, 2008 Phoenix, Arizona - The Arizona experiencer, William, says his parentshad his birth certificate that showed 1953 as his birth year. But after his experiences withthe human-looking entity, Zo, and others, William became convinced that he somehowentered life on Earth at a different date under the control of Zo and a civilization based onthe planet Lanulose orbiting the yellow sun, Tau Ceti, only about 12 light-years fromEarth.After his email account in Part 1, I interviewed him by phone for more details about hislife time of interaction with humanoid, but not Homo sapiens, beings.Interview:Fall 1965William: “ At age twelve and a half in 1965, on a cold fall day, was the firsttime I saw something in the sky so large. I was outside stacking wood inKentucky at dusk. There was a full moon already up and coming from myright, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye, turned and was amazedat the size of the thing. It was as big as the Hindenburg – a huge, dirigible-shaped object with no fins on the back. It did not have ribs. It was a solidpiece. It was a lot longer than it was thick. On the side of this, you could seethe full moon glinting off of its silvery surface. The object was parked oversome tall pine trees.There were quite large, round, lights that were a pastel color. They weren’t abright red or neon. It was a soft pastel color and going from the left side to theright side. There were five of lights that would pulse one after the other goingone direction and then pulse again one after the other going the otherdirection. The rhythm was nice and slow. As one light faded on and then off,the next light faded on and so forth. Dirigible-Shaped Craft CausesPine Trees to Whip AroundThe top of the pine trees were whipping back and forth like there was wind,"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"but there wasn’t any wind. The dirigible-like object was probably no morethan ten feet above the pine trees. To the right of the pine trees were somehigh tension lines that ran across the property. And further to the right fromme was a small pond.There was a pasture between me and the pine trees and it was a distance ofmaybe 1,000 to 2,000 feet. The object just sat there. I walked over toward theelectric fence that was between me and the ‘blimp’ and I started talking to it.And the object seemed to talk right back to me, only it was in my head. It toldme it would see me again soon.Then the object moved off directly away from me and was moving against thebreeze that had come up. We were up on top of the hill, so it apparentlydisappeared behind the hill following the tree line down the hill. I wasfascinated by this and completely thrilled that I had made contact. It felt likehome to me. It was one of those phenomenal things that happen in your lifethat you feel comfortable with.That same year, I had a friend named Randy Adams. He lived down at thebottom of the hill on a creek. I would go over to his house and he would cometo mine. He and I were going to meet at what we thought was an old Civil Warcemetery that mid-afternoon. I took off hiking from where I lived going downinto the forest. We planned it out and it was going to take about two hours foreach of us to get there.I made my way through the forest and eventually got to the location. I didn’tsee Randy and hung out to wait. It was really hot and steamy. I had on combatboots, cutoffs and a T-shirt with the arms cut out of it and the neck cut out ofit.I sat down beneath a tree on a big patch of cool, green moss. I brushed awaythe leaves to make a good place to sit because there weren’t any bugs on themoss. I waited and waited and finally heard the crunching of footsteps comingtowards me. I was up on the side of a small rise and crunch, crunch, herecomes somebody. I’m figuring it’s Randy. The person was not walking fast. Itwas just a steady stepping up the hill. So, I closed my eyes like, ‘Yeah, youtook so long I fell asleep.’ I hear the crunching steps come closer and the mossdisturbed as someone puts their foot on it. I’m expecting Randy to saysomething. Zo Walked Up in Kentucky ForestHe didn't and I opened my eyes. There was this guy standing there. I wassurprised, but I wasn’t afraid. I was never afraid by people I met.He (Zo) was maybe a little taller than me. He had an athletic build, but notoverly muscular.IN 1966, HOW TALL WERE YOU?I grew from 5 feet 8 inches to 6 feet 2 inches in about five months, so I wasabout 6 feet 2 inches.HE WAS A LITTLE TALLER THAN YOU?Ye s .TODAY, WHAT IS YOUR FULL GROWN HEIGHT?2.04 meters (80.5 inches), which is 6 feet 8.5 inches.SKIN COLOR?Just like mine, pale. It was not tanned. His hair was long, touching hisshoulders and maybe a little bit below. It was a sandy-blond colored hair andmostly straight. I didn’t see any curl to it at all. I remember that he looked likehe might be from Europe because he had features that were different fromanyone who lived around our region of Kentucky.HIGH CHEEK BONES?Pronounced, but not overly pronounced. He had incredibly blue eyes. His skin"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"was very clear. You didn’t see any pores – just a smooth complexion. Didn’tlook like he ever needed to shave.WHAT BLUE WOULD WE KNOW THAT MATCHES HIS EYES?Blue topaz. A darker blue than the sky, or like a blue LED light – a very clear,but intense, blue. The eyes didn’t shine, but they were that kind of blue.WHAT WAS HE WEARING? WAS THERE ANYTHING LIKE A PATCHOR INSIGNIA?I don’t remember that there was any kind of patch or insignia. There wasnothing that looked like a zipper. There were no seams. It was one continuouspiece that started at his neck and went down to his wrists and across hisabdomen down his legs. There were not any boots like you would think go onover feet. Instead, the leg coverings continued on down around his feet, butthere were soles at the bottom of his feet where shoes would have been.SO IT WAS ONE CONTINUOUS JUMP SUIT THAT EVEN INCLUDEDTHE FEET THE WAY WE DRESS YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE WINTERTIME IN ONE-PIECE SUITS?Right, but this material would be very similar to Lycra. It just sucked right upto him.VERY TIGHT TO THE BODY?Ye s .WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THAT GARMENT?It was kind of a wheat beige-brown color.Using one of the blond illustrations from my book,Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses, William modifiedit to more closely match the beige colors that Zo wore. William: “This is like Zo,except the eyes are too large and his hair was more swept back, no bangs.”Illustration © 2008 by William."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"He had a belt on with a blue light that flashed occasionally that looked like amodern LED light.WHAT DID THE BUCKLE LOOK LIKE?It kind of looked like the way buckles on backpacks push and twist together.WHAT PART WAS GLOWING LED BLUE?Right in the center of the buckle was a little spot, a small light. Here I am justsweating, so hot, and here is this guy dressed in long shirt, long pants. Helooked ridiculous to me walking around like that in the heat, but he was notsweating.I said, ‘Who are you?’He smiled and said, ‘My name is Zo. Do you mind if I rest here a minute? Iwould like to talk with you.’ He didn’t sound like he was speaking with aEuropean accent. He sounded like anyone else I had spoken with in my life.He was very clear.I said, ‘Sure, have a seat.’So, he sat down across from me cross-legged on the moss.I asked, ‘Where are you from?’He said, ‘I’m from quite a ways from here.’I asked, ‘Why are you here?’He said, ‘Well, I came here to see you, William.’I said, ‘Wow! You know who I am?’He said, ‘Yes, I do. But don’t worry. I don’t mean you any harm. I just wantedto come visit with you for a few minutes, if you don’t mind.’I said, ‘No, that’s fine. I’m expecting my friend, Randy, to show up.’He said, ‘Well, I’m sure I’ll be gone before Randy arrives. It might not be agood idea if Randy saw me here. He might not understand.’ I didn’t knowwhat Zo was referring to. I look people in the eyes when I’m talking to people and studying detailsabout them. I wanted to know where Zo was from and I asked him again.He said, ‘I’m from another world, actually.’‘Which one?’He said he was from a place called ‘Lanulose.' (Zo, upon first meetingMichael, said his planet is Lanulose that orbits around the star Tau Ceti.)’ Iasked him how far away that was and Zo said, ‘It’s quite a distance. But don’tworry, I’m no different than anyone else you’ll ever meet in the world. Somepeople are from different parts of this country. Some people are from otherparts of the world. They didn’t travel as far as I’ve traveled, but we’re all justpeople. And people are people wherever you go.’ He laughed.He told me he wanted to see how I was, that I probably did not remember, butthat he had met me a long time ago when I was just a small child. He had aninterest to make sure I was all right.I told him, ‘No, I don’t remember you.’He said, ‘That’s fine. You can visit with me any time that you want to when Icome back.’I asked, ‘How did you get here?’He said, ‘I flew in and I’ll be flying back out again.’‘What did you fly on?’He said what he flew on was down further in the woods where it won’t befound."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"‘I want to see it.’He said, ‘No, you can’t see it right now.’So, I’m thinking, ‘This guy is full of it.’ But I did realize after a certain pointthat I was thinking things and he was just answering me (telepathically).By the time he left – and I’m guessing he was there only about 30 minutes –we were not really speaking. It was just going back and forth mentally prettyrapidly. At the time, I wasn’t familiar with the concept of telepathy and it’slike I went into a very dream-like state. I was not dreaming, but it’s kind oflike the way I do healing now. I go into an altered state of consciousness.That’s what was happening then.He said that he would be back. ‘Be listening, because I will let you knowwhen I arrive.’I asked, ‘How will I know?’Zo said, ‘It will be unmistakable.’ He got up and walked away and told me justto stay there.After awhile, I snapped out of it and said, ‘Why the heck am I sitting here? Ishould be following that guy.’ So, I took off running. Then I heard a buzzingnoise that did not sound like anything I’d ever heard before. It was away fromme and above me, but I could not see anything. Then it went away quiterapidly. And Randy never did show up! I waited as long as I could, but knewif I waited too long, I would miss supper. Then I’d be in trouble, so I took off.That was on a Sunday sometime in the middle of July in 1966.THIS WAS THE FIRST MEETING WITH ZO AND YOU DID NOT GET TOENTER THE CRAFT AND GO WITH HIM THEN?No, not until later. About Two Weeks Later in 1965:“Morse Code” in the NightWHAT WAS THE NEXT TIME YOU GOT TO SEE ZO CONSCIOUSLY?As far as I know, I always saw him consciously. But they have a tendency toput you into a different head space when you are around them. The next timeI saw Zo was about two or three weeks later in the middle of the night and Iheard what sounded like Morse code, but it was very fast. I’m trying to figureout where I’m hearing this from and I walked all through the house. It wasquite late. Walking around in that small house was something that broughtattention to myself and I was ordered back to bed. I asked my parents if theycould hear the Morse code and they couldn’t. Then the Morse code stoppedand I was very puzzled.I stayed awake and about an hour later, I heard the Morse code sound again,louder. So, I figured it was not in the house. It must be outside, so I felt like Ijust had to get out of the house. I got up and went quietly out the back doortowards the out house. I could still hear the beeping code and headed off forthe field. That’s where Zo was parked, in the middle of the field behind sometrees. Silver Disc On GroundWHAT WERE YOU SEEING?It was a disk on the ground.WHAT SHAPE, COLOR, SIZE?It was a dark night, so I don’t know that it had color, but it wasn’t shiny. Itwas a brushed metallic look, whatever it was – like brushed aluminum sort of.It was not highly polished or reflective. The size, I would compare it to twocars parked end-too-end. We had a 1958 Chevrolet and I remember it was"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"about two of those end-to-end.WOULD THAT BE 25 FEET IN DIAMETER?Probably, maybe even 30 feet.HOW HIGH?I don’t know how high it was. The edge of it was taller than I was, so I wouldsay maybe 12 feet high.30 FEET IN DIAMETER AND 12 FEET HIGH?Maybe taller than 12 feet because when I went inside it was big enough tostand in and look up at the ceiling.WAS THE SHAPE LIKE AN EGG OR LENS?Like a lens on the side. The egg-shaped one showed up much later, probablyduring the winter. The disk was bigger though, and could hold four or fivepeople easily. The others were smaller and could hold only two people,maybe.IN THE DISK, WHO IS WITH YOU AND WHAT HAPPENED?Before I ever got to the disk, I saw movement and Zo came from behind thecraft and greeted me about 40 feet from the disk. We just stood there talking.He said that was what he had traveled in, that there were larger ones andsmaller ones. The whole visit lasted a short amount of time. I didn't go insideone of Zo's craft until a year later (in 1966). Astronomy LessonThen Zo started pointing out different stars and telling me what they were. Hewas trying to get me to understand where we are placed in the solar systemand universe. He got me really fired up and I wanted to learn everything Icould about astronomy and planets and the stars so the next time I saw him, Icould tell him something.It was a brief encounter. Zo told me he could not stay long, but he wanted tosee if I would come over and say hello and he was really happy that I did. Iasked him how he was doing and he said he was doing fine. He said there wasa lot of work to do and that he had things he had to do in other parts of theEarth.I asked, ‘Well, can we just take off and you can show me?’He said he could not do that because if something happened and I did not getback home in time, then we would both be in trouble. I knew my step dadwould beat me if I weren’t in the house when everybody woke up. I'm notsure why Zo would be in trouble, though.We walked around the disc. He put his hands on it and I put my hands on itand it felt cool, but not cold. It was towards the end of July and hot outside.DID IT FEEL LIKE GLASS OR METAL OR WHAT?That’s the weird thing. It kind of felt like glass, but it looked like metal. It hadan incredibly smooth feeling to it. If you had your eyes closed, you wouldthink it was glass. But with eyes open, it looked like metal. I could not find aseam on it anywhere. I rubbed my hands on it. The edges of the disc wentunderneath and it was just smooth – no lines or seams or anything. It was notsitting on tripod legs or any legs. It was just sitting on the ground. Danger Around DiscsDO YOU HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT HAPPENSPHYSICALLY BETWEEN THE CRAFT AND THE ENVIRONMENT THATCAUSES TREES TO MOVE SO WILDLY?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"There might be a clue in what Zo said when it was time for him to leave. Hestood outside and instructed me to go back where I’d been away from the discas fast as I could. So, I took off running to about 200 feet from the disc. Hewaved good-bye and said he would be back. He walked around behind thedisc and a kind of buzz went through me. The disc just lifted right up. As thedisc lifted up, the trees were moving like wind was hitting them. Some leaveswere flying off the trees, but there was no wind. The next thing you know, Zowas just gone!Apparently what is happening is that the disc is creating a strong field aroundit that has a charge that causes things to be repelled or pulled towards it. Iknow on many occasions I was warned that if I saw the discs coming down tostay away a good distance and then they would let me know when it was safeto come up to the craft. Also, they would not leave until I was far enoughaway because I’d be hurt by the rising craft.On one occasion, my dog was back there with me and when the disc took off,the dog ran back in that direction and the dog looked like it had been kickedby a horse. He was yipping and screaming and took off down into the woods.That dog never went with me back into the woods again after that.” Continued in: Part 3 - Inside A CraftMore Information:For further information about the human abduction syndrome, please see my books anddocumentaries in the Earthfiles Shop and in the Earthfiles Archive:• 05/20/2008 — High Strangeness in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada• 04/29/2008 — Part 1: Insights from An Experiencer with Greys and Blond Humanoids• 04/06/2008 — Final Part 10: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 04/02/2008 — Part 9 - Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/30/2008 — Part 8 - Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/20/2008 — Part 7 - Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/15/2008 — Part 6 - Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/08/2008 — Part 5: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/04/2008 — Part 4: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/03/2008 — Updated Part 1: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/02/2008 — Part 2: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/02/2008 — Part 3: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 02/22/2008 — Updated: Three Eyewitnesses in Selden, Texas, Saw Two, Large Rectanglesof “White Flames” in Sky• 02/14/2008 — Update: Mysterious Symbols Projected in Night Sky by Aerial Disc NearStephenville, Texas, Local Airport• 02/08/2008 — Law Officers Describe Unidentified Shape-Shifting Aerial Craft inStephenville, Texas, Region• 01/28/2008 — Updated 01-28-08: Viewer Letters About Aerial Craft and Military FlyoversAbove Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas• 01/18/2008 — Updated: Huge Aerial Craft Over Dublin, Texas, “Longer Than 3 FootballFields”• 01/07/2008 — Part 15: In League With A UFO• 12/22/2007 — Part 10: In League With A UFO• 12/16/2007 — Part 8: In League With A UFO• 12/14/2007 — Part 7: In League With A UFO• 12/11/2007 — More Confirmation of May 1974 Discs in Albuquerque and Huge CylinderCraft At White Sands Provi ng Ground.• 11/25/2007 — Part 4: In League With A UFO• 09/16/2007 — Part 5: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/11/2007 — Part 4: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/07/2007 — Part 3: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/05/2007 — Part 2: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 08/31/2007 — Part 1: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured!• 08/31/2007 — Part 2: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured!• 08/30/2007 — Part 1: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 07/31/2007 — Part 2, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards• 06/26/2007 — Part 1: Explanation of the Recent \"Strange Craft\" Sightings• 05/11/2007 — CIA Origin of National Enquirer?• 03/16/2007 — Tenth Anniversary of March 1997 Phoenix Lights: What Was the 2-Mile-LongTriangular Craft?• 02/18/2007 — Part 4: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails fromViewers and Listeners• 02/15/2007 — Grey Non-Human Floats in Air At New Orleans Defense Contractor Site• 02/14/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails fromViewers and Listeners• 02/12/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails fromViewers and Listeners• 02/11/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails fromViewers and Listeners• 01/26/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"• 01/26/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans• 01/26/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans• 01/08/2007 — Updated: Attorney Describes His Encounter with Non-Human Entities• 12/14/2006 — Abductee Jim Sparks's Encounter with Reptillian Beings, Their Warning andPossible Agenda• 10/11/2006 — Part 2: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee• 10/08/2006 — Part 1: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee• 09/29/2006 — Manipulation of Time and Matter by Non-Humans: The Experiences of JimSparks• 09/05/2006 — Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 09/04/2006 — Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 07/28/2006 — 1940s USAF Flight Surgeon's Account of E.
