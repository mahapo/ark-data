Photomicrograph 250x courtesyMorgellons Research Foundation.April 16, 2008 Tulsa, Oklahoma - The mystery has only had a name for about ten years.It’s called Morgellons disease, or syndrome. On March 29, 2008, the Charles E. HolmanFoundation organized a conference in Austin, Texas, about Morgellons and how to raiseserious money for medical research.Symptoms of Morgellons include itching, painful lesions that open up on the skin. Under amicroscope, very small fibers in blue, red or translucent colors can be seen in the lesionsunder a magnifying glass and pulled out with tweezers.Morgellons lesions typically contain microscopic fibersthat sufferers say are an agony of painful itching.Recently, I talked with one of the pioneers in Morgellons research. He is Randy Wymore,Ph.D., Director of the Center for Investigation of Morgellons Disease at Oklahoma StateUniversity and Assoc. Prof. of Pharmacology in OSU’s Center for Health Sciences inTulsa. I asked him if there has been any progress in finding out exactly what thecomposition of the red, blue and white fibers is?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Three Morgellons fibers in all three colors: clear on the bottom, red in the middleand blue on top.

Image courtesy OSU.Randy Wymore, Ph.D., Director of the Center for Investigation of Morgellons Diseaseat Oklahoma State University and Assoc. Prof. of Pharmacology in OSU’s Center forHealth Sciences, Tulsa, Oklahoma : “No, we don't have answers about the Morgellonsfiber composition yet. Morgellons fiber samples have been looked at in our collaborationwith the Tulsa, Oklahoma, Police Department Forensics Laboratory. They have analyzed afew more fibers (from Morgellons patients) and interestingly enough, they claim that acouple of these Morgellons fibers don't match anything in the data base. Does that happenvery often?First of all, I asked specifically that question the last time I was over there and I was toldthat whenever they get samples that they do FTIR spectroscopy and it always comes upwith a match - except in the case of the Morgellons fibers. So, the technology works great.It's the Morgellons fiber samples that are the unusual things in this process.One of the problems is that everyone who does this analysis work is just doing it out of thegoodness of their heart or out of intellectual curiosity. We don't have any large fundingthat would allow many people to work on this full time. As a result, I am constantly tryingto find experts in different fields, of which I am not, to try to move this forward.WE ASSUME THAT POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND THEIR FORENSIC LABS AREGOOD ENOUGH TO ANALYZE EVIDENCE TO STAND UP IN COURTS OF LAW.WHAT HAVE THE FORENSIC EXPERTS IN THE POLICE DEPARTMENT THATHAVE LOOKED AT THE MORGELLONS AND NOT BEEN ABLE TO COME UPWITH A MATCH - WHAT HAVE THEY SAID ABOUT THAT?They are completely blown away by it. In both cases, the two fiber experts at the TulsaPolice Department Forensics Lab, each of them has over twenty-five years of experiencedoing fiber and other analyses. Both of them participated in this, both visually and usingspectroscopy. They are shocked that there could be something like this so far out of theordinary."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"They are familiar with Morgellons and the whole controversy of dermatologists saying,'Well, this is impossible. This is nothing more than an internet hysteria and a subset ofdelusions of parasites.' The police lab analysts feeling as non-medical experts is that thevery thing (fibers) that the patients are complaining about, the fibers don't match anythingin the data base, so they can't simply be environmental contaminants. Therefore, therereally must be some kind of new disease.Something to understand about the police forensics lab - they analyzed the fibers in greatdetail. But what the analysts are trying to do is match to knowns in their data base. Theyare not equipped to take an unknown and sort through all the various peaks and troughs onthe FTIR fingerprint, as it were, to try to figure out what the composition of the fibers are.That's where I need the academic or industrial chemists and material scientists to sortthrough this to try to figure out what the fibers are actually made of. Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy (LIBS)HAS ANYONE TRIED ENERGY DISPERSIVE SPECTROSCOPY (EDS) TO ANALYZEWHAT EXACTLY IS IN THE FIBERS?It might sound odd, but there is a geologist I am working with who is going to do somethingsimilar to that - it's a type of laser ablation that they use on geological material to try to getelemental composition. The process works on a very tiny sample, which many of theMorgellons fibers are visible to the naked eye, but only if you have really good eyes. Theyare about the size of a child's eyelash. So, if you had that in a tweezers and held it up to thelight and you have good eyes or glasses, you can see one, but they are tiny.Basically, what they will do is hit a fiber with a high energy laser, which will vaporize thematerial and it will get sucked up into a little chamber where the spectroscopy is done onit.Schematic of an LIBS system, courtesy U. S. Army Research Laboratory. So, at the very least, we hope to have an elemental analysis done within the next couple ofmonths. All I can say is that definitely, the Morgellons fibers that we have had analyzed -and not just the spectroscopy - but other processes of high temperature exposure to thesefibers can take without giving off any volatile gases. Polyethylenes of all sorts - low,medium, high density - I have not found any applications where over 1,000 degreesCelsius all of the organic compounds have not been volatized away. That does not happenwith our Morgellons fibers. They do not match anything. Morgellons Fibers Don't Vaporize AtNormal Pyrolysis Mass Spec TemperaturesIt is not that the lab analysts haven't looked hard and used the correct data bases to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"research the fibers. It's that in all the data bases they used - and it's not just by onetechnique. It's not just the FTIR spectroscopy. They've also done mass spec calledpyrolysis mass spec. What they do is heat the fibers in a vacuum chamber. Normally, ifyou had cotton or hair or nylon or rayon or whatever - if you put a little fragment of that inthis device, they evacuate the air making a vacuum, heat it and then the various organiccompounds that this substance is made of - as you get to the boiling point, those vaporizeaway, it's detected in the device, and then the data base of compounds is searched to seewhat it most likely is. The problem is if there is nothing vaporizing away, there is nothingto compare it to. That particular data base is somewhere around 90,000 different organiccompounds.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Pyrolysis is the chemical decomposition oforganic materials by heating in the absence of oxygen or any other reagents,except possibly steam. It is used in chemical analysis to break down complexmatter into simpler molecules for identification, for example by pyrolysis gaschromatography mass spectrometry.”]With the Morgellons fibers, after they had gone through this process and the vacuum wasreleased and the air let back into the chamber, the forensic scientists were able to reach inwith their tweezers and still pick up the fiber. It was still a fiber after all this. It had notbeen reduced to ash. Now, the Morgellon fiber had blackened. It had changed its shape. Itwas being affected by the temperature, but not to the point of completely breaking downas normally would be the case. The particular pyrolysis mass spec the Tulsa police labused, they had taken it to the upper range of their machine. I mean, they can't make ithotter.THE FIBERS ARE STILL INTACT AND THAT'S PART OF THE PUZZLE. BUT WHODO YOU GO TO FOR HIGHER TEMPERATURE?A materials or analytical chemistry lab or some organic chemistry labs would be able to dothat. Even for a starting point, if we can get the elemental analysis, or get the FTIRsignatures analyzed by someone who can spend the time to sort through and say, 'Here'ssome double bonded carbons, here's a methyl group, here's a hydrogen and so on. Thatmight give us some sense of what these things are made of.IS THERE ANY REASON TO HAVE NOT GONE IMMEDIATELY TO A MATERIALSLAB AND SAID, 'HERE'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THE POLICE LAB. CAN YOUTAKE THE TEMPERATURE UP AND TELL US WHAT THIS IS?Well, I have to find someone who is willing to do that just out of interest.\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Launches2008 Morgellons StudyThe following is a January 16, 2008, transcript of a phone conference call with medicaldoctors, reporters and CDC representatives to announce “CDC Launch Study onUnexplained Illness.”Moderator: Dave DaigleJanuary 16, 20082:00 p.m. ESTOPERATOR: Good afternoon and thank you all for holding. At this time yourlines have been placed on listen-only until we open up for question-and-answers. Please be advised, today′s conference is being recorded. If youhave any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turnthe conference over to Mr. Dave Daigle, please go ahead, sir.DAVE DAIGLE: Thank you, Laura, and welcome everyone. I′m Dave Daiglewith CDC′s press office. Today, we are announcing that the Centers forDisease Control and Prevention in conjunction with Kaiser Permanente′sNorthern California Division of Research is launching a study to learn moreabout an unexplained skin condition known as Morgellons. This is a briefingfor the working media. And we certainly understand that there are a lot offolks out there with questions, but we′re going to limit questions today to theworking media.Joining us today are Dr. Michele Pearson, who is the principal investigator forthe CDC. And Dr. Joe Selby, who is the Director of the Kaiser Permanente′sNorthern California Division of Research. Drs. Pearson and Selby will provideshort opening statements before we move to your questions. We′d ask you to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"minimize follow up questions until we can ensure everyone gets a shot atasking a question. And with that, I introduce Dr. Pearson.DR. MICHELE PEARSON: Thank you, Dave and good afternoon. I′d like tobegin by providing some background on this condition. Over the past year orso, the CDC has received an increased number of inquiries, regarding anunexplained condition which some refer to as Morgellons. Persons who sufferfrom this condition report a range of dermatologic symptoms, such as skinrashes and sores associated with abnormal skin sensations, such as crawling,biting and stinging sensations and the presence of thread, fibers, other foreignmaterial on or beneath the skin. In addition to these skin manifestations, manysufferers also report fatigue, mental confusion, memory loss, joint pain andchanges in vision.To date, the cause of this condition is unknown, and there is insufficientinformation to determine whether persons who identify themselves as havingthis condition, have common cause for their symptoms or may share commonrisk factors.What is clear, however, is that those who suffer from this condition, as well astheir family members and physicians who provide care to them havequestions, and we want to help them find meaningful answers.To assist in learning about this condition, CDC is conducting an investigationin collaboration with Kaiser Permanente′s Northern California Division ofResearch and the U.S. Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. The primary goalsof this study are to learn more about who may be affected with this condition,the symptoms they experience and to look for clues about factors that mightcontribute to the condition. We believe that the suffering that many peopleassociate with this condition is best addressed by a careful, objective,scientific analysis.Our study will aim to better define the clinical and epidemiologic features ofhis condition. We also will assess the histopathology of this condition based onskin biopsies from effected persons. We will attempt to characterize any formmaterials (ph) such as fibers or threads obtained from persons who areenrolled in the study. Describe the geographic distribution of the condition inthe northern California area. And generate estimates about how common thisillness among the study population.In the first part of this investigation, we will identify and recruit, persons whoare eligible for the study and obtain detailed information on their symptoms,and possible factors that may predispose them to these symptoms. In thesecond part of the investigations, our participants will undergo detailedclinical evaluations which will include a general medical examination, adermatologic examination, a mental health examination, skin biopsies andmultiple blood tests. We certainly understand that these are- those who areeffected by this condition are very anxious for answers. But we estimate thatit could take 12 months or longer to complete this investigation.Let me conclude by saying that this condition is complex, and it may be dueto multiple factors. We are certain that this study will not provide answers toall of the questions. This may be one of many studies that will need to be doneon this condition. Nevertheless, we believe this study should provide someuseful insights and information, not only to the medical and scientificcommunity, but most importantly to persons who suffer from this condition.Thank you.DAVE DAIGLE: Thank you, Dr. Pearson. And now, the Director of KaiserPermanente′s Northern California Division of Research, Dr. Joe Selby.DR. JOE SELBY: Thanks, Dave. And, thanks to all of you who have joined ustoday. I would like to say first, a few words about why Kaiser Permanente′sDivision of Research here in Northern California is delighted to beparticipating in this groundbreaking study.We recognize that we, here, at Kaiser Permanente are uniquely positioned toassist the CDC with the study for several reasons. First, we serve a very largerepresentative population of members in an area with one of the highestself-reported rates of this condition in the United States. Kaiser Permanenteserves 3.4 million members in Northern California.We have an experienced research unit that can effectively identify memberswho have this condition, recruit and survey those members who are interested"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"in participating. And we have clinical research facilities in which the clinicalexams Dr. Pearson described can be performed, specimens collected andtransported to the CDC and to the Armed Force Institute of Pathology.Our study will proceed in three stages, starting almost immediately. In the firststage, we will identify all members who may have seen a Kaiser Permanentephysician with symptoms suggestive of this condition at any point during the18 months between July 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007, and determinewhether they meet eligibility criteria for this study.In stage two, all eligible members will be invited to complete a comprehensiveWeb based or telephone survey conducted by the CDC that examines theduration and severity of a variety of symptoms, reported exposures, otherpossible precipitating factors, emulating factors, including treatments that mayhave been found to help. And in stage three, those with active symptoms willbe invited to come to the division of research for an extensive clinicalexamination including collection of skin biopsies, blood and urine samples.We recognize that many people in the United States and elsewhere arecurrently suffering with symptoms from the constellation that has been calledMorgellons Syndrome. They and their clinicians, as well, are very frustratedby the absence of any clear evidence of whether this is a distinct condition,what might cause it and how it can be effectively treated. We hope that thisfirst study provides a foundation that will begin to address these importantquestions. Thanks.DAVE DAIGLE: Thank you, Dr. Selby. Laura, do we have a reporter queuedup?OPERATOR: Thank you. At this time, if you would like to ask a question,please press star followed by one on your touch-tone phone. To withdrawyour request, you may press star two. Once again, star one with any questions.Our first question comes from Miriam Falco, CNN Medical News, please goahead.MIRIAM FALCO: Hi, thanks for taking the questions. Dr. Pearson, I missedthe top of this, so I may be asking you something you all ready explained, butnumber one, are you—even on the press release, it says mystery disease. Andfrom what was just described by Dr. Selby it still seems is this a disease ornot? Does the CDC consider this to be a real disease?And then number two, this is going to be done in Northern California, but areyou also consulting researchers in other states who have been working on thisand researching this for quite some time now?DR. MICHELE PEARSON: First of all, what is very clearly to us is that thereare a number of persons who are suffering the condition and the symptomsthat we described. Part of the reason, in a large part we′re conducting thisinvestigation is because we don′t know what it is and this is really anunexplained condition. So we′re hoping to learn a lot about, not only theconstellation of symptoms, but the impact of this condition on those who areaffected as well as things that might be causing and contributing to it.So, we are really at the beginning, I think, of a learning curve of what thiscondition is, and all of this potential manifestations. In terms of our work andthe formative work that′s been done around designing this investigation, wehave assembled here within the agency, really a multi-disciplinary group ofexperts representing various disciplines, chronic disease, environmentalhealth, infectious diseases pathology. And we′ve also consulted with externalexperts including pathologists and representatives from the AmericanAcademy of Dermatology.We′ve also spoken with many members of the stakeholder organizations andthose who are effected with the condition.DAVE DAIGLE: Thank you. Laura, do you have another question?OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question is from Stuart Boslow, withKTVT CBS.STUART BOSLOW: Hi, doctors., thanks for taking our questions. My firstquestion is, what type of selection process will you go through in identifyingthose who are not part of the Kaiser program?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"DR. MICHELE PEARSON: This investigation is really going to be confinedto persons who are members of the Northern California health plan.DAVE DAIGLE: Dr. Selby, did you want to add to that?DR. JOE SELBY: Just to confirm it, and to clarify that because one of ourgoals is to determine the rate at which this condition is occurring, we need toknow not only how many cases there are but what is the size of the populationthat these cases are coming from? So we will not be able to see all casesoccurring in the United States or even all cases occurring in NorthernCalifornia. We will see the cases that come from the population defined bymembership in Kaiser Permanente.DAVE DAIGLE: Thank you. And thank you Stuart. Laura, do we haveanother one?OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Forman with theCBS Early Show.ROB FORMAN: Yes, a question, please for both doctors. This has been amystery for some length of time. What was the impetus for, for lack of abetter word, finally saying, “Today we are moving forward.” And, also as Ilook at the map from the Morgellons Research Foundation, I see certaingeographical patterns, what might they suggest to you at this early stage?DR. MICHELE PEARSON: Why don′t I take that, Dr. Selby. It′s certainly,this investigation has, I think, moved slower than any of us would have liked.We are aware that many patients have suffered from this condition. And, I cantell you that here at CDC, we have really been seeing an increasing number ofthese reports over the last year or so. And over the last year or so, we reallyhave been diligently working to plan a systematic and rigorous scientificinvestigation to look at this more critically.Yo u′re correct that based on the self supported information that is on theMorgellons Research Foundation Web site would suggest that there is, for lackof a better term certain geographic hotspots. And part of our reasons forcollaborating with Kaiser Permanente in Northern California is because theyare located in one such area. And their geographic location, combined withtheir research resources and experience, their rich databases forsystematically identifying patients, make them really one of the reasons that-main reasons we chose them to work with.DAVE DAIGLE: Thank you, Rob. Laura, do we have another one?OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from Liz Szabo, USAToday.LIZ SZABO: Hi. I was wondering if you could tell me where these cases areconcentrated. Are you seeing this around the world, areas of the world? Is itjust the United States? And if you could tell me how many reports you′vegotten at the CDC.DR. MICHELE PEARSON: Well, let me just begin by saying that there is nosystematic surveillance for this condition at this point. Much of what we knowabout this condition has been based on self reports, and is based oninformation that has been collected through a registry that′s been establishedby the Morgellons Research Foundation. That registry would suggest that thisis not a condition that is limited to the United States.They have, at least, had patients report that they are suffering from thesesymptoms in several countries, including Canada, several European countries,and Australia. I′m sorry, what was the other part of your question, I think thatwas your- so it does not appear to be limited to the United States based on theinformation we currently have. But, again, there′s not been any systematiccollection of information about this condition.DAVE DAIGE: Thank you, Liz. Laura, next question, please.OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from Helen Branswell,The Canadian Press.HELEN BRANSWELL: Hi, thanks very much. If I could follow up on andthis is a question for a little bit, are there any reports from cases coming fromdeveloping countries, or sort of mid income countries. You mentioned"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Canada. I know we′ve had people report here, and Europe and Australia, butI′m wondering if sort of other socioeconomic countries might fall in. And I′malso wondering if you could clarify something about how you are going to beenrolling people.I think Dr. Selby talked about people who had already presented for carebetween July 1, 2006 and December 31, 2007, dose that mean you′re notgoing to be recruiting people now? That if people haven′t already sought carefor this in that treatment group, they won′t be included in the study?DR. MICHELE PEARSON: Well, I′ll address the question about developingcountries, and I′ll let Dr. Selby answer the questions related to recruitment.We don′t know, and I′m not aware of any reports from developing countries orlesser developed countries. Dr. Selby.DR. JOE SELBY: And I′ll answer the part about identifying cases. Yes, it′strue. We are estimating what′s called a period prevalence rate. So, what is theprevalence during a fixed period of time. And that fixed period of time ispurposely so that we can get the rates calculated in a timely way and getpeople examined, the past 18 months. That coincides with some data capacitythat we are not enabled to use here.But the importance—the important aspect of this is that we need a systematicapproach, an approach that we can write down and define and tell the world,this is how we identified patients. It would not do, for example, to put an ad inthe paper and say everybody who thinks they may have MorgellonsSyndrome, please call. We would then not have a systematic sample. Andthere′s no reason to think that if you did the same thing in Bismarck, NorthDakota, I′ll take a chance, that you′d get the same kind of response. So thatwould not be a useful read. So this is period prevalence rate based on asystematic approach to the data that Kaiser Permanente has at hand.DAVE DAIGLE: Thank you, Helen. Next question, please Laura.OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jia-Rui Chong, withthe Los Angeles Times.JIA-RUI CHONG: Hi. I was hoping two things. One that you could answer theprevious question about how many reports you′ve actually received, that thereare numbers on that. And, then, I had another question hoping that maybe youcould straighten out some of the timelines for me. When was it that, I guess,patients or groups started requesting this? And then, what are the actual stepsthat the CDC took? Because I feel like there were rumblings about starting astudy in 2006, and then maybe a couple of months ago, so I was hoping toclarify that.DR. MICHELE PEARSON: OK. In terms of, as I said, this is not a conditionfor which there is an established surveillance system. So what I can tell youabout what we have received at CDC are really inquiries related to theseconditions, this condition. And essentially over the last year or so we′vereceived about 1200 inquiries related to this condition. What that translates toin terms of actual reports of patients is a little bit difficult to decipher.The Morgellons Research Foundation, for example, would suggest that theyhave in their registry some 10,000 families that have reported—self reportedthat they have this condition. And, importantly, one of the reasons that we aredoing this fairly systematic investigation is really to try to get a better handleon quantifying how common this condition is in a population.In terms of the timeline, one of the first things that the CDC did was establishreally a cross agency task force in 2006 to really serve as kind of an advisorybrain trust related to this investigation. And as I′ve said previously, this is across agency, multi disciplinary group to advise on sculpting a scientificinvestigation and protocol related to this investigation.As I said, we realized and we all would like to have had this move faster. Butwhat we′ve been doing over the last year or so is really designing a verycareful rigorous scientific protocol. And much work has been going on prior tothis announcement. And what I can say now is that we are ready to start, andpatient recruitment will begin immediately.DAVE DAIGLE: Thank you. Next question, please, Laura.OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question is from Will Dunham with"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Reuters.WILL DUNHAM: Hi, this is Will Dunham in the Reuters Washington Bureau.Dr. Pearson, I want to follow up on, I think, the first question that you wereasked. Are you now not prepared to say that you believe that this is a realmedical condition?DR. MICHELE PEARSON: What I can tell you is real is the suffering thatthese patients are experiencing. I cannot characterize this as a syndrome, asdisease. I can tell you it′s an unexplained illness. That clearly, the sufferingthat these patients are experiencing is real. I′ve actually, as part of mypreparation for taking on this scientific lead have actually seen not only as ascientist, but as a physician, a patient up close and personal, and I thought thatwas very important for me to do, as part of my preparation for this. I had readabout it. I had had heard about it. And I talked to numerous patients over thephone, but I′ve actually had the opportunity to meet one of these patients firsthand.And what I can tell you is the suffering and the impact of this condition ontheir lives, whether you want to label it a disease or condition and I don′t—I′mnot so concerned with the label but what they′re experiencing in terms of thesuffering is real. And, I think, it′s important and this is why the agency hasdecided to look into this in much more depth.DAVE DAIGLE: Thank you, Will. Next question, please, Laura.OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from Maryn McKennaCIDRAP News.MARYN MCKENNA: Thanks so much for doing this. Dr. Pearson, you andDr. Selby both said that you′re ready to get started right away. So, does thatmean that you have a case definition? And if do, could you explain for us,what, qualifies someone to be considered, someone that′s suffering from thisunexplained condition?DR. MICHELE PEARSON: Yes, we have a working case definition. Andwhat I can tell you that is also something during the course of thisinvestigation, we hope to be able to refine and learn more about. To be eligiblefor the study, in addition to having been a member of Northern CaliforniaKaiser Permanente, the patients will have to have experienced some of thefeatures that I told you are characteristics of this condition, which is havingthreads or fibers or foreign material coming from their skin either inassociation with soars and ulcers or abnormal skin sensation, such as pins andneedle sensations, crawling sensations. And that is essentially the workingcase definition that we will be using for this investigation.DAVE DAIGLE: Dr. Selby, did you want to add anything?DR. JOE SELBY: No, she got it exactly right. Just to reemphasize the uniquecharacteristic of the condition to date and of the case definition is thepresence of those various types of foreign material.DAVE DAIGLE: Thank you. And thank you Maryn, next question, please,Laura.OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mike Stobbe with theAssociated Press.MIKE STOBBE: Hi, thanks for taking the question. Dr. Selby, are all of thepatients going to go to the same place, facility? And then, what city is it forthe clinical evaluation? Also, is there a follow up study in the works and canyou tell us what that will be and when that′s going to happen?DR. JOE SELBY: OK. The first question first. The clinical examinations willbe done in Oakland, California and the budget includes money to travelpatients from the Northern California region at a certain extent to it that willrequire some travel and some overnight stays, and we budgeted for that. Weexpect some people will probably come from fairly far away.And in terms of a follow-up study that′s really more a question for Dr.Pearson. I′m not aware of another one at this time, although, as Dr. Pearsonhas already said, it seems highly unlikely that this would be the last study.DR. MICHELE PEARSON: Yes, I′ll just say that we really are taking a very"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"methodical and step wide approach on this. And in many ways, we′re sort oftaking two steps back and starting with the basics. There are some veryfundamental questions about this condition that we don′t know. For example,we don′t know if this primarily affects men or women. We don′t know if itprimarily affects the young or the old. So there are some very important basicquestions that, I think, will help us better determine who′s affected by thiscondition. To define the range of symptomology associated with thiscondition. And really hopefully give us some real good clues about where tolook further.DAVE DAIGLE: Thank you. Thank you, Mike. And Laura, next question,please.OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Templeton,Pittsburgh Post Gazette. ‘DAVID TEMPLETON: Yes, thanks for taking the question. The lady whostarted the foundation who early named it comes from the Pittsburgh area.And by all accounts she went through quite a bit of an ordeal to even get thisto this stage. And I′m just wondering if you have this kind of fibrous situationwith your skin, and these other symptoms, why would the medical communitybe so reluctant to say, I mean they were calling it psychosomatic and therewas this psychiatric problem and all of that. When you see such symptoms,why has it been so long to recognize this as a potential problem that needed tobe investigated?DR. MICHELE PEARSON: I think the—I don′t pretend to speak for all of themedical community, but as both a scientist and a physician, what I can say is,I think, that many of the providers who have seen these patients have been aschallenged as the patients who are seeking care themselves. There is nottextbook definition on this condition. There are many hypotheses about whatmight be causing and contributing it. And so it′s been a very frustratingjourney, not only for the patients, but also for the providers who provide careto them.And, I don′t think it′s unique to this condition. I think this is the case for anyunexplained illness where there really is limited scientific information aboutwhat it is and how best to approach it.DAVE DAIGLE: Thank you. Laura, next question, please.OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from Barbara Feder, SanJose Mercury News.BARBARA FEDER: Hi, there. Just a question for Dr. Selby, you hadmentioned earlier that there had been a number of reports within Kaiser, orthat this was the largest group within the Kaiser system, perhaps in thenorthern California division. Can you clarify why you think you have asignificant population within Kaiser Northern California? And also, you know,what kinds of numbers you might be looking at?DR. JOE SELBY: What I said was that, Kaiser Permanent in northernCalifornia is a very large organization covering 3.4 million people in an areathat based on reports that the CDC receives, and based on informationpublished on the Morgellons Research Foundation Web site, that tell us thatnorthern California is a very high frequency area for reports of this condition.So all I meant to say was that we′re very large. We′re representative of thepopulation that lives in this area. We amount to about 30 percent of thispopulation. And so we′re well—and we have the ability to find the members,our members how have the symptoms of the conditions. So, I just meant tosay we′re well positioned.I didn′t mean to say that we had information at hand that said that theoccurrence of this condition in Kaiser member was particularly high, and wewill be finding that out as part of this study. And now I′m sorry, I′ve forgottenthe second part of the second question.BARBARA FEDER: Any sense of how many people you might...DR. JOE SELBY: No, we really don′t. I was just looking at the same map thata previous reporter mentioned that′s on the Morgellons Research FoundationWeb site, the number of cases. And, you know, if you want to be – I meanyou can′t do anything other than be—make a crude estimate from that, but acrude estimate would fall somewhere between 150 to 500 cases, I think, under"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"varying circumstances. So, that′s the broad ballpark that I believe we′reoperating in, but even that could be—even there I could be wrong.BARBARA FEDER: And a follow up question. What size of a sample isappropriate for your study? I mean would you get to the point where if youfelt like you did not have enough patients in your 18 month sample, that youwould open it up? Or try to recruit patients by some other means?DR. JOE SELBY: No. We will do—we′re not going to sample. We′re going totake everybody. And, so in a technical sense, it isn′t a sample. We′re quiteconfident it will be big enough for these- this is a descriptive study, so thereare not pet hypothesis here to be tested. We are collecting data across a wholerange of possible explanations. And for this, even that range, anywhere in thatrange that I mentioned would be reasonable. We would consider thatreasonable for this first study. So, no, we do not anticipate any circumstancesunder which we′d have to go outside this membership. We will do the studyhere and we will report what we find.DAVE DAIGLE: Thank you. Next question, please, Laura.OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question is from Larry Burns with KENSTV.DEBRA NAPP: It′s actually Debra Napp with Kens TV. And my question is,you talked about the hotspots. Is South Texas one of the hotspots for thiscondition?DR. MICHELE PEARSON: I don′t actually have the Morgellons map in frontof me, but Texas—of the states within the United States, California, Texas,and Florida seem to be the areas where most of the self reported cases haveoriginated.DAVE DAIGLE: Thank you. And Laura, we have time for two morequestions.OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from Darla Fletcher,KCBS. Ms. Fletcher, your line is open, please check your mute feature or liftyour hand set.STACY BUTLER: Hi, it′s Stacy Butler from KCBS. Let′s face it, this is acreepy sounding disease. There′s a lot of people out there that are concernedabout this, what is your message today to a worried public?DR. MICHELE PEARSON: Our message is simply that we are aware thatseveral people are suffering from this condition. We don′t, at this point, haveany evidence that suggests that this is a communicable illness. And, that weare launching a systematic and rigorous investigation to learn more about it.DAVE DAIGLE: Thank you. And last question, please, Laura.OPERATOR: Thank you. Our final question comes from Margaret Burbank,CBS News.MARGARET BURBANK: Hi, I′m actually from ABC. But most of myquestions are answered. I guess, my only question is in the press release, itsays that there′s $338,000 that Kaiser is going to have. Is that the total amountof funding you have? And if so, if you′re going to be taking everybody whocomes to you, how feasible is it that you′re going to be able to do a thoroughstudy on all of them and possibly even take samples from them and everythingyou need to get a good view of what′s going on?DR. JOE SELBY: Well, we worked through the budget under those samplesized estimates that I mentioned and that′s the figure that we came up withand that we signed a contract with CDC to conduct. Now, I should say, andDr. Pearson can add to this, that not all of the cost of the study, by a longshot, are included in the money that came to Kaiser. So there′s additionalmoney being spent on this study by the CDC at the CDC, at the Armed ForcesInstitute of Pathology and probably elsewhere, that pay for some of thesesophisticated analysis, the skin biopsies and some of the analysis of theforeign material, for example. So that may help to explain why we′re able todo it.DR. MICHELE PEARSON: Dr. Selby is correct. The 338,000 is a portion ofmonies that CDC had available in fiscal year 2007 to address this condition. In"},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"total, we have $545,000. And in terms of the question about whether this isenough to take everybody, I think it′s important and I want to reiterate, thisinvestigation is going to be confined to the members of the Kaiser PermanenteNorthern California health plan. This is not everybody in the United States oreven everybody in the state of California.We believe that this is—that based on our best estimates, a reasonableapproach, and a good place to star, and a good start.DAVE DAIGLE: Thank you, Dr. Pearson and thank you Dr. Selby. I want tothank also all of the reporters that took the time to join us today, and you aswell, Laura.ENDMore Information:For further information about Morgellons syndrome, please see related Earthfiles reportsbelow in the Earthfiles Archives:• 06/25/2006 — Morgellons Disease: E-mail from CDC and Viewers/Listeners• 06/23/2006 — Morgellons Agony of Skin Lesions and \"Brain Fog\"• 06/03/2006 — Part 2: Bizarre Morgellons Disease: Letters From Viewers• 06/01/2006 — Part 1: Bizarre Morgellons Disease: A Nurse Describes Her Own SymptomsWebsites:Oklahoma State University: http://www.healthsciences.okstate.edu/morgellons/Charles E.
