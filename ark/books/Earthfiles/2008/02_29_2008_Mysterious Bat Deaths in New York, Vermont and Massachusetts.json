February 29, 2008 Albany, New York - Thousands of bats are sick, or dead, in at least20 northeastern U. S. caves. So far, not a single laboratory examining tissues has come upwith the cause of death. The physical anomalies in some, but not all, of the dead or dyingbats are white rings of fungus around their noses and lung tissue inflammation, similar topneumonia.Another physical anomaly that is common to every dead bat carcass: little or no fat.Winter is when bats hibernate in caves and mines. To survive cold temperatures, the batseat as much as possible to build up fat reserves before spending a few months hangingupside down next to each other so close that all the shared body heat helps the bats tosurvive. Bats get so close to each other during hibernation that in the case of Little BrownBats, 300 of them pack into a square-foot space. But being so close together, also meansthat bats can spread disease quickly. Year-to-year mortality rates of 50% are notuncommon."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Hibernating Little Brown Bats crowded together to keep warm,about 300 animals per square foot. Image © 2007 by Alan Hicks.But until now, no bat researcher had ever heard of 97% mortality in bats hibernating in twoor four or ten or twenty different caves - and there is no historic context anywhere in theworld for so many hibernating bats to die with white fungus rings around their noses.But that’s exactly what happened in the winter of 2007 in two caves west of Albany, NewYork. And now, a year later, the white-nose syndrome has expanded to about 20 caves andmines in New York state, southwestern Vermont and western Massachusetts. Those caveshold half a million hibernating bats – and scientists are afraid that by April 2008 when thelittle mammals should be leaving their roosts, most could be dead.There are four bat species dying off in this mystery: the Little Brown Bat (Myotislucifugus), the Northern Long-Eared Bat (Myotis septentrionalis), the Indiana Bat (Myotissodalis) and the Eastern Pipistrelle (Perimyotis subflavus). Since the Indiana Bat is on theEndangered Species list, the mammal specialist in New York’s Endangered SpeciesProgram in the Department of Environmental Conservation is deeply involved in trying tofind out what is causing the rapidly spreading bat deaths.Indiana Bat (Myotis sodalis), hanging from cave ceiling.Image © by J.

S., Mammal Specialist, Endangered Species Program, New YorkDepartment of Environmental Conservation, Albany, New York: “On March 14, 2007,we went to one of our Indiana bat sites that’s not too far from where the original reportcame from. Our staff went in there and a couple hours later, they called me and said therewere dead bats all over the place in there. So, it was really March 14, 2007, that it becameabundantly clear that something bad was going on. By the end of 2007, we found dead batsin a total of four caves within about a 7 mile radius of each other – in a very small area justwest of Albany.THAT’S THE NUMBERS OF 8,000 TO 11,000 BATS DIED?Right. We don’t know exactly how many died. But we had about 15,000 bats in thatparticular cave site and the count was down to about 6,000 by the time we surveyed it inMarch 2007.So, we immediately began requesting surrounding states in the area and our own staffstarted going out to other important bat sites in New York to look for problems. We didn’tfind dead bats at most other locations, but we found two more caves in close proximity tothe original first two caves that had similar levels of mortalities – large numbers of batsbeing found dead.That was the end by then at the end of March, beginning of April, when bats would beleaving the caves and mines in New York state. So, there was not much more we could dolast year. But we contacted everybody and said, ‘OK, be on the look out for this stuff inthe coming winter (of 2008). On January 5, 2008, we had our first report of this problem bya caver in the Albany area and it has continued to expand from there.We now have it in all sites we have checked within 80 miles of Albany, New York, now.All the caves and mines we have surveyed have this bat death problem.THAT INCLUDES SOUTHWEST VERMONT AND WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS?Right. And we have another site that’s 130 miles beyond the original four bat death cavesthat is now affected. White Fungus Ring Around Bat Noses"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"IN BOTH WINTERS OF 2007 AND 2008, HAVE YOU ALL NOTICED THE RING OFWHITE FUNGUS AROUND THE NOSES OF ALL THE DEAD BATS?Oh, no. We call it the ‘white-nose syndrome’ because when researchers went into theoriginal cave, Haile’s Cave just outside of Albany last year, and discovered all the deadbats, of the bats that were still alive, half of them had this white fungus around the nose.It’s very prominent and obvious. The staff came back to me and reported that about halfthe bats they saw had this white fungus on them. And now we have the same thing inwinter 2008, but in a lot more caves.Still-unidentified white fungus on bat's nose, body and legs,as little mammal hangs upside down on February 13, 2008, in cave atWilliams Lake, New York. Image © 2008 by Alan Hicks. Sick Bats Moving from Normal Rooststo Front of CavesBut there are a couple of other characteristics of this problem that were pretty evident. Oneis that the bats tend to shift towards the entrance of the caves, or toward the colder parts ofthe caves. Generally, it’s toward the front entrance of the caves. Bats have a very specificrange of temperatures and humidities that they are looking for when they are hibernating.Bats are very reliable about returning to the same cave or mine every year. They are alsovery reliable about going to the same roost. We have one site in New York we alwaysreference in this regard. I could go there and set up a camera in July and have it focused onthis particular rock and then have the camera fire in the middle of February and everyIndiana bat in that part of the state of New York would be in that photograph. Year afteryear, the bats are so reliable that they actually stain the wall from years and years of use inthe same roost sites. So, when the bats move from the roosts, abandon the roosts,something is up. Bats Leaving Hibernation to Fly in DaylightSo, the bats moving to the front of the caves is one anomalous characteristic that we saw.Another was the bats being seen flying around over the landscape in daylight. The affectedbats – almost without exception – have greatly depleted fat reserves. The carcasses we’vepicked up were so depleted, they might have fallen from their roost into the cave water anddrowned. The affected bats have greatly reduced fat reserves. In mid-February, you shouldhave the fat reserves you’d have in April to May when you come out of hibernation.So, if you are a bat and you hibernate, your life depends on going into the fall with enoughfat supplies to carry you through to the spring. Your life depends on your conserving your"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"fat reserves so you’ll have enough energy to carry through until spring. For reasons that wedo not understand, the fat reserves in the sick bats are depleted so much that the bats arestarving to death. Sick Bats Not Responding to Human PresenceThe fungus – when I went back to the original site this year – there were about 1500 bats. Idid not see the fungus on any of the bats. But they were all crowded forward at theentrance of the cave and the bats did not respond to my presence, which is anotherindication of the problem.Typically, we only do these surveys every couple of years because when you go into thecaves, a large percentage of the bats when you’re done will be awake and flying aroundand chattering and making all kinds of noise. This burns up fat reserves more quickly thanyou would want it to happen. So, you don’t do this very often.When I went in this January on the same route we normally do for our surveys, I got backto the entrance and had not heard a single bat on the entire trip and I only saw oneindividual flying. So, these guys are doing everything they can to not burn up their fatreserves – to the point of ignoring what they would normally consider a threat, that beingus humans walking through. Unprecedented Bat Death SyndromeHAVE YOU RECEIVED LAB RESULTS BACK FROM CORNELL, MADISON,COLUMBIA, OR ANYBODY YET ON ANYTHING THAT’S PRELIMINARY?Basically there is no smoking gun yet from any of the labs. Whatever the problem is, it isnot obvious to the labs. It’s clearly a problem that is spreading. Last year it was morelocalized and now it’s much more widespread this year.NO ONE HAS EVER SEEN THIS SYNDROME BEFORE?To my knowledge - and information about this syndrome has gone out to most batresearchers in North America – I know of no records of sustained and expanding mortalityfrom one site to another as we’re seeing here.FROM ONE WINTER TO THE NEXT.Not only one winter to the next, but being in one cave and then two caves and then tencaves and expanding out from there.HOW MANY CAVES ARE AFFECTED RIGHT NOW AT THE END OF FEBRUARY2008?I’m not really sure because as I glance at my emails right now, the bottom of the list isanother affected site in Vermont. I’ve been out in the field getting samples the past coupleof days. But it’s got to be close to 20 sites.IS THAT CLOSE TO HALF A MILLION BATS?Yes, very close to half a million bats.THE MORTALITY RATE IS AVERAGING 50% IN EACH CAVE?I wish it were 50%!HOW MUCH IS IT?Of the four sites affected last year and we’ve re-visited this year, we’ve re-visited two ofthem and are going to go into the other two in the next couple of days. But of the twowe’ve revisited, we’ve had a 90% and 97% decline in their numbers since the last surveyprior to the syndrome being discovered in January 2007.SO, NEARLY 100% OF THE BATS ARE DYING IN THE AFFECTED CAVES!Yeah.NOW, YOU HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR THE NEW YORK CONSERVATIONAGENCY FOR 30 YEARS. DO YOU HAVE ANY GUT FEELING ABOUT WHAT"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"COULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL THE BAT DIE-OFF?I have yet to meet a bat biologist anywhere in North America who does not say, ‘Oh, wow!This is the worst thing I’ve ever seen.’WHY SHOULD THE CAUSE OF SO MUCH MORTALITY BE SO DIFFICULT TOFIND?That is a very good question. It’s very odd. I want to make sure that folks understand thatthe fungus associated with the nose is not necessarily the cause of death. It could be asymptom of another problem.HAVE THE LABS BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY THAT WHITE FUNGUS?They are working on it.SO, EVEN THE FUNGUS IDENTITY IS NOT KNOWN?Not the last email exchange I had, it was not confirmed, no.SO, THE WHITE FUNGUS IS A MYSTERY AS WELL AS CAUSE OF DEATH?Right.WHEN YOU HAVE LOOKED AT THE BAT BODIES YOU HAVE COLLECTED TOSEND TO THE LABS, WHAT IS ESPECIALLY UNUSUAL?The bats are thin. The bodies are all thin. The presence of the white fungus on someindividuals - I had never seen this before in my career and neither had any of the otherresearch folks. A few scientists have seen it on a few bats in a stressful situation, butnothing on the level of deaths here. Scientists think the white fungus is a response to someother stress, which allows the fungus to take hold. [ See Thermal Camera Research below.] Are Bats Starving to Death?OF THE BATS THAT HAVE DIED, WHAT IS THEIR LARGEST FOOD SOURCE?They eat flying insects. They are rather opportunistic. Generally, the Myotis group – thelittle brown bats, Indiana bats and things of that sort – they feed on small moths, midges,mosquitoes if they are available. Those bats go out and take whatever they can find that’sin the size range of what they typically eat.WE KNOW THAT THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES HAD A MEETINGWITHIN THE PAST YEAR AND A HALF ABOUT THE SERIOUS DECLINE IN ALLPOLLINATORS, WHICH WOULD INCLUDE MOTHS. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THEBATS ARE SHOWING US THERE HAS BEEN SUCH A DECLINE IN INSECTS THATTHEY ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH FOOD?Well, folks have suggested that numerous times. I’m a little skeptical of that, though,because the problem was so localized in the first year – just four caves. And our bats do notspend the summer in these caves. They just winter in there. Some of them go from 50 to100 miles or so from where they spend the winter to where they spend the summer. Thesummer colonies that they form are made up of bats from multiple hibernating groups of anumber of species. So, it seems that if it were a food-related issue on the summer range,then it would have to affect many more hibernating bats at the same time because batsfrom the same summer locations are going to multiple places to hibernate. So, it would notbe just one little site in New York. And if it were a food-related problem, then it was afood-related problem that was very focused in the Albany area and has now expanded outin all directions in just one year.WHAT DO YOU THINK WOULD MAKE THE BATS FLY OUT OF THE CAVE IN THEDEAD OF THE WINTER?They are starving. They are hanging on the walls saying to themselves, ‘I can hang hereand die,’ which many of them do. Or, I can fly out of here and hope there is food out there.And they do and they die (not enough food reserves in their bodies to fly around.) Butwhat exactly has caused their fat to disappear? That's what we don't know.It’s unsettling, this whole thing, how quickly it’s occurred and how it’s expanded.”"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Thermal Infrared Camera ResearchMany top-notch scientists and laboratories have joined the search to find what is killing allthe bats. One of those researchers is Thomas Kunz, Ph.D., Prof. of Biology and Director ofthe Center for Ecology and Conservation Biology at Boston University. Dr. Kunz is also anexpert in bats. He told me what is happening to the northeastern bats is unprecedented. Heexplained that normal, healthy bats in hibernation can be waked up without much problemwithin 40 minutes to an hour. During that slow waking process, the hibernating bat’s bodytemperature will rise from about 2 degrees Celsius to about 39 degrees – depending uponthe ambient winter time temperature outside.He took thermal infrared cameras into one of the New York caves affected by the white-nose-fungus syndrome to study the bat body temperatures and to see how long it took forthe bats suffering the white-nose syndrome to arouse. Prof. Kunz’s research confirmed thatafter four hours, the white-nose bats were still not moving. He told me, “That suggests to usthat those bats don’t have any fat left to fuel even flying outdoors to look for food, letalone move their bodies in the cave roost. Some of the white-nose bats have flown outside,apparently to look for food. But that is very unprecedented for bats to be flying around inmid-winter when there is snow on the ground and the temperatures are cold.” Prof. Thomas Kunz, Ph.D.: “I have attached 2 thermal images of hibernatinglittle brown bats in false color, recorded with a thermal infrared camera. Greenis the lowest temperature in the image (the cave wall), yellowish-green isslightly warmer by a couple of degrees, yellow is even warmer, and red andwhite are the warmest, respectively. The first image shows a small cluster ofbats in deep hibernation. Their body temperature is only 1.5 degrees C. abovethe temperature of the cave wall.The second image is of a different cluster in which two bats are at differentstages of arousal. The one on the left has undergone non-shiveringthermogenesis and has raised its body temperature to about 20 degrees C., atemperature when it can begin to undergo shivering thermogensis. The bat inthe upper right of the cluster is just beginning to arouse, as indicated by the redcolor in the back area.”"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Prof. Kunz hopes to have more data by the end of March and Alan Hicks hopes that otherlaboratories such as Cornell, Columbia and Madison, Wisconsin, might have more clues bythen – maybe even an answer.But Mr. Hicks told me, “I think global warming is throwing Nature so far out of balancethat we’re going to see more and more Earth creatures unable to cope with all the rapidchanges. More and more extinctions are going to occur – and only then will humans see forthemselves what happens when the coral reefs are dead, most amphibians are gone andmaybe even bats aren’t around to help control insects.” More Information:For further information about sick, dying and disappearing Earth life, please see relatedEarthfiles reports in the Earthfiles Archives:• 01/18/2008 — Amphibians Dying Out At Alarming Rate• 10/05/2007 — Earlier, Faster and Deeper Arctic Ice Melt Down• 08/08/2007 — 2007's Warm, Erratic Global Weather• 07/11/2007 — Mystery of Night Shining Clouds - Another Global Warming Change?• 06/28/2007 — Hackenberg Apiary, Pennsylvania - 75-80% Honey Bee Loss in 2007.
