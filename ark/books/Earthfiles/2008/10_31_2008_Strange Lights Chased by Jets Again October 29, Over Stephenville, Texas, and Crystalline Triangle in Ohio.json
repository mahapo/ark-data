October 31, 2008 Stephenville, Texas - Every day since October 23, I have beenreceiving reports of unusual aerial lights in different regions of the United States, includingStephenville, Texas. Eyewitnesses describe patterns of lights in straight lines that change tovertical lines; or straight lines that change to triangular patterns; or spinning discs shootingoff spirals of light; or pulsing red-orange lights; or even a huge, flat triangle-shaped craftapparently lifting a large, glowing object from a hill near Empire, Ohio.On October 29, I was scheduled to interview Jason Rowland who lives in Granbury, Texas.He and his wife had been in Stephenville (about 30 miles southwest of Granbury) on bothOctober 28 and October 29, to sky watch for strange lights since so many Stephenvilleresidents had been reporting aerial lights and jets chasing them since October 23. He wasgoing to tell me about bright, white aerial lights he and his family saw evenly spaced in astraight line on Tuesday, October 28. But when I called him to do the October 29,interview at 8 PM, he and his wife were outside in Stephenville and excited right thenabout seeing more odd lights with jets speeding toward them.Interview:Jason Rowland, Stephenville, Texas: “We started seeing those lights again tonight (Oct.29, 2008, at 8 PM Central). There’s a main one sitting way above all of them. And we sawall the fighter jets come over. They’ve got the blinking lights on them. And the jets meet upwith the lights and they are gone! This one was horizontal this time and they flash on likeheadlights on a car, like they turn off and on. It’s like you’ll see, Boom! You’ll see three orfour lights in a horizontal fashion that turn back off. Then it turns back on and it (lights)are on a vertical fashion. Then we see all the military personnel (in jets) going out towardsthis main thing (big light). There is like one big one in the sky, bright light. And then thereis another one below it that is red and all the military personnel (in jets) started goingtowards that (red) one. I mean, they made contact with it. And they were gone! I knowthey (jets) did (make contact) because I saw the jets go right to it (red light).THE JETS MADE LIKE COLLISION CONTACT WITH THESE LIGHTS?I don’t know about collision contact, but they (jets) went right to it (red light below bigwhite light) and then all of a sudden their flashing lights (of jets) were gone. And I know itwas our military because our military (jets) have flashing lights. I know from being in theMarine Corps that our plane lights flash off and on."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"WERE THERE ALSO FOUR CAR LIGHT-LOOKING LIGHTS IN A ROW?There were four at one time and there was two and then it went back to three again.THE LIGHTS WOULD FLASH OFF AND THEN END UP IN A VERTICAL LINE?Right.AND COME BACK TO A HORIZONTAL LINE?Right. Lights and Jets Also Over Granbury, TexasNow my brother is seeing it in Granbury above his house. And we saw some weird stufflike big, ol’ circular fashion come off the big, huge, bright light. It looked almost like laserspinning, like a blade coming off of there (big white light). It (spinning laser-looking)wasway bigger than than the light. My Mom called me and said – she was freaking out –‘Craig, there’s one over his house (Jason’s brother). There are military jets all around it! Sohe (Craig, brother) called me and said, ‘Yeah, there’s one above my house and military jetsare around it.’ He’s in Granbury and I’m in Stephenville.THAT’S ABOUT HOW MANY MILES APART?About 30 miles.Granbury is hal f w ay betw een Stephenvil l e and Fort Worth, Texas.Granbury has also had several reports of mutilated half-cats in 2007. COMPARE WHAT YOU ARE SEEING TONIGHT WITH WHAT YOU SAW LASTNIGHT (OCTOBER 28).Same thing.”Seven nights earlier on Tuesday, October 23, 2008, phones at the Stephenville Empire-Tr ibune and local law enforcement really began to ring. See: 102808Earthfiles. 3:45 AM, October 23, 2008, Empire, OhioDate correction, not October 24, in e-mail from Tim Comstock: “ I'm sorry if there issome confusion. The day and time of the sighting was almost exactly 24 hours before Icalled Coast to Coast AM. It was at 3:45 AM the previous morning (October 23). Theconfusion may be from working 14 hour days with one day consisting of the combinationof two calender days. My concept of dates or days of the week sometimes suffers as aresult.”"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Empire is a small town in Jefferson County, Ohio, near the Ohio River (red star),east of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In the 2000 census, Empire's population was 300.Seven hours after Brent Chambers and so many other eyewitnesses in the Stephenvilleregion watched between 8 PM and 9 PM so many strange, unidentified aerial lights,hundreds of miles away near Empire, Ohio – a very small town of 300 people west ofPittsburgh, Pennsylvania – 32-year-old truck driver, Tim Comstock, was driving on Route7 at 3:45 AM on October 23, when he encountered an aerial display that elated him withits beauty, but the mystery of what exactly happened still haunts him.Interview:Tim Comstock, Truck Driver, Waynesburg, Ohio: “As I was driving along the route, Inoticed there were a couple of cars along side the road with their lights still on. Peoplewere standing outside their car and that peeked my curiosity about what was going on. Ilooked in the direction that they were looking, which was toward the top of a rather largehill. I looked up and there was a very bright object just above the tree level. I can’t reallysay for sure what it was because I’ve never seen anything like it. It seemedself-luminescent. It was about the size of a large pickup truck and it was very brightwhenever I looked at it. That’s really what caught my attention.COLORS?It was a white light with a little bit of orange inside of it. It had a little bit of red and theshape just seemed so strange to me because it seemed like a biological shape. As I watchedthat shape, it was rising upward. As I looked above that, I saw a pattern of three bluish-colored lights. They weren’t flickering like a star. They were in some kind of sequence, butthey were all in tune with each other. They were very large lights. They were definitely notstars.As the large white-orange object was rising up, it looked like it was going into the center ofthe triangle of blue lights. At first glance when I saw the triangle of lights and rising,glowing object, I could not process what was going on.

Sammis coal power plant between Empireand Stratton, Ohio, along Ohio River. Image © 2008 by Tim Comstock.As the white-orange object got closer to the triangle of lights, I could see from reflectedlight that the underside of the inside of the triangle pattern of blue lights was one object -one very, very large object. When I saw it with my naked eye, I saw the bottom of thecraft and it looked like it was very flat. There might have been some features likewhenever you crack open a piece of coal, there’s some crystalline structure to it. Butbeyond that, there was no visible doors or windows or anything like that.DO YOU MEAN YOU ARE SEEING A CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE IN3-DIMENSIONAL CRYSTALS IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CRAFT?Nothing was protruding. It was just a pattern that emerged, something like a crystallinestructure, but a flat crystalline structure. Like in a cracked open piece of coal, you can seethe structure, but there is not much 3-D texture to it.WHAT WAS THE COLOR OF THE CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"It seemed to be a very dark grey or black. I guess that’s why I would relate it to a piece ofcoal.SO, IF YOU WERE SEEING WHITE, YELLOW, RED AND ORANGE, WHERE ARETHEY EMANATING FROM THE CRYSTALLINE, DARK, COAL-LIKE SURFACE?The crystalline structure was reflecting the light from the object below it. That’s what Ibelieve, but I can’t wrap my head around this thing completely. If I were to draw aconclusion, I would say the colors were from the object that was lighting the bottom of thecrystalline craft as it was rising.SO, THE FIRST THING THAT YOU SAW WAS THE LARGELY WHITE, ORGANIC-LOOKING, MOVING OBJECT THAT HAD YELLOW, RED AND ORANGE TINGESIN IT AND IT WAS RISING UPWARD. AS IT ROSE, YOU BECAME AWARE OF THETRIANGLE OF THE BLUISH-WHITE, ROUND LIGHTS THAT ARE IN YOURPHOTO.Right.THEN IT KEPT RISING AND ILLUMINATED THE DARK, CRYSTALLINE SURFACEIN WHICH THE BLUE-WHITE TRIANGLE OF LIGHTS WERE EMBEDDED?That’s correct. That’s pretty much what I saw and everything was very slow. Thetriangular pattern did not move at all. At one point, it shifted a little bit to the right handside as I was looking at it and it looked like if it turned, it could completely disappear. Itseemed extremely flat. Maybe because there was no light above it, but it didn’t seem likethere was anything over the top of it. A Glowing “Cocoon?”WHY DID YOU THINK THAT THE WHITE-YELLOW, RED-ORANGE BRIGHTLIGHT THAT WAS THE SIZE OF A PICKUP TRUCK WAS ORGANIC?It didn’t look like anything mechanical by any means. To me, it looked like a cocoon.When I saw it, I was trying to take everything in and that’s immediately what I thoughtwhen I saw it – that it was organic. That’s the feeling that I got. I didn’t think it could beanything else. It just came across as something organic.LARGE AND GLOWING AND RISING TOWARDS THE DARK, CRYSTALLINESTRUCTURE WITH THE TRIANGLE PATTERN OF LIGHTS. HOW FAR DID THEORGANIC-GLOWING OBJECT RISE UP TO THE TRIANGULAR OBJECT?As long as I had it in my field of vision, it seemed like it might have risen from above thetree line, I would say a couple thousand feet. I’m judging this because I was in the militaryand worked on helicopters, so I can tell this was pretty low because a couple of thousandfeet seems like a lot, but it’s really not. It seemed like it rose a few thousand feet and thenthe craft – by the time I lost sight of it – it seems like it might have been maybe 500 feetfrom whatever the object was above it. So it was definitely getting closer to the triangularcraft that was drawing it in.DID YOU WATCH THE GLOWING, ORGANIC-LOOKING THING MERGE WITHTHE CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE?I was not able to stop the truck and look at that. I really wish I could have seen how theobject – if they did merge? Or how the whole thing took place and how it ended? But Iwasn’t able to see that. I had to go around a side of a hill, which obscured everything.WHEN YOU THINK OF THAT ORGANIC, GLOWING OBJECT RIGHT NOW –WHAT IS IT?A cocoon. That’s what comes to my mind.WHEN YOU THINK OF A COCOON, HAVING BEEN CLOSE TO IT, WHAT DO YOUTHINK THE COCOON COULD BE HOLDING?I have no idea. I couldn’t guess! But it was big, whatever it was.HOW FAR ABOVE YOU WAS THE COCOON OBJECT AT ITS CLOSEST TO YOU?At its closest to me, about 2,000 feet or maybe a little less than that.AT 2,000 FEET, YOU WERE ESTIMATING – BASED ON YOUR MILITARY"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"EXPERIENCE – THAT IT WAS THE SIZE OF A PICKUP TRUCK.Like a dual cab pickup truck.SO, AT LEAST 20 FEET LONG?Ye s , it w a s b ig.THAT WOULD MAKE THE TRIANGLE OF LIGHTS ON THE CRYSTALLINEOBJECT HOW BIG?About the size of a large shopping mall and parking lot.VE RY BIG.Ve r y b i g .WHEN DID YOU TAKE THE PHOTOS?As I was driving, I actually slowed down to about 2 mph and there was no safe place onthe side of the road. I slowed down almost to a stop and I was able to get a really goodlook the whole time everything was happening just above my head. I was able to slowdown enough to hold the phone outside my window and still have a view inside thewindow frame and I was able to take the three pictures there.I gave the photos to a couple of my friends to look at. I still have the photos on my phone.I sent them to my wife. I went home this week and I would not look at them on thecomputer. My friends were telling me about how amazing they are to look at in the largersize and I just can’t bring myself to look at them.WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF?I’m not ... I don’t know if I’m ... I don’t think I’m afraid of it. It’s something that is suchan awesome thing that I just can’t wrap my head around it. It’s one of those things that if Isee it again – whatever I saw, I started trembling and the hair on my arms stood up and Iknew I was in the presence of something beautiful and much larger than (laughs) I couldpossibly fathom. It was just the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen.TIM, IF IT WAS BEAUTIFUL AND CAUSED THE HAIR TO RISE ON YOUR ARMS,WHY WOULD YOU BE RELUCTANT TO LOOK AT YOUR OWN PHOTOGRAPHSON YOUR COMPUTER?I really can’t explain that. It’s a very strange feeling. I don’t know. I can’t explain it 100%.I can’t really fathom why I would feel this way about it, but it was something that struckme as beautiful and awesome at the same time.I suppose that once I’ve calmed down on the inside, I’ll be able to look at them, but like Itold you earlier, when you called this morning, I’ve even had trouble looking up at thestars because, as you said, it’s a paradigm shift. It’s something that completely changes theway I think about life and the universe – completely! If this, indeed, is something that’s notfrom Earth, it’s definitely something of great significance.WHAT IS YOUR BOTTOM LINE THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW ANDPHOTOGRAPHED?My bottom line thought is it’s a good feeling. I saw a very large, flat, triangular object thatwas picking something up that was here on Earth. So, whether it’s from Earth and justpicking something up they had put on the top of a hill - I don’t know. But if it’s from someother place, I don’t know why they are picking stuff up or why they would have stuff —here. Other People Watching from Route 7HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK WERE PULLED OVER TO THE SIDE OFTHE ROAD?Five or six cars. The people standing there looked like they were stuck, just transfixedwatching the objects. They weren’t moving. They were just standing almost completelystill.STARING UPWARD.Yes, they were pretty awestruck. And it was extremely close to the small town of Empire,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Ohio. I don’t know if people there saw it.
