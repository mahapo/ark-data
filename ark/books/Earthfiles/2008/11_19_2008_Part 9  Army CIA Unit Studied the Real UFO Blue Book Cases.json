I asked him to go over the sequence ofscenes as he remembered them in the non-human autopsy film screened by Stein's CIAboss, Anthony Barden, for the CIA's highly classified Project Blue Book group at themilitary base in the southeastern United States in July 1958.Stein: “The film started with an introduction and there was wording on there, too, so ifyou had a projector that didn’t pick up sound, you could read what the narrator wassaying. It was a very short introduction and started with showing some alien bodies justlaying on wood pallets, it looked like.HOW MANY?There were three bodies.ANY CLOTHES?No, just in their bare skin, I guess you would say. First, we saw one that was – you couldrecognize it like the one in the alien autopsy because it had a damaged leg. He had hishead turned sideways and it looked like he had some kind of injury to the skull."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Thomas Colman Sheppard, Chief Yeoman, U. S. Navy (Retired), was stationed in 1976with Amphibious Group One White Beach, Okinaw a, w hen on Thanksgiving night he and twoother Navy colleagues saw black and white photographs in a file stamped TOP SECRET/MAJIC.He sketched the photographs for me that he remembered, including the one above that shows threenon-humans laying on a wooden pallet. Sheppard said: ”Black and white photograph in the hangarand you’ve got three aliens on skids that have some sort of mat on it. They are in the hangar,right near the door. You could tell it’s one of those old-styled hangars with the curved corner.You could see that. You could see the lines from the top of the hangar where the window is withthose long panes. They gave off a shadow and you could see those lines going down on the ground.”[ See in Archives: 031706 Earthfiles - Part 1: U.S. Navy Chief YeomanDescribes “Extraterrestrial Biological Entities” in TOP SECRET/MAJICPhotographs.And see: 032306 Earthfiles - Part 2 ] When they started the autopsy, we could recognize the three we saw on the wood palletsin the hangar, although this might not have been all of them because I believe there werefour beings in that crash.DID YOU EVER SEE ALL FOUR?No.IN THE FILM WHEN IT STARTED, YOU COULD SEE THREE BEINGS ON ...Wooden pallets like you would put boxes on, but these didn’t have spaces like somepallets. These had solid wood on top.AS IF SOMETHING HAD BEEN PUT TOGETHER JUST TO PUT THOSE BODIES ONTO BE FILMED?The pallets were probably something they already had and just happened to use the palletsto put the alien bodies on, I would think, because in the military you have lots of pallets forforklifts to put boxes and stuff on. Pallets are only a few inches thick from the ground andmost have only strips of wood going across them and are hollow in between. But thepallets the aliens were laying on had solid tops, which would be normally used to pile onsmaller boxes."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WAS THE CAMERA ANGLE LOOKING DOWN ON THE BODIES?Actually from the side. You had the one, two, three bodies and you’re looking across themat a slight angle down.HOW FAR WAS THE CAMERA FROM THE BODIES?From the first one, probably about five feet. And there was one body slightly higher up onthe pallet and then the third one. So, I guess 5 or 6 feet from the first body and the palletswere about 3 feet, so the pallets were fairly close together, so the end alien body wasprobably 8 or 10 feet away.HOW LONG WERE THE PALLETS?At least 6 feet long. The bodies were laying kind of centered in the pallets and had about afoot and a half at each end that was not covered.SO YOU THINK THE BEINGS WERE ONLY 3 FEET TALL?Yes, I would think so – 3 feet to 3.5 feet tall, somewhere in there.WAS THERE ANY INFORMATION GIVEN IN THE FILM ABOUT THE HEIGHTS OFTHE BEINGS?Absolutely nothing in the film itself. It only said they were ‘small, alien beings.’ When welooked at them, we noticed right away that they had six fingers. We couldn’t count thetoes because the feet were together. But it mentioned in the write up that Anthony Bardenreceived that the beings had six fingers and six toes.SO, HE DID HAVE THAT IN WRITING.That was in his typed pages of what was in the film.SO, THAT’S WHY YOU PAID ATTENTION TO THE NUMBER OF FINGERS ANDTOES?Yes. Anthony mentioned that in the rundown – small aliens – I think he said 3 to 3.5 feettall - and had six fingers and six toes.IN THE WRITTEN PAPER, DID IT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT INTERNAL ORGANS?It did mention about the autopsy that we would see that none of the internal organs are thesame as ours.ANYTHING ABOUT PATHOLOGY RESULTS?Unfortunately, that was about it. But when you cut open a human chest, you would see thelungs. But in that general area of the beings in the autopsy film, there was a large organ inthat area they cut out and put it in a stainless steel pan. It did not look like our lungs.DID THE THREE BODIES HAVE RAISED STOMACHS?Yes, all three of them did."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"6-fingered and 6-toed humanoid allegedly retrieved from the crash of an unidentifiedaerial vehicle, described by Ray Santilli as southwest of Socorro, New Mexico, in 1947,not between Corona and Roswell. 16mm frames provided by Ray Santilli of MerlinProductions, London, England © 1996 by Orbital Media Ltd.See Santilli autopsy film at YouTube.Opening Non-Human Skull“ ...instead of having a solid brain like humans, it looked like a lot of branches.We called those aliens ‘branch brains.’”IN THE DISSECTION/AUTOPSY FILM, DID THEY SHOW FROM THE BEGINNINGTO THE END OF THE FIRST CUTTING AND CONCLUSION?Yes, and opening up the scalp and the brain exposed. The body was opened up first andthen the brain and the head – they cut around the head with some kind of device used tocut the skull open. Then they took the top of the skull right off and showed the brainstructure. The brain structure was not like ours. Our brain structure is very compact andsolid. If you hold up a human brain, you have the two hemispheres. After the medicalpeople cut off the top of the skull, you could see two brain hemispheres, but instead ofhaving a solid brain like humans, it looked like a lot of branches. We called those aliens‘branch brains,’ is what the guys called them. There were little strips coming out with allthese little brain nodules on the strips and had two precise lobes, the right and left. Butthey were not solid - sort of like broccoli. Discrepancies Between 6-Fingered AlienAutopsy Film Stein Screened in July 1958 andthe 1995 Santilli 6-Fingered AutopsyIN THE 1995 DISSECTION FILM THAT WAS BROADCAST ON TV, WHEN THEYTOOK TISSUE OUT OF THAT ENTITY'S SKULL AND PUT IT IN METAL PAN, ITLOOKED DARK, SORT OF LIKE LIVER?No, that’s something completely different. In the autopsy film we saw with AnthonyBarden, the medical people did not take the brain completely out of the body.THE BODIES WERE THE SAME IN THE FILM YOU SAW AND THE SANTILLI TVBROADCAST?The bodies were the same, but if the brain came out like a big piece of liver, it was not thesame brain that we saw. The doctors had cut the skull right above the alien's eyebrows andtook the entire top of his skull right off.WHEN YOU SAW THE BONE BEING LIFTED OFF, WHAT WAS THE FIRST THINGYOU SAW WHEN THEY LIFTED OFF THE TOP OF THE SKULL?The brain structure. It looked like a bunch of main stems coming up from the front andgoing across the back, but they were distinct structures like little twig branches with lobesgoing off from them in all directions.YOU COULD SEE A VERTICAL BRANCH AND SEE BRANCHES COMING OFF THEMAIN BRANCH?Yes, and little lobes on the branches and we were all laughing about it afterward callingthem ‘branch brains.’THIS WAS BLACK AND WHITE FILM?Ye s .WHAT COLOR WOULD THE BRANCHES HAVE BEEN ON A GREY SCALE?I would say they were dark grey, not black. They were hemispheres like our brain is, rightand left. But they were not solid like ours.HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE DOING THE SURGERY?Two, and it was amazing because they had long, white, regular surgical gowns on, butwhen one of the doctors turned around, I noticed there was a monogram on his sleeve thatwas ‘WR.’ I asked Anthony Barden about that, did he notice the monogram? Doctors"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"don’t normally monogram their surgical garbs and it looked like a stamped ‘WR.’ AndAnthony Barden said, ‘WR. Oh, that’s Walter Reed.’I asked,’Why would this doctor be wearing a Walter Reed hospital gown.’ Anthony saidthe doctors were flown out to Roswell from Walter Reed.[ Editor’s Note: Walter Reed Army Medical Center (1909-present) 6900 Georgia Avenue N. W.Washington, D. C. 20307(between Rock Creek Park and Georgia Avenue near the Maryland border)http://www.wramc.amedd.army.mil/Pages/default.aspx ] SO, YOUR BOSS ACCEPTED THAT THE DISSECTION/AUTOPSY WAS DONE INROSWELL?Ye s .AS OPPOSED TO THE BODIES BEING FLOWN TO WALTER REED? WOULDN’T ITHAVE BEEN EASIER TO FLY THE BODIES TO WALTER REED?I feel that the lead in on the film, the beings laying on the pallets – yes, that was probablydone at the Roswell Army Air base. But the second part of the film that showed the actualautopsies, they said it had all been done the same day. However, when they showed thefilm in the hangar of the three bodies, before his camera panned around to film the bodies,you could see it was bright sunlight with a couple of little fluffy clouds in the sky. Youcould see right outside.YOU MEAN THE CAMERAMAN WAS AT FIRST POINTING THE CAMERATHROUGH THE HANGAR DOOR TO OUTSIDE?Right, he started filming on the sunny daylight outside and panned around to the threealiens on the pallets in the hangar at the air base outside of Roswell.Now, when we saw the film of the autopsy, it was in a solid room. But one time they werefilming in a different direction and you could look out a small window. A portion of the topof the window was not covered with a curtain and you could see real grey skies. Eventhough they said everything had been done the same day, I think it’s likely that’s not trueand that the alien bodies were taken somewhere else for the autopsies.BUT NOBODY SAID THAT?No. I asked Anthony Barden about that and he said, ‘This is all I have.’ I told him aboutthe sunny sky with white clouds versus the grey sky and how could all of it had been donethe same day. It was a really dingy grey sky in the autopsy film.WHAT DID ANTHONY BARDEN SAY TO YOUR OBSERVATION?He said, ‘You’re pretty sharp and you might have something there.’I also told him we saw three alien bodies there and maybe one was airlifted to Walter ReedHospital where they had a lot of expert medical doctors that were trying to get as muchknowledge from the being as possible rather than having a local Roswell doctor do theautopsy.IN ANTHONY BARDEN’S DESCRIPTION AND IN THE WORDS ON THE FILM,WAS THE WORD ‘EXTRATERRESTRIAL’ EVER USED?No, just ‘alien.’IN TERMS OF THE THREE BODIES, WAS THE WIDE SHOT FROM THE CAMERAIN THE HANGAR THE ONLY WIDE SHOT YOU SAW OF THE THREE BODIES ATONE TIME?Ye s .IN THAT WIDE SHOT, DO YOU REMEMBER ANY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THETHREE BODIES?One seemed slightly smaller than the other two. But generally, they were the same inappearance."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"More Discrepancies: Eyes Not Like Grey Beingsand No Dark Lenses RemovedLarge whites of eyes are revealed after the surgeon lifted off black lenses in Santilliversion of non-human autopsy film. 16mm frames provided by Ray Santilliof Merlin Productions, London, England © 1996 by Orbital Media Ltd.WERE THE EYES OPEN OR CLOSED AS THEY LAY THERE ON THE PALLETS?I believe all three were open. They were large eyes, but not like the huge eyes depicted onthe Grey beings. The eyes were larger and bigger pupils than human eyes. But generaloverall appearance was like a small person.The eyes had whites around the iris/pupil like we have. They were five feet away and wecouldn’t distinguish much more about it than that of the three laying there.Even in the one laying on the autopsy table, I remember seeing eyes that were a littlelarger than human eyes.IN THE 1995 DISSECTION FILM (SANTILLI), IT SHOWED THE REMOVAL OFBLACK LENSES FROM THE 6-FINGERED BEING’S EYES.No, we saw nothing like that. Nothing like black lenses, no. I didn’t see anything like that.SO YOU ARE DESCRIBING A DIFFERENT FILM.Yes, I realize that now. I didn’t realize that when I saw it on television in 1995. I thoughtthat was the same film we saw at the military base.BUT YOU ARE REMEMBERING FROM YOUR OWN SCREENING OF THE BODIESLAYING ON THE PALLETS, YOU DID NOT HAVE THE IMPRESSION OF SOLIDBLACK EYES?No. Autopsy Sequence in Film Stein SawIN THE DISSECTION FILM THAT ANTHONY BARDEN SHOWED YOU, CAN YOUREMEMBER THE SURGERY SEQUENCE?They started by opening up the throat area and came down opening it up all the way downto the belly area. Then there were a couple of cross sections so they could peel the bodyback to get at the internal organs. They took the big organ in the chest first that did notlook like lungs. It was sort of a rectangular mass, all in one unit, took that out and put thatin a stainless steel pan that was shiny.WHEN YOU SAY A RECTANGULAR MASS, DO YOU MEAN LIKE A POUND OFBUTTER?No, not that long, but it was definitely not square. It was longer than it was wide.BUT YOU MEAN THE LARGE INTERNAL ORGAN REMOVED FROM THE CHESTAREA WAS RECTANGULAR IN SHAPE?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Yes, it was the first one they took out from the chest – or what we would think of as thelung area. It was a large organ that was held in two hands and put into the metal pan. I alsoremember seeing there was no intestinal tract like we have looping around. There wasnothing like that.
