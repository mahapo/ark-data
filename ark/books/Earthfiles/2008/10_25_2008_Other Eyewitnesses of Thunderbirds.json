October 25, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Since my October 23, 2008, news updates onCoast to Coast AM with George Noory about “Thunderbird” reports in western Pennsylvaniagathered by UFO investigator and cryptozoologist Stan Gordon, I have received the followingemail reports about alleged large sky creatures.1) Subject: Thunderbird ... I saw one, too, in New EnglandDate: October 24, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“That Thunderbird that people have seen in Pennsylvania, well, I saw one, too, herein New England. About a year and a half ago I saw one and said to the people in myback yard, ‘Hey, there’s a pterodactyl out here! Really it’s huge, I can’t believe it.”Trust me I know this was not a bird of conventional design and I have seen plenty ofphotos of the prehistoric pterosaurs to know this thing at sight.No joke and I don’t drink. By the time I went to get my camera for a photo, it wasgone. I was within 200 yards of it and I know what I saw.I am hearing the replay of your show on Coast to Coast and this is the EXACT samebird that I saw. It was last summer so that would be about 15 months or so ago. Icould not believe it at first and I was taken back by it, but I know what I saw – nomistaking that thing. I know it was very real and it had a wing span of at least 15 feet.The very weird thing was that it was up against a pine tree. That is how Iapproximate the wing span, but it could not fly that way – straight up almost – but itdid and it was flying that way. Actually I thought it was resting by holding onto thetree branches at first. After that I went to get the camera, but like I said, it was gone"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"by the time I came back out.Trust me this thing was a monster in size, huge, just huge! The head was same shapeas you’d see in a movie, very strange indeed. I thought that I would have to pull out arifle to get rid of it, it was that large. No one sees a bird that size and doesn’t think ofself-protection. I would be a snake for that thing.” 2) Subject: Giant bird near Union City, Tennessee, 1998Date: October 24, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“Thought you would like to know that I was watching thunder clouds off in thedistance (in Union City, Tennessee, west of Nashville) and I saw what I thought wasa small plane flying around the top of the the clouds. The wings of the 'small plane'began to flap and I realized it was a bird. It was black and had to be 20 to 30 feetacross, its wings. This was in Union City, Tennessee, about ten years ago. I had ablack triangle in my front yard also about 300 yards from my house.” 3) Subject: “Thunderbirds” on Coast to Coast AM (Oct 23/24)Date: October 24, 2008 7:11:53 AM MDTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“I have studied martial arts for a good chunk of my life and have always been partialto the mythology and history of the styles. In Ninjitsu (the Ninja’s art), they believethat they were tested and eventually given their 'powers' (magical, invisibility, shapeshifting, etc) by creatures that were half-man and half bird (raven) called 'Tengu.'These man-sized 'demons' (Oni) lived in the forest in large nests at the tops of thetallest trees. A young warrior would enter the forest to challenge one of thesecreatures and if they were victorious, the Tengu would teach them the 'higher ways'of martial power. Now, as the myth goes these creatures could disguise themselves as'men' and the Yamabushi (mountain priests) there often thought to be Tengu indisguise. However, the only thing that these creatures could not disguise fully wastheir beaks, which were seen as an abnormally long nose (like Cyrano De Bergerac).There is even a very old text written by a man named Issai Chozanshi entitled 'TheDemon’s Sermon on the Martial Arts (© 2006) .' It is a discussion on martial arts thatthis warrior 'transcribed' in 1729. The text even says where you can find thesecreatures (which forest and where....roughly).”[ Editor's Note: Tengu is a mythical creature in Japanese folklore. Tenguare usually described as either red-faced monks with long noses orhalf-man half-crow with a beak and small wings. Large wing spans arenot a normal feature of Tengu.] "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Center figure in this Sumerian clay cylinder seal is the Anzu-bird,humanoi d w i th l arge w i ngs.
