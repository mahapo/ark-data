It’s very puzzling.We have no idea at this time what the identification of the object is.”- Chris Rutkowski, UFOROM North Tryon, Prince Edward Island, Canada, is marked by the red circleon the central south side of the island province.January 11, 2008 Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada - Canadian UFO researchers say thatthe number of unexplained aerial lights and craft reports in that country exceeded 650 in2007. Of those cases, one of the strangest occurred on Boxing Day (Christmas boxes foremployees and the poor), December 26, 2007. The time was 5:30 PM at dusk. MarieFord-Quigley and her husband were driving near the small town of North Tryon on thesouth side of Prince Edward Island off the east coast of Canada. What happened nextmade this headline on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation TV broadcasts and internetnews: “ Dark spiral in sky remains a mystery.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The CBC story with a link and a video excerpt is at:http://www.cbc.ca/canada/prince-edward-island/story/2008/01/03/spiral-mystery.htmlI talked about the mysterious aerial dark spiral this week with Chris Rutkowski, ResearchCoordinator for Ufology Research – also known as UFOROM – in Winnipeg, Manitoba.Interview:Chris Rutkowski, Research Coordinator, Ufology Research (UFOROM)Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada: “The Ford-Quigley couple had been driving home froman event and they happened to be looking up in the sky and saw an object. This was 5:30p.m. on Canada's Boxing Day, right at dusk, and they saw a very odd circular object thatlooked to be white or grey in color and had what looked like a small tail coming out of it.The shape was very odd and to them did not look like an airplane, didn’t appear to be ahelicopter or anything with which the couple was familiar. The object was moving in avery odd, corkscrew-like pattern through the sky. It was headed away from them goingwestward toward the mainland of Canada across the bay (Northumberland Strait). Theywatched it while driving home and then immediately went and got their video camera andbegan taking some video of the strange, spiraling object.They managed to get 8 to 9 minutes on video before it passed into the west very low. Infact, the strangest thing about this is that half way through watching the grey-white objecttraveling across the sky, it started giving off thick, black smoke. Because the round objectwas moving in the odd corkscrew pattern, the smoke began to form in a corkscrew patternas well behind it. The couple watched the corkscrew-like smoke trail form as this thingcontinued to progress across the sky for the remainder of the sighting. North Tryon, Prince Edward IslandDecember 26, 2007, around 5:45 PMVideo © 2007 by Marie Ford-Quigley"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The corkscrewing disc object, followed by corkscrewing black smoke, was viewed for atotal of about a half-hour. Because it was in view for so long, that automatically rules outseveral explanations, including it was not a meteor.Also, there have been some checks with Transport Canada and the Aviation Board andEnvironment Canada, the weather office there. Those agencies have all viewed the videoand they don’t know what the object and dark spiral were.Even thought it seemed like something crashing, it proceeded very far down range. So it’sdifficult to say where the object would have come down, but we’re fairly certain, it wasnot an aircraft, it was not a helicopter. The corkscrew moving pattern is very curious. Youcan see it in some detail within the video. It’s very puzzling. We have no idea at this timewhat the identification of the object is. COULD YOU CLARIFY SOMETHING FOR ME? LISTENING TO MARIEFORD-QUIGLEY, THE WIFE, AS SHE WAS TRYING TO HOLD THE CAMERASTEADY, YOU HEAR HER SAY, ‘THIS IS TAKING A VERY LONG TO GET TO THEGROUND.’ I HAD THE IMPRESSION THAT SHE THOUGHT SHE WAS WATCHINGSOMETHING THAT WAS SPIRALING DOWN TO THE GROUND, AS OPPOSED TOMOVING OFF TO THE HORIZON?The object was moving away from them, but was also descending. So, from a perspectivepoint of view, it definitely looked like it was going down toward the ground. Eventually atthe very end of the video, you can see the smoke trail just about touch the horizon. Now,whether that meant the object fell into the ocean, or simply passed out of sight around theEarth’s curvature because it was so far away, it’s difficult to say. But the object was goingdown and away from them.In addition, we have since found a few more eyewitnesses who say they did see the blacktrail in the sky. We are trying to track down additional people who might also have seen itbefore it started making the black smoke trail. At this point, we have only found peoplewho saw the black trail. WHEN THE COUPLE FIRST SAW THE WHITE AERIAL OBJECT, WAS IT ALONEIN THE SKY WITHOUT ANY TRACE OF BLACK AROUND IT?Absolutely. It was in the sky without any trace of dark smoke around it. When it wasmoving and they first saw it, the object was starting to descend through some cloud layers.In fact, in a portion of the video that is not on the website that the link is from – the couplesent me the raw footage and you can see the object descending through cloud layers. Youcan see clouds move in front and then behind the aerial object as it is descending. Itsuggested it was at quite a high altitude and at the same time it was making descent.WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE THEM THINK IT WAS A PLANE IN TROUBLE ATFIRST?I think it was the unusual motion. The fact that something was moving in the sky in theodd corkscrew motion.IF IT WERE A TERRESTRIAL PLANE IN TROUBLE, YOU WOULD THINK THATWOULD BE LINKED TO A CRASH."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Absolutely, and we have no record of any crash at all. One would think we would haveheard of something like that.DID THE COUPLE HAVE A SENSE OF HOW LONG THEY WATCHED THE WHITEOBJECT CORKSCREWING DOWN THROUGH THE CLOUDS BEFORE THEY SAWTHE FIRST HINT OF BLACK SMOKE?They said they watched it for 5 or 10 minutes before it started making the black smoke.That's a very long time, so it was moving at a high altitude away from them and then begangiving off the black smoke. The couple did contact Transport Canada and talked to the officials themselves. Theofficials they spoke with had no explanation. Since then, some of the local mediabroadcasters also contacted some experts and some weather and government officials, andnone of them has an explanation for what the couple saw.I READ WHAT THE CBC SAID ON JANUARY 3, 2008, WHICH INCLUDED THISQUOTE FROM MARIE FORD-QUIGLEY THAT, ‘SO FAR THE BEST EXPLANATIONIS THAT THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN FUEL DROPPED FROM AN AIRCRAFT.’ ANDTHEN THE ARTICLE GOES ON TO EXPLAIN THAT SOMETIMES A JET INTROUBLE, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD TRY TO GET RID OF ITS HEAVY FUEL.I’M CURIOUS - WOULDN’T A JET DUMPING FUEL ALL HAPPEN FASTER THANTHE LONG 30-MINUTE SEQUENCE?That’s one of the problems with that explanation. It would be something that woulddisburse quickly. Another explanation that has been put forward is that perhaps it was the re-entry of asecret government rocket that had some problems and exploded on re-entry. We do knowthat two weeks before on December 10, 2007, the National Reconnaissance Office didhave a rocket explode as it was going into orbit. Of course, this spiraling phenomenon wasafter that, but it’s possible it was another secret launch that had gone awry. But we haveno information that this occurred.HAVE EITHER YOU OR THE COUPLE TALKED WITH ANYBODY OFF THERECORD IN CANADIAN GOVERNMENT OR MILITARY WHO HAS TRIED TOSUGGEST ANY OTHER KNOWLEDGE?We’ve made contact. I have spoken with people in the aviation industry through TransportCanada if they had other records? Curiously, only five days before the North Tryon spiral, on December 21, 2007, there wasanother sighting by a helicopter pilot not far from there in Halifax, Nova Scotia, of anunusual aerial object. The pilot spoke with somebody on the ground when he landed whothen contacted NORAD and NORAD actually admitted that they had tracked not only thehelicopter, but the UFO that was seen near the helicopter and NORAD had no idea what it"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"was.We do have some contact that allows us input from officials. But so far, NORAD has notsaid anything about the smoke trail incident.DID NORAD USE THE PHRASE THE ‘UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECT’? THATTHEY WERE TRACKING IT?They didn’t use the term ‘UFO,’ but they did say ‘unidentified flying object,’ yes.I WAS INTERESTED THAT IN THE CBC WEBSITE, THEY HAD ANOTHER STORYABOUT CANADA SEEMS TO BE HAVING A LOT OF UNIDENTIFIED FLYINGOBJECTS IN THE SKY. WOULD YOU GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF WHAT HAS BEENHAPPENING RECENTLY IN CANADA?We certainly have had a number of highly strange reports. Just in the past couple of days Ihave received two additional UFO reports from December. One was from Lake Audy innorthern Manitoba. Another is from considerably further north near the Arctic Circlewhere someone had seen some unusual lights. As Research Coordinator for UFOResearch, we do the analysis and try to keep track of all the UFO reports made in Canadathroughout the course of a year. We are in the process of compiling all the reports into ourdata base, but at last count we had more than 650 UFO reports in Canada for 2007 alone.I do receive official UFO reports from Transport Canada and from the M. O. D. I do getreports from Canadian air force bases regarding reports and calls (from the public) made tothem, but also other military personnel reports they receive. I suspect, though, that I onlyget the tip of the iceberg. So, I suspect there is a great number of UFO reports that are at amuch higher classification level than I am privy to that are being made. Where thosereports are going? I’m not sure.”More Information:or further reports about unusual aerial phenomena, please see Earthfiles Archive:• 12/11/2007 — More Confirmation of May 1974 Discs in Albuquerque and Huge Cylinder Craft At WhiteSands Proving Ground.• 12/08/2007 — Another Eyewitness to Glowing Disc and Military Security in Albuquerque, New Mexico• 12/07/2007 — Part 2: Secret American Military Space Program?• 12/03/2007 — Part 5: In League With A UFO• 12/01/2007 — Part 1: Secret American Military Space Program?• 11/29/2007 — Part 1: Glowing Disc Encounter with Military in Albuquerque, NM• 11/29/2007 — Part 2: Glowing Disc Encounter with Military in Albuquerque, NM• 11/29/2007 — Part 3: Glowing Disc Encounter with Military in Albuquerque, NM• 11/25/2007 — Part 4: In League With A UFO• 11/21/2007 — Part 3: In League With A UFO• 11/14/2007 — Part 2: In League With A UFO• 11/08/2007 — More Unusual Animal Deaths• 11/06/2007 — Part 1: In League With A UFO• 10/19/2007 — Updated: Huge, Silent, Black Triangle Craft Over Youngstown, Florida• 10/17/2007 — Updated: Half Cat Mutilations Persist in San Antonio, Texas• 09/28/2007 — Earthfiles Mail About Cat Mutilations• 09/26/2007 — Neatly Sliced Front Third of 14 Cats Found in Granbury, Texas• 09/16/2007 — Part 5: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/14/2007 — Part 1: Psi Spies - True Story of America's Psychic Warfare Program• 09/11/2007 — Part 4: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/07/2007 — Part 3: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/05/2007 — Part 2: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 08/31/2007 — Part 1: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured!• 08/31/2007 — Part 2: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured!• 08/30/2007 — Part 1: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 08/24/2007 — Orange-Red \"Fiery\" Aerial Spheres• 08/17/2007 — Two Bulls and Several Cows Dead and Mutilated in Manitoba, Canada• 08/01/2007 — Part 3, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards• 07/31/2007 — Part 2, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards• 07/28/2007 — Mysterious Aerial Lights Over Stratford-upon-Avon, July 14, and Farnborough, Hampshire,on July 22, 2007"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"• 07/14/2007 — Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii - Huge, Lime Green Oval Craft Hovered Over BattalionHeadquarters• 07/13/2007 — Iowa Minister Reports Large \"Crab/Scorpion\" Creature Attacked Cow• 06/17/2007 — More Big Basin, California, Bizarre \"Drone\" Images• 06/15/2007 — Part 1: Northridge, California, Aerial \"Drone\" Eyewitness On the Record• 06/15/2007 — Part 2 - Star Wars Physicist Edward Teller, Outer Space Menace And Remotely PilotedVehi cl e s ( RPVs )• 06/08/2007 — More Drone Photos and Other Eyewitnesses• 05/30/2007 — Birmingham-Type \"Drone\" Seen At Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, in Mid-1980s• 05/29/2007 — Final Part 7: Eyewitness Links Animal Mutilations to Non-Humans• 05/28/2007 — Letters About Unidentified \"Drone\" Aerial Objects• 05/25/2007 — Two More Eyewitnesses of Aerial \"Drones\" in 2005 and 2006• 05/21/2007 — Updated: Odd Aerial \"Drone\"?
