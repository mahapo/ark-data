One was standing right next to the bed,glowing a bright azure blue.” - Coast to Coast AM listenerOctober 30, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Since my 3-hour news updates on Coastto Coast AM with George Noory radio October 23-24, 2008, about a green, glowinghumanoid in a western Pennsylvania forest; pterodactyl-looking “ Thunderbirds” soaringover Pennsylvania, Ohio, Tennessee and other American regions; and a beam technologythat can lift animals from pastures, I have received a lot of e-mails from listeners provokedby the details of my interviews, which resonate with the listeners' own experiences.1) Subject: re: Glowing AliensDate: October 27, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comI enjoyed hearing you on Coast to Coast AM radio last week (October 23).You talked about two hunters who saw a floating humanoid form that wasglowing greenish. This is similar to an experience I had about three years agowith glowing humanoids.I woke up in the middle of the night and saw three typical “gray” aliensstanding in my bedroom. One was standing right next to the bed. He wasglowing a bright azure blue and appeared to be rather immaterial. I could notdistinguish features, except for his huge almond-shaped eyes which wereshiny black and not glowing. The other two aliens were standing near thedoorway into the bedroom. One of them was also glowing blue.The other alien appeared solid and was putty-colored with the huge blackeyes. This one actually seemed to register a look of surprise and dismay that Iwas awake and seeing them. I heard you mention the man from New Yorkwho woke up and saw an alien and then telepathically heard, “Uh-oh,something is wrong here; he sees us and he is not afraid.” I was reminded ofthe reaction I observed on the face of the alien I saw. It was as thoughsomething had gone wrong with their methods. He was dismayed that I hadawakened prematurely and had seen them.At this point I screamed and tried to get away from the aliens, which meantscrambling over my husband who was sleeping next to me. This woke up myhusband causing a great commotion, and when I looked back, the aliens weregone. I believe that the glowing aliens were in the process of eithermaterializing or de-materializing in this dimension.This incident of actually seeing aliens in my bedroom has profoundly changedmy world view, as well as my ability to get a decent night's sleep! It's onething to hear about Whitley Strieber's or someone else's encounters withaliens, but to see them in my own bedroom and realize that I am probablybeing abducted is entirely another matter. I can't begin to tell you what it islike to live every day with this kind of knowledge. 2) Subject: Lights Over San Diego October 27, 2008 Approx 7:30 PMDate: October 27, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comTonight I saw some strange lights over the beach in San Diego atapproximately 7:30 PM. I was out running and night had fallen. I ran to thebeach and when I arrived at the beach I was rather surprised to see four bright"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"lights hanging over the water, two on the right and two on the left. My firstthought was that the planets must be in some strange formation, however afterstanding there for a few minutes I realized that the three of the four lightsdidn't look like planets. These three lights were bright orange/yellow in color.I was at “Dog Beach” in the neighborhood of Ocean Beach in San Diego. Iwas standing next to the rock jetty. The two lights on my left were bright,however one was white and probably was a planet. They appeared to be to myleft just beyond the Ocean Beach pier. On my right the two lights appeared tobe on the other side of the San Diego river hovering in front of Pacific Beach.The commercial traffic leaving the San Diego airport flies directly over DogBeach on takeoff, and then makes a turn over the ocean once they havegained some altitude to head inland toward their destination. Because of thepattern of air-traffic several commercial jetliners flew over me and ABOVEthese hovering lights.I watched the lights carefully because I didn't know what they could be and Iwanted to make sure they were not simply aircraft in a holding pattern waitingon permission to land at the airport. I have never seen the San Diego airportpark planes over the ocean in a holding pattern, but I have seen planes at nightaround an airport appear to be stationary lights as they fly toward you withtheir landing lights on. However, when I have seen the landing lights of planesaround airports, if you take the time to watch you will see the lights move asthe planes fly toward you or off at an angle away from you. The lights Iobserved didn't behave that way, they simply hung in the air. Furthermore,these lights were the wrong color, they were an orange/yellow/amber type ofcolor. The appearance of the lights was unlike anything I have seen.I was watch the lights to my right more because I was sure they were all NOTplanets, but some type of aircraft. As I was watch the lights to my right (infront of Pacific Beach) a third light simply came on in-between the other two.The third light was identical to the first two and now there was a row of threelights. After a couple of minutes the light on the end closest to the beachbegan to move toward land and as it did so the light dimmed and went out tobe replaced by much smaller strobing lights of green and red. I watched as thestrobing lights flew inland and disappeared. Since traditional aircraft havenavigation lights of red and green I was trying to compare the lights I wasseeing with the commercial airliners still flying from the airport. The lightslooked quite different the unidentified craft was displaying mostly a redflashing light, which should indicate the craft was flying to the left (since thered navigation light is on the left wingtip, however it was flying to the right). Icould see separation of the navigation lights indicating that there was areasonable width between them, like a wing or wide body, not what I wouldexpect to see with a helicopter.Did I mention there was no sound?One of the two remaining lights to the right moved off north along the coast.The light on the left remained hovering over the pacific off the end of the pier.When I left the beach I noticed the moon looked odd. The moon was low onthe horizon, just over the trees. There was mist in the direction of the moon,there was a cloud half obscuring the top of the moon. The moon looked odd, itwas far brighter than I have ever seen it when close to the horizon and it was apure white color, not the orange hue it normally has close the horizon. Themoon was so bright it was a little painful to look directly at it. I couldn't seeany of the features on the moon, it was just a bright full glowing disk with thetop partially shrouded by white cloud/mist. It was so low it appeared to behovering over the main street of Ocean Beach. From where I was standing themoon was to the south. It was only as I was completing my run home that Irealized I have never noticed the moon to the south before. Can the moonever be to the south? I always see it over the mountains to the east, oroverhead or over the pacific to the west. When I arrived home I checked themoon phase and for tonight it is only 1% full, it is a new moon, essentiallythere is very little visible moon tonight... certainly not the enormous full moonI saw. How bizarre, I have no idea what I saw that I thought was the moon,but it was no airplane or street light or planet or star.I don't know what these lights were, but I thought I would pass the sighting onto you...who else can I tell!"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3) Subject: Thunderbird Sighting, Late 1970s, Youngstown, OhioDate: October 25, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comYoungstown, Ohio (red circle) is near the western Pennsylvania border northwestof Pittsburgh and Uniontown. Ohio and western Pennsylvania are historically famous forpersistent and very high strangeness, including periodic sightings of “Thunderbirds.”I really enjoy all of your reports on coast to coast. I have had only one oddexperience or sighting in my life so far. I wish there were more.But the one was a sighting of a “thunderbird” in Youngstown, Ohio, about25-30 years ago when I was a kid. Because it was so shocking to me, it is asclear to me today as it was then. It actually looked identical to the picturefrom your story on the thunderbirds titled “The Ropen.” I distinctly rememberthe long tail trailing behind it.I haven't told anyone because I haven't understood how I could have seensuch an animal, but now since hearing your reports, I am glad to find out that Iam not crazy - either that, or I have a lot of people out there just as crazy as Iam.From a map you will notice that Youngstown, Ohio, is in the northeastern partof the state and quite close to western Pennsylvania. I saw it for a good 10seconds flying over the trees, about 100-200 feet above them. I even followedit when my vision was blocked by the trees, but could not get a visual on itagain. 4) Subject: Neon Green Object in Night SkyDate: October 27, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comOn Saturday Oct. 25, at 11:03 PM Pacific, I looked to the left out a slidingglass window and I saw a huge bright neon green light coming down from thesky. It did not fall straight down. It appeared to be a little controlled. I did nothear anything hit the trees. There was not a trail coming from the back like Ihaveseen with meteors. My husband and I did take a walk the next day, but did notfind anything. I was wondering if anyone else has reported anything? I was inWhitmore, CA which is about 40 min. from Mt.
