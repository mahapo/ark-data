There around 4:45 AM on Saturday,October 4, 2008, two hunters encountered strange lights and a lime green, glowinghumanoi d “gl i di ng” over a grassy cl eari ng. October 10, 2008 Elk County, Pennsylvania - Western Pennsylvania has long beenhaunted by the mysterious phenomena of Bigfoot, large, black panthers, unidentified aerialcraft in the skies and non-human beings on the ground – including most recently a limegreen, glowing humanoid. Early Saturday morning October 4, 2008, two hunters were inthe Clarion River Lake forest region of Elk County, Pennsylvania, about 60 milesnorthwest of State College. The sun was not up. One hunter had on a hat light and theother hunter had on a Mini-Mag light. Out of the darkness ahead appeared twogreenish-blue lights. Over the next five minutes, the hunters were stunned by whathappened.Eventually, their story reached Stan Gordon, who has lived in Greensburg, Pennsylvania,southeast of Pittsburgh since his birth there in 1950. By age ten, Stan was fascinated byUFO sightings in his western Pennsylvania region that kept being reported through the1960s and the 1973 to 1974 Pennsylvania UFO wave. Stan Gordon’s professional work isselling advanced consumer electronics, but his passion has always been investigating UFO"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"reports in Pennsylvania.By 1970, Stan Gordon had organized the Westmoreland County UFO Study Group andestablished a UFO phone hotline for the public that is still active at 724-838-7768. Fiveyears later in 1975, Stan expanded the group statewide as the Pennsylvania Center forUFO Research. By 1981, Stan founded the Pennsylvania Association for the Study of theUnexplained (PASU), which became a well known clearinghouse for high strangenessreports. Stan also served as Director of Pennsylvania's Mutual UFO Network (MUFON)from the 1970s to the 1990s and was the first MUFON member to receive the MeritoriousAchievement in UFO Investigations award in 1987. One of Stan Gordon's most famousinvestigations is the famous December 9, 1965, crash of an unidentified aerial object nearKecksburg, Pennsylvania. [ See Earthfiles Archives: 102503 Earthfiles and 080604Earthfiles.] Witnesses claim to have seen a metallic acorn-shaped objectwith strange markings at one end in the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania,woods on December 9, 1965.

Image provided by Stan Gordon.Stan says there has been an increase in UFO and other Pennsylvania high strangenessreports in 2008, and this most recent October 4th encounter by the two hunters is one ofthe most dramatic.Interview:Stan Gordon, UFO and Cryptozoology Investigator and Video Producer, UFO CrashKecksburg: The Untold Story, Greensburg, Pennsylvania: “It was about 4:45 AM in themorning. It had been raining in the area and these two hunters were going out into thewooded area. As they walked further into the woods, they began to hear a coyotehowling. It was not long after that the two hunters started hearing coyotes from all aroundthat wooded area. It gave the impression that there were three groups of coyotes out theremaking a tremendous amount of noise with their howling. In fact, the two men even hadtrouble communicating at times because the howling was so loud.As the one man told me, ‘I have never heard so many coyotes howling like that everbefore, even though I’m in the woods quite a bit.’They are proceeding down into the woods and their only light is one Mini-Mag flashlight"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"and a hat with built-inlight. Left: Hat with built-in LED lights. Right: Mini-Mag flashlight.At about 150 to 200 yards ahead of them on the other side of the field, the two hunters seetwo, dim, glowing lights. It was described to me by the eyewitnesses as about the size of abaseball, about two feet apart and about fifteen feet off the ground. The lights were givingoff a glow that they said was similar to the Indigo glow of a watch or speedometer. Kind ofa greenish Indigo color he has seen shine from a watch. They thought it was odd, but mightbe other hunters, even though they didn’t see signs of other hunters. They didn’t see othervehicles when they went into the woods.Central ring glows the “Indigo blue” colorof some speedometers and watches.So, they see these two lights and shut their lights off and are walking further back into thewoods when they see a beam of light like from a flashlight flashing back and forth betweenthe tree line. Once again, they are thinking, ‘Maybe there is a hunter there.’Then within a few minutes of seeing the single beam of light, all of a sudden appears aboutten individual beams of light that just suddenly appear. They are flashing around and seemto be originating from the same point in that area of the woods. What’s kind of unusual isthat it didn’t give the hunters an impression of some one walking around as if trying to findtheir path through the woods. It wasn’t like someone was moving around carryingsomething.Those beams are about ten feet off the ground; they were projected parallel with theground straight out projecting from the original point. The one hunter said, ‘How manylights are there?’ They thought it odd for so many to be coming out of nowhere. At thatpoint, they are confused about what they are watching.As they are watching these beams of light, all of a sudden their attention is drawn to whatappears to be a glowing, human-like figure that appears right in the area where the beamshad originated.One of the hunters mentioned that one of the beams actually seemed to lead the glowingfigure out into the field. The figure moved out about 20 feet into the field of grass that wasabout six inches tall. As the two hunters are watching the moving figure move prettysteadily and quick, suddenly all those other beams of light in the woods vanished. Theyjust disappeared. Lime Green, Glowing HumanoidWhat was described to me was that the humanoid-shaped being looked like the silhouetteof a person, but was glowing a light, lime green color. The witness said to me that the bestway to describe the entity was if you got glow-in-the-dark paint and put it all over yourbody. He said that’s what the thing looked like. He said it was about three feet tall. Thearms were hanging down to the sides and appeared to be longer than arms of a human"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"being. The legs were not very clear. The hunter said the glowing around this entity waskind of blocking out the shape, so it was hard to see the figure. The color, he said, was alight green lime color. He said he and his other hunter friend were walking through thewoods at a pretty fast pace, and yet the way the entity was moving about twice as fast asthey were and it gave the impression that it was actually gliding, rather than walking –gliding above the grassy field and there was no sound they could hear.At that point, they were both pretty shook up and one eyewitness was becoming nervous,not sure what was going on, and began to whistle out loud. When he whistled, he said, theglowing figure moving steadily across the grassy field suddenly stopped abruptly, ‘likestopping on a dime.’ The hunter said the green, glowing entity remained motionless forabout 30 seconds. Then it began moving again about 20 feet deeper into the field and thensuddenly vanished from sight. It disappeared and they never did see it again.Interestingly, he said about two minutes later after the entity in the field vanished, all thecoyotes stopped howling. The coyotes had been howling the entire time. He did tell me later that day, as they kept trying to figure out what they had seen, theywent back to the location to search for any footprints or evidence and found nothing. Andthey were very reluctant to tell anybody. One of the hunters told some people close to himand they made fun of him, so he said he just kept his mouth shut.IN ALL YOUR PENNSYLVANIA INVESTIGATIONS, HAVE YOU EVER HAD A CASEIN WHICH THERE WAS A HUMANOID FIGURE THAT APPEARED TO GLOW ALIME GREEN AND FLOAT OVER THE GROUND?I know I’ve had instances of entities in peoples’ homes that floated. In some cases, thepeople could not see the legs of the entities – the legs were not clear – but the entities wereable to float around in the house. I can’t say in all cases, the entities glowed, but I haveheard similar reports going back many years.THE GLIDING, FLOATING, HAS BEEN REPORTED OFF AND ON OVER AT LEASTHALF A CENTURY AND IMPLIES THAT WHATEVER WE’RE DEALING WITH,SOME OF THESE ENTITIES – ASSUMING IT’S A TECHNOLOGY – THEY HAVETHE TECHNOLOGY TO LITERALLY FLOAT ABOVE THE GROUND.Yes, not just here in Pennsylvania, but we’ve heard that historically from around thecountry and the world. In this particular case of August 3, 2000, around 10 PM, outside ofUniontown, Fayette County, Pennsylvania, where there were five witnesses and thosepeople described seeing out in a rural area a being that they described as about 5 feet tall,human-like, very long, slender extremities, carrying a brown staff about five feet long. Theeyewitnesses observed the entity from about 250 feet away, and there was no apparentground disturbance, but they said this thing appeared to be gliding about 6 inches abovethe ground. They all got a pretty good look at the entity.Fayette County has a long history of all kinds of phenomena. One of the areas inPennsylvania that has re-occurring reports of all kinds of phenomena is along the ChestnutRidge. That mountain ridge runs from Preston County, West Virginia, through IndianaCounty in southwestern Pennsylvania. And year after year, we hear reports of strangeanimal sightings, UFOs, we have all kinds of unexplained booms and sounds along theridge at times and all kinds of strange things that have been reported."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"High strangeness reports have had a long history in the Pennsylvania region betw eenUniontow n and Chestnut Ridge, i n Fayette County, Pennsyl vania south of Pi ttsburgh. Howling CoyotesTHE AGITATION OF ANIMALS SUCH AS COYOTES HOWLING LOUDLY ANDOTHER ANIMALS THAT ARE DISTURBED WHEN THE STRANGE LIGHTS ANDSOMETIMES CRAFT OR ENTITIES ARE AROUND, HAS BEEN A PART OF THEUFO PHENOMENON FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY OF REPORTS.Oh, yes, it has been very prominent and especially in Bigfoot cases during that wave ofsightings in 1973 to 1974. Many of those Bigfoot sightings were at close range - a lot ofthem, in fact, were daylight sightings. Sometimes there were multiple creature reports andmany of them multiple eyewitness reports. Lots of them from Pennsylvania farm country.In a lot of reports, normally vicious, territorial dogs that bark and go crazy when somethingunknown or strange is around, when there were Bigfoot sightings, the dogs were hidingback in their pens. They would not bark. They would not move. Sometimes for daysafterward, the dogs would not eat properly. I have witnessed that myself. Police officersworking on Bigfoot sighting cases back then reported that to us. That's significant becausepeople can be fooled, but animals cannot. August to September 2008 Pennsylvania UFO ReportsI receive reports of UFO sightings every year all year round. In recent weeks, we’ve had alot of reports of the bright planet Jupiter in the sky (laughs). But we’ve had some veryinteresting other reports that seem pretty significant in recent weeks and months. ThisAugust 12th sighting – this is a person who lives between Greensburg and Youngwood. It’sabout 2 AM and the person is about to go to bed and notices this bright light shining in thewindow. He goes over to look out to observe what was described as like two, hugeheadlights side-by-side, kind of giving off a yellow cast, but it was right across the road ata neighbor’s house very low right above the ground.There is no sound. They are looking for rotor blades, but it’s close enough for him to seethere are no rotor blades. After several minutes, the lights rose up very slowly and beganto move off into the sky over the trees. September 5, 2008Then we had a number of reports by independent people in early morning hours ofSeptember 5, 2008. We had reports that came in from Allegheny and WestmorelandCounties. One at 12:30 AM was pretty interesting. An eyewitness first observed in the skyin the distance what looked like some kind of fire in the sky above the tree line. Later on, Ireceived another report of something similar. Then the person observed this object that"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"came in the western sky. It was round, glowing white, had flashing red and blue lights atthe bottom and as he watched it, the light just suddenly vanished. It was described as ifsomeone turned off a power switch.And then a short time later, a second object appeared to the south. This thing was largerthan the other. It appeared to be football-shaped and moved quite fast and began to dropcloser to the ground in the distance. With binoculars, the eyewitness could see this was asolid, perfectly round, glowing white object with glowing red, rectangular lights that didnot flash. The rectangles were evenly spaced around the outside perimeter.Interestingly, almost at the same time, I received a report from a driver in the South Parksection of Pittsburgh in Allegheny County. He was driving through an intersection when allof a sudden he caught these bright lights up in the top corner of his windshield. What everthey were, they were not more than 100 feet above his vehicle. He said the bright lightswere evenly spaced. He said the best way to describe it is if you took a normal piece oftyping paper and put a bright light at each corner, that would be the best way to mimicwhat he saw. The lights moved right in front of him right over his vehicle. He said eachlight was about 3 feet in diameter. The lights did not blink. There was absolutely no sound.At first, he wondered if it were a helicopter, so he put his window down and stuck his headout and there was no sound. He saw the lights go across (in front of him) and he estimatedthe lights were attached to an object that was maybe 20 feet wide and 50 feet long. Atsome point, it made a sharp bank and accelerated into the sky above the trees.Then at 2:50 AM (September 5, 2008), from outside Jeannette - again in WestmorelandCounty - another eyewitness saw a large, orange ball of light moving quite slowly. In fact,he said it was a very clear morning and he estimated the orange light was about 1,000 feethigh moving east to west, almost like floating in the sky.He described it close to another eyewitness who said as he watched this thing, it justsuddenly vanished right in front of his eyes like somebody turning off a switch. Source of UFO Phenomenon?STAN, YOU HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THE UNIDENTIFIED FLYING OBJECTSAND RELATED HIGH STRANGENESS PHENOMENA FOR 49 YEARS, SINCE YOUWERE 10 YEARS OLD. TODAY, IN OCTOBER 2008, WHAT IS YOUR OWNPERSONAL FEELING NOW ABOUT THE SOURCE OF THE CRAFT, THE ENTITIESAND WHAT IS GOING ON BETWEEN NON-HUMAN ENTITIES AND EARTH LIFE?My feeling on the UFO phenomenon is after you eliminate all the IFOs (identified flyingobjects), all the cases you can explain away, there is still that percentage of cases youcannot easily dismiss. My feeling has been for quite awhile now that there is no ONEorigin for these unexplained phenomena.I think it’s possible that at least a small number of these might be extraterrestrialspacecraft. Some could be unknown natural phenomena. And some of these could be timetravelers or could be inter-dimensional.But again, we have a lot of cases over the years we’ve investigated where we have anobject, a solid craft, sometimes in broad daylight, where the craft physically changed formto a completely different form; or the craft has appeared and disappeared.Most people, when they are talking about UFOs, they are talking about very largecylindrical-shaped objects, dome-shaped objects, typical flying saucers; the cigar-shapedthings; the rectangular objects – and people think they are all 20 to 30 or hundreds of feetin length.But, we’ve had many cases of these very small, spherical objects – a few inches to a footin diameter, maybe as big as a basketball in diameter. I’ve had cases of these thingscoming into peoples’ homes and flying around. I’ve had cases of people in cars havingtheir windows down and these spheres going inside the cars and floating around.There was a really interesting case years ago we looked into and a woman reported thatone of the small spheres came into her kitchen and was floating around. She got a broomand smacked it. She said it actually split in two and the two separate, spherical objectsfloated around and went back out the kitchen window and disappeared.”Stan Gordon's Pennsylvania Hotline: 724-838-7768Stan Gordon's Website: http://www.stangordonufo.comStan Gordon's Email: paufo@comcast.net"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" Continued in Part 2 - “Thunderbird” Sightings in PennsylvaniaMore Information:I also welcome reports of such Thunderbird or other unusual creature sightings.
