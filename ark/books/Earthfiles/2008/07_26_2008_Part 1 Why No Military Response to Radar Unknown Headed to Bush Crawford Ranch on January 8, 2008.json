July 26, 2008 Littleton, Colorado - Back in early January to mid-February 2008, a seriesof unidentified aerial lights and strange craft were reported by dozens of eyewitnesses inthe Stephenville, Dublin, and Selden region southwest of Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas. Oneespecially active date was January 8, 2008, beginning a few minutes after 6 PM Centralwith three eyewitnesses sitting on a hill in Selden southeast east of Stephenville andstraight east of Dublin.One of those eyewitnesses was Steve Allen, a pilot, businessman and long-time resident ofnearby Glen Rose. He is accustomed to watching civilian and military air traffic, but sayshe has never seen anything like the aerial display on January 8. He and two friends wererelaxing after work on a Selden hillside when four bright lights in a rectangle pattern camerapidly from the east, either flying in formation or were one huge aircraft. Steve estimatedthe long side of the rectangular pattern of bright, white lights to be a mile long. [ See022208 Updated Earthfiles.] Selden, Texas, hillside and campfire, estimated time 6:12 PM Central, on January 8, 2008.Eyewitnesses of four bright lights in mile-long by 1/2-mile wide rectangle patternwere Steve Allen, Mike Odam and Lance Jones. Sketch © 2008 for Earthfiles by Steve Allen. The lights came in from the east rapidly, seemed to hover, changed patterns and evenmorphed into what looked like two vertical windows filled with white fire. After creating ascene that Steve Allen said looked like something out of the Bible, the fiery windowsreturned to a pattern of bright lights that took off rapidly toward Stephenville to the west.Within ten minutes, the lights returned. But this time there were vivid red and glowinghalf-spheres and Steve said two F-16 jets came roaring toward the lights with after burnerson high and seemed to chase after the lights, which moved rapidly to the east. Steve said itas if the lights and jets were in front of him on the Selden hill and the next second, thelights were near the horizon with the two jets trying to catch up."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Around 6:25 PM, the four bright, white lights of the original mile-long by one-half-milewide rectangle pattern returned with two of the lights surrounded by an unusual red glow.Coming at high speed with afterburners glowing were two F-16 jets that took off afterthe rectangle of lights. Sketch © 2008 for Earthfiles by Steve Allen. There were several other UFO eyewitness reports that night until at least 8 PM Central,which were reported by Angelia Joiner when she worked for the Stephenville Empire-Tr ibune. By January 14, 2008, news about the Stephenville UFO events was picked up byAssociated Press and quickly spread to all the TV networks and beyond to internationalheadlines.One man in Littleton, Colorado, who was following the Stephenville, Texas, phenomenawas Glen Schulze, a semi-retired radar specialist. Glen received a B.S. degree in electricalengineering from Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri in 1952. Then he wasdrafted into the U. S. Army from September 1952 to 1954. He was assigned to assist in thetest and evaluation of the Chain Radar Network at the White Sands Missile Range in NewMexico. A decade later from 1965 to 1971, he worked at Cape Canaveral for the NASAApollo program in which he produced re-entry instrumentation recordings. As Apolloclosed down, Glen went to work for Martin-Marietta in Littleton, Colorado, in support ofSkylab the first space station the United States launched into orbit from 1973 to 1979, tostudy the sun and effects of microgravity. Glen Schulze supported the tape recording ofkey instrumentation data acquired by Skylab sensors for science reports.Glen is very familiar with analyzing Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) radar recordsbecause he has been involved with other investigations of the July 17, 1996, TWA 800 airexplosion; the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks at the New York City World TradeCenter, the Pentagon and the airliner over Pennsylvania; and the November 7, 2006,appearance of an unidentified, spinning, white disc above United Airline's C-17 gate atChicago O'Hare Airport.Glen knows that on January 8, 2008, the Federal Aviation Administration’s radar beacons,designed to help air traffic controllers reduce air congestion around airports, would havereceived whatever transponder beacon signals were sent from civilian and military aircraftin the greater Dallas/Fort Worth and Stephenville region. Glen also knew that FAA radartapes can be re-used within fourteen days. So, if he was to get any usable data, it wasurgent that he file a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request immediately."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"This ASR-9 radar antenna system is a typical ground radar installedat air traffic control facilities. The ladder-like top section is the secondarysurveillance radars (SSR) directional antenna, which interrogates and listens for anyreplies. The remainder of the assembly makes up the primary surveillance radar (PSR) antenna.The system consists of transponders, which are automatic devices that receive aninterrogation, decode it, decide whether to reply, and then respond with therequested information when appropriate. Image source FAA. Glen Schulze mailed his FOIA request on January 16, 2008, for data from the five AirRoute Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) antennas that were within 250 nautical miles ofStephenville, Texas. He received 2.5 million radar data returns. To help analyze the data and compare it to the many January 8, 2008, eyewitness accountsof strange aerial phenomena, MUFON Research Director, Robert Powell, joined in theeffort. Robert, 54, received a B. S. in Chemistry from Southeastern Oklahoma StateUniversity in 1976. He has worked in the semi-conductor industry for almost thirty years.Both men wanted to know if the FAA radar data would produce “skin-paint” tracks (radarreflection off surfaces, not a transponder beep) of unknown objects that were not usingtransponders. By definition, an unknown object would be one that painted a track on theFAA radar but did not give off any transponder beeps, as all other normal civilian airtraffic would – and most military traffic. If there were unknowns, then Robert Powellwanted to study their latitude and longitude data to calculate speeds, directions andtimelines to compare with eyewitness accounts.After hundreds of research hours, in July 2008 Glen Schulze and Robert Powell releasedtheir formal report through MUFON, the Mutual UFO Network, that includes graphics,which can be seen in its entirety at the MUFON website, www.mufon.com.Glen Schulze and Robert Powell did find FAA radar unknowns that don’t match up to anyknown civilian or military aircraft. One unknown traveled for nearly an hour very slowlyon a straight track toward the President George W. Bush ranch in Crawford, Texas, east ofStephenville."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Aviation map of restricted air space inside white circle around President George W. Bushranch in Crawford, Texas, 65 miles southeast of Stephenville (upper left map).Excerpt of reporter Angelia Joiner's Stephenville, Texas, interviewwith Major Karl Lewis, NAS JRB Fort Worth, that was summarizedin an Associated Press wire story distributed nationally on January 14, 2008.Interviews:Glen Schulze, Semi-Retired Electrical Engineer and Radar Specialist, Littleton,Colorado: “The first thing that drove me in that direction was Major Karl Lewis at theCarswell AFB installation saying within two days that they had no airplanes in the air. AndI said, ‘Wait a minute! This sounds like Roswell all over again.Here we have people on the ground saying they are seeing all this activity and the UnitedStates Air Force is saying, ‘Oh, we didn’t have anything in the air.’ So I said, ‘If there isanything in the air, the FAA radar is going to show it. So, I went out and followed theFOIA procedure on two different FAA facilities: the Air Route Traffic Control Center inFort Worth, which is responsible for all of Texas plus adjoining states with about 16different rotating antennas.And I sent in a second stand alone FOIA to the Dallas/Fort Worth TRACON staff(Terminal Radar Control), which is a completely different building with a completelydifferent set of technicians. These are the people who are right at the DFW runwayscontrolling the landings and takeoffs of the airplanes.I received data from five completely different FAA antenna towers and that totaled up toover 2.5 million returns. I had also requested five additional and different antenna data,which I did not get. So, I got the five from the Air Route Traffic Control Center, but I gotnothing that I requested from the DFW TRACON.DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DIDN’T GET ANY OF THAT DATA?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I can tell you what they told me. They told me that my TRACON requests had arrived toolate to their technical staff and that the data was no longer available. They did not say thedata had been recorded over. They said the data was no longer available, which made mefeel a little unhappy because both of my FOIAs – the one that succeeded with the AirRoute Traffic Control Center – which got me 2.5 million data returns – and the secondone, which got me nothing.So, two different stand alone FOIAS. One succeeded. One did not. Both went out in thesame envelope of transmittal.IS IT CORRECT MY UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU ACTED SO QUICKLYBECAUSE YOU KNEW THAT IN MANY CASES RADAR TAPES WOULD BEERASED AND RE-USED AND YOU WANTED TO ACT BEFORE THE FOURTEENDAYS WERE UP?Exactly. Discovery of Unknownsin Stephenville Radar DataWHEN DID YOU FIRST REALIZE THAT YOU WERE DEALING WITHUNKNOWNS?Probably two or three months into the exercise and it was a very difficult task – not onlybecause of the volume of returns we had – but the fact that we had sort of an equalnumber - and this is sort of incredible – we had an equal number of beacon returns thatwere being received from cooperative airplanes in the air that had beacons that when theygot scanned from the ground, the beacon went back and said, ‘Here I am and here is my4-digit pin numberTHIS IS WHAT COMES FROM THE TRANSPONDERS IN CIVILIAN AND MILITARYPLANES?Yes, the transponder is what answers the sweeping antenna from the ground and it says,‘Here I am. I want to be identified. Here’s my altitude, here’s my code number. Don’t losetrack of me, guys. I’m cooperating with you.That’s called a secondary or transponder beacon return. Half of our returns were of thattype. The other half of the returns were uncooperative, non-beacon targets, from which wegot ‘skin-paint’ returns, but no help, no beacons, no pin numbers, no altitudes.So, I had a real task of trying to sift through all of this to try to see where are thereunknowns over Stephenville that I should zero in on? That took me about two and a halfmonths to do that.WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING THAT EXCITED YOU?The fact that the unknowns were at the right time of day, they were in the right latitudeand longitude. In fact, for over an hour, we got almost 200 returns from an unknown,non-beacon, unidentified device – all in a straight line ground track headed to thesoutheast over Stephenville. In addition to that, I discovered that there appeared to be twolesser unknowns also in the same area with similar skin-paint returns only and also in aground track either passing nearby or over Stephenville or slightly south of Stephenvilleheaded southeast."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"An “Unknown Aircraft” without transponder beacon, but reflecting nearly200 skin-paint returns, moved in a straight line from Dublin toward the Bush Crawfordranch between 6:51 PM and 8 PM, on January 8, 2008. The unknown object disappeared fromradar between 7:03 PM and 7:10 PM. Then at 7:32 PM, the unknown object acceleratedrapidly in 30 seconds to 532 mph and then ten seconds later, it decelerated to 49 mph.Graph © 2008 by Glen Schulze and Robert Powell. WHAT WOULD YOU CONCLUDE FROM THAT?I’m definitely getting regular target returns, skin-paints only, of non-beacon objects in thesky, which appear to be in some sort of formation because they are all heading in the samedirection and at the same time and they all appear to have an erratic appearance to them.By that, I mean the major unknown of which we got about 200 radar returns from over aone hour period (6:51 PM to 8 PM), we would get maybe five consecutive returns in a50-second period. Then we would not receive returns for the next minute or so. Thensuddenly, we would get five or six more radar returns back. So, we were getting asporadic burst of skin-paint returns from this major target.What kept us interested was when radar returns on one unknown object (no transponderbeeps) did show up in the data from 6:51 PM to 8:00 PM, on our graph it was traveling astraight line headed for Crawford, Texas. (George W. Bush ranch is there).I have a feeling that whatever this was, it was dropping below the radar screen – you’veheard the phrase, ‘Flying below the radar screen.’ I think some times this unknown objectwas dropping below the radar screen coverage and then come back up on top of the radarand then go back down. It looks like whatever this was, it was gaining in altitude and thendropping in altitude periodically during the 60-minute period. The other two unknowntargets were doing similar things, but the pattern there was not quite as convincing becausewe didn’t have as many returns from those two.” First Unknown Radar Returns At 6:15 PMRobert Powell, chemist retired from semi-conductor industry and current Director ofResearch, MUFON (Mutual UFO Network), Austin, Texas: “The first radar unknownwas at 6:15 PM, and that radar unknown was two data points that showed up on radar 20seconds apart. One of the data points shows up just north of Selden by about 3 miles. Thesecond radar point shows up north of Stephenville by about 7 to 8 miles."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"First radar “unknown” between 6:15 PM and 6:20 PM in Selden, Texas,which is similar in time and location to the sightings by Steve Allen and his two friendsof the huge rectangle of lights that changed shapes, flew off toward Stephenvilleand then returned to Selden where the two F-16s chased after them. “If data pointsare of the same object, its speed would be 2100 mph.” Graph © 2008by Glen Schulze and Robert Powell.SO THAT MIGHT RELATE TO STEVE ALLEN SAYING THAT THE FIRST THINGTHEY SAW WAS THE RECTANGULAR CONFIGURATION OF THE LIGHTSCOMING IN FRONT OF HIM AND HIS TWO COLLEAGUES SITTING ON THEHILL. THEN IT TOOK OFF, AS I UNDERSTAND, QUITE RAPIDLY GOING TOTHEIR LEFT. THAT MIGHT BE THE MOMENT WHERE THE LIGHTS ARE INFRONT OF THEM IN SELDEN AND THE RADAR PICKS THEM UP INSTEPHENVILLE.Right, that’s correct. And speed I can calculate because the FAA radar data gives me alatitude and longitude coordinate for each of those two points and the data gives me times.So, I can calculate the distance between the two points, the time it took to get there andthen I can calculate a minimum speed.WHAT SPEED DID YOU CALCULATE BETWEEN THE SELDEN RADAR OBJECTAND THE STEPHENVILLE RADAR OBJECT AT 6:15 PM?Approximately 2100 mph. I would not be surprised if we do have some military jets thatwould be able to travel at 2100 mph if they were at high altitude.WHERE THERE WAS LESS ATMOSPHERIC FRICTION?Right.BUT AT 2100 MPH AT THE LEVEL OF WHERE STEVE ALLEN AND THE OTHERTWO WERE IN SELDEN, IT WAS LOW FROM THEIR DESCRIPTION ANDTRAVELING VERY FAST. WOULDN’T THEY HAVE HEARD THE SOUND BARRIERBEING BROKEN?They should have, as long as it broke the sound barrier some place in their vicinity. Other Eyewitnesses Between6:10 PM and 6:25 PMWHAT CONVINCES YOU THAT THE RADAR YOU HAVE FROM THE FAA ANDTHE FOIA REQUEST MATCHES WITH STEVE ALLEN’S EYEWITNESS SIGHTING?Steve saw this some time between 5:45 PM and 6:15 PM. There’s another witness whowas driving west near Chalk Mountain and saw two very bright objects directly westtowards Stephenville. That was at 6:10 PM.At 6:20 PM, there was also a witness near Gorman, Texas. That’s either 20 or 30 miles tothe west of Stephenville, who sees an object that he thinks is just north of Stephenville anddescribes it as a series of lights that turn on and turn off.There is also a witness near Lake Proctor at 6:20 to 6:25 PM, who sees an object in theDublin and Stephenville area that is a group of lights moving at a rapid speed."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"So, I’ve got a radar fix on an object at 6:15 PM. I’ve got three witnesses whose time frameis very close to 6:15 PM. And then I have a grouping of four witnesses near Selden whohave given different times that could be anywhere from 5:45 Pm to 6:15 PM. Therefore, Ibelieve it’s likely it was probably closer to 6:15 PM and that all four reports were basicallylooking at the same object that was on radar.WHAT UNFOLDS IN TERMS OF YOUR RADAR DATA OF UNKNOWNS ANDOTHER EYEWITNESS REPORTS UP TO 8 PM ON JANUARY 8, 2008?There was another event where a lady was driving her car near the city of Alexander. Shewas about to crest a hill when suddenly she saw two bright, red globes that were very closeto her. Her very first thought was that these were two planes about to crash because of thered color of the light and the size.Then as she continued looking, she realized those two lights were stationary. They werenot moving. And she pulled a little bit over to the right of the road and then within a fewseconds, the lights just disappeared. She described those lights as if you pulled up behind aschool bus at night and the lights were similar to the reddish-orange lights on the back of aschool bus.OK, so I looked for any objects on radar in her position. I did find an object on radar about6 or 8 miles southwest of her location, which is the direction she said that she saw thisobject. In that southwest direction is an object that pick up on radar. We actually track thison radar for over an hour. This is the one that if you continue tracking it, by 8 PM, it iswithin 10 miles of the (President Bush) Crawford Ranch.”Continued in Part 2 - Strange Sorties of F-16s on January 8, 2008More Information:See other Earthfiles reports about Stephenville, Texas, aerial phenomena in EarthfilesArchive:• 07/25/2008 — Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell Says Governments Covering Up E.
