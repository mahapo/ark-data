February 13, 2008 Pasadena, California - Saturn's orange moon, Titan, has hundreds oftimes more liquid hydrocarbons than all the known oil and natural gas reserves on Earth,according to new data from NASA's Cassini spacecraft. The hydrocarbons rain from thesky, collecting in vast deposits that form lakes and dunes.Several detailed images taken by Cassini's radar instrument,shows bodies of liquid hydrocarbons near Titan's north pole.

Instead of water, liquid hydrocarbons in the formof methane and ethane are present on the moon's surface, and tholinsprobably make up its dunes. The term \"tholins\" was coined by Carl Sagan in1979 to describe the complex organic molecules at the heart of prebioticchemistry.Cassini has mapped about 20 percent of Titan's surface with radar. Severalhundred lakes and seas have been observed, with each of several dozenestimated to contain more hydrocarbon liquid than Earth's oil and gasreserves. The dark dunes that run along the equator contain a volume oforganics several hundred times larger than Earth's coal reserves.Proven reserves of natural gas on Earth total 130 billion tons, enough toprovide 300 times the amount of energy the entire United States uses annuallyfor residential heating, cooling and lighting. Dozens of Titan's lakesindividually have the equivalent of at least this much energy in the form ofmethane and ethane.“This global estimate is based mostly on views of the lakes in the northernpolar regions. We have assumed the south might be similar, but we really don'tyet know how much liquid is there,” said Lorenz. Cassini's radar has observedthe south polar region only once, and only two small lakes were visible. Futureobservations of that area are planned during Cassini's proposed extendedmission.Scientists estimated Titan's lake depth by making some general assumptionsbased about lakes on Earth. They took the average area and depth of lakes onEarth, taking into account the nearby surroundings, like mountains. On Earth,the lake depth is often 10 times less than the height of nearby terrain.“We also know that some lakes are more than 10 meters or so deep becausethey appear literally pitch-black to the radar. If they were shallow, we'd seethe bottom, but we don't,” said Lorenz.The question of how much liquid is on the surface is an important one becausemethane is a strong greenhouse gas on Titan as well as on Earth, but there ismuch more of it on Titan. If all the observed liquid on Titan is methane, itwould only last a few million years, because as methane escapes into Titan'satmosphere, it breaks down and escapes into space. If the methane were torun out, Titan could become much colder. Scientists believe that methanemight be supplied to the atmosphere by venting from the interior incryovolcanic eruptions. If so, the amount of methane, and the temperature onTitan, may have fluctuated dramatically in Titan's past.“We are carbon-based life, and understanding how far along the chain ofcomplexity towards life that chemistry can go in an environment like Titanwill be important in understanding the origins of life throughout the universe,”added Lorenz.Cassini's next radar flyby of Titan is on February 22, 2008, when the radarinstrument will observe the Huygens probe landing site.More Information:For further information about Saturn and its moons, please see related reports in theEarthfiles Archive:• 06/20/2007 — Update: What Is the Moving Light in Saturn's Rings?
