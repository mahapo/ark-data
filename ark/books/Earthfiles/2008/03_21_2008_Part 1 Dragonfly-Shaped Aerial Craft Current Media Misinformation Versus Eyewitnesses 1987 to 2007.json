Neither conclusion is true.Why did FOX have a segment about the dragonfly drones? Because the Los Angeles Timeson March 18, 2008, headlined: “A UFO Cold Case” with a photograph of two privateinvestigators named Frankie Dixon and T. K. Davis. The two were hired by a Europeangroup to track down one of last year’s eyewitnesses who photographed a dragonflymachine over a power line in Capitola, California, on May 16, 2007.Los Angeles Times photo caption: “Private eyes Frankie Dixon, left,and T.K. Davis at a park in Capitola, Calif., where they’re investigating reports thata UFO was photographed by a man with the Internet name of Raji, who latervanished into cyberspace.” Image © 2008 by Los Angeles Times.The eyewitness photographer’s internet name was Rajman1977, not “Raji” as written inthe L. A. Times photo caption. Superficial and inaccurate reporting by television and othermedia about complex phenomena is notorious and misinformation continues about the2007 dragonfly-shaped, aerial “drone” photographs. I had taken to calling the objects“drones” because eyewitnesses had the impression that the silent, hovering craft were notmanned. I think it is valuable to review first what happened last year and then look at thetime line of eyewitnesses who have seen dragonfly craft since at least 1987. 2007 Dragonfly Drone PhotographsThe first two images of the dragonfly-shaped drone in 2007 were dated May 5, from LakeTahoe. The photos were sent anonymously by someone identifying themselves as“MUFON Submitter 7013,” and were first posted on the UFOcasebook.com website. Inthose first two photos, the tall, thin, “wires” rising from the central ring are one of theunique features in most observed dragonfly drones."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Then a week later on May 11, 2007, Coast to Coast AM webmaster, Lex, received anemail with six close-up images of an odd, dragonfly-shaped, aerial craft photographed inthe Bakersfield, California, region. The emailer called himself “Chad” and asked foranonymity to protect his family. His photographs were dated May 6, 2007. In addition tothe dragonfly-shaped body that had appendages sticking out from a large ring like the LakeTahoe photographs, Chad's images also showed rising from the ring the slightly curved,thin wires that formed a tall, circular crown above the dragonfly body. Chad also got aclose-up of letters, numbers and symbols on the long tail of the dragonfly craft."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Eyewitness Timeline 1987 to 2007Lex and I talked about the photos and he put me in touch with Chad. In addition to severalemails with Chad, who wanted to remain anonymous to protect his family, I haveinterviewed and/or corresponded with twelve eyewitnesses (numbered below) about theirencounters with dragonfly-shaped aerial craft that go back as far as 1987 in a hangar atBarksdale AFB, in Shreveport, Louisiana. All the dated Earthfiles titles are hot links tooriginal 2007 reports.1) Earthfiles • 05/30/2007 — Birmingham-Type “Drone” Seen At Barksdale AFB,Louisiana, in Mid-1980s1987, Barksdale AFB, Louisiana:In 1987, an eyewitness touring a Barksdale AFB air show saw a dragonfly-shaped craft in a hangar that was very similar to what the Birmingham,Alabama, military subcontractor photographed above power lines in May2006. I have talked at length by phone with the engineer who touredBarksdale AFB in 1987. He does not want to jeopardize his career, but wantsthe public to know what he saw 21 years ago. I have his full name, addressand phone number. In addition to the 1987 Barksdale AFB dragonfly craftand May 2006 dragonfly above power lines in Birmingham, Alabama, therewas also a June 25, 2007, sighting near Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base inMontgomery, Alabama, described by an infrared security technician in Part 2of this Earthfiles report. That means between 1987 and 2007, in that one closeregion that includes Shreveport, Louisiansa along with Birmingham, andMontgomery, Alabama, there have been three military-related dragonflydrone encounters.Barksdale AFB is in Shreveport, Louisiana, west of Birmingham, Alabama,where military subcontractor photographed a simpler version of the dragonflydrone in May 2006 (below). Southeast of Birmingham in Montgomery, Alabama, isMaxwell-Gunter Air Force Base.

She has asked me to call her “Shirley P,” but I have herfull name, address, phone, and employment background. She became veryupset with internet rumors that all the drone photographs were faked CGI andPhotoshop creations. She knew she had seen with her own eyes a strangeaerial object that matched the Chad images of May 6, 2007. She saw the aerialmachine while standing next to a Sequoia Park Ranger who was giving herdirections and who told her the drone was used to look for fires. Shirley sawthe same drone a second time in the park when she stopped to get furtherdriving instructions from a road crew. She did not have a camera with her.4) Earthfiles • 05/25/2007 — Two More Eyewitnesses of Aerial “Drones”in 2005 and 2006Birmingham, Alabama, May 2006:The next year in May 2006, in Birmingham, Alabama, a militarysubcontractor I am calling “ John Smith,” saw a dragonfly drone. As asubcontractor for the military, he cannot jeopardize his career. But he and Ihave corresponded by email and I have his full name, address and phonenumber. He took a photograph in May 2006 in a residential section ofBirmingham, Alabama, with a Canon Digital camera. Mr. Smith was workingnear a construction site and heard a low buzzing sound like a transformer.
