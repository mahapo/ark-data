No really! Mywife and I went to Italy, and while there visited the Mediaeval town of Orvieto.Orvieto is noted for its Gothic cathedral, or duomo. The duomo was built starting in1290. On the ceiling is a very dramatic fresco done in 1451 by Luca Signorelli called‘The Rule of the Antichrist.’ The two things that struck me in this painting were abattle in the sky between two beings (probably God and Satan?) complete withbeams of energy, and on the right a bunch of beings dressed completely in black,like Ninjas, with long black staffs! They seem to be gathering up the town’s peopleand searching a temple of some kind. This really struck me as an actual event thatwas captured in the fresco, more than iconography. And the figures in black with thestaffs reminded me of the reports in the Black Death.The Duomo di Orvieto is a large 14th century Roman Catholic cathedralsituated in the town of Orvieto in Umbria, central Italy. The building was constructedunder the orders of Pope Urban IV to commemorate and provide a suitable home for the Corporalof Bolsena, a miracle which is said to have occurred in 1264 in the nearby town of Bolsena,when a traveling priest who had doubts about the truth of transubstantiation found that hisHost was bleeding so much that it stained the altar cloth. The cloth is now stored in theChapel of the Corporal inside the cathedral."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Fresco of “The Rule of the Antichrist” (circa 1501) by Luca Signorelli (1445 to 1523)in Orvieto Cathedral, Orvieto, Umbria, central Italy.

He had aclose friend who was a psychic, and she used to say that death in this dimension wasfeeding another dimension, and that was pretty much our purpose here. The moredeath here, the better for them there. I always found that a disturbing idea, but thelonger I studied the UFO abduction phenomenon, the more it started to make sense.Well, it doesn’t make sense, since we don’t understand what’s going on, but I didsee correlations.Another repeating theme is the Grays' fascination with our emotions, telling theabductees that they, the Greys, no longer have emotions. They seem to like to scarepeople with visions of dooms days and other horrific scenes of our supposed future,all the while setting us up for more conflict and suffering. It all seems like a biggame. They feed us some information, showing us things we know nothing about,and then throw in some nonsense along with it. I myself have had this happen,where out of the blue I started seeing a stream of information and ideas, andpictures. I thought ‘Wow, what a lot of great information!’ (who talks this way?) andthen I was told in a clear voice to write a book about what I was being shown, andspread the word to people ‘because it will help them.’ As soon as I thought ‘Wow,I’m not sure I can do all that,’ it stopped. And the main idea that was being shown tome, something about vibrations, was gone from my memory! So maybe they meanwell, but then again maybe it’s as long as it’s of use to them. And without emotions,maybe it’s all the same to them.For a while I tried to get it back, but then I started wondering if it’s all a ruse. Mybrother pointed out how religious movements were started this way, and with a lotof these experiences, the so-called profits are also fed a line of BS that makes themlook like they are crazy! So my opinion changed from this was a benevolentintention to that of wanting to set us up for more conflict on this planet! I’ve had noabduction experiences, but have always had a protective and helpful influencearound me, which I first remembered when I was quite young.It’s mind boggling to think these beings, and I believe there are more than one ‘race’of them involved here, can just pop into our thoughts and feed a stream of data intoour heads. We probably don’t have a single private moment, yet we have no ideathey are all around. Our present reality has no room for such beings, unlike ourbeliefs of the past. We shared this world with all kinds of beings back then. Skepticslike to ask, ‘If there are UFO’s and aliens, why don’t they make themselves known?’Well they do, but just to one person at a time. Meanwhile, we are told by the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"officials that run things in our society that they aren’t real, and if you think they are,you’re a crackpot.Something is going on, and something big is about to happen. I wanted to experiencethis event since I was a kid. But now, I’m not so sure! Do we really want to learnthat we are merely someone’s livestock or amusement?” 2) Subject: Fog and Black DeathDate: August 23, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“ After reading your interview with William Bramley, I thought of an interestingIcelandic expression that dates back to the Black Death era. ‘Nú kemur til Teits ogSiggu’ - which translates ‘Now it's in the hands of Teitur and Sigga’ and means thatone does not have enough information about something and has to seek council.This is how the expression came about:At the time of the Black Death a young man, Teitur, and a young woman, Sigga,lived in a community of a few hundred people called Ólafsfjörður (fjord of Olaf) onthe north coast of Iceland. In the autumn they took a several-day trip to themountains to collect herbs. As they returned, standing on the top of a mountain withthe whole fjord in view, they saw a dense fog lying like a carpet over the wholearea. Due to the moderate climate and near constant wind from the sea, this washighly unusual. And there was something about the fog that struck them as unusualand made them afraid enough to sleep on the mountain until the fog lifted. Whenthey finally came down, they found that everyone was dead.Later, when relatives of the deceased had to decide property rights, ownership andsuch, they had to turn to Teitur and Sigga for advice. Thus the above expression.” 3) Subject: UFOs and 14th Century Black DeathDate: August 23, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“ The interview with William Bramley is great.I look at the world around me and shake my head. Something strange is taking place.It's true that big money controls the media, so it would be easy to control people'sunderstanding of our times by means of the so-called free press. I can imaginecorporations wanting to gain an advantage by lowering pollution standards, forexample. But the people at the very top, they are smart people. They know thatglobal warming is a serious problem. They know that there is no escape frompollution. They could encourage an energy policy that taxes the hell out ofrecreational combustion of fossil fuels. These are just some examples. Why aren'tthe richest people in the world doing more to work toward the common good of theplanet? It seems to me it is in their best interest, at least for the sake of theirgrandchildren.Ten thousand years of civilization, and we haven't figured out how not to do war?Ancient religious traditions that lock a person's mind and heart in a faith-box ofsystematized beliefs, preventing us from becoming the divine beings I believe we areby nature?Governments that talk about a culture of life while punishing those who speak thetruth.Is it crazy to imagine a power greater than the richest of the human rich, activelyworking to keep humanity from realizing who we are? A race of alien beingsinfluencing our cultures for their own agendas makes much more sense than theworld I see around me.” 4) Subject: The God's of EdenDate: August 22, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“Just got through reading your interview with the author of the above mentionedbook. It really hit a nerve with me. For I have felt for a long time now that we were"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the property of some one else. Not that the idea makes me happy.Still I've pondered about what could they possibly get from us, because if they areall that powerful what need would they have.Looking around at the world there is a great deal of suffering that goes on, more sothan joy. So maybe they feed off the negative energies produced by wars andconfrontations. After all I've found that hate, anger, and violent death create a lotstronger emotional energy than love or joy.Maybe that's why all those figures throughout history who preached love andkindness were eventually killed, for if everyone started feeling that way, our ownerswouldn't derive the same amount of pleasure that they get from the opposite of that.For obviously we exist for someone else's pleasure and I'm sure laugh at us, if theyare capable of such an emotion.Still there has to be more to it than that. The idea of souls being recycled I've alwaysfelt was true, also that once reborn we don't consciously remember our previousexperience. Yet I believe that on some level of that subconscious we do, and maybethat's why under past life regression we can remember certain lives in bits andpieces. I don't feel that the process is a quick one though because how would oneexplain my having seen my deceased wife on 4 different occasions since she passed.Not to mention all the other people I've read about with such experiences.There has to be some way to defeat this process, there always is, we just haven'tdiscovered how yet, probably because we haven't really discovered how the processreally works.”Earthfiles welcomes viewer comments on the “UFOs and 14th Century Black Death” report andother Earthfiles news.
