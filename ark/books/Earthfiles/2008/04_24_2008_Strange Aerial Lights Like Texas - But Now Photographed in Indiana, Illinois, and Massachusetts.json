Authorities were quick to say it was “a midair mistake Wednesday night” when atleast two F-16 jets in routine training exercises with the Indiana Air National Guard went too fastat 10,000 feet and caused a sonic boom on the ground.Kokomo, Indiana, has a population of 46,000and is about 50 miles north of Indianapolis.But MUFON received a series of alleged UFO sightings on the night of April 16, 2008, fromKokomo residents Here is one example:“At approximately 10:30 PM on the night of April 16, I was in the living roomwatching TV and my husband had gone to bed. There was a huge boom that rattledthe front window. My husband asked what the noise was and I went to the frontdoor to see. Off to the west there appeared a large object with lights all the wayacross it. It reminded me of a hair barrette with lights. It seemed to be hovering, yetthe lights appeared to turn. My husband came out to stand behind me just in time tosee the lights reappear from right to left until 5 lights were showing. Then it did it fora second time before it disappeared. The lights we saw with the naked eye wereyellowish-orange in color.“If you click on www.WWKI.com (see 5 photos below), click on the article aboutthe Boom and the bright lights. You will see pictures that someone submitted.Thefourth picture down is exactly what I saw when I first looked out. This was nometeor orF-16. They don't hover. We could not take our eyes off of it and myhusband, who is a Viet Nam veteran and a retired deputy sheriff, said he had neverseen anything like it. We are both certain that what we saw was unidentifiable. Thenext morning, when I went out to get the newspaper at a little after 5 AM, I lookedoff into the west in the same vicinity. There, in front of the moon was a hugeV-shaped dark cloud that reminded me of a flower vase with a lot of much smallerjet trails near it.” Source: MUFON.The next day, WWKI Radio 100.5 in Kokomo, Indiana, posted the following images on itswebsite under the headline:“Big boom!

A few friends of mine contacted me last night (April 17, 2008, around10 PM Eastern), as they were watching two light formations in the sky last nightover Granville, Massachusetts. They said the lights were in triangle formations, verylarge and flickering and \"twinkling\" red, blue, green, and white colors. It appeared tobe about two crafts and they were causing such a spectacle the entire neighborhoodwhere my friends live were outside watching it. When my friend contacted herdaughter (in Springfield, MA) about it she said they were watching the same thingover there and a whole bunch of people were out staring at the sky.

I drove right over there to Dan’s house. As we approached, from the road wecould see a very bright object low in the sky. I knew that was exactly what everybody waslooking at.My husband was trying to park and I jumped out of the car. Dan immediately grabbed me by myshoulders, handed me binoculars and pointed into the sky. I was looking at a great big ball ofwhite light just above the tree line and it was flashing with colors. When we looked at it throughbinoculars, you could clearly see colored lights swirling around inside like blue, green, red, pinkand gold. And it kind of reminded me of those flashing light toys they sell at Disney World forthe parades.REALLY VIVID COLORS?Yes. It was beautiful, like a bright pink, and red and green and blue and gold. It looked like it wasmoving downward ever so slightly into the trees.SOME PEOPLE HAVE COMPARED A COUPLE OF THE UNUSUAL LIGHTS IN TEXAS(JAN – FEB 2008) WITH A MERRY-GO-ROUND INSIDE A SPHERICAL OR DISC-SHAPEDLIGHT THAT HAD SPINNING COLORS BEHIND A GAUZY, SILVERY SURFACE.That’s exactly it – mostly white-silvery and then on the inside it was moving like a carousel in acircular motion of colored lights.Video Frames Excerpted from Courtney's Videotapes"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Videotape frames excerpted to show color changes of bright, aerial object aboveDan Vierno's house in Granville, Massachusetts, videotaped over a period of90 minutes between 10 and 11:30 PM Eastern, on Friday, April 18, 2008.Images © 2008 by Courtney Lynne Wilson-Merrill.Courtney Videotape, April 18, 2008, Granville, Massachusetts“Here are the links to the three videos I shot with my new camera:• Canon G7 with • 35-210mm (35mm equiv) lens• F2.8-4.8• 6x optical zoomhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=Jp0PKX5-BeY The first video I shot after I looked through the binoculars and saw the colors and was reallyexcited because I began to question why it was there and what it was doing. So, I just grabbedmy camera and started recording the light without my tripod, which is why the first video isreally jumpy. After that video finished, I got my tripod and set that up on Dan’s front lawn andthat’s when I took the second video.WHY IS VIDEOTAPE #2 SO BLUE AND FUZZY?In that one, I zoomed in, but the camera has auto focus and wouldn’t focus on anything, so itlooks only like a light ball out of focus. [ Courtney does not know if her new camera can changeto manual focus.]At the end of one of the videos, I think you can hear me say I could try taking a long exposurephoto to see if the object was moving, because we were not sure.

I tried to photograph that secondone, but it didn’t come out well. You can’t really see it.HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE THERE?There was my husband and me. Rich Guzman was not there that night, but was talking by cellphone with Dan Vierno. Others were Dan’s girlfriend, Bridgette, and one of Bridgette’sgirlfriends, and a new neighbor across the street. So six of us there and Rich was at his housefurther up the mountain about five minutes away. He could see the same two lights from hisplace.We watched that as long as we could, about 90 minutes. I went over in just my pajamas, so I gotpretty cold. I think it was still out there when we went inside to talk about what might behappening.HOW UNIQUE WAS THIS TO YOU?It was completely different than the stars because we were comparing the stars, looking throughthe binoculars. Then we would go back to the stars. The object was a lot brighter and bigger –maybe five times bigger than the stars – and it had the swirling carousel of colors on the inside. Itdidn’t look like anything astronomical at all.The first object was moving down and the amber orange one wasn’t moving at all. In comparisonto some of the star formations, the amber one didn’t move with the constellations.

His house is about five minutesup the road from Dan Vierno's and is more isolated in the Granville mountains. An odd, colorful,flashing light first caught his attention from his bedroom window on Tuesday, April 15, 2008.Rich couldn't figure out what the light was that night and was even more surprised when hisfriend, Dan Vierno, called him on Thursday night, April 17, and told Rich to go outside to see atleast five bright, flashing lights.Interview:Richard “Rich” Guzman, Van Detail Mechanic, Granville, Massachusetts: “April 17th, Ihad a phone call from my friend, Dan. And Dan said, ‘Rich, you’ve got to look up in the sky.There’s something up there and I don’t know what it is. But I definitely think there are definitelyUFOs up there.’I said, ‘UFO? What are you talking about?’I’m looking up into the sky and I’m seeing these flashing lights and I grab my binoculars and he'son the phone with me at the same time (each in different part of Granville). He says, ‘What areyou seeing?’I said, ‘I see these flashing, silver lights and they go from silver to red, and then they went toblue.’HOW MANY WERE IN THE SKY AT THE SAME TIME DOING THE ODD COLORFLASHES?For me, what I witnessed? I’m going to say at least five or more.WERE THE FLASHING LIGHTS IN ANY FORMATION PATTERN?I saw three of the lights in a long triangle – it was like one was pointed west, another light waspointed north and one was pointed south. It was weird because the triangle was long - not facingdownwards, but sideways.THREE OF THE PULSING LIGHTS FORMING THEMSELVES INTO A FORMATION OF ALONG TRIANGLE?Yes, exactly. The one that I saw really vivid, it was moving and doing this little jagged movement- like it was moving a little bit and then staying in one spot. Moving a little bit and then staying inthe same spot. I don't know, I’ve never seen anything like it in my life.IF YOU HAVE ONE LONG TRIANGLE FORMATION OF THREE OF THEM, WHAT WERETHE OTHER PULSING LIGHTS DOING? WHAT PATTERN WERE THEY IN?In the triangle formation, they didn't really move. But there was one I found separate that wasbigger and more vibrant. That's the one I saw move just a little bit and stay still and then move alittle bit and then stay still.Then I could see just like a silver-whitish color. It’s weird. It’s hard to describe it. But I do recallwhen Dan was talking to me, it was like, ‘Rich, I saw blue lights and red lights and I think Dansaid green, too. But I saw red and blue lights.For me, they are still out there! (laughs) That’s what I’m thinking. I told Dan that and he cameup here yesterday night and they were still up there, but they were moving towards the west.YOU MEAN THAT YOU ALL SAW THIS SATURDAY NIGHT, APRIL 19, AS WELL?Yeah. Then the lights were moving more towards the west.And I’m seeing one right now. I’m outside right now and I’m seeing it. I’m focusing mybinoculars – yep, there it is! I’ll be a son of a gun! It’s mostly silver right now. It’s flashing lights– they look like Christmas lights. And it’s not. It looks like little crystal silver lights with ayellowish tint. And it’s flashing.IT’S SILVER NOW?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Yes, it’s silver now.SO, THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU ALL SAW ON APRIL 17 AND 18 and 19?Yes, there it is. Looks green.

Wish I did. I just saw red flashing lights! And now it's back to silver.DO YOU KNOW ANYBODY YOU COULD CALL AND SAY, ‘COULD YOU GET ACAMERA WITH A LENS ON THIS AND TAKE SOME PHOTOGRAPHS?’It's kind of hard for me because I'm up in the mountains, so there aren't really any neighbors.There might be another light there, but it's hard to tell because it's cloudy.TWO OF THEM ARE SORT OF BELOW THE CLOUD CEILING?Yeah, I think I just found a third one.SO, THEY HAVE TO BE UNDER THE CLOUD COVER.Yeah, there's the other one. There are three of them now.THEY ARE ALL DOING THE SAME THING?Yeah, mostly silver and then flashing red and then flashing bluish-green like. That is so bizarre!ALL OF YOU ARE CONVINCED THAT YOU ARE WATCHING SOMETHING THAT IS NOTASTRONOMICAL OR MILITARY?No, this is like flashing colored lights and - no way!

It sure looks the same and her description matchesas well, including the colors match very well. If it's the same type ofUFO, as it appears to be (in Stephenville, Rose Glen and Dublin, Texas),maybe the “ military” theory is falling apart. Gabby mentioned to methat she and her friend were watching planes in the sky when theynoticed the UFO. It was silent, visible to the naked eye, and flashing thecolor pattern she describes over a 15-minute period.Here is Gabby's email to me, Friday, April 11, 2008:“Brandon,When we saw the thing, it was Sat. April 5, at 11:45 PM, Iwant to say. We thought it was a plane because there werea lot of planes in the sky that night. But we noticed itwasn't moving, so we ran inside and got the telescope. Itdidn't help.Then we thought that we could take a picture(through the telescope lens), and so we did.After we took a picture, it was even stranger. The thingwas turning colors and I remember what they were ... Blue,Green, Red, Purple ... in that order. We looked up on thecomputer to find anything like it, but we couldn't and therewasn't anything like it in my astronomy book. So that didn'thelp. Just north of the thing was (planet) Mercury.

We were looking at thesky and all the stars and planes. Then we noticed something else and we didn’t know what itwas, so we went inside and got the telescope. It didn’t really help much. So, we thought maybewe could get a camera and zoom in with it to see if we could see what it was. So, we startedtaking pictures of it and when we looked at the picture it was like blue, green, red and purple –very colorful and it looked like it was moving. Without the camera or anything, it looked like agiant, colorful star moving like back and forth slowly.WHAT CAUGHT YOUR ATTENTION IN THE BEGINNING?When we were on the trampoline, what really caught my eye was when we were looking up andit was like the brightest thing in the sky.WHEN YOU SAY BRIGHTEST, DO YOU MEAN A WHITE, LIKE SIRIUS, OR ADIFFERENT COLOR?Yes, it was like white, but around it was like bluish and greenish and red and purple.DID YOU SEE ANY MOTION IN IT AT ALL?Yes, but just a little bit. It was kind of like back and forth and up and down a little bit.SO, IT WAS DEFINITELY NOT LIKE A STAR OR PLANET?No.WHAT WERE YOU SEEING THROUGH YOUR TELESCOPE?It was very bright and big and colorful. It was very strange - a big, white color, kind of shiny,silvery thing in the sky, and it had blue, green, red and purple around it kind of flashing in thatorder: blue, green, red and purple. That’s what we saw.SO DID THE ENTIRE ROUND OBJECT CHANGE COLOR?Yes, it would change to a very light blue and then a very light green and very light red - almostpink - and then very light purple.HOW DID YOU ATTACH YOUR CAMERA TO THE TELESCOPE?We were holding it as still as possible right next to a tree, so we were leaning on the tree a littlebit so we weren’t moving. And holding it as steady as possible to take a picture.AGAINST THE LENS PIECE?Ye s .WERE YOU AND YOUR FRIEND SURPRISED WHEN YOU SAW THE PICTURE?Yes. When we first saw it, we didn’t know what it could have been. We were trying to thinkabout it the whole night.
