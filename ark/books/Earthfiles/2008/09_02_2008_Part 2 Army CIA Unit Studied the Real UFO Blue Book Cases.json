I was living and working inPhiladelphia, Pennsylvania. He and I had talked by phone for the first times on May 2 andMay 7, 1998. To his surprise, on Monday, May 25, 1988, he received a phone call from amale voice who did not introduce himself and did not address Stein by name, but whowarned Stein not to talk about an “assassination squad” based in the southeastern militarybase where the CIA Project Blue Book analysis of UFO photographs and film was alsocarried out. The clear implication was that one or both of our phones were tapped.Linda Moulton Howe: “COULD YOU PLEASE GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING OFTHE PHONE CALL AND TELL ME EXACTLY WHAT THE CALLER SAID?A male voice, without saying my name, simply started: ‘Do you remember theconversation you had with a party in Pennsylvania in regards to some classified materials?’They did not give an exact date and time. They just said ‘several weeks ago.’I TALKED WITH YOU ON MAY 2 AND MAY 7, AND TODAY IS MAY 30, 1998, SOTHE LAST TIME WE TALKED WAS THREE WEEKS AGO. DID THEY CALL YOUSOON AFTER WE TALKED, OR ONLY RECENTLY?Recently. Today is Saturday. The person called me last Monday night, May 25, 1998. Ididn’t mention anything to my wife because since she found out I was involved withclassified activities, she has always been with the attitude to keep it all 100% classified.WHAT ELSE DID THE MALE VOICE SAY?He didn’t say my name. He just said, ‘We understand you have had a conversation withsomebody in Pennsylvania in regards to classified materials and we would appreciate ifyou did not bring up the fact or have any interview or TV interviews in regard to theassassination squad that you mentioned on the telephone. And don’t mention anythinggoing on at ------------- base, as you mentioned about the U-2 flights coming from there.Don’t mention anything about that. We would appreciate that because reporters andinterested people seeing this information might try to get into the classified area there atthe risk of their own physical harm.’So, Linda, they’ve still got something there now that they don’t want anyone pokingaround, apparently because the phone caller said if that information were published, wewould have reporters down in the base and it would have serious repercussions if outsiderstried to sneak into various areas.DID YOU HAVE THE SENSE THAT YOUR WARNING WAS TIED INTO THE ALIENSTORY?Yes, I think so. I know we have flying craft that are ours that look like UFOs that we havebuilt or back-engineered copies of actual E. T. ones. I think they have some of those at"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"that base. We used to have the U-2s stored there when they flew over Cuba. They wouldfly from our base to Cuba and return to land in Texas somewhere and then fly back againto our base during the Cuban missile crisis.Linda, someone had to have tapped one of our phones and I have a feeling it must havebeen yours.DID HE SAY YOU COULD NOT TALK ABOUT THE 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS?No, nothing like that.THEN CAN WE DO AN INTERVIEW TODAY, WITHOUT NAME ATTRIBUTION,ABOUT YOU AS A PERSON WHO SERVED IN THE ARMY AND CIA WHO SAWFILMS AND PHOTOS OF NON-HUMANS AND THEIR CRAFT?Yes, I guess so in regards to that subject, as long as I don’t bring up anything about----------, or the classified area, or the assassination squad.THEN, I’LL GET THE TAPE RECORDER GOING. COULD YOU START OFF ANDTELL ME HOW I SHOULD INTRODUCE YOU?I was working for the CIA, not as an agent, but in administration out of the southeasternUnited States. I had worked with Project Blue Book information about UFOs that theUSAF could not explain. Those cases were sent to Washington, D. C., to Fort Belvoir,Virginia, and then Fort Belvoir would submit some of those cases down to my boss. TheCIA also had other locations where cases were sent for investigation that were notexplainable.YOUR BOSS WAS WORKING IN THE CIA?He had been there for a long time. In WWII, he was with the OSS and after WWII, it waschanged to Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).YOU AND YOUR BOSS WERE HANDLING UNEXPLAINED CASES THAT PROJECTBLUE BOOK NEVER RELEASED TO THE PUBLIC? Two Different Project Blue Books:One Public and One CIA-ClassifiedSee: 080308 Earthfiles “Original Scorched Carbonof CIA Memo Links Government UFO Cover-UP and JFK Assassination.”Tab (D) CIA Counter-Intelligence (CI) Directive Regarding Project BLUE BOOK,one of the nine original carbon pages scorched by fire and studied by Robert Wood,Ph.D., physicist and retired aerospace manager, McDonnell Douglas.[ Editor's Note: “Project BLUE BOOK (CIA-classified version)will continue in its current intelligence collection activities andcounterintelligence functions as specified in current NIE.Reference to BLUE BOOK (public version) is authorized onlywhen responding to public and congressional inquiries.” Wikipedia - “National Intelligence Estimates (NIEs) - firstproduced in 1950 by the Office of National Estimates - areUnited States federal government documents that are theauthoritative assessment of the Director of National Intelligence(DNI) on intelligence related to a particular national securityissue.

When they closed down (public version) Project BlueBook in 1969, they said to the public and the media that absolutely nothing of significancehad been reported to the Condon Committee that could not be explained. [PhysicistEdward Condon, Univ. of Colorado, hired by U. S. Air Force to allegedly study the UFOphenomenon to create a public report that was then used by the USAF to dismiss thephenomenon.] Technically, that was true because everything they could not explain wassent to Fort Belvoir in Virginia and then farmed out from there to other military operationslike our southeastern base and to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI wasalso involved, I know. The FBI would show up at some of the UFO eyewitnesses’doorsteps.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “Fort Belvoir, built in 1917, first as Camp A.

WAS THE FBI SOME OF THE INFAMOUS ‘MEN IN BLACK’?Yes, I think so.WHAT YEARS WERE YOU SPECIFICALLY WORKING IN THE CIA ANDHANDLING THE HIGHLY CLASSIFIED REPORTS ABOUT THE UFOPHENOMENON?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"1957 to 1960. I entered the U. S. Army in 1956, but I didn’t get involved with the CIAProject Blue Book analysis until after the first year.YOUR RANK WAS WHAT?I was an Army 1st Lieutenant. I was still in the Army Signal Corps, but I also worked forthe CIA. I was getting two pay checks. I was getting one from the CIA and one for militaryservice.IN THE COURSE OF YOUR CLASSIFIED WORK FROM 1957 TO 1960, WHAT 16MMFILMS DID YOU SEE RELATED TO THE UFO PHENOMENON?One was released in the last few years showing the alien autopsy. I saw that very samefilm in 1957. [Santilli - see Earthfiles Part 1.]WHAT WERE THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH YOU SAW THE AUTOPSY FILM?My boss – it was in regards to studying UFOs and trying to investigate some of the folderswe had about various sightings. Apparently someone in Fort Belvoir, Virginia, sent himthat film. We, as a team, screened the film one Saturday morning and then my boss had tosend it right back to Fort Belvoir. But we saw that one. Silver Disc Materialized Out of Small CloudFilmed in Color 16mmWe also saw on moving film several other highly classified UFO sightings. We had onecolor film showing a UFO actually developing or materializing over a power plant in one ofthe western states such as Oregon or Washington or Utah. Somewhere out in that area.MEANING SOMEONE JUST HAPPENED TO BE FILMING?Yes, someone was trying out a brand new camera and they were filming this power plant.First you saw the mountainous region around and then they panned to the power plant.The power plant naturally has a smoke stack with smoke going out of it. A little ways awayfrom where the smoke was going up, we saw this white, round – looked like a little pieceof a cloud. It got more and more dense and more and more round and then you could seetiny windows around the bottom section. It developed more and more and pretty soon itlooked real silver and then it started flying off slowly.SO THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY HAD 16MM FILM OF THEMATERIALIZATION OF A SILVER DISC THAT EMERGED FROM WHAT LOOKEDLIKE A VAPOROUS CLOUD?Yes, and emerged close to the smoke coming out of the power plant smoke stack. So, wethought at the time the aliens must have some way of materializing after traveling from onearea to another, perhaps by using the current down in the power plant some how, bychanging the electrical currents that were down there, changing into somethingelectromagnetic or into something solid.WAS THIS SHOWN TO YOU IN THE CONTEXT OF THE 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDAUTOPSY BECAUSE THOSE HUMANOIDS WERE RELATED TO THEMATERIALIZATION OF THE DISC?Not really. They just introduced it as film the CIA had that could not be explained andwanted our group to look at it. Another unexplainable case. They said we might get callsfrom people who witness similar materializations, so the film showed such an actualmaterialization phenomenon. Other 16mm Film Screened by CIA Unit:6-Fingered Non-Human Autopsy/DissectionHOW WAS THE AUTOPSY/DISSECTION OF THE 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDPRESENTED TO YOU? WHAT WAS THE EXPLANATION ABOUT WHY THIS HADOCCURRED?They said that this was done at Roswell the same day or day after a crash, that the craftwas picked up at night and some time during the next day, the autopsy was performedthere in Roswell at the base."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THAT WOULD CONTRADICT THE STATEMENT BY THE ALLEGED AUTOPSYCAMERAMAN, WHO SAID HE WAS THERE DURING THE AUTOPSY ANDFILMED THE WRECKAGE AND THE BEAMS THAT HAD THE SYMBOLS ANDTHAT ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER, HE WAS ASKED TO GO SOME PLACE TOFILM THE AUTOPSY/DISSECTION. DO YOU KNOW HOW TO RECONCILE THESETWO DIFFERENT PIECES OF INFORMATION?No, I don’t. When I saw the film in the southeastern military base, we were told that it wasdone in New Mexico and most of the film was done right at the military base outside ofRoswell. Some smaller pieces of film were done at the local hospital or clinic, which mighthave been the beams with symbols on them.In the 16mm film of alleged crash debris, there is an I-beam, which reflects like shiny metalas it is turned in the hands of an unidentified person who seems to be showing the cameradifferent angles and orientations without knowing precisely what is top or bottom. In theorientation above, the imprinted symbols resemble early and classic Greek shown below.16mm frames provided by Ray Santilli of Merlin Productions, London, England© 1996 by Orbital Media Ltd.

HOWWERE THEY DESCRIBED?There was very little information. The film was about ten years old when I and our teamsaw it. They just said this is the only film of the aliens and the body. There are photostaken by various citizens showing these aliens outside their craft walking around. But thisis the only film that shows a close picture of the aliens and exactly what they look like. So,if you run across any more of these sightings that describe this particular 6-fingered being,you can compare against this film.WAS THE FILM IN BLACK AND WHITE OR COLOR?Black and white.DID YOU EVER SEE ANY COLOR FILM OR PHOTOGRAPHS OF THE BEINGS?Not of the beings, no, I never did. The only color film I ever saw was of that silver discmaterializing at the power plant. It was in beautiful color. Blue sky, white clouds, silverdisc.FROM 1957 TO 1960, DID YOU SEE ANY PHOTOGRAPHS, DRAWINGS OR ANYOTHER INFORMATION ABOUT ANY OTHER TYPES OF BEINGS BESIDES THE6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS FROM THE AUTOPSY/DISSECTION FILM?No other films of any kind or photos. There were a couple of photos taken by privateindividuals and sent to Project Blue Book of aliens outside a craft, but the beings were toosmall and far away to identify exactly what they looked like. Stein Saw 6-Fingered HumanoidAutopsy Film in CIA Unit, 19576-fingered and 6-toed humanoid allegedly retrieved from the crash of an unidentifiedaerial vehicle, described by Ray Santilli as southwest of Socorro, New Mexico, in 1947,not between Corona and Roswell. 16mm frames provided by Ray Santilli of MerlinProductions, London, England © 1996 by Orbital Media Ltd."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"See autopsy film at YouTube.HOW WERE YOU SHOWN THE 6-FINGERED AUTOPSY/DISSECTION FILM?WHAT WERE THE SCREENING CONDITIONS?Fort Belvoir sent the film down to us at our military base's classified site and we looked atthe film. Then my boss had to send it right back the next day by some special courier theyhad running between Fort Belvoir in Virginia and -------------.WAS THE 16MM FILM SHOWN BY A PROJECTOR ON A SCREEN?Yes, on a regular white screen that you pulled down like a shade.HOW MANY OF YOU WERE THERE?About 20 of us. There were 26 in total involved in our group and I would say about 20 sawthat film. Some of our group were overseas at the time. A lot of the UFO photos that wegot were not United States sightings. There were European and Central America, Mexico,South America, Italy. One was an Italian film. Even though the CIA had headquarters inall those foreign countries, it was our job in our southeastern base to verify what was sentto us.DID THE AUTOPSY FILM HAVE ANY NARRATION OR SOUND?Just a short text statement before the autopsy started. No sound or narration of any kindduring the autopsy. It went through the whole autopsy showing the type of brain they hadand that the internal organs were entirely different than ours.WAS THERE ANY MORE DETAILED EXPLANATION?At the end of the non-human autopsy film, it said that the brain was different than oursand the internal organs were entirely different as far as lungs and stomach and so forth.Nothing really resembled a human as far as the internal organs.WHEN THE FILM SHUT OFF, WHAT WAS THE DISCUSSION AMONG THE 20 OFYOU?(laughs) We discussed where the beings could have come from because it was somethingnone of us had even come close to envisioning was around our planet or happening.THIS WAS YOUR FIRST VISUAL EXPERIENCE WITH SOMETHING NON-HUMAN.DO YOU REMEMBER WHAT YOU THOUGHT AT THE TIME?Yes, I was perplexed. I wondered how could this be? How can these beings come here?How can they be entirely different from what humankind is.YET, SORT OF RESEMBLED US IN A HUMANOID-SHAPE WAY.Yes, they did resemble us a little, the 6-fingered humanoid type. But not completely. Itlooked like a miniature man. It wasn’t the great big head and back eyes of the Greys. It didnot have ears like we do. It was just a little flap of tissue around a hole inside their skull.The nose looked a little like ours, but the mouth was much smaller.IN THE FILM AND PHOTOGRAPHS RELEASED FROM THEAUTOPSY/DISSECTION – SOME PEOPLE REFER TO IT AS A DISSECTIONBECAUSE IT WAS EXPLORATORY AS OPPOSED TO A TECHNICAL AUTOPSY –"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"YOU CAN SEE SMALL EARS SET QUITE LOW ON A BEING'S HEAD.You might call them ears, but they were just a little outcropping of flesh about half an incharound the ear hole. Like the beginning of an ear.WAS THERE DISCUSSION AMONG THE TWENTY OF YOU ABOUT THE BLACKLENSES LIFTED OFF THE EYES? [ See about Santilli film in Part 1.] Top: 6-fingered humanoid during autopsy/dissection in which thin, black “lenses”covered both large eyes. Below: Large whites of eyes are revealed after the surgeon liftedoff black lenses. 16mm frames provided by Ray Santilli of Merlin Productions,London, England © 1996 by Orbital Media Ltd.In our discussion, we all said how baffled we were to see something like that. We reallydidn’t have that much of a technical discussion, only that we were so amazed at theinternal organs and brain. There were stainless steel pans and the doctor was taking theorgans and putting them in different pans. [ More details in upcoming Earthfiles parts tounfold.]WAS THERE ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT ANY PROSTHETIC OR CRYSTAL-LIKESTRUCTURE REMOVED FROM INSIDE THE 6-FINGERED BEINGS? THAT WASAPPARENTLY SHOWN AS PART OF THE SANTILLI FILM ON TELEVISION.I don’t really recall that, but it was 40 years ago.IF THE AUTOPSY/DISSECTION FILM WAS SHOWN TO YOU IN 1957, TEN YEARSAFTER 1947, WAS THERE ANY KNOWLEDGE THEN AMONG THEINTELLIGENCE AGENCIES ABOUT WHAT THE ORIGIN OF THE 6-FINGEREDTYPE IS?At that time, I would say no. My boss and all were completely baffled about where theycame from. While I was there, the whole three years (1957-1960), we never saw anyinformation about where they came from or what they were doing here. My boss and Idiscussed why are they here? Why would they come to Earth? Where are they from?During that period of time, as far as I know, the government had no idea about why the6-fingered ones were here or what they were trying to do.FROM A MILITARY AND CIA POINT OF VIEW, WERE THE 6-FINGERED ONESCONSIDERED A THREAT?I would say not really a threat, but there was an unresolved question. The CIA wasworking to increase the different radars around the United States so they could detect more of the alien craft coming in if they come from outer space and would be able to"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"scramble jets to check them out - or shoot them down.WERE YOU EVER GIVEN A DEBRIEFING BETWEEN 1957 TO 1960 WITH MOREINFORMATION ABOUT THE AUTOPSY/DISSECTION FILM?Nothing beyond the film. I just saw the autopsy on that particular 6-fingered being withoutany further explanation. We had a few domestic, but mostly foreign sightings that we wentover.
