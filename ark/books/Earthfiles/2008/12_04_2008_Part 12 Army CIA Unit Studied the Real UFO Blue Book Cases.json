Jim at Area 51 said alien craft propulsion systemswere anti-magnetic and anti-gravitational on two of the craft and onehad an anti-matter type propulsion that was much more complicatedthan the other two.” - “Stein,” Former Army/CIA UFO Analyst Return to Part 1Return to Part 11December 4, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - My June 29, 1998, interview with Steinat his Florida home continues from Part 11. Howe: “WHAT OTHER FILES DID YOU LOOK THROUGH?Stein: “We looked through the WWII German file.THAT SAME DAY YOU SAW THE ROSWELL FILE?Yes, same day.WHAT WAS THAT FILE CALLED?‘End of World War II Agreements File,’ something like that. I thought it would be surrenderpapers from Germany, but when I opened the file up, it was something entirely differentfrom that.IS ANTHONY BARDEN READING THAT FILE WITH YOU?No, he was still in the Project Blue Book category. Later I went to get him and brought himto see the Roswell file and the German file. He read the German file first because hethought it was more exciting. In this particular file about end of WWII Germanyagreements, these documents were typed out with a script typewriter – script print. That’ssuper fancy, like if you typed up an expensive will and testament document. Real nicelooking. Anthony mentioned that he had never seen script form of typing in any otherdocuments he had ever seen. And the script print did not look like it belonged therebecause it wasn’t like government typewriters or teletypes we saw in most documents andfiles.WHAT WERE YOU READING?It mentioned movements at the end of WWII. It mentioned tracing where Adolph Hitlerhad left. Three weeks before the final end of the war when the Germans finallysurrendered, Hitler went in a small airplane to Norway – Hitler and Eva Braun both – andthe burned body outside of the basement stronghold where Hitler had been was his doubleand not him. The Russians knew that and found paperwork in regards to the body double.The Russians knew that it was not Hitler who died in the bunker.HOW DID PEOPLE KNOW HITLER HAD A DOUBLE?Even at the end of the war in the last days or weeks, Hitler had all the small children -those 11 through 13 – that were out shooting rifles in his youth program. There were allthese little kids with rifles and the news film showed Hitler coming out of his bunker andshaking hands with the kids. Hitler told them to do the best they could because Germany ‘isin your hands,’ having lost a lot of soldiers. So, Hitler told the children they had to do thework of men. In those films when he went out to see the children, Hitler looked very oldand decrepit, like he was very ill. The reason for that, I believe, is that Hitler’s double wasolder than the actual Adolph Hitler."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"HOW OLD WAS HITLER AT THE END OF WORLD WAR II?He was 56.Germany's Adolph Hitler, April 20, 1889to April 30, 1945. Image source: Wikipedia.Adolph Hitler signature. Source: Wikipedia.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia source - Adolf Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn,Austria-Hungary on April 20, 1889, and allegedly died April 30, 1945, inBerlin, Germany, amid controversy about whether a body double had diedinstead.Adolf Hitler became the leader of the National Socialist German WorkersParty or Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, abbreviated as Naziparty. Hitler was German Chancellor from 1933 to 1945 and Fuhrer undReichskanzler from 1934 to 1945. The German invasion of Poland in 1939caused the British and French nations to declare war on Germany. By 1945,Germany was in ruins. Hitler's bid for territorial conquest and establishment ofa “super Aryan race” caused the deaths of 43 million people, including thesystematic Holocaust genocide of some six million Jews. As Berlin wasinvaded by Allies, on April 29, 1945, Hitler married Eva Braun and allegedlythe two committed suicide in the Fuhrerbunker within 24 hours of marriage.Controversial Hitler Death PhotosAlthough the same person seems to be in both frames, a white area next to the facein the right image is not present in the left frame. The body and/or camera may have beenmoved,with one scene recast to nearly identically resemble the other, meaning perhaps a moreHitler-looking image on left replaced possible body double on right.

(Office of Strategic Services was CIA precursor)HAVE ACTUAL FIRSTHAND EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY THAT HITLER WASUSING A DOUBLE?On some of the forms in the Germany file at CIA Langley, it said definitely that our U. S.government knew Hitler had a body double from at least the spring of 1944. It alsomentioned that Hitler and Eva Braun flew in a small airplane to Norway and went fromthere to South America in a submarine. The only reason our OSS spies knew that Hitler wasin that plane is that Hitler had special buttons on his topcoat and a Fuhrer button was foundin the airplane that had ripped off his coat. He was in the backseat that had to be pushedforward in order to climb out of the airplane. Apparently that’s when his button hooked onthe edge of the backseat and tore off as he was getting out of the plane and was lodgedright there.IN THE DOCUMENT YOU WERE READING AT THE CIA LANGLEY ARCHIVE,WHERE DID IT SAY THAT HITLER AND EVA BRAUN WENT IN A SUBMARINE?The file said some of the submarines went to Antarctica and some went to Argentina. ButHitler went to Colombia, South America.IT SAID THAT IN THE DOCUMENT THAT HAD THE SCRIPT PRINT?Yes, that Hitler had a German base in southern Colombia, (northwestern South Americawest of Venezuela.) The document Anthony and I read said that Colombia is where AdolfHitler went. Then when he arrived, we in the U. S. had OSS people there who reported thatHitler had shaved off his moustache and he was very sad looking because Eva Braun diedin the submarine on the way to Colombia from a ruptured appendix.WHAT CITY IN COLOMBIA?I don’t know. The document just said southern Colombia where there was a Germanstronghold. The Germans had quite a bit of property in southern Colombia. There were alot of Germans already there that escaped earlier as everything was falling apart. Most ofthem went to Argentina, but there were some of the upper echelon that went to southernColombia, the big wheels like Hitler.WAS THERE ANYTHING IN THE DOCUMENT ABOUT HITLER AFTER HE WAS INCOLOMBIA? YOU WERE READING ABOUT A 1945 EVENT IN 1958, WHICH WASONLY THIRTEEN YEARS AFTER WWII ENDED.The form we were reading at the CIA archive was in a box dated 1946, and the documentswere dated like the summer of 1946, I believe. It was not a 1958 document. These wereolder WWII documents.WAS THERE ANYTHING IN FILES DATED LATER THAN 1946 ABOUT HITLER?No, the only reference in the 1946 document was about him in southern Colombia. Itmentioned where he was in a German stronghold and gave coordinates about north, westand so forth about where the stronghold was exactly. The document said Hitler was gettingdown in Colombia The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune and the Berlinnewspaper after the war. So, our OSS guys were tracking what mail Hitler was getting inColombia.IN 1958, DID ANTHONY BARDEN SAY ANYTHING ABOUT FINDING OUT MOREABOUT HITLER IN COLOMBIA?The only thing we found that was dated later was one small folder labeled ‘1948.’ Thatfolder is the one that mentioned that the United States had an expedition going toAntarctica with Admiral Richard Byrd. There were quite a few soldiers and a number ofaircraft. Some were on ships at sea. There were half a dozen ships. When they got down toAntarctica, the airplanes had skis so they could land on the glacier-packed areas. So, theyhad a sizable force. Also, there were jeeps sent down.DID THE DOCUMENT SAY WHY ADMIRAL BYRD WAS DOING THIS?The document in the CIA files said Byrd was sent to Antarctica by the U. S. government,but the cover story was a ‘scientific expedition’ to map out areas of Antarctica. It alsomentioned that Byrd et al encountered other military forces, allegedly Nazi forces basedthere. The document said our troops that we had sent there met strong resistance fromunidentified forces there – left over Nazis? Or aliens?[ Editor's Note: See Part 1 of this Earthfiles Real X-Files series."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Also, Wikipedia reports: “United States Antarctic Service Expedition(1939–1941), often referred to as Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd’s thirdAntarctic Expedition, was jointly sponsored by the U. S. Navy, StateDepartment, Department of the Interior, The Treasury and contributions byprivate citizens, corporations and institutions.“ A total of 125 men from military, government and science departed on thetwo ships of the United States Antarctic Service Expedition. The objectives ofthe Expedition were outlined in an order from President Franklin DelanoRoosevelt dated November 25, 1939. The President wanted two bases to beestablished: East Base, in the vicinity of Charcot Island and West Base, in thevicinity of King Edward VII Land. Also a site on the Bay of Whales at or nearLittle America was to be investigated, and delineation of the continental coastline between the meridians 72 degrees W., and 148 degrees W. Observationswere conducted in every conceivable area: seismic, cosmic ray, auroral,biological, tidal, magnetic and physiological. The expedition was cut short forreasons unknown and the evacuation of East Base was completed on March22, 1940. ] Stein: “We also found another file about the Vril technology. The first thing in the filewhen we opened it up was a British classified document, which was from the 1930s beforeWWII started. It showed that in Peenemunde, the Germans had developed the saucer craftwith an entirely different kind of propulsion system. Intelligence did not know exactly whatthe propulsion system was, but they knew that the craft did not burn any fossil fuels. It hada levitation device, I think is how they described it in the file.WAS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRIALS IN THE VRIL FILE?It did say there were mediums who had contacted aliens and there were messages fromaliens about how to build the levitation device for the anti-gravitational engine.DID ANTHONY BARDEN SEE THAT?Yes, and he said to me that the more we read, the more we had no idea about what hadreally gone on in WWII.HE WAS SEEING THE VRIL MATERIAL FOR THE FIRST TIME?Yes. We were hurrying through the files looking for references about alien beings, butdidn’t find much except a brief mention about some mediums contacting aliens concerninglevitation devices.ANTHONY BARDEN, WHO CAME FROM THE O.S.S. AND WWII AND KNEW SOMUCH, WHAT DID HE SAY?We only talked frankly when we got outside the CIA building. You had to watch what yousaid inside the CIA headquarters warehouse. We knew it was all electronically bugged.WHEN YOU WALKED OUTSIDE, YOU SAID ANTHONY BARDEN TURNED TOYOU AND SAID?‘I never expected to see this! I expected to see more on aliens, but I never expected to seethat WWII had so much to do with German technology. And when we saw the two saucercraft at Area 51, Anthony looked at me then and said, ‘Vril craft!’ The third big one withthe gun on the bottom Col. Jim also said was a ‘Vril craft.’ I saw information that some Vrilcraft went back to the early 1920s!WHAT WAS THE DIAMETER OF THE FIRST TWO SMALLER VRIL CRAFT?I think about 18 to 20 feet on the Vril craft. The middle alien craft were 30 to 40 feet indiameter and then the back craft were about 60 feet in diameter. Area 51 “Foreign Technology”2 Vril Craft - Germany?3 Alien Craft - Unknown Source?2 Large Craft - Germany? Other?OK, TRY TO MENTALLY PUT YOURSELF ON THE CATWALK AND YOU ARE"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"LOOKING OUT AT THE CRAFT AND TRY TO GIVE MORE DETAILS, STARTINGWITH THE FRONT TWO VRIL CRAFT.The two front Vril craft were almost identical. They were small, around 18 to 20 feetdiameter, and looked very light.WHAT WAS THE SHAP E ?A little slight bubble in the center, like just enough room for one person’s head. The craftsloped down around from the slight bubble.Then the next three larger craft were identified as ‘alien craft.’ There was one that wassome 30 feet in diameter at least, maybe 35 feet.WHAT ABOUT COLOR?The three alien craft were all silver-colored. Those three were not identical, but reasonablythe same and the biggest one had a raised dome or cabin on top.HOW ARE THE ALIEN ONES DIFFERENT FROM THE VRIL?The outcropping or cabin on top was a little bit higher on the Vril craft, maybe 3 feet highand below on the Vril craft, it was flat on the bottom.One alien craft had like three little rounded domes on the bottom. On conventional aircraft,you might think they were three radar domes, but on the bottom of the discs. These wereon the bottoms of the extraterrestrial craft.YOU DEFINITELY HEARD COL. JIM TELL YOU THAT THE THREE DISCS IN THEMIDDLE WERE EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT?Yes, ‘alien craft.’SO, THERE ARE THE TWO, DULL SILVERY, VRIL CRAFT IN FRONT THAT AREABOUT 18 TO 20 FEET IN DIAMETER. THEN THERE ARE THE THREE SHINYSILVER ‘ALIEN’ CRAFT IN THE MIDDLE THAT WERE 30 TO 35 FEET INDIAMETER.Yes, and one of the three alien craft a little further back behind the front two might havebeen 40 feet in diameter. The three alien craft were not the same diameters. They were likesmall, medium and large, like 30, 35 and 40 feet in diameter.And the designs were slightly different. The largest one had a very low cabin area, but thewhole craft were thicker than the other two smaller ones. The two smaller ones werethinner craft with higher center areas.DID ALL THREE HAVE THE THREE ROUNDED DOMES ON THE BOTTOM?No, just the larger one.WHAT WERE THE BOTTOMS LIKE ON THE TWO SMALLER ALIEN CRAFT?As far as I could see, they were just a smooth and slightly curved bottom. Nothing wasprotruding down.WHAT WAS THE SOURCE OF THE ALIEN CRAFT?Col. Jim said all three were from New Mexico.ANY SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATIONS?All Col. Jim said was, ‘We got these three alien craft from New Mexico.’ He didn’t specifya Roswell or other location. We saw one of the craft had been dismantled in one areabecause it was open on one side. We could see it was open, but from where we werestanding, we could not see from the back side inside. That possibly could have been one ofthe Roswell crashes they were studying for back-engineering and left it apart.DID COL. JIM SAY ANYTHING SPECIFIC ABOUT THE THREE ALIEN CRAFT?I asked him what the propulsion system was on the three alien craft. Col. Jim at Area 51said alien craft propulsion systems were anti-magnetic and anti-gravitational on two of thecraft and one had an anti-matter type propulsion that was much more complicated than theother two. Apparently they thought that the anti-matter propulsion was older and morecomplicated than the newer anti-gravitational systems in the other two craft.BEYOND THE FRONT TWO VRIL CRAFT, THE THREE ALIEN CRAFT IN THE"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MIDDLE, HOW MANY MORE WERE THERE IN THAT PAPOOSE MOUNTAIN CAVEHANGAR?There were two more. One was about 50 feet in diameter and is kind of a differentstructure. Those craft had much larger structures protruding upward, like maybe 8 or 10feet above the disc. And below on those, one was just a slightly curved bottom but mostlyflat. The other one also had just a curved bottom, but it had a gun emplacement of somekind hanging from it. Col. Jim said the Germans called it a ‘death ray,’ something they hadbeen developing in early WWII.DID COL. JIM SAY THOSE TWO LARGER CRAFT IN THE BACK WERE GERMAN?Yes, German craft and they found them, I believe, in Germany in the back of theMesserschmitt aircraft plant down in southern Germany near Austria.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Messerschmitt AG was a famous German aircraftmanufacturer, known primarily for its World War II fighter aircraft, notablythe Bf 109 and Me 262. The company survived in the post-war era,undergoing a number of mergers and changing its name from Messerschmitt toMesserschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm before being bought by DASA in 1989, nowpart of EADS.]SO WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN PEENEMUNDE?In the 1930s, Germany was building the Vril craft there. Then later on, Germany startedbuilding V-1 and V-2 rockets for a big push to attack England. All the other craft andtechnologies were moved away from Peenemunde and the two large discs at Area 51 hadbeen moved to the Messerschmitt plant.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Peenemünde is a village in northeastern Germany,part of Usedom island. It stands near the mouth of the Peene river, on theeasternmost part of the German Baltic coast. Shortly before and during theWW II, a military center was set up at Peenemünde for developing and testingguided missiles, in particular the V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket. The locationpermitted rocket test flights over water with monitoring along about 320kilometers of the Pomeranian coast. Peenemunde also developed WWII night-navigation and radar systems.] If Vril Craft Existed, Why Didn’t HitlerUse “Wonder Weapons” in WWII?“The wonder weapons are the hope. It is laughable andsenseless for us to threaten at this moment, without a basis inreality for these threats. The well-known mass destruction bombsare nearly ready. In only a few days, with the utmost meticulousintelligence, Hitler will probably execute this fearful blow,because he will have full confidence.... It appears that there arethree bombs and each has an astonishing operation. Theconstruction of each unit is fearfully complex and of a lengthytime of completion.” - Benito Mussolini, April 22, 1945,Political Testament"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Italy's Benito Mussolini giving Roman salute standingnext to Germany's Adolph Hitler on a reviewing stand during an officialvisit to occupied Yugoslavia, sometime between 1941 and 1943.Image by Istituto Luce, Italian fascist news agency.“We have invisible aircraft, submarines, colossal tanks andcannon, unbelievably powerful rockets, and a bomb with aworking that will astonish the whole world. The enemy knowsthis, and besieges and attempts to destroy us. But we will answerthis destruction with a storm and that without unleashing abacteriological war, for which we are also prepared.... All mywords are the purest truth. That you will see. We still have thingsthat need to be finished, and when they are finished, they willturn the tide.” - Adolf Hitler, March 13, 1945, addressingGerman Ninth Army Officers DID YOU OR YOUR BOSS ASK COL. JIM - IF THE GERMANS HAD SUCH CRAFTWITH A RAY GUN UNDERNEATH - WHY DIDN’T HITLER USE THE ‘DEATH RAY’IN WWII?Yes, we did ask. Col. Jim said he understood that Hitler chose not to use them, that thesewere the ‘wonder weapons’ that Mussolini and Hitler mentioned. Many people thought theGerman V-1, V-2 and V-3 rockets were the Nazi ‘wonder weapons,’ but that was not true.The discs were the wonder weapons with their speed and anti-gravitational technology.YOU WERE AT AREA 51 HOW LONG AFTER YOUR TRIP WITH ANTHONYBARDEN TO THE CIA LANGLEY HEADQUARTERS BASEMENT ARCHIVE?The June 1958 Langley trip was two months before the August 1958 trip to Area 51.AND YOU WERE SHOWN THE BLACK AND WHITE 16MM AUTOPSY FILM ATTHE SOUTHEASTERN MILITARY BASE TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE AREA 51TRIP?Ye s .SO AFTER ALL THAT, AFTER YOU GET TO AREA 51 IN AUGUST 1958 AND ARESTANDING ON THE WALKWAY WITH ANTHONY BARDEN, COL.

Jim said was, ‘They told me since I’ve been here thatthese three alien craft were retrieved from New Mexico, but I don’t know which one iswhich or exactly from where. All I know is all three are supposed to be from New Mexico.’THAT’S ALL COL. JIM SAID?That’s it.DID HE KNOW WHERE THE FOUR VRIL-TYPE CRAFT CAME FROM?The other four Col.

I saw pictures similar to the Santillifilm with the symbols on it and they had several printed pages fastened to the drawings thatdescribed how the 6-fingered panels worked with fingertip controls. The controls were tiedto fibers that at first they could not identify how they worked. They saw little fibersrunning off to the end that plugged in and they did not know it was fiber optics becausethey had not been invented! In the printed pages that went with the drawings of the panels,they described ‘fiber filaments.’T H AT ’ S W H AT I N V E S T I G AT O R S L O O K E D AT U N D E R A M I C R O S C O P E ?Yes. It described them checking at least one of the hand panels and found that all the ‘fiberfilaments’ that we now know are fiber optics were all tied into the electrical currentthroughout the craft. It also said in that printed text that there were so many ‘fiberfilaments’ in that craft that when it was picked up from the crash site, it had a slight glow toit from all the fiber optics in it. The craft glowed in the dark! The pages attached to the6-fingered panel drawings said that all the walls of the craft glowed, everything was wiredin this Roswell craft for electrical current.WHEN THE BEINGS HAD THEIR HANDS PLACED INTO THE PANELS, WHATHAPPENED?Our investigators came to understand that the 6-fingered imprinted panels controlled all thecraft’s functioning, including the anti-gravitational device. Our investigators did not knowwhich finger did what on the control panel, but they knew all the fingers were primary tocomplete control of the craft, a craft apparently entirely guided by the beings’ hands.WHEN THEIR HANDS WERE IN THE PANELS THAT WERE FIBER OPTICALLYCONNECTED TO THE CRAFT, DIDN’T YOU MENTION READING ABOUT THEENTIRE CRAFT BECOMING A CAPACITOR?On the print out that I saw in the Roswell file, the investigators did not find a distinct powerplant in the Roswell craft they were studying.

Naturally our brains would be different fromtheirs and whatever caused the craft to go one way or the other for the aliens didn’t workfor the human brains.We now use head bands in fighter jet helmets hooked up so when the pilot looks to theright, the guns will turn in that direction.

The film was about ten years old when I and our teamsaw it. They just said this is the only film of the aliens and the body. There are photos takenby various citizens showing these aliens outside their craft walking around. But this is theonly film that shows a close picture of the aliens and exactly what they look like. So, if yourun across any more of these sightings that describe this particular 6-fingered being, youcan compare against this film.DID YOU EVER SEE THE SYMBOLS ON THE I-BEAMS IN THE SANTILLI FILM?Yes, and it was listed on documents as ‘alien hieroglyphics.’ Before I left the militaryservice, I saw more information that the hieroglyphics were actually ancient Greek.THAT’S WHAT I REPORTED IN MY BOOK, GLIMPSES OF OTHER REALITIES, VOL.II: HIGH STRANGENESS, BECAUSE IT WAS EASY TO MATCH THE SANTILLISYMBOLS WITH ANCIENT GREEK. SO, WHY WOULDN’T THE INTELLIGENCEOPERATIVES IN 1947 HAVE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED GREEK LETTERS?Yeah, in the reports where it mentioned alien hieroglyphics, I saw one paragraph on the lastpage of it that said some letters compared to early Greek.
