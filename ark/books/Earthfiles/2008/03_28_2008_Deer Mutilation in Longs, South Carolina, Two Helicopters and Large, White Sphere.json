No blood.So, it was a very,very strange occurrence.” - Retired Broadcast Engineer, New YorkLongs, South Carolina (red circle) is near the North Carolina border northeastof Myrtle Beach, a resort town and home of Myrtle Beach AFB until its closure in 1993.March 28, 2008 Longs, South Carolina - This week I received an email from a retiredbroadcasting engineer. He and his wife are currently spending the winter in Longs, SouthCarolina, near North Myrtle Beach. Their permanent residence is in New York State. Thecouple traveled to a recreational vehicle park in October 2007, where they have beenliving until they return to New York on April 1st. Last Thursday, March 20th, the husband– who has asked I not use his name – drove his car to a store, taking Southern HeightsDrive towards Route 905. At that intersection, there is a small open field and he could seea deer down on its right side.Intersection of Turkey Pen Road and Highway 905 in Longs, South Carolina.Mutilated deer found in field near intersection on Thursday, March 20, 2008,by retired broadcasting engineer who took this and other photos in this Earthfiles.com report.Interview:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"New York Resident, retired broadcasting engineer wintering in Longs, SouthCarolina, near North Myrtle Beach: “So, what I did was pull off to the side of the roadand noticed the deer was missing certain parts of its body. But at the time I didn’t have mycamera.Mutilated deer in field at intersection of Turkey Pen Road and Highway 905in Longs, South Carolina, northeast of Myrtle Beach. Retired broadcasting engineer found deeron morning of Thursday, March 20, 2008, but did not have his camera. He went back onFriday morning, March 21, 2008, to take this and other photographs in this Earthfiles.com report.WHAT WERE YOU LOOKING AT WITH YOUR EYES THAT WAS MISSING?The side of the cheek was cut away. Both of the eyes were missing. The rear of the animallooked like it was cored out perfectly in a 3 to 4 inch diameter hole and the insides weremissing. That’s my observation about three to four feet over the animal, close-up lookingdown at the animal.COULD YOU SEE ANY BLOOD OR FLUID?No, that was the odd thing. There was no blood at all at any of the incisions or any of themissing organs.WHAT DID YOU DECIDE TO DO?I continued on my way and started thinking about why that animal was there and why itlooked the way it did. So, the next day, I did return with my camera the next morning,Friday, at 9:30 AM.This deer was more than 20 to 25 feet away from the road, so it could not have been amotor accident. All of its legs were intact and the side of the body. The deer was just lyingthere, except it was missing the two eyes, the side of the cheek and the rear of the animalwas completely cored out. No blood. So, it was a very,very strange occurrence."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHEN YOU WENT BACK THE NEXT DAY WITH YOUR CAMERA, THAT MEANSA WHOLE DAY AND ANOTHER NIGHT WOULD HAVE ELAPSED. DID YOU SEEANY SIGNS OF PREDATOR HAVING CHEWED OR GNAWED ON THE DEER?Yes, when I went back the next morning at around 9:30 AM, I noticed that the rear of theanimal had a little damage to it. There had been a very smooth and round opening (in rear),and when I returned on Friday morning, I noticed that the (rectal) opening was picked on alittle.Photograph on Friday, March 21, 2008, twenty-four hours after the retired broadcastengineer originally found the mutilated deer and went back to take photographs. The morningof Thursday, March 20, 2008, he said the rectal hole was perfectly round and clean.By Friday morning, it appeared to have been pulled open. But a week later on March 26, 2008,no natural predator had touched the mutilated deer carcass further.SO, IN THE PHOTOGRAPH YOU EMAILED ME, IT SHOWS THE REAR OPENEDUP A LITTLE. BUT IF I WERE LOOKING AT IT THROUGH YOUR EYES ONTHURSDAY MORNING, MARCH 20,IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A PERFECT HOLE?Yes, a perfect circle, with none of that tissue opened up and exposed. None of the meat ortissue was pulled and chewed on Thursday morning. It would have been a perfect holewithout any damage to the surrounding tissue whatsoever.DID YOU DECIDE TO REPORT THIS TO ANY AUTHORITIES?No, because usually the road department down here comes by and picks it up (dead deercarcasses). They generally remove the (dead) animals in two or three days and usually thevultures are starting already to eat the animal.I still find it very strange that no vultures – and there are many vultures here in this region– vultures have been flying over the deer carcass. I approached recently and a vulture wasstanding near the mutilated deer, but then it took off. But I find it to be very strangebecause there was a deer kill on the same road. That other deer was a road kill and it fellinto a ditch. From that day onward, the vultures were there – five, six, seven, eight of them"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"- picking on the carcass.But the carcass we’re talking about (mutilated deer) is still intact and nothing isapproaching it – no wild animals or wild birds. What does that mean?THE MUTILATED ANIMAL IS GIVING OFF SOMETHING THAT THE NATURALPREDATORS DO NOT LIKE. AND IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY, AS WE SPEAKON WEDNESDAY, MARCH 26, 2008, THE MUTILATED DEER IS STILL LAYING INTHE CORNER OF THE FIELD UNMOVED BY ANYONE?Exactly. I was out there yesterday afternoon (March 25) about 1:30 in the afternoon andit’s still there, yes.SO, EVEN THE ROAD KILL PICK UP CREW DID NOT PICK UP THAT DEER?That’s right.ANY EXPLANATION?I have no explanation. Two Helicopters and Large, White SphereTHAT WAS ON MARCH 20TH WHEN YOU FIRST FOUND THE DEER. FROM YOUREMAIL, IT WAS ABOUT ONE WEEK EARLIER IN THE NIGHT THAT SOMETHINGVERY UNUSUAL OCCURRED THAT YOU SAW WITH YOUR OWN EYES?Yes. About one week earlier around 10 PM – the reason I know the time was that we havetwo small dogs and we generally take them out between 10 and 10:30 PM for their lastwalk. As I was leaving the trailer and walking toward the tree line, these - I heard a noise,a soft noise that became louder and seemed to be coming from the left. As I looked, Iheard a much louder roar of the first helicopter coming out over the trees and into an openarea over a small lake. Then, following the helicopter – it looked as though it was a verylarge beam of light. But when I looked at it closely, it seemed to be round (sphere). Fromwhere I was and where the object was, I would say it was about 5 to 7 feet in diameter.SO THIS IS A ROUND, GLOWING BALL BETWEEN TWO HELICOPTERS AND THEBALL THAT IS GLOWING IS AT LEAST 5 TO 7 FEET IN DIAMETER?Yes. And it was a bright, white light. It was not flashing or changing colors. It was just asteady, continuous white light. It turned out that the (spherical) light changed distancebetween the first and second helicopters.YOU SAW IT MOVE IN FORWARD OR BACKWARD MOTION?That’s right, in a forward or backward motion. And then it was from my left to the right.And then it disappeared over the trees. So, I only saw it for about 30 seconds at the mostand then it disappeared over the trees and just continued and the sounds of the twohelicopters became less and less until they finally disappeared.THEY JUST KEPT MOVING IN THIS TRIAD OUT OF SIGHT.Yes. And the distance from where I was standing with my two small pets to the helicopterline of flight probably was five to six blocks – so I would say it was a good 1,000 feet infront of me.DID YOU ASK ANYBODY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OR AROUND IF THEY KNEWWHAT THE MILITARY WOULD BE DOING WITH A LARGE, WHITE, GLOWINGSP HERE?No, I didn’t.” Two Helicopters and Red, Glowing Spherein Savernake Forest, Wiltshire, England, August 2005On August 17, 2006, at the Silent Circle Cafe in Cherhill, Wiltshire, England, I met andtalked with Kate Fenn about an encounter she and a colleague had with militaryhelicopters, which seemed to be aggressively interacting with a large, red, glowing sphereabove a crop formation in the Savernake Forest near Marlborough. The date of herencounter was in early August 2005. See: 081706Earthfiles."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Kate Fenn is the Community Care Officer for the Adult Health and Social Care Team atSavernake Hospital in Marlborough. Kate and one of her hospital colleagues were drivingtoward Ramsbury on the Stitchcomb farm road in the Savernake Forest.Savernake Forest and surrounding crop fields are southeast of Marlborough,Wiltshire County, England. Stitchcombe Road runs through the forest and fields.Interview:Kate Fenn, Community Care Officer, Adult Health and Social Care Team, SavernakeHospital, Marlborough, Wiltshire, England: “ It was a sunny, bright day about 11 a.m.There was no wind, but suddenly we saw trees moving wildly in the forest and wonderedwhat was happening? Then we could hear helicopters. Two were very close by, very loudand roared over the top of the car. They were black military helicopters and we wonderedwhat they were doing in this area, because we don’t tend to see those particularhelicopters. We are close to the flight path of RAF Lyneman and are very aware of whatflies over most of the time, particularly in the summer months when it is light.These two helicopters were making the trees very, very wild, and my friend was quitescared because they were very low and the noise from them was vibrating through the car.So we slowed up to see where they had gone and we actually found they had gone into oneof the first fields you come to when you take that little road.I decided to pull over and have a look at exactly what they were doing because theyappeared to be hovering there at that time. The noise was extraordinary! The trees werequite wild around us. I saw a luminous red ball of light that was underneath the helicoptersand was moving independently from them without any effort at all. The type of red itglowed was kind of ketchup red, a tomato red, which seemed to be contained in the form,which would have been about five feet in diameter. Not that great a size, but the spherewas moving quite rapidly when it chose to. The light seemed to be conscious withintelligence and moved across the triangle formation that was there, which was situateddown in a dip in the land. We were very aware of this ball of light moving, almost playingwith these helicopters. The helicopters were just above it, trying to follow it across thefield. But the light didn’t seem to be perturbed by the two helicopters at all.Illustration with Kate Fenn for Earthfiles of the first two military helicopters in early August 2005,which moved aggressively above the 5-foot-diameter red, glowing sphere. Below the helicopters"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"and the red sphere was the 78-triangle fractal pattern (rings around triangle symbolize the complicatedformation) in Savernake Forest wheat field near Marlborough, first reported on July 19, 2005.We stood and watched for a few minutes. The helicopters came back again and werejoined by two other helicopters (for a total of four). So, it was almost like a full-scaleexercise going on out there in the middle of Savernake Forest, which is certainly notnormal. Then a helicopter came across to us in the car and we were very aware that wewere not wanted there. My friend and colleague was very frightened. Since we had anappointment to get to as well, we decided to leave. That red sphere of light was notconnected in any way to the helicopters. It was quite independent of them. It seemed thento just shoot off. You couldn’t see it because it moved so fast.Later on that particular day, when we got back to the hospital everybody that works therehad been very aware of the activity of these military helicopters because they had flown solow over the hospital itself.”Seventy-eight triangles in fractal pattern were reported in Savernake Forest wheatfield near Marlborough, Wiltshire, England, on July 19, 2005.
