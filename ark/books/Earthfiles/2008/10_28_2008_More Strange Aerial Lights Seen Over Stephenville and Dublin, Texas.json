Dublin is about eight milessouthwest and has a population of 3,754. Straight east of Dublin about ten miles is Selden witha full time population of about seven. Brownwood in lower left is about 33 miles southwest of Dublin and inthe flight path of jets traveling to and from the Brownwood Military Operation Area (MOA) . October 28, 2008 Stephenville, Texas - On Tuesday night, October 21, 2008, around8:30 PM, Sherry Sechrist and her family noticed lights in the sky. Using her cell phone,Sherry snapped a few still images, while her mother shot some video on her cell phone.Sherry told Stephenville Empire-Tribune reporter, Whitney White-Ashley, that “the lights"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"would flash and move up and down and side-to-side. She could hear jets buzzing aroundthe lights, but doesn't think the jets produced the lights. ‘I'd like to know what goes inreverse,’ Sechrist said. ‘The lights would fly over and then they would stay still.’”Then on Thursday night, October 23, 2008, phones at the newspaper and local lawenforcement really began to ring. Here are some highlights from eyewitnesses between8:00 PM and 9:00 PM Central:- 8:00 PM, Juli Gibson, southwestern Erath County, was riding her horsewhen she saw “four white lights flashing on and off. ‘It's like they weretalking to each other. It was just weird.’”- 8:15 PM, Monica Diaz, near the Stephenville High School, saw four lights ina straight line “turn on and off individually, but they would move as a group”for about 30 seconds without noise.- Around 8:30 PM, Nick Horn, west of Stephenville, saw an orange light in thesky soon followed by jets. He videotaped about twenty seconds of lightsmoving across the dark night sky. Nick described the orange light as “a metalobject hovering about 400 feet in the air” that moved toward Dublin.- 8:30 PM, John Darby and daughter, on Highway 76 near Selden, saw smalland orange lights that “grew larger and began to display different colors in abeach ball-like pattern. Then they disappeared.” They Darby saw about ninejets moving fast as if “they were doing maneuvers with some kind of tracers.”- 8:30 PM, Charlie Carrasco, Stephenville, watched two fighter jets flying lowto the ground “chasing flashes of light in the air.”- 8:30 PM, Ashley Ainsworth was driving outside of Stephenville on Highway377 when she and other drivers pulled over to watch six yellow lights move ina circular motion. Next the lights disappeared and then reappeared by blinkingon and off.- 8:40 PM, Ashleigh Cole, 10 miles south of Dublin, saw “three lights in a rowthat would move straight up in the sky and at an angle.”- 8:45 PM, Darlene Ross, northwest of Stephenville near Ranger, saw twoorange lights turn into four lights stacked in a vertical line. “It was just theweirdest thing I ever saw in my entire life. It was acting weird and it wasscary.”- 9 PM, D'Ann Wheeler, southeast of Stephenville in Hico, was with a friendas they watched “two sets of string of pearls” lights in the sky with soundless“jets all around them.” 8:30 PM “Very Odd Lights” Above HendersonJunior High Football Stadium, StephenvilleBrent Chambers is the brother of Angelia Joiner, former reporter at the StephenvilleEmpire-Tribune during the January to February 2008 UFO flap in the Stephenville, Dublin,Selden region. Angelia felt forced to resign because newspaper management wanted to endUFO reporting in the paper. [ See 022208 Earthfiles.] Brent is 42-years-old and he andAngelia were born and raised in Stephenville. After high school graduation, Brent becamea truck mechanic, drove trucks and is now a truck mechanic for Ingram Enterprises LP inStephenville.Ironically, with his sister's frontline reporting during the January to February 2008 UFOflap, Brent never saw any unusual lights in the sky. Now, on Thursday night, October 23,2008, at 8:30 PM, he and his wife saw three “very odd lights” move in the sky above theHenderson Junior High Football Stadium about 1.5 miles from Stephenville's City Hall.Interview:Brent Chambers, Truck Mechanic, Ingram Enterprises LP, Stephenville, Texas: “Wehad eaten supper that night at a local restaurant and after we left the restaurant, we werecoming down a street that we live on, which is Frey Street. We were going to go and lookat some Halloween decorations on the other side of town. Driving down Frey, going fromeast to west, when we got down to where the Gilbert Intermediate School is, my wife and Inoticed there were some very odd looking lights in the sky. I mentioned to her the lights"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"and she said, ‘That’s an airplane.’ But when we cleared the trees a little bit, we bothdecided that it was not an airplane that we were looking at because the lights were just realodd looking.COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHAT WAS SO ODD ABOUT THE THREE LIGHTS?Normally if you look into a bright light, you’ll see glare coming off the light - like if youlook at a car headlight, you don’t actually see the real dimensions of the light. You see thebrightness coming off of it and the glare.Well, these lights on whatever we saw were perfectly round, but they were not glaringlights. They were bright – it’s hard to explain because it was not like a light that would beshining at something to illuminate it. The lights were just lights in the sky.COLORS?No, what I saw was just really, really pure white color.SIZE ?At arm's length, something like the size of a pea. But we had no idea how far away theywere so it's hard to judge size.ANYTHING ABOUT THE LIGHT THAT PULSED?No, no pulsing or anything like that. They were real steady burning. That’s what made it soodd because any normal light you look at, for the most part, has got glare that comes withit. Like the lights at the football stadium – there was glare coming off those. But the lightsup in the sky, each was like a perfect circle of white light and no glare to it.So, we ended up pulling into the parking lot of Gilbert Intermediate (5th and 6th graders),which actually overlooks the direction that we were facing, over the Henderson JuniorHigh School and its football stadium. They had a football game going on at the time. Theseodd lights that we saw were directly above the football field, right above the stadium lights– probably 30 or 40 feet above the lights. But I don’t know how far away they were. Wecouldn’t really tell because of the brightness of the stadium lights and the Gilbert schoolparking lot we pulled into had parking lights in it. Light Rotate Counterclockwisefrom Horizontal to VerticalSo, we couldn’t really see an object in the sky, but we could see three lights that wereequal distant apart and all equal in size. They started out almost being horizontal (straightline) and then all three of them would shift around counterclockwise to the verticalposition. Then, they would disappear. Then as soon as those three lights would disappear,it would take maybe one or two seconds and another set of three lights would reappearback in the horizontal position again. It would make that sequence where it would go fromhorizontal back to vertical and then would disappear.IF YOU HAVE THREE LIGHTS THAT ARE SEPARATED IN A STRAIGHT LINE,HOW DID THEY MOVE TO FORM THE VERTICAL STRAIGHT LINE?If you had a pencil in front of you and you imagine there were three lights on that pencil –one at either end and one in the center equal distance apart – and you took that pencil andturned it from horizontal to vertical with all the lights staying the same distance from eachother, that’s how this happened in a counterclockwise motion.DID IT HAPPEN RAPIDLY?No, it wasn’t real rapid or like blinking lights or flashing lights. They were steady burningand it just moved to the vertical in two or three seconds and then they extinguished for asecond or two and then they appeared again horizontal and repeated that same pattern. I’mgoing to estimate the three lights did that probably six times, but only one time for surethat I could tell what the pattern was in front of us in the parking lot because we hadfinally got clear of the trees and able to see it in its entirety. Looking through the treesdriving down Frey Street, we could see the lights were moving, but I couldn’t tell youexactly how they were moving when we were driving.HOW LONG DID THE THREE LIGHTS HOLD IN THE HORIZONTAL POSITIONBEFORE MOVING UP TO THE VERTICAL?Probably not more than a couple of seconds."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THEN IT WOULD HOLD VERTICAL FOR HOW LONG?It wasn’t very long, about the same amount of time it held the horizontal – just a couple ofseconds. Then, they all extinguished at the same time. It’s like they were all lit up and thenthey moved around counterclockwise to the vertical position and then they all went outand then in a couple of seconds after those three went out, there would be three moreshow up in the horizontal position. Witnesses At the Football Game?COULD YOU SEE PEOPLE IN THE FOOTBALL STANDS?I couldn’t see people in the stands. I could only see the lights at the stadium because theyare just right above the treetop level where we were. While we were in the parking lot andthe photo that I snapped at, I think, 8:34 PM is what my cell phone says. Then we watchedto see if anything else was going on and the lights from the stadium went out. I guess thefootball game was over and people started leaving the stadium coming our direction. Thenwe come to find out that people at the stadium actually did see the lights, too. Then we hadpeople pulling into the parking lot where we were, trying to see what was going on. But wenever spoke to anyone there.IS THE ONE CELL PHONE IMAGE THE ONLY ONE YOU TOOK?Yes, it’s the only one that I have. I was talking on one cell phone (with sister AngeliaJoiner) and I was trying to take pictures with a cell phone I wasn’t familiar with and that’swhy the one photo that I have is so bad (only shows two of three lights in horizontal line).I'm going to start carrying a camera with me!”Enlarged original cell phone image taken at 8:34 PM in Stephenville, Texas,overlooking the Henderson Junior High football stadium. Four stadium lights are bottomof frame. Two of three unidentified aerial lights in straight line near centerand top center. Image © 2008 by Brent Chambers. When Brent was reporting the odd, moving lights to his sister, Angelia, on one cell phonewhile trying to use another cell phone to photograph them above the Henderson footballstadium, Angelia told her brother that where she was in Dublin, eight miles southwest ofStephenville, she could see several jets and what she thought were flares being dropped.Angelia e-mailed me, “ I honestly wonder if the flares were dropped just so the militarycould make a case of saying that is what people saw. Carswell AFB said they had 7 jetsoperating in the area. There were a lot of jets. I thought more than that.”Brent Chambers said after the stadium lights went out that he and his wife watched the skyfor awhile from the Gilbert parking lot. Eventually, the couple saw two jets flying high inthe sky without any flares.United States Air Force Reserve Major Karl Lewis, Public Affairs Officer at the Naval AirStation Joint Reserve Base in Fort Worth, e-mailed the Stephenville Empire-Tribune:“Seven F-16s from the 457th fighter squadron flew from Naval Air Station Joint ReserveBase Fort Worth to the Brownwood Military Operation Area (MOA) for normal trainingoperations, Thursday, 23 October 2008, from approximately 7:30 p.m. to 9 p.m. localtime.”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Other Lights in Selden That Changedfrom Horizontal to VerticalExcerpt Reprint of Archived 022208 Earthfiles.On the night of January 8, 2008, dozens of eyewitnesses in the region of Texas southwestof Dallas/Fort Worth reported seeing strange combinations of flashing lights in the sky.Everyone said the lights were either on a single huge craft or were in rigid formation. Allagreed that the lights pulsed on and off, but not together. One light would come on and gooff while one or more at random distances would flash on and off.The earliest high strangeness that night began around 6:12 PM in Selden, Texas. Fifty-year-old Steve Allen is Owner, President and CEO of L & S Enterprises and Texas Freight,a trucking and transportation brokerage company in Glen Rose, Texas, which he foundedwith his wife, Laquita, in 1994. Steve has also been a civilian pilot since the late 1970swhen he learned to fly. As the sun was near setting, Steve traveled from his Glen Roseoffice to a hill in nearby Selden to sit by a campfire and relax before dark with hislong-time friend, Mike Odam, and a local postal worker, Lance Jones. Steve said the sunwas still about half way above the horizon when astonishing aerial events occurred in theclear, cloudless sky.Steve Allen, Owner, President and CEO, L & S Enterprises and Texas Freight,Glen Rose, Texas, on January 31, 2008.

That’s when I asked Mike Odam and Lance Jones ifthey were seeing what I was seeing. They said yes.WHAT COLORS WERE YOU SEEING?Bright, white lights. Very bright and intense. They were large."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Selden, Texas, hillside and campfire at 6:12 PM on January 8, 2008.Eyewitnesses of four bright lights in mile-long by 1/2-mile wide rectangle patternwere Steve Allen, Mike Odam and Lance Jones. All sketches © 2008 for Earthfiles by Steve Allen.A FULL MOON AT ARM’S LENGTH CAN BE COVERED BY THE TIP OF A LITTLEFINGERNAIL.I estimate that each of those four lights were about the size of a quarter at arm’s length.WHAT WE DON’T KNOW PRECISELY IS THE DISTANCE FROM YOU TO THATQUARTER-SIZE LIGHT AT ARM’S LENGTH DISTANCE?Correct. I could see where the craft was flying over. That’s my regular area of flight whenI fly my airplane. So, I’m pretty familiar with the area and approximate altitude.WHEN THE FOUR LIGHTS FIRST APPEARED, WERE THEY IN A STRAIGHT LINEOR PATTERN?It appeared to be a rectangular pattern and they were all level and traveling at the samerate of speed and same distance apart.IS THIS THEN THE FIRST RECTANGLE WITH A LIGHT AT EACH CORNER THATYOU DESCRIBED AS A MILE LONG AND A HALF MILE WIDE?Correct. That was a conservative estimate, but that was about as close as I could get. Theway I got my distances was by the land that has grid sections. I waited until the craft goteven with us and then did a visual from the ground to the sky and could tell what a milewas due to the section rows out there and came to my mile long conclusion. And itappeared to be half as wide as it was long.WAS IT ONE LARGE OBJECT THAT HAD FOUR LIGHTS IN A RECTANGULARPATTERN? OR FOUR COMPLETELY SEPARATE OBJECTS THAT WERE INFORMATION?We couldn’t confirm for sure what it was, but just the way the lights traveled, we felt likeit was one big thing. We talked about the flying-in-formation scenario, but the three of usthought it was more likely to be one, huge, single craft. Mile-Long Rectangle of Four Lights Traveled“Between 2,000 and 3,000 mph”It seemed like the rectangle of lights was traveling at a very high rate of speed. My originalestimate was between 2,000 and 3,000 mph. It was gradually slowing down as we watchedand came into range 15 to 20 miles away. By the time it got even with us, it was travelinglike a normal aircraft speed, probably anywhere around the 200 to 300 mph range. Bythen, the lights were traveling about 2,500 to 3,000 feet above ground level andapproximately one-half mile north of our Selden hilltop location. As the rectangle of lights"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"went past us, that’s when the ‘show’ started. As the lights in the rear – or two corner lights– came past us, more lights appeared in the rear. I think there was seven. It went on intoStephenville, which was seven or eight more miles into town as a bird flies.YOU HAD FOUR LIGHTS IN FOUR CORNERS MAKING A RECTANGLE PERHAPSA MILE LONG AND A HALF MILE WIDE.Right, and the lights were flashing (randomly). Four Lights Became Nine LightsWHERE DID THE OTHER FIVE LIGHTS APPEAR IN THE REAR?That happened after it went past us. That’s when we could see the rear of whatever it was- or at least we think that was the rear of it. After it came to dead even with us, it wentpast us and we noticed the rest of the lights come on.At 6:13 PM on January 8, 2008, the rear two large, white lights of rectangle patternchange into seven equally spaced large, white lights. Front two lights remain in original position.They were equally spaced apart in this half-mile distance across the rear. They wereexactly level with each other, exactly horizontal. They also were very bright. Theyappeared as the same intensity as the four corner lights. They were flashing in no particularpattern. One would flash and then another. There was no rhythm or pattern to itwhatsoever, the flashes.SO, FIVE MORE LIGHTS WERE ADDED TO THE REAR ON THAT RECTANGLE INA STRAIGHT LINE AND THEY SEEM TO BE EQUALLY SEPARATED – THE SAMESIZE, THE SAME WHITE LIGHT INTENSITY.Correct. And each light in a random scenario would go all the way out. It wasn’t like theywould go to a dim glow or pulsing. It was like a turn indicator off and on. There was norhyme or reason which one would go on or off. There was no rhythm to them.As the rectangle of lights passed by us, it was gradually slowing down. It got to the edge ofStephenville and came to a complete stop. It had not changed altitude any. It was still atthe 2,500 to 3,000 foot altitude. Then very suddenly, the lights in the rear reconfiguredinto an arch going upward like a bow in a bow and arrow.Seven horizontal rear lights suddenly change to an arch patternof equally spaced, bright, white lights.THE LIGHTS WERE A HORIZONTAL LINE AND THEN FORMED A HALF CIRCLE?That’s a good scenario – more like a football turned sideways arch. That lasted for three orfour seconds and then the lights suddenly appeared into a vertical line. The lights were stillflashing with no rhythm or course of action. They were just intermittently flashing.DO YOU MEAN THAT ALL NINE LIGHTS SUDDENLY FORMED A STRAIGHT,VERTICAL LINE?I believe it was just the seven in the rear all formed a vertical line.DID THE LIGHTS CHANGE FORMATION LIKE ICE SKATERS?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"No, they just instantly reconfigured.YOU SAW THE HORIZONTAL LINE OF THE SEVEN LIGHTS. THEN THE NEXTMICROSECOND, THEY WERE IN A VERTICAL LINE?Ye s .THEY WERE ALL WHITE?Yes, actually the vertical line came from the arched bow. The lights were horizontal andthen went to a bow and then went to a vertical line. Then about two or three seconds later,it became two sets of the vertical lights. They appeared to be about quarter to a half mileapart. And they were all flashing like they had been before.Arch of white lights changed suddenly to one vertical line of seven lights,followed in a couple of seconds by the appearance of a second vertical line of seven lights.Two Vertical Lines of Lights Transformedinto Rectangles of White FireThe two vertical lines of seven, bright, white lights suddenly transform into two largerectangles of white flames moving inside the rectangular frames. Steve Allen estimated the heightsof the rectangular frames to be 150 yards; the width of the rectangles to be 50 yards;and a distance of 1/4 of a mile between the two rectangles of white fire.Then in two or three more seconds, the two vertical lines of flashing lights turned intowhite flames. It looked like the flames were contained inside two rectangular shaped3-dimensional frames about 50 yards wide and about 150 yards tall."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"WHEN YOU SAY FLAME, I’M THINKING OF FIRE.Exactly. It was a real light-colored fire. It looked like it was contained in a rectangular boxbecause of its outline of the fire. But there were two rectangular boxes of white fire. Eachone of the vertical sets of lights turned into a flame job. Then two seconds later, itdisappeared totally.Everything had like a two to three second delay to it – like it had the arch of pulsing lightsthat went to the vertical scenario that was flashing. Then about three seconds later, it hadtwo sets of vertical lights and then two or three seconds later it went to the white fire.Then two to three seconds later, it was gone completely.BOTH OF THEM? EVERYTHING?Yes, everything. It was two rectangular boxes containing flames and it was like somethingBiblical. It was right there, not far out in space. This was very up close and personal. That'swhat the three of us said to each other: ‘It's like something out of the Bible.’ And one ofthe guys asked, ‘Could this be the end of the world?’HOW DID YOU DISTINGUISH FLAMES IN ALL WHITE?It just had the moving flame look to it. More Lights and F-16 JetsAfter this happened, we stood there for about ten minutes discussing, ‘What the hell couldthis have been?’Lance immediately gets in his car and leaves. It kind of scared him, I guess, or freaked himout. He leaves and we go inside Mike Odam’s house and tell his wife what we had justseen. Then she calls Lance to see if he's OK and he says, ‘You all better get back out therebecause it’s back coming from the west this time.’So, we go outside and here it comes from the west and to the south of us this time. Itlooked to be a little bit lower than it was the first time. It had the two lights in the front asit came past and you could see the other two lights in the rear. Each white light in the rearwas surrounded by a vivid red glow - a color I've never seen before (back two white lightswere embedded in unusual red glows).Around 6:25 PM, the four bright, white lights of the original mile-long by one-half-milewide rectangle pattern return with two of the lights surrounded by an unusual red glow.Coming from the west at high speed with afterburners glowing w ere two F-16 jetsthat took off after the rectangle of lights.SIZE OF THE RED LIGHTS?Close to a large silver dollar, but only around the rear white lights.DISTINCTLY LARGER THAN THE WHITE LIGHTS?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Correct.SOME PEOPLE I’VE HEARD COMPARE SOME OF THE MYSTERIOUS AERIALLIGHTS TO A WELDER'S MAGNESIUM TORCH.That’s a good scenario – like a welder’s torch.WHAT RED MIGHT I KNOW THAT WOULD BE CLOSE TO WHAT YOU SAW?The red lights had a glow to them. It appeared to have an outward protrusion from themlike a globe scenario if you took a sphere and cut it in half – that’s how they appeared. Thered was not as bright as a magnesium torch, but it was pretty bright and a really unusualcolor. It was dark by then, so it was very easy to track as it went off to the east.WHAT’S THE CLOSEST COMPARISON TO THE RED?I would call it a fire engine red, but with a different twist.BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT WAS GLOWING?The way it was glowing and if you added a smidge of orange in there. It’s just no color I’veever seen before. It’s very unusual.Then in about three or four seconds, here comes two F-16s in pursuit chasing them at thesame altitude, but the jets were not doing a very good job of catching. We watched thelights until they went out of sight about 25 miles away going east.WERE THE JETS STILL IN PURSUIT?Yes. They did have their afterburners on. Two pilot buddies of mine who live further to theeast heard a double sound barrier break. That means that someone had to authorizeexcessive speed because breaking the sound barrier is illegal. But this was at 2,000 to2,500 feet altitude. It’s very unusual to have military jets in our area flying that fast. AS A LONG TIME PILOT OF 30 YEARS, YOU WOULD BE VERY FAMILIAR WITHCIVILIAN AND MILITARY ACTIVITY IN THE GLEN ROSE AND STEPHENVILLEAREA, CORRECT?My dad started taking me to air shows when I was 2 and 3 years old. He’s an old militaryman who was a plane technician.UNTIL JANUARY 8, 2008, HAD YOU EVER SEEN F-16S TAKE OFF AFTERANYTHING IN THE GLEN ROSE AREA LIKE YOU DID THAT NIGHT?No. Absolutely not. We are not in a military training area and it’s very seldom that youever see one.HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT ALL LASTED FROM THE TIME YOU SAW THEFOUR BRIGHT LIGHTS WITH THE TWO HALF MOON OF RED GLOWS AND THEFINAL LAST SIGHT AS THE JETS CHASED AFTER?Probably 90 seconds.”More Information:I would appreciate hearing from Stephenville, Texas, region eyewitnesses of currentOctober 2008, strange lights as well as any other eyewitnesses of strange aerial light eventsin the United States and world.
