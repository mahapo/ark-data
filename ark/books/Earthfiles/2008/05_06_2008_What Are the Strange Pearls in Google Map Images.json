The aerial photographs weretaken in the winter months, and when the negatives were scanned (on a coolmorning back in our office in Phoenix) small drops of condensation hadformed on the glass of the scanner. These drops were so small, they wentun-detected by the operator. They were on the underside of the glass, and soappear to obscure the photograph.At one point, I remember the CEO, Bill Lands, joking about them because aprogram from the Discovery Channel had contacted him directly. He plannedon releasing a PR piece with a picture of the scanner, and operator in an aliencostume. He had a great sense of humor. Sorry to dispel the myth, just a bit ofwater under the scanner.” Mangonia Park, Florida, near Palm Beach. The coordinate of the “white pearl” in the photois approximately: 26' 44\" 57\" N and 80' 04\" 30\" W. Source: 2005 GoogleMaps.Mangonia Park is a town in Palm Beach County, Florida.As of 2004, the population recorded by the U.S. Census Bureau was 1,289.Mangonia Park is a part of Uptown West Palm which includes Riviera Beachand West Palm Beach, Florida.

Redstone Army Arsenal?), Ireceived an email from Robert Vernon. Back in 2005, controversy first seriously ragedabout what the “pearl” objects might be that periodically showed up on Google Mapimages. Examples are Florida (above) and Los Angeles, California (bottom of report).Robert Vernon studied the images and plotted them on latitude and longitude grids.

A.One - Two - Three - Four - Five - Six - Seven - Eight - Nine - Ten - Eleven -Tw e l v e - T h i r t e e nand Tens us again mapped the points, which appear in an almost straight line.Things the UFOs are definitely not...- Space debris or another satellite?Derek & Tens us discovered that the close-up images of Florida are taken byAerialsExpress.com at an altitude of 17,500 feet so are aerial photos and notsatellite images.- Marks added to obscure famous peoples homes?While there’s no doubt the White House photos were processed for security itis very unlikely these UFOs are intentional ‘cover-ups’ due to the neat gridlayout.- Water towers?The UFOs are just too big to be water towers (and there’s no shadow).- Anomaly produced by the stitching software?Comment from Shi Ju: Definitely they are NOT marks for picture stitching. Inmost stitching software (like for making panoramas) the algorithm comes downto finding sharp and contrasting details and aligning those spots with eachother.Things the UFOs still could be...- An alien spacecraft?It’s still possible!- A weather balloon?Further comments - Tm says:The “Grid” is centered around an airfield, common launch points for weatherballoons."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Although Klem says:All currently used radiosonde devices (weather balloons) are latex, yellowishbeige to translucent and Jello adds. The object in question here does not cast aground effect, therefore does not exist in the air.- A ‘lenticular’ cloud?Patrick was the first to float this idea and the images he posted do look similarto the UFOs, although it is unlikely clouds would form in neat grids.- Condensation on the lens?Possibly the current forerunner for most likely explanation, Stuart said...Condensation inside some sort of housing would be my guess. If the drop weredirectly on the lens it would be effectively invisible. Put it a few inches/feetaway and have the camera shooting with a very deep depth of field (as youwould with a small aperture) and it would look just like that anomaly.- Something else?Possibly one of: Peppermint, baseball, Vogon ship, crop circle, planet,thumbtack, ball bearings, smoke, pond, swamp gas, golf ball, satellite, flyingninja, space junk or contact lens as others have suggested!
