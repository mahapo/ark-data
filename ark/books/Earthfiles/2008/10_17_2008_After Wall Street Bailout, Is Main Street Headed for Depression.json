The week before, itauthorized nearly a trillion dollars to bail out Wall Street that included even saving theworld’s largest insurance company, A. I. G.But what about all the struggling Americans on Main Street who are watching their 401(K)savings and their pensions shrink as the Dow moves up and down 700 points a day? Whatabout the estimated million Americans who have lost their homes to foreclosures in thesubprime mortgage mess? Who is bailing out the Main Street taxpayers who are being usedby the United States government to bail out Wall Street? And what happens to shoppingmalls and other retailers as the government reported this week that retail sales are down1.2% in September 2008 - and are expected to keep falling?Virginia Cervasio, Exec. Dir., of the Lee County Suicide Resource Center in Florida toldAssociated Press this week: “A lot of people are telling us they are losing everything.They’re losing their homes; they’re going into foreclosure; they’ve lost their jobs.”On October 13, 2008, Associated Press reported: “As Economy Sinks, Officials FearViolent Solutions”- An out-of-work money manager in California loses a fortune and wipes outhis family in a murder-suicide.- A 90-year-old Ohio widow shoots herself in the chest as authorities arrive toevict her from the modest house she called home for 38 years.- In Massachusetts, a housewife who had hidden her family’s mountingfinancial crisis from her husband sends a note to the mortgage companywarning: ‘By the time you foreclose on my house, I’ll be dead.’ Then CarleneBalderrama shot herself to death, leaving an insurance policy and a suicidenote on a table.- In Ocala, Florida, Roland Gore shot his wife and dog in March 2008 and thenset fire to the couple’s home, which had been in foreclosure, before killinghimself.

Depression toFollow.” This week I asked him why a Trend Alert about an economic depression when theAmerican government seems to be doing everything it can to hold off financial collapse?Interview:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Gerald Celente, Editor and Publisher,The Trends Journal, Rhinebeck, New YorkGerald Celente, Editor and Publisher, The Trends Journal, Rhinebeck, New York:“Allthey are doing is throwing good money after bad. This is unprecedented. This isn’t theUnited States of America. It’s now the United Soviet States of America. They are buyingbanks, brokerages, insurance companies. We (U. S. government) now own the world’slargest insurance company! And mortgage companies. And they are doing it all withtaxpayer money. So, anyone with a little common sense, Linda, could figure it out.If the boys on Wall Street botched a deal before, what makes anyone think that the ineptpeople in Washington are going to pull it off any better? They are not. What they(government bureaucrats) have better than the scammers on Wall Street is that they(government) has unlimited funds from the U. S. Treasury by taxing the people and takingall the money they want to do their deals. So, nothing good is going to come out of this. Allthey are doing is bailing out the preferred shareholders, the foreign banks that have loanedthe money – all on the backs of the American people. This is a ‘Foetus Tax’ in the sensethat generations are going to have to pay for this. This will do nothing, nothing! to stop theeconomic depression that is coming. All it will do is bailout the ‘too big to fail’ companies.WHY DID THE DOLLAR GO UP DURING THE CHAOS?Gold went down, the dollar went up. The markets are so highly manipulated. There arereports coming out of banks shorting gold positions by the hundreds of thousands trying tokeep gold prices down. There are reports of people lining up in Europe and other countriesto buy gold and cashing out.Because when people realize that their paper is not worth the paper it’s printed on andpeople start going into gold, the whole system could collapse immediately. So, they aredoing everything they can to prop the dollar up and to push gold prices down. They arepropping the dollar up also, so that the people that are in dollars that want to get out havean opportunity, such as the Chinese and all the other foreign banks that are holding somuch of the dollar debt.WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO PROP UP THE U. S. DOLLAR?The central banks because remember they are in control of the printing press. So you havecoordination between the world central banks and the Federal Reserve and they are tradingheavily into the markets to keep it going.SO, THE CENTRAL BANKS MIGHT HAVE MORE EFFECT ON WHAT’SHAPPENING WITH THE DOW NOW THAN JUST NORMAL STOCK INVESTORS?Absolutely! The game is rigged. It’s being rigged in broad daylight and we see it right infront of us.Goldman Sachs has now taken over the White House with Henry Paulson in Treasury.When they had the A. I. G. bailout, the biggest financial insurance company in the world.They just got $85 billion and just asked for another $40 billion and we taxpayers just paidfor a half million dollars worth of perks for their A.I.G. Commissars to go to the resorts likethey used to do in the Soviet Union.Do you know who the only person sitting in on that meeting was outside of the Treasuryand the Federal Reserve? It was Blankfein from Goldman Sachs! It’s criminal activity fromtop to bottom."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Lloyd C.

Image © September 18, 2008 by AP. WHAT DOES THAT LEAVE THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WITH IN TERMS OF ANYKIND OF POWER TO CHANGE THE SYSTEM?It leaves them with anger and when they are broke and desperate, that’s when denial nolonger rules. Denial, by the way, is still pretty prevalent among a lot of people. But whenthe reality hits and they see how bad things are, you’re going to start to see tax revolts. It’sgoing to start taking place at the local level. People can’t afford these school taxes. Theycan’t afford the property taxes. I mean it’s a joke! Property taxes keep going up and theykeep re-evaluating. But when the value goes down, the bureaucrats don’t lower the taxes.What is going on here? People are not going to be able to afford it and that’s when the taxrevolt happens and that’s what we are going to see. What Could 2009 America Look Like?YOU HAVE BEEN SO ACCURATE SINCE 2007 IN CALLING EXACTLY WHAT HASUNFOLDED IN 2008. COULD YOU HELP THE GENERAL NORTH AMERICANAUDIENCE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE TRENDS JOURNAL AND INSTITUTEWOULD SEE IN DETAIL AS WE GO FORWARD NOW FROM OCTOBER 2008 TOOCTOBER 2009?First, we have to remember there are many wild cards that are thrown on the deck thatnobody can ever anticipate and that’s why nobody can really predict the future. You cansee the face of it, but you really never know what’s going to happen (in detail).Having said that, there might be wars. Geopolitical tensions are always coming to light justas happened this past summer with Georgia invading South Ossettia and the belligerencyshown by the United States on behalf of Georgia in support of their invasion. So that wasthe beginning of a new Cold War. How is that going to play out? We’re not sure. But here’swhat we know, for example, about that. We know when that happened, the Russian stockmarket collapsed and it has not recovered since. So, the Russians are very angry atAmerica for having instigated that war, as the Russians believe. So, we don’t know all thegeopolitical tensions."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"If things remain constant on the economic and political fronts, what we’re going to see inthe beginning of the New Year 2009 is a very cold winter. February and March 2009 aregoing to be very, very bleak. We’re going to see the depression really start to set in.WHAT IS YOUR DEFINITION OF A DEPRESSION?We don’t go by unemployment numbers. They reached almost 25% in the last Depressionof 1929. Now, there will be masses of working poor doing two to three jobs just to makeends meet, plus you’re going to have a lot of people unemployed as well – probably in the15% level at least. Again, the numbers are cooked all the time because what happens isthat once a person is no longer looking for work and their unemployment benefits have runout, the government no longer counts them as unemployed!Again, the United Soviet States of America! Just as the bureaucrats don’t include energyand food into the core inflation numbers. Mall and Retail Store CollapsesThis whole notion that we need a Wall Street is a fallacy because Wall Street killed MainStreet by giving all the real estate developers money and special tax breaks and grantsgiven by the cities and states to build all these huge malls and outlets that have sapped thevitality out of Main Street. That vitality is going to be re-invigorated and it’s going to startnow in the New Year 2009. You’re going to see more vitality spring up in the dead areasbecause we’re only talking now in the media about the financial collapses. Let’s starttalking about the retail collapses that are going to follow soon. You’re going to see bigname retailers buckle under and go under. You’re going to see malls become ghost malls. Desperate People, Tent Cities, Rise in CrimeIt’s going to be very bleak. Very sad. And there is going to be a lot of homeless, the likes ofwhich we have never seen before. Tent cities are already sprouting up around the countryand we’re going to see many more.We did a piece about self-storage units really taking on the true meaning of their name.People are going to start living in these things and it’s going to be better than living in a tentout in the street or risking your life in a homeless shelter.We’re going to start seeing huge areas of vacant real estate and squatters living in them aswell. It’s going to be a picture the likes of which Americans are not going to be used to. It’sgoing to come as a shock and with it, there’s going to be a lot of crime. And the crime isgoing to be a lot worse than it was before because in the last 1929 Depression, people’sminds weren’t wrecked on all these modern drugs – over-the-counter drugs, or crystal methor whatever it might be. So, you have a huge underclass of very desperate people with theirminds chemically blown beyond anybody’s comprehension. Ta x R e vo l t sWILL THIS COUNTRY EVER CHANGE BACK TO WHAT IT WAS BEFORE THISCORRUPT COLLAPSE?There will be a revolution in this country. It’s not going to come yet, but it’s going to comedown the line and we’re going to see a third party and this was the catalyst for it: thetakeover of Washington, D. C., in broad daylight by Wall Street in this bloodless coup. Andit will happen as conditions continue to worsen.We’re very confident of that because as we look through history – tracking trends is a wayof understanding where we are, how we got here and where we’re going. Throughout theentire 19th Century, and even into the early 20th Century, the major issue was the centralbanks taking over the country. That’s why you had people like Andrew Jackson. It’s been amajor issue since our founding fathers and will continue to be. This is only a temporarytake over.BUT HOW DO THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE NON-WALL STREET PEOPLE GETENOUGH LEVERAGE TO HAVE A REVOLUTION AGAINST A CORRUPT WALLSTREET AND GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF THEIR PRIORITIES?The first thing to do is organize with tax revolts. That’s going to be the big one because"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"people can’t afford to pay more school tax, property tax, any kind of tax. You’re going tostart seeing those kinds of protests start to develop.From that taxation issue because that’s what’s going on right now – this Wall Street bailoutis really taxation without representation. It worked before; it will work again. That’s whatwe see as being the glue that brings this third party movement together because now it’snot a question of becoming involved because it’s a political or ideological belief. It’s inyour pocketbook. It’s staring you in the face. People cannot make ends meet. What arethey doing? They’re going around begging to bailout disenfranchised Wall Streetexecutives?!?No, you’re going to start seeing the revolution and it’s going to take the form of tax revolts. Main Street Renaissance?You’re going to see a lot of changes that are going to make it better for the average person.The system right now is built on too-big-to-fails. There’s not enough money in the world tosave them. So, we’re going to see a Renaissance as well. Something old is dying andsomething new is being born.DO YOU MEAN THAT THERE COULD BE SOME SORT OF REJUVENATIONBECAUSE PRICES WILL BE FORCED DOWN TO SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE CANHANDLE?The prices will be forced down, but we’re going to go through a period of hyper-inflationthe likes of which we have never seen before. The government is just printing money on adaily basis. They are just manufacturing it out of thin air! So, we’re going to see hyper-inflation, the kind you used to see in Argentina and Brazil when they went throughcurrency crises. The prices are going to go lower, but in real dollar terms, it’s still going tocost a lot.Where the change is going to come about is that people are going to start re-thinking aboutwhat consumerism is about. That’s the real dynamic change. You can’t buy what you can’tafford and don’t need. That’s going to be a wake up call. You don’t borrow to build. Youonly build with profits.So, as that happens, we’re going to see more community spirit. The small towns that madethis country great in the first place are going to re-emerge. With that, family, friends,relatives – a whole different structure starts taking place rather than doing it all on yourown, you don’t need anybody, you can make it to the top mentality. So again, somethingold is dying and something new is being born. Socialism of AmericaONE OF THE THINGS THAT APPEARS TO BE BEING BORN IS LIKE A COUPD'ETAT SUDDENLY IN OCTOBER 2008, IN WHICH ESSENTIALLY THEGOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES TOOK OVER THE FINANCIALCOMMUNITY IN WHAT IS BEING DESCRIBED ON CNBC-TV AS THE ‘SOCIALISMOF THE UNITED STATES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.’I call it a communism! It’s communism when you have state-controlled monopolies runningthe largest businesses. That’s not socialism. Socialism is something for everybody out there.At least you would get health care and education and other benefits.This now is communism. Instead of the commissars from the Communist Party, they arebringing the people in from the Wall Street party. In socialism, you get to vote. Incommunism, you don’t. The majority of the American people were against the bailout.According to all the research, it was running 100 to 1 against. People were calling theirrepresentatives, but the representatives don’t represent the people. The representatives didwhat the Party wanted. So, it’s really communism and why I call it the United Soviet Statesof America.SOME BUSINESS PEOPLE ARE EXPRESSING SHOCK AT THE RAPIDITY WITHWHICH THIS HAS OCCURRED.There are honorable people out there. Not everyone is a thief or a crook. This is just thebeginning of the movement. People don’t know what to do. There has never been agalvanizing issue before (for an American revolution). This is it!"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"2009 InflationTHE PRACTICAL ISSUE OF PRINTING ALL OF THIS MONEY TO GET US OUT OFONE HOLE PUTS US IN THE INFLATION HOLE WHERE PRICES ON GOODS INTHE UNITED STATES – THEY MIGHT BE AFFORDABLE TO US, BUT IF WE TOOKOUR MONEY OUT INTO THE REST OF THE WORLD, TO EUROPE, FOREXAMPLE, THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT EVERYTHING IS GOING TO COST USTHERE IS OVERWHELMING AND PEOPLE WILL STOP TRAVELING?Oh, absolutely. It’s already happening and it’s just going to get worse. We have tounderstand that even the numbers the federal bureaucrats are talking about - $700 billionand $250 billion for the banks, it’s peanuts compared to the credit default swaps, whichnobody knows what the heck they are, including myself. They are $ 353 trillion dollars. Imean, you can’t make up a number like that! That’s only in credit default swaps, thederivatives.Then you start looking at commercial real estate. When is that going to collapse? Whenare all the over-built stores? We have been over-stored in this country for over a decade.So, you’re going to start seeing a huge commercial real estate collapse.The sub prime problem is only about $ 2 trillion at best compared to the rest, but it’s aneasy target because the bureaucrats can blame all those irresponsible little people forborrowing more than they should have.How about all those leveraged buy outs such as the Carlisle Group, Blackstone, Cerberus –they bought things like Chrysler and that Hilton chain with no money down! That’s where abig unraveling is going to come.BUT IS THIS GOVERNMENT IN THE NEW PHILOSOPHY OF SOCIALISM GOINGTO ALLOW THOSE CORPORATIONS TO COLLAPSE? OR ARE THEY(BUREAUCRATS) JUST GOING TO KEEP PROPPING EVERYTHING UP IN THISKIND OF ALICE IN WONDERLAND WORLD?They are going to try, but it’s not going to work. This is a temporary fix. They don’t haveenough money to do it.The only power they have is to print cheap money; the more cheap money they print, theworse hyper-inflation gets; the worse hyper-inflation gets, the more people become angry;the angrier people get, the more tax revolts; and that’s when we’ll see a new system. Thiscountry was built on tax revolts and it’s going to happen again. We’re only at the beginningstages of this change.You talked about an Alice In Wonderland world, if private enterprise messes it up as bad asthey did (laughs), who in their right mind would think a government that has only provenKatrina quality rescue skills can do something better? I mean, we’re losing two wars. Ourhealth care system is in shambles. Our education system no longer wins, places or showsworldwide. They still have a hole in the ground where the World Trade Centers used tostand. The levies (New Orleans) have not been fixed. And neither have the votingmachines!When we went through the 1929 Depression, Wall Street was hated! They didn’trecuperate until the mid-1950s. So, we’re going to see the same thing. There’s going to be ahuge government backlash, particularly for the Democrat and Republican parties andagainst Wall Street. Back to Main Street to Survive?As I see it at the Trends Institute, what is bad for Wall Street is good for Main Street. WallStreet only helps the too-big-to-fails. They don’t care about the rest of us. And we see itover and over again in their CEO pay or whatever greedy thing it might be.So, now you have the butcher, the baker, and even the shoemaker start to thrive again. Icould imagine a small shoe company and you could have people supporting it because theydon’t want to buy shoes made by slave labor overseas.So, we think this could become a real Golden Age of America. It could become theepicenter of the Second Renaissance. That’s what we’re pushing for.”More Information:"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"For further reports about trends research, please see other reports below in the EarthfilesArchive:• 09/17/2008 — With the September 15, 2008 “Economic 9/11,” Are We Facing DepressionLike 1929?• 12/21/2007 — Trends 2008• 12/21/2006 — Top Trends for 2007 by Gerald Celente• 02/03/2006 — Trends 2006• 12/31/2000 — Top Trends 2001• 01/02/2000 — New Trends for 21st Century• 01/03/1999 — Trends in 1999 with Gerald CelenteWebsite:Trends Research: http://www.trendsresearch.comU.
