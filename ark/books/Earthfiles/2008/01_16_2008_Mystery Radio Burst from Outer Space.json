Dan Werthimer of the UC Berkeley SETIProject, said the dilemma is compounded by the fact that the signal may never becompletely decoded. ‘We probably won't be able to decode it,’ he said. ‘We'll knowsomething's out there, but we won't know much about their civilization.’” See: KTVU-TV.Back on November 16, 1974, the Arecibo radio telescope was used to send humanity'sfirst message into outer space, which contained basic information about Earth'sfundamental chemicals of life, the formula for DNA, a crude diagram of our solar system,simple pictures of male and female human beings and the diameter of the Arecibo dish.There is a SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) Institute in Mountain View,California. Its website states its goal as:“exploratory science that seeks evidence of life in the universe by looking forsome signature of its technology. Our current understanding of life’s origin onEarth suggests that given a suitable environment and sufficient time, life willdevelop on other planets. Whether evolution will give rise to intelligent,technological civilizations is open to speculation. However, such a civilizationcould be detected across interstellar distances, and may actually offer our bestopportunity for discovering extraterrestrial life in the near future.\"The SETI Institute's Senior Astronomer is Seth Shostak, Ph.D., author of CosmicCompany: The Search for Life in the Universe © 2003.

He has been in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence since 1979, and heruns the SERENDIP, Optical SETI, and CASPER projects also associated with theSETI@home Project. It was Dr. Werthimer's statement that triggered the KTVU headlineimplying that maybe an extraterrestrial signal had been detected. But the result was somekind of professional panic that the media was reporting an “E. T.” signal, while thescientists didn't really know what the signal was.By Wednesday afternoon, January 16, 2008, the KTVU.com web news report had beenremoved and left blank for hours. Then by early evening, a correction was posted sayingthe mystery signal had been recorded by an Australian radio telescope (confirmed now tobe the Parkes Radio Telescope) and that the complex signal is still being studied.Finally, by the evening of January 16, 2008, Seth Shostak, Ph.D., weighed in with thisformal statement at the SETI Institute website in Mountain View:Seth Shostak, Ph.D., SETI InstituteSenior Astronomer, Mountain View, California.January 16, 2008by Seth Shostak, SETI Institute Senior AstronomerA news story from television station KTVU, Oakland (California) thatappeared on the internet on January 15 has led some to believe that a credibleradio signal from space may have been recently detected - a signal that mightbe ascribable to extraterrestrial intelligence.This story, while obviously exciting, is somewhat misleading, and derives fromsome miscommunication between the reporter and Dan Werthimer, who runsthe University of California, Berkeley SETI program.Dan was describing Berkeley's new instrumentation for detecting very shortradio pulses - a signal type that might be used by extraterrestrials to “ping”our world to get attention. He also mentioned the detection of such a pulse, afew months ago (not “last week”, as reported in the internet story). That pulsewas actually recorded by the Parkes Radio Telescope, in New South Wales,Australia several years ago during a search for pulsars, but only recentlylooked at by researchers at West Virginia University as they sifted throughthese old data. Their results were published on September 27 of last year. [Howe: see NRAO report below.]The sudden burst of radio energy lasted only 0.005 seconds, and had spectralcharacteristics that suggested that it was from a distant galaxy, probablybillions of light-years from us. Since the burst was seen only once, it is as yetunclear what produced it, although many scientists suspect that it was causedby the collision of two highly dense neutron stars. Radio astronomers areplanning a search for more such radio bursters, as they may be a new (and"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"clearly interesting) type of natural phenomenon.This signal doesn't seem to have anything to do with SETI searches (andwasn't found as part of any such search), although until more “bursters” arefound, its true nature will remain mysterious. It is certainly not claimed to be aSETI detection. For such a claim to be made, a signal would have to not onlyhave the characteristics of a deliberate transmission, but would also need to beobserved more than once - in order to verify its position on the sky, and torule out the kind of brutal cosmic event that is probably responsible for theburst reported in September.Seth Shostak, Ph.D., referenced the September 27, 2007, science report by the NationalRadio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) that first published about the anomalous radiosignal. That's the outer space radio burst mystery that KTVU-TV.com picked up in itsJanuary 15, 2008, controversial web news report.Powerful Radio Burst Indicates New Astronomical PhenomenonSource, September 27, 2007: National Radio Astronomy Observatory(NRAO)Visible-light (negative greyscale) and radio (contours) imageof Small Magellanic Cloud and area where burst originated.CREDIT: Lorimer et al., NRAO/AUI/NSF.Astronomers studying archival data from an Australian radio telescope havediscovered a powerful, short-lived burst of radio waves that they say indicatesan entirely new type of astronomical phenomenon.“This burst appears to have originated from the distant Universe and mayhave been produced by an exotic event such as the collision of two neutronstars or the death throes of an evaporating black hole,” said Duncan Lorimer,Assistant Professor of Physics at West Virginia University (WVU) and theNational Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO). The research team led byLorimer consists of Matthew Bailes of Swinburne University in Australia,Maura McLaughlin of WVU and NRAO, David Narkevic of WVU, andFronefield Crawford of Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster,Pennsylvania. The astronomers announced their findings in the September 27issue of the online journal Science Express.The startling discovery came as WVU undergraduate student David Narkevicre-analyzed data from observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud made bythe 210-foot Parkes radio telescope in Australia. The data came from a surveyof the Magellanic Clouds that included 480 hours of observations.“This survey had sought to discover new pulsars, and the data already hadbeen searched for the type of pulsating signals they produce,” Lorimer said.“We re-examined the data, looking for bursts that, unlike the usual ones frompulsars, are not periodic,” he added.The survey had covered the Magellanic Clouds, a pair of small galaxies in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"orbit around our own Milky Way Galaxy. Some 200,000 light-years fromEarth, the Magellanic Clouds are prominent features in the Southern sky.Ironically, the new discovery is not part of these galaxies, but rather is muchmore distant.“It was a bit of luck that the survey included some observations of the skysurrounding the clouds,” Narkevic said. It was from those “flanking”observations that the mysterious radio burst appeared in the data.The burst of radio waves was strong by astronomical standards, but lasted lessthan five milliseconds. The signal was spread out, with higher frequenciesarriving at the telescope before the lower frequencies. This effect, calleddispersion, is caused by the signal passing through ionized gas in interstellarand intergalactic space. The amount of this dispersion, the astronomers said,indicates that the signal likely originated about three billion light-years fromEarth.No previously-detected cosmic radio burst has the same set of characteristics.“This burst represents an entirely new astronomical phenomenon,” Bailessaid. The astronomers estimate on the basis of their results that hundreds ofsimilar events should occur over the sky each day. “Few radio surveys havethe necessary sensitivity to such short-duration bursts, which makes themnotoriously difficult to detect with current instruments,” added Crawford. Thenext generation of radio telescopes currently under development should beable to detect many of these bursts across the sky.Although the nature of the mysterious new object is unclear, the astronomershave some ideas of what may cause such a burst. One idea is that it may bepart of the energy released when a pair of superdense neutron stars collideand merge. Such an event is thought by some scientists to be the cause of onetype of gamma-ray burst, but the only radio emission seen so far from thesehas been from the long-lived “afterglow” that follows the original burst.Another, more exotic, candidate is a burst of energy from an evaporatingblack hole. Black holes, concentrations of mass so dense that not even lightcan escape their powerful gravity, can lose mass and energy through a processproposed by famed British physicist Stephen Hawking. The newly-discoveredradio burst, the researchers said, might be the “last gasp” of a black hole as itfinally evaporates completely.“We're actively looking for more of these powerful, short bursts, in otherarchival pulsar surveys, and hope to resolve the mystery of their origin,” saidMcLaughlin. “In addition, if we can associate these events with galaxies ofknown distance, the radio dispersion we measure can be used as a powerfulnew way to determine the amount of material in intergalactic space,” sheadded.The Parkes radio telescope is part of the Australia Telescope, which is fundedby the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a National Facility. TheNational Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the National ScienceFoundation, operated under cooperative agreement by AssociatedUniversities, Inc.Parks Australia Radio Telescope National Facility,a division of CSIRO, north of Parkes, New South Wales, Australia.More Information:For further reports about unusual cosmic mysteries, please see Earthfiles Archive:• 10/18/2007 — A Quantum Math Description of Parallel Universes• 11/27/2006 — Namibia Telescopes Find First \"Gamma Clock\" in Milky Way Galaxy• 04/22/2006 — Cassiopeia A Is Not Dying Peacefully.
