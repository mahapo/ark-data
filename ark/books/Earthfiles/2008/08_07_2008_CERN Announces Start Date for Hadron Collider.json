Thesemicroscopic-black-holes would decay into ordinary particles in a tiny fraction of a second andwould be very difficult to observe in our atmosphere. The ATLAS Experiment offers the excitingpossibility to study them in the lab (if they exist). The simulated collision event shown is viewedalong the beampipe. The event is one in which a microscopic-black-hole was producedin the collision of two protons (not shown). The microscopic-black-hole decayedimmediately into many particles. The colors of the tracks show different types ofparticles emerging from the collision (at the center). Computer graphic and actualLarge Hadron Collider image below courtesy CERN LHC. August 7, 2008 Geneva, Switzerland - CERN announced today that the first attempt tocirculate a beam in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will be September 10, 2008. TVcoverage of the start-up will be made available through a Eurovision webcast.CERN Press Release: “The LHC is the world’s most powerful particle accelerator,producing beams seven times more energetic than any previous machine, and around 30"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"times more intense when it reaches design performance, probably by 2010. Housed in a17-mile-long (27 kilometers) tunnel, it relies on technologies that would not have beenpossible 30 years ago. The LHC is, in a sense, its own prototype.This computer-generated image shows the location of the 17-mile-long (27 km)Large Hadron Collider (LHC) tunnel (in blue) on the Swiss-France border. The four mainexperiments (ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb) are located in underground cavernsconnected to the surface by 50 meter to 150 meter pits. Part of the pre-accelerationchain is shown in grey.

Commissioning is a longprocess that starts with the cooling down of each of the machine’s eight sectors. This isfollowed by the electrical testing of the 1600 superconducting magnets and their individualpowering to nominal operating current. These steps are followed by the powering togetherof all the circuits of each sector, and then of the eight independent sectors in unison inorder to operate as a single machine.“By the end of July 2008, this work was approaching completion, with all eight sectors attheir operating temperature of 1.9 degrees above absolute zero, - 459 degrees Fahrenheit(-271°C). The next phase in the process is synchronization of the LHC with the SuperProton Synchrotron (SPS) accelerator, which forms the last link in the LHC’s injectorchain. Timing between the two machines has to be accurate to within a fraction of ananosecond. A first synchronization test is scheduled for the weekend of August 9, 2008,for the clockwise-circulating LHC beam, with the second to follow over the comingweeks. Tests will continue into September to ensure that the entire machine is ready toaccelerate and collide beams at an energy of 5 TeV per beam, the target energy for 2008.If all goes well, the LHC will see its first circulating beam on September 10, 2008, at theinjection energy of 450 GeV (0.45 TeV).“Once stable circulating beams have been established, they will be brought into collision,and the final step will be to commission the LHC’s acceleration system to boost the energyto 5 TeV, taking particle physics research to a new frontier.‘We’re finishing a marathon with a sprint,’ said LHC project leader Lyn Evans. ‘It’s been along haul, and we’re all eager to get the LHC research program underway.’”Website:CERN Large Hadron Collider: http://lhc-first-beam.web.cern.ch/lhc-first-beam/Welcome.html Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2010 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Refund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2010, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
