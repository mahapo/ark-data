U.) from the sun beyond Pluto.Illustration courtesy Kobe University, Japan.March 28, 2008 Tucson, Arizona - The upcoming April 2008 printed issue of TheAstronomical Journal will have this intriguing paper: “An Outer Planet Beyond Pluto andthe Origin of the Trans-Neptunian Belt Architecture.” The authors are Patryk Lykawkaand Tadashi Mukai from the Graduate School of Science, Earth and Planetary Sciences,Kobe University, Japan. After studying perturbations and highly angled inclinations to theplane of the inner solar system among objects in a region 100 Astronomical Units (A. U.)from our sun far beyond Pluto, the Japanese scientists propose the discovery of a nearlyEarth-size planet out there that takes 1,000 years to orbit the sun. Prof. Tadashi Mukaisays, “We have been able to identify more than 1,100 objects beyond Neptune since1992, and a huge number of objects are showing large orbital eccentricities and ellipticalorbits.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Recently I asked Mark Sykes, Ph.D., Director of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson,Arizona, that collaborates with the University of Arizona Astronomy Department, NASAand other institutions around the world: How can something be nearly the size of the Earthand not have been detected before now?Interview:Mark V. Sykes, Ph.D., Director, Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, Arizona: “Well,space is a pretty big place. A lot of our surveys to date have clustered primarily aroundthat average plane. But when you start deviating from that plane, the volume of sky youhave to search is very large. If you are just looking for one object within that large volume,it can take a very long time.HOW WOULD YOU GO ABOUT LOOKING FOR THIS EARTH-SIZED OBJECT OUT100 ASTRONOMICAL UNITS?Fortunately, in modern times, our detector technology has gotten more sophisticated. Ourability to scan large areas of the sky has improved substantially. There are some facilitiesbeing built, such as the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System(Pan-STARRS) over in Hawaii and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is on thedrawing board to map out the entire sky on weekly time scales using very large telescopes.With that type of technology – even though this object (Planet X) might be at 100 A. U., ifit’s a bright object, if its surface reflects light sufficiently, then it might be easily be pickedup and perhaps other objects like it by these new surveys coming on line even next year(2009) and in the next several years.ARE THE SURVEYS IN INFRARED?No, they are visible. They are operating in wavelengths that we detect with our eye.WOULD YOU EXPECT A BODY THIS SIZE TO BE GIVING OFF HEAT THATCOULD BE PICKED UP BY INFRARED?Sure, but the wavelength would be very long. The colder you get, the longer thewavelength of the thermal radiation it is emitting. Something out at 100 A. U., and if it’sbright in the visible, that means it’s even colder in the infrared. So, it’s giving off even lessenergy at a longer wavelength. So, you’d have to look for wavelengths in thesub-millimeter in hundreds of microns in order to detect this object (Planet X). And wedon’t have a lot of big surveys planned to look at objects at those wavelengths.HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WILL TAKE WITH ALL THE VARIOUS SURVEYSTO FIND THIS PLANET X?Once the surveys are up and operational, it might happen quickly.WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT EVERYTHING WILL REALISTICALLY BEOPERATING?PanSTARRS is going to be taking data on its first telescope – it’s going to be an array oftelescopes ultimately – within about a year (2009). And so, we’ll see what it finds. As theyadd more telescopes to that array, then they’ll be able to go fainter. LSST hasn’t been builtyet. It’s probably ten years away.IF THERE IS A NEAR EARTH-SIZE BODY ORBITING AT AN INCLINE TO THEFLAT PLANE OF THE INNER SOLAR SYSTEM BY 20 TO 40 DEGREES, WHATWOULD BE THE LENGTH OF TIME IT WOULD TAKE FOR THAT PLANET TO GOAROUND THE SUN?It would take about 1,000 years to orbit the sun.THROUGHOUT HISTORY, THERE HAVE BEEN SUMERIAN CUNEIFORMS ANDLATER BOOKS THAT TALK ABOUT A WANDERING STAR, MAYBE CALLEDNEBIRU. IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THIS PLANET X THAT COULD FIT INTOA MESOPOTAMIAN CONCEPT ABOUT OUR SOLAR SYSTEM?Not at all. The ancient peoples were looking at the sky with their eyes.THIS LARGE OBJECT HAS BEEN OUT THERE AT 100 A. U. SINCE THEBEGINNING OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM?Probably since some time in the early solar system. It probably formed much closer to the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"sun and then was scattered out there. In the early solar system, it was a pretty dynamicplace. We know that the Earth was impacted by a Mars-sized object early in the solarsystem and created the Earth’s moon. So, it was not a quiescent time back then and itwould not be a surprise to find a number of Mars-sized, or bigger, out in the distant regionsof our solar system today.IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY THAT AN OBJECT LIKE THIS ONE COULD HAVEBEEN THE OBJECT THAT CAME THROUGH OUR SOLAR SYSTEM AND CAUSEDTHE BIG IMPACTS ON MARS AND EARTH AND THAT’S HOW IT ENDED OUT AT100 A.U.?Yes, it could be one of the scattered objects from the solar system that went through aseries of interactions with other objects to end up in the orbit it is today.HOW WILL WE HANDLE NAMING THIS IF IT IS ABOUT THE SIZE OF THEEARTH, WHICH IS PLANETARY. WILL THERE BE A WHOLE NEW REALM OFPLANETS BEYOND THE KUIPER BELT?Our thinking about planets has been undergoing some evolution and there is disagreementright now about how we should classify these objects. The IAU wanted to restrict planetsto objects orbiting the sun that go out to include Neptune and that’s about it. From ageophysical perspective, planets could be round objects that orbit a star that are massiveenough to crush themselves into what is called a hydrostatic equilibrium shape = round. Inthat case, we would have twelve planets right now and this new object would be thethirteenth if it were discovered.HERE IS HIS LIST OF PLANETS AT: 34:55Here, I’ll count off the thirteen planets as I see them. You start off with1) Mercury2) Venus3) Earth4) Mars5) Ceres – which is between Mars and Jupiter - very round and smooth surface, as seen inrecent Hubble Telescope image.Hubble Telescope image of Ceres, largest bodyof asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.Image provided by Mark Sykes.6) Jupiter7) Saturn8) Uranus9) Neptune10) Pluto and11) Charon as a double planet because Charon is large enough to be round and massiveenough that Pluto and Charon orbit a point in between the two of them. Imagine adumbbell spinning in space. It’s that point that is orbiting the sun and those two objectsare orbiting each other. So, it is truly a double planet, which is very neat.Pluto and its \"moon\" Charon are consideredby Prof. Sykes to be a double planet orbiting around a pointin between the two round bodies. Nix and Hydra are two other Plutonian moons.12) Eris"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Illustration of Eris, a dwarf planet that is the 9th largest body to orbit the sun (upper left) ,was first spotted in 2003 by a Palomar Observatory-based tteam led by Mike Brown, Ph.D. Eris isapproximately 2500 miles in diamet5er, 27% more massive than Pluto, and is about 98 AstronomicalUnits from the sun - in the region of the Kobe University hypothesized Planet X at 100 A. U.13) And then this new planet.PLANET X!Planet X!Illustration of hypothetical Planet X in foregroundat 100 A. U. , taking 1,000 years to orbit our sun (upper right).THAT WOULD MAKE A SOLAR SYSTEM OF 13 ROUND BODIES OF WHICH THISLATEST IS 100 ASTRONOMICAL UNITS FROM THE SUN.Yes, and there might be many more out there.WOULD YOU BE SURPRISED IF THERE WERE A LOT MORE EARTH-SIZEDOBJECTS OUT BEYOND THE KUIPER BELT?No, I would not. Like I said before, the early solar system was a pretty dynamic place. I’mnot sure how many Earth-sized objects could have been formed in the interior of the solarsystem and then scattered out. Certainly there could be more Mars-sized objects out there.I would not find that surprising at all.MOST OF US GREW UP BEING TAUGHT THERE WERE 9 PLANETS IN THESOLAR SYSTEM THAT INCLUDED PLUTO AS THE LAST ONE OUT THERE. ANDTHEN WE WERE TOLD THAT PLUTO WAS REDUCED TO A DWARF PLANETAND THAT’S HOW THE I.A.U. COMES UP WITH 8 PLANETS, CORRECT?That’s correct. But from my perspective, maybe our grand kids will have 20 planets. Andthe New York Times wrote an editorial saying that if there get to be too many planets, thiswill be a problem for kids. How are they going to memorize them? My gosh, then weshould have only 10 cities in the world. We should have only 9 rivers in the world. Howmany mountains should we have? Kids can deal with things!WITH THE PANSTARR MISSION IN 2009, WE MIGHT FINALLY BE ABLE TOCONFIRM PLANET X OUT THERE AND IT COULD BECOME THE 13TH PLANETIN 2009.Yes, I think it becomes very difficult for the I. A. U. once an object like that is discoveredbecause people will be scratching their heads – people are used to categorizing things on"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the basis of like characteristics. If you have something bigger than Mars out there andMars is a planet, then why would you say that it (Planet X) is something different?So, I think that ultimately there will be a convergence of opinion. The nice thing about ourperspective is that the I. A. U. planets – the dynamical giants, if you will – the gravitationalgiants – they are a subset of geophysical planets. In our case, if you put an adjective infront of the noun, it means you are dealing with a subset, whereas when the I. A. U. putsan adjective like ‘dwarf’ in front of the noun, it’s not a subset. It’s something completelydifferent. It’s like, ‘I’m sorry, but a Chihuahua dog is not a dog because it’s too small.’”More Information:For further reports about Planet X and other solar system discoveries, please see reportsbelow in the Earthfiles Archive:• 02/13/2008 — Saturn's Titan Moon Has Greater Oil Reserves Than Earth• 01/12/2008 — Our Milky Way Galaxy On Collision Course with Huge Gas Cloud - 40Million Years from Now• 11/01/2007 — Gas Eruptions from Comet Holmes?• 10/11/2007 — Carancas, Peru Meteorite Could Be 10 Tons• 09/26/2007 — Meteorite Fell in Carancas, Peru - Not Satellite• 08/10/2007 — Levitation Possible by Reversing Casimir Force• 08/03/2007 — The Milky Way Is Devouring the Alien Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy• 06/20/2007 — Update: What Is the Moving Light in Saturn's Rings?
