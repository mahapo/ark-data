You try to do things as safely aspossible, and we think the LHC is 100% safe. But there is always thatlittle nervousness about what is going to happen when you turn all this on?”- Joseph Lykken, Ph.D., Fermi Lab Particle Physicist In some theories, microscopic black holes may be produced in particle collisionsthat occur when very-high-energy cosmic rays hit particles in our atmosphere. Thesemicroscopic-black-holes would decay into ordinary particles in a tiny fraction of a second andwould be very difficult to observe in our atmosphere. The ATLAS Experiment offers the excitingpossibility to study them in the lab (if they exist). The simulated collision event shown is viewedalong the beampipe. The event is one in which a microscopic-black-hole was producedin the collision of two protons (not shown). The microscopic-black-hole decayedimmediately into many particles. The colors of the tracks show different types ofparticles emerging from the collision (at the center).

The EuropeanOrganization for Nuclear Research, known in France as CERN, has built the world'sbiggest particle physics laboratory called the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC. The bestknown hadron particles are protons and neutrons, which are bound by the strong force, asatoms are bound by the electromagnetic force. CERN is made up of sixty Europeanmember states representing 500 universities and at least ten thousand physicists areparticipating around the planet.[ Editor's Note: In particle physics, a hadron is a bound state of quarks.Hadrons are held together by the strong force, similar to how atoms are heldtogether by the electromagnetic force. The best known hadrons are protonsand neutrons.]On September 10, 2008, the Large Hadron Collider fired its first single beam of protonsaround the 17-mile-long underground circular tunnel – but not two beams of protonscolliding head-to-head near the speed of light.There are at least four reasons for the proton collision delay. First, LHC wanted to try outthe hardware and magnets. Even that gentle test caused an electric transformer to breakdown. Then, electrical connections between two magnets failed, causing the magnets tomelt, which shut down the superconducting at near absolute zero temperature needed forLHC operations. The LHC demands so much power that France has dedicated one of itsnuclear power stations to it. But because it needs so much power, transformers are goingto periodically break down.Fourth, shortly after the first test firing, hackers broke into the computers connected to theCompact Muon Solenoid Detector (CMSD) experiment and left this message: “We'repulling your pants down because we don't want to see you running around naked lookingto hide yourselves when the panic comes.”CERN now confirms that damage to the Large Hardon Collider is so serious that it won'toperate again before some time in Spring 2009.The lead scientist on that hacked Compact Muon experiment is Joseph Lykken, whoreceived his Ph.D. in physics from MIT in 1982. Dr. Lykken has been a particle physicistfor nineteen years at the Fermi Laboratory in Chicago, Illinois. Dr. Lykken told me thatthe hackers themselves in an ironic good deed closed the “hacked doorway” throughwhich they entered. Further, none of the computers controlling the actual LHC protonbeam collisions have any connections to the outside world for precisely the reason toprevent hackers from interfering with such a powerful laboratory.Previous report and interview on September 9, 2008 Batavia, Illinois - Tomorrowmorning at 9:30 AM local Swiss time on the border between Switzerland and France, notfar from Geneva, and three hundred feet underground, humans for the first time are goingto try to begin reproducing subatomic energies close to the universe's Big Bang. TheEuropean Organization for Nuclear Research, also known in French as CERN, hasproduced the world's biggest particle physics laboratory known as the Large HadronCollider (LHC). CERN is made up of sixty European member states representing 500universities. At least 10,000 physicists will be up in all time zones staring at computermonitors to see the first firing of the LHC.One American scientist who is heading one of the LHC experiments is Joseph Lykken,Physics Ph.D. from MIT in 1982. Dr. Lykken has been a particle physicist for nineteenyears at the Fermi Laboratory in Chicago, Illinois, and is also a team leader on one of theLHC's experiments known as the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “The Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS)experiment is one of two large general-purpose particle physics detectorsbeing built on the proton-proton Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN inSwitzerland and France. The muon (from the letter mu (μ)--used to representit) is an elementary particle with negative electric charge. A muon can bethought of as a much heavier version of the electron. Due to their greatermass, muons do not emit as much bremsstrahlung radiation; consequently,they are highly penetrating, much more so than electrons.“Approximately 2600 people from 180 scientific institutes form the CMScollaboration building and operating the detector. CMS is designed as ageneral-purpose detector, capable of studying many aspects of protoncollisions at 14 TeV, the center-of-mass energy of the LHC particleaccelerator. It contains subsystems which are designed to measure the energyand momentum of photons, electrons, muons, and other products of thecollisions. Outside the magnet are the large muon detectors, which are inside"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the return yoke of the magnet.”]I asked asked Dr. Lykken about a law suit filed by physicists a few months back to stop LHC because of the fear that protons colliding inside the 17-mile long, circular acceleratorat near the speed of light will produce black holes that could swallow up Earth. The lawsuit stated there is a slight chance that Earth and humans could disappear into one or moreblack holes created by the LHC.However, Dr. Lykken argues there is no danger and explained why he thinks the LargeHadron Collider is not only safe, but could finally bring Earth physicists someunderstanding about gravity, supersymmetry, dark matter and dark energy.

We use a bottle of hydrogen gas and all you have to do with hydrogen gasis strip off the electrons from the atoms and you’ve got a beam of protons. So, protons areeasy to get and they are also cheaper to accelerate than other kinds of particles. Whatwe’re trying to do is get to the highest possible energies in the collisions. So, protons – ifyou like, give us the most bang for the buck in terms of getting highest energy collisions.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “In physics, the proton is a subatomic particlewith an electric charge of one positive fundament unit. Protons are observedto be stable and their theoretical minimum half-life of 1 x 10^36 years years. Grand unified theories generally predict that proton decay should take place,although experiments so far have only resulted in a lower limit of 1035 yearsfor the proton's lifetime. In other words, proton decay has never beenwitnessed.However, protons are known to transform into neutrons through the processof electron capture. This process does not occur spontaneously, but only whenenergy is supplied. The process is reversible: neutrons can convert back toprotons through beta decay, a common form of radioactive decay. In fact, afree neutron decays this way with a mean lifetime of about fifteen minutes.”]IS IT TRUE THAT THE OPPOSING BEAMS OF PROTONS WILL COLLIDE WITHEACH OTHER AT, OR NEAR, THE SPEED OF LIGHT?That is true. They are going so close to the speed of light that it is very difficult to tell thedifference between how fast they are going and the speed of light. The speed of light isabout 186,000 miles per second. These protons are going only a few miles per hour slowerthan that.THERE IS THE CONTROVERSY OF SOME PHYSICISTS WHO FILED A LAW SUITAGAINST THE LARGE HADRON COLLIDER FIRING UP ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2008,BECAUSE THEIR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT COLLIDING PROTONS NEAR THESPEED OF LIGHT COULD PRODUCE BLACK HOLES THAT COULD SWALLOWTHE EARTH?Yes, in fact, I had something to do with this myself because it was theories about extradimensions of space, which is a very hypothetical idea, but it’s an idea that leads to thenotion that you can produce black holes in the laboratory than just out there in theuniverse. We think this is a possibility that you can produce black holes. Where thedisagreement lies is whether or not these black holes would be dangerous or not. Can LHC Destroy Earth with Black Holes?CAN YOU ANSWER THE QUESTION: ON SEPTEMBER 10, WHEN THOSEPROTONS BANG INTO EACH OTHER AT NEARLY THE SPEED OF LIGHT, WHATDO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN IN TERMS OF BLACK HOLE GENERATION?If I had to bet my own money, I would say it’s quite a long shot that we can produce blackholes at all. The reason I say that is if we were about to produce black holes at the LHC, Ithink we would already have seen something strange here at Fermi Lab in the high energyaccelerator that we have here. So, I think it’s unlikely that we’ll make the black holes.If we do make black holes, I would say with all the certainty I have as a scientist that theywill almost immediately evaporate into ordinary particles. That will be very spectacularand interesting for us here as physicists, but it won’t be any danger to the public.WHY DO YOU FEEL SO CONFIDENT WHILE OTHER PHYSICISTS WENT SO FARAS TO FILE A LAWSUIT?The reason I feel so confident is that we are not the only people who build particleaccelerators. Nature builds particle accelerators out in our galaxy. In fact, we have seenevidence for particle accelerators in our galaxy and other galaxies that are up to 10 milliontimes as powerful as the LHC. Those very high energy particles produced by naturalaccelerators are hitting the Earth all the time. It’s what we call cosmic rays.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - “Cosmic rays are energetic particles originatingfrom space that impinge on Earth's atmosphere. Almost 90% of all theincoming cosmic ray particles are protons, about 9% are helium nuclei (alpha"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"particles) and about 1% are electrons (beta minus particles). The term ‘ray’ isa misnomer, as cosmic particles arrive individually, not in the form of a ray orbeam of particles. The origins of these particles range from energeticprocesses on the Sun all the way to as yet unknown events in the farthestreaches of the visible universe. Cosmic rays can have energies of over 1020eV, far higher than the 1012 to 1013 eV that man-made particle acceleratorscan produce.” ]And we know, because we have detected cosmic rays, that some of the particles hittingEarth as cosmic rays have much higher energies than anything we are going to do at theLHC. And cosmic rays have apparently not produced black holes that swallow the Earth,otherwise we would not be here! This natural process of cosmic rays has been going on forbillions of years. Why Can Colliding Protons Produce Back Holes?COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHY THE COLLISION OF PROTONS AT NEAR THESPEED OF LIGHT COULD PRODUCE BLACK HOLES?A black hole is an example of something where gravity is becoming very strong. Now, youmight think that gravity is very strong any way because the Earth seems to pull on us witha lot of strength. But that’s because the Earth is a very large object. Even though gravity isa very weak force, we are pulled down to the surface of the Earth. But compared to theother forces of Nature like electricity and magnetism, gravity is a very, very weak forcenormally.What we’re interested in is that in these very high energy collisions, we think those rulesmight change and that gravity might become a force as strong as the other forces. In thatcase, the natural thing for particles to do is to collapse into black holes.IF THAT DOES HAPPEN AT LHC, DOES THAT MEAN YOU MIGHT FOR THE FIRSTTIME ON EARTH YOU WOULD FINALLY HAVE PHYSICAL PARTICLESASSOCIATED WITH GRAVITY IN YOUR HANDS, SO TO SPEAK?Exactly. In particle physics, we’ve learned a lot about the other forces of Nature, but wehaven’t been able to learn very much about gravity because it is such a weak force. If wecould actually get our hands on something like a microscopic black hole, it would be ahuge advance in our knowledge of gravity. Gravity, as Einstein told us, is related to thefabric of space and time. So, we would learn about space, time, gravity and probably aboutthe origins of the universe. Fermi Lab Is Having A PajamaParty to Watch LHCWHAT WILL YOU BE DOING AT 9:30 AM CERN TIME, 3:30 AM EAST COASTTIME, ON WEDNESDAY, SEPTEMBER 10, 2008?Here at Fermi Lab, we’re having a little party. It’s going to be very early in the morning forus, so we’re calling it a pajama party. But we’re all going to get together and we have aremote control room for the CMS experiment – the LHC experiment that I’m involvedwith. We’re actually going to see live what’s going on at Cern.SO, YOU’RE GOING TO HAVE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLES AND WHAT WOULD WESEE IF WE WERE WATCHING?Usually what happens when you start up a beam like this, they can show you a profile ofthe beam through what they call ‘beam monitors.’ LHC needs instruments to tell themwhere the beam is and what it is doing, so we should be able to see some of the videotaken from those beam monitors.WILL THERE BE SOMETHING LIKE FLASHES OF LIGHT?If the CMS detector works as we hope it does, we should be able to detect flashes of lightand what we call ‘tracks of particles’ coming from any collisions that are produced.AND IF THERE IS A BLACK HOLE THAT SWALLOWS THE EARTH, YOU ALLWOULD BE CELEBRATING WITH CHAMPAGNE AND WATCHING LIGHT RIGHTUP UNTIL...?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Right up until we are not anymore! (laughs)WE WON’T EXACTLY KNOW UNTIL IT’S ALL FIRED UP AND RUNNING.I think it’s always the case for human civilization that when you push into the unknown,you’re always a little bit nervous about what are you going to find and what’s going tohappen. I think that’s only natural. Of course, you try to do things as safely as possible,and we think the LHC is 100% safe. But there is always that little nervousness about whatis going to happen when you turn all this on? And we’ll find out. We have 3,000 physicistsjust in our CMS experiment, so I think taken altogether, there will be 10,000 physicists(out of 20,000 estimated on Earth) and other computer-related technical people allstanding up with their champagne glasses watching this big event.WHAT WILL YOU SEE ON YOUR COMPUTER SCREENS?We’ll be using the actual computer monitors that show us the detectors, so it will be as ifwe are looking down into the tunnel and we will also have the readouts from all theelectronics from inside the detector. From a physicist point of view, that is what is mostinteresting because that’s showing us what is happening at the microscopic level inwhatever the particle collisions are producing.SO, SIMULTANEOUSLY ALL THE PHYSICISTS ON EARTH THAT ARE INVOLVEDWITH THE LHC WILL BE WATCHING TOGETHER NO MATTER THE TIME ZONE.WHAT WILL BE THE FIRST HARD DATA THAT ALL OF YOU WILL BE WORKINGON?The first evidence we will be looking for is what collisions have occurred. We don’t expectthe first collisions we see to be anything spectacular. But we never know. We’ve neverdone collisions at these energies before, so it will be interesting to look at the very firstcollision and try to figure out what is going on.SINCE IT’S HAPPENING AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT, DOES THAT MEAN IT’STURNED ON AND A SECOND LATER, YOU HAVE ALL OF THE NEW DATA?We have to sift through the data electronically, not by humans, because there is too muchdata. But, we won’t have all the data we want immediately. In order to do what we want ina search for the Higgs boson and supersymmetry, we will have to run the LHC forprobably ten or fifteen years to get all of the data that we need.WHEN IT’S FIRED UP, WILL PROTONS KEEP COLLIDING AND NOT STOP FORHOURS, DAYS AFTER?Yes, these experiments are designed to run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, for perhaps sixor nine months out of the year. That’s one of the difficulties in designing the detectors andaccelerators is to design them to be able to run near the speed of light for months at a time,producing billions and billions of collisions. SO AFTER IT’S TURNED ON, IF THE LHC PRODUCED A HIGGS BOSON, YOU ALLWOULD PROBABLY FAINT?Yes! We would be surprised, but stranger things have happened. Some experimenters havebeen very lucky and made discoveries almost immediately when they started up. We don’texpect that to happen for LHC, but it has happened in the past for other experiments.WHAT KIND OF GLITCH OR DISCOVERY WOULD IT TAKE TO STOP IT ALL?There are many things that can go wrong here. We’re talking about magnets that arecooled down to only 2 degrees above absolute zero by the world’s largest set ofrefrigerators. Something could go wrong there. We’re using enormous amounts ofelectricity going through all kinds of high voltage circuits. Something can go wrong there.As electronic detectors, we are using state-of-the-art incredibly complicated solid statematerials. These things have not been tested altogether yet, so we don’t know what isgoing to happen there. There are thousands of things that can go wrong and we’re hopingnot too many of them go wrong at the same time.”Click here to see LHC Musical Rap Video.
