In addition to the large rectangular \"frames of white fire\" described by pilotand businessman Steve Allen (See 020508Earthfiles), perhaps the most extraordinary aerialevent was videotaped on January 19, 2008, between 10:10 p.m. and 10:20 p.m. CST byDavid Caron near the Stephenville municipal airport. The 12-minute videotape shows apale-colored, disc-shaped aerial object that suddenly seems to transform into “symbols” thatpulse every 15 frames of the videotape, or one every half-second. At Earthfiles, I haveshared a clip of the videotape and still frames of the symbols (See 021408 Earthfiles).1) Subject: Texas Light SymbolsDate: February 20, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comHi Linda –I use 3-D CAD software to design kitchen and bath layouts for my business inChicago. What strikes me about the uniqueness of the Texas light symbols isthat they are 3-D; i.e., they occupy space rather than 2-D surfaces, as do theBrazilian and Adamski symbols.The 3-D symbols are going to look different depending upon who is looking atthem from what direction. The 2-D symbols can only project one “meaning”because they are on a flat surface.If someone recreated the light symbols in 3-D CAD, you would be able toreorient them by changing the perspective view and evaluate how theirprojection and possible “meaning” changed.An interesting question is: were the people who recorded the images the oneswho were intended to perceive them? Or did the symbols have greater meaningif they were viewed from a different observation point? And if so, who, ifanyone, were they meant for? 2) Subject: 1463 “Fiery Slab” Object Similar to Texas 3-D “Fiery Frames”?Date: February 6, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comDear Earthfiles,In 1463 A.D., a strange slab-like object was seen gliding over the landscape ofFrance. Described as being surrounded by flames and a bright light.

The caption translates: “Something like a sort of weapon, ormissile, rose with a great noise from the earth and soared into the sky.” The AntiquarianBooksellers' Assoc. of America describes Prodigiorum Liber as “intriguing accounts of 132unnatural events and creatures recorded between 249 and 12 B.C. including storms meteorsearthquakes conflagrations and various kinds of monsters all intended to show miraculousmanifestations of divine power and to be solemn warnings of coming events.”White flames moving inside 3-D rectangular frames, watched by pilot and businessman Steve Allenand two friends on January 8, 2008 between 6:10 and 6:20 PM Central, Selden, Texas.Steve Allen estimated the heights of the rectangular frames to be 150 yards;the width of the rectangles to be 50 yards; and a distance of 1/4 of a milebetween the two rectangles of white fire.

He said as he looked up at it, a brightly lit panelresembling a holographic projection was made visible to him. It hadblack symbols on it and he felt he was supposed to copy thesedown. He ran inside and got paper and pen, and did so, asaccurately as he could. It took him about 10 minutes. He said hewas ‘in a panic’ not only because the was this huge UFO over hishead, but because he felt what he was writing down, and hisaccuracy, was of dire importance. When he was finished, the panelfaded into the body of the UFO, which then moved away to a ‘safedistance,’ then flew off so fast that it was gone in a second. He wasleft with no sense as to what he copied or why he was chosen, buthere it is.”1988, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Ludovico GranchiBlack symbols on brightly lighted panelof large UFO over house of Ludovico Granchi, Rio de Janeiro,1988.

That these may be “ disinformation” tactics. Possibly by the “ military.”The reason: To create public confusion or ridicule of all of the other (real)events in and around Stephenville.2. They could be “real” and be another part of this growing mystery. Orconditioning exercise.About the Stephenville “translation” - My theory, my impression, is thatStephenville is part of an ongoing series of events. Seemingly taking placecontinually. Some events more outstanding than others. It is “part” of aconditioning program.
