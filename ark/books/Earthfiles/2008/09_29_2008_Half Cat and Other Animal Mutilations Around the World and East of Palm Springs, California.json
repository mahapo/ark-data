These are the bloodlesslymutilated cats, rabbits, dogs, horses, cows – and even kangaroos and koalas - around theworld. The following are only some of the unusual animal deaths since June 2008. Therehave also been several animal mutilation reports from Argentina and other South Americanregions and in the future, I will devote another Earthfiles to those South American cases. June 2008Rabbits in GermanyFirst, German rabbits. On Monday, June 9, 2008, the owner of two rabbits in Witten,Dortmund of Germany's Ruhr Valley, found one of his pets gone and the other washeadless. The wave of German rabbit mutilations began in October 2007, increasing inMay of 2008. Now, at least forty rabbits have been beheaded or cut up in odd wayswithout any signs of blood. The police task force spokesman told the UK Independent newspaper: “We have a numberof officers working on the case and we are carrying out exhaustive investigations. But wehave no idea who is doing this. We are still in the dark.”[ Editor's Note: In my book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts &Eyewitnesses © 1994, Earthfiles Shop, the following information is includedabout two rabbit mutilations discovered in Long Island, New York, on April21, 1990.Page 174: “On April 21, 1990, at Sound Beach, Long Island, two rabbitswere found a few hundred feet from each other, dead and mutilated. Noblood, no tracks. One of the rabbits was headless and one had the now classicmutilation feature in which eye tissue is removed around an empty eye socket.Long Island investigators sent Dr. John Altshuler, M. D., pathologist andhematologist in Denver, Colorado, both rabbits as they had been found. In allthe excisions lines on the two rabbits, Dr. Altshuler confirmed evidence ofhigh heat, including cooked hemoglobin shown below.Headless rabbit found at Sound Beach, Long Island, New York,on April 21, 1990.

Cattle in CanadaAlso in June 2008, from Germany across the Northern Hemisphere to Esterhazy,Saskatchewan, Canada, a cow was found dead and bloodlessly mutilated, missing its ear,eye, tongue, jaw flesh, genitals and its rectum was cored out. Not long after that one andsome miles away in Lloydminister, Saskatchewan, another cow was found dead andmutilated. July 2008Half-Cats in Canada, Texas, and California;and Half-Dog in FloridaBy July 1, 2008, a cat in Rutland, British Columbia, Canada, was found bloodlessly cut inhalf. It was one of a dozen mutilated cats found in Rutland since 2004.Three days later on July 4th, in northeastern Dallas, Texas, a cat was found “slit from neckto between its back legs – a very precise cut.” All internal organs had been removed –without blood.Back in Canada in the first half of July, the fourth cat mutilation since 2006 was found inKingston, Ontario, while the sixth mutilated cat was found in Palm Springs, California,prompting the Riverside County Sheriff’s Office to declare the bloodlessly mutilated catsas “unusual and weird.”On July 7, a pet chihuahua dog was found cut in half bloodlessly, and the next day on July8, in St. Petersburg, Florida, a 10-year-old cat was found with a straight, razor-sharp cutfrom its throat down – without blood.The next day on July 8, in Corpus Christi, Texas, the third cat in a month was found cutprecisely in half without blood. By August 2008, the number of mutilated half cats hadincreased to thirteen. Half Cat Background"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"When I was in England the summer of 1999 to study the crop formations in Wiltshire, Ilearned that for a year the London Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animalshad received dozens of reports from residents who had found on their sidewalks or frontyards their cats and rabbits disemboweled, cut in half and even decapitated - usuallywithout blood on the dead cat's hair or at the site of discovery.Since at least the 1970s, a similar pattern of cat mutilations has been reported in Toronto,Ontario, Edmonton, Alberta, and Vancouver, B.C., Canada. Other regions with repeatingcycles of cats cut in half or thirds are Seattle, Bellingham and Bothel, Washington; Plano,Austin, Granbury, Corpus Christi, Fort Worth and San Antonio, Texas; Falls Church,Virginia; Lee, New York; Los Alamos, New Mexico; Tucson and Ahwatakee Foothills,Arizona; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Destin, Mary Esther, St. Petersburg and Navarre,Florida; Tustin and San Diego, California, and in May 2001, in San Jose, California, twodozen cats, a raccoon and a rat were found disemboweled, cut in half and oddly skinned.Half cat discovered October 17, 2005, San Antonio, Texas.Image provided to Earthfiles by resident, Robert Casell.Above: August 2003, Bothel, Washington, first mutilated male cat foundfirst week of August.

See: 091203 Earthfiles.In 1978 in St. Catharines near Toronto, Canada, authorities were frustrated by more than100 missing cats and dogs found in their owners’ yards skinned, decapitated,disemboweled, cut in half or paws removed, without blood at the site.Eleven years later on August 13, 1989, The New York Times reported about 67 cats foundmutilated in Tustin, California - a suburb of Los Angeles near Santa Ana. The NYT wrote:“Some of them were cut in half with what some say is almost surgicalprecision, others disemboweled or skinned. Janet Hampson, a Tustin resident,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"summed up the eeriness of it all: ‘There is never any blood at the scene, theanimals are often dismembered with surgical precision and paws and otherbody parts are often left on the ground in strikingly similar arrangements. Noone ever seems to hear anything, nor do dogs bark during the killing.’ She andothers in her neighborhood speculated that the cats were captured, takenelsewhere, their blood drained and organs or heads or torso removed, and thenthe mutilated cat is replaced on its owner’s lawn – for reasons unknown.”Cycles of cat mutilations have re-occurred in Tustin and in Plano, Texas an affluent suburbnorth of Dallas. In 1991, 1993 and again the past couple of years, police received dozensof reports about cats found cut in half, usually with the front half near the owners' yards orsidewalks. Plano Police Detective Mike Box also had missing reports on more than 80domestic house cats that wore collars and I. D. tags, but were never found. Detective Boxinvestigated satanic cult activities, but could not find any evidence that connected them tothe mutilated and missing cats and other animals such as dogs.Half-cat photographed by Plano, Texas, Police Officer Mike Boxfor Incident Report No. 91-44994, August 31, 1991.In 1992-1993, Vancouver, British Columbia had a rash of cats found cut in half - usuallythe front half was found on the owner's lawn. The Supervisor of Animal Control for theVancouver City Pound told reporters, “The cats are clearly being butchered by someone.It's a real surgical job. And all I hope is that these cats were already dead when they werecut in half.” At the time during those rash of cat mutilations in Vancouver, I was workingwith pathologist and hematologist John Altshuler, M. D., in Denver, Colorado. We wereable to obtain one of the half cats - the front half - for analysis of the abdominal excision.Dr. Altshuler confirmed that the entire excision had been cut with something hot enough tocook the collagen and hemoglobin.By September 15, 1999, the San Jose Mercury newspaper headlined “Cat killer menacessouthern San Jose.” The article began, “ A killer is stalking the cats of southern San Jose,mutilating 21 felines since May 31 - primarily pets taken from owners' yards at night andreturned dead, often dismembered and skinned.”More than 2,000 fliers were distributed by police in south San Jose neighborhoods warningowners to keep their cats indoors. And the Humane Society of Santa Clara Valley posted acash reward that grew to at least $20,000. But no one was ever arrested and arraigned.Six years later, on August 16, 2005, a cat was discovered cut cleanly in half on the frontyard of a south an Jose, California, resident.Yellow arrow points at cat cut in half, discovered in front yard ofsouth San Jose, California, home, on August 16, 2005, about 4:00 PM."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Photograph © 2005 by Thomas G. Holford. August 2008Unusual Cattle Deaths in Arizona and Mutilated Koala in AustraliaOn August 21, the Arizona Department of Agriculture investigated the unusual deaths of40 head of cattle that all died grazing in the same pasture in Chino Valley. More than 150other cattle in the pasture were unharmed. To date, the cause of the cattle deaths has notbeen confirmed.On August 22, at Clear Mountain, northwest of Brisbane, Australia, a 4-year-old maleKoala was found with its abdomen cut open bloodlessly. Earlier in August, a baby Koalawas also found dead and mutilated. September 10, 2008Half-Cat in Bermuda Dunes, CaliforniaBermuda Dunes, California (red A on map) is about a half hoursoutheast of Palm Springs. Map © 2008 by MapQuest.But one of the saddest interviews I have ever done was this month of September with awoman living in a gated condominium community about a half-hour east of Palm Springs,California. The town is called Bermuda Dunes. Helen Cary is a retired dental labtechnician and has lived in her condo for seven years with a male friend and her cat namedPatches. Patches was generally a house cat, but sometimes after dinner, she wantedoutside. Usually she would come back to sleep for the night. Once in awhile she wouldstay out all night and come running in the morning for her food and water. That's what hadhappened on the night of September 9, but by the afternoon of Wednesday, September 10,Patches had not returned and Helen was worried. Then one of her neighborhood friendsfound the front half of Patches laying in a central courtyard of grass. There was no bloodon the fur, no hair on the grass, no other body parts - only the clean, empty upper half ofPatches.A week later, I talked with Helen Cary who was still very upset and periodically cried, buttold me she wanted to speak up in hopes that my Earthfiles and radio broadcasts mighthelp others come forward with more information to help solve who the cat mutilators are.She provided the September 10, 2008, Riverside County Sheriff's Department Indio StationIncident Report copied below with her permission (addresses and phone numbers deleted).Interview:September 10, 2008, Riverside County Sheriff's DepartmentIndio Station Incident Report"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Helen Cary and I have contacted the Riverside County Sheriff's DepartmentIndio Division to pay for copies of the ten digital photographs cited at the top of Page 3in the Incident Report, but so far no photographs of Patches have been released."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Helen Cary, retired dental lab technician, Bermuda Dunes, California: “And I don'tmind you recording me, but right now I'm still having a difficult time. It's only been a weekago today. (Interview on September 17, 2008, after mutilated Patches discovered onSeptember 10, 2008.)WAS IT IN THE MORNING OR AFTERNOON THAT PATCHES WAS FOUND?It was in the afternoon.HAD PATCHES BEEN GONE ALL NIGHT?Yes, she was out all night. My friend that I live with, he had put her out at 9:30 PM, whichis kind of late. She normally goes out right after dinner and then wants to come back in.Then the next morning on September 10, she didn’t come. She was always waiting outsideto get in and eat and drink her water and rest. But, you know, after a couple of hours, Ikind of feared looking for her. We looked everywhere where we thought she would be. AllI had to do was whistle and she would always come running.BUT ON WEDNESDAY, SHE DID NOT COME.No. And my friend, Darlene, two condos away had taken her chihuahua out to do itsbusiness and walked around the corner and thought she saw a cat asleep. And then shewalked up and saw her condition and went and asked her mom and described the cat toher. And so they knew it was mine. Everyone knew Patches.After Darlene found Patches, she called security here who contacted the Riverside CountySheriff’s office. I went down to look at her (cries), but there was only half of her.SO IT WAS ONLY THE FRONT HALF OF THE CAT WITHOUT BLOOD AND NOOTHER PART OF THE CAT AROUND ON THE GRASS?Right. The officer said it looked like a clean, bloodless cut across my cat's chest,right underneath her breast. THROUGH THE SPINE?Ye s .WAS IT RETURNED TO YOUR YARD OR A NEIGHBOR’S YARD?It was just two condos down from me. We all share the same yard. Patches was in thesame big central grass courtyard that goes around the condos. There’s thirteen units.WHEN THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF’S DEPUTY CAME, DID HE TALK ABOUTOTHER CASES THEY HAVE INVESTIGATED THIS YEAR?Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"WHAT DID HE SAY?He said it was not the first. They had found similar cases where they think the person istaking the cat and killing it first and then mutilating it and then just throwing away parts ofit.Darlene and I both walked around all the back and front, just trying to find some other partof Patches. We were both looking, but we didn’t see anything. I mean, there wasn’t evenany hair around. They say if there were a struggle, there would be cat hair. If it had been acoyote eating it, it would have pulled off the hair and left hair balls or something like that.But there was none.Then two days later in the morning (September 12, 2008), I kept looking out the patio doorand I saw something lying by the pool gate. Sure enough, it was Patches’ collar. It doeshave a charm on it. It was not heavy for her, but the wind would not be able to pick it upand blow it, I don’t believe.IT’S VERY STRANGE THAT TWO DAYS AFTER PATCHES WAS FOUND THAT HERCOLLAR THAT WAS MISSING WOULD END UP NEAR A GATE TWO DOORSDOWN FROM YOU. BUT THE DEPUTY MADE IT VERY CLEAR UPON FINDINGTHE CAT’S CHEST BONE CUT IN HALF THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING ACOYOTE COULD DO?When they said it was such a clean cut and they were so certain. Then, when I did talk tothe investigator that I was supposed to call about Patches, I talked to him the next day(Sept. 11, 2008) and the investigator kept in touch with me all day. Then I guess theychanged what they said because they took photos all around where she was before Ipicked her up. The investigators even noticed that there was not any hair around.NO BLOOD ON PATCHES’S OWN FUR?No. The investigators just said it was really clean and her insides, her organs were gone.When the vet did the autopsy on her, she called the investigator and he called me and saidthat Patches did have a broken leg. So, if she was trying to get away, she could notbecause she had a broken leg. And they suggested that she might have gotten hit by a golfcart or car.IS IT POSSIBLE THAT SHE COULD HAVE BEEN DROPPED FROM ABOVE TO THEGROUND?Oh, I don’t know.HOW HAVE THE POLICE LEFT THIS INVESTIGATION WITH YOU NOW?Pretty much that it was a coyote attack after talking to the vet. She told them she was‘99.9% sure that it had been a coyote.’HARD TO BELIEVE.Well, yes. And you know, the gal, Darlene, who was so helpful to me that day, she talkswith everyone around here. She knows the other people who have had problems, but theytold her that if it had been a coyote, they don’t leave anything. They take it with them.They don’t normally leave parts behind.And when the deputies were here, they were quite sure that it had been someone and not acoyote. And Darlene was saying, ‘Well, Animal Control doesn’t want to do the paperwork.They’d rather say it’s coyote and get it over with. That’s what she said other people aresaying around here, too. They don’t want to go through all the paperwork.” The most common explanation for half cat mutilations given by authorities to the media is“a coyote kill” without providing hard evidence. The result is that citizens who havesuffered the half cat phenomenon are convinced the coyote explanation is nothing morethan a way to placate the media and public. Meanwhile, half cat and other unusual animaldeaths persist month after month, year after year somewhere on this planet.If viewers have more information about cat, dog or other mutilated animals in your region,please email me at earthfiles@earthfiles.com.More Information:"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"For further reports about half cat and mutilations, please see my books in the EarthfilesShop and reports below in the Earthfiles Archive:• 10/17/2007 — Updated: Half Cat Mutilations Persist in San Antonio, Texas• 09/28/2007 — Earthfiles Mail About Cat Mutilations• 09/26/2007 — Neatly Sliced Front Third of 14 Cats Found in Granbury, Texas• 10/17/2007 — Updated: Half Cat Mutilations Persist in San Antonio, Texas• 09/28/2007 — Earthfiles Mail About Cat Mutilations• 09/26/2007 — Neatly Sliced Front Third of 14 Cats Found in Granbury, Texas• 08/17/2007 — Two Bulls and Several Cows Dead and Mutilated in Manitoba, Canada• 07/13/2007 — Iowa Minister Reports Large \"Crab/Scorpion\" Creature Attacked Cow• 06/25/2007 — Updated: Half Cat in Waco, Texas, and Kangaroo Mutilations in New SouthWales, Australia• 07/13/2007 — Iowa Minister Reports Large \"Crab/Scorpion\" Creature Attacked Cow• 06/25/2007 — Updated: Half Cat in Waco, Texas, and Kangaroo Mutilations in New SouthWales, Australia• 08/29/2007 — More Half Cats and Dog Mutilations• 06/25/2007 — Half Cat in Waco, Texas, and Kangaroo Mutilations in New South Wales,Australia• 04/09/2007 — More Cat Mutilations - This Time in Corpus Christi, Texas• 08/23/2006 — More Cat and Dog Mutilations• 06/28/2006 — Half Cats in Destin, Florida, and Beheaded Animals in Rochester, N.
