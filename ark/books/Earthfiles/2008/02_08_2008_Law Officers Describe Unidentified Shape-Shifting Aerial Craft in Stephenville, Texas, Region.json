It’s vertical. And he says it is traveling at a low rateof speed and he cannot believe it was able to stay in the air after it turned vertical.” - Lee Roy Gaitan, Constable, Erath County, Dublin, Texas A triangle of three small towns (green circles) southwest of Fort Worth begins with Stephenville,the county seat of Erath County, Texas, population about 15,000. Dublin is about eight milessouthwest and has a population of 3,754. Straight east of Dublin about ten miles is Selden witha full time population of about seven. Further east (red circles) are Glen Rose and Meridian.February 8, 2008 Stephenville and Dublin, Texas - I was in Dublin, Stephenville,Brownwood and Glen Rose, Texas, between January 29 and February 1, to see for myselfvideotapes, photos, and drawings of the unusual aerial lights, craft and plasmas that havebeen reported by dozens of residents there since New Year’s Day. In the first week ofFebruary 2008, there have also been reports of two more disc-shaped aerial lights andmore unusual spherical plasmas at the infrared deer feeder cameras in Brownwood. At thecenter of many of the local investigations is Lee Roy Gaitan, the Erath County Constablein Precinct 2, Dublin, Texas. Lee Roy has been Constable about four years and a policeofficer for seventeen years. Not only is he investigating, he and his son were eyewitnessesthemselves to remarkable aerial lights on January 8, 2008.Lee Roy lives with his wife, son and daughter just south of Dublin. On Tuesday, January8th, around 7 PM local time, he had walked out to his car to get a credit card so the familycould rent a Direct TV movie. The 43-year-old Dublin law enforcement Constable told methat in all his life he had never seen such strange flashing and colors of lights in the sky.Interview:Lee Roy Gaitan, Erath County Constable, Precinct 2, Dublin, Texas: “ As I’m walkingback to the house, I noticed first a red glow in the southwest sky. It was like a fiery redglow. It wasn’t really like a light. It was more like a fiery-looking ball.HOW HIGH IN THE SKY?I’d say about 300 feet up. Then based on a tree line that is across the road, the fiery ballwas maybe 400 to 500 yards away. The red glow caught my attention."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"IS IT MOVING? No, it’s not moving. It appears to be stationary. As I look, it slowly fades away. I’m juststunned, knowing that something is not right. To my surprise, it reappears, almost in ahorizontal line from where it had been, but a little further to the west.DOES IT FADE IN OR POP IN?It seems to fade in like if you would slowly turn on a rheostat switch. But again, it does notlook like a light. It looks more like – the color is a color I’ve never seen before – a fieryred. It was not a bright red. It had kind of a yellowish glow. Anyway, it reappears. Andagain, while I'm looking at it, the fiery ball slowly fades away.I go inside my house and tell my wife. She kinds of looks at me and I go back outside. Mylittle 8-year-old boy follows me. I look at the sky hoping I’ll see the red glow again. Butinstead, off to the west where I saw the red glows – I’d say probably 3,000 to 5,000 feetup in the air – I see white flashes of light. These were bright, almost like an LED brightlight, but not like a flash. It was more like a strobe.SOME PEOPLE HAVE COMPARED THE BRIGHT, WHITE LIGHTS TO THEINTENSITY OF A WELDER'S MAGNESIUM TORCH.I would say it was that bright, but what was so odd about these things is that they weremoving around. They were not staying stationary. They were what I would call, ‘bouncingaround in the sky.’ They would go horizontally, vertically, and not just in a straight line.They were spread out and moving around, not staying in one place.A RANDOM PATTERN?Not, it was no particular pattern. The lights were just moving around.BUT EACH LIGHT WOULD COME ON AND GO OFF. THEN ANOTHER LIGHTWOULD COME ON AND GO OFF?Yes, yes! And it made this thing look like it was just bouncing around. Me and my littleboy sat there and I asked him, ‘How many lights do you see?’ He counted ten and Icounted nine.At this time, I’m so stunned at what I’m seeing that I want to get a better look because Idon’t know what it is. I go to my car and get a pair of binoculars and I try to focus in onone of the lights. I’m having trouble because they are moving around. Finally, when I dosee, I can’t see anything but a light. I could not see an outline. I could not see that thelights were attached to anything. These lights were spread a good distance apart from eachother.We set there and looked at it for awhile and I’d say from the first time I first saw the whitelights – maybe two to three minutes have elapsed. The lights stop bouncing around, butthey continue strobing (on and off randomly). It does this for just a few seconds, maybetwenty seconds.NINE OR TEN LIGHTS ALL FLASHING ON AND OFF AT THE SAME TIME?No, the lights were not blinking on and off at the same time. You would have one lighthere and then another one and it looked like the first light moved over and reappearedflashing at a new position. The lights flashing on and off was all at different times.Anyway, what was so stunning is that after a short time, the lights stopped bouncingaround after two minutes or so. Then, like the lights were all attached to a string, all at onetime, they just shot off to the northeast sky at a blazing speed. I had trouble keeping uppanning my binoculars. It was that quick and they were out of sight. I’m sitting therethinking, ‘What was this thing?’THE LIGHTS MOVED LIKE A SCHOOL OF FISH?Similar, that’s what I would compare it to. They all left in one instant, in one movement.And to my knowledge as I can best recall, I do not remember an outline that I could drawthat would indicate it was some type of craft. That’s what was so stunning to me. In myopinion, no human body could withstand the G-Force of the speed that these things shotoff. Same Hole-Embedded Craft That"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Ricky Sorrells Saw New Year's Day?Computer illustration of Ricky Sorrells' perspective on January 1, 2008, looking upthrough the trees on his Dublin, Texas, property at a “tin barn grey” metal emitting“mirage heat waves” and embedded with cone-shaped holes he thoughtwere equally separated by forty feet over the entire surface of the gigantic aerialcraft above him. Graphic © 2008 by Gregory Watters for Earthfiles.com.RICKY SORRELLS SKETCHED A HUGE OBJECT THAT HE SAW (ON JANUARY 1,2008). NOW, AFTER WALKING INTO THE WOODS TO HIS ENCOUNTER SITE, ISAW WHAT HE MEANT ABOUT STANDING IN ONE POSITION AND SEEING ASFAR AS HE COULD TO HIS RIGHT AND LEFT. THEN HE WALKED IT OFF ANDESTIMATED THE DISTANCE TO BE ABOUT THREE FOOTBALL FIELDS LONG.THAT WOULD BE ABOUT 1,000 FEET IN DIAMETER WITH ALL THOSECONE-SHAPED EMBEDDED HOLES. DO YOU THINK IT’S POSSIBLE THAT WHATHE SAW IN THE SUNSET LIGHT COULD BE WHAT YOU WERE SEEING IN THENIGHT SKY (A WEEK LATER ON JANUARY 8) GENERATING THE LIGHTS FROMTHE CONE-SHAPED HOLES?At first I thought not. But it could have been that or it could have been the object changinghorizontally or vertically moving around. I would say the lights my son and I watched weremaybe 3,000 to 5,000 feet up in the air, and maybe not even that high. But they werespread out in a long distance. My looking at the thing with my naked eye, I’d judge it wasat least a thousand feet long. Other Law Enforcement SightingsCOULD YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE DUBLINAREA HAVE TALKED TO YOU ABOUT SEEING, EVEN THOUGH THEY ARERELUCTANT TO TALK PUBLICLY?Yes. I saw a video that was taken from an in-the-dash camera (of police car) while anofficer was on duty. It was not on the same night (January 8, 2008) that I witnessed thelights with my son.WAS IT EARLIER OR LATER?It was later. As a matter of fact, it was that Saturday (January 12, 2008). I had theprivilege to see this video. I saw what the officer saw on video and this aerial objectchanged forms three different times. The first time, I believe he said it was about 2 AMwhen he first saw it. It’s a white glow moving very slowly in the sky. Then it changes fromwhite to green to blue and red lights. It looks almost like a strobe. Round Aerial Disc Changes Colorsand Shape to a “Jellyfish”"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I watch this thing in the police video and it appears to be some type of aerial object that isround. It changes from white to these different colors. The police officer says, ‘Keepwatching,’ and I watched for approximately another eight minutes. And then this thing,right in front of my eyes, changes and it looks almost like a jellyfish. I compare it maybeeven to a parachute – and now a very bright white. The green and blue and red is no longerflashing. It holds that shape for probably two minutes. And then to my surprise, it changesvertically like a line straight up and down.IT GOES FROM A ‘JELLYFISH’ TO A VERTICAL LINE?To a vertical line.IS IT A SOLID LINE?It appears to be solid. And it’s just white, no longer flashing. Just a bright, white line oflight. It stays in that shape for probably a couple more minutes and then it changes back toits original white – and then goes back to the green, red and blue flashing. This thing ismoving slowly. The officer is having to come into his vehicle and adjust his in-dash camerabecause the aerial object is moving.The police officer tells me he and another officer see another object just like it about amile behind the one he’s been watching. No videotape on the second one, but you can hearthem (on in-dash video) talking about it.While they are videotaping the first object, they are having to zoom in. This camera, Ibelieve, zooms in 600 times, but you are still not able to see any type of craft. I believe Iwatched the videotape for about 16 minutes, and then it’s out of sight. Huge “Cigar-Shape” with Two “Antennas”I later find out I have a call from another law enforcement agency. He called me on aSaturday morning - I believe it was January 19, 2008. He calls me at my residence and tellsme, ‘Hey, I saw something January 8 to 9, the same night that you saw the lights.’I asked him, ‘What did you see?’He said, ‘I was working and see this large object traveling at a very low rate of speedapproximately 300 to 400 feet up in the air. He describes it to be approximately two tothree football fields long. He described it to look something like a cigar with the ends bothrounded off. He said he compared it sort of to a wing of a 747, but he said it was huge!Erath County Constable Lee Roy Gaitan sketched what the police officerhad sketched for him after seeing the huge cigar-shaped aerial craft with two “antennas”topped by red lights moving slowly about 300 to 400 feet in the airnear the Stephenville, Texas, courthouse. Erath County Constable Lee Roy Gaitan sketched what the police officerhad sketched for him after seeing the holes in the bottom of the huge cigar-shaped"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"aerial craft with two “antennas” topped by red lights moving slowly about300 to 400 feet in the air near the Stephenville, Texas, courthouse.Huge Aerial Craft Blocked Out StarsThe police officer says he sees this thing and and it’s blacked out.BLACKED OUT?It didn’t have any lights on it at the time.HE’S SEEING IT IN SILHOUETTE?Yes, he’s seeing it in silhouette against the sky, which was clear that particular night.WHAT TIME WAS THAT?I believe he said it was 20 minutes or so after I saw the lights (around 7:30 - 8 PM, January8, 2008).THE SKY WOULD HAVE BEEN DARK BLACK, RIGHT?The sky was dark black, so it would have been closer to 8 PM when he saw it.HOW DO YOU SEE A DARK SILHOUETTE AGAINST A BLACK SKY?He said it was so huge and because of the stars. I remember that particular night (January8, 2008) – the night I saw the bright lights bouncing around – it was a cool, clear night.HE’S SEEING THE SILHOUETTE BECAUSE IT IS BLOCKING STARS?Yes, and he said it was huge – so huge that at first he wants to get on the police car radiobecause he’s thinking it’s an airliner going down. Then at that time, he sees two, brightlights when it got closer to the Dublin/Stephenville town region. He said they wereamazing. He said the lights were so spread apart and like a color he has never seen before.I asked the police officer if the lights looked like LED and he said, ‘No, it was muchbrighter.’ Anyway, he says this thing comes over the city and at that time, he sees two redlights, each on top of what appears to be antennas, two different antennas. So, he sits thereand watches this thing moving very slowly.OVER DUBLIN?No, over Stephenville. He sees this thing around the Stephenville courthouse downtown.Then he receives a call and has to go back to the police department located close to thecourthouse. The police officer said this huge thing in the sky turns toward the east, but it isno longer horizontal. It’s vertical. And he says it is traveling at a low rate of speed and hecannot believe it was able to stay in the air after it turned vertical.He said that was the last time he saw it. It did not disappear. It was still there when hewent into the police station to take care of his business.There is another officer who would not say a whole lot other than he saw it toward theSelden area just outside of Stephenville.WERE ALL THE POLICE SIGHTINGS AROUND SATURDAY, JANUARY 12?The video I saw of the changing thing to the ‘jellyfish,’ that was January 12. The huge craftthe three law officers claim they saw was January 8, 2008, the night that I and severalother people saw the lights. So, there are two different dates here. Why Are Police Officers Afraid to Speak Publicly?These officers are afraid to speak publicly in fear of (losing) their jobs. They would not gointo detail, but they are terrified that they would possibly jeopardize their employment.DO YOU HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING WHY?I have no idea. In my position (as Dublin Constable), I don’t have a supervisor or boss.The people of Erath County are my boss. So, it would take thousands of people for me tolose my job. But, I’ve heard rumors that one of the local agency heads was concerned."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ABOUT MILITARY?Yes, about possibly military going to come and review the one videotape that I sawchanging to ‘jellyfish’. Whether that is true or not, I do not know.HAVE YOU HAD ANY COMMUNICATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IN ANYFORM BY ANY MILITARY AUTHORITY IN YOUR REGION?Not that I can confirm. I did have at least three phone calls from people who seemed to bevery intelligent and by the questions they asked, I wondered if they had been put up by themilitary. Most of the phone calls to me showed up as registered numbers. These otherthree just showed up as ‘call.’ That really doesn’t mean anything, but they never gave me anumber where I could call them back.They filled me in on what they thought it was. One claimed to have worked on projects bythe military. So, it’s hard to say. I can’t say conclusively they were from the military, butthey were going out of their way to persuade me that it was a military project and nothingelse. And nothing of an alien type craft. One gentleman tried to explain to me what I sawand I told him, ‘No, I disagree with you.’Another gentleman was telling me that we have some things in the military and that’s whatlead me to believe that maybe he was military by the way he was talking to me.IT SEEMS LIKE IT WAS AN EFFORT TO BIAS YOUR MIND AS CONSTABLE.Right.AND THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN INSPIRED BY SOME ORDER GIVEN BY SOMEAUTHORITY, MILITARY OR OTHER, TO CALL PEOPLE WHO WOULD HAVEINFLUENCE ON THE PUBLIC. COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHY YOU, WITH A17-YEAR-LONG CAREER AS A POLICEMAN AND NOW CONSTABLE IN DUBLIN,TEXAS – WHY DO YOU THINK IT IS NOT A TERRESTRIAL, HUMAN-MADEOBJECT?The speed, the way these things were moving around. In my opinion, it would have to beunmanned for sure. There is no way that I can imagine a human being able to withstandthe G-Force of that speed.”For other related Earthfiles reports, please see:• 02/14/2008 — More Aerial “Symbols” Photographed Over Dublin,Te x a s• 02/06/2008 — Updated 02-14-08: Mysterious Symbols Projected inNight Sky by Aerial Disc Near Stephenville, Texas, Local Airport• 02/08/2008 — Law Officers Describe Unidentified Shape-Shifting AerialCraft in Stephenville, Texas, Region• 02/05/2008 — Three Eyewitnesses in Selden, Texas, Saw Two, LargeRectangles of “White Flames” in Sky• 01/28/2008 — Updated 01-28-08: Viewer Letters About Aerial Craftand Military Flyovers Above Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas• 01/18/2008 — Updated with graphic: Huge Aerial Craft Over Dublin,Texas, “Longer Than 3 Football Fields” For further reports about unidentified aerial objects, please see my documentaries, AStrange Harvest and Strange Harvests 1993; also my books An Alien Harvest; MysteriousLights and Crop Circles; and 2-Volume Glimpses of Other Realities in the EarthfilesShop.
