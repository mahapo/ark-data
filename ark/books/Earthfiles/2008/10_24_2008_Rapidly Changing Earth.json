Image courtesy NOAA. October 24, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - In October, scientists reported that thefall temperatures in the Arctic broke all record highs – averaging 5 degrees Celcius abovenormal, which is 9 degrees Fahrenheit above normal!All that Arctic warming has caused the highest sea level rise on record. It doesn’t seem likea big number – only .254 centimeters a year – but it still means Arctic waters are rising asmore and more ice melts from the warmer and warmer Arctic temperatures.All the Arctic sea ice melt in 2008 was the second greatest since satellite measurementsbegan in 1979. The volume of Arctic ice melt might be even more than 2007, which holdsthe number one spot for area of ice melt. That makes two years in a row of record-breakingArctic ice melt.The consequences so far are:a) the decline of reindeer herds;b) green shrubs are now moving into Arctic areas that used to be permafrost;c) and the saltiness of the Arctic Ocean and North Atlantic is being diluted by all the freshice water runoff. Less salt in the North Atlantic water means less density. Less densitycould slow down – or even stop – the North Atlantic Oscillation that brings warmequatorial waters to the North Atlantic. It’s that oscillation of warm water from the equatorto the British Isles that helps keep the U. K. and Europe warmer. The reason the oscillationmight stop is that less salty water is lighter and won’t sink as deeply and rapidly.If the North Atlantic Oscillation stopped, the warmer waters would not reach the NorthAtlantic. So, in one of the great ironies of global warming, the faster the warming NorthPole melts, the more likely temperatures will drop in the U. K. and Europe. 3rd Annual Arctic Report Card"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"“The planet is interconnected, so what happensin the Arctic does matter to the rest of the world.Changes in the Arctic show a domino effect frommultiple causes more clearly than in other regionsof our planet.” - 3rd Annual Arctic Report CardThis latest data was released in the “Third Annual Arctic Report Card” compiled by 46scientists from ten countries, who are monitoring what’s happening in the Arctic.The Hadley Computer Lab Center in Britain’s Meteorological Office warned in Octoberthat unless global greenhouse gas emissions start reducing 3% a year beginning in 2010, theaverage global mean temperature of Earth will rise by at least 4 degrees Fahrenheit overthe next 90 years - 4 times the rate of global warming in the 20th Century. And a 4 degreesFahrenheit rise or warmer is the tipping point where scientists and computer modelsforecast serious sea level rise measured in feet, not centimeters. Earth Life That Faces Extinctionin the Face of Rapid Global WarmingA 4-degrees-Fahrenheit global warming and sea level rise also means extinctions of Earthlife that won’t be able to adapt fast enough to their rapidly changing ecosystems.At the top of the list of larger animals that will probably be gone by the end of the 21stCentury are polar bears. Those beautiful, powerful Arctic mammals are already beingforced by unprecedented Arctic ice melt to swim miles for a meal – and then drown whenthey can’t find ice floes to get out of the water.Polar bear swimming underwater in Arctic.Image source Dailygalaxy.com.Other large and beautiful creatures at the opposite end of the world that might not surviverapid 21st Century warming are penguin colonies in Antarctica. The World Wildlife Fundreported in October that a 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit (2 degrees Celsius) global warming thiscentury could kill 75% of the Adelle Penguins and 50% of the great Emperor Penguins."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Antarctica wildlife facing extinction in 21st Century global warming are(left) Adele Penguin parent and chicks and (right) Emperor Penguins.Image source Teachersnetwork.org. Earth Warming More Quickly Than ExpectedSome computer models now show that if the current rate of greenhouse gas build up is notreduced, the now projected 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit/ 2 degrees Celcius global warmingcould be reached by 2050 – only 4 decades from now - much earlier than the originallyprojected end of century in 2100.It’s not only the North and South Poles that are warming. The tropics near the Equator inonly the last 30 years have experienced average temperatures rising by 1.4 degreesFahrenheit (.78 degrees Celcius), making the tropics as warm as they were 2 million yearsago. And in an even greater warming increase, climate models predict tropical forests inCentral and South America will warm up 6 more degrees Fahrenheit over the rest of thiscentury.Costa Rica lowland tropical rain forest.Image © 2008 by MonteverdeInfo.com.Ecologist Robert Colwell at the University of Connecticut decided to document whatspecies of plants and creatures are living in the tropics now and what might happen to themin such increasing temperatures. He and a science team surveyed 1900 species of plantsand insects from sea level to about 10,000 feet along the slopes of a volcano in northernCosta Rica.Their findings were published in the October 13, 2008, journal Science. More than half ofthe plants and insects will have to move 2,000 feet higher up the mountain as temperatureswarm. That means moving into completely new territories which will be a stress. But evenworse, many species won’t be able to move upward because most mountainside forests inthe tropics have been severely fragmented by human land use."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Prof. Colwell concluded, “Because lowland tropical forests are already the warmest forestson Earth, there are no replacement species waiting in the wings to replace these lowlandspecies, as there are for many places at higher latitudes.”That means there could be an emptying of life in tropical lowland forests – including themiddle of the Amazon – sort of like dead zones in the oceans, but these would be tropicallowlands without much life.Other scientists argue that over the past 45 million years, Earth temperatures have oftenfluctuated without large extinctions of life in lowland tropics. But one thing is certain:lowland tropical creatures will only be able to cool off by going upward to higherelevations where they can. That means tropical mountain sides and mountain tops couldbecome Noah’s Ark refuges for thousands of plants, insects and other species as thiscentury unfolds. Poland Conference On Climate Change,December 1 - 14, 2008 The scientific global warming data keeps piling up with implications that our world ischanging so much and so rapidly that by 2100, some regions might be unrecognizable - tryto imagine Brazil without the Amazon rainforest. In December 2008, various nations arescheduled to have representatives meet in Poland to discuss a new international treaty tocut down global greenhouse emissions – going beyond the Kyoto Protocol. But manyscientists are warning that the proposed 3% reduction in greenhouse gas emissionsbeginning in 2010 would be almost impossible to achieve.Beyond scientists, the American public is finally paying serious attention to climate change.It cannot be ignored after 5 years of intense hurricane damage, devastating floods andtornadoes in the Midwest and southeast with roads and houses cracking and buckling inmelting Alaskan permafrost and the beloved polar bears drowning in the expanding Arcticwaters.On October 20th, Yale and George Mason Universities surveyed more than 2,000 adultsand found that two thirds to three quarters of voters say that global warming is one of themost significant issues that will influence their vote on November 4, 2008. “Engineering Earth to Stop Climate Change”- Discover Magazine, November 2008"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"In fact, there is so much growing concern about how to slow down global warming that inthe November 2008 issue of Discover Magazine, under the title: “Engineering Earth toStop Climate Change” – some surprising facts and proposals are outlined.1) According to the Natural Resources Defense Council, the projected cost ofclimate change worldwide by 2100 – if nothing is done to reduce greenhousegas emissions and the earth warms up at least another 4 degrees Fahrenheit –the cost will be at least:$ 1,873,000,000,000What will eat up over $1 trillion? More erratic weather with flooding, droughtsand severe tornadoes and hurricanes. Global warming produces both extremesof too much water and not enough water around our planet.2) Atmospheric physicist Wallace Broecker, Ph.D., at NOAA’s GoddardInstitute for Space Studies (GISS) in New York proposes building 60 million,50-foot-high towers to capture all of the world’s carbon emissions that canthen be pumped into saline aquifers.3) Another proposal is to launch into orbit around Earth stacks of reflectivediscs every 5 minutes for 10 years until 850,000 discs are circling in Earthorbit and reflecting back some of the sun’s heat.4) Yet another sunshine-reducing idea is copied after Mt. Pinatubo’s hugeeruption in 1991 where the volcano blew its top in the Philippines and spewed20 million tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere. All that volcanic sulfurdioxide reduced solar heat for quite awhile.Ash plume of Pinatubo after June 15, 1991, eruption. 20 million tons of sulfur dioxidespewed into the atmosphere and temporarily reduced solar light and heating.Image courtesy USGS.That gave Nobel laureate and atmospheric chemist, Paul Crutzen, the idea to shoot 5.3million tons of sulfur dioxide into the atmosphere each year in order to keep CO2 emissions"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"from doubling.But if scientists and politicians start launching sulfur dioxide, little reflecting discs andother sunshine-deflecting substances to reduce global warming, the amount of worldwiderainfall could be reduced beyond control, causing global droughts. It’s like that old saying,“Don’t fool with Mother Nature or you’ll regret it.”Human civilization and all its industrialized gases have been changing the balance ofNature on Earth quickly. The painful consequences of our ignorance are going to keepincreasing for the foreseeable future. Antarctica Ice Mystery“You can almost think about it as exploring another planet -but on Earth. This region (of Alps-size mountains) is a complete enigma.It's in the middle of the continent. Most mountain ranges are on the edgesof continents, and we really can't understand what these mountains aredoing in the center (down 4 kilometers beneath ice).”- Fausto Ferraccioli, Ph.D., British Antarctic SurveyAircraft will use radar to detect ice thickness and map shape of the subglacialGamburtsev Mountains underneath 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) of Antarctic ice. Gravityand magnetic surveys will help determine structure, and seismic waves will probe mysteriousmountains' rock properties. The subglacial mountains were discovered by a 1957-1958 Soviet teamwhere scientists thought the interior would be flat. An international team of scientists from theU. K., U. S., Germany, Australia, China and Japan will set off in December for aboutthree months of work. Graphic courtesy AGAP, Antarctica's Gamburtsev Province project.But this won’t be the first time that our planet changes temperatures and ice distributionsrapidly. The center of Antarctica is covered by 2.5 miles of ice. And yet below all that iceis one of Earth’s greater mysteries: the subglacial Gamburtsev Mountains as big as the Alpsare encased at the bottom of all that Antarctic ice. No one knew there was a huge mountainchain beneath Antarctica until a Soviet team of scientists explored there in 1957 to 1958.No one knows how the tall mountains formed in the middle of the Antarctic continent. Butthere might be more answers about the mysterious under-ice mountains by the spring of2009.In December 2008, an international team of scientists from the U. K., United States,Germany, Australia, China and Japan will set off for about three months of work. Aircraftwill use radar to detect ice thickness and map shapes of the subglacial GamburtsevMountains underneath the 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) of Antarctic ice. Gravity and magneticsurveys will help determine structure, and seismic waves will probe mysterious mountains'rock properties. from the U. K., U. S., Germany, Australia, China and Japan will set off inDecember for about three months of work.Prof. Fausto Ferraccioli, Ph.D., one of the British Antarctic Survey team members,describes their scientific challenge this way: “ You can almost think about it as exploringanother planet - but on Earth. This region (of Alps-size mountains) is a complete enigma.It's in the middle of the continent.
