If you walked up outside the shipand put your hands at the right place, if it does not know you,the ship is not going to open up.” - Arizona Abductee Return to: Part 1June 15, 2008 Phoenix, Arizona -Interview Continued:“WHEN EXACTLY DID YOU FINALLY GET TO GO INTO THE CRAFT?This would be like the next summer in 1966. By then, I had been seeing Zoevery two weeks or so.HOW?He would land and I would hear the beeping sound.WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF ZO’S EVERY TWO WEEKS TRIPS?Just to talk. That changed, though. After about six months, there were othersthat came with Zo. Before, I had always had a sense there were people insidethe disc. When Zo did come out with others together, they looked like thesame type of people, but they didn’t look like identical clones. Each was anindividual in the way they spoke and what they did.About six months later in the wintertime, I met up with Zo. We didn’t have asmany meetings in the winter as we did in the summer. I just remembered thatwhen I was around that disk in the winter, I was not cold. It was when I leftwhere the disc was that I got cold. In January 1967, he showed up in thewinter and I went down to the woods. Zo had this other fellow with him. Zointroduced him as a star scientist, an astronomer. Zo told me scientist couldanswer my questions.So, we were talking and he was pointing out stars and telling me aboutdifferent ones. I told him I had been reading books and wanted to learn a lotmore. He said he would be back and Zo asked me if I were ready to go toschool with them so I could learn what they knew.I asked, ‘Can we really do that?’ I was excited!Zo said, ‘Sure, I think that would be perfect.’ After that, every time they cameback, there would be someone to teach me. There came a point in time aroundthe spring of 1968 when they would teach me that I was allowed to go insidethe disc. The way they would teach me is to sit me down and we would talk afew minutes. Then they would say telepathically, ‘Are you ready?’I closed my eyes and the next thing I knew, there was a pressure in my headlike if someone had their hands on the sides of your head and was pushingreally hard? But there was no one physically doing that. Then the pressurewould release and Zo and the others would be standing there looking at meand asking, ‘Are you all right?’I’d say I was OK and then they would say, ‘Then let’s talk about ...’ and wewould go into a subject and I would know the answers and could tell them!That’s how they validated that their teaching process from the pressure"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"worked (download into his brain).THE INTERPRETATION IS THAT WHEN YOU HAD THE PRESSURE ONTHE SIDES OF YOUR HEAD, IT WAS A DOWNLOAD OFINFORMATION INTO YOUR HEAD. THEN THE DIALOGUEAFTERWARD WAS FOR ZO AND THE OTHERS TO ASSESS HOWMUCH HAD YOU RECEIVED AND WERE COMPREHENDING?Exactly. But quite rapidly there was a problem. After I went home from thatencounter, I started having really bad headaches. My head hurt with spikes ofpain and I could not make it stop. The pain would last for maybe an hour andthen it was over.The next time they showed up, I told them that happened and they were allvery concerned. Zo asked me how often it was happening and I told them itwas happening every two or three days.Then they had me go to another part of the craft where I would sit down. Idon’t remember exactly what happened, but they put me in a reclining kind ofseat that seemed to fit me very well. My head went back into a bowl-shapedthing. Then I fell asleep. They were talking to each other telepathically. WhenI woke up again, I was still there with my head in the bowl. It did not seemlike I was there very long. When I got back outside, it was still afternoon. Thiswas a day time event, not at night. The sun was still up in late afternoon. Theyseemed to be pleased with what happened and Zo asked me, ‘How does yourhead feel now?’I said, ‘Well, it doesn’t hurt.’ And Zo said, ‘We’ll see how that works.’ And Inever had a headache again after that.What Zo told me later is that the right and left hemispheres of my brain -something about the way they communicate with each other was not as itshould be and they had to link the right and left hemispheres in order for meto be able to use what they had given me.LIKE ROBERT MONROE’S HEMI-SYNC TECHNIQUE?Yes, very much like that. I’ve done that before and it works really great forme. Zo said it was necessary because I had been trained to separate the leftand right hemispheres – and my hemispheres did not communicate at the samelevel. They were supposed to be balanced.In order for me to use Zo’s information and do so in a way that I could seeand interpret and digest and then bring forward the information, my brainhemispheres had to be linked. That was the only way it would all work. So,what they had done is to link my left and right brain hemispheres. From thatpoint on, when they put information in me, there wasn’t any more pressure orheadaches and I ended up for awhile with a photographic memory. I had allthis information. It was astonishing. I was very smart at one time. Interior of Craft - Hand-Imprinted PanelsUsed to Pilot DiscCAN YOU GIVE A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE DISCINTERIOR LOOKS LIKE?It did not look like Star Trek. It was actually quite simple. The area wherethere were chairs, the chairs looked like they were metal, but they did not feellike metal. When I sat in one of the chairs, it seemed to conform to my body.The way the ship was piloted – the only thing that looks anything like it and Iwas astonished when I saw it – was a Disney movie about a little boy who getsinside a UFO and he puts his hand on this panel thing. The way the ship ispiloted is that your hands go down on these two places. Your right hand iswhere all the control is. The left hand can do some other aspects of control,but most is your right hand.THE IMPRINTS IN THE CONSOLE LOOK LIKE RIGHT AND LEFTHANDS?Yeah, and it does not matter how big your hand is because the hand spaceschanged and molded right to my hand."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In other words, if you put your hands in there, your fingers go into kind ofsockets, little indentations. You can move each finger independently or makea fist or undo the fist. The console imprints move with you very fluid-like, butthat is what makes the disc go and you can’t make it go unless it knows you.WHAT DOES THAT MEAN TO YOU?Zo told me that the ship was alive and it recognizes who is in there. The shipwon’t work unless it knows you. If you walked up outside the ship and putyour hands at the right place, if it does not know you, the ship is not going toopen up. The ship knows what is going on – it’s keeping track of everything.DOES THAT IMPLY THAT THE CRAFT IS MADE OF NEURONS?I never got that far in what I knew about the craft from what they taught me.They did not teach me about how the craft lives or how it is made – just thatthe craft is alive and it knows me.DID ZO TRY TO TEACH YOU HOW TO FLY THAT CRAFT?No, but I knew how because after a certain point, I was able to pull things outof his mind just like he was able to put things in my mind. I had alreadylearned how to merge with him and pull all his information into my mind. Zowas not upset with that at all. He thought that was great.BUT YOU NEVER DID TRY TO FLY THE CRAFT?No.LET’S GO BACK INSIDE THE CRAFT AND TRY TO GIVE COLORS,DIMENSIONS, WHAT KINDS OF SURFACES. WERE THEREEMBEDDED DRAWERS, CABINETS, SCREENS, LIGHTS?When you walk up to the craft, you don’t even have to put your hand flat.You just put the back of your hand and touch a specific area on the craft. YOU TOUCHED WITH THE BACK OF YOUR HAND, NOT WITH THEPAL M?Yes, you don’t have to touch it with your palm. Or you can touch it with yourfingertips after turning your hand over. The craft knows me. When thathappens, very quickly you see a door opens and there’s a little ramp you canuse if you need to. The ramp will extend itself out depending on whether thecraft is on the ground or above the ground. If the craft is above the ground,the ramp acts as an incline to go inside. I had to bend over because the edgeof the entrance in the craft is about at my hairline. So, I bent over, walkedinside and it’s open so I can enter. When you are inside the craft, the craftknows you are in there. If no one else is outside with you, the craft just closesright up behind you really fast. There is no sound. The door opening is thereand then it’s not. You can’t see where the door was. It’s just one contiguouspiece, but then the opening just shows up.When you get inside, it’s pretty obvious where the door was because you canturn around and look and there is a place there that you know that’s whereyou would go outside.You walk inside the area on this particular craft, which was circular, andprobably 20 feet across. And inside, one part of it had a pretty high ceilingbecause I could not reach up and touch it. But going up there were some sortof supports, but not like grid work. It was more like beams that move out ofthe ceiling and into the walls. Then there was something at the very top thatflattened off. It doesn’t come up like a dome on the top. It comes up andflattens off. Inside, there are a series of chairs to sit in.HOW MANY? ARE THEY IN A SINGLE ROW?There’s one when you walk in that is immediately to the left and that’s next toa work station of some sort. To the right of that – and we’re going aroundclockwise now from the entrance – to the right there is an area that hadscreens and there was like a table that was part of the wall, but somehow itwould fold down or come up. I was never really clear on the details of thatother work station. You did not see any beakers or cups with pencils in it –meaning, there was nothing loose and lying around. Everything was very tidy.You continue going around and there was a door that went somewhere else"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"and I think it went where you could lay down. Further to the right was anotherwork station and then another one. So, there were three work stations andthen a space. Back from that space – but not really in the center – more likethe next ring back from the chairs at the work stations, there was a pilot’schair where the person would sit who flew the craft. It was built up on apedestal and he sat there. Skin of Craft Can Become TransparentThat was where the person would be looking outside because they showed mehow they turned the walls clear and it was incredible. Where there had been awindow, that would disappear and become a solid wall. Then they could makethe window reappear. They could do that to the floor.SO THE OPAQUENESS OF A SILVER DISC, FOR EXAMPLE, COULD BEMADE COMPLETELY TRANSPARENT TO THE ENVIRONMENT?Yes, it seemed to be.THAT’S WHAT TRAVIS WALTON DESCRIBED AS WELL. [ Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest near Heber, Arizona, November 5, 1975. See TheWalton Experience © 1978 by Travis Walton. ]Then to the right of where the pilot would be looking forward – a wide viewbetween two chairs – the person on the left chair would be looking off to theright and their view would start at about their shoulders and go aroundprobably between noon and 4 pm on a clock.Then there was another work station and the door space again. That workstation in the 4 o’clock position was smaller than the rest of them.DID YOU GET TO SEE ALL THE WORK STATIONS FILLED WITHBEINGS?No, there were only two or three people with Zo. 1969: Zo Takes William Into Space Around EarthDID YOU EVER SEE ZO IN THE POSITION OF THE CENTRAL PILOTPOSITION?Yes, he sat there. There were two things that happened. One time when I wasa little older, I was probably 16 in 1969, I told Zo I wanted to see what it waslike to go somewhere in the disc craft. I had been seeing it for three years. Iwanted to see what it was like to fly in it. So, he met me one afternoon wayback in the Kentucky woods. It was not near the house. Zo told me where togo in the woods and I got there at the time he told me to be there, even thoughit was a long way.I remember it was a white, puffy cloud day in early summer. He met meoutside. We walked into the craft after he had me open the thing up. I touchedwith my fingertips and the opening was there. We went inside and the openingclosed right behind us. He asked me to have a seat, so I sat at the work stationthat would be to Zo’s left of the raised pilot's platform.Zo was very casual and put his hands in both of the hand imprints on theconsole. He moved his left hand and said, ‘Watch the floor.’ There was nosensation of any movement.I looked down and, My God! It was like you were watching something in anIMAX theater. I had the view to my left and through the floor and Zo wassitting right over the floor view. We’re just moving straight up! But I don’tknow how to explain it because there was no feeling of movement.YOU WERE SEEING THE EARTH RECEDING BELOW THETRANSPARENT FLOOR?Yeah, and quickly until we got to a point where we were way above the Earth– kind of like what you see in the NASA shots with the space shuttle. I couldsee this thin – I know now it was the Earth’s atmosphere - but I remember"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"seeing the thin, blue line and we went in a direction. Zo said we were goinginto darkness and we went into darkness on the dark side of the Earth.Then Zo said, ‘Here’s the moon.’ And we turned and there was the moon.Then Zo said, ‘Now, it’s time for dawn.’ Then I saw the sun starting to shinethrough the atmosphere and it was just absolutely astonishing. There aren’tany words. You could see the ocean. You could see the planet. You could seeice at the pole. And there were so many places I wanted to go! I wanted to goto South America and to see what it would be like to buzz the Eiffel Tower inParis.But Zo said, ‘I have to get you back. We can’t do this for very long.’WHY DO YOU THINK THERE IS ALWAYS A RUSH, A SHORTNESS OFTIME, WITH THE NON-HUMANS?For Zo, I think it was where I lived and my living situation. He knew I hadonly a certain amount of time to be away from home without getting intotrouble.BUT COULD SHORT TIME RELATE TO WHERE HE IS FROM? DID YOUHAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT ZO BEING FROM ANOTHERSOLAR SYSTEM IN THIS GALAXY? OR WAS HE A TIME TRAVELER?I never had a sense that he was a time traveler, but he certainly seemed toknow a lot about the future because of the things they were intent on showingme after this flight experience. First, they showed me the flight and then onthe next visit, Zo came in a different ship.WHAT DID THAT NEXT CRAFT LOOK LIKE?Instead of a flying saucer, it looked more like a big, thick, flat, flying pancake.And thick at the center.WAS IT LIKE A COIN SEEN FROM THE SIDE?It was like that, maybe 12 feet tall.HOW DID YOU ENTER THE PANCAKE CRAFT?Same way. But after it landed, I was walking around looking at it thinking,‘Oh, great, what if this is not Zo.’ I got worried that it might be somebody elseinside who wouldn’t care about me. Zo told me there were visitors who werenot friendly to humans on this world. So, I took off running and I heard in mymind, ‘Stop! This is Zo!’” Continued in: Part 4More Information:For further information about the human abduction syndrome, please see my books anddocumentaries in the Earthfiles Shop and in the Earthfiles Archive:• 05/20/2008 — High Strangeness in Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada• 04/29/2008 — Part 1: Insights from An Experiencer with Greys and Blond Humanoids• 04/06/2008 — Final Part 10: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 04/02/2008 — Part 9 - Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/30/2008 — Part 8 - Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/20/2008 — Part 7 - Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/15/2008 — Part 6 - Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/08/2008 — Part 5: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/04/2008 — Part 4: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/03/2008 — Updated Part 1: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/02/2008 — Part 2: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/02/2008 — Part 3: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 02/22/2008 — Updated: Three Eyewitnesses in Selden, Texas, Saw Two, Large Rectanglesof “White Flames” in Sky• 02/14/2008 — Update: Mysterious Symbols Projected in Night Sky by Aerial Disc NearStephenville, Texas, Local Airport• 02/08/2008 — Law Officers Describe Unidentified Shape-Shifting Aerial Craft inStephenville, Texas, Region• 01/28/2008 — Updated 01-28-08: Viewer Letters About Aerial Craft and Military FlyoversAbove Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas• 01/18/2008 — Updated: Huge Aerial Craft Over Dublin, Texas, “Longer Than 3 FootballFields”"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"• 01/07/2008 — Part 15: In League With A UFO• 12/22/2007 — Part 10: In League With A UFO• 12/16/2007 — Part 8: In League With A UFO• 12/14/2007 — Part 7: In League With A UFO• 12/11/2007 — More Confirmation of May 1974 Discs in Albuquerque and Huge CylinderCraft At White Sands Provi ng Ground.• 11/25/2007 — Part 4: In League With A UFO• 09/16/2007 — Part 5: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/11/2007 — Part 4: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/07/2007 — Part 3: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/05/2007 — Part 2: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 08/31/2007 — Part 1: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured!• 08/31/2007 — Part 2: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured!• 08/30/2007 — Part 1: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 07/31/2007 — Part 2, Non-Human Blonds, Greys and Big-Nosed, Cat-Eyed Lizards• 06/26/2007 — Part 1: Explanation of the Recent \"Strange Craft\" Sightings• 05/11/2007 — CIA Origin of National Enquirer?• 03/16/2007 — Tenth Anniversary of March 1997 Phoenix Lights: What Was the 2-Mile-LongTriangular Craft?• 02/18/2007 — Part 4: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails fromViewers and Listeners• 02/15/2007 — Grey Non-Human Floats in Air At New Orleans Defense Contractor Site• 02/14/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails fromViewers and Listeners• 02/12/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails fromViewers and Listeners• 02/11/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails fromViewers and Listeners• 01/26/2007 — Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans• 01/26/2007 — Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans• 01/26/2007 — Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota: Encounters with Non-Humans• 01/08/2007 — Updated: Attorney Describes His Encounter with Non-Human Entities• 12/14/2006 — Abductee Jim Sparks's Encounter with Reptillian Beings, Their Warning andPossible Agenda• 10/11/2006 — Part 2: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee• 10/08/2006 — Part 1: Time Travel, Insights from USAF Sergeant and UFO Abductee• 09/29/2006 — Manipulation of Time and Matter by Non-Humans: The Experiences of JimSparks• 09/05/2006 — Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 09/04/2006 — Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 07/28/2006 — 1940s USAF Flight Surgeon's Account of E.
