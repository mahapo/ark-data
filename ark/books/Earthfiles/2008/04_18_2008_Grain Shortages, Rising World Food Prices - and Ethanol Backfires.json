S. corn crop,which represents a whopping 40% of the world's corn supply.” - Colin Carter, Ph.D., UC-Davis Corn ethanol plant in South Dakota. Image © 2006 by Greg Harp.April 18, 2008 Davis, California - In February , I received a phone call from a NorthDakota farmer who I had talked to before on other farm issues. He said he and his wheatfarmer colleagues were having a hard time finding durham wheat seed to plant for a croplater this year. He wondered why there was such a short seed supply. Wheat prices haverisen from $4/ a bushel in 2007 to around $25/bushel this spring of 2008.The U.S. Department of Agriculture confirms that global wheat stocks are at their lowestlevel in 30 years, while U.S. wheat stocks are the lowest they’ve been in 60 years. Hardred spring wheat, used especially by the baking industry, has been scarcest of all. NorthDakota leads the nation in acres devoted to certified seeds and Steve Sebesta, NorthDakota's Deputy Seed Commissioner, says hard red spring seed is down 15% from itsNorth Dakota volume in 2007.East Coast bakeries have faced huge increases this year in the prices they have to pay forflour. Len Amoroso, Executive Vice President of Amoroso's Baking Co. in Philadelphiatold The Wall Street Journal, “We are talking about prices that are just unheard of.” Themiddle of February 2008, he was paying $48 per 100 pounds of flour from hard red springwheat, which he uses to make sandwich rolls and other bakery products. A year ago, Mr.Amoroso said he was paying about $14.60.Then came worldwide headlines from the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF)and United Nation's Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warning that mounting foodprices in 37 poorer countries was going to provoke more violent riots, as already happenedin Haiti, Egypt and the Philippines.On April 11, 2008, Haitians look at the damagescaused by looters at a gas station in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, during riotsto protest high food prices. At least five people died. On April 12, 2008, PrimeMinister Jacques Alexis was fired over the food riots.

Thatmoney was released the day after the World Bank called upon the international communityto \"put our money where our mouth is\" to help immediately the poor in Haiti, Egypt andthe Philippines where protests over escalating food prices have provoked violence. At least34 other poor countries in the world are also struggling to eat.What happened between last year and this year to cause wheat, soy, and other grain seedshortages in at least some local American regions and what is forcing food prices to rise sorapidly in the United States and internationally?I took that question to Colin Carter, Ph.D., Prof. of Agricultural and Resource Economicsat the University of California – Davis. Prof. Carter received his Ph.D. in AgriculturalEconomics from the Univ. of California – Berkeley in 1980 and has spoken beforeCongressional committees on agricultural economy issues.A year ago in the May 17, 2007 issue of the Los Angeles Times, he co-authored an Opinionpiece entitled, “Why Ethanol Backfires.” [ See Websites below.] The article begins:“Policymakers and legislators often fail to consider the law of unintendedconsequences. The latest example is their attempt to reduce the United States'dependence on imported oil by shifting a big share of the nation's largest crop,corn, to the production of ethanol for fueling automobiles.President Bush has set a target of replacing 15% of domestic gasoline use withbiofuels (ethanol and biodiesel) over the next 10 years, which would requirealmost a fivefold increase in mandatory biofuel use, to about 35 billiongallons. With current technology, almost all of this biofuel would have tocome from corn because there is no feasible alternative. However, achievingthe 15% goal would require the entire current U.S. corn crop, whichrepresents a whopping 40% of the world's corn supply. This would do morethan create mere market distortions; the irresistible pressure to divert cornfrom food to fuel would create unprecedented turmoil....it would make far more sense to import ethanol from Brazil and othercountries that can produce it efficiently (from sugar cane and corn) - and alsoto remove the 54-cents-per-gallon tariff on Brazilian ethanol imports.”So, I asked Prof. Carter if it were correct to focus on the ethanol policy in the U.S., whichis increasing the amount of American soil devoted to ethanol production instead of food,as perhaps the cause of dominoes falling in grain seed shortages, higher food prices and agrowing international food crisis in poor countries?Interview:Colin Carter, Ph.D., Prof. of Agriculturaland Resource Economics, UC-Berkeley.Colin Carter, Ph.D., Prof. of Agricultural and Resource Economics at the Universityof California – Davis, Davis, California: “One bushel of corn gives you approximately2.8 gallons of ethanol. So, it would take virtually the entire corn crop to produce 35 billiongallons of ethanol to meet President Bush's goal."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"You take 10 billion bushels of corn x 3 instead of 2.8 to make calculation easier = 30billion. So, there’s your total U. S. corn crop right there. There's also talk about using othermaterials for ethanol, such as switchgrass. That’s great and there’s a lot of research goingon in that area and it would be wonderful if we found a new crop that was virtuallycostless. But, the technology is not there. The infrastructure is not there. It’s true you canproduce ethanol from switchgrass. But we don’t have the mechanism for collecting andtransporting it. What are the economics of that?[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a warmseason grass and is one of the dominant species of the central North Americantallgrass prairie. It can be found in remnant prairies, along roadsides, pasturesand as an ornamental plant in gardens. Other common names for it include tallpanic grass, Wobsqua grass, lowland switchgrass, blackbent, tall prairiegrass,wild redtop and thatchgrass. Switchgrass can be used to make cellulosicethanol.Field of 12-foot-tall switchgrass.In his 2006 State of the Union Address, U. S. President George W. Bushtouted switchgrass as an efficient and environmentally friendly biofuel thatcould reduce the USA's dependence on oil. Currently, the bulk of ethanol ismade from grains, primarily corn. Cellulosic ethanol on the other hand is madefrom the woody matter of plants, such as the corn stalks.Two grasses have been prominent in cellulosic discussions: Switchgrass, andMiscanthus. Switchgrass is a species native to North America and is wellsuited to the Great Plains and even the depleted cotton farms of the AmericanSouth. It needs little water, fertilizer or pesticides. The DOE has demonstratedyields that support the average fuel requirements of three cars per year fromone acre. Miscanthus is reported to double the yield of switchgrass.Miscanthus is native to Europe. Sterile strains are available for thoseconcerned with invasive species.] As we say in the article, producing ethanol from sugar is much more efficient than fromcorn. With corn, you have to turn it into sugar first. So, producing ethanol from sugar caneis a heck of a lot more efficient. That’s what Brazil is good at. But we keep that productout with a tariff.SO, WHY DID THIS ADMINISTRATION FOCUS ON CORN?Corn farmers! (laughs) ADM.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), is one of thelargest agricultural processors in the world. ADM website: “Serving as a vitallink between farmers and consumers, we take crops and process them to makefood ingredients, animal feed ingredients, renewable fuels and naturallyderived alternatives to industrial chemicals.”Founded in 1902 and incorporated in 1923, ADM is headquartered inDecatur, Illinois, and operates processing and manufacturing facilities acrossthe United States and worldwide. ]“Who do you suppose benefits from this policy? It’s companies like ADM, who have"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"ethanol plants. And the corn producers. Now we have the problem that a lot of farmershave invested money into building ethanol plants in their communities. Have you readabout all the problems associated with those?NO, PLEASE EXPLAIN.Oh, it’s a mess! If you look at the website, Renewable Fuels Association, that has a lot ofinformation about this. The number of ethanol plants have just exploded and lots of thoseare owned by farmers.Purple dots are 139 biorefineries in production. Gold squares are biorefineries underconstruction. Source: Renewable Fuels Association, January 24, 2008.So, if we reverse the current ethanol policy, we’ve got a problem where all these localethanol plants will go broke. But right now, the communities are pushing back because theethanol plants use a lot of water, are drawing down water tables and they are polluting thelocal environment - versus those who benefit from the higher price of corn and subsidizedethanol. Those are the ones pushing the Bush ethanol policies.SO, BUSH'S ETHANOL POLICY IS AN IMPOSSIBLE ADMINISTRATION GOAL,CORRECT?Well, it’s a ridiculous goal! People say that in ten years, we’ll have all this othertechnology up and running. Maybe, but we’ve been working on that for a long time, too.Meanwhile, look at what’s happening to the price of corn.IF THE U. S. KEEPS PUSHING FOR A 15% DOMESTIC GASOLINE REPLACEMENTBY BIOFUELS, THEN WE WOULD CONTINUE TO BE HURTING THE WORLD’SINTERNATIONAL SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN GRAINS AND CORN?Yes, absolutely, in terms of the poor consumers of the world. So let’s import ethanol fromBrazil!AND WHY NOT?Well, why not is a good question. It’s the National Corn Growers Association, Linda. Lookat their website. They don’t want to reduce the tariff with Brazil. If you reduce the ethanoltariff, all the local ethanol plants would go out of business.I grew up on a farm. If I were a corn farmer in Iowa, I’d be real happy right now. It’sAmerican politics. You’ve read about lobby groups and how Congress really works. Thereis no turnover in Congress. Re-election depends upon getting money. How do you getmoney? You give people favors.BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THAT A GOVERNMENT POLICY HAS SAID WE’REGOING TO SET A GOAL OF REPLACING 15% OF DOMESTIC GASOLINE USEWITH BIOFUELS, WHICH INCLUDES ETHANOL AND BIODIESEL. AND THISMEANS THAT THE UNITED STATES IS MAKING A FIRST TIME CHANGE IN HOWIT’S GROWING ITS FOOD AND THAT IS HAVING A DOMINO EFFECT ON THEENTIRE INTERNATIONAL GRAIN AND CORN MARKET.No question. We made a decision to move massive amounts of our farmland into theproduction of fuel. And people were told this will reduce our dependence on foreign oil, itwill help reduce greenhouse gases and so on. All these points, you really have to question.THAT’S WHY YOU WROTE THE LA TIMES OPINION PIECE IN MAY 2007, ‘WHY"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ETHANOL BACKFIRES.’That’s right. Ethanol Future?CAN YOU NOW EXPLAIN YOUR PERSPECTIVE A YEAR LATER ABOUT HOWETHANOL CONTINUES TO BACKFIRE AND WHAT YOU SEE COMING IN THEFUTURE?I hate to say it, but I think we were right. The past year certainly has demonstrated that wewere right when we wrote that article. It continues to backfire because the U. S.government has increased the goal for biofuels by a huge factor this past December 2007(even beyond 15%).THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THIS CURRENT BUSH ADMINISTRATION ISCOMMITTING ALL OF THE CORN ACREAGE OF THE UNITED STATES TOPRODUCING GASOLINE OVER THE NEXT DECADE.Well, they won’t admit that, but it's true. And in the legislation, Linda, there is a limit onhow much can come from corn. But it’s still high!BUT FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW, WE’RE ON A DISASTROUS POLICY PATH.It’s an absurd policy, not unlike a lot of other policies that we observe in Washington, D.C.WHAT COULD WE DO TO CHANGE THE UNITED STATES TO A MORE LOGICALAND SENSIBLE PATH THAT WAS NOT HURTING THE REST OF THE WORLD’SCORN AND GRAIN MARKETS?The first thing is to drop the import tariff on ethanol from Brazil. Allow our Americanindustry to compete.Second, eliminate the subsidy for blending. There’s another 50 cents/gallon subsidy. Ifethanol is a great idea, it should not have to be subsidized.SUBSIDY FOR BLENDING – COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT?As you go to the gas pump these days, most of the fuel you put in your car is blended,right? It’s got maybe 5% ethanol of something else. There’s a tax credit that oil companiesreceive when they blend ethanol with gasoline and I believe it’s 51 to 52 cents/gallon now.WHICH IS REINFORCING THE POLICY SHIFT TO ETHANOL AND THE USE OFCORN ACREAGE FOR CREATING ETHANOL.That’s right. We have mandated a quantity of ethanol that must be used in the country nowand it is 9 billion gallons. So, that’s 3 billion bushels of corn, which is 25% to 30% of theAmerican corn crop.AND THE GOVERNMENT WANTS AT LEAST 35 BILLION GALLONS IN TENYEARS, WHICH WOULD TAKE THE ENTIRE AMERICAN CORN ACREAGE.If it comes only from corn. But presumably in ten more years, we’ll be using otherfeedstocks. Mid-West Drought Could SendGrain Prices “Through the Roof ”FROM APRIL 2008 GOING FORWARD, WHAT DO YOU THINK THE WORST CASEIS IN A YEAR OR 15 MONTHS FROM NOW?Worst case is that we have a major drought in the corn belt and acreage yield suffers 15%.That’s the worst case.WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?I think we pointed out in the LA Times piece that grain prices would go up through the roofif there were a major drought. Or some other catastrophe."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"IF THE U. S. STAYS ON THIS PATH OF ETHANOL, WHICH YOU HAVE DESCRIBEDAS BACKFIRING, WHAT IS THE WORST CASE IF WE DO NOT CHANGE THEPOLICY OF TRYING TO REACH 35 BILLION GALLONS OF ETHANOLREPLACEMENT OF GASOLINE IN TEN YEARS?People start to starve to death. How many deaths will it take before we admit that theethanol policy has backfired? How many people have to starve to death in Africa? If pricescontinue to rise sharply, I would hope there is pressure put on politicians to reverse theethanol policy. But I really don’t know if that will happen or how long the backfiringethanol policy will keep going.”The price of corn has doubled in 2007 to 2008 from $2 to $4 a bushel.Until the recent ethanol boom, more than 60% of the annual U. S. corn harvest was feddomestically to cattle, hogs and chickens or used in food or beverages. But withthe U. S. diversion of corn to ethanol production, even the price of tortillashas jumped rapidly in Mexico.
