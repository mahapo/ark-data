I am Steve Kulls Executive Director ofSquatchdetective.com and Host of Squatchdetective Radio. I am here withBob Schmalzbach, Vice President of Searching for Bigfoot, Inc. I had beeninvited to be a witness of the thawing of the alleged Bigfoot Body by theSearching for Bigfoot team. As an independent researcher, it has beenSquatchdetective.com's goal to obtain proof positive in all cases when eithertrying to substantiate a claim or debunk it, so as there is no question to thematter's certainty. Having worked in the past, with Searching for Bigfoot, Inc.,I understand that it has always been their corporate goal, “to tell it like theysee it, as it happens, and when it happens”. In my organization's limitedinvolvement with Searching For Bigfoot, Inc. it is and has been the goal ofboth organizations to obtain the truth in this and all matters.On July 9th, 2008, Matthew Whitton and Ricky Dyer placed a video onYoutube making the claim they had recovered the body of a Bigfoot body.Their website, Bigfoottracker.com also echoed the sentiment. At that time Ihad doubts and followed the story for two weeks when on July 25th, 2008 Iplaced a video response to challenge them to come on to SquatchdetectiveRadio on July 28th , 2008.On July 14th, 2008 an article was published where Whitton released astatement to his local newspaper, the Clayton Times Daily stating that theyhad recovered the body of a Bigfoot.The afternoon of July 28th, 2008, Ricky Dyer asked if I would call him andafter interviewing him using various forensic interviewing techniques, which Ihave been trained on, I could not get an accurate read on him as I was seeingdeception on numerous things, but insisted he had a body in his possession. Atone point he asked me who Tom Biscardi was. I immediately surmisedhowever their motive was financial.After concluding my one plus hour long phone call with Dyer I called theCEO of Searching for Bigfoot, Tom Biscardi, and we discussed the matter.We, at that time decided it best to turn the investigation over to Mr. Biscardiand his team. My involvement in the remainder of the process was as anindependent observer.The following are my observations and the facts as I understand and knowthem:On August 1st, 2008 Tom Biscardi traveled to Georgia and on August 2nd wasgiven a sample, allegedly, from the corpse, for DNA testing. The DNA washand delivered to Dr. Curt Nelson of Michigan and a chain of custody of thesaid sample was maintained from the time it was received from Ricky Dyerand Matthew Whitton.On August 4th, 2008 both Matthew Whitton and Ricky Dyer entered a legallybinding contract with Searching For Bigfoot, Inc .recognizing the fact thatSearching for Bigfoot, had absolutely nothing to do in the demise or storage ofthe corpse until such time as it was transferred to Searching For Bigfoot forthe benefit of scientific study, marketing and promotion.On August 10th, 2008 Tom Biscardi received an email from Dr. Nelson thatafter the amplifications of two of the three samples, that the size of the DNAwas consistent with human/ape DNA."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"On or about August 12th, 2008, Matthew Whitton and Ricky Dyer requestedan undisclosed sum of money as an advance, expected from the marketingand promotion, and as a good faith gesture of the contract.On August 14th, 2008, after signing a transfer receipt for the amount moneyrequested and counting said money, Matthew Whitton and Ricky Dyer led theSearching for Bigfoot Team to a location and turned over a freezer withsomething appearing large, hairy, and frozen in ice.On August 15th, 2008, Tom Biscardi, Ricky Dyer and Matthew Whitton helda press conference at the Cabana Hotel in Paolo Alto, California, announcingthat the corpse of a creature fitting the description known as “Bigfoot” hadbeen discovered. A police officer of seven years, on medical leave, labeled asa hero for being wounded in the line of duty, got up in front of the world andtold the world of how he and Ricky Dyer uncovered this creature. This hassince been proven a lie. It is notable that Rick Dyer insisted on this pressconference and told Tom Biscardi he would not release the “body” unless theconference was held on this specific date.On August 16th, 2008 the freezer containing the alleged corpse arrived withthe Searching For Bigfoot Team. I arrived on location at 6PM to provide initialverification examination, biohazard control and consult for security measuresat the location. At that time the ice was being thawed slowly without aid, toprevent any decomposition of the alleged corpse. We estimated that thefreezer and its contents weighed over 1500 pounds and it would take severaldays or longer to thaw completely.On August 17th, 2008 Searching for Bigfoot Team Director of FieldOperations, TJ Biscardi and myself, were up early to discover that some hairwas now exposed. I extracted some from the alleged corpse and examined itand had some concerns. Bob Schmalzbach arrived and concurred. We burnedsaid sample and said hair sample melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair.At that time we contacted Mr. Biscardi who gave us permission to begin anexpedited melting process. We set up a salamander heater to heat the freezer.Within one hour we were able to see the partially exposed head, as I was nowable to touch it, I was able to feel that it seemed mostly firm, but unusuallyhollow in one small section. This was yet another ominous sign. Within thenext hour of thaw, a break appeared up near the feet area. As the team and Ibegan examining this area near the feet, I observed the foot which lookedunnatural, reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot.At that point we immediately contacted, Tom Biscardi and advised him of thesituation and he began to take action on his end. Later that day, Tom Biscardiinformed us that both Matthew Whitton and Ricky Dyer admitted it was acostume. They reportedly agreed to sign a promissory note and admission ofwhat they had done, and set a meeting in their hotel room in California for8AM on August 17th, 2008.At that time I drew up the documents for Mr. Biscardi. On August 17th, 2008Tom Biscardi went to the hotel where Dyer and Whitton were staying andfound that they had left. At this time action is being instigated against theperpetrators of this fraud. Tom Biscardi asked us to contact you, the press,and share all that we have discovered.The motives behind this fraud are still unknown at this time. It is still unclearwhy Whitton who, being a police officer for the Clayton County PoliceDepartment in Georgia got up before the world and lied and was complicit in ascheme to defraud in a felonious manner.At this time the victim of this series of deceptions, Searching for Bigfoot, Inc.,is seeking justice for themselves and for all the people who were deceived bythis deception. Due to this event peoples lives have been disrupted and manypeople, so wanting vindication about there prior experiences were hurt. Let usall try to be mindful of such.On behalf of myself I can say with certainty Matthew Whitton and RickyDyer not the best Bigfoot trackers in the world!Thank you.Written by Steve Kulls, Executive Director of Squatchdetective.comand Host of Squatchdetective Radio.

Image courtesy Bigfoot Global LLC. Updated August 19/ August 16, 2008 Palo Alto, California - On Friday, August 15,2008, Tom Biscardi, owner and producer of Searchingforbigfoot.com held a mid-day pressconference at the Cabana Hotel in Palo Alto, California, where Biscardi resides. His pressrelease dated August 12, 2008, stated, “DNA evidence and photo evidence to be presentedthat a Bigfoot body found.”The press release also listed “vital statistics on the Bigfoot body:- The creature is seven feet seven inches tall.- It weighs over 500 pounds.- The creature looks like it is part human and part ape-like.- It is male.- It has reddish hair and blackish-grey eyes.- It has two arms and two legs and five fingers on each hand and five toes oneach foot.- The feet are flat and similar to human feet.- Its footprint is 16 3/4s inches long and 5 3/4s inches wide at the heel."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"- From the palm of the hand to the tip of the middle finger, its hands are 113/4s inches long and 6 1/4 inches wide.- The creatures walk upright. (Several of them were sighted on the same daythat the body was found.)- The teeth are more human-like than ape-like.” Tom Biscardi, center, surrounded by media as he gave out photos of what he saysare both a deceased and a living Bigfoot or Sasquatch during his press conferenceFriday, Aug. 15, 2008, in Palo Alto, Calif. Image © 2008 by Ben Margot/AP.Participating in the press conference with Tom Biscardi were two men who say theydiscovered the dead Bigfoot body: Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer, Georgia residents.Matthew Whitton's employment has included “police officer” and Rick Dyer is describedas a “prison guard” and Bigfoot guide.After the Friday press conference, I talked with Tom Biscardi by phone about the timelineof events and was surprised to learn that he was not contacted by Whitton and Dyer untilThursday, July 31, 2008 - which was 52 days after the body had been rolled into a tarp,winched up into a flatbed truck, hauled back to one of the men's homes and put in a beeffreezer. Later on Friday, Rick Dyer told me their goal was to fill the freezer with water sothe creature would be encased in ice for preservation. But the first freezer failed, thesecond was frost free and wouldn't make ice. Finally, the two men purchased a third beeffreezer so that the Bigfoot creature found on June 10, 2008, is now encased in a block ofice somewhere in northern Georgia.Thus, the photograph at the top of this page was the Bigfoot in the second freezer at theend of June 2008. The pink tissues are intestines spilling out of a hole in the abdomen,cause unknown. Some of the intestinal tissue was gathered and sent to a man named CurtNelson for DNA analysis, but professional credentials are not given. Below is an emailreleased on August 15, 2008, for the press conference. [ Editor's Note: Prof. Curt Nelson islisted as Senior Scientist on the Universityof Minnesota Department of EntomologyDepartment Directory.]"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"DNA report presented at August 15, 2008, press conference in Palo Alto, California,by Tom Biscardi. Tissue sample was from pink intestines erupting from the creature's abdomen.Curt Nelson: ”One of the DNA segments from the tissue sample was 100% human(about 500 base pairs). The other DNA segment was an apparent mix of DNA sequence.However, the DNA sequence interpreted by the sequencing computer algorithmindicates at least a 96% match do Didelphis virginians - a possum.“Tom Biscardi said in the press conference that perhaps the DNA possum confirmation wasfrom the last meal the Bigfoot ate before its death of unknown cause. Biscardi agreed thatmore DNA analysis with a highly credible laboratory needs to be done.Tom Biscardi also held up a photograph encased in plastic showing a close-up of thecreature's head and teeth, which are very even and light in color with no apparent incisors.Another photograph he showed was of a woods in which there is a large, dark-coloredbiped figure in the background. This video frame shows dark figure at center, which Dyer and Whitton claimsto be one of three living Bigfoot or Sasquatch creatures they saw in an undisclosed areaof a northern Georgia forest on June 10, 2008. Image © 2008 by Bigfoot Global LLC.Rick Dyer said he took photographs and videotape of three living Bigfoot creatures thatapproached them as Rick, Matthew Whitton and three more friends were placing the deadBigfoot in a tarp and hauling it to the truck. Those other photographs and videotape havenot been released.Friday night, August 15, 2008, I was able to speak by phone briefly with Rick Dyer about"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"his eyewitness description of what originally happened.Interview:Rick Dyer, Georgia Prison Guard and Co-Discoverer of Alleged Bigfoot, NorthernGeorgia: “It was June 10, 2008, around 4 PM. We were hiking through the woods innorthern Georgia and we stumbled upon the body. The first thing that we saw was the feet.And we went over and looked at the body in shock.We said to each other, ‘We have to get this out of the woods.’ So, Matt stayed behind and Iwent and got a tow truck and three more friends to help us. I brought them back to thewoods, pulled the tow truck on the side the road and we all walked in the woods andwrapped the creature’s body in a tarp and pulled it back to the tow truck. We let the beddown and winched it on and we took off.We went back to the house and put the body in a beef freezer. A couple of days later, thebeef freezer failed. We bought another beef freezer and put it in there. It wouldn’t freeze.It was a frost-free beef freezer. So, we had to go buy another deep freezer and this onefroze the body solid in ice.THE PHOTOGRAPH THAT SHOWS THE CREATURE LAYING IN WHAT APPEARSTO BE DARK WATER, WHEN DID THE ICE THAW? WHAT HAPPENED?That was when the second one failed to freeze.OK, SO THAT PHOTOGRAPH WAS TAKEN BACK IN JUNE 2008?Late June.SO THAT WAS ABOUT TWO WEEKS AFTER YOU FOUND THE BODY – AND WASIT NEAR A CREEK?Correct. It was near a creek between two trees.WAS THERE ANY SIGN OF STRUGGLE ALONG THE CREEK TO INDICATE WHATMIGHT HAVE HAPPENED TO THE CREATURE? WAS IT ATTACKED? DO YOUHAVE ANY SPECULATION?I have no idea. We really didn’t look. To be honest, our main goal was just to get the bodyout of the woods.WHEN YOU WERE TRYING TO GATHER THE BODY UP IN THE TARP, CAN YOUDESCRIBE WHAT YOU FELT WITH YOUR OWN HANDS AND SAW WITH YOUROWN EYES AND SMELLED WITH YOUR NOSE?It smelled like a dead animal. The creature is intimidating to look at – even dead. Also,there were three other live Bigfoots flanking us on each side all the way to the trail. Oncewe hit the trail, they stopped following us.WHEN YOU WERE GATHERING THE BODY UP IN THE TARP, YOU REALIZEDTHAT THERE WERE OTHER BIGFOOT AROUND?Yes. There were three of them ranging from 20 to 50 feet away. They were looking at us.They were not scared of us. At first, we were terrified of them. And then, we knew theywere not going to harm us.I could not tell the sex of the live ones. I took a couple of pictures and live shots. Therewere three creatures and I could not tell if one was male and one was female. And at thatpoint, I didn’t care! (laughs)ARE YOU IN THE PROCESS OF PUTTING THE LARGE, DEAD BODY IN THE TARPWHEN YOU SEE THE OTHER THREE BIGFOOT?Ye s .WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING YOU NOTICED? WERE THEY WALKINGTOWARDS YOU?They were staring at us. They weren’t trying to attack us. We just felt like they weremourning the dead one.IN SADNESS.Exactly."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"WERE THEY STANDING MOTIONLESS?In some of my pictures, they are motionless. In other pictures, they were walking as wewere dragging the body wrapped in the tarp.SO, THE FIVE OF YOU ARE PULLING THE TARP WITH THE LARGE, DEADANIMAL THROUGH THE FOREST TO GO OUT TO THE WINCH. ARE THE OTHERTHREE BIGFOOT DIRECTLY BEHIND YOU? WHERE ARE THEY?They are all around.WALKING IN AN ARC AROUND YOU, A HALF CIRCLE?Basically, yes.WHICH ONE WAS CLOSEST TO YOU?They all looked alike to me. Two of them looked to be the same size and the third onelooked a little smaller. But the largest two got the closest.AND THE CLOSEST WAS ABOUT 20 FEET FROM YOU?Ye s .AT THAT 20 FEET, COULD YOU SEE THE EYES CLEARLY?Ye s .WHAT WERE YOU SEEING?Black eyes.THERE WAS A REPORT THAT THE EYES OF THE DEAD ONE LOOK GREY ANDBLACK?The only reason the eyes of the dead one look grey is because it’s dead.IT ISN’T AS IF IT HAS A GREY IRIS?No. Now, when we first found it back on June 10, it didn’t look that way, but now it does.I’m sure decomposition has been a factor in this because of the way we had to freeze itand it unfroze and we refroze and it unfroze and things like that.WHAT WERE THE EYES LIKE WHEN YOU FIRST FOUND IT ON JUNE 10?Yes, they were open.AS IF WHATEVER HAPPENED, THE CREATURE DIED WITH ITS EYES OPEN?I’m only telling you what I saw. I don’t have any speculation about what happened. Theeyes of the live ones were open and I remember them blinking like humans blink.DID YOU FIND THE DEAD ONE ON ITS BACK OR STOMACH?On the back.YOU COULD SEE THE FEET FIRST?Ye s .WERE THE BOTTOMS AND TOPS OF THE FEET HAIRLESS?The bottom has no hair. The top has hair.WAS THAT THE SAME WITH THE HANDS?The hands don’t have hair at all.DID IT HAVE FINGERNAILS AS WE WOULD RECOGNIZE ON A HUMAN?I didn’t inspect it.THE TEETH IN THE CLOSE-UP OF THE HEAD. THEY WERE SO EVEN ANDWHITE.We released pictures of the head and teeth today at the press conference (August 15,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"2008) and the head, I guess, would be a cone-shaped head.PROTRUDING UPWARD?Ye s .THE MOUTH AND TEETH, DID YOU LOOK AT THEM CLOSELY BEFORE YOUWRAPPED THE CREATURE IN THE TARP?No, because we were trying to do it quickly before it got dark. I didn’t inspect the bodythat good. I still haven’t inspected the body that good.BUT IN THE PHOTOGRAPH, YOU CAN’T SEE ANY INCISOR TEETH. THEY AREVERY EVEN LIKE ANIMALS THAT EAT PLANTS AND NOT MEAT.Correct.AT THE PRESS CONFERENCE, THERE WAS A REFERENCE THAT THE BIGFOOTIS DEFINITELY MALE. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY?He has huge genitals.LIKE A MALE HOMO SAPIENS, ONLY LARGER?Yes, but super larger. I’m not going to measure the creature’s balls! I didn’t see any penis.And everybody saw this and can confirm what I’m saying (Rick Dyer, Matthew Whittonand the three friends who helped haul the heavy creature in the tarp).COULD YOU SEE SEX ORGANS ON ANY OF THE OTHER THREE?No, I could not. I wasn’t paying attention to that. I was trying to get the hell out of there!WHAT DID THE HAIR FEEL LIKE?The hair felt silky smooth. It basically felt like a woman’s hair.”Rick Dyer's account is one of a couple that the Georgia men have presented since June. Inwhat Whitton and Dyer say was a video spoof to get back at their critics, a July 2008 YouTube video had a family relative pretending to be a law officer talking about the Bigfootcreature having been shot by a former felon that Whitton and Dyer then tracked into thewoods to find. Later variations were similar to Dyer's above account in which they found adead male along with a “family of Bigfoot” in north Georgia mountains and are trying toprotect the living creatures while promoting their discovery of a dead one.More Information:For further information about Bigfoot and Sasquatch, please see my book, Glimpses ofOther Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness in the Earthfiles Shop and reports below inEarthfiles Archive:• 10/25/2007 — “Young Sasquatch”?
