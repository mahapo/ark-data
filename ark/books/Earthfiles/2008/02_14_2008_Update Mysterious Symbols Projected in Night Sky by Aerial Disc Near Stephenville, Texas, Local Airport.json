Thereason is that David Caron's 12-minute digital videotape was purchased in an exclusivelicense agreement on January 31, 2008, by Motion Picture Production, Inc., whichproduces UFO Files for The History Channel.Independently and on or about the same date, Glen Rose pilot and businessman, SteveAllen, also paid cash to David Caron for a CD of Caron's 12-minute video. Steve gave mea CD copy in his Glen Rose, Texas, office the afternoon of January 31, 2008, for use atEarthfiles.com. I accepted the CD with the understanding that Steve Allen had paid cashfor the video to David. But Steve did not execute a signed and dated license agreementwith David Caron, so the cash deal was superceded by the Motion Picture Production,Inc.'s signed and dated agreement, a copy of which has now been shown to Earthfiles.com.Here now is a list of the video frames from CD digital videotape originally provided bySteve Allen, Glen Rose, Texas, on January 31, 2008, and now removed from Earthfiles onFebruary 14, 2008, to comply with the exclusive licensing agreement:Digital Image # 1 = Slightly out-of-focus, disc-shaped aerial object, whichcaught David Caron's attention. He used his JVC video camera to tape twelveminutes, beginning at 10:10 PM Central, near the Stephenville Clark FieldMunicipal Airport. He was on the front porch steadying his arm and cameraagainst a post on the porch. You can hear the local road traffic steadilycoming and going throughout the videotape. You also hear David Caron speakperiodically with another person in the house. At one point, the two discussthat the pulsing multi-colored patterns in the sky look like “hieroglyphs.”Digital Image # 2 = Turquoise, white, purple, and green “symbol.”Digital Image # 3 = Cyan, purple, turquoise and white “symbol” surroundedby purple-blue glow.Digital Image # 4 = Orchid, white, turquoise and green “symbol” surroundedby navy blue glow.Digital Image # 5 = Very long, looping “sky snake” segmented in colors ofcyan, white, navy blue, turquoise, pink, orchid, green and fuscia. Nosurrounding glow.February 6, 2008 Stephenville, Texas - On January 31, 2008, I was in Glen Rose, Texas,to interview Steve Allen, Owner, President and CEO of L & S Enterprises and TexasFreight, a trucking and transportation brokerage company in Glen Rose. [ See 020508Earthfiles.] Steve said, “I have an amazing videotape to show you. The gentleman,David, who operated the camera brought a DVD to me at my office, I paid him somemoney and he said I could do whatever I wanted with the videotape. And I want you tohave a copy, Linda.”David began running the camera at 10:10 PM Central, on Saturday, January 19, 2008,while standing on his home porch near the Stephenville Clark Field Municipal Airport onthe east side of town. David braced his arm and camera against a wooden post on theporch. The total videotape runs for nearly 12 minutes. Occasionally David's voice can beheard, so audio was functioning. But David told Steve Allen he could not hear any sound"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"from the original disc that suddenly began projecting the colorful symbols that pulsed twoper second, changing every 15 video frames. Thirty video frames equals one second.The following is a sequence of images in order soon after the disc “turned into” the pulsingsymbols. I looked through files of symbols drawn by people in the human abductionsyndrome. I found some similarities to the Stephenville aerial symbols and will hope to dosome comparisons with colored pencil sketches of the symbols in the future. If anyEarthfiles viewer has information about these symbols, please email me at:earthfiles@earthfiles.com. Video frames removed from this section:22 individual frames of David Caron's digital videotape, excerpted approximately in thesequence in which they appear in the video. Goal is to compare with symbols drawn bypeople in the human abduction syndrome. All the Stephenville aerial symbols aresegmented in a variety of colors as described above and which can be seen in this newFebruary 9, 2008, still digital photograph taken by the wife of Dublin Constable, Lee RoyGaitan, between 10:30 and 11 PM Central in the Dublin, Texas area. February 9, 2008 - More Sky SymbolsOver Dublin, Texas (Also see 021408 Earthfiles.)At the center of many of the local Dublin and Stephenville, Texas, UFO investigationssince early January 2008, is 43-year-old Lee Roy Gaitan, the Erath County Constable inPrecinct 2, Dublin. Lee Roy has been Constable about four years and a police officer forseventeen years.Not only is he investigating, he and his son were eyewitnesses themselves to remarkableaerial lights on January 8, 2008. Then on February 2, 2008, between 2:50 and 4:00 AMCentral, Lee Roy videotaped a disc-like object that looked like a “spinning sun or Jupiterplanet throwing off colored strobe lights. What was so odd about it was when I zoomed in,it looked like a triangle or pyramid inside of the spinning disc.” That videotape has still notbeen released to the public.A week later on February 9, Constable Gaitan saw the same spinning aerial object againand his wife, Wendy, photographed with a digital still camera more pulsing lights in thesky. The aerial events started when Lee Roy received a call around 10:30 PM from aresident looking through a telescope between Dublin and Stephenville. Colors by segments in “symbol” projected in Dublin, Texas sky, between 10:30 PMand 11:00 PM, on February 9, 2008.
