This image was acquired by NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander's Surface Stereo Imageron Sol 43, the 43rd Martian day after landing on July 8, 2008. Two samples were deliveredto the Wet Chemistry Laboratory, which is part of Phoenix's Microscopy, Electrochemistry, andConductivity Analyzer (MECA). The first sample w as taken from the surface area just left of thetrench and informally named “Rosy Red” It was delivered to the Wet Chemistry Laboratoryon Sol 30 (June 25, 2008). The second sample, informally named “Sorceress” was takenfrom the center of the Snow White trench and delivered to the Wet Chemistry Laboratoryon Sol 41 (July 6, 2008).

August 5, 2008 Pasadena, California - Responding to the growing buzz on the internetabout suppressed Mars Phoenix Lander data and the White House Science Adviser beingbriefed on a new and potentially disturbing discovery in the lander's soil analysis, todayPhoenix mission scientists spoke and answered questions in an hour phone conferenceproduced by NASA and JPL.The first person to speak was a NASA public affairs officer who denied there had been anyconsultation with the White House science advisor. However, a reporter from theDiscovery Channel argued that she heard from a reputable aerospace reporter that such abriefing was held. Other reporters were confused about the implications of the perchloratediscovery by the wet chemistry team and wanted to know if the highly oxidatingperchlorate, most commonly used on Earth in rocket fuels and explosives, would mean nolife possibilities on the red, dry, cold, desert planet. NASA describes perchlorate as “anion, or charged particle, that consists of an atom of chlorine surrounded by four oxygen"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"atoms. It is an oxidant that releases oxygen, but it is not a powerful one.” Perchlorate isalso highly soluble in water.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Perchlorates are the salts derived fromperchloric acid (HClO4). They occur both naturally and throughmanufacturing. They have been used as a medicine for more than 50 years totreat thyroid gland disorders. They are also used as an oxidizer in rocket fueland explosives and can be found in airbags and fireworks. Both potassiumperchlorate (KClO4) and ammonium perchlorate (NH4ClO4) are usedextensively within the pyrotechnics industry, whereas ammonium perchlorateis a component of solid rocket fuel. Lithium perchlorate, which decomposesexothermically to give oxygen, is used in oxygen ‘candles’ on spacecraft,submarines and in other esoteric situations where a reliable backup orsupplementary oxygen supply is needed. Most perchlorate salts are soluble inwater.”]Bottom line: the Phoenix Lander science team is surprised by the perchlorate discoveryand are not really certain what it means. Is the perchlorate only a local phenomenon rightat the spot where the Phoenix Lander is using its robotic arm to dig 2-inch-deep trenchesbecause water ice prevents the arm from digging deeper? That means the perchlorate is asurface phenomenon. But how extensive might the perchlorate be on Mars? Is iteverywhere on the oxidized red surface? How deep has it gone?On Earth, a comparable geography with perchlorate in its surface soils is the Atacamadesert in northern Chile. There isn't much organic life, but microbes have been found thatcan eat perchlorate or co-exist with perchlorate.The Atacama Desert is a virtually rainless plateau in northern Chile, stretching 600 milesalong the Pacific coast of South America, west of the Andes mountains. The rain shadow on theleeward side of the Andes keeps this over 20 million-year-old desert fifty times drier than California'sDeath Valley. It is the second-driest desert in the world, after the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctic.The soil is mostly salt basins that have surface perchlorate salts and nitrates,sand, and lava flows. Image by Wikipedia.During the phone press conference, Michael Hecht of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratoryin Pasadena, said: “Finding perchlorates is neither good nor bad for life, but it does makeus reassess how we think about life on Mars.” Hecht is the lead scientist for theMicroscopy, Electrochemistry and Conductivity Analyzer (MECA), the instrument thatincludes the wet chemistry laboratory.NASA's press release after the press conference quoted Michael Hecht further as saying:“If confirmed, the result is exciting because different types of perchlorate salts haveinteresting properties that may bear on the way things work on Mars if - and that's a big ‘if’ - the results from our two teaspoons of soil are representative of all of Mars, or at least asignificant portion of the planet.”NASA said the Phoenix team had wanted to check the finding with another landerinstrument, the Thermal and Evolved-Gas Analyzer (TEGA), which heats soil andanalyzes gases driven off. But as that TEGA experiment was underway last week,speculative news reports surfaced claiming the team was holding back a major findingregarding habitability on Mars. Scientists are still examining multiple hypotheses, givenevidence that the soil contains perchlorate.Phoenix Lander Principal Investigator Peter Smith of the University of Arizona, Tucson,said: “We decided to show the public science in action because of the extreme interest inthe Phoenix mission, which is searching for a habitable environment on the northern plains"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"of Mars. Right now, we don't know whether finding perchlorate is good news or bad newsfor possible life on Mars.”Perchlorate was discovered with a multi-use sensor that detects perchlorate, nitrate andother ions. The MECA team saw the perchlorate signal in a sample taken from theDodo-Goldilocks trench on June 25, or Sol 30, or the 30th Martian day of the mission afterlanding, and again in another sample taken from the Snow White trench on July 6, or Sol41.When TEGA heated a sample of soil dug from the Dodo-Goldilocks trench on Sol 25 tohigh temperature, it detected an oxygen release, said TEGA lead scientist William Boyntonof the University of Arizona. Perchlorate could be one of several possible sources of thisoxygen, he said.Late last week, when TEGA analyzed another sample, this one from the Snow Whitetrench, the TEGA team looked for chlorine gas. The instrument detected none.“Had we seen it, the identification of perchlorate would be absolutely clear, but in this runwe did not see any chlorine gas. We may have been analyzing a perchlorate salt thatdoesn't release chlorine gas upon heating,” Boynton said. “There's nothing in the TEGAdata that contradicts MECA's finding of perchlorates.”As the Phoenix team continues its investigation of the arctic soil, the TEGA instrumentwill attempt to validate the perchlorate discovery and determine its concentration andproperties.More Information:For further information about Mars explorations, please see reports below in EarthfilesArchive:• 05/29/2008 — Phoenix Robotic Arm Preparing to Dig Into Martian Permafrost• 05/06/2008 — Viewer Comments on Decatur, Alabama, White Sphere Incident• 05/06/2008 — What Are the Strange “Pearls” in Google Map Images?• 05/02/2008 — 3-Foot-Diameter Sphere Retrieved By Ambulance in Decatur, Alabama• 03/28/2008 — Carancas, Peru, Meteorite in September 2007 - “Unprecedented?”• 03/28/2008 — Earth-Size Planet Beyond Pluto and Kuiper Belt?• 03/27/2008 — Ice Block Size of Northern Ireland Has Broken From Wilkins Ice Shelf inWest Antarctic Peninsula• 01/12/2008 — Our Milky Way Galaxy On Collision Course with Huge Gas Cloud - 40Million Years from Now• 01/10/2008 — Solar Cycle 24 Has Begun• 12/07/2007 — Part 2: Secret American Military Space Program?• 11/01/2007 — Gas Eruptions from Comet Holmes?• 10/18/2007 — A Quantum Math Description of Parallel Universes• 10/11/2007 — Carancas, Peru Meteorite Could Be 10 Tons• 10/05/2007 — Earlier, Faster and Deeper Arctic Ice Melt Down• 09/26/2007 — Meteorite Fell in Carancas, Peru - Not Satellite• 09/20/2007 — Part 2: Psi Spies - True Story of America's Psychic Warfare Program• 09/14/2007 — Part 1: Psi Spies - True Story of America's Psychic Warfare Program• 09/05/2007 — Part 2: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 08/10/2007 — Levitation Possible by Reversing Casimir Force• 08/03/2007 — The Milky Way Is Devouring the Alien Sagittarius Dwarf Galaxy• 05/08/2007 — Exploded Star 5 Times Brighter Than Any Supernova Seen Before• 03/30/2007 — Fastest Orbiting Object in Our Solar System is One of Strangest• 12/31/2006 — Part 8: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 12/27/2006 — Part 7: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 12/19/2006 — First Stars - Or First Black Holes - in Universe?• 12/18/2006 — Part 6: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue• 12/08/2006 — NASA Wants Permanent Moon Base by 2024• 12/01/2006 — Deep Impact and Stardust: Are Comets Made of the Same Stuff?• 09/04/2006 — Part 1: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 08/23/2006 — Solar Cycle 24 - Headed for Intense X Flares by 2010-2012?• 06/24/2006 — \"High Confidence\" Earth Is Warmest in 400 Years - Maybe Even 2,000 Years• 06/07/2006 — Gary McKinnon: An Electronic \"Robin Hood\"?• 04/11/2006 — Hot Venus Now Studied by ESA's Venus Express• 02/27/2006 — Part 4: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs• 12/24/2005 — Part 3 - Peculiar Phenomenon: Early United States Efforts to Collect andAnalyze Flying Discs• 12/23/2005 — Hubble Telescope Discovers More Moons and Rings Around Uranus• 12/16/2005 — MARSIS Radar Looking Below Surface of Mars• 11/18/2005 — Is the Sun Heating Up?• 11/09/2005 — Dust Storm On Mars, Cosmic First Light and Black Hole At Our Galaxy'sCenter• 08/24/2005 — Dust Devils and \"Lemon Rinds\" on Mars• 08/12/2005 — Deep Impact Spectra: Carbonate, PAHs and Some Amino Precursors inCo me t Te mp e l I• 07/23/2005 — Mystery of Six Grass Circle Formations in North Carolina• 07/10/2005 — First Data from Deep Impact Crash Into Comet Tempel I• 06/23/2005 — Mars Express Orbiter Finally Turns On Deep Ground-Penetrating Radar• 03/25/2005 — Glow of Distant Worlds Seen For First Time"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"• 03/20/2005 — Astronaut John Young: \"The Moon Can Save Earth's Civilization.\"• 03/04/2005 — Subterranean Life On Earth - and Mars?• 02/26/2005 — Mars Spirit Rover Discovered Boundary Between Gusev Lava and Older,Water-Soaked Rocks in \"Columbia Hills\"• 02/22/2005 — Frozen Sea Near Martian Equator Size of Lake Michigan• 12/17/2004 — Is Our Solar System's Red, Mysterious Sedna An Alien Planetoid?• 11/17/2004 — European Space Agency's SMART-1 Satellite Begins Moon Orbit• 11/03/2004 — Gen.
