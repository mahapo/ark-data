April 30, 2008 Pasadena, California - NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory Cassini-Huygens Saturn Mission based in Pasadena reports this week that the Radio and PlasmaWave (RPWS) experiment on Cassini has monitored the longest-lived continuously activeelectrical storm ever observed on Saturn, a storm that resides in a band around Saturn'ssouthern hemisphere called “Storm Alley” because it has so many electrical storms."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"NASA's Cassini spacecraft tracks pow erful, months-long, electrical stormraging on Saturn with lightning bolts 10,000 times more powerful than those foundon Earth.

This has been, sofar, a five-month campaign of continuous observations in which amateurastronomers around the world have played a vital role, and beautifullyillustrates what can be accomplished when observations from Earth andorbiting spacecraft are joined together.Scientists with NASA's Cassini-Huygens mission have been tracking thevisibly bright, lightning-generating storm--the longest continually observedelectrical storm ever monitored by Cassini. Saturn's electrical storms resembleterrestrial thunderstorms, but on a much larger scale. Storms on Saturn havediameters of several thousand kilometers (thousands of miles), and radiosignals produced by their lightning are thousands of times more powerful thanthose produced by terrestrial thunderstorms.Lightning flashes within the persistent storm produce radio waves calledSaturn electrostatic discharges, which the radio and plasma wave scienceinstrument first detected on Nov. 27, 2007. Cassini's imaging camerasmonitored the position and appearance of the storm, first spotting it about aweek later, on Dec. 6. This electrical storm is similar in appearance andintensity to those previously monitored by Cassini. All of these powerfulelectrostatic-producing storms appeared at about 35 degrees south latitude onSa turn.“The electrostatic radio outbursts have waxed and waned in intensity for fivemonths now,” said George Fischer, an associate with the Radio and PlasmaWave science team at the University of Iowa, Iowa City. “We saw similarstorms in 2004 and 2006 that each lasted for nearly a month, but this storm islonger-lived by far. And it appeared after nearly two years during which wedid not detect any electrical storm activity from Saturn.”“In order to see the storm, the imaging cameras have to be looking at the rightplace at the right time, and whenever our cameras see the storm, the radiooutbursts are there,” said Ulyana Dyudina, an associate of the Cassini imagingteam at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California.Cassini's radio plasma wave instrument detects the storm every time it rotatesinto view, which happens every 10 hours and 40 minutes, the approximate"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"length of a Saturn day. Every few seconds, the storm gives off a radio pulselasting for about a tenth of a second, which is typical of lightning bolts andother electrical discharges. These radio waves are detected even when thestorm is over the horizon as viewed from Cassini, a result of the bending ofradio waves by the planet's atmosphere.Amateur astronomers have kept track of the storm over its five-monthlifetime. “Since Cassini's camera cannot track the storm every day, theamateur data are invaluable,” said Fischer. “I am in continuous contact withastronomers from around the world.”The long-lived storm will likely provide information on the processespowering Saturn's intense lightning activity. Cassini scientists will continue tomonitor Storm Alley as the seasons change, bringing the onset of autumn tothe planet’s southern hemisphere.”Click here to listen to a 2006 Saturn storm.The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European SpaceAgency and the Italian Space Agency. JPL, a division of Caltech, manages the Cassinimission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. The Cassini orbiterand its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imagingteam is based at the Space Science Institute, Boulder, Colorado.
