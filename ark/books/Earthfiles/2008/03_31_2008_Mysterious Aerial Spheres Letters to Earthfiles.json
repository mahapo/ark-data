A fewnights before the mutilated deer was found by a retired broadcast engineer, he also saw aglowing, white sphere about 6 feet in diameter moving in the night sky between twomilitary helicopters. [ See 032808 Earthfiles Real X-File.] On the air, I asked listeners toemail me who might have had their own glowing sphere encounters or have currentknowledge about American military interaction with glowing spheres. I have receiveddozens of emails and share a few in this Earthfiles report for consideration and othercomment.1) Subject: SpheresDate: March 28, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“Enjoyed you on Coast to Coast as always this morning. I listen to it while Iwork. You sent out a request for any information regarding \"spheres,\" basedupon the two reports you spoke of on the radio. I'm not totally sure howrelevant this is, but here's what I know.Brief background: I work in Hollywood special effects and in the artdepartment for a lot of bigger films. I cannot go into much more detail aboutthis film (I have currently been working on), due to confidentiality agreementswith the studio, but I think releasing a small scene that won't be producedwould be okay.We started work about seven months ago on a big budget film in the wholeE.T., UFO kind of realm. The initial design involved spherical craft ranging insize from golf balls ( radio drones ) to 10-feet-diameter ( manned drones ), tobattleship size (invasion craft), and ultimately a spherical craft the size of themoon. In the film, the craft color depended on \"alert status,\" red beingfull-red-alert and so on. There were several colors, such as neutral was white.The idea for these spherical craft came from the SFX coordinator, who had anacquaintance who had allegedly seen one (glowing sphere).One scene in particular involved a spherical craft being escorted, andultimately fought off by, two military helicopters. Support from the USAF wasasked for and the Air Force approved the use of their planes, helicopters, andother things for the film - until the Air Force read that particular scene withthe spherical the craft. The USAF first asked the scene be changed and thesphere eliminated. If the scene wasn't changed and the spherical crafteliminated, the USAF would withdraw their support. Basically, that's the samething we went through on Independence Day, too, when Area 51 wasreferenced in that script.Being on the creative team, we assumed at first that the military was asking todrop the sphere was the fact the true threat came from the military - that theywere on the offensive, not defensive. But in some specific memos, thespherical craft was specified in several sentences. No more detail was addedother than that. Ultimately, the U.S. military support was totally withdrawn."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The film today stands in limbo due to the writer's strike. It is one film that hasnever fully recovered as of yet. I've not heard here nor there on productionstatus, but when I heard you talk about multi-colored spherical craft beingaround military aircraft/helicopters, it hit home and I thought you might find itinteresting to hear a bit about the feature film and what happened with theUSAF.” 2) Subject: Sphere in Albuquerque 1994Date: March 28, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“I heard you on Coast to Coast Thursday 03-27-2008.In that show you mentioned glowing spheres and asked for any comment.Back in the early 1990's, I believe 1994, I saw one.A group of Russian scientists were detained by the authorities and were beinghoused at the hotel where I worked as a cook next to the Albuquerque Airportand Kirtland Air Force Base. When they were there, I was on my way to workat 3 p.m. in the afternoon. At the intersection of Gibson and Yale, there was amilitary helicopter in the air facing west. Beside that helicopter on its left side,there was a glowing sphere floating in the air. It had a translucent glow thatseemed to change colors. It was about the size of a basketball.I thought it was very strange that such a display would be made over such abusy intersection in broad daylight. I don't know whose benefit they wereputting on this show for, but I enjoyed it. I later posted my comments aboutthe sighting on one of AOL's UFO forums. One member there thought that thesphere was a flare. But I doubt that, because of the time and location, as wellas the presence of the Russian scientists.” 3) Subject: Spheres and HelicoptersDate: March 28, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“When I heard you on Coast to Coast on 3-27-08 mentioning the helicoptersand spheres, I thought I should tell you what I saw. I was on the Californiabeach just 1/2 mile north of the San Onofre Nuclear Generation Station about5 years ago where much of Camp Pendleton helicopter maneuvers take place.In the day, which was a bit foggy, a military copter flew approximately 100feet above the water, about 20 yards from the shore, traveling north slowly.There was an unmistakable green, glowing, orb illumination about 30 feet infront of the copter. The green sphere was about 6 feet in diameter and movingat the same speed as the copter. The color of the light was like the glowinggreen color of a glow stick. I assumed it was a laser of some sort for training? Iwanted to let you know.” 4) Subject: Glowing OrbDate: March 29, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“The sphere was in one spot then in another and you don't seethe movement in between locations.”“Hello, Linda, Always enjoy your spots on Coast to Coast. Last night/morningyour asked for information about glowing or illuminated orbs that I guessmany people are seeing recently, or have seen in the past.I live right next to 29 Palms Marine Base, which you probably know is locatedadjacent to Ft. Irwin (Army), China Lake (Naval Weapons) and Edwards AirForce Base in the Mojave Desert of California. Strange lights in the sky arerather commonplace around here and I have seen a 6 to 7-foot-diameter orbon two different occasions. Both times, I believe they were Marine quiethelicopters, which appeared to be trying to corral a glowing sphere orinfluence its direction of travel. Both times it was self-illuminated in abeautiful sunset orange color and both times it was around 3 a.m.My first sighting was on December 19, 2007 at 3:10 a.m. The second wasaround the exact same time last February 11, 2008. The “orange tennis balls,”"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"as people around here call them, are only a part of the unusual night timefestivities locally. People have really become complacent about everything aslong as they don't feel threatened.The latest buzz is of some large, flying craft that makes only a slight“swooshing” sound as it passes overhead at about 1000 ft. If there's a moon, itcasts a huge shadow on the ground. Everyone attributes this to Edwards AirForce base, which is about 50 miles away in a straight line.The vast number of contrails here aren't even mentioned anymore. There'snothing but open sky and empty government desert from here to Las Vegas.Only a relatively small portion of that desert is open to the public but it's fartoo much to patrol.When I mentioned my sightings to other locals and their reaction was anon-excited, “Oh, that thing. Word has it that it is a new type of antenna forground-to-ground and ground-to-air communications for the troops. They'reprobably all over Iraq by now.”Well, I'm relatively new here and not so ready to dismiss such a thing soeasily. What conflicts with this explanation the most, to me, is the way itmoved in the sky. The best description I can offer is the same as many peoplehave observed in other UFOs. The sphere was in one spot then in another andyou don't see the movement in between locations.The Marines have much interaction with the community here and theirexplanations for things are taken without too much questioning. But Icertainly don't believe this is an antenna. Whatever it is, the orange color itemits is quite beautiful and captivating. I'll be ready for it next time and try tomake more astute observations and perhaps a digital photo.” 5) February 7, 2007, Early Evening, Peyton, ColoradoEyewitness reported to National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC) that hehad seen “a helicopter about 500-1000 feet up, following a tiny point of light.The light looked to be about 500 feet in front of the helicopter They seemedto move at the same speed and altitude. The light seemed to be about the sizeof one of the helicopter's lights, but was not flashing and was a strange pinkcolor, not an even color all over.” The same eyewitness also said he had seena similar pink point of light “on or about January 6, 2007, but there were noother aircraft in the sky.”After my March 27, 2008, Coast to Coast AM radio broadcast, the Coloradoeyewitness emailed me about his February 7, 2007, sighting and added:“What I found odd was that two days later, in Elbert County, Colorado, at thefeed store in Kiowa, I heard a rancher found one of his cows mutilated. I paidclose attention to the conversation because I have cattle also. (His mutilation)was on or about the day I saw the (pink light) object that the cow was thoughtto have been killed. I didn't report the cow because I didn't put them togetheruntil listening to you tonight (on Coast).”If any Earthfiles viewer has had their own aerial glowing sphere encounter or hasinformation about the military's interaction with glowing spheres, please email me:earthfiles@earthfiles.comMore Information:For further information about aerial spheres and other unidentified aerial craft(UACs/UFOs), please see my four books and two documentaries listed in the EarthfilesShop, plus related Earthfiles reports below in the Earthfiles Archive:• 03/30/2008 — Part 8 - Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/20/2008 — Part 7 - Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/15/2008 — Part 6 - Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/08/2008 — Part 5: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/04/2008 — Part 4: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/03/2008 — Updated Part 1: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/02/2008 — Part 2: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 03/02/2008 — Part 3: Real X-File, Source Unknown• 02/22/2008 — Updated: Three Eyewitnesses in Selden, Texas, Saw Two, Large Rectanglesof “White Flames” in Sky"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"• 01/15/2008 — Updated: More Sky Spiral Mysteries in Iraq, Canada and Germany• 01/11/2008 — Canadian \"Disc\" and Smoke Spiral Still A Mystery• 12/11/2007 — More Confirmation of May 1974 Discs in Albuquerque and Huge CylinderCraft At White Sands Provi ng Ground.• 12/08/2007 — Another Eyewitness to Glowing Disc and Military Security in Albuquerque,New Mexico• 11/29/2007 — Part 1: Glowing Disc Encounter with Military in Albuquerque, NM• 11/29/2007 — Part 2: Glowing Disc Encounter with Military in Albuquerque, NM• 11/29/2007 — Part 3: Glowing Disc Encounter with Military in Albuquerque, NM• 08/24/2007 — Orange-Red \"Fiery\" Aerial Spheres• 07/28/2007 — Mysterious Aerial Lights Over Stratford-upon-Avon, July 14, andFarnborough, Hampshire, on July 22, 2007• 07/14/2007 — Schofield Barracks, Oahu, Hawaii - Huge, Lime Green Oval Craft HoveredOver Battalion Headquarters• 03/16/2007 — Tenth Anniversary of March 1997 Phoenix Lights: What Was the 2-Mile-LongTriangular Craft?• 01/02/2007 — Grey Aerial Disk Reported by Chicago O'Hare United Airlines Pilots andMechanics• 10/14/2006 — Big Sorghum Circle in Beloit, Kansas• 09/05/2006 — Part 2: \"Alphonso Lorenzo\" - Military Visitor to Another Planet?• 07/01/2006 — Cattle Mutilation and Glowing Discs in Saskatchewan, Canada• 02/27/2006 — Part 4: Military Voices Reply About Government Interaction with UFOs• 12/21/2005 — Updated: Part 2 - Peculiar Phenomenon, Early United States Efforts to Collectand Analyze Flying Discs• 12/02/2005 — Abduction by Grey ETs in Huge, Black Triangle• 11/10/2005 — Part 1: An Alleged 1953 UFO Crash and Burial Near Garrison, Utah• 09/21/2005 — Silent, Unidentified Aerial Triangle Entered Thunderstorm Over Fairborn,Ohio• 07/01/2005 — U.
