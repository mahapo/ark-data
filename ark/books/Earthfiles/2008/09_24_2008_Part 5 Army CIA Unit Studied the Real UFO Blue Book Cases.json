We had 26 people to start within that CIA Project Blue Book and I was the only one that survived andgot out because my boss helped me with the phony body cover.”- “Stein,” Former Army/CIA UFO Analyst Return to Part 1September 24, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - The following transcript is from thethird taped interview I did by phone with Stein a day after I played excerpts from theprevious two recordings with Stein's permission on Dreamland hosted by Art Bell. SinceStein had been warned that his or my or both of our phones were tapped, I called to checkabout any repercussions from the radio program. He said no one had called him at thatpoint. I also asked him if he could send me copies of his Army Signal Corps dischargerecords from 1956 to 1960. Phone Interview # 3June 1, 1998Stein: “Naturally anything having to do with my classified CIA work, I didn’t haveanything on that. It stayed right in the file. My files were actually lost because I was toldmy records were burned up in the St. Louis (military record archives) fire. I had a medicalproblem with my teeth related to a previous military accident in a jeep and I was trying toget my military records. But they could not find any of my records and said they weredestroyed in the St. Louis fire.[ Editor’ Note: From the National Archives, “The 1973 Fire at the NationalPersonnel Records Center in St. Louis, Missouri: On July 12, 1973, adisastrous fire at NPRC (MPR) destroyed approximately 16-18 millionOfficial Military Personnel Files. The affected record collections are describedbelow.”BranchPersonnel and Period AffectedEstimatedLossArmyPersonnel discharged November 1, 1912, to January 1,196080%AirForcePersonnel discharged, September 25, 1947, to January 1,1964(with names alphabetically after Hubbard, James E.)75%“No duplicate copies of the records that were destroyed in the fire weremaintained, nor was a microfilm copy ever produced. There were no indexescreated prior to the fire. In addition, millions of documents had been lent tothe Department of Veterans Affairs before the fire occurred. Therefore, acomplete listing of the records that were lost is not available.” ] Stein: “The only thing that I have is just my discharge, which was dropped back from anofficer to an SP4 or Sergeant or something like that and hid my identity in the CIA work."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"DID YOUR DISCHARGE USE YOUR CURRENT REAL CIVILIAN NAME?Yes. That was my regular military discharge. I didn’t get anything from the CIA after I hadbeen discharged and was no longer working in that department. There probably is a filesomewhere about me with the other false cover name I used in the CIA. That might nothave been destroyed in the fire, but I’m sure there is no way for me to get my CIA records.DO YOU HAVE ANY PHOTOS OR NEWSPAPERS FROM THAT 1956 TO 1960PERIOD?Once, I did have, but we had a fire, too, in one of our homes and I lost most of the things Idid have. The only thing I have are news clippings when I first went into military servicebasic training from the local newspaper. [Later, I saw those clippings at his home.]DID YOU EVER FIND OUT WHAT AGENCY THE NOTORIOUS MEN IN BLACK(MIBS) COME FROM?Well, I'm not completely certain, but I know the FBI did interview some people aboutcertain cases. And have you ever heard of Wackenhut Corporation? A long-time friend ofmine has worked in the telephone company here for years (Fort Myers, Florida) and I didhave him check to see where that recent warning phone call to me came from.WHERE DID IT COME FROM?It came from the Wackenhut Corporation. [ Editor's Note: The Wackenhut Corporation is aUnited States-based private security and investigation firm headquartered in Palm BeachGardens, Florida. Wackenhut was founded in 1954, in Coral Gables, Florida, by GeorgeWackenhut and three partners, all former FBI agents.]IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WACKENHUT ALSO DOES SECURITY WORKFOR THE NATIONAL RECONNAISSANCE OFFICE (NRO).Yes, well, Wackenhut has worked for the CIA for a number of years. And you know, theFBI had files on individuals and organizations and apparently Wackenhut picked up wherethe FBI left off and is now working for the CIA, FBI, and other organizations that try toget information about certain people.I think I know the reason why I was warned. I talked to a friend of mine who was also inthe U. S. Army Signal Corps at that sensitive southeastern military base. He guessed thatCIA powers at the base don’t want you, Linda, mentioning the name of that military postbecause they are still using the classified area we always had for the CIA for classifiedmilitary equipment and activities.WAS YOUR PHONE COMPANY FRIEND ABLE TO TELL IF IT WAS YOUR PHONETHAT WAS TAPPED?Yes, he checked mine and it was definitely not tapped.SO IT’S MY PHONE.Ye s .AT LEAST WE ARE GOING FORWARD AND I AM COMPLYING WITH THEPHONE CALLER’S REQUEST THAT I NOT USE THE NAME OR LOCATION OFTHAT SOUTHEASTERN MILITARY BASE. More Details About 1958 Visitto Area 51 Groom LakeWHAT DETAILS DO YOU REMEMBER ABOUT THE SIX DISC CRAFT THAT YOU,YOUR BOSS AND THE THREE OTHER MEN SAW AT AREA 51 GROOM LAKE IN1958?They were all saucer-shaped craft. Some were very small. Some were quite large. The Col.Jim did say the small ones were Vril craft from the Vril Society in Germany dating back tothe 1920s. Some of the bigger ones – I asked if they were German. Col. Jim said some ofthem were extraterrestrial and two of the big ones in the back are German UFOs from the1930s.DID YOU ASK IF THE GERMANS MADE THEM? OR WERE THEYEXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT THAT HAD SOME HOW BEEN ADAPTED FOR THE"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"GERMANS TO USE?The Germans built the Vrils, but I understand that the Vril Society was in contact withextraterrestrials from 1917 onward. So, maybe the Germans were making the discs underthe direction of, or with the help of, the extraterrestrials.BACK IN 1958 WHEN YOU WERE AT AREA 51 GROOM LAKE AND YOU WERETAKEN WITH YOUR BOSS AND THREE OTHER MEN TO THE ENCLOSURE, WASIT INSIDE A MOUNTAIN? OR UNDERGROUND?Part of it was inside a mountain (Papoose Mountain?) and part of it was not. But it wasfurther beyond the special area where they had the TOP SECRET United States aircraftthere. We went to like the third area where there is a landing strip that you land on in anormal USAF installation. Then you go about ten miles further and you find another littleairstrip with its own hangars. Then you go further about another eight miles and you havethe highly classified installation there with the UFOs in it and that's partly inside amountain.DID YOU GO THROUGH DOORS INTO A MOUNTAIN? DID YOU GOUNDERGROUND TO SEE THE CRAFT AND NON-HUMAN ENTITY?The disc craft were in a major building along side the mountain and there were drivewayand walkway areas that went right into the mountain. Inside the mountain were like carvedout caves where they had like hangars. The alien being we looked at, he was out in themain office building part of that third complex.WHEN YOU WENT INSIDE THE MOUNTAIN HANGARS, HOW MANY CRAFT DIDYOU PERSONALLY SEE WITH YOUR OWN EYES?It was like six or seven. Some were more distant where I was looking over foregroundvehicles and I could only see the top of craft in the distance. I did ask Col. Jim about themand that’s the answer he gave me about what the little ones and big ones were.CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE SHAPE, COLOR AND SO FORTH?Most of them were a silver color. The small Vril craft were silver. The other ones were likelight grey and a couple of big ones were a dark grey, or light black (charcoal).IN DIAMETER, WHAT WERE THE BIGGEST?I’d say 60 feet in diameter.WHAT WAS THE DIAMETER OF THE SMALLER CRAFT?Probably about 18 to 20 feet.WERE THEY ON ANY PLATFORMS?Some were sitting on like saw horses, but the supports were metal and heavier than awooden saw horse. One of the big craft did have a gun-type thing below it and I was told itwas what the Germans called ‘the death ray.’ Some kind of ray gun.IN TERMS OF THE METAL SAW HORSES THAT PROPPED UP THE CRAFT, WEREEACH OF THE CRAFT DISC-SHAPED? OR WERE THERE DIFFERENT SHAPES?The craft we saw at Groom Lake were all basically disc-shaped. Some had a bottom areato them or a round top area that stood up above the disc. That varied. But basically youwould have to say they were all disc-shaped.DID ANYONE DESCRIBE TRIANGLE OR WEDGE SHAPES? OR U-CURVED LIKETHE HEEL OF A SHOE?No.WERE YOU ALLOWED TO GO CLOSER TO TOUCH ANY OF THE DISCS?No, we just saw them from a doorway and walkway where we were passing by the areaand back to the front side. We never got to touch them.WHAT DID YOUR BOSS SAY ABOUT THE HALF DOZEN DISCS?He said, ‘This is such a surprise. How could Germany be that advanced back in the 1920sand 1930s?’ He was shocked at that. I believe the two big ones were German and the twosmaller ones were German Vrils and there were a couple of medium-sized craft withdifferent tops and bottoms that Col. Jim said were literally extraterrestrial."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"WAS ANY PART THAT YOU WERE LOOKING AT DESIGNATED ASSPECIFICALLY FROM THE CRAFT THAT THE 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS WERETAKEN FROM? OR THE SMALL, SPINDLY GREYS?No, there was no comment about which craft belonged to which beings.YOUR BOSS DID NOT ASK?No, he did not. Neither of us did. We thought of so many questions when we left that weshould have asked, but when you see something like that, you’re so shocked at what youare seeing that you kind of forget to dig scientifically.EVEN THOUGH YOU AND YOUR BOSS HAD BEEN WORKING ON A CIA BLUEBOOK PROJECT TO ANALYZE UNEXPLAINED BLUE BOOK FILES, THAT WASTHE FIRST TIME YOU WERE ACTUALLY SHOWN REAL DISCS?Yes, that was the first and only time.WAS THAT BEFORE OR AFTER YOU WENT TO SEE THE GREY-SKINNED BEINGAT A R E A 5 1 ?That was before we saw the being.SO, YOU SAW THE DISCS FIRST.Yes, we walked on the walkway into the underground mountain hangar where we saw thediscs. Then we went back out into another building that was around the corner of the littlemountain area there. Then we got to the big main building outside where we saw the alien.WHO WAS ESCORTING YOU, YOUR BOSS AND THE THREE MEN FROM THECIA?It was that USAF Col. Jim. His name tag was not full. He just had his first name there.YOU GUYS HAD BADGES WITH YOUR NAMES?We had CIA identification badges that had our picture on it and our CIA cover names. Myboss had used his own name for years, but mine was a phony name as were the othersusing phony names.SO, NONE OF YOU KNEW WHO EACH OF YOU REALLY WERE?Right, none of us knew who each of us really was. My boss was the only one who knewmy real name because I came through the back door into the CIA by teaching in the ArmySigna l Corps. Derelict “Death” As Way Out of CIAIN TERMS OF YOUR RECORDS FROM 1956 TO 1960 IN THE ARMY SIGNALCORPS AND SIMULTANEOUSLY FOR THE CIA, WHERE WOULD THOSERECORDS BE?It was a common practice that in that highly classified area, the records would bedestroyed if you left or died, as far as the CIA portion was concerned. My military DD-214just shows that I was teaching in the Army Signal Corps down there, an instructor. Itdoesn’t give anything about my having a TOP SECRET White House clearance oranything like that. According to my military records, I was just an instructor in the SignalCorps at the southeastern base.WHEN YOU LEFT IN 1960, WOULD YOU EXPLAIN IF SOMEBODY WERETRYING TO TRACK YOU - EVEN BY THE PHONY NAME YOU HAD ON YOURCIA NAME BADGE - COULD THOSE PHONY NAMES BE TRACED?When we were working on the CIA Blue Book project, my colleagues there had gone outto some foreign areas for field research. I was the only one that I know of in our CIAgroup that got out alive. The others were killed on field assignments in Turkey and othercountries.BECAUSE THEY HAD UFO KNOWLEDGE?Yes, because they were checking out UFO leads in Turkey and other foreign lands. Therewas a big problem with the CIA at that time in the 1950s and 1960s. They had so many"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"double agents. A lot of those people were eliminated (killed off) just because the CIAthought they might be double agents.BUT YOU WERE ABLE TO GET OUT IN 1960?My time was up to be discharged in July 1960, so I had a chance. The CIA wanted me tostay, but when I saw all the other people being eliminated (murdered to keep them quiet), Itold my boss I definitely wanted to take my discharge and get out.He said there was probably only one way I could get by and that was to set up a situation,which he did only a few weeks after I received my discharge. His records showed I wasout somewhere on some kind of a field operation on UFOs, but what he did – which theyhad done for some other people in earlier years. We had a real hot spell in July in thatsouthern state where the military base was. There were some elderly street people who haddied. My boss and his group just picked up one of those dead street people and put myphony CIA name identification on the body and ran it officially through the city of --------.Then my boss had the dead body cremated. After the cremation, the ashes were spread inthe river down there. So, the CIA name I used officially was on the person who died.THAT’S WHAT ALLOWED YOU TO MOVE BACK INTO THE CIVILIAN WORLDUNDER YOUR ORIGINAL NAME?Yes. If I had said I’m quitting and getting out, I’m sure the CIA would have killed me toprevent my getting out and talking about the classified UFO stuff. We had 26 people tostart with in that CIA Project Blue Book and I was the only one that survived and got outbecause my boss helped me with the phony body cover.”YOUR CIA BOSS HELPED YOU ‘DIE’ WITHOUT ANYBODY KNOWING. HE WASPROTECTING YOU FROM HIS OWN AGENCY?Yes, protection was a very important back in those days. Years ago when JFK waspresident in 1960 to 1963 and his brother, Robert, was Attorney General, they learned thatwhat they were getting was almost worthless.MEANING THAT JFK AND RFK FOUND THAT THE INFORMATION THEY WEREGETTING FROM THE CIA WAS WORTHLESS?Yes, that’s why he came out with a comment that he was going to get rid of the CIA andjust have the FBI work overseas like the CIA. JFK and RFK were angry about getting buminformation and I think that’s why JFK made the statement and that’s what made the CIAso nervous nervous that they were all going to lose their jobs.” “I Will Smash the CIA...and Scatter Them to the Wind”Robert and John F. Kennedy, early 1960s.Image courtesy Simon & Schuster.On April 27, 1961, U. S. President John F. Kennedy spoke to the National News PublishersAssociation at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City: “The very word ‘secrecy’ is repugnant in a free and open society;and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed tosecret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. Wedecided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarrantedconcealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposingthe threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions.Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of ournation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is verygrave danger that an announced need for increased security willbe seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to thevery limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do notintend to permit to the extent that it’s in my control. And noofficial of my Administration, whether his rank is high or low,civilian or military, should interpret my words here tonight as anexcuse to censor the news, to stifle dissent, to cover up ourmistakes or to withhold from the press and the public the factsthey deserve to know.”Later, JFK promised U. S. Senator Mike Mansfield that “after Iam re-elected, I will smash the CIA into a thousand pieces, andscatter them to the wind.” Continued in Part 6More Information:For further information about 1947 Roswell UFO crashes and retrievals, please see mybooks in the Earthfiles Shop and reports below in the Earthfiles Archive:• 08/09/2008 — Part 5: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo, Project JEHOVAH andPhysicists Oppenheimer and Einstein• 08/06/2008 — Updated - Part 3: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo Links Government UFOCover-Up and JFK Assassination• 08/06/2008 — Part 4: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo Links Government UFO Cover-Upand JFK Assassination• 07/26/2008 — Part 1: Why No Military Response to Radar Unknown Headed to BushCrawford Ranch on January 8, 2008?• 07/25/2008 — Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell Says Governments Covering Up E.
