The question is whether we humanswill listen before it's too late.” - Vance Vredenburg, Ph.D.,Biology, San Francisco State Already steeply in decline, the critically endangered yellow-legged frogs diedat Sixty Lake Basin in California in August 2006. Their killer is the Chytrid fungus (Chytridiomycosis) whichhas devastated amphibian populations from California to Panama to Brazil to Australia overthe past decade.

Amphibians have survived thelast four of five mass extinctions on this planet.[ Editor's Note: From the August 12, 2008, Proceedings of the NationalAcademy of Sciences, \"Are We in the Midst of the Sixth Mass Extinction?

See websites below.“Five Mass ExtinctionsIt is generally thought that there have been five great massextinctions during the history of life on this planet. In each of thefive events, there was a profound loss of biodiversity during arelatively short period.1) The oldest mass extinction occurred at the Ordovician–Silurian boundary (≈ 439 Million Years Ago). Approximately25% of the families and nearly 60% of the genera of marine"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"organisms were lost. Contributing factors were great fluctuationsin sea level, which resulted from extensive glaciations, followedby a period of great global warming. Terrestrial vertebrates hadnot yet evolved.2) The next great extinction was in the Late Devonian (≈364Mya), when 22% of marine families and 57% of marine genera,including nearly all jawless fishes, disappeared. Global coolingafter bolide impacts may have been responsible because warmwater taxa were most strongly affected. Amphibians, the firstterrestrial vertebrates, evolved in the Late Devonian, and theysurvived this extinction event.3) The Permian–Triassic extinction (≈ 251 Mya) was by farthe worst of the five mass extinctions; 95% of all species (marineas well as terrestrial) were lost, including 53% of marine families,84% of marine genera, and 70% of land plants, insects, andvertebrates. Causes are debated, but the leading candidate isflood volcanism emanating from the Siberian Traps, which led toprofound climate change. Volcanism may have been initiated by abolide impact, which led to loss of oxygen in the sea. Theatmosphere at that time was severely hypoxic, which likely actedsynergistically with other factors. Most terrestrial vertebratesperished, but among the few that survived were earlyrepresentatives of the three orders of amphibians that survive tothis day.4) The End Triassic extinction (≈199–214 Mya) was associatedwith the opening of the Atlantic Ocean by sea floor spreadingrelated to massive lava floods that caused significant globalwarming. Marine organisms were most strongly affected (22% ofmarine families and 53% of marine genera were lost), butterrestrial organisms also experienced much extinction. Again,representatives of the three living orders of amphibians survived.5) The most recent mass extinction was at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary (≈65 Mya); 16% of families, 47% of generaof marine organisms, and 18% of vertebrate families were lost.Most notable was the disappearance of nonavian dinosaurs.Causes continue to be debated. Leading candidates includediverse climatic changes (e.g., temperature increases in deepseas) resulting from volcanic floods in India (Deccan Traps) andconsequences of a giant asteroid impact in the Gulf of Mexico.Not only did all three orders of amphibians again escapeextinction, but many, if not all, families and even a number ofextant amphibian genera survived.6) A Sixth Extinction?The possibility that a sixth mass extinction spasm is upon us hasreceived much attention. Substantial evidence suggests that anextinction event is underway.” ] Since the 1990s, amphibians have been dying out around the world in increasing numbers.In fact, 2008 was declared the Year of the Frog by the Amphibian Ark organizationdedicated to saving amphibians.One of the culprits behind the alarming amphibian die-off is called the chytrid (KYE-trid)fungus. Surprisingly, it was not identified by scientists until 1998, only ten years ago. By 2008, after ten years of intense study, no one yet understands how the chytrid fungus iskilling frogs, toads, salamanders and other amphibians. Another mystery is how does thefungus spread so fast? Scientists have documented year-by-year waves of amphibiandie-offs moving over vast geographic distances. Once the chytrid fungus is in a new region,most of the amphibians are killed in only a year’s time.In the August 12, 2008, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, a zoologist andbiologist presented data about the question: Is Earth now in a 6th mass extinction thatcould see thousands of species on land, in water and air die off forever, as happened 65million years ago when it is hypothesized that an asteroid slammed into the Gulf of Mexicoand wiped out the dinosaurs along with 70% of all earth life in the fifth mass extinctionevent? Scientists are concerned that a growing data base of die-offs means the answer isyes and that the increasing decline of amphibians is the alarm bell."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"This time, human civilization is equivalent to the destructive asteroid. Our humanterritories continue to expand, which shrinks the natural wild habitats. Human industriesare warming the planet, forcing animals and plants to move with temperature changes intonew territories. Changing ecosystems provoke insects, bacteria, viruses, algae and fungi toalso change their tactics in living off other earth creatures. Further, our massivecommercial food industries are filling soils and plants with a wide range of pesticides thatscientists know can be especially hard on amphibians that breathe through their skin.One of the NAS Proceedings authors is Prof. Vance Vredenburg, Asst. Professor ofBiology at San Francisco State University. He says that because amphibians are suchancient earth animals that survived previous mass extinctions, we humans should all bealarmed that “something is wrong in our world. We humans might be doing OK right now,but the amphibians are doing poorly.” The question is - will humans pay serious attentionto the amphibian warning before it’s too late for all life?Prof. Vredenburg’s co-author is David Wake, Curator of Herpetology in the Museum ofVertebrate Zoology at the University of California-Berkeley. This week I talked with himabout data from the 2004 first global assessment of all species in the world. That studyconcluded there are about 6,000 species of amphibians. Of those, one-third were on thebrink of extinction and another 40% are threatened with extinction. And for reasonsunknown, the chytrid fungus is the leading killer of amphibians.Interview:David Wake, Ph.D., Curator of Herpetology, Museum of Vertebrate Zoology,University of California-Berkeley: “By 2005 to 2006, the results were in and the chytridfungus has had a profound impact on populations of amphibians, particularly in CentralAmerica and the mountains of California and in the tropical mountains of Australia.HOW DOES THE CHYTRID FUNGUS KILL? Left: Chytrid fungus infection shows in the pink underbelly of green tree frog.Right: Great barred frog has a severe Chytrid fungus infection that is causing its skin to peel off.Images by Australia National Parks and Wildlife Service.We don’t know exactly. That’s the question I always ask in scientific meetings. What is theimmediate cause of death? There are hypotheses. The chytrid fungus is a rather simpleorganism – genetically complex – but simple in structure that invades the superficialsurface of the skin of amphibians. The chytrid fungus lives on keratin. When we feel ourskin, that’s what we are feeling. [Keratins are the main constituent of structures that growfrom the skin.] Keratin is the outermost surface. So, the chytrid fungus eats this keratinstuff that was not considered nutritious for organisms, but the chytrid fungus favorskeratin.Above : Chytrid fungus cells about to release more spores.Be low: Electron micrograph of chytrid fungus on frog skin.Photomicrographs by Lee Berger, Australia's CommonwealthScientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO)."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" When an amphibian gets a massive infection of the chytrid fungus, it probably interfereswith the amphibian's respiration because even those creatures with excellent lungs actuallyhave most of the gaseous exchange across their moist skins. So, they suffocate in their ownskin. I can’t prove that, but it’s a general consensus of researchers.BECAUSE AMPHIBIANS BREATHE THROUGH THEIR SKIN.They do. They get 90%, or in some cases 100%, of their respiration through their skin.There are many frogs and salamanders that are even lungless. So, the lungs are notnecessary at all for amphibian respiration. Amphibians depend upon their highlyvascularized, moist skins for respiration. Chytrid Fungus “Jumps Boundariesand Causes Havoc”PROF. VREDENBURG, YOUR COLLEAGUE ON THIS RESEARCH, WAS QUOTEDIN SCIENCE DAILY AS SAYING, ‘IT’S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TOUNDERSTAND WHAT’S INFECTING AND KILLING THESE FROGS. THIS DISEASEIS A REMARKABLE EXAMPLE OF A PATHOGEN JUMPING BOUNDARIES ANDCAUSING HAVOC. COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT?Yes, because we don’t really know how this pathogen moves around. First, we don’t knowwhere it came from. It just emerged. It’s a phylogenetically very isolated taxon. It has noclose relative, so we can’t look at any close relatives and ask: how do they live? What dothey live on? The chytrid fungus is very isolated. But it has been traced back to the 1940sin the clawed frog of Africa. The leading hypothesis about its spread is that people startedspreading the clawed frog around. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - Phylogenetics means relative to birth and is thestudy of evolutionary relatedness among various groups of organisms.Taxonomy, the classification of organisms according to similarity, has beenrichly informed by phylogenetics, but remains methodologically and logicallydistinct. A taxon (plural taxa), or taxonomic unit, is a name designating anorganism or a group of organisms.] Clawed Frog - Origin of Chytrid Fungus?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis), also known as platanna.Image © by John Elkington. [ Editor’s Note: The genus Xenopus is aquatic and the only frog with clawedtoes. The African clawed frog has a flat body with a relatively small head. Itsskin is smooth, with dorsal surfaces usually colored in mottled hues ofolive-brown or gray with darker marks and ventral surfaces a creamy whitecolor. This frog has no tongue, no teeth, no eyelids, and no external eardrums.Its forelimbs have four unwebbed fingers and its hind limbs have five long,webbed toes with dark claws on the three outer toes.The genus is found throughout much of Europe, North America, SouthAmerica and Africa. When African clawed frogs are imported into non-nativecountries, they have the capacity to wreck entire ecosystems by eating nativewildlife such as fish and turtles that have no natural defense against thesecreatures.In 2007, these frogs invaded a pond in San Francisco, where much debateexists on how to terminate these creatures and keep them from spreading. It isunknown if these frogs entered the San Francisco ecosystem throughintentional release or escape into the wild.Because these frogs are immune to the fungi Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis(a chytridomycota) and B. dendrobatidis has been traced back to the habitatof Xenopus laevis in Africa, many scholars believe it is the source of theworldwide amphibian die-off caused by the chytrid fungus. ] David Wake, Ph.D.: “I remember this well when clawed frogs were the main organismsused for human pregnancy tests. What happened was that you would take urine from apossibly pregnant woman. You would inject the urine into a clawed frog and if the frog laideggs, the woman was pregnant. That was the way it was done! So, these frogs, which areaquatic, lived in aquariums in doctor’s offices all around the world and the frogs weremoved around. Then, these frogs were heavily used as model organisms. They becameTHE amphibian for the model organism. That meant the clawed frog was heavily used inlaboratories. People released them into streams and ponds when they were done withthem. That should not have happened, but now there are established populations of clawedfrogs in southern California, for example. So we know this was happening.But now what we would like to know is that once the chytrid fungus was in the clawedfrogs, somehow the fungus jumped the boundaries. They jumped from one species intoanother. Now, the chytrid fungus seems to be able to move quite long distances and wewould really like to know how they do that.Now, why is the chytrid fungus having this profound impact on amphibians? Some peoplethink it’s linked to global climate change. Other people question that. But, it’s undeniablethat there is this high correlation between the arrival of the chytrid fungus in the"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"population and the collapse of that amphibian population within a year.WITHIN A YEAR?Within a year.WHAT WOULD THERE BE ABOUT THE AVERAGE GLOBAL TEMPERATURE OFTHE EARTH INCREASING THAT WOULD SUDDENLY MAKE A CHYTRID FUNGUSBE ABLE TO KILL SO MANY AMPHIBIANS?The chytrid fungus operates in mountain environments. There are people who havepresented the argument that the cloud line is rising. What that means is in these mountainareas, you have clouds at night. That means it is warmer at night than it used to be in thepast and it’s cooler by day. This narrower range of temperatures, it is hypothesized, favorsthe growth of the chytrid fungus.CAN YOU PROJECT INTO THE FUTURE ABOUT WHAT THIS DIE-OFF MEANSFOR THE FUTURE POPULATION OF AMPHIBIANS?Yes, I can in fact, because this has been done by Karen Lips at the Univ. of SouthernIllinois. [ See websites below.] She has been working from Costa Rico into Panama. In1990, I was in the field with her when she was choosing her study site. By 1994, the frogswere beginning to disappear from her study site. She could not figure out why. Karen Lipsand Australian scientists almost simultaneously discovered that the chytrid fungus washitting both Australian frogs and Costa Rican frogs. Really weird!A Panamanian Golden Frog killed by chytrid fungus in central Panama.Source: Saveafrog.org.So, Karen shifted her attention to an area further south. A year later in 1995, that area washit by chytrid fungus and devastated. Then Karen Lips made a prediction. Shehypothesized that there was a wave-affect of this chytrid fungus and it was moving south.She started taking extreme precautions herself by disinfecting her boots before she wentinto her study site. She laid out study areas further to the south and the east and shepredicted the pathogen would arrive there and have a devastating effect. And she wasright, absolutely right. Chytrid Fungus Devastated Amphibiansin Panama's El Cope National ParkEl Cope National Park, Panama.Finally, she predicted that the pathogen would reach El Cope National Park in Panama. Itdid and wiped out the population of amphibians there. At that point, the Amphibian Arkwas established. [ See websites below.] Amphibian Ark is an organization associated withthe American Zoological Park, sponsored by them, and headed by some highly competent"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"herpetologists who know amphibians extremely well. They went through the extraordinaryactivity of removing living frogs from the field at the next place down from the devastatedPanama site. The scientists moved those still-uninfected amphibians into captive breeding,taking them out of their natural environment and moving them into captive breeding toprotect them. This is really an extreme measure because you have to assume you’re goingto be successful – and thankfully, I think they are being successful in getting theamphibians to thrive in captivity.But you have to hope that something is going to change in the environment so that it willbe safe for them to be returned to their natural home at some point. Possibly, if theenvironment is free of frogs, there will be nothing for the chytrid fungus to live on and itwill die out. That’s the hope, as I understand it. How Does the Chytrid Fungus Spread So Rapidly?HOW DO YOU THINK THE CHYTRID FUNGUS SPREADS SO RAPIDLY?That’s THE question. We do not know how it’s making it. Chytrid seems to go too fast tobe explained by adjacency from one frog to the next to the next. Some people think maybebirds are transmitting the chytrid fungus on their legs. But, as far as I know, it’s never beenshown that the fungus has infected a bird.The chytrid fungus zoospores are really quite fragile. They dry out easily and they dieeasily. So, transmission is really the big question in my mind. This was directed atherpetologists themselves – maybe they were transmitting it in mud on their boots. So, thisis why all herpetologists going into the field now disinfect their boots.Chytridiomycosis. Ventral skin of upper hind limb of Atelopus variusfrom western Panama. Two sporangia (spore-containing bodies of Batrachochytrium sp.)containing numerous zoospores are visible within cells of the stratum corneum.Each flask-shaped sporangium has a single characteristic discharge tube (arrows) atthe skin surface. Exiting zoospores are visible in the discharge tubes of both sporangia.Source: Daszak P, Berger L, Cunningham A, Hyatt A, Green D, Speare R. EmergingInfectious Diseases and Amphibian Population Declines. 1999 Nov-Dec.BUT YOU SAID THAT THE CHYTRID FUNGUS HAS BEEN DEVASTATINGAMPHIBIAN POPULATIONS IN REGIONS AS REMOTE AND SEPARATE ASBRAZIL AND THE CALIFORNIA MOUNTAINS.Yes. The only explanation that has come up that makes any global sense is thetransportation of the African clawed frogs around the world. That is purely an hypothesis.There is no strong evidence for that, but that’s all we’ve got. I don’t know how this fungusis getting around.WHY IS IT THAT THE WAY THE CHYTRID FUNGUS IS KILLING AMPHIBIANS ISSTILL NOT UNDERSTOOD?Very good question. There are a lot of people working on that. It’s a difficult question. Ican tell you that the number of amphibian experimentalists has increased dramatically inthe past couple of decades, but we still do not know the answers to those questions. Fungiare really hard things to study. Fungi are tough and difficult to get rid of. Have you everlooked at a magazine and seen all the ads for nail (form of keratin) fungus remedies? Thereare hundreds of fungi that attack different organisms and we are not able to handle most ofthem."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Why do we have so much trouble with fungi? Because they are complex organisms and wehaven’t learned our lessons about fungi yet. There are a lot of things we have to learn. How Serious Is the Amphibian Extinction Threat?PROJECTING FORWARD IN 2008 AND BEYOND WITH WHAT YOU KNOW RIGHTNOW, HOW BAD DO YOU THINK THE DECLINE OF AMPHIBIANS COULD BE?It’s terrible! Even if only 40% of amphibian species are at risk of extinction, that’s terrible.And it might be much higher than that. But remember, we discovered the chytrid in 1998.That doesn’t mean it’s not been around for awhile. It might have been responsible for a lotof the earlier declines that we only detected much later.IN YOUR RESEARCH, WHAT WILL BE THE NEXT STEP?One of the things I’m really excited about is finding the chytrid fungus infecting strictlyterrestrial amphibians that never go near the water. I think if we can crack that, we havesome interesting leads because this chytrid fungus is an aquatic fungus. What is an aquaticfungus doing infecting a strictly terrestrial animal that never goes near the water at all?Right in Berkeley. It’s happening right here. So, that’s a real opportunity and we’ve gotpeople working on that. We have to know a lot more about this chytrid fungus. We have toknow what kills. Why are amphibians killed by it? We’ve got ideas, but we haven’t gotproof. We’ve got to know how it spreads. We’ve got to know how it can live on strictlyterrestrial organisms. I think if we could crack open some of the biology of the chytridfungus, we’d make a lot more headway.WHAT WOULD THIS PLANET BE LIKE WITHOUT AMPHIBIANS?Well, that’s a good question. A lot more insects! But I think we probably won’t be here tosee it. I suspect that enough amphibians will get through this extinction crisis and they willoutlast us. I don’t give Homo sapiens a very high probability of surviving terribly long onthis planet. We are creatures on the same planet and the amphibians are not being affectedby just one, but many factors. It’s like death from a thousand cuts. We have a lot to learnfrom them.IF THE AMPHIBIANS ARE DYING OUT, LIKE THE CANARIES IN THE COALMINE, WE COULD BE NEXT?It’s interesting that you say canaries in the coal mine. Some people don’t like that analogyfor amphibians. I can tell you why. What did the miner do when the canary died?HE HAD TO GET OUT OF THE MINE.Yes. Where are you going?I SEE. IT’S A REAL REALITY CHECK ON THE FACT THAT WE ARE ALL ON ONEPLANET.That’s exactly it. We’re all in the same coal mine.AND IF THE AMPHIBIANS ARE DYING, THEN WHAT IS NEXT FOR US HUMANS?Good question.”More Information:For further information about amphibian die-offs, please see reports below in EarthfilesArchive:• 06/21/2008 — Updated June 25, 2008: Increasingly Acidic Pacific Coast Waters ThreatenMarine Life• 02/29/2008 — Mysterious Bat Deaths in New York, Vermont and Massachusetts• 02/05/2008 — Federal Court Rejects Bush Navy Sonar Exemption• 01/18/2008 — Amphibians Dying Out At Alarming Rate• 08/08/2007 — 2007's Warm, Erratic Global Weather• 07/11/2007 — Mystery of Night Shining Clouds - Another Global Warming Change?• 06/28/2007 — Hackenberg Apiary, Pennsylvania - 75-80% Honey Bee Loss in 2007.
