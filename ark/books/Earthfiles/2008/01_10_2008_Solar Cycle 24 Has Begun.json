The spot was in a high-latitude on the sun with reversed polarity from theprevious Solar Cycle 23 that has been in minimum for a long time. The sun has had a blankface without any sunspots for days and weeks at a time. But from now forward to 2012,sunspots should start appearing again all over the sun, leading up to what NASAastrophysicist, David Hathaway, Ph.D., thinks will be one of the more intense solarmaximums on record. Dr. Hathaway is the Solar Physics Team Leader at NASA’s MarshallSpace Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. He received his Ph.D. in astrophysics from theUniversity of Colorado in Boulder in 1979.Dr. Hathaway is now one of the top solar astrophysicists in the world. He was surprisedlast week in the beginning of January 2008, to learn that his own solar physics researchwas being used by a non-scientist named John Casey in an Orlando, Florida companycalling itself “Space and Science Research Center.” SSRC recently distributed an alarmingpress release on the internet entitled “Changes in the Sun’s Surface to Bring Next ClimateChange.” The press release warned there will be a global food shortage in the next SolarCycle 25 (approximately 2018 - 2029).This week I talked with Dr. Hathaway about the press release and his own perceptionsabout what’s expected in this current Solar Cycle 24 and beyond.Interview: "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"David Hathaway, Ph.D., NASA Astrophysicist.David Hathaway, Ph.D., Solar Physics Team Leader, NASA’s Marshall Space FlightCenter, Huntsville, Alabama: “In the beginning of the cycle, it’s a little like poppingpopcorn where first one spot will come out and then you wait. Then there is another - bam,bam, bam! And off it goes, the cycle is on its way.We’re expecting this cycle will start rising in the next few months and should reach itsmaximum in about 2011 to 2012 time frame. Of course, the solar maximum is an extendedperiod – one to two years at least where the sun is particularly active, compared to wherewe are now. We’ve gone for days and weeks at a time without any sunspots at all. Left: not a single sunspot on December 30, 2007.Right: Active sunspots in previous Cycle 23. Images credit: SOHO/MDI.During solar maximum, we should see lots of spots on the sun. Even the low predictionsfor this Cycle 24 indicate that at maximum there ought to be on any given day at least 70or 80 spots on the sun.THE LAST TIME WE TALKED, THERE WAS DISPUTE ABOUT WHETHER THISWAS GOING TO BE A REALLY INTENSE “X-CLASS” SOLAR FLARE MAXIMUMIN THE 2011, 2012, 2013 TIME PERIOD? OR WILL IT BE REALLY MILD? IS THESCIENTIFIC EXPECTATION ON THIS NOW ANY CLEARER?Unfortunately, no. (laughs) We continue to do research and it really comes down to twomodels and two different techniques for predicting the size of the next cycle, both ofwhich agreed on the last Cycle 23, but disagree on this Cycle 24. We really have notgotten to the bottom of it yet.DO YOU STILL EXPECT IT TO BE A VERY INTENSE CYCLE 24 SOLARMAXIMUM?I’m still sticking with it, that’s right. There are a number of indicators that suggest SolarCycle 24 Maximum should be a big cycle, and there is a model out there that has shown tobe extremely accurate in going back in time to predict the last eight cycles. That model cando it better than any of the other techniques out there and suggests that this upcomingsolar maximum should be a much bigger solar cycle than average. Solar Cycle 25 - Cool Earth and Food Shortages?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WE WILL THEN BE ENTERING ANOTHER SOLAR MINIMUM AROUND 2017 TO2019, RIGHT?Right, about another eleven years from now we should be back in another minimum phaseof the sunspot cycle.THAT WILL BE CALLED SOLAR CYCLE 25 AND THERE HAS BEEN A PRESSRELEASE THAT HAS BEEN CIRCULATING ON THE WEB FOR THE LAST WEEKOR SO IN 2008 FROM AN ORGANIZATION CALLED “SPACE AND SCIENCERESEARCH CENTER (SSRC) ” IN ORLANDO, FLORIDA. THE DIRECTOR IS JOHNCASEY. THEY HAVE RELEASED INFORMATION SAYING THEY EXPECT SOLARCYCLE 25 TO BE SO LOW IN SUNSPOTS THAT IT WILL PLUNGE THE EARTHINTO A COOLING PERIOD THAT COULD JEOPARDIZE FOOD CROPS GLOBALLY.COULD YOU COMMENT ON HIS HYPOTHESIS?I find it highly doubtful. First of all, he bases his prediction for a small Cycle 25 on myown work. I’m well familiar with my own work! This was work where we had looked atthe drift rate of sunspots on the sun and from that inferred flows that contribute to how thesun makes sunspot cycles. That flow was particularly slow during this last Cycle 23 – infact, slower than any of the previous 12 cycles.We also found a correlation with the strength of that flow and the strength of the upcomingsolar cycle two cycles in the future. This fits in with the same model that is predicting thatthis next Cycle 24 ought to be a large cycle.Given that data, we (NASA) went out on a limb and suggested that solar Cycle 25 (appx.2018 to 2029) ought to be a much smaller than average cycle because that flow duringCycle 23 was a lot smaller than average. But there is a lot of scattering in themeasurements. It’s not a perfect relationship and our uncertainty about just that onerelationship and how big Cycle 25 is going to be is give or take 30%.His claim (John Casey, SSRC) is that he has evidence that corroborates our own NASAresearch in suggesting that Cycle 25 ought to be a small cycle. But there are other stepsinvolved in getting from that to global cooling. Part of that is to what extent does solarvariability in the sunspot cycle contribute to global warming? Our best estimates – this isan active area of research and there are other solar researchers that would claim the sun isfar more important than I think – but if I look at the sunspot record and I look at thetemperature record, it suggests that the sun influences the Earth’s global temperature atabout the 20 to 30% level.When we look at the correlation between the sunspot cycle and Earth temperature, it’s nota really tight fit. There are other things that are far more important such as El Nino,volcanic eruptions and things like greenhouse gases that also influence – altogether muchgreater than solar activity.So, making the conclusion that a small Cycle 25 means we are going to go into a coolperiod on Earth is really pushing it. It’s taking the extremes of two or three measurementsand adding them together to say this is going to be the effect. I’m highly suspicious of thatresult.IT SEEMS THAT THERE IS AN IRONY HERE ALSO THAT IF SOLAR CYCLE 25 DIDBRING ANY COOLING, IT MIGHT BE OFFSET BY THE GLOBAL WARMINGGREENHOUSE BLANKET THAT IS BUILDING UP AROUND THE EARTH?That’s certainly a possibility. If the sun does come in at 20 to 30% and it’s particularly lowthen, the greenhouse gas blanket might be particularly offsetting of that kind of cooling.WE MIGHT BE WORRIED ABOUT SOMETHING THAT COULD PROTECT USDURING THAT PERIOD?Protect us? I think the word to use is ‘temper’ the amount of warming we have. It might dothat. But again, it’s also predicated on Cycle 25 actually being a small cycle. As far as Iknow, the only real indication of that is in fact the study I did on this flow on the sun andhow it’s related to future activity.WOULD YOU SAY THAT YOU HAVE PERSONALLY ANY CONCERN ABOUTFUTURE SOLAR CYCLES AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE EARTH’SCLIMATE?I don’t have big concerns. Certainly, I would be more concerned about other things whenit comes to climate. But nonetheless, it does behoove us to figure out what role the sundoes play in all of this. I do have colleagues who have their own research and concludethat the sun has a bigger influence than 30%. They have valid arguments we need to hash"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"out and figure out to what extent does the sun contribute to global warming?” Is Sun Heating Up Solar System?Many people on the internet keep discussing rumors that our entire solar system iswarming up, causing thaws on Mars and out as far as Pluto. But, Dr. Hathaway at NASAsays there is no hard data that shows the sun is so much brighter and hotter that it wouldcause solar system-wide warming. In fact, even when the sun is at intense solar maximumwith nearly 100 sunspots all over it – the sun’s brightness might increase only 1/1000thabove it’s normal brightness during solar minimum.More Information:For further reports about solar cycles, sunspots and solar flares, please see EarthfilesArchive:• 08/08/2007 — 2007's Warm, Erratic Global Weather• 07/11/2007 — Mystery of Night Shining Clouds - Another Global Warming Change?• 06/21/2007 — Large Lake in Southern Chile Has Disappeared• 06/01/2007 — Is Earth Close to Dangerous Tipping Point in Global Warming?• 02/23/2007 — Scientists Hope \"Amphibian Arks\" Can Save Frogs and Toads• 01/13/2007 — Confusing Sun: Will Solar Cycle 24 Be Most Intense On Record?• 01/10/2007 — 2006: USA's Warmest Year On Record• 12/07/2006 — Earth Headed for Warmest Period in 55 Million Years?• 09/09/2006 — Methane - Another Threat in Global Warming• 08/23/2006 — Solar Cycle 24 - Headed for Intense X Flares by 2010-2012?• 07/18/2006 — 2006 - Hottest Year So Far in U.
