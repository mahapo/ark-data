They were not even similar to the photos I had taken. Thesephotos show what appears to be a roundish object with a series of odd, circular shapesaround the outside. When you get to the far left or far right on the thing moving throughthe dozen photographs, the object seems to be turning. I really see that when I bring hisMissouri photos up as a series, and flip through them fast. This object appears not only tobe rotating, but going up, down and right and left, as well as reflecting light on to theground.WHAT PROVOKED THE CAMERA TO TAKE THE PHOTOGRAPHS?No idea! Obviously this (disc) thing – whatever it is – was able to trigger the camera. So,there must have been motion detected or the infrared beam was broken in order to triggerthese pictures.THIS MAN WHO SUBMITTED THE PHOTOGRAPHS TO YOU, HE HAD ANINFRARED-TRIGGERING DIGITAL CAMERA JUST LIKE YOURS?Yes. But his is manufactured by a different company called Cuddeback Digital ScoutingCameras. It’s stamped on each photo, along with the date and time.WHY DID HE HAVE THE CAMERA SET UP?Basically for imaging deer, as a lot of hunters do, to know which type and sex of deer are"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"on the game trail. I learned about this in his February 14, 2008, email after my TV show.He wanted to get hold of someone concerning my six deer cam photos. I’ll read his emailverbatim:‘Thank you for replying. I’m sending you these pictures in the attachment.There are 13 separate pictures [ Editor's Note: 12 are shown below], and Iassure you, just as you said, these are not doctored pictures. It was just asmuch a surprise to me as it was to my family when I showed them.Notice as the object moves side-to-side, there is a reflection on the ground thatmoves in close relationship to the object. I have a picture that shows me backthere two hours prior to this with nothing unusual in the area, so I don’t knowwhat this is – but hopefully, I never have to encounter this while I’m hunting.If you think you could find more information about this, please use the photosany way you can.’Then, I sent him back an email.‘Strange indeed. I notice these pictures have a blank between 9:34 PM and1:28 AM. Were there any images in between (those times)? Interestingly, your (Nov. 5 - 6, 2007) photos were taken very close to mine(but) ten days earlier [Coine images were Nov. 16, 2007]. Were these picturesinitiated by deer or other wildlife? I’d like to get your pictures up on YouTubeas a follow-up to mine. I’ve been receiving input from around the world, butno hard answers yet.It might be my imagination, but it looks as if your object is rotating, basedupon the circles on the left when I run through them quickly.’Sarcoxie, Missouri, hunter’s response:‘No, there were no pictures taken in between those times (9:34 PM to 1:28AM, Nov. 5 - 6, 2007). The only picture taken before this is of me at 7:04 PM,when I walked in front of the camera. I do not believe these pictures wereinitiated by animals because if they were, I think the quick response of myCuddeback camera would have captured them. Feel free to use them as afollow-up and keep me posted if you find any answers to our strange images.’” Time Line of Sarcoxie, Missouri, ImagesBob Coine told me, “In this strange series of images, there were no other photos taken inbetween of animals or anything else that logically might have triggered the camera.” Thefirst six images were taken nearly every minute between 9:34 PM Central and 9:40 PM.Then over the next nearly four hours, no images were taken at all. The second group of siximages was taken between 1:28 AM and 1:38 AM.Same scene photographed in daylight with same Cuddeback Digital Cameraon November 19, 2007, Sarcoxie, Missouri.1) 9:34 PM Central, November 5, 2007: Wide Shot and Cropped Close-Up"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"2) 9:35 PM Central, November 5, 2007: Wide Shot and Cropped Close-Up"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" 3) 9:36 PM Central, November 5, 2007: Wide Shot and Cropped Close-Up 4) 9:37 PM Central, November 5, 2007: Wide Shot and Cropped Close-Up"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"5) 9:39 PM Central, November 5, 2007: Wide Shot and Cropped Close-Up 6) 9:40 PM Central, November 5, 2007: Wide Shot and Cropped Close-Up"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"7) 1:28 AM, Central, November 6, 2007: Wide Shot and Cropped Close-Up 8) 1:33 AM Central, November 6, 2007: Wide Shot and Cropped Close-Up"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" 9) 1:34 AM Central, November 6, 2007: Wide Shot and Cropped Close-Up10) 1:35 AM Central, November 6, 2007: Wide Shot and Cropped Close-Up"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" 11) 1:37 AM Central, November 6, 2007: Wide Shot and Cropped Close-Up 12) 1:38 AM Central, November 6, 2007: Wide Shot and Cropped Close-Up"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"If any Earthfiles viewer has any information about the identity either strange object inParts 1 and 2 of this Earthfiles report, please email me: earthfiles@earthfiles.com andcontact Heartland Studios, Inc., Oregon, Illinois.More Information:Cuddebak Digital Scouting CamerasFor further information about mysterious lights and aerial objects, please see my booksand documentaries in the Earthfiles Shop and related Earthfiles reports below in theEarthfiles Archives:• 03/28/2008 — Deer Mutilation in Longs, South Carolina, Two Helicopters and Large, WhiteSphere• 02/14/2008 — Update: Mysterious Symbols Projected in Night Sky by Aerial Disc NearStephenville, Texas, Local Airport• 02/08/2008 — Law Officers Describe Unidentified Shape-Shifting Aerial Craft inStephenville, Texas, Region• 01/28/2008 — Updated 01-28-08: Viewer Letters About Aerial Craft and Military FlyoversAbove Dublin, Stephenville and Selden, Texas• 01/18/2008 — Updated: Huge Aerial Craft Over Dublin, Texas, “Longer Than 3 FootballFields”• 11/08/2007 — More Unusual Animal Deaths• 11/02/2007 — Mysterious Orbs - Emanations from A Divine Field?• 10/21/2007 — Viewer Comments About Big Triangles and Lights - In Conflict?• 10/19/2007 — Updated: Huge, Silent, Black Triangle Craft Over Youngstown, Florida• 10/17/2007 — Updated: Half Cat Mutilations Persist in San Antonio, Texas• 10/04/2007 — 070707 East Field Wheat Formation: Lab Analysis• 09/28/2007 — Earthfiles Mail About Cat Mutilations• 09/26/2007 — Neatly Sliced Front Third of 14 Cats Found in Granbury, Texas• 09/20/2007 — Part 2: Psi Spies - True Story of America's Psychic Warfare Program• 09/16/2007 — Part 5: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/14/2007 — Part 1: Psi Spies - True Story of America's Psychic Warfare Program• 09/11/2007 — Part 4: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/07/2007 — Part 3: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 09/05/2007 — Part 2: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 08/31/2007 — Part 1: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured!• 08/31/2007 — Part 2: Betty and Barney Hill: Captured!• 08/30/2007 — Part 1: Military Insiders Comment About Zeta Reticuli and EBENs• 08/25/2007 — Woodborough Hill Wheat Pattern Made for Rock Band Video"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"• 08/21/2007 — More News About August 2007 Woodborough Hill Formation• 08/17/2007 — Two Bulls and Several Cows Dead and Mutilated in Manitoba, Canada• 08/17/2007 — Latest 6-Fold Wheat Geometry in Wiltshire, England• 08/13/2007 — Another U.
