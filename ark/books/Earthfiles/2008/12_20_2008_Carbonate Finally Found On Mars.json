Carbonates result from carbon dioxidedissolved in water.On Earth, carbonates are usually marine sediments like limestone and chalk. “Primitivelife would have liked it,” said Bethany Ehlmann, a Brown graduate student and leadauthor of the paper that appears in the December 19, 2008, edition of the journal, Science.“It’s not too hot or too cold. It’s not too acidic. It's a ‘just right’ place.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Brown University graduate student, Bethany Ehlmann,found the carbonate mineral on Mars by analyzing Mars ReconnaissanceOrbiter (MRO) data. Image credit: John Abromowski, Brown University.Until now, the mineral picture of more modern Mars, based on data from the Martianrovers, Spirit and Opportunity, and orbiting spacecraft, has been salt-rich and acidicwaters. Since carbonates dissolve quickly in low pH solutions, it is possible that many largecarbonate formations created on early Mars might have disappeared by now. That couldexplain why it's taken so long to find a carbonate signature, which is now clear in the NiliFossae on the edge of the Isidis impact basin.“This is opening up a range of environments on Mars,” said John “Jack” Mustard, Ph.D., aBrown Professor of Geological Sciences and a co-author with Bethany Ehlmann on theScience paper. “This is highlighting an environment that to the best of our knowledgedoesn’t experience the same kind of unforgiving conditions that have been identified inother areas. We know there’s been water all over the place, but how frequently have theconditions been hospitable for life?” Mustard said. “We can say pretty confidently thatwhen water was present in the places we looked at, it would have been a happy, pleasantenvironment for life.” NASA Background On ImportantCarbonate DiscoveryMars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) illustrated in an elliptical,low-planet orbit around Mars.

Scientists found carbonate minerals, indicating thatMars had neutral to alkaline water when the minerals formed at these locations more than3.6 billion years ago. Carbonates, which on Earth include limestone and chalk, dissolvequickly in acid. Therefore, their survival until today on Mars challenges suggestions that anexclusively acidic environment later dominated the planet. Instead, it indicates thatdifferent types of watery environments existed. The greater the variety of wetenvironments, the greater the chances one or more of them may have supported life.“We're excited to have finally found carbonate minerals because they provide more detailabout conditions during specific periods of Mars' history,” said Scott Murchie, PrincipalInvestigator for the MRO instrument at the Johns Hopkins University Applied PhysicsLaboratory in Laurel, Maryland.Carbonate rocks are created when water and carbon dioxide interact with calcium, iron ormagnesium in volcanic rocks. Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere becomes trappedwithin the rocks. If all of the carbon dioxide locked in Earth's carbonates were released,our atmosphere would be thicker than that of Venus. Some researchers believe that a thick,carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere kept ancient Mars warm and kept water liquid on itssurface long enough to have carved the valley systems observed today.“The carbonates that CRISM has observed are regional rather than global in nature, andtherefore, are too limited to account for enough carbon dioxide to form a thickatmosphere,” said Bethany Ehlmann, lead author of the article and a spectrometer teammember from Brown University, Providence, Rhode Island.“Although we have not found the types of carbonate deposits which might have trappedan ancient atmosphere,” Ehlmann said, “we have found evidence that not all of Marsexperienced an intense, acidic weathering environment 3.5 billion years ago, as has beenproposed. We've found at least one region that was potentially more hospitable to life.” Isidis Impact Basin and Nili Fossae"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Isidis Planitia is near the Martian equator between Arabia Terra and Elysium Planitia.The researchers report clearly defined carbonate exposures in bedrock layers surroundingthe 1,489-kilometer-diameter (925-mile) Isidis impact basin, which formed more than 3.6billion years ago. The best-exposed rocks occur along a trough system called Nili Fossae,which is 666 kilometers (414 miles) long, at the edge of the basin. The region has rocksenriched in olivine, a mineral that can react with water to form carbonate.“This discovery of carbonates in an intact rock layer, in contact with clays, is an exampleof how joint observations by CRISM and the telescopic cameras on the MarsReconnaissance Orbiter are revealing details of distinct environments on Mars,” said SueSmrekar, Deputy Project Scientist for the MRO at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory inPasadena, California.NASA's Phoenix Mars Lander discovered carbonates in soil samples. Researchers hadpreviously found them in Martian meteorites that fell to Earth and in windblown Mars dustobserved from orbit. However, the dust and soil could be mixtures from many areas, so thecarbonates' origins have been unclear. The latest observations indicate carbonates mayhave formed over extended periods on early Mars. They also point to specific locationswhere future rovers and landers could search for possible evidence of past life. Discovery of Four Types of Depositsfrom Wet Conditions on Early Mars"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Each of these four panels shows a close-up view of a different type of geological depositformed with the involvement of water, based on observations by NASA's Mars ReconnaissanceOrbiter.

Beneath a rough-textured capping rock unit (purple) lie banded olivine-bearinglayers (yellow), which in some places have been partially or wholly altered to carbonate(green).The upper-right panel shows phyllosilicates and chlorides in the Terra Sirenum region,observed by CRISM and HiRISE. Medium-toned, finely fractured rocks containingchloride salts either underlie higher-standing, light-toned phyllosilicates or fill in low spotsbetween them. Both sit on dark, eroded volcanic material.The lower-left panel shows the upper portion of canyon wall in Coprates Chasma,observed by HiRISE and CRISM. The chasm rim cuts across the middle of the image. Thewall slopes down to the top of the image and continues outside the region shown, exposingmultiple phyllosilicate-bearing layers in a section of rock 7 kilometers (4 miles) thick. Twoof the layers shown here are finely fractured aluminum clays that dominate the lower halfof the image, underlain by thin beds of iron-magnesium clays at the top of the image. Thedark material is a remnant of an overlying layer of basaltic sand that has been partlyeroded away by the wind.The lower-right panel shows phyllosilicates with vertically layered compositions in MawrthVallis, observed by HiRISE (presented in enhanced color) and CRISM. The brown-coloredknob in the middle of the scene is a remnant of cap rock that overlies aluminum clays(blue-gray), which in turn overlie iron-magnesium clays (buff).” Other News On Mars - Rovers Are Awakefrom Martian Winter HibernationDecember 17, 2008 Update: Both Spirit and Opportunity started coming out ofhibernation from solar conjunction and Martian winter this week and the Mars Rover teamhad its first planning session on Monday, December 15, to lay out rover missions in 2009.The prognosis right now is good for both rovers, but Spirit really needs a good dusting offby one of the Martian dust devils. And one of its front wheels is stuck and slows Spiritdown.Both rovers are near the Martian equator; Spirit is on one side of the red planet andOpportunity is on the opposite side.Spirit is at the strange round region called Home Plate. Scientists hope to get it to move tothe top of the Home Plate rim, but if it can’t make the 30-degree slope, the rover will godown and around. Scientists hope Spirit can make it south 300 meters to what might bevolcanic vents to explore."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Right now, Opportunity is moving out of Victoria Crater going south toward Endurancecrater and distant outcroppings. If Opportunities wheels and energy keep up and it doesn’tbecome too dusty and lose solar power, it will take Opportunity all of 2009 to reach thedistant outcropping.But the fact that January 2009 will be the 5th Earth year of the rovers on Mars isastounding. Opportunity landed on Mars January 24, 2004. The little rovers have longoutlived their expected lives and everyone wonders how much longer can they keepgoing? Mystery “Log” PhotographedBy Opportunity Rover On May 24, 2004“The image is the edge of a long, rectangular,natural, Martian flat polygonal stone.”This is not a “log” on Mars. It's a polygonal stone turned on edge near Endurance crater,surrounded by dozens of flat polygonal stones that have not been thrust up from Martian soilby impacts such as the meteorite that created Endurance crater (upper right). More polygonalstones are sliding like “logs” into the crater after impact disturbances. NavCam image takenby Opportunity looking south from the rim of Endurance crater on Sol 118, May 24, 2004.See May 24, 2004: Opportunit yNavCam.Interview:Larry Crumpler, Ph.D., Science Team Member and Long Term Planning Lead, MarsExploration Rover Program and Research Curator, Volcanology and Space Sciences,New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science, Albuquerque, New Mexico: “This so-called ‘log’ image is a NavCam image taken by Opportunity looking more or lesssouth from the south southwest rim of Endurance crater way back on Sol 118, on May 24,2004. Out on the horizon is a bright, white object, which is the heat shield where theOpportunity lander impacted the surface. You’re looking at the reflective, thermal blanketon the heat shield reflecting the sun. We saw that for a long time and eventuallyOpportunity went out there and looked at it.In the foreground of the image there is a slope going up to the west and it’s the rim ofEndurance crater, which Opportunity circled to the south and east and turned around andlooked across the southern rim and into the crater to the east.On the rim there are a lot of polygonal-shaped rocks and they are layers of the MeridianiPlanum sediments that are fairly uniformly embedded in the Martian soil in very thinsheets that have broken up almost like flagstones that have broken up under the impact ofa meteorite that made the impact crater, Endurance.Then littered on top of the polygonal rocks are darkish lumps, some of which look quiteelongated and they almost look like logs sticking out of the Martian dirt. The one in theimage is just an upended flagstone that looks like a log.It turns out that the edges of all these so-called flagstones are made of thin sheets thatimpart a roughness when combined with the angle of the sun making the face toward thecamera a little darker than the lighter flat stones embedded in the soil. So, the image is theedge of a long, rectangular, natural, Martian flat polygonal stone.In the crater rim, you can see a bunch of them that have slumped and rotated, sliding downinto Endurance crater. There are some out there on the rim that might have been blastedout of the crater originally from meteorite impact and the wind has exposed the blocks offlagstones.”"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"More Information:For further reports about Mars exploration, please see Earthfiles Archive reports below:• 08/05/2008 — Perchlorate Discovery by Phoenix Lander Does Not End Search for Life OnMars• 05/29/2008 — Phoenix Robotic Arm Preparing to Dig Into Martian Permafrost• 12/16/2005 — MARSIS Radar Looking Below Surface of Mars• 07/30/2005 — Astronomers Report 10th Planet Far Beyond Pluto• 02/26/2005 — Mars Spirit Rover Discovered Boundary Between Gusev Lava and Older,Water-Soaked Rocks in \"Columbia Hills\"• 12/17/2004 — Is Our Solar System's Red, Mysterious Sedna An Alien Planetoid?• 07/22/2004 — Is Physicist Vittorio Formisano's Mars Data Being Suppressed by ESA?• 02/23/2004 — Is There Liquid Water on Martian Surface?• 02/10/2004 — Part 1 - Opportunity Investigating Bedrock and Spirit's Headed for BonnevilleCrater• 01/31/2004 — Is There Living Green Algae in the Gusev Crater on Mars?• 01/24/2004 — Updated - Spirit Alive, But in \"Critical\" Condition.
