August 1, 2008 Wise County, Texas - Recently I read a new book published in July 2008that documents surprising links between Adolph Hitler’s Nazi Third Reich (1933 to 1945empire) in Germany - and America’s banks, business owners, political power-brokers andwars - past and present.The new book is entitled, The Rise of the Fourth Reich by New York Times best-sellingauthor, Jim Marrs. Jim has been tracking down facts and trying to make sense of Americanpolitical history since his college days as a journalism major at the University of NorthTexas in Denton. He graduated in 1966 and began a newspaper reporting and editingcareer at the Denton Record Chronicle, the Lubbock Avalanche Journal and theFortworth-Star Telegram where he was an investigative reporter, cartoonist, and earnedphotography awards.By 1988, Jim Marrs decided that he had to put his big file about President John F.Kennedy's assassination into a book he called Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy.Two months after its release in 1989, Jim received a call from Hollywood film director,Oliver Stone, who wanted to option Crossfire for the movie that became JFK.Jim began asking book editors what they thought was the next big, secret governmentcover-up beyond the JFK assassination. Everyone said “UFOs.” That's what lead Jim towrite his 1997 book, Alien Agenda, which has become the top selling non-fiction UFObook in the world. Next was Rule By Secrecy, in 2000, which links the money-power eliteof America with the money-power elite of Europe back to the money-power elite ofMesopotamia – which is modern day Iran and Iraq! According to Sumerian cuneiform"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"tablets, Mesopotamia was controlled and manipulated by non-humans called Annunakithat had their own agendas on this planet.After American buildings, planes and lives were destroyed on September 11, 2001, Jim didhis own research and became convinced there were other truths beyond the officialgovernment version and wrote The Terror Conspiracy published in 2006, followed in 2007by Psi Spies: The True Story of America's Psychic Warfare Program.Now in his newest book, The Rise of the Fourth Reich, Jim Marrs lays out in great detailwith names, places and dates his assertion that Hitler’s National Socialism (NAZI) did notdie at the end of World War II because protégés of Hitler had spread corporate frontcompanies around the world. Further, the United States imported Hitler’s best rocketscientists in Project Paperclip to test V-2 rockets at the White Sands Proving Ground inNew Mexico.Even current President George W. Bush’s grandfather - Prescott Bush – was intimatelyconnected in the 1930s to 1940s with the powers that represented the Rockefellers andRothschild banking and business interests that were also involved in the creation andgrowth of Hitler and his Nazi Party. In late 1942, the U. S. government actually prosecutedPrescott Bush under the Trading With The Enemy Act because he was handling money forGerman steel magnate, Fritz Thyssen, who was helping to finance the rise of Adolph Hitlerand the Nazi Third Reich.Prescott Bush and his son George H. W. Bush, the 41st American presidentfrom 1989 to 1993. Prescott Bush's grandson, George W. Bush,is 43rd U. S. president from 2001 to 2009.Creating wars for profit and stripping civilian liberties are Nazi goals. Jim Marrs warns thatis already happening in the United States.Interview:Jim Marrs, Journalist and Author,The Rise of the Fourth Reich © 2008,Wade County, Texas.Jim Marrs, Journalist and Author, Wise County, Texas: “Today, almost every thinkingperson agrees that the United States is off on the wrong path. Some how, we’ve gotten offon the wrong foot. We’ve taken the wrong turn. We’re into dangerous waters and watersthat, in many ways, are contrary to the liberties and freedom that this country was built on."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The problem is that no one knows whom to identify. Liberals blame the conservatives.Conservatives blame the liberals. Republicans blame Democrats. Democrats blameRepublicans.Well, what I’ve done in my new book, The Rise of the Fourth Reich, is to document andshow that we can all agree to point the finger at the one group that it’s still politicallycorrect to vilify and that is Nazis.But you have to understand that a Nazi is not necessarily a jack-booted, Swastika-bearingGerman. The term ‘Nazi’ is an acronym for National Socialism. That is the political systemAdolph Hitler put into power in Germany in the 1930s. Even though the Germans weredefeated in WWII, Nazism, or National Socialism, never was defeated. In fact, it wasembraced by the ruling, wealthy, elite that runs the United States of America. Thesepeople supported Hitler in his rise to power. They supported Hitler through WWII andcontinued to support National Socialism long after Hitler passed from the scene.The ruling elite did this in connivance with many wealthy Americans who saw profit andpower and control in this system and they have slowly turned the once-free United StatesRepublic into a new empire of the wealthy – a Fourth Reich.WHAT IN JULY 2008 ARE THE BIGGEST SIMILARITIES BETWEEN ADOLPHHITLER’S THIRD REICH OF WWII AND MODERN AMERICA AND THIS WORLD?We see the erosion of individual liberties. If you say anything that’s unpopular, you evenrisk jail and a fine. We also see increasingly that our police forces are no longer the citizenwarriors or blue-clad police from a few years ago. They are now black-clad with the coldscuttle helmet, the same design that the Nazi troops used in WWII.And we also see that Hitler, when he invaded Poland, he didn’t want to upset the Germanpeople by calling up general conscription (drafting youth into war), so he used reservetroops to start WWII, just like we’re using our reserve troops to fight imperial wars inAfghanistan and Iraq. Of course, then you come up through the similarities and parallelsbetween the burning of the Reichstag and Enabling Act with the 9/11 attacks on the WorldTrade Center in the United States and the rapid passage of the Patriot Act and the creationof Homeland Security. The parallels between WWII Germany and modern America are allthere.The big difference in modern America with Nazi Germany is that in the Germany of the1930s, the state gained control over the corporations. Today in modern America, we seethat the corporations have gained control over the state. But the end result is the same. America Without Habeas CorpusUNDER THIS CURRRENT ADMINISTRATION, WE STILL DON’T EVEN HAVE ARESTORATION OF HABEAS CORPUS, WHICH MEANS ANY AMERICAN CITIZENCAN BE ARRESTED WITHOUT CHARGE STATED.That’s right. That’s why we no longer have a Republic. Without habeas corpus in theUnited States today, what we now have is a Fourth Reich, somebody in a position ofpower - the President, the Attorney General, the head of Homeland Security – can simplypoint a finger at you and designate you as an undesirable and hence, an enemy combatant,and they can grab you and imprison you and you don’t even get a day in court, much less alawyer. This administration has systematically stripped the United States of its fundamentalConstitutional rights. That’s bad enough, but what really concerns me is that so manypeople refuse to look at that. They do not want to admit that. They do not want to see itand so they are allowing it to take place and continue.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - The right to petition for a writ of habeas corpushas long been celebrated as the most efficient safeguard of the liberty of thesubject. Albert Venn Dicey wrote that the Habeas Corpus Acts ‘declare noprinciple and define no rights, but they are for practical purposes worth ahundred constitutional articles guaranteeing individual liberty.’ In mostcountries, however, the procedure of habeas corpus can be suspended in timeof national emergency. In most civil law jurisdictions, comparable provisionsexist, but they may not be called ‘habeas corpus.’Modern America: The reach of habeas corpus is currently being tested in theUnited States. Oral arguments on a consolidated Guantanamo Bay detentioncamp detainee habeas corpus petition, Al Odah v. United States were heard bythe Supreme Court of the United States on December 5, 2007, and recently byHR 1955 The Violent Radicalization and Homegrown Terrorism Prevention"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Act of 2006. On June 12, 2008, the Supreme Court ruling in Boumediene v.Bush recognized habeas corpus rights for the Guantanamo prisoners.However, the following month, the 4th Circuit Court gave the President thepower to arrest and detain U.S. citizens on native soil indefinitely.] Bush Family's WWII Business Link toAdolph Hitler's Nazi PartyPRESCOTT BUSH, THE GRANDFATHER OF THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF THEUNITED STATES (43rd) AND FATHER OF THE FORMER PRESIDENT BUSH (41st) –COULD YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN PRESCOTT BUSH’S ROLE IN AMERICANBUSINESS, POLITICS AND MONEY IN RELATIONSHIP TO NAZI GERMANY?American President Dwight D. Eisenhower with Prescott Bush in Oval Office,White House. Prescott Sheldon Bush, May 15, 1895 to October 8, 1972, was a U. S. Senatorfrom Connecticut, a Wall Street executive banker and founding partner with Brown Brothers Harrimanand Director of Union Banking Corp., New York City. He was father of former U. S. PresidentGeorge H. W. Bush (41st) and the grandfather of U. S. President George W. Bush (43rd).In 1942, Prescott Bush was prosecuted under the Trading With The Enemy Act, foundguilty of financial and propaganda support for Hitler and Nazis, was fined andstripped of his holdings in the Union-Banking Corp. Jim Marrs: “Prescott Bush, who sat as a board member of the Hamburg-America Line(ocean liners), along with Germany’s Max Warburg (banking), was intimately connectedwith the powers that represented the Rockefeller and Rothschild interests that wereheavily involved in the creation and growth of Hitler and his Nazis. Prescott Bush, as adirector of the Union Banking Corporation, handled all the money for Fritz Thyssen, thesteel magnate of Germany.Fritz Thyssen has admitted and proclaimed that he was the primary financier of AdolphHitler and his Nazis. And Prescott Bush was handling the money on this side of theAtlantic.In late 1942, the U. S. government actually prosecuted Prescott Bush as being nothing buta financial front man for Hitler and the Nazis under the Trading With The Enemy Act. Hewas fined and stripped of his holdings in the Union-Banking Corp.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - The Trading with the Enemy Act, sometimesabbreviated as TWEA, is a United States federal law, 12 U.S.C. 95a, enactedin 1917 to restrict trade with countries hostile to the United States. The lawgives the President the power to oversee or restrict any and all trade betweenthe U.S. and her enemies in times of war.Hamburg America Line, or Hamburg Line, was an enterprise established inHamburg, Germany in 1847, for shipping across the Atlantic Ocean. It soondeveloped into the largest German, and at times, world's largest shippingcompany, serving the market created by German immigration to the UnitedSta tes."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Hamburg America Line lost almost the entirety of its fleet twice, as a result ofeach of World War I and World War II. During Prescott Bush's tenure asDirector of Hamburg America Line, the company came under investigation inthe U.S. for Nazi propaganda activities linked to German steel magnate, FritzThyssen.Business links with Fritz Thyssen: Harriman Bank was the main Wall Streetpartner for several German companies and the varied U.S. financial interestsof Fritz Thyssen. Thyssen had been an early financial backer of the Naziparty, but later denounced Hitler and fled Germany. He was later jailed by theNazis for his opposition to the Nazi regime.Business transactions with Germany were not illegal until Hitler declared waron the United States on December 11, 1941. Six days after the attack on PearlHarbor, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt signed the Trading With theEnemy Act after it had been made public that U.S. companies were doingbusiness with the declared enemy of the United States. On October 20, 1942,the U.S. government ordered the seizure of German banking operations inNew York City and seized property under the Trading with the Enemy Act.The order cited only the Union Banking Corporation (UBC), of whichPrescott Bush was a director.] Modern Al Qaeda Terrorist Linkto Nazis and Muslim BrotherhoodI THOUGHT ONE OF THE GREATEST IRONIES IN YOUR ENTIRE BOOK BEGINSON PAGE 207 WHEN YOU SAY, ‘TODAY’S TERRORIST GROUPS CAN BE TRACEDRIGHT BACK TO THE NAZIS.’ WHO IS BIN LADEN IN RELATIONSHIP TO THEHISTORY BETWEEN GERMANY, THE UNITED STATES AND SAUDI ARABIA?Right. Well, what you’ll find out in my new book, The Rise of the Fourth Reich, is thatOsama Bin Laden was recruited into the Muslim Brotherhood back in the 1970s. TheMuslim Brotherhood was created in Egypt back in the 1930s, but by the late 1930s hadbeen pretty well taken over by a Nazi organization. A leader of the Muslim Brotherhoodwas a great admirer of Hitler.ISN’T IT TRUE THAT ALLEN DULLES, THEN DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRALINTELLIGENCE AGENCY IN THE 1950S, ARRANGED TO HAVE THE NAZIS OFTHE MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD TRANSFERRED TO SAUDI ARABIA?Allen Welsh Dulles (April 7, 1893 – January 29, 1969)was the first civilian and longest serving (1953-1961) Director of Central Intelligence (CIA)and a member of the Warren Commission that investigated the November 22, 1963,assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Between active government service,Dulles was a corporate lawyer and partner at Sullivan & Cromwell. His brother,John Foster Dulles (February 25, 1888 – May 24, 1959) served as U.S. Secretaryof State under President Dwight D. Eisenhower from 1953 to 1959.That’s correct. During the war, any serviceman who served in North Africa wouldprobably believe that we had as much problems with the Arabs there as we had with theNazis because the Arabs, through the Muslim Brotherhood, had aligned themselves with"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"the Nazis.But we managed to overcome that and we defeated the Nazis in WWII, so the MuslimBrotherhood was then picked up by British intelligence at the end of the war. But then ashort time later, they were passed along to our CIA, which at that time was headed byAllen Dulles. His brother, John Foster Dulles, was Secretary of State under Eisenhower.The two Dulles brothers were the attorneys for Cromwell and Sullivan, which was the lawfirm that represented the Schroder Bank and the Rockefeller-Schroeder InvestmentCorporation - the very nexus of business connections that supported the Nazis.So, they were instrumental in bringing Nazis over to the United States under ProjectPaperclip (V-2 rockets at White Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico) and other programsat the end of the war and white-washing their Nazi records. This is what put a hugenucleus of National Socialists right into our military-industrial complex where it spread outand is trying to gain control today. America's CIA Trained Saudi MuslimBrotherhood in AfghanistanISN’T IT TRUE THAT BY 1979, THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY TOOKTHE NAZI SAUDI MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD TO AFGHANISTAN TO FIGHT WITHTHE SOVIETS AND THEY BECAME THE MUJAHIDEEN, WHICH IN THE MODERNWORLD TODAY ARE ONE AND THE SAME AS AL QAEDA? [ Editor's Note: TheMujahideen are Muslims involved in a jihad, fighting a war or involved in a struggle.]That’s absolutely correct. When we took the Muslim Brotherhood into Afghanistan in the1980s to fight against the Russian incursion there, the Muslim Brotherhood had alreadyobtained a pretty bad name. They were originally thrown out of Egypt by Gamal Nasserbecause of their violence, but they were predominantly extremist Wahhabi Muslims. As aresult, they were taken in by Saudi Arabia. This is still the predominant faction in SaudiArabia today and, of course, this is where Osama Bin Laden entered the picture. [ Editor'sNote: Gamal Abdel Nasser (January 15, 1918 to September 28, 1970) was President ofEgypt from 1956 until his death.]Then after the Soviets left Afghanistan during the Clinton years when we had the was inKosovo, we find that it was the Al Qaeda that was funding and training the KosovoLiberation Army, which was the faction that the United States supported. So, we can seethat the CIA was involved with, if not controlling, Al Qaeda all the way up until theGeorge Bush II administration. I think that should cause every thinking person to take avery serious second look at the attacks of 9/11.WHY DO YOU THINK THAT THE CURRENT BUSH AND FORMER BUSHACTUALLY WENT INTO IRAQ?(laughs) Well, of course, there is the question of the oil. But I don’t think that is the realreason because we were getting only 16% of our imported oil from Iraq prior to ourinvasion and we aren’t even getting that now because they keep blowing up the pipelines.That’s also the sticking point even with our little puppet government that we put in powerover there is they are dragging their feet on the relinquishing the rights to all their oil to us.They have pretty much gone along with everything else, but they still don’t want to giveup all their oil rights. So, I don’t think it was about oil. What Did Bush Administration Wantfrom Iraq National Museum in Baghdad?Personally, I think it had more to do with the looting of the Iraqi National Museumbecause I have in my files news articles from the associated press and European mediafrom 1999 through 2001, speaking of ‘amazing new discoveries being made in Iraq byFrench and German archaeological teams, which I find very fascinating because after all itwas probably France and Germany that were most opposed to our invasion of Iraq.When we decided to attack Iraq in the spring of 2003, we violated normal military tactics,which is to seize an objective, consolidate your winnings and then move on to the nextobjective. We simply made a beeline for Baghdad, which is one of the reasons we’rehaving so many problems still is because we failed to pacify the countryside. Instead, wewent straight to Baghdad and despite assurances to world museum directors by thePentagon that the Iraqi National Museum would be protected, it was not and there waswholesale looting. According to Col. Matthew Bogdanos, who investigated the Iraqi"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Museum looting for General Tommy Franks, he described the looting of the basement asan ‘inside job.’ He said there were guards conveniently missing; they had keys to some ofthe locked vaults; they knew exactly what they were looking for; they by-passedexpensive looking fakes. They went right for the new, uncatalogued stuff. Iraq National Museum, holder of 5,000-year-old treasures and artifactsfrom the time of Mesopotamia onward, was attacked and looted soon after theUnited States invaded Baghdad in March 2003. TV news reported American troopswere also going underground to search thirty miles of tunnels beneathBaghdad for “weapons of mass destruction.” What would this be? Why would they have such an interest in ancient artifacts? Becausethis was all coming from the cradle of human civilization, the Sumerian civilization. On theSumerian cuneiform tablets, we find not only accounts of extraterrestrial visitation on thisplanet, but we also find perhaps the secrets of energy manipulation at the atomic andsubatomic levels. That’s the very thing that the Nazis were working on in their infamous‘Bell Project,’ which was a device that created counter-rotating energy and magnetic fieldsto create another field, which could then theoretically lead to antigravity, flying saucers,star portals, time and inter-dimensional gateways, time travel, a lot of real science fictionsounding things.” To be continued in Part 2: Nazi Bell, Die GlockeMore Information:The Rise of the Fourth Reich © 2008 by Jim Marrs,published by William Morrow, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers.Click here to amazon.com.For further information about German rocket research, unidentified flying objects, andnon-human intelligences, please see my books and documentaries in the Earthfiles Shopand reports below in Earthfiles Archive:• 07/28/2008 — Updated Part 2: Why No Military Response to Radar Unknown Headed toBush Crawford Ranch on January 8, 2008?• 07/26/2008 — Part 1: Why No Military Response to Radar Unknown Headed to BushCrawford Ranch on January 8, 2008?• 07/25/2008 — Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell Says Governments Covering Up E.
