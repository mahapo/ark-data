Out of print.Return to Part 1January 2, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Chapter 8, Meat Market, continued.Although Bill Smith had nothing but good feelings toward the Aliens, he wasaware that there are some Aliens who stayed in the background and out ofcommunication with him. He was not sure why, but he was thankful that thoseAliens did. Bill felt shielded from the bad vibrations of the “ dark ones,” whichis what he called the Aliens who struck fear in him, but which kept theirdistance.The Aliens never disclosed themselves as angels, nor did they mention thatthere are demons among them. That subject remained unanswered for Bill. Itis possible that the Aliens answered, however, when they revealed to Bill thattheir primary concerns for humans were for the physical parts of humans. Billunderstood that the Alien ability to move the soul in and out of the bodycontainers was merely a necessary function of their work, similar to movingthe furniture out of a room before cleaning the carpet!Bill was taken aboard the Alien craft shortly after he and his scientistscolleagues had experimented with the bodies. The Aliens let Bill dictate thecontents of that meeting. Bill's first question to the Aliens was: Why do you"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"not help human people? The Aliens had the capability to cure illness andrepair all kinds of damage that did happen to humans.The Alien response was, “We take orders from someone higher thanourselves, just like humans always manage to find someone higher up to passthe buck. So, Aliens, too, follow orders and are passing the buck.”Bill asked if Aliens are both good and bad? The Alien response was: “Unlikehumans, who must make decisions based on what each perceives to be rightand wrong, in the realm that the Aliens occupy, there is no confusion for themin that department.”On the Alien ship, located in a separate level from where Bill was visiting withone of the Aliens, was a man who had been abducted earlier that day. Evenbefore Bill had this visit with the Alien, the Alien knew exactly what wasgoing to take place. The Alien knew what Bill's questions were going to bebefore Bill had formed them in his mind. So Bill Smith asked: What was thepoint of that session with the Aliens on the ship?The Alien replied that there was no point or need for them to have adiscussion with humans. The session was strictly for the benefit of Bill, to givehim the opportunity to feel comfortable working with the Aliens. Thenon-humans wanted to give Bill a sense that he could communicate with theAliens face-to-face if he wished to do so, the way humans do.The discussion ended and Bill followed the Alien to the room where the otherhuman man was kept. The man was lying on the surgical table and wasprepped for some kind of operation. This man was in his early fifties and ingood health - but not for long!Bill knew what was taking place without anyone saying anything. Bill hadwatched and was allowed to take part in several similar procedures that weredone by the Aliens in the past. Most of Bill's internship involved the removalof tumors or fixing other ailments that plagued the bodies of those the Aliensworked on. The surgical procedure that was taking place at this time seemedsinister or evil. Whatever it was, the Alien surgery left Bill with a sick feeling.During that time, Bill Smith was given another gift: the ability to see into thefuture, which included the future of the man who was lying in front of him onthe surgical table inside the Alien craft. Bill could see the man dying, his bodyracked with cancer. Bill could see the man's wife in tears when she learns ofher husband's prognosis. Bill saw the man's three children - two daughters,sixteen and eighteen, and a 10-year-old son. Bill witnessed the agony that theman and his wife would go through as they struggled with how to break themedical news to their children. Bill then saw the devastation on the faces ofthe children when they were told.Bill did not want to see any more. All he could think about was his own familyand how each would be affected if that happened to him or any one of them.Bill was angry. He shouted at the Aliens: “How could you do an evil thing likethis? Are you angels from Hell?”The Aliens reminded Bill that it was not their will to do anything bad or good,but that it was the Aliens' job to do what was told to them to do. The Alienssaid they could not elaborate more about that, but hinted that there was moreat stake in that particular family than just the dying husband and father.Like many things that the Aliens still have to reveal to Bill Smith, Bill was notyet ready to understand the full implication of that incident. Still, Bill's biggestquestion was why are the Aliens revealing all this good and bad stuff to him?Was Bill expected to be a liaison between the Aliens and humans? How couldBill, now that he perceives all that is happening to be madness? Until thatmedical episode, most of what was revealed to Bill he thought was positiveand good.Are there invisible requisition orders stamped on people's foreheads, whichindicate what each is to have done on them? How do the Aliens determinewho gets a tumor or who has one removed? Bill had not yet reached the levelwhere he had that kind of knowledge. Each new step that the Aliens took Billthrough, the Aliens allowed him time to adjust. Some lessons required moretime than others did. The idea of taking a healthy human being and makinghim or her ill was one of the tougher lessons that Bill Smith had to get through."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"*****Chapter 9The Journey to Another PlanetBill Smith was told he would be going to another planet for two months andthat he should make arrangements with his family and the committee. His wifewas acclimated to the level of security he worked under and accepted hisword that he could not disclose where he was going. But she was a bitperplexed that Bill would be unable to have communications with her and thethree children for the full two months. In the past, Bill always found ways tocommunicate with her.The committee members, who saw very little of him anyway, were indifferentabout his sabbatical. His superiors were very excited about his going andasked if the Aliens would let him take a video camera with him. He told themthat he did not need to ask the Aliens about that. Bill already knew the answerbecause he did not need to be physically present with the Aliens in order forthem to give Bill answers or instructions. All Bill needed was to have aquestion on his mind. If the question was pressing, Bill received the answer toit instantly in his mind.While Bill was away, the committee decided it needed to make a fewdiscoveries on its own. The scientists had no other choice. Independentresearch was either possible or the committee should disband, since it wasobvious to the superiors that the scientists were adding little to the programwhen compared to Bill Smith's contributions. Tim alluded to the fact that thecommittee was ignored by the Aliens because of the group's lack ofenthusiasm, which had dwindled over the years. Although Tim had the mostrespect for Bill Smith,Tim still felt that Bill needed a little competition fromthe committee. “Why should the scientists be his lackeys?” Tim asked hiscolleagues.Tim was certain the committee as a whole would make more progress if theywere running on more than one cylinder. Bill was the only cylinder that wasconsistently firing. The rest of the group was just along for the ride. Thescientists needed to fire up their own cylinder, or cylinders. Tim had an ideaabout how to do it.His plan was that the four of them who originally had experienced beinginside the bodies should come up with a new project that would involve theuse of the bodies. Tim suggested the scientists make a bold move and go on amission while inhabiting the bodies. Tim was the only one of the four who wasexcited about that venture. The other three, as well as the rest of thecommittee, thought it was too risky to enter the bodies without the aid of BillSmith. Tim told the committee that the group was doing exactly what he hadpointed out earlier: their group of scientists had become too scared to doanything on their own. Tim was willing to take the risk and wanted to knowwho else was willing to move ahead with the program. The problem that Timfaced was that most in the committee had become completely dependent onBill. Some of them had expressed the fear that the Aliens were not even thereto monitor the committee's activities when Bill was not around.Two and a half weeks passed and Tim was not able to convince anyone in thecommittee to join him. Tim knew it was pointless for him to do it alone. Timnoticed that in those two and a half weeks that the committee was in turmoiland could not agree in what direction to go, that the military did not seize thatindecisive opportunity to take control of the bodies. What made it moreinteresting was that the General who was adamant about getting possession ofthe bodies a few months earlier no longer showed any interest in them. Timknew it was not like the military to pass up that kind of opportunity, especiallyafter getting clearance from the majority of the committee.Tim concluded that the General was still under the influence of the Aliens, asBill Smith had suggested. Therefore, Tim's intuition that the Aliens were stillpresent and watching them must have been correct. If that were the case, Timand the others would not be in any danger by entering into the bodies. WhenBill first told Tim that the Aliens were watching the committee and all of theiractivities, Tim wanted to believe Bill, but remained skeptical since Tim wasunable to see the Aliens himself.Tim came to the conclusion that the Aliens were, in fact, not just watching thescientists, but were present with the group in the same room when Tim and the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"committee were having their meetings. Tim intuited that the Aliens weresilently placing ideas and strategy into the minds of the committee members.That was the conclusion Tim came to when during one committee meeting, hehad a revelation that he would have an encounter with the Aliens that night.That evening, as he expected, Tim found himself in a spacecraft. The craftwas nothing like Bill had described. It was so fantastic that Tim wasconvinced he would not be able to describe it correctly to the committeeeither. The Aliens told Tim that Bill Smith never was on this particular craftand that was partly why Bill could not describe it. The real reason that neitherBill nor Tim nor any other human can describe the inside of an Alien craftaccurately is because the craft never remains the same. The interior of theAlien ships is in a constant state of flux. The change is so subtle that thehuman mind is fooled. The environment that Tim was surrounded by changedmore than twelve times while he was there. Yet, Tim was not aware that itchanged at all. Tim was on board the craft less than one hour, but that nightwas the longest in his life. The Aliens revealed more to Tim on his firstconscious abduction than the Aliens had revealed to Bill Smith. Tim hadbenefited from what Bill had already learned and was prepared for moreinformation from the Aliens.Tim did not see the exterior of the craft, but from what he observed of theship's interior, it had to be at least as big as two football fields. Unlike some ofthe shows on television, there were no Aliens coming and going in thehallways or lounging around in an interstellar bar lounge. Apparently, theseAliens stay in one location for long periods of time. These Aliens did not seemto be concerned with taking coffee breaks and gossiping about co-workers or“doing lunch.” Alien lifestyle is light years different from how humans carryon their daily activities. The size of the craft indicated to Tim that there had tobe hundreds of Aliens on board - what other purpose could such a big crafthave? It did not appear that the Aliens were ferrying humans around. Therewere none on board that Tim could see. It was possible that just as Tim wasunaware of the changing features of the craft that he was also unaware of allthe Aliens that reside inside the ship.As Tim explored the craft, he saw on several occasions Aliens in the distance.But once Tim walked to where the Aliens had been, they were no longerthere.Tim remembered that this Alien craft had a huge inner court or atrium thatwas about eleven stories high. At the top was a clear bubble, a huge windowto outer space. It also served to magnify the size and brilliance of the stars.The ship was not in motion - or at least Tim did not think it was. If it were inmotion, Tim felt no sensation of movement.Looking out through the top of the atrium, Tim had a spectacular view of theEarth and the moon. Tim was located on a level about half way to the top ofthe craft. Still, the method or type of glass used for the atrium cover made itlook as if the stars and the planet Earth drifted in front of his face. It was sowonderful that he could have stayed there forever.Tim was marveling at the stars when an Alien approached him. He was notcaught off guard by the Alien - he was aware the Alien was nearing and hearda comforting voice tell him not to be afraid, even before the Alien appeared.The voice was telepathic and sounded human, not metallic as some abducteessaid in past interviews. By the time the Alien arrived and greeted him, Timwas completely in a relaxed state of mind. What helped Tim keep hiscomposure was the fact that the Alien revealed the many encounters theyalready had with Tim. The Alien triggered something in Tim's memory andTim realized he knew that Alien.Still, this was more than a mind-opening experience. Tim fought hard tomaintain composure. He was grateful that the Aliens talked to himtelepathically. If Tim had to speak through his mouth, the Alien would haveheard the chattering of his teeth. That bugged Tim. He always thought therewas little that could scare him. Now he knew better - and from that night on,Tim was not as cocky as he used to be.The next day, Tim told the committee about his contact with the Aliens. Hetold his colleagues that the Aliens want the scientists to enter into the bodiesand cry out an assignment for the Aliens. The instructions given were to go toa house that was in one of the suburbs of a city not far from the committee'sbase. The name of the city was deleted from the report. The scientists were to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"take a van and some of the objects and equipment from the craft. There wasno list given to Tim by the Aliens about what he needed for the mission. Timintuitively knew what to take when he entered the craft. and he informed thescientists that they did not need to worry about using the equipment totransfer themselves from one body to the next. The Aliens, Tim explained,would monitor the group the whole time.Again, the committee members were miffed for being excluded from directcontact with the Aliens. After all, the committee members felt like they werein as deep as one can be when it came to Alien phenomena. The scientists toldTim it would not be a horrific revelation to them if they saw an Alien. Some ofthem have seen one or two from the first possession of the Alien craft back in1947, although the scientists had only seen the Aliens from behind thick glassand for a brief period before the Aliens were whisked away by anothergovernment agency.Tim actually had an answer for his colleagues. He told them that the Alienscould only show themselves to humans who have gone through a series ofpreparations, something similar to human inoculations.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Inoculation is the placement ofsomething to where it will grow or reproduce, and is mostcommonly used in respect of the introduction of a serum,vaccine, or antigenic substance into the body of a human oranimal, especially to produce or boost immunity to a specificdisease; but also can be used to refer to the communication of adisease to a living organism by transferring its causative agentinto the organism, to implant microorganisms or infectiousmaterial into a culture medium such as a brewers vat or a Petridish, to safeguard as if by inoculation, to introduce an idea orattitude into someone's mind, any placement of microorganismsor viruses at a site where infection is possible such as to increasesoybeans’ nitrogen fixation one can treat soybeans at plantingwith Rhizobium japonicum inoculant. The verb ‘to inoculate’ isfrom Middle English ‘inoculaten.’ which meant ‘to graft a scion(a scion is a plant part to be grafted onto another plant); which inturn is from Latin 'inoculre' or 'inocult.’”]If the series of inoculations are successful, the Aliens put that individual into acertain category. That category determined if, and to what degree, thatparticular human can participate with the Aliens. There are hundreds ofprograms where humans are used to perform certain functions for the Aliens.Only a fraction of humans get to the stage that Tim and Bill had achieved. TheAliens themselves do not know with certainty which humans will emerge fromthe inoculation and at what level until the final stage.Therefore, who in the committee - if anyone - would be next to cross thatthreshold? Answer was unknown. Tim was told that the inoculations were toprotect the minds of the humans and, to a lesser degree, the physical body.The Aliens emitted energy from their bodies that could damage human tissueand interfere with the human psyche. In some cases, the energy the Aliensemit triggers psychosis in humans. There were other elements of the Aliensand their craft that are harmful to humans, but the Aliens did not disclosedetails to Tim.Continued in Part 14 - Primed for A MissionMore Information:For further reports about extraterrestrial biological entities and technologies, please seemy books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities in theEarthfiles Shop.
