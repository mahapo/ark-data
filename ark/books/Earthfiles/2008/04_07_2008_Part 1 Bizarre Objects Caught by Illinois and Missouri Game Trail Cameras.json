Bob in an Illinois native, born there in 1959, and a successfulmanufacturing entrepreneur until 2000. That year, he sold several businesses with the ideaof retiring to his Oregon farm to pursue his personal hobby: protecting, improving andmanaging wildlife, with an emphasis on white tail deer.“But there wasn’t anything available at that time relative to attracting, holding andmanaging white-tailed deer in an environmentally sound fashion as I had been doing since1993. I assumed there were other folks around the country who would like to successfullyimplement a program like mine. So I decided to apply my business talents to producingnon-commercial educational material for this market, non-commercial in the sense that itwasn’t produced to sell products, just useful and very real information. That's how I cameup with the idea for a DVD series entitled, Building Whitetail Paradise. By 2004, Ifounded Heartland Studios to produce the DVDs - and so much for retirement!”Bob Coine, President and Owner, Heartland Studios, Inc.,Oregon, Illinois. Image courtesy Bob Coine.“I found there are a lot of people out there like me, who are interested in managing theirproperty with ecological sound management principals to attract, manage and hold whitetail deer and other wildlife. I don’t do any outfitting. My work is to manage theenvironment and promote wildlife health – not hunting.”"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In order to provide both security for his farmland and to know what deer and other wildlifeare using his game trails, Bob Coine installed several different cameras around hisfarmland.“For some sites around my farm, I have pure infrared cameras for both game tracking andsecurity. For example, if we had trespassers at night, their eyes would not see a flash (frominfrared), but their image would be taken by the infrared camera. Another reason folks usethe pure infrared cameras is because they feel that the deer or wildlife would not bespooked when the camera goes off, since there is no visible flash.”In order to keep track of how many white-tailed bucks and does use his farm and toestimate ages of the bucks, Bob explained that he uses a variety of game trail cameras. Hehas pure infrared cameras that do not flash and take images in non-visible infrared;standard 35mm cameras; and digital cameras that have an infrared beam to detect motion,which then triggers the camera to flash in the visible light spectrum.Six photographs taken in visible flash mode on November 16, 2007, beginning at 3:59 AMover a three minute time span, are still a mystery.Interview:Bob Coine, President and Owner, Heartland Studios, Inc., Oregon, Illinois: “Periodically, we check the cameras during the hunting season just to see what animals areusing a particular area. In November 2007, during our hunting season, one evening wewent around to check cameras. What we do is take a little portable digital camera with usand we swap cards from the remote cameras into this small portable camera. Then, wecheck through it to see if there is anything of interest. If there is, we’ll download thoseimages into a computer.That night, I had two friends of mine with me – one from Arkansas and the other is a localIllinois friend of mine. We were flipping through the pictures on the portable camera andoddly, out of 182 images on that particular camera, we saw this strange, white spec on thesmall viewfinder. We could tell by flipping through the pictures that it looked like it wasmoving.This camera is a Moultrie GameSpy D-40 Digital Flash Trail Camera (4 megapixel). It isnot an infrared camera. But the GameSpy is triggered if motion is detected by an infraredbeam emitted from the camera. The shutter is released with a light flash in the visiblespectrum. The flash is supposed to light up at least 45 feet beyond the camera and we havediscovered it lights up even farther than that.Moultrie GameSpy D-40 Digital Flash TrailCamera ( 4 megapixel).This particular camera is mounted on what is known as a ‘scrape tree’ adjacent to acornfield. Bucks will come in and rub the glands on their faces on the over-hangingbranches. They will make paw marks on the ground, distributing scent. So, it’s a goodlocation to get photos.While we were out there at the site and saw the strange, white speck seeming to movepositions on six of the digital camera frames, we checked out the hanging tree branches to"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"see if anything was there. But we could not find anything. We’re scratching our headsabout what the moving white spec is.We went back to my place and put the images on a computer monitor. At that point, wecould see this strange object with what appeared to be light beams above and below it.When we would play the six frames through the series, just going through the still framesone-by-one, it actually appeared as if the strange, white object is moving.It is really strange because the object itself is ghostly white against the rest of the darkerdigital gain camera image. These pictures were taken on November 16, 2007, beginning at3:59 AM Central. The camera was set to trigger photographs in a series of threephotographs per triggered event. Let’s say an animal walks in front of the camera. Thatwill trigger the camera to take the first picture and then two more in series.” Time Line of 6 Digital Images,November 16, 2007, 3:59 - 4:02 AM CentralOregon, IllinoisImage 1 = 3:59 AM CentralBob Coine: “In the first picture, a deer is triggering the camera as the deer walks by. Thedeer appears to be 30 or 40 yards out from the camera, maybe a little bit farther. It’s just anormal deer-walking-by photograph with that white thing on the right side of the frame.Above : Image 1 at 3:59 AM Central, November 16, 2007, Oregon, Illinois.Camera: Moultrie GameSpy D-40 Digital Flash Trail ( 4 megapixel).

What is odd is that the deer is in a state of alarm, meaning itstail is up. A white tail deer uses their tail up as a signal. Their tail can tell many differentstories in communication with other animals. But in this image, the deer’s eyes and earsare focused toward the object and its tail is up in the alarm position.Image 4 at 4:01 AM."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Image 4 at 4:01 AM cropped to show the alarmed deer, object's detailand “rays” above and below strange object.

In theforeground you’ve got grass and weeds – probably for a distance of 10 or 12 feet from thecamera. Then there is a flattened area where, when we harvested this particular cornfieldwith a combine, it probably flattened out the edges for 20 or 30 yards. Then beyond that,you see corn stubble.Something else I’d like to mention, Linda. If you run through these pictures, which I havenot only on the computer, but also in a videotape of the still frames that I produced for myWo o d N Wa t e r TV show (Outdoor Channel) and my website, you can see that there is nowind in the frames. The branches hanging down that I spoke about before and the weeds infront – including lightweight weeds such as foxtail – nothing is moving. So, it’s not as ifsomething is hanging from the tree and being blown around by the wind. There is no windwhatsoever that night.WHAT PROVOKED YOU TO PUT THE CAMERA THERE?It's a travel corridor and gives us an opportunity to see the deer moving through this area.DID YOU HAVE A BLOCK OF FOOD ANYWHERE NEAR WHERE THE OBJECTWA S?No. In Illinois, we are unable to use feeders or mineral blocks due to chronic wastingdisease (CWD) becoming prevalent in the state. What we are able to do is plant feed plots.Where this camera is mounted, it’s in a game travel corridor. We don’t even have any foodplots planted in that location. There's just the harvested corn stubble and behind thecamera there's a water stream. Reaching Out to the Public for AnswersI put the six frames together so you can see the odd movement from frame to frame of thestrange, white object. That's what I put at my website http://www.heartlandillinois.com and in a segment for Wo o d s N Wa t e r TV. I put out an appeal for anyone who hasinformation about what the odd, white object could be to get in touch with me.One popular thesis from viewers has been a hanging spider web. Mid-November inNorthern Illinois with cold temperatures precluded insect activity, in my opinion. Also, anybreeze blowing the silk back and forth would bend the strand. Close analysis of the beam"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"shows that it is perfectly straight. So, I and others would discount that possibility.” FeedbackPhysicist Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist, U. S. Department of Navy, InfraredApplications, Washington, D. C., has worked more than 30 years as a research physicist atthe U. S. Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) in Dahlgren, Virginia. Dr. Maccabee alsotook a serious interest in the phenomenon of unidentified flying objects, has reported abouthis investigations for the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR) and the Mutual UFO Network(MUFON) and published in books such as The UFO/FBI Connection © 2000.Dr. Maccabee looked at the six frames from Bob Coine's digital flash camera and emailed:“The 'milk bottle' (shape of unidentified object) is clearly a strong reflector, similar to thedeer eyes - or it is a source of light. But there does not seem to be light shining from itilluminating the ground.”Thus, one possibility is that the object is generating light, which also might produce theupper and lower rays that seem to emanate from the top and bottom of the object.However, German crop formation researcher, Andreas Mueller, studied the six images andhypothesizes that instead of possible light ray emanations from the object, the “rays” arereflections in the air.
