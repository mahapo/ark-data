My bosscould not remember the name and when he came out of the room, I asked him and he said,‘Boy, I don’t remember what it was. It was a really long name.’ My boss asked the being ifthe name was part of the Milky Way galaxy or if that was his planet, and the beinganswered it was like part of a galaxy where he was from – but not our galaxy.ANOTHER GALAXY.Ye s .WHEN THE BEING TELEPATHED TO YOUR BOSS THAT HE AND HIS KIND WERENOT HERE TO HURT ANYONE, BUT ONLY TO IMPART KNOWLEDGE, HOWWOULD THOSE BEINGS IMPART KNOWLEDGE TO US IF ITS KIND WERE NOTMAKING THEMSELVES PUBLIC TO THE EARTH IN A STRAIGHTFORWARDWAY ?I remember my boss thought that when the being said that, the creature was stretching thetruth or lying. Something made my boss feel like the creature was not telling the entiretruth.WHEN YOUR BOSS ASKED, FROM A RELIGIOUS POINT OF VIEW, WHETHERTHE GREY BEINGS WERE DEMONS, ELABORATE ABOUT WHAT THE BEING’SREACTION WAS?The being seemed to be upset when my boss asked the question – visually upset that myboss thought he was a demon. The expression my boss had was that a demon was like amuch lesser type being than what the being thought it was. The being was disgusted withthe question.DID YOUR BOSS ASK WHAT THE RELATIONSHIP WAS BETWEEN THE GREYBEING WITH BLACK EYES AND THE 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS YOU HADSEEN IN THE DISSECTION FILM?No, he did not. We only had about ten or fifteen minutes that we were allowed there. Myboss did ask the being a couple of questions that the being did not answer. One was abouthow many areas in the world that the grey beings had landed and contacted? – like theway that grey being was at Groom Lake. Are there other grey beings in other places? Thebeing did not answer that. No answer of any kind.DID YOU EVER LEARN DURING YOUR WORK WITH THE CIA WHAT THERELATIONSHIP IS BETWEEN THE 6-FINGERED BEINGS AND THE GREYBEINGS?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"No, never did.OK, SO YOUR BOSS AND THE OTHERS HAVE COME BACK INTO THE ROOMWHERE YOU ARE ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS FROM THE GREYBEING?Ye s .WHAT HAPPENED? DID ANYONE EXPLAIN WHY THE BEING WAS BEING KEPTTHERE?No, they would not tell us why he was kept there, how long he had been there, or anythinglike that. I think one of the answers was, ‘We cannot talk about that.’WHO SEEMED TO BE IN CONTROL OF THE GROOM LAKE FACILITY AT AREA51 WHERE THE GREY BEING WAS KEPT? WHAT AGENCY?It appeared to be the U. S. Air Force. The USAF Colonel is who we talked to.DO YOU REMEMBER WHO HE WAS?No. He didn’t have on any identification tag. Usually military officers had a name tag. Hehad a tag that only gave a first name, ‘Jim.’ And he said, ‘Call me Jim.’ So apparently hedid not want anyone to know his last name. We noticed the lack of name tags on a lot ofthe other officers who were there, too. There were no last names on their uniforms. Wehad our first and last name on our name tags, but mine was phony anyway.ALL OF YOU IN THE CIA HAD PHONY NAMES EVEN TO RELATE TO EACHOTHER?Yes. We never used real names there at all.DID THE COLONEL JIM TALK ABOUT WHETHER THE GREY BEINGS WERECONSIDERED A THREAT?No, they did not consider it like a big threat, but there were statements like, ‘We don’tknow for sure, but we don’t think they are going to be harmful to us. But we don’t knowfor certain that they are not trying to invade U.S. or check out our military strength. Evenat that time, the saucer sightings were always around classified areas and military bases.So, it looked like the extraterrestrials were scouting.WERE THE GREY BEINGS REFERRED TO AS ‘EXTRATERRESTRIALS’?Yes, they were referred to as extraterrestrials. Most of the time they referred to the beingat Groom Lake Area 51 as a ‘Grey.’DID OUR GOVERNMENT HAVE ANY LIVING, 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDSHOUSED SOME PLACE?No, not that I know of. That’s one of the questions I asked the military man on the wayinto the Groom Lake facility. I was thinking of the 6-fingered types in the autopsy film Ihad seen. So, I asked, ‘Is the being we're going to see the same as those from Roswell?’Our military escort said, ‘No.’Then I asked , ‘Do you have any beings like Roswell?’ And he said, ‘No.’DID THE AUTOPSY FILM IN THE INTRODUCTION STATE WHERE THE6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS HAD BEEN RETRIEVED?It just said, ‘near Roswell.’NO SPECIFICATION?No, the film did not specify if it was the craft they captured near Roswell. The film justsaid ‘near Roswell.’ Now, understand there were at least two or three craft our militaryhad picked up around Roswell that same summer of 1947.DID IT EXPLAIN ON THE FILM IF THE 6-FINGERED BODIES WERE FOUNDINSIDE A CRAFT? OR OUTSIDE ON THE GROUND?Some were thrown out of the craft, I believe, and some were inside the craft. But thebeings inside the craft were dead. There was one being apparently alive that had beenthrown out.WAS THERE ANY MENTION OF THE PLAINS OF ST. AUGUSTIN?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"No. The only thing the military man said was that it was ‘near the Roswell area.’[ Editor's Note: The Plains of St. Augustin are about 50 miles west of Socorro.In 1995, British producer, Ray Santilli, publicly announced he had purchasedfrom the original military cameraman some autopsy footage of two 6-fingered,non-human entities retrieved from a crashed UFO that Santilli said thecameraman dated between May 31 to June 2, 1947, which allegedly was arecovery operation at a crash site southwest of Socorro, New Mexico, nearthe Plains of San Augustin (west of Roswell and not between Corona andRoswell - an example of the persistent confusion about geographic locationsand timelines for UFO crashes, which results from deliberate governmentinsider efforts to hide UFO crash dates and locations).] Roswell Weather Balloon “Was A Cover Story”DID ANYBODY TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER BALLOON STORY BEINGDELIBERATELY USED TO COVER-UP THE FACTS?Yes, they told us the weather balloon was a cover story.TO COVER UP THE FACT THAT EXTRATERRESTRIALS AND THEIR ADVANCEDCRAFT WERE RETRIEVED.Yes. And I asked, ‘Why did you cover this up?’ 1958 at Area 51 was eleven years laterand I asked, ‘Why do you continue to cover this up?’ USAF Colonel Jim said it wascovered up originally because the Cold War was just starting with the Soviet Union.Somebody else in the U. S. government – and it must have been Harry Truman – hadrequested a tight cover on this because of the Cold War and now having aliens from otherworlds flying around in the skies, Truman thought it would be too much for the Americanpublic all at once. But the cover-up was never lifted, and even to this day in 1998, the U.S. government is still covering the UFO phenomenon up with balloon stories and othermisinformation.BALLOONS, SWAMP GAS, VENUS AND EVERYTHING ELSE.Yes, and that the little aliens were nothing more than wooden dummies in extremehigh-flying balloons they had in 1947 to detect any radiation from Russian bomb tests.PROJECT MOGUL.Ye s .[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Project Mogul (sometimes referred to asOperation Mogul) was a top secret project by the US Army Air Forcesinvolving high altitude balloons, whose primary purpose was long-distancedetection of sound waves generated by the turbulence of the rising hot airfrom Soviet atomic bomb tests and ballistic missiles. The project was carriedout from 1947 until late 1948 and was later succeeded by seismographs andspy satellites.” ]PROJECT MOGUL IS NOT THE EXPLANATION THOUGH, CORRECT?No. There were some high altitude balloons that landed in the Roswell region that themilitary did pick up later in the New Mexico White Sands area and even in Arizona. Butthere was nothing at that time in July 1947. As far as I know, there were no balloons ordummies until later in the 1950s. Wooden dummies didn’t even exist in 1947.YOU WERE DEFINITELY TOLD THAT THE WEATHER BALLOON STORY WAS ACOVER FOR THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL TRUTH?Ye s . Why Do American Government InsidersMaintain A Policy of Denial About UFOs and E.T.s?AS WE SPEAK, IT IS NOW 1998. THIS IS FORTY-ONE YEARS AFTER YOU FIRSTSAW THE 16MM BLACK AND WHITE FILM IN 1957 OF THE 6-FINGEREDHUMANOID AUTOPSIES. THERE STILL SEEMS TO BE A POLICY OF DENIAL"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"ABOUT THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTERACTION WITH EARTH. WHY DO YOUTHINK THAT THE U. S. GOVERNMENT HAS NOT TOLD AMERICAN CITIZENSAND THE WORLD WHAT THEY KNOW?You would think the government would have told the truth by now. Through the Cold Warera back in the 1950s onward to the 1980s, the CIA in a lot of cases in regard to theunidentified flying objects did contact and work with the Russians to see what the Sovietshad. And the Soviets had contacted us in regard to UFOs because they had UFO sightingsalso. The Soviets contacted us and asked if we had some kind of advanced flying craftfrom the United States. The Russians called Washington to tell us to keep such flying craftout of Russian skies. But we told them they were NOT ours. Extraterrestrial Agendas?IF RUSSIA AND THE UNITED STATES WERE SECRETLY TRYING TO TALK WITHEACH OTHER ABOUT AN EXTRATERRESTRIAL PRESENCE, DID YOU EVERHAVE ANY FURTHER INFORMATION OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS ABOUT WHATTHE AGENDAS OF THE HUMANOID BEINGS ARE?I know that we have worked together with Russia, especially since the Gorbachev thingwhen everything became more friendly. We know that Russia is developing particle beamweapons, too, from satellite and from ground. We had actually given them a particle beamweapon to shoot down saucer craft.WHY WOULD WE TRY TO SHOOT DOWN CRAFT IF WE PERCEIVED THEBEINGS TO BE BENEVOLENT?It could have been something that happened since the 1947 time period. I think there wasan event over the Soviet Union. I know the Soviets had a big craft go over that was like a‘mothership.’ They tried to shoot it down and the thing shot all their aircraft pursuing itright out of the air in only a few seconds using lasers or whatever the extraterrestrialcraft’s weapons were.WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF YOUR INFORMATION ON THIS?This was through my CIA boss’s son who actually talked to me in 1993. He mentioned thatthere was an ugly incident where the aliens attacked some type of Soviet military base thathad sent up jets to attack the big UFO.DID YOU EVER LEARN WHAT TYPE OF BEINGS WERE IN THAT CRAFT?No, I didn’t. It was a fly-over type thing and nothing landed from that one, so no humanswould know what was inside the ‘mothership.’ But I know the big craft contained manysmaller saucer craft, almost like we would have an aircraft carrier with airplanes on it.IN SUMMARY, YOU WENT FROM 1957 TO 1960 SEEING HIGHLY CLASSIFIEDREPORTS ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRIAL BEINGS, TECHNOLOGY AND CRAFT.YOU ACTUALLY SAW 16MM BLACK AND WHITE FILM OF THEAUTOPSIES/DISSECTIONS OF 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS. YOU WENT TONEVADA TO NELLIS AFB AND AREA 51 GROOM LAKE WHERE YOUPERSONALLY SAW SIX DIFFERENT CRAFT AND THE LIVE BEING DESCRIBEDAS A ‘GREY’ WITH LARGE BLACK EYES THAT WAS DIFFERENT FROM THE6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS.YET, WHEN YOU LEFT THE U. S. ARMY SIGNAL CORPS AND CIA IN 1960, YOUSTILL HAD NO UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEENTHOSE BEINGS OR ANY OF THEM ARE HERE?Yes, that’s 100% right. At that time, there was a big question mark about why they werehere. In some cases of U. S. sightings, they were tremendously friendly.FRIENDLY?Yes, friendly. Then abduction experiences came out later. There weren’t any in thatoriginal CIA Project Blue Book file that I had seen at that time. I know there were quite afew human abduction reports later. Worldwide Animal MutilationsLinked to Extraterrestrials"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"DID YOU EVER SEE ANY REFERENCES TO ANIMAL MUTILATIONS ORUNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS?Yes. At that time, I think it was in Colorado – I saw some of those documents. Differentparts of the animals were taken – stomach, sex organs and various parts - and they were allexcised with a laser weapon of some kind, which left very precise cutting edges (that didnot bleed).WERE ANIMAL MUTILATIONS HAPPENING IN THAT 1957 TO 1960 TIME FRAMEWHEN YOU WERE WORKING FOR THE CIA?Yes, a few cases in Colorado.WAS THERE SPECULATION ON THE PART OF THE CIA OR MILITARY ABOUTTHE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS AND THEEXTRATERRESTRIALS?Yes. The only thought was that the E. T.s were taking various samples from Earth animalsto see what their different body functions were. [ See comments by U. S. Army Lt. Col.Philip J. Corso in More Information below.] Nazi Germany Link to Some DiscsWHY DO YOU THINK IN 1998, ALL OF THIS HAS STILL BEEN KEPT SECRETFROM THE PUBLIC AND WORLD AT LARGE?I think basically it’s because of the German UFO program that started way back in 1917and they developed their first vehicle in 1927. Most people don’t know anything aboutthis. Then after WWII, we did not capture any of those craft. They were all sent toArgentina and to the Antarctic base the Nazis had there since 1938 before the war evenstarted. I think the whole thing is still being kept secret because our government does notknow if it’s Nazis flying around or extraterrestrial aliens!BUT YOU SAW WITH YOUR OWN EYES A NON-HUMAN BEING AT AREA 51.Yes, I did. But I mean as far as the overall picture about why our government hasn’tannounced the truth? Why is it so top secret? And why lie about it after all these years? Ibelieve we have reverse-engineered some of the alien craft and we have some flyingmodels. But as far as I know, we were never able to reverse-engineer the aerial craft thatwas thought-driven by the 6-fingered humanoids through their headbands and fingertippads that interfaced with the entire craft.DO YOU THINK THAT EVERYTHING THAT’S KNOWN ABOUT THE PHENOMENON SHOULD BE TOLD IN ITS ENTIRETY TODAY?Yes, I think it should. There are still unexplained sightings all over the planet. Down herein my state, we have a lot of saucer sightings.THIS IS WHY YOU ARE TALKING TO ME?Ye s .I DON’T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT MY PHONE BEING TAPPED. I THINK IFOUR GOVERNMENT WANTS TO TAP ANYONE’S PHONE, THEY WILL DO IT ONEWAY OR THE OTHER.Yes, they will. And if you change your phone number, they will get right on that.SO, I HAVE TO KEEP GOING FORWARD WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT IT.Yes, let’s get this mystery solved before maybe it’s too late.” Continued in Part 5More Information:The Day After Roswell"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Day After Roswell © 1997by Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso (Ret.).Click for Amazon.com.Pages 180 - 183: “In the Pentagon from 1961 to 1963, I reviewed fieldreports from local and state police agencies about the discoveries of deadcattle whose carcasses looked as though they had ben systematically mutilatedand reports from people who claimed to have been abducted by aliens andexperimented on. One of the common threads in these stories were reports bythe self-described abductees of being subjected to some sort of probing oreven a form of surgery with controlled, intense, pencil-thin beams of light.Local police reported that when veterinarians were called to the scene toexamine the dead cattle left in fields, they often found evidence not just thatthe animal's blood had been drained, but that entire organs were removed withsuch surgical skill that it couldn't have been the work of predators or vandalsremoving the organs for some depraved ritual.“...In those cases where investigators claimed to have been baffled by whatthey found, the removal of the organs and the draining of the animal's blood -where blood had been completely drained - were so sophisticated that therewas almost no peripheral damage to the surrounding tissue. There was evensome speculation, in the early 1960s, that whatever device the EBEs hademployed, it didn't even cut through the surrounding tissue (but separatedcell-by-cell). We had no medical instruments that even remotely approachedwhat the aliens could do. It was as though some device had simply excised theorgans with techniques that even went beyond our own surgical precision.“While I was on the White House National Security staff and later when I wasat the pentagon, I was intrigued by these (mutilation) reports. I also rememberthat both civilian and military intelligence personnel attached to the staffs ofindividuals who worked for the Hillenkoetter (CIA Director) and Twining(Gen. Nathan Twining) working group on UFOs in the 1950s were activelyengaging in research into the kinds of surgical methods that would produce‘crime scene evidence’ like this.“It was the EBEs (extraterrestrial biological entities) who were experimentingwith organ harvesting, possibly for transplant into other species or forprocessing into some sort of nutrient package or even to create some sort ofhybrid biological entity (android).“Although the first public reports of cattle mutilations surfaced around 1967in Colorado, at the White House we were reading about the mutilation storiesthat had been kept out of the press as far back as the 1950s, especially in thearea around Colorado. (Col. Corso told me privately the earliest mutilationreport he read was dated 1951.)“In these reports of mutilations, forensic examination showed no evidence ofcollateral trauma or even inflammation. ...This meant that whoever wasoperating on these animals did so in a matter of minutes. ...It was the EBEs'use of directed energy as a medical tool and ultimately as a potential weaponthat sent shivers up and down our spines because to our minds it was evidenceof the aliens' hostile intentions.”For further information about 1947 Roswell UFO crashes and retrievals, please see mybooks in the Earthfiles Shop and reports below in the Earthfiles Archive:• 08/09/2008 — Part 5: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo, Project JEHOVAH and"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Physicists Oppenheimer and Einstein• 08/06/2008 — Updated - Part 3: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo Links Government UFOCover-Up and JFK Assassination• 08/06/2008 — Part 4: Original Carbon of Scorched Memo Links Government UFO Cover-Upand JFK Assassination• 07/26/2008 — Part 1: Why No Military Response to Radar Unknown Headed to BushCrawford Ranch on January 8, 2008?• 07/25/2008 — Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell Says Governments Covering Up E.
