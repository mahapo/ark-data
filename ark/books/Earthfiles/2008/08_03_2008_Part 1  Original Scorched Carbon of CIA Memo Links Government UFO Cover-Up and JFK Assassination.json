August 3, 2008 Newport Beach, California - In 1993, Robert Wood, Ph.D., retired fromhis management work at McDonnell Douglas Corporation, a large aerospace companywhere he had worked since 1953. That was the year he received his Ph.D. in Physics atCornell University where his focus was theoretical physics and aeronautical engineering.Immediately after graduation, he began working for McDonnell Aircraft Corporation inMaryland, but was drafted into the U. S. Army for two years and was assigned toAberdeen Proving Ground northeast of Baltimore. For the Army, Bob analyzed theboundary layers of ballistic shells. After completing his draft service, he left as a corporaland returned to McDonnell Aircraft, which on April 28, 1967, merged with DouglasAircraft to become McDonnell Douglas Corporation.Bob Wood explained to me that beginning in 1967 during his continued employment withMcDonnell Douglas, he was asked by his boss to investigate the possible anti-gravitypropulsion system attributed to unidentified aerial vehicles.Interview:Robert Wood, Ph.D., Physicist and former Aerospace Manager for McDonnellDouglas Corporation, now retired in Newport Beach, California: “In 1967, I wasasked by my boss to look into UFOs because he had to give a speech on the subject. Andthat assignment resulted in my establishing a group of about five scientists who studied theUFO subject for a couple of years. That’s when I met James McDonald, Ph.D. [ Editor’s Note: Senior physicist at the Institute for Atmospheric Physics andProf. in the Department of Meteorology, University of Arizona, Tucson, whowas convinced UFOs were extraterrestrial, testified before Congress in 1968about the need for serious study of the phenomenon and was found dead onJune 13, 1971, in a Tucson creek. His death was declared a suicide, butanother theory is that he was murdered by MJ-12 authority to enforce a policyof denial in the interest of national security that required keeping facts aboutthe UFO/extraterrestrial phenomenon out of the public and media.]I also visited Edward Condon, who headed the Condon Committee UFO Project at theUniversity of Colorado in the late 1960s."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" [ Editor’s Note: Edward Condon, Ph.D., graduated from the University ofCalifornia-Berkeley, in 1926 with a Ph.D. in Physics. By 1943, Condon joinedthe Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb. Later he was ResearchDirector of Corning Glass, Director of the National Bureau of Standards, andPresident of the American Physical Society.Condon was also Prof. of Physics at the University of Colorado in Boulderwhen the U. S. Air Force asked him to oversee a review of UFO reports and toproduce an official report for Air Force use. From 1966 to 1968, Condondirected the University of Colorado UFO Project in which he concluded therewas nothing to the UFO phenomenon. His formal conclusion contradictedfacts and eyewitness testimonies and many researchers have concluded theCondon Study was a deliberate misinformation project by MJ-12 through theUSAF and Condon to discredit UFOs in the context of Project BLUE BOOK.After that, the USAF's standard comment to UFO inquiries has been the AirForce no longer investigates UFOs because Prof. Condon investigated andconcluded there was nothing worth investigating.One of Condon’s students was Cornell University astronomer Carl Sagan, whois also suspected of replacing Harvard astronomer, Donald Menzel, on theMJ-12 member list. Nuclear physicist and long-time UFO researcher, StantonFriedman, hypothesizes that Menzel and Sagan had classified MJ-12assignments to misinform the public and media about the UFO/extraterrestrialpresence in order to sustain the MJ-12 policy of denial in the interest ofnational security. ]Robert Wood: “My science team at McDonnell Douglas did not discover the secret of anti-gravity, but we worked on it. Stanton Friedman, nuclear physicist and long-time UFOinvestigator, was one of the contributors to our work.When the group broke up, I knew I wanted to attack this problem further. In themeantime, I had to earn a living. So, at McDonnell Douglas I became an expert on radarfor ballistic missile defense and worked on the international space station and other space-related projects.In 1993 after I retired, I heard from Stanton Friedman that Don Berliner at the Fund forUFO Research received undeveloped 35mm negative film by mail that I should see. So, Icalled up Don who asked me to visit him in Washington, D. C., and we went together toget some high quality photographs of the undeveloped film. That turned out to be theSOM1-01 Special Operations Manual. I examined the blown up photographs in great detailand typed up paper copies of the text to share and study. That research got me veryinterested in the authentication of questioned documents. For Robert Wood details on theauthentication of the SOM1-01, see 111903Earthfiles in Archive.Restricted SOM1-01 MAJESTIC-12 Group SpecialOperations Manual, dated April 1954 with War Department logo entitled: “Extraterrestrial Entities and Technology, Recovery and Disposal,” classifiedTOP SECRET/MAJIC EYES ONLY.

Apparently, in laterlife, he told his son, Timothy, that during his work at Holloman AFB, he was involved insome UFO research. The father, Harry Cooper, even had a certificate commending him forworking in the UFO research program, which is amazing since the U. S. Air Force hasnever acknowledged the existence of such a program!Tim says he was with his father on November 22, 1963, watching television about theassassination of President John F. Kennedy. Timothy told Bob Wood that there were tearsin his father’s eyes when Harry Cooper said, ‘They really did it.’ That led Timothy tobecome very interested in the Kennedy assassination. Timothy Cooper started putting inFreedom of Information requests back in the late 1980s for information about the Kennedyassassination. At the same time, Timothy began to ask about UFOs. Timothy had put inFOIA requests to about fourteen different government agencies for everything they hadabout the Kennedy assassination and UFOs.In 1996, Timothy Cooper received a surprise in the mail – a leaked document. Timothywrote to UFO researchers, Stanton Friedman and Richard Haines, to let them know he hadinformation relevant to White Sands in 1947. None of them did anything about it. Therewas no visit to Timothy until Stanton Friedman called me up and said, ‘You live a lot closerto Big Bear Lake, California, than I do. That’s where this Timothy Cooper is. Why don’tyou go visit him?’So, that was what caused my first visit to see Timothy Cooper in the early 1990s. Heshowed me some of the documents that he had received in various ways. I was prettyimpressed. But most of what he first showed me were all xeroxed copies. He did not showme any original documents at that time. June 1999 - Timothy Cooper ReceivedTwo Significant Original DocumentsBut in June 1999, Timothy sent me an email saying, ‘Wow, you won’t believe what I got inthe mail today!’ That was when I went to Bear Lake to visit him again for the second orthird time. What he had received was the Vernon Bowen manuscript – 339 pages thatcame in an envelope mailed from Fort Meade, Maryland (U. S. Army and headquarters ofthe National Security Agency – See Websites below).Encyclopaedia of Flying Saucers© 1961 by Charles Vernon BowenTitle page of Charles Vernon Bowen's 339-page 1961 manuscript classified“TOP SECRET/MAJIC NOFORN DISSEM. FOR US ‘EYES ONLY.’” Received byTimothy Cooper in June 1999, with original ink notes by Bowen in margin.Now partially excerpted at www.majesticdocuments.com. See Websites below.[ Editor's Note: Majesticdocuments.com writes about the Vernon Bowenmanuscript title page above: “Perhaps the most stunning physical evidencefor the existence of the TOP SECRET/MAJIC program is this original 339page manuscript about flying saucers. Written by Vernon Bowen, the original"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"is on watermarked paper with red TOP SECRET/MAJIC stampings on someof the chapters. Most of the rest of the document is markedCONFIDENTIAL. Original handwritten marginalia shows linkages to ProjectWhite Hot, Twining, Vannevar Bush, Moon Dust, and Donald Menzel. A wellwritten snapshot of the public history of flying saucers from 1947 to 1954.Bowen was personally well-connected to many top (government) people.”]Robert Wood: “The author was Charles Vernon Bowen who in 1961, produced amanuscript entitled Encyclopaedia of Flying Saucers. Then a friend of Bowen's in the U.S. Air Force asked to show Bowen's manuscript to some U. S. Air Force authority andsome one there apparently gave it to someone else in the U. S. Army, because it wasreturned from the FOIA office at Fort Meade in 1999 to Timothy Cooper.Charles Vernon Bowen was an advertising agent who spent most of his lunch time in theNew York Public Library looking up everything in the Periodical Guide to Literature onUFOs and flying saucers. His encyclopaedia was basically an unclassified summary ofeverything he had read.We’re not sure where exactly his manuscript went in the government, but we do knowthere were people actively reading it because they were writing on the margins. I’veanalyzed the age of the ink when those marginalia occurred. The earliest date is 1961 andthose were the ink marks made by Vernon Bowen, the last marks he made on themanuscript. Other ink margin notes are dated 1977.The interesting thing is that the notes made in the margins of this original manuscript weredatable by pen and ink and some of the notes identified Harvard astronomer, DonaldMenzel, as a guy who was a member of the inner (government UFO) circle. [Editor’s Note: Donald Howard Menzel (April 11, 1901 to December 14,1976). An American astronomer and astrophysicist who was one of theleading astronomers of his era. Menzel also earned notoriety as an earlyskeptic of UFOs as being any extraordinary phenomenon. Physicist and UFOresearcher Stanton Friedman reported that his own research (includingexamination of Harvard University archives) showed that Menzel had servedas a consultant to the National Security Council.The fact that Menzel had security clearance and worked with the U.S.government is not on its own extraordinary; many scientists participate insensitive duties for the U.S. government. What is somewhat unusual aboutMenzel's case, is that he held the rarefied ‘Top Secret Ultra’ clearance.Menzel's dual membership in the academic community and in the black worldof military secret projects was apparently unknown to many colleagues andmilitary contacts in the USAF Air Technical Intelligence Center.Friedman argues that Menzel's high-level clearance is evidence that he was amember of MJ-12. In fact, Friedman found Menzel's name on a list ofpurported MJ-12 members. Friedman then concluded that Menzel's persistentdebunking of the UFO phenomenon was a deliberate MJ-12 assignment tomisinform and reduce public and professional interest in UFOs.]Vernon Bowen's Encyclopaedia is significant in that it’s one of only two or threedocuments I have that are on original paper where you can actually date the paper and inkand determine it was authentic for that era.WHEN DID YOU RECEIVE THE PAGES FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT YOU COULDSTUDY THE INK?I think I saw it for the first time probably a week after he got it in June 1999. But I gotpossession of the documents in 2001, when Timothy Cooper became disenchanted withthe UFO subject, wanted to become a TV script writer and was really short of cash.I asked him, ‘How much would it take to buy from you everything you’ve got?’ He agreedon a price and he shipped me the documents.SO, THAT’S HOW WWW.MAJESTICDOCUMENTS.COM CAME INTO BEINGAFTER YOU PURCHASED ALL OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT TIMOTHY COOPERHAD IN 2001?Yes. And interestingly enough, one week after I had been at his Big Bear Lake, California,home and saw the Vernon Bowen inked manuscript with the TOP SECRET/MAJIC stampon the title page, I received an email from Timothy saying, ‘You won’t believe whatarrived in the mail yesterday!’ Then he alluded to the fact that a new memo he justreceived had apparently been scorched in a fire. That’s when I first heard about the burnedmemo. As far as I know, this ‘burned memo’ is the only document that I've ever heard"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"anyone claim could be the authorization to kill President John F.
