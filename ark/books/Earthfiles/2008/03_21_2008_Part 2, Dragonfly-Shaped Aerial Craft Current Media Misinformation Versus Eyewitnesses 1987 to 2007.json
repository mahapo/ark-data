Nothing flies like this!”- Infrared Technical Specialist, Montgomery, AlabamaClick for Earthfiles podcast. Return to Part 1March 21, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - After the Big Basin craft, no otherphotographs of the mysterious dragonfly-shaped drones emerged in 2007. But on Tuesday,June 26, 2007, the mystery of the dragonfly-shaped aerial drones took another turn withthe release of an alleged secret report containing photographs of alleged extraterrestrialtechnologies, entitled “Commercial Applications Research for ExtraterrestrialTechnology” – known with the acronym CARET, which contained a “Q4-86 ResearchReport,” dated December 1986, Palo Alto, California, by the Palo Alto CARETLaboratory, also known as PACL (pronounced “packel”).

Three-dimensional image recorder/projector.3. A complex system of symbols and geometric constructs capable of bothdefining the functionality of certain artifacts as well as manipulating theirbehavior, crudely analogous to a computer programming language, butwithout the need for a compilation or interpretation phase.4. is BLACKED OUT entirely. In a separate follow-up email, the document'sleaker – who calls himself by the alias “Isaac” – explained that the blackedout sections had been done by CARET in Palo Alto, and not by him. Isaacsaid he sneaked out the CARET document during his work time for the labbetween 1984 and 1987.The photographs show what are described as extraterrestrial instruments used forantigravity and for 3-dimensional image recording and projecting. The sizes of thephotographed instruments are only inches long, according to Isaac and the document.CARET Document: “Figure 4.1 The artifacts used by PACL duringthe antigravity research phase of Q4-86.”CARET Document: “Figure 4.3 Top-view shot of the I-beam segments.”But the instruments contain a symbol language that resembles what has been photographedin dragonfly drones by Chad in the Bakersfield, California, region, by Rajman in Capitola,California. and by Ty B. in the Big Basin Redwoods State Park northwest of Santa Cruz,California."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"CARET Document: “Figure 14.13 Rotary junction with orbital sub-junctionconnecting to an octal switch.” Rotated 180 degrees for comparisonto Big Basin drone pattern below.Enlargement of symbols on “box” attached to large central ringof the June 5, 2007, Big Basin, California, drone.Original photograph © 2007 by Ty B.More complicated dragonfly-shaped drone photographed by Ty B. on June 5, 2007,near Saratoga northwest of Santa Cruz in Big Basin Red Woods State Park, California."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"In addition to the symbol language, the CARET document has a photograph of rings thatclosely match the structure of the rings in the large-scale dragonfly-drones.

T.technology and to come up with commercial uses at the CARET Laboratory in Palo Alto.That E. T. technology allegedly can control gravity and project 3-dimensional images thatwould look real to us humans, but are something akin to what we know as holograms. Thedocument also implies that the projected image technology can record the environmentaround it.10) Earthfiles • 06/29/2007 — Another \"Drone\" This Week Near Maxwell AFB5:45 AM, June 25, 2007, Montgomery, Alabama, near Maxwell-Gunter AFBWith this concept of an extraterrestrial technology that can neutralize gravityand project 3-dimensional holograms that can record data for whateverunknown reason, here is what happened on Monday, June 25th, 2007, 6 milesfrom Maxwell AFB and its Gunter AFB Annex in Montgomery, Alabama. Theeyewitness is a long-time technical specialist in security and educated aboutinfrared frequency technologies. Because his work is highly sensitive, he hasasked that I not use his actual name. Early Monday morning, June 25, 2007, at5:45 AM, he was on duty in his security work that involves 32 infraredcameras.[ Editor's Note - Wikipedia: “Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base isa United States Air Force (USAF) facility at Montgomery,Alabama.

Southeast of Bir mingham i n Montgomery,Alabama, is Maxwell-Gunter Air Force Base. Near there on June 25, 2007,the infrared security technician had a close encounterwith an aerial dragonfly drone.Here now is a brief excerpt from an interview I did with him after hisencounter with an aerial dragonfly-shaped drone.Interview:Infrared technical specialist in security, Montgomery, Alabama, nearMaxwell AFB, June 25, 2007: “The cameras I was telling you about aremounted up high within 20 or 30 feet. I was doing a regular check when Inoticed beside a tree what looked like a ring. I could look up and I could seethis thing. It was not attached to the tree. It was not in the tree. It was to theside of the tree. And it had these long wires that stuck out of the top and justsort of curved and went up and disappeared. Looked like they just sort offaded out. They didn't stop. They just faded out.And as I looked at it at an angle, I could see it looked like a tail on ahelicopter shaped like fan blades - like a ceiling fan. And I thought, ‘This isweird!’ I could see because of the light from street lights - we have streetlights in the area, a lot of high mercury vapor lights - I could see patterns onthe bottom of it that looked like blotches, or looked like some type ofhieroglyphics. I stood there and looked at it for awhile. It did not move. It didnot make any noise at all.When I saw it, I went, ‘Oh, my God!’ This thing was like staring at me. It justgave me the heebie jeebies.SO YOU HAD THE FEELING THAT THIS THING MIGHT ACTUALLY BEMONITORING YOU SPECIFICALLY?Exactly. And doing that kind of work myself, I know what it feels like to beunder surveillance. I have night vision equipment. I have all this other stuffand that's what I do, and I felt like this thing was watching me. I had this gutfeeling that this thing knew that I was there and it was watching me.[ Editor's Note: See 062207Earthfiles about 1995 Arizonaencounter with dragonfly drone that also left that eyewitnessfeeling monitored.]HOW FAR OUT IS IT FROM YOU?I would estimate altitude-wise somewhere around 40 to 60 feet up and 30 or40 yards off in the distance. I could actually make out the symbols, especiallyon the paddle part that stuck out.THAT TAIL IS CONNECTED TO A RING?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"It is, right. The ring appeared to be about the size of a 50-gallon drum indiameter.SO THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THIS PARTICULAR DRAGONFLYOBJECT WOULD BE HOW LONG, DO YOU THINK?From the wheel portion back to the tail, I would say probably no more thanten or fifteen feet because there was a large oak tree directly in its path and itseemed to be hovering over the oak tree. Now, as far as the distance betweenthe top of the oak tree and the device, it was hard to tell because it was off atan angle. But it seemed like maybe 20 to 30 feet at the max from the tree.UP IN THE AIR ABOVE IT.Right.WAS THE AERIAL DEVICE ABSOLUTELY STATIONARY? WAS THEREANY MOTION AT ALL?I saw no motion whatsoever. And when it started to move, its movement wasreally, really slow. It moved to the west at a very slow rate - maybe 1 to 2mph, something like that. The ring moved forward with the tail following. Italso had like protruding antennas. They weren't very large, but there werequite a few wires sticking out of this thing from the top.Now, the one thing that this thing did was sort of odd to me - the first time itmoved, it was like a double image.YOU WERE SEEING A DOUBLE EXPOSURE?Yeah, exactly. It was like it moved and you saw it in one place, but you alsosaw it where it was before - like in two places at once almost. And that wasthe only time it did that is when it initially moved. After the movementstarted, I didn't see that anymore.THE ISAAC INFORMATION (CARET) THAT EMERGED ON TUESDAY,JUNE 26, 2007, DESCRIBES THIS AS EXTRATERRESTRIALTECHNOLOGY ORIGINALLY THAT HAS THE ABILITY TO CLOAK SOSUCCESSFULLY THAT IT CAN REMAIN INVISIBLE UNLESS THEREARE JAMMING FREQUENCIES THAT INTERFERE. AND ANOTHERHUGE PART OF THE COMPONENTS RELATED TO THIS DRAGONFLYDRONE, OR WHATEVER, IS THAT IT CAN PROJECT 3-DIMENSIONALIMAGES. ARE YOU SEEING EXTRATERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGY ATWORK?Well, my question is: how can this thing move without making noise? Therewas absolutely no noise at all. It just moved. Something in the air that does notmake noise when it moves is not right.AND SO CLOSE TO YOU!Yeah, exactly. The image that was where it originally was and then the imagewhere it had moved to - I was seeing two things! Then the other one (firstimage) sort of blended into it (second image). It was like it (second image) sortof sucked it (first image) toward it.YOU'RE SEEING WHAT LOOKS LIKE A MOTION GOING FORWARDTWO OR THREE FEET AND NOW THERE ARE TWO IMAGES OF THISRING. HOW DID IT MOVE FROM THAT POINT FORWARD AND WHATHAPPENED TO IT?It moved at exactly the same altitude. It didn't go up and didn't go down, but itslowly at 2 or 3 mph moved to the west. As it moved to the west, I followed itwith my eyes. But there are so many trees where I'm at, it went over a treeline and just disappeared. Once it got passed the trees, I could not see itanymore.WHAT WAS IN THAT DIRECTION GOING WEST?Maxwell Air Force Base.YOU MADE A CONNECTION BETWEEN ISAAC'S RELEASE OFINFORMATION AND ALL YOUR INFRARED. CAN YOU EXPLAINTHAT?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Well, what makes me think that possibly the infrared, when I read yourEarthfiles article - it said this thing cloaks itself, but it can be jammed. When Isaw that, I knew immediately that I had all this infrared equipment and I'mthinking, ‘Could this possibly be the reason I saw it?’ Maybe I would not haveseen it if I had not had all the infrared equipment around me and theequipment had not been active? It was all active. Possibly had it been turnedoff, I wouldn't have seen the thing? Or maybe not? I thought maybe infraredwill detect it.HOW MANY OF THESE DRAGONFLY-SHAPED DRONES ARE IN THESKIES OF THIS PLANET IN BOTH HEMISPHERES AND NOBODYKNOWS BECAUSE THEY ARE INVISIBLE (MOST OF THE TIME)?Yeah, that's the scary thing. I've honestly never seen anything like this before.Nothing anywhere near like this thing! It's so different, but yet it doesn'tappear to be like a UFO (disc). If this thing shows up again, if I have to climbup on a step ladder with a flashlight and get a picture of this thing, I'm going toget a picture of this thing! I know what I saw and I know it's real. I think thetechnology is definitely extraterrestrial. Nothing flies like this! Nothing I'veever seen moves and leaves a signature and then moves to one side and thenthe signature moves from where it was to where it is now and then justdisappears. I mean, your mind won't register that. It just doesn't add up!” Alleged Government Agents TellAlabama Eyewitness to “Keep Your Mouth Shut”A month after that interview with me, two very human-looking men approached theAlabama infrared security technician at his work place. One was dressed in a militaryofficer's uniform; the other was in a dark blue suit. Both had on dark sunglasses, whichthey took off to speak to the tech. The two men showed United States governmentidentification and told the infrared security technician to “keep your mouth shut.” He wasshocked and angered at the blatant arrogance of anyone representing themselves asworking for the U. S. government and threatening him, when his own work is involvedwith security for agencies of the U. S. government.

Inmid-November 2007, she saw a dragonfly drone very similar to Chad’sphotographs that had a long, flat tail attaached to a ring from which rose wireshigh in the air. The craft was completely silent.12) Earthfiles • 03/07/2008 — Mysterious Aerial “Drones”in Oklahoma and ArkansasJune 2003, Late Afternoon, Hartshorne, Oklahoma, and Second SightingSame Week in EveningMelody's sister, who lived two hours west in Hartshorne, Oklahoma, also sawan aerial dragonfly - twice - in June 2003. The strange, aerial craft hovered foran hour near the back porch of her home. She said lights glowed all over theaerial craft, which was so close to her that she could make out dark symbolsor hieroglyphs on the edges of the ring. The dragonfly machine, not more thansome fifty feet away, made intermittent buzzing sounds. Then a couple ofnights later in the same week, she saw the aerial object again covered by lightsat a greater distance.Are all these dragonfly-shaped, aerial craft back-engineered from the Palo Alto CARETLaboratory in the 1980s military-sponsored scientific effort to “achieve greaterunderstanding of the extraterrestrial technology” that the scientists - including “Isaac” -were given to study?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Or did the 1987 to 2007 eyewitnesses see actual extraterrestrial technology, which canflicker in and out of visibility in mysterious - and non-human - agendas?Return to Part 1More Information:For further information about the dragonfly-shaped aerial drones, please see Earthfilesreports below in the Earthfiles Archive:• 03/07/2008 — Mysterious Aerial “Drones” - Oklahoma and Arkansas• 07/28/2007 — Clarifications and Comments by Isaac• 07/11/2007 — Professional Computer Engineers Comment About \"Isaac\" and CARET Document• 07/10/2007 — 2005 and 2006 Memphis \"Drones\"?• 06/29/2007 — Another \"Drone\" This Week Near Maxwell AFB• 06/26/2007 — Part 1: Explanation of the Recent \"Strange Craft\" Sightings• 06/26/2007 — Part 2: Documentation, Palo Alto Caret Laboratory Q4-86 Research Report• 06/22/2007 — Dragonfly \"Drone\" Seen October 1995 in Arizona• 06/17/2007 — More Big Basin, California, Bizarre \"Drone\" Images• 06/15/2007 — Part 1: Northridge, California, Aerial \"Drone\" Eyewitness On the Record• 06/08/2007 — More Drone Photos and Other Eyewitnesses• 05/30/2007 — Birmingham-Type \"Drone\" Seen At Barksdale AFB, Louisiana, in Mid-1980s• 05/28/2007 — Letters About Unidentified \"Drone\" Aerial Objects• 05/25/2007 — Two More Eyewitnesses of Aerial \"Drones\" in 2005 and 2006• 05/21/2007 — Updated: Odd Aerial \"Drone\"?
