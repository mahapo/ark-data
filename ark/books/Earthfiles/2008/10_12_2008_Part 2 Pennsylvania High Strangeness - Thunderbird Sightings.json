[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Fossils from the Pleistocene era have been foundin various parts of North America, including New York and Florida, leadingscientists to believe that California Condors or their ancestors once lived onthe west coast of North America as well as all the way to the eastern coast.Some scientists also believe that an ancient relative of the California Condor,Argentavis magnificens from South America, may have been the largest flyingbird with a wingspan of 23 feet (7 meters).” ]Andean Condor (Vultur gryphus) at Cruz del Cóndor"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"in Colca Canyon, Colca Valley, Peru.

Sumerian ThunderbirdsAnzu-bird is an ancient Mesopotamian Thunderbird whose Sumerian name means “heavyrain” or “slingstone.” The Thunderbird once tried to steal the cultural powers from Enki,an Annunaki ruler-god in Mesopotamia.Anzu, or Sumerian “Thunderbird,” is often depicted with large wings. This 2500 B. C. modernclay impression comes from a cylinder seal in which second from right is Enki (Ea), the God of Wisdomand Water. [ Akkadian or Babylonian name in parenthesis.] The stylized streams of water with fish inthem flow from his sides. Enki is most widely depicted as a kind of goat-fish, so the fact that he wearshorns (also a sign of divinity) and is surrounded by fish is another clue that this is Enki. In theancient Sumerian language, w ater is also synonymous w ith semen. Rising low in the scene frombetween the stylized mountains is Utu (Shamash), the God of the Sun, with rays of light comingbehind him. He carries a knife, possibly to fight off what appears to be Anzu, (“Thunderbird”)depicted with wings. The small tree next to Anzu could be a representation of the Tree of Lifefrom the story of the Huluppu Tree. Samuel Kramer suggests that the figure on the left isGilgamesh with his bow. All of the gods wear horned helmets, signifying divinity.Source: Ge orge town Unive rsity. A Mesopotamian stone carving that depicts a Sumerian Bird-Manhumanoid interacting with the Tree of Life.From Sumerian Gods and Goddesses: “The Annunaki are sometimes depicted as humanoid. At other times they arebird-headed with wings. Often they are Reptilian in appearance, especiallywhen depicted as warriors. Sometimes they are shown as a combination ofseveral types of entities as they all follow the same patterns that repeat in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"cycles or loops called Time. The patterns of their battles reflect reality asduality and the same characters play different roles.” “Thunderbirds” in North America“...the fourth Thunderbird was a blue spherehaving neither eyes nor ears.”Large bird-like humanoids known as “Thunderbirds” came up during the 2007investigation of a large, 9-circle wheat formation in Madisonville, Tennessee, first reportedby a pilot on May 15, 2007. [ See: 060707 Earthfiles.] Some visitors to the formation said the surrounding hills, known as The Knobs, werefamous for unusual lights and a phenomenon known locally as the “Bird Man.” LocalEditor and Co-Owner of the Monroe County Buzz newspaper, Mark Boring, said aboutthirty-five eyewitnesses have seen the Bird Man. The most recent encounter was in 1975,only a few hundred yards away from where the May 2007 wheat formation occurred. Thatlast eyewitness reported the Bird Man was about 7.5 feet tall with the body of a man andwings like a bird and had the head of a man, but a beak like a bird. In one eyewitness case,a person actually shot at the Bird Man. The Cherokee referred to themselves as “Friendsof the Thunderbird.”The 1978 American Folklore and Legend by Reader's Digest states, “The Sioux describedfour varieties of Thunderbird. One was black; another was yellow; a third was scarlet withenormous wings; and the fourth Thunderbird was a blue sphere having neither eyes norears. From where its eyes would have been, there shot two diverging zigzags of lightning.The Thunderers were cruel and destructive, forever on the warpath. From them, the Siouxreceived their spears, tomahawks, and their war paints - which if properly appliedprotected them from the weapons of their enemies. To dream of the Thunderbirds meantone must go to war. Mortal hatred existed between Thunderbirds and water monsters.” Pennsylvania “Thunderbird” SightingsPart 2 of Interview:Stan Gordon, UFO and Cryptozoology Investigator and Video Producer, UFO CrashKecksburg: The Untold Story, Greensburg, Pennsylvania: “I’ve been involved incryptozoology for a long time and I’ve investigated lots of unusual creature sightings andlots of Bigfoot sightings here in Pennsylvania over the years. And the Thunderbird reportsare very intriguing. Pennsylvania has had a long history of these very large birds with ahuge wing span. Some of these reports that have been coming in are daylight sightings atextremely close range.The area up in the northern part of Pennsylvania up in the Black Forest region, nowknown as has had a history of these giant bird sightings for years. Now in the past tenyears or so, people seem to be seeing more of them there and in other parts ofPennsylvania. And in the last couple of years, some very significant reports have beencoming in and throughout the United States as well."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Cook Forest State Park is a 8,500-acre Pennsylvania State Park of heavy woodsand mountains along the Clarion River northeast of Pittsburgh (red circle). It was oncecalled the “Black Forest” because of its luxurious growth of evergreen trees. One case happened in neighboring West Virginia. This was late September or October2007. I interviewed the fellow a number of times who had been driving at 8 AM outsideClendenin, West Virginia, about 120 miles southwest of Uniontown, Pennsylvania.Clendenin, West Virginia, is marked by red circle in lower left corner,about 120 miles southwest of Uniontown, Pennsylvania.The eyewitness was riding down a back road when he suddenly had to hit his brakes hard.Right in the middle of the road only a few yards ahead of him was a giant bird feeding onsome type of road kill, which the eyewitness believed was an opossum. The witness sayshe was stunned by the size of the huge flying creature because it stood at least 4-feet-tall.Its head was above the roof line of his car! The head was very dominant, but not out ofproportion to its huge body. The neck was long and somewhat crooked. The huge bird wascovered with very dark brown or black feathers. But the head had no feathers and wasseparated from the rest of the body by a prominent yellow-orange color. The beak wasvery long and large and he thought it was a dark, or black, color. The eyes were very dark."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"He said that the legs were fully feathered down to its feet. The chest was very well formed,but what was most outstanding was the massive wingspan. He went to the scene afterwardand measured the wingspan based on his estimate that the huge bird’s wings took up thewhole 2-lane roadway, which he measured at 21 feet across.You’ve got to remember that he was very close to this thing and as it moved its wings, thegravel and dust on both sides of the road was stirred up. He said the whole thing wasamazing and that the wings appeared to have human arms attached. The creature hadshoulders and a very muscular torso and the wings were somehow attached to its arms. Atone point, the huge bird-like creature looked back at him in his car and gazed right at him.Then, he said, the huge bird turned away and in an awkward manner ran from the car tofly away. But it was more like a jumping or hopping motion trying to get off the ground.The creature moved about five yards and then the ‘absolutely huge wing span lifted upinto the air.’ The wings caused dirt and dust to fly on both sides of the road as it ran tobecome airborne.The eyewitness told me, ‘I was probably in a state of shock. I’m a hunter. I know birds.I’ve never seen anything like it before.’Washington County, PennsylvaniaThen, not too far away as the crow flies, I had another Thunderbird report from a man inWashington County, Pennsylvania, which is not that far away from the West Virginiaborder. This was in June 2007, so only about three or four months earlier. This gentlemanis an educated person who was cutting his grass in the afternoon of a nice sunny day. Hesees a creature flying from the north northeast direction only about 20 to 30 feet above hishome.He said as he looked up at the thing in the sky, his first thought was, ‘It looks like aPterodactyl.’ We’ve heard that same description from other people. He said the body wasabout four to six feet long with a wing span at least three times larger than that. He toldme he was familiar with all the animals in the area and he said the huge flying creature hada long beak and pointed head that swept back from the beak. The witness was closeenough to see its dark eyes and that the neck was long and thin. The wings were large andseemed joined to the legs about half way to the feet. The wings flapped as it flew in astraight line going in a north northeast direction. He only told his wife about it and wasvery reluctant to tell anyone else because he didn’t think he would be believed.Then more recently, in May 2008, not far from that same Washington County area at 2PM, was another case. This was investigated by a colleague of mine, Jim Brown, fromFayette County. This was on a highway two miles north of U. S. Route 40 from thesouthbound lanes of Pennsylvania Route 43. This eyewitness was driving down the 4-laneroad. Brownsville and California – those little towns south of Pittsburgh were on his leftacross the Monongahela River.Monongahela Ri ver ri ght before enteri ng dow ntow n Pi ttsbur gh, Pennsyl vani a.Further south on the river are California and Brownsville markedin small red circles on map below."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"California and Brownsville, Pennsylvania, are along the Monongahela Riversouth of Pittsburgh in Washington County.

As he watches, he realizes the wings are moving. He pulls offto the side of the road to get a better look and this large object is coming down and herealizes it’s a big bird about 100 feet overhead at that point. It was gliding, getting lower,looking more like a giant bat than a bird. He said he could not see feathers, but there wasshort, grey or black hair on the body. The wings appeared to be a membrane stretchedover bone. The witness said it was difficult to see details because the sky was so bright (2PM), but he said there was a small amount of light that could be seen through themembrane. He emphasized, the wings were not like solid metal. This was some kind ofliving animal. He said other motorists were beginning to slow down and pull off the road.The witness said he watched a man down the road get out of his car with a camera andwas taking pictures of it. We don’t know who that was.At some point as the witnesses were watching, this flying creature glided down to no morethan 20 feet above the road surface and was seen flapping its wings once or twice. He saidthat with each wing flap, the creature appeared to rise about 20 feet higher above theroadway. Then it finally went over the trees and went out of sight.SO FAR, HAS ANYONE SUBMITTED ANY PHOTOS OF THE GIANT‘THUNDERBIRDS’ TO YOU?No, they have not.FROM YOUR OWN STUDIES OF CRYPTOZOOLOGY, WHAT IS YOUR OWNOPINION ABOUT THE THUNDERBIRD OF ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIA AND THESEMODERN REPORTS FROM MEXICO, SOUTH AMERICA AND PENNSYLVANIA?I don’t know how to compare modern reports with the very historic. What I do know isthat I have been getting a lot of reports in the past two to three years and some are at veryclose range and some of them multiple witness reports.
