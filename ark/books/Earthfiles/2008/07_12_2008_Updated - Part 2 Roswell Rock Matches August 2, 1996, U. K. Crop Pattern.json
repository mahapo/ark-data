The carved rock was found by Roswell auto repairman,Robert Ridge, 50, during his September 4, 2004, deer hunting trip near Capitan,New Mexico, 17 miles southeast from the July 1947 UFO crash site between Coronaand Roswell.

Located on the slopes of Badbury Castle, is a fine example of as yetunknown glyph design (crescents and circles) set inside what appeared to be a circle, butwas sectioned as part of the design.Positioned further down the field, and on the same level of ground, was what had to bedescribed as a miniature fractal, incorporating the same principle of design as it's largerfractal predecessors.The glyph itself was one of the best floor patterns I have had the pleasure to witness inmany years, very fluid in it's form, with counter rotational flows evident in many parts ofthe design. The whole floor construction gave the impression of running water, with multi-layering in certain segments of the pattern. In one particular part, the layering was aboutfour layers thick where the crop was layered as one directional flow met another. Twodirectional lays were evident within the design and as they changed direction, the crop was'fanned' out into changing its course. Really wonderful to see.The two circles were exceptional. One didn't actually have the classic spiraled centre; thecrop just flattened itself in two directions within its centre. One of the best examples thisyear, set in a wonderful location.” Liddington Castle Julia Set\"The third Julia set formation appeared early August, in wheat, below Liddington Castlehill fort, on the same night and in the same field as a very different design. This Julia sethas a quite distinct ‘flavour’ from the others, the way it doubles back, but it is a properone, never-the-less. Many investigators commented that it had the most beautiful lay thatthey had ever seen.It bears a tear drop signature similar to July 30, 1996, Devizes pattern, one of the longestin crop formation history.” “Tear Drop” in Etchilhampton, Near Devizes,Wiltshire, U.

Red Collie: “Three related crop formations appeared in the summer of 1996 at:1) Stonehenge (July 7, 1996)The fractal Julia Set was reported in a wheat field across the road from Stonehengeon July 7, 1996. The spiral measured 915 feet on its longest axis, covered a square acreand consisted of 149 circles. The center of each circle was twisted differently.Aerial photograph © 1996 by Lucy Pringle. 2) Windmill Hill (July 29, 1996)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Triple Julia Set reported July 29, 1996, in a wheat fieldat Windmill Hill, Wiltshire, England near Avebury, the largest circleand avenue of standing sarsen stones in the British Isles, constructed around 3700 B.

It spends 15 days at sunset above the visible horizon whilegrowing in phase, then another 14.5 days under the visible horizon whilewaning in phase, for 29.5 days total.(ii) Windmill Hill of July 29, showed the Moon at midnight, varying in phasefrom half to full to half, for just 11 days above the visible horizon, andpossibly at a northern latitude of 60 to 65 degrees."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"(iii) Chisledon of August 2 showed two small drawings. To the bottom rightbelow, we saw a Full Moon and Half Moon with two broad arrows. At theupper left, we saw a ‘lunar phase diagram’ with a central pointer (‘tear drop’):Graphic overlay by Red Collie.a) Considering first the Full Moon and Half Moon, I found using a program fromhttp://aa.usno.navy.mil/data/docs/AltAz.html that one of the formation's two broadarrows pointed on the horizon to where a new Moon rose (290 degrees azimuth) at sunseton July 16, just two weeks earlier. Likewise, its other arrow pointed on the horizon towhere a full Moon set (110 degrees azimuth) at sunset on July 30, only three days earlier:Graphic overlay by Red Collie. This first crop picture seemingly told us how to interpret Stonehenge of July 7, which alsoshowed a variation of lunar phases from new to full at sunset. Its two azimuth values of290 and 110 degrees are very season-specific, and indicate a precise time within any year"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"just after the summer solstice in late July.(b) Considering next the lunar phase diagram, I found that the schematic lunar phases asshown there match actual lunar phases from July 24 (half) to July 30 (full) to August 6(half) of 1996, when observing the Moon at midnight: Furthermore, its central pointerindicated a precise lunar phase for midnight 00:00 on August 3 of 1996, only hours afterthat picture was found.Graphic by Red Collie. This second crop picture seemingly told us how to interpret Windmill Hill of July 30,which also showed a variation of lunar phases from half to full to half at midnight.The length of time required to go from half to full to half was shown at Chisledon 1996 as13 days (July 24 to August 6), which is correct for a summer solstice near latitude 51degrees North. That is somewhat longer than for Windmill Hill in 1996 (11 days), butidentical to that shown at Milk Hill in 2001 (13 days).In summary, those two small drawings at Chisledon in 1996 gave us precise, if subtle,instructions on how to decode Stonehenge and Windmill Hill of the same year in terms oflunar astronomy, but we do not understand its dual astronomical codes from 1996 to2007.”eturn to Part 1ontinued in Part 3.More Information:For further information about global crop formations, please see my books MysteriousLights and Crop Circles and Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses inthe Earthfiles Shop and also see Earthfiles Archive from which only a few of dozens ofcrop formation reports are listed below:• 07/11/2008 — Part 1: Roswell “Rock” Matches August 2, 1996, U.
