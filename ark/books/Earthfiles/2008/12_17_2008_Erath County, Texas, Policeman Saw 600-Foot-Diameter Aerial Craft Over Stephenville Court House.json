Image courtesy TXGenWebProject.December 17, 2008 Stephenville, Texas - Almost one year ago, at the end of January2008, I flew to Texas to talk with eyewitnesses and see videotapes, photos and sketches ofthe many unidentified aerial craft sightings reported that month over Stephenville, Dublin,Selden, Glen Rose and surrounding region. That group of rural towns is southwest ofDallas/Fort Worth. One eyewitness in January was Lee Roy Gaitan, Erath CountyConstable for Precinct 2, officed in Dublin, a town of about 4,000 people only eight milessouthwest of Stephenville. Stephenville is the larger Erath County seat with about 15,000residents.Strange aerial phenomena have been concentrated since January 1, 2008,in the triangular region of small Texas tow ns southwest of Fort Worth. Stephenvilleis the county seat of Erath County, Texas, population about 15,000. Dublin is about eightmiles southwest and has a population of 3,754. Straight east of Dublin about ten miles is Seldenwith a full time population of about seven. Other strange aerial lights have been seen in Glen Rose.Lee Roy Gaitan had watched from his Dublin, Texas, home as a disc-shaped object wasspinning and as Lee Roy put it, throwing off different colors in the sky. But the mostdramatic incidents he described were the close-up encounters of three fellow policeofficers from Erath County between 7 to 7:30 PM, on January 8, 2008. That was the firstwell-publicized night that made national and international news after three dozen peoplereported spinning lights, lights jumping around and even aerial craft seeming to changeshapes, morphing in the sky.Lee Roy told me that none of the Erath County police officers would speak on the recordbecause each was afraid of losing his job, or public ridicule, or both. Lee Roy told me hehad also heard that “someone” in military authority wanted to see a dash cam video thatthe Sheriff was holding from one of the officer’s patrol cars. But when Stephenvillereporter, Angelia Joiner, finally was given a copy of the alleged dash cam video by theErath County Sheriff’s office, the tape did not show the dramatic events described by the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"officers. So far no answers to speculation that the original videotape was suppressed.Now, for the first time, I have been able to interview one of those police officers. He stillwants to withhold his name to protect his identity and asked me to call him “Greg” for mynews report. Here now is Erath County police officer, Greg, describing what he saw withhis own eyes in downtown Stephenville, Texas, between 7 PM and 7:30 PM on January 8,2008.Interview:Police Officer “Greg,” Erath County, Stephenville, Texas: “It was January 8, 2008. Ihad just come on duty. I work a 12-hour shift from 7 PM to 7 AM. I was driving towardsthe east on South Loop, which is a loop that loops around the city of Stephenville. I wasstarting to crest the top of a railroad overpass. As I got to the top of that overpass, it’sraised quite a bit. I can see half the way across town from atop the overpass. I was lookingto my left towards downtown and the Erath County Courthouse (100 W. Washington).And I saw a large, rectangular, black object, just slowly moving towards the Courthouse. Isaw it for maybe three to four seconds.Then I went down the crest of the hill and I thought to myself that it was a rather largeaircraft of some kind. I’ve never seen anything that low moving that slow. It concerned mefor a minute. I thought that maybe we have a commercial airliner trying to land at our littleairport that can’t support that (an aerial craft so large). So, I went further down the SouthLoop and got to about Lillian Street and looked towards the Courthouse again. I had apretty good view. It’s winter. It’s January. There was no foliage on the trees and I saw thislarge craft hovering above the Courthouse about 200 feet above the ground.Officer Greg first saw huge craft above Erath County Courthouse in Stephenville (red star)from the intersection of the railroad track and W. South Loop (far left red circle). Greg traveledeast past S. Lillian St (2nd red circle) to the city park bridge (3rd red circle) and finallyto the intersection of S. Graham Street and South Loop (4th red circle).I went further down to the city park bridge on South Loop. It’s a very large, open area.From there I had an unobstructed view of the Courthouse and there was this craft hoveringthere. It had two large headlights, like on a car. These headlights were about 35 feet indiameter. The brightness coming off of them was similar to a xenon headlight. Those lightswere a couple hundred feet apart. The whole craft from the left to the right – I would call‘wingtip to wingtip’ – was about 600 feet across. And it looked like it was longer back thanthat.Profile of 600-foot-diameter, silent craft hovering over Erath County Courthouse inStephenville, Texas around 7 PM Central, January 8, 2008. Computer graphic illustration based"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"on eyewitness testimony of three Erath County police officers and provided by officer Greg.HOW HIGH DO YOU THINK THIS CRAFT WAS ABOVE YOU?Above me, I would say 200 feet.SO VE RY CLOSE.And distance away from me, I would say a quarter-mile or less.LOW, A QUARTER-MILE AWAY. YOU ARE JUDGING THIS ENORMOUS SIZE OF600 FEET IN DIAMETER AND 35-FOOT-DIAMETER HEADLIGHTS COMPAREDTO WHAT AROUND YOU GAVE YOU THAT JUDGMENT?The Courthouse itself and the area where it was – I could go back and walk block forblock and get a good measurement of the size of the thing. To me, it looked like you couldput four or five commercial aircraft wingtip-to-wingtip across the front of it. It was thatlarge!AT THAT POINT, IS IT COMPLETELY STATIONARY?Yes, not moving. I reached over and grabbed my camera. I swiveled the head around andlooked in my viewfinder. All I got was washout on the windshield and also the bracing onthe window from the hood down to the dashboard was right in the way. I was in the lefthand lane, so I couldn’t stop. There were cars behind me and beside me. I really wanted tostop and turn my car towards it and film it, but I couldn’t. It was too dangerous for me todo that.So, I proceeded up to Graham Street and made a left. At Graham Street, when I turned,I’m looking directly at this craft and it starts pivoting upward at a 35 to 40 degree angle offthe left ‘wingtip.’ It rises there for about three seconds and then it goes completely 90degrees and starts moving away from me, all without sound!IF I UNDERSTAND, YOU ARE SAYING THE HUGE AERIAL CRAFT PIVOTEDFROM ONE WINGTIP UP 45 DEGREES AND THEN A FULL 90 DEGREESWITHOUT THE WINGTIP POSITION MOVING?Right, without the wing dipping low.600-foot-diameter, silent craft pivoted on left “wingtip”from horizontal to vertical position over Erath County Courthousein Stephenville, Texas, between 7 PM to 7:30 PM Central, January 8, 2008.Computer graphic illustration based on eyewitness testimonyof three Erath County police officers.INCREDIBLE!Yes! (laughs) And at this point, another light comes on in the center of the craft. So now"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"you have instead of the two headlights, you have three identical lights. Then the craftstarts pulling away. I reach up and grab my radar, swivel it up into the sky, turned it on andI got a hit. It showed 27 mph and accelerating. It got to about 33 mph and I lost my lock,which meant it was moving so far away I can’t get a good lock on it anymore. At thispoint, it accelerated very fast. It went all the way across town within two to three seconds.Then it veered to the left in the 90-degree angle, it just veered a little to the left and keptgoing. It got out of range where I could not see it anymore.At this point, I grabbed my mike and started to call it in and then I realized, ‘How is thisgoing to sound on the radio?’ I’m basically a new officer. I haven’t even worked there ayear. I’m still on probation and I didn’t know how my supervisors were going to take it. Iknew I was not the only one who saw it. There were people in front of me; there werepeople behind me. I knew other people had to have seen it. So, I just put the mike backdown and didn’t call it in.Later that evening, we met with some other officers in the area and I asked them if theysaw this large craft lumbering around town. One of the officers said, ‘No, I didn’t, butOfficer Leeroy Gaitan saw something in Gaitan.’So, that’s when I got hold of Constable Gaitan and we started talking about it. About aweek later, I was at work and one of the officers said, ‘Hey, I know you saw something.’I said, ‘Yeah, I did.’He said, ‘Well, there are two other officers here who saw it, too.’ So he got me in touchwith them and we all met and decided to do our own little investigation. One of theofficers was at his house when he witnessed it. The other officer was going home fromwork. He gets off at 7 PM. He drove directly beneath it and it was about 200 feet off theground to the south of Stephenville out in the county on a farm on Market Road.The other officer was at home and was in his backyard. He lives up on a ridge. He said thecraft was lower than him and down in a valley and it started going up a ridge across fromhim.600-foot-diameter craft seen from above by police officer at his ridge top Stephenville, Texas, home.Craft was slowly, silently moving in valley below between 7 PM to 7:30 PM Central, January 8, 2008.Computer graphic illustration of craft from above based on police officer's description.On top of this ridge was a telephone pole and underneath the telephone pole was a pickuptruck with its headlights on. As the craft went up the ridge, almost hitting the phone pole.He said the craft just barely cleared it. The big craft went directly over that pickup. We’veyet to find out who that is, by the way! (laughs) But they had one fantastic view of thiscraft. That officer saw the top of it and that’s where we got the drawing for the top of thecraft.The other officer drove beneath it and that’s where he got the color and what it looked likefrom underneath in the profile illustration.The officer at his house said he did see what looked to him to be observation windows onthe side of the big January 8, 2008, craft (in computer illustration). The officer who droveunderneath the huge craft said where I told you it had the two big headlights, he said therewere two of those on each side.When I first saw it, it was blacked out. It had some kind of cloaking capability. It was soblacked out that it was darker than the sky around it and gave just a little bit of asilhouette. Also, when I saw the craft, it had two towers on top about 30 to 40 feet tall.The towers had strobe lights on top of them. The towers sporadically strobed.And there were three towers underneath the craft hanging down 30 to 40 feet tall. Andthey strobed white. Now when I first saw this, the towers were strobing sporadically. Then"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"after a minute, they completely stopped strobing and the only thing you could see was onthe very far wingtips, left and right, were two little, steady red lights and in between thebig, massive head lights.When it left, you could still see a silhouette as it was leaving in the distance, blacked outmore or less.COULD YOU OR THE OTHER TWO OFFICERS HEAR ANYTHING FROM THISHUGE CRAFT?We heard no noise. I rolled down my car window and I didn’t hear any noise. Of course, Ihad highway noise around me, but I heard no jet engines, no roar of an airplane engine,nothing like that.The other two officers did not hear any noise either, but they were able to see color. Thecraft had lit up with color. Also, the officer that drove underneath it was so close, he said ithad no rivets, but it had a texture like a large canvas-like texture and an olive green color.NO RIVETS, SOME KIND OF A CANVAS TEXTURE ALL OVER IT AND WAS THECOLOR OF OLIVE DRAB?The color in the graphics I sent you, that is correct (grayish-green). And he said the canvastexture to him appeared to be metallic, a metal with the rough pattern design. IN A RECENT OCTOBER 23, 2008, EMPIRE, OHIO, CASE, A TRUCK DRIVER SAIDTHE BOTTOM OF A LARGE CRAFT THERE LOOKED LIKE CRACKED OPENCOAL, A CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE. I ALSO TALKED WITH A SECURITYGUARD WHO DREW FOR ME WHAT SHE SAW AND IT WAS SOMETHING LIKECANVAS. AND NOW YOU ARE SAYING THAT ON JANUARY 8, 2008, ABOVESTEPHENVILLE WAS A GIGANTIC CRAFT ALSO WITH A TEXTURED,CANVAS-LIKE SURFACE, BUT METALLIC.Right. No FEMA Or Other Government InquirySINCE JANUARY, ALMOST A YEAR LATER, HAVE YOU HAD ANYBODY OFFTHE RECORD FROM MILITARY OR INTELLIGENCE COME TO TALKED WITHYOU ABOUT WHAT YOU SAW?No, nobody has come forward. Nobody has talked to us. I’ve asked why we haven’t sentmore officers out to check on these things and I was told, ‘If it’s not a criminal issue, it’s"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"not a high priority for us to look into, but we’ll do what we can.’NO BRIEFING BY ANYONE WITH YOU ALL IN LAW ENFORCEMENT?No, none.DO YOU FIND THAT STRANGE? I’M ASKING IN THE CONTEXT OF POST-9/11 INA WORLD WHERE ANYTHING IN THE SKY SHOULD BE CONSIDERED APOSSIBLE NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT TO FEMA AND THAT THE CRAFT WASSO LARGE AND UNIDENTIFIED THAT YOU WOULD THINK THAT EVERYSINGLE ONE OF YOU WHO WERE EYEWITNESSES IN STEPHENVILLE ORDUBLIN ON JANUARY 8, 2008, WOULD BE INTERVIEWED BY TOP AUTHORITIESIN FEMA?Yeah, when you put it that way, that does seem kind of odd. If it is a military experimentalcraft of some kind, I don’t know why they would be flying it over a populated city. Thatcertainly doesn’t keep it secret anymore. If it’s not military, then it is of some sort ofconcern.IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE ANYWHERE ON THIS PLANET THAT ANY NATION ISMAKING SOMETHING THAT IS 600 FEET IN DIAMETER AND COMPLETELYSILENT AND ABLE TO STAND STILL IN THE AIR?Not that I know of.NOR ME. SO, IT IS TRULY A MYSTERIOUS AERODYNAMIC MYSTERY LETALONE WHAT IS THE SOURCE?Definitely. November 18, 2008, 7 PM to 7:30 PM Central -Another Dramatic Stephenville Aerial EncounterThen recently we've had another craft show up. On November 18, 2008, the week beforeThanksgiving, and again between 7 PM and 7:30 PM Central, there were around five callsto our local police department. I don’t know how many to the Erath County Sheriff’sDepartment about this craft. It was seen near Highway 281 and South Loop. Blue-ringed circle at intersection of South Loop and U.S. Highway 281 marks sitewhere couple encountered low-flying, aggressive aerial craft.I was called by an hysterical couple that the craft was following. It tracked along besidethem at 70 mph and then pulled in front of their pickup nose down into the road way, just75 feet off the ground. The female said the bottom of the craft looked silver metallic. Shesaid the spotlight coming off it was so bright she could only see the bottom of the craft.They were so awe-struck and thought it was going to land and they stopped right in theroad way and just looked at it. The couple said as it nosed down, it flipped around to theother side of the road.TILTING UP ON ONE TIP AND FLIPPING OVER THE HIGHWAY?"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Yes. The craft then put a spotlight of some kind, a bright light, on the vehicle traveling infront of the couple, which was a couple hundred yards away. That vehicle did not stop.That car continued down the road. So, the couple did not know if that car knew it wasbeing illuminated or whoever was driving just wanted to get out of there! (laughs)The craft then left and went away. The couple called me and were hysterical talking on thephone. I had to ask them to calm down and tell me what they saw. They did and explainedthey went back to a convenience store at 281 and South Loop in Stephenville, pulled intothe drive and got out of their vehicle. A man also pulls into the drive and gets out of hisvehicle and said, ‘Can I ask you a question? I’m a private pilot and I just landed at theairport. Did you see something rather large flying through the sky?’The couple answered, ‘Yes, we did!’ And he said, ‘Well, I did, too!’They then got back in their pickup and left again to see if they could see it. As they wentnorth toward Granbury, Texas on Highway 377, a couple miles north of Stephenville, thecouple sees the lighted craft again. It crosses the road behind them. It stops completely inthe air and goes back the other direction within a matter of seconds. The way this thingwas flying – you know, there’s nothing we have that can stop and go backwards like that. Shape of Flattened Cigar or Flattened BlimpThe couple said it looked something like a blimp. They compared their Nov. 18 sighting toa Tylenol caplet with the top and bottom shaved off a little.Top view of Tylenol caplets.THIS HAS NOT BEEN PUBLICIZED VERY MUCH, HAS IT?No, and I don’t know why it hasn’t. The local Stephenville newspaper did not mention it atall. The couple and a few others talked to MUFON about it.HOW MANY TOTAL EYEWITNESSES?I know of at least five that I know about. I think there might have been a total of abouteight to ten at the MUFON meeting. I believe Angelia Joiner did the interviews forMUFON.ANY SKETCHES OR PHOTOS TURNED UP?No, and the couple is still shook up and wants to remain anonymous. The female is theonly one who went in to make the report. The male would not even go in (to MUFONmeeting). But I did talk to them and verify that’s what they saw. Public Safety IssuesI have public safety concerns about both the January 8, and November 18, 2008, incidents.Is there anything chemical, biological or radioactive that we need to worry about?Also, the second sighting seems a little bit more aggressive and that kind of concerns me,too. If this thing is going to chase people and land in the road way ... (laughs) ... it’sstarting to be very interesting.AND WHY SUCH AGGRESSION?I don’t know."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":" Cloaking Versus AggressionThat craft I saw in January 2008 had some kind of camouflage cloaking capability. Therewas one man who I think said he was in downtown Stephenville at the time I was watchingand thought he could see through it. Or maybe like it was projecting the sky beneath it?WHAT WOULD BE 600 FEET IN DIAMETER IN THE SKY, FIRST TRYING TOCLOAK ITSELF IN DARKNESS. THEN ALMOST DEMONSTRATING FOR YOU ANDTHE TWO OTHER POLICE OFFICERS ITS EXTRAORDINARY ABILITY TO PIVOTON ONE ‘WINGTIP’ UP 90 DEGREES WITHOUT SOUND.I don’t think it was trying to hide that much. I think it did want to be seen. The Novemberobject seemed more aggressive and was smaller and differently shaped than the Januarycraft. Speculations About Source of CraftHAVE YOU HAD ANY MEETING WITH AUTHORITIES ABOUT WHY THE THESECRAFT HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON THE STEPHENVILLE REGION?We’ve all wondered why it’s occurring around here. A lot of the officers think it’s somekind of military craft.BUT, GREG, HOW DO YOU GET TO OUR MILITARY FROM SOMETHING THAT IS600 FEET IN DIAMETER, COMPLETELY SILENT, CAN STOP AND HOLD ITSPOSITION IN THE AIR, CHANGE ITS HORIZONTAL POSITION RAPIDLY TOVERTICAL AND MAKE NO SOUND?I don’t see how that is possible. The officer who was in his back yard at home at the timeon January 8, 2008, he is retired U. S. Air Force and he was adamant it is not USAF.WHAT RUNS THROUGH YOUR MIND ABOUT WHAT ELSE IT COULD BE?I’m just speculating, but it could be an unmanned probe. It could be from the future. Itcould be alien in nature.IF IT WERE A PROBE, IT WOULD BE FROM WHERE?Not from this planet! I think it’s an extraordinary world event. I think since we’ve had twosightings within a year that I know of that it’s almost like it’s building up to something.Like there is something even bigger coming, maybe even contact.”If anyone has more information about the January and November 2008 craft sightings inthe Stephenville, Texas, region - or other aerial phenomena elsewhere in the United Statesand world, please email: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
