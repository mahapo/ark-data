It amazed me that my name was in the letter. And also, itsays ‘ -1 ‘ to the left of the red FILE stamp at the bottom of this letter. That presumablywas a way of identifying the leaker. We had other leaked documents from ‘-2,’ which wasa different address and different kind of information.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “James Jesus Angleton (December 9, 1917 toMay 12, 1987), known to colleagues as Jim and nicknamed ‘the Kingfisher.’Angleton was the longest serving Chief of the Central Intelligence Agency's(CIA) Counter-intelligence (CI) staff from 1954 to 1974. The CIA recruitedhim in 1947 as the agency was first coming into existence. Angleton's internalCIA cryptonym (codename) was KU/MOTHER. His cover name was HughAshmead. He turned his attentions to Russia's KGB and the Soviet nuclearweapons program with its probable reliance on technology leaked from theAmerican Manhattan Project to develop the atomic bomb.In 1954, Allen W. Dulles, who had recently become Director of CentralIntelligence, named Angleton head of the Counter-intelligence staff, a positionAngleton retained for the rest of his CIA career. Dulles also assigned himresponsibility for coordination with allied intelligence services.]IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH OF THE LEAKER'S COVER LETTER, WHO IS 'AWD'WHO ‘WAS VERY FEARFUL OF DISCLOSURE?’Allen W. Dulles. He was the Director of the CIA, and presumably MJ-1 up to 1961. Hewas a tough inside player. But, in November 1961, President John F. Kennedy replacedAlan Dulles with John McCone. McCone was also in charge of the CIA at the time of theNovember 22, 1963, assassination; Allen W. Dulles served on the Warren Commission,which investigated the assassination, and Allen W. Dulles signed the Warren Commissionreport cover letter."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Sixth signature down is Allen W. Dulles, September 24, 1964, cover letter of President'sCommission on the Assassination of President Kennedy, known as the “Warren Commission”after its Chairman, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, Earl Warren.Allen Welsh Dulles (April 7, 1893 to January 29, 1969)was the first civilian and the longest serving Director of Central Intelligence(1953-1961). His professional civilian background was as a corporate lawyerand partner at Sullivan & Cromwell, an international law firm headquarteredin New York, that is one of the world's most profitable and prestigious law firms.If, as the Eisenhower document says, the Director of the CIA is MJ-1 in the Majestic 12group, who wrote the burned memo? Depending upon the date it was written - and wedon't have a date - if it was written in 1963 shortly before JFK was assassinated, was theCIA Director then, John McCone, the MJ-12 memo writer? The fact that the author says,‘Please submit your views no later than October’ after warning that ‘LANCER has madesome inquiries regarding our activities which we cannot allow.’ For me, that seems to tiewith 1963 events in which we have a Kennedy letter dated November 12, 1963, that asksfor information from the CIA."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"November 12, 1963 TOP SECRET Memorandum for Director, Central Intelligence Agency(name blacked out, but presumably John McCone) from President John F. Kennedy.SUBJECT: Classification review of all UFO intelligence files affecting National Security. AND JFK IS DEAD ONLY TEN DAYS AFTER HIS NOVEMBER 12, 1963, MEMO.Right. So, I’m inclined to believe the burned memo is October 1963 and that would meanthe writer of the burned memo was John McCone, then CIA Director. But it might stillhave been Allen Dulles, the powerful insider, if he remained MJ-1 even after McCone wasappointed to take his place in the CIA. Or the burned memo writer might also be Allen W.Dulles if it was written as early as 1961 when Dulles was head of the CIA. AWD ismentioned in the burned memo and clearly, the writer of the burned memo is identified asMJ-1.If the leaker of the burned memo to Timothy Cooper in 1999 is implying in his cover letterthat AWD, Allen W. Dulles, was MJ-1, then the burn memo must have been written in1961.WHEN DID YOU FIRST HAVE A COPY OF THE BURNED MEMO IN YOUR HAND?Probably 1999 because Tim Cooper called me about it in June and I think Ryan and Idrove back there to see it.BECAUSE YOU THOUGHT IT WAS SO IMPORTANT.Ye s .ANY UNDERSTANDING WHY THE LEAKER SNATCHED THE BURN MEMO FROMTHE FIRE?No. But the leaker apparently was a very senior guy in CIA counterintelligence, a righthand man to James Angleton, meaning the leaker’s name was probably well known. Hiscover letter was dated June 23, 1999. He might not be alive now. I don’t know. Butcertainly when the leaker wrote this letter in June 1999, he was a very coherent writer."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WHO WAS CLOSEST TO JAMES ANGLETON IN THE CIA?I don't know. That's research that needs to be done.IN PARAGRAPH 2 OF THE LEAKER'S COVER LETTER, IT SAYS: ‘SALINAREQUESTED THAT THE MJ-12 DIRECTIVES BE SENT TO YOU AND HOPEFULLY,BE DISSEMINATED IN A RESPONSIBLE MANNER.’ WHO IS SALINA?I think Salina was a secretary in counterintelligence to whom the burned memo wasdictated. That’s my opinion. One of the things I got from Timothy Cooper is a note fromSalina in her original handwriting dated June 5, 1996. Salina sent this note to TimothyCooper in 1996 because it was accompanying other documents that were leaked. I believethis note is the one that sent the Oppenheimer and Einstein 5-page Project JEHOVAmemo. So, she was transmitting other stuff at the time to Timothy Cooper.June 5, 1996, note written by Salina to Timothy Cooper: “At my father's request (‘Cantwell’ -thought to be the CIA counter-intelligence operative under James Jesus Angleton),I'm sendi ng these pr ivate papers. Like my father, I w orked i n the Intel l igence Community.I'm a retired CIA employee with thirty years in CI (counter-intelligence) under Jim Angleton.There are clues to be found in these documents. I can say no more. Good luck.

Tab A President's EYES ONLY"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"“The burned memo really tells a fascinating story. JFK is beginning to ask too manyquestions. We can’t allow this, in pretty much no kidding language. And MJ-1 (CIADirector) is saying, ‘I have some new policies I want you other six guys to agree(MJ-2,MJ-3, MJ-4, MJ-5, MJ-6, MJ-7) and let me know before October (presumed to beOctober 1963) that they are OK because we are going to put them in place. And these sixpolicies are pretty interesting.The first Tab A says basically, if the President of the United States starts to ask questions,tell him it’s not a matter of national security. And then at the end it says that if the UFOsshow up suddenly and we have to admit they are there, then we’ll give full disclosure asthe law requires, which amazes me because that implies there is a law that says they(MJ-12) are supposed to disclose something. As far as I can tell so far, MJ-12 has notoperated within any law.TO ME, THE MEMO IMPLIES THAT MJ-12 ALREADY KNOWS THAT UFOSDISPLAY HOSTILE INTENT AND WHAT THEY ARE MAKING A DISTINCTION INTHIS TAB A IS: ‘IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT THAT UFOS OVERTLY DISPLAYHOSTILE INTENT’ – OVERTLY WOULD MEAN PUBLICLY.THE WORDS IMPLY THAT MJ-12 ALREADY KNOWS THERE HAS BEEN HOSTILEINTENT TOWARDS THE NATIONAL SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES.I read it without the word ‘overtly’ in my mind. But if you put in the word ‘overtly,’ youcan attach your meaning to it, too. So, I would not dispute your interpretation.WOULD YOU CONTINUE WITH YOUR ELABORATION TAB BY TAB? Tab B “NEED-TO-KNOW”The second one, Tab B, basically says some people in the Federal Bureau of Investigation(FBI) are getting to know too much, so we’ve got to tell J. Edgar Hoover that there’ssomething going on. But don’t tell him anything more than we have to and get as much outof him (Hoover) as possible, while we keep our CIA spies in place in the FBI. The ‘back"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"channel contacts’ means CIA guys working inside the FBI. Tab C DoD 5200.1WHAT IS DOD NOTICE 5200.1?5200.1 is just security rules concerning who gets access to classified material. The blackstamp ‘CI’ is counter-intelligence. It’s a stamp the counterintelligence guys used underAngleton to distinguish their work from the rest of the CIA. You have to remember thatthe counter-intelligence people were basically the people trying to figure out whether theSoviets had planted spies within the CIA, so they had a measure of separateness from therest of the CIA. That separateness was very important. CI could basically do whateverthey wanted to do, as evidenced by the fact that’s where they put the MJ-12 program forcontrol.Tab C is interesting for two reasons. First, it affirms the existence of SCEO (SensitiveCompartmented Executive Order) and also makes clear that apparently it's the 54/12program that is exempt from that. Otherwise, all of the Department of Defense has noaccess to anything on MJ-12.SO, MJ-12 WAS UNDER THE CONTROL OF ANGLETON IN THE CIA'S COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE?I would say that’s what this memo implies. However, I would be quick to add that thereare a lot of agencies in the United States and it is clear that the U. S. Navy had played alead role in the past. And I believe it was the U. S. Army that retrieved the CapeGirardeau, Missouri, crash (1941). So, all these agencies had been snapping away to getcontrol of the (E. T.) technologies by themselves. The CIA wound up with control of theofficial program for MJ-12, but I think there are other little pockets of UFO work in all theagencies – some of which were perhaps cleared for MJ-12 access and some, which werenot.ALL COMPETING WITH EACH OTHER BECAUSE THEY WANTED ADVANCEDEXTRATERRESTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES?Yes, I think so. That’s right. They were not caring about the public. They wanted thetechnologies.IS 54/12 THE SAME ENTITY AS MJ-12?No, I don't think 54/12 is the same as MJ-12, but apparently 54/12 was given some accessto some parts of MJ-12.[ Update from Earthfiles viewer and Wikipedia: “54/12 was not in thePentagon. This was a committee set up under NSC purview to review covertand clandestine operations. NSC, you recall is statutory and within theExecutive Office of the President, so it was a very high level reviewcommittee concerning some of the most sensitive matters. Over the course ofAdministrations, its name has mutated ... 303 Committee, 40 Committee,Operations Advisory Group, NSC Special Coordination Committee, NationalSecurity Planning Group.”Wikipedia - 54/12: “Since 1954, oversight of United States covert operationshas been carried out by a series of sub-committees of the United StatesNational Security Council. Oversight of covert operations was brought under"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the control of the National Security Council by the creation of the PlanningCoordination Group in 1954.The Planning Coordination Group was created by President Eisenhower'sPresidential Directive 5412/1 on March 15, 1954. The group, initially, washeaded by Special Assistant to the President for Foreign Affairs, NelsonRockefeller.The NSC 5412/2 Special Group, often referred simply as the Special Group,was an initially secret, but later public, subcommittee of the United StatesNational Security Council responsible for coordinating government covertoperations. Presidential Directive NSC 5412/2, issued December 28, 1954,assigned responsibility for co-ordination of covert actions to representatives ofthe Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and the Presidentrespectively.The Federation of American Scientists list of national security documents forthe Eisenhower administration does not show a directive 5412/2. It does,however, show a 5412/1 with a classified title (one of only three suchdocuments for the entire Eisenhower administration).303 Committee - The covert actions oversight group was renamed the 303Committee after National Security Action Memorandum No. 303 on June 2,1964. McGeorge Bundy, National Security Advisor, became Chairman forthat committee.The successor to the Special Group was the 40 Committee.The 40 Committee was a division of the Executive branch of the UnitedStates government whose mandate was to review proposed major covertactions. In 1970, the 40 Committee played a major role in so called ‘Track I’efforts to prevent Salvador Allende from taking office following the Chileanpopular vote of September 4, 1970.Operations Advisory Group - On February 18, 1976, the 40 Committee wasreplaced by the Operations Advisory Group, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 11905 issued by Gerald Ford. The new group was composed of thePresident's Assistant for National Security Affairs, the Secretaries of State andDefense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Director of CentralIntelligence.NSC Special Coordination Committee - The following year on May 13,1977, President Jimmy Carter issued Executive Order 11985, which updatedthe previous order such that the Operations Advisory Group thereafter wouldbe known as the NSC Special Coordination Committee.National Security Planning Group - Under the Reagan administration, theSpecial Coordination Committee was replaced by the National SecurityPlanning Group which included the Vice-President, the Secretary of Defense,the Secretary of State, the Assistant for National Security Affairs, and theDirector of the CIA.” ] I think a number of people have concurred that President Eisenhower lost control to theMJ-12 program. The MJ program did things the way they wanted. In fact, that was thetime that MJ-12 allegedly started to go and put some of the civilian contractors in charge –sort of took MJ-12 research out of the government and made the government clean so thatwhen you ask the government, ‘What do you know about MJ-12?’ The honest answer is,‘We don’t know squat.’YOU MEAN PUTTING MJ-12 OUT INTO CORPORATIONS LIKE BECHTEL?Yeah, putting some of the responsibilities out into the corporations so the paperwork wasnot under government control and they could use security systems that separated it fromthe government.THIS MIGHT RELATE TO PRESIDENT EISENHOWER’S WARNING WHEN HEWENT OUT OF OFFICE ABOUT THE ‘MILITARY-INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX’?Yes, I think so.THAT’S CRUCIAL TO UNDERSTANDING THIS BURN MEMO. WHY IS IT THATTHE MJ-12 FORCES FROM TRUMAN TO KENNEDY WOULD SUDDENLY BE IN AHOSTILE POSITION WITH THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, WHO IN"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"THE BURN MEMO IS REFERRED TO AS ‘LANCER.’Yes, right. And apparently that was a code name (for JFK) that was pretty well protectedat that time.BUT TAB A IS ABOUT KEEPING ALL OF THIS KNOWLEDGE FROM ‘LANCER’.Exactly. And Lancer in his November 12, 1963, letter is basically saying he’s going to starta program to share all this stuff with the Soviet Union. That scared the hell out of them(MJ-12)!THAT WOULD BE THE REASON THAT YOU SUSPECT JFK WAS ASSASSINATEDBY THE CIA THROUGH SOMEBODY?Yes. Actually jumping to the bottom line: As far as I know, this ‘burned memo’ is the onlydocument that I’ve ever heard anyone claim could be the authorization to kill PresidentJohn F. Kennedy. It’s written evidence that could be entered into a court as theauthorization to kill Kennedy. Tab D Project BLUE BOOKIn my judgment, the National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) probably established Blue Bookin a two-part way. One part was only slightly classified, which is the one we all knowabout. The other was highly covert, which was to take the information we were gettingfrom the public and run it into MJ-12 to figure out how to use it. Perhaps also, they mighthave had a misinformation component. I think the thing that is significant to me is thereference to the NIE, the National Intelligence Estimate. That’s pretty important that theMJ-12 BLUE BOOK/MAJIC actually got in there.MEANING THAT THE COVERT PROJECT BLUE BOOK WAS DESCRIBED IN THENATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE.At least at that time in the early 1960s, which sure contradicts the misinforming publicBLUE BOOK that pretty much said there was nothing to UFOs even to investigate.

And Tab E doesn’t even extend to Congressional inquiries. Basically it implieseverybody (is off limits from knowing E. T. facts). No one who asks, including the U. S.President, has a right to know. Tab F PSYOPSo, Tab F re-affirms that ‘the authorization to interrogate and detain any and all targets.’Basically that says that none of the basic rights that we thought we had apply in this area.THAT THE U. S. CONSTITUTION WAS NOT EVEN BEING RESPECTED BACK INTHE EARLY 1960S, AS FAR AS MJ-12 WAS CONCERNED.Precisely. That’s an excellent way to put it. Yes. Tab F is overt evidence that the U. S.Constitution was being ignored.WHAT WE DON’T KNOW IS EXACTLY WHAT PROJECT PSYOP IS AND WHO ITWAS UNDER? That’s certainly true, yes. I was just assuming that Project PSYOP was the sort of generalproject that tried to cleverly contain, using psychological operations that were standard. Inother words, keeping the public in the dark (about E. T.s) using subtle techniques, such asmovies created to attune the public to various (E. T.-related) ideas and advertisements andfalse press releases – the whole genera of things the psyops guys use to keep us in thepublic confused.IF THERE WERE AN EYEWITNESS WITH PHOTOGRAPHS AND VIDEOTAPE,THEN THIS ‘GREEN’ UNIT WOULD HAVE THE AUTHORIZATION TOINTERROGATE AND DETAIN ANY AND ALL TARGETS?Yes, UFO history is filled with excellent records of two or three guys in black taking awayan eyewitness’s stuff and interrogating them and telling the eyewitness/es that nothinghappened.HOW IRONIC THAT THE MEN IN BLACK MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORKINGDIRECTLY FOR PROJECT GREEN.Right, exactly (laughs).

If you look up MK-ULTRA in the public record, I think you’ll find a lot ofbad stuff that has been released.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - “Project ARTICHOKE was a CIA project thatresearched interrogation methods and arose from project BLUEBIRD onAugust 20, 1951, run by the Office of Scientific Intelligence. A memorandumby Richard Helms to CIA director Allen Welsh Dulles indicated ARTICHOKEbecame Project MKULTRA on April 20, 1953.The project studied hypnosis, forced morphine addiction (and subsequentforced withdrawal), and the use of other chemicals, among other methods, toproduce amnesia and other vulnerable states in subjects.ARTICHOKE was an offensive program of mind control that gatheredtogether the intelligence divisions of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and FBI. Inaddition, the scope of the project was outlined in a memo dated January 1952that stated, ‘Can we get control of an individual to the point where he will doour bidding against his will and even against fundamental laws of nature, suchas self preservation?’Project MK-ULTRA, or MKULTRA, was the code name for a covert CIAmind-control and chemical interrogation research program, run by the Officeof Scientific Intelligence, that began in the early 1950s and continued at leastthrough the late 1960s. There is much published evidence that the projectinvolved the surreptitious use of many types of drugs, as well as othermethodology, to manipulate individual mental states and to alter brainfunction.Project MK-ULTRA was first brought to wide public attention in 1975 by theU.S. Congress, through investigations by the Church Committee, and by apresidential commission known as the Rockefeller Commission. Investigativeefforts were hampered by the fact that CIA Director Richard Helms orderedall MK-ULTRA files destroyed in 1973. The Church Committee andRockefeller Commission investigations relied on the sworn testimony of directparticipants and on the relatively small number of documents that survivedHelms' destruction order.Although the CIA insists that MK-ULTRA-type experiments have beenabandoned, 14-year CIA veteran Victor Marchetti has stated in variousinterviews that the CIA routinely conducts misinformation campaigns and thatCIA mind control research continued. In a 1977 interview, Marchettispecifically called the CIA claim that MK-ULTRA was abandoned a ‘coverstory.’On the Senate floor in 1977, Senator Ted Kennedy said: ‘The DeputyDirector of the CIA revealed that over thirty universities and institutions wereinvolved in an ‘extensive testing and experimentation’ program, whichincluded covert drug tests on unwitting citizens ‘at all social levels, high andlow, native Americans and foreign.’ Several of these tests involved theadministration of LSD to ‘unwitting subjects in social situations.’ At least onedeath, that of Dr. [Frank] Olson, resulted from these activities. The Agencyitself acknowledged that these tests made little scientific sense. The agentsdoing the monitoring were not qualified scientific observers.” ]Robert Wood: “I’d love to know what SPIKE, HOUSE CLEANING, ARTICHOKE andDOMESTIC are. But, if you give them (MJ-12) the benefit of the doubt, you could saythat if there were contamination from an (E. T.) pathogen in the public, MJ-12 wants tocontrol it and contain it to save as many lives as possible.WHAT ARE ‘CONVENTIONAL METHODS’ CONCERNING SPIKE, HOUSECLEANING AND ARTICHOKE?Presumably the less conventional methods are probably less constitutional, too. (laughs)That would be my guess."},{"pageNumber":12,"pageContent":"THAT SPIKE, HOUSE CLEANING, ARTICHOKE AND DOMESTIC ARE PROBABLYOUTSIDE THE BOUNDS OF LIBERTIES PROTECTED BY THE CONSTITUTION?I would suspect so. Anyway, it’s an alert – stay alert for anything having to do withARTICHOKE, DOMESTIC, HOUSE CLEANING and SPIKE. I would like to know whatthose projects were - or are!IT'S DISTURBING THAT MJ-12 WOULD BE HAVING COMMUNICATION ABOUTBIOLOGICAL WEAPONS.Basically anything involving the aliens (E. T.s), it’s clear that there was and is genuineconcern that some of the diseases that aliens might have could be problems for us.IN THE MAJESTIC 12 DOCUMENTS RELEASED AT RYAN’SMAJESTICDOCUMENTS.COM WEBSITE, THERE IS THE WHITE HOT MAJESTICDOCUMENT AND THE INTERPLANETARY PHENOMENON UNIT DOCUMENT,WHICH DISCUSS THE DEATHS OF SABOTAGE ALERT TEAMS CALLED IN TOGATHER UP THE NON-HUMAN BODIES IN NEW MEXICO THE FIRST WEEK OFJUY 1947.That’s a good point. There certainly are cases such as the technicians who died in 1947after they were taken to Los Alamos.THOSE WERE TECHNICIANS THAT SPECIFICALLY WERE IN SOME KIND OFPROTECTIVE SUITS THAT HANDLED THE BODIES OF WHAT WERE DESCRIBEDAS ‘EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL BODIES’ AT CRASH SITES.Exactly. There are a few cases like this where you can associate aliens and illnesses. Butnot to the extent that you can be specific about what pathogen was involved or what thetreatments were or what kind of procedures would have been used for a public emergency.My guess is that these projects, SPIKE, HOUSE CLEANING, ARTICHOKE andDOMESTIC might be responses to an ‘Andromeda strain.’FROM EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES?Yes, right. Reasonable things to do. Not everything that MJ-12 does is necessarily evil!(laughs) They were trying to make sure that our human enemies did not get moretechnology than we did. In the process, they decided their objectives were so importantthat they did not have to worry about the U.S. Constitution. And that was bad.THAT BRINGS US TO THE FINAL PAGE OF THE BURNED MEMO, WHICH ISPERHAPS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF ALL IN THE CONTEXT OF AN AGENCYIN THE GOVERNMENT TRYING TO KEEP THE PUBLIC AND THE MEDIA FROMKNOWING THE FACTS ABOUT WHAT THE GOVERNMENT AGENTS DO KNOW:THAT THERE ARE EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES INTERACTINGWITH PLANET EARTH. Tab H Project ENVIRONMENTTAB H SAYS: ‘Draft, Directive Regarding Project ENVIRONMENT. When conditionsbecome non-conducive for growth in our environment and Washington cannot beinfluenced any further, the weather is lacking any precipitation (misspelled as percipitationin memo) ... it should be wet.’CAN YOU EXPLAIN THIS?"},{"pageNumber":13,"pageContent":"Well, it’s four thoughts there. The first thought is when ‘conditions become non-conducivefor growth.’ I think that means that if MJ-12 is not going to get any money, or no moremoney, or their money is going to be cut off completely ‘in our environment.’‘And Washington cannot be influenced any further.’ That means the people who controlthis covert money are not coming up with it.MEANING COVERT BLACK BUDGET MONEY TO KEEP MJ-12 FUNCTIONING?Yes. Exactly right, which is presumably somewhere between not trivial and huge!And the ‘weather is lacking any precipitation.’ I’m reading that to mean that there is nomore money coming down from the heavens like it has in the past.Then, ‘it should be wet’ is a reference to ‘wet works,’ or ‘wet affairs,’ which originated inRussia, actually in the 19th Century from a Russian phrase where apparently if you killedsomebody during a burglary, it was called ‘wet’ in Russian because of the blood.BECAUSE OF THE BLOOD?Yes, because of the blood. That word got used in the intelligence community in the KGBto describe assassinations. That was picked up by the intelligence communities around theworld apparently.At this point, you have to go back to the scenario that was involved. I would presume thatthe scenario involved is that MJ-1 is dictating this burned memo to a secretary. He, MJ-1,does not want the secretary to know that he is saying, ‘We ought to kill JFK.’So MJ-1 was using arcane language to conceal that from the secretary, but all of his(MJ-12) readers would know exactly what he meant. So, that’s my speculation on thephrase, ‘it should be wet.’THIS IS THE DIRECTOR OF THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY ...MJ-1, yes.WHO IS ADDRESSING MJ-2 THROUGH 7.
