I'm sending a photo (attachment) taken by a friendof mine who lives in Pine which is 17 miles North of Payson. She calls theobjects \"bead dots\" because they are round spheres in the sky."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Summer 2007, Rim near Pine, Arizona, 17 miles north of Payson.Image ©2007 by L. Murray.I've seen the sphere-like objects just like the ones in the photo at least threetimes since I've lived in Payson (since 2006). In my sightings, the sphere UFOstraveled in groups like the ones in the my friend's photo. The pearl-like sphereshover over the canyon Rim, make right angle turns at high speed and thenblink out. They appear to have a highly reflective surface. The UFO photo Isent to you in March, shows a UFO over Payson taken from my back yard andis like a sphere. However, upon closer view, it doesn't look like a hard, pearlysurface. (see my email to you March 2008).March 31, 2008: This is a zoomed in view of the sphere takenover Payson,AZ late last summer (2007). Closer, we could see the purplecolors in the middle of the orb/sphere. Taken with a CanonPowerShot SD450 digital (5.0 pixels). The orb hovered for anhour glowingbrightly. My camera has only a small zoom on it and close up shotwas taken with the same camera. After an hour, the orb simply“clicked”out and was gone. This object was not a plane or anything else(and not a flare!!).We saw it in daylight glowing quite brightly. It was an incrediblyiridescent spherehovering over Payson. There were several of us present for thesighting."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Same shot not zoomed in. Some time ago in Bayfield, Colorado, I was photographing the treesand saw a glowing sphere above the grass and heard a thought(that wasn’t my own) say to me: “Look—over here—take my picture!”I turned and snapped my Fugifilm (6.2 pixels) digital camera and caughtthe glowing sphere! This picture is not a trick of the camera, nor a flashgoing off. The glowing light could be seen with the eye and apparentlywanted to be photographed!“This was a glowing orb (quite large) in a woodedfield near Bayfield, Colorado —taken several years ago.”All of this reminds me of a video I saw once several years ago. I have anotherfriend who showed me a video that was taken by her mother's X husbandwhile on a filming trip to Brazil. He was filming \"healers\" -- Shamans who"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"can do surgery by reaching into the body and removing tumors etc. I skippedthrough the footage to a wedding he filmed. During this segment, he sawsomething in the sky and pans to it and zooms in. You can hear theirexcitement in the background as the realize they are looking at a UFO.He had a fairly good zoom ability on the camera. What I saw on the filmwas amazing. The UFO looked like a transparent, blue bubble with plasma-like purple energy swirling around inside the core. It almost looked biologicalin nature. It reminded me of the bubble part of a Man-o-war Jellyfish -only this was a perfectly round sphere.I wonder if the pearl spheres can become transparent or change colors?Now I wish I would have copied the video because I had to give it back.I wonder what happened to the footage? Thanks for the great reporting.2 ) Subject: Redstone Arsenal and February 22, 2008Date: May 4, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comDecatur is 20 miles west of Huntsville, home of NASA's Space Rocket Centerand Space Camp and the Redstone Army Arsenal.Hi Linda,I listened with interest to the interview you had with the young man fromDecatur, Alabama. His story, while remarkable, doesn't really surpriseme, given what I know about Huntsville and about Redstone Arsenal.Because of this story, I am writing you about another strange event thatoccurred here recently, back in February 2008.I've lived in Huntsville for almost twenty years now. Most of that timehas been spent working for various government contractors as a softwaredeveloper and IT support tech. While most of my contractor experience wasworking for the U.S. Army, I am currently employed as an analyst atMarshall Spaceflight Center at a NASA-wide IT helpdesk. I work secondshift, which means that I work 1-11 PM four days a week (the helpdesk runs24/7).On the evening of February 22, 2008, I and the other analysts present heardandfelt a tremendous boom and attendant shockwave. The building literallyshook. I have never heard or felt anything like it....and having lived inHuntsville as long as I have and worked on the Arsenal for a number ofyears, I am used to all sorts of exotic (and loud) noise sources. Thebuilding I work in, for instance, is within walking distance of the SpaceShuttle Main Engine test stand. This was like nothing any of us presenthad ever experienced. It was like an atomic bomb going off. I calledMarshall Security and asked if they knew what was going on. The dutyofficer told me that it was a mystery to Security as well, but that theyas well as the Army were dispatching officers to investigate.Shortly thereafter, some of the off-duty personnel I work with called in tomake"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"sure that we were okay, because they had heard the boom as well. One ofthe people who called in lives thirty miles from Huntsville and wasawakened from sleep by the boom! The other person said that car alarms inher neighborhood in Huntsville were going off because the shock wave hadshaken the cars enough to set off their alarms.The news later reported that this boom was heard in no fewer than sixcounties in Alabama and Tennessee. The official story, the one told inthe local news media, is that a rocket motor was being tested by the Armyand that the test consisted of slowly heating the motor until it exploded,as a way of seeing what sort of heat stress the motor could take inoperation. Linda, the largest rocket engine ever tested on the Arsenalwas the Saturn V moon rocket engine, and I can't imagine even one of thoseexploding could generate the boom and shockwave we experienced here. Thetest stands where the February 22nd incident would have taken place areperhaps five miles from the building I work in. As I told a coworkerlater, that shockwave must have broken every window within a mile radiusof where the test was. The Army has not given any details as to thenature of the motor being tested.The following article from the Huntsville Times Online is indicative ofthe kind of goofy “coverage” that this incident was given by the localmedia....which still beats the national media, who didn't cover it at all:http://www.al.com/news/huntsvilletimes/index.ssf?/base/news/1206868530229520.xml&coll=1Those Booms At Redstone 'For Soldiers'Sunday, March 30, 2008By SHELBY G. SPIRESWhen the 2/22 explosion happened, I thought of writing you, as I am aregular Dreamland listener and an UnknownCountry.com subscriber. Iwaffled about it as I wasn't sure whether talking to the media wouldimpact my job security (the NASA subcontractor I work for also performswork for the military). However, in light of what just happened inDecatur, I think a larger audience needs to be aware of the sorts of thingsthat happen around Redstone Arsenal. As you probably know, Redstone iswhere the Project Paperclip scientists ended up and actually spent far moretimethan they ever spent in New Mexico.[Editor's Note: Project Paperclip - 1946, German scientistsbrought toUnited States after World War II to develop V-2 rockets atWhite Sands Proving Ground, New Mexico.]Marshall Spaceflight Center is situated on the Arsenal itself, as is both theArmy Missile Command and the Army Space and Missile Defense Command.German physicist Werner Von Braun and his crew originally worked forAMCOM's predecessor, then founded Marshall -- without leaving Redstone.Just a point of geography: the Tennessee River winds around the southernboundary of the Arsenal. Decatur is on the other side of the Tennessee River,not directly across from the Arsenal, but some miles to the west. Thesouthern part of the Arsenal is where the test ranges are and where theexplosiontook place. If an experimental craft being tested on those testranges were to go off course, it could easily end up in Decatur. Becauseof the young man's story, I think it is overwhelmingly likely that thesphere incident was related to Redstone. I do not think that Marshall wasinvolved, simply because classified R&D does not go on at MSFC and thereare no secure facilities (secure in the military operational securitysense) at Marshall. Even though MSFC is on Redstone Arsenal, Marshallpersonnel do not as a rule have security clearances and we are not madeprivy to what the Army is up to in its R&D programs. So, I would say thatthis was most likely an Army effort that went awry.I also had an experience about ten years ago that I am hesitant to bringup, but which might be relevant. In the late 1990s, I was driving home witha friend of mine, a history professor at one of the local colleges,through a valley at night after visiting the home of a mutual friend ofours. The valley in question is below Monte Sano, a mountain that"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"overlooks Huntsville.I looked up at the mountain and saw a glowing orange sphere perched up onthe mountain like a gigantic orange light bulb! My friend and I both watched itand talked about it as we drovethrough the valley beneath it. It was motionless and did not blink orotherwise change brightness or color. I thought, \"My God, there is a UFOsitting on the top of Monte Sano in plain view of the entire city ofHuntsville!\" In retrospect perhaps I should have tried driving up MonteSano to get a closer look as the road up there would have taken me quiteclose to where it was. Part of the reason I didn't was that I assumedthat the local news and local gossip would be talking about this incidentfor a long time to come....yet, I never once heard anything else about it -Not only nothing from the local media, but nothing from the local citizenry.No one here seems to know this happened. And one of the news channels herehas its studios actually *on* Monte Sano! The whole episode was one of thestrangest things that's ever happened to me.So, I have a little experience myself with odd glowing spheres in thenight sky over Huntsville.Linda, you're welcome to use any of this material you wish, but I wouldappreciate it if you'd leave my name off of it if you do. If you wish totalk more about all this I would be happy to do so. Keep up the good work. 3) Subject: \"Pearl\" Sphere, Highland California, 2005Date: May 4, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comHi Linda,In April of 2005, I was \"sightseeing\" through Highland, California,via Google maps, when a blurry circular object in the satellite imagerycaught my eye. Attached are two screen captures I took and saved to my harddrive."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"The object appears to be remarkably similar to the image you have posted oftheMangonia Park, Florida object. At the time, the object was near theintersectionof Pumalo Street and Bonita Drive, Highland, California. I just now searchedthesame area on Google maps (link below), and apparently the map has beenupdated,with no sign of the 2005 object.http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=pumalo+and+bonita,+highland,+CA&sll=34.136442,-117.213199&sspn=0.004929,0.00824&ie=UTF8&ll=34.139373,-117.206461&spn=0.004928,0.00824&t=h&z=17If one of these pearly spheres ends up in my backyard,you'll be the first to know... thanks Linda! 4) Subject: Earthfiles \"Pearl\" Sphere, Highland California, 2005Date: May 4, 2008 10:36:06 PM MDTTo: earthfiles@earthfiles.comRe: email 3) above, Highland, California, GoogleMap \"Pearl\" Sphere, 2005: Itappears to me as though the angles of the tree shadows on the corner ofPumalo St. and Bonita Drive are different with the current Google image at 1o'clock and the older image at 12. This would indicate a new picture ratherthan a retouching had occurred. What you are suggesting is:1) that a spherical shape was relatively close to the satellite when the imagewas captured. I am a photographer but not a photographic expert. However, ifthe object was in space and at not too great a distance from the camera, Iwould think that the sunlight reflected off of it would be glaringly bright. Also,as I suspect that a combination of telephoto lens and very high resolutionimaging technology is used, any object that is relatively close to the camerawould be very blurry, not just a little blurry."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"2) a large object is relatively close to the ground, but is vibrating, creating aslightly blurry image. Or a very large object is higher in the atmosphere.3) My best guess - it is an artifact of the imaging process. Neither of us reallyknows much about the technology which goes into satellite imagery and theprocess of making it into a Google map.It seems like a stretch to jump from the pearl object story to the photographiccapture of such in a satellite image. And I was one of the respondents to yourrequest for sphere sightings, having seen one around 1983 in Rochester, NY![email 5 below.] I like to track the connections, but not jump to conclusions,especially when one doesn't know enough.A few last comments. The sphere is just about the same size in relation to theblocks and houses in both of the Google images. I would take this as beingsupport of an imaging artifact. The other possibility is some one along the way(from image acquisition to Google) deliberately altered the image either as agoof or deliberately to track how it comes into public awareness and how it isinterpreted. 5) Subject: Aerial Glowing Sphere EncounterDate: March 31, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.comHi Linda. I am a 56 year old mental health administrator andphotographer currently living in Southern Oregon. One dayaround 1983 or 1984 during the summer, I was walking in aresidential neighborhood near downtown Rochester, New York,with a friend. We both noticed a luminescent orb slowly movingacross the sky. It was a sunny day with some low, puffy whiteclouds. The orb was about the size of a dime held at arms lengthwith green and pink colors swirling around the outside a little likethe pattern motor oil makes when mixed with water on pavement.The orb was clearly a sphere and three dimensional.We watched it disappear as it entered a cloud, reappear as itexited and disappear again as it entered another cloud from whichit did not reappear. We observed it for about 20 seconds. It movedin a slow, fluid, zigzag when it was visible. It was unlike anything Ihave ever seen - very beautiful and surreal - and my memory of itis very clear even now. 6) White Spheres in California Photograph UFOCasebook.com February 6, 2003"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"MUFON Submitter 10515: “The wife is 63 & 1/2 inches (5'3.5\") tall.
