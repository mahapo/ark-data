Belvoir photograph from Italy,that our CIA unit investigated, showed a saucer-shaped craftthat had landed. There were two or three small, non-humans outside,like walking around.” - “Stein,” Former Army/CIA UFO Analyst Return to Part 1November 5, 2008 Albuquerque, New Mexico - After my initial phone interviews withStern in May to early June 1998, recorded with Stern's permission, he and I decided thatgiven the evidence that my phone was tapped by Someone, it would be better for me totravel to his home to speak in person. When I made the trip on June 29, 1998, no oneknew my travel plans or location, not even my family. However, after three days of tapingwith Stern in much greater detail than inn the phone conversations, it was made clear that Iwas monitored, followed, because government agents showed face-to-face with Sternwithin hours of my departure, warning him “if you ever want to see your son married andhave grandkids, we are here to tell you that you are never to speak to Linda MoultonHowe again.”The following transcript and other parts to unfold are highlights from those three days thattotalled about sixteen hours of recorded discussions. Interview Inside Stern's HomeJune 29, 1998“WHEN YOU GOT YOUR WHITE HOUSE TOP SECRET CLEARANCE AT THEREQUEST OF YOUR BOSS, ANTHONY BARDEN, DO YOU REMEMBER WHATMONTH AND YEAR THAT WAS?Yes, that was end of June 1958.AFTER RECEIVING THE CLEARANCE, WHAT IS THE NEXT THING THATHAPPENED?We started getting fed material from Project Blue Book, the real one, a CIA operationchanneled through Langley and Ft. Belvoir, Virginia.HOW DID IT WORK? YOU ARE IN THE SOUTHEASTERN MILITARY BASE. YOUARE TEACHING CRYPTOGRAPHY AND SIGNAL CORPS RADIO OPERATIONS.Right.WHAT DID ANTHONY BARDEN DO? HOW DID HE HANDLE HIS PARALLEL LIFEFOR THE CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY’S BLUE BOOK?By the middle of July 1958, I was through with my last NATO group that I taught. Therewere still other teachers instructing local troops, but I went on to the CIA Project BlueBook at mid-July 1958. And by mid-August 1958, my boss, Anthony Barden, and I packedup and took the trip to Area 51 in Nevada.BY THEN, YOU HAD SCREENED THE 16MM BLACK AND WHITE FILM THATSHOWED THE AUTOPSY OF THE 6-FINGERED, 6-TOED ENTITIES?Ye s . "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Italian Photograph of Landed “Saucer”and Small, Non-HumansThe very first international case that came to our desk by special classified messenger afterI started with Anthony Barden's unit was a photograph of a UFO from Italy. It came to usfrom Ft. Belvoir, Virginia, with the analysis that the film negative was not doctored andthey found no trace of double exposure of any kind and declared it authentic. The Ft.Belvoir photograph from Italy, that our CIA unit investigated, showed a saucer-shapedcraftthat had landed. There were two or three small, non-humans outside, like walking around.I don’t know if they were looking at the plants and soil or what. These were small aliens,probably only about three feet tall. The photo was a distance away, so you could not seeany facial features on the aliens.WAS IT A COLOR PHOTO?No, it was black and white. It was a small photograph like you would take with anold-style Brownie Kodak camera.WHAT DID THE CRAFT LOOK LIKE IN THE PHOTO?It was a silver-colored disc.SHAPE?Round. It had a small raised area on top of the disc. There were a few outcroppings on thebottom.METALLIC, DO YOU MEAN?Yes, on the bottom, almost like warts on the thing hanging down from the bottom.DO YOU MEAN BALLS UNDERNEATH?Yes, three, round balls under the disc. I thought at the time they might be a device to lookout from the inside, like a porthole? Or something to do with the navigation? And theuniforms the little aliens had on were light grey-colored and it looked like they had somekind of helmet device on – you couldn’t see a face, but it didn’t look like a bare headthere. It was almost like they had a cloth type of helmet.WHAT WAS YOUR PERSONAL REACTION TO VIEWING THE NON-HUMANS INTHE PHOTOGRAPH?I saw these little child-sized beings outside the craft and wondered how they flew such anadvanced craft! Also, based on what I was taught as a child about angels and demons, I atfirst wondered if the non-humans were demons. But spirit beings don’t need physical craftto move around. CIA Field Agents Investigate Italy LocationTwo of our CIA guys went over to Italy with just a copy of the photograph, not theoriginal, and went to the village where the photograph had been taken and interviewed thephotographer. The CIA guys were taken to the exact location where the saucer had landedand confirmed that the geographic location matched the environment in the photograph –the vegetation, trees and everything around. They also saw four indentation marks in theground where the craft had landed.FOUR INDENTATIONS, NOT THREE?Right, four on that particular craft. There were three around inside the circle and oneindentation in the middle.WERE THE THREE INDENTATIONS IN A TRIPOD PATTERN WITH THE FOURTHINDENTATION RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE?Yes. And they used plaster of Paris to make a mold of one of the holes. When thephotographs the CIA agents took at the scene were returned to our southeastern militarybase, we had a photo lab guy with clearance to process and print the photos. Then wecould all see how those photographs matched the original case photo. And we were able tolook at the plaster of Paris mold."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHERE DID THAT PLASTER OF PARIS MOLD GO?That went back to Ft. Belvoir, Virginia, to the TOP SECRET files there and probablyeventually ended up at CIA Langley in their vast files section that back then was at leasthalf a block long.WONDER HOW BIG THE CIA FILES ARE TODAY? (Suitland, Maryland, is supposedto have a huge underground archive of American intelligence files as well.)Yeah! And all full of heavy shelves with file boxes on it. I was in there. That’s anotherstory for later.WHAT DID ANTHONY BARDEN SAY TO YOU AND YOUR CIA TEAM ABOUT THEITALIAN CASE?Anthony said, ‘As far as we can see, this is authentic.’ The team that went to Italy alsorecorded an interview at the original saucer location with the eyewitness couple that onlyspoke Italian. One of our CIA team spoke Italian and translated the interview. The couplesaid they saw the saucer craft come in the sky and hover closely over their house and theycould hear a mild tone, like a harmonic tone. That was the only noise it made. Only whenthe craft was close over their house could they hear that harmonic tone. When it flewfarther away, they could not hear that sound anymore.Then the saucer craft landed about half a block away in a little field next to a woodedarea. The non-humans opened the hatch, got out of the craft and walked around differentareas, reaching down and picking up small plants and grass, looking at them. One of thealiens broke off a limb from a pine tree and was carrying the little limb around, the couplesaid. Then before the non-humans went back into the craft, the beings were all looking atthe limb like it was fantastic or something. I think the non-humans took the pinecones andsome needles off the limb and then dropped the limb to the ground. After that, the smallbeings got back into the saucer craft, closed the hatch and flew off. Ft. Belvoir, Virginia Conduitfor Real CIA Project Blue Book CasesWHAT WERE YOU AND YOUR CIA TEAM SUPPOSED TO DO WITH THE ITALIANPHOTO?We were supposed to contact the nearest CIA field agent to make direct contact with thecouple who were the eyewitnesses and took the photograph. In our southeastern base, westarted working on the Italian case with two other civilians from the CIA, who worecivilian clothes. When I went out to Area 51, I wore civilian clothes also, not my Armyuniform. And I used my phony CIA identity at Area 51. Even at the southeastern Armymilitary base, I was asked to keep wearing my civilian clothes and phony nametag, unless Iwas teaching a class. For class instruction, I wore my Army uniform.WHY DID THE CIA NOT WANT YOU TO DRESS AS THE U. S. ARMY 1STLIEUTENANT THAT YOU WERE?Because at the time, the CIA Blue Book project did not call for military ranking, only CIApeople who generally came through the civilian ranks back then. There were a few whocame out of the military into the CIA. But I never used my phony CIA identity in any ofmy teaching work.SO YOU WERE LIVING TWO LIVES IN TWO DIFFERENT ‘COSTUMES,’ SO TOSPEAK, INSIDE THE SOUTHEASTERN MILITARY BASE.Ye s .HOW EXACTLY DID YOUR CIA UNIT GET THAT ITALIAN PHOTOGRAPH?It came through Project Blue Book. Apparently, the individual in Italy heard about BlueBook and took the photo to an American embassy and someone there in turn sent it toprobably the FBI and the FBI probably sent it to Project Blue Book and from there, it wassent to Ft. Belvoir, Virginia. Since it was foreign, the photograph was sent to us in the CIAProject Blue Book unit in the southeastern military base.ALL FOREIGN TECHNOLOGY MATTERS WENT THROUGH FT. BELVOIR,VIRGINA?Yes, everything that was not explainable. Project Blue Book first had a group of civilians"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"and officers who would contact eyewitnesses. When a foreign case came in, they didn’thave a way to contact international foreigners to check it out. So, such a case andpaperwork would automatically go to Ft. Belvoir and on to us. If it was something that could not be debunked – real photographs like we were shown atArea 51 in August 1958, taken from jet airplanes and Super Sabres. After WWII, insteadof gun turrets on them, a lot of Super Sabres had cameras. By flying to the general areawhere there were frequent UFO sightings, this one group of three pilots in F100s (SuperSabres), they were following half a dozen different saucer craft to get close-up photos. Butwhen the jets got near the saucer craft, they would just dart away. At Area 51, we weretold it was like entering the Indianapolis 500 (car race) with an old Model-T as far as ourjets trying to keep up with the saucers. Ours could not! All of a sudden, the saucer craftwould zip around and be BEHIND the jets, like playing cat and mouse games.MEANING THE SAUCERS COULD HOP BEHIND THE JETS BEFORE THE JETSCOULD EVEN MANEUVER?Yes. Even now, my son-in-law recently told me about one of his military friends who onceflew with a group of F100s that had cameras mounted and the jets flew right up through agroup of saucer craft. The saucers veered off in all directions. The jets were trying to getclose to the saucers to photograph, but the jets could not even get close.F100 Super Sabre, first 1950s mass produced aircraftcapable of routine Mach 1, plus speed in straight and level flight.Source: Jetplanes.co.uk[ Editor’ Note: F100 Super Sabres were the first mass produced aircraftcapable of routine mach 1 plus speed in straight and level flight. Theprototype for this century series aircraft first flew in May 1953, while theinitial production example an F100a took to the sky later that year in October.Development of the aircraft was a priority at the time due to the KoreanPeninsula troubles. The aircraft entered USAF service proper in Septemberthe following year.Propelling the F100 or the 'Hun' as it became known was a single P&W J57turbojet which in the version fitted to the F100d could produce 16,950lbsthrust on re-heat. This took the aircraft past the speed of sound and on to atop speed of over 840mph in the case of the F100d variant. ] DID ANTHONY BARDEN GIVE YOU ANY BACKGROUND INFORMATION ABOUTTHE CIA KNOWING ABOUT OTHER SIMILAR UFO LANDINGS WHERE BEINGSCOLLECTED SAMPLES?He did give us a briefing, but it was mostly about the CIA’s problem of separating realphotographs from hoaxed photographs. He had some other genuine photographs of disccraft that had been taken by fighter jet cameras. Among the foreign photos he had, therewere some from Mexico and Central America. Most of those were aerial photos of asaucer in the air, nothing landed. It took quite awhile to get a photograph like a landedcraft with aliens outside. Small, Grey Non-Humans Linked to IncasDO YOU REMEMBER ANOTHER SUCH PHOTO?I remember one was from northern Mexico taken by a Mexican geologist who was outlooking for oil and he had a camera to take photos of the terrain. He photographed a"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"saucer and our CIA group compared it to the Italian saucer. Anthony Barden said, ‘Thesesure don’t look the same.’ The Mexico saucer had a great big dome in the middle of it thatstood up probably ten to twelve feet above the disc. That saucer craft, according to thehilly environment around it, was quite a bit larger than the craft in the Italian photograph.DID ANTHONY BARDEN HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT THE DIFFERENCESBETWEEN THE SAUCER CRAFT?Yes. He had gone to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and then on to Ft. Belvoir,Virginia, where need-to-know people showed Anthony whatever they had so he wouldhave a better overview. We only had the team that could go to Italy to investigate, but itwas tough because those CIA people had tremendous cover in order to infiltrategovernments and it was hard for us to contact them directly for discussions or to get suchfield CIA people to help us investigate UFO cases. 1958 CIA Had At Least Two Non-Human Categories:6-Fingered Humanoids and “Greys”SO WHAT DID FT. BELVOIR IN 1958 TELL BARDEN ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE INCRAFT?Just that there were different types and sizes of craft and at least two different types ofaliens. One was the Roswell type, the smaller humanoid that had 6 fingers and 6 toes. Theother was the large head with big eyes and pointed chin and could be three feet tall or fivefeet tall.WHAT DID ANTHONY BARDEN SAY ABOUT THE TALLER ONE?He said that the military referred to both sizes as ‘Greys’ because of the grey skin color. Atthat time, Anthony Barden asked where the Greys were from and the people at CIA inLangley, Virginia, told him they had no knowledge of actual origin. Anthony was told therewere tremendous discrepancies. The Greys they had captured in crashes telepathicallygave numerous different stories as to where they were from. So, the CIA did not reallyknow where the Greys were from, but they thought it was outside our solar system. Grey Non-Humans from Aldebaran Solar System?One location the CIA wondered about was a planet described as orbiting the starAldebaran. There were supposed to be two planets circling that star and the Greys mightcome from there. Aldebaran also comes up in the German Vril Society's supposed to havecontact with tall, pale skinned beings from the Aldebaran system that taught the VrilSociety how to build round craft that could neutralize gravity.Aldebaran (larger white dot lower right)in the Taurus constellation's head is close to the Sun every yeararound May 31.

Source: Wikipedia.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - Aldebaran is a K5III type star, 65 light-yearsfrom Earth and is the brightest star in the constellation Taurus and is one ofthe brightest stars in the night sky. It's orange color means the star hasexhausted its hydrogen fuel and burning primarily helium. The agingAldebaran has expanded its diameter to about 38 times the diameter of ourSun. Aldebaran is one of the easiest stars to find if one follows the three starsin Orion's belt from left to right in the Northern Hemisphere, or right to left inthe Southern Hemisphere. The first bright star found by continuing that line isAldebaran. The name Aldebaran comes from Arabic and means, “thefollower” and refers to the way Aldebaran follows the Pleiades star cluster inits nightly journey across the sky. Also, because Aldebaran is located in thebull's head of Taurus, the reddish star has historically been called the Bull'sEye. NASA's Pioneer 10 spacecraft, which flew by Jupiter in 1973, will reachand pass by Aldebaran in about two million years. Aldebaran has a dimcompanion M2 dwarf orbiting at several hundred astronomical units.Aldebaran is also alleged by the original German Vril Society of the 1920s tobe the origin of space beings that taught the Vril Society how to buildanti-gravity saucer craft. The Vril Society was the mother of the Nazi party.“Vril” in German means light force. The mystery persists about the VrilSociety's origin and description of beings from Aldebaran teaching the disctechnology.

DID ANTHONY BARDEN EVER MENTION ZETA RETICULII 1 AND 2?No, but he did say something about the Pleiades, a star group. It was amazing to me thatthe different beings, or Greys, could actually ‘speak’ English telepathically.

CERTAINLY THE CIA WOULD HAVE BRIEFED HIM ONEVERYTHING THE CIA KNEW AT THAT TIME, RIGHT?It’s possible that Anthony Barden held some information back from us in our unit. He toldus back at the southeastern military base, ‘If we get (shoot down?) enough of these craftand capture these beings and they talk to us, we’ll certainly know if there is such a thing asextraterrestrial life out there. Not long after he said that, we got the notice to go to Area 51in mid-August 1958. He went to church every Sunday and he was raised with the idea thatEarth was the only place where there was life in the universe. But when he finallyinterviewed the being at Area 51, he came out and said to me, ‘I think they made abeliever out of me!
