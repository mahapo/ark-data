Airbrushed images © 2007 by Brent Yearout.May 9, 2008 Camas, Washington - A year ago on May 4, 2007, Coast to Coast AMwebmaster, Lex, received an email from a Central California resident who called himself“Chad” about his photographing an odd, dragonfly-shaped, aerial object. In an email aweek later, Chad sent some of his photographs dated May 6, 2007. [ See: 051507Earthfiles for photos.] In addition to the dragonfly-shaped body that had appendagessticking out from a large ring, there was another odd feature. Rising from the ring straightup into the air were slightly curved, thin wires that formed a tall, circular crown above thedragonfly body. Chad was worried about his family's safety and health after he saw thebizarre aerial object at least eight times from his house and on hikes near his home andheard a low, electrostatic hum coming from it. Neighbors, he said, had also seen theunidentified aerial object.Other 2007 photographs of dragonfly-shaped aerial objects began to emerge between Mayand June from Lake Tahoe, Capitola and Big Basin, California – all with appendagessticking out from a ring and the tall, thin wires extending high above. [ See MoreInformation below.]By June 17, 2007, I received a dozen paper photographs dated June 5th, 2007, in postoffice mail. The new “drone” looked more menacing and more complicated than theothers. I had taken to calling the objects “drones” because eyewitnesses had theimpression that the hovering craft were not manned. The dozen photographs were from aman who called himself “Ty B.” Ty explained he photographed the large, dragonfly craftwhile bicycling with a group in the Big Basin Redwood Park near Saratoga, California. Hesaid they all saw the dragonfly-shaped craft fade in and fade out three times above them. Itwas on the third fade in that Ty was able to take twelve photos, which he mailed to me. Allthe photographs are archived in 061707 Earthfiles.After the Big Basin craft, no other photographs of the mysterious dragonfly-shaped“drones” emerged. And none of us knew until spring 2008, that two other eyewitnessesfurther north in Camas, Washington, on the Columbia River between Washington andOregon, were encountering another craft that moved like a dragonfly above Lakamas Lakeon June 7, 2007."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Camas is a city in Clark County, Washington, with a population of 12,534at the United States Census. Officially incorporated on June 18, 1906, the city is named afterthe camas lily, a plant with an onion-like bulb prized by Native Americans. One of the majorgeographical features of the city is Prune Hill, upon which a great portion of the residentialarea of the city is located. Prune Hill is the remaining cinder cone of an extinct volcano.The paper mill industry has been replaced in recent years by several white-collar,high-tech companies including Hewlett-Packard, Sharp Microelectronics,Linear Technologies and WaferTech among others.Those two eyewitnesses are good friends. After a year of silence, one has agreed to speakon the record with his full name: Brent Yourout (ure-OWE), a 48-year-old professionalartist who specializes in airbrushing cars, motorcycles and blue jeans. Even though Brentwas born and raised in the Vancouver, Washington, region as a strict Catholic, he has notbeen as upset as his friend, Tim, by their encounter with an unearthly-looking aerial craft.Tim is a Christian fundamentalist who does not accept that there is other intelligent lifebeyond Earth and he is not willing to comment.Brent Yearout is a single parent with two sons. In the late afternoon of Thursday June 7,2007, Brent dropped one of his sons downtown in Camas and was returning home up thehill out of Camas that goes toward Lacamas Lake. He heard sirens and could see behindhim the blue flashing lights of two police cars speeding up the hill. Brent pulled over as thepolice went by. After that came more emergency rescue vehicles, a fire truck and anotherpolice car. Brent worried that there had been a big wreck up ahead and thought of his goodfriend, Tim, who lived up the road. When Brent reached Tim's house, he was relieved thatall was quiet. But he was surprised when more Camas City Police and Clark Countyofficers sped by.Brent Yearout drove to an open space overlooking Lacamas Lake to see if there was awreck on Leadbetter, a curvy road that follows the lake. He could not see anything on theroad, but coming toward him in the sky was something he had never seen before.Brent Yearout, Professional Airbrush Artist, Camas, Washington.Image provided by Brent Yearout.Interview:Brent Yearout, Professional Airbrush Artist, Camas, Washington: “Then I saw what Ithought was a logging helicopter – a really small-framed helicopter, like a wire-framehelicopter – coming down what we call the Lacamas Valley down along Lacamas Creek."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"I’m going up the hill and I start hearing this static sound. I thought it was my radio and Ipushed a button on my stereo and realized it was on CD. So, I wondered what is thatstatic? I thought it was kind of weird and maybe I had run over a branch or something andwas dragging a branch under the car – that’s kind of what it sounded like. So, I rolled downmy window and was slowing down. It was not coming out of my side of the car, so I rolleddown the passenger window and it sounded like it was coming out of the passengerwindow. I could hear the wind going over my sunroof, so as I was slowing down, the staticseemed like it was getting louder.As I’m slowing way down, it’s still making this sound and it’s getting louder and louder andI’m thinking, ‘What the heck?!’ And I look to my left, which is just about 200 or 300 feetover the Lacamas Lake water from where I am on the road and I saw what I thought wasthat helicopter thing.And I realize the sound is coming from this thing! And I’m looking at it and wondering,‘What the heck is that?’The first thing is that I’m looking for some kind of propulsion system. I’m looking for apropeller and I know there is a ring. I knew I could see light through this ring at kind of aside angle. But I could not hear anything that sounded like a turbine engine or an internalcombustion engine or a steam engine or anything for that matter. I’m real mechanical withthat stuff and I know what that stuff sounds like. I’m going, ‘That is so weird!’ And I’mlooking at this thing and it’s not like anything I’ve ever seen before in my life, OK? AndI’m just in awe! I’m sitting there and have a really nice Olympus camera in my glove box,but I’m in so much shock over this thing that I did not even think about it. I’m lookingaround to see if there is anyone else. I live in a fairly rural area, but a lot of people jog andbicycle by the lake and I didn’t see a soul. And I’m thinking, ‘Oh, my word, here I amhaving a Close Encounter and there isn’t anybody around.’I’m looking at this thing and it kind of hovered and as it was coming down through thetrees as I was coming up the hill, it was moving back and forth in an erratic motion like itwas looking for something. You know what I mean? Like a helicopter going back and forthlooking for something.I could see like it rotated like a helicopter would kind of. The craft was staying stationary,but the body of it was twisting or something. And as I’m looking at this thing, the noisewas really loud making a static sound. It sounded like electricity or something. Do youknow what a Jacob’s Ladder is where it goes zzzzzzzzzzz (makes sound)? Or static on atelevision set late at night, but really louder than that.[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - A Jacob's ladder (more formally, a high voltagetraveling arc) is a device for producing a continuous train of large sparkswhich rise upwards. The spark gap is formed by two wires, approximatelyvertical but gradually diverging away from each other towards the top.Jacob's ladder high voltage traveling arc.When high voltage is applied to the gap, a spark forms across the bottom ofthe wires where they are nearest each other, rapidly changing to an electricarc. Air breaks down at about 30kV/cm, depending on humidity, temperature,and so on. Apart from the anode and cathode voltage drops, the arc behavesalmost as a short circuit, drawing as much current as the electrical powersupply can deliver, and the heavy load dramatically reduces the voltage acrossthe gap.The heated, ionized air rises, carrying the current path with it. As the trail ofionization gets longer, it becomes more unstable, finally breaking. The voltage"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"across the electrodes then rises and the spark re-forms at the bottom of thedevice.This cycle leads to an exotic-looking display of electric white, yellow, blue orpurple arcs, which is often seen in movies about mad scientists. The devicewas a staple in schools and science fairs of the1950s and 1960s, typicallyconstructed out of a Model T spark coil, or any other source of high voltage inthe 10,000 volt to 30,000 volt range, like a neon sign transformer or circuit(10-30 kV) or a television picture tube circuit (flyback transformer; 10-28kV), and two coat hangers or rods built into a V-shape. For larger ladders,microwave oven transformers connected in series or utility pole transformers(pole pigs) run in reverse (step-up) are used. The sparks can burn through thinpaper and plastic and start fires; contact with the exposed high voltage can belethal.] BRENT, WHAT IS THERE IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHERE THE CRAFT SEEMEDTO BE LOOKING?Red dot is where Brent Yourout stopped his car about 200 feet above Lakamas Lake at about thesame height as the craft that moved like a dragonfly. White dot marks Tim's home where he was moreunderneath the strange craft as it flew over. Date was June 7, 2007, at sunset. The Google mapabove of Camas, Washington, is rotated to match Brent's map below."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The odd spirals in this aerial photograph of Lakamas Lake are where Brent Yearoutsays the dragonfly-moving craft hovered on June 7, 2007.I don’t know. It was over the lake. But it was not a helicopter. There were no blades on it.There were no props. It had a nose on it. I understand how airplanes work and stuff. Awing – there was not anything that resembled a wing. Even the appendages. The nose?Maybe it resembled a wing, but there was no leading edge on it. It was all the same width.WHEN YOU SAY ‘NOSE,’ WHAT DO YOU MEAN?When I say ‘nose,’ it had a different thing on the front. The front of it was a differentappendage than the other ones. The other ones looked like spikes or spears.SO HOW IS THE NOSE DIFFERENT?It was long and it was flat. The other appendages seemed to be bulkier for some reason.And I could see where they joined the body, it looked like there were couplers. It almostlooked like a transformer to me with the wire structure and couplers everywhere like thething that went out the front. It seemed like there was a coupler there. Loud Static, Ozone Smell and “Dragonfly”Twitched As If MalfunctioningOne of the things that went through my head is that the thing was hurt or injured or thatsomething was malfunctioning is what I felt like because of the way it was twitching. And Istarted to smell something that smelled like ozone. I don’t know if you know what ozonesmells like, but it’s like a burned circuit board and this thing is making this ungodly noiseand it seemed like forever. I looked around and there still were no cars, no nothing. AndI’m thinking this is so weird!TWITCHING? WHAT DO YOU MEAN?Like almost every time it made the static sound, it would shudder or something. It satthere, but it was like the static was so loud and like it was a part of the craft. I could notsee any thrusters going down. I was looking for a propeller in the middle is what I wasthinking because I’ve played with radio-controlled stuff. And I did not see anything likethat. And the noise it made is what got me the worst.It looked like the appendage that was facing me, which would have been the right side ofit, rotated. It looked like the appendages rotated and the ring stayed still almost. And theappendages rotated to the left and went directly away from me and then I could see anappendage sticking out the rear. And it went like zip, zip and it was gone! I could see rightup the Columbia River Gorge, right up towards Mount Hood and Bonneville Dam – boom!The thing was not very thick. It was thin! I think that’s why everyone was calling themdrones because they are so small. There was not enough structure there to house anyone,not a person, unless they were very, very small people!There was no pilot, you know? So, I’m looking around and figure this has to be someelectrically operated – something that is operating off of an arc or something. I don’t get itbecause I could smell it and I could hear the crackling sound."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"This thing zipped off and I sat there for a second and realize I’ve got a camera in my glovebox and I’m going, ‘What an idiot! Nobody is ever going to believe this!’ Brent Hurried Home to AirbrushSketches of Odd CraftI had a car in my garage that I was working on (spray painting). I don’t live far from wherethis happened, so I drove up the road and came in and I just grabbed my airbrush and theyhave these little, black boards I use to make sure I’ve got the right line on my airbrush andstuff. And I fuzzed in a picture of it – a little circle with the appendages with collars onthem. And the phone rings and it’s my friend, Tim, whose house I was looking at to makecertain the police officers weren’t going there. It was him on the phone and he said,‘You’re not going to believe what just happened to me!’And I’m like, ‘What?’He says, ‘I went out in the yard because all these cops were going by.’I said, ‘I know, I just came up the hill. Where did they all go?’He said he didn’t know, but he walked out into the yard to see where they were going, litup a cigarette. ‘I’m standing there and I see a helicopter, right? coming down.’I go, ‘No way!’He goes, ‘Yeah, why?’I said, ‘Tim, I was coming up the hill when all those cops went by and I saw the same thingyou saw. Was it making any noise?’He goes, ‘Oh, it was weird! It didn’t make sound.’He saw the exact same thing I saw. The only difference is that he thought he saw lights onit. It was the evening and the sun was setting, and it would have been up high enough toreflect some light. But Tim swears to God that it looked like it had two headlights on it andmoving back and forth, like looking, like snooping.’I go, ‘Really?’He says, ‘Yeah, and then it stopped and took off going that way.’ He would have beencloser than I was, but he was underneath it. He was down at the lake level. And I’mseveral hundred feet above him on the hill and the craft was about level with me. When itwent took off, it was probably closer to him than it was me and Tim said he could see airthrough the bottom of it. And it had the nose, the exact same thing. Tim's Perspective from Below the Aerial CraftSo, Tim came over and we just kind of drew it. I tried to draw what Tim was telling me. It’sa torn, black hard board that I use for scratch paper, basically.UP THERE ON THE FAR RIGHT, IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE’S PHOTOGRAPHS IN2007 OF WHAT WE’RE CALLING THE DRAGONFLY DRONES BECAUSE OF THEWAY THEY MOVE .The one at the top is what Tim saw – that’s what he said he could see from the lake. I drewit for him, I did the airbrush for him. But see, he was underneath the craft."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Brent Yearout airbrushed as Tim described what he saw from below the aerialobject that had four appendages on one side, one on the other side and a long, flat “nose.”Airbrush sketch © 2007 by Brent Yearout. Brent Yearout's Perspective LookingSideways At the Aerial CraftAirbrushed sketches on torn work board of strange aerial craft seenfrom the side by Brent Yearout (brighter white object) and from underneathby his friend, Tim, (top center ring with appendages) on June 7, 2007,in Camas, Washington. Airbrushed images © 2007 by Brent Yearout.What I saw from where I was at was like the big one I air brushed with the lightningcoming out of it. I was on the side of it. Tim was below it.THAT’S WHY HE COULD SEE MORE OF THE APPENDAGES.Right, and that’s why he said he could see more than one thing sticking out the back.When the thing took off, I thought all those things rotated, but I was looking at it from theside.And I told Tim, ‘I remember it looked like it had some bent antennas on it.’He said, ‘What do you mean?’I said, ‘It’s got an antenna or something on top. I saw an antenna , but it looked like it wasbent.’ And I thought that was really weird."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"We sat there with an airbrush and I’d paint a little and then he’d try a little bit. I did onesort of front on like he thought with the lights. And then I was playing with it and I hadbeen doing lightning airbrush on this car. And I’m going, ‘I could smell ozone.’ And wekept talking about the cracking sound and comparing it to electrical popping or a speakersquare-waving. And I said, ‘I don’t know why, but I just feel like lightning and electricityand I drew the lightning through it. Size of Strange CraftON THIS PARTICULAR OBJECT THAT YOU AND TIM SAW THAT SEEMS TO BEVERY SIMILAR TO THE DRONES THAT PEOPLE WERE SEEING IN MAY and JUNE2007, WHAT DO THE TWO OF YOU ESTIMATE WAS THE LENGTH OF WHAT YOUSAW AND HEIGHT OF WHAT YOU SAW?It was not very thick. It was very thin top to bottom. But it was long. If I was to take thering, the top of my car would probably fit in it and I drive a 4-door. So, I would say thewhole thing was probably 40 feet long with the appendages included. Body-wise, I wouldsay the circular part of it – the ring – was maybe 8, 10, 12 feet across.HOW THICK WOULD IT BE?I’m going to have to say a foot maybe? Maybe two feet thick at the most.REALLY THIN!Really thin. It looked like all the appendages in the back came together in the back orsomething and the nose rotated and they all came together. Then it looked like an arrow.If this thing was propelling itself with some sort of thrust that was keeping it up above thewater of the lake where I saw it, there would have been some motion in the water. But thewater was glass-smooth. Odd Stop and Start \"Dragonfly\" MotionWHAT’S THE STRANGEST PART OF WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING AT?The noise and the way the thing rotated and moved because it was really like mechanical.That’s what got me. The eeriest thing about it though, to be honest with you, was the fact Icould not explain it to myself!THAT VERY STRANGE MECHANICAL MOTION IS WHY IN 2007 SOME PEOPLEUSED THE METAPHOR IN THE BEGINNING: ‘YOU KNOW HOW DRAGONFLIESSTOP AND START?’That’s how it flew – like a dragonfly – zzzz – zzz – zzz – zzz - That jerky motion. Yeah,that’s how it moved, the way a dragonfly stops on a dime and just sit there and hover.That’s what it was like. And I’m thinking, ‘This is not right.’ That’s when it did its littlerotating thing. I can’t say for sure that the appendages rotated and the ring stayed still, butit sure appeared to be that way.HOW HIGH WAS THIS OBJECT OVER THE WATER?I’d say 200 feet high.IT’S 200 FEET ABOVE THE WATER AND HOW FAR FROM YOU?150 yards.A LITTLE MORE THAN A FOOTBALL FIELD AWAY.Yes, not far. It was just right even with my window in my car. And the way it took off, thefirst thing I tried to tell myself and I asked Tim, ‘Could you see through the bottom of it?’When it went off in that direction into the Gorge, that was closest to Tim. He said it wasmoving too fast for him to see up through the thing clearly, but he knew it was hollow.HOW CLOSE DO YOU THINK TIM WAS?Well, at first he was probably farther away from where I first saw it when it stopped. ButTim had a perfectly clear view of it where it stopped and rotated. He was probably half amile away. The craft was above the lake and Tim has a perfect dead view of the lake right"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"there. He can look right up the lake and where the craft rotated, it went back up towardsthe hills where it came from basically, but it went East and right up past the Camas HighSchool, like right over the top of it and then boom! it was gone. So Tim was closer to itwhen it took off than I was. But in the beginning, he was probably a half-mile away. Whenit took off, it went right towards his house and over the Camas High School, which is onlyfour blocks away from Tim’s house. Did Camas “Dragonfly” Have CurvedWires Rising from Ring?IN ALL OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS OF 2007, THERE IS A SORT OF CROWN OFWIRES THAT CURVE COMING UP OUT OF THE RING. DID YOU AND TIM SEETHAT AS CLEARLY (Brent does have faint curves rising above his sketch)?Well, I saw one, what I thought was one antenna on it is what I was thinking. But again,from my angle – and I was looking from the side – I was looking for something that waspropelling it. I didn’t care there was a wire on top, but I was looking for suspension wires.I was looking for a propeller in the ring and that the whole thing might be radio-controlled.But Tim could see through the ring and there was nothing there. It does not make sense.It’s impossible! So, we agreed at that time (June 7, 2007) that instead of telling anybodyabout it, let’s just shut up because people will think we’re retards, you know?! (laughs)Tim, who is more into electronics said it sounded like a speaker square-waving. Asquare-wave can make an ungodly sound. I told him it sounded to me like a TV late atnight when you wake up and it’s going ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ (makes loud static sound) andreally super loud![ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - A square wave is a kind of non-sinusoidalwaveform, most typically encountered in electronics and signal processing. Anideal square wave alternates regularly and instantaneously between twolevels.Origins and UsesSquare waves are universally encountered in digital switching circuits and arenaturally generated by binary (two-level) logic devices. They are used astiming references or \"clocks,\" because their fast transitions are suitable fortriggering synchronous logic circuits at precisely determined intervals.However, square waves contain a wide range of harmonics; these cangenerate electromagnetic radiation or pulses of current that interfere withother nearby circuits, causing noise or errors. To avoid this problem in verysensitive circuits such as precision analog-to-digital converters, sine waves areused instead of square waves as timing references. Additionally, the distortioneffect used on electric guitar clips the outermost regions of the waveform,causing it to increasingly resemble a square wave as more distortion isapplied.]That’s why I couldn’t believe that nobody else has seen it or said anything about it. Maybeeveryone has the same idea I did – some things are better left unsaid! Loud Static Versus Low HissWHAT’S INTERESTING IS THAT ALL OF THE OTHER SIGHTINGS IN WHICHTHERE WERE PHOTOGRAPHS, EVERYONE SAID THEY EITHER COULD NOTHEAR ANYTHING OR THEY HEARD, IN CHAD’S CASE, A KIND OF HISSINGSOUND.Oh, he did hear something?YES, AND HE EMAILED ME ASKING IF I THOUGHT THERE WAS ANY DANGERFROM WHATEVER THEY WERE EMITTING THAT HAD ELECTROSTATIC SOUND,BUT NOT LOUD. Plasma Propulsion?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Plasma ball.Have you ever seen one of those plasma balls? They have the electrostatic arcs inside thatgo out. Well, that’s what I kind of felt like that the thing was emitting plasma or somethingand that is what is keeping it afloat. And I smelled what I thought was ozone.IF THESE OBJECTS ARE SOMETHING THAT OUR GOVERNMENT HAS EITHERBACK-ENGINEERED OR PRODUCED ...I’m going to be pissed!... WHAT DO YOU THINK THEIR MISSION IS?I don’t know. Can I tell you what I felt about it all along? I’m really good about havingfeelings towards stuff. It’s worked out really good for me in the stock market, so I’ll tellyou right now. I almost felt like the thing was prospecting. It was like a research vehicle.It’s looking for something. They are looking for gold is what I thought.IF THESE DRAGONFLY DRONES ARE NOT MADE BY OUR GOVERNMENT ORANY OTHER GOVERNMENT ON EARTH AND ARE IN FACT ARE SOME KIND OFMONITORING DEVICE FROM SOME OTHER PLACE...Some place else?YES. HOW DOES THAT LEAVE YOU THINKING AND FEELING?I’m concerned about the whole situation a little bit because I know that whatever it was, Ifelt like it was aware that I was watching it. And it knew I could see it. I felt like it knew Iwas looking at it. And I felt like this thing knows that I’m looking at it and it knows it canbe seen and it did not like it, OK? And it wanted to get out of there.When I said it was looking for something, real fidgety back and forth – it was like it waslooking for a place to run. And if it is something from somewhere else, we’re beingsurveyed. Those are surveyors and I don’t know what they are looking for, but I think theyare prospecting for something.If it is somebody surveying from another world, I guess they’ve got the right idea becausethey are making it so we can’t see them.” Email from Chicago, Illinois, “Drone” EyewitnessAfter the Camas, Washington, report was filed at Earthfiles, I received this eyewtinessaccount by email on May 23, 2008, about a sighting on New Years Eve, December 31,2005.“Subject: Drone in downtown Chicago 2005Date: May 23, 2008 12:44:10 AM MDTTo : earthfiles@earthfiles.comLinda Moulton Howe,I read about the dragonfly drones on your site and it reminded meof an experience i had 3 years ago.

I was looking into the other lit windows of thehigh-rises around, people watching... when i saw something thatlooked like it was hanging on the side of a building maybe 2blocks away. I thought at first it was a window washing scaffold,but noticed it was moving slowly up towards the right side of thebuilding at a 45 degree angle.I realized what I was looking at was an object with a tail hoveringunattached to the building. The tail pointed away from thebuilding. It was not even close to looking like a helicopter as ithad voids at the top and bottom i could see with no rotors, orcockpit. I saw it for about a full 2 minutes before it \"sparkled\"and de-materialized right before it turned the corner. I couldn'tbelieve what i saw. i yelled for my wife to come look but she couldn't get there intime. The photos i have seen of dragon fly drones on your websiteare similar, although i think this one was about the size of aVolkswagen beetle, judging by the size of the glass on thebuilding. When it \"sparkled\" it was faint, and definitely not like afirecracker. It flickered a few times before fading out. The skinitself was a weird charcoal greyish matte finish, but there wasdefinitely an underlying glow to it, that drew my attention there inthe first place. I had the impression this object was looking intothe windows as well, but being very stealthy. It was an oddexperience. I have never seen anything like that. I was wonderingif you had received any other sightings like this. It seems mosthave been in rural areas. This was right downtown Chicago.
