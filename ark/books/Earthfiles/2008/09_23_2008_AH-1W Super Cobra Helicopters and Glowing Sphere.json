S. Marine, Camp Lejeune, NC September 23, 2008 Camp Lejeune, Jacksonville, North Carolina - Recently Ireceived an email from a U. S. Marine stationed at Camp Lejeune, near Jacksonville,North Carolina.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Camp Lejeune is home to the II MarineExpeditionary Force, 2nd Marine Division, three other major Marinecommands, and a Naval hospital. The main base is supplemented by foursatellite facilities: Camp Geiger, Stone Bay, Courthouse Bay, Camp Johnson,and the latest addition to the facility, the Greater Sandy Run Training Area.When added to the main base and MCAS Cherry Point, they make up thelargest concentration of Marines and U.S. Navy sailors in the world.]He has been in the Marine Corps for two years and wanted me to know about a startlingaerial incident he watched back on Friday, May 21, 2008, and has not disclosed until now.In early May, 2008, I had reported in 050208 Earthfiles about a glowing, pearlescentsphere that “crashed” in Decatur, Alabama, the night of April 25, 2008. The 3-foot-diameter sphere, according to eyewitnesses, was retrieved by military in an ambulancedriven to an unnamed installation in Huntsville, Alabama. The Camp Lejeune emailer laterheard a rebroadcast of my news update about the Decatur incident on Coast to Coast AMwith George Noory that reminded him of what he had encountered.Subject: May 2008 weird light/orb on Marine Corps AirbaseCherry Point, NCDate: September 22, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“Miss Howe, I am a United States Marine stationed at Camp Lejeune, NC. Ihave been in the Marine Corps for a couple of years, almost, and this incidentoccurred on Friday, 21 May, 2008, at or around 2000/8:00 PM. I don't believein UFOs or that aliens would visit us, but I cannot come up with anyexplanation for what I saw. I heard an old Coast to Coast AM recording myfriend passed on to me (I intend to listen to that show when I return fromdeployment to Iraq. I really like you and George, and I'm up late anyway) andyou were talking about such things, and it seemed to click with what I saw,and I feel very uncomfortable about everything. I have never told anyone this,and I made this e-mail as a pretext for security's sake, and registered it, andam sending you this e-mail, from behind a proxy server that should give anISP somewhere in Germany. I'm telling you this because I want you to knowthat I take this really seriously and I'm concerned about people knowing whatI saw and the dumb shit I was doing.To begin with, I had weekend liberty from Camp Lejeune that Friday, May 21,2008, starting pretty early. I didn't have much to do, or much money, and Ihad heard from a friend in the air wing that there were a bunch of neat andpoorly maintained roads out in the middle of Cherry Point airbase. I could getin and out with no problem, because Marines are generally allowed onto otherMarine bases with little or no questions asked, and since it was the weekend,there probably wasn't any training going on, and I could drive the dirt roads atany speed I pleased with no disturbances and few problems. I also brought myMossberg shotgun, which I had recently updated with night-sights (Tritiumvials, so you can get a sight picture in the dark), so I thought I would stay late,and see how they worked shooting targets at night, and that's exactly what Istarted out doing. I also took my Nikon DSLR and my lenses for it, in case"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"there was something cool to shoot pictures of.I'm apprehensive of going into some details, because technically I probablywasn't supposed to be back there, and I certainly wasn't supposed to betearing up the dirt roads in my awd import like I was, and the Marine Corpsdoesn't know that I have my shotgun, and I definitely wasn't supposed to beshooting that out there, even though I was being very safe with it, as mostMarines are with any sort of weapon.Further, when I stopped at the PX on base, I bought some beer that was onsale, along with some soda and other crap. I figured I'd drink the beer when Igot back to my barracks, and that I might as well pick it up here as on CampLejeune, whose smaller PX is never stocked as well, and on Friday night isvery, very crowded with Marines buying beer or other liquors.I drove around the trails for a while, enjoying driving dangerously with outhaving to worry about police, MPs, or bystanders, and I would pause to rest ormake a head call and to take in the scenery, take a couple shots with myNikon, mostly to familiarize myself with it, as I'm pretty new to digitalphotography.It started to get dark out, and I found a good place to do some shooting. It wasa small clearing, pretty far removed from anywhere (I don't even know if Iwas on government property), and had a gently sloping hill that would make abackdrop to shoot into. I set up my empty soda cans and started shooting. Iwas enjoying myself until I heard helicopters in the distance, which wasn'tuncommon, it being an airbase, but these sounded weird, and were headingdirectly towards my position.Although I'm a crappy photographer, I'm definitely a military buff, and I knowa lot more about most weapon systems than the average Infantry marine does.They sounded like Cobras, and I was really surprised when I saw them comingtowards me. The forest wasn't really tall, but in the clearing I didn't see themuntil they were pretty close.It was a definite pair of AH-1W SuperCobras, and they looked like they wereflying blacked out, like they do at night for training sometimes, but they wereflying really, really close together and they couldn't have been more thanthirty or forty feet above tree level, which is suicidal. I've never seen anyhelicopter drop below 100 feet, and they must have been going almost 200miles an hour. I have never seen a helicopter go that fast. They whipped pastme so fast I hardly had time to see anything.USMC Bell AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopter taking off from an amphibiousassault ship. Source: http://www.navy.mil.[ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - The Bell AH-1 SuperCobra is atwin-engine attack helicopter based on the US Army's AH-1Cobra. The twin Cobra family includes the AH-1J SeaCobra, theAH-1T Improved SeaCobra, and the AH-1W SuperCobra. TheAH-1W is the backbone of the United States Marine Corps'sattack helicopter fleet, but will be replaced in service by theAH-1Z Viper upgrade in the next decade, 2010 to 2020.]They buzzed me, almost right over the clearing that I was in, so close to the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"ground that I got fucked up by the rotor wash when they passed by. I thoughtthey were doing some weird training, at first, and kind of laughed to myselfbecause the officers flying were probably pretty pissed that they weren't outon libbo, but what struck me strangest of all was that they had a bright whitelight in between them, so that it almost looked like they had a spotlight strungon wire between them, but when they passed I saw that it was definitely wasnot a spotlight. It was a perfect sphere or orb, and it was very, very bright. Ican't really describe it better than saying that it was a glowing ball of somekind, slightly in front of the engine, and maybe about level with the cockpits.It was the most amazing white color, and it didn't have any of the weird bluetinge that fluorescents give off, and it didn't have any trace of any other colorto it.I saw it move directly up and straight up maybe five hundred feet withoutstopping or slowing. One second, the glowing sphere was between the twoCobras; the next it was moving vertical with out any sort of turn, and it startedmaking amazing, impossible 90-degree turns in the air, which is something Iknow no sort of aircraft can do at those speeds, which is beyond my ability toguess at, because of the range and the lack of any backdrop. It was justmoving really, really fast and erratically. The two helicopters banked hard tothe right and started to come around in a circular or oval shape, just like theydo when they are going to start a gun run on a ground target, and I thought fora second it might be some sort of aerial target and that it, and maybe me, wereabout to get strafed or targeted with a missile.But I don't think it was anything like that, because the glowing sphere made asort of dart or jump at the first helicopter, which immediately popped flaresand chaff and began diving and moving erratically, while the other helicopterlined straight up with it.I tried to take some pictures with my Nikon, but I'm sure you can understandthat they came out really badly, because I was shooting at really fast movingthings pretty far away in bad light with basically a starter kit package, and Imade a huge mistake, because when I tried to adjust the shutter speed, I musthave turned the flash back on, and when I held down the shutter oncontinuous, my flash popped several times, which was really bright in the kindof twilight and easily noticed from the air.By the time I took the photos, the helicopters and the light had zipped awayfrom me and I couldn't see them over the trees. I was packing my shit up,because I had no idea what I had just seen and I felt very strongly that Ishould immediately get the fuck out of there. As I was getting into my car, thehelicopters came back, and began to circle around my position, and I basicallyfreaked out.One of the weirdest things about it was that both Cobras were fully loaded upwith rocket pods and with what could only have been AIM sidewinderair-to-air missiles, which is a really unusual load out for Cobras, becausethey're more supposed to be ground attack helicopters. I know they weresidewinders because they looked fucking huge attached under the cobras, andthat kind of spiky looking rocket is really recognizable.I turned my cars lights off and drove away as fast as I could, and it only tookme a minute or two to realize that I was A) Making shit speed with my lightsoff and B) that it didn't matter, because Cobra gun ships have at thermals, orat least night vision. I don't know how long they circled me, but I drove as fastas I could and ended up totaling the underside of my car and bending theframe up under my hood so it doesn't fit flush anymore (It's in the shop now,and thank God, no one cared to ask questions.). I drove in the generaldirection of the highway, and put my car through the ditch between thehighway and the forest. A lot of the backwoods trails have outlets to thehighway, and I guess I was lucky to get there as fast as I did, which wasexactly blind luck.I did not stop driving south until I got to Newport, where I ditched my car in aparking lot. I didn't know if the helicopters were still following me, or ifsomeone else was, because I'm sure the helicopters saw my cameras flash andthey were circling my location instead of doing something else or headingback, and they couldn't have had much fuel left after going that fucking fast.I left my car there for a while, and paid cash at a cheap diner where I could sitand watch my car. I continued south several hours later down towardsMotorhead City and then back to Camp Lejeune."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I haven't told anyone what I saw, and I'm still not sure what it was. The onlything I understand is that I do not think its physically possible for something tomove like the light ball did, and the pilots were definitely acting really strange.I don't think they normally train to drop flares and chaff, to avoid any sort ofmissile lock, because I think that's expensive, and I didn't even know thatMarine Corps helicopters could carry sidewinder missiles until I saw themmounted on the Cobras.”Also see: Spherical UFOs Filmed by NASA in Space: http://noolmusic.com/videos/spherical_ufos_filmed_by_nasa_in_space.phpMore Information:For further reports about glowing spheres, please see other reports below in the Earthfiles Archive:• 08/26/2008 — Update: Earthfiles Viewer Comments About UFOs and 14th Century BlackDeath• 08/22/2008 — UFOs and 14th Century Black Death• 08/12/2008 — Part 2: Rise of Fourth Reich -Where Is the Nazi “Die Glocke?”• 08/01/2008 — Part 1: Rise of Fourth Reich in America?• 07/26/2008 — Part 1: Why No Military Response to Radar Unknown Headed to BushCrawford Ranch on January 8, 2008?• 07/13/2008 — Part 6: Insights from An Experiencer with Greys and Blond Humanoids• 06/15/2008 — Part 3: Insights from An Experiencer with Greys and Blond Humanoids• 06/06/2008 — Updated: Mysterious Crash Near Needles, California• 05/22/2008 — Pregnant Cow Mutilation in Stockholm, Saskatchewan, Canada• 05/06/2008 — Viewer Comments on Decatur, Alabama, White Sphere Incident• 05/06/2008 — What Are the Strange “Pearls” in Google Map Images?• 05/02/2008 — 3-Foot-Diameter Sphere Retrieved By Ambulance in Decatur, Alabama• 04/24/2008 — Strange Aerial Lights Like Texas -
