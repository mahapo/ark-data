To have primordialmaterial coming out from inside a Saturn moon raises many questions on the formationof the Saturn system.” - Hunter Waite, a Principal Investigator, Cassini MissionOn Wednesday, March 12, 2008, NASA's Cassini spacecraft flewalong the south pole of Enceladus to sample water-ice, dust and gas in the geyser plumesthat erupt there. This was the first of four Cassini flybys of Enceladus planned for 2008,the second coming in August. Image 2007 by Cassini-Huygens spacecraft. March 30, 2008 Pasadena, California - NASA reported this week:NASA's Cassini spacecraft tasted and sampled a surprising organic brewerupting in geyser-like fashion from Saturn's moon Enceladus during a closeflyby on March 12. Scientists are amazed that this tiny moon is so active,\"hot\" and brimming with water vapor and organic chemicals.New heat maps of the surface show higher temperatures than previouslyknown in the south polar region, with hot tracks running the length of giantfissures. Additionally, scientists say the organics \"taste and smell\" like some ofthose found in a comet. The jets themselves harmlessly peppered Cassini,exerting measurable torque on the spacecraft, and providing an indirectmeasure of the plume density."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Heat radiating from the entire length of 150 kilometer (95 mile)-long fracturesis seen in this best-yet heat map of the active south polar region of Saturn's ice moonEnceladus. Heat map credit: NASA/JPL/GSFC/SwRI/SSI.The warmest parts of the fractures tend to lie on locations of the plume jetsidentified in earlier images, shown in the annotated version with yellow stars.The measurements were obtained by the Cassini spacecraft's CompositeInfrared Spectrometer from the spacecraft's close flyby of the moon on March12, 2008.Remarkably high temperatures, at least 180 Kelvin (minus 135 degreesFahrenheit) were registered along the brightest fracture, named DamascusSulcus, in the lower left portion of the image. For comparison, surfacetemperatures elsewhere in the south polar region of Enceladus are below 72Kelvin (minus 330 degrees Fahrenheit).Heat is escaping from Enceladus' interior along these warm fractures, dubbed\"tiger stripes,\" which are also the source of the geysers that erupt from thepolar region. The infrared radiation was mapped at wavelengths between 12and 16 microns. The infrared data, shown in false color, are superimposed ona grayscale image mosaic of the south pole obtained by Cassini's cameras onJuly 14, 2005, during the previous close Enceladus flyby. Numbers on themap indicate latitude and longitude.This new view shows that at least three of the south polar fractures are activealong almost their full lengths--the fourth one, on the right, was only partiallycovered by this scan. The level of activity varies greatly along the fractures.The warmest parts of the fractures tend to lie on locations of the plume jetsidentified in earlier images. The main \"tiger stripe\" fractures are not the onlysources of heat, however; additional warm spots are seen in the upper rightpart of the scan. The warm regions are probably concentrated within less thana few hundred meters (a few hundred yards) of the fractures, and theirapparent width in this image results from the relatively low resolution of theinfrared data.This map was made by scanning the south pole during the period from 16 to37 minutes after closest approach to Enceladus, at a distance between 14,000and 32,000 kilometers (about 8,700 and 20,000 miles) as Cassini rapidlyreceded from its close (50-kilometer or 32-mile) flyby.\"A completely unexpected surprise is that the chemistry of Enceladus, what'scoming out from inside, resembles that of a comet,\" said Hunter Waite,principal investigator for the Cassini Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer atthe Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. \"To have primordial materialcoming out from inside a Saturn moon raises many questions on the formationof the Saturn system.\"\"Enceladus is by no means a comet. Comets have tails and orbit the sun, andEnceladus' activity is powered by internal heat while comet activity ispowered by sunlight. Enceladus' brew is like carbonated water with anessence of natural gas,\" said Waite."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"QuickTime (2 MB)New structure, density and composition measurements of Enceladus’water plume were obtained when the Cassini spacecraft’s Ultraviolet ImagingSpectrograph observed the star zeta Orionis pass behind the plumeOct. 24, 2007, as seen in this animation.New structure, density and composition measurements of Enceladus’ waterplume were obtained when the Cassini spacecraft’s Ultraviolet ImagingSpectrograph observed the star zeta Orionis pass behind the plume Oct. 24,2007, as seen in this animation.The Ion and Neutral Mass Spectrometer saw a much higher density of volatilegases, water vapor, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, as well as organicmaterials, some 20 times denser than expected. This dramatic increase indensity was evident as the spacecraft flew over the area of the plumes.New high-resolution heat maps of the south pole by Cassini's CompositeInfrared Spectrometer show that the so-called tiger stripes, giant fissures thatare the source of the geysers, are warm along almost their entire lengths, andreveal other warm fissures nearby. These more precise new measurementsreveal temperatures of at least minus 93 degrees Celsius (minus 135Fahrenheit.) That is 17 degrees Celsius (63 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer thanpreviously seen and 93 degrees Celsius (200 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer thanother regions of the moon. The warmest regions along the tiger stripescorrespond to two of the jet locations seen in Cassini images.\"These spectacular new data will really help us understand what powers thegeysers. The surprisingly high temperatures make it more likely that there'sliquid water not far below the surface,\" said John Spencer, Cassini scientist onthe Composite Infrared Spectrometer team at the Southwest ResearchInstitute in Boulder, Colo.Previous ultraviolet observations showed four jet sources, matching thelocations of the plumes seen in previous images. This indicates that gas in theplume blasts off the surface into space, blending to form the larger plume.Images from previous observations show individual jets and mark places fromwhich they emanate. New images show how hot spot fractures are related toother surface features. In future imaging observations, scientists hope to seeindividual plume sources and investigate differences among fractures.\"Enceladus has got warmth, water and organic chemicals, some of theessential building blocks needed for life,\" said Dennis Matson, Cassini projectscientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. \"We havequite a recipe for life on our hands, but we have yet to find the finalingredient, liquid water, but Enceladus is only whetting our appetites formore.\"At closest approach, Cassini was only 30 miles from Enceladus. When it flewthrough the plumes it was 120 miles from the moon's surface. Cassini's nextflyby of Enceladus is in August."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Blue-veined Enceladus,one of 57 moons of Saturn (as of 2007 count).More Information:For further information about Saturn and its moons, please see related Earthfiles reportsbelow in the Earthfiles Archive:• 02/13/2008 — Saturn's Titan Moon Has Greater Oil Reserves Than Earth• 01/12/2008 — Our Milky Way Galaxy On Collision Course with Huge Gas Cloud - 40Million Years from Now• 11/01/2007 — Gas Eruptions from Comet Holmes?• 10/18/2007 — A Quantum Math Description of Parallel Universes• 06/20/2007 — Update: What Is the Moving Light in Saturn's Rings?
