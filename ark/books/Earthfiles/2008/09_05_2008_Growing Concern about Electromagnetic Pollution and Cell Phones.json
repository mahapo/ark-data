September 5, 2008 Tucson, Arizona - “You cannot see it, taste it or smell it, but it is oneof the most pervasive environmental exposures in industrialized countries today.Electromagnetic radiation (EMR) or electromagnetic fields (EMFs) are the terms thatbroadly describe exposures created by the vast array of wired and wireless technologiesthat have altered the landscape of our lives in countless beneficial ways. However, thesetechnologies were designed to maximize energy efficiency and convenience – but not withbiological effects on people in mind. Based on new studies, there is growing evidenceamong scientists and the public about possible health risks associated with thesetechnologies.”Those words are from an August 2007 report written by fourteen scientists, public healthand public policy experts to document scientific evidence about electromagnetic fields andtheir impacts on biologies, including human brains and bodies. That 600-page text wasentitled, BioInitiative Report: A Rationale for a Biologically-based Public ExposureStandard for Electromagnetic Fields (ELF and RF). See BioInitiative Report.The scientists’ bottom line is disturbing: “What is clear is that the existing public safetystandards limiting these radiation levels in nearly every country of the world look to be"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"thousands of times too lenient. Changes are needed.” That means everyone is beingexposed to too much electromagnetic radiation and at the top of the list are microwavesfrom microwave cell towers and cell phones.A year after that BioInitiative report, it provoked Dr. Ronald Herberman, M. D., Directorof the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute, to issue an unprecedented warning on July23, 2008, to his faculty and staff entitled, “The Case for Precaution in the Use of CellPhones.” Dr. Herberman’s warning began, “Electromagnetic fields generated by cellphones should be considered a potential human health risk. Dr. Herberman lists elevenprecautions:“1. Do not allow children to use a cell phone except for emergencies. Thedeveloping organs of a fetus or child are the most likely to be sensitive to anypossible effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields.Estimation of the penetration of electromagnetic radiation from a cell phonebased on age (Frequency GSM 900 Mhz). On the right, a scale showing the SpecificAbsorption Rate at different depths, in W/kg. Source: Electromagnetic Absorptionin the Human Head and Neck for Cell Telephones at 835 and 1900 MHz.2. While communicating using your cell phone, try to keep the cell phoneaway from the body as much as possible. The amplitude of the electromagneticfield is one fourth the strength at a distance of two inches and fifty times lowerat three feet.3. Whenever possible, use the speaker-phone mode or a wireless Bluetoothheadset, which has less than 1/100th of the electromagnetic emission of anormal cell phone. Use of a hands-free ear piece attachment may also reduceexposures.4. Avoid using your cell phone in places, like a bus, where you can passivelyexpose others to your phone’s electromagnetic fields.5. Avoid carrying your cell phone on your body at all times. Do not keep itnear your body at night such as under the pillow or on a bedside table,particularly if pregnant. You can also put it on “flight” or “off-line” mode,which stops electromagnetic emissions.6. If you must carry your cell phone on you, make sure that the keypad ispositioned toward your body and the back is positioned toward the outside sothat the transmitted electromagnetic fields move away from your rather thanthrough you.7. Only use your cell phone to establish contact or for conversations lasting afew minutes as the biological effects are directly related to the duration ofexposure. For longer conversations, use a land line with a corded phone, not acordless phone, which uses electromagnetic emitting technology similar to thatof cell phones.8. Switch sides regularly while communicating on your cell phone to spreadout your exposure. Before putting your cell phone to the ear, wait until yourcorrespondent has picked up. This limits the power of the electromagnetic fieldemitted near your ear and the duration of your exposure.9. Avoid using your cell phone when the signal is weak or when moving at highspeed, such as in a car or train, as this automatically increases power to amaximum as the phone repeatedly attempts to connect to a new relay antenna.10. When possible, communicate via text messaging rather than making a call,limiting the duration of exposure and the proximity to the body.11. Choose a device with the lowest SAR possible (SAR = Specific AbsorptionRate, which is a measure of the strength of the magnetic field absorbed by thebody). SAR ratings of contemporary phones by different manufacturers areavailable by searching for “sar ratings cell phones” on the internet.”"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Electromagnetic pollution and its impact on human health has been the passionate concernof Libby Kelley, who received a Masters Degree in Public Health Administration from theUniversity of Southern California, and is now Managing Secretariat, InternationalCommission for Electromagnetic Safety (ICEMS), based in Tucson, Arizona. TheInternational Commission for Electromagnetic Safety is an international group of scientistsand medical doctors who do peer reviewed research on electrical and magnetic fields andelectromagnetic radiation based in Venice, Italy.Libby has worked to educate the public about the dangers of electromagnetic pollutionsince 1996. That was the year only 12 years ago that the Federal Telecommunications Actwas passed by Congress and signed by President Bill Clinton into law. Libby learned that amicrowave antenna was going to be placed at her child’s pre-school, which was in achurch. The telecom company agreed to pay the church $18,000 a year in exchange forusing the church’s cupola to place four microwave antennas. What astounded Libby Kelleyis no one could answer her questions about what microwave radiation might do to her childand the other children. Libby was also stunned that the new Federal Communications Actspecifically prohibited local governments from taking health concerns into account whenapproving microwave tower sites.Today as of September 3, 2008, there are now 1,947,083 microwave towers and antennasin the United States. [ See: http://www.antennasearch.com/ ] Also, by 2008, citizengroups are increasingly trying to prevent the addition of more microwave antennas bysaying “no” to telecom companies when they want to pay to put antennas in churches,schools or other public buildings. Los Angeles banned cell towers from school property.Interview:Libby Kelley, Managing Secretariat,ICEMS, Tucson, ArizonaLibby Kelley, M. A., Public Health Administration, Managing Secretariat,International Commission for Electromagnetic Safety (ICEMS), Tucson, Arizona: “Once people understand if they can get on top of this quickly, the antenna proposal doesnot go through. For example, Julie Kornstein, who is a member of the Los Angeles CitySchool District Board, got an ordnance through in 2000 banning cell towers on schoolproperty. The fact there is that ordnance in L. A. city schools has gone all over the worldand really inspired people.If you live in Los Angeles and you are driving to work and your kids are playing on schoolgrounds, even if the antenna isn’t on school property, the area where the school is locatedmight have a number of antennas. Increasingly it is becoming harder to find all of thembecause the industry is often forced to disguise them – which I prefer not to happenbecause I want to know where these are so I can avoid them.When the cell phone company comes calling to a church or school, they typically look fora private school and churches are very easy to work with because they usually need themoney.But in Los Angeles, like everywhere else, the cell phone companies come in a stealth-likemanner. They meet with the site owner. They offer something of mutual benefit. They say,‘We would be happy to help you with this roof, or finance this, or loan money for that andmake you a good offer in terms of an annual fee.’ They get a contract with the site owner.Once a contract is signed, the telecom company has the site owner over a barrel becausethey’ve made a commitment."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"And there is a growing understanding that it’s better to say no to these antennas becausethe science is becoming clearer all the time. The cell tower studies that have beenpublished since 2003 are starting to be very well done and show relationships to healtheffects. So if it happens in the future that these cell towers are really demonstrated to becausing harm, we might not be able to get the towers down. So, it’s better to not let them goup in the first place. It’s just not worth it.There is a lot more networking going on in this country among citizens, among publichealth advocates, scientists and medical doctors. I see the tipping point on this issue comingnow. It’s just that I don’t know how quickly we can move given the forces. This is a onetrillion dollar business globally, telecommunications.” The telecommunications industry is trying to stop all citizen influence on restricting celltower sites. On July 11, 2008, the Cellular Telephone Industries Association (CTIA),petitioned the FCC to declare new limitations on local zoning authority as it affects celltower siting. A deadline for public comments was set as September 15, 2008, by the FCCand click here for Public Notice for Comments.Specifically, CTIA requests the Federal Communications Commission to:1. Force municipalities to act on wireless antenna or tower zoning applicationswithin 45 or 75 days.2. Rule that applications are automatically \"deemed granted\" if a localgovernment misses the FCC's deadline.3. Prevent municipalities from considering the presence of service by othercarriers in evaluating an additional carrier's application for an antenna site.4. Pre-empt any local ordinance that would automatically require a variancefor cell tower applications. “LIBBY, THIS MEANS THAT THE FCC, UNDER PRESSURE OF CTIA, ISCONSIDERING TAKING THE TAX-PAYING PUBLIC OUT OF THE LOOP ONDECISIONS FOR THE PLACEMENT OF MICROWAVE TOWERS?That is exactly what is happening. How many towers do we need in this country or on theplanet?! This industry intends to create a planetary network of microwave antennas thatare inter-operable so we can all communicate, but our health is at stake. The planet’s healthis at stake. So, I really think we need to slow this down and the scientists I’m working withare calling for the development of biologically-based standards to take into account thescience that shows what happens to living organisms – not just people – far below theexisting electromagnetic radiation standards set by the FCC and other nations of the world.IF THERE ARE NEARLY TWO MILLION MICROWAVE ANTENNAS NOW IN THEUNITED STATES AND HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS MORE IN OTHER NATIONS OFTHE WORLD, HOW DO YOU PUT THE ELECTROMAGNETIC POLLUTION GENIEBACK IN THE BOTTLE?That’s the question that people really can’t answer. Nobody wants to be a simple-mindedLuddite and just say, ‘Turn it off. Let’s go back to a former time and pretend that none ofthis really happened.’[ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - The Luddites were an 1811 social movement ofBritish textile artisans who protested—often by destroying mechanizedlooms—against the changes produced by the Industrial Revolution, which theyfelt threatened their livelihood.]Technology always works this way. It happens and then the questions about efficacy andsafety and health always come later. We’re so in love with innovation. So, we’re all owningthis now. I tell people who call me concerned about an antenna, ‘If you are using a cellularphone. If you own cordless phones in your home and microwave ovens, you are aconsumer and you are supporting this microwave build-out.’ So people really need to taketheir consumer behavior into account.We’ve reached a point in most urban areas of the United States where we have anelectromagnetic smog condition and people who have immune problems such as electricalhypersensitivity are leaving those places. They can’t live there. They can’t work there.Something has got to change.”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Public Exposure: DNA, Democracy and the Wireless Revolution.DVD (58 minutes) co-produced by Libby Kelley, Council onWireless Technology Impacts and EON International, shown at the 2003World Social Forum in Porto Alegre, Brazil;awarded first place in the “Globalization” category at theSanta Cruz Earth Vision Film Festival, 2001.To order, click here.Continued in Part 2.More Information:EMR Network ACTION ALERTAugust 29, 2008Contact: Virginia Hinesinfo@EMRNetwork.org- Industry Group Seeks to Further Erode Local Controlof Wireless Antenna and Tower Siting.- Send Comments to the Federal Communications Commission(FCC) by September 15, 2008.Background:On July 11, 2008, the Cellular Telephone Industries Association (CTIA) ,petitioned the FCC to declare new limitations on local zoning authority as itaffects cell tower siting.
