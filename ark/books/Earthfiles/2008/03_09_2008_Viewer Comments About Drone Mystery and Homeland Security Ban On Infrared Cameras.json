Location andphotographer unidentified in MUFON report.Description of Sighting Report At MUFON Site“This object floated above the river for maybe less than 30 seconds, rotatingslightly, then winking out. My wife freaked out because we were still about 40minutes from takeout and had know where to go. We paddled over to the side andsat in the woods for about 20-30 minutes, but the mosquitos were eating us alive, sowe got back in the water. I got one photo off before it dissapeared. About 10seconds before it dissappeared, another circle thing seemed to pop out of the center,which is when my wife started screaming at me to take a picture, and that's whatyou see. I really don't want to know what it was, because to this day it gives us thecreeps, but since I saw the other one my wife thought it might be best to share theexperience. I'm not going to mention the name of the river because our cabin is nearthere.\"Photo: http://www.mufoncms.com/files/9840_submitter_file1__2002-07-2600012.jpg"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" 2) Subject: McAlester, Oklahoma Army Ammunition PlantDate: March 7, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“ I'm from McAlester, Oklahoma, and am familiar with the McAlester, Oklahoma,Army Ammunition Plant and the Hartshorne area.My father, uncle and an aunt worked at the plant for many years. I remember myaunt, now deceased, telling me about an event that happened, probably in the 1980s,as she was working the night shift in one of the plant buildings. She said that onemorning the power went out in her building around 2-3 a.m. The power remained offand eventually her supervisor sent everyone home.My aunt lived in Hartshorne, Oklahoma and she was part of a carpool of ladies whoalso lived in the Hartshorne area. From the plant to Hartshorne is approximately 10to 15 miles.As they were entering the Hartshorne area, one of the ladies spotted a bright ball oflight hovering over nearby railroad tracks. The light, which my aunt said was veryunusual, began to pace their car and eventually disappeared. She said they were allvery frightened, but they made it to their respective homes without further incident.The next night, my aunt reported the incident with the bright ball of light to hersupervisor. Her supervisor told her he had seen a bright ball of light outside theirbuilding before the power went out the previous night........................................I also remember talking many years ago to a McAlester veterinarian. I had heardthrough a friend that the vet had photographs of recently mutilated cattle near thelittle town of Arpaler, just west of McAlester, and just north, I believe, from theAmmunition Plant.My friend and I went to see the vet and he showed us the photos. To me, theylooked like the typical, mysterious mutilation scenario. I urged him to contact you,but I don't know if he ever did.................................Finally, this is an event that changed my life in terms of the UFO mystery. In 1957, Iwas a student at East Central State College in Ada, Oklahoma. Ada is about 60 mileswest of McAlester.One cloudless spring afternoon, a friend and I were walking across campus just afterwe had gotten off work. I happened to glance up at the sky to my left and I wasstartled to see a traditional ‘flying saucer,’ motionless in the sky. My friend also sawit.At the same time a professor was walking toward us, but before I could call hisattention to the ‘craft,’ it zoomed off to the southwest at blazing speed.” 3) Subject: Homeland Security Ban On Infrared Cameras.Date: March 5, 2008To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com“Hi Linda,I am a photography professor at a major college in the Midwest. Our departmentrecently placed a purchase order for a infrared digital still camera. We were shippedthe normal spectrum version of the camera with no explanation. When I called theNYC photo suppliers, I was informed that Homeland Security has placed a ban onthe sale of ALL digital still and video cameras with infrared capability! Only lawenforcement or other agencies can buy them with approval from the manufacturer.They cannot be shipped, but must be picked up in person. An end user license mustbe completed in the store.I immediately recalled your recent talk on Coast to Coast AM about there being‘something’ in the infrared spectrum our government does not want us to see. Ourphoto program merely wanted to buy the infrared camera for the interestinglandscape photographs IR is capable of recording. You can verify my email byfollowing this link to the Major Photo retailer.Earlier this year, Eastman Kodak suddenly and without warning stopped making"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"infrared film, which had been available for decades. No reason was given, but I nowbelieve this ban came from Homeland Security. Clearly there is something in theinfrared spectrum that the general public is not being permitted to see, or record.”Editor's Note: I have not been able to verify a Homeland Security official, or unofficial, ban onthe sale of infrared cameras. When I learn more, I'll report at Earthfiles. I welcome viewercomments and personal experiences: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
