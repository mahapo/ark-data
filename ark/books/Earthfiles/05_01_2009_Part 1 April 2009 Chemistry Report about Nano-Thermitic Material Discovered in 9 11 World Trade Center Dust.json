This would be expected for super-thermite formulations in order to produce high gas pressures from ignition and thus make them explosive.” - A pril 2009 Bentham Open Chemical Physics Journal, Volume 2 L eft: Photomicrograph of red/gray chip from samples of the WTC dust involved in this study. 31-page report with photomicrographs and spectra were published April 3, 2009, in The Open Chemical Physics Journal. Right: Red-gray residues of burnt thermite used by railway workers to cut or weld railroad tracks shown in Wikipedia. May 1, 2009 Copenhagen, Denmark - On April 4, 2009, I received an email in which the subject line said: “Active Thermitic Material Discovered in Dust from the 9/11 World Trade Center Catastrophe.” A hot link was included and I ended up at a website entitled Bentham Open Access, The 2009 Open Chemical Physics Journal, Volume 2, where I clicked on DOWNLOAD . A 25-page PDF with many color photomicrographs and spectra ended up on my desktop. See: Bentham Open Chemical Physics Journal, Vol. 2. First, I researched thermite and learned that aluminum mixed with iron in specific ways can create short bursts of extremely high temperatures. Thermite heating can be used for cutting or welding steel such as railroad tracks without requiring heavy equipment. Back in the early 1990s, about a decade before September 2001, scientists at Lawrence Livermore Laboratory in California began researching nanotechnology-produced thermite that could be used by the military. Normal thermite does not make sound while it heats through steel, but nanotechnologically produced “super-thermite” can produce high gas pressures that would be explosive. The Open Chemical Physics Journal paper begins: “We have discovered distinctive red/gray chips in all samples we have studied of the dust produced by the destruction of the World Trade Center.” The dust analyzed had been collected by four different residents who lived close to the World Trade Center. The paper states, “One sample was collected about ten minutes after the collapse of the second tower, so it cannot possibly have been contaminated by clean-up operations.” The paper also states: “Each sample was found to contain red/gray chips and iron-rich microspheres, which are also peculiar.” Twenty-five pages later, after laying out meticulous details in photomicrographs and spectra analysis of the red-gray chips and microspheres, the scientists conclude: “... the red layer of the red-gray chips we have discovered in the WTC dust is active, unreacted thermitic material, incorporating nanotechnology, and is a highly energetic pyrotechnic or explosive material.” "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" A t 8:45 AM Eastern on September 11, 2001, the World Trade Center North Tower (110 stories) was hit by American Airlines Flight #11. At 9:03 AM Eastern, the WTC South Tower (110 stories) was hit by United Airlines Flight #175. After burning for 59 minutes, at 10:02 AM Eastern, the South Tower on left in photo above, collapsed in a huge cloud of dust and debris, followed a half-hour later at 10:32 AM Eastern by the North Tower on right. World Trade Center Building 7 is the beige rectangular building (47 stories) in foreground across the street from WTC 1 and 2.

S even hours after the collapse of WTC 1 and 2, at 5:20 PM Eastern on September 11, 2001, 7 World Trade Center also collapsed straight down. After 9/11, Congress charged the Department of Commerce to investigate how the WTC towers and Building 7 collapsed straight down. So, the Dept. of Commerce under then-Secretary Donald Evans organized a World Trade Center Federal Building and Fire Safety Investigation Team under its National Institute of Standards and Technology, known as NIST. Page 9 of a NIST-prepared question and answer summary about the collapse of WTC Building 7, states: Q: “Why didn't NIST investigators look at actual steel samples from WTC 7? A: Steel samples were removed from the site before the NIST investigation began. In the immediate aftermath of September 11, debris was removed rapidly from the site to aid in recovery efforts and facilitate emergency responders' efforts to work around the site. Once it was removed from the scene, the steel from WTC 7 could not be clearly identified. Unlike the pieces of steel from WTC 1 and WTC 2, which were painted red and contained distinguishing markings, WTC 7 steel did not contain such identifying characteristics.” So I learned that steel beam supports for the two tall World Trade Towers had been painted red, but not Building 7 (47 floors constructed in 1985). Could the red painted-steel-beams used in the original WTC 1 and 2 (110 stories) construction that began in 1966, at the urging of Chase Manhattan Bank Chairman David Rockefeller, explain the red color on the red-gray chips described in the Bentham journal? My next step was to call the lead author on the Bentham journal paper, Niels H. Harrit, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Chemistry at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark. Prof. Harrit received his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Copenhagen in 1975, followed by a year at the Max Planck Institute in Munich, Germany, and in 1977, another year of post-doctoral work at Columbia University in New York City. Interview: Niels H. Harrit, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Chemistry, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark: “These red/gray chips were first discovered by Dr. Steven E. Jones because there has been after lots of indication that thermitic material had been used. First of all, molten iron in the remains of Ground Zero and molten iron was pouring out of the South Tower minutes before it collapsed. And this alone is a severe indication that thermite has been present. Furthermore, the finding of small spheres of iron in the dust in abundance, in great amount of small iron spheres in the dust. When an iron particle is perfectly round, it means that it has been a liquid and it has been flying."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"A pril 2009 Benthan Open Journal: “Fig. 20. Photomicrographs of residues from red/gray chips ignited in the Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). Notice the shiny-metallic spheres and translucent spheres. Each blue scale-marker represents 50 microns.” MEANING FLYING IN THE AIR? Yes, this means that these iron particles that are abundant in the WTC dust. This is molten iron that has been droplets and automatically forms spheres. So, these two observations: 1. Molten iron coming out of the tower and being found under the towers for weeks and months after the collapse of the towers and Building 7, and 2. Finding spherical iron particles in the dust indicate that thermite has been used. So, there was a good reason to say, ‘Hey, let’s take a look at the dust. Maybe there is something left.’ These red-gray chips are not easily discovered or seen because they are small. The biggest of them are around 1 millimeter and maybe a little more. They can be, if you are lucky, seen by the naked eye. But most of them are less than that, which means that you have to get the dust under a microscope in order to find them. Luckily, the chips are magnetic, which means you can take a strong magnet and pull it along side with a plastic bag and extract the red-gray chips together with the iron spheres. So, you isolate the magnetic material from the dust. This way, you automatically get a high concentration of the chips and they are more easily discovered under the microscope. But still, you need a microscope to see them. So, these red-gray chips, this is the most important aspect or quality of these chips – they are active! The chips actually react. They take off at 430 degrees C., but their reaction continues beyond 1500 degrees C. (2732 degrees Fahrenheit) because molten iron is formed in the process. You can actually see, before and after, in the active chips that molten iron is being formed. I’m surprised at this actually because the chips are very, very small, but still the reaction is so violent that it can produce temperatures beyond 1,500 degrees Centigrade. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Red Primer Paint On Original WTC Steel Beams Furthermore, in the primer paint, which was used on the steel beams at the original World Trade Center – we looked up the original recipes for those paints. The paints contained as an anti-corrosive: chromium and zinc, which we do not find. And magnesium, which we do not see either. These are negative indications why the red-gray chips are not paint. THE THERMITIC MATERIAL PRODUCED THROUGH NANOTECHNOLOGY AS YOU HAVE DESCRIBED IN YOUR PAPER, IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CREATING EXPLOSIVE GAS? Could be. We don’t know yet. This is something remaining. We don’t know yet if the thermitic materials are explosives or working as heat production. They can do both and be both. All we say is we have found this material and those who put it there should tell us how they made it and why it was there and how it got there.

W. Nanoenergetics: an emerging technology area of national importance. Dept. of Defense Amptiac Q 2002; 6 (1): 43-48. AMPTIAC is Advanced Materials, Manufacturing and Testing Information Analysis Center in Rome, New York. WHY IS IT THAT LAWRENCE-LIVERMORE LABS WOULD BE PRODUCING NANOTECHNOLOGY THERMITIC MATERIAL? Because these are the explosives of the future. There is no doubt that the explosions of the future will be nanothermitic. And they are advertised as ‘smaller, cheaper and nastier.’ That’s the trend. When you are producing the explosives of the future, they will be smaller, cheaper and nastier. IN 2001, THE CONCEPT OF NANOTECHNOLOGY THERMITIC MATERIAL WAS NOT GENERALLY KNOWN IN THE WORLD, WAS IT? You’re perfectly correct. I would probably not know anything about this if I had not seen Building 7, the third skyscraper in the WTC (World Trade Center) going down. Why Did WTC Building 7 Collapse 7 Hours After WTC1 and WTC 2? RIGHT, EVERYBODY HAS BEEN PUZZLED ABOUT WHY DID BUILDING 7 GO DOWN WHEN IT WAS NOT HIT BY AN AIRLINER LIKE THE OTHER TWO WORLD TRADE TOWERS WERE HIT BY JETS AND JET FUEL AND THAT CAUSED THEIR COLLAPSE. COULD YOU START WITH THE ISSUE ABOUT WHY THE COLLAPSE OF"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"BUILDING 7 PROVOKED YOU AND THE OTHERS TO DO THIS CHEMISTRY RESEARCH WORK? I was flabbergasted! I saw it by accident. As a natural scientist, you usually understand what is going on around you and if you see something you don’t understand, you have a problem. You’ve probably seen the film yourself. The building 7 just goes down like this – totally symmetrical, sudden onset, free fall speed 6.5 seconds. And I said, ‘What! Let’s see that again!’ And I pushed the button ten times to see it and my jaw kept hanging further and further down. ‘What’s happening? What’s going on?’ And then I was hooked. Since that day there has been no way back for me. That was it! There are not very many – only a handful of companies – which can do this so brilliantly that the building fell down into its own footprint within a few feet. They took down a building 186 meters, 47 stories, almost 200 meters down into its own footprint in 6.5 seconds! Now, that is a masterpiece. There are probably only five companies in the world that can accomplish such a feat. HOW DO YOU THINK THE NANOTECHNOLOGY THERMITIC MATERIAL MIGHT HAVE BROUGHT DOWN BUILDING 7? It either melts or it blows the steel beams, the steel columns. You can use it for cutting steel or knock it over, depending upon the specific functionality of the thermite. IN BUILDING 7, THE THERMITIC MATERIAL IF IT WERE THERE, WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE BOTTOM IN THE BASEMENT? Building 7 was a more classical demolition where you cut it from the top and then very fast. There are different charges, there are different waves, different series of explosions. First you weaken the whole building, and then when it is just about to collapse, you blow it from the bottom up and doing this within fractions of seconds. It is important to remember that Building 7 fell in free fall speed. That means the 47 stories, when it began to fall, there is nothing below it. The 47 stories fall as if left in empty space 187 meters above ground. It falls with all support gone. When the top floor starts to fall, at that moment all supports have been cut. This has been done very accurately in time. THE CUTTING OF BLDG. 7 WOULD HAVE TO HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE SEVEN HOURS AFTER THE WTC TOWERS WENT DOWN? No way! It takes months of preparation. You have to do the planning. You have to look at the architectural drawings of the buildings. They made a 3-dimensional pattern in a computer program, not only to realize all the ways the building is built, but they can simulate the demolition many times so they can see exactly how the building will come down, adjusting the charges. That takes months! SO, WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT THE THERMITIC MATERIAL, IF IT WERE INVOLVED IN QUIET EXPLOSIONS PERHAPS IN ALL OF THE BUILDINGS, THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME KIND OF ELECTRONIC SIGNALS THAT SET OFF CHARGES ON SEPTEMBER 11 ... Oh, yes! AND THAT IN BUILDING 7, THERE WAS SOME DECISION TO WAIT FOR 6 OR 7 HOURS BEFORE THE ELECTRONIC SIGNAL TO SET OFF THE THERMITIC CHARGES? Oh, yes. Why Bldg. 7 – they waited 7 hours to do that is also speculation beyond my role being here. I’m a chemist. We have found the thermitic material and those who put it in should tell us how and when and why. Exactly how the charges were triggered, probably yes, by wireless transmission. That would be the most safe to do. It was done very accurately. Building 7 is a masterpiece in demolition. OK, BUT HOW WAS THIS DONE? IF THIS THERMITIC MATERIAL IS THE CULPRIT IN ALL THREE BUILDINGS COMING DOWN, HOW WAS IT APPLIED IN THE WORLD TRADE TOWERS AND HOW WAS IT APPLIED IN BUILDING 7? I don’t know. We are not saying that the red-gray chips are the only material doing this. All we’re saying is that thermitic material is found in the dust and those who brought that material into the buildings should tell us how it was brought in, how it was applied to the steel beams and how they made it. We think this deserves a good criminal investigation, which has never been performed yet. THE IMPLICATION IS AN INSIDE JOB IN THE UNITED STATES, RIGHT?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I have no idea. We’re talking about quite substantial quantities and in order to transport that, you would have to first need a truck. Then, I suppose, you roll it into the buildings on palettes and take it up by elevators and apply it to the beam columns in strategic places. It took months in preparation, calculations and planning. Months! WHAT WOULD SET OFF THE THERMITIC MATERIAL? Remote control probably. This was controlled remotely. It was a delicate operation. ALL OF THE MILLIMETER CHIPS WOULD BE CONTROLLED BY A RADIO FREQUENCY? No, the millimeter chips are remains from what was left from much larger charges. These are just the material that survived. SO, THIS IS NOT LIKE PEOPLE GOING AROUND WITH SOME KIND OF SPRAY GUN AND SPRAYING ON THIS THERMITIC NANOTECHNOLOGY MATERIAL? Oh, no. We don’t know! Those who did it should be forced to tell us about it. Again, we have found the remains, the leftovers, of active thermitic material. How much exactly has been applied? How it has been applied? Who got it into the buildings? Who put it there and how they put it there? That remains for somebody else to explain. But the event has never had a criminal investigation. And no proof has ever been presented to the public for the official government version. The FBI has not provided any charges. No one has been accused. Nobody is wanted for this! If you go to the FBI Most Wanted list, you will see that no one is wanted for the attack on the World Trade Center. I represent a group of scientists who have discovered thermitic material in the dust. And those who put it there should tell us how and why. BUT WHAT WOULD BE THEIR REASON FOR COMING FORTH TO THE WORLD AND EXPLAINING HOW AND WHAT THEY DID? THEY DON’T WANT ANYONE TO EVER KNOW, RIGHT? If there is still justice in America, there should be means to get around that. SO, THE IMPLICATION FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW IS THAT IF THE THERMITIC MATERIAL IS IN FACT A MAJOR CULPRIT IN BRINGING DOWN WORLD TRADE TOWER 1, WORLD TRADE TOWER 2 AND BUILDING 7 AT LEAST ... Yes, I believe that. ...THAT THIS WOULD HAVE TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE, THE PLANTING OF THE THERMITIC MATERIAL, WOULD HAVE TAKEN DAYS AND WEEKS BEFORE 9/11 TO PUT IN PLACE? Let’s say weeks, yes. IT COULD NOT ALL HAVE HAPPENED ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001? No way! IS THERE ANY OTHER EXPLANATION FOR WHY NANOTECHNOLOGY- PRODUCED THERMITIC MATERIAL MIGHT BE FOUND THROUGHOUT ALL THE DUST IN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER REGION? No. This is very sophisticated material created in very sophisticated labs by highly skilled people. Normal Thermite Hisses. Would Nanothermite Explode? A QUESTION I’M STILL NOT CLEAR ABOUT. THERE WERE FIREMEN WHO REPORTED HEARING EXPLOSIONS BELOW THEIR FEET. The classic thermitic reaction makes no noise. If you are using the thermite for melting steel, there is just hissing. It makes no loud noise. There are no bangs. So, whatever went off in the basements, I don’t know.

IS IT POSSIBLE THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN WORKED WITH A VERY SOPHISTICATED LAB TO PRODUCE THIS THERMITIC MATERIAL? This is beyond my competence. The scientific work we have presented here implies that the thermitic material is found in the dust. We think you (United States) should have a criminal investigation and those who put it there should be forced to tell us how it got there, why it got there, and when.” C ontinued in Part 2 - Physicist Steven E.
