Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Huge Unidentified Triangular Craft, Phoenix, AZ, March 13, 1997 © 1998 by Linda Moulton Howe November 28, 1998 Tucson, Arizona A massive triangular-shaped craft of unknown origin was described by several eyewitnesses over Phoenix, Arizona around 8:30 p.m. on March 13, 1997. those sightings were separate and different from other reports later around 10 to 10:30 p.m. of arcs of lights and orange spheres over Phoenix. Earlier at 8:30 p.m., at least two different groups of eyewitnesses estimated the length of a triangular craft in the sky to be nearly two miles. To date, neither military nor civilian sources have been able to explain what the huge, unidentified triangular craft was. Five of the eyewitnesses were in a car south of Phoenix at 8:30 p.m. Tracy Roads was driving from her Tucson with her daughter, Emily, to a state swimming championship accompanied by her mother and two friends. They were all astonished when an enormous triangle appeared in the sky with a light at each corner moving towards them from the Casa Grande mountains. First, Tracy Roads, and then her 10-year-old daughter, Emily. Interviews: 1) Tracy Roads, Mother, Tucson, Arizona: \"When it went over head, I leaned my head back and I started seeing the nose of the triangle coming up over the back window. It was a blackish, grayish, bluish metal. It was like the blue on a gun. I remember thinking that it looked like the Borg on Star Trek. It had like a pattern like a circuit board or something. It was like the Borg description I can give. It's like a solid metal, but you can tell there are different things, lines and ways that it's made up even though it's just a big, black object in the sky. From the moment we entered its shadow, we were underneath it for two minutes going 80 miles an hour in the opposite direction. If you have a stationary object at 80 miles an hour for two minutes, we could travel almost three miles of ground. So, I would estimate this object to be at least two miles from the very front of the triangle to the back, the straight edge back of the craft. WHEN YOU HAD PUT YOUR HEAD BACK IN THAT REAR WINDOW AND YOU WERE LOOKING UP RIGHT STRAIGHT INTO THE BOTTOM OF THIS OBJECT, COULD YOU SEE ANY STARS AT ANY EDGES? No. No. It was so big I could not see the edges of. Once it was over me, I could not look to either side through the back window and see any stars. IT WAS THAT BIG. It was that big. LIKE IT FILLED UP THE ENTIRE SKY. It blanketed the sky above me. I can't imagine something that big in the sky and I've seen it! And then it just floated.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"2) Emily Roads, 10-year-old, sitting behind driver's seat with her head out the window: \" I just thought I saw something that would go down in history. WHY DID YOU THINK THAT? Because it was a UFO and I had never seen one before in my life. It was so big and stuff. I just thought it was really special and it was go ing to go down... (she pauses) IN HISTORY. WELL, DID IT EVER CROSS YOUR MIND AS YOU WERE STARING AT IT AND YOU WERE HANGING OUT THE WINDOW OF THE CAR -- DID YOU THINK ABOUT WHAT WAS IN THAT TRIANGLE? Better than ours. MEANING? Smarter than us, having abilities far beyond us.\" Tracy Roads, Mother: \"Actually the first feeling I got was I was scared. I thought Independence Day. That was my first thought this big thing is coming at us and I had a feeling of turning around. My husband was back in Tucson and I thought, Should we turn around? And then I thought, Well, if this thing is headed to Tucson to do destruction, it's (destruction) probably (already) in Phoenix. We're all going to be affected, this will be it. And then I got excited. It was something I will never forget for the rest of my life.\" WHAT STACY AND EMILY ROADS DID NOT REALIZE WAS THAT OTHERS WERE SEEING A HUGE TRIANGLE AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME. REALTORS MAX AND SHALA SARACENS HAD JUST ARRIVED AT THEIR HILL TOP HOME IN PHOENIX AROUND 8:30 PM WHEN THEY ALSO SAW A HUGE TRIANGULAR CRAFT IN THE SKY. WAS IT THE SAME TRIANGLE THAT TRACY AND EMILY DESCRIBED? HAD IT FLOWN FIRST OVER THE SARACENS AND THEN SOUTH TOWARD TUCSON, CROSSING OVER THE CAR? OR WERE THERE TWO, HUGE TRIANGULAR CRAFT IN THE SKY OVER PHOENIX ON MARCH 13TH, 1997? WE MIGHT NEVER KNOW THE ANSWER, BUT ALL SEVEN EYEWITNESSES ESTIMATED AN EXTRAORDINARY LENGTH FOR ANY AERIAL VEHICLE -- TWO MILES LONG. 3) Max Saracens, Realtor, Phoenix, Arizona: \"In the northwestern sky was this huge formation of V-shaped lights, like a string of lights in the sky, flying lower than the airplanes flying above it. And we were standing directly in its flight path as it was heading from the northwest valley to the southeast valley, down towards Tempe. And the most striking thing about these lights as it got closer and flew over our heads was that it tended to block out the stars. So, what you could make out was a HUGE triangular structure -- some kind of structure of a definite triangular shape and it had kind of running lights on the side of it. And the lights did not kind of illuminate the rest of the structure. The lights were very coherent. There wasn't like a flare or glow around the lights. WHAT COLOR? They were kind of white and yellowy color. And it looked like this structure was very secretive. That was the impression I got from it first of all, because it was completely silent and from end to end -- the back of the ship -- it clearly was easily over a mile long, if not two miles. That was the most striking thing we saw. AND ABOUT HOW LOW? About a thousand feet. It wasn't very high at all."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND AS YOU STOOD THERE LOOKING AT SOMETHING THAT SEEMED TO BE BETWEEN A MILE AND TWO MILES IN LENGTH IN THE SKY AT ONLY A THOUSAND FEET AND COMPLETELY SILENT? Just awestruck. We didn't feel fear. There wasn't any fear. It was just an awe-inspiring, marvelous thing to see.\" 4) Shala Saracen, Realtor, Phoenix, Arizona: \"And here it was ever so slowly going over the top of us, ever so slowly! And I mean you could see the whole, not the whole structure because it was so massive -- and the reason I kind of know how wide it was and why I'm so specific on it is that we work for a custom builder. And we lay out master plans and things like that. And there was a new master plan being laid out there and I know how many blocks there are to whatever and it was 28 blocks wide because I went back and counted. TWENTY-EIGHT BLOCKS WOULD BE HOW FAR? About a mile and 7/8ths. PEOPLE HAVE SAID ABOUT TWO MILES LONG, PEOPLE WHO HAVE SEEN THIS TRIANGLE. OK, well, that's what it was. When it was over us, it was so humongous I couldn't tell in the back if it was boomerang or triangle because it just went so far back. Then as I said, it hovered over us for a few minutes. I'd say about 5 minutes. Not hovering, but going at such a slow speed that it felt as if it was hovering.\" Max Saracen: \"It was very other worldly -- that was my very first impression. Extremely other worldly. My wife has better eyesight than I do for long distance. Her eyesight is incredible, and she could see windows.\" Shala Saracen: \"See I was looking at the lights when the lights went out and he wasn't. He was trying to look like under the structure to see what -- if it was a V or was a triangle or whatever it was. So, I was watching as the lights went out. And they went out for only a few seconds, but when they went out -- whatever this was must have been illuminated from inside because you could see windows. I saw windows and I saw shapes. I saw shadows. WHAT SHAPE WERE THEY? Squares. They were square windows and that surprised me. I would have thought all one solid, not broken up. It was like panes. AND WHAT KIND OF SHADOWS WERE YOU SEEING IN THOSE SQUARE WINDOWS? Shadows. Gray shadows. You could see -- I told him four. I counted four. And the lights went on again and then that blinded me again so I couldn't see any more. FOUR SHADOWS. WHAT SHAPE? Well, like grey shapes like what I've seen on TV and that shocked me. YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU ACTUALLY SAW HUMANOID SHAPES BEHIND THESE SQUARES? Yes, definitely! And I told him four. WAS THERE ONE PER WINDOW, OR WERE THEY MOVING? No, it looked like the four were together. Standing together. That's what it looked like -- the four shapes were together. They weren't spread across. AND IT WAS LIKE THEY WERE STANDING AND LOOKING OUT"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE WINDOW? Yes, that's what it felt like, too. WHAT WAS YOUR RESPONSE ABOUT WHAT COULD THIS POSSIBLY BE? Well, I watch X-FILES, you know, because it's the most well written show on TV. So I had a good idea of what I thought it could be. WHICH IS? A UFO. An extraterrestrial ship. It's a ship that doesn't come from our planet.\" More Information: I would appreciate information from anyone in military, intelligence or civilian work who might have more information about these triangular craft estimated to be about two miles in length.
