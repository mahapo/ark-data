Volume I is entitled: The Devils and Evil Spirits of Babylonia: “Evil Spirits” ©1903 and published by Luzac and Co., London. eturn to Updated Part 1 August 14, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - To recap the timeline of communication with the Writers, their first floppy disc to me was dated June 21, 1994, contained three pages and is the subject of Part 1 in this Real X-Files series, now updated with an electronic scan of the original June 21, 1994, disc print out, which includes an important book list. When I began this series on June 17, 2009, I scanned the Writers' first letter from my published book Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness © 1998, which had been typeset for clarity. But recently, I compared my original and wrinkled 1994 disc print out with the retyped text in the book and discovered a paragraph was missing, apparently a typeset error. I have now replaced the first incorrect typeset scans used in Part 1 with electronic scans of the original floppy disc print out that includes the missing paragraph about the list of authors and books given by the Writers as context for their NHE discussion. A month later, on July 16, 1994, I sent my first series of questions to the Writers, reprinted in Part 2. On August 16, 1994, I received the second floppy disc from the Writers that contained five pages scanned and reprinted in Part 3. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"On November 3, 1994, I sent my second letter of questions and attached an alleged Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) TOP SECRET photograph of a non-human infant with suction cup fingers and enormous eyes containing vertical pupils reprinted in Part 4. Part 5 and Part 6 contain sections of draft pages from Glimpses, Vol. II, the book I worked on between 1994 and February 1997, when I sent those draft pages to the Writers for their comment. Back to November 1994, that was the month that Ray Boeche and the Writers had communicated about possibly organizing a face-to-face meeting with me and the Writers. In anticipation of a meeting, I had spent time at the Temple University library trying to track down the list of books the Writers gave me on Page 2 in their first June 21, 1994, letter: “Please refer to the works of the late Dr. Kurt Koch, works by C. Fred Dickason, Merr ill Unger, Tal Br ooke, and Dr. Neal Anderson [ sic - should be Neil] as good contemporary authorities, and for more historical background consult Reginald Thompson's The Devils and Evil Spirits of Babylonia ; Edward Langton's Essentials of Demonology ; Deacon & Walker's 1601 work, Diallogicall Discourses of Spirits and Devils, Declaring Their Proper Essence, and Emil Schneweis's Angels and Demons According to Lactantis.” [ sic - should be Lactantius, reprinted in 1982 from the original 1944 scholarly manuscript about studies in Christian antiquity concerning angels and demonology.] At the library, I learned that Dr. Kurt Koch was a German theologian who wrote thirty-seven books about demonology. One entitled Occult ABC, Exposing Occult Practices and Ideologies, was translated from the original German edition, Satan's Devices © 1978 and published under the new English title in 1980. C. Fred Dickason also wrote several books about demon possession, including Angels: Elect and Evil © 1995; Demon Possession and the Christian © 1989; and Names of Angels © 1997. Merrill Unger has written more than forty books a bout the Christian Bible, Dead Sea scrolls and others such as a recent 2007 release entitled What Demons Can Do to Saints. Tal Brooke (born Robert Taliaferro Brooke) is the chairperson of the Spiritual Counterfeits Project, a Christian counter-cult organization. He is the author of several books including the 1990 publication, Lord of the Air: Tales of a Modern Antichrist. Dr. Neil T. Anderson is a former aerospace engineer with Apollo and is now an associate professor of practical theology at Talbot School of Theology in La Mirada, California. Dr. Anderson is also President of Freedom In Christ Ministries. His three most popular books are Victory Over the Darkness © 1990; The Bondage Breaker © 1990/1993; and Released from Bondage © 1991. What interested me most were the historic titles and at Temple University, I was able to copy some of the 2-volume 1903 work by Reginald Campbell Thompson, M. A., Assistant in the Department of Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities at the British Museum in London. Volume I is entitled: The Devils and Evil Spirits of Babylonia: “Evil Spirits” ©1903 and published by Luzac and Co., London. Volume II is subtitled, “Fever Sickness and Headache, ETC.” Content in Real X-Files at Earthfiles.com is presented for consideration in a wide range of phenomena and interpretations, not as proven fact. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"B abylonian demons were sculpted as humanoid reptiles. In his Preface, Mr. Thompson writes about texts discovered from the reign of Assur- bani-apli (Akkadian), or Ashurbanipal, that are “tolerably accurate copies of the exorcisms and spells, which the Sumerian and his Babylonian successor employed, some six or seven thousand years ago, to avert the attacks of devils, and to ward off malign influences of every kind.”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"King of Assyria, Ashurbanipal, depicted in stone on a chariot during a royal lion hunt during his reign of 668 to 627 B. C. [ Editor's Note: AbsoluteAstronomy.com reports: “The Royal Library of Ashurbanipal, named after Ashurbanipal, the last great king of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, is a collection of thousands of clay tablets and fragments containing texts of all kinds from the 7th century BC. The materials were found in the archaeological site of Kouyunjik (then ancient Nineveh, capital of Assyria) in northern Mesopotamia. The site would be found in modern day Iraq. It is an archaeological discovery credited to Austen Henry Layard; most texts were taken to England and can now be found in the British Museum, London.” Wikipedia reports: “The Library of Ashurbanipal at Ninevah is perhaps the most compelling discovery in the Ancient Near East. There have been over 30,000 clay tablets uncovered in Ashurbanipal’s library, providing archaeologists with an amazing wealth of Mesopotamian literary, religious and administrative work. Among the findings was the Enuma Elish , also known as the Epic of Creation, which depicts a traditional Babylonian view of creation where the god Marduk slays Tiamat, the personification of salt water, and creates the world from her body. Then, man is created from the blood of a revolting god, Quingu, in order to toil on behalf of the gods.” ] Mr. Thompson asserted in his June 1, 1903 Preface that “a considerable proportion of the magical practices, which are in use in the East to the present day, were well known to the inhabitants of Mesopotamia several thousands of years ago, and that many of them were borrowed by the Hebrews and other dwellers in Syria and Persia from their neighbours on the Tigris and Euphrates (rivers). ... it has been confidently asserted that this document contains an allusion to the Biblical Garden of Eden. The text of this tablet mentions a"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"place called Eridu, and a plant or tree named kiskanu, or dense growth and shining appearance, which grew beside the abyss; i.e., the Ocean or Sea. The place where the plant grew was said to be the couch of a god. ... some Assyriologists have asserted that the Babylonian Garden of Eden was in the immediate vicinity of Eri du, and they have identified the tree or plant with the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, which was believed to grow in the Hebrew Paradise.” However, Mr. Thompson disagreed that the cuneiform describes a Garden of Eden near Eridu. He thought a newly discovered piece of missing cuneiform text showed the controversial text was only describing a particular plant for treating diseased patients, not the Tree of Life. Mr. Thompson begins his introduction to his 1903 2-volume book this way: “From the earliest times Eastern races, in common with the rest of mankind, have always held a firm belief in the existence of evil spirits, ghosts, and all kindred powers. ...the Semite recognized 'gods' (singular, ILU; plural, ILANI).” In a footnote, Mr. Thompson explained that the original meaning of ILU is unknown. The Sumerians indicated the word ‘god’ by a star symbol carved in their cuneiform tablets. Mr. Thompson: “...we are therefore justified in assuming that the Sumerians believed that their gods inhabited the sky. ... the Semite seems to have had some idea that the soul or EKIMMU, literally ‘the thing which is snatched away,’ possessed supernatural powers, or at least an existence.” In a section of his Introduction entitled, “The Various Classes of Evil Spirits,” Mr. Thompson wrote: “ The primitive Sumerian recognized three distinct classes of evil spirit, all ready to torment the hapless wanderer. First came the disembodied human soul, which could find no rest, and so wandered up and down the face of the earth. Secondly, the gruesome spirits, which were half human and half demon. And thirdly, the fiends and devils who were of the same nature as the gods, who rode on the noxious winds, or brought storms and pestilence.” ontinued in Part 8. eturn to Updated Part 1 or further reports about non-human entities, please see reports in the 1999 - 2009 Earthfiles Archive (partial list below) and my books An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities in the Earthfiles Shop. • 07/19/2009 — Part 2: 1980 RAF Bentwaters Lights and Craft Were “Extraterrestrial In Origin” • 07/17/2009 — Part 1: 1980 RAF Bentwaters Lights and Craft Were “Extraterrestrial In Origin” • 07/14/2009 — Part 5: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged Government Insiders • 07/06/2009 — Part 4: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): • 06/25/2009 — Part 3: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged Government Insiders • 06/21/2009 — Part 2: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged Government Insiders • 06/17/2009 — Part 1: Non-Human Entities (NHEs): One View from Alleged Government Insiders • 06/01/2009 — Part 10: High Strangeness Files about EBENs • 05/26/2009 — Part 9: High Strangeness Files about EBENs • 05/13/2009 — Part 8: High Strangeness Files about EBENs • 05/05/2009 — Part 7: High Strangeness Files about EBENs • 04/29/2009 — Part 6: High Strangeness Files about EBENs • 04/21/2009 — Archive Reprint: Apollo Astronaut Edgar Mitchell Says Governments Covering Up E.
