Espanola, the Jicarilla Apache Indian Reservation, Chama, Tierra Amarilla and Dulce are all areas where many unusual bloodless, trackless animal mutilations have also been reported since the 1960s. March 16, 2002 Farmington, New Mexico - Fifty-two years ago on St. Patrick's Day March 17, 1950, citizens in Farmington, New Mexico - then a community of 5,000 people - reported that hundreds of strange, round aerial craft flew over town, seeming to dogfight and play tag at extremely rapid speeds that included 90-degree turns. There were reportedly several waves of fly-overs, including both shiny silver discs and red-orange objects as well. The next day on March 18, 1950, the Farmington Daily Times topped its front page with a large headline that read: M icrofilm of March 18, 1950 Farmington Daily Times front page article reporting that hundreds of silver and reddish-orange discs had been seen flying repeatedly over the Farmington and Aztec, New Mexico, area on St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 1950. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"M icrofilm close-up on secondary headlines. The speed and altitude had been calculated by Harold F. Thatcher, Director of the Farmington U. S. Soil Conservation Service unit. The March 18, 1950 newspaper article said: \"Fully half of this town's population still is certain today that it saw sp ace ships or some strange aircraft - hundreds of them - zooming through the skies yesterday. Estimates of the number ranged from 'several' to more than 500. Whatever they were, they caused a major sensation in this community, which lies only 100 air miles northwest of the huge Los Alamos atomic installation.\" Clayton J. Boddy, Business Manager of the Farmington Daily Times and a former Army Engineers captain in Italy, was one of those who saw the unidentified aerial objects, along with Marlow Webb, Parts Manager at Perry Smoak Chevrolet, who had been a U. S. Navy pilot in WWII and was familiar with airplanes. Mr. Webb later owned Smoak Chevrolet and today, at age 78, remembers the strange discs that flew over Farmington on March 17, 1950. Interviews: Marlow Webb Marlow Webb, Owner, Perry Smoak Chevrolet, Farmington, New Mexico: \"I think it was late morning. To the northwest approximately at 70 to 80 degrees above the horizon, a group of shiny - I say shiny objects because I think they were visible only because the sun was reflecting off of them - and I would estimate anywhere from a dozen to a dozen and a half of them seemed to be in formation making erratic course changes. They were not going to the horizon and disappearing. They were basically - oh, I won't say stationary in the sky because they were moving in a good little space up there - but they didn't look like they were on one course going from here to there. When you say erratic course movements, could you explain that? Well, normal aircraft would make a curving course change where these seemed to be darting about at - I won't say 90-degree angles - but very sharp angles. Did they move together the way fish do in a school? Basically, yes. Yes. So, they all moved together no matter how erratic the movement? They didn't keep their same position in the formation, or at least I didn't notice that. But it would be sort of like a school of fish? Sort of like a school of fish, yes. How long did you watch them? Five minutes or less. And so they stayed up there for awhile?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Ye s . How many people were with you at the car dealership? Oh, three or four, maybe. And everybody was watching? Oh, yeah. There was no question that the people there could pick them out and see them. It wasn't as though I see something you don't. We all observed it. From your military backgro und as a pilot, could you compare what you w ere seeing to anything that you had seen before? No, I couldn't identify what it was. And I think I gave all the details to the military when they came to investigate it. When did the military come? Very shortly thereafter. Again, they asked basically the same questions you are: size, shape, distance, course, speed. It was impossible to judge. You would infer from those questions that they did not know what had flown over Farmington, either? No. I agree (they didn't). So, they were unidentified. And did they make any comments to you about their own concern about these unidentified flying objects? Not at all. These were interviewers. These were not decision-makers. In town, among the people who had seen this armada of silver craft going over, what kind of discussions were there back then? Strictly unidentified flying objects. I heard, or maybe read in the newspaper, that other people had seen other groups later that day.\" Another eyewitness also approached by a military interviewer was Clayton Boddy, Business Manager of the Farmington Daily Times. That morning on March 17, 1950, he was showing a couple of Colorado grocery store owners some real estate property downtown when they all watched unidentified aerial objects fly over for nearly twenty minutes. Clayton Boddy is now 85 years old, but still remembers what happened. Clayton J. Boddy Clayton J. Boddy, former Business Manager, Farmington Daily Times , Farmington, New Mexico: \"It looked like to me like they were silver-like discs going through the air end over end and they were following in a compact group. In a compact group. And how many do you think you were seeing? Well, they were extremely high, so I suspect - it's hard to tell - but I imagine there must have been a hundred or so. OK, and when you say they were going end over end, can you explain that more? If you were to hold a disc in your hand and just turn it clear over where the top comes to the bottom and the bottom goes to the top, in a circle like that. I thought it was something unusual that I hadn't seen before. I saw something I could not explain. You had a follow up call from Washington, D. C.? Ye s . Who was it from and what did they say? I don't know the gentleman's name. It seemed to me it was from the War Department and told me it was some government agency. He said there is nothing to this. We're running some experiments or something and would prefer if you didn't say anything. Did you think at the time that the fact that the War Department would bother to call you up to tell you that there was nothing to all those silver discs that you had seen, that that in itself might have been a cover-up by the government at the time?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Well, as I look back on it, it could have been. They probably all thought it was a sleepy little town out west and maybe we were hallucinating! I don't know. But it appears that if they went to that much trouble to call residents in Farmington, they must have been concerned about something. I think they were. And, of course, my position with the newspaper at that time was pretty high. And they were concerned about media attention of these silver discs. That's right.\" John Petty Eaton Another Farmington eyewitness that morning of March 17, 1950, was Johnny Eaton who was 29-years-old at the time and worked with his father in a real estate office on Main Street. The Farmington Daily Times published a time line about different reports all that day, including \"10:30 a.m. - red saucers seen over town.\" That must have been the episode that John and his father watched. Not only did they see red-orange discs, but another craft came into view that astonished them.

Photograph © 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe . John Petty Eaton, former insurance and real estate agent, Farmington, New Mexico: \"We were standing there talking and all of a sudden we looked up in the sky to the west and we saw these objects flying around. They were flying quite rapidly and they were just moving back and forth. I looked at them. I was in the Navy Air Corps and somebody there said, 'balloons.' And I said, 'No way! Those are not balloons.' They were moving too rapidly and in erratic areas, directions. Going different directions and they were all more or less together. What colors were you seeing and what shapes? The sky was clear and they were definitely a red color, kind of red and orange, reddish color. And they were so at a distance, they were very small. It was so hard to tell what shape they were. It was real difficult. They were kind of a flat shape. They were moving so fast and they was quite a way off, a long ways. You could definitely see a reddish-orange color on each one of them? Oh, yeah. Very plain. Did they move in any kind of formation? No, not that I could tell. They all moved sort of together when they moved back and forth across the sky. Sort of the way fish move in a school? More or less, yes, because they did stay together. Then we watched them for quite awhile. Then all of a sudden, we looked way beyond that same area there and we seen something coming across the sky from south to north and it was moving at quite a fast speed. It looked"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"sort of cigar shaped. Then all of a sudden, these five sort of all got together and went toward that and just flat disappeared. C igar-shaped grey craft that showed up while five orange-red discs moved together in the sky. The reddish discs seemed to disappear into the grey craft while Johnny Eaton and his father w atched from the sidewalk in front of their Main Street real estate office in Farmington on March 17, 1950. Drawing © 2002 by John Petty Eaton. So, what you were watching in the sky moving around seemed to go towards the cigar and disappear? Ye s . Did you have the impression that they entered the cigar? That was my impression, yes. That is exactly the impression that I had. They just entered the machine, or whatever it was. It was huge. Can you describe the color and size a little bit more and where it was? It was kind of a grey color. It wasn't a bright color. It was moving across and then they just kind of converged toward it and disappeared. When you saw them go toward the cigar and you thought they disappeared somewhere into it, what happened to the cigar? Well, it just, it was gone! It just moved out fast, just a zoom. Do you remember what you speculated about with the men watching and with your father about what all these things moving in the sky could be? Well, just, I don't know what to say about that because we were all really shocked. We looked and we thought, 'Holy cow!' It was such a, as my wife says, 'awesome!' And it was. We really talked about flying saucers and all that stuff. Coming from your Navy Air Corps experience in the previous four years, did it strike you that you were looking at something that you did not recognize as terrestrial? Definitely. That definitely was true. I just knew it wasn't anything that we had that would maneuver like that.\" More Information: For more information about the Aztec UFO events: See my book Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness © 1998 by Linda Moulton Howe, listed in Earthfiles Shop. Text of Farmington Daily Times , March 18, 1950 Huge Saucer Armada Article: \"Fully half of this town's population still is certain today that it saw space ships or some strange aircraft - hundreds of them - zooming through the skies yesterday. Estimates of the number ranged from \"several\" to more than 500. Whatever they were, they caused a major sensation in this community, which lies only 100 air miles northwest of the huge Los Alamos atomic installation. The objects appeared to play tag high in the air. At times they streaked away at almost unbelievable speeds. One witness who took a triangulation sighting on one of the objects estimated its speed at about 1,000 miles an hour, and estimated its size as approximately"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"twice that of a B-29. Farmington citizens stood in the streets yesterday watching the first reported mass \"flying saucer\" flight ever sighted. Traffic was slowed to avoid hitting sky gazers. The office of the Farmington Daily Times was deluged with calls from persons who saw the objects. Scores described the objects as silvery discs. A number agreed they saw one that was red in color - bigger and faster, and apparently the leader. Clayton J. Boddy, 32, business manager of the Farmington Times and former Army Engineers captain in Italy, was one of those who saw the startling objects. Boddy was on Broadway when \"all of a sudden I noticed a few moving objects high in the sky. Moments later there appeared what seemed to be about 500 of them.\" Boddy continued. He could not estimate their size or speed, but said they appeared to be about 15,000 feet high. Boddy's account was confirmed by Joseph C. and Francis C. Kalloff, retail grocers from Antonito, Colo., who were in Farmington to inspect the site of a proposed new store, and by Bob Foutz and John Burrell of Farmington. The Kelloffs said the objects appeared to be flying in formation. One of the most impressive accounts came from Harold F. Thatcher, head of the Farmington unit of the Soil Conservation service. Thatcher made a triangulation on one of a number of flying craft. He said if it had been a B-29, it would have been 20,000 feet high and traveling more than 1000 miles per hour. \"I'm not a professional engineer,\" Thatcher said, \"but I have engineers working under me and I know a little engineering, enough to know how to work out a rough triangulation on an object.\" Thatcher emphatically denied an earlier report that the objects could have been small pieces of cotton fuzz floating in the atmosphere. \"It was not cotton,\" he said. \"I saw several pieces of cotton fuzz floating around in the air at the time, but I was not sighting on any cotton.\" The \"cotton\" report was started by State Patrolman Andy Andrews who quoted several Farmington residents as asserting it was cotton they saw. The residents denied Andrews' report. The first reports of flying saucers were noted a few minutes before 11 AM yesterday. (Contradicted by 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. time line listed at end of article below) For a full hour thereafter, people deluged the Times office with reports of the objects. A second large-scale sighting occurred at 3 PM. At this time, Mrs. Wilson Jones, 27, and Mrs. Roy Hicks (can't read microfilm)... perfect formation. Others reported the same sight. Johnny Eaton, 29, a real estate and insurance salesman, and Edward Brooks, 24, an employee of the Perry Smoak garage, were the first to report the red-colored sky object. Not airplanes. Brooks, a B-29 tail gunner during the war, said he was positive the objects sighted were not airplanes. \"The very maneuvering of the things couldn't be that of modern aircraft,\" he said. John Bloomfield, another employee of Smoak's garage, said the objects he saw traveled at a speed that appeared to him to be about 10 times faster than that of jet planes. In addition, he said, the objects frequently made \"right-angle turns. They appeared to be coming at each other head on,\" he related. \"At the last second, one would veer at right angles upward, the other at right angles downward. One saucer would pass another ahead and then immediately the one to the rear would zoom into the lead.\" Marlow Webb, another garage employee, said the objects to the naked eye appeared to be about eight inches in diameter as seen from the ground. He described them as about the size of a dinner plate. (Marlow Webb told me in 2000 that these dimensions in the newspaper were exaggerated, that nothing he saw appeared that large.) \"They flew sideways, on edge and at every conceivable angle,\" he said. \"This is what made it easy to determine that they were saucer-shaped.\" None of the scores of reports told of any vapor trail or engine noise. Nor did anyone report any windows or other markings on the craft. In general, Farmington accepted the phenomenon calmly, although it was reported that some women employees of a laundry became somewhat panicky. Opinion was somewhat divided among those who saw the objects as to whether they were from another planet or were some new craft of our own nation's devising. Some expressed the opinion the entire incident was the fulfillment of a Bible prophecy. From sifting all reports, the Farmington Times compiled this timetable of sightings:"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"1) 10:15 a.m. five to nine 'saucers' zoomed over the town's business area for 10 minutes before moving out of sight to the northeast. 2) 10:00 a.m., report of 'hundreds' seen west of town. 3) 10:30 a.m., red 'saucers' seen over town. 4) 10:35 a.m., three objects staged 'dog fight' over town. 5) 11:15 a.m., clearest view of a large number of 'saucers.' 6) 11: ? , all disappeared. 7) 3:00 p.m., fleet of 'hundreds' seen flying in formation to the southwest from the northeast.\" To be continued in Part 2.
