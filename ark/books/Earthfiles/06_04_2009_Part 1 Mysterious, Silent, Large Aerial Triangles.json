I have selected a few for this Earthfiles follow-up, which highlight the global r each of the triangles spanning many years and the intuitive sense by eyewitnesses that the triangles are monitoring them - in one case, even trying to communicate by light patterns. See: 052809 Earthfiles, Parts 1 and 2 3 00-foot-long unidentified, silent, aerial craft first discovered only 100 or 200 feet above Challis, Idaho, camp trailer on September 27, 2000.

K., February 1997 Subject: TRIANGULAR CRAFT Date: May 30, 2009 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com The triangular picture of some type of craft you have, Well I'd like to point out that me and my partner seen one exactly the same, but was back in February of 1997. We used to live near Hereford (Leominster) and visited my girlfriend's parents for the weekend down in South Wales. When we left south wales to come home it was around 10:30 p.m. When we approached a place called the Brecon Beacons (Story Arms Hotel), I was driving along, trying to light a cigarette, but the flint on the lighter was not sparking. So instead of asking my girlfriend to try to light the cigarette, I pulled the car into a lay-by. As I leaned forwards to light my cigarette, a tiny light caught the corner of my eye and as I turned my head to see what this light was (the light was coming from the sky), I opened my car door and got out and looked up. I saw this triangular object roughly 300 feet in size with a light on each corner of the triangle and a light coming from the center of the craft. It never made any noise whatsoever. Also, it never moved at all. I shouted to my girlfriend to get out of the car and come and have a look at this. She jumped out of the car and looked up and also seen the same thing. But what is really strange is that I've been into the UFO phenomena for years. When I did get around to seeing something out of the ordinary, I just got back in my car and drove off without waiting to see what the craft did! There are 2 mountains either side of each other. I've attached a drawing of what it looked like, but I'm not very good at art, so please excuse the art work. I haven't told many people about this - only close family and some close friends. Thought I would share my experience with you after listening to you on Coast 2 Coast AM.

I listened to the amazing story that Mr. Bales told about his sighting and it brought me back to a night in December 2002, in West Virginia. I had something very similar happen on Dec. 08, 2002 and decided to write to you to fill in a few details that I experienced. I have been a software engineer for many years, I am well educated and I think people consider me down to earth. The larger triangle from Idaho may have been more of a mother ship, and the object I saw more of a smaller scout vessel, but even so it was very large and totally silent. I got the impression it was gathering information, maybe mapping the terrain by how slow it was flying. I have no idea why it was over a country town and civ ilian airspace. At first, I thought it was very likely that we, Mr. Bales and I, had seen the same triangle ship, but the one that I saw did not seem to be as large. I originally estimated the object to be about 60 to 100 feet long based on the landmarks I could see, houses, the road, etc., and was a couple of stories high. It was difficult to judge because it was a bove me and slightly to my 10:00 p. m. position, but it was much larger than my house. I also noticed by the glow of the streetlight that it had a very “domed” nose, not the sharp points that you see in some of the drawings. Triangle Flashing Lights to Communicate with Eyewitness? What was different about my sighting was that the object seemed to be trying to communicate with me for several minutes. Unfortunately, I was not carrying a flash light as I was planning to only be out of my house for a few minutes while the dogs went. Right from the moment I saw the object floating over the trees, it was flashing large round white strobe lights and it seemed to me that it was calling attention to itself, or trying to get my attention. I was out walking my dogs and it was a very dark night with no moon. There was nobody else outside until it flew over my neighbor’s house and it set off his truck’s car alarm. I have no doubt whatsoever that it knew I was there and was looking at it. It came flying very low and slow over the top of my trees, perhaps between 100 to 200 feet high. It stopped and hovered above me. It had lights on all the tips, the top and the bottom, and 4 large red diamonds in the rear. Each diamond had a structure"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"inside them that I can only compare to a honeycomb – but It looked “alien,” hard to explain. When it stopped above me, it turned off its large round strobe lights and turned on smaller white lights that played out a very specific sequential pattern. It seemed like it was letting me know it saw me and wanted to communicate that it was under inte lligent control. I r eceived this message clearly. The pattern was mathematical – it would flash two lights on top, then a light on the front, then the light on top again, then the light on the sides. It went through this pattern several times until it had used every combination of lights I could see and then played a kind of “grand finale” with all the lights flashing rapidly like some big lighting display. Dogs Did Not React, As the Mules Did Not React in Challis, Idaho I stood in awe and watched it in awe for at least 5 minutes, and at no time did my dogs react or move a muscle. My beagle was off of her leash in the large yard, which had leaves on the ground and she didn’t even wander one step. This was strange behavior for them. I realized later that I hardly moved a muscle either, just stood transfixed, jaw probably hanging open until I turned my back on it for 30 seconds. Then it was gone. But I watched it fly away. I got a real good look at it from the rear and that is how I knew it was a triangle/diamond with a raised rear section. These red diamonds seemed to indicate the engine in operation; it only used two of them to fly off – the ones on the right and left. The upper and lower diamonds remained turned off or not lit. I immediately called my family and my friends and really drove them crazy with this when it happened. I still think of it often. We are told not once, but several times, that these things do not exist. Then there it was, big as life and looking heavy hanging in mid-air. My eyes burned for about 24 hours afterwards, and later that night after the adrenalin and excitement wore off, I became scared. I know better than most people how small Mr. Bales must have felt. Before this I had never heard of a triangle-shaped UFO, but after years of research I have come to the same conclusion that I think you have. The U.S. Military, USAF and Lockheed Skunk Works don’t have anything like this. At the time, before the 2nd Iraq war began, I remembered thinking that if Saddam Hussein saw this thing with a USAF logo on it, he probably would have surrendered on the spot. That triangle was flat black, darker than the night and it had a kind of perfection to it. There were no insignia or designs anywhere and it looked powerful and “sleek,” like it could go like a bat-out-of-hell if it needed too, but it flew so slowly it looked surreal. If you read the MUFON report, you will read about it setting off my neighbor’s truck car alarm. This happened *right* when it flew past his house – I thought for sure some kind of electromagnetic field had set it off. I don’t talk about this much except with my immediate family, but I think about it almost every day. I know you are a serious researcher, so I wanted you to have this tiny piece of the puzzle. Here is a link to the 2002 report I filed at Mufon: http://mufoncms.com/cgi-bin /manage_sighting_reports.pl?mode=view_long_desc&id=10770& rnd=57791243740091 3) From: Hopson, Tennessee, August 1989 Subject: Triangle UFO Sighting - 5 Witnesses Date: May 29, 2009 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com I live in a small town in a resort area in the western part of North Carolina, about 1 mile from the Tennessee border. In August of 1989, myself, my Mom's sister and 4"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"friends were driving home from a nearby agricultural fair. About 15 minutes from home, as we were driving along (near Hopson, Tennessee, headed for home in Elk Park, NC), everyone laughing and talking about the evening, we rounded a curve and suddenly just ahead I saw an enormous black, triangle shaped “aircraft” floating silently about 100' - 200' above the highway. It was about 12:30 a.m. to 1:00 a.m. and we were the only car on the road with no homes nearby, or any street lights. The “craft” had 3 round glowing lights, one on each corner, as described in similar sightings. From our point of view, we were observing the craft from the underside, and it was slightly ahead of us above the road. The craft was “pointed” in the opposite direction of the way we were headed [ car was moving southeast and the triangle craft was moving northwest]. The object was flat black in color, and would have been virtually invisible had it not been for the lights, other than it was darker than the visible sky around it. The blackest black imaginable against the night sky, almost as if a triangle-shaped hole had been cut in the fabric of the space a bove your head. The corners were not sharp points, but rather rounded, and very “smooth.” The object appeared to be seamless as if poured into a mold. (One point I want to make here is that not until years of hearing/seeing other reports of similar UFOs that we realized that the only significant difference in the descriptions is that there was NO center light that we could see. Perhaps it was simply not illuminated, or this is a different type of craft?) I was the first person to spot the object. I was the driver of the car. I alerted everyone else to look up in the sky in front of the car, I said, “Oh, my lord, you guys...what on earth is that thing in the sky??” At that time, everyone looked and tried to get the craft in their line of sight. The people in the back seat rolled their windows down and leaned completely out of the vehicle. I was slowing down, and finally came to a complete stop. It is a very rural area, with fairly mountainous terrain on all sides of the winding road. There are no houses along this stretch of the highway. The closest town with any measurable population is Elizabethton, Tennessee. We had not passed any traffic at all, in either direction, for 10+ minutes prior to the sighting. There are no street lights in the area. After stopping the car in the middle of the highway, I realized that we were all staring into the sky, mouths open, and nobody spoke for 10-15 seconds. It was one of those surreal times that takes you by such surprise and utter disbelief, that rarely occurs in one's lifetime. Not before or since have I experienced this feeling. Somehow, time feels suspended, as if your brain has to catch up with the reality of what you are experiencing with your eyes. There is an indescribable “ominous” or “dark” heaviness that comes over you, as if it encompasses your whole body. Whether or not this is an effect of the craft itself, or simply a type of unknown natural fear I cannot say. We all had this feeling. I put the car in park, and everyone with me opened their doors and we all stepped outside the car. The size and shape of the craft were immediately obvious as something of unusual origin. Your mind searches its database trying to match the object with anything you have seen before. You then realize that you are observing a solid object the size of a football field, defying gravity, “floating” like a helium balloon in absolute silence. After you “come back” to conscious reality, it hits you...it hit all of us at the exact same time, we were looking at something none of us could explain. Still, in a silent trance we all looked at the object and then looked around at each other as if to confirm that this was happening, and we were all on the same page. I'm still not sure why, but all of a s udden, I r eached into the car, and tooted the horn, and yelled “HEY! We're down here!!” As if it were a startled animal, the craft “jerked” to life and began to tilt forward and glide swiftly and silently straight over our heads, following basically the direction from which we just came. I said, “Hurry everyone, get back inside!” When we were all back inside the car, I put the car into gear, and did a sharp U-turn in the middle of the road. We were able to follow the craft for about a mile before it disappeared over a m ountaintop, during which time, we were able to observe the glowing back edge for the first time. As we turned to continue home, you could have heard a pin drop in the car, as we all tried to unscramble what had just happened. I have told this story many times, ONLY because I had 4 other people with me at the time, who share the same details. If I had been alone, I think I may have been hesitant to tell anyone. I am convinced that we are not being told the “whole story” by the governments of the world. UFO's are as real as the ground under our feet. We saw a solid object defying all accepted laws of physics that night. People have a choice to believe or not believe. Not believing does not make UFOs less a reality. It only takes seeing ONE to change your beliefs forever."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I enjoy listening to you on C2C, I hope to see you in Nashville next month...I w ill try to say “Hello!” (Attached is a link to the Google map of the area where the sighting took place) R ed pointer marks location where emailer, his Mom's sister and three friends (5 eyewitnesses) “saw an enormous black, triangle-shaped ‘aircraft’ floating silently about 100' - 200' above our heads” in August 1989, as the car drove southeast toward Elk Park, North Carolina home and the triangle craft was headed northwest. 4) From: San Diego, California - Summer 2003 Subject: Triangle Sighting Date: May 29, 2009 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “ ... the triangle was revolving around its own center axis... ” I live in San Diego, Ca., in a residential area known as Oak Park. I work as a Library Assistant for the San Diego Public Library system, and one of my hobbies is doing back yard astronomy, both on my own and with a friend of mine from college. Mostly, I do binocular observing with two sets of binos. My lower resolution set are birding binoculars made by Swarovski, and my high-powered pair are Vixen 20 x 80's, for which I have a tripod. I do a fair amount of observing during the spring and summer months, so I know the night sky, and I have seen a lot of what I would call “anomalous lights.” My Triangle sighting occurred in either late June or early July of 2003. I was just going out into the back yard at around 9 p.m. with my blankets for the chaise lounge (I observe laying flat on my back) and my Swarovski birding binos. I was walking carefully as the yard was dark and I did not want to trip going up the steps to the middle part of my back yard. I put everything down on the chaise and looked up and to the North horizon across my neighbor's back yard, and I saw what appeared to be two large red lights off to the Northeast. At first, I thought it might be a Sheriff's helicopter because the lights were so close to the roof-tops of the houses and they were relatively stationary (my house is along the flight-path for the Astrea and police choppers), but as I watched the lights, I realized there was no noise - no chopper-blade sounds and no sound of a small plane engine. When I first saw the lights, they stayed to the Northeast of my position. There appeared to be two of them, and they just kind of hung st ill for about a minute. I was"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"saying to myself, “What the heck is that? It is awfully low, even for the Astrea chopper.” I kept listening for engine sounds and looking for the strobe-lights one sees on both helicopters and small planes, but I didn't see any. The lights were also a very vivid red - more cherry-red rather than the scarlet color of an airplane port-side wing light - and they were quite bright. Then the lights started moving in relationship to each other. From my positi on, they appeared to move horizontally apart for each other, stop, and then move along the same horizontal line back towards each other. Then it l ooked like they'd merge into one light, but then it would instantly divide into two, and the whole “move-apart, move-together” sequence would start all over again, like clockwork. At this point, I started to wonder if maybe I was looking at display lights on a blimp, b ecause of the weird color and motion of the lights, but again, there were no engine sounds at all, and no other lights - just the two cherry-red ones doing the apart-together-apart thing. After appearing to remain stationary (to the Northeast of my position) for about a minute and a half, the lights then began to move from East to West, but were still to the North of me. They were also very, very low, and appeared to be no more than 75 to 100 feet over the roof-lines of the houses. The lights were st ill doing the “ apart-together” motion, and I was still trying to make visual sense of what I was seeing. I was also worried that whatever it was might be about to crash, but I still heard no engine noises at all. As the lights got to a position due North of me, a third red light appeared, and I suddenly saw a darker silhouette-shape against the sky, which had some light-haze from street lights. As soon as I saw the darker shape, it was like my brain could figure out what my eyes were seeing - it was a dark craft shaped like an equilateral triangle with a red light at each apex. Because it was so low, I was seeing it almost edge-on, but as it passed by me, I could see some of the bottom surf ace. As it was flying forward (from East to West along a line that I then realized was only about a block to two blocks North of my house), the triangle was revolving around its own center axis, so the red lights at each apex would “eclipse” each other and they thus appeared to merge, although they were not actually doing so. As soon as I realized what I was looking at, I said, “Holy sh*t, it's a Triangle!” I got very excited, and (rather irrationally, as it was pitch-black), I started waving at it like a lunatic, and saying mentally, “I'm over here, guys, just off your port side!” Then, the very next instant, I felt a sudden, unexplained surge of fear, and I stopped waving. The weird thing about this was that although I could feel this kind of palpable fear, I also still felt my own excitement, and I still wanted to observe the thing as it flew. I literally couldn't take my eyes off it. As the triangle moved to the West, I began to lose sight of it due to some trees in my neighbor's yard that partially blocked my view. I hurried as fast as I could to the lower part of my yard, and I thought, “I'll get a really good view of it as it comes out from behind the grapefruit tree... and I can't believe that no one else but me is seeing this,” but it never came out from behind the tree. It just completely disappeared. I immediately came into the house, went through my garage, and out to the front of my house, where I have a very open view of the sky to the North and West, and I could not see it anywhere - no red lights, no nothing. It was totally gone. The whole sighting, start to finish, was maybe 2 and 1/2 to 3 minutes long. My best guess is that when I first saw the two lights, the Triangle was probably flying edge-on and straight towards my position, which is why the lights appeared to be stationary to the Northeast of me. When it started to revolve around its own center was when the lights appeared to be doing the “apart-together” thing. As it passed towards the West, I could see that it was flying extremely low, and it was absolutely silent the whole time. I guesstimate that the Triangle was as big as the footprint of the average house in my neighborhood, but the black-on-black observing conditions made it a bit difficult to tell exactly how far away (and hence how big) the Triangle was. My impression was it was very close and flying very low. Later that night, I had what I can only describe as a “spontaneous understanding” of the sudden fear I had felt earlier - I realized that I had experienced a form of “consciousness communication,” and that the fear I experienced was not me being afraid - it was the apprehension of the pilot and crew of the craft. They had flown in to oblige me (as I'm always asking for fly-bys when I'm out at night), but they were very worried about flying in near me, so they were sort of “broadcasting nervousness.” I can't really tell you how I know this to be true, but I do think this is what I experienced. I could readily understand that the Triangle crew would be jittery as not only am I in the law-enforcement helicopter flight-path, I am also in the Lindbergh Field"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"flight-path for incoming planes, and there are also Navy jets in the area (32nd Street Navy Base and on carriers in port) as well as Marine planes at MCAS Miramar. My late husband was stationed at Miramar (when it was NAS Miramar), so I know just how fast they can scramble planes when they want to. Plus, if disclosure witnesses are to be believed, some segments of our military are rather trigger-hap py, which I think would cause most sentient beings some anxiety at one point or another. Hope this sighting is of some use to you and others who are studying this stuff! Oh, and yes, I did totally forget during the sighting that I had a pair of binos with me! I was truly bummed when I remembered later that my binoculars were literally at my fingertips throughout most of my experience. C ontinued in Part 2.
