Sketch © 2005 by \"Howard.\" July 22, 2005 Orlando, Florida - In February 2005, I received e-mail and phone communication from a man who called himself \"Howard\" living in Orlando, Florida. He said his profession is computer network administration. Howard asked for anonymity and said he hoped his experience might help me in my investigation of the worldwide animal mutilation phenomenon which has persisted since at least the 1960s, and probably before. Then earlier this month, I was contacted by a source from the Mid-west with another account of light beam lifting technology and animal mutilation associated with a reptilian huanoid. See: 070405 Earthfiles. Ten years ago in the summer of 1995, Howard was with a male friend about to get into a car to go buy cigarettes not far from Disney World. He remembered the sky was not quite dark and figured the time was probably around 8 p.m. EDT. Just before getting into the car, Howard and his friend \"saw an unusual movement in the sky and we noticed a green glow ing craft.\" Howard told me the craft was disc-shaped, moved very quickly in three different motions toward them, and appeared to be a silver \"bare metal.\" Howard compared the green glow to the electrostatic discharge around a Tesla coil. Underneath the disc right at the center was a fire engine-red, glow ing ball. That glowing central sphere had motion in it. Howard told me, \"It's much like if you go to the SOHO website which has the filtered observations of the sun and you can clearly see sunspots. The marbling in the red sphere was much like sunspots on the sun. You'll have darker patterns that move in the red. The red, even though it was deep and shining, did not emit much light. So, if it was fifteen feet above the ground, there would be no red glow on the ground.\" Howard said the craft came to about fifteen or twenty feet away from them. The two men were so close that Howard said they could see \"black char marks\" on the hollow silver ring that surrounded the red sphere underneath the disc hovering a little above Florida pine tree height. Interview: \"Howard,\" Computer Network Administrator, Orlando, Florida: \" The disc stopped and hovered over this cow. We were in a rural area and next to my friend's house, they had horses and cows. There was a lot of pasture land there. So, it hovered over a particular cow. There was one cow isolated from the rest of the bunch that was near the fence near our car. The glowing disc hovered over the cow and then a beam of white light came down and enveloped the cow. \"Static-Filled\" Light Beam I'll describe how the light looked. All I can say is that it had static in the light. It looked like static on a TV screen where you have little specks of white and black, but there were not black and white specks in the light. It was just brighter spots in the light that made it look like that. But the static in the beam were long, so each line was probably about 3 inches long. The lines would move up, so it was like dust particles moving very quickly within the light, almost like laser light. If you take a laser light, you can see the dust particles in it. It looked much like that, like static or debris in the light, but moving. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"When the light came down, as soon as the light hit the cow, the cow immediately started to lift up. The cow lifted up first with its four legs and lifted into an upward position, making it look like it had stood up on its two back legs. The disc hovered in the air and probably lifted the cow up a good 3.5 to 4 feet off the ground. The cow was centered between the craft and the ground as far as the spacing. And it slowly raised up to the bottom of the craft and stopped probably about 6 feet away from the bottom of the craft. White, Glowing \"Tentacle\" Wraps Around Cow in Light Beam C ow raised in light beam where tentacle excised tissue before cow was dropped back to ground. Drawing © 2005 by Howard. A tentacle in this hollow space that was on the bottom of the saucer, there was a tentacle. I say tentacle because it was like a noodle or long string had come down from inside the hollow cavity inside the craft. The noodle or tentacle was glowing also. But it did not glow green; it did not glow red. It glowed white. Every part of its surface was glowing white. The tentacle was probably about 15 feet long fully extended and it came in a circular motion down and then unraveled. The tentacle unraveled straight out and then it proceeded to go under the cow from its bottom and then slowly wrap around, much like a snake. The tip of the tentacle was closer to the face of the cow. At this point, the tentacle like a python snake once it had gotten into position it tightened its grip on the cow. It was at this point that the cow began to scream violently in pain. This is when I heard electricity coming from the tip of this tentacle. The electricity was just much like an arc welder's machine. It put out a lot of electricity and it looked like it was cutting up the face of the cow. This was why the cow was screaming. Also, once the tentacle had latched on, it looked as if there were multiple ports on the tentacle maybe two or three on the tentacle itself. Not near the tip, but were independently spaced. Also, the tentacle was segmented and it looked like it would be some kind of robotic instrument. But I could not see metal. All I could see was this glow ing white light. At this point, it started to cut the cow and it started to move around. We also heard the sucking of liquid through a hose-type sound through the tentacle, as if you would take water and suck it up w ith a shop vac. The whole process of what it was doing to the cow lasted under a minute, from start to finish. The tentacle then detached (from the cow) and went back up inside the cavity of the UFO. The light beam had stopped and the cow dropped I would say dropped a good 6 feet to the ground. BUT ONLY 6 FEET? Yes. It would not be any higher than 6 feet. SO I'M CLEAR. THERE HAD BEEN THE BEAM OF WHITE LIGHT IN WHICH THE COW WAS RAISED UP ABOUT 6 FEET AND THE TENTACLE CAME DOWN OUT OF THE HOLE OF THE DONUT AND WRAPPED AROUND THE COW AND PROCEEDED TO DO THE CUTS. That's right. DID THAT AND THE BEAM OF LIGHT STOP AT THE SAME TIME? DID THEY BLINK OUT? WHAT HAPPENED? No, when the tentacle was done doing what it was doing, it retracted and went back up in the same position as it came down. That process took about 5 or 6 seconds. Then, the light beam shut off and it went out just like a light, just instantly. Then the cow fell. So, my assumption is that the beam is used to lift up things and the tentacle is used to cut them up. YOU ARE INSIDE YOUR CAR, CORRECT? No, we were still outside the car. We had never gotten inside the car. We had opened up the doors to get inside the car, but seeing what we saw, we got back out. YOU'RE STANDING APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET FROM THIS EVENT DURING THE ENTIRE PERIOD OF THE BEAM, THE COW RISING."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" Cow Screams and Is Cut By \"Tentacle\" We did approach the craft, which is what I'm getting to. When the cow started to scream, it seems like out of instinct we were going to walk over to the cow and perhaps grab its legs and pull it down. We didn't even think about what we were doing. So, there was one point where we got up to the craft, I'd say about ten feet from the cow (in the beam). WERE YOU TEN FEET FROM THE COW DURING THE CUTTING OPERATION? No, we were still about 15 or 20 feet away from the cow at that point. When it started to cut and we heard the cow scream, it took us a few seconds to realize what was going on and what we should do about it. Probably half way through the process, or 30 seconds or so, we decided we would walk up to the cow and try to do something to stop what we were seeing. WHEN YOU WALKED UP, WAS THERE ANY CHANGE IN THE LIGHT BEAM'S COLOR, INTENSITY, IN THE BEAM OR GLOWING, CUTTING OBJECT? No, there was no change. There was a change in the glowing intensity of the green glow that surrounded the craft and it would fluctuate the whole time. It was not because we walked up to it. It would fluctuate like I don't know how to describe it. Parts would be brighter than others and the brightness would move. IN THE LAST 30 SECONDS OR SO OF THE GLOWING TENTACLE DOING THE CUTTING OF THE COW, YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUE HAVE WALKED TO ABOUT TEN FEET FROM THE BEAM. That's correct. SO YOU ARE RIGHT THERE WHEN THE COW DROPS TO THE GROUND? Yes. Just take a cow, hang it up a few feet in the air, let it go, and it hits with a loud thud. That's pretty much it. BUT YOU MUST HAVE WALKED UP TO THE COW. We did. WHAT DID YOU SEE IN TERMS OF WHAT HAD BEEN CUT AND WHAT DID IT LOOK LIKE? I didn't get a really good look at it. I just wanted to verify that it was there and dead. Two Hours of Missing Time I' M PUZZLED HERE. THIS HAS HAPPENED. THIS IS TREME NDOUSLY DRAMATIC. YOU WANTED TO HELP THE COW. SO, THE NATURAL THING WOULD BE TO WALK AROUND THE COW TO SEE WHAT HAPPENED. Which we did, but all we could see was the face. At this point, it was much darker outside. There were two hours that went by from the point that we saw the cow hit the ground to the point that we had walked up and been able to check the cow out. TWO HOURS? I THOUGHT THIS WAS ALL TAKING PLACE WITHIN A MINUTE? Yes, but we did not get to see until later. ARE YOU SAYING THAT YOU WERE ABDUCTED BY THIS CRAFT THAT HAD JUST MUTILATED THE COW IMMEDIATELY UPON THE DROPPING OF THE ANIMAL.? ARE YOU THEN ABDUCTED FOR TWO HOURS? I'm not saying that. I'm just saying I had tw o hours of missing time. IMMEDIATELY UPON THE COW DROPPING TO THE GROUND? That's right. DO YOU HAVE CONSCIOUS MEMORY OF SEEING THE LIGHT GO OUT AND SEEING THE COW DROP? Yes. DO YOU HAVE MEMORY THEN OF EITHER MOVING TO THE COW OR ANY MEMORY FROM THAT POINT CONSCIOUSLY WHEN THE COW HITS THE GROUND? Yes, I do. WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE COW DROPPED? WHERE DOES THE MISSING TIME START AND STOP? BUT BEFORE THE MISSING TIME STARTS, WHAT HAPPENED? DO YOU REMEMBER INSTANTANEOUSLY WALKING UP TO THE COW AND LOOKING AT THE FACE AND BODY? That was 2 hours later, yes I do. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Light Beam Surrounds Howard and Friend BUT YOU DID NOT WALK UP TO THE COW IMMEDIATELY UPON ITS DROPPING TO THE GROUND? No, we were walking up to the cow as it was still in the air. We were already 10 feet away when the cow had dropped. Then as the cow dropped, we proceeded to step back and we probably stepped back about 15 feet. At which point, the beam had shut off and the UFO centered itself over us. AND? We also got a beam of light on us. WHITE? Yes, same beam. ARE BOTH OF YOU IN THE BEAM AT THE SAME TIME? That's correct. ARE YOU SEEING THE SAME DUSTY SPARKLES? Yes. BUT NOW THOSE DUSTY SPARKLES ARE SURROUNDING YOU? That's correct. ARE YOU LEFT TOTALLY CONSCIOUS WITH ALL YOUR FACULTIES PROCESSING AS YOU ARE LIFTED IN THE BEAM? Yes. When the beam of light was on us, after the cow had dropped and we proceeded to step back from it, the beam moved over our heads. When the beam moved over our heads, we ran for the car. The car at that point was only a few feet away from us. The doors were st ill open. So I, myself, I had put one hand on the door and I had my right hand on the top of the car on the driver's side. I was driving and was about to get in. It was at that point that the light had captured us and raised us up like the cow was raised up. BUT NOT THE CAR? Not the car. SO THE BEAM HAS THE TWO OF YOU. WHAT DID YOU FEEL? TEMPERATURE? VIBRATION? No variance in temperature. I felt a weightlessness and I did lift off the ground, myself and my friend. As soon as the beam hit us, we were paralyzed. My arms and head were still locked in the same position. We were looking across the hood of the car, the roof of the car, at each other when we were being lifted up. So, I can tell we were being lifted up by what I saw around me and by my friend. We felt an uncomfortable feeling. I don't have anything else to compare it to. It would be like maybe pinpricks or needles underneath your skin, but not on top of the skin. It was underneath the skin. And we felt the weightlessness. But it was not spaced evenly. My legs were more weightless than my head, if that makes any sense. I could feel it differently. I felt like my top half weighed more than my lower half. And I felt this uncomfortable tingling sensation under my skin. It was not pleasant. HOW CONSCIOUS WERE YOU IN THE BEAM? When we got up about half way through the bottom of the craft, we had blacked out.\" C ontinued in Part 2. Cow Used for Reptile Food.
