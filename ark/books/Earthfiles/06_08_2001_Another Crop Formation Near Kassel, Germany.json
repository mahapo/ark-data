More Information: The Kassel, Germany area has been a repeated focus of the crop formation phenomenon each May since 1998. In addition to this June 1 formation, on Sunday, May 13 at 7:30 a.m. a farmer found a complicated pattern in yellow flowering oilseed rape not far from Kassel, Germany in the farming community of Zierenberg. (See: May 19, 2001 Earthfiles news report.) The farmer told researcher and photographer Frank Laumen that he \"was surprised to have found no signs of a human footprint on the soil and the plants were pretty wet in the morning. It would have been impossible not to cause suspicious footprints, but there were none.\" For my book Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles, (Earthfiles Shop ) I asked Michael Hesemann, publisher of Magazine 2000 in Duesseldorf, Germany, author of The Cosmic Connection, and long time student of ancient histories and religions why Kassel would play a pivotal geographic role in Germany, as Avebury and Silbury Hill have in England. He responded with the following letter: Michael Hesemann Letter to Earthfiles: \"In my opinion, it is no coincidence at all that Kassel became the German center for crop circle activities. It is indeed, next to Karlsruhe and Schleswig-Holstein (which are the other areas with frequent circles in our country), the land which comes closest to the sacred landscape design of the sanctuaries of Avebury and Stonehenge. \"Kassel is also the birthplace of Rosicrucianism in the 17th Century and the center of Masonic activities in the 18th Century. In 1614, the Kassel printer Wilhelm Wessel published two books which became the 'Bibles' of Rosicrucianism: the anonymous General Reformation"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"of the Whole World and the famous Fama Fraternitatis or the Discovery of the Commendable Order of the Rose Cross. It was written by Johann Valentin Andreae, son of a Lutheran priest with the reputation of being an alchemist, born and living near Tuebingen in Wuerttemberg. \"One year later, Andreae published his second book Confessio Fraternitatis or Confessuin of the Commendable Brotherhood of the Venerable Rose Cross , Addressed to the Intellectuals of Europe, again in Kassel. The fact that Andreae spent all his life in Wuerttemberg, but published his books in Kassel/Hessen indicates that there was indeed a secret society already active at that time which coordinated the publication. With a very high probability, Andreae's friend, Rudolf August von Braunschweig-Wolfenbuettel, was another member of this Rosicrucian order. Its center of activities at that time was obviously already the city of Kassel. \"Mentioned for the first time in 913, Kassel obtained its town-rights by the end of the 12th Century when it became seat of a German chapter of the Knight Templars. Since 1277, it is the residence of the Counts of Hessen. At that time until 1848, Germany consisted of over a hundred independent states or counties ruled by Counts, Barons, Princes and Kings, united within the Holy Roman Empire of the German nation. In 1527, Hessen introduced the Lutheran Reformation as one of the first German states. The Counts of Hessen were proud of their French ancestry, sharing with the Kings of France a remote descent from Pippin, the Short, the father of Charlemagne. \"In 1717, the very year in which Freemasonry went public for the first time with the foundation of the Great Lodge of England in London, the Count of Hessen-Kassel, one of the first German Freemasons, completely changed the design of his residential city, Kassel. With the help of Italian architects, he designed it as 'the city of man,' a model of the human energy body with its seven chakras. For this, he erected a network of fountains and monuments along a straight line, the city's new axis, ending on top of a mountain. There, he erected an octagonal structure corresponding with the eight- petaled lotus of the Buddhist model of the Kundalini, crowned by a structure which is half obelisk and half pyramid, with a bronze statue of Hercules on top: the God-Man of the Greek/Roman mythology leaning on his club. Hercules stands for the perfect man. Seen from below, the whole structure resembles a Tibetan stupa. At his feet in the octagon, Count Hessen-Kassel placed the defeated Giant Encelados, symbol for the ungodly 'old man.' \"Interestingly, Carl of Hessen-Kassel, who ruled from 1767 on, became one of the closest friends and disciples of the mysterious alchemist, Comte du Saint Germain. Although Hessen preferred to reside in Gottorf near Schleswig, the capital of his land was Kassel. He hosted Saint Germain in the nearby castle of Louisenlund, where he allegedly died in 1784. In 1774, Carl of Hessen-Kassel was received as a Freemason in the lodge at Schleswig. In 1782, he organized the first national conference of Freemasons in Wilhelmsbad near Kassel. \"In conclusion, I can say that Kassel was Germany's most important center for Rosicrucianism with a ruling family deeply involved in alchemy, freemasonry and sacred landscape design. There is a direct connection between these ancient crafts and occult sciences and ancient Egypt as there is one between the stone temple of Avebury with its Silbury Hill pyramid and the land of the Pharaohs. Therefore, it does not seem to be a coincidence that right here in Kassel the circle makers focused their enigmatic activity.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"We b s it e s : http://www.franklaumen.de/ http://invisiblecircle.de/ http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/ http://www.cropcircleresearch.com/ http://www.dcca.nl/ http://www.swirlednews.com/ Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
