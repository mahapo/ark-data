Stringfield. 5 - THE NEWSWIRES SHOW THEIR HAND - AND SCISSORS! Even more inexplicable than the newspapers' method of handling saucers was that of the news services. When Frank Edwards first alerted his listeners in the latter part of 1953 that saucer reports were being smothered at their source, speculation for its cause was quick to follow. Rumor was that something big had happened behind scenes in the military. One story making the rounds claimed that the Air Force was hiding three saucers and their crews in hangars at Edwards AFB, Muroc, California. While I could not substantiate this claim or its connection with the newswire action, I was made aware through official correspondence of a sudden and important change in the Air Force's policy of "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"disseminating UFO information. A letter from Major Robert C. Brown of the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC), Wright-Patterson AFB, dated August 21, 1953, said: \"The Air Technical Intelligence Center has received your letter dated 5 August 1953, requesting an interview with Project Blue Book personnel. These personnel are quite busy at the present and request you obtain your information from the Department of Defense, Office of Public Information, Washington 25, D. C. If, however, they cannot supply you with the information that you desire, there is a possibility that an interview can be arranged.\" Then on December 2, 1953, Captain R. C. White of OPI, Department of Defense, Washington, answered a list of 82 questions I had submitted to his office, concerning official views on the UFO. In his postscript to the 82 answers Captain White said, \"I'm sorry to have to refer you again to ATIC on detailed sightings because of their workload. However, if you w ill limit your questions to one or two sightings at a time, they may be able to help you. If not, send them to me, one or two at a time, and I'll try to run them down.\" Then came the switch! On December 17, 1953, Chief Warrant Officer, R. C. Schum of ATIC, answered my follow-up letter concerning my original proposal for an interview as follows: \"In reference to your letter of 8 December 1953, the Air Technical Intelligence Center has been directed to make all information on Project Blue Book available to the Department of Defense, Office of Public Information, Washington, D. C., for release from that point only. Complete information is furnished the Office of Public Information on a day-to-day basis as well as by summary reports. Therefore, an interview with that office might be of benefit to you. In regard to your specific questions, the Air Technical Intelligence Center will request a copy from the Office of Public Information and attempt to answer them more fully. These will then be returned to you through the Office of Public Information.\" One of the first reports to steer my suspicions, involving both the military and the newswires, slipped by the \"censors\" on June 30, 1954, from Mobile, Alabama. I first heard of it from Frank Edwards who phoned me from Washington prior to his broadcast. He read the high points from his script - \"Brookley AFB officials report radar had tracked a UFO ... It made no sound, was silvery in color, traveling at terrific speed. ...It was definitely being maneuvered by intelligent beings.\" [ Editor's Note: Originally named Brookley Field, the airport was previously a U.S. Army Air Force supply base, employing around 17,000 civ ilians. In the late 1960s, the airport was turned over to the City of Mobile, Alabama, and re-named Mobile Downtown Airport, which is now operated by the Mobile Airport Authority.] I remember Frank stressing one phrase, intelligent beings. I thought the report was unusual, so I followed it up. It was a United Press item, so I checked with the City Desk at the Cincinnati Post. \"No such story on our wires,\" said the man on the desk. When I asked if he would put a tracer on it, he promised he would and told me to call back the next morning. When I checked, I was told that the story was denied in Mobile. Later, I learned of JANAP 146 (Joint Army-Navy-Air publication) reprinted in Marine Major Donald Keyhoe's 1955 book, The Flying Saucer Conspiracy."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"R eprinted in Appendix 1, on pages 301-303, The Flying Saucer Conspiracy © 1955 by Major Donald E. Keyhoe, U. S. Marine Corps, Retired. Then I felt even more certain that controls in some mysterious manner had been leveled on the news media. Another example of suspected finagling behind the scenes involved a local incident in which a sensational UFO stirred thousands of Cincinnatians on August 5, 1955."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"A Times Star headline said, \"Aerial Whazit Intrigues City,\" but that was the extent of the United States population that the story intrigued - it never made the newswires! For the account and my editorial comment, I quote from the September 2, 1955, issue of Orbit : \"At 8:40 p.m., a large brilliant tear-drop-shaped object, flying south to north, crossed the city's skies. It moved swiftly and soundlessly in a straight horizontal path without visual arc. Witnessed by thousands, including this writer whose view was excellent, the object appeared as large as a dime held at arm's length. \"A notable feature was the sharply etched roundness of the device, which gleamed in a uniform brilliant white luminescence. Tapering abruptly behind this white mass was a short fiery tail of bluish-green - much like the tonguing flame of a rocket. Its speed, although constant, was too fast for any known aircraft, yet too slow for a normal meteor. \"During the next few days I interviewed over fifty other witnesses. Most all confirmed the description which I had phoned to the Columbus Air Filter Center and the newspapers. Some described the object as 'cone-shaped,' like a 'pear' or, as my daughter, Colette, told me, 'a light bulb with a little blue tail.' Reports poured in from every section of the city, mostly in the eastern half or from high ground in the west. One report from Cold Springs, Kentucky, claimed that the object was exceedingly low and appeared to have 'windows.' From Columbus came reports that residents there also saw a ball of fire streaking over the city. It was described as a bright yellow colored light with a red and green fringe or halation. The object"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"silently disappeared in a cloud bank about 5,000 feet high. Over Lancaster, about 30 miles southeast of Columbus, a similar object was reported by many residents. C. M. Smith of that city writes: '...my fa mily and I were sitting out on our terrace when we saw a giant fireball traveling very rapidly from south to north. It appeared as a pear-shaped object glowing white with a red and orange fiery tail.' \"Several reports from northwestern Cincinnati described the object as suddenly and silently exploding just north of the city. One witness said he thought he saw it hit the earth and burst into vertical streamers like a bomb. Curiously, the object was not seen in adjacent areas northeast of the city, which gives rise to the theory that two objects were seen over Cincinnati almost at the same time. Lending weight to this theory is the fact that the majority of witnesses represented two extreme ends of the city and from two extreme ends of Kentucky from which the objects were seen to originate. By this deduction, we can, therefore, account for the one object exploding in northwestern Cincinnati. The other, perhaps, changed course and flew ENE toward Lancaster where the description of the object tallies with the object witnessed by myself. If the later case were not true, as we have earlier suggested on the assumption that no one reported a UFO in the outlying areas of northeastern Cincinnati, then we may believe that three and possibly four separate objects had traversed the skies over Ohio.\" Whatever the explanation for the newswires being silent on the Mobile, Alabama, and Cincinnati, Ohio, incidents, the man-on-the-street was not getting the best facts available. For instance, during the deluge of sightings reported almost daily in the greater Cincinnati area in 1954, most all were considered un-newsworthy. \"The public is tired of saucers,\" opined a Cincinnati Enquirer columnist. However, his paper gave respectful emphasis to an Air Force statement carried by the wire services on June 1, 1954, which said that saucer reports had fallen off sharply since 1952. The Air Force statement went on to say that from January 1 to June 1, 1954, only eighty-seven sightings had been reported. Captain White of OPI confessed that saucer mail was just trickling in - about five a day, he said, and yawned, 'Ho hum!' Hardly in a yawning mood, I could not believe White's statistics. Was it possible that CRIFO's mail was five times as great as the Air Force's? Certainly \"87 reports since January 1954\" was debatable. I alone had received over a hundred reports since January and Frank Edwards told me on the phone that he received almost that many a month. Curious, I phoned Lt. Colonel O'Mara, Deputy Commander of Intelligence, Wright-Patterson AFB. During this \"interview\" of July 8, 1954, I was told the Air Force was receiving about \"700 sighting reports\" a week. The figure 700 probably covered all reports reaching ATIC for evaluation, including civ ilian reports. A great percentage of this number undoubtedly had conventional explanations as had many of the reports I received during that same period. I asked Lt. Col. O'Mara about the \"87\" number. Colonel O'Mara said that number represented the cases under \"special analysis.\" Inasmuch as Colonel O'Mara had scuttled the Air Force statement, his new figures on \"sighting\" frequency meant little to Cincinnati newspapers. Only the Times Star gave it coverage. The newswires would not touch it! However,"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"when I phoned the news to Frank Edwards at Mutual in Washington, D. C., the airwaves that night carried the information coast to coast - and deep inside the Pentagon.\" Continued in Part 4 - Manipulated Media More Information: For further information about Leonard Stringfield's UFO Status Reports, please see reprints below from the Earthfiles Archives: Status Reports I • 10/25/2005 -- Final Part 6: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 10/13/2005 -- Part 5: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 10/05/2005 -- Part 4: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 09/30/2005 -- Part 3: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody • 09/26/2005 -- Part 2: Retrievals of the Third Kind - Kingman, Arizona Crash • 09/25/2005 -- Part 1: Retrievals of the Third Kind - A Case Study of Alleged UFOs and Occupants in Military Custody Status Reports II • 09/19/2005 -- Final Part 9: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 09/17/2005 -- Part 8: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 09/14/2005 -- Part 7: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 09/06/2005 -- Part 6: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 08/22/2005 -- Part 5: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 08/17/2005 -- Part 4: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 07/20/2005 -- Part 3: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 07/14/2005 -- Part 2: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data • 07/12/2005 -- Part 1: The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome: Status Report II - New Sources, New Data Status Reports III • 07/05/2005 -- Final Part 15: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 06/20/2005 -- Part 14: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 06/17/2005 -- Part 13: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 05/10/2005 -- Part 12: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 05/04/2005 -- Part 11: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence • 04/19/2005 -- Part 10: UFO Crash/Retrievals: Status Report III - Amassing The Evidence © June 1982 by Leonard H.
