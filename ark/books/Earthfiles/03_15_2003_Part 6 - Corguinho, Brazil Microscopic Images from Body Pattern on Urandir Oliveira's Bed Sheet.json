Body pattern was discovered on September 15, 2002. Photograph © 2003 by Linda Moulton Howe. March 15, 2003 Grass Lake, Michigan - Biophysicist W. C. Levengood has been examining both normal control and body pattern samples I collected from the cotton and polyester woven bed sheet in Urandir Oliveira's home in February. The body pattern was discovered by several people at Oliveira's farm around 8 p.m. on September 15, 2002. (See previous Earthfiles reports about Corguinho, Brazil.) This week I received photomicrographs from Levengood taken at 40X magnification under his microscope and today we discussed the images shown below with his comments. Interview: W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, Grass Lake, Michigan: Photomicrographs were all taken at 40X magnification: Photomicrograph 1 \"This shows a control sample from one of the bed sheet corners where no alterations were observed. This is a simple checkerboard weave of white polyester fibers interwoven with cotton, blue cotton fiber, which gives the very light blue color to the sheet. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"So, the cotton has been dyed blue and the poyester does not have any dye in it. That's right. Photomicrograph 2 \" This is a photomicrograph of a sample of the body pattern on the Urandir Oliveira bed that was not scorched, but almost looks wet when you are looking at the bed sheet. But in fact that wet look has been caused by a change in the polyester? It sure has. These I call a transition, or the polyester is converted into what I call vitreous fibers. It looks wet, but this is actually sort of an opalescent liquid- looking, but it's like a plastic. It's very hard. Could Oliveira have used a candle, a match, a laser, a blow torch, something like that to heat this pattern on that sheet? No, absolutely not. The astounding thing about this Photomicrograph 2 is that the polyester fibers are completely transformed from looking like a bundle of fibers, which they were. Each thread we are talking about here is roughly a little over .4 millimeters in diameter. The fibers themselves are down in the micron region, 1/1000th of that size - only three to four microns. Each thread is composed of probably several hundred fibers. The same is true with the cotton and they are roughly the same diameter fibers. The cotton, of course, has a distinctly different look. We know that polyester is listed in The Condensed Chemical Dictionary as having a melting temperature of 500 degrees F. and that cotton has a scorch temperature of 300 degrees F. That is a difference of 200 degrees F. In this photograph, it looks as if the polyester threads have melted and the blue cotton threads seem completely untouched. That's right. There is that difference of 200 degrees F., but the cotton threads are totally undisturbed. Photomicrograph 3"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The red arrow points to polyester fibers inside a vitreous thread. You can see some faint horizontal lines inside the vitreous polyester, which means that not all the polyester fibers were transformed into the vitreous state. So, it's a transition region. This suggests that a change has occurred in the molecular structure of the 3 to 4 micron diameter polyester fibers, but did not affect all of the fibers at once and not in the same way. The fibers are transformed from one state to another. But you don't know how this occurred? Of course not, no. You can't transform the molecules in a polyester fiber by heating it with a match, is what I'm saying. (Whatever the energy is), it has to fingerprint the actual molecular structure of the material itself. If it were a match or laser, the heat would spill over where you have these cotton fibers right in proximity. The cotton threads are lying right on the vitreous polyester fibers, over and under. But there is no apparent heat transfer here between the polyester fibers and the cotton fibers. The fibers are transformed from one state to another. Photomicrograph 4 This was taken within a brown region where the blue dye in the cotton fibers was altered to a brown color. Note how the vitreous polyester threads are broken up, perhaps due to surface tension. Again, this is not typical of charring. If you heat this with a laser or anything else, you would get carbonization. But there is no carbonization here. There is no oxidation. It's just a browning, and I think what that is is a break down of the dye inside the blue fibers. That's what gives it the brown color. With the continued application of this energy, of course, the polyester fibers begin to ball up and flow around a little because of surface tension affects, or wetting affects.

With the continued application of this energy, of course, the polyester fibers begin to ball up and flow around a little because of surface tension affects, or wetting affects. This was taken in a transition region where the cotton threads changed from a blue to brown in the space of 2 millimeters. Note that in the region between the blue at the top and the brown at the bottom, the (blue dyed) cotton threads become very pale in color. In a space of 2 millimeters, this energy is changing from the discreet heating of the polyester and leaving the blue fibers as they are to a complete transformation in both the cotton and the polyester. So what we have in Photomicrograph 5 is a really good example of a very refined control on what is happening just 2 millimeters apart. The cotton remains blue in the upper part of the photoraph and yet it is scorching or turning brown only 2 millimeters away at the bottom of the photograph. That's right. That emphasizes this is not the usual kind of heating. Let's go to the analogy of the burner on your stove. You turn the burner on high and you know that if you come within a foot or six or eight inches of the burner with the back of your hand, you can feel the heat. Whatever this energy this is, it can keep something cool only 2 millimeters from something else that is heated up? That's right. (Imagine that your) hand moved only 2 millimeters and you would feel the heat and it would be hotter than hell, and you move it 2 millimeters away and it would be cold. The energy that did this is precisely controlled down to micron levels. Photomicrograph 6 This shows the normal weave of polyester threads in the mattress cover, which is all polyester. The beige color appears to be uniform throughout. Photomicrograph 7"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"This shows a missing vertical thread and three vitreous spots where horizontal fibers cross the missing thread space in the mattress cover. None of the other polyester fibers appear to be affected. This again demonstrates the very precise application of the energy that produced these anomalous effects. Yes, and it means that whatever interacted with this bed sheet, it selected one of the vertical threads in some strange way that caused this melting of the vertical thread and some of it is what we see deposited on the horizontal threads. That's right. Why did this one thin, vertical thread suddenly change its composition in some way without affecting any of the threads around it? That's right. Here the (interacting) energy can pick one fiber and totally convert it. I think this is both a chemical and structural conversion of the molecules. To change to and deposit vitreous material on the horizontal fibers and not affect anything underneath. It's astounding.\" Photomicrograph 8 \"The arrow shows a region where cotton fibers are embedded, apparently unchanged, within the hard vitreous polyester threads.\" Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
