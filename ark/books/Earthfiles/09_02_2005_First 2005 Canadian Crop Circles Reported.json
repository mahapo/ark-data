High River, Alberta Canada August 31, 2005 - Barley Paul Anderson: \"It's near High River, just south of Calgary, Alberta. Large circle with surrounding outer ring in barley, found August 28, 2005. Circle is said to be about 18 meters (60 feet) in diameter, with ring about 7.6 meters wide (25 feet). The total diameter is about 49 to 55 meters (160 to 180 feet), based on initial estimates. \"Some multi-directional lay in circle. Counterclockwise lay in ring. Land is gently hilly in the field. Barley is still quite green, may not be swathed for a couple of weeks yet. \"The formation has already been visited by a number of people. No tracks reportedly were seen initially, but there are not quite a few from all the visitors. The land manager (not owner) is calling it 'vandalism,' so he does not want any publicity. A few people reported cell phone problems inside the formation.\" H igh River, Alberta, Canada, ringed circle, reported August 28, 2005. Redness in upper right of photo below unidentified.

"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Steelman, Saskatchewan, Canada August 27, 2005 - Wheat T he Midale and Estevan region of southeastern Saskatchewan has been Canada's \"hot crop circle region\" since the mid-1990s, for reasons unknown. A simple circle was reported in wheat near Steelman, Saskatchewan, on August 27, 2005. The circle measured 23 meters (76) feet and the plants had been laid down counter- clockwise. This 2005 circle is near two other simple circles found in 2003. S imple circle reported August 27, 2005, near Steelman, Saskatchewan. Aerial photograph © 2005 by Lois Baillie, CCCRN Saskatchewan. In 2003, Paul Anderson's CCCRN Website reported about two simple circles that were discovered near Steelman on nearly the same date as the August 27, 2005, circle. \" The second formation of this 2003 year was near the Midale \"hot spot\" region of Saskatchewan and was another classic simple circle. ...It was first spotted on August 25 by pilot and CCCRN field research assistant John Erickson from nearby Estevan. \"On August 25, 2003, a simple single circle, the formation was again close to the edge of a road. The size of the circle was almost exactly the same as the first one, the diameter varying slightly from 16 meters (52 feet) to 16.25 meters (53 feet), with the mature wheat plants again flattened counterclockwise in an impressive tight, flat"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"spiral pattern. It was like a carbon copy of the first circle in Steelman (this year), although in this case the field had already been harvested. With the plants pressed flat to the ground however, the circle itself was still quite intact and in good condition by the time of our investigation. ...While stretched nodes or nodes with expulsion cavities weren't found, stems with twisting below the seed heads were, similar to other cases in Canada this year at Revenue, Saskatchewan and Wallacetown, Ontario and in Canada and other countries in other recent years.\" S econd simple wheat circle reported on August 25, 2003, near Steelman, Saskatchewan, Canada, was one of two in same area that year. Now on August 27, 2005, another simple circle was reported in Steelman. Aerial photograph © 2003 by Paul Anderson. Aneroid, Saskatchewan August 14, 2005 - Peas A rancher was harvesting two pea fields on opposite sides of a road on August 14, 2005, when he found a downed circle of plants in each field. The two fields were an eighth of a mile apart. The rancher walked off each circle at about 39 feet in diameter. Four days later, on August 18, 2005, his brother found one of their best 4-month-old bull calves dead and mutilated. That pasture is about eighteen miles from the pea fields.
