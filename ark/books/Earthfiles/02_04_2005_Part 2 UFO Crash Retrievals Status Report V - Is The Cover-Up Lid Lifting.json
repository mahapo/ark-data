Click back to Part I To be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 2 of Status Report V. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Status Report VI begins at Earthfiles 022404 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. \"CASE 8) Wright-Patterson AFB, 1967-1968 I have many other items of C/R interest, or trivia, some deserving at least a brief reference. One concerns the disclosure of a fire department inspector who, while filing his report at my home in September 1987, said that he was also a fireman stationed at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1967-68. Aware of all buildings on the base and access to same in case of emergency, he and crew were instructed that if a fire were reported in a building in a certain section that they were to 'let it burn.' A sign read, 'No Fire Trucks Allowed.' He had heard 'rumors' that the building housed UFO material. 1953, the year and Arizona, the state - both are important in C/R activity. One new source, whose information is not included in this article for reasons of his own security, was involved in a retrieval operation in that year and state. Still another source, also not publishable for the same reason, also backs up the Kingman crash in 1953 and in Arizona. See Abstract 6, \"Retrievals of the Third Kind\" and \"Postscript On Two Key Cases,\" Page 43 of Status Report III regarding Kingman crash. Also see Case A-1, Status Report II , regarding three small humanoids retrieved in Arizona and received at Wright-Patterson AFB. The above references are anonymous sources. [ Status Report III and II will be reprinted in future Earthfiles.] As always, despite critics, I find it mandatory to maintain their trusts and keep their names confidential. PART II: ...TO THE BURST OF DAWN From my perspective, the official cover-up and the ways to control it seem as effective as ever up to the fall of 1987. Both the Kentucky and Ohio incidents described in Part I of this Status Report V, which involved civilians, show that anything goes - from trickery to threats - to keep the facts hidden. Then throughout 1988, like the burst of dawn, something changed. Whether or not the iron lid had loosened or not, more concerned people suddenly became more vocal. Of concern were the implications of MJ-12, the meaning of human abductions, the flap of low-level UFOs in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, the Gulf Breeze, Florida affair, and what was said and left unsaid about alien-human relations by two disguised informers called 'Condor' and 'Falcon' on TV's The UFO Cover-up - Live.** [ Editor's Note: See More Information below.] Yes, things have changed. It's reflected in my volume of mail and the phone calls I get at all hours. Is the cover-up in a 'calculator' countdown from ten to a three, two, one and lifting? "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Frankly, I don't think the time is right for a sudden formal announcement of alien 'visitors' by the world powers which would have unpredictable societal effects. If the press were to suddenly wake up and demand the bottom line of all the UFO happenings in the MJ-12 files, or were to confirm the horrors described in an expose of the alleged secret Project Grudge Report # 13 released by a former US Air Force Officer, Bill English, then we would have more to worry about than just the stock market. [ Editor's Note: See More Information below.] But maybe the cover-up is loosening a little because of new pressures, or guilt, or leaks, or the fear of more Falcons and Condors? Maybe we are being spoon fed in various ways and the masqueraded Falcon and Condor are only doing their job. But, while the media still sleeps amid all the UFO 'noise,' I have seen a change on my thermostat. For whatever reason, I'm getting suddenly more C/R input which I share briefly as follows: CASE 9) Kecksburg, Pennsylvania, December 9, 1965 Thanks to the in-depth research of Stan Gordon, Director of the Pennsylvania Association for the Study of the Unexplained, headquartered in Greensburg, PA, the Kecksburg crash/retrieval case of December 9, 1965, might now find recognition as a classic in the annals of ufology. Considering the number of witnesses tracked down by the PASA group, it might be upfront with Roswell. As 'Case B-1,' the Kecksburg incident originally was reviewed in Status Report II by Clark McClelland. But at that time, save for knowing that something had crashed and was retrieved, there was some uncertainty about the nature of the object. The US Air Force, of course, explained it away as a meteorite. Others suggested space debris. Gordon, however, accepted neither explanation as more information and FOIA data surfaced. In the spirit of cooperation, he kept me informed. Then in 1987, by good fortune, Stan met 'Pete' who showed up at a PASA UFO exhibit at a local mall. Having feared ridicule for 12 years, he finally decided to tell his story. It began at age 19 as a fireman when his unit in a nearby village was summoned by the Kecksburg authorities to help in the search for something that crashed in a wooded area, possibly an aircraft. But the shocker, he said, was when the crash site was located. They found instead of an aircraft, something else - a large acorn-shaped object embedded deep into the ground. Armed with Pete's new information, Gordon published the full Kecksburg story in great detail in Pursuit, the final quarter 1987 issue. In this lengthy paper, he reports the UFO's flight pattern across several states, tells of the firsthand experiences of local residents who saw the fireball crash and of others who witnessed the sudden, incursive 'takeover' by the military to perform the retrieval operation. According to Gordon, many of the local citizens viewed the action as constituting a state of martial law. Gordon commented, 'Many were influenced enough by their contacts with military or local authorities to the effect that they refused to discuss what they saw or were told even to this day.' Before being chased from the crash site by the retrieval team, Pete and companions had a closehand look at the semi-submerged mystery object. To them, it appeared that the object had descended to about a 30 degree angle and had broken tree limbs and knocked down a 15 to 20 feet high tree before impacting the ground. The trench was about 25 feet long and the greatest depth in the ground was about 7 feet. It was puzzling that there were no signs of fire. The size of the acorn-shaped UFO - without windows or seams - could not be determined because of its submergence. But it was estimated to have been about 7 feet high and wide. Pete, in trying to give a better description of the craft, said that it gave him the impression of a deflated beach ball pushed in. Toward the bottom, there was a ring or bumper-like structure about 8 to 10 inches wide that seemed to cover the circumference of the object. On this bumper, he said, which was raised up off the surface, was a writing that looked like Egyptian hieroglyphics. He remembered the characters of broken and straight lines, dots, rectangles and circles. As a machinist for 25 years and familiar with metals - solid and liquid - he said, 'Never in my life have I seen the color of that metal in any shape or form.' Pete said he never will forget the excitement on his return to the Kecksburg fire hall which had been set up as a command post. It was swarming with military personnel, mostly US Air Force, and a lot of equipment was being carried in. Soon guards were at the front entrance and the firemen, before being dismissed from the building, were told to use outside toilets. There is much, much more to Gordon's article, like his learning later that Air Force records"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"showed that NORAD's Space Detection and Tracking System did not have any space junk re-entering Earth's atmosphere that day. Thanks to Gordon, I was privileged to interview Pete on the basis I would not use his name. Agreed, so Pete gave me his complete story, confirming Gordon's version. I asked him about the hieroglyphics, wondering if they could be Russian. 'No way!' he said. 'I'm of Russian-Polish descent and can read Russian. It was not Russian, nor American.' He added, 'I'll stake my life on it. The object was not man-made.' CASE 10) Roswell 1947 The crash and recovery of an 'alien' object near Roswell, New Mexico, in July 1947, so well documented by researchers Bill Moore and Stan Friedman and others. It's a case that should cause skeptics to think twice before they impugn the existence of UFOs or the plausibility of the extraterrestrial hypothesis. Though most of Roswell's firsthand sources were civilian, the overall evidence supporting this 'nuts-and-bolts' incident is massive and ironically is the report that news of the UFO's discovery at the base slipped out in an 'uncleared' press release by the Public Information Officer, 1st Lt. Walter Haut. Had it not been for a fast and effective cover-up, the full story once in public domain, could have rewritten what we know is history. Having been informed, perhaps mankind in his philosophical and geopolitical pursuits, would have chosen a wiser course. Except for rumors, the truth about Roswell did not surface until 1978 when the late Jesse Marcel told an NBC radio newsman, Steve Tom, in Chicago about his official role as the intelligence officer assigned to the crash site to retrieve the scattered debris. On April 7, 1978, Tom called me and linked me up with Marcel in Houma, Louisiana, to get his story firsthand. This led to other calls to Marcel. Upon learning that we had served in the 5th Air Force during WWII in the same combat areas in Leyte of the Philippines, we developed a feeling of camaraderie and talked about meeting together for a UFO discussion in the near future. But for the moment, he had confirmed that the debris he combed from the crash site on the Brazel ranch was not the remains of a balloon. Also, he had observed on a fragment of metal beam, a row of symbols that looked like hieroglyphics. (See Status Report II , Case A-10, and the preceding Kecksburg case describing hieroglyphic symbols.) Regretfully, I never got to meet Jesse Marcel as we had hoped to do. During 1978 when the floodgates opened for me with enormous C/R input, I was working at full capacity and plans to go 'here and there' were dropped. Bill Moore, however, concentrating on his book, The Roswell Incident made the trip and interviewed Marcel. Following is one statement in part by Marcel that still left some questions unanswered: Jesse Marcell: '...that next afternoon, we loaded everything into a B-29 on orders from Colonel Blanchard and flew it all to Ft. Worth. I was scheduled to fly it all the way to Wright Field in Ohio, but when we got to Carswell at Ft. Worth, the general nixed it. He took control at this point, told the press it was all a weather balloon, and ordered me not to talk to the press under any circumstances. I was pulled off the flight and someone else was assigned to fly the stuff up to Wright Field ... (Italics mine. LS). My Status Reports do pay off. Thanks to one reader, John August, in Hawaii, I got the 'missing link' referred to by Marcel as the officer who flew the B-29 with the Roswell remains to Wright Field. Following up his initial phone call with the news, on Labor Day of 1988, John August wrote in part the following: John August: 'Confirmation of the Roswell crash reached me through a Maui resident who claimed that her father, Captain O. W. Henderson, flew the retrieved spaceship from Roswell to Wright Field on a B-29. According to Henderson's wife, who was reached by phone, a news officer reported the incident. But it was quickly quieted down. On February 17, 1981, the story appeared in the tabloid, Globe , and Henderson admitted to his wife and daughter that the story was true. The (extraterrestrial) crew, she said, were little people with exceptionally large heads. ...At the time, Henderson was stationed with the 509th Bomb Group at Roswell. It was an elite group for which all involved required high security clearances. Besides being a highly decorated pilot during WWII with over 30 combat missions, Henderson was in charge of the movement of all passengers and freight transported by air for organizations participating in the atomic bomb tests and the Manhattan Project (at Los Alamos, New Mexico.) ... Enclosed, as a result of August's attentive spadework, were copies of photos showing Captain Henderson and flight crew. There was also a letter of commendation for an"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"'excellent job accomplished' from Carl Spaatz, Commanding General, AAF, forwarded to Colonel William Blanchard, Commander, 509th, Roswell. For verification, John August footnoted his letter with Mrs. Henderson's address and phone number. Calling her on October 1, 1988, I explained my work. I asked many questions to which she cordially responded and I got approval to publish her name in this report, minus address. She said that her husband, known as 'Pappy' among his buddies, passed away in 1986. He stated unequivocally that he flew the B-29 with the Roswell wreckage to Wright Field and kept the secret faithfully until 1981. She remembers his comment, 'I've been dying to tell you for years, but could not. It was Top Secret.' When I asked Mrs. Henderson if he had ever described the object he transported, she said he told her, 'It was strange,' avoiding details. CASE 11) Roswell 1947 Alien Body Eyewitness It seems that avoiding details goes with the business of covert work, if one must talk at all. And so it was with another source who managed to whisper a few words on his death bed about his stealthy activity at Roswell in 1947. The source, Bev, is British. Her father was a former American serviceman, a staff sergeant, who served and took up residence in England following duty in the Pacific theater of WWII. Notably he was with the 509th Bomb Group at Walker Field, Roswell. According to records, he was at Roswell during the same time as Major Jesse Marcel and Captain O. W. Henderson. Bev, referred to me by Timothy Good, British author of Above Top Secret, is by the tone of her letters and phone calls sincere in trying to verify her dad's alleged participation in the Roswell retrieval case. He sent me copies of all his military records, they do confirm Bev's father's assignment at Walker Field in Roswell. Such are medical records, one with orders cut for hospitalization at the base for both Bev's father and Major Marcel, along with his pass to the base's Non-Com Club that is dated July 1947. As a child, Bev recalls her dad talking about his hush-hush work at Roswell and whenever he described the nondescript bodies, her response was to giggle. The subject never came up much, she said, until she was a teenager. Once, she recalls, he had read a feature story in a newspaper about a UFO crash and looking grim, he told about his experience of standing guard where the bodies were stored and cautioned all family members to keep it quiet, lest he get into trouble. According to Bev's long letter and attached military records, she recalled the following: ' ...he stood guard once outside a hangar where a crashed saucer was stored. He could not see anything as it was all packed up and ready to be flown out to Texas the next day. We disagree on the number of bodies he saw. I'm sure he said two, but one of my sisters said three ... All available men stood guard duty around the site where a crashed disc had come down and they could not understand why they had to be kept cold, as there were trucks of ice. ...Although he and others were told they would get into trouble if they saw too much, they did look under the cover and saw two small dead bodies. He said they were like us, but not like us. They were smaller than a normal man with large heads and slanted eyes. He also said they looked yellowish, a bit Asian. ...I remember when I got older and asked for more information, he got angry and said, 'That's all I know and I shouldn't have told you that much.' Whenever he talked about it, he always looked worried. ...\" His last words, according to Bev, were before he died in a hospital in February 1986 and were about Roswell. CASE 12) Alien Humanoid Shot at Ft. Dix-McGuire AFB, 1978 "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"McGuire AFB and Fort Dix Military Reservation near Wrightstown, New Jersey, are near the U. S. Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, New Jersey. The bases are about 45 miles east of Philadelphia, 50 miles south of New York City, 60 miles north of Atlantic City and 10 miles west of the Atlantic ocean. The Fort Dix/McGuire Air Force Base/ Lakehurst Naval Air Station complex covers 42,000 acres. When I last made contact in January 1987 with Jeff Morse, the former 'Blue Beret' who lifted the lid on the Ft. Dix-McGuire affair, I felt that my chase for more supportive information - at least through him - had ended and I was back on the treadle of the proverbial squirrel's cage. As agreed, Morse met with Dick Hall and his brother William (an electronics engineer), Dr. Bruce Maccabee, Chairman of the Fund for UFO Research, and with me in a busy mall near Washington, D. C., in January 1987. Over lunch, he openly answered any questions about the incident, but grimaced over the tangled and costly prospects of his current legal pursuits in Federal Court involving an incident of harassment (See MUFON UFO Journal, June 1987). On departure, he said he planned to return to his work overseas and I wished him well and thought of the seven years I had spent investigating his case. No word from Morse since, but his words that day left the four of us believing that he was telling the truth about the ill-fated alien interloper. Since I presented Morse's story in Status Report IV at the MUFON Symposium in St. Louis in 1985, there was a spark of hope in 1986 of getting a new source as backup - a former master sergeant who was stationed at Ft. Dix in January of 1978. According to Pat Marcattilio, a MUFON investigator in New Jersey, the source known as 'Mr. S,' whom Pat knew at a place of previous employment, told Pat that he heard the rumors about the incident. On his own time, 'Mr. S' tried to round up the facts. But he got nowhere and learned that all records, tapes, everything, had been destroyed. He was also advised to stop snooping. When Marcattilio later tried to get more details from 'Mr. S', Pat said, 'He seemed very nervous and refused to talk about it.' In September 1988, a new source with convincing credentials called me about the incident. As a MUFON State Section Director in New Jersey and presently serving as vice president of the Air Force Association, he was in January 1978 an intelligence officer with rank of major at McGuire AFB. Although not a witness to the retrieval operations, he was in a key position to put the 2+2 together enough to give credence to the story told by Morse. His letter of September 5, 1988, to me follows in part: ' ...I attempted to recall as best I could the report of the alien being shot on the base back in January 1978. My job was Deputy Director of 21st Air Force Intelligence 438th Military Wing Intelligence. In this dual role, we were responsible for briefing both the 21st Air Force Commander, who controlled all military airlift aircraft in half the world over to India and the Wing Commander at McGuire AFB. I remember walking into the 21st Command Post and most people were talking about an incident that had occurred on the base during the night. The report was that an alien, a short little guy, had died from a gunshot wound. No one seemed to know where he came from or what he was doing on the base. At first, it was treated as a joke and that the Security Police must have meant an alien from another country, like Mexico. Usually, I would brief the Commander, Major General Tom Sadler, on anything important that occurred during the night. We were concerned about acts of terrorism, hijacking and Soviet movements that could be a threat to our aircraft. Normally, if something was felt to be important, I would either brief the General in a stand-up briefing in the Command Post, or if it was classified Above Top Secret, in his office."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" ...Later in the morning, I was told that Intelligence would not brief the General on the alien; that the Security Police Commander or a Liaison Officer was handling it. Later in the day, I saw the officer who was a Lt. Colonel (name unknown) coming out of the general's office. He looked tired and somewhat under pressure. He said, 'Hello.' I expected the Lt. Colonel to fill me in on the situation, but he avoided saying anything. ...Assuming this was an alien, I wonder how he got lost from his craft?'\" Continued in Part 3 - UFO Crash in El Yunque, Puerto Rico, in 1984? More Information: Condor ** Len Stringfield: \"The identities of both 'birds' are known to me. Condor was a U. S. Air Force officer stationed at Wright-Patterson AFB in September 1985 during which time he called me on several occasions. Expressing interst in my resarch and my sources, he claimed to know a colonel with sensitive information relative to my work, but his proposal for me to meet with this source fell through. I heard no more. Later I learned that he confided with a member of the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR) and after that with William Moore and others.\" Grudge Report # 13 On March 9, 1980, two weeks before my documentary, A Strange Harvest, about the worldwide animal mutilation mystery was broadcast, I received a telephone call from a man named William English. He was phoning to talk about a memorandum that had been prepared by UFO researcher, author and retired U.S. Air Force Colonel Wendelle Stevens. The subject was the existence of a \"Project Grudge Report Number 13, TOP SECRET\" The information had been sent to the Aerial Phenomenon Research Organization (APRO) in Tucson, Arizona, headed by Jim and Coral Lorenzen, now deceased. Mr. English called to tell me the story was true. He said he saw the report when he served with the U. S. Air Force in England in 1977. He explained that he had talked to Wendelle Stevens about the sensitive material outlined in the memo. Bill English wanted me to know that in the TOP SECRET Grudge 13 report, he had seen photographs of both animal and human mutilations. That March day in 1980, I did not know what to believe and did not include the information in A Strange Harvest (KMGH-TV, CBS, Denver, Colorado, first broadcast on May 28, 1980.) Below is a summary about th e \"Project Grudge Number 13\" report that Bill English and I discussed. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Memorandum notes typed by retired U. S. Air Force Col.
