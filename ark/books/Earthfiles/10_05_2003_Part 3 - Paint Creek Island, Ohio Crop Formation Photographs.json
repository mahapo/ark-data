The formation is four miles west of the ancient Seip Mound and about thirty miles from the Serpent Mound. This is the third formation at the mounds in 2003. Paint Creek Island, near Bainbridge in Ross County, Ohio, formation in soybeans about 30 miles from the Serpent Mound pattern - both probably occurred around same date of August 24, 2003.

Jeffrey Wilson, Independent Crop Formation Investigator, Master's Degree in General Science, Dexter, Michigan: \"To make the triangle, the plants were actually curved and bent at the proper angle to make the points of the triangle. It wasn't as if the plants were laid down flat and then another set of plants were laid down flat to make that angle of the triangle. The plants were bent in that angle. You can't really bend soybean plants without snapping the stalks. So we found that to be quite convincing.\" Corner of triangle in soybeans. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Close-up triangle corner. At the end of one of the arms, there is a Y-shaped pattern which is also crossed by half an arc. That feature is there and is part of the formation. The arc was about three or four feet wide and it started on the western most side and swirled in the direction clockwise to the eastern most side before it just ended. The plants are curved in on themselves to define the end of that little arc. The arms themselves are laid down directed toward the edge from the center, and where all three of those arms meet - that is one of the places where they are woven together in about four different layers. The thin, half arc on the Y-shaped pattern where soybean plants were laid down in four different layers woven together. We also discovered the same kinds of leaf base damage that we discovered in the Serpent Mound formation. Again, we don't believe that is a hoaxable effect, although we're still studying the effects on soybeans from certain things and we couldn't say for 100% sure, but we're pretty certain that's not a hoaxable effect. Leaf base damage in some of the soybean plants laid down in the Paint Creek formation. Some people talk about a 'veil' pattern where there will be single standing stalks of wheat that are separating two circles. That also happened with this Paint Creek one. The triangular circles away from the central circle were down almost to a single line of soybean plants that were still standing, kind of a 'veil' effect there.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Thin \"veil\" of single row of plants separating the central circle from the triangle at the end of one of the formation's three arms.
