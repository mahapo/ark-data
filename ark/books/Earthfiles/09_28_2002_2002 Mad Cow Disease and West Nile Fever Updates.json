The Lancet medical journal reports that a 25-year-old woman in Sicily has variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) which has killed 128 people in Europe since mad cow disease was first detected in England in the mid-1990s. The current medical theory is that the brain and nerve damaging prion disease in cows was spread to people who ate prion-infected beef. New variant CJD has nearly a 100% mortality rate. Of great concern to health authorities is the fact that the young woman in Sicily had never traveled to Britain or other European regions affected by mad cow disease such as France and Ireland. So, Italy's Health Ministry ordered an investigation of Italian cows and so far 73 have tested positive for the deadly prion disease. More Than 2,300 Cases of West Nile Fever Virus in U. S.

September 27, 2002 Trenton, New Jersey - Today, the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services confirmed two more cases of West Nile virus bringing the state's total for the year to six. One patient is a 65-year-old Moorestown resident and the other is a 79-year-old from Wildwood Crest. Both have been released from hospitals after several weeks of recovery.

In Pennsylvania, 24 West Nile Fever illnesses have been reported and three people died. The total United States cases so far in 2002 have been more than 2,300 and 116 people have died. New Jersey officials believe their population was not as badly affected this year because health departments urged residents everywhere to keep standing water near homes clean or empty altogether to eliminate the watery places in which mosquitoes like to breed.
