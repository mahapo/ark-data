Return to Part 1 July 19, 2007 / Updated July 27, 2007 Alton Priors, Wiltshire, England - On Tuesday, July 10, 2007, Charles Mallet, Owner, Silent Circle Cafe near Cherhill, Wiltshire, England, had gone to see the massive East Field wheat formation that apparently formed within a 90-minute window of time early Saturday morning, July 7, 2007. (See Part 1.) As Charles Mallett was gathering some wheat and soil samples for study, a large, black, unmarked helicopter came over the field and within 50 feet of Charles. He said to me in a phone interview, \"It was very intimidating, but I knew whoever was flying was not going to crash that expensive machine into the East Field and was not going to start strafing with bullets along that peaceful English farm land of Wiltshire.\" But who exactly was in that large, unmarked helicopter and all the other military helicopters that have swooped low over the East Field formation since July 7th. Not only has the military helicopter activity over the East Field been the most intense anyone has seen there, the unidentified choppers have brought with them something that smells bad, burns peoples' eyes, makes them nauseous - even to vomiting - and has caused a dosimeter to climb above safe radiation monitoring levels at least twice. This week I talked with long-time crop formation investigator, Andrew J. Buckley, a professional graphic artist from Winsford, Cheshire, England. He has been concentrating on the East Field since the big July 7th event, keeping his videotape running as the helicopters have appeared. Andy begins with what happened to him on Monday, July 16th. Interview: Monday, July 16, 2007, East Field "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"T he center yellow circle highlights the location of the huge East Field near Alton Priors, Wiltshire, beneath Knap Hill, highlighted at upper right, not far from Woodborough Hill, highlighted at lower center. Andrew J. Buckley, Graphic Designer, Winsford, Cheshire, England: “I had arrived at the East Field, having walked from Woodborough Hill. When I arrived at what is known as the silage pit, which is just off the East Field, I was on foot walking down the road, I noticed there were some vehicles parked on the side. They were what I would describe as vans, white vans. They were unmarked. There were three of them and there was a person standing by one of the vans. But I did see somebody in the formation and I assumed they were from the white vans. I walked past the van and was about to walk into the field and the person standing by one of the vans came up to me and said to the effect, ‘Excuse me, where do you think you are going?’ I said, ‘Well, I’m just going to go have a look at the formation.’ He said, ‘You do realize this is private property?’ And something else to the effect that, ‘I’m acting on behalf of the farmer.’ There was some kind of project going on at the moment and would I stay out of the field. I said, ‘All right, but can you tell me what’s going on?’ He said, ‘No.’ ANDY, DID YOU ASK HIM WHO HE REPRESENTED? He looked formally dressed, not in military fatigues, but he looked rather official. I mentioned the farmer, that I knew Tim Carson, the farm owner. He didn’t really respond. He said he had not heard of anybody called Tim Carson! [ The Carsons have owned the East Field and huge farm for decades.] At that point, I was getting a bit fed up with this, so I decided to go into the field and see what kind of reaction I would get. I walked toward the East Field and he walked towards me and kind of blocked my way. He said, ‘You would be ill advised to go in there at the moment. All I have to do is ring the farmer.’ I said, ‘Well, I know the farmer. And you just kind of denied you know him. But I actually know the guy.’ Then I tried to draw him into a conversation about it. I’ve written some notes shortly after they had gone. (Reading from his notebook.) ‘He said there were personnel – he used the word personnel – in the East Field.’ And they actually returned while I was standing there. These guys came out of the formation and I saw them walking down the tramlines. It was rather strange. There were about four or five of them and they seemed to be wearing the same gear, which looked rather odd. They were wearing what I'd describe as white coveralls and when they got out of the field, they were carrying samples. They had obviously taken plant samples of wheat and stuff, had put into bags and were carrying these things. They went to one of the vans, opened up the back and put the samples in the back. One of the guys was carrying a lot of equipment that looked to me like bags containing either photographic equipment or possibly some other equipment. They didn’t speak to"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"me. The chap I spoke to earlier seemed to be the commander-in-chief. He was telling them what to do and they quickly got into the vans. Before they went, he asked me if I knew anyone else who was coming to the formation that morning. I asked him why he was asking me that question. He said, ‘You’d be advised to stay out of it because there is going to be some kind of military exercise there and you would be advised to stay out.’ I asked, ‘What kind of military activity?’ He just ignored me and got in the van and all drove off. They went in the direction of Pewsey and on down the road. At that point, I went back into the formation. I have a device with me that measures radiation levels. It’s a dosimeter, which I always use to test for residual radiation. So when I got in the East Field formation, I was sweeping it around and didn’t really notice anything significant. I hung around for while and I’d say around 9:30 AM, is when the military activity began, which he predicted. There were a lot of helicopters. There were Apache helicopters, Lynx, Gazelle, and they were all circling continually the East Field and this area more than normal activity. That went on for about an hour. By this time (10:30 AM), there were quite a few people in the formation who had come to look at it. By the way, I recorded all this on video, and about 11:30 AM, one helicopter appeared. It was a Gazelle and came down the valley very low. It took up a hovering position above the formation. It stayed there for awhile. Then it dropped down and started making very, very low level passes over the East Field formation and over the people who were in the formation, including me. And it was very intimidating. And at one point, it almost landed in the formation. It was extremely low. Now, this went on from – I’ve got it on the clock – from 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM (hour). Going towards 12:30 PM, it was still there and moved over towards Knap Hill and dropped down and came very, very slowly across the field at ground level. As it got to the crop formation, it rose slightly in the air and hovered. It hovered for about a couple of minutes, and then almost immediately, I and a few other people began to feel very unwell. It came on very suddenly and coincidentally with when that helicopter appeared. I started to get a very strong headache, felt quite nauseated. My mouth was very dry and my ears were popping. I immediately noticed there were two other people – we were standing in the same circle (one of about 100 circles in the extraordinary East Field July 7, 2007, wheat formation) – and I noticed they were behaving rather strangely. So, I went to them and asked, ‘Do you feel very unwell?’ And they said, ‘Yeah, that’s strange, isn’t it?’ The helicopter by that point had gone. It flew off and I never saw it again. But we felt noticeably unwell. ANDY, DID YOU SEE ANYTHING SPRAYED IN THE AIR FROM THAT HELICOPTER? No. No, not at that point. That was the Monday, which was a prelude to what happened on Wednesday, July 18, 2007, which was even worse! (laughs) Dosimeter Radiation Spike After Low-Flying Military Helicopters in East Field I had the dosimeter on and noticed the read out had gone up significantly from zero to between 60 and 80. It was fluctuating. WHAT DO YOU HYPOTHESIZE THE HELICOPTER WAS EMITTING? The only thing I can think of is to go back to Freddy Silva (investigator and author). In his book, Secrets of the Fields © 2002, he noticed similar phenomenon when he was in another East Field formation – might have been 2000 – and a black helicopter came over and he had again the same symptoms: headache, nausea. Freddy Silva put it down as infrasound. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia - Infrasound is sound with a frequency too low to be detected by the human ear. The study of such sound waves is sometimes referred to as infrasonics, covering sounds from the lower limit of human hearing (about 16 or 17 hertz) down to 0.001 hertz. This frequency range is the same one that seismographs use for monitoring earthquakes. Infrasound is characterized by an ability to cover long distances and get around obstacles with little dissipation. Possibly the first observation of naturally-occurring infrasound was in the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"aftermath of the Krakatoa eruption in 1883, when concussive acoustic waves circled the globe seven times or more and were recorded on barometers worldwide. Infrasound was also used by Allied forces in World War I to locate artillery; the frequency of the muzzle blast from firing was noti ceably different than that produced by the explosion, allowing the two sources to be discriminated. One of the pioneers in infrasonic research was French scientist Vladimir Gavreau, born in Russia as Vladimir Gavronsky. His interest in infrasonic waves first came about in his lab during the 1960s where he and his lab assistants experienced pain in the ear drums and shaking lab equipment, but no audible sound was picked up on his microphones.] Wednesday, July 18, 2007, East Field More Aggressive Unmarked Military Helicopters I’ve been going in the East Field formation every morning (since July 7, 2007) with my video camera, really just to monitor it. And at precisely 12:47 PM (time code on videotape), I looked down the valley towards Martinsell Hill, which is not that far away, and I saw three bright lights in the sky, sort of in alignment. They appeared to be hovering fairly low down, just below the height of Martinsell Hill. Then I suddenly became aware that they were coming towards me and they were coming down the valley very low heading straight for the East Field formation. There were three helicopters and I’ve never seen these before. I’m used to most of the helicopters here, but these were very, very large and all black, unmarked helicopters. They were flying side-by-side. As they got half way down the valley, they broke formation and the helicopter on the left moved toward the side of the hills (Knap Hill et al). They were very low down. The helicopter on the right moved to the right. And the helicopter in the center carried on until they arrived at the East Field formation. Then for the next – I’ve got it starting at 12:47 PM - for the next ten to fifteen minutes, all three helicopters circled the formation at very, very low levels. They would occasionally fly down the valley and come back again. The helicopter in the middle came down extremely low. They were very intimidating. They were very big helicopters. The only comparison I can make is that a friend of mine who knows Gordon Stuart, who you know. He’s an aircraft expert. One afternoon we went to Middle Wallop, the Air Corp base, and we saw helicopters very similar to one of these East Field helicopters and Dave said instantly, ‘That’s an SAS Special Forces helicopter.’ I got a very good view of the central helicopter over the East Field in my video and I cannot see any markings on it whatsoever. It seems to be completely unmarked, black and big. What was significant, though – I think they made a series of three passes – there were quite a few people in the formation and they were very, very scared by this. I mean, some people ran out of the formation as these helicopters were obviously very intimidating. But on the final approach, the center helicopter came back down again and on that third pass, we got the same effect we had on Monday, except it was far more pronounced. It was very, very powerful what appeared to be coming from this helicopter. And this time, it was a lot worse. This time, there was quite severe vomiting. (laughs) And I was throwing up quite badly, actually. There was a terrible smell from the helicopter. I can describe it as being a sulfurous smell – very powerful! It made my eyes burn. I noticed half a dozen other people as well – they were quite severely affected. I saw one man throwing up into the crop. I was actually shouting to these people to get out of the formation, which we did. Andy's Dosimeter Rose Above Danger Threshold The other thing was that I got my dosimeter and it had shot up very, very high, between 300 and 500. It says on the alarm threshold that if it goes higher than 275, that signifies a radiation risk. This dosimeter I have is used in nuclear power stations to measure radiation levels. If it goes above 275, it gives off a signal, which it was giving off on Wednesday in the East Field, which means get out of the place. It’s dangerous! THAT MEANS , ANDY, THAT THE THREE, LARGE UNMARKED, UNIDENTIFIED CHOPPERS WERE EMITTING SOMETHING THAT MADE YOU VOMIT, BUT ALSO RADIATION WOULD HAVE BEEN INVOLVED?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"It seems like it. This meter was picking up very high levels of radiation, which dropped off quite suddenly when the helicopters disappeared. So, that gave me an indication that the radiation was tied in with the three helicopters. DID ANY OF YOU SEE ACTUAL PHYSICAL SPRAY COMING FROM THE HELICOPTERS? I could smell this and I got the impression that something was being emitted from the helicopter, but it was very difficult to determine. It seemed to be colorless. But what happened later, the same afternoon, Foeke Kootje was videotaping near Woodborough Hill and an Apache helicopter started circling quite low. I and others were in the silage pit at the East Field nearby. That helicopter moved between us and Woodborough Hill and something was dropped out of the helicopter and it left what looked like a pink trail in the sky that came right down to the ground. That stayed in the air for awhile and there was a funny smell – it was an unusual smell, not like normal smoke or anything like that.\" I have talked with other eyewitnesses of the July 18th events. Gill Nicholas has been visiting crop formations in Wiltshire since they began nearly 20 years ago. She has seen helicopters circle over crop formations before. But told me by phone that she has never seen any helicopters as big and solid black as what she saw on July 18th. Gill was at the East Field silage pit with her Australian friend, Megan, when both women watched a very large, all-black, unmarked helicopter come down within 10 to 15 feet over the heads of a young couple standing in one of the circles. The couple hurried out of the field, clearly upset by the low-hovering chopper. Then across the road from the East Field, the two women watched another helicopter hovering between Tawsmead Copse and Woodborough Hill. Gill said that helicopter was “discharging a gas that was spiraling from the helicopter over the crop.” Gill said the gas spray was a grey color. Further down the field toward Woodborough Hill, two other friends were videotaping the East Field. Foeke and Connie Kootje from Holland both saw – what they called – “two projectiles” come out of a helicopter right before a pink cloud of smoke could be seen in the air. The Kootjes, Andy Buckley and others looked in the fields between Woodborough Hill and the East Field for any objects that might have been dropped. But to date, nothing unusual has been found. Andy Buckley also went to the owners of the East Field and asked Tim Carson if he knew about what the helicopters were doing. Andy also asked about a South African man driving a large silver Hummer vehicle. Andy and others have encountered the Hummer driver who seems very hostile, but will not talk to anyone. Even though Andy has known Tim Carson for several years and discussed crop formations with him, Tim Carson did not want to talk to Andy in the week of July 16th to 20th, while white, unmarked vans collected plant samples from the East Field and all the unidentified military helicopters kept flying low over the field scaring and making visitors sick.
