Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Crop Formations In North Dakota © 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe Map showing Langdon and Grand Forks, North Dakota near the Canada and Minnesota borders where four pictograms in wheat have been discovered since July 20th. August 20, 2000 Langdon, North Dakota - Today I talked with crop duster pilot, John Boe, who has been flying and spraying cereal crops for the past seven years around Langdon, North Dakota - a farming community near the Canada and Minnesota borders. Last month, on July 20th, he was flying over the Janelle and Randy Bata farm three miles west of Langdon when he saw what looked like a tinkertoy of half a dozen circles connected by a path in a wheat field. Then four days later on July 24th, a dumbbell formation was discovered on the Bob Ullyott farm north of Langdon. It was 155 feet long. The local newspaper, the Cavalier County Republican , took an aerial photograph and published it. Discovered July 24, 2000, the large circle was 90 feet diameter; the path connecting it to the ring was 30 feet; the ring was 3 feet wide; the space between the ring and inner flattened small circle was 15 feet; the inner circle was 17 feet diameter.

This was a circle bracketed by what looked like parenthesis marks on each side. From north to south, it was 211 feet long. Next, on August 9th in a farm community called Thompson south of Grand Forks, North Dakota, another formation turned up on the Paul Adams farm. This was a circle bracketed by what looked like parenthesis marks on each side. From north to south, it was 211 feet long. Parenthesis mark on north was 160 feet long and 9 feet wide; space to circle was 33 feet; circle was 125 feet diameter; then 34 feet to the other parenthesis on the south which was 162 feet long and 10 feet wide.

The next day, August 10th, back on the Janelle and Randy Bata farm west of Langdon, a more complicated pattern of paths and circles stretching about 100 feet long was discovered again by pilot John Boe. Eight foot long path leads into 34 foot diameter circle from the south. Then two paths connect the large circle to a 19 foot diameter circle from which a 23.5 foot long path leads north to a T-bar.

Stace Tussel, who investigates for Midwest Research in Denver, Colorado founded by Ron Russell, drove 17 hours to examine the floor lays, take measurements and plant samples from three of the four pictograms. Stace told me that the most amazing lay of crop was in the most recent pattern found in Langdon on August 10th. Stace Tussel, who investigates for Midwest Research in Denver, Colorado founded by Ron Russell, drove 17 hours to examine the floor lays, take measurements and plant samples from three of the four pictograms. Interview: Stace Tussel, Crop Formation Investigator, Midwest Research, Denver, Colorado: \"And as you go in about ten feet into it, the lay of the wheat is all horizontal. It's not with the flow of the path. It's across the path. Straight lay of crop extending into ring of counter-clockwise wheat in August 10, 2000 formation discovered west of Langdon on Janelle and Randy Bata farm. Photograph © 2000 by Stace Tusse l. And then about another ten feet into it, it starts to flow with the direction of the path. And it turns into the larger circle. The larger circle had a distinct outer ring going in a counter-clockwise direction and within the middle of this circle, the flow was southwest to northeast straight across. LIKE THE PATH? Yes. And like the radial splay in the smaller circle as far as being straight without any swirl. But the outside edge was swirled. And then on the southern edge just to the southeast of the extension, there were bunched stalks that were going the opposite direction into the standing wheat. So there was opposing lay right at the edge there."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"ANY EXTENDED NODES OR EXPULSION CAVITIES IN THIS ONE? The odd thing about this formation, Linda, is that the nodes were compressed. The nodes were shrunken in. They were brown, but sunken in.\" Stace also found a ladybug in the August 10th wheat formation that had a shriveled right wing \"like it was melted plastic. The edges were scalloped. The left wing was perfectly normal.\" Could the ladybug's wing have been exposed to whatever energy interacted with the wheat to create the pictogram? Ladybug with shriveled right wing \"like melted plastic\" inside August 10, 2000 wheat formation west of Langdon, North Dakota. Photograph © 2000 by Stace Tussel.
