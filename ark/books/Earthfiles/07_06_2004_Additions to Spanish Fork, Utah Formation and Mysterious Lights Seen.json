Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Additions to Spanish Fork, Utah Formation and Mysterious Lights Seen © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe Spanish Fork, Utah, is about 50 miles south of Salt Lake City. July 6, 2004 Spanish Fork, Utah - Melissa Crumpton has gone more than once to the Spanish Fork, Utah, formation to measure the dimensions of its rings for Nancy Talbott's BLT crop and soil research project. The first time was after the farm owner reported the pattern on Sunday, June 27, 2004. That's when it looked like the aerial image below taken before July 1, by KSL-TV, Channel 5, from Salt Lake City. The large center ring measured 25 feet east to west and 24.5 feet north to south, almost a perfect circle. The pattern's overall dimensions were 207 feet by 118 feet, including the later addition of a fourth \"eyeball\" that appeared in two stages between Thursday, July 1, and Sunday, July 4. The KSL television aerial below does not show the \"eyeball\" addition. KSL might do more aerial photography and if so, this report will be updated. Melissa Crumpton is working on a new diagram that will show the additional feature with all the pattern's measurements. Spanish Fork, Utah, formation in barley first noticed by farm owners on Saturday night, June 26, 2004. Large ring measured 25 feet east to west and 24.5 feet north to south, almost a perfect circle. Whole formation, including later added fourth \"eyeball\" measured 207 feet by 118 feet. Aerial photograph © 2004 by KSL-TV, Channel 5, Salt Lake City, Utah. It was on Sunday, July 4th, when Melissa went back to the formation to make more measurements that she found the addition had been altered again into something she compared to an \"eyeball.\" That afternoon, I received calls from Utah phenomena researcher, Ryan Layton, saying a family had seen mysterious lights \"dancing around\" over the same area that the \"eyeball\" later emerged. As I have reported in my book, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles , many people over the past decade have seen small lights around crop formations. The eyewitnesses have requested anonymity, but the wife agreed to talk on the record about what she had seen with her husband and son, and later with her daughter. They also took photographs with a digital camera and a small cardboard throw-away camera which will be added to this report when available. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Interview: Female Eyewitness of Mysterious Lights, Spanish Fork, Utah : \"Saturday night, July 3, 2004, we went over there. I had been there during the day a couple of times. It was around 11:30 p.m. and me and my husband and my son went over and we were looking to see if we could find any kids messing around. Small White Lights When we got there, we saw these little golf ball-size lights with tails. And there was probably fifteen or twenty of them. COLOR? They was different. Some of them were brighter or darker it depended on how close they were. The closer they were, the brighter they were. The farther they were, they even took on a kind of amber color. COULD YOU DESCRIBE WHAT KIND OF MOTION THEY WERE MAKING? Little squiggles all over. They wouldn't make a straight line. They made squiggles or curled or would do, almost dance. HOW CLOSE TO THE TOPS OF THE CROP WERE THEY? Some were right down into it. They kind of hung out on the southeast side (of the pattern). They all got together and were kind of dancing around. I told my husband I was going back the next day to see in the light. YOUR HUSBAND COULD SEE THEM AS WELL? Yes. We have them on video. We got them last night. However, what is really weird is that we took 26 or 27 pictures and we had a digital camera. We were taking pictures and we got to the end of it when we had a whole bunch of them and the camera started self-deleting and we had to turn the camera off to save. We had nearly 30 pictures and we ended up with 12 because that's how fast they were self-deleting. \"Ostrich Egg\"-Sized Orange Orb Paced Car The really strange thing is that the little white things somehow combine and become the orange orbs. I don't know exactly how that happens. Anyway, after we got home, my daughter called me and asked where the crop circle was because she had never seen one. I told her the rings were by Butler Hill. She asked if I would go with her and I looked at the time and it was like 12:50 a.m., almost 1 o'clock in the morning on Sunday, July 4. Why would we want to go there then? She said, 'I want to see it.' So I said we could go. She came to my house and we got in my car at about fifteen minutes until 1 a.m. (Utah time). We both got in the front seat and her husband got in the back seat. We were driving on an old country road. We only live about six miles away from the crop circle. On the outskirts of town, there is a cemetery and we took the old road to see if we could see anything. When we were passing the cemetery, Alfredo (daughter's husband) hollered, 'Oh, my God, look at that!' I looked over and there was this orange thing that was like an ostrich egg tipped to its side and it was floating to the side of us (driving in the car.) I noticed it for a few seconds. ABOUT SIX INCHES IN DIAMETER? Yes, like an ostrich egg and amber the color of a glowing coal. A GLOWING COAL TO ME IS A RED, AND AMBER IS A YELLOW-GOLD. Between the two, somewhere between the two. The glow itself was bright, but it wasn't actually giving off light. The orange light was just like an ostrich egg. I told my daughter, 'Take a picture of that. See if you can get it on the camera.' We looked down at the camera and there were three little \"U's\" or letter \"V's\" and there was a little pocket of three of them. SO THE ORANGE LIGHT TO THE EYE ACTUALLY LOOKED ON THE DIGITAL CAMERA FRAME LIKE THREE U OR V-SHAPED OBJECTS?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Yes. Then the battery light came on in my car. I have a 1997 Camrey. My lights went bright and dim and bright and dim, my door locks opened unlocked and locked and unlocked and locked. Then the orange light vanished. We rolled down the window to see more, but it would only roll down an inch at a time. AS IF SOMETHING WERE REALLY INTERFERING WITH THE ELECTRICAL SYSTEM AND BATTERY OF YOUR CAR? Oh, yeah. That thing kind of floated next to us kind of like it was playing. That's exactly what it was doing to my car. At one point my daughter says, 'Right now, it's behind us, about a car length behind us.' I was driving and I had my foot to the floor, but my car wouldn't go more than 35 mph. Then when the thing got ahead of us and flew away, it was only a matter of seconds I was going 65 mph because my foot was still floored to the gas. It was like, 'I've played enough. Now, I'm leaving.' WAS THIS ANYWHERE CLOSE TO WHERE THE SPANISH FORK CROP FORMATION IS? Yes, it followed me about half way there. When it vanished, it went in the general direction of the crop formations. WHY IS IT THAT YOU THINK THE SMALL WHITE OBJECTS THAT YOU SAW IN THE SPANISH FORK FORMATION MIGHT COME TOGETHER TO CREATE THE AMBER-RED LIGHTS? Because when I took pictures on the digital, I took pictures of the amber light. When I put them on screen on the digital, that's when they become the little white things. So, you can take a picture of the orange in the digital camera, but on your screen you see white little V-like things. We had probably 29 pictures and the camera malfunctioned or something and it was deleting everything. We had to turn it off, but we did save twelve. The \"Eyeball\" Addition to the Spanish Fork Formation Thursday, July 1, 2004 - Melissa Crumpton found a circle had been added 23 feet east from the outer ring of the large ring. Sunday, July 4, 2004 - Melissa found a further change in the circle of downed and standing plants that created the impression of an eyeball. COULD YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND WHAT HAPPENED FROM THE TIME THIS FORMATION WAS FIRST FOUND A WEEK AGO, AS I UNDERSTAND THERE HAVE BEEN ADDITIONS? Right, when the little white lights on Saturday night was kind of dancing and I told my daughter we did not see anyone in the formation. We did not see anyone around. I said, 'This is really weird. What are they doing?' They got all together and did the little dance thing. She said, 'I don't know. I don't understand it.' The next day on Sunday, July 4th, we went back there, the crop was in what looked like an eyeball in the circle that had been added on Thursday, July 1. Mental Impression of Rejuvenation in Formation THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS LINKED TO CROP FORMATIONS. Yes. There is no question in my mind. Right where those things were doing their little dance, the crop circle changed (into the eye). DID YOU GET ANY VISUAL OR MENTAL IMPRESSION WHEN YOU WERE NEAR THE LIGHTS? A lady asked me - said she had gone all over the world. After I walked into the circle, she came to me and asked, 'I want you to tell me the first thing that popped into your head when you walked into this crop circle.' I said, 'It's really weird because it was 'rejuvenation.' I don't know what that means. I don't know how that relates.' She said, 'Yes, I got the same feeling, but I don't fear them. I'm not afraid of them. They"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"aren't going to come and invade us. I just think they want us to know a little bit at a time hey, we're here and we're watching.' She also said she just got back from Cairo and witnessed some sand circles. She said there was the same kind of energy and that some kind of line or grid, a line of energy runs along the surface of the earth. LET ME SEE IF I UNDERSTAND THE SEQUENCE. THE FARM OWNER'S SON SAW THE FIRST PLANTS DOWN ON SATURDAY, JUNE 26. THE FARMER WENT OUT ON SUNDAY, JUNE 27, AND REPORTED IT TO THE POLICE. THEN ON THURSDAY, JULY 1, THERE WAS AN ADDITION OF A CIRCLE TO THE THREE RINGS AROUND THE LARGE RING. THEN YOU WERE THERE WITH YOUR HUSBAND AND DAUGHTER ON SATURDAY, WHICH WAS JULY 3, AND YOU ALL SAW THE WHITE LIGHTS MOVING AROUND. THEN YESTERDAY, SUNDAY ON JULY 4, IS WHEN AN EYE WAS FORMED WHERE YOU SAW THE LIGHTS MOVING AROUND ON SATURDAY? Ye s . AND LAST NIGHT, SUNDAY, JULY 4, YOU SAW THE AMBER LIGHT PACING YOUR CAR AND YOU TOOK STILL VIDEO IMAGES OF IT FROM YOUR CAR AS YOU TRAVELED BETWEEN THE CEMETERY AND THE FORMATION? That's right. AND THE AMBER LIGHT PACED YOUR CAR UNTIL ABOUT HALF WAY TO THE SPANISH FORK CROP FORMATION AND THEN IT TOOK OFF VERY QUICKLY. IS THAT ESSENTIALLY A CORRECT SUMMARY? Ye s . DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE GOING OUT THERE AGAIN TODAY? Oh, yes. I wish someone could take an aerial photograph of the thing now because you would see there are additions. ADDITIONS TO CROP FORMATIONS HAVE BEEN PART OF THE PHENOMENON GOING BACK TO THE EARLY 1990S. SO, FOR AT LEAST A DECADE, THIS HAS HAPPENED IN SEVERAL COUNTRIES. AND YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ANY LIGHTS LIKE THIS IN CROPS BEFORE? No, I've never seen a crop circle before in my life. OR THE LIGHTS? Right, never seen them before either.\" Websites: http://www.bltresearch.com/ http://www.cropcirclenews.com http://www.cropcircleconnector.com http://thecropcirclewebsite.50megs.com http://www.cropcircl eresearch.com http://home.clara.net/lucypringle http://www.bertjanssen.nl http://www. cccrn.ca/ http://www.dcca.nl http://www.invisiblecircle.de http://www.wylatowo.mogilno.pl/news.php?art=94 http://www.temporarytemples.co.uk http://www.swirlednews.com"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"http://www.heramagazine.net http://members.iinet.net.au/~bwratten/ccc.html http://www.CropCircleAnswers.com http://www.busty-taylor.com/cropper/98busty2.htm http://www.cropcircleconnector.com /ilyes/ilyes.html http://ufo.internauci.pl http://www.wylatowo.mogilno.pl Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
