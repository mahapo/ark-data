Here begins Part 2 of Status Report VII, from February 1994. Question: While the Simeone case probably had no connection with the 1942 incident, occurring \"north of Georgia,\" were the three WWII era crashes happening so close together, time-wise, a freak coincidence? Hardly. Or, were the mishaps a result of increased surveillance during a period of world conflict which began in September 1939? Digressing a moment, despite the reports of early mishaps, I opted to stretch a bit in my working hypothesis to allow for the susceptibility of crashes in 1947 in the USA Southwest, notably in New Mexico. As a postulate, the alien mind set might have had a concern for the U. S. rapid development of a nuclear and rocket-missile arsenal, and thus, were willing to take greater risks in low-level tactical missions. And, despite their marvels of technology, it is feasible that they might have underestimated the effects of radar or New Mexico's sudden violent electrical storms. Once again considering the 1941-1942 incidents, one other aspect to lend credence to an early alien presence during WWII is the so-called foo-fighter, a frequent aerial interloper observed by personnel flying in all types of military aircraft, in all theaters of war. Numerous reports of encounters started coming in during the latter part of 1943, a few earlier.

"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"One early-on foo-fighter incident, following the Pearl Harbor sneak attack, occurred over San Francisco and Los Angeles in 1942. For details of this well-known incident, I refer to a massive report: The White Sands Proving Ground UFO Incidents of 1947, by researcher Tim Cooper, who specializes in the history of UFO happenings in the early days of the post-war period. I quote the following, in part, from his report: Excerpt from: The White Sands Proving Ground UFO Incidents of 1947 by Tim Cooper \"Military Pilot Reports - 1941 to 1946 To put things into perspective, it is necessary to review some of the verified UFO reports from the newspaper accounts and official USAAF records. Much of the Army and Navy intelligence UFO reports covering the Pacific, Southeast Asia and European Theaters of War are still classified to this day. Only a few reports have emerged through the Freedom of Information Act. As a result of the Japanese Naval air attack on the U. S. naval base at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, invasion fears were at a fever pitch. The first fly-over of unidentified aircraft occurred at 1800 hours, December 8, 1941. Army radar operators detected 50 aircraft 100 miles east of San Francisco. The alert was given and a blackout issued. The 50 unidentified aircraft broke formation and became two flights. One entered the Bay Area and the other proceeded in a southwesterly course. The next night San Francisco came under two more air alerts. The first alarm occurred at 0145 hours, and the second again at 0202 hours. A blackout was ordered and fighter aircraft were on standby to intercept. It is reported that engine noises could be heard in the Bay area, but no bombs were dropped. Another alert was sounded at 0405 hours, but as before, no bombs were dropped and no fighters were sent up to intercept the unidentified aircraft. Lt. General John L. DeWitt was convinced that California was being invaded by a Japanese aircraft carrier task force, which was never located. Early on the morning of February 25, 1942, people of Los Angeles and surrounding communities were awakened by the thuds of anti-aircraft fire. For eleven weeks, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland, Seattle and other west coast cities had been on alert. Radar"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"stations reported unidentified aircraft and nightly blackouts were ordered from the San Joaquin Valley to the Mexican border. Newspapers reported in banner headlines about the 'Air Raid' that had taken place over Los Angeles. There was, however, no air raid. What had happened on that February morning was a by-product of the fear and hysteria that gripped many parts of the country in the early months of World War II. Radar personnel thought they had detected enemy planes. Anti-aircraft gun crews, who shot more than 1,400 rounds into the night sky, thought they saw and heard targets in the intersecting searchlights. Fighter aircraft of the 4th Interceptor Command had fighter pilots on hold as their engines were overheating while awaiting permission to take off and attack the unidentified. No such order was ever given that night, which no doubt left many military and civilian observers on the ground wondering what radar had picked up (radar was a top secret device developed just before the war) and what the AAA batteries were firing at. From approximately 0245 to 0720 hours, a blackout existed over Southern California. There were several questions left unanswered. A declassified secret memorandum released in 1974 through the Freedom of Information Act, provides some clues as to why the air raid over Los Angeles has remained a mystery to this day. The memorandum was written by General George C. Marshall, Chief of Staff, U. S. Army, to President Franklin Roosevelt, dated 26 February 1942. In part it reads: \" The following is the information we have from GHQ at this moment regarding the air alarm over Los Angeles of yesterday morning: Unidentified airplanes, other than American Army or Navy planes, were probably over Los Angeles, and were fired on by elements of the 37th CA Brigade (AA) between 3:12 and 4:15 a.m. These units expended 1,430 rounds of ammunition. As many as fifteen airplanes may have been involved, flying at various speeds from what is officially reported as being 'very slow' to as much as 200 mph and at elevations from 9,000 to 18,000 feet.\" It is obvious from this 'officially reported' tracking of fifteen aircraft 'flying at various speeds' and 'elevations,' that distance and height radar were accurate enough to convince the War Department that formations at various altitudes were operating over Los Angeles. The most interesting disclosure suggested that Army G-2 knew more than they were willing to admit by saying: Investigation continuing. It seems reasonable to conclude that if unidentified airplanes were involved, they may have been agents for purposes of spreading alarm. Such conclusion is supported by varying speed of operation and the fact that no bombs were dropped. The embarrassed military kept a tight-lip on this event and refused to offer any detailed explanation to the confused public as expressed in such statements from Frank Knox, Secretary of the Navy, who said, 'as far as I know, the whole raid was a false alarm and could be attributed to jittery nerves,' or Henry Stimson, Secretary of War, who stuck to the official report issued by General Marshall, that the raid"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"was caused by fifteen planes - from somewhere. It has been suggested that what was seen by the AAA batteries were flares or balloons, but in any case the radar operators and gun crews had locked onto something flying slowly over Los Angeles and surrounding cities. A photographer from the Los Angeles Evening Herald Examiner had photographed something in the intersecting searchlights which caused a considerable targeting effort by the AAA batteries. From several eyewitness accounts, it was metallic and was hit repeatedly, and yet no debris or crash was ever recovered. There were other such 'attacks' on the West Coast and mainland of the United States and Canada. When the 'airplanes' flew over the cities and rural areas, no anti-aircraft fire greeted them. Nor did newspapers report the 'bombings.' The air raids of North America was, in fact, one of the best-kept secrets of World War II. Obviously, the U. S. military intelligence did not want news of this to get out in the press for fear that enemy intelligence agents would pick this up and use it for propaganda and possible targeting for any sabotage operations being planned. The Formation Sightings Unidentified formations of 'silvery aircraft' were reported by military ground forces in the Pacific island campaigns. One comes from a Marine Sergeant Stephen J. Brickner, 1st Paratroop Brigade, 1st Marine Division, USMC, on Tulagi Island, the Solomon Islands, Guadalcanal Campaign. According to Brickner, on the morning of 12 August 1942, ' ...the air raid warning so unded. There had been no 'Condition Red' ...I was puzzled by the sound. It was a mighty roar that seemed to echo in the heavens. It didn't sound at all like the high-pitched 'sewing machine' (Charlie) drone of Jap formations ... the formation was huge; I would say over 150 objects were in it. (According to retired Brigadier General Edwin H. Simmons, USMC, the Japanese did try to attack Tulagi Island by air, but did not get underway until 17 August 1942. The only air raids by the Japanese on Tulagi, occurred on 21 August and 26 August, and was met by VMF-223. Any reference to the 12 August air raid does not appear in any official Marine Corps historical records.) Instead of the usual tight 'V' of 25 planes, this formation was in straight lines of 10 or 12 objects ... A few things puzzled me; I couldn't seem to make out any wings or tails. They seemed to wobble slightly and every time they wobbled, they would shimmer brightly from the sun. Their color was like highly polished silver. No bombs were dr opped ...' Mission 115 In a secret message sent by Major Ryan to all formation leaders of Mission 115, a brief but direct operations order was read. It stated: 'THIS AIR OPERATION TODAY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT AIR OPERATION YET CONDUCTED IN THIS WAR. THE TARGET MUST BE DESTROYED. IT IS OF VITAL IMPORTANCE TO THE ENEMY. YOUR FRIENDS AND COMRADES THAT HAVE BEEN LOST AND THAT WILL BE LOST TODAY ARE DEPENDING ON YOU. THEIR SACRIFICE MUST NOT BE IN VAIN. GOOD LUCK. GOOD SHOOTING, AND GOOD BOMBING. ANDERSON. COMBOMDIV ONE.' "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" It was October 14, 1943. It was one of the largest aerial fleets ever assembled. It was also destined to be one of the strangest encounters of UFOs experienced by Air Force pilots and crews. The details of the famous Schweinfurt raid are documented by the British Royal Air Force and the Headquarters Eighth Bomber Command, United States Strategic Bombing Survey, and the Army Air Force Bombing Mission Reports. Mission 115 comprised of two hundred fifty-seven B-17 Flying Fortresses. The late Colonel Budd J. Peaslee, was the air commander of Mission 115. Martin Caidin interviewed Colonel Peaslee just before his death. Colonel Peaslee told Caidin that as the B-17 formations made their bomb run, 'something strange' was encountered in the skies over Schweinfurt, Germany, on that October day in 1943. The attack formations are at 20,000 feet with fighter escorts. The bombardiers are instructed to carry Polaroid lenses and filters for their bombsights because a slight haze is anticipated over Schweinfurt. Colonel Peaslee is designated 1st ATF Air Commander. During the German fighter attacks and exploding AAA fire, the crews of the B-17 formations observe another element in the sky. Small formations of unknown objects were descending upon the bomber formations. They were not aircraft, or flak bursts, or falling bombs, or fighters, or debris of destroyed aircraft, or parachutes, or falling bodies. It is recorded by the historical files 'as one of the most baffling incidents of World War II, and an enigma that to this day defies all explanation.' According to a recently declassified teletype report to the Headquarters, 1st Bombardment Division, the strange 'formations' were described. 'NEAR THE TARGET A CLUSTER OF DISCS WERE OBSERVED IN THE PATH OF THE FORMATION. NO E/A ABOVE. DISCS WERE SILVER COLOR. SEEMED ABOUT 1\" THICK AND 3\" IN DIAMETER. WERE GLIDING SLOWLY DOWN IN VERY UNIFORM CLUSTER. A/C 026 WAS UNABLE TO AVOID DISCS AND RIGHT WING WENT DIRECTLY THROUGH A CLUSTER WITH ABSOLUTELY NO EFFECT ON ENGINES OR PLANE SURFACE. ABOUT 20 FEET FROM THESE DISCS NOTICED MASS OF BLACK DEBRIS OF VARYING SIZES IN CLUSTER 3 X 4 FEET. OBSERVED TWO OTHER A/C FLYING THROUGH SILVER DISCS WITH NO APPARENT DAMAGE. OBSERVED DISCS AND DEBRIS 2 OTHER TIMES BUT COULD NOT DETERMINE WHERE IT CAME FROM.' The interrogation of the bomber crews was intense concerning the descriptions given of the 'silver discs.' Every man gave the same account and did not deviate, 'at the time there were no enemy aircraft above.' This is confirmed in a secret memorandum dated 24 October 1943, from Major E.R.T. Holmes, F.L.O., of the 1st Bombardment Division to Colonel E. W. Thompson, A-2 Pinetree. The interrogation and debriefing was classified SECRET/EYES ONLY. According to the Group Leader's Report of Mission 115 flown on 14 October, 1943, there was nothing to indicate there was any confusion by the crews of enemy air attack or weather conditions that could explain the sightings of the 'discs.' Major W. E. Dolan reported: '...we were attacked by approx imately 200 E/A, consisting of ME 109s, ME 210s, FW 190s, JU 88s, and ME 110s. ...The"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"weather over the target was clear with a slight haze and a good bomb run was made.' It should be noted that the 'discs' approached the B-17 formations from above and that no enemy aircraft were observed at that time. All enemy aircraft were below the formations.The size of the discs, from the observer's vantage point, were quite large, given the distances involved. Also, the fact that the 'cluster' was 'gliding slowly' downward in 'very uniform cluster' suggest that some intelligence was in control. Also, the mention of 'black debris of varying sizes' were also observed within the cluster. No engine failures or surface damage was the most puzzling of the encounter. The sightings so unnerved the Army Air Force intelligence officers that a special intelligence operation began that same month. A classified project was undertaken in England with the cooperation of the SIS and OSS. The project was called the 'Massey Project,' its objective was to determine the source of the 'silver discs' and prove or disprove its Nazi German origin. The project began in October 1943 after the Schweinfurt raid and allegedly after a 'disc' had crashed in northern England near Scotland. To be continued in Part 3.
