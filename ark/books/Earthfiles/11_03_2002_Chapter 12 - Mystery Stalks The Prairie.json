Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Mystery Stalks The Prairie © 1976 by Roberta Donovan and Keith Wolverton Chapter 12 False Story Fools Public hroughout the entire investigation, Cascade County deputies have meticulously sought to obtain the most accurate and factual information available. This has not always been easy, as memory plays tricks on people who are frightened or excited. And people find it difficult, sometimes, to describe something few others have ever seen. Despite these obvious problems, officers have done everything possible to substantiate reports. They visited the scene of mutilations and sightings and searched for every shred of evidence. In some cases, they have questioned others living in the area. They also administered lie detector tests. At times, the officers personally knew the witness and could vouch for his reliability. And occasionally it was that sixth sense experienced lawmen seem to develop that helps them know when someone is telling the truth. It isn't always easy to spot a phony, but if anyone can weed them out, it often is a law officer. However, there is at least one classic example of a man who told such a convincing (but untrue) story that he fooled not only officers but other people, including a writer whose story, based on the man's information, was published in a national magazine. The writer, who wrote the story under a pen name, later told Captain Wolverton that he did not know at the time that the information was false and he now regrets writing the story. The information for the story originated with a man (referred to in chapter three) who was a long term inmate in a Midwest federal penitentiary. It is not certain where he obtained his so-called \"information,\" but the best guess is through the prison grapevine. His story had just enough accurate information in it, including names of individuals, to give it credibility. According to the convict's story, the cattle mutilations were the work of a cult headed by a man in Texas. The man he named does exist, but extensive checking failed to link him to anything out of the ordinary. Cattle mutilations were only the beginning, the convict said. He claimed that the mutilation of humans was next and had already started. He said that four people had been mutilated at Lake Kozad, Nebraska. Captain Wolverton contacted the sheriff there, who told him that no bodies had been found and there were no reports of missing people in that area. It was the sheriff's opinion that the entire story was false. Cultists were doing the cattle mutilations, the convict said, to see if they could get away with it. If not detected, they planned to start on humans next, including a number of prominent people in the political field, news media and Hollywood "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"actors. He had what he claimed was a list of 35 people who were to be killed, including some from Montana. Captain Wolverton and Deputy Arne Sand, a polygraph examiner, made a trip to the prison to interview the convict. Deputy Sand administered a polygraph test to the man and he failed almost every question, including very simple ones. Checks made later on different aspects of his story all proved his tale false and none of the predictions the convict made have come true. It was the officers' opinion after talking with the prisoner and checking his story that the whole thing was part of the convict's plan to obtain a release from prison or a transfer to a prison with less security. In the meantime, the story caused considerable harm, as it had been reported by a number of newspapers as factual, including at least one newspaper in the north-central Montana area. Officers were concerned that the story would cause undue apprehension and even panic. One curious aspect of the situation in Montana and other states is that the federal government does not seem to be doing any investigating of cattle mutilations. Or if it is, it is not sharing its information with local officials. At one time during the investigation, Captain Wolverton received a phone call from a Department of Agriculture official in Washington, D. C., inquiring about cattle mutilations in Montana. He indicated in his conversation that he was very interested and said he would fly to Great Falls the following week to confer with the Cascade County Sheriff's Department on the incidents. Captain Wolverton and Deputy Anderson worked frantically to assemble copies of all of their reports and photographs for the man. He never arrived, nor was there any further communication from him. The absence of any federal investigation into something so important to the safety and welfare of the American public has made law officers wonder whether or not someone in high circles knows what is behind the mutilations, UFOs, and other mysteries, but is not disclosing this information. \" Call it a gut feeling,\" Captain Wolverton said, \" but I have a notion somebody knows what is going on.\" The theory is only a wild guess, but it could explain why official Washington seems to be ignoring the entire situation. If the federal government is ignoring the situation, some private organizations of national scope certainly are not. One in Pennsylvania has investigated several hundred incidents in that state and a spokesman for the group told Captain Wolverton over the telephone that \"there is no doubt the things are for real.\" He added that UFO sightings have been reported in many places in the world and have increased in recent months. He also ventured a guess that there was a link between the cattle mutilations and the strange hairy creatures that have been seen in several states. The reports of hairy creatures received in that area, the spokesman said, have come from responsible people, some of whom were not well educated and live in back country where they would not have read newspaper accounts of similar incidents. Montana Rancher Shoots At Bigfoot Creature That Disappeared in \"Flash of Light\" One man reported shooting one of the \"creatures\" from six feet with a double- barreled shotgun. He reported that it \" disappeared in a flash of light.\" In some instances the strange creatures have been seen carrying small animals in their arms and some have been seen in the same vicinity and at the same time as UFOs. The creatures have been seen in populated, as well as wooded areas, although they seem to prefer the latter. Some have been described as having"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"glowing eyes\" and people have reported that the creatures had a pungent odor resembling rotten eggs. Some have been seen swimming in water. As in Montana cases, the man said otherwise aggressive dogs seem immobilized with fear and fail to bark at the creatures. One theory being studied by those at the Pennsylvania center is that the creatures may be a psychic phenomena, visible to some and not to others and possibly non-physical. This could at least explain why some people describe the creatures as transparent, report that bullets do not stop them and tell of the creatures disappearing before their eyes. Another organization, which is doing extensive research into the strange creatures, operates out of New Jersey. A man formerly affiliated with it in that state is now a deputy sheriff in southwestern Montana and is coordinating Montana's investigation with that in New Jersey. He told Captain Wolverton that in one recent month, a total of 244 substantiated reports of UFOs were received in one county in Pennsylvania. That area has been plagued for three years, he said, by numerous reports of UFO sightings, followed by cattle mutilations and then sightings of the hairy creatures. Comparing reports from various parts of the country, it is discovered that the \"creatures\" vary in appearance, but all have some similarities. They are reported to have anywhere from three to five toes. In some areas, they have canine-type fangs and the estimate of their size has varied. A man with a research society in Michigan said, in a telephone conversation with Captain Wolverton, he once shot a \"creature,\" which screamed and then disappeared into a swamp. He said the track it left was five-toed and measured 15 inches long and ten inches wide. The impression in the ground was one and a half inches deep. The New Jersey organization is now using computers to study the information assembled thus far on UFOs, hairy creatures and mutilations. One conclusion reached is that the incidents seem to happen mainly on hot, humid days in that area. In any case, the incidents are taken seriously by those investigating them and every effort is being made to solve the mystery. However, in all the checking that Captain Wolverton and the Cascade County deputies have accomplished here and elsewhere, there have been absolutely no reports of any human being having been harmed by the Bigfoot \"creatures.\" To be continued in Chapter 13 - UFO Reported in 1897 Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
