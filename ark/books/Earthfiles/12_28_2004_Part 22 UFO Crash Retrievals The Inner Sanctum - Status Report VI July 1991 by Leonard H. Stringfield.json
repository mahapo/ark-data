Carp, Ontario, Canada, southwest of Ottawa, where allegedly a non-terrestrial aerial craft, containing humanoid reptilian entities, \"crashed\" on November 4, 1989. Alleged video frame of unidentified aerial craft which allegedly landed - or crashed? - at Carp, Ontario, Canada, on November 4, 1989. Leonard Stringfield: \" THE CARP, CANADA UFO CRASH CASE: A SIDESHOW ATTRACTION? If there are questions about the Kalahari Desert crash, there are even more about a reported crash in the town of Carp, near Ottawa, on November 4 , 1989. Based on an on-going cooperative investigation by two qualified Canadian research organizations, the four-page report - which describes the usual scenario of crash/retrieval events - seems to be baseless; in short, probably a hoax. The reason behind its perpetration is anybody's guess. Although the report reads like a creation of an impish mind, I cannot discount the possibility that it was an orchestrated disinformation ploy designed to 'muddy the waters' during the time when the Kalahari incident was making big UFOlogical news. Hypothetically, if something of significance did crash in the African desert, the release of a faked case like Carp - depending upon its exposure as such - might serve as a diversionary contaminant. Whatever the ulterior purpose, the Carp report composed of two pages of text and "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"two with poorly depicted photos showing a map and a hardly visible 'alien,' got attention among worldwide researchers. Walt Andrus of MUFON sent me a copy, his source unknown. Following is a verbatim copy of the Carp report, minus the attachments, which are too murky for reproduction. Anonymous Carp Report: 'Canadian and American Security Agencies are engaged in a conspiracy of silence to withhold from the world the alien vessel seized in the swamps of Corkery Road, Carp, in 1989. UFO sightings in the Ontario region had intensified in the 1980s, specifically around nuclear power generating stations. On November 4, 1989, at 20:00 hours, Canadian Defense Department radars picked up a globe-shaped object traveling at a phenomenal speed over Carp, Ontario. The UFO abruptly stopped and dropped like a stone. Canadian and American Security Agencies were immediately notified of the landing. Monitoring satellites traced the movements of the aliens to a triangular area off Old Almonte and Corkery Roads. The ship had landed in deep swamp near Corkery Road. Two AH-64 Apaches and a UH-60 Blackhawk headed for the area the following night. The helicopters carried full weapon loads. They were part of a covert American unit that specialized in the recovery of alien craft. Flying low over Ontario pine trees, the Apache attack choppers soon spotted a glowing, blue, 20-metre-in-diameter sphere. As targeting lasers locked on, both gunships unleashed their full weapon loads of eight missiles each. All sixteen were exploded in proximity bursts ten metres downwind from the ship. The missiles were carrying VEXXON, a deadly neuroactive gas which kills on contact. Exposed to air, the gas breaks down quickly into inert components. Immediately after having completed their mission, the gunships turned around and headed back across the border. Now the Blackhawk landed, as men exploded from its open doors. In seconds, the six-man strike team had entered the UFO through a seven metre hatchless, oval, portal. No resistance was encountered. At the controls, three dead crewmen were found. With the ship captured, the United States Air Force, Pentagon and Office of Naval Intelligence were notified. Through the night, a special team of technicians had shut down and disassembled the sphere. Early the next morning, November 6, 1989, construction equipment and trucks were brought into the swamp. The UFO parts were transported to a secret facility in Kanata, Ontario. As a cover story, the locals were informed that a road was being built through the swamp. No smokescreen was needed for the military activity as Canadian forces regularly train in the Carp region. Officially, nothing unusual was reported in the area. Although someone anonymously turned in a 35mm roll of film. It was received by the National Research Council of Canada, in Ottawa. The film contained several clear shots of an entity holding a light. At this time, the photographer is still unidentified. The humanoids were packed in ice and sent to an isolation chamber at the University of Ottawa. CIA physiologists performed the autopsies. The three reptilian, fetus-headed beings, were listed as CLASS 1 NTE's (Non-Terrestrial Entities). Like others recovered in previous operations, they were muscular, grey-white skinned humanoids. The ship was partially reassembled at the underground facility in Kanata. Unlike previous recoveries, this one is pure military. Built as a 'Starfighter,' it is heavily armed and armored. In design, no rivets, bolts, or welds were used in fastening, yet when reconstructed there are no seams. The UFO itself is made up of a matrixed dielectric magnesium alloy. It is driven by pulsed electromagnetic fields generated by a cold fusion reactor. All offensive capab ilities utilize independently targeting, electronic beam weapons. In the cargo hold were found ordnance racks containing fifty"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Soviet nuclear warheads. Their purpose was revealed by advanced tactical/combat computers located in the flight deck. Threatened by recent East-West relations and the revolutionary movements within itself, Red China is preparing for the final ideological war. The aliens have agreed to defend China from the free world's combined military and nuclear forces. At this time, China is arming the Middle East with their own nuclear arsenals in order that they can successfully take on Israel. Unifying the Arabs under one Chinese command was simple, especially with Israel's recent 'Iron Fist' attitude towards the occupied Arab territories. The Soviet warheads found in the UFO were destined for Syria. CIA-operatives in the Middle East have noticed huge movements of Chinese 'technicians' and 'advisers.' China is also supplying the Arabs with bacteriological agents, Migs, Hind gunships, tanks, and missile launchers. The use of 'Soviet' instead of 'Chinese' nukes is part of a disinformation campaign to break up East-West relations after the annihilation of Israel. The warheads were hijacked from Soviet submarines in the Dragon's Triangle, a section of alien-controlled Pacific once frequented by Russian subs. After losing some 900 high yield warheads and thirteen vessels, commanders were ordered to steer clear of the area. The most important alien-technology find were the two millimetre, spheroid, brain implants. Surgically inserted through the nasal orifice, the individual can be fully monitored and controlled. The CIA and Canadian Government have actively supported mind-slave experiments for years. Currently, the University of Ottawa is involved in Extremely Low Frequency (ELF) wave mind control programs, a continuation of the CIA psychological warfare project known as MKULTRA, started at the Allen Memorial Institute in Montreal (Editor's Note: Allegedly a CIA-linked medical institute in Canada). Using ELF signals transmitted at the same wavelength the human brain uses, the researchers could subliminally control the test project. The alien implants utilize the same principles, except that the whole unit is subminiaturized and contained in the brain. Fortunately, the implants can be detected by magnetic resolution scanning technology. All individuals implanted by the aliens are classified as ZOMBIES. The ZOMBIES have been programmed to help overthrow Mankind in the near future. When China finishes with Israel, it will invade Europe. At the same time, Chinese space-based bacteriological weapons will be launched at the Artic (sic). The winds will carry the diseases into Russia and North America. In days, hundreds of millions will be dead; the survivors will have to deal with the Chinese, the aliens and the ZOMBIES. The aliens want an all-out war so that human resistance would be minimal when they invade. They tried this same tactic once before with Nazi Germany. Most of the scientific advances we have today came from German science which was based on alien technology. Had Hitler won the war, the Earth would have become a concentration camp in order to depopulate the continents for the aliens. Data aboard the sphere explained why the aliens are so comfortable on our world. They preceded man on the evolutionary scale by millions of years; (they) created the dinosaurs. Some 65 million years ago, an interdimensional war destroyed most of their civilization and forced them to leave the Earth. Now, they have chosen to reclaim what was once theirs. The alien forces with their Chinese and Arab allies will attack within the next five years. Waiting longer than that would make it impossible, even for the aliens, to reverse the ecological damage inflicted on the Earth by Man.' Leonard Stringfield: \"The first evaluation of the crash, after a preliminary investigation, came from Clive Nadin of the Ottawa Centre of UFO Studies, dated July 17, 1990. The report in part follows: "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Clive Nadin, Ottawa Centre of UFO Studies, J uly 17, 1990: 'In February of this year, a number of Canadian UFO investigators/researchers received a two-page letter from an anonymous source, along with two photocopies of an aerial photograph and an alleged photograph of an alien entity, copies of which are enclosed with this letter. It is worth noting that only a few investigators in Ontario and Quebec Provinces received copies of this letter from the author. No researchers further West received a copy, and I believe the copy that Stanton Friedman received came from a copy made from an original. From reading the letter, it is obvious that the author has many biases, and there are hints of anti-Semitism. It appears as a very poor hoax from first inspection. However, from onsite investigations by myself and Ron Graham, three persons have been found near the location given on the aerial shot, that have reported strange lights seen during a weekend in November. In addition, these persons reported strange helicopter activity over this area either prior to, or just after, this light was seen. The light was seen at 2000 hrs. one evening early in November (the date has not been confirmed as the 4th or 5th of November at this time), and the helicopters were seen at a time of 1700 to 1800 hrs., either before the light was seen, or the following day (this is still uncertain). The helicopters (up to six in number) were described as 'twin-rotor' type. There are seven CH-47C Boeing-Vertol Chinooks currently in service with the Canadian Armed Forces, located in two bases in Canada - Ottawa and Edmonton. Ottawa is located a short flight distance from the 'crash' site. Chinooks frequently fly over this area as the Boeing maintenance facility is located West from Carp at Arnprior. The only other twin-rotored helicopter flown by the Canadian Forces is the CH-46 Sea Knight, which is used for SAR duties at bases on the East and West Canadian coasts; and I believe, they are all yellow in color. An inspection of the area on foot did not locate any evidence of heavy equipment having been moved into this area, and discreet inquiries of locals confirmed this. Inquiries with the Canadian Department of National Defense (DND) has, so far, been unsuccessful, with my initial letter missing, and my second unanswered. No doubt, someone will suggest that this is indicative of a cover-up, but I'm sure that it is just due to incompetence on the part of the DND. This investigation is on-going, and I hope to uncover further witnesses in the near future. I consider the likelihood of a crash/retrieval somewhat remote, but there are still a number of puzzling questions unanswered. What I am concentrating on at the moment are these reports of helicopters in the area around the time the light was seen.' Leonard Stringfield: \"Having heard nothing further from Nadin, I contacted researcher, Christian Page, President, O.C.I.P.E. (Organization de Compiliation (sic) et D'Information Sur Les Phenomenes Estranges) in Quebec, Canada. I quote from his letter, May 30, 1991, as follows: Christian Page, O.C.I.P.E., May 30, 1991: 'On February 12, 1990, an anonymous letter was received at the address of the Centrale Ufologique de Quebec, a late UFOlogical association, of which I was a member. Beside a mistake in the spelling, which should read 'du Quebec' instead of 'de Quebec,' proves that the author of the document had a poor knowledge of the French language. Be that as it may, I was suspicious of the blurred pictures. I immediately informed a colleague, Chris Rutkowski, who - with the collaboration of Clive Nadin - was able to underline some irregularities in the Carp document. Following is an extract from the Swamp Gas Journal (Vol. 5, No. 1, April 1990), a newsletter published by the Canadian group, UFO Research of Manitoba, directed by Rutkowski. Swamp Gas Journal, Vol. 5, No. 1, April 1990: 'The crash was alleged to have occurred just outside of Ottawa near the town of Carp. The crash supposedly took place on November 4, 1989, shortly after 8:00 PM (Ottawa time). The first indication that something is amiss is the comment that: 'Early the next morning, November 6 ...' Already there is"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"some confusion about the date. Although it is said that a cover story about construction in the area was the reason for the heavy equipment, at least some inquiries of the local townspeople revealed that no one had heard of any construction there at all. 'The writer is also obviously Canadian. He or she knows the area well enough to describe the Corkery Road swamp and pinpoint it on a map. The writer also knows about the 'underground facility' at Kanata, just close by which is basically a nuclear fallout bunker for politicians and military personnel. The word 'metre' is spelled in the Canadian format, unlike the American 'meter.' The University of Ottawa is identified as a facility where clandestine CIA mind control experiments had been done in the past and which an official inquiry has determined did take place. 'The mystery writer also knows a fair bit about military weaponry, noting things like AH-64 Apache and UH-60 Blackhawks. Along the way, the writer mentions Berlitz's latest book, Dragon's Triangle (Editor's Note: Copyright 1989 by Charles Berlitz), alien brain implants and photographs in the possession of the NRC (National Research Council). At least one mistake in the text can be found: the writer interprets the process as 'magnetic resolution scanning,' instead of 'magnetic resonance scanning,' and this suggests that the writer just threw together these concepts to make it look like he or she was fully informed. 'The sections in the text which talk about China and the Middle East clearly show the writer's preoccupation with anti-Semitism and a variety of other biases. Continued references to Hitler and Naziism imply a Harbinson-like scenario, yet are mixed with other absurd ideas to make even this seem logical. There are several incomplete sentences and examples of bad structure in grammar and punctuation. 'The identity of the writer is still a mystery, although some UFOlogists may have their suspicions. Why the letter was written and sent in the first place is anybody's guess, although since it comes at a time when a number of other crash stories are circulating, this is not altogether unexpected. 'Investigations by Arthur Bray and others in the Ottawa area have found some witnesses who recalled seeing 'mystery helicopters' (twin rotor), flying and hovering over the exact spot mentioned in the letter. Clive Nadin has scouted the area and found no signs of heavy construction work, nor do residents of the area recall any such activity. 'An interesting further complication is the fact that there actually was a UFO report in NRC files from Carp in 1989. It came from a woman who was driving with her son along a road in the area when a brightly- lighted UFO flew over them and shone a light on them, causing 'radiation burns' on her son's arm. Unfortunately, the NRC person who took the call did not get enough information from the caller and attempts to check the story have been fruitless.' ontinued in Part 23 - Large Aerial Triangles Over Moriches Bay Before Alleged 'UFO Retrieval' Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
