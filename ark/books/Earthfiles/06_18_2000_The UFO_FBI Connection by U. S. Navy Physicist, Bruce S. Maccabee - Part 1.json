Maccabee with permission. June 18, 2000 Sabillasville, Maryland - U. S. Navy Research Physicist Bruce Maccabee is the author of a new and important book released May 1, 2000 entitled The UFO/FBI Connection, The Secret History of the Government's Cover-Up . He told me this week, \"We're learning more about what happened years ago then they knew years ago. And this book could not have been written twenty years ago or ten years ago because it involves information that has only been recently released.\" Bruce Maccabee received his Bachelors of Science degree in Physics from "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1964. Three years later in 1967, he added a Mast ers of Science degree in Physics from American University (AU) in Washington, D. C. Then he earned his Ph.D. in Physics from AU in 1970. He worked as a post-graduate student in AU's Physics Department until he was hired by the U. S. Department of Navy to be a physics researcher at what was then called the Naval Ordnance Laboratory (NOL). That name was later changed to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD) where Dr. Maccabee has worked ever sin ce. NSWC used to be closer to the nation's capitol, but in recent years has moved a bout seventy miles southeast to Dahlgren, Virginia. Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist, U. S. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Virginia, speaking at a recent conference. Photo provided by Bruce Maccabee. In this Part I of a five part series, I ta lk with him about his physics work for the Navy from 1972 to the present and whether any official work involved the unidentified flying object mystery. Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist, Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC), Dahlgren, Virginia: \"When I first started working for NSWC, I was doing rapid processing of acoustic data by optical means. By the way, Naval Ordnance Laboratory was changed to Naval Surface Weapons Center and then to the Naval Surface Warf are Center. They were all in the same building. WOULD YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF RAPID PROCESSING OF ACOUSTICAL DATA BY OPTICAL MEANS? Acoustical data specifically were tape recording of underwater sounds obtained from the so-called SOSUS Arrays that were in the ocean listening for submarines and listening, of course, to other ships. Back in those days, people"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"sat there with earphones on and listened to these tapes being played. The best they could do was about twice normal speed. And you have to understand, there were dozens of tapes made every day from various places and (intelligence) was supposed to digest all this informati on and pick out which sound was like a submarine and which sounded like a Soviet trawler as opposed to anything else that might be making noises in the oceans. And apparently the guys got very accustomed to doing that, but it was very slow. So, I was asked to see if I could come up with a speeded up method to do it and I made use of a method whereby the acoustical signals could be converted into an optical signal. You can see a lot fast er than you can hear. So, the idea was to try to paint a picture of the sound and to run this at maybe ten times normal time. I succeeded in doing something like that, but then the funding was cut. And subsequently, monster computer stuff became available. Back in 1972, computers were few and far between. But over the next few years, they began to analyze these tapes by computer techniques which were faster than human beings. So, they didn't need my method. BUT THE CONTEXT IS IN A GOVERNMENT OPERATION LOOKING FOR WHAT WAS UNDER THE OCEANS IN TERMS OF POSSIBLE ENEMY THAT THIS IS WHERE YOU GOT YOUR START IN OPTICAL ANALYSES? Right. Specifically for the super-scientist in the reading and listening audience, listening to an acoustic sound, you hear the frequencies that are characteristic of whatever the sound generator is. In this case, it would be like engine noise, 100 Hertz or something like that. These noises would be very faint generally and would be competing with all sorts of noises, such as biologically created noises in the ocean. So, the attempt was to do what we call a Fourier transform and look at the frequency spectrum of the total noises coming out and pick out continuous engine-generated sounds by its frequencies. And it was possible to convert this spectrum to an optical picture, in effect, a picture of the spectrum and sit there and play this optical analog of the sound and see the spectrum go by you ten times faster than you could hear it. AFTER THAT FUNDING WAS CUT, WHAT WAS THE NEXT STEP IN YOUR WORK? High Energy Laser Research Then, I went into the generation of und erwater sound using lasers. I started that in 1973 or 1974 and more or less cont inued that into the 1990s working on various aspects of that. I also got involved with the high energy laser program for the Navy in 1976, I believe it was, when I b ecame involved with a program that had to do with the creation and utilizati on of a big instrument to analyze the laser output of a laser that was generating hundreds of kilowatts of power. WHERE WAS THAT? It was west of West Palm Beach at a Pratt-Whitney installation. WHAT WAS ITS PURPOSE?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"That laser was a test laser. The purpose of most of these lasers is to learn the basic physics involved. Of course, the 3-Stars and 4-Stars up the chain of command had a twinkle in their eye that they could use these things to shoot down whatever. The laser that has a power level of hundreds of kilowatts presumably can be focused to a reasona bly small spot and burn a hole through almost anything. And so, the purpose of this laser was to do research, but the research was directed towards using lasers as weapons. As a result of my involvement in that program which was at the Pratt-Whitney facility at West Palm Beach, Florida, I became involved with a follow on high energy laser program that took place in California near San Juan Capistrano at the TRW test site there where they had a famous laser back in those days called a NACL, which happens to be the formul a for salt, but it stood for Navy ARPA Chemical Laser. ARPA was the Advanced Research Projects Administration that later became DARPA, Defense Advanced Research Projects Administration. Back in those days, it was ARPA. The Navy was big into high energy lasers in those days thinking they could use lasers to protect ships. The Navy was instrumental in building the world's largest laser called MIRACL, Mid Infra Red Chemical Laser. That laser was constructed and utilized first at the San Juan Capistrano test area which is actually like several miles east of San Clemente. You could actually see the flag pole on top of Nixon's compound. And there were a number of times that people thought about what the laser would do to the top of the flag pole! The first ever rocket devices, actually TOW missiles, that were shot down by a laser were shot down from the Capistrano test site in 1978 . During that testing period, I didn't happen to be there that specific day. I was trading off work with another guy and he was out there it happened. That laser now is at White Sands Missile Proving Ground in New Mexico. And I should point out, this is a Navy-funded project to create a laser. So, where do they create the laser? They put it where it's best likely to work wh ich is in DRY air. And so whenever the Navy decides to put lasers on ships of the desert, we will have it made. CAMELS OR OTHERWISE. Right. IN THIS EVOLUTION UP TO 1978, WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN 1978 AND 2000 IN YOUR CAREER? It's been a long and checkered career. After 1978, high energy lasers for me temporarily died and I went back to laser zapping, creating under water sounds. And we had some funded programs. WHEN YOU SAY CREATING UNDERWATER SOUNDS, DO YOU MEAN YOU WERE USING THE LASERS TO CREATE SOUNDS? Right. For example, the laser is in an airplane flying over the water. You focus a very sharp laser beam down onto the surface of the water. It's absorbed by the water and there is so much energy in the laser beam that the water literally explodes like you dropped a little explosion on the surface. The sound goes"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"down into the water and propagates some distance under water. Our experiments were directly designed to find out what was the best way to generate that sound and how far it would go. A Call from the CIA Oddly enough, it was in 1984, I got a ph one call from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Ron Pandolfi, asking me about the laser-generated sound. He was a scientist, graduated from Cal Tech, had been at the CIA for a couple of years and had noted there was a huge disparity between the amount of papers published on the subject in the United St ates compared to the number of papers in the Soviet Union. So, it looked to him like there was a laser-zapping gap. That is, it appeared to him that the Soviets knew more about creating underwater sound with lasers than we did. WHO WAS PUBLISHING THE MOST? The Soviets had us outnumbered two to th ree to one in terms of the number of papers on the subject of creation of under water sound with lasers. And Pandolfi knew from his intelligence experience, that what appeared in the open literature is only a fraction of what appears in the closed literature. So, he wanted to find out what we knew and some how determ ined that I and another guy at NSWC had the United States' main source of information on actual sound created under water and were the only people testing it out in the ocean. WHAT WOULD BE THE CONCERN TO THE CIA? Under water sound is always of a concern b ecause it can be used for various things like signaling and for under water detection. And in particular, we had proposed that if you had sono buoys, which are devices that detect sounds in the oceans, if you had a sono buoy array with several of them located a couple of miles apart. Then you fly over the area with a laser generating sound and you listen for any echoes. You can distinguish direct sound from an echo. And any echoes would be detecting something that was under there and you can imagine what we were trying to detect. It wasn't whales, it wasn't sharks. SOVIET SUBMARINES. Yes, and the nasty ones. So-called nukes, the 'boomers,' as they called them. So this was a potential method for ASW, Anti-Submarine Warfare. Nowadays, nobody cares. Soviet subs are sort of tu rning into piles of rust. I suppose the SOSUS array is still out there listening, but I don't know who is listening to the tapes. BUT BACK THEN IT WAS OF GREAT INTEREST TO THE NAVY AND CIA... Well, the Navy was interested because their job is to protect us from attack in the oceans and the CIA interest was that they wanted to make sure that we knew at least as much as the Soviets did, so they contacted us to find out what we knew."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THAT WAS 1984. That's significant from the UFO point of view simply because this is how I got connected with Pandolfi in the CIA. My first contact had nothing to do with UFOs. New Zealand UFO on December 31, 1978 However, part of my history is that at the end of December 1978 were the New Zealand sightings that I investigated as a private citizen in January 1979. And as part of my talking to a number of peopl e throughout the U. S. about the data I collected that I was invited to give a talk to the CIA. And at that point, I met a guy by the name of Kit Green, Christ opher Green, whose name has popped up over the years in Ufology. I went to the CIA once to give this long talk about the subject to see if they could help. And ma ybe twice more to talk with individuals to talk about radar and other aspects of that particular New Zealand sighting. That was in 1979.\" Background on the 1978-1979 New Zealand and Australia UFO Flaps Howe: Prior to New Year's Day 1979, a number of radar sightings had occurred for two weeks off the northeast coast of New Zealand's South Island. One of the first major radar/visual sightings began on December 21, 1978. At about 12:30 AM, air traffic controllers at Wellington Airport detected three unidentified targets on their radar screens. One object moving at high speed for sixty miles was estimated to be as large as a commercial airliner. Then it stopped and remained stationary. A pilot in the area was asked to look and reported at 1:20 AM, Captain Vern Powell radioed that he could see white lights similar to landing lights that appeared as targets on the airplane's weat her radar. Then a couple of hours later at 3:30 AM, the pilot radioed that a brig ht red light was visible. Wellington air traffic controllers confirmed that their radar showed a target about 23 miles to the right of Vern Powell's plane. Air control watched as the target paced Powell for about twelve miles. Then Powell reported that the red light had changed to white with a red ring around it. The light was extremely bright, so bright that Powell said when the object passed behi nd clouds he could still see its glow. By then, Wellington radar operators said they had five strong targets near the pilot as he approached Christchurch. Powell radioed that his weather radar showed a target approaching his plane at high speed, travelling fifteen miles in five seconds. Then the blip disappeared off his radar screen, but he could look out his window and see a flashing white light. Ten days later on December 30, 1978, Quentin Fogarty, a reporter for Australian Television Channel 0 and a cameraman were working on a news story about the UFO and radar sightings. It was 10:15 PM and the television crew was aboard an Argosy plane with Captain Bill Startup and copilot Robert Guard for the purpose of reconstructing Powell's flight. They were flying south of Wellington when the flight crew noticed unusual lights near the Kaikoura peninsula. After midnight on December 31, 1978, Wellington radar controllers confirmed they"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"were picking up strong unidentified returns in the area of the Argosy plane. During the next hour, the television team and the flight crew watched a spectacular and sometimes frightening display by the unidentified lights. Wellington radar said there as many as ten targets at a time and at least two. The passengers and crew were a bit worried because they were familiar with the October 21, 1978 disappearance only two months before of pilot Frederick Valentich who was flying between Tasmania and Australia in his small Cessna 182. The last words that Melbourne Flight Service Controllers heard from Valentich was, \"It has four bright lights that appear to be landing lights. Aircraft has just passed over me about 1,000 feet above.\" Controllers asked him to identify the object. Valentich said, \"It's .....\" Then there was silence. Two minutes later, Valentich's voice said, \"Melbourne, it's approaching from due east toward me. It seems to be playing some sort of game. Flying at a speed I cannot estimate. It is flying past. It is a long shape. I cannot identify more than that. Coming for me right now. It seems to be stationary. I'm orbiting and the thing is orbiting on top of me also. It has a green light and sort of metallic light on the outside.\" Then Valentich said his engine was choking up. What Melbourne Flight Controllers heard next was a metallic sound that J. Allen Hynek, who heard the audiotape, told me reminded him of \"tin cans rolling around in the bottom of an empty oil drum.\" Valentich never returned and is still classified as a genuinely mysterious missing person's case. Further information on the New Zealand radar-visual sightings can be found at the web site of the Journal of Scientific Exploration www.jse.com/article.html . Select the article entitled \"Atmosphere or UFOs: A Response to the 1997 Review Panel Report.\" The final two-thirds of that paper describe the analysis of the New Zealand radar sightings. Ron Pandolfi, CIA, Contacted Bruce M accabee Bruce Maccabee: \"When Pandolfi contacted me in 1984, I didn't say anything about the fact I had been in New Zeala nd on the UFO investigation in 1979. But the next time he called me up, he said , 'By the way, I understand you do some other research, too.' Or words to that effect. And he brought up the subject of UFOs because he had been asking around to people to see if they had heard of me. And somebody said something. Anyway, in March of 1983, President Ronald Reagan made his sp eech a bout an orbiting, protecting against nuclear strikes, that came to be called 'Star Wars.' The press disparaged the idea and sort of tried to make it look like Hollywood entertainment, but it wasn't. Special panels got together to try to figure out how they would put together what's called an architecture or structure of weapons that could actually handle the ballistic missile threat from the Soviet Union. In 1984, I was on a panel, a little group of people from the Naval Surface Warfare Center. We went traveling around to various military bases to find out what other people were doing about sp ace. What's the Navy got to do with space? It just so happened that the Navy was the biggest users of space assets."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"People wouldn't think of the Navy bein g interested in what happens up above the atmosphere, but the Navy had satellit es up. In fact, the first satellites up in the 1950s were sponsored by the Navy. A nd one reason was geodesy, to find out exactly how the earth is. The cryptic reas on for the interest in geodesy was that we had to be able to determine if a nuclear submarine was going to fire a missile, how in the world do you tell that missile where to go? It has to know exactly where it is on the earth to begin with. How much firing time and which certain direction to run its rockets? After it fire s, its rockets are gone. It's just a dumb thing coasting towards a target. So, you ha ve to get all this stuff correct and they had to find out exactly how the gravity varied around the surf ace of the earth, anything about actual dimensions of the earth and so on. Star Wars The Navy had a lot of satellites up there and they also had to have communication with ships. They used satellites for communication. And in 1984, we were trying to find out what other people were doing in sp ace, s hould the Naval Surface Warfare Center in part icular get involved. And that connected me up with the government's Star Wars architecture study, I guess you could call it. For a period of time, I was working on various aspects of Star Wars. Having been involved with that problem in 1985, that got me into another program in 1986 which was directly related to big lasers in sp ace. That program is continuing. UNDER WHAT NAME? First of all, under the Strategic Defense Initiative Office (SDIO), or Strategic Defense Initiative Organization which was the organization set up to develop the architecture of a weapons system that could handle a Soviet threat. This was no mean problem. The Soviet threat consisted of like 10,000 missiles that could all be launched at once. If they really wanted to wipe out the United States. And so this system was an attempt to shoot dow n all those missiles some how or other. It still hangs in there and you can still see the discussion in the papers even in the last few days as to whether or not Clinton is going to make a decision about continuing what is known as the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO). You can go to their web page and find out all the latest about shooting down missiles. But instead of trying to shoot down 10,000 missiles, we now have an architecture that can shoot down maybe ten missiles. A big difference. We might actually be able to DO that, assuming that Congress appropriates the money to put some satellites up there. IN ALL OF THIS, THERE HA S ALWAYS BEEN THE PARALLEL TRACK AND SUSPICION SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION AND THE DISCUSSION OF STAR WARS THAT IT NEVER HAD ANYTHING REALLY TO DO WITH THE SOVIET UNION, BUT THAT THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT A NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE INTERACTING WITH OUR PLANET. I can tell you from experience, and I would take lie detector tests on it and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"swear on a stack of Bibles, a discussion of anything other than Soviet attack never occurred during any of the talks, lectures, discussions, whatever that I participated in. (Howe's note: In my research, it became clear that \"Soviet Union\" was used as a code phrase to mean any foreign technology that could also include non-human advanced technology.) WAS EDWARD TELLER IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS? I don't think I was ever in the same r oom with him. I might have been back during the hay days of Star Wars in the 1986-1988 time frame. I went to a number of meetings, so he might have been in some room. But I never heard him speak and as I said, of all the people I did hear speak, including the guy who was in charge of the SDIO, General Abrahamson. None of those people gave any indication there was anything other than a Soviet threat. And when the details of the architectur e were discussed, always the threat discussed was missiles in terms of shooting down something on the order of 10,000 missiles. SS-18s, SS-16, SS-22, whatever numbers were attached to the different types of missiles, the whole different array that the Soviet Union had. They had long range, short range, intermediate range, missiles launched from submarines. That was always the threat discussed, missiles. And all of the satellites, there were a bunch of satellites supposedly up there that would be monitoring the earth. There ARE satellites up there monitoring the earth. All their sensors are directed towards the ea rth. None of the sensors are directed away. Astronomers and NASA have put up satellites with telescopes directed away from the earth, but I'm not aware of any military satellites that are looking away from the earth. They are looking towards the earth to detect nuclear missile launches or nuclear explosions, testing. HOW DID ALL OF THIS COME TO FOCUS ON THE UFO PHENOMENON? As I have said to many audiences, I happened to work for the Navy. My Navy work has nothing to do with UFOs whic h is true. I'm not saying that the Navy does not have any UFO information. In fact, I suspect they are not Mr. Clean. But nobody has told me about anything! Navy intelligence is in a completely different part of the organization. LET ME PUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR NEW BOOK, THE UFO FBI CONNECTION, AND YOUR FOCUS IS GOVERNMENT KNOWLEDGE IN CERTAIN AGENCIES. As you know, I've been interested in the subject since the late 1960s and have investigated a number of sightings and also have read a number of books, history and direct files out of Project Blue Book. YOUR INTEREST WAS NOT PROVOKED BY YOUR PROFESSIONAL WORK? IT WAS ALWAYS A PARALLEL TRACK OUT OF YOUR OWN CURIOSITY?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Right. I became interested in 1967 or 1968 while I was at American University. WHAT TOOK YOU TO NEW ZEALAND TO STUDY THE UFO INCIDENT THERE? It was a fortuitous circumstance that I had done some photographic analysis for NICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena). When the New Zealand movie was taken December 31, 1978 and was shown the next day on TV around the world. Even Walter Chronkite had it and he said at the end of his nightly news, 'And that's the way it is . Or is it?' That was the only time he ever added anything to his nightly news closing statement. The point is the TV station in Australia, the TV station that the reporter was an employee of, we were told was on board the plane when they had all these sightings. And they were accused of hoaxing this whole thing up to improve their ratings. It was called Channel Zero, or \"O\" in Melbourne, Australia, and they were accused of trying to bring their ratings from a zero. Their ratings matched their Channel Number, we were told. Anyway, they decided to have an investigator. They contacted a guy named Paul Norman. Paul used to live in the U. S. and was a member of NICAP. He moved into Australia back in the 1960s, I think. He recommended that they take the film to the United States to NICAP headquarters where they had the best analysts and equipment. I saw that film shown on TV and J. Allen Hynek was comme nting on it and I thought to myself, 'Well, somebody on the other side of the earth gets to look at that. I won't.' So I promptly forgot about it. But six days later I got a phone call from Jack Acuff who was the head of NICAP and he said , 'How would you like to see the New Zealand movie? They're bringing it here.' So maybe two weeks later I had it in my house. But how did I get down there? Well, after I did this preliminary investigation, the news team that brought that film was here in the U. S. for a week, maybe two weeks. And I told them that by that time I had talked to the captain and cameraman by phone and I told the Australian newsman who brought the film, 'This looks really weird. It could be a UFO. But I'm not going to say anything publicly until I actually get to carry out an investigation.' So, they paid for a trip and I went down to Australia and New Zealand. I was gone for two weeks in New Zealand and a week in Australia and when I came back to the U. S., I stopped to discuss the case with scientists on the west coast. Then I stopped in Chicago to tell Hynek what I had learned and finally I discussed the case with scientists in the Washington, D. C. area. This was all done while I was on leave from work. And there were some people who were interested after I came back. Some of the people in the Naval laser office where I worked knew I had taken this trip and asked me to tell them. In fact, I gave th em a little briefing on it, but nothing ever official involved. No money changed hands. There was no program set up. It was just a question of some guys who wanted to know what it was.\" Next: There really was an X-Files in the FBI, continued in Part 2 on June 19, 2000 ."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The UFO/FBI Connection by Bruce S.
