Return to Part 1 December 16, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - ***** Chapter 6 Biodegradable Alien Objects “It was possible that nothing ever left the ship,” one person on the committee offered that hypothesis one day as committee members pondered how the Alien craft kept track of all its cargo. During testing , the scientists buried Alien items hundreds of feet underground. The committee shot the Alien objects into space on a one-way trajectory toward Jupiter. The objects were encased in concrete, lead and steel. The scientists also sank the Alien objects into the deepest parts of the ocean. But still, each and every Alien item reappeared back on board the craft three days later. The items that were encased vanished from their tomb without a trace or hint that they were ever there. It was as if nothing had been encased at all. The "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Alien items did not displace the material covering them. No cavities were found. How was that possible? And of what godly material were the Alien items made from that they could not be scratched, dented or burned? Even attempts to flatten the items under thousands of pounds of pressure failed. The hydraulic presses were not damaged and the Alien material bounced back as if it were a “cartoon character!” Ceramic figurines or models were made of some of the Alien items. For the ones that continually changed shape and size, a history of the evolution was attempted. The task of making a genealogy of the items that constantly changed was very difficult, and in some cases, impossible. Apparently, some items are not “allowed” to be photographed or their likeness preserved in any manner. There was no way to infringe on their patent! Some Alien items never repeated the same shape twice. Others cycled through dozens of different shapes and repeated the pattern. If the items never left the ship, where did they go? When an Alien item was carried off the ship, it was a logical conclusion that it was no longer on the ship. But the committee knew there was nothing about the ship or its contents that was logical. Therefore, applying logic to find a solution to all the questions that any of them had was their biggest mistake. Alien Craft Control Panel On one of the panels on the craft - located in the area believed to be the control center - there are icons depicting everything that belongs to the Alien craft. The size of each icon is 1/2-inch square. The area that encompassed all of the icons was approximately 3 feet by 3 feet. There are 5,184 icons. When an Alien item transformed, the icon for that Alien object transformed at the exact same time. When an Alien object was taken off the ship, the icon representing it gave off a soft, greenish glow. Although it was difficult to tell, some in the committee felt that the icons were exact working replicas of each item depicted. There was no way to find out because the icons were inaccessible. Unlike our own control panels - which have access panels to the instrumentation via an opening in the back, front or side - there is no means of entry to the Alien control panel of instruments. Alien Spaceship Like “Living Metallic Animal” The whole spaceship resembles a kind of living metallic animal. It has no visible rivets or screws to hold things together, nor are there any seams. The ship and its contents seemed to be more organic than synthetic. There are no hinges, latches, knobs, rollers or wheels - only a smooth, even, one-piece skin that encompassed the whole craft. The ship extracted infinitely more information about the researchers than the researchers could ever hope to collect from the craft. That was a foregone conclusion by the committee. There was no mechanism clicking away in the craft to indicate the craft was gathering information. But the craft adapted to some of the awkward ways the researchers went about culling material from it. The craft gave clues to the scientist when items activated certain devices and openings on the craft. The ship did this by making the Alien item the scientist was looking for give off a glow. In a few cases, there was a sound that indicated the Alien object needed to proceed with whatever project the scientist was working on. The process was similar to the way humans solve problems: if we study a problem long enough, many times a solution present itself in a dream or inspiration. The theory is that the subconscious mind, like a computer, works better at night while all other distractions are at a minimum. Possibly the craft picked up on the frustration of the scientists in a similar manner and the provided some of the solutions. Still, the road to understanding the Aliens and their craft was long and full of potholes. The scientists hit every obstacle. Why did the Aliens dump so much difficult information on earthlings all at once? Did the Aliens overestimate the ability of humans to comprehend an advanced society as their own? Highly unlikely, given the Alien superiority,"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"which suggests they are not capable of making such a mistake. Alien Technology - Where Does It Come From? How much new technology was gathered from that particular Alien craft and then put into practical earthly use is not known. At what rate the Alien technology was dispersed is also unknown. Like any product that is manufactured in factories, the finished object is the result of many dissimilar processes. The raw materials come from one source, while the knowledge of how to process it comes from another source. It is not necessary to know where one technology ends and another begins or from where it came. All that matters is the end product. The technology or bits of information coming from the committee are collected and mixed with other bits of information from other sources and technologies. This committee is just one of many others that are secretly working on “who knows what?” Truthfully, who cares as long as new technology keeps coming. The knowledge derived from the Alien ship is combined with other sources that are not so secret, like universities and private corporations that do research. All these bits of information flowing and combining until someone yells, “Eureka!” that signals yet another step toward a more advanced world. The Magic of the Icons One of the members felt that he cracked the puzzle about how the Alien objects vanished and then returned to the ship. He felt that the icons were not only symbols on a control panel, but were actual items. The items that are carried out of the craft and studied by the scientists are simply disposable replicas of the icons. The life span of the replicas is exactly 72 hours. The scientist believed that the Alien objects dissolved into the atmosphere, leaving no evidence that they ever existed. This theory fit well with the reports made by people who have claimed they were abducted. All of the abductees reported that Aliens have inserted metal objects into various parts of their bodies. But when skeptics have asked the human subjects to produce the Alien implanted objects, the abductees have been unable to do so. Up to that point, no one on the committee had proved that the Alien items vaporized, but it was one of their better hunches at the time. Vaporization also explained why no one ever found an Alien artifact, or why there is no evidence that Aliens ever visited Earth. Vaporization answered the big question that UFO skeptics always ask: “If Aliens are visiting Earth, where is the Alien litter?” The answer to that question has always been clear to some - the Aliens are not the litterbugs that humans are. Those answers are too simplistic for the skeptics and the committee wants to keep it that way. The committee has no intentions of supplying hard proof, or any proof, of Alien existence. On the contrary, the scientists would be the first to deny the existence of Aliens. The possibility that the control panel icons are replicating endless copies of themselves with the same ease as cells do in a laboratory was astounding. What kind of world could be built if only a fraction of that magic were to be squeezed out of these objects? Once an Alien item was taken out of the craft and it expired, only then did another one reappear to take its place. There was no method of knowing if the icons replicated new items every three days automatically? Or if only the ones that left the ship were renewed? The scientist were unable to test the theory by marking the Alien items as one would mark a dollar bill. The Alien metallic material was impervious to all manner of markings. That material would be a godsend for cities that are under assault by the graffiti infantile. Paint simply blots up and rolls off the Alien material. The moment “Frankenstein” became part of the inventory of the Alien craft, an icon of that male body appeared on a separate panel. If the theory held that the icons were the prototypes of all the items on the ship, then perhaps the committee could subject the body to many kinds of experiments. That would limit the committee's need to harvest damaged humans on which to experiment."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"To test that theory, the scientists made a drastic decision: “Kill the body.” The committee could not test that theory on any of the other Alien objects because they are indestructible. The body, on the other hand, was still flesh and blood. So, the scientists hoped the “Frankenstein” body could be damaged or killed. No one volunteered to kill the body. Even though the body was no more than a living plant, a “vegetable,” no one could bring themselves to kill it. The committee decided to request from its superiors the assistance of a Mafia-type hit man. The request was approved and the committee was told to draft a procedure about how the assignment would be carried out. The committee decided to have this done on a remote island and to have the murder staged as a hit over a gambling debt. The body was dressed in casual clothing appropriate for lounging on a beach. The body was staged reclining under a beach umbrella wearing dark sunglasses and supposedly listening to music coming from a portable radio sitting on the sand next to the body. “Frankenstein” was flown to that destination on a military cargo plane. The orders to the hit man were, “Approach the man from behind, shoot him through the head three times and leave.” The hit man had no clue as to whom he was killing and assumed it was a routine “hit” ordered by his employer. After the hit took place, the committee members in charge of that operation sealed off the area. The scientists made detailed observations about what took place in the body moments after it was shot. The body was monitored for 72 hours to see if it would vanish like all the other Alien objects. When it did not, the committee returned the body to the base and did an autopsy on it. The scientists discovered that the Alien contraption was no longer inside the body. The autopsy did not find anything mysterious or unusual about the dead body. It showed the same amount of decomposition that any normal cadaver undergoes in that time period under similar conditions. The study raised more questions and answered none. The death did not prove that the Alien objects decompose. The death only proved that the human body with the Alien contraption is mortal. The icon of the body was no longer displaying on the control panel. There was no eulogy given and no sorrow shown from anyone who worked with, or around, the body. Instead, most were relieved at not having it around anymore. Once the body was gone, there was a noticeable jump in morale. But those happy days were short-lived. Orders from the top were to produce one more body as soon as possible, with more bodies to follow sometime in the future. Aliens Take the Initiative One morning one of the committee members revealed to his colleagues that he had been abducted the night before! That revelation brought a sense of excitement to the rest of the members. All of them believed that because of the special circumstances of their work, it was strange it had not happened sooner. The scientist abductee told his colleagues that it had been going on even before he came to the program. The scientist then told the committee that they, too, are abductees and have been taken many times since their childhood. The Aliens allowed him to remember this abduction because, as they put it, “It was time.” The scientist was abducted while he was at home sleeping. There were other humans on the Alien craft with him who had been abducted moments before the Aliens took him. The non-humans allowed the scientist to be an “observer” and for the first time in his life, he was not the subject of whatever procedure the Aliens performed. The other humans there with him were not so lucky. The scientist had to endure the torment he watched each put through. He did not have freedom of movement and was told telepathically where to go and he did, even before his conscious mind understood the request. The Aliens had direct access to his subconscious mind. Under the Alien control, his body moved as if he were on auto-pilot. All the scientist could do was mentally sit back while his body instantly took psychic commands from the Aliens. The Aliens were friendly, treated him kindly and constantly assured the scientist that he did not need to be afraid. When he had a question and the Aliens were willing to answer, it was answered quicker than the question formed in his mind. If it was a question the Aliens would not answer, the non-humans told the scientist and then let him know that possibly he would be"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"given an answer to that question some time in the future. Even when their intentions were to never reveal a certain secret, the Aliens avoided using negative responses. It was a good thing that the Aliens had the scientist on auto-pilot, he told his colleagues, because his knees were shaky. After working on this Alien project for more than twenty-five years, the scientist could not believe how unprepared he was to meet the Aliens face-to-face. The scientist knew that the abduction he experienced that night was only the initiation and that he was not expected to understand any of the things that went on. He did remember that there were four other adult human men there with him. Each was sitting naked on a bench. Each looked as if he were in boot camp, sitting up straight with a forlorn look. Each was not completely paralyzed because the scientist watched two of the men turn their heads and look straight at the scientist. He recognized the fear he saw in the men's eyes. “It was the same fear he had in his!” The scientist told his committee colleagues that the stars are much brighter when viewed from a vantage point above the earth's atmosphere. He rambled on about how giddy he felt despite his fear. While the Aliens did their work, the craft was parked somewhere in Earth's orbit. The scientist wanted to go to one of the portals for a better look at the stars and to see what Earth looked like from space. But the Aliens told him he could not during that visit. The Aliens were strictly business, not like a doctor's office on Earth where a patient has time to read magazines before the visit begins. There was little waiting for the anxious souls who were in the Alien ship. One at a time, each human got up and walked into a room that seemed to be as bright as the sun itself. Then seemingly from nowhere, a frail-looking Alien appeared with a rapid motion assisted the human subject onto the table. Everything in the room was polished and orderly. Instruments seemed to appear out of thin air when they were needed. That room was similar to the one that was aboard the craft the committee had in its possession, except that the scientists never witnessed instruments permeate from the walls as happened during the abduction. That Alien room was the only one that was similar to the committee's craft. The abduction craft was much bigger - eight to ten times bigger. The scientist physically did not see many Aliens, but somehow he knew there were dozens of them on board that ship. As the scientist watched the Aliens work (at speeds that made him dizzy), all he could think of was getting out of that place. It was ironic. He waited for that moment for many years and now he was not sure he ever wanted it again. Some on the committee wondered if they should go through regression therapy to find out what kind of experiences each had when each was abducted. None of them knew for sure if they had been abducted. All but two were not surprised when regression confirmed abductions had taken place. The committee member who was abducted and who revealed that fact to his colleagues advised them not to go through regression. He told the scientists that from what he had seen, he could attest that the procedures the Aliens used on abductees were extremely painful. So, the best thing for them was not to relive that experience. “Going back to revisit it is nothing short of masochistic,” he told the committee. Although the Aliens worked too rapidly for him to keep up with what the Aliens were doing, the scientist was awed by how precisely the Aliens and their machines performed their duties. If the scientist had not been so scared, he would have laughed at what he saw, although what the abductees were going through was not laughable. The way the human abductees were tossed around “like rag dolls” was somewhat amusing. It was as if he were in a den of mad magicians. There were objects that flew around the room, sometimes stopping over the table where the abductee was lying. That flying Alien object would perform a jig, then move about the room swaying and dancing in the air. Other Alien objects are robotic and walked or hovered. Some appeared out of thin air, did their thing and then left. Some of the Aliens looked human, but perhaps they were like the scientist on some kind of internship. If the human- looking ones were like him, those humanoids were at a higher level than the scientist was because those humanoids walked around freely and did not seem"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"to be experiencing the fear that he and the other abducted humans were. Many of the instruments that were used by the Aliens seemed to come from nowhere. Some appeared to be organic and moved and looked like worms. Those emerged from what looked like solid surfaces, yet left no hole after emerging or when the Alien objects retreated back into the solid surfaces. Regardless of what was performed on the abducted humans, the outcome was never hit and miss. It was “known.” The Aliens literally split one of the men down the middle, cutting him completely in half. Seconds later, the Aliens had put the human man back together. All this was done with no blood loss or visible scars. Everything was outpatient. There was no lying around convalescing for the abducted. Once each person emerged from the surgical table, each was ready to be returned to their respective bedrooms, or to wherever each had originally been picked up from. Because of the pain that was endured by the abducted humans, it might have seemed like the humans were there in the craft for hours. But from what the committee scientist could recall, none of the abducted were under the “knife” for more than two or three minutes. The actual time it took might have been longer, since the passage of time is difficult to judge while inside an Alien craft.
