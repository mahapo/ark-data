Click here to see Part 1 of Status Report VI Computer simulation based on memory of a military officer who alleges he saw a photograph of a crashed saucer near Farmington, New Mexico on file at a military base library open only to personnel with Top Secret access clearances. From Chuck Oldham's 1991 interview with the unidentified officer. Report About Alleged Farmington, New Mexico UFO Crash © 1991 by Chuck and Vicky Oldham 'Q. Did the file or any of the documents within the file have a classification stamped on them such as 'Classified' or 'Top Secret?' A. No. They were just in the (military) base library; but you needed to have the proper clearance to be admitted. Q. Before you saw the file, did you ever have any experience with UFOs - any personal sightings? A. No, not at all. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Q. Were you asked or required to look at this material in the library at any time? A. No. Q. So you don't think some kind of test was being conducted, with you as the subject? A. No, I was alone when I viewed the file. I was actually looking for something else at the time. Q. So you came across this file by accident? A. Yes. Q. What did you see in the photograph? A. There was a perfectly intact, circular shaped craft and it was lying somewhat tilted to one side on the ground in the desert. There did not appear to be a crater or other ground-surface disturbance in the photograph that would indicate a crash. But I could not tell for sure. Q. Could you describe the angle in which the craft appeared tilted as it lay on the ground? A. I would estimate that it was tilted from about five to ten degrees. Q. Did the top view of the craft form a perfect circle? A. I couldn't tell. The photograph showed the craft from the side, as if somebody on the ground had taken the picture some distance away. But it was referred to as a saucer shape. Q. Was there any mention of radiation associated with this craft? A. It wasn't indicated. Q. So you say that the craft was intact - no damage anywhere? A. Well, the report referred to this particular craft in much greater detail. This just reinforced what I was seeing in the photograph, but they also elaborated on many details not evident in viewing the picture. First of all, it was stated that the craft was retrieved somewhere near the town of Farmington, New Mexico, prior to 1950. As I could see in the photograph, the material of which the craft was composed was metallic and resembled brushed aluminum - the report noted this also. Q. Were there any fin-like projections noticed on this craft? A. No, none at all. Q. Was there any mention that this structure was reminiscent of a gyro; in other words, did the exterior of the craft rotate around the cockpit? A. There was nothing indicated about that. Q. Could you make out any identifying markings or symbols on the craft as it appeared in the photograph? A. No. And there was nothing mentioned about it. Q. Were there any surface features on the craft at all? A. It was stated in the report that there were portholes on the cabin part of the craft, but they were not made of any type of glass. Also, I couldn't make out this feature in the photograph. Q. Did the information reveal what that material could have been? (See Diagrams Below) A. Well, this porthole had a puncture that was the diameter of a pencil; that"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"was the only defect discovered on the entire ship. Our people tried diamond drills, an acetylene torch - everything they could come up with on the porthole where this opening was located, but nothing would break through it. They couldn't enlarge the hole, either; the material was tougher than anything we were familiar with on Earth. But they eventually got into the cabin. Q. Did it say how they accessed it? A. Yes. It was described as a chance opening. They had gone over the outside of the craft and could not even find a seam or crack that might indicate the location of a door or other entrance. this led them to focus on the small opening in the porthole. As I mentioned earlier, they used everything they could think of to enlarge this hole - and nothing worked. It was concluded that they would have to somehow gain access through this hole and they eventually did because a door popped open. It appeared from a place where there were no obvious seams or other indications of a door. The report said (referring to the opening and closing of the door) that it was 'almost as if the material of the craft had liquefied and then solidified again,' leaving no clue of the door's location upon closing. If there was a seam, it was so tight it could not be observed. Q. Did you ever see the movie, The Day The Earth Stood Still ? It sounds like a scene from the movie where they show the military trying a blowtorch on a spaceship, but with no luck. A. No. I never saw the movie. Q. Did the report in the file indicate the size of this craft? A. My recollection is that it was around thirty-some feet in diameter. Q. Was there anything in the report that indicated the weight of the craft? A. Yes, it was apparently composed of a very light weight material. The report stated that two average men could lift or move the entire ship! Q. Did you ever see anything about the ability of these ships to become invisible, like the cloaking idea presented on Star Trek ? A. It was indicated that there was no way of telling whether they got out of sight so fast that your eyes could not follow them, or if they actually had cloaking or light-bending ability. Q. I am especially interested in what these dead occupants were like. Were they described as biological extraterrestrials? A. They didn't use that terminology that I can remember. But yes, they were described as being like us, but smaller - two arms, two legs, a head, feet and hands. Q. Were they all alike in appearance? A. Well, it said that the two bodies were badly charred. So was the interior of the cockpit of the craft. The report also said that they were about four feet in height; there was no description of their features beyond that. Q. So there was no mention of sexual differences? A. No, no mention of that. But it's interesting that the report said that the clothing was not burned at all. Q. So there was a description of the fabric? A. Yes, it was some type of woven fabric and the report said that it had a tensile strength of 800 pounds. Q. Was the color of the fabric mentioned? A. No, there was no reference to it. Q. How about the style of the clothing? Did they both wear the same thing? "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"A. It was only described as being like a one-piece flight suit. And yes, it was the same on each one. Q. Was there any mention of craft propulsion systems? For example, anything involving jet, nuclear, or anti-matter driven engines? A. There was no mention of a propulsion system, other than the idea that their technology utilized magnetic or gravitational fields of the planets to travel in space. It was speculated that they were able to cross greater distances of space within a much shorter time than we thought possible. For instance, based on our present day technology, it would take us years to get very far in space. To them, it would only be a matter of days, or even hours. Q. How could the military figure this out? A. The report did not go into depth on this, but part of the conclusion was based upon the fact that there was no food or bathroom facility found within the cabin of the craft. Q. Was there anything in the report that indicated the reason for the craft coming down? For example, there have been rumored reports that our military was under orders to intercept and shoot them down. Is it possible that we shot this one down? A. No. According to the report, we were not responsible for bringing this craft or any of the other ones down. There was mention of a magnetic fault, or opening, or something like that, located in the area where the craft came down. There were three of these faults or openings located in North America: one was located in the Southwest, around the Texas/New Mexico area; one was somewhere in the Carolinas; and one was somewhere in the Northeast sector, but I can't remember exactly where. Q. You mentioned 'or any of the other ones.' Are you saying that there was more than one crash? A. Yes, the report referred to 'crashes' and the Farmington crash information was used to relate general information on similarities with other crashes. Q. Are you saying that these aliens are not able to control their craft in certain areas? A. From the report, I learned that these areas occur naturally and could possibly interfere with the navigation of these craft. You see, the way I understand it, they use the natural magnetic lines of a planet and a gravity field to move their ships from one place to another. That's how they are able to make near-right-angle turns, which our jets are incapable of doing. They can fly circles around any of our aircraft. Q. Was there anything in the report that suggested where the craft and the little beings originated? Or why they are coming here? A. No, nothing in the report as to 'why' or 'from where.' But the report did say that hundreds of alien craft flew over the town of Farmington, New Mexico, on the anniversary of this crash. That also corresponded with the celebration of some national holiday. And it said that it might have been a tribute to the beings that were killed, or they were letting us know - by a show of force - they had overcome the factor that had caused their ships to crash. Farmington Daily Times , New Mexico, March 18, 1950. Q. How did the military report specifically refer to it? For instance, was it described as 'a tribute to their fallen comrades?'"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" A. they didn't use the term 'comrades.' Actually, there was some specific terminology used, but I can't recall what it was. (Note: Chuck speculated that whatever the word was that referred to the dead beings, it may have some important significance indicating our military's awareness of the relationships or order within the alien culture.) Q. Why do you feel that the military or the government is withholding this information from the public? A. They felt that only people in professional levels were capable of dealing with this information. Based on what occurred with the Orson Welles War of the Worlds radio presentation, this information could create panic. Then it threatens to break down the industrial complex that supports the military complex - it would obviously undermine it. And it could possibly reduce our ability to counter an attack by a hostile alien culture. But it was also clear that the intent of these particular beings was not known. While our technicians worked on the craft out in the desert (trying to gain access), other alien ships would, from time to time, fly by the site, pausing momentarily to view the scene, perhaps to see if there were any survivors. At no time did they attempt to harm our people. Q. Do you have any other comments you would like to make about this? A. I think I've covered everything. All the information on this subject was removed from the library in the late 1960s. One thing I can say is that I would sure like to know what's going on now. Craft Diagrams: Aztec Crash The following diagrams demonstrate a hypothetical analysis of random probings to gain access to the mechanism controlling the cabin entrance door. This method uses a thin, rigid metal rod, maneuvered through a pencil-sized opening in a porthole. Aztec Crash - Estimated dimensions of Aztec saucer cabin were 18 feet diameter and 6 feet high. Farmington Crash Estimated dimensions of Farmington saucer cabin, based on diagram identified by witness. The scale used to formulate diagrams A and B was 9/32 inch = 1 foot. Farmington Crash - Estimated dimensions of Farmington saucer cabin were 6 feet diameter and 3.5 feet high."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" The following factors were used as a basis to formulate the measurements shown in the documents: Cabin floor levels and location of portholes are based on height of reported occupants (36 to 48 inches high). Thickness of porthole material combined with the relatively small diameter of the broken area and the angle of penetration of the break itself would restrict the play of any object used to probe inside cabin. See diagram C. Conclusion: Traversing a six-foot diameter cabin would afford one greater control and accessibility. The far side of the cabin's interior would be easily reached. In contrast, attempting to probe inside a larger, 18-foot-diameter cabin using a long, pencil-thin metal rod would be extremely difficult. Farmington Saucer Scale: 6/32 inches = 1 foot Oldham References "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"We include a book list because we are concerned that much of this literature has been passed over by present-day researchers. Some of the accounts contained here have long been discredited and are sadly ignored. We initially avoided much of the older material ourselves and would not have bothered with it if we did not have the information divulged to us by our witness (to the military file). This is further significant because we first became acquainted with this person over an entirely different subject of interest and it was an offhand remark about UFOs that led him to reveal his story. Ruppelt, Edward J. The Report on Unidentified Flying Objects. Garden City, New York: Doubleday & Company, Inc. 1956. In this book we found a corroborative reference to the incident in Farmington, New Mexico. Keyhoe, Major Donald E. The Flying Saucers Are Real. New York, N. Y.: Fawcett Publication, Inc. 1950. Here we found a brief account of the Farmington incident. We also read about Keyhoe's trip to Denver, Colorado, to check on the story about the 'little men;' he was convinced it was a hoax. Berlitz, Charles and Moore, William L. The Roswell Incident. New York, N. Y.: Berkeley Publishing Corporation, 1980. The authors suggest that the Scully story may not have been the perpetration of a hoax after all. Edwards, Frank Flying Saucers - Serious Business. New York, N. Y.: Lyle Stuart, Inc., 1966. A very informative book. Areas of interest to us include the chapter entitled 'Pick Up the Pieces' which features accounts about Wilbert B. Smith of Canada. Scully, Frank Behind the Flying Saucers. New York, N. Y.: Henry Holt and Company, 1950. New evidence indicates that he was telling the truth about the crashes of disks and the recovery of the bodies. The story told here is an amazing corroboration of details that were revealed by our witness to the file. He has never heard of Scully or his book. Steinman, William S. Stevens, Wendelle C. UFO Crash at Aztec. Tucson, Arizona: UFO Photo Archives, 1986. This is an extensive and impressive work that substantiates Scully's claims from 1950. We feel that Mr. Steinman demonstrates a singular determination and courage that is rarely seen in UFO research. His personal interview with Dr. Sarbacher, confirming Scully's story, is key. Stringfield, Leonard H. Retrievals of the Third Kind, 1978; The UFO Crash Retrieval Syndrome, 1980; UFO CRASH/RETRIEVALS: Amassing the Evidence, 1982; UFO CRASH/RETRIEVALS: Is the Cover-up Lid Lif ting? 1989. Cincinnati, Ohio. We feel that Leonard Stringfield's series of status reports have been an immense contribution to UFO research for more than a decade. Without this ongoing and regularly updated grounding in the physical aspect of the UFO phenomenon, many researchers might have become totally lost in the paranormal hypothesis. Mr. Stringfield has demonstrated great tenacity and tireless dedication, persisting in his investigations despite the barrage of disinformation that discourages (and even frightens) other would-be researchers. We express our gratitude to him for his relentless quest to uncover the truth.' Len Stringfield: Unfortunately, without an exact year affixed to the saucer crash near Farmington, except that it occurred before 1950, we can only speculate that it was another case of using a catchall name for the alleged crash in the smaller town of Aztec in 1948. If that be the case, then we must overlook Scully's cast of swindling characters in his book and look anew at the facts - as amorphous as they might be - that Steinman tried to resurrect in his book.\""},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Continued in Part 12.
