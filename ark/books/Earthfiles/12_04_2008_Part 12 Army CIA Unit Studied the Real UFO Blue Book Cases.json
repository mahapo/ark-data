Jim at Area 51 said alien craft propulsion systems were anti-magnetic and anti-gravitational on two of the craft and one had an anti-matter type propulsion that was much more complicated than the other two.” - “S tein,” Former Army/CIA UFO Analyst R eturn to Part 1 R eturn to Part 11 December 4, 2008 Alb uquerque, New Mexico - My June 29, 1998, interview with Stein at his Florida home continues from Part 11. Howe: “WHAT OTHER FILES DID YOU LOOK THROUGH? Stein: “We looked through the WWII German file. THAT SAME DAY YOU SAW THE ROSWELL FILE? Yes, same day. WHAT WAS THAT FILE CALLED? ‘End of World War II Agreements File,’ something like that. I thought it would be surrender papers from Germany, but when I opened the file up, it was something entirely different from that. IS ANTHONY BARDEN READING THAT FILE WITH YOU? No, he was still in the Project Blue Book category. Later I went to get him and brought him to see the Roswell file and the German file. He read the German file first because he thought it was more exciting. In this particular file about end of WWII Germany agreements, these documents were typed out with a script typewriter – script print. That’s super fancy, like if you typed up an expensive will and testament document. Real nice looking. Anthony mentioned that he had never seen script form of typing in any other documents he had ever seen. And the script print did not look like it belonged there because it wasn’t like government typewriters or teletypes we saw in most documents and files. WHAT WERE YOU READING? It mentioned movements at the end of WWII. It mentioned tracing where Adolph Hitler had left. Three weeks before the final end of the war when the Germans finally surrendered, Hitler went in a small airplane to Norway – Hitler and Eva Braun both – and the burned body outside of the basement stronghold where Hitler had been was his double and not him. The Russians knew that and found paperwork in regards to the body double. The Russians knew that it was not Hitler who died in the bunker. HOW DID PEOPLE KNOW HITLER HAD A DOUBLE? Even at the end of the war in the last days or weeks, Hitler had all the small children - those 11 through 13 – that were out shooting rifles in his youth program. There were all these little kids with rifles and the news film showed Hitler coming out of his bunker and shaking hands with the kids. Hitler told them to do the best they could because Germany ‘is in your hands,’ having lost a lot of soldiers. So, Hitler told the children they had to do the work of men. In those films when he went out to see the children, Hitler looked very old and decrepit, like he was very ill. The reason for that, I believe, is that Hitler’s double was older than the actual Adolph Hitler. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"HOW OLD WAS HITLER AT THE END OF WORLD WAR II? He was 56. G ermany's Adolph Hitler, April 20, 1889 to April 30, 1945. Image source: Wikipedia. A dolph Hitler signature. Source: Wikipedia. [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia source - Adolf Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn, Austria-Hungary on April 20, 1889, and allegedly died April 30, 1945, in Berlin, Germany, amid controversy about whether a body double had died instead. Adolf Hitler became the leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party or Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei , abbreviated as Nazi party. Hitler was German Chancellor from 1933 to 1945 and Fuhrer und Reichskanzler from 1934 to 1945. The German invasion of Poland in 1939 caused the British and French nations to declare war on Germany. By 1945, Germany was in ruins. Hitler's bid for territorial conquest and establishment of a “super Aryan race” caused the deaths of 43 million people, including the systematic Holocaust genocide of some six million Jews. As Berlin was invaded by Allies, on April 29, 1945, Hitler married Eva Braun and allegedly the two committed suicide in the Fuhrerbunker within 24 hours of marriage. Controversial Hitler Death Photos A lthough the same person seems to be in both frames, a white area next to the face in the right image is not present in the left frame. The body and/or camera may have been moved, with one scene recast to nearly identically resemble the other, meaning perhaps a more Hitler-looking image on left replaced possible body double on right.

(Office of Strategic Services was CIA precursor) HAVE ACTUAL FIRSTHAND EYEWITNESS TESTIMONY THAT HITLER WAS USING A DOUBLE? On some of the forms in the Germany file at CIA Langley, it said definitely that our U. S. government knew Hitler had a body double from at least the spring of 1944. It also mentioned that Hitler and Eva Braun flew in a small airplane to Norway and went from there to South America in a submarine. The only reason our OSS spies knew that Hitler was in that plane is that Hitler had special buttons on his topcoat and a Fuhrer button was found in the airplane that had ripped off his coat. He was in the backseat that had to be pushed forward in order to climb out of the airplane. Apparently that’s when his button hooked on the edge of the backseat and tore off as he was getting out of the plane and was lodged right there. IN THE DOCUMENT YOU WERE READING AT THE CIA LANGLEY ARCHIVE, WHERE DID IT SAY THAT HITLER AND EVA BRAUN WENT IN A SUBMARINE? The file said some of the submarines went to Antarctica and some went to Argentina. But Hitler went to Colombia, South America. IT SAID THAT IN THE DOCUMENT THAT HAD THE SCRIPT PRINT? Yes, that Hitler had a German base in southern Colombia, (northwestern South America west of Venezuela.) The document Anthony and I read said that Colombia is where Adolf Hitler went. Then when he arrived, we in the U. S. had OSS people there who reported that Hitler had shaved off his moustache and he was very sad looking because Eva Braun died in the submarine on the way to Colombia from a ruptured appendix. WHAT CITY IN COLOMBIA? I don’t know. The document just said southern Colombia where there was a German stronghold. The Germans had quite a bit of property in southern Colombia. There were a lot of Germans already there that escaped earlier as everything was falling apart. Most of them went to Argentina, but there were some of the upper echelon that went to southern Colombia, the big wheels like Hitler. WAS THERE ANYTHING IN THE DOCUMENT ABOUT HITLER AFTER HE WAS IN COLOMBIA? YOU WERE READING ABOUT A 1945 EVENT IN 1958, WHICH WAS ONLY THIRTEEN YEARS AFTER WWII ENDED. The form we were reading at the CIA archive was in a box dated 1946, and the documents were dated like the summer of 1946, I believe. It was not a 1958 document. These were older WWII documents. WAS THERE ANYTHING IN FILES DATED LATER THAN 1946 ABOUT HITLER? No, the only reference in the 1946 document was about him in southern Colombia. It mentioned where he was in a German stronghold and gave coordinates about north, west and so forth about where the stronghold was exactly. The document said Hitler was getting down in Colombia The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune and the Berlin newspaper after the war. So, our OSS guys were tracking what mail Hitler was getting in Colombia. IN 1958, DID ANTHONY BARDEN SAY ANYTHING ABOUT FINDING OUT MORE ABOUT HITLER IN COLOMBIA? The only thing we found that was dated later was one small folder labeled ‘1948.’ That folder is the one that mentioned that the United States had an expedition going to Antarctica with Admiral Richard Byrd. There were quite a few soldiers and a number of aircraft. Some were on ships at sea. There were half a dozen ships. When they got down to Antarctica, the airplanes had skis so they could land on the glacier-packed areas. So, they had a sizable force. Also, there were jeeps sent down. DID THE DOCUMENT SAY WHY ADMIRAL BYRD WAS DOING THIS? The document in the CIA files said Byrd was sent to Antarctica by the U. S. government, but the cover story was a ‘scientific expedition’ to map out areas of Antarctica. It also mentioned that Byrd et al encountered other military forces, allegedly Nazi forces based there. The document said our troops that we had sent there met strong resistance from unidentified forces there – left over Nazis? Or aliens? [ Editor's Note: See Part 1 of this Earthfiles Real X-Files series."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Also, Wikipedia reports: “United States Antarctic Service Expedition (1939–1941), often referred to as Admiral Richard Evelyn Byrd’s third Antarctic Expedition, was jointly sponsored by the U. S. Navy, State Department, Department of the Interior, The Treasury and contributions by private citizens, corporations and institutions. “ A total of 125 men from military, government and science departed on the two ships of the United States Antarctic Service Expedition. The objectives of the Expedition were outlined in an order from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt dated November 25, 1939. The President wanted two bases to be established: East Base, in the vicinity of Charcot Island and West Base, in the vicinity of King Edward VII Land. Also a site on the Bay of Whales at or near Little America was to be investigated, and delineation of the continental coast line between the meridians 72 degrees W., and 148 degrees W. Observations were conducted in every conceivable area: seismic, cosmic ray, auroral, biological, tidal, magnetic and physiological. The expedition was cut short for reasons unknown and the evacuation of East Base was completed on March 22, 1940. ] Stein: “We also found another file about the Vril technology. The first thing in the file when we opened it up was a British classified document, which was from the 1930s before WWII started. It showed that in Peenemunde, the Germans had developed the saucer craft with an entirely different kind of propulsion system. Intelligence did not know exactly what the propulsion system was, but they knew that the craft did not burn any fossil fuels. It had a levitation device, I think is how they described it in the file. WAS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT EXTRATERRESTRIALS IN THE VRIL FILE? It did say there were mediums who had contacted aliens and there were messages from aliens about how to build the levitation device for the anti-gravitational engine. DID ANTHONY BARDEN SEE THAT? Yes, and he said to me that the more we read, the more we had no idea about what had really gone on in WWII. HE WAS SEEING THE VRIL MATERIAL FOR THE FIRST TIME? Yes. We were hurrying through the files looking for references about alien beings, but didn’t find much except a brief mention about some mediums contacting aliens concerning levitation devices. ANTHONY BARDEN, WHO CAME FROM THE O.S.S. AND WWII AND KNEW SO MUCH, WHAT DID HE SAY? We only talked frankly when we got outside the CIA building. You had to watch what you said inside the CIA headquarters warehouse. We knew it was all electronically bugged. WHEN YOU WALKED OUTSIDE, YOU SAID ANTHONY BARDEN TURNED TO YOU AND SAID? ‘I never expected to see this! I expected to see more on aliens, but I never expected to see that WWII had so much to do with German technology. And when we saw the two saucer craft at Area 51, Anthony looked at me then and said, ‘Vril craft!’ The third big one with the gun on the bottom Col. Jim also said was a ‘Vril craft.’ I saw information that some Vril craft went back to the early 1920s! WHAT WAS THE DIAMETER OF THE FIRST TWO SMALLER VRIL CRAFT? I think about 18 to 20 feet on the Vril craft. The middle alien craft were 30 to 40 feet in diameter and then the back craft were about 60 feet in diameter. Area 51 “Foreign Technology” 2 Vril Craft - Germany? 3 Alien Craft - Unknown Source? 2 Large Craft - Germany? Other? OK, TRY TO MENTALLY PUT YOURSELF ON THE CATWALK AND YOU ARE"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"LOOKING OUT AT THE CRAFT AND TRY TO GIVE MORE DETAILS, STARTING WITH THE FRONT TWO VRIL CRAFT. The two front Vril craft were almost identical. They were small, around 18 to 20 feet diameter, and looked very light. WHAT WAS THE SHAP E ? A little slight bubble in the center, like just enough room for one person’s head. The craft sloped down around from the slight bubble. Then the next three larger craft were identified as ‘alien craft.’ There was one that was some 30 feet in diameter at least, maybe 35 feet. WHAT ABOUT COLOR? The three alien craft were all silver-colored. Those three were not identical, but reasonably the same and the biggest one had a raised dome or cabin on top. HOW ARE THE ALIEN ONES DIFFERENT FROM THE VRIL? The outcropping or cabin on top was a little bit higher on the Vril craft, maybe 3 feet high and below on the Vril craft, it was flat on the bottom. One alien craft had like three little rounded domes on the bottom. On conventional aircraft, you might think they were three radar domes, but on the bottom of the discs. These were on the bottoms of the extraterrestrial craft. YOU DEFINITELY HEARD COL. JIM TELL YOU THAT THE THREE DISCS IN THE MIDDLE WERE EXTRATERRESTRIAL CRAFT? Yes, ‘alien craft.’ SO, THERE ARE THE TWO, DULL SILVERY, VRIL CRAFT IN FRONT THAT ARE ABOUT 18 TO 20 FEET IN DIAMETER. THEN THERE ARE THE THREE SHINY SILVER ‘ALIEN’ CRAFT IN THE MIDDLE THAT WERE 30 TO 35 FEET IN DIAMETER. Yes, and one of the three alien craft a little further back behind the front two might have been 40 feet in diameter. The three alien craft were not the same diameters. They were like small, medium and large, like 30, 35 and 40 feet in diameter. And the designs were slightly different. The largest one had a very low cabin area, but the whole craft were thicker than the other two smaller ones. The two smaller ones were thinner craft with higher center areas. DID ALL THREE HAVE THE THREE ROUNDED DOMES ON THE BOTTOM? No, just the larger one. WHAT WERE THE BOTTOMS LIKE ON THE TWO SMALLER ALIEN CRAFT? As far as I could see, they were just a smooth and slightly curved bottom. Nothing was protruding down. WHAT WAS THE SOURCE OF THE ALIEN CRAFT? Col. Jim said all three were from New Mexico. ANY SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATIONS? All Col. Jim said was, ‘We got these three alien craft from New Mexico.’ He didn’t specify a Roswell or other location. We saw one of the craft had been dismantled in one area because it was open on one side. We could see it was open, but from where we were standing, we could not see from the back side inside. That possibly could have been one of the Roswell crashes they were studying for back-engineering and left it apart. DID COL. JIM SAY ANYTHING SPECIFIC ABOUT THE THREE ALIEN CRAFT? I asked him what the propulsion system was on the three alien craft. Col. Jim at Area 51 said alien craft propulsion systems were anti-magnetic and anti-gravitational on two of the craft and one had an anti-matter type propulsion that was much more complicated than the other two. Apparently they thought that the anti-matter propulsion was older and more complicated than the newer anti-gravitational systems in the other two craft. BEYOND THE FRONT TWO VRIL CRAFT, THE THREE ALIEN CRAFT IN THE"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"MIDDLE, HOW MANY MORE WERE THERE IN THAT PAPOOSE MOUNTAIN CAVE HANGAR? There were two more. One was about 50 feet in diameter and is kind of a different structure. Those craft had much larger structures protruding upward, like maybe 8 or 10 feet above the disc. And below on those, one was just a slightly curved bottom but mostly flat. The other one also had just a curved bottom, but it had a gun emplacement of some kind hanging from it. Col. Jim said the Germans called it a ‘death ray,’ something they had been developing in early WWII. DID COL. JIM SAY THOSE TWO LARGER CRAFT IN THE BACK WERE GERMAN? Yes, German craft and they found them, I believe, in Germany in the back of the Messerschmitt aircraft plant down in southern Germany near Austria. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Messerschmitt AG was a famous German aircraft manufacturer, known primarily for its World War II fighter aircraft, notably the Bf 109 and Me 262. The company survived in the post-war era, undergoing a number of mergers and changing its name from Messerschmitt to Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm before being bought by DASA in 1989, now part of EADS.] SO WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN PEENEMUNDE? In the 1930s, Germany was building the Vril craft there. Then later on, Germany started building V-1 and V-2 rockets for a big push to attack England. All the other craft and technologies were moved away from Peenemunde and the two large discs at Area 51 had been moved to the Messerschmitt plant. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - Peenemünde is a village in northeastern Germany, part of Usedom island. It stands near the mouth of the Peene river, on the easternmost part of the German Baltic coast. Shortly before and during the WW II, a military center was set up at Peenemünde for developing and testing guided missiles, in particular the V-1 flying bomb and V-2 rocket. The location permitted rocket test flights over water with monitoring along about 320 kilometers of the Pomeranian coast. Peenemunde also developed WWII night- navigation and radar systems.] If Vril Craft Existed, Why Didn’t Hitler Use “Wonder Weapons” in WWII? “T he wonder weapons are the hope. It is laughable and senseless for us to threaten at this moment, without a basis in reality for these threats. The well-known mass destruction bombs are nearly ready. In only a few days, with the utmost meticulous intelligence, Hitler will probably execute this fearful blow, because he will have full confidence.... It appears that there are three bombs and each has an astonishing operation. The construction of each unit is fearfully complex and of a lengthy time of completion.” - B enito Mussolini, April 22, 1945, Political Testament"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"I taly's Benito Mussolini giving Roman salute standing next to Germany's Adolph Hitler on a reviewing stand during an official visit to occupied Yugoslavia, sometime between 1941 and 1943.

The enemy knows this, and besieges and attempts to destroy us. But we will answer this destruction with a storm and that without unleashing a bacteriological war, for which we are also prepared.... All my words are the purest truth. That you will see. We still have things that need to be finished, and when they are finished, they will turn the tide.” - A dolf Hitler, March 13, 1945, addressing German Ninth Army Officers DID YOU OR YOUR BOSS ASK COL. JIM - IF THE GERMANS HAD SUCH CRAFT WITH A RAY GUN UNDERNEATH - WHY DIDN’T HITLER USE THE ‘DEATH RAY’ IN WWII? Yes, we did ask. Col. Jim said he understood that Hitler chose not to use them, that these were the ‘wonder weapons’ that Mussolini and Hitler mentioned. Many people thought the German V-1, V-2 and V-3 rockets were the Nazi ‘wonder weapons,’ but that was not true. The discs were the wonder weapons with their speed and anti-gravitational technology. YOU WERE AT AREA 51 HOW LONG AFTER YOUR TRIP WITH ANTHONY BARDEN TO THE CIA LANGLEY HEADQUARTERS BASEMENT ARCHIVE? The June 1958 Langley trip was two months before the August 1958 trip to Area 51. AND YOU WERE SHOWN THE BLACK AND WHITE 16MM AUTOPSY FILM AT THE SOUTHEASTERN MILITARY BASE TWO WEEKS BEFORE THE AREA 51 TRIP? Ye s . SO AFTER ALL THAT, AFTER YOU GET TO AREA 51 IN AUGUST 1958 AND ARE STANDING ON THE WALKWAY WITH ANTHONY BARDEN, COL. JIM AND YOUR THREE OTHER CIA COLLEAGUES, DID ANY OF YOU SAY, ‘WE’VE SEEN THE 16MM FILM OF THE AUTOPSY/DISSECTION OF THE 6-FINGERED HUMANOID. WHICH ONE OF THESE CRAFT BELONGS TO THEM?’ Yes, we did ask that and all Col. Jim said was, ‘They told me since I’ve been here that these three alien craft were retrieved from New Mexico, but I don’t know which one is which or exactly from where. All I know is all three are supposed to be from New Mexico.’ THAT’S ALL COL. JIM SAID? That’s it. DID HE KNOW WHERE THE FOUR VRIL-TYPE CRAFT CAME FROM? The other four Col. Jim said were picked up in foreign areas. He said that the German Messerschmitt Haunnebu 1 and 2 were picked up in Germany. The other smaller two Vril"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"craft I would think were picked up in Germany as well, but Col. Jim acted like he did not know where those two craft were retrieved. IN ADDITION TO THE SEVEN DISCS, WAS THERE ANY DEBRIS YOU COULD SEE? There was a doorway on the far end that curved and went out to other areas. There was a big double or triple door that folded open on the other end that could have been another hangar area, but we never got into that one. 6-Fingered Control Panels and Headbands P anels with depressions of six-fingered hand prints allegedly found with the six-fingered humanoids in May 31 to June 2, 1947, recovery operation at crash site southwest of Socorro, New Mexico. Photograph from 16mm film © 1996 by Orbital Media Ltd. WHILE YOU WERE THERE, DID YOU EVER SEE ANY CONTROL PANELS LIKE THE ONES IN THE 1995 SANTILLI TV BROADCAST FILM? I saw control panels in drawings of them, the 6-fingered control panels. WHERE DID YOU SEE THE DRAWINGS? I saw those in the Roswell file itself at CIA Langley. I saw pictures similar to the Santilli film with the symbols on it and they had several printed pages fastened to the drawings that described how the 6-fingered panels worked with fingertip controls. The controls were tied to fibers that at first they could not identify how they worked. They saw little fibers running off to the end that plugged in and they did not know it was fiber optics because they had not been invented! In the printed pages that went with the drawings of the panels, they described ‘fiber filaments.’ T H AT ’ S W H AT I N V E S T I G AT O R S L O O K E D AT U N D E R A M I C R O S C O P E ? Yes. It described them checking at least one of the hand panels and found that all the ‘fiber filaments’ that we now know are fiber optics were all tied into the electrical current throughout the craft. It also said in that printed text that there were so many ‘fiber filaments’ in that craft that when it was picked up from the crash site, it had a slight glow to it from all the fiber optics in it. The craft glowed in the dark! The pages attached to the 6-fingered panel drawings said that all the walls of the craft glowed, everything was wired in this Roswell craft for electrical current. WHEN THE BEINGS HAD THEIR HANDS PLACED INTO THE PANELS, WHAT HAPPENED? Our investigators came to understand that the 6-fingered imprinted panels controlled all the craft’s functioning, including the anti-gravitational device. Our investigators did not know which finger did what on the control panel, but they knew all the fingers were primary to complete control of the craft, a craft apparently entirely guided by the beings’ hands. WHEN THEIR HANDS WERE IN THE PANELS THAT WERE FIBER OPTICALLY CONNECTED TO THE CRAFT, DIDN’T YOU MENTION READING ABOUT THE ENTIRE CRAFT BECOMING A CAPACITOR? On the print out that I saw in the Roswell file, the investigators did not find a distinct power plant in the Roswell craft they were studying. It was as if the entire craft provided the electromagnetic and anti-gravity fields and even the aliens that flew the craft – like their"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"uniforms were tied right into the electronic field and maybe the aliens themselves. Besides the 6-fingered control panels, they had pictures of the headbands that the aliens wore. The combination of the headbands and the fingers in the panels, the aliens could guide the craft. THE HEADBANDS WERE IN THE ROSWELL FILE AT CIA LANGLEY? Ye s . LT. COL. PHILIP J. CORSO ALSO TALKED ABOUT ALIEN HEADBANDS. It mentioned that human pilots tried the headbands hooked up to mild electric current, but all they got out of it was violent headaches. Naturally our brains would be different from theirs and whatever caused the craft to go one way or the other for the aliens didn’t work for the human brains. We now use head bands in fighter jet helmets hooked up so when the pilot looks to the right, the guns will turn in that direction. We’ve had that technology since the 1980s, probably back-engineered from the alien technology. Alien Headbands: Pages 98 - 99, The Day After Roswell © 1997 by Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" I-Beam “Alien Hieroglyphics” WHAT WAS THE DEBRIEFING ABOUT THE 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS? HOW WERE THEY DESCRIBED? There was very little information. The film was about ten years old when I and our team saw it. They just said this is the only film of the aliens and the body. There are photos taken by various citizens showing these aliens outside their craft walking around. But this is the only film that shows a close picture of the aliens and exactly what they look like. So, if you run across any more of these sightings that describe this particular 6-fingered being, you can compare against this film. DID YOU EVER SEE THE SYMBOLS ON THE I-BEAMS IN THE SANTILLI FILM? Yes, and it was listed on documents as ‘alien hieroglyphics.’ Before I left the military service, I saw more information that the hieroglyphics were actually ancient Greek. THAT’S WHAT I REPORTED IN MY BOOK, GLIMPSES OF OTHER REALITIES, VOL. II: HIGH STRANGENESS, BECAUSE IT WAS EASY TO MATCH THE SANTILLI SYMBOLS WITH ANCIENT GREEK. SO, WHY WOULDN’T THE INTELLIGENCE OPERATIVES IN 1947 HAVE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED GREEK LETTERS? Yeah, in the reports where it mentioned alien hieroglyphics, I saw one paragraph on the last page of it that said some letters compared to early Greek. And that was in the 1950s.

THE IMPLICATION IS THAT THE 6-FINGERED HUMANOIDS WERE INVOLVED WITH THE INSPIRATION OF THE GREEK CIVILIZATION? Yeah, did the Greeks get their alphabet from one of these aliens?! And on the craft at Area 51 closest to us, I could see some kind of hieroglyphics or writing around the outside circumference of the craft. WERE THOSE SYMBOLS INDENTED INTO, OR RAISED FROM, THE CRAFT’S SURFACE? I would say it was engraved into the surface, just half a dozen symbols on the craft.
