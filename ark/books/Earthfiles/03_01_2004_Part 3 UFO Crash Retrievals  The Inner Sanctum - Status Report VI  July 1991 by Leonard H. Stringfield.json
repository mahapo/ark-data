These status reports were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Status Report VII begins at Earthfiles 12/15/03 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Len Stringfield - continued: Roswell is a small town's name in New Mexico, adjacent to the old air base known as Roswell Air Field to its south. Both town and base are 75 miles away from the Max Brazel ranch near the still smaller town of Corona. There, allegedly, an alien saucer with its crew crashed on July 2, 1947. (Dates vary). Niched in history because of that event, Roswell will become even more enshrined when new evidence will be released in 1991 in two books. One entitled, UFO Crash At Roswell is co-authored by Don Schmitt, Director of Special Investigations for CUFOS, and Kevin Randle, Captain, USAF Reserves. The other is by scientist Stanton Friedman and aviation writer, Don Berliner. All four are battle-tested UFO researchers. And lest we forget, it was Bill Moore (and co-author Charles Berlitz) with Stan Friedman whose spadework investigations put the \"Roswell Incident\" on the map in a book of that title published in 1980.) As a specialist in crash/retrieval research, one might ask: Why not publish a book on Roswell by Stringfield? Frankly, I didn't do all the necessary field work like the others to qualify. However, I have played a backseat role in the gathering and release of new material from sources such as Sappho Henderson; Beverly Bean whose father, Sergeant Melvin Brown, was a member of the 509th retrieval team; and \"Tim\" which will be used by my contemporaries to mesh in sequentially with theirs. I begin my Roswell discourse with the Hendersons: the husband was the late Captain Oliver Wendelle Henderson known as \"Pappy\" among his crewmen in the 509th Bomb Wing and Sappho, his wife. In separate ways, each gave research not only new information about the incident, but for me, a new morale lift for my own endeavors. It was Pappy who transported the \"wreckage\" of the downed saucer from Roswell to Wright Field in 1947. Sappho, alas, knowing his secret, shared it with me for release in 1988 - with her name in my Status Report V. At first unwilling to go public with her address and phone number, which of course I respected, Stan Friedman who was chagrined at my loyalties managed to track her down, convincing her to appear on TV's Unsolved Mysteries September 20, 1989, for her insight commentary as part of the re-enactment of the incident. I'm glad for the enterprising Friedman and the credibility of Sappho for bringing in new sources. There is more to the Henderson story - new backups. One is a dentist and former Navy officer with whom Captain Henderson in a one-to-one exchange related their UFO experiences. The dentist, Dr. John Kromschroeder, who had witnessed a large orange globe hover over a fleet of warships at a Naval station "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"off coastal California during the Korean War in 1951 told me during a phone interview on February 4, 1990, that he regrets he did not press for more details about his friend's experience when they met in 1977. But he clearly recalls Henderson talking about his flight to Wright Field with the saucer wreckage. He also recalls his comment that bodies were retrieved, but is not sure if he said he had seen them. Another backup is Vere McCarthy, formerly a first lieutenant who served with Henderson as bombardier in 30 missions in the 446 Bomb Group of the 8th Air Force in WWII. When I phoned McCarthy, who had retired from the military as a captain following the war, he verified that he heard firsthand his friend's testimony about the secret flight to Wright Field. Remaining the best of friends after the war, he remembers getting a copy of a letter from Henderson of his commendation from General Spaatz and making mention of his new responsibilities and a special security clearance. Said McCarthy, \"Maybe that was the reason he was chosen to fly the sensitive material to Wright Field. Although we reunited on a number of occasions, we never discussed Roswell until we met in Nashville in 1982. In his hotel room when five of his old crew got together at our air division reunion - and making sure that our wives weren't present - he told his tory but did not go into much detail.\" I asked McCarthy if his former pilot had mentioned seeing the bodies, but he did not recall him saying that he did and added, \"However, he did say something to the effect that they were badly deteriorated from exposure and gnawed at by predators.\" McCarthy also recalls Henderson's comment about a civilian agency that took jurisdiction over the case from the military, but he did not name names. (More information will be in Status Report V , Case 10, initial reports regarding Henderson and other Roswell informants.) My source for sharing this segment of Roswellian backup is John Reynolds, a long-time correspondent and a vet from the old NICAP days. I received the following notes from Reynolds, May 2, 1990, which I have edited on his request to shield the identity of his source of command rank who, during their interview, brushed aside most leading questions because of the subject's Secret classification. The source will be called Jack. John Reynolds Notes from source, Jack: \"He affirms awareness, from fellow officers, of the shipment of a large crate on a flight piloted by Pappy Henderson whom he knew personally. Jack slated the reason Pappy made the flight was because he was the senior pilot at Roswell. \"When I first brought up the Roswell crash, Jack immediately said, 'Which one?' He was very evasive after that statement. ...It was a rhetorical cat and mouse game. I came away feeling he was honestly drying to help me understand the situation which he knows a lot about, but could not reveal in a direct manner.\" Len Stringfield: \"Which one?\" coming from a source in-the-know is a question that behooves Roswell scholars to dig deeper as new reports surface to suggest that possibly more than two crashes did occur in New Mexico in the 1947 time frame. Also challenging is the number of flights from Roswell with secret cargoes to other air bases and installations following the crash of July 2, 1947 (date could be July 3 or 4) on the Max Brazel ranch. Apart from the established Henderson flight to Wright Field and another with Major Jesse Marcel aboard a B-29 full of debris that he gathered on the ranch site, there are enough facts and rumors to believe that as many as nine secret flights between July 8-9, 1947, including a B-29 transporting a crate (that) possibly contained the retrieved bodies to an Army Air base in Ft. Worth, Texas. I have firsthand witnesses of this historic flight which follows. \"We Are Now A Part of History\" Shortly after my Status Report V, UFO Crash Retrievals: Is the Cover-up Lid"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Lifting? was published in the January 1989 issue of the MUFON UFO Journal - with new sources that revitalized my interest in crash/retrieval research - Barry Greenwood, Editor of Just Cause, sent me a copy of a letter he had received from a source of possible interest in my line of research. \"It's about Roswell,\" he said, which I knew he viewed with some skepticism at that time and promptly sent me a copy and the green light to follow up. On January 26, 2989, I contacted the source in a western state and in short time, he agreed to work with me. Preferring anonymity, we agreed that he would be identified as \"Tim.\" Excerpts from his \"introductory\" letter follow. Tim: \"On this day (July 9, 1947), our crew had not been on the flying roster. We had accomplished our period of ground school in the morning, then went to the skeet range after lunch. The Aircraft Commander had broken 48 targets and I was next with 47 out of the 50. The Sergeant in charge of the range asked us if we had heard about the 'flying disc' that had crashed out in the desert. Twice more before leaving the skeet range, we heard reports of a spaceship with bodies inside that had been found on a ranch in the area. When the truck dropped us off at the squadron area, most of the other crews had been released for the day. The operations officer told our captain to keep the crew together because he thought he had a flight for us. We expected this was a last-minute test hop on a plane needed for the next day's mission. I loved test hops, for on many of them, the pilot would let me be the co-pilot and sometimes I would get to make a landing. We were sent out to pre-flight our own airplane; we knew then it was no test flight. The pre-flight of a B-29 was a lengthy operation, requiring a visual pressure check of each engine's fuel system, plus many other details. An hour later, we were told to taxi the plane to the 'Pit,' a place where the atomic bomb was normally loaded. We were positioned so the front bomb-bay was directly over the pit which was covered with a large tarp. But no atomic bomb was in the pit that afternoon. When the canvas was removed by the loading crew, all we could see was a very large wooden box. We stood off to the side and were not allowed more than a glimpse of the loading process. The box was sitting on a platform of the type we often used on which to carry cargo. Once the load was secured in the bomb-bay, four military policemen went inside and took positions at each corner of the box. I think two of them were majors and one a lieutenant. The fourth man was an NCO. Three other officers of company and field grade were positioned in the forward and aft crew compartments. The officer crew members went to base operations for flight clearance and briefing. When they returned, only the bombardier was allowed to go in the bomb-bay and check the security of the load. The engineer and I had been given a cargo weight which I remember was no problem at all and no ballast was required in the tail. So, my guess now is that it was less than five thousand pounds. Once airborne, we were told the destination was the AAFB at Ft. Worth, Texas. By now, we were aware that this was no routine cargo mission. The rank and number of the MPs were clues that we had something important on board. One of our officers speculated that it was the household goods of some high-ranking ground pounder being transferred to Ft. Worth. This was a reasonable guess. I do not remember connecting it with the 'flying disc crash' story until we were on the way back. We left most of the security people in Ft. Worth. I think only one or maybe two came back with us. I do remember the strong lecture of this being a routine flight that we must not talk about. One of the crew, a very outspoken individual, said on the way home that we were now a 'part of history.' He went on to say he knew it was the disc and remains of the flight crew because he had seen a man he recognized in the reception group. This man was a mortician by military specialty. For weeks, rumors were plentiful and we were hard pressed to maintain the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"silence we had been ordered to keep.\" Len Stringfield: If indeed, Tim's flight transported the bodies, then it fits well into the scenario that postulates that his was one among several missions from Roswell. But to prove it, we might never have access to official records for obvious security reasons - if they still exist. According to Jesse Marcel, July 8, he flew in a B-29 to Ft. Worth. Notably, he identified his cargo - not as a crate, but as a \"half B-29-full\" of fragments he had collected from the crash site on the Max Brazel ranch. Once at the air base, his job was done. General Roger Ramey, in charge of the operations, released the story to the media that the downed saucer was actually a weather balloon and ordered Marcel to return to Roswell, which he did the following day on July 9, 1947. Of significance, Tim remembers Jesse Marcel. To refresh his memory, Tim was sent a copy of the 509th Bomb Group 1947 Yearbook and he recalled Marcel's presence on the scene. But Tim is not sure where. Tim said, \"It's possible that he (Marcel) was one of the officers to greet my plane at Ft. Worth, but my preferred guess is that he was on my return flight to Roswell.\" Based on known information, Marcel was probably unaware of the retrieved bodies at that time and would not have a need-to-know-qualification to greet the plane. Crucial then, in coordinating the sequence of events, is the date of Tim's flight. Understandably, blurred by the passage of time and without any official 509th records to substantiate such a secret mission, he was at first uncertain of the date. \"One clue, for sure,\" he said, \"the weather that day was sunny and hot during a season known for its thunderstorms.\" Then on October 5, 1990, Tim called. \"I found my diary. It was the 9th (of July, 1947.) I found the dates of my flights out of Roswell, clearly circles on the calendar inside the back cover which backs up my log entries for July 4th, 9th, 26th, 28th and 29th.\" Continued in Part 4.
