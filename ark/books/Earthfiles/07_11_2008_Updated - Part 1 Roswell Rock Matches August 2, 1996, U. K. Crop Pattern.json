Ridge, decided to go bow and arrow hunting for deer in Cedar Hill near Capitan Mountain, about 17 miles southwest of the alleged UFO crash of a wedge-shaped aerial vehicle between Corona and Roswell sixty-one years ago in July 4 to July 6, 1947. He has lived in Roswell the entire fifty years of his life and many times before had traveled to Cedar Hill to hunt deer. R oswell is larger red circle on far right.

Capitan is middle red circle and Corona is top center of map. Cedar Hill deer trail is 17 miles southeast of the July 4, 1947, crash site between Corona and Roswell. [ Editor's Note: Wikipedia - The Capitan Mountains are a mountain range in Lincoln County, in south central New Mexico. The range is about 20 miles (32 km) long from east to west and about 6 miles (10 km) wide, formed from a large, elongated granite intrusion similar to the round one that produced Carrizo Mountain to the west. The small town of Capitan, on the southwestern side of the mountains, is the location of Smokey Bear Historical Park, which memorializes the famous bear that was rescued from a wildfire in the Capitan Mountains. The highest point in the range is an unnamed peak that reaches 10,201 feet (3139 m), 118 feet (36 m) higher than Capitan Peak. The entirety of the range lies within Lincoln National Forest and is separated from the Sacramento Mountains to the south and Sierra Blanca to the southwest by the valley of Rio Bonito. The Spanish used to use this mountain range as a landmark because it was the only East to West mountain range in North America as they traveled to and from Santa Fe. ] Robert was following hoof tracks on a trail thinking they were deer. His head was down as he intently kept his eyes on the tracks when a brownish-red rock caught his attention about twelve feet away. Interview: Robert L. Ridge, Self-employed auto shop owner, Roswell, New Mexico: “But I didn’t pick it up right then. I went ahead with what I was doing (tracking). It turns out that what I was tracking was actually goats. So, when I found that out, I thought maybe I should go back and pick up that rock. So, I went back and found it and picked it up and that was probably about 2 o’clock in the afternoon on September 4 of 2004.

Image by Robert Ridge. WHEN YOU PICKED UP THE ROCK, WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST REACTION? Just curiosity. I was taken aback by the design and was awestruck by it. It was quite dirty. I got it back to the truck and brushed it off and was examining it in the sunlight at my truck. The first thought that came to my mind was that it looked like it had been done by the finger of God. That was my first impression of it because I could not understand how anybody else could have done it. CAN YOU GIVE SOME DESCRIPTION OF WHAT THE ROCK FEELS LIKE IN TERMS OF TEXTURE AND WEIGHT? I believe we weighed it at 50.78 grams and it’s very smooth to the touch. It’s quite heavy"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"for being small. It’s 1.96 inches (5 centimeters) by 1.69 inches (4.3 centimeters). CAN YOU SCRAPE IT, SCRATCH IT OR BREAK ANY PIECE OFF EASILY? No, it’s quite hard. HAVE YOU HAD THIS IN THE HANDS OF SOMEBODY WHO IS A METALLURGIST OR A GEOLOGIST TO SEE IF THEY COULD ESTIMATE WHAT IT’S MADE FROM? Yes, we had an x-ray analysis at Eastern New Mexico University (ENMU) in Portales and the geology department there scanned it to determine its makeup. [ Editor's Note: X-ray spectrometry done by James Constantopoulos, Ph.D., Chair, Department of Physical Sciences and Professor of Geology, Eastern New Mexico University (ENMU), Portales, New Mexico.] WHAT DID THEY FIND? It’s got a high content of iron and silica and traces of copper and a few other trace elements. [ Editor's Note: What is not clear is whether the iron content is magnetite, a naturally occurring ore in the Capitan Mountain region, which would attract a magnet. More analysis is planned in the future and Earthfiles will have an update when analysis is complete.] DID THEY CHOOSE X-RAY ANALYSIS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT BREAK OFF ANY PART OF THE ROCK? Correct. DID THE UNIVERSITY GEOLOGIST MAKE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT HOW THE PATTERN ON THIS HARD ROCK COULD HAVE BEEN MADE? It’s was February 2005 when we did this. To the best of my recollection, the anthropology department and geology department were pretty much agreed that they really had no idea how it could have been formed. Everything around it (pattern) has been taken away and exposed the pattern coming up out of it. It also has some beveling. In the circles and moons, part of the circles have a 90-degree backside, which is straight up and straight down. Then the front of the circles come down in 45-degree angles. That's why it looks beveled or sculpted. We had a sculptor and a ceramics artist look at it during the 4th of July 2008 Roswell festival. She said she had no idea how it could have been sculpted or reproduced herself. It’s pretty much a question mark right now. Rock Rotates Under Ma gnet The first time we ever put a magnet to it, I saw that the rock was reactive to the magnet. IN WHAT WAY? It spins. The rock will spin when you hold a magnet over the top of it, like over one circle, the rock spins counter-clockwise. Then if you hold the magnet over the other side of the other circle, the rock spins counter-clockwise. But, yesterday (July 9, 2008) when I went to a TV station, the rock wanted to spin clockwise when I demonstrated it for them. Nine times out of ten when I put a magnet over the top of the pattern side of the rock, the rock wants to spin counter-clockwise. But yesterday, for some unknown reason, it wanted to go clockwise. I can’t explain why that is. HOW CLOSE DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE THE MAGNET TO THE ROCK IN ORDER FOR IT TO SPIN? Very close, a quarter-inch away. When you put the rock underneath a compass, I can take the rock and move it in a circular motion and the needle of the compass will spin with the rock. IF THE ROCK IS ON A TABLE, AND YOU TAKE THE MAGNET FIRST OVER EITHER OF THE CRESCENT MOONS, THE ROCK WILL GENERALLY TURN EITHER CLOCKWISE OR COUNTER-CLOCKWISE."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Correct. THEN IF YOU PUT THE MAGNET DOWN AND PICK UP THE COMPASS AND PUT THE COMPASS OVER THE ROCK, THE ROCK DOES NOT SPIN AND ONLY THE COMPASS NEEDLE SPINS? Correct. Why Silence About the Patterned Rock Since September 4, 2004? YOU FOUND THIS ROCK ON SEPTEMBER 4, 2004, IN THE AFTERNOON WHILE YOU WERE BOW HUNTING DEER. Correct. WE HAVE NOT LEARNED ABOUT THIS UNTIL JULY 2008. WHAT HELD YOU BACK OVER THOSE FOUR YEARS? I knew it was something special. I kept it to myself basically for personal reasons. I fell in love, I guess you could say, with the rock and I didn’t really want to share it with people. I’m a pretty private person and I was trying to get all my ducks in a row for what might happen when I did finally show it to the public. I didn’t want people to think I was in it for monetary gain. That’s basically why I’ve waited this long. ARE YOU KEEPING THE ROCK ON A DAILY BASIS IN SOMETHING LIKE A SAFETY DEPOSIT BOX? Yes, most of the time. I take it out from time to time when a relative or someone wants to see it. WHAT DO YOU SAY TO PEOPLE WHO SAY THIS MUST BE A HOAX? THIS IS SOMETHING SOMEONE HAS PLANTED FOR PUBLICITY BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE THE 1996 ENGLISH CROP FORMATION? I just say to them that unfortunately I was by myself that day when I found it, but it would be up to them to prove it’s a hoax. We’re trying to prove that it is not, but we have exhausted most of our energies up to now trying to find something that would replicate the rock. We haven’t been able to find anyone who says they could make something like that. It would be such a fluke for someone to plant it and hope that someone finds it out there in the middle of nowhere. If you planted something like that, it might be 100 years before someone found it! Comparison of Roswell Rock to August 2, 1996, U. K. Crop Formation IF A CROP FORMATION WAS PHOTOGRAPHED AND WAS AVAILABLE AT CROPCIRCLECONNECTOR.COM TO SEE IN AUGUST 1996, WHY COULDN’T SOMEBODY HAVE COPIED THAT AND PUT IT ON A STONE AND DEPOSITED IT IN CEDAR HILL, NEW MEXICO, IN 2004? Well, I guess anything is possible. You can’t really have a closed mind and say that would be impossible. But I would say very improbable as far as we know up to this date. IN TERMS OF THE ISOLATION OF THE AREA WHERE YOU WERE DEER HUNTING WITH A BOW AND ARROW, IS CEDAR HILL AND THAT DEER HUNTING AREA, IS IT LARGELY RURAL? HOW MANY PEOPLE IN A YEAR MIGHT VISIT THERE? It’s mostly hunters that go in there. There’s not really a whole lot to see and do in there unless you are hunting. I really couldn’t give you an idea of how many people go in there over a year. I’m sure it varies year-to-year, but it’s probably 40 miles from Roswell. There are a few ranch houses in the area. WHICH DIRECTION FROM THE 1947 UFO CRASH SITE? It would be southeast 17 miles."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"YOU HAVE BEEN GOING THERE TO HUNT EVERY SEPTEMBER? Not every September. I used to go in there quite a bit several years ago and then we started (going deer hunting) in a different area. I haven’t been hunting in Cedar Hill for quite a number of years. SO, 2004 WAS THE FIRST YEAR YOU RETURNED? Yes, since about 1995. IS THERE SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AREA WHERE IF THIS ROCK WITH THIS IMPRINT HAD BEEN UNDER BUSHES OR SLIGHTLY UNDER THE DIRT FROM 60 YEARS AGO, IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE GEOGRAPHY OF THAT AREA THAT COULD EXPLAIN WHY THE ROCK WOULD SUDDENLY BE EXPOSED IN SEPTEMBER 2004? It’s a sandy area. You know how the wind blows out here. The sand shifts and covers and uncovers things on a regular basis. I believe there is an unusual magnetic field in that area. OF CEDAR HILL AND CAPITAN MOUNTAIN? Yes. If you get in the right spot on the mountain, you can see a trench coming off the top of the mountain. The debris there is all kinds of hematite and magnetite on that side of the mountain. [ Editor's Note: UFO investigator Dennis Balthaser writes in his Truth Seeker At Roswell website about another UFO crash site “about 43 miles straight line distance west of Roswell, in the Capitan mountains. It's approximately 3 miles south of the Pine Lodge Road (Highway 246), which runs from Roswell west to Capitan, New Mexico. “R agsdale Impact Site” is at Capitan Peak west of the Cedar Hill deer trail. Map by Dennis Balthaser. Ragsdale claims to have been at Boy Scout mountain with a woman friend when, and I quote, ‘We were lying in the back of my pickup truck, buck naked, drinking beer, and having a good ole time when about 11:30 the night of July 4, 1947, all hell broke loose.’ Ragsdale says looking toward the north/northwest he saw a flash in the sky brighter than a welder's arc, and something fiery coming toward their campground. He actually thought it was going to hit the campground, taking off the tops of trees as it came in, crashing about 60 yards from his pickup. Ragsdale - in his story first made public in 1993 - went into detail about the bodies, which he referred to as little people and a vivid description of what the inside of the craft looked like. A few of the problems encountered by researchers with Ragsdale's story was the fact that he gave two different statements of his account on two separate affidavits. So the Ragsdale story, although no longer verifiable by him after he died in 1995, also remains questionable until further documented proof is brought forward in research of his alleged crash site and whatever connection it might have had with the Roswell Incident.” ]"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Robert Ridge's November 5, 1995, UFO Sighting HAVE YOU EVER IN YOUR FIFTY YEARS HAD ANY INTERACTION WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS A DISC-SHAPED CRAFT? Ye s . CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT? Yeah. It was November 5, 1995, 4:30 AM. I remember it like it was yesterday. We were headed out east of town and that morning was a harvest moon. It was the most beautiful moonset that I probably have ever seen in my life. There’s a little valley east of town here. You have to climb a hill before you can drop off into the valley. We had just gone over the hill into the valley. As soon as we popped over the hill about ten miles out of Roswell, from the north – which would be to our left – came a silver object over into the valley with us kind of, and it was moving at a super high rate of speed. And it was leaving a vapor trail behind it. This vapor trail was probably bigger than the craft itself and long after the craft itself was gone, the vapor trail hung in that valley and it was this brilliant orange color b ecause the moon was still shining on it. The vapor trail just sat there and churned inside itself. It was sparkling like little firecrackers going off in it, like phosphorous burning inside the vapor trail. It was spectacular and something to see! The craft was more of a triangle shape though. WHEN YOU SAY TRIANGLE, CAN YOU DESCRIBE IT IN MORE DETAIL? It was more of say a half diamond-type shape. I believe if the moon hadn’t been like it was that morning (orange harvest moon), that everything would have been silver and white. The vapor trail would have been white and the craft would have been silver, but with that harvest moon shining on it, it was all a brilliant orange color. GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS LEAKED IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS TO WWW.MAJESTIC.COM STATE THAT AT LEAST THREE UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL OBJECTS THAT CRASHED BETWEEN CORONA AND ROSWELL, EAST OF ALAMAGORDO AND AT WHITE SANDS WERE NOT DISC-SHAPED. THEY ARE DESCRIBED AS ‘WEDGE-SHAPED.’ Yes, that would be what I saw. LIKE A PIECE OF PIE. Ye s . ” C ontinued in Part 2 - 1996 U. K.
