Return to Part 1 To be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 14 of Status Report III, written in June 1982. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report IV begins at Earthfiles 021205 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Leonard H. Stringfield: THE OMNIPRESENT I.I.I. \"Always present in my work is the I.I.I., or less cryptically, the 'Invisible Inside Informant.' New ones surface from time to time as old ones fade away. Sometimes on my wish, like a storybook genie, they respond with supposedly 'inside' UFO information ostensibly to help my cause in research. Usually, known by only a first name or as in one case, just as 'Uncle,' their backgrounds as UFO savants vary. Some allegedly serve, or have served, in the Intelligence community. One is a medical doctor and some are too shifty to be pinned down. The I.I.I. are always polite, are not always readily reachable and are evasive when I ask for a one-to-one meeting. As to their motives, I can only guess. Maybe some are just tired of secrecy and genuinely want to help. But others I can see as plants who are a part of a plan to either spoon feed information as a test of public reaction or are to set up a disinformation trap. In the end of the spectrum is the KGB who is interested in the progress of a duplication of a saucer-like craft by the U. S. military. Surprisingly, the general track record of the I. I. I. is good. Information related is often corroborative and sometimes scarily right on target. Sometimes even their advisement seems sincerely helpful. For instance, the last word I had from Robert Barry's C. I. A. source was to stay out of the 'photo fight' (in references to the alien cadaver photos). 'They're all fakes,' he said. Previously this source intimated that the U. S., through NASA, had cooperated with Russia on the evaluation of a movie film showing UFOs in flight near their Salyut 6 space station. He also had informed me that 80% of the material in my paper (1978) was correct and predicted that I would face threats while delivering that paper in Dayton, Ohio. A more recent 'Insider' known as 'Uncle,' who spoke through an intermediary, said that I was on the right track in my research, but cautioned that many reports I had received were disinformation. He also said that I would never be able to prove my C/R case without the 'hard stuff' which I would never get. Other notable points follow: 1. Possessing a photo of a maimed alien cadaver, he admitted that his knowledge of its biological structure made him turn to atheism. 2. He believed that UFOs were not of a benign nature; that he knew of one case in Texas where people had been mutilated in like manner as the classical cattle mutilation cases. 3. That the Kecksburg case (Item B-1 in Status Report II ) involved a crashed spy plane, not a UFO. He also averred that the Ft. Riley incident (Case A-8 in Status Report II ) and the crash in Johannesburg, South Africa, were true. I note here that my C.I.A. informant also had confirmed the Ft. Riley and Johannesburg cases. (See Case A-6, Status Report II ). "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"4) He also said that AF interceptors fired on a UFO over Washington, D. C., in 1952, and believed that the reported UFO crash in Spitzbergen was a result of damage during that engagement. Several sources gravitating into my realm of research have related firsthand knowledge of genetic experiments supposedly in league with UFO phenomena. One source in 1978 offered proof of a cyborg experiment - x-rays, medical records and so on. I received by mail some military medical records, but the promised x-rays wrapped protectively never arrived by mail nor were they delivered in person as he had arranged. On this same tack, another source claimed he had been used in a genetic experiment which tied in with the aliens. Then in recent correspondence from his confidante, I was told he was visited by a strange appearing female who shared her great wisdom about UFOs and space, which nearly scared him out of research. Still another person who knew about a hospital 'out west' which was involved in genetic experiments made urgent plans to meet me and never followed up. Other Insiders of a less dramatic posture have told me of hidden UFO secrets underground in Colorado; of saucer-like craft that are 'ours' flying experimentally at Nellis AFB and at a secret base in New Mexico; of underwater UFO bases; of decipherable communications with aliens, ad infinitum. Many things have been said about UFOs by the Collective I.I.I. which are beyond the scope of this paper. If any of the points they have stressed are true, then the UFO is serious business and perhaps, according to official rationale, a good reason for silence. The medical or the journalistic model will not help in dealing with the I.I.I. They are covert and most, I believe, are legitimate insiders. Again, I don't know their respective motives and probably never will. POSTSCRIPT ON TWO KEY CASES Most case histories cited in my two previous Status Reports remain essentially unchanged as most sources are no longer accessible for questioning. In two key cases, however, new data have surfaced as follows: 1) Kingman, Arizona, 1953: First investigated and reported by researcher and author Ray Fowler. See pages 178-185 in Situation Red, The UFO Siege , Doubleday, 1977; and see Abstract 6 in Retrievals of the Third Kind. On August 11, 1980, I wrote to Fowler seeking permission to question his source, Fritz Werner (pseudonym) concerning his experience in the Kingman, Arizona, retrieval operation. My questions and Werner's answers, dated September 2, 1980, follow: September 2, 1980, Written Q & A with Fritz Werner: 'Q: Details of observed facial features of the deceased entity, such as ear lobes, nose, mouth, eyes, neck, head size and shape. A: Since it's been 27 years, details like this are pretty foggy and I may even be influenced by other descriptions I've seen or heard in the interim. In short, I don't really remember any earlobes. Eyes, I did not see. Head shape was oval. Nose, I don't recall one. Q: Other body features such as arm length, hands, fingers, shoulders (square or rounded ) uniform, feet and so on. A: Body very slender. Overall, quite small. Arms disproportionately long by human standards. Q: Was protective clothing worn by investigators on scene of crash? Any explanation why such protective clothing would not be standard procedure during exposure to alleged alien craft and bodies? A: No protective clothing. We were 'scanned' for radiation, however. Negative. No explanation why no protective clothing. Q: Were you and others checked medically following exposure to craft and bodies? A: Yes. No apparent bad effects. Q: Were special guards assigned to guard tent where the alien body was held? A: Yes. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Q: Was an attendant medic in tent with the recovered body? It seems that such a precious 'cargo' would be under constant scrutiny. Any dry ice on the premises? A: Don't know. There were others in the tent. Q: Any official cameramen on the scene? A: Didn't see a photographer, but I'd be greatly surprised if there was none. Q: Any visits, since original disclosures, by authorities to remind you of your secrecy oath? A: Only once. About a month after the incident and that was by phone. Q: Any knowledge or rumors of cause of the crashed craft? A: No. Q: A former C.I.A. employee related to me through Robert Barry that parts of your disclosure were 'embellished' or 'just story.' He did not explain what parts. Can you clarify or describe any 'gray areas' in my published report in my paper, Retrievals of The Third Kind ? A: Did not read the referenced article. Postscript: Don't wish to talk to anyone just yet. Think there is 'something going on, however, particularly in nature. I believe in the next 5 to 10 years, 'nature' is going to unleash a series of phenomena (such as Mt. St. Helen's) which in some cases will be disastrous. Have feeling that UFOs, psychic phenomena and these 'nature' occurrences are connected. 2) The Lumberton, Ohio, case, Spring 1977: Alleged skirmish between U.S. military forces and landed (or disabled) alien craft. See Case B-13 in Status Report II . The so-called Lumberton incident is vague, elusive, sensitive. One Cincinnati investigator (name withheld on request), intrigued by the report, decided to sleuth for more information on his own. He said that he managed to talk to the Sheriff in the suspect area, who promptly claimed that he had been ill and off duty during Spring of 1977 and there was nothing in his records about a UFO encounter. A more recent investigation into the case by the intermediary of 'Uncle' (see Omnipresent I.I.I. in this report) brought more positive results. According to his version, he made an arrangement with a police officer of influence who claimed to be in a position to check the records. By March 21, 1982, my intermediary reported that his friend learned enough from his 'contacts' to confirm the incident. He pinpointed the scene of action as being closer to Wilmington than Lumberton and that there were casualties. Regarding the latter, he was vague, claiming it was law enforcement personnel, not military. After the confrontation, the officer learned the craft lifted off and disappeared. Said my intermediary from Beavercreek, Ohio: 'He (the officer) knows a lot about the case and I think he's willing to talk about it. But he has to be careful.' I pressed for an early meeting, guaranteed anonymity, and waited for my middleman to name the time and place. On April 5, 1982, I got my call. As expected, my intermediary somberly announced that his sleuthing police officer had a bad UFO experience and won't talk. 'He's been scared out of his wits,' he said. 'In March a UFO attacked his patrol car, burned the roof ... (thus) threatened (he contemplated) to pack up and leave his home, his job, everything.' I said, 'Now I've heard everything,' feeling almost unimpassioned by the turn of events. Later, I thought of the Sheriff who claimed illness during the Wilmington episode, and I wondered about the story given me by the prying police officer and if he really had his UFO experience that he claimed? Or was he was frightened off by another kind of interloper? On May 27, 1982, as I finished writing this Status Report III, I called my intermediary for the latest on the newly named Wilmington case. 'It did happen,' he emphasized, 'and there were injuries to law enforcement personnel, but the military came into the affair later, after the incident.' "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"When he said he had not heard from his police officer friend in recent weeks, I tossed in the notion that he (officer) probably got his 'hands spanked' by a superior and that he made up his UFO encounter as an excuse to bow out. My informant agreed. THE HYPOTHETICAL ALIEN My medical informants on staff of a major hospital, who in 1979 provided extraordinary information for Status Report II (See Case A-7 of that paper), have since late 1980 been silenced. One was a pathologist who allegedly performed an autopsy on an alien body. He related that he could no longer collaborate on the subject. His last message, however, reiterated through his colleague, concerned a hypothesis which postulated that early man - possibly Cro-Magnon or before - had been genetically altered or hybridized with an alien of superior intelligence to form Homo sapiens. According to his rationale, atrophied human-like organs such as evidenced in the alien's genitals, suggested Earth-related evolutionary ties that are beyond coincidence. In essence, according to the pathologist, primeval Earth had become an experimental test tube for a new race whose development required periodic watching. Provocatively, the hypothesis which was presented at a secret high-level medical conference (with Russian attendance) does answer a lot of basic questions about the UFO; i.e., their cyclic visitation, some Biblical events, the lack of open communication, the lack of overt hostility, and a plausible explanation for abductions of random subjects for what seems to be physical examinations. Also, it would explain the prolonged high level international secrecy. If world governments have medical and other back-up evidence to support the hypothesis, then the posture of silence takes on new meaning. Perhaps they assume that Man's concept of himself in his world would be shattered. In the absence of firm evidence needed to convince research that the Homo sapiens is a hybrid, there is no shortage of speculative information about early extraterrestrial visitation. Their possible exploits and influence about in Biblical times and in the cultures of the Maya, Inca and Aztec. China, too, has its story of a mysterious anthropological find. This one of evolutionary significance allegedly goes back 12,000 years to an 'ugly' offshoot race. Researcher Clark McClelland spent time in his Pittsburgh library and pieced together the Chinese Connection from various Russian papers, including a 1963 issue of the magazine, Sputnik . His notes follow: Clark McClelland on the E.T. and Chinese Connection: 'In 1937-1938, a Chinese archaeologist, Chi Pu Tei, made what has been called an extraordinary discovery according to Professor Alexander Kazantsev and Professor Vyatcheslav Zaitsev of the Soviet Union. During the expedition into the isolated Payenk Ara Shaan (mountains) in China, archaeologist Chi Pu Tei and a group of students entered several caves of great antiquity and discovered over 700 disc-shaped stone tablets consisting of double- grooved lines. They looked similar to present-day phonograph records, even having a hole in the center. But they were of a less refined quality and much larger in size. They were later found to contain a strange style of spiral writing that does not otherwise exist in China or anywhere in the world. Another unique discovery is that in the remote area (where) these ancient records were discovered (according to a report by Soviet scientist Zaitsev) live two tribes, the Khams and Dropas, who are pygmy-like people with larger than usual heads and are difficult ethnically to classify. They are different from Chinese, Tibetans and Mongols. In the caves where the disc tablets were found, small ancient graves were also discovered aligned in neat rows. The unusual skeletons in those graves were all humanoid of small proportioned creatures with large skulls. Their average height was 5 feet. Also, according to Chi Pu Tei, on some cave walls were found painted astronomical formations of the sun, moon and star groupings and many small open dots shown converging on earth and in a direction that leads to a mountain region. Perhaps the dots indicate the route of alien craft. Present information indicates the skeletons and paints are at least 12,000 years old. In 1962, Tsum Um Nui, professor at the Peking Academy of Prehistoric Research, announced that he had deciphered some of the grooved symbols that he discovered on several discs that had been brought back from the earlier expedition by Chi Pu Tei. Associating this with local legend, he released the following account which was eventually published in a German journal, Das Vegetarishe Universe. His story states: About 12,000 years ago a group of living things which were very"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ugly (this statement is from local legend and a literal interpretation) landed their craft (on earth). They were hunted by the local people and hid in caves. Later the local inhabitants returned with gifts making efforts to be peaceful. But when some of them (the creatures) emerged from the caves, they were immediately killed because of their ugliness. Other Chinese legends tell of little yellow creatures that came down from the stars. They had big heads and small bodies and were so ugly that local inhabitants attacked them. According to Dr. Zaitzev, a couple of these stone discs were secretly sent to Moscow and several scientists were assigned to study the discs and elaborate on their composition. They found the discs are 0.8 meters in diameter and 2.0 centimeters thick (approximately 31.5 inches in diameter by 7/8 inches thick). Each disc has double grooved indentations on which are engraved tiny symbols. When tested, each disc was found to be granite with a high content of cobalt and aluminum and a highly resonant frequency indicating they may all be carrying an electrical charge. Since granite is largely composed of silicates and cobalt in metal with properties of magnetism and corrosion-free, these stone discs could practically last forever. These embedded alloys of silicon, cobalt and aluminum which are found as part of the spiral grooves could very possibly form an electronic recording capability similar to that used in present-day magnetic recording machines. Let us consider this theory. Perhaps these strange discs carry two messages: one written in symbols on the grooves and perhaps sounds or information recorded within the electrical charges. If true, it could be in the language of its original creators - the frail creatures with large heads in myth and legend.' While out hypothetical alien lies on his alleged cold slab somewhere in secret custody, we are left only to guess about other key parts of his physiological structure such as the brain, the reproductive organs or what the Thing ingests for sustenance. When my prime medical source went silent, there was an 18-month gap before a new medically informed insider of the I.I.I.-type emerged. He not only hastened to confirm the general data related by my medical source, but added that the alien without a digestive track thrives by the absorption of electrical energy. Curious as to particulars, I tried to get my intermediary to reach his 'Uncle' for more details. But like others who claim to have served in the Wright-Patterson Inner Sanctum, he never resurfaced. The Alien Hand Pondering all the gaps in the alien's anatomical puzzle, curiously it is the hand with four fingers, webbing and no opposable thumb that is described most often by diverse sources. Here, I must go back to my first and second status reports [ Status Report I and II , to be reprinted in upcoming Earthfiles. ] which include drawings of an alien hand structure based on information from several firsthand observers. One of my sources (allegedly C.I.A.), when he reviewed my drawing prior to the release of my first paper in Dayton in July 1978, suggested that I remove a knobby protuberance which I had sketched in at the normal thumb joint of the hand. He commented that my rendition bore a likeness to the hands he had seen on the two bodies in his 1962 retrieval. See drawing below. When Status Report II was released through MUFON in January 1980, the influx of information about UFO crash/retrievals was nearing its peak. During this period of euphoria, I received a photograph from a source showing a close-up of a skeletal hand that was strikingly similar to my drawing. In the photo was a claw-like appendage with indistinct webbing between each gnarled digit, joined to a thick, swivel-like wrist on an arm, sharply bent at the elbow, which joined a bulbous socket at the collar bone and a hulk of anthropoid rib cage. According to my source, the specimen was found in primordial shale and was procured by the U. S. Air Force in Florida, sent to Wright-Patterson and finally shipped to a university in Pennsylvania where it is preserved for 'secret study in a grotto lab.' "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Photo reprints showing skeletal remains of a creature unknown to science, found allegedly in shale. According to my source, the specimen was sent to a university in Pennsylvania by the U. S. Air Force for secret study. Left print which I originally received seemed to me that it was clipped off of a photo showing more of the remains. When I questioned this and requested more detail, I received the photo at Right , which shows the clavicle or the collarbone and what appears to be the creature's extended right arm (as if entity laying on stomach). Curiously, the head is either missing from the skeletal remains or I was not permitted to have a full-view photo in my possession, for reasons unexplained. Information about the hand of the alleged alien, as sparse as it is from firsthand witnesses, may provide some biological clues. The webbing, for instance, suggests that the creature is amphibian which may further find plausibility in that the epidermis is so often described as scaly or reptilian. This brings to mind a creature dubbed 'dinosaur man,' imagined by Dr. Dale Russell, Chief of Paleontology at the National Museum of Natural History in Ottawa, Canada. [ Editor's Note: RUSSELL, DALE A. Dr. Dale Alan Russell is a vertebrate paleontologist and author. He is a Research Professor at North Carolina State University and Senior Curator of Paleontology at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. Russell has named the following dinosaurs: Alxasaurus (Russell and Dong, 1994), Archaeornithomimus (1972), Atlasaurus (Monbaron, Russell and Taquet, 1999), Cristatusaurus (Taquet and Russell, 1998), Daspletosaurus (1970), Dromiceiomimus (1972), Dyslocosaurus (McIntosh, Coombs and Russell, 1992), Lurdusaurus (Taquet and Russell, 1999), Sigilmassasaurus (Russell, 1996), and Sinornithoides (Russell and Dong, 1994). Russell has written many papers and books, including, \" Odyssey in Time: The Dinosaurs of North America\" 1989 and \" Systematics and Morphology of American Mosasaurs\" (1967). In 1971, Russell and the physicist Wallace Tucker published a paper (in the journal Nature) called \" Supernovae and the extinction of the dinosaurs,\" which theorized that a supernova caused the K-T Extinction. This was the first theory to put the blame on an extra-terrestrial phenomenon. ] Model of a dinosauroid with the reconstruction of Stenonychosaurus behind. Conceived by Dale A. Russell in 1981 and created by Ron Sequin in 1982, The National Museum of Natural Science, Ottawa, Canada. "},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"\"Dinosauroid.\" Sculpture by Dale Russell and Ron Seguin, 1982, Canadian Museum of Nature, Ottaw a, Canada. Source: The Encyclopedia of Astrobiology, Astronomy, and Spaceflight . Leonard Stringfield: \" Before Russell's hypothetical dinosaur made news in 1981, I had received from the scientist in July 1980 two scholarly papers: The Evolution of Intelligence on Earth and Reflections of the Dinosaurian World. Both papers were useful to me in understanding the biology of early Earth. Of note, during a 1981 interview, Russell expounded that UFO aliens from outer space may have descended from a super smart dinosaur like the kind that roamed our Earth eons ago. He was also quoted as saying, 'It is quite legitimate to assume that on other planets dinosaurs lived on to become humanoid beings with the high intelligence n ecessary for interplanetary travel.' Corroborative information came from Ted Phillips, a specialist in UFO physical trace research for CUFOS (Center for UFO Studies) and MUFON (Mutual UFO Network). When Phillips saw my drawing during a meeting at the United Nations, hosted by Prime Minister Gairy of Grenada (with Drs. Hynek, Saunders, Vallee, Pohar of France, and astronaut Gordon Cooper), he was 'shocked out of my seat.' Ted compared its likeness to an alien hand appearing in a photograph he had seen from a reliable source. See statement Page 34, Status Report II. If the freak skeleton is not another 'Piltdown Man' hoax, the problem is finding its link in pre-history. And if not a hoax, is it a vestige of experimental genetics eons ago to which my medical informant had alluded? And in comment, why should a skeleton of something extinct be kept secret? In an attempt to get professional opinion on the skeleton, I took the 'hand-rib cage' photograph to Dr. Anthony J. Perzigian, Ph.D., Anthropologist at the University of Cincinnati. His response by letter was dated November 15, 1980, and follows: November 15, 1980, letter from Anthropologist Anthony J. Perzigian, Ph.D., University of Cincinnati: 'Earlier this month at your and Professor Harry Mark's request, I examined photographs in your possession. Pictured were some unusual kind of creature which gave the appearance of having a simian-like (or ape-like) thoracic anatomy at least insofar as one could tell from the rib cage. The limbs, however, displayed no particular simian-like features. The upper arm was significantly longer than the forearm in proportions one does not see in apes. The carpal or wrist region was quite indistinct; the hands gave the appearance of having fewer than five fingers; the fingers seemed to have claws instead of the more common nails one finds among higher primates. 'This organism, if it is just that, is quite peculiar and one that I cannot classify as to genus and species. Moreover, I would hesitate, on the basis of a photo or two, to suggest that it is some extra-terrestrial form vis a vis a fabrication. Best of luck in your work.' During the spell when many of my sources were silent, many researchers pledged their moral support. Others offered professional help. Al Reed, artist in Sunnyvale, California, offered both. On the hope that I could get more physiological details from my medical sources, he rendered an elaborate set of illustrations of the hand and wrist showing hypothetical bone structure with flesh overlays in color. But at this point in time, my medical informant had dried up and without his expertise, the project was aborted. Some of Reed's renderings are shown below. I hope for further guidelines by my medical source who allegedly performed an autopsy on an alien body in early 1950s."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":" Uppe r le ft Drawing 1 is a sketch of the hand that I (Len Stringfield) drew for the critical view of a former C.I.A. employee in 1978, who claimed to have seen deceased aliens during a recovery in New Mexico, 1962.
