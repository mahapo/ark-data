Others who have interacted with the \"standing up reptiles\" say the sexual activities of those creatures are for self-gratification, as Howard describes in Parts 3 and 4.] Part 4 - Inte rvie w with \"Howard,\" Compute r Ne twork Administrator, Orlando, Florida: \"IT SOUNDED LIKE YOU WERE TRYING TO TURN AROUND TO CONFRONT THE SOLDIER LIZARD AND THERE WAS A LOT OF PHYSICAL STRESS. WAS THE LIZARD INSIDE OF YOU THAT WHOLE PERIOD OF TIME WHEN YOU KEPT TURNING AROUND? Yes. SO HE NEVER WITHDREW? No. During all of that time, he had his left arm back around my upper chest holding me up beneath the arms. He never disconnected from me. He never even broke rhythm. HE WAS MOVING HIS BODY AND MOVING HIS PENIS INSIDE OF YOUR RECTUM? That's correct. FOR HOW LONG, DO YOU THINK? I was only awake at that time for about five minutes. There was some burning in the very beginning when I was coming to not just a burning from (rectum) opening like it shouldn't. But burning like acid, like they had a chemical on them that burned. BURNED YOUR FLESH FROM HIS PENIS? Correct. SO, THERE'S A FIRST EJACULATION. THE LIZARD KEEPS ON GOING AS IF IT WANTS TO ACCOMPLISH SOMETHING BEYOND THAT FIRST EJACULATION, RIGHT? It wasn't interested in collecting a sample. It was interested in what it was doing. That's my point. It was entertainment! OK, YOU'VE EJACULATED, BUT THE LIZARD HAS NOT EJACULATED? "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I don't know. I couldn't answer that one way or the other' BUT HE STAYED INSIDE OF YOU. WHEN YOU WERE YELLING, 'IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, GET BEHIND ME, SATAN!' WERE YOU TURNED SAYING THAT FACE TO FACE? Yes, face to face. I turned around and looked at him dead in the face, six inches away, nose to nose. HE'S STILL INSIDE OF YOU. Yes, and he didn't even blink. When I turned around and first opened my mouth up to him and said, 'In Jesus's name, Satan get behi nd me!' I got a reaction and I thought, 'Wow, this guy knows who Jesus is.' This was all in a split second. But actually it was reaching for the remote and it was just seeing if I was going to attack him or not. That was the impression. If I was going to go ahead and jump on him, he was going to hit me with the remote. But if I wasn't, then he wasn't either. NOW, I CAN SEE AGAIN WHY IT WAS SO FUNNY ON ANOTHER LEVEL THAT LITERALLY 'SATAN WAS BEHIND YOU' - AND IN YOU. That's why I started to laugh. I had a stream of emotions. Laughter, crying, disbelief, a whole bunch of emotions that ran through me. I'd never had an experience like that in my life. Thank God. DO YOU REMEMBER THE LIZARD DOING ANYTHING DIFFERENTLY AROUND THE SECOND EJACULATION YOU EXPERIENCED? No, but I do remember saying, 'Oh, God, not now!' Because it was at this point remember I said I was looking at my friend he was watching me. I don't know how if you are two guys and you are having this bad taboo thing happen to you. It's embarrassing enough, but to ejaculate and have your friend see you do it! And the things he might be thinking of you. And you can't even control yourself. You don't w ant to do it, but you cannot help but do it. So, I said, 'Oh, God, not now!' For that reason. THEN WHAT HAPPENED? I passed out. I think the soldier hit me with that remote and that was it. After I started to weep. DID YOU BEGIN TO WEEP WHEN YOU SAID, 'OH, GOD, NOT NOW?' I remember it was at that point that I passed out was when I was crying. That was after all that had transpired and it was when my friend said, 'Go to a happy place.' I said, 'That's what I'm doing.' I realized there was nothing I could do about the situation and decided to accept it. Then the final emotion was crying, despair, hopelessness. Torture. YOU BLACK OUT AND WHAT HAPPENS NEXT? Then we both awoke standing on the ground. We never saw the UFO leave. We were just standing there about fifteen feet away. That's not where we were before. We had left the doors open and were almost getting in the car with our hands on top of the car when we had gone into the ship. Now we were standing fifteen feet away and the doors are closed. It was kind of bewildering. I want to add here that the car doors had been closed by our friends who owned the house (where Howard and buddy had arrived for visit). They had come out after an hour after they thought we were gone. When we finally got there to the house (after the experience inside craft with lizards), they were saying, 'You idiots, your car was right in the middle of the road. You left your doors open. We had to shut your doors and push the car up (on driveway).' WHERE WAS THE COW? It was in front of the car to the right about ten, fifteen feet. HAD YOUR FRIENDS SEEN THE ANIMAL? Oh, yeah. Let me give you the story here. When we got on the ground and were standing up, we hadn't seen the UFO leave. We were dazed much like somebody knocked the wind out of you and you woke up. So, you sort of feel like you are waking up in the morning, but you are in the middle of the afternoon, but you're looking around and standing up wide awake. But still feeling a little drugged, not knowing where you are, what time it i s, that ki nd of thi ng."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Then right immediately after that, we said, 'What the hell are we doing here? Oh, we were going to go get cigarettes.' And we started walking to the car. Then we stopped and said, 'Did we just see a UFO?' My friend said, 'Yeah, I think so. It was green, right? And we saw lizards, right?' And we looked at each other and I said, 'Yeah, lizards.' He goes, 'How's your leg?' I instincti vely reached behind me to check something that w as bothering me, but it w asn't the back of my leg which he saw the tail hit. It was my butt. I was grabbing my butt and it was wet. I do remember that. My friend saw me and here's another male, macho embarrassment. He's seeing me reach for what is supposed to be the back of my leg and he sees me grab my butt. His eyes go wide like he remembers what happened. Then I quickly move my hands back down and I said, 'It's OK.' And neither of us said anything. Then, we're like, 'Oh, my God! We've got to go tell our friends. Well, shit, I really need a cigarette. I REALLY need a cigarette right now!' We both agreed that we needed cigarettes. So we go to the store and get cigarettes and come back. Just still soaking in fragments of visions that are coming into our head about what had just happened, like sorting through i t, you know ? Not remembering everything, but the major details: the UFO, the lizards and the last thing we remembered was the animal. So, we went up to the house and it was our friends who owned the house, one of our best friends. Then the sister's younger friends, three or four years younger, and w e weren't talking to them. I came in blurting out, 'Oh, my God, we just got abducted by aliens!' They all looked at me like, 'Oh, yeah, sure.' (sarcastic) But they saw the looks on our faces and we were totally serious. When I started to get upset that they weren't listening to what I was saying, they started to listen a bit more. Then the younger girls were saying, 'Oh, you're bringing us down. We w ere going to try to have a party. No one w ants to hear this. Who cares?' That really upset me. I said, 'Look, I'll call the police. You want me to show you how serious I am, I'll call the police. Give me the phone.' They gave me the phone and I'm starting to dial the police. When I picked up, they grabbed the phone away and said, 'OK, I believe you.' I think there was some underage drinking there and they didn't want to get caught. So, I said, 'Wait a minute there's a dead animal! It (UFO and lizards) killed something out there and it should be there, right? OK, let's go look. Grab a flashlight.' It was me and my friend who was with me during this happening and two others - the owners of the house, our good friends. And we all walked to the end of the driveway and there was the animal at the side. I just remember a brief vision of my friends shining the light and seeing the side of lips and face cut off, much like I've seen in the animal mutilation photos. We didn't get a real look around the cow. It was black and it was harder to see and it was at night by then outside. I wasn't concerned with what the cow looked like at that point. I was just elated that the cow was there and my friend could see it and what I had told them was true and verifiable and a fact right before their eyes. At that point, they realized, 'OK, we've got to accept it. Here it is.' So, we went back into the house and I tried to talk to them more about what had happened. My friend who was with me during the experience didn't say a word. He didn't want to talk about it. 'It never happened' kind of thing, almost instantaneously. But I wanted to tell the world! Yet, when I had started to dial for the police, I remembered what kind of society we live in and what happens to people who tell stories such as the one that happened to me. I might end up in a white jacket in some place or worse. And what was I going to tell the police? Maybe I would be implicated in the crime of killing the animal. So, I didn't really want to talk to the police and I didn't go to the police and tell them. Would you? YOU'RE MAKING SUCH AN EXCELLENT POINT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY IN THE ABDUCTION SYNDROME IS FACED WITH. Yeah, there's no hot line. There is nothing you can do. You report it to your government and you end up on an oil rig in the middle of the ocean, or disappear. Or you get harassed. Or at the very least, I would think they w oul d gi ve you a psychi atri c eval uati on that w oul d sti ck i n your record for l i fe."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" AND ROGER VAIL, MY OTHER EARTHFILES REPORT RECENTLY [ 070405 Earthfiles ] ABOUT A UFO AND COW MUTILATION, IS SHOWN BY A TALL LIZARD BEING HOW THEY EXCISED THE TISSUE AND PROCESSED THE BLOOD FOR FOOD. I'M CURIOUS IF AT ANY POINT WHEN YOU WERE ENDURING ALL THAT STRESS, DID YOU EVER GET ANY KIND OF TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION FROM EITHER THE SCIENTIST OR SOLDIER ABOUT WHY THEY WERE LOOKING AT THE FAT ON THE COMPUTER AND WHY THEY HAD MUTILATED THE ANIMAL IN THE BEAM IN FRONT OF YOU AND YOUR FRIEND? No telepathic communication whatsoever. There was nothing. There was no verbal communication. The only kind of communication I would say was body language and eyes. Really the eyes were all the communication you needed. You could really tell what was going on a lot by just looking at them. They were that emotional in the expression on their faces, just like a human. There was one thing I wanted to tell you: On the walls, I saw a 'poster.' It was like a TV screen. I'm on the table. It was to my left. In the sodomizing position, it was on my left. When I was laying down looking out at them, it was on my right. There was an oval screen, but it was like a poster. It was very thin and it had blue background with white stars and the stars and blue background moved sideways from right to left. There was a logo on the craft's wall that had a grouping of stars that stayed in the right upper and lower corner and there were like six or seven stars. It was also six or seven stars on their insignia on their clothes, which was the flying serpent. YOU ASSUMED THAT MAYBE THOSE SIX OR SEVEN STARS ARE THEIR HOME BASE? I don't know. It could probably stand for a lot of things. It could stand for the place they came from, the number of colonies they have, stations on Earth, a grouping of organizations, a federation of planets. A whole bunch of stuff. There is nothing I can tell you other than that. but it seemed to be on their logo and on their ship. The moving poster on the wall later I saw was the Subaru (car) logo. L ogo of flying serpent with tail wrapped around stars was on the right side of the soldier's clothing. Graphic depiction © by \"Howard.\" fter 1995, they changed the Subaru logo. It became exactly what I'm describing to you. It became an oval with a grouping of six or seven stars on the right hand side from bottom to upper corner. I came across it, I saw it on a car, and I thought, 'This looks familiar.' Then I remembered what I saw. I had a revelation. I had to go research this and it is the Pleiades. Subaru stands for the Pleiades star system. Maybe it could stand for the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Pleiades system (on the craft). But they say there are six or seven stars that the naked eye can see. But there are hundreds of stars in the system. So, I don't know if that helps, but it looked exactly like the Subaru logo which really unnerved me today! Those lizards have very beautiful eyes. They have a starfish pattern or radial sunburst pattern in them. The pupil is a vertical slit like a crocodile's. But around that, the iris has a radial pattern like spokes in a wheel. So from the center outwards in all directions. Take a 5-star pattern and make those spokes bigger than the other spokes, so that you see the 5 star pattern to this has thicker lines in the iris of the eye. But behind that are many little spokes in the iris. They do have white on the back of their eye, like when they turned sideways, I got a good look. You know how a dog turns its eye and you can barely see a little bit of white on the back of its eye. And right before that is brown. That's exactly how it was with them. But from the center it was black, vertical slit pupils. And then the starburst that was like a bright yellowish-fluorescent green. It was like so yellow and bright it was like it had a tinge of green. Then around that, like the background behind the spokes of the wheel if you want to call it that, was like an orangish that faded out to a reddish around that and then a brown and then to the black and then to the whites. It looked like the sun in that if some one described the lizards as having eyes of fire, I would understand what they meant. It looks like it's ablaze. It looks like a jewel. They have very pretty eyes. But they are really nasty ! REALLY NASTY. AND YOU NEVER SAW ANYTHING IN THE CRAFT THAT WOULD INDICATE WHY THEY HAD TAKEN PARTS FROM THAT COW AND WHAT THEY HAD DONE WITH THEM IN THE CRAFT? No, only what I saw on the screen looked like fatty tissue. It was not a great magnification either. WHY DID YOU THINK IT WAS YOUR FAT AND NOT FAT FROM THE ANIMAL YOU HAD SEEN CUT UP? Because when I woke up in the craft, I had totally forgotten about the animal. I was just living for right then and right now. Nothing else was in my mind except, 'What the hell is this thing in front of me and where am I at?' SO IT'S PROBABLY THAT THEY WERE LOOKING AT TISSUE FROM THE ANIMAL THEY HAD JUST EXCISED? I would probably agree with that. The only thing I'm aware of them doing other than what I've described is that both of us did have a triangular-shaped it looked like a biopsy mark. but it was not deep at all. It was like 3 pieces of paper thick of a triangle cut out mine was on the inside of my upper arm and I believe my friend's was on his leg. So they weren't even in the same spots. It was like a triangular burn. There were no dots or anything. It was just a triangular shape, like we were burned or something. CAN YOU STILL SEE THAT TRIANGLE IN YOUR ARM? (he looks) No. INSIDE WHICH ARM? I believe it was on the inside of my right arm in the upper part. NEAR YOUR ARMPIT? I think so. That's still foggy in my memory, as far as the placement of it. HAVE YOU AND YOUR FRIEND TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THIS SINCE THEN? We've talked about it twice. The first one was when he came back into my life and we had not spoken in five years. We talked about it and he said a few things and had some memories, but didn't want to talk about it. I've seen him again l ately after I first talked to you. I asked him if he would talk to you and w anted to talk with him more about it. He remembers the basic details: the creatures, the UFO and the cow.
