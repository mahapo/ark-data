Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 3 - Crop Formations and Mysterious Lights in Wiltshire, England, July 2004 © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe July 23, 2004 Wiltshire, England - Norwegian crop circle investigators, Guro Parvanova, Bente Oderud and Irene Lian, are from Oslo. Guro has been teaching Norwegian as a second language to international children for twenty years. As Charles Mallett experienced at the dinner with them, Bente is especially intuitive. But everyone was surprised that the very field upon which Bente placed her finger during the map discussion on July 16, received the enormous pattern discovered at 6 a.m. the next morning, July 17, by the farm owner. See Part 2. Then, on Wednesday to Thursday night, July 21 to 22, 2004, Guro and Irene visited the concentric formation at the top of the South Field below Woodborough Hill, allegedly made by German researchers in a professional experiment in which the farmer, Tim Carson, was paid for the crop space used. Around 10:30 p.m. - not too long after dark in the bright summer Wiltshire evenings - Guro and Irene decided to go over to the top of Adam's Grave so they could have a good view of the East Field below, a place long known for mysterious lights and spectacular crop formations. Neither woman had ever seen what appeared before them between the East Field and Woodborough Hill. Interview: Guro Parvanova, Teacher for 20 years of Norwegian as second language to international children, Oslo,Norway: \"We were standing there (atop Adam's Grave) for quite a long time, about 1.5 hours. We saw many lights, different colors, different shapes, different movements. They were moving all over and in all directions. WHAT KIND OF LIGHTS WERE YOU SEEING? COLORS, SIZES? We saw first some orange lights. We thought it was a street light. It was stationary and rather big like a street light you see half a kilometer away. Orange. WAS THIS IN THE EAST FIELD ITSELF? No, it was far behind. I was there today together with my colleague Irene and we saw that it was to the right of Woodborough Hill and there were no lights there. There is no road there because we looked through binoculars at the site. SO IT STARTED WITH AN ORANGE LIGHT. An orange, stationary light, a round light. Then we suddenly saw another light pop out right behind it a small distance. From our point of view, it was only about 5 centimeters from the other one. Then these two lights started to move very slowly to and from, up and down, and sideways. The first light was much brighter than the other one. It was fading at times and coming back. Then a third light appeared a bit over and behind the other two. It was fainter, but still very visible. But we just watched those lights for about 15 to 20 minutes without seeing anything else. We just concentrated on them. And then, we started to look around. It was a very clear night and warm. There was no wind at all, which was strange up there (on Adam's Grave.) Then we started to see some small white lights popping up and fainting here and there all over in front of us. It was just like a light show. WOULD YOU SAY THERE WERE DOZENS OR HUNDREDS? "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"We were there at least 1.5 hours and I think we saw at least 100 lights altogether over that time. But we started to watch one special light a white light looking like a star. That was to the right of Golden Ball hill. It was moving and it was fairly bright, but fainting at time, and it was moving a bit up and down and sideways at the same time. It was not very high above the Golden Ball hill. We watched that one at the same time as we also watched the orange lights. Yellow \"Funnel\" in the Sky Then, this white light was moving quite a bit during the time we watched it. Then I suddenly turned around and to my back (Milk Hill) at the right side of Milk Hill, there is another hill, flatter. We suddenly saw something like a pipe or a funnel of bright yellow-white light and it was rather high and it was going behind this hill. We watched that for awhile. Bizarre Camera Lens Problem YOU'RE BACK IS TO THE EAST FIELD AND WOODBOROUGH HILL? Yes. We just watched. Then my friend, Irene, was running for the camera. When she came back, the yellow funnel was gone in the meantime. It was about 5 minutes. When we wanted to take a picture, my camera did not work. It was like the lens was broken, like threads when you break it, it becomes blurred and you can't see through. We couldn't see anything through it, neither of us. BUT YOUR CAMERA WAS NOT BROKEN? No. This morning it was perfectly all right. It is not a digital camera. It is 35 mm with film. Nikon camera, rather old. DID EITHER OF YOU GET ANY OF THE LIGHT ACTIVITY ON ANY CAMERA? No, it was impossible. We couldn't see anything through the lens. SO IT WAS LIKE YOU WATCHED THE LIGHT SHOW AND THEN WHEN YOU FINALLY WANTED TO GET PHOTOGRAPHS, WHATEVER THE PHENOMENON WAS, IT BLOCKED IT. We couldn't see through the lens. WAS THE YELLOW FUNNEL THE LAST THING THAT YOU SAW? No. Then, the real thing started. From the right side just over East Field, it came alive. It was not very high up and it was rather close to us. I was there today to see it in bright daylight and I saw that it probably would go right over a small hill in the middle of East Field. It was going in a very funny way. It was very clear blue, like a blue star but rather bigger than a star. And it had a very bright white light around it. I would say it was an orb. But it was flattened on the top and the bottom. And it started to move in a very slow way and in a smooth motion. Communication from A Light We watched that for at least two minutes. I simply felt this is something really special. I had the feeling that this was a kind of contact because it was so close. We had some communication with it. DID YOU HAVE THOUGHTS COME INTO YOUR MIND? Ye s . WHAT WERE THE THOUGHTS? The thoughts were that either we are going up there, or they are coming down. WHAT DID YOU INTERPRET THAT TO MEAN? I was happy, very happy. It was an amazing moment. We were just standing there. We couldn't speak. We were just looking and following this thing. We just felt contact. Then"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"after some few minutes when it was going to go behind the Golden Ball hill, it suddenly fainted out' HOW DID YOU INTERPRET, 'EITHER WE ARE GOING UP THERE, OR THEY ARE COMING DOWN'? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? I think it was a connection. BUT FROM WHAT? I don't know. WHERE WOULD IT BE THAT IT MIGHT TAKE YOU UP TO IT, OR IT MIGHT COME DOWN TO YOU? I felt that it was not just a light. It must be something else. I felt it was intelligent and it is in a way talking to us. And I have to tell you that today I heard that several people in front of The Barge Inn have seen a bluish light at the same time. LAST NIGHT (July 21, 2004), WAS ANY FORMATION DISCOVERED WHERE YOU SAW THE LIGHTS? No. Not there. There was a new one today (July 22, 2004) just under the Pewsey White Horse. (Thought to be a hoax. The first Pewsey White Horse formation was considered genuinely mysterious by some researchers). SO FAR, NOTHING HAS APPEARED WHERE YOU SAW THE LIGHTS DANCING? No. When we saw the special blue and white light fading out behind Golden Ball Hill, the last light, we could still see it in a way. But it was just like in another dimension. I can't explain it. We could follow it somehow, but it was not bright anymore. We left and could not sleep all night.\" Also see: 2004 Unique Canadian Crop Formations: Scorched Soybeans and \"Dirt\" Pattern in Barley.
