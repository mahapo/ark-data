Updated April 19 - See all original, untouched 13 digital images at end of this Earthfiles report / April 17, 2009 Leek, Holland - Two years ago on May 4, 2007, Coast to Coast AM webmaster, Lex, received an email from a Central California resident who called himself “Chad” about his photographing an odd, dragonfly-shaped, aerial object. In an email a week later, Chad sent some of his photographs dated May 6, 2007. [ See: 051507 Earthfiles for photos.] In addition to the dragonfly-shaped body that had appendages sticking out from a large ring, there was another odd feature. Rising from the ring straight up into the air were slightly curved, thin wires that formed a tall, circular crown above the dragonfly body. Chad was worried about his family's safety and health after he saw the bizarre aerial object at least eight times from his house and on hikes near his home and heard a low, electrostatic hum coming from it. Neighbors, he said, had also seen the unidentified aerial object. Odd aerial “drone” photographed by “Chad” in Central California, on May 6, 2007. Other 2007 photographs of dragonfly-shaped aerial objects began to emerge between May and June from Lake Tahoe, Capitola and Big Basin, California – all with appendages sticking out from a ring and the tall, thin wires extending high above. [ See Earthfiles Archive list below.] Another odd aerial “drone” photographed in Lake Tahoe, California, on May 5, 2007. Photographers requests anonymity. By June 17, 2007, I received a dozen paper photographs dated June 5th, 2007, in post office mail. The new “drone” looked more menacing and more complicated than the "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"others. I had taken to calling the objects “drones” because eyewitnesses had the impression that the hovering craft were not manned. The dozen photographs were from a man who called himself “Ty B.” [ See 061707 Earthfiles for all twelve photographs.] O ne of twelve photographs in a series taken on June 5, 2007, by “Ty B” in which the aerial craft appears to rotate. Ty explained he photographed the large, dragonfly craft while bicycling with a group in the Big Basin Redwood Park near Saratoga, California. He said they all saw the dragonfly- shaped craft fade in and fade out three times above them. It was on the third fade in that Ty was able to take twelve photos, which he mailed to me. After the Big Basin craft photographs, other cases emerged in which eyewitnesses sketched odd, aerial “dragonfly”-shape aircraft. R ed circles are the 15 regions known in the United States to date in which 20 eyewitnesses have reported seeing a wingless aerial craft with antenna appendages hovering and moving like a dragonfly, spanning 21 years from 1987 to 2008.

On Saturday, September 8, 2007, 49-year-old Ruud Schmidt was camping for the weekend with his wife and family in Petten, Holland. For eighteen years, Ruud has worked as a therapist for the mentally handicapped in Leek, Holland, and he likes to relax near water with a fishing rod. On September 8, around 1:30 PM, he and his wife had walked to a small lake behind the camp to fish when he suddenly saw an object in the sky about a mile away and maybe a thousand feet up. There was no sound that he and his wife could hear and neither could figure out what they were seeing. Ruud took thirteen digital images with his Nikon D-50 camera and its 100/300 mm Sigma Lens with Autofocus, a camera he had purchased new in 2005. Ruud told me that he took all the photographs in about six minutes. So now, I am adding another line to the chronological list of eyewitnesses: 21) September 8, 2007 - Petten, Holland camp ground.

Update: See original, untouched, 13 digital images taken by Ruud Schmidt around 1:30 PM and to 1:36 PM, on Saturday, September 8, 2007, at Petten, Holland, recreational camp ground at end of this report. Interview: Ruud Schmidt, therapist for mentally handicapped, Leek, Holland: “My wife, my two daughters and my parents and my sister and brother-in-law all went camping just for a couple of days in Petten (weekend of September 8-9, 2007). My wife and I went fishing behind the camp where there was a small water lake. Suddenly, I saw something in the sky and we didn't know what it was. My wife said, 'Why don't you take pictures of it?' I could not see what it was. It was only a black spot. But I had my camera. I did not have binoculars, so I used my camera to see what it was. But it was very difficult because I could not recognize the object. I took twelve photos and on the computer at home, we looked at the thing in the sky and still did not know what it was. HOW FAR DO YOU THINK THE OBJECT WAS FROM YOU? I think about 2 kilometers (1.609 kilometers = 1 mile). ABOUT 1 MILE."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"About a miles, yes. HOW HIGH IN THE AIR DO YOU THINK? Just a guess, but I think it was about 250 to 300 meters. THEN ABOUT A THOUSAND FEET? Ye s . COULD YOU HEAR ANY SOUND? No, we did not hear any sound.

DID YOU KEEP WATCHING IT UNTIL - WHAT HAPPENED? We were fishing. After I took the pictures for about five or six minutes, we kept fishing and looked up to see if it was still there. We didn’t see it coming and we didn’t see it leaving. It was just gone. HOW MANY OF YOU SAW THIS ALL AT THE SAME TIME? Only me and my wife. The rest of the family was cooking. AFTER YOU HAD TAKEN THE 12 IMAGES ON YOUR NIKON CAMERA, DID YOU CONTINUE TO WATCH IT WITH YOUR EYES? Yes, but we went on fishing. SO, DID IT JUST DISAPPEAR WHILE YOU WERE WATCHING IT? No, we didn’t see it disappear. We were fishing and we looked to the water and then looked up and then it was gone. WHEN YOU HAD YOUR 13 IMAGES ON YOUR COMPUTER, DID YOU EVER ASK ANY FRIENDS TO COME IN AND LOOK TO SEE IF ANYONE COULD RECOGNIZE IT? I asked my brother-in-law and my father. We are very skeptical people. I don’t know what it is. It could be anything. We didn’t have any answers. I thought, ‘What do I do with this?’ I did nothing. I left them on the computer. (laughs) SO, YOU LEFT THOSE TWELVE IMAGES OF THE UNKNOWN IN THE SKY ON YOUR COMP UTER UNTIL WHEN? Until last year, 2008. Then I spoke to a friend and he said maybe I should post them on a website to ask about what it is. I did, but I think it was the wrong website – it was the Dutch Nibiru website in a forum for people to react and no one knew what it was. [ Editor's Note: Nibiru is a “12th planet” described in ancient Sumerian texts as periodically interacting with Earth's solar system.] So, last weekend (April 11-12, 2009), I wondered what more to do with the pictures and I was cleaning up my PC. Last year, I was also interested in UFOcasebook.com. Every day I look to see if there is something new and I posted it to the UFOcasebook. That man, BJ, was really enthusiastic to have me place photos in the forum to see if anyone knew what it was. He did and then you emailed me and everybody emailed me about if I knew what it could be?! Well, I don’t know what it is!"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"IF I UNDERSTAND, YOU HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE DRAGONFLY DRONE PHENOMENON EVER BEFORE? No, not really. HAD YOU EVER SEEN ANY OF THE PHOTOGRAPHS I POSTED IN 2007 AND ILLUSTRATIONS IN 2008 THAT LOOK A BIT LIKE DRAGONFLY INSECTS IN THE SKY? No. When I posted on the UFOcasebook, there were many reactions. There are many people who are declaring me a liar. And that was frustrating. THAT WAS APPARENTLY PROVOKED BY SOME CALCULATED MISINFORMATION CAMPAIGN BY PEOPLE UNKNOWN IN 2007 TRYING TO PAINT THE PHOTOS THAT EMERGED AS BEING HOAXED. ANYONE WHO CALLS YOU A LIAR HAS BEEN INFLUENCED BY THAT MISINFORMATION. YOU TOOK PHOTOGRAPHS OF AN UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT THAT YOU AND YOUR WIFE SAW WHILE YOU WERE FISHING. Yes, the object was there. At the moment, we don’t know what it is. It could be anything. People said to me, ‘It’s a balloon. It’s a kite.’ I said, ‘OK, I photographed it with my camera, but I don’t know what it is.’ That’s why I posted the photos.” Update April 19, 2009 Original, untouched, 13 digital images taken by Ruud Schmidt around 1:30 PM and to 1:36 PM, on Saturday, September 8, 2007, at Petten, Holland, recreational camp ground: http://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0731.JPG http://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0732.JPG http://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0733.JPG http://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0734.JPG http://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0735.JPG http://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0736.JPG http://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0737.JPG http://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0738.JPG http://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0739.JPG http://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0740.JPG http://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0741.JPG http://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0742.JPG http://droneteam.com/Nederland/DSC_0743.JPG I f anyone has seen and/or photographed a similar “spider”-shaped aerial object or one of the “dragonfly”-shaped aerial craft, or drones, please email me: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
