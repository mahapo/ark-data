T., The Extra-Terrestrial.” - U. S. Military Source R eturn to Part 1 May 26, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Continuing in Part 9 with Linda Moulton Howe's 1983 to 1987 High Strangeness file notes about EBENs and other non-human entities. The following are interview notes I wrote after a 1984 discussion with a military source. On June 18, 1952, the Ebe that had been retrieved from a 1949 crash near Roswell, New Mexico, died of unknown causes. That day, Ebe was traveling with the USAF Captain who became a Colonel. The two were en route between USAF bases for meetings with scientists and officials. When Ebe got on the first plane, he told the Colonel he did not feel well and attributed the illness to food. The two proceeded to the first air force base meeting and then returned to the Los Alamos, New Mexico, facility where Ebe was housed. Ebe felt much worse and was taken to a hospital where everyone tried to save his life. His temperature changed. MJ-12 authorities discussed the possibility of sending out a specific Hertz frequency given by the EBENs for an “SOS” call for help to try to save Ebe, who telepathically communicated that if he could get into an EBEN light beam technology, his health could be restored. The USAF Colonel asked attending doctors if Ebe was well enough for him to leave the hospital for awhile to check on options and the doctors thought so. When the Colonel returned to the hospital, Ebe communicated he was going to die then and was dead in fifteen minutes. Before Ebe died, the Colonel hugged him and cried because the USAF officer had come to love the small creature “with the mind of a thousand men.” The Colonel learned from Ebe how to improve telepathic communication not only with Ebe but with some receptive humans. Some of the Colonel's human colleagues were shocked when they “heard” the Colonel “talking” in their minds. When asked how he did the telepathy, the Colonel said, “That's something I'll always be grateful to Ebe for teaching me.” This historic event of Ebe's struggle to survive and request to be placed in the EBEN light beam technology for rejuvenation is the true story behind the Steve Spielberg script for the June 11, 1982, first released feature film, E. T., the Extra-Terrestrial.

The same kind of back channel planting of ideas based on true, but highly strange facts, was also applied for Spielberg's 1977 Encounters and the 1951 feature film, The Day the Earth Stood Still. The MJ-12 goal behind secretly planting some of what they knew was to test public reaction.

North allegedly based on a Harry Bates story. For more military intelligence information about Edmund North, please see 121708 Earthfiles in Archive. The same source who described the above Ebe death and Hollywood films used to test public reaction on some leaked ideas in the films told me the following: “The EBENs wanted to create a living human body that their light beam technology could bring back to life. The EBENs do that routinely with their own civilization up to a certain age. The problem with humans is that the EBEN beam energy can kill the Homo sapiens sapiens body. So the EBENs created a hybrid by DNA manipulation that was part EBEN and part Homo sapiens sapiens, a “human body” that could survive the EBEN rejuvenation energy. The historic result was the life of Jesus Christ, his death on a cross and resurrection by the EBEN beam technology. What we don't understand is exactly why the EBENS planted the seed of Christian religion with their hybrid, Christ, and probably planted all the other avatars of history? What do the EBENs want out of the genetic creation and evolution of hominid primates on Earth going back at least to Homo erectus ?” That military source also described his firsthand knowledge about seeing a “very small EBEN scout ship that had only eight little seats in it. No levers or obvious mechanical controls - only lights. There were grooves embedded in consoles for two 4-fingered hands in which fingertips would interact with light. Above the presumed pilot's chair, there was a circle with four round light tubes or crystals in it. The propulsion system was below and had a corresponding arrangement of light tubes or crystals as above the pilot's chair.” The military source said the light tube/crystals reminded him of a liquor decanter set. Crystals with no movable parts. One of the crystals had a pyramidal structure inside it. The military source understood that liquid inside the crystal tubes powered the craft, but no human mind understood how it worked. The elegant simplicity of the lights, crystal tubes and liquids disappointed MJ-12 authorities and their scientists because there was nothing about the propulsion system they could understand. He also had seen an EBEN instrument that reminded him of a “bread box” that was black and had writing all over it that resembled Tibetan script. T ibetan script. The military source said he understood that the Tall Blond craft were bigger and had a chair with a console and levers, similar to the Travis Walton case of 1975 near Heber, Arizona, and the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest in which logger, Travis Walton, was"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"abducted on November 5, 1975. The Tall Blonds are also supposed to have craft that have recognizable computer consoles. [ See The Walton Experience © 1978 by Travis Walton.] T he Walton Experience © 1978 by Travis Walton. The military source also had held what he called an “EBEN camera that captures time and plays it back.” He said it was rectangular, about seven inches long by two inches wide by an inch deep. Solid black, no movable parts. Right in the middle of the black rectangle is a circular glass that reminded him of a lens. But he stressed, “The EBENs don't take photographs or videotape. The EBENS capture time and play it back, literally.” When I asked, “But when we photograph with cameras, still or film or video, aren't we also capturing time to play back?” He said, “No, the EBEN technology interacts with timelines and the black object some how stores pieces of time that can be played back in holograms suspended in the air.” C ontinued in Part 10 R eturn to Part 1 More Information : F or further information, please see my books: An Alien Harvest, the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities and my documentaries A Strange Harvest and Strange Harvests 1993 now available in DVD format in the Earthfiles Shop.
