S. Constitution's Bill of Rights on permanent display in the National Archives Building, Washington, D. C. August 19, 2004 Washington, D. C. - Yesterday in the nation's capitol, U. S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, held five reporters in contempt and fined each $500 a day until they reveal their sources for stories about Los Alamos nuclear scientist, Wen Ho Lee. Lee has filed a lawsuit against the Departments of Energy and Justice, alleging that employees in those agencies were sources of private information about him and his possibly stealing classified information at the Los Alamos laboratory where he worked. Lee was indicted in December 1999 on 59 felony counts of mishandling nuclear weapons information. Subsequently, he was kept in solitary confinement for nine months until he agreed to plead guilty to one felony count. After Lee's release in September 2000, he received an apology from then-President Bill Clinton. The five reporters found in contempt and fined by Judge Jackson are: 1) H. Josef Hebert, Associated Press reporter. 2) Pierre Thomas, now an ABC-TV reporter who worked for CNN during the Wen Ho Lee investigation. 3) Robert Drogin, Los Angeles Times reporter. 4) Jeff Gerth, The New York Times reporter. 5) James Risen, The New York Times reporter. Treading Around Violation of Reporters' First Amendment Rights Judge Jackson tried to avoid a head on confrontation with the reporters' First Amendment rights that there shall be no laws \"abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press...\" He did that by defining the reporters' contempt of court as not complying fully with his October 2003 order \"to fully answer questions in depositions about their sources.\" That October 2003 order, the reporters argue, is a violation of their Constitutional First Amendment rights for freedom of the press. The same issue is at stake in last week's ruling by U. S. District Judge Thomas Hogan in Washington, D. C. concerning the leaked identity of CIA officer, Valerie Plame. Conservative columnist Robert Novak first printed her name which set off the fire storm of inquiries about who in the Bush White House would have violated federal law and leaked her name to the press. Yet in Judge Hogan's ruling, strangely Novak was not found in contempt. It was Time magazine reporter, Matthew Cooper, who was found in contempt "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"while prosecutors in the Plame case have subpoenaed four other reporters and may subpoena more. Time magazine and Matthew Cooper are appealing Judge Hogan's ruling. Bill of Rights Versus Government That Wants to Keep Secrets The Executive Director of the Reporters Committee for the Freedom of the Press said, \"The threat to First Amendment rights that's going on this summer (2004) is unprecedented. We have reporters being subpoenaed. We have judges issuing illegal prior restraints on the media. All this has to do with secrecy. The government is trying to keep more and more secrets all the time, and journalists are working harder to uncover those secrets. Given the terrorism climate, all this has come to a head.\" More Information: From The National Archives, Washington, D.
