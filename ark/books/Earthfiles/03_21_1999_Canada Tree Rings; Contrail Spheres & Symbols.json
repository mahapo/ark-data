Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Rings In Canadian Forests; Contrail Spheres; and Symbols © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe March 21, 1999- 1) International Air Pollution: This weekend I'm in Pensacola, Florida for the Project Awareness Conference about unusual phenomena and new millennial trends. One subject many of us will be talking about is global environmental deterioration. And the March 15th, 1999 Geophysical Research Letters, has published the first study to confirm that the air people are breathing in Washington State probably contains chemical pollution from Chinese factories. Professor Dan Jaffe at the University of Washington and his colleagues concluded that 22% of the carbon monoxide arriving at Cheeka Peak in Washington had originated in East Asia. The polluted air took about six days to travel from Asia to North America. Professor Jaffe was philosophical about the fact that our planet seems to get smaller as problems spill from country to country: \"We make pollution, too. Everybody's pollution goes somewhere else.\" 2) Rings in Canada: This past week, the Prospectors and Developers Association of Canada listened to geochemist Stewart Hamilton from the Ontario, Canada Geological Survey explain his theory about why there are thousands of gigantic, perfectly circular rings in the forests of northern Ontario and Quebec. The diameters range from 900 feet to over a mile. The width of the bands are about six feet wide where nothing grows and are depressed as much as six feet down into the soil. No one understood how extensive the rings are until an aerial survey in 1998 counted two thousand in two months. Anticosti Island in the Gulf of the St. Lawrence River alone has 200 rings. If all northern Canadian forests were surveyed, some estimates project there could be as many as six thousand rings. After Spreading Fungi was ruled out, prospectors want to know if there is something under all these rings like a diamond-bearing kimberlite pipe that's worth drilling for. But so far, drilling cores have come up with nothing more than a lot of limestone in the soil and underneath the rings. Stewart Hamilton told the prospectors that he thinks the rings are \"earth, or geo, batteries.\" It's only a theory and as yet unproven, but this is how it would work. If you have a mineral deposit deep underground that is a strong source of negative electrical charge and up above there is oxygen in ground water that produces a positive electric charge, you've got a natural battery that is slowly and continually discharging. And if the soils are filled with limestone carbonate, acidic conditions eat it away forming the depressed rings. Mr. Hamilton compared the process to adding vinegar to baking soda. Acid is produced at the edges and dissolves away soil and the ground surface drops.\" However, Dr. Jean Veillette, a research scientist who specializes in glacial "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"geology and geomorphology for the Geologic Survey of Canada points out that in the winter of 1998 three deep holes were drilled through ring soil in northern Ontario without finding any source that could provide a negative charge. Furthermore, New Foundland also has limestone rich soil and no rings have been found in those forests. Dr. Veillette says the giant rings are a \"true mystery.\" 3) Sphere In Contrail: In Thursday morning, March 18th, 1999, COAST TO COAST AM, I interviewed Matthew Garner of Albuquerque, New Mexico about his sighting of a silver sphere-shaped object moving amid several contrails and stopping. That occurred two days before on March 16th around 11:30 AM. Afterward, I received a FAX from an Albuquerque resident who said she, too, was outside at the same time taking photographs of \"a large X in the sky and many contrails\" which struck her as extremely odd, just as Matthew Garner had described. But she did not see the silver sphere. After that COAST broadcast, within a few hours I received nearly 100 FAXes from 15 different states about large X contrails, or skies completely covered with contrails seen this past week -- or as far back as December 1998. As I said on COAST, I watched with my own eyes as huge Xs were made in a blue sky over Sedona, Arizona on February 27th -- and two days later on March 1 in Phoenix. The Sedona Xs were freshly made and I and others could see one large silver plane at a high altitude making the newest X. What I would like to share on DREAMLAND tonight are some of the eyewitness reports about more silver spheres in contrails and strangely circled or scribbled symbols that are not logical to airplane flight. One caller suggested that military rocket tests and explosions can produce scribble-looking contrails, but that would not explain such patterns over densely populated areas. Letter from Peterson AFB Employee Who Prefers Anonymity, Colorado Springs, Colorado \"I had a similar experience as the gentleman from New Mexico concerning contrails and the silvery sphere. My sighting occurred on March 16, 1999 at 11:45 AM through 3 PM approximately. The sphere appeared in the haze that was left behind by one of the craft (plane). I have video of craft and contrails (also patterns), but not the sphere (unusual).\" March 16th at 11:45 AM in Colorado Springs is the same date and time that Matthew Garner watched the silver sphere through binoculars over Albuquerque. The next day, March 17th at 1:40 PM, a resident of Mansfield, PA said she \"saw the exact same X contrails and silver disc\" over a rural area where there is usually no air traffic at all. Also, on March 16th in the morning, Cave Junction, Oregon residents FAXed that they heard jets go over their house. Later, outside, they saw a huge cloverleaf-shaped contrail that covered the entire sky. Many listeners FAXed about strange contrail patterns, but two stuck out because they are from two different states, and yet the drawings are identical. One was over Waco, Texas in March. The other goes back to December 1998 near Mesquite, Nevada from an eyewitness who served in the U. S. Army:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Fax from eyewitness in U. S. Army, Mesquite, Nevada \"In early December 1998, I was traveling north from Las Vegas along Interstate I-15 towards Mesquite. It was a Saturday evening (the same as the night it snowed 2 inches in Las Vegas) around sunset when I pulled into the Moapa Indian Reservation store and casino to purchase a cold drink. When we approached the store, we saw several people staring into the sky to the southwest back along the highway towards Las Vegas. We then observed a strange contrail' in the sky slightly to the right of the lights of Las Vegas which places it somewhere over the Pahrump area, or even possibly further to the southwest over Death Valley, California. \"The contrail was shaped like three concentric circles one above the other, rather like a flattened spring, with a long contrail extending off the bottom circle pointing towards the southeast. It was getting dark, but the contrail remained illuminated for at least an hour until it was completely dark and the trail then slowly dispersed and vanished into the night. The strange thing about this phenomenon was that in the center of the circles was a diffused light, rather like the colors of a prism with red, green and yellow predominating. Rather like light reflected through a mist of oil. I live right under the air traffic corridor leading into Las Vegas so I am quite familiar with the patterns and behavior of regular contrails. But this contrail was unlike anything I have ever seen before. \"It was midday when I again observed a similar contrail to the west, but this time there was only one circle as if a high flying jet aircraft had turned around in a complete circle until he resumed its original course.\" Letter from resident, Denver Colorado: \"Contrails have been increasing with regularity and concentration as far as numbers of trails and frequency all around the Denver, Colorado area. Example: a friend was in Elizabeth, Colorado (south of Denver 30 miles). He was telling his family about this as there were some trails overhead on Sunday, March 15, 1999. At that moment, a white glob fell out of the sky and \"goop\" stuck to the screen door. He showed his family and (the goop) disappeared.\" I also have other references for other substances that have fallen to the ground and hope some can be analyzed to contribute more data to this baffling and ongoing story of mysterious contrails. I welcome more information on these environmental problems, rings in forests and unusual phenomena. Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
