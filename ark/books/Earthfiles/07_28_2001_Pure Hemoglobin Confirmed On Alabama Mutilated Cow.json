July 28, 2001 Grass Lake, Michigan - On October 15-16, 2000, I reported about the discovery of hardened bovine hemoglobin on a mutilated bull in Red Bluff, California. (See: Earthfiles 10/15-10/16/00.) Since the 1950s, unusual deaths called \"animal mutilations\" have been reported around the world. Both domestic animals and wild game have been affected, especially horses and cattle. Ranchers and law enforcement have long been puzzled because animals are found with the same pattern of hide and tissue removed - usually without blood - from the head, sexual organs, and rectum. There are no signs of struggle or tracks around the dead animals, not even the animal's own tracks. That peculiar fact provoked law enforcement to wonder if perpetrators came in and out of pastures using aerial craft, picking animals up and dropping them back down after taking tissues and fluids. Many ranchers have also speculated that their mutilated animals have been cut with lasers because of the bloodless nature of the excisions. In fact, pathology exams over the years have confirmed that cuts in some mutilations were made with high heat. (See: An Alien Harvest and Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I: Facts & Eyewitnesses in Earthfiles Shop .) Biophysicist W. C. Levengood in Grass Lake, Michigan thinks a very complex set of energies are involved. He began studying soil and grass samples from mutilation sites to compare with soil and grass from mysterious crop formations. In both phenomena, he has found the same pattern of respiration changes in plant cell mitochondria. He has experimented with microwaves and has reproduced some of the biochemical and biophysical changes to plants in his lab. In addition to the 1997 California bull mutilation and pure, dried hemoglobin described in the October 2000 Earthfiles.com reports, this week I received news from biophysicist Levengood about another confirmation of pure, dried "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"hemoglobin on a mutilated cow in Alabama.

As stated in the report of the first event (Red Bluff, California bull, August 1997): 'The usual procedure for isolating hemoglobin from whole blood is rather complex. It involves separating red blood corpuscles from the lighter plasma components by centrifugation. The plasma is siphoned off and ether is added to the corpuscle paste, causing the cells to burst. Another centrifugation removes the ruptured cell envelopes and leaves a clear red solution of hemoglobin. It is unlikely that a procedure such as this would be done on site. It is unknown how or why this occurred.'\" 4) Biophysicist W. C. Levengood: \"The owner stated that the animal was dropped from a considerable height (because) trees and large tree limbs were broken off.

Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, Grass Lake, Michigan : \"I think there are a number of implications (to finding a second case of pure, dried hemoglobin on mutilated cow). First of all, I think the discovery of the same pure hemoglobin on the Alabama excision site was important in the effect that it showed that the 1997 discovery of the pure hemoglobin wasn't just some wild, freaky thing, you know. It was very real. NOW WE'VE GOT TWO. And now we've got two that show very, very pure hemoglobin which to me presents very striking anomalous situation. The discovery of this pure hemoglobin - a scientist probably recognizes the fact this is more astounding than a layman because if you know how hemoglobin is produced in the pure form, it entails a number of very, very precise and rather prolonged biochemical steps. In other words, you can't do this in a matter of a few minutes. PURE HEMOGLOBIN IS NOT FOUND NATURALLY IN NATURE. No, it isn't. It's in the red blood cells, the erythrocytes, and it can only be removed by breaking down the cell walls by using a lysing agent. And then once you do that, then the hemoglobin comes out of the red blood cells, but so do a lot of other blood components such as leukocytes, fat bodies and other constituents of blood that then have to be removed by further precise steps of extraction and centrifuge. THIS TAKES ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY TO DO? Yes, right. This takes a biochemical laboratory. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT SOME ONE IS GOING TO SET UP IN A PASTURE AND REPRODUCE THERE AND DAUB PURE HEMOGLOBIN AROUND ON BRANCHES? Oh, no. No. No. And then, of course, there is another step that is taken in this whole process done by whomever and that is that the hemoglobin is now put into a compact, solid form. WHICH IS THE WAY WE HAVE FOUND IT. It's dehydrated, exactly. YOU HAVE WRITTEN AND PUBLISHED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT IN BOTH BOVINE EXCISION SITES AND CROP FORMATIONS THAT SOME KIND OF SPINNING PLASMA VORTEX IS THE MECHANISM FOR THE ENERGY TRANSFER. HOW DOES THAT RELATE IN YOUR MIND TO WHAT COULD BE HAPPENING THAT COULD PRODUCE THIS PURE HEMOGLOBIN ON BRANCHES OR ON THE GROUND AROUND THESE UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS. Well, first of all, if you go to the Red Bluff, California report I sent you recently, what I found there is the same tiny micrometeorite-sized pure iron oxide particles are found around many bovine excision sites. Now, we find that the distribution of the particles are distributed in a very precise manner. In other words, the quantity drops off linearly from the origin of the animal outward. So, if it fits this earlier model that I worked out in crop formations where we know we have tremendous vortex energies involved, then it kind of follows that probably the same type of magnetic vortex was involved here, although the way it's distributed would indicate that it's not as energetic as found in the crop formations. THINKING ABOUT THAT, DOES THAT SUGGEST ANYTHING TO YOU ABOUT WHAT KIND OF TECHNOLOGY OR ENERGY SYSTEM COULD"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"BE INVOLVED? It is sure a pretty sophisticated one, that's for sure. Because if you take just the fact that I always find the grass is injured by the microwave radiation. And that was true here also. And particularly, the hairs that were standing up on the back of the animal? RIGHT. And the fact that they could be plucked out with the hands real easily. THAT WAS IN THE RED BLUFF, CALIFORNIA CASE. Yeah, as Jean Bilodeaux (field investigator) pointed out - that hide was cooked in a very precise manner in a very local manner by some sort of very, very rapid and very transient type of energy. WHICH MOST LOGICALLY IS MICROWAVE ENERGY WHICH COOKS WAT E R . Yeah, that's right, because the grass was effected, you see, they had high redox ratios right at the back of the animal. THAT'S RIGHT. And you moved out a ways and the grass had a normal level. Well, that high level always indicates that the grass has been severely injured in terms of the mitochondria, the tiny organelles inside the grass that, inside the cells of the grass blades, that are involved in respiration. THAT YOU HAVE REPEATEDLY FOUND FROM BOTH FORMATIONS AND AT BOVINE EXCISION SITES THAT THERE IS ALMOST A SIMILAR PATTERN (OF DAMAGE) FROM CASE TO CASE ALMOST AS IF THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO SOME KIND OF ENERGY THAT HAS ALMOST EXHAUSTED THEM. Yes, you go back a week later and you find the grass, even though it looks normal when they took the sample, the grass is dead in that very local region around the animal. So that means the grass has been severely injured and the respiration has been impaired to the point that the grass just expires. FROM THE WORK YOU HAVE DONE, YOU LINK THAT TO EXPOSURE TO MICROWAVE FREQUENCIES? Yeah, I have been able to simulate that in the laboratory. If I take ordinary grass from my own yard and I expose it very briefly - if I recall, it was less than 15 seconds - to a microwave, I can produce the same kind of energy by looking at the redox ratios, I can see the same kind of mitochondrial energy (damage) that I'm finding at the bovine excision site in the grass there. THE DISTRIBUTION OF BOTH THE CHANGES IN THE REDOX IN THE MITOCHONDRIA AS WELL AS THE DISTRIBUTION OF SAY MAGNETIC PARTICLES IN THE SOIL, IT HAS A CENTRIFUGAL DISTRIBUTION PATTERN AND THAT IS WHAT HAS CONVINCED YOU THAT WHATEVER THE ENERGY IS, IT HAS TO BE SPINNING IN SOME KIND OF A VORTEX? That's correct, yeah. It looks very likely, yeah. At some sites, it is more obvious than others. But I would say there are many similarities between the vortex kind of motion you get around bovine excisions and in the crop formation patterns. THE PURE HEMOGLOBIN HAS BEEN FOUND EITHER ON BRANCHES OR THE GRASS OR THE HIDE OF ANIMALS. DOES THAT SUGGEST TO YOU THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE ANIMALS HAVE BEEN LOWERED IN THE AIR DOWN AND THAT THESE DROPS OF THE HEMOGLOBIN HAVE COME FROM THE ANIMALS THAT WAY?"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Well, I don't know - it could be. There is no question that this Alabama bovine excision, the recent one, was dropped from a considerable height. And even though this was an area where there was no grass, the person that sampled this was kind enough to get me leaf samples from the trees close to the animal. And I found that they had not been changed at all in terms of the redox pattern, which indicated to me that with these kinds of severe excisions that I should have seen some indication of an energy effect. But I saw none. Therefore, the excisions were probably done before the animal was dropped back down to earth. WHICH WOULD BE VERY CONSISTENT WITH SOME OF THE EYEWITNESS CASES OVER THE PAST 20 YEARS IN WHICH PEOPLE HAVE SEEN - A RANCHER, IN FACT, IN OREGON WATCHED SEVERAL ANIMALS BE DROPPED FROM UNKNOWN OBJECTS DOWN THROUGH TREES. (See: Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. II: High Strangeness in Earthfiles Shop) AND WHEN HE WENT TO SEE THE ANIMALS, THEY WERE LYING ON THE GROUND WITH THE EXCISIONS FROM THE EAR, EYE AND SO FORTH. WHAT DO YOU THINK COULD BE BEHIND THE PRODUCTION OF PURE HEMOGLOBIN IN WHATEVER PROCESS IS CARRIED OUT? WHY PURE HEMOGLOBIN? I've been studying a little bit the effects of pure hemoglobin and its energy in the lab and it looks to me like this solid material has properties that would be very interesting to someone. This is certainly not done in a haphazard manner. It's a very directed, very precise series of biochemical steps that take place here. So, this must have some very important function in some other, some other process somewhere. COULD IT BE THAT THE BLOOD IS BEING SEPARATED IN ORDER TO TAKE OUT CERTAIN INGREDIENTS LEAVING BEHIND THE PURE HEMOGLOBIN? No, no, no. These pure hemoglobin particles are not easy to find. You find just a few compared to the tremendous amount that would be in a cow, or bovine, cow or bull. You find just a few particles, probably less than 2 grams are ever found. And yet, I'm sure the total amount in a bull might be a pound. I don't know precisely what it would be, but a lot (of hemoglobin). So, this looks to me like it's a spill over effect. They were sloppy and left some behind. Or maybe intentionally. Who knows? BUT IT STILL, THE IMPLICATION MIGHT BE, THAT THERE WAS A LARGER PROCESS OF EXTRACTION OF THINGS FROM THE BLOOD IN THESE ANIMALS AND THE PURE HEMOGLOBIN, THE LITTLE BIT THAT IS LEFT AND YOU HAVE FOUND AND ANALYZED, COULD BE THE RESIDUE OF A MUCH LARGER PROCESS THAT EXTRACTED MAYBE A VARIETY OF THINGS FROM THE ANIMAL'S BLOOD? That's possible. The reason I don't think they are interested in any other component of the blood is that you don't find any in the solid form. And secondly, you don't find any blood at all. Why wouldn't that just be dumped somewhere if it's waste? What I feel happens is every other component of the blood is totally disintegrated with the exception of the hemoglobin. It's turned into its elemental form. This is why I have been trying to encourage people like NIDS (National Institute of Discovery Science) who have the money and facilities and interest in the pathology of this to take a look at the level of iron, using EDS (electron dispersive spectroscopy), in a slaughterhouse from a normal animal. And then look at the level of iron in an arterial wall of an excised animal compared to the normal cow's (arterial wall iron) constituents."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"I'm betting that you might find a much, much higher level of iron (in animal excisions) because if the blood is disintegrated, this (iron) would be the only atom that would not be converted into another liquid, steam or blood, water, nitrogen and oxygen. I WONDER WHY WE HAVEN'T FOUND MUCH OF THIS PURE HEMOGLOBIN AT MANY OF THE ANIMAL MUTILATION SITES BEFORE? This has to be not only a unique process, but it's got to be damn efficient because it's not easy to remove that hemoglobin. Like I say, there are a number of biochemical steps that have to take place. So I don't think they leave much behind. That's the part they are really interested in getting as much as they can. FOR SOME APPLICATION WE STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND. That's right. Yeah, I have no idea what they would use that for. Perhaps it might be more compatible with their system of physiology. I don't know. It almost forces you - as a scientist, you know, you don't want to think about that - but by golly, it forces you into thinking about other entities and dimensions. Because we just can't do this - pick a cow up, drain or disintegrate all the blood in it, produce pure hemoglobin, and then drop it back down! RIGHT.
