Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 8 - UFO Crash/Retrievals, Status Report VII by Len Stringfield \"The crashed UFO object 'looked like a whale.'\" © 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe To be more computer-upload-friendly, the reprints will be divided into parts. Here begins Part 8 of Status Report VII, from February 1994. The following continues the July 1993 Ohio UFO Notebook article about an alleged Clovis, New Mexico UFO crash site in the late 1950s by William Jones, Director, Mid-Ohio Research Associates (M.O.R.A.) that was begun in Earthfiles, Part 7. \"M.O.R.A. Follow-Up Data from Ohio UFO Notebook July 1993 article by William Jones According to Jake, he and his two friends had gotten into the area without being noticed. There were between 40 and 50 people in the area, some taking notes and measurements. Fire trucks, pickup trucks, wreckers, and jeeps were parked near the road they came in on. Several 'four-by' covered trucks were parked near the object which was located down in a river bed area. The object was sitting on the surface of the ground. It appeared that the object had come down, skipping over the surface of the ground before sliding down into the river bed. A telephone pole, a fence row, and a number of bushes and small trees had been knocked down. The object 'looked like a whale.' It was charcoal in color and it did not appear to be damaged, although he couldn't see what the bottom looked like. He viewed the object from what he concluded was its rear or tail-end. The object was perhaps thirty feet long. It had 'slits' along its sides. As they were leaving the area, Jake picked up the small metallic pieces that were described in the previous issue of the Notebook. According to Jake, he and his friends had returned to the Clovis area three weeks later on U. S. Air Force business unrelated to their experience. While there, they had gone to a restaurant in a small town south of Clovis and entered into conversations with some civilians. One was a rancher who said that his cows were 'spooked' one night by a 'big object' that had landed on his property. The object had a glow to it. While he was watching, it took off suddenly. It emitted no sound. It flew over a hill in the distance. There was a flash, then nothing. Two or three days later, the rancher heard that something strange had crashed in the area where the flash occurred, but he had heard no details. This area was near where Jake and his friends had seen their crashed object and the rancher's sighting had occurred only a few days before Jake and his friends had their experience. Jake does not remember the name of the rancher after all of these years. According to the rancher, other sightings were reported in the area during this same time period, some of which were mentioned in the local paper. A search for these articles is currently underway in Clovis thanks to the efforts of Carolyn Duce-Ashe of New Mexico MUFON. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"There were sightings reported near Clovis at or near the time of the alleged crash as noted in Thomas R. Adams' 1992 report entitled, Pardon the Intrusion or UFOs Over, On & Under (?) New Mexico. Mr. Adams received personal communications which told of an October 23, 1957, UFO landing in the Clovis-Portales area; no other details are available. Also, on October 24, fifteen miles south of Cannon Air Force Base, multiple witnesses reported a daylight landing which left unspecified traces behind. The November 3, 1957, issue of the Medford (Oregon) Mail Tribune reported that a radio station owner had seen a streaking fireball on Saturday night, November 1, 19957. On Sunday, sightings and landings of egg-shaped craft were reported just across the state-line in the area of Lovelland, Texas. It goes without saying that Jake's story rests solely upon his own testimony. So far, nothing that he has told us has been confirmed by any third party or independent source. We want to place on record that Jake has showed us his United States Air Force Certificate of Appointment to the 'permanent grade of Staff Sergeant' dated in 1959, and an Air Force Air Training Command Certificate of Proficiency dated in 1956 recording that he had successfully completed a course as an aircraft mechanic on a specific engine-type for the F-80C aircraft.'\" Len Stringfield: We cannot dismiss the Clovis crashed object as an awkward U. S. space experiment or as a nondescript spaceship. If such a U. S. Rube Goldberg creation existed in 1957, or was developed long before or long after Sputnik, it probably was never duplicated - as I have never received another report of that description. Impressed by the investigations of the Mid-Ohio Research Associates (MORA), I called Jake again on November 18, 1993, and leaving no stones unturned to trigger his recall into extraneous events, I managed to uncover a few more details - some significant. At first we tried to define its shape, comparing it to everything from a manta ray, a whale, a cigar with a radical swept-back wing and finally a submarine with a slender nose with an inflated mid-section. Jake said, \"For sure, it was not a U. S. aircraft, nor a modified cylindrical rocket fashioned after the German V-2. But whatever it was, it appeared to be a metallic, charcoal-colored vehicle he estimated to be 150 to 160 feet long. \"It's slender nose was slightly tilted up,\" Jake said, \"but I couldn't see its rear which had scraped a path of destruction for some distance, knocking down trees, a telephone pole and disintegrating a huge boulder before it got stuck in a deep ravine.\" Jake reaffirmed that he saw no ambulances on the scene, indicating the absence of dead or injured crew members. On the other hand, he had no way of knowing that one or more had been there during early retrieval operations. However, he did recall that a bus was parked alongside the craft which could have substituted as a medical conveyance. Military Personnel On Scene Wore Asbestos and Silver Suits On the issue of military personnel on the scene, I got new information. I had asked if tents had been pitched to accommodate the troops or a headquarters-type tent as a command post. No tents, he said, but there were many vehicles including the bus. Then came a surprise disclosure. Near the craft were a number of personnel wearing asbestos and silver suits. To Jake, that meant the possibility of their exposure to dangerous radiation. In this case, was the vehicle a U. S. atomic-powered test flight that failed? Or was it a UFO, known to be radioactive in some past instances in tactical operations? Whichever, it would account for the prevailing secrecy when he and his companions were told to leave the area and to forget what they had seen and to keep their mouths shut."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" As far as the metal fragments found scattered several hundred yards away from the craft - some of which were surreptitiously pocketed by Jake or one of his buddies - we cannot be sure if they were the property of the downed craft or from a U. S. aircraft on an intercept mission which exploded and crashed. According to lab tests, the retrieved fragments were of terrestrial origin. See 2-page analysis reported by Andeco below. Two-page metal analysis (1993?) of fragments allegedly picked up at July or August 1957 or 1958 UFO crash site in Clovis, New Mexico. Two-page metal analysis on Page 33 of Len Stringfield's 1994 UFO Crash/Retrievals, Status Report VII."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"In terms of physical effects, Jake came up with another surprise. One of his companions had a new Bulova digital watch, he said, that stopped working while near the crash site. He added that his (Jake's) watch, with a standard timepiece mechanism, was discovered to be running 20 minutes slow after leaving the crash site area. What ever happened near Clovis, New Mexico, in the late 1950s, Jake felt unsafe to discuss his experience with anyone for years knowing that his two companions - after leaving the service - disappeared mysteriously and were never heard from again. The Clovis case is by no means closed. To be continued in Part 9. Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
