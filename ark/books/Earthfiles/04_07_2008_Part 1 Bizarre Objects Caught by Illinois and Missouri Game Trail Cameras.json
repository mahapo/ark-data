Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 1: Bizarre Objects Caught by Illinois and Missouri Game Trail Cameras © 2008 by Linda Moulton Howe “I t is really strange because the object itself is ghostly white against the rest of the darker digital gain camera image.” - B ob Coine, Heartland Studios, Oregon, Illinois O regon, Illinois, is southwest of Rockford, not far from both the Wisconsin and Iowa borders. April 7, 2008 Oregon, Illinois - Bob Coine is President and Owner of Heartland Studios, Inc., in Oregon, Illinois. Bob in an Illinois native, born there in 1959, and a successful manufacturing entrepreneur until 2000. That year, he sold several businesses with the idea of retiring to his Oregon farm to pursue his personal hobby: protecting, improving and managing wildlife, with an emphasis on white tail deer. “But there wasn’t anything available at that time relative to attracting, holding and managing white-tailed deer in an environmentally sound fashion as I had been doing since 1993. I assumed there were other folks around the country who would like to successfully implement a program like mine. So I decided to apply my business talents to producing non-commercial educational material for this market, non-commercial in the sense that it wasn’t produced to sell products, just useful and very real information. That's how I came up with the idea for a DVD series entitled, Building Whitetail Paradise. By 2004, I founded Heartland Studios to produce the DVDs - and so much for retirement!” B ob Coine, President and Owner, Heartland Studios, Inc., Oregon, Illinois. Image courtesy Bob Coine. “I found there are a lot of people out there like me, who are interested in managing their property with ecological sound management principals to attract, manage and hold white tail deer and other wildlife. I don’t do any outfitting. My work is to manage the environment and promote wildlife health – not hunting.” "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In order to provide both security for his farmland and to know what deer and other wildlife are using his game trails, Bob Coine installed several different cameras around his farmland. “For some sites around my farm, I have pure infrared cameras for both game tracking and security. For example, if we had trespassers at night, their eyes would not see a flash (from infrared), but their image would be taken by the infrared camera. Another reason folks use the pure infrared cameras is because they feel that the deer or wildlife would not be spooked when the camera goes off, since there is no visible flash.” In order to keep track of how many white-tailed bucks and does use his farm and to estimate ages of the bucks, Bob explained that he uses a variety of game trail cameras. He has pure infrared cameras that do not flash and take images in non-visible infrared; standard 35mm cameras; and digital cameras that have an infrared beam to detect motion, which then triggers the camera to flash in the visible light spectrum. Six photographs taken in visible flash mode on November 16, 2007, beginning at 3:59 AM over a three minute time span, are still a mystery. Interview: Bob Coine, President and Owner, Heartland Studios, Inc., Oregon, Illinois: “Periodically, we check the cameras during the hunting season just to see what animals are using a particular area. In November 2007, during our hunting season, one evening we went around to check cameras. What we do is take a little portable digital camera with us and we swap cards from the remote cameras into this small portable camera. Then, we check through it to see if there is anything of interest. If there is, we’ll download those images into a computer. That night, I had two friends of mine with me – one from Arkansas and the other is a local Illinois friend of mine. We were flipping through the pictures on the portable camera and oddly, out of 182 images on that particular camera, we saw this strange, white spec on the small viewfinder. We could tell by flipping through the pictures that it looked like it was moving. This camera is a Moultrie GameSpy D-40 Digital Flash Trail Camera (4 megapixel). It is not an infrared camera. But the GameSpy is triggered if motion is detected by an infrared beam emitted from the camera. The shutter is released with a light flash in the visible spectrum. The flash is supposed to light up at least 45 feet beyond the camera and we have discovered it lights up even farther than that. M oultrie GameSpy D-40 Digital Flash Trail Camera ( 4 megapixel). This particular camera is mounted on what is known as a ‘scrape tree’ adjacent to a cornfield. Bucks will come in and rub the glands on their faces on the over-hanging branches. They will make paw marks on the ground, distributing scent. So, it’s a good location to get photos. While we were out there at the site and saw the strange, white speck seeming to move positions on six of the digital camera frames, we checked out the hanging tree branches to"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"see if anything was there. But we could not find anything. We’re scratching our heads about what the moving white spec is. We went back to my place and put the images on a computer monitor. At that point, we could see this strange object with what appeared to be light beams above and below it. When we would play the six frames through the series, just going through the still frames one-by-one, it actually appeared as if the strange, white object is moving. It is really strange because the object itself is ghostly white against the rest of the darker digital gain camera image. These pictures were taken on November 16, 2007, beginning at 3:59 AM Central. The camera was set to trigger photographs in a series of three photographs per triggered event. Let’s say an animal walks in front of the camera. That will trigger the camera to take the first picture and then two more in series.” Time Line of 6 Digital Images, November 16, 2007, 3:59 - 4:02 AM Central Oregon, Illinois Image 1 = 3:59 AM Central Bob Coine: “In the first picture, a deer is triggering the camera as the deer walks by. The deer appears to be 30 or 40 yards out from the camera, maybe a little bit farther. It’s just a normal deer-walking-by photograph with that white thing on the right side of the frame.

Image 4 = 4:01 AM The next (4th) triggered event at 4:01 AM, you have a deer back in the frame appearing to look at the strange object. What is odd is that the deer is in a state of alarm, meaning its tail is up. A white tail deer uses their tail up as a signal. Their tail can tell many different stories in communication with other animals. But in this image, the deer’s eyes and ears are focused toward the object and its tail is up in the alarm position.

GIVEN THE 10 TO 12 FEET OF WEEDS AND THEN THE FLAT AREA OF COMBINE-FLATTENED CORN FIELD OUT TO THE CORN STUBBLE, HOW FAR OUT DO YOU THINK THE STRANGE SUSPENDED OBJECT WAS FROM THE CAMERA? Somewhere between 10 to 20 feet. WHAT WOULD YOU ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF THE OBJECT IS? I’m guessing 6 to 12 inches (vertically long), if relatively close to the camera. In the foreground you’ve got grass and weeds – probably for a distance of 10 or 12 feet from the camera. Then there is a flattened area where, when we harvested this particular cornfield with a combine, it probably flattened out the edges for 20 or 30 yards. Then beyond that, you see corn stubble. Something else I’d like to mention, Linda. If you run through these pictures, which I have not only on the computer, but also in a videotape of the still frames that I produced for my Wo o d N Wa t e r TV show (Outdoor Channel) and my website, you can see that there is no wind in the frames. The branches hanging down that I spoke about before and the weeds in front – including lightweight weeds such as foxtail – nothing is moving. So, it’s not as if something is hanging from the tree and being blown around by the wind. There is no wind whatsoever that night. WHAT PROVOKED YOU TO PUT THE CAMERA THERE? It's a travel corridor and gives us an opportunity to see the deer moving through this area. DID YOU HAVE A BLOCK OF FOOD ANYWHERE NEAR WHERE THE OBJECT WA S? No. In Illinois, we are unable to use feeders or mineral blocks due to chronic wasting disease (CWD) becoming prevalent in the state. What we are able to do is plant feed plots. Where this camera is mounted, it’s in a game travel corridor. We don’t even have any food plots planted in that location. There's just the harvested corn stubble and behind the camera there's a water stream. Reaching Out to the Public for Answers I put the six frames together so you can see the odd movement from frame to frame of the strange, white object. That's what I put at my website http://www.heartland illinois.com and in a segment for Wo o d s N Wa t e r TV. I put out an appeal for anyone who has information about what the odd, white object could be to get in touch with me. One popular thesis from viewers has been a hanging spider web. Mid-November in Northern Illinois with cold temperatures precluded insect activity, in my opinion. Also, any breeze blowing the silk back and forth would bend the strand. Close analysis of the beam"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"shows that it is perfectly straight. So, I and others would discount that possibility.” Feedback Physicist Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist, U. S. Department of Navy, Infrared Applications, Washington, D. C., has worked more than 30 years as a research physicist at the U. S. Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC) in Dahlgren, Virginia. Dr. Maccabee also took a serious interest in the phenomenon of unidentified flying objects, has reported about his investigations for the Fund for UFO Research (FUFOR) and the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) and published in books such as The UFO/FBI Connection © 2000. Dr. Maccabee looked at the six frames from Bob Coine's digital flash camera and emailed: “The 'milk bottle' (shape of unidentified object) is clearly a strong reflector, similar to the deer eyes - or it is a source of light. But there does not seem to be light shining from it illuminating the ground.” Thus, one possibility is that the object is generating light, which also might produce the upper and lower rays that seem to emanate from the top and bottom of the object. However, German crop formation researcher, Andreas Mueller, studied the six images and hypothesizes that instead of possible light ray emanations from the object, the “rays” are reflections in the air.
