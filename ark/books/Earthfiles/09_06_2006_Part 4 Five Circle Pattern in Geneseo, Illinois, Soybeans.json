Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Part 4: Five Circle Pattern in Geneseo, Illinois, Soybeans © 2006 by Linda Moulton Howe September 6, 2006 Geneseo, Illinois - On Thursday, August 24, 2006, Ted Robertson hired a fixed-wing airplane pilot to take him over the Jim and Chris Stahl soybean farm in Geneseo, Illinois. One of his photographs sparked a question in the minds of Roger Sugden and Jeffrey Wilson of the Independent Crop Circle Research Association (ICCRA). Puzzling Soybean Circle Placement G raphically superimposed blue line goes along sprayer lines; red line goes along planting rows. Aerial image © 2006 by Ted Robertson and graphic © 2006 by Roger Sugden and Jeffrey Wilson, ICCRA. Jeff applied the red and blue lines to the photograph and wrote to me by email: “Roger Sugden looked at Ted’s aerial photos of that site and it appeared at first that the formation was aligned to the planting rows and not to the tramline sprayer lines, but the actual planting rows. Those are at a different angle than the sprayer lines are. Sprayer lines seem to be parallel to the road, but for some reason – we don’t know why this is the case – when they planted there, they planted sort of on an angle. So, Roger first looked at it and thought it was aligned to the planting rows, rather than the sprayer lines. \"But in a better overhead aerial, I looked at it more carefully and it does not appear to be aligned to either one, which is the photograph I sent you with the two colored lines. One colored line (blue) is aligned with the tramlines. The other colored line (red) is aligned with the planting rows. The formation is not aligned to either one, which is somewhat significant in the sense that generally when we are in a manmade formation, it’s aligned to some feature on the ground like the sprayer lines or perhaps the planting rows or telephone poles on the ground or some building feature that the people use as a marker when they are laying out the construction on it. \"In this case, the Geneseo soybean circles are not aligned to any ground feature, including the tramlines, the planting lines, the poles nearby, or even the microwave tower off in the distance.\" September 3,2006 email from Chris and Jim Stahl in answer to my question about the sprayer and planting lines: Jim Stahl: \"The field is actually one big triangle. I planted the rows parallel to the fence row on the north. I sprayed parallel to the fence row on the south.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"A erial showing 5-circle-formation not aligned to Middle Road on left.

Corn Test Farm Across Road Ted Robertson's aerial photographs also showed a large rectangle of soil with strips of plants growing in it across the road from the soybean circles. I asked Jim and Chris Stahl for more information. September 3,2006 email from Chris and Jim Stahl Jim Stahl: \"Wyffels seed corn company owns it (test farm). They have test plots there every year. I believe they are testing different seed corn varieties.\" P hotograph above and photograph below of Wyffels seed corn company's test farm across Middle Road from the Chris and Jim Stahl soybean farm in Geneseo, Illinois.

Jeffrey Wilson looked in his ICCRA archives of American crop formations for any pattern similar to the five circles in the Geneseo, Illinois, soybeans. He wrote to me: \"Allen County, Ohio in 1999 is the only formation in the USA database which is similar – we’ve had very few Celtic Cross-type patterns reported in the USA.\" Jeff found that five circles were \"discovered near the center of a field of wheat while the landowner was harvesting the field, and there were no sprayer lines/tramlines in the field. Jeff Wilson: \"In this Allen County, Ohio case, all five circles were tangent/slightly overlapping, but the circle sizes were quite similar.

On August 22, 1991, farmers Delmar and Carol Meyer found that circle of corn swirled counterclockwise. Three days later on August 25, 1991, a local pilot (deceased Blue Grass mayor) flew over and found the second circle near old Highway 61, now called 140th Avenue. That counterclockwise circle also measured 46 feet in diameter. Aerial image courtesy Carol and Delmar Meyer.

Interview: Delmar Meyer, Farmer, Blue Grass, Iowa: “It was fifteen years ago back on August 22, 1991, probably around 6 p.m. I did custom bailing and I was going down the road (Coon Hunter's Road) with a tractor. I looked up there on the hillside and I could see a circle. I went down and finished bailing and came back and got the wife (Carol) and said, ‘Let’s go look at the hole in the ground.’ A couple of weeks before, there was a (limestone) quarry over about three miles and they had a hole that fell in. So I thought maybe it was another one in my corn. But then, when we got out there, it was no hole. It was just a complete circle in our corn. SO IS YOUR FARM ON A LOT OF LIMESTONE? I’m not certain – the quarry is at least three miles away – but at the time I didn’t know"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"what else it could be. WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU SEE IN THE CORN? I just went out there and it was all counterclockwise. Jim Stahl’s in Geneseo was all clockwise, wasn’t it? RIGHT. Mine was counterclockwise and it was just like something set on top of it and just went down. There were no cornstalks scuffed, no ears of corn knocked off. There wasn’t a stalk outside that 46-foot-diameter circle! Everything was inside the circle. You know if you knocked corn down, it would fall into different rows. But this was neatly inside that 48-foot-diameter perfect circle. Actually, it was measured it at 46 feet, five inches. [ Editor’s Note: Carol Meyer sent me an aerial photograph taken by local pilot on August 25, 1991, which showed a second corn circle near old Highway 61 that ran in front of their farm house. She said it also measured 46-feet and was put down as someone's hoaxed copy of the first circle. \"We decided not to talk much about the second circle because we were afraid of being called crazy.\" ] IT WAS LIKE YOU PUT A COOKIE CUTTER DOWN AND EVERYTHING INSIDE WAS SWIRLED COUNTERCLOCKWISE? Ye s . HAD YOU EVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THAT BEFORE? No, but we had heard about a crop circle over in Illinois around that time (Milan, Illinois, 1990 - see report below.) DID YOU HAVE THE SHERIFF COME OUT TO LOOK AT THE CIRCLE? Yes. I called the Scott County Sheriff’s office right away and they came out and said about the same thing that Jim Stahl in Geneseo, Illinois, said now. The deputy called his dispatch and said, 'I don’t know how we’re going to report this. There’s a circle out here and there’s no signs of anything – not of anybody walking to it or anything like that.’ So, that was all they had and eventually they called it a hoax. BUT HOW COULD THAT BE IF THERE WERE NO TRACKS? I know, but they put it that way so they don’t have to go further and investigate it. THIS WAS A FIELD THAT DID NOT HAVE ANY TRAMLINES? Right, it didn’t have anything. The deputy and I looked around the outside edge of the circle for any foot marks and didn’t find anything. There were no footprints in there whatsoever, and there were no corn leaves pulled on the ground or anything. HOW WERE THE CORNSTALKS SWIRLED COUNTERCLOCKWISE? I don’t know. They just looked like they fell over. WERE THEY STRAIGHT? OR SWIRLED SOMEHOW? They were pretty straight, but there was not a one of them outside the edge of the circle. So there had to be some curve to it to stay inside. ALL THE PLANTS LEFT STANDING AROUND THE CIRCLE SEEMED UNTOUCHE D? Ye s , t h e y w e r e . WERE ALL OF THE CIRCLE STALKS LIKE THEY HAD FALLEN TO A POINT IN THE CENTER? Well, in the center, there were a couple of bare spots, just like the plants were turned out from there and the dirt was all there was. It was like they were all put down at one time. There weren’t stalks on top of another. It’s just like something sat down on the stalks and put them down neatly, but the leaves weren’t torn up or ears knocked off. But something took those plants down."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"C enter of corn circle nearest Coon Hunter Road found by Delmar and Carol Meyer on August 22, 1991. Photograph courtesy Carol and Delmar Meyer. THERE WERE NO PHYSICAL ABRASIONS ON THE CORN? No. IT SOUNDS AS IF THEY WOULD HAVE TO HAVE SOME SWIRL TO THE STALKS TO FIT IN THE CIRCLE. Yes, it was just so neat. DID YOU NOTICE ANY PURPLE-REDDISH DISCOLORATION ON ANY OF THE LEAVES OR CORN, LIKE JIM STAHL HAS HAD IN HIS SOYBEANS? There was nothing that anyone ever found. HOW CLOSE WAS THE CORN TO HARVEST ON AUGUST 22, 1991? You don’t harvest corn until around the end of September. WAS THERE ANYTHING UNUSUAL ABOUT THE CORN LAYED DOWN INSIDE THE CIRCLE COMPARED TO CORN IN THE REST OF THE FIELD? No. It all looked like normal corn that something had set down on it in a circle – without touching it! (laughs) Can you believe that?! THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER CORN CIRCLE REPORTS AND EVERYONE ASKS: HOW DO YOU TAKE THOSE THICK STEMS AND SWIRL THEM? All the corn root system in that circle was not broke off either. WHERE THE STEMS WENT INTO THE GROUND TO THE ROOTS, WERE THEY CURVED OVER WITHOUT CRACKS OR BREAKS? Ye s . VERY CLEANLY CURVED TO THE GROUND? Yes. Those stalks should have broken off! LIKE YOU WOULD FORM A PIPE TO CURVE TO THE GROUND? Ye s . WHO MEASURED THE 46 FEET, FIVE INCHES? We had our tape measure and measured it. And some people came down from Iowa City and they were in the field for quite awhile and they measured it over and over. [ Paranet investigators - see 1991 report below.] WHAT DID THEY SAY? They said it was unexplainable. They took samples and all that and they could not figure anything out. DID YOU HARVEST THE CORN IN THOSE 1991 CIRCLES?

No, nothing, until a couple of years ago, there was a farmer up by Tama, Iowa, who had a circle in his soybean field. I don’t know who it was. HOW FAR IS THAT FROM BLUE GRASS? 150 miles northwest. I believed him, too, when he said he had a circle he couldn’t explain. WAS IT IN SOYBEANS? Yes.
