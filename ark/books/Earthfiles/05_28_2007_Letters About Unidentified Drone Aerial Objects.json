Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Letters About Unidentified \"Drone\" Aerial Objects Â© 2007 by Linda Moulton Howe For background, please see previous Earthfiles: May 25, 2007: Two More Eyewitnesses of Aerial \"Drones\" in 2005 and 2006 May 15, 2007: Odd Aerial \"Drones\"? Over Lake Tahoe and Central California May 16, 2007: Engineer Comments About Odd Aerial \"Drone?\" Earthfiles May 21, 2007: Odd Aerial \"Drone\"? Photographed Again Over Capitola, California May 28, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Since first seeing the odd, dragonfly-shaped, unidentified aerial objects in the Chad images three weeks ago from Central California, I have been pursuing the hypothesis that the object is a \"black\" military project which is developing, or has developed, what some have called \"ion electrostatic propulsion.\" But exactly what agency is responsible and for exactly what purpose? The 2005 eyewitness, Shirley, in Sequoia National Park and the 2006 eyewitness, Mr. Smith, in Birmingham, Alabama, are solid citizens reporting what they have seen and Mr. Smith photographed. Both eyewitnesses - a year apart and both in the month of May - have seen an unidentified aerial object shaped like a dragonfly in the sky. In this Earthfiles report, I am sharing a few of the many emails I have received about the unidentified aerial objects that appear to range in size from a few feet to perhaps 25 feet and are unmanned. That is why I am using the term \"drone\" in my reports, an unmanned aerial vehicle, also known as UAVs. 1) From: D. P. Subject: More Aerial Drone Images from Maine Date: May 26, 2007 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com Definite Digital Manipulation Many Earthfiles viewers have written about the digitally manipulated photographs below. This email is representative of the public catching on to deliberate government misinformation tactics: \"In my mind there is no doubt that this strange insect-like vehicle is real. The picture showing the missing houses is nothing but a plant. Surely delivered by the government in order to take credibility away from the existence of such a craft.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"T homaston, Maine. \"Drone\" object in upper left cut in and pasted by digital manipulation.

I actually live not far from China Lake Naval Weapons Center, and between it and the Sequoia area. Big Pine, which is a small town on Hwy. 395, is where the big 'ears' that are set up to listen for 'noise' from outer space. We are not far from Area 51 over the Inyo and White Mts. to the East. There is a lot of government presence here, but most of it is very discreet. Of course, China Lake has a lot of activity and they fly over the Owens Valley and do mock training runs all the time. I also suspect some chemtrailing going on, but that is another topic I best leave alone. I am skeptical of some of the shots of the drones on your site because they appear to be photoshopped. They are too clear, the shadows don't match, the size is off, etc. However, I will tell you, drones are being used, and do exist in a variety of shapes and forms, and they are used for surveillance in many instances. By the way the photo of the truck and trailer in Arkansas looks to be classic government or law enforcement rig, probably doing some testing or maybe"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"surveillance. I would not say it was related to the drone sighting. It could have been part of an unrelated undercover operation or criminal investigation. If there were not any tags/plates, that is usually a sign. On July 19, 1999 I along with another man witnessed two very odd drones on Von Karman Avenue in Irvine, CA, take off from the top of the Bistango restaurant building, which is a pricey bar/restaurant housed in a large, dark/blackish granite, approximately 10 stories highrise building. Across the street from it is the old McDonnell Douglas tower (\"Tower 17\") that houses the local Orange County headquarters for the Dept. of Homeland Security TSA. It is a landmark, stands out and can be seen from the freeways nearby. These drones my associate and I sighted were dark L shaped without wings, and slender. They had propellers on the end that was straight. They took off at the same time, seemed to 'link up' in the air via some unseen string or force, then lined up identically and took off and up out of sight. When I asked the associate with me if he saw them, he said yes, and he didn't know what to think, or what they were. The sighting was so odd I have always remembered the exact date and location. I have never seen identical drones since although I did see one that resembled a small bat (!). The elimination of John Poindexter's Total Information Awareness program does not mean that it (massive data collection - most of it questionable in its legality) has really gone away, it has just taken on other forms. If the average person had any idea just how little privacy they really have, they'd jump off of cliffs like lemmings; that is all I can say. Please, if you refer to this email at all on Earthfiles or C2C, just refer to it as an anonymous former government person. God bless and good work, A friend.\" 3) From: Mr. Smith Subject: Birmingham, Alabama, \"Drone\" Above Power Line Date: May 26, 2007 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com \"Dear Ms. Howe, I saw your info on your site and appreciate it. Now today I see we are back to fake, so can you get me a job in Hollywood? What I saw is what appears on my photo (Birmingham, Alabama). I do not have time to play. I will go over details again for the Photoshop doubters. I work on a military base near the Alabama Georgia border and live on the Alabama side. I have a very small side-business of construction site clean-up and disposal. We usually have a small crew of part-timers who clean up for contractors. Sometimes people recommend us for projects of various sizes. I go and look the site over and take pictures of the site to show to my crew to see what they think. This is why I was taking pictures that day. I realized that the site was too big for our small crew and for our experience. The poles were part of the site. Power poles that were to feed power to the site and building. I heard a sound like a transformer and looked up. I saw something that looked like a fancy street light that I thought was part of the pole, just like a light would be. I moved a little to get a shot of it to show the guys. When I did I noticed that the thing was not attached to the pole, but was maybe attached to the wires, it did not move at all. It was stationary. I thought this is something new from Alabama Power. I'll take a picture and show the guys back at work when I see what they think about the job. I then went to find someone to ask what the power company was up to. When I found nobody who had time to look, I came back and the thing was gone. I thought, well, the power people got that out of here in a hurry. I figured they used a bucket, one was near, to move it. I thought that is weird and a little later I saw the trucks and trailers and thought that was weird again. I was impressed by the Dodge Rams and took a couple of pictures from my car with my cell phone. That is the end of the story until I saw a picture on the net that reminded me of the thing I saw. It might have been a balloon or kite or toy,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I don't know, but I saw it. I can't get involved with any crazy military stuff and there is plenty. I can understand why people just do not report things they see out here in the rural world because of the ignorant attacks. I do not even know what Photo Shopping is and do not want to know. My life is complicated enough. This week I showed my info to a friend of mine who was in the U. S. Air Force and he said for me to shut up. This was a friendly suggestion. I got in touch with him about me talking with you and he said he would do a little checking. He did and got back to me. He said do not speak by any type of phone because this will fix them right on top of you. He said that e-mail was less of a threat to them because it could be dealt with!!?? By the way he has a fairly high rank and is retired so I guess he knows what he is talking about. Why would my friend say that 'they' had less problems with email and who are 'they'?\" 4) From: Doctor of Optometry and Ph.D., Houston, Texas Subject: Forest Rangers in Double Roles Date: May 26, 2007 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com \"Great report tonight on Coast To Coast AM. I am writing to tell you about something unusual that happened to me, I would say about 7-10 years ago. I was at Peace Prayer Day in Espanola, NM, and decided to visit Chaco Canyon. This was before Chaco Canyon was a National Park. I have a life long interest in UFOs, growing up in Andrews, TX, near Roswell, NM. Anyway, while at Chaco Canyon, I attended a talk given by a forest ranger. He took me aside and asked if I would like to stay overnight for a view thru a telescope on the grounds. I said what telescope? He said, you'll see. I didn't tell him that I have an undergraduate degree in physics. Well this was quit a large telescope and I was very impressed. I asked some pretty good questions, so he said, 'Why don't you come into the trailer?' I went into the trailer and was blown away. The trailer looked like an old beat up camper. However, once inside, there was some of the most sophisticated electronic signal analyzing equipment I had ever seen. Multiple screens and digital imaging cameras. I kept my mouth shut and just ooooh'ed and ahhhhh'ed. I then asked the 'Ranger' for his name and he replied, 'Mr. Cornucopia' (I am not kidding about this!). It was all too weird for me, so I left. However, this was not an ordinary ranger. I don't know what was going on at Chaco Canyon. I later heard that a decade ago, it was a hot bed of UFO activity. Thought you might be interested in this masquerading ranger story. Keep up the great reports!\" 5) From: J. P. Subject: Unidentified Aerial Drones Date: May 26, 2007 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com \"Linda M Howe, I have had a discussion with a man who knows a little bit about drones due to his connection to Army Aviation. I don`t want to be quoted as a source of information or to implicate the man, who is still employed by DOD. However, for what it is worth, some drones are powered by batteries (electric motors) and some have solar panels. Don`t know whether the solar panels are supplementary to the batteries or the only source of power for the craft. Some drones can stay aloft for 10 hours, which makes them more economical to operate than jet fighters or choppers for tactical situations.The propellers on some models might not be visible from the ground.\" 6) From: R. S., Retired Engineer Subject: NASA Magnetically Levitated Drone Date: May 26, 2007 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com \"NASA Magnetically Levitated Ducted Fan Being Developed as a Propulsor"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Option for Electric Flight. See: http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT /2003/7000/7720emerson.html \"The NASA Glenn Research Center is developing a revolutionary engine concept called the Magnetically Levitated Ducted Fan. The objective of this work is to demonstrate the feasibility of a pollution-free electromagnetic propulsor for all-electric flight. This concept will help to reduce harmful emissions, to reduce the Nation's dependence on fossil fuels, and to mitigate many of the concerns and limitations encountered in conventional engine systems such as bearing wear, leaks, seal failure, and friction loss. The general concept is depicted in the following figure. E arly concept of the Magnetically Levitated Ducted Fan, courtesy NASA. \"This fully integrated system concept incorporates many advanced technologies into a new aeropropulsion system architecture. The innovative physical layout consists of a ducted fan drum rotor with blades attached at the outer diameter and supported by a stress tuner ring at the inner diameter. The drum rotor is made of composite material and is contained within a static shell assembly, or \"stator.\" Magnetic fields suspend and support the rotor assembly within the stator. The rotor is driven by modulated electromagnetic fields between the rotor and the stator. Optimal modulation will be achieved via the controller and power electronic drive circuitry between the power source and the propulsor. This concept exploits unique physical dimensions and a large available surface area to optimize a custom, integrated electromagnetic system that provides both levitation and propulsion functions. Advanced technologies developed for particle accelerators, and currently under development for maglev trains and rocket launchers, served as pathfinders for adaptation into the application. \"Development of this concept was funded through the Revolutionary Aeropropulsion Concepts (RAC) program beginning in 2003. During this first year, the focus of the work was on the development of the magnetic levitation system. The electromagnetic concept under investigation uses permanent magnet elements attached to the outer circumference of the rotor drum and wire coils placed in the stator shell. The permanent magnets are arranged in a Halbach configuration, which results in the production of a sinusoidally varying, periodic magnetic field in the vicinity of the stator coils. This magnetic array configuration was pioneered by Klaus Halbach for use in particle accelerators. When set in motion, the time-varying magnetic fields interact with the passive coils in the stator assembly to produce repulsive forces between the stator and the rotor, providing magnetic suspension. The beauty of this technique is that it is inherently stable once the rotor reaches a critical speed and, thus, requires no active feedback control or superconductivity as seen in many traditional implementations of magnetic suspension."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"S mall-scale levitation model rotor, courtesy NASA.

Photographed in Central California, on May 6, 2007, by Chad who requests anonymity. \"To date, theoretical calculations have been produced to predict the levitation forces developed by a cylindrical Halbach array and coil assembly. Early experimental hardware was successfully designed and developed that validated the basic principles and the theoretical work. On the basis of these findings, a small-scale system was designed that will serve as a levitation demonstration model. The rotor and stator of the demonstration model are shown in the preceding figures. The purpose of this model is to demonstrate stable suspension of a rotorlike body within a stator assembly. \"The next step in the development process will be to further develop the electromagnetic propulsion concept and integrate both the magnetic suspension and propulsion function into a single multifunction assembly. In addition to aircraft engines, this technology has potential application in ultraefficient motors, computer memory systems, manufacturing equipment, and space power systems such as flywheels."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"7) From Current Subcontractor for American Military Subject: Phantom Sentinel by Vera Tech Aero Corp. Date: May 26, 2007 12:48:41 PM MDT To: earthfiles@earthfiles.co See: Website about Phantom Sentinel. 8) From: T. C. Subject: 'Drones' possible Burkhard Heim devices? Date: May 26, 2007 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com \"Dear Linda, I have been recently investigating a theory on anti-gravity quantum theory by a German Physicist named Burkhard Heim in the 1950's. Dr. Heim passed away on January 14th, 2001, but he basically proposed a new theory on Gravitational Quantum Mechanics as an extension on Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. A few current physicists have been working on this theory and they feel they can produce a device that uses this theory for lift and possible faster than light (superluminal) space flight. What strikes me the most is that the proposed theory uses a rotating circular ring to create a dimensional interaction with an electromagnetic field, which in our 3-D spacetime shows up as an anti-gravity force. There are many papers on this subject from the German HPCC (High Performance Computing and Communication) web site (see links below), the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, the American AntiGravity web site, among others. Currently, the latest paper on the HPCC website, dated 23 April 2007, talks about an experiment with 'Extended' Heim Theory (EHT) which looked promising (see pages 12-13). The drones that have been seen make me think that someone has already passed this experimental stage and have created working atmospheric craft based on these theories, or something *very* close to it! See the links below: http://www.hpcc-space.de/ http://www.americanantigravity.com/articles/140/1/Heim-Quantum- Theory-for-Space-Propulsion/Page1.html http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10694827/ I don't have direct knowledge that Heim's Theory, Extended Heim Theory, or some other similar theory are the source of these crafts propulsion system, but I find it quite synchronous that I am lead to find this theory and driven to understand it, while at about the same time these drones are starting to be observed all over the place - all having a circular ring shaped central section - which matches the device specified in the theories! Whatever the case, good luck with any research into these craft, their origins, and propulsion systems!\" If any Earthfiles viewers or Coast to Coast AM listeners have seen a similar aerial craft or have any information about it, please email me at: earthfiles@earthfiles.com More Information: For further information about unusual aerial craft, please see Earthfiles Archive , such as the brief excerpt of reports below, and my books and documentaries in Earthfiles Shop : â¢ 11/05/2007 â CIA Origin of National Enquirer? â¢ 16/03/2007 â Tenth Anniversary of March 1997 Phoenix Lights: What Was the 2-Mile-Long Triangular Craft? â¢ 13/03/2007 â Part 4: Mysterious Events At 2005 Tawsmead Copse \"Insectogram\" Crop Formation â¢ 09/03/2007 â Zones of Fear and Diamond-Shaped Aerial Light â¢ 04/03/2007 â Part 2: Mysterious Events At 2005 Tawsmead Copse \"Insectogram\" Crop Formation â¢ 18/02/2007 â Part 4: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"â¢ 14/02/2007 â Part 3: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners â¢ 12/02/2007 â Part 2: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners â¢ 11/02/2007 â Part 1: Tappen, North Dakota, High Strangeness Provokes Many Emails from Viewers and Listeners â¢ 10/02/2007 â Part 12: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue â¢ 07/02/2007 â Part 11: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue â¢ 02/02/2007 â Blue Metallic \"Blimp\" Seen Over O'Hare Airport â¢ 30/01/2007 â Part 10: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue â¢ 16/01/2007 â Part 9: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue â¢ 02/01/2007 â Grey Aerial Disk Reported by Chicago O'Hare United Airlines Pilots and Mechanics â¢ 31/12/2006 â Part 8: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue â¢ 27/12/2006 â Part 7: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue â¢ 18/12/2006 â Part 6: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue â¢ 11/12/2006 â Part 5: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue â¢ 06/12/2006 â Part 4: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue â¢ 29/11/2006 â Part 3: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue â¢ 28/11/2006 â Part 2: Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue â¢ 27/11/2006 â Inside Saucer Post ...3-0 Blue Â© 1957 by Leonard H.
