Dr. Jerome Hunsaker (MJ-7) was director of NACA in 1947. NASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration evolved from NACA in 1957. NAVSPASUR Acronym for the Naval Space Surveillance System constructed in 1959 as a dedicated space surveillance system with transmitters at Lake Kickapoo, Texas; Gila River, Arizona; and Jordan Lake, Arkansas. NBS National Bureau of Standards, that housed the Central Radio (Wave) Propagation Laboratory (CRPL), Boulder, Colorado. NDRC National Defense Research Council of OSRD. \"NEPA\" Proword for a space nuclear propulsion project of the Atomic Energy Commission in 1946 through 1948. NORAD North American Aerospace Defense Command is a joint United States and Canadian organization which provides aerospace warning and aerospace control for North America. It was founded on May 12, 1958, under the name North American Air Defense Command. Since 1963, NORAD's main technical facility has been located inside Cheyenne Mountain near Colorado Springs, Colorado. While the terms \"NORAD\" and \"Cheyenne Mountain\" are often used interchangeably to describe the facility, NORAD is the name of the Command, while Cheyenne Mountain is the name of the facility. The facility is hosted by the U.S. Air Force, under the command of the 721st Mission Support Group, part of the 21st Space Wing, headquartered out of Peterson Air Force Base. NRL Naval Research Laboratory. Stennis Space Center, Mississippi, 45 miles northeast of New Orleans, Louisiana, (NRL-SSC) is the major center for in-house Navy research and development in oceanography, marine geology, geophysics, geoacoustics, and geotechnology. Stennis Space Center is NASA's primary center for rocket propulsion testing and home to NASA's Applied Sciences Directorate. Another NRL facility is in Monterey, California: the Fleet Numerical Meteorology and Oceanography Center which is the only scientific center in the Navy wholly dedicated to atmospheric research. Another NRL facility is the Chesapeake Bay Detachment (CBD), which provides facilities and support services for research in radar, electronic warfare, optical devices, materials, communications, and fire research. CBD also hosts facilities of the Navy Technology Center for Safety and Survivability, which conducts fire research on simulated carrier, surface, and submarine platforms. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"NRO National Reconnaissance Office jointly operated since 1961 by NSA, CIA, Air Force Systems Command under the National Security Council (NSC) to design, construct, operate and maintain high altitude aircraft, satellites and other national technical means to conduct strategic surveillance and espionage. NRO was created under the Kennedy Administration in a push to create a permanent reconnaissance organization. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and his deputy, Roswell Gilpatric, produced a September 9, 1961, letter to the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) Allen Dulles established the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). NRO was to be responsible for all satellite and aerial overflights over denied territory, including the CORONA, ARGON, LANYARD, GAMBIT, and SAMOS satellite programs and U-2, A-12, ST/POLY overflight programs. Two key features of the early NRO were the joint directorship and the lack of special assignment of functions to the Air Force and CIA. The joint directorship was a result, in part, of Dulles' fear that the CIA would be held liable for actions taken by Air Force personnel. NRO and NSA operate ground and space based sensors to track and catalog space borne objects as well as SDOC (Space Defense Operations Center). Many inside sources describe NRO as directly involved with monitoring and interacting with the UFO phenomenon. NSA National Security Agency. On July 26, 1947, only three weeks after one or more discs allegedly crashed in the Roswell, New Mexico region, President Harry Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, establishing a new post-WWII focus on America's perceived national security issues. One of the agencies that evolved from that act was the Armed Forces Security Agency (AFSA) that had been created on May 20, 1949, in the Department of Defense under the command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The AFSA was to be responsible for directing the communications and electronic intelligence activities of military intelligence units such as the Army Security Agency, Naval Security Group and the Air Force Security Service. However, the agency had little power and lacked a centralized coordination mechanism. So, the idea for NSA began in a December 10, 1951, memo sent by Walter Bedell Smith to James B. Lay, Executive Secretary of the National Security Council. The super spy agency was official on June 13, 1952, by an Executive Order of President Harry S. Truman which was classified. NSC National Security Council. Also emerging from the National Security Act of 1947, the NSC held its first meeting on September 24, 1947 at the White House. That very day, and likely in that same meeting, the MJ-12 document discusses an executive order by President Truman to create the MJ-12 Special Studies Group. NSF National Science Foundation. The NSF also evolved from a National Security Act provision for funding basic research into the applied sciences to allow any program operated by NSF that discovered a physical principal, event or relationship that might apply to the national security interests of the U. S. to be immediately \"militarized.\" Such a national security classification would automatically put the discovery under the direct control of the Research and Development Board (RDB) of the Secretary of Defense in the Pentagon. NSF was established on May 10, 1950. ONR Office of Naval Research. ORI Office of Research and Innovations, U. S. Navy. OSI Office of Scientific Intelligence, Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). OSRD Office of Scientific Research and Development of the Office of Emergency Management in the Executive Office of the President. From 1940 to 1947, OSRD was directed by Dr. Vannevar Bush (MJ-2) who was President of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D. C. Dr. James Conant, President of Harvard College in Cambridge, Massachusetts, served as Deputy Director. Dr. Lloyd Berkner (MJ-12) served as deputy following Dr. Conant's return to Harvard. Dr. Detlev Bronk (MJ-6) was OSRD's principal manager of medical research and worked with General Twining's (MJ-4) AMC, especially on matters related to high altitude research and human physiology. All V-2 rocket testing and the establishment of White Sands Proving Ground in New Mexico was the direct responsibility of OSRD.

[ A confidential government insider says the law allows certain U. S. government officials to materially misrepresent, disavow knowledge, or intentionally mislead and deceive any natural person, including Congress and the judicial branch, in sworn testimony regarding any act, event or program that effects the security interests of the U. S. Only two people are exempt from officially sanctioned misrepresentation (lies) - the President and his National Security Advisor. This provision of the National Security Act of 1947 was still classified in 1995 after this manuscript was completed. \"PROJECT Y\" Los Alamos, NM School for Boys became Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory (LASL), which became the Atomic Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL).

RAND Project RAND of the Douglas Aircraft Company evolved into the RAND Corp. in November 1948, a private, nonprofit research and development organization. RAND is an abbreviation for Research and Development Division - Douglas Aircraft Company. RAND has had a \"special relationship\" with U. S. Air Force Systems Command and the Aerospace Corporation. In July 1948, it developed another special relationship, one with the Atomic Energy Commission in RAND's Physics Department which was physically separated from other RAND divisions and required an AEC \"Q\" clearance for access. Later R AND developed other special relationships with the Ford Foundation, the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D. C., and with the Rockefeller Institute. RAND's only clients in its first two decades of existence were the U. S. Air Force and the Atomic Energy Commission. [ Source: The RAND Corporation © 1966 by Bruce L. R. Smith, Harvard Univ.

Rockefeller Institute A private, non-profit research and development institute financed by John D. Rockefeller, primarily for medical research. Dr. Detlev Bronk (MJ-6) became President of the Rockefeller Institute in 1948. David Rockefeller served as Chairman of the Board of Trustees. In 1995, the Department of Energy published that the Rockefeller Institution was working cooperatively with the AEC to collect and analyze biological tissue samples from corpses of human infants and living animals worldwide to determine the extent of nuclear testing contamination from the late 1940s through 1980.
