Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Crop Formations Continue in Canada © 1999 by Linda Moulton Howe September 29, 1999 Acadia Valley, Alberta, Canada A farmer reported that his work crew found a formation in his durum wheat field on September 21st. Researcher Judy Arndt went to the field that day to survey and reported that \"the seed was mature, pointing to a date of formation near the date of discovery.\" The formation consists of a 60-foot-diameter circle connected to two smaller 30-foot-diameter circles. Diagram: Acadia Valley, Alberta, Canada durum wheat formation survey © 1999 by crop formation researcher, Judy Arndt. Judy took a photograph from the western 30-foot diameter circle looking east through the corridors. She says, \"All plants were laid close to the ground. Weed stems are still horizontal at the base, but the branches are growing upwards to the light. (But) the wheat remains horizontal.\" Looking east inside Acadia Valley, Alberta, Canada durum wheat formation discovered September 21st © 1999 by Judy Arndt. Judy also took a photograph standing at the center inside the central 30-foot- diameter circle in which all the plants were laid closely to the ground and swirled clockwise around a patch of bare ground. In contrast, the large 60-foot diameter circle has hundreds of small standing plants \"distributed evenly all over the circle.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Close-up at center of 30-foot-diameter central circle © 1999 by Judy Arndt. Judy reported that she found many deformed growth nodes and expulsion cavities in the flattened crop inside the Acadia Valley formation. She said, \"While we were examining nodes, we noticed that the grain in the east circle, in an area from the center towards magnetic north, had the highest number of nodes that were severely distorted.\" Diagram: Survey highlighting in red dots where growth nodes in durum wheat plants were re-oriented and exploded outward inside the Acadia Valley, Alberta, Canada formation © 1999 by Judy Arndt. In Judy's photograph below, six re-oriented growth nodes clearly show holes where cell water exploded outward. Biophysicist W. C. Levengood hypothesizes that the formations are created by a spinning plasma vortex that contains microwave and electronic frequencies. The microwaves, he postulates, heat up the cell water in the growth nodes enough to burst outward creating the holes, but the energy is not sustained long enough to cook the plants.

More Information: Judy and her husband, Mike Arndt, collected soil and grain samples from the Acadia Valley circles and corridors to send to the BLT Research Team for analyses by biophysicist, W. C. Levengood. To date, he has discovered a pattern of similar metabolic changes in the mitochondria of affected plant cells from formation to formation and country to country that are not found in normal control plants or plants sampled in known hoaxes.
