Bobbink and his uncle, Robert Boerman, first visited the site soon after discovery to measure and sample plants. In addition to their diagram around August 1, the aerial photograph also shows eight circles in the tail. August 9, 2001 Stadskanaal, Holland On August 1, 2001, Robert Boerman, crop circle researcher and producer of a Netherlands website, www.dcca.nl, received a report of a new formation in Stadskanaal shaped like a \"scorpion\" with an eight circle tail. This was the second formation in the 2001 season discovered in Stadskanaal. Boerman went to the farm owned by J. A. Adams with his nephew, Jan Willem Bobbink, to measure and sample crop. Jan Willem used dowsing rods to determine energy ley lines. He drew a black and white diagram of the \"scorpion\" and the energy lines in red shown above. Boerman and Bobbink thought the formation was at least a week old at the time and concluded it first emerged around July 24, 2001. A week after that first visit, Dutch physicist Eltjo Haselhoff, Chairman of the Dutch "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"CCCS crop circle research organization, called Boerman to ask about another visit so that Eltjo could do his own sampling and measurements. So, on Tuesday, August 7, 2001, Boerman and his nephew, Bobbink, returned to the latest Stadskanaal formation with Haselhoff. In his website report about what happened, Robert Boerman wrote: \"After we were ready with the sampling, we took some nice photos (of) ourselves for the archive and I had to go to the tail to take some pole shots of the head of the formation. When I entered the 8th circle, I was stupefied to see that there was a brand new circle added to the tail! I counted and re-counted the circles of the tail. There were 9 circles instead of the 8 we counted before. During our research, there was an extra circle added. Just like that, and we didn't see or hear anything. About ten minutes before, Jan Willem had taken some samples from the last circle, the 8th of the tail, and he didn't see a new circle. He is 200% sure that there wasn't a new circle at that time.\" Pole shot of the \"scorpion\" crop formation tail photographed by Robert Boerman during his first trip to Stadskanaal August 2, 2001.

Boerman's nephew, Jan Willem Bobbink had been taking plant samples from the 8th circle only ten minutes before Boerman discovered the startling emergence of the 9th circle. On Thursday, August 9, I talked with Robert Boerman about the transformation that seemed to occur at some point in a ten minute period on August 7 around 3 p.m. under a bright sun and blue sky in Stadskanaal. Interview: Robert Boerman, Crop Circle Researcher and Producer of Dutch Crop Circle Archives www.dcca.nl, Brummen, The Netherlands : \"We visited the formation some days before and measured everything. We found some blown (growth) nodes and we think, 'That's nice that we find something like that.''"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Blown node in a wheat stem found in the \"scorpion\" formation at Stadskanaal, Holland. Photograph © 2001 by Jan Willem Bobbink. See his website below. Biophysicist W. C. Levengood of Michigan was the first scientist to study crop formation plants and report in the respected botany journal, Physiologia Plantarum , that one of the physical effects found repeatedly in unusual crop formations were brown holes in growth nodes that he linked to heating of plant cell water by microwave energy causing the cell water to explode from the growth nodes. Biophysicist Levengood's hypothesis is that a \"spinning plasma vortex\" of complex energies including microwaves interacts with plants when the formations occur, but he does not yet know the source of the spinning plasma vortices. 'The second day when we entered the formation together with Eltjo Hasselhoff and my nephew, Jan Willem Bobbink, we did some samplings as Eltjo Hasselhoff does. We measured again the complete formation which was about 40 meters (130 feet) long and the largest head ring was about 22 meters (72 feet) in diameter. ACCORDING TO THE NETHERLANDS NEWSPAPER Het Nieuwsblad Van Het Noorden , SOMETHING UNUSUAL HAPPENED TO YOUR BODIES. WHAT HAPPENED? My nephew was again at the tail of the formation to take some samples in the 8th circle, the last circle of the tail. He came back to us, Eltjo and me, and we decided, 'OK, gu ys, we h ave go t everyt h in g. Let 's go h o me.' Then I had the feeling that I had to go again into the formation to take some pole shots (camera up on a pole to image more from above) and I walked to the tail. I said, 'What is this? A ninth circle!' A complete new circle appeared there during our research. Ninth new circle added to the \"scorpion's\" previous tail of eight circles at Stadskanaal, Hollandaround 3 p.m. on August 7, 2001.

Photograph © 2001 by Robert Boerman. DID YOU HAVE SOME PHYSICAL EXPERIENCES ON YOUR ARMS AND LEGS? Yes, when I saw the 9th circle, I was completely astonished. I counted and recounted the circles in the tail and there were nine, including the new one. Then I shouted to Eltjo, 'Come over here. A new circle!' And he looked very amazed. Then we took some photos and one or two minutes later, I feel a pain in my legs. PAIN? Ye s . WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE PAIN IN YOUR LEGS WAS PRICKLY, OR LIKE A NUMB FEELING OR LIKE A HOT FEELING OR...? Like prickling feeling. I don't remember it very good because we were completely astonished about the discovery of the new circle. And then the feeling that I had to go out of the field. I don't know why, but I just ran out of the field. And then about 30 minutes later we entered the formation again and then my legs feel OK. The pain was gone. AND WAS IT IN YOUR ARMS AS WELL? Eltjo had it in his left arm and left wrist and I feel it in both my legs up to my knees. YOU KNEW YOU HAD TO GET OUT OF THE FIELD? DID ELTJO FEEL THE SAME WAY? No, Eltjo was only completely astonished as a Dutch scientist. He said, 'Wow, it cannot be!' THAT IT COULD NOT HAPPEN WHILE YOU WERE RIGHT THERE? Right, it cannot be. AND YOU HAD NOT SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING UNUSUAL? We had not seen or heard anything abnormal. Nothing. YOU GO BACK A HALF HOUR LATER AND YOU FEEL BETTER, HOW DOES THIS CIRCLE LOOK IN TERMS OF THE WAY THE CROP WAS LAID DOWN COMPARED TO THE OTHER EIGHT PREVIOUS CIRCLES? Beautiful! Really, it was a beautiful circle. A diameter of about 1.40 meters (4.5 feet). And the center of the circle was standing crop, but it was bent inside the center, bent down. DID THE NEW 9TH CIRCLE CROP SEEM TO BE LAID DOWN MORE SMOOTHLY OR MORE FLUIDLY? Yes. Yes. You looked at the other circles and they were about a week and a half old. But the new one, it looked real nice. Very beautiful."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"AND DID YOU TOUCH THE PLANTS AND SOILS IMMEDIATELY WHEN YOU DISCOVERED THE CIRCLE AND NOTICE ANY HEAT? My nephew, Jan Willem, he felt with his hands and he told us that they felt warm. I tried, but I was completely astonished so I didn't feel it. But he told me it felt warm. And then I had the feeling that I had to go (because of the leg pain). So I didn't feel it any more. DID ELTJO, A PHYSICIST, DID HE FEEL THE PLANTS AND SOIL AND NOTICE ANY HEAT? I thought he said to me that he felt warmth also. We were just looking at each other and saying, 'It is impossible!' That is the only thing we could say. This can't be happening while we were there. This is impossible. So we didn't talk about how it maybe came there or what reason or how or why. We just looked at each other and said, 'This can't be!' But we are working on a theory that we think can explain the blown nodes, how the crop is laid down, how it is bent, how it is broken, the balls of light. IS IT CONSISTENT WITH DR. LEVENGOOD'S WORK THAT DESCRIBES A SPINNING PLASMA VORTEX THAT HAS MICROWAVE ENERGY IN IT THAT INTERACTS WITH THE CROPS AND THE SOIL? Yes. We think we know why most of the worldwide crop circles appear in England. BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH LIMESTONE THERE? Yes. That's one of the reasons you get. BEYOND THE LIMESTONE AND CHALK, WHAT DO YOU THINK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR, OR BEHIND, THE CREATION OF THE SPINNING PLASMA VORTICES? That we try to find out. We will finish our theory this winter and the next step is next year to do a lot of measurements and research on frequencies and everything we can measure inside crop circles. And then the next step is a lot of clues to make a crop circle without entering the field. That's our next step. If we succeed making a crop circle without entering the field and we find the blown nodes and all the other stuff, then we know which technique the crop circle makers use. After that, we want to try making formations without being in the field. The next step after that is communication and maybe in the future, we meet some of the 'guys' (crop circle creators). I don't know, but that's a far away future. DO YOU THINK THIS IS A NON-HUMAN INTELLIGENCE THAT WOULD FALL INTO THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL CATEGORY? OR AS SOME THINK, THE ANGELIC CATEGORY? I don't know. I don't have the answer to that, but as I said, we will try to finish our theory. If we are right, we want to create crop circles out in the field. If we know the technique, then the next step is communication. Then maybe we will be allowed to ask, 'OK, guys, who are you?' AND IF YOU CAN DO IT NOT BEING PHYSICALLY ON THE SOIL AND PLANTS IN THE FIELD, WOULD YOU BE DOING THIS FROM SOMETHING ABOVE THE FIELD PUTTING DOWN A PATTERN OF ENERGY ONTO THE FIELD? Yeah, you can compare it to that. AND I'M ASSUMING IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH RESONANCE FREQUENCIES AROUND THE GLOBE? Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"WHAT DO YOU AND THE PHYSICIST, ELTJO HASELHOFF, THINK IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE MYSTERIOUS LIGHTS AND THE CROP FORMATIONS? Eltjo's research connects spherical energies above the crop to plants going down in formations. I don't know what the balls of lights are. Maybe it's intelligence that is controlled? Or maybe the lights are on their own. I don't know that. But there is a relationship. Absolutely. And as Levengood told us about the plasma vortex theory, it fits exactly our theory.\" We b s it e s : http://www.dcca.nl http://www.mysteriesoftheunknown.cjb.net Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
