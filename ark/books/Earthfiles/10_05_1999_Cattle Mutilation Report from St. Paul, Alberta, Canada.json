Fern Belzil, Mutilation Investigator, St. Paul, Alberta, Canada: \"This is a report of a mutilation that took place only ten kilometers from St. Paul and fifteen kilometers from my ranch. This was a Hereford Simmental cross herd bull reported to me on June 6, 1999. The rancher and his son estimated that the bull had died about 24 hours before they found him. It took some time to find him because (the bull) was mutilated in the bush among willows and poplar trees. They phoned me as soon as they found him and I was on site to investigate within an hour. By then, the bull was starting to swell up, but had not decayed nor was there a foul smell as yet. As you will see by the photographs (head slightly out of focus), half of the nose (front portion) was cut out, one eyelid was removed, a 1-inch deep cut was made about an inch long just below the left eye amd the left ear was cut close to the skull. Photograph © 1999 by Fern Belzil, St. Paul, Alberta, Canada. The penis and scrotum were removed. The oval cut on the stomach was 16 x 12 inches and it looked like a surgical cut. The flesh where it had been skinned showed no signs of teeth marks or any other abnormality. Looking very closely at the excisions, some of the hair was cut. At the scrotum area, the excision was about the same size as the one on the belly area also exhibiting neat excisions.

Furthermore, adjacent to the belly excision, I also noticed a hairless spot approximately two inches in diameter. I have found these hairless spots on about a dozen mutilations so far.\" More Information: If mutilations are reported within 24 hours, necropsies and pathology analyses can be done as well as soil and plant analyses.
