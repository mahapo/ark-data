Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. \"THE SOUTH AFRICAN UFO CRASH/RETRIEVAL AFFAIR: A CASE STUDY OF UFOLOGICAL FACT, FICTION, FRAUD, FRUSTRATION - AND HOPE South Africa, irrespective of its apartheid problem, is a modern, progressive, high-tech nation reported to be in possession of nuclear weapons. It is a likely spot on the globe for UFO surveillance - if technological modernity is a reason. Accordingly, reports abound in that region going back to the early 1950s. Such include landings, close encounters with strange entities and a crash of a saucer near Johannesburg in 1953 which, to my surprise, was confirmed by a CIA person with whom I had contact in the late 1970s, especially during the period when I began my probes into the C/R syndrome. Albeit, thanks to Cynthia Hind, a resident of Zimbabwe, and a veteran MUFON researcher, many well-investigated UFO reports in South Africa and its contiguous countries, have reached the rest of the world. Then in 1989 came the news of a major crash incident in the Kalahari Desert of Botswana, near the South African border. It shook the UFO community - first in Europe where it appeared to be a major breakthrough; then it shifted suddenly into the United States in a mish mosh of reports from diverse sources. Most of it focused on one informant - James Hendrik Van Greunen. Desperate, and willing to reveal over 500 pages of secret documents to support his allegations about his role in the retrieval operation, he stressed the need for a lot of money to escape South Africa. Under surveillance for breaching security, he claimed he had the right connection to elude the authorities before facing trial for treason. Once safe in Europe, he vowed he would cooperate and share his bonanza of secrets. To say the least, the Kalahari crash soon developed into a complex super drama. Apart from its superstar, Van Greunen, the investigators who played key roles, deserve a hearing. To put the case into some orderly perspective, it is separated into six parts as follows: 1) ENTER JAMES H. VAN GREUNEN Tony Dodd, a respected British researcher and retired police officer, explains how he got the first news of the Kalahari crash and retrieval, quoting in part, from Quest International (Vol. 9, No. 2, 1989) as follows: Tony Dodd, UK: 'During the first week in July 1989, I received information from a South African source to the effect that a UFO had been shot down by a South African fighter aircraft on the 7th of May 1989 and that the object had crashed in the central Kalahari Desert. The object had been recovered intact, together with two live alien beings, and taken to a South African Air Force Base. The South Africans were quickly joined by American Air Force personnel who had flown out from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. A letter from my contact read as follows: Tony Dodd's Contact: South African intelligence do not have the facilities or knowledge to pursue this matter alone. According to the base commander, it is the third space craft they have retrieved in the past ten years over the South African continent. We were told to keep "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"everything under wraps as it may cause panic in an orthodox religious country. They told us that they would keep us informed as to any further developments. I hope that this letter reaches you in one piece because if it is intercepted, I will be in a great deal of trouble. Please let me know as soon as you receive it. Unfortunately, we were not allowed to take cameras inside with us for obvious reasons. I am sending you some government copies of the briefing notes separately. I won't be able to sign my name or address to accompany these documents in case the letter is intercepted. A couple weeks later, I received a package from South Africa containing a letter and five pages of a briefing document. The document carried the South African Air Force Crest at the top of the page and was headed: 'Classified Top Secret - Do Not Divulge' (etc.).\" Stringfield: Dodd was understandably discreet in his first reportorial disclosure of the South African crash affair. His source, or sources, were not identified and he deleted or changed the names of certain sensitive items in the 5-page document. The question remains: who was Dodd's correspondent? Or shall we ask, the bona fide informant? Is he still unknown to research? Or was it James Van Greunen, who was preparing for his trip to England where he would make further disclosures? If such were the case, Van Greunen was at first warmly received and became a guest in the home of Henry Azadehdel. But their relations soon went sour when Henry, the host, made phone calls to check on the credentials of his guest, James. Suspicion led to alienation and suddenly, Van Greunen was forced to leave his 'safe house' and made a hasty return to South Africa. When I was in touch with the Van Greunen in Africa in December 1989, and later after his escape to Germany, Henry informed me sometime during that period that the real informant was not Van Greunen . When I asked about the whereabouts of the real one, I was told that he was safe in South America. Some of the evasive haze that prevailed at that time has since, thanks to Henry, cleared a little. There is now a glimmer of hope that a crash of 'something' did occur on May 7, 1989, in the Kalahari Desert. 2) THE FIVE-PAGE DOCUMENT I have seen several versions of the so-called five-page document with the code names either deleted or changed. Following is a retyped 'uncensored' copy of the original Top Secret South African Air Force document: Page 1 SOUTH AFRICAN AIR FORCE CLASSIFIED TOP SECRET - DO NOT DIVULGE DEPARTMENT OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATIONS AND RESEARCH (DSIR) DEPARTMENT OF AIR FORCE INTELLIGENCE (DAFI) DATE: 7 May 1989 SUBJECT: Unidentified Flying Object CODE NAME: SILVER DIAMOND FILE NUMBER: 2345-A2-1C DESIGNATION: Valhalla AFB - Pretoria DESIGNATED CHANNEL: RED/TOP SECRET RESTRICTED ACCESS: Illuminated Nine PRIORITY CODE: D-4 SPECTRUM LOT: Blue"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" DEFENSE COMPUTER PASS CODE - PROCEED WITH CAUTION CONTENTS: Case History Craft Specifications Humanoid Specifications Conclusions Page 2 CLASSIFIED TOP SECRET - DO NOT DIVULGE CASE HISTORY At 13M45 GMT on 7 May 1989, the naval frigate 'SA Tafalberg' radioed Cape Town naval headquarters to report an unidentified flying object that appeared on radar scopes, heading towards the African continent in a North westerly direction at a calculated speed of 5745 nautical miles per hour. Naval headquarters acknowledged and confirmed that object was also tracked by airborne radar, military ground radar installations and D. F. Malan International Airport at Cape Town. The object entered South African air space at 13M52 GMT. Radio contact was attempted with object, but all communications to object proved futile. Valhalla Air Force Base was notified and two armed Mirage fighters were scrambled. The object suddenly changed course at great speed which would be impossible for military aircraft to duplicate. At 13M52 GMT squadron leader, Goosen, reported that they had radar and visual confirmation of the object. The order was given to arm and fire the experimental aircraft mounted Thor 2 laser cannon at object. This was done. Squadron leader, Goosen, reported that several blinding flashes emanated from the object. The object started wavering whilst still heading in a northerly direction. At 14M02, it was reported that the object was decreasing altitude at a rate of 3,000 feet per minute. Then at South African border with Botswana identified as the Central Kalahari Desert, Squadron leader, Goosen, was instructed to circle the area until a retrieval of the object was complete. A team of air force intelligence officers, together with medical and technical staff, were promptly taken to area of impact for investigations and retrieval. The findings were as follows: 1. A crater of 150 metres in diameter and 12 metres in depth. 2. A silver colored disc shaped object 45 degrees embedded inside of crater. 3. Around object sand and rocks were fused together by the intense heat. 4. An intense magnetic and radioactive environment around object resulted in electronic failure in air force equipment. 5. It was suggested by team leader that object be moved to a classified air force base for further investigation and this was done. The terrain of impact was filled with sand and rubble to disguise all evidence of this event having ever taken place. CLASSIFIED TOP SECRET - DO NOT DIVULGE Page 3 CRAFT SPECIFICATIONS: The following are specifications as indicated by preliminary investigations at classified air force base. TYPE OF CRAFT: Unknown - suspected extraterrestrial ORIGIN: Unknown - suspected extraterrestrial "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"IDENTIFIABLE MARKINGS: None - curious insignia forged into metal on side of craft. DIMENSIONS: Length - 20 yards approximately Height - 0.5 yards approximately Weight - 50,000 kilograms estimated MATERIAL OF CONSTRUCTION: Unknown - pending further laboratory results. Outer surface of object flawless, polished, smooth silver color. No visible seams noted inside or on outer surface of craft. Perimeter showed 12 unevenly spaced, flush with outer surface oval-shaped portholes. SOURCE OF PROPULSION: Unknown - pending laboratory results. NOTES: a) A hydraulic type landing gear was fully deployed suggesting that electronic malfunction caused object to crash. This may have been due also to Thor 2 laser cannon being fired at craft. b) While the investigation team observed the object at classified air force base, a low sound was heard. It was then noted that a hatch or entrance on lower side of craft had opened slightly. This opening area was later forced open with the use of hydraulic pressure equipment. c) Two humanoid entities clothed in tight fitting grey suits emerged and were promptly taken to make-shift medical centre, level 6 of classified air force base.
