May 2, 2000 Sardegna, Italy - Adriano Forgione, Director of HERA Magazine reports: \"A crop formation on the Island of Sardegna, Italy appeared to be discovered May 2nd. The formation is composed of a circular shape with other three little (ones around it): three little rings, an Egyptian crux (ankh) and a little key. The length of the entire formation is 32 meters. Sardegna, like southwest England, is a land full of megalithic Neolithic structures. (No photographs yet available). May 13, 2000 Lockeridge, Wiltshire - Two triangles of different sizes touching point to point in flowering oilseed rape. Stuart Dike of www.cropcircleconnector.com took this photograph and reported, \"The floor pattern on the smaller of the two triangles was not spiraled, but flattened in three directions in unison with its three sides. But the larger two triangles had a floor pattern flowing in one direction up to its apex. The smaller triangle had sides in these lengths: 5.6, 6.5 and 6.2 meters. The larger triangle had sides 8.3 meters at the base with 14.3 meters and 16.5 meters along the left and side tramline.\" Stuart and another photographer, Peter R. Sorensen, both commented on many broken stems snapped half way down in these triangles raising suspicions of human creation. See more details at http://www.cropcircleconnector.com.
