Stockbroker Gerald Inman first found the deer in the tree on the first day of deer and gun season, November 18, 2002. This photograph was taken on December 7, 2002, after Mr. Inman returned with New York State Wildlife Technician 2, Scott Van Arsdale, to see if the deer were still there and to try to find out what happened.

Yellow mark designates the wilderness area north of Long Eddy, New York, in Delaware County, New York, where hunter, Gerald Inman, on November 18, first discovered a young male deer 12 feet up in the crotch of a maple tree. December 28, 2002 Long Eddy, New York - Deer and gun season both "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"opened in the heavily wooded southwestern corner of Delaware County, New York, across the river from Wayne County, Pennsylvania, on November 18. The night before it had snowed covering everything white. Hunter Gerald Inman, a stockbroker from West Nyack, Rockland County, New York, was at first disoriented by the sight of a deer hanging in the middle of all the white trees in front of him. Upon closer inspection, Mr. Inman estimated the deer was hanging between two branches about twelve feet or more off the ground. There were no signs of blood or struggle. Later, he told his hunting club buddies. They all laughed and told him he was crazy. But Jim Hudgins from Gerald's hunting club explored the area himself and also found the deer in the tree on Dec. 7, 2002. He reported the peculiar find to the Bureau of Wildlife in the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the case went to Scott Van Arsdale for investigation. Scott is a Wildlife Technician 2 in the Bureau of Wildlife and says no one in the department can recall anyone before ever finding a deer so high and so tightly lodged in the crotch of a tree. Scott went with Gerald Inman, Jim Hudgins and another man back to the site in mid-December. The snow was so deep, the men could not drive to the hunting cabin. So the group hiked in about 1.5 miles and carried a tall aluminum ladder to get the deer down. I asked Scott Van Arsdale what happened. Interview: Scott Van Arsdale, Wildlife Technician 2, Bureau of Wildlife, New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), Stamford, New Yo r k : \" The deer was wedged belly down in the crotch of the tree with its front feet and head hanging down on one side of the tree and its hind legs hanging down on the other end. It wasn't a very wide tree, so this deer drooped down on both sides of the crotch. Another closer view on December 7, 2002 of the 70-pound male deer wedged tightly between two branches of a maple tree at least twelve feet off the ground. Digital image © 2002 by Jim Hudgins. WHERE THAT NOTCH WAS OR BRANCHES WAS A FULL 12 FEET OFF THE GROUND? Yes, it was. Or more. OBVIOUSLY THE DEER DIDN'T JUMP AND SPRING UP THERE? Right. It was just a little too far. Deer can probably jump about a maximum of ten feet. But it was actually down hill behind the deer so it would have been more than a 12-foot jump for it. It had a wounded foot, too, which the pathologist did not mention, but it had a swollen front foot. So, I doubt it was moving around too good to begin with. I'm sure it could get through the woods fine, but to have a little deer jump that far was just a little bit beyond the realm of what you consider possible, I think."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"WHAT HAPPENED FOR YOU TO GET THE DEER OUT OF THE BRANCHES AND OFF TO YOUR PATHOLOGIST? We tried everything we could to get the deer out of the tree with the tree still standing, climbing up on the ladder and pushing on the deer. We tied a rope to it and had some of the guys pull and others pushed on the deer. We put the ladder under the deer's front legs, between the tree and front legs, and two of us picked up on the ladder. And we are talking, some of the guys were pretty big! One is an ex-football player, actually, and we just couldn't get that deer loose. So, one of the fellows hiked back to their hunting camp to get an ax. We didn't have a chain saw. We decided to chop the tree down. The four of us took turns with the ax and dropped the tree so we could get to the deer. Even then, we had difficulty removing it. We had to push and pull on the deer until we got it about five extra feet up from the crotch before the two tree trunks were wide enough to slip the thing out. THIS WAS ALMOST A MONTH AFTER THE OPENING OF DEER SEASON WHEN MR. INMAN FIRST FOUND IT UP THERE IN THE BRANCHES? Right. It was just short of a month. It's been a very cold fall around here, so the deer was well preserved. WHAT HAPPENED NEXT? We put it on a sled and took it back out to the road and I delivered it as soon as I possibly could to pathology, Dr. Ward Stone, in Albany. Pathologist Reports Deer Killed by Bow and Arrow CAN YOU SUMMARIZE WHAT HE FOUND AND SAID? He found that the animal was killed by an arrow, which did go through the heart and lungs. So, it was a very good shot, whoever shot the animal made a really good shot, so that deer was dead very quickly. WAS THE ARROW STILL THERE WHEN YOU DRAGGED THE DEER OUT OF THE TREE? No, it wasn't. In fact, I didn't even notice the wound. But I wasn't looking that closely because the case is so unusual, I wanted the experts up in pathology to look at it before I looked at it too hard. Sometimes in the field, if I think it's coyotes or something has killed an animal, I will do a little field investigation myself. But I figured this was one for the experts, so I didn't even check over the body that closely when I had it in my possession. IF YOUR STATE WILDLIFE PATHOLOGIST, WARD STONE, EXAMINED THIS MALE DEER AND CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS SHOT BY AN ARROW THROUGH THE HEART AND LUNGS, BUT THERE IS NO ARROW IN THE BODY, HOW IS HE CONFIDENT THAT THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED? Oh, it's real easy because the arrow leaves a hole and the blades, cutting blades on the hunting head, slice right through. He even said it was, 'a three-blade broad head arrow.' So, there is nothing else that is going to be confused with an arrow wound. BUT THAT LEADS TO THE QUESTION: WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ARROW THAT WAS THERE AND HOW DID THIS DEER END UP 12 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND IN A TREE WITH NO ARROW IN ITS BODY? It's very common for the arrow to pass straight through the body. In fact, I think that happens more often than not in archery kills. The arrow just goes right on through and out the other side. So, it's not even with the snow on the ground, if the arrow was there on the ground with the snow, we would not have seen it."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"So, there isn't any mystery about how the deer died. It died from an arrow wound. How it got up in the tree is another story and I think Ward Stone and myself believe that somebody put it, some human, put it up there. We're reasonably sure of that. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DEAD WHEN IT WENT INTO THE TREE? Oh, yeah, it died almost immediately after the arrow hit it. Very soon after. WHAT WOULD BE THE MOTIVE FOR ANYONE TO DO THAT? That's a good question. I have no idea. The only thing I can think of is a hoax, to play a trick. But the reason I didn't think it was a hoax to begin with because it was way out in the middle of nowhere. You'd think that if someone was going to play a trick, they would have done this near a road or hunting cabin or some place where they knew it was going to be seen. But this wasn't a place where I would think that you would know someone was going to come by. WOULDN'T THERE HAVE BEEN SOME KIND OF TRACKS IN THE SNOW IN AND AROUND THAT TREE? No, because we had several snow storms. The opening day of deer season is the opening day of gun season. So, it's preceded by about five weeks of archery hunting. We pretty much figure the deer was killed before the opening day of deer season. So, whatever evidence was there on the ground when the deer was killed was covered up by the snow which fell the night before Gerald Inman found the deer. WAS THERE ANY BLOOD LEAKAGE FROM THE WOUND WHATSOEVER ON THE BODY? The deer had been up there for three weeks by the time we arrived. There was a tiny bit of blood on the snow the day we went to get the animal, but I think that was because it was the first day above freezing in a long time and it is kind of like when you leave meat on the counter to thaw, some juices run out. I think that is what was happening there. There certainly was no noticeable blood from wounds on the side of the deer or anything. We didn't notice an arrow wound in the field. DID GERALD INMAN SEE ANY BLOOD ON THE DEER WHEN HE FIRST FOUND IT ON NOVEMBER 18? No, he didn't mention that he did. WHAT ABOUT THE DESCRIPTION THAT SOME KIND OF CLAW MARKS WERE FOUND ON THE TREE DID YOU SEE THOSE AND WHAT DO YOU THINK? Yes, I did. My guess is I'm not an expert on claw marks on trees. The only animal we have in New York of any size that routinely climbs trees is a black bear and I'm not qualified to say whether a cat or something else, whether a bear did. But my guess, my gut feeling is, that probably a bear climbed up the tree at least part way to investigate the deer in the tree. We have a lot of bear in that area and I think it would just be natural for a bear going through the woods to smell the deer up in the tree and to climb the tree to investigate. WHICH ADDS TO THE MYSTERY OF WHY WOULD A BEAR NOT PROCEED TO PULL THAT DEER OUT OF THE TREE? WHAT WAS IT ABOUT THE DEER THAT APPARENTLY REPULSED OR DEFLECTED THE BEAR? The tree is fairly small to begin with, small in diameter. I don't think there is any place that the bear could comfortably grab and stand and then be free enough to feed on the carcass, or pull it out. We couldn't get it out, four men couldn't get out. I imagine if the bear tried, it would have the same problem. And the bony"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"legs were the easiest to reach, so there isn't any good meat there. It probably would have been a lot of work for the bear to dine on it. We don't know exactly what happened there. In fact, a bear could have climbed that tree before the deer was even there and left the marks. We don't know what the chronological order of all this happening was. IN ADDITION TO THE HOLES FROM THE BOW AND ARROW IN THE HEART AND LUNGS, DID DR. STONE FIND ANY OTHER CUTS, SCRATCHES OR ANYTHING ELSE ON THE DEER? He did not say he did. I did find right near the tree trunk, some small animal had chewed on the deer a little bit in a couple of spots, a possum or a squirrel or raccoon, had chewed on the animal where they could reach just a little bit. Very small, very little damage to the carcass itself. SO, IT WAS A CLEAN KILL BY AN ARROW THAT WENT THROUGH THE DEER AND THEN SOME HOW THE DEAD, 70-POUND MALE DEER ENDED UP 12 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND IN A TREE. That's right. ANYTHING LIKE THIS EVER BEFORE IN ANY OF YOUR WILDLIFE RECORDS IN NEW YORK? Not that I'm aware of. I certainly haven't heard of anything. All the DEC official wildlife people knows about this incident and nobody has reported to me they have ever come across anything like this before.\" More Information: Even though the New York deer showed no signs of blood or excisions of hide or tissue, during my investigations of the worldwide animal mutilation phenomenon, I have heard from law enforcement and ranchers that occassionally deer or other wild game have been found dead, with no signs of blood, hanging from broken tree limbs as high as 14 feet off the ground. Related excerpt from my book, Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume II: High Strangeness, Chapter 2, \"Light Beams, Discs and Animal Deaths\" about the conscious memory of Steve Bismarck, resident of Snohomish, Washington, while working in the woods behind his father's house Easter weekend 1977: \"I heard a thud to my right and a Bigfoot walked through (the woods) going the same direction as those little guys (Filipino-looking non-humans). It was like he was following behind them.\" Steve said the Bigfoot or Sasquatch creature was about eight feet tall, had a cone-shaped head and solid black hair about four inches long all over its body."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\"This ape-like animal walked upright,\" Bismarck wrote about his drawing of a Bigfoot creature he saw in a forested swamp behind his Snohomish, Washington home Easter weekend, 1977. He estimated the creature stood at least eight feet tall, or taller, not counting its arm reach over its large head. Five months later in the early morning hours of August 8, 1977, Bismarck got home from a night out and went to get some corn and barley to feed young calves he was raising. \"I hear what sounds like a bunch of coyotes yelping out in the back. It sounded like a hundred of them. I thought maybe coyotes had a deer and were tearing it apart. Then it sounded like puppies getting crushed by something stomping on them! So then I think maybe they're tangling with a bear. And pretty soon, something starts screaming. And it's a scary, high-pitched scream. Then all the coyote noises stop. And this thing is still screaming and I slam the door shut. I run and get my 30-30. And I'm thinking that thing could be up to my house in just seconds.\" \"Then my sister next door calls up and said, 'Did you hear that noise? I thought it was going to knock the house down!'\" \"I told her, 'I think it was the Bigfoot howling.' And I called (Deputy Sheriff) Jerry Phillips and told him what was happening. He said that someone else had called him to report they had seen a large, orange glowing object drop down in the woods over my way. Phillips came out again and investigated. He didn't find any dead coyotes or other animals back there, but he found some tracks in the woods. He took plaster casts of them.\" I talked with Jerry Phillips in March 1996 about Steve Bismarck's account and he remembered all of the story and more. He sent me a hundred pages of file reports and photographs, including a polaroid photo of a possible Bigfoot track cast in plaster on Steve Bismarck's farm. Phillips told me there were also dozens of unusual animal deaths in the Snohomish area similar to the several thousand animal mutilation cases reported worldwide since the 1960s. Phillips said there were several dozen unusual animal deaths near Steve Bismarck's home in 1977 and one of the strangest was a deer found hanging from a tree limb (about 14 feet above the ground) with odd, bloodless excisions of tissue from various parts of its body.\" See Earthfiles Shop for more information about Glimpses of Other Realities, 2 Volumes."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
