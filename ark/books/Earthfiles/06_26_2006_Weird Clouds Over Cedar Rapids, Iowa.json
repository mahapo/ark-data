KCRG-TV'9s meteorologist Joe Winters said, \"We'll just call them wave clouds. That's not actually a type of cloud. It's just the way they looked. The atmosphere always has waves in it, like the ocean. We just don't see waves often enough, and today we had the opportunity to do that. And it probably won't happen again for a long time.\" Website:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"KCRG-TV: http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/3200226.html Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
