March 20, 2009 Corpus Cristi, Texas and Weston, Colorado: Corpus Cristi, Texas: Half Cat Mutilation On March 18, 2009, Corpus Cristi police investigated a cat found cut in half near the city’s Club Estates Elementary School on the south side of Corpus Christi. The cat was cut cleanly through its middle with a smooth incision. Its organs had been removed and were not at the scene. 31 cat mutilations have been reported to Corpus Christi police since April 2008. Twelve of those 31 cats have been found in the same general area on the south side of the city. Police have no suspects and have not made any arrests. Anyone with information, please call Corpus Christi CrimeStoppers at: 361-888-8477. Over the years, recurring cycles of cat mutilations have been reported in England, Canada and many states in America. Texas has had repeated cat mutilations in Corpus Cristi, San Antonio, Austin, and Plano, Texas, an affluent suburb north of Dallas. In 1991, 1993 and the late 1990s, Texas police received dozens of reports about cats found cut in half, usually with the front half near the owners' yards or sidewalks. Plano Police Detective Mike Box also had missing reports on more than 80 domestic house cats that wore collars and I. D. tags, but were never found. Detective Box investigated satanic cult activities, but could not find any evidence that connected them to the mutilated and missing cats and other animals such as dogs.

Weston, Colorado: 28-Year-Old Cow Mutilation "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Only four days before the half cat was found in Texas, on Sunday, March 15, 2009, I was in Weston, Colorado, about a half-hour west of Trinidad, to meet rancher Mike Duran. He found one of his cows dead and mutilated the week before on Sunday, March 8. He did not see the mother with her calf during feeding on Saturday and guesses she died Friday night, March 6. Mike is 49-years-old, born and raised in the Weston region of southern Colorado, where you can see the white-capped Sangre de Cristo mountains from his pasture. M ike Duran, 49, with some of his 40 head of beef cattle in the Weston, Colorado, pasture backed by the snow white mountains of the Sangre de Criste range. On the other side of the mountains are the Great Sand Dunes, San Luis Valley and Alamosa. At the far end of the pasture toward the mountains, Duran's first cow mutilation was in November 1995.

Beyond those mountains are the Great Sand Dunes and the town of Alamosa in the San Luis Valley where in September 1967, ranchers Berle and Nellie Lewis made international news when their 3-year-old Appaloosa horse named Lady was found dead and stripped of flesh from the neck up. All her chest organs had also been bloodlessly and surgically removed. 3 - year-old Appaloosa horse named Lady photographed about three weeks after she was discovered on September 9, 1967, stripped of flesh from the neck up and all her chest organs bloodlessly and surgically removed. Photograph © 1967 by Don Anderson. The exposed skeleton was so white and clean, it looked like the bones had laid in the sun for days. But the ranchers knew she was well and alive only two nights before. Now she lay in dry, dusty soil with no tracks around her, not even her own. Lady’s tracks stopped 100 feet southeast of her dead and mutilated body. Berle Lewis told me in a phone interview back in the 1980s, “It looked like she jumped around in a circle. But there was nothing else, no tracks of any kind between there and where we found her. It was clean all"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"around her.” However, 40 feet south of her body was a broken bush. Berle told me, “Around the bush was a 3-foot-circle of six or eight holes in the ground about four inches across and three to four inches deep.” Berle, Nellie and other ranchers in the San Luis Valley said that summer of 1967, very strange aerial objects were seen over the valley and the ranchers wondered if the UFOs had something to do with the bizarre death of Lady. That’s why the Pueblo, Colorado, Chieftain newspaper headlined: “Dead Horse Riddle Sparks UFO Buffs.” Unexplained lights, beams, discs, aerial triangles and other odd aerial phenomena have been linked with the worldwide animal mutilations since at least the 1950s. Pathologist and hematologist John Altshuler, M. D., from Denver, now deceased, was so curious about the unusual horse death in the San Luis Valley that he privately drove down to Alamosa to see the horse. In my first book, An Alien Harvest [ see Earthfiles Shop ], I reprinted a September 1967 eyewitness report written by Dr. Altshuler about what he found. He wrote: “When I got close to the horse, I could see that it was also cut from the neck down to the base of the chest in a vertical, clean incision. At the edge of the cut, there was a darkened color as if the flesh had been opened and cauterized with a surgical cauterizing blade. ... I cut tissue samples from the hard, darker edge. Later, I viewed the tissue under a microscope. At the cell level, there was discoloration and destruction consistent with changes caused by burning. “Most amazing was the lack of blood. I have done hundreds of autopsies. You can’t cut into a body without getting some blood. But there was no blood on the skin or on the ground. No blood anywhere. That impressed me the most. “Then inside the horse’s chest, I remember the lack of organs. Whoever did the cutting took the horse’s heart, lungs and thyroid. The mediastinum was completely empty – and dry. How do you get the heart out without blood? It was an incredible dissection of organs without any evidence of blood.” [ Editor’s Note: Wikipedia – “The mediastinum is a non-delineated group of structures in the chest, surrounded by loose connective tissue. It is the central compartment of the thoracic cavity. It contains the heart,the great vessels of the heart, esophagus, trachea, phrenic nerve, cardiac nerve, thoracic duct, thymus, and lymph nodes of the central chest.” ] During the late 1980s and through most of the 1990s, Dr. Altshuler confirmed cooked hemoglobin and cooked collagen in the excisions of many different animal mutilations ranging from half-cats and rabbits to horses and cattle."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" L eft: Normal cow collagen, the fibrous constituent of connective tissue.

Dr. Altshuler had me look in his laboratory microscope at mutilation tissue compared to tissue samples from known laser surgery. Earth life is carbon based, but there was no carbon residue on the animal mutilation tissues. In contrast, there were always small black grains of carbon on the laser surgery tissues.

Further to the east is Alamosa and the Great Sand Dunes National Park also long associated with animal mutilation and UFO reports."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"How ironic that my first October 1979 film location with the KMGH-TV crew then was in the Walsenburg and Trinidad region, and now 30 years later, I am back on the same ground investigating more mutilated animals. So far there has been one 28-year-old cow who had given birth to a calf three months before her bloodless death in Weston, and a 1-week-old male calf found Tuesday morning, March 17, in Hoehne about 40 miles east of Mike Duran’s dead and mutilated cow. First, the Duran ranch in Weston. The March 8, 2009, mutilated cow is the second unusual animal death there. The first mutilation was November 1995, in the same valley pasture where Mike Duran has run a herd varying between 40 and 75 cattle over the past fifteen years. Mike also has his Master’s Degree in Special Education from Adam State College and now works at Trinidad High School about a half-hour east of his Weston ranch. That first mutilation was a 5-year-old healthy, white-faced Hereford with horns. Those horns had a strange fate in that 1995 mutilation. Interview: Mike Duran, Weston, Colorado, Rancher and Special Education Teacher, Trinidad High School, Trinidad, Colorado: “What’s funny is that both cows were wet cows. The first mutilated cow was about five years old with a 3-month-old calf. IF I UNDERSTAND YOU ABOUT THAT FIRST 1995 CATTLE MUTILATION ON YOUR RANCH, YOU WERE DEALING WITH A NEW MOTHER AND THAT UDDER WOULD BE ENGORGED WITH BLOOD AND MILK. YET, SOMEHOW IT WAS REMOVED FROM THE BELLY WITHOUT THERE BEING FLUID OR BLOOD ON THE GROUND OR ON HER BODY? Yes, there was no fluid or blood on her body or the ground. And she was turned on her back with her legs sticking up in the air when we found her. And she was alive the evening before. I found her on a Sunday and the Saturday evening before I had to take a bull out of that field and I had taken my portable corrals. I brought the bull home and then I went back and loaded my corral panels on my trailer that Saturday evening. Then Sunday around 11:30 AM, I was helping a neighbor move some cattle to another pasture past my field when I saw – first of all, I looked down there and it looked weird. It didn’t even look like a cow. It looked more like a deer dead in the field. So, on the way down, I noticed the cow and when I looked at her and found it quite odd that her udder was missing and she was turned on her back with her legs in the air. That’s not a normal cow death. Usually if a cow dies, they are on their side bloated up and predators – especially magpies and crows – start to poke at the eyes and the soft tissue. But on her, there was nothing. Then I noticed how the sheath of her horns were pulled off also. The bone was still there. The shell was pulled off the horn, just the shell. If you know the skull of a cow, when they grow horns, they are also part of the bone. If you cut horns off, they are going to bleed. But they were not cut off, just the shells from the horns were pulled out. THE BONY PART WAS LEFT STICKING UP? Ye s . YOU FOUND THE HORN SHELLS NEXT TO THE MUTILATED COW? Yes, they were about ten to twenty yards from the cow. HAD ANYBODY CUT ANY PART OF THE SHELLS? OR WERE THEY COMPLETE? They would have fit completely. It was like someone very strong just pulled them out. YOU HAD SEEN HER HOW MANY HOURS BEFORE THEN? It was probably 16 or 17 hours before that. DID YOU LOOK CLOSELY ON THE GROUND FOR TRACKS OR SIGNS OF STRUGGLE? We looked all over. My dad spent a lot of time looking for tracks and he could not find anything. DID YOU ASK A VET TO DO A NECROPSY?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"No, we didn’t. I called our local game warden and asked if a predator got her. He said he would see. We skinned the cow together and did not find anything. My one question to him was, ‘What if someone had used a tranquilizer gun and shot her with it?’ He said, ‘If they had done that, we’ll know when we skin her because when you use a tranquilizer gun, it leaves a very big bruise. We’ll find it if that was the case. We skinned the whole cow and could find no evidence of anything. SO, NO BRUISES AND NO EVIDENCE OF PUNCTURE MARKS AND NO TEETH MARKS FROM A NATURAL PREDATOR? No, nothing. SO THAT FIRST ANIMAL - FROM YOUR AND THE GAME WARDEN’S POINT OF VIEW - WAS A MYSTERIOUS DEATH? Ye s . 2nd Mutilation 28-Year-Old Cow Found March 8, 2009 - Mike Duran Ranch, Weston, Colorado Then the second animal mutilation I found was on Sunday, March 8, 2009. I believe she was mutilated some time Friday night, March 6, because on Saturday, March 7, when I fed my cows, I had just come from Santa Fe and went to feed them at 3:30 PM in the afternoon. It was very windy that day. I fed the cows by a barn. This cow was my oldest and because she had a 3-month-old calf and was up in age around 28-years-old, I would feed her special. I would give her a bucket of grain every time I fed her and we would drive away from the rest of the herd. She would follow and eat the grain and then go back and eat some of the hay. But on Saturday, March 7, I didn’t see her. It was so windy and I was tired from the trip, so I just fed the cows and left. Then on Sunday morning, March 8, about 10 AM in the morning when I fed the herd, I noticed she was not there. With her being up in age and having that 3-month-old calf, the first thing that came to my mind was that she had died. I went looking for her. The cows usually bed down in the pinion trees on the side of the hill where I searched, but I could not find her. Then when I looked over the edge of the hill there, I noticed down in the creek valley she was laying down next to the water. When I looked at her belly, it seemed kind of weird and when I picked up her back leg, I noticed that her udder was removed in a circle and the hide looked like it was cauterized or something - no real bleeding. Then I looked at the exterior of her vaginal opening and the skin around it was also taken out. I said to myself, ‘Well, this is a mutilation! She did not die from natural causes or old age.’ N arrow path through willows from cow pasture to foreground creek bank where Mike Duran's herd of 40 beef cattle usually drink.

THIS SOUNDS LIKE THE MARCH 8, 2009, CATTLE MUTILATION HAS THE SAME EXCISIONS AS YOUR YOUNGER COW BACK IN NOVEMBER 1995? Yes, the only difference is that this older cow was a baldy – she did not have any horns. WHERE WAS HER CALF? With the rest of the herd. DOWN BY THE CREEK, THAT WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO LOOK FOR TRACKS. DID YOU FIND ANYTHING UNUSUAL? There were no tracks and even by her belly, there was mud that would have showed tracks. There was nothing, not even a bird in sight. And usually when there is a dead animal, birds are there – especially magpies and crows. I think her front left leg was broken and maybe one of her back legs was cocked funny and that made me wonder if she fell from the air to the ground? I'VE INVESTIGATED A LOT OF MUTILATIONS WHERE BRUISES AND BROKEN BONES INDICATED THE ANIMAL WAS DROPPED TO THE GROUND. IN ONE MONTANA CASE, THERE WAS A CRATERED AREA IN THE PASTURE SOIL ABOUT FOUR FEET FROM THE MUTILATED COW. SOIL ANALYSIS CONFIRMED THE SOIL HAD BEEN COMPRESSED BY HEAVY PRESSURE, REINFORCING THE SHERIFF'S HYPOTHESIS THAT THE MUTILATED COW HAD BEEN DROPPED FROM ENOUGH HEIGHT TO BOUNCE. No Predators, Not Even Birds, From March 8 to March 15, 2009 R ancher Mike Duran thought his 28-year-old cow might have been killed and mutilated on Friday night, March 6, 2009, because he did not see her with her calf at feeding time on Saturday, March 7.

LET’S GO TO THAT QUESTION I’VE BEEN TRYING TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF FOR SO LONG: WHO OR WHAT IS KILLING AND MUTILATING THESE ANIMALS AROUND THE WORLD AND WHY? WHAT DO YOU PERSRONALLY THINK AND TALK ABOUT WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES? Some of my colleagues laugh at me, but I tell them I think there are people out in outer space, aliens or whatever, there is another life. Why they do this, I do not know. I believe that there is another life out there in the universe and I think they are so advanced that we cannot even pick them up on radar or anything. THIS IS A PHENOMENON THAT HAS BEEN GOING ON THIS PLANET FOR AT LEAST 50 OR 60 YEARS OR LONGER. AND THERE HAVE BEEN PEOPLE IN MILITARY SUCH AS LT. COL. PHILIP J. CORSO WHO WORKED IN THE PENTAGON DURING THE EISENHOWER ADMINISTRATION. HE WROTE IN A BOOK BEFORE HE DIED THAT THE PERPETRATORS OF THE GLOBAL ANIMAL MUTILATIONS ARE ‘EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES (EBEs). I think so. I would believe that. BEFORE WE TALKED, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAD COME TO THAT CONCLUSION IN YOUR MIND. WHAT HAS PERSUADED YOU THAT WHAT IS DOING THE ANIMAL MUTILATIONS IS SOMETHING FROM OUTER SPACE? Just because no normal human being could do – especially where this recent cow is – she’s on the side of a little cliff next to the creek. No one could have just moved the cow there. I saw one other mutilation two or three years after my first 1995 mutilation where one of my neighbors down the road was taking care of some cows for another neighbor who was in California. And he come up and said, ‘Hey, I’ve got this cow and she’s kind of weird. You’ve had one mutilated so why don’t you come with me and take a look?’ When we got there, it was the same as my first mutilation. She was on her back and with her udder taken out and the exterior of the vaginal opening was also taken out. But what was weird about this cow, we saw also that the jawbone flesh was taken, as you have mentioned happens in so many mutilations you've investigated."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"P olaroid photograph taken in 1976 at the Budin Ranch in Sterling, Colorado, by former Logan County Sheriff Tex Graves at one of more than a hundred animal mutilations he investigated in the 1970s. Many animals were so freshly dead that the bodies were warm to touch at the scene. The jaw bone cleaned of flesh, tongue removed, “cookie cutter” circular removal of flesh around the eye and removal of eyeball was a common pattern of bloodless tissue removal from mutilated animals in the 1970s to 1990s. It was really odd at my neighbor’s mutilation that we found in a circular pattern a lot of the oak brush was smashed down. It looked like something landed right on it. SOMETHING ROUND? Something round, yes, landed on that and smashed that old brush down and did their thing and then left. HOW FAR FROM THE BRUSH THAT WAS PUSHED DOWN IN A CIRCULAR PATTERN WAS THE MUTILATED COW? Anywhere between 10 and 20 yards. VE RY CLOSE. Yes, very close. AND ON THE GROUND BETWEEN THAT CIRCLE IN THE BRUSH AND THE MUTILATED ANIMAL, DID YOU ALL FIND ANY TRACKS? We didn’t see anything. 1995: Mysterious Triangle-Shaped Aircraft Reported AROUND THE TIME OF YOUR FIRST MUTILATION BACK IN 1995, DID YOU OR ANYONE ELSE SEE ANYTING STRANGE AND UNIDENTIFIED IN THE SKY - OR EVEN AFTER THIS MOST RECENT ONE IN MARCH 2009? Back in 1995 after that first mutilation, it happened on a Saturday night. Some friends told me that some of the guards or night watchmen at the local mine about 1.5 miles from my pasture saw around midnight an object that was in a triangle shape with a light at each of the three corners of the triangle that went over the mine. The aerial triangle was going to the south and they thought it was kind of odd. THAT WAS THE NIGHT YOU ARE PRETTY SURE THAT YOUR FIRST MUTILATION HAD TO HAVE DIED BECAUSE YOU HAD SEEN HER ALIVE THAT AFTERNOON AND FOUND HER DEAD THE NEXT MORNING, RIGHT? Correct. 2009: “Shiny, Round Shape” Moving in Sky Near Cokedale WHAT ABOUT YOUR MARCH 8TH MUTILATION? No, I asked the neighbors that live close by if they had heard any noise or seen anything and the lady who lives close by, she said she did not see anything. But about three weeks"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"ago, I was driving home from work (at high school) around 4:15 PM in the afternoon. I was near Cokedale and saw a very shiny, round shape - just completely round and was very, very shiny in the sky and it was moving and I kept watching it and I said to myself: ‘This is not an airplane.’ I kept watching it and suddenly it disappeared. And that’s the second time in that same area. I was in the little town of Cokedale west of Trinidad on my way home from work and I saw that same thing up in the sky about a year and a half ago and it disappeared also. But that one was about 2 PM in the afternoon. SO YOUR SIGHTING SOME THREE WEEKS BEFORE YOUR SECOND MUTILATION (2ND WEEK OF FEBRUARY 2009) - IT’S ROUND, SILVER AND IF YOU EXTEND YOUR HAND RIGHT NOW AND LOOK AT YOUR FINGERS, WHAT WOULD IT HAVE TAKEN FROM YOUR HAND TO COVER THAT OBJECT? Probably my hand. YOUR ENTIRE HAND? Ye s . SO, YOU’RE TALKING ABOUT LOOKING AT A ROUND, SILVER OBJECT IN THE SKY THAT WAS BIG - AND THAT WAS ONLY THREE WEEKS AGO? Ye s . WHEN YOU SAY IT DISAPPEARED, WHAT HAPPENED? It just vanished. IT’S THERE, BIG IN THE SKY AND...? It was moving and I said to myself, ‘Is that an airplane? No, it cannot be an airplane.’ You can tell an airplane. AIRPLANES ARE NOT ROUND. No, and this was just round and shiny silver, or whitish-silver, and it was there moving. I kept looking and it just disappeared. DID IT VANISH, POP OUT, AS YOU WERE STARING AT IT? As I was staring at it, I couldn’t see it anymore. I didn’t see it zoom out or anything. It was there one second and the next second it was gone.” O n March 15, I collected grass, willow and soil samples from the Duran mutilation site, which were Fed Exed to biophysicist W. C. Levengood in Michigan to see if he can find evidence of energy interactions with plants that grew near the cow’s body in contrast to samples collected far away. Based on my experiences investigating other animal mutilations, the right left leg of the Duran cow did appear to be broken. My guess is that the cow was dropped from above down to the creek bank on the opposite side of the water from the cow pasture. Mike Duran said it was unusual to find any of his cows on the far side of the creek. Being dropped from above on to the ground was first reported by sheriffs who worked with veterinarians or medical people on necropsies of the strangely dead animals. When multiple broken bones were found, the conclusion was: the animal had to have been dropped from a considerable height to where it was found dead and mutilated. One of the definitive cases on this was one I investigated in Montana a couple of years ago. The sheriff called me to say they had a bounce mark about three feet from where a large cow was found dead and mutilated. Biophysicist W. C. Levengood was able to work with soil and pasture grass I collected at the site and compare to laboratory impact stress on soils. He confirmed the soil in the crater next to the mutilated cow had been impacted by a weight from above equivalent to the weight of the full grown cow.
