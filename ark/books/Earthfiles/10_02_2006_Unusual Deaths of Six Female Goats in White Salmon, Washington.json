He did four necropsies, but they do not know what killed the goats.\" - Gini Nichols, Owner W hite Salmon, Washington, is an hour east of Portland on the Columbia River. October 2 , 2006 White Salmon, Washington - Gini Nichols was born in White Salmon, Washington, fifty years ago. At age thirty, she bought a farm a few miles from town. Then she married Andy Nichols eleven years ago. Instead of moving into town, the couple decided to stay on Gini's farm. The land had become overgrown with weeds, so they purchased goats to keep the wild plants controlled. This year, their small herd of eight goats contained one 6-year-old buck male. He was corraled separately from the seven females, who ranged in age from 6-years-old to 5-months-old. On Tuesday evening, September 26, the Nichols had some neighbors over for dinner who have helped care for the goats when the Nichols were away on vacation or other weekend travel. All eight goats were healthy and happy to see the neighbors and at 8:30 p.m., the visitors \"talked goodbyes\" to the goats. Thirty minutes later, at 9 p.m., the Nichols say their two dogs in the house \"went crazy\" barking, but the couple thought it was raccoons outside which had been hanging around. As in so many animal mutilation cases I've investigated over the past twenty-seven years, farmers and ranchers are used to dogs barking for common reasons. So no one went outside to look. Later, the Nichols learned that at the same 9 p.m. time, another neighbor's dog also \"went crazy\" barking. That dog was let out \"to chase raccoons,\" but the people in the house did not go outside to look, either, assuming raccoons were the problem. A third neighbor later reported that around 9 p.m., there was a big ruckus outside that sounded like \"raccoons fighting.\" But again, that neighbor did not go outside to check either. Strangely, no one - neither the Nichols nor their neighbors - heard any goats bleating for their lives. Nine and a half hours later at 6:30 a.m., Gini Nichols got in her car to go to work in White Salmon. But what she discovered only a few feet from the driveway, stopped her cold. Interview: Gini Nichols, Independent goat farmer with husband for eleven years, White Salmon, Wa shi ng t o n: \"On Wednesday morning, September 27, 2006, when I got up to go to work, I was driving out – our driveway goes right past the pasture and I saw one of the goats lying down next to the fence only a few feet away. I thought, ‘That looks really strange.’ I stopped the car and honked the horn and yelled for my husband. I said, ‘We have a sick goat.” Then I looked more and saw the other five bodies lying all across our one-acre field. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"S ix female goats found dead at 6:30 a.m., on Wednesday, September 27, 2006, in fenced pasture of White Salmon, Washington, farm owned the past eleven years by Gini and Andy Nichols. The udders on three of the goats had been cleanly and bloodlessly excised. All photographs by Klickitat County Sheriff's Department. My husband said, ‘I don’t know what happened.’ We were both, ‘What could have happened?!’ I drove on to work and got about a quarter of a mile and said, ‘I’ve got to go back. There’s something wrong. We need an autopsy.’ So I went back to the house and we walked out into the field. One goat was turned lliterally up on her back with her legs up in the air leaning against the fence. That was when we saw her udder was missing. T he two Klickitat County Sheriff's deputies who investigated placed a number that represented the body count before photographing on Wednesday, September 27, 2006. We both thought that coyotes had come in and ripped her udder off. Then we checked the other goats and two were missing udders and three of them weren’t. But there were no gunshot wounds, no knife cuts, no nothing. There was no blood at all."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"F irst female goat had no external excisions, but all six females had severely blackened lungs which baffled the veterinarian who performed necropsies in the field. T he second female goat had a neatly \"scalloped\" excision of its udder, a scallop pattern often found in udder excisions from mutilated cows. T he third female goat had its legs up against the fence and head twisted up and to its right side. Its udder had been excised. T he fourth female goat was dead without any external excisions. Below her open eye and protruding tongue."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"T he fifth female goat, black and white behind the fourth goat, had its udder excised at the red site in this photograph. T he sixth female goat was dead without any external excisions. \"We didn’t know what’s going on. The more we thought about it, we decided to call the Klickitat County Sheriff's office. Two deputies came about 7:30 a.m. (an hour later). One happened to be a retired Fish and Game man, who has seen animal mutilations. That deputy took one look at the goats and he said, ‘This was not done by an animal. This was done by a knife.’ So, he said, ‘You guys get out of the field. I’m calling in more detectives and this is now an official investigation.’ The Sheriff's Deputies looked over the six dead goats and called in a veterinarian. Four Veterinarian Necropsies, But No Cause of Death He did four necropsies, but they do not know what killed the goats. They have absolutely no idea what killed them. And all their lungs were black and collapsed. The vet said it was like they had been sick for like a week or two weeks for their lungs to be like that. It should not have been like that. He said, ‘I don’t know what caused this.’"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"They took tissue samples of the lungs, heart, liver and kidneys and sent them to the University of Washington. So, we’re waiting to find out what killed them. DID THE VETERINARIAN SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPOSURE TO HIGH HEAT? He did not, not to us anyway. They wouldn’t let us out into the field when he was doing the actual autopsies. So, I don’t know what he said to the deputies. DID THE VET SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE EXCISIONS THEMSELVES? He said whoever did this knew what they were doing. The cuts were very precise. They were not nicked. They went in just deep enough to basically skin the udders off. THE UDDERS WERE THE ONLY ORGANS REMOVED FROM THESE GOATS? The only thing wrong with three of them. THE OTHER THREE WERE DEAD, BUT WITH NO OTHER SIGNS OF EXCISIONS? Ye s . DID THE VETERINARIAN EXAMINE ALL THE GOATS? He did the necropsies here in the field and he did full necropsies on four of the goats and on the other two, he just cut them open and discovered that their lungs were black, too, but he did not do full necropsies on them. ALL SIX GOATS WERE AFFECTED WITH THE BLACK LUNG? Ye s . DO YOU REMEMBER THE VET SAYING ANYTHING SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT HE WAS SEEING IN THE BODIES? They would not allow us in the field. We were sitting on the porch watching. AND THE EARS, THE EYES, THE TONGUE, THE JAW FLESH...? Everything was there. EVEN THE RECTUMS HAD NOT BEEN TOUCHED? Nothing. HAVE YOU TALKED WITH ANYONE ELSE IN YOUR AREA WHO HAS HAD ANY KIND OF ANIMAL MUTILATIONS? Nobody has said anything, except that maybe there were some cases in Centerville back in 1984 to 1985, which is about 25 miles from White Salmon. Dogs \"Went Crazy\" At 9 p.m. Night Before DID ANYONE REPORT ANY UNUSUAL SOUNDS OR LIGHTS? No lights. Our dogs went crazy at about 9 p.m. (on Tuesday night, September 26). We’ve been having a rash of skunks, so we wouldn’t let the dogs out of the house. Then our neighbors told us afterward that their dog went crazy about 9 p.m. Then another neighbor said they heard what sounded like raccoons fighting at 9 p.m. DID ANYBODY GET UP TO CHECK OUTSIDE? No, nobody did. HOW FAR FROM WHERE YOU WERE INSIDE YOUR HOUSE TUESDAY NIGHT TO WHERE THE GOATS WERE LYING IN THE PASTURE? From our bedroom to the pasture is maybe 80 feet. SO, IT’S VERY CLOSE. Very, very close."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"AND OUTSIDE OF YOUR DOGS BARKING INSIDE THE HOUSE, YOU DIDN’T HEAR ANYTHING? Nothing. AND YOUR NEIGHBORS ARE HOW CLOSE? The neighbors who had their dog upset, they are probably 1,000 to 1,500 feet away. SO YOU WERE THE CLOSEST AND DIDN’T HEAR ANYTHING AND THEY WERE A THOUSAND FEET AWAY AND HAD A DOG GO CRAZY, TOO, BUT IN BOTH INSTANCES, NOBODY WENT OUTSIDE TO SEE WHAT WAS GOING ON? They released their dog because he has been chasing raccoons. But he can’t get to our place because of fences. DID YOU LOOK FOR TRACKS IN YOUR PASTURE? We looked and looked, but our pasture is grass and alfalfa and so there were not any tracks. HOW FAR WERE THE ANIMALS FROM THE ROAD? From the main road, they are about a thousand feet. But from my driveway, they were only five feet away. ONLY FIVE FEET FROM YOUR OWN DRIVEWAY? Ye s . SO, WHATEVER HAPPENED THE NIGHT OF TUESDAY TO WEDNESDAY MORNING (SEPTEMBER 26 TO 27) HAPPENED RIGHT OUTSIDE OF YOUR HOUSE? Ye s . ISN’T THAT EXTRAORDINARY THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN OR HEARD ANYTHING? Yes. It’s extremely scary, is what it is! My goats would not let anybody get close to them. They aren’t going to come up to the fence. So, somebody – I don’t know – they had to plan it ahead of time. And you cannot see my goats from the main road. My house is the last house on our road. HOW COULD ANYBODY HAVE BEEN RIGHT OUTSIDE YOUR HOUSE TO ACCOMPLISH THIS WITH SIX GOATS WITHOUT THE GOATS BLEATING, SCREAMING? I don’t know. It has my husband and me really up in arms. To say the least, we are very nervous. Our animals don’t go out at all now. My two dogs stay in at night. One Female Goat Left Alive It's also strange that of the seven females in the pasture, one is still alive. She is a baby, my baby, 5-years-old. I hand-fed her, raised her. (The ages of the six dead female goats: one was 6; two were 4; one was 3; and two were 5 months.) HOW DO YOU THINK SHE SURVIVED? We don’t know. Our thought was that she was in heat and might not have been with the other goats. She might have been over trying to get close to the buck. But we don’t know. BUT THAT FEMALE WAS OUT THERE SOMEWHERE IN THAT PASTURE? Yes, she was. When we found the other goats, she was running around the pasture scared to death, absolutely scared to death. And she is still so nervous we cannot touch her.\" Gini Nichols has organized a reward fund for information that can lead to the arrest and arraignment of those responsible for killing and mutilating the Nichols' goats. So far she has $400.
