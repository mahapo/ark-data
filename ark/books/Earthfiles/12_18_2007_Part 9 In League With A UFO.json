Out of print. Return to Part 1 December 18, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - Procurement of Civilians for Experimentation There is no problem obtaining injured or sick people for experimentation by the committee. Thousands who have no immediate family or friends fill the rooms of nursing homes and state hospitals. This was the pool of choice for the committee. The nursing homes were chosen over the hospitals because, as one committee member said, “They are like warehouses of the damned. The lucky ones are barely conscious of their surroundings. Many are only alive because of all the drugs that are pumped into them daily.” Whatever the committee did with these people was more humane than the life they were living while at the nursing home. Taking them out of the nursing home was in a sense “like rescuing them.” Even when they were in failing health and barely conscious, they always perked up when one of the technicians working for the committee came there to pick them up. They were a pitiful sight. No one on the committee had any intention of adding to their misery, so only those who were not conscious of their "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"surroundings and dying were used to experiment on. When someone was miraculously healed from their ailments, they were taken back to the nursing home. This happened several times. That was a dilemma for the committee. None of the rejuvenated elderly wanted to return to the nursing home. The committee was not set up to re-establish the lives of the cured individuals and had little choice. The committee had never expected to have so many rejuvenated people. Returning people who were froth with problems of the aging when they were taken away and then returned healthier than most of the attendants who worked there eventually caught the attention of the media. That one episode nearly uncovered what the committee had been doing. After that incident, the committee moved quickly and severed all links that could lead the events to them. They then implemented a new policy which relocated those who were cured and gave them new identities. The elderly themselves never suspected a thing. They just assumed that when they became ill that paramedics came and took them to a local hospital. The elderly patients had no reason to think otherwise. The media soon lost interest when they could not find anyone who could give them proof of what happened. A few healthy old people with no story to tell was not enough to keep the media interested. The Myth of Human Autonomy Understanding the Aliens was a slow and difficult process, but their big problem was not the Aliens, but the arrogance that had developed over the years among committee members because of their untouchable status. The scientists were not invincible, although that had become the mood. What happened at the nursing home could never have been tied to them. The committee was under too many layers of bureaucracy. What concerned their superiors was the possibility of the media giants taking a serious interest in what took place at the nursing home and snowballing into a full-blown inquiry, possibly forcing a Senate investigation. With the equipment the committee had in its possession, they had the means to become more secretive than they already were. Technically, the scientists were already invisible. Only a handful of people in the world know of their existence. But with the use of the Alien equipment, the committee would become “literally” invisible. For a time, the group was fearful of using this ability outside their protected base of operations. The scientists were afraid that if they bungled a mission and exposed their operation, they - and ultimately the whole organization - could be destroyed. The committee scientists are shadowed by what is appropriately called “the clean-up crew.” The job of that team is to dispose of them along with their equipment should a mission be compromised. Killing one or all of the committee on the spot was not a last resort, but a certainty if the scientists were unable to be removed from the scene expediently. The part about “expediently” bothered the committee members the most. The men knew they were expendable, but they had no intention of getting themselves into a situation that jeopardized their lives. The other reason the scientists delayed taking the Alien equipment off the base and into the homes of unsuspecting civilians was due to their belief in the sanctity of one's home. The ability to enter a person's home and go into their bedroom without their knowledge took getting used to. What made the whole thing palatable was that they were aware that they, as well as thousands of other humans, are visited in this manner every day. Some call it “ violated.” A few people in the general population know they are being abducted, but the vast majority of humanity has no clue that it is happening to them. The committee felt that they had no other choice but to enter that realm: a place where up until then was inhabited by the Aliens alone. We humans place the highest value on privacy. We naively think that our innermost thoughts belong only to us. We are living a fantasy. Privacy of body and mind is a human delusion. The committee members know that and have come to the conclusion that one cannot break a trust of a fellow human being when truth and trust are also illusions."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The committee decided that nursing homes were still the safest place to test and experiment with the Alien equipment. This time, the scientists would attempt to abduct a person using the Alien equipment instead of having the human brought to them by conventional means as had happened in the past. The scientists gained entry by using the Alien device that allowed them to permeate solid objects and to walk through walls. The committee members used an unmarked passenger van to carry them and the equipment they needed, which fit nearly into a briefcase. The nursing home they picked was located in a rural area. The committee did not have operatives at the nursing home. This was a test to see how the Alien technology would perform in an uncontrolled environment. The scientists had simple instructions: abduct a patient and take her back to the base. Then two hours later return her to the exact spot where the scientists picked her up. Arriving at the site a few minutes after dark, one of the committee members - who drove in a separate unmarked car - entered the building first. He entered through the front entrance, posed as a state health inspector, and told the attending nurse at the front desk that he was there to perform a “surprise” inspection. He was equipped with all the necessary credentials and if anyone called the health departments for verification, the phone call would have been intercepted by committee members who monitor the calls coming and going from that building. While he kept the staff distracted, three of the committee members, who were still in the van, looked for a dark area close to the building where there were no street lights. The scientists activated the Alien equipment and instantly permeated through the brick wall. The men emerged in a room that was occupied by an elderly woman. She was sitting alone in a wheel chair in one corner of the two-bedroom unit. There was no one else in the room with her. She appeared to be asleep. The television was on, but the sound was turned down. When the scientists passed through the wall, they did not feel a thing. The composition of the wall became as a whiff of smoke. But the energy field that emanated from the box caused the television and the lights in that room and those adjacent to it to flicker. The men had rehearsed entering a similar building back at the base before attempting this exercise. But the committee did not anticipate having all the attendants converge on them all at once. There were six attendants on duty that night. When the lights started flickering in that wing of the building, all six of the attendants went running to that location. The committee member whose job it was to distract the attendants - instead had them so nervous from the surprise inspection that they over-reacted. As the attendants converged on the room where the committee members had just entered, the committee had no choice but to subdue and paralyze the attendants one-by-one as they entered the room. The scientists had never paralyzed healthy people before and never out of a lab setting. Now, they had six people standing limp inside that room, all looking like mannequins. Because they had not planned to interfere with any of the staff or of the operation of the nursing home, the committee aborted the mission. It was only to be a training mission, a way to judge the difficulty that might be encountered when entering a private building with the intention of removing a person from it without arousing any suspicion. In the past, when the committee needed bodies, the scientists harvested bodies from hospitals and nursing homes with the help of people that they had installed covertly into the management of those institutions. This new method allowed them to harvest without any inside connection. It also reduced their exposure: fewer operatives in the field. The committee members removed the quarter-sized discs from the temples of the attendants that the scientists had placed on the side of their heads as the attendants came ito the room (this freed the attendants from their paralysis) and laid the bodies down on the floor. The attendants were aware of what was going on the whole time, but were unable to move or talk. After the attendants were released from the spell of the discs, they became dazed and disoriented. The attendants remembered nothing of what happened to them (not why they were all in one location of the building or why the attendants were all lying on the floor). As each individual regained equilibrium (less than five minutes after the committee members left), the first to reach a phone called the fire department. He had assumed that carbon monoxide or some other poisonous gas had leaked into the building. None of the members of the staff"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"remembered there was an inspection in progress prior to the attendants passing out. Apparently the discs on the temples not only paralyzed people, but also the discs left the victims with a bit of amnesia about what had been experienced during and just prior to the time each was paralyzed. The committee members who were monitoring the phone lines the whole time continued to do so. The committee listened in on the conversation between the staff member and the police department. The scientists made sure things were under control before they left. Only two of the attendants were taken to a hospital for observation and were released that same night. The others had no problems and declined to go to the hospital. No damage was doe. The final police report indicated that none of the elderly patients were affected. The report stated that the staff must have succumbed to the fumes from a cleaning solution that was found near the area where the attendants claimed to have had their dizzy spells. The committee was undaunted by what took place that night. The scientists were confident that they could overcome unforeseen problems in future operations. Shortly after, those in charge of the program pulled the plug on the use of nursing homes as a source of humans on which to experiment. The committee did so for two reasons: first, they knew that all the newly rejuvenated old people would eventually draw attention and possibly give credence to the UFO phenomena. Secondly, the cost of relocating all those people was prohibitive. All the money that was earmarked for the committee was sufficient for the present needs of the committee. There was no contingency fund. If they had to increase their budget by a million or so to allow for a relocation department, the committee risked becoming more visible to the Congress - who ultimately funded all government programs, even the ones they know nothing about. In the years during the Cold War, it was simpler to finance clandestine operations. Increasingly, the funding of the committee became its “Achilles Heel.” The committee was told that the funding they were receiving was still coming from the National Treasury, but that would not be the source in the future. ***** Chapter 7 The Second Encounter Bill Smith (not his real name), the committee member who was abducted and allowed to observe the Aliens, had his second encounter. It happened four months after his first. The Aliens took Bill Smith while he was at work. There were others in the building at the time, but Bill was working alone in his office when it happened. It was around noon and he was eating a sandwich, which one of his colleagues had picked up for him. Bill was eating while going over a report he had to turn in that afternoon. An instant later, he was in an Alien ship without his sandwich. The Aliens did not give him an explanation about why he was not allowed to finish his lunch before w2hisking him away. Not that he asked, but it was certainly on his mind. Bill Smith knew he could not keep secrets from the Aliens. There was a woman in the craft with him. She was on a table and he was standing nearby. She was young and somehow Bill Smith knew her exact age. She was nineteen-years-old. She was naked, yet he felt no sexual desire toward her (despite her attractive features). She was lying on the surgical table with a horrified look on her face. She was scared and confused with no clue about what was going on around her. She was not able to talk, but Bill knew all her thoughts - a privilege he did not have the first time he was abducted. The girl kept her eyes on Bill and in her mind, she kept asking, \"Why are you doing this to me?\" She was not sure if she was being raped, or if she had been in some kind of accident and was in an emergency room. Bill Smith knew her thoughts, but it was not mutual. She did not know his thoughts. He had the urge to speak to her and give her comfort, but he was unable to, verbally or otherwise. Bill knew she was three months pregnant, but he did not know how he knew"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"all these things or why. As he stood there watching the girl, her whole life was made known to him. He then realized why the Aliens were giving him information gradually, while letting the hundreds of questions that popped into his head go unanswered. No human mind is big enough to hold but a fraction of what there is to know - and only piecemeal at that! The little information that Bill Smith did receive about the girl was overwhelming his mind. But why did he need to know all about her? He felt he knew her, but did not recall ever meeting her. Bill Smith watched as the Aliens removed the fetus from the girl's body and then carried it to an adjacent room. Another Alien came back moments later and inserted another fetus into her. Bill was not told if it was the same fetus that the Aliens took out of her, or if it was a different one. If it was the same one, what had been done to it? The Aliens told Bill it was not yet time for him to know that answer. Bill was allowed to know that this girl was genetically linked to him. In fact, Bill was her biological father, even though he never met her mother. Her mother was implanted with his semen on board that same Alien craft nineteen years earlier. That fetus was is grandson! Bill was told that he fathered many others like her and it was not important for him to have contact with any of them, nor would it be possible for him to have contact, even if he were allowed to know who they all were. He was not allowed to know who this girl was, other than what the Aliens had already let him know. Bill was also not allowed to know where the girl was from. She could be from anywhere in the world, the Aliens told him. After the Aliens returned Bill Smith to his office, he would never see her again. The Aliens told Bill that the physical body was of little importance. It was a mere vessel that held the essence of what humans are. Because that girl and countless others are related to his body, it had no bearing to who they were spiritually. His genes did not pass on any part of the soul. Although many of the features such as looks, color of hair and eyes are passed on by the genes, disposition and some traits that a child shares with parents are learned from parents as the child grows up - so not necessarily a part of the gene pool. Although this last statement is ambiguous, the Aliens did not feel they needed to clarify that idea for Bill. The whole scope of what the Aliens are doing would never be revealed to humanity, although there would be limited information given to some, like the information that Bill received. There have been many throughout history who were given knowledge by the Aliens - mostly in the form of new technology. From whom the decisions were coming was not told to Bill (he asked them who they were taking orders from). Some of the things that were divulged to him seemed pointless and made no sense. “Eat bananas on Wednesday. Feed the lions every Friday.” Others were equivocal: “Save the rain forest, destroy the trees.” Bill felt that many of the answers to his questions (when he did receive them) were purposely vague. Other comments were completely confusing and occasionally mean-spirited. After Bill Smith was returned to his office, he looked at the clock on the wall and determined he was gone for one hour. Bill had no recollection of the Aliens taking him or returning him. He found himself sitting at the desk in the same position he was in before his abduction. If it were not for the fact that he was in an area with Alien objects strewn all around him, he would have believed he was hallucinating. The experience and his memory of it were clear. Bill pondered what the Aliens told him about his offspring not being his. He had two children at home with whom he had a strong bond and felt cheated and overwhelmed at the thought that he sired untold numbers of children, who are all strangers to him. Bill Smith was depressed after that encounter. No one in his department noticed that Bill had been abducted. He took the rest of that day off and told no one what had happened to him that afternoon. As he drove home, he could not help but see a little bit of himself in everyone he passed. He never felt that his body was “all that special.” Why then did they use him as a human stud? Envy Stymies the Committee Two weeks went by before Bill told the committee members about his last abduction. Rather than being excited about that revelation, his colleagues"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"were envious and puzzled about why no others in the committee group had been given the privilege that Bill Smith seemed to be enjoying. There was some jealousy in the committee and Bill's colleagues seemed less interested in what Bill learned from the Aliens on that encounter. Some of his colleagues accused him of making up the stories. The scientists could not understand why Bill was singled out from the rest of them. Was he smarter than the rest of them? Was he better looking? Was his blood type special? The committee mainly wanted to know why the Aliens could not make themselves known to the whole committee. After all, \"They (committee) were in this together,\" the men reminded Bill. The committee members had no doubt that Aliens did exist, but they did not believe Bill was being visited. The scientists thought Bill was becoming delusional from the many years of working around Alien things and not making contact. Bill was accused of dominating the committee meetings because he claimed to have more knowledge about the Aliens, which he did. During that time his colleagues voted to have him expelled from the committee. The higher-ups who felt his link with the Aliens was real vetoed that vote. The committee then made matters worse by putting Bill in charge of the committee. Then Bill's committee colleagues rebelled and a mediator had to come in and try to fix the rift. After two weeks with no progress, the program was put on hold. Two months passed before the committee was reactivated. Presumably the department continued operating during that time, probably under the leadership of one of the higher-ups. An operation of the magnitude that this was could not easily be brought to a stop. None of the documents indicated what went on while the committee was absent. Bill Smith was again put in charge of the committee. Some of the original members were reinstated. Others were transferred to different departments. Bill spent the two months vacationing in the Hawaiian Islands. While he, a committee member, was there, the Aliens visited with him every day.
