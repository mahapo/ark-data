R eturn to Part 1 Updated March 25 / Original report March 23, 2009 Hoehne, Colorado - I arrived back at my Albuquerque, New Mexico, office from the Duran mutilation investigation on Sunday night, March 15. Two days later on the morning of Tuesday, March 17, in Hoehne, Colorado - about fifteen miles northeast of Trinidad and about 40 miles east of Mike Duran’s place - rancher Tom Miller was stunned to find a 1-week-old male calf next to the feed bin dead and so bizarrely mutilated that it might be unique in animal mutilation history. In all the mutilation cases I have investigated, I don't think I've ever seen anything like this one.

O ne-week-old male calf had both eyes and tongue intact, but both hears had been cut off at the skull in hardened, plasticized tissue that in previous mutilation cases is characteristic of excision by heat. Image © 2009 by Chuck Zukowski . Further, both ears were cut off at the skull, leaving circular patterns of hardened skin. Both eyes and the tongue remained, which is also unusual, since the majority of animal mutilations include the removal of at least one ear and one eye along with the removal of the tongue and jaw flesh. On Tuesday, March 17, 2009, after the grotesque mutilation of the 1-week-old male calf was discovered, rancher Tom Miller placed the calf's remains on his flatbed truck, drove into a garage and locked the doors so nothing could get to the calf's carcass during the night. Then on Wednesday afternoon, March 18, investigator Chuck Zukowski arrived and photographed the remains. Chuck Zukowski is a trained El Paso County, Colorado, Reserve Deputy Sheriff, whose full time profession is designing micro chips. Chuck also applies his technical knowledge to field investigations for the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON). Chuck confirmed for me that when he examined the ear tissue, it was hardened “like plastic.” Chuck cut out both ear excision tissues and hand-delivered them to the Colorado State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratories in Fort Collins for analysis. As soon as there are test results, I will report further about the extraordinary calf mutilation at Earthfiles.com and in an Earthfiles podcast. Tom Miller has been ranching on the same land for at least fifty years and told me he has never seen anything like it. He said natural predators would leave a bloody, torn mess. There is no sign of blood anywhere on what is left of the week-old-calf. Further, Mr. Miller told me the calf’s mother was extremely protective of her calf and would not let"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"anyone near him. Interview: Tom Miller, Owner and Rancher, River Valley Ranch, Hoehne, Colorado: “My cows are so protective of their calves. Sometimes you can’t touch the calf without that big momma cow being on top of you. That’s a strange part of it, too. Sometimes I have to doctor my little calves and I’ve got to be real careful and real quick to go at that calf and doctor it quickly before that cow is on top of me. So, how did this happen without the cow being just right in the mutilator’s face? That’s a strange thing. WHAT WAS THE CONDITION OF THE MOTHER COW THAT MORNING WHEN YOU FOUND THE COMPLETELY EVISCERATED YOUNG CALF? Well, she was real excited and she was bellowing. Actually, all of my cows were running around and usually they don’t do that. Whenever I bring feed, they are all right there at the trough. But this morning (Tuesday, March 17, 2009), they were all running back and forth like they had been spooked. HOW MANY COWS IN YOUR HERD? There’s about 80 head out there. SO 80 COWS WERE VERY AGITATED ON THE MORNING THAT YOU FOUND THE EVISCERATED CALF AND THE MOTHER WAS ESPECIALLY BELLERING AND A G I TATAT E D . That’s right. HOW DID YOU CALM THE MOTHER DOWN? I don’t know if I really did much. After I fed them, most of them came back and started eating. But the mother of the mutilated calf was still going around bellowing. Later in the day, she was still there after all the rest of the cows had left, she was still standing right there where I found the calf. Actually, it was pretty sad to see her there. She was just bellowing and didn’t know what happened to her calf. AND COULD SMELL THE CALF PROBABLY THERE. I think so because the mother was standing just at the spot where the calf had been.” F eed bin where 1-week-old male calf was found dead and mutilated on Tuesday morning, March 17, 2009. Image © 2009 by Chuck Zukowski. H ow did anyone, or anything, get this calf without a fight with the mother cow? And how did that 1-week-old calf end up dead with most of his body gone without blood, right next to the feed bin, far from his mother and the herd? Because the calf’s pelvis bones were broken, Tom Miller wondered if the calf had been dropped from the air to the ground. This was the third mutilation on his ranch since the 1980s when Tom first found a 500-pound steer with both ears, eyes, tongue and some of its"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"sex organs removed. His second mutilation was another young steer in 1998 in which both ears, eyes, tongue, and genitals were removed. And now the 1-week-old male calf in March 2009. The bloodless, trackless nature of each animal death leaves Tom Miller’s mind open to the possibility that the perpetrators are not humans. Tom Miller: “If there really are those aliens or whatever they are out there and they are coming down, why are they mutilating calves and other animals? Why would they just take portions of the calf? What do they do with it? There are a lot of questions I have. WHY WOULD THEY DROP ANY OF THE ANIMALS THAT APPEAR TO CLEARLY BE DROPPED BACK TO THE PASTURE OR THE FEED LOT OR WHEREVER IT WAS FROM WHICH IT WAS TAKEN? IF IT IS SOMETHING THAT IS NON-HUMAN, WHY ARE THEY RETURNING ANY OF THE MUTILATED ANIMALS TO BE FOUND? Yes, that’s true. And with mine, they dropped it where I could purposefully see it. You know, the mutilated calf could have been down in the river somewhere in the brush and I might never have found it. But it was dropped right where I had to see it. I couldn’t get around the feed bin without seeing it. Now, whether that was an accident or if it was on purpose, it’s strange. I've never seen anything like what happened to that little calf. IF SOMETHING OUT THERE WANTS HUMANS TO PAY ATTENTION TO THEIR INTRUSIONS, INTERACTIONS, WITH EARTH LIFE, WHY? Yes, why? Why do they do this just to animals? Or maybe they do take humans, too? I don’t know. People are gone missing. I’ll always be thinking of this, you know - is it going to happen again tomorrow? Or the next day? Or next week?” T he Day After Roswell © 1997 by U. S. Army Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso, now deceased. Available at: Amazon.com. L t. Col. Philip J. Corso - retired from the United States Army and now deceased - wrote in his 1997 book, The Day After Roswell: “In the Pentagon from 1961 to 1963, I reviewed field reports from local and state police agencies about the discoveries of dead cattle whose carcasses looked as though they had been systematically mutilated and there were reports from people who claimed to have been abducted by aliens and experimented on. ... Our intelligence organizations ... believed that the cattle mutilations that could not be obviously explained away as pranks, predators, or ritual slaughter, were the results of interventions by extraterrestrials who were harvesting specific organs - or harvesting for experimentation.” Historically, when there have been animal mutilations in one geographic region, there might be several more over the next few months.
