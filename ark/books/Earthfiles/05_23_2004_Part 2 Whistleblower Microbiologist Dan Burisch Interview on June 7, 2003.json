Click here for Part 1 May 23, 2004 Las Vegas, Nevada - On June 7, 2003, Bill Hamilton - then Executive Director of Skywatch International - was given permission by microbiologist Dan Burisch, Ph.D., to interview Dr. Burisch on-the-record as a whistleblower in a videotaped session attended by five other researchers with their own videotape cameras. The subjects were Dan Burisch's 1994 work with the J-Rod entity at the S-4/5 underground laboratory, Area 51, Nellis AFB, Nevada; the Doctrine for Converging Time Line Paradox (DCTP); and Dan's concern about the future of this planet. Here is Part 2 of that June 7, 2003, videotaped interview in Las Vegas, reviewed and corrected by Danny B Burisch, Ph.D. (His family says his middle initial has no period. See birth certificate in More Information below) In this section of the interview, questions were asked by Bill Hamilton and the others. The questions are ALL CAPS without specifying specific questioner, except where specifically noted for Bill Hamilton. Interview: PART 2 - June 7, 2003 Transcript of Dan Burisch, Ph.D., Interview Videotaped in Las Vegas, Nevada Preliminary comment before formal interview began. Dan B Burisch, Ph.D., Microbiologist IV, formerly Nevada Test Site, Area 50 Sector 2, Area 51 Sectors 3 and 4, Las Vegas, Nevada: \"We spoke about another person who had a heart condition. I figured it was a Need-To-Know basis above that. I didn't figure there was direct - the rumors coming at me about the potential for public acclimation that would be for him, those initials (person unnamed), to take back as the hero in this situation because he loves playing hero. You show me a piece of paper that says, 'Ordered to remain in the capacity' which means there is a greater loop. I've had a chance to speak to the individual one time. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"BILL HAMILTON: AND I HAVE A RECORD OF THAT. I heard there is a transcript involving that which got out. In fact, I was shown it one time from the first meeting where I bolted, the one where you scared the hell out of me! Not as much as you did today (laughter). This is a more relaxed circumstance (here). (IN DOCUMENTS) I INFER THEIR (MJ-12) USE OF THE WORD 'BIRD' REFERS TO EBEs (extraterrestrial biological entities). Ye s . I INFER THAT THE USE OF THE WORD 'CLOCK' REFERS TO THE TIME LINE PARADOX. Yes, I would buy that.\" Part 2 of Interview Begins Here: \"WHAT WAS IT THAT YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE LOOKING AT WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THE SLIDES OF THE J-ROD MATERIAL? We were looking at extremely minute microglial cells (pathologic sensors in the brain). We knew that they were eukaryotic.\" (Editor's Note: Eukaryote cells contain specialized organelles and are found in all living plants, animals and fungi. See More Information below.) Eukaryote cells contain specialized organelles and are found in all living plants, animals and fungi. (Editor's Note continued: Another type of cell is the prokaryotes that make up bacteria and other organisms that do not have special organelles. Prokaryotes are believed by some to have preceded eukaryotic cells. But what caused the prokaryote cells to change to the much more complicated eukaryote design is not understood.) Prokaryote cells are the basis for bacterial and other primordial microorganisms that allegedly came before eukaryote cells. Dan Burisch: \"However, the J-Rod cells were unusual in the sense that their cytoplasm and their internal organization, the organelle structures, were fused such as lysosome or peroxisome to mitochondria and things like that. We had no idea what we were looking at. The original contention made by individuals next to me was that we were looking at some type of biological warfare material. They were intermediate (level) with more experience"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"than me involving such matters, so - and being that I was new - I was letting them take the lead. Entering the S-4 and 5 Level Clean Sphere \"Home\" of the J-Rod TELL US A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF PREPARING FOR ENTRY INTO THE CLEAN SPHERE. Right. Well, we would undergo a medical examination, at least during the early time frame of the introductions of the 1991 to 1992 time frame when we were doing introductions. We had regular systematic medicals by physicians. Following that, we would be suited first, catheterized, plugged and suited. A communication apparatus was placed on our heads. There was a cooling system set up. For all intents and purposes, it was a space suit, a total encapsulated suit something like what you would find in a NASA facility. Not so much something you would see, for instance, at CDC (Centers for Disease Control)- not that type of Level 4 suit. It was more a regular space-type suit with joints. We were suited up, we were pressurized and then walked with our cooling system and our hosing down a ramp into the Ambassadorial Suite (where J-Rod kept). Following that, we were lead up a gantry way which had been moved into position by the Clean Sphere, which had been previously rotated up through an iris through the floor. He (J-Rod) was held actually below the Ambassadorial Suite level and that was raised up as needed. What they did with him down there, he did not say. And they (bosses) did not tell me. It was not a need-to-know issue. Apparently that's where they dealt with the cleaning of the Sphere and all that down there. It was regular housed-animal maintenance, as they treated him. We would be lead up the gantry way. The hoses would be hooked into an interior system inside the doorway that was exterior to the Clean Sphere. And it was called 'Six Degree System.' We would be lead in. The door would be closed and we would be pressurized inside of the gantry way. Following that, there was a drug system that was set up. Once there was an equal pressurization between the gantry way and the Clean Sphere, we would then be told to proceed forward. I would raise a hand in acknowledgment. We were not supposed to talk at the time at all because nothing verbal around the specimen, around the J-Rod. Why? (no verbal) I was never told, but we were not supposed to talk around the J-Rod. I moved the drug system and re-hooked a secondary set of hosing inside the Clean Sphere, checked the pressurization and once that was done, the door to the Clean Sphere would be closed behind me and I would presume that the pressurization remained the same in the gantry way. Following that I would do my business inside the Clean Sphere involving contact with the J-Rod and removing the samples (from the J-Rod.) J-Rod's Neuropathy Disease WHAT WAS THE REASON YOU WERE REMOVING SAMPLES FROM THE J-ROD? We were removing samples to attempt a treatment, a full diagnosis and treatment for a paraprotein-related monoclonal gammopathy of uncertain significance type disorder which had various attributes to it.\" (Editor's Note from 1997 Leukemia Research Fund: The blood normally contains a large number of different proteins called the plasma proteins. One type of protein is called gamma globulin and combines to make antibodies. Normally many different types of gamma globulin are produced to deal with different infections. When most of the protein being produced is one particular form of gamma globulin this is called monoclonal gammopathy. A clone is a population of cells which are all derived from one original cell. In monoclonal gammopathy all of the abnormal protein is identical proving that it came from cells of one clone (monoclonal). If there is no evidence of disease such as myeloma or lymphoma which would explain the presence of a monoclonal gammopathy it is called monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS). The clinical importance of monoclonal gammopathy in patients with no symptoms and no other signs of disease is not yet understood. In about 80% of people with MGUS the level of monoclonal protein is low and the vast majority of these people will remain well and never have symptoms related to MGUS.) Dan Burisch: \"Among those were a Cockayne type presence to the J-Rod, Cockayne"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"syndrome type presence and certain genetic issues involving chromosome 5 and 17, which lead us to Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT). CMT is a hereditary progressive neuromuscular disorder that primarily affects the feet, legs and hands and their glycoprotein problems. Essentially they were losing heat. They were not transmitting energy, something like a dystrophy. Cockayne syndrome sufferers have multi-systemic disorders due to a defect in the ability of cells to repair DNA that is being transcribed. Photograph by D. Atherton. Because of the problems at their axons, there were difficulties of action potential propagation in Schwann cells and nodes of Ranviere. They were not transmitting energy, something like a dystrophy. When an action potential puts down axon, the action potentials were dying at the synapses. They were also loosing energy because there was a demyelination of the myelin sheath protecting the nerve axon underway. That demylenation process was well, since the Q-94 document was tied to a CMT 1a type problem like Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) called PMP22, which is a protein over 22 which an over-expression of that gene causes a greater demylenation. We tied that to the demyelination issue involving the promoters for the PMP22. Those two promoters for it were selectively deselected with the use of TFOs or \"Triplex Forming\" Oligonucleotides. It's essentially an SSBNA vector expression system that we are using. (Editor's Note about Oligonucleotides : sequence of a few - to many hundreds - of nucleotides, linked with each other. An oligonucleotide thus corresponds to a (very) short DNA single strand.) (Editor's Note from medical text about ssDNA : DNA cloning vectors combine the cloning and expression advantages of DNA plasmid (orcosmid) systems with the sequencing and mutagenesis advantages of single-strand phage systems. The pMEX vectors contain the ColE1 origin of replication and the phage f1 intergenic region. Thus, genes and gene banks can be cloned, sequenced, mutagenized, and expressed in the same vector system. ) Each nerve cell ( ne uron ) within the ganglion sends out a long, microscopically thin extension called an axon . The axon extends to larger body objects such as muscle and teeth. Individual axons combine within several layers of connective tissue myelin sheaths to form larger nerve bundles. These in turn combine to form nerve trunks. In humans when myelin sheaths deteriorate and form plaques, such as in multiple sclerosis, paralysis can occur. BILL HAMILTON: \"DOESN'T THAT INTERFERE THE DEMYELINATION PROCESS - ISN'T THAT SIMILAR TO CONDITIONS THAT HUMANS SOMETIMES HAVE LIKE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY AND MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS? Yes, except that he was not forming plaques. He was simply demyelinating, repairing the demyelinating area with the immune system. They've got a cell-mediated immune system just like we have. The cells are different. They've got glycoproteins - very strange-looking blood-like material. But that's why we use the term 'analog' so much because it was different."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" What was S-4 and 5, Area 51 Like? COULD YOU TELL ABOUT GENERALITIES AROUND THE BUILDING IN WHICH YOU WORKED? WHERE IT WAS AND HOW YOU GOT THERE? Sure. If you want to experience a Site 4, watch The Andromeda Strain (movie).\" (Editor's note with feature film summary: When a small space probe falls to earth in a remote village of New Mexico, all but two of the town's inhabitants--an infant and an old alcoholic - meet death as their blood turns to powder. After two reconnaissance pilots have also perished, a national state of emergency is declared. The two survivors and the recovered space probe are transported to a mammoth five-story underground laboratory, and a team of scientists swiftly brought to the lab to discover the nature of the deadly organism brought by the space probe. Through exhaustive tests, the team learns that the minute organism, dubbed the 'Andromeda Strain' (nearest large galaxy to Milky Way), is alien in nature, and the scientists must quickly find a cure before all of humanity is wiped out.) Dan Burisch: \"Except at the real S-4, there's a little more color. Out at Site-4, they've got a nice orange stripe on the wall and they've got a red and blue stripe on the floor which gives you general directions, depending upon the floor you're on and you can't move without getting stopped anyway. Now we're talking separate from the Groom facility here. I'm aware of several floors at the Groom Lake facility and finally the majority of the hot stuff was taken over to Site 4. At Site 4, we're talking four basic levels. The first level they are coded 4-1, 4-2, 4-3, 4-4 and finally where he (J-Rod) was stored, it's 4-5. That 4-5 designation was painted on the wall for him because 4 and 5 equals 9. That's in fact why they built nine hangars on the Galileo and Side Kick levels at the 4-1 level. The 4-2 level contained Looking Glass (Project), Alice's Glass. In fact, outside the door for the major facility, there is a White Rabbit with a clock it's a very large statue and it's wired above the doorway. Project Looking Glass (MJ-12) and the Physics of Time Travel The Looking Glass Project I find out is related to one of the ERPs (Einstein, Rosen, Podolsky, also known as Einstein-Rosen Bridges, ERBs). It uses some kind of and this was found out just in the last two weeks it's composed of a spherical spinning arc rectangular solid matrix of nickel, cadmium and barium. There is a spinning disk underneath it which is super cooled. Into this is injected into the center of these spinning I'm not a physicist spinning disks is injected an argon gas. Into that is injected some type of repulsion matter gravity repulsion matter. They are obtaining the gravity repulsion matter from the heavy materials that have been obtained from the J-Rods: Element 115 variety material.\" (Editor's Note: First referenced by Robert Lazar in 1990 after he worked at S-4 and Area 51 to help figure out the gravity-controlled propulsion system of an alien spacecraft.)

Dan Burisch: \"Apparently when they bombard (the stable form of) Element 115 with enough electromagnetism, the stuff repels gravity and it turns into some sort of exotic matter. They spin it fast enough, it opens where they can see through it and that is, from what I understand, the great prize of what is going on in the world right now are those devices. Why do you think the British are running around in Iraq right now looking for the climatological records that just happened to disappear out of the Baghdad Museum with the rest of the cylinder seals? I have done a report detailing information about those cylinder seals."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"SO, DAN, DOES THAT MEAN WHEN THEY ARE ENGAGING THIS DEVICE IN PROJECT LOOKING GLASS, IS THIS SOMETHING THAT THEY USE ONLY FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF INFORMATION? OR CAN THEY TRANSPORT A MATERIAL OBJECT THROUGH TIME? You know the answer to that. At least you have probably heard some rumor. There have been mistakes. There were mistakes. Animals were attempted to transport from one location to another in the production of two of the devices and they put them in resonance or something like that. I'm not a physicist. I don't know. But I was in fact present during a human account. The human did not survive. The human was not put in there under duress of any sort. It was a volunteer situation and the human did not survive. The human did not move. The human stayed where the human was put. But the human changed and - I don't want to talk about it anymore. IT WAS AN ATTEMPT AT TIME TRAVEL? In essence, yes. It was a linear, an attempt to transport an individual over a linear distance which I understand is the same thing as time travel. Distance is time. From what I understand, they have only used it for information purposes. How they get the information out of it, I have no clue. I don't know. What specific information, they've obtained? I only know of one piece of information and that is why the rush is underway to get LOTUS done by the 2005 (T-9 Treaty) deadline. In fact, this group of J-Rods that are not complying with the wishes of the Committee and the wishes of the rest of the J-Rods and associated brothers (there is an effort) to put a clamp on them so they stop their influence within the political structures of our government, including the financial structures. It is in fact they who are slowing down the progress to stop picking up these little (Einstein Rosen ) gates that were put together and would be our downfall in 2012. Wormhole illustration on Page 483, Black Holes & Time Warps Â© 1994 by Kip S. Thorne. DAN, WHAT DO YOU WANT YOURSELF? What can be done for me? I would be very happy and relieved to feel as though I was responding to the elected government of the United States of America with what talents God has given me. I am responsible to the people of the United States of America. The nature of the information to which I am privy is sensitive enough that the full disclosure of that information would have to be done in an appropriate location and under appropriate circumstances. Certain military application information would have to be done in a closed session for the national security. As I said to you at the Luxor (Hotel in Las Vegas), the Congress knows it is NOT in control. They know this is a wild train out of control and they want that control back. They are not stupid. They know there are things going on down the hall from them that they can't fathom. They deserve to have that back in their hands because that's what they were elected to do. And if we care at all about what's left of our Constitution, they deserve to have that in their hands. Are we the masters of our destiny in our country? Aren't we supposed to be? Yes, we're supposed to be. Dan Burisch's First Encounter with the J-Rod at S-4 and 5 CAN YOU DESCRIBE IN DETAIL WHAT IT IS LIKE WHEN YOU SAW THE J-ROD FOR THE FIRST TIME (IN THE CLEAN SPHERE)? My original feeling was that I was looking at a giant insect. That's the best I can do just off the cuff. It looked like a giant insect, being dark brown and hunched over in the corner, very insectoid in appearance. It almost looked like it had an exoskeleton. I felt afraid inside because I was always told that monsters weren't real. And now I find out that they are, but they live in the hearts of men. It was fear, excitement, complete astonishment. Honestly, (before other knowledge), I thought we were dealing with some kind of monkey, something like an Old World ape. But indeed it wasn't. But that's what my feeling was (scared). I'm not going to try to talk about how intellectual I was at the time about it. It scared the hell"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"out of me! WHEN DID YOU FIRST ACCEPT THE IDEA THAT THIS WAS A NON-HUMAN BEING, EXTRATERRESTRIAL, SOMETHING OUT OF THIS WORLD? I'm trying to remember what I was feeling when I was looking at the briefing books because even when I was first introduced to the J-Rod, they were hem hawing around as to its origin. His origin. (I thought), 'Poppycock!' I did not believe it. However, deep inside I held open a possibility because of what happened to me earlier in my life. I held open the possibility that such things could be true. But it could not happen to me, that old, 'It can't happen to you,' feeling. So, to me it was poppycock, rubbish until I found out otherwise. DTIC and \"King Tut\" Briefing Books About J-Rods CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE BRIEFING BOOKS? Sure, (The J-Rod briefing books) were called 'King Tuts.' They were in blue binders and all were labeled with the letter 'K.' They (also) had the letters 'DTIC\" on the front of them. (On June 7, 2003) I still don't know what those letters stand for. That was 1987, the end of 1987, and I still don't know what the letters stand for. I haven't done independent searches. Can you tell me what DTIC means? BILL HAMILTON: I DON'T KNOW.\" (Editor's Note: Later Bill Hamilton learned DTIC stands for Defense Technical Information Center. The Defense Technical Information Center, DTIC, is the central facility for the collection and dissemination of scientific and technical information for the Department of Defense (DoD). As an element of the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA), DTIC serves as a vital link in the transfer of information among DoD personnel, DoD contractors and potential contractors and other U.S. Government agency personnel and their contractors. ) Dan Burisch: \" Shocks me that you don't know either. They had a white-colored DTIC printed on the front of them (blue binders). They were marked with several sections, including physiology, general biology, social structure, political structure of the J-Rods, their origins, potential implications for interactions with humankind, cross-contamination issues. They were full of as much information as I could take in during the times they were allowing me to read them. I still don't know what that damned DTIC means. They were called 'King Tuts.' They were update books. This is another reason why I didn't figure how Steven how I could be promoted to a Working Group Leader above Steven. But I found out and I told you why. RIGHT. At the time, I couldn't figure it out because he (Steven) kept the updates. He made sure that all of the King Tuts were updated. He did the briefing films that are still resident at Site-4, or at least were on my last visit. So, the man of that importance, I could not figure out why (I would be promoted above him.) But again, that's mute now. WHAT DID THE DOCUMENTS SAY ABOUT THE J-RODS? Close-knit, very well ordered society, one which is numerologically based, one which speaks to others that were called 'Brothers.' I now find out they are those who left on a spiritual path to another location to the famed Duwat (heavenly domain) of Orion and the Epsilon Eridani area.

He can't sue me for that, I hope. But they (Santilli) were disgusting. The Brookings Institution paper was present, as well as several position papers clarifying the Brookings Institute. However, each of these I was allowed into they had separate folders and separate clips within them inside the 3-ring binders. I was told which numbers I was allowed to open up. They were given to me on a card and those were the ones I was allowed to review during the times I was allowed to review them. Most of the stuff ranged from military applications, physics of the craft I could not have cared less (about the technology). I was more interested in taking in the biology issues. (The craft technology) just doesn't interest me, aside from the fact that I am interested in the biophysical interface between the hand, mind and craft. The beings have on their hands a number of pads. There are open nerves which are protected by various glycoproteins and those glycoproteins are selectively pushed forward or sucked backwards via capillary action. Or they can be through an active fashion pulled back and it kind of pulls a viscous sheath back and allows the J-Rod to have direct interface with the craft. That interested me, although most of it at the time and still some of it now, I have no understanding of. A lot of it has to do with electronics and I don't pretend to understand. I was most interested in looking at issues involving their histology, histo-pathology issues, including some autopsy photographs that showed disease processes which were naturally occurring within them. Isolations of viral material to include new protocols which were being written as they were being worked, which is what we are doing. That's what we are doing, writing new protocols as we are working forward. All of the old standbys are there: everything from electrofluoresis to anything. But we are writing new protocols as we are going because this is not new territory. This is, pardon the pun, alien territory. HOW MANY BEINGS HAVE WE (U. S. GOVERNMENT) HAD TO WORK WITH? I only met one. I am aware of possibly three from the reading. And at that time, I was so stunned by what I was doing, a lot of it was getting by me. When I read the word 'extraterrestrial,\" I tunnel-visioned. When I finally believed and understood that it was in fact an extraterrestrial (I was) numb, numb.\" Continued in Part 3. More Information: Cockayne Syndrome Cockayne syndrome is a rare inherited disorder in which people are sensitive to sunlight, have short stature, and have the appearance of premature aging. In the classical form of Cockayne syndrome (Type I), the symptoms are progressive and typically become apparent after the age of 1 year. An early onset or congenital form of Cockayne syndrome (Type II) is apparent at birth. Interestingly, unlike other DNA repair diseases, Cockayne syndrome is not linked to cancer. After exposure to UV radiation (found in sunlight), people with Cockayne syndrome can no longer perform a certain type of DNA repair, known as \"transcription-coupled repair.\" This type of DNA repair occurs \"on the fly\" right as the DNA that codes for proteins is being replicated. Two genes defective in Cockayne syndrome, CSA and CSB, have been identified so far. The CSA gene is found on chromosome 5. Both genes code for proteins that interacts with components of the transcriptional machinery and with DNA repair proteins. Escherichia coli , a bacterium, also undergoes transcription-coupled repair, and a yeast counterpart of the CSB gene has also recently been discovered. These similar mechanisms to the one found in humans are invaluable for studying the molecular processes involved in transcription-coupled repair because powerful molecular genetics techniques can be used. A better understanding of the mechanisms involved will help unravel the pathogenesis of disease and may identify potential drug targets. Charcot-Marie-Tooth Charcot-Marie-Tooth is a hereditary progressive nerve disorder. The most common forms of CMT disease cause demyelination of the myelin sheath protecting the nerve axon of the peroneal nerve. CMT type 2, the neuronal form of the disease, affects the nerve axon. The"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"nerve deteriorates causes wasting of muscles, loss of sensation, and claw foot. The severity of the disease ranges from unnoticeable even by the individual affected, to wheelchair bound. The amount of deterioration varies substantially, even within a single family. CMT is not a single disease, but a collection of diseases caused by defects in different genes. CMT can be inherited in a number of different patterns: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive or X linked. The dominant form is the most common. CMT is referred to as Charcot-Marie disease and Peroneal Muscular Atrophy. And CMT is included in the more general term Hereditary Motor and Sensory Neuropathy (HMSN) (see the MD Australia Fact Sheet for more discussion). One name is not used consistently everywhere even today. In addition, the forms of the disease that are included in the definition of CMT, has changed over the years. New forms were identified in 1994 (refer to the genome database on-line). Black Holes and Einstein Rosen Bridges In 1963, the New Zealand mathematician, Roy Kerr, found that if a black hole is rotating a singularity still forms, but in the form of a ring, not a point. It was believed that in principle a particle may be able to fall towards the singularity but if at some point it moved through the hole instead of the ring the particle may not be lost forever. When this was published black holes were not believed to exist and therefore the Kerr solution only really developed in the 1970s, after astronomers discovered what seem to be real black holes. Unfortunately, more modern work published in late August 1998 by Piran and Shahar Hod has seemingly ended this idea. They used complex computer simulations to study how an electrically charged black hole might form and how the singularity would behave. It was the first time that a single computer program has simulated these two processes at once. They showed that a process known as \"mass inflation\" violated the Kerr hypothesis. When a particle moves towards the black hole, the apparent mass of the hole increases to infinity as observed by the object. ( Physical Review Letters, vol 81, p 1554 ). \"This singularity goes through the entire system,\" says Piran. \"It doesn't leave any hole through which matter may pass.\" New Scientist, September 5, 1998 : \"The use of black holes as objects that may aid interstellar travel was to be included in a novel called Contact. While writing the novel in 1985, Carl Sagan turned to for advice to Kip Thorne, at CalTech. Sagan wanted a method of moving a character faster than light, though not in a manner violating the Theory of Relativity. Thorne set two of his PhD students, Michael Morris and Ulvi Yurtsever, the task of working out some details of the physical behaviour of 'wormholes.' This story often appears to attribute the discovery of wormholes to Thorne or Sagan. \"In fact, they were investigated almost as soon as Einstein published General Relativity, far before black holes were established to exist. As early as 1916, less than a year after Einstein had formulated his equations of the general theory, Austrian Ludwig Flamm had realized that Schwarzschild's solution to Einstein's equations actually describes a wormhole connecting two regions of flat spacetime; two universes, or two parts of the same universe.\" Continued in Part 3.
