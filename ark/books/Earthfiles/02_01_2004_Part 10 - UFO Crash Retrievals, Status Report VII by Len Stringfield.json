Here begins Part 10 of Status Report VII, from February 1994. Official Documents: The Real and The Fakes Many of us over the years have received or have seen copies of an alleged official document. They reach a selective list of activists hoping to find a few gluttons who will swallow its dramatic \"inside\" hoopla even though its source will never be known. Eventually, most of these documents, if not all, turn out to be fraudulent. Coming to mind are the questionable Majestic 12 papers. After their release through William Moore and Jaime Shandera, there was a flush of joy among researchers over their ostensible genuineness. But critics who dug deeply into the papers' 'officialese' format such as Barry Greenwood, Editor of Just Cause , found flaws galore and the joy and the document eventually withered away into oblivion. As I have said before in this status report, there are clever tricksters in the Hall of Mirrors. Some are sick, some have agendas. Hopefully, unlike the aforementioned, the document that follows seems to have a solid source, though it is a person I have never met. My intermediary, however, whom I have known for several years, prefers anonymity for reasons he explained and that I can accept. Also, I know that under these conditions, the document at face value cannot be a smoking gun. But, in this business, where is the gun that smokes? While sworn testimony by solid witnesses might be legally persuasive in our judicial system, (it doesn't count) in the tightening disciplines of scientific UFOlogy, tons of UFO testimony is not proof. Well, unless it can be backed up by the claimant revealing a frozen alien cadaver from storage in his refrigerator or the spaceship's propulsion system hidden in his garage. The text of the document presented here, I was told, was faded with age. But its pages have been re-typed for me by my intermediary to be readable. The covering letter, (shown below) however, copied from the original, remains obscure with parts of the text illegible, but I believe it is important that it is published for the record.

The data furnished in this report was provided by the engineer staff personnel of T-2 and Aircraft Laboratory, Engineering Division T-3. Additional data furnished by the scientific personnel of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, CIT, and the Army Air Forces Scientific Advisory Group, headed by Dr. Theodore von Karman. Further analysis was conducted by personnel from Research and Development. 2. It is the collective view of this investigative body that the aircraft recovered by the Army and Air Force units ... are not of U. S. manufacture for the following reasons: a. The circular, disc-shaped 'platform' design does not resemble any design currently under development by this command nor of any Navy project. b. The lack of any external propulsion system, power plant, intake, exhaust either for propeller or jet propulsion, warrants this view. c. The inability of the German scientists from Fort Bliss and White Sands Proving Ground to make a positive identification of a secret German V weapon of these discs. Though the possibility that the Russians have managed to develop such a craft remains. The lack of any markings, ID numbers of instructions in Cyrillic has placed serious doubt in the minds of many that the objects recovered are not of Russian manufacture either. d. Upon examination of the interior of the craft, a compartment exhibiting a possible atomic engine was discovered. At least this is the opinion of Dr. Oppenheimer and Dr. von Karman. A possibility exists that part of the craft itself comprises the propulsion system, thus allowing the reactor to function as a heat exchanger and permitting the storage of energy, unlike the release of energy of our atomic bombs. The description of the power room is as follows: 1) A doughnut-shaped tube approximately thirty-five feet in diameter, made of what appears to be plastic material, surrounding a central core (see sketch in Tab 1). This tube appeared to be filled with a clear substance, possibly a heavy water. A large rod, centered inside the tube, was wrapped in a coil of what appears to be of copper material, ran through the circumference of the tube. This may be the reactor control mechanism or a storage battery. There were no moving parts of the spaces examined. 2) This activation of an electrical potential is believed to be the primary power to the reactor, though it is only a theory at present. Just how a heavy water reactor functions in this environment is unknown. 3) Underneath the power plant was discovered a ball-turret, approximately ten feet in diameter. This turret was encompassed by a series of gears that has an unusual ratio not known by any of our engineers. On the underside of the turret were four circular cavities coated with some smooth material not identified. These cavities are symmetrical, but seem to be movable. Just how is not known. The movement of the turret coincides with the dome-shaped cupola compartment above the power room. It is believed that the main propulsion system is a bladeless turbine, similar to current development now underway at AMC and the Mogul Project. A possible theory was devised by Dr. August Steinhoff (a Paperclip scientist), and Dr. Werner von Braun and Dr."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Theodore von Karman: as the craft moves through the atmosphere, it somehow draws the hydrogen from the atmosphere and by an induction process, generates an atomic fusion reaction (see Tab 2). The air outside the craft would be ionized; thus, propelling the craft forward. Coupled with the circular air foil for lift, the craft would presumably have an unlimited range and air speed. This may account for the reported absence of any noise. e. There is a flight deck located inside the cupola section. It is round and domed at the top. The absence of canopy, observation windows/blisters, or any optical projection, lends support to the opinion that this craft is either guided by remote viewing or is remotely controlled. 1) A semi-circular photo-tube array (possibly television). 2) Crew compartments were hermetically sealed via a solidification process. 3) No weld marks, rivets or soldered joints. 4) Craft components appear to be molded and pressed into a perfect fit.'\" To be continued in Part 11.
