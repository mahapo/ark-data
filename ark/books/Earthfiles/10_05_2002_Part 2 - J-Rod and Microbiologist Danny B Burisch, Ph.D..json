Copy of Danny B Crain (aka Dan Burisch) \"Certificate of Live Birth\" at 4:28 a.m. on February 2, 1964, in St. Francis Hospital in Lynwood, California - a suburb of Los Angeles. Birth certificate provided by \"Dodie\" Crain. Education: _ 1986 B.A., University of Nevada, Las Vegas, Psychology. _ 1988 M.S., St. Patrick's Seminary, Biology. _ 1989 Ph.D., State University of New York, Stonybrook, Microbiology and Molecular Genetics. July 17, 1990, Married Deborah Kay Burisch who had a child from previous marriage. 1995 name change to match child's legal last name. Bill Hamilton writes: \"A secrecy agreement for the Tonopah Test Range/R4809 dated October 14, 1989 bearing his (Burisch's) signature lists his SSAN as (deleted for privacy) and his rank as 05, and his title as MB III (Microbiology) and his employer as USN DOD Naval Research Laboratory. Another later document gives his service rank as Captain, U.S. Naval Reserve and his title as Microbiologist IV.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" Dan B.

Photograph © 2002 by Bill Hamilton. \"WHAT DID DAN BURISCH SAY ABOUT THE ZETA RETICULII SYSTEM? Well, he did mention that what he saw in the documents was that the J-Rod type beings were originally from a planet around one of the Zeta Reticulii stars and that it, I believe, I don't recall exactly but it had a longer diurnal cycle than the earth. I'm not sure it was. It had a longer annual period in its orbit around the sun. Dr. Burisch told me that the J-Rods and other blond humanoid types used the star, Gliese 876-c, as a kind of remote camp to study the earth. He told me that, 'Gliese 876-c is the only one I have been given information about. It is not what we would consider habitable. However, it is the location that they selected for their remote staging base, the one that they use in a cooperative effort to study and interact with us. It was described to me as being below the cloudy surface layer, as this planet appears to have a great deal of gas on the surface. The rationale behind this is that both Zeta Reticulii and Sirius/Orion (Epsilon Orionis star system) were too far to keep going back to. They needed to conserve energy and time, so they established a cooperative base. When they need to return home, they use the Gliese 876-c as a jump-gate back to their respective solar systems.' Gliese 876-c, Red Dwarf in Constellation Aquarius Distance from Sun: 15.4 Light Years Right Ascension: 22 53 15.6 Declination: -14 15 40 Spectral Type: M4 V Apparent Magnitude: 10.17 Mass: 1.89 Solar Masses Radius: -1 Solar Radii I know that Gliese 876-c has a wobble. WHICH MEANS IT HAS PLANETS. It has planets and apparently Gliese 876-c is where J-Rod actually transferred his home base to in order to get more easily to earth. And it's maybe 15 to 16 light years from earth. In other words, it's closer (than Zeta Reticulii which is 37.5 light years from earth). But I understand it's not a planet that is, in our terms, habitable. So, they must have made an artificial habitat of some kind there. J-Rods Trying To Alter Earth Time Line"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"According to Dr. Burisch, the EBENs are here to try to alter our time lines, our future. The reason for this is that they, according to him as fantastic as it sounds, they travel in time. So, they already know, or they know as a memory, what happened here. There is a coming catastrophe that drastically reduces the population of the earth and splits the earth into two populations and these two populations isolated from each other evolve from what we know as Homo sapiens into two different species. ARE YOU SAYING THAT THEY KNOW FROM OUR PAST TIME LINE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ASTEROID AND COMETARY DESTRUCTIONS OF THIS EARTH AND THEY HAVE GONE INTO THE FUTURE AND THEY SEE ANOTHER SIMILAR DESTRUCTION? What I'm saying is that they evolved in our future, according to the Doctrine of the Convergent Time Lines. In other words, they come from our future and they have traveled backwards to our past - or our current present. THEY ARE COMING BACK BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO PREVENT SOME TYPE OF CATASTROPHE? They are trying to alter the time line, yes. Apparently, whatever genetic traits this J-Rod inherited, they are suffering from some kind of defective gene which has caused neural degeneration in their system or what Dr. Burisch calls a \"peripheral neuropathy.\" In fact, Dan was given the task of looking into the possibility of genetic reverse engineering to repair the Eben's degenerate system. IS THE IMPLICATION THAT IF THEY CAME INTO THE HOMO SAPIENS FUTURE AT SOME POINT IN THE FAR DISTANCE, THAT THEY ARE NOW REACHING BACK INTO OUR GENETIC BLOODLINES FOR GENETIC MATERIAL THAT THEY THINK MIGHT HELP THEM IN SOME WAY ? From what I understand, they are an altered form, a new species, that branched off Homo sapiens . IN WHAT WAS A CATASTROPHE OF WHAT WE WOULD CALL OUR FUTURE? Ye s . DID DAN BURISCH HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT THE CATASTROPHE IS IN THE COMING FUTURE? He cannot specifically say what occurred. However, he places it as happening approximately a decade from now. Global Catastrophe and Human Depopulation in 2012? IN THAT 2012 TIME PERIOD THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE END OF THE MAYAN GRAND CALENDAR? Yes. But it is not rigidly fixed. It could happen any time between now and then, or even a little past that time. I'm not certain whether it is something that is an instant cataclysmic event of some kind. I have no idea. But of course, all of this is subject to - we're going to find out one way or another. If we do have one of these catastrophes, that means they did not succeed in altering the time line, right? But if it does not occur, we can say either the information was false, which of course skeptics will say instantly. Or we can say they did succeed in their program of altering the time lines and averting a catastrophe. AVERTING A CATASTROPHE, IF I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'VE SAID, WOULD ESSENTIALLY KILL OFF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR PARTICULAR SPECIES LINE AT LEAST IN A TIME LINE THAT THE EARTH WOULD CONTINUE ON. BECAUSE IF THERE IS NO CATASTROPHE, THERE WOULD BE NO BRANCHING OFF THAT WOULD"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"HAVE PRODUCED THE SPECIES COMING BACK TO AVERT THE CATASTROPHE? The thing is that there are groups of humans - who these groups are, I don't know - who survived by going underground. IN THIS ALLEGED FUTURE CATASTROPHE. Exactly, to shelter themselves from the effects of the catastrophe. J-Rods, A Homo sapiens Species From The Future Now Moved Out To Zeta Reticulii 1 and 2, Gliese 876-c and Epsilon Orionis? YOU'RE SAYING THAT THESE UNDERGROUND EVOLVING SPECIES ARE WHAT BECAME THE J-RODS THAT ENDED UP ON ZETA RETICULII 1 AND 2 AND THE OTHER SYSTEMS? Yes. That's according to what Dr. Dan Burisch recalls reading in the briefing document. THAT'S WHY THERE WOULD BE SOME COMMON DENOMINATOR TO GENETIC MATERIAL ON THE EARTH AND WHY IT WOULD BE VALUABLE TO THEM? Exactly. And that would explain why the Greys are attempting hybridization and gat h erin g gen et ic mat erial . IN YOUR MIND, ARE GREY BEINGS ONE AND THE SAME AS THE J-ROD SPECIES? J-Rod is at least one species of grey type being. I believe because of other descriptions, that there are other extraterrestrial types as well. SO THESE EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES THAT HAVE BEEN AT LOS ALAMOS AND AREA 51 AND WHO KNOWS WHERE ELSE, THEY WOULD BE COMFORTABLE BEING HERE IN THE SENSE THAT WHATEVER WORK THEY DO TO HELP US WOULD BE MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL TO THEM AND US IN SOME FAR FLUNG FUTURE? Exactly. That would explain their motives for what they do. The explanation for why it is kept so secret is, I guess, you just don't want to announce to the world at large that we're headed toward some kind of future catastrophe and unless we avert this catastrophe, a large percentage of the population is going to be eradicated. I mean, you just don't want to tell people that. Worldwide Animal Mutilations HOW WOULD ANIMAL MUTILATIONS PLAY INTO ALL OF THIS? The only thing I could determine is that there is something in the (food) formula that these Greys use because they no longer ingest food through their mouth and take it through the alimentary canal to digest it. Instead, they absorb the nutrients through their skin. NOW, IS THIS SOMETHING DAN BURISCH HAS CONFIRMED HE HAS KNOWLEDGE OF? Yes, in fact, he even gave me a name for the process. I don't recall what it was. SO, THIS OLD STORY FROM THE 1980s ABOUT A GREY SPECIES OF NON-HUMANS PAINTING THEIR SKINS WITH BLOOD AND TISSUE FROM ANIMALS TO ABSORB IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE TRUE, ACCORDING TO DR. DAN BURISCH?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Yes. Not only Dan Burisch, but other sources have given me this very same information - including a retired Marine Sergeant who was active in crash retrievals. WHAT DID HE SAY? He said the same thing, but he called it 'osmosis.' When I mentioned osmosis to Dan who is a microbiologist, he said, 'That is not exactly the process.' Then he gave it a name. I'm sorry I wasn't prepared and did not write it down because it was technical. I'll have to ask him again. IS IT YOUR IMPRESSION FROM THE MILITARY MAN AND DAN BURISCH THAT THE COLLECTING, OR HARVESTING, OF THE TISSUE AND FLUID FROM ANIMALS AROUND THE WORLD FOR HALF A CENTURY OR MORE IS A KIND OF FOOD GATHERING PROCESS FOR THESE BEINGS? Apparently. The hemoglobin is used in that formula that they use for nutrition. THAT THEY PUT ON THEIR SKIN. Right. THIS WOULD BE ANOTHER REASON WHY THESE EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITIES COULD NOT MIX WITH HUMAN CIVILIZATION VERY EASILY. That's true! Also, at least the J-Rod kind needs to breathe a different atmosphere. AT LOS ALAMOS AND AREA 51, THEY HAD A DIFFERENT ATMOSPHERE TO LIVE IN? They have these special (YY-II) facilities to house them, environmental facilities. Even EBE 2 was kept in a special environmental facility. J-Rod Upset At Being A \"Captive\" In S-4, Papoose Mountain Range Dan Burisch had an incident in which he entered the environmental sphere one time. He was supposed to go through a protocol and raise his right hand and say, 'I am a friendly human being who has come to conduct this procedure,' and then state what the procedure was. He thought that was silly because he was already in communication with the J-Rod before entering the sphere. Well, one time he entered this sphere and J-Rod came up and kind of grabbed him. Dan was in a suit with hoses coming out of the suit. DAN IS SUITED UP BECAUSE HE IS GOING INTO THIS UNUSUAL AT M O S P H E R E T H AT J - R O D L I V E S I N ? Right. And J-Rod grabbed him and circled his long arms around Dan's suit (apparently upset at being a 'captive\" in S-4?)"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Drawing by Dan Burisch, Ph.D., of J-Rod suddenly encircling the microbiologist with his long arms inside the special environmental sphere inside the Papoose Mountain S-4 facility. Many images and thoughts flooded Dr. Burisch's mind until he lost consciousness. Some of those thoughts were \"Look into the eyes of your own brother.\" \"A new heaven, a new earth?\" \"Find love.\" The residue of the experience in Dr. Burisch's mind was J-Rod's frustration at being held a \"captive\" by a \"brother\" human, linked through past, present and future time lines. When J-Rod does that and is in that close contact with Dan, Burisch starts to lose awareness of his surroundings because his mind is being flooded with images. As images flood his mind, at some point he passed out. DOES HE REMEMBER WHAT THE IMAGES WERE? He has attempted to draw them, but unfortunately he's not the artist that Bill Uhouse was. He has attempted to make drawings of these images. WHAT WERE THEY? One was an image of J-Rod as he perceives himself and calls himself a 'captive.' Then there were other scenes that would be seen in an off-world environment. One scene looked like a spacecraft. These were all jumbled up together along with some thoughts. One of the thoughts he strongly got was, 'You are looking at the face of your brother!' YOU ARE LOOKING AT THE FACE OF YOUR BROTHER. Right. AND THAT MEANS DAN BURISCH TO J-ROD. It was overwhelming, apparently. Dan collapsed from either exhaustion or whatever debilitating state he was in from this encounter. WHEN HE WOKE UP, WHERE WAS HE? I guess they had removed him from the sphere and he was in the infirmary or whatever they have there. They do have quarters that people can stay in (at S-4, Papoose Mountain, Groom Lake near Area 51 and Nellis AFB, Nevada.) Current Relationship Between EBEN J-Rods and Earth Humans WE'RE TALKING NOW IN OCTOBER 2002, DO YOU HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT J-ROD IS STILL WORKING WITH OUR SCIENTISTS INSIDE OF THE PAPOOSE MOUNTAIN FACILITY AND AT LOS ALAMOS AND PERHAPS OTHER LOCATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY? No, because in November 1994, EBE 3's visit came to an end. EBE 3 took the assistant J-Rod from Los Alamos and was to take the one from Papoose and return to home planet, now Gliese. What happened is that EBE 3 left with only"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"one J-Rod and the one (at Papoose) was held back for further studies, I guess. Whatever this agreement is, the negotiated agreement, is up for renewal, according to Dan, next year. It's renewed every 9 years. So, EBE 3 is due to return next year to renegotiate the contract or agreement. But since the J-Rod was left here for further study and considers himself captive and not free to come and go, I am just wondering what will happen when he (EBE 3) does return? YES. Now, there are only a few of these that are working with our secret government here and the rest go about their own business. They don't even cooperate with our government. MEANING FROM YOUR KNOWLEDGE, THAT THERE ARE OTHER EXTRATERRESTRIAL ENTITIES THAT ARE NOT AT ALL INVOLVED WITH THE J-ROD/EBEN EFFORT TO ADJUST TIME LINES AND TO AVERT SOME ANNIHILATION IN THE FUTURE AND SAVE OURSELVES AND THEMSELVES? They (others) are going on their own agendas, even if they are among the J-Rods themselves. What I'm saying, the greater population of these J-Rod entities does NOT associate or cooperate with our government. Perhaps it is for this reason that our government is worried about what they may do, what their plan is because what we're not intimately associated with, we can't control. I can just say that I don't know what the political organization is that these J-Rods have, what the nature of it, or how they negotiate these agreements or why there are those who do not agree. All of these are big question marks. 2003, 2012 and the Committee of the Majority (MJ-12) 2003 IS A BIG QUESTION MARK ABOUT WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT? Yes. There is something significant about 2003, according to other sources that I have, but I have not been able to determine what that significance is. Also, trying to sort out all this information, I do not assume that the information I gather is misinformation unless it shows up as falsified. I just assume that it is information that may be true or false and only further analysis and time will tell. Some of this makes sense. That's the part that gets to me. There is an intimate relationship here with the human race because they are related to us, makes sense. ARE THE PEOPLE OR OFFICE IN CHARGE OF OVERSEEING HIS WORK (BURISCH) AND REQUISITIONING EVERYTHING HE NEEDS AS A SCIENTIST RELATED TO MJ-12? Yes, but it goes up the actual authority that he gets approval from, he calls the Committee of the Majority. THE COMMITTEE OF THE MAJORITY? Right. DOES HE REFER TO THEM AS MAJORITY 12? No. When he refers to Majestic, he just calls them Majestic. HE DOES KNOW MJ-12 AS A WORKING ACRONYM? Yes. And on his badge was 'MAJI.' WHO DOES HE PERCEIVE THAT MAJI REPORTS TO? The top authority that he reports to are the members of the Committee of the Majority. But the top independent person, individual, that he used to report to"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"back in the early 1990s was this Vice Admiral J. M. McConnell who was head of the NSA. HEAD OF THE NSA. Right. WHERE DID MC CONNELL GO? He retired and went into civilian life. He does various types of security work. That's where an ex-NSA guy goes. Bill Hamilton Note: \"According to Dan, the officer he reported to was then Vice Adm. J.M. McConnell who was recently the Director of NSA. He is now retired into civilian life. Vice Adm. J. M. McConnell, Director, National Security Agency (NSA), 1992 to 1996. Mr. McConnell joined Booz·Allen in March 1996 after serving as Director, National Security Agency (NSA), the agency responsible for Signals Intelligence and for all Classified Information Security for the U.S. Government. In addition to serving as Director of NSA, a position he held from 1992 to 1996, Mr. McConnell served as the Intelligence Officer for the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS-J2) during the dissolution of the Soviet Union and Operation DESERT STORM. While serving on the Joint Staff, Mr. McConnell regularly briefed the President and his Cabinet Officers, international leaders, and the Senate and House of the U.S. Congress. He also appeared regularly on international television as the U.S. Intelligence Spokesman during the Gulf War. He achieved the rank of Vice Admiral in the U.S. Navy, where he spent more than 25 years as an Operational Intelligence Officer.\" ANY FINAL WORDS FROM EITHER OF THESE MEN CONCERNING WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IN 2003 AND NINE YEARS LATER IN 2012? No, I haven't. I've asked Dan directly what he thought might happen and he said he doesn't know. All he could tell me was that from what he had learned and again, it wasn't first hand knowledge. I guess it was just something that he read from documents, that EBE 3 was scheduled to return in 2003 because they followed this nine year cycle that was somehow important to them. Like there were nine craft in the mountain. This number nine is somehow significant to them. 2012 is the termination point of another 9 year cycle. So, we're going according to their cycle of nine, according to Dan. But other than that return and renewal of this agreement they have, he did not know what else is planned. Although I have heard from another source that one of the things that is planned is possibly an announcement made by either members of the United Nations or leaders of religion, that there are extraterrestrials here. Again, I have no way of evaluating this is stuff that has kind of flown around and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"don't know if it's misinformation or really is an acclimatization program underway. If there is, why is there I don't know. IF THERE IS A CYCLE OF NINE, IT MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE LENGTH OF TIME THAT IT TAKES TO GO FROM WHEREVER THEY ARE TO WHEREVER WE ARE. Yes. I don't know what it's tied to, except it's tied to some kind of system they have, some kind of system that they pay attention to that deals with cycles of time. THEY CYCLE IN AND OUT OF THE EARTH EVERY NINE YEARS? I don't know how to answer that, except that EBE 3 left nine years ago in 1994. Mars and Blond Humanoids DID EITHER DAN OR BILL UHOUSE TALK ABOUT HAVING KNOWLEDGE SPECIFICALLY OF THE J-ROD SPECIES HAVING BASES UNDERGROUND ON MARS? No. However, Dan mentioned another type of being who was on Mars, but went elsewhere. Their home is not there. Their home is close to Epsilon Orionis. These are described as the tall blonds, the Nordic types. But he has never met one, he's just read about them. DAN BURISCH HAS READ ABOUT THE BLONDS IN HIS WORK IN THE PAPOOSE MOUNTAINS? Ye s . DID HE CHARACTERIZE ANYTHING ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE TALL BLONDS AND THE J-ROD TYPE? They are just another branch that has evolved from Homo sapiens , but they went along the spiritual evolutionary path, according to him. SO, DAN BURISCH SEES ANY EXTRATERRESTRIAL INVOLVEMENT WITH EARTH NOW AS VARIOUS BLOODLINE BRANCHES FROM HOMO SAPIENS AND THEY ARE BACK HERE BECAUSE OF SOME TERRIBLE PROBLEM IN THE FUTURE? Yes. But he admitted to me that his knowledge of extraterrestrial races is limited, very limited. the only extraterrestrial entity that he encountered was this J-Rod. He said he believes that there are other races out there. In fact, I have two independent sources which have mentioned the figures 167 and 169, so close together. I thought this was highly coincidental. OF VARIOUS TYPES OF SPECIES OR CIVILIZATIONS? Ye s . WAS THERE ANY CHARACTERIZATION BY DAN BURISCH OF THE GOVERNMENT'S RELATIONSHIP TO THE TALL BLONDS? No, he was not privy to that information. He had no need to know. IF THE BLONDS WERE ON MARS ONCE, WHERE DID THEY GO AND WHY DID THEY LEAVE? They went to Epsilon Orionis and I don't know why. (Middle star in Orion's Belt) THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE THERE. HOW FAR IS THAT FROM ZETA RETICULII I AND II? I haven't looked that up."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":" How Could EBE J-Rods and Blond Humanoids Change Earth's Time Line? CAN YOU ELABORATE ON WHATEVER DAN BURISCH'S UNDERSTANDING IS ABOUT THE CYCLES OF TIME AND HOW BEINGS THAT WERE SOME EXTENSION OF HOMO SAPIENS BLOOD LINES FAR IN THE FUTURE COULD COME BACK AND TRY TO CHANGE OUR PRESENT TIME LINES? About the only thing he said was that he understood that the Nordic Blonds and these J-Rods met and had decided they were going to attempt to change their history because they had now learned how to travel in time and travel backwards in time to some point that I would estimate is in our distant past. (Or 2012?) Again, we're talking about this fantastic subject of time travel and what it does to reality. And it's very complicated. A lot of scientists have toyed with these ideas and the paradoxes it presents. What I have studied are anecdotal stories of people who have found themselves some how displaced into the past. This is something not studied by the scientists, because they are always talking faster than light travel, worm holes, the theory of relativity, and that kind of time travel, using a time machine of some kind. But I'm talking about a spontaneous paraphysical events that happen to people that they report. An event would be like someone decides to go on a vacation with their entire family. They stop at a restaurant and everything in the restaurant people are dressed like way back in the 1950s. The service is great, the food is great. Then the bill comes and it's only maybe $10 or $12 for six of them. And they go 'Huh? How can this be?' They happily pay it and leave and decide to return on a trip to that same restaurant and find out there is no restaurant. Rumor has it there was a restaurant there 20 years ago and it burned to the ground. Well, what happened?! I mean, their recollection is that they had this physical happening. RIGHT, AND IT IS AS IF THERE ARE THESE THREADS WOVEN JUST LIKE WE WOULD THINK OF A BRAID WITH ALL OF THESE MULTIPLE PIECES OF HAIR, EACH HAIR BEING A TIME LINE. WHAT INTRIGUES ME IS: IF YOU REACH A POINT IN TECHNOLOGY WHERE YOU CAN MATCH OR EXCEED THE SPEED OF LIGHT AND BEGIN TO MOVE IN TIME, WHAT CAN YOU ACCOMPLISH BY COMING BACK INTO YOUR DISTANT PAST, WHICH IS WHAT THESE NON-HUMANS ARE SAYING THEY ARE DOING NOW IN ORDER TO AVERT A CATASTROPHE IN THE FUTURE? HOW DO YOU DO THAT? I don't know. But they have knowledge of what happens. They have greater knowledge and apparently, they have a plan. That's the only thing I can think of. They have a plan in which they are going to try to change something and interfere with our time line so as to avert a catastrophe. HAS DAN BURISCH SAID ANYTHING ABOUT THE MIDDLE EAST AS BEING INTIMATELY INVOLVED WITH ALL OF THESE EFFORTS OF CHANGING TIME LINES? No, he has not. WE COULD BE SITTING ON THE PRECIPICE OF SOME KIND OF NUCLEAR WAR IN AND AROUND IRAQ WHICH COULD SOME HOW BE GERMANE TO EVERYTHING WE'RE TALKING ABOUT? That's a possibility I cannot dismiss. We all have more questions than the answers that have been supplied so far, I know that. I still have questions. DID DAN BURISCH HIMSELF SEEM TO BE CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT IT ALL MEANT?"},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"He did not seem to be totally knowledgeable. This was all something he said he read in briefing documents and could discuss occasionally with some of his fellow workers. It wasn't like he had any direct knowledge of the whole scheme of things. He would state that it fascinates him, but can only discuss with any certainty those things he has direct knowledge about in his work.\" Continued in Part 3.
