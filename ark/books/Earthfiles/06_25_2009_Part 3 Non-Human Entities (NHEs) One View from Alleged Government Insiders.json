The second floppy disc contained the following five pages from the two men who had originally contacted Ray Boeche and showed identification from the Department of Defense in Washington, D. C. The Christian religious context of this reply by the Writers might relate more to their upbringing than hard, objective facts about non-human entities (NHEs), but personal background details are unknown. Content in Real X-Files at Earthfiles.com is presented for consideration in a wide range of phenomena and interpretations, not as proven fact. "},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" C ontinued in Part 4.
