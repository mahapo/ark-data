J une 22, 2006 State of Nuevo Leon, Mexico - On June 4, 2006, around 5 p.m. amid the water lilies growing thick in the reservoir water at the Sombreretillo Dam, Dr. Efren Saucedo Tello took photographs of kayakers going by. Later when he looked at his photographs closely, he was stunned to see what looked like a large and very black \"creature\" standing in the water as if watching one of the kayaks. Around the very black entity is another odd shape that is beige-colored. I talked by phone this week with Mexico City phenomena investigator, Professor Ana Luisa Cid, who also provided the following information to Scott Corrales, editor and English translator of Inexplicata, The Journal of Hispanic Ufology. \"SOURCE: Ana Luisa Cid, Ph.D. DATE: 06.17.06 MEXICO: STRANGE BEING IN SOMBRERETILLO DAM? A photograph taken at the Sombreretillo Dam in the state of Nuevo Leon. Photograph provided by Dr. Efren Sauceda Tello, taken on June 4, 2006. Dr. Te llo: \"On Sunday, June 4, I went fishing in the reservoir at the dam accompanied by my cousin, Jose E. Garcia. We arrived there at 2:30 p.m. and I brought my Canon Powershot A-95 along with me. \"At around 5 p.m., w e got ready to head back home, so we put things in my boat. Since we were in the southern region of the dam where aquatic lilies are in abundance, there's no way of getting through that is not by boat. \"When we left the dam, there were people getting ready to board their kayaks and it occurred to me to take a photo from that location. I saw nothing unusual until I checked the computer and noticed that in one of the photos, something similar to a creature in black could be seen, watching the people in the boat.\" "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I n the 1:23 between the first photograph at 17:12:27 on the left and the second photograph at 17:13:04 on the right, the black entity and surrounding beige-colored structure have disappeared.
