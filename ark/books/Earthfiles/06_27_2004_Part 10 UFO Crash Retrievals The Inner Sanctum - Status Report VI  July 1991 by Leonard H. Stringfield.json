Click here to see Part 1 of Status Report VI Len Stringfield: \"To begin my comments concerning Dr. Epigoni's disclosures, during Ron's earlier interview of April 11, 1990, I must say that his secret work as a physicist did not give him a need-to-know access to details of the alien anatomy or behavior. Like other areas inside the Inner Sanctum, the medical exploratory phase is also compartmentalized so that no two specialists would know the whole A-to-Z story of the alien creature's biostructure. To me, Epigoni's disclosure of the UFOs alleged landings at military bases is more than of passing interest. Perhaps, as Ron and I speculated, some of the '40 to 50 landings' might have been staged to test the skills of recruits, but whatever the actual number of landings, the incongruity of him being witness to almost human-like crews with noses, ears and teeth is a physiological factor not in keeping with the stereotyped little grays retrieved at crash-sites and encountered in most abduction cases. Suspended animation? Dr. Epigoni is not too clear about this marvel - a subject not too far out in space technology. However, it is difficult to rationalize a purpose to land in that condition, exposed to capture and knowing they would be at the mercy of the human race. Surely, Epigoni is omitting important retrieval details from the time of their landing to exhibition in an atmospherically controlled room. Then there is the question of the alien biology. My curiosity is not only aroused by Epigoni's brown biped with teeth, but mainly - hoping to get his inside view of the ubiquitous humanoid with grayish reptilian skin and big head. Are both the inhabitants of one or more than one world? Are they both clones or androids? If so, who's the 'boss?' Several remarks posed by Epigoni might show his knowledge or insight. In one response to Ron, he spoke of teeth, but said that he could not tell if they were growing (naturally) or made. He also spoke of feeling the ribs and he wondered if they were real bone or metal or something else. Then he remarked, 'If you could make people like that and give them guns and send them off to war instead of solder is.' Was what he saw a robot? Whatever the answer might be, I hasten to add that there are other reliable sources of my acquaintance who know of the existence of at least one live alien in custody. If my private sources are correct - and I have reason to believe them - that live aliens have been in custody and secretly isolated for interrogation or to exchange information, then it is reasonable to believe Epigoni's story of landings with entities in a state of suspended animation. Landings at, or near, military installations? I have many reports, some believable, some questionable. I have cited cases in my previous status reports to name a few: Ft. Riley, an Army base in Kansas, 1964; Nellis AFB, Nevada, 1968; Big Springs, a secret base in Texas, 1968; and at the complex of Fort Dix Army Base and McGuire AFB in New Jersey, 1978. My most credible, firsthand source to witness a landed saucer was an Air Force officer who later became an astronaut making flights in the Mercury and Gemini programs. During one of our many chats on UFOs in the 1970s, he told me that in May 1957, while stationed at Edwards AFB, he was in charge of a film crew on assignment to shoot movie footage of a certain area when he spotted a landed saucer with windows and tripods about a quarter of a mile from his vehicle. 'We got 445 stills and good movie coverage of it,' he said. 'But I "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"never got to see it on the screen. Intelligence took charge and dispatched it to Washington, D. C.' Others might know his name as different versions of the incident circulated among researchers. In my case, I had promised him I would not publish his name. Ron and I discussed the Epigoni disclosures on several occasions. Needless to say, I was curious about the human-like alien with teeth and even more curious what his source knew about the little grays, without teeth. Another interview was conducted which produced the following provocative answers: Ron Madeley Further Interview with Dr. Epigoni: 'Q. You had mentioned that when you were with Blue Heaven, you had seen some type of bodies that they had there. The description that I recall you saying was that they were more or less like humans. A. Yeah. Q. I am curious what you think about some of the descriptions that people have given where they have seen similar vehicles, but different bodies. The bodies are often described as about 4 feet all, have large hairless head, no visible nose or ears. A. Well, they've never verified any of those, you see. This thing is verified. Q. How do you account for those stories then from people who have seen them on military bases and so forth? A. Well, as far as those were concerned, a lot of those were acted up - the uh, higher echelon went to an island and they had to make some decision about how to keep everyone from finding out what was really going on. The government itself has a special department for that now, to help the military handle it. Q. What's the name of that? A. I don't know! It's in Washington, D. C. It's been set up in the last six months. Q. To deal specifically with? A. With 'foreign matter,' and UFOs and things like that. And they just set that up within the last six months. It might have been eight months, six to eight months ago. (RM Note: Late fall of 1990.) Q. And who is working with that? A. I don't know one of them and I don't want to know them. Q. What do you think that they are going to find? A. I don't know! But with these satellites out there, if there's anything out there, they'll find it. Q. What do you think, based on what you saw at Edwards AFB? What do you think that was? A. I think it was a vehicle from another planet. I saw robots. Robotic type beings. Q. How big was that vehicle that you worked on? A. About 40 feet in diameter. Well, this didn't have a glass dome in the top. It had a turret, but you couldn't see anything in through the windows. Q. What have they done with it since you quit working on it? A. Well, the last I heard, they were trying to figure out some way to get that turret open and get in that way. That door that opens below that let those guys out and closed, there is no way those guys (USAF) will get in there. You could take your fingernail up and drag it real slow and find the seam, but nevertheless ... Q. I think I remember you telling me that it landed at Edwards AFB. A. Well, it landed northwest of the base in a flat part there and that door opened and the guys walked out and laid down on the ground and the door closed. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Q. They stood there or laid there? A. Laid there. Q. How many of them were there? A. Four. There might still be some inside it. Undoubtedly these four were (had been). Q. How did it get to Edwards AFB? A. They moved it. The Air Force moved it. Q. How long was it between the time that it landed and when the Air Force found it? A. Well, they saw it land, so it was not far from the base. They scratched it up, I can tell you that much! The legs didn't go back up in it. There were no wheels on the legs, so you had to drag the damn thing. Q. What was the reason for using the code name? A. I don't know. My understanding is that the name goes back to WWII.' Stringfield: \"Dr. Epigoni, without explanation, has made obvious changes in his story. Instead of 12 aliens taken captive who were in a suspended state of animation, he switched to four; instead of a glass-top dome on the craft, it became a turret. I discussed this matter of discrepancy with Ron and we agreed that it appears that he had consulted with his superiors and was advised to alter certain key details. But the strongest evidence that Epigoni had been in recent communication with somebody in an authoritative position is in his disclosure that an office had been set up in the past six to eight months whose purpose is to 'make a decision how to keep everyone from finding out what is really going on.' If this is true, then the big news is that Dr. Epigoni's remaining disclosures might be basically true and allowed to be published uncensored with official blessing. Like Chicken Little's 'skies that fell down,' my assumptions might also fall, but there is a possibility that some of the Epigoni revelations might be one of the 'breaches' from the other side of the wall, controlled by the Inner Sanctum. Time will tell. THE CRASH AT FARMINGTON (NEW MEXICO) At the expense of being repetitious, the frequency and unspecific locations of some UFO crashes and/or landings in New Mexico and environs in the post-WWII era can be confusing. Even allowing for disinformation leaking out a faked case, there are too many sources with pieces of correlative information to dismiss the postulate that saucer-like craft at that time were 'up to something' and at the same time were crashing or landing for unknown reasons. While Roswell has been the umbrella for most of these events, the least talked about was Aztec, the site of a crash promoted by Frank Scully in his blockbuster book Behind the Flying Saucers , published in 1950. But Scully's fame and his shocking revelations soon became a shambles. Investigation, which exposed the shady status of some of his informants, was enough for the myopic lords of research and the media at that time. Without looking any further into the incident, (they) declared Aztec a hoax. The case laid dormant for years, along with rumors of other crashes. In fact, it was an indignity to even discuss the subject among researchers so thorough was the Aztec stigma. Then in 1986, William Steinman of La Mirada, California - admittedly obsessed by the Aztec affair and its loose ends ignored by research - resurrected new interest when he published UFO Crash at Aztec. Having written the Foreword for his book, even though I had some reservations about the crash, I did expect an eventual positive response from new sources if the case had merit. Nothing. Among researchers, a few were impressed by the volume of evidence that Steinman had amassed which he had hoped to lend credibility to the event. But most were still convinced that Scully was duped by scoundrels. A year later in 1987, the mood among UFOlogists suddenly turned. For Roswell, it was good; for Aztec, hopeless. Bill Moore, one of Steinman's loudest critics, was reaching new heights of acclaim for his dramatic disclosures of documents about MJ-12 and their support for Roswell. I remember when he spellbound a large audience as guest speaker during dinnertime at the MUFON Symposium in Washington, D. C. announcing hopes for a"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"breakthrough soon. Again, hopes were dashed. The breakthrough never happened. Curious about the dearth of information about Aztec - unless indeed, it were a hoax or a will-of-the-wisp - I made some probes of my own. On October 4, 1987, I phoned Gabe Valdez of Dulce, New Mexico, described as a law enforcement officer of impeccable character, asking what he knew about the crash from firsthand sources. Valdez was known to research, having been involved in the investigation of cattle mutilations - some tied in with UFO activity. Yes, he had heard about the Aztec crash in 1948 and said he had talked with two people about two years before who claimed to have firsthand knowledge of it. One was an 87-year-old gentleman, he said, who remembered news of the crash first reported to be that of an airplane. As a witness to a flatbed truck that hauled it away, Valdez said, he also recalled an officer (not sure whether Air Force or Army) who advised him to 'keep quiet.' The other person, a native of Aztec according to Valdez, was a 65-year-old lady who heard about the saucer crash and recalls seeing military people busy in the area. Valdez said he had the old gentleman's name marked down somewhere and would let me know if he found it so that I could call him for firsthand details. I called Valdez twice to check and he never called back after that. End of Aztec. But it was not the end of New Mexico crashes. For the enrichment of our chronicle, a new site for a crash is introduced allegedly occurring near Farmington, a small town about 25 miles southeast of Aztec. The source is Chuck Oldham of Lansdowne, Pennsylvania, a professional business person who shares the challenges of UFO research with his wife, Vicky, also a professional person in another endeavor. Chuck's information about this crash came initially by phone in the fall of 1990 (by a person) who preferred at that time not to reveal the location and many other details. In February 1991, I called Chuck and announced that I was planning to publish Status Report VI and asked if I could include his prized material He agreed, conditionally, on the approval of his source, a former military officer with high security clearance. The Oldham's report which I received May 30, 1991, with illustrations, is an obvious product of professionalism. Included was a photograph of a clay bust of a hypothetical alien head they had modeled from a composite of reports and a computerized depiction of the saucer that had crashed at Farmington. Chuck regretted, however, that he was limited in revealing certain details which might compromise his source's identity. The Oldham report, copyrighted, is published as follows verbatim: Computer simulation, based on memory of a military officer who alleges he saw a photograph of a crashed saucer at a military base library open only to personnel with Top Secret access clearances. Chuck Oldham's interview with the unidentified officer and drawings which relate to the craft's basic structure are also included in this report. Report About Alleged Farmington, New Mexico UFO Crash © 1991 by Chuck and Vicky Oldham 'We are releasing this report in the attempt to reduce the imbalance of information available to those researchers involved in pursuing the facts surrounding CRASH/RETRIEVALS. It is not our intent to dispute the research uncovered by other independent investigators. With so little access to the big picture, we must not assume that similar accounts necessarily refer to the same event. Some early researchers uncovered a crash case and assumed that other accounts of crashes must have been misidentifications of one specific event. After all, a logical argument would support the premise that any being technologically advanced enough to visit us from a different solar system would be invulnerable to such catastrophic"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"miscalculation. With this in mind, we would like to draw attention to some of the details conveyed by our witness that are remarkably similar to details in other accounts of UFO crashes. Firstly, the government file seen by our witness refers to many crashes ; secondly, it describes a peculiar break in the porthole of the recovered craft. (This craft is the subject of our report.) The same type of break has been described in past reports about craft recovered from other locations. There could be many reasons why such a specific description of the porthole break is a feature found in other UFO crash reports. It is possible that publicly reported details from early retrievals were intentionally shuffled to protect the sources of the information. Additionally, the intelligence community might have contributed to this process. Whenever classified information surfaces, the pattern of the information released indicates the source of the leak; consequently, governments maintain effective control over this subject. If many of the retrieved craft exhibited the same kind of pin-hole break, it could be the result of some defect in the porthole material; maybe it's the characteristic puncture inflicted by some exotic weapon of extraterrestrial war. Perhaps we will come to realize, in spite of the existence of technologically advanced beings, that achievement of perfection is an elusive standard everywhere. We feel that this introduction would not be complete without adding that we strongly support other independent researchers that have expressed their dissatisfaction with official positions regarding the continued withholding of information about UFOs. This responsibility lies squarely on world leadership. Of their mismanagement of this and other aspects of world governing, we state: manipulation of the truth is a poor substitute for leadership and a weak strategy for the future survival of mankind. The only way we can forge ahead is to have clarity of purpose; the only way to attain this clarity is with a true vision of what we are, as a species, in relationship to the universe. The interview took place with a witness who was a former military officer. While serving in the military, he had a special security clearance that enabled him to access a restricted library (prior to 1970). Due to the highly sensitive nature of the information and possible risk to this individual, no information is provided which could be used to identify him or the location of the base. The following conversation is not written down verbatim, but was compiled over the course of four separate sessions. Q. What was the occasion in which you viewed documents concerning crashed saucers? A. While I was stationed at this particular base, I had a special assignment which afforded me ample free time. The materials library was available to those officers with a designated security clearance and I had the appropriate clearance. I was passing time in the library and I discovered a file on the subject of an alien craft and its dead occupants that had been retrieved. The file contained a report, a separate black and white photograph (of the craft) and a book by Major Donald Keyhoe.'\" Continued in Part 11. Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
