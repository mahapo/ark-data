Another mystery was a large, nearly perfectly round ice circle discovered on December 28th at Mud Lake near Horton. The ice circle was probably created by Nature, but a local resident saw a bright light over the lake. As recently as Saturday, February 7, and three nights before on February 4, a Jackson, Michigan, resident videotaped unidentified objects and sent me copies of the tapes to see. The man is a professional who works in computer technology support and has asked that I not use his real name. He asked me to call him \"John.\" John is 36-years-old and has lived in Jackson, Michigan, all his life. He remembers seeing bizarre diamond-shaped, oval-shaped and triangular-shaped craft and large orange lights back in 1992 when there was a UFO flap over Napoleon. But he hasn't seen any strange aerial lights since then until now. He and other residents from the Napoleon, Horton, Litchfield area of Michigan south of Jackson have repeatedly seen unidentified lights. In John's videotape, a very bright light that seems somewhat stationary begins the sequence of events that went from 9 p.m. to about 9:50 p.m. EST. Interview: John (pseudonym), Information Technology Support Professional, Jackson, Michigan: \"I HAVE SEEN FROM BEGINNING TO END THE VIDEOTAPE YOU TOOK ON FEBRUARY 7 ON SATURDAY. I WONDER IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN FROM THE BEGINNING HOW THAT BEGAN BECAUSE YOU WERE CLEARLY VIDEOTAPING SOMETHING THAT IS EXTRAORDINARY AND DOES NOT EASILY FIT INTO KNOWN AIRCRAFT. Right. I left my apartment and I was going to turn east and go into town to see a friend and I was going to stop at an ATM machine on the way. But as soon as I got to the street that connects with my apartment's parking lot, where I would normally go left, I ended up looking to the right for traffic. In the sky was this really brilliant at first I took it to be a star because that was the first thing that I think of when I see a light in the sky is a star. But it was very bright. I would say three times brighter than Venus at least and much bigger. The light seemed to have a core area of brightness and then the light dimmed as it went out sort of like a halo around it. At that point, I backed up my truck, parked it, and went inside my apartment, got my camcorder, went back out to my truck, went to the same spot at the end of the parking lot and looked and it was still there, which surprised me because if it were something unusual, I wouldn't think it would last long. But it was still there, so I took a right and headed towards the direction of the object which was the direction of the Jackson County Airport. When I got to the airport, I parked in a parking lot of a bowling alley across from the airport. I started videotaping the object which now seemed to the southwest of the bowling alley building. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Bright, white, object that on the videotape appears to be spinning very rapidly. Digital video © 2004 by John D. As I videotaped, I did have to adjust my position to keep it in sight. It seemed to be flashing at me and I didn't understand at the time what was going on or why I had to adjust my position relative to the object which seemed stationary. What ended up happening was that the object was moving slowly and I didn't realize it at the time, but there were trees in the way. There was a tree that was bare of leaves and then an evergreen sort of tree. The object was moving behind those which accounts for the flashing of the object as it passed behind the limbs. I sent you a daylight photo so you could see the bowling alley and trees and sky where the object was above. NOW IN THE VIDEOTAPE THAT I'VE SEEN THAT IS QUITE IMPRESSIVE, YOU HAVE AN OBJECT THAT IS BRIGHT, SEEMS TO CHANGE INTO A BAR OF THREE LIGHTS AND THEN ENDS UP IN A TRIANGLE. THAT OCCURRED ON THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY 7. HOW DID YOU GET THAT VIDEOTAPE? YOU WERE AT THE AIRPORT AND THEN WHAT HAPPENED? At one point, the object appeared to disappear. Above: From 9:02:31 to 9:02:47 p.m. on February 7, 2004, the unidentified bright light above the Jackson County Airport bowling alley trees was \"three times brighter than Venus.\" Below: Then at 9:02:47 p.m., the bright light suddenly dimmed almost to black and the subsequent frames show that it was still there, but so dim that to see an image, I had to raise the contrast very high.

Then two minutes later, the light appears back above the bowling alley near Jackson County, Michigan airport."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"John went back the next day on February 8, 2004, at 12:39 p.m. to photograph the bowling alley on the left and the parking lot surrounded by trees. The unidentified aerial object was in the upper left quadrant of the sky right behind some of the tree branches. Digital image © by John D. When it did that, I took off after it to try to see it again. It was going to the west. I didn't find that out until I had traveled a few minutes into the west and I saw it again over some trees and a couple minutes later, I saw it again and then I lost it. But it was the same object because it had the bright core and the halo around it. HOW DID YOU END UP DOWNTOWN WITH THE VIDEOTAPE THAT HAS THE BUILDING IN THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE FRAME? Bank in Downtown Jackson, Michigan I kept the camcorder with me as I basically to do what I originally set out to do to meet a friend and take money out of an ATM machine. My bank has a branch in the downtown area of Jackson, so I stopped at the bank and got out to use the AT M . When I got near the ATM, I noticed that there were three curious orange dots in diagonal fashion. If you think of a line 45 degrees from level ground. They were at that angle and I stared at it for about 5 seconds because I wanted to see if it was moving, if it was an airplane or something else. It was just stationary, so I assumed it was just glare off of some building or a telephone power wires. Then I went to use the ATM which took me less than a minute. When I came back out, I looked in that direction again, the three dots had moved, but they hadn't moved very far, which didn't make sense to me. If it was a plane, why wasn't it moving in the first place. Why didn't it move very far? It didn't make any sense to me. So I went back to my truck and grabbed the camcorder again and I started videotaping the object. And it was odd because the light on the left got really bright. You can see it in the videotape. Beginning at 9:48 p.m. on February 7, 2004, at a downtown Jackson, Michigan, bank, three orange lights in a straight line catch John D.'s attention over the bank building. Two of the three show up dimly in this first clear frame of the object. All digital video images © 2004 by John D."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Four seconds later, the \"tri-dot\" image had begun changing and very slowly moving. One light on the left begins getting much brighter. Seventeen seconds later, the light on the left is dim and the one on the right is getting brighter, as three lights emerge in a \"flat V\" pattern below."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The dot that was in the middle was lower, like the bottom of a flat \"V\" shape. And the light on the right was small, like the lower dot in the middle. I videotaped that for a short while as this object was crossing the sky and then I pulled back to get perspective with the building. I regret that now because what happened after that is I tried to zoom back in on it and lost it momentarily and I used my eyes at that point to sight where it was at so I could have better luck zooming in on it again with the camcorder. What I noticed then with my eyes is that the object dimmed overall: all three lights seemed to dim. The one that seemed the brightest on the left dimmed the most and they all dimmed until they were equal in brightness. And it was sort of like taking a light bulb and decreasing the power to it until it gets dimmer and dimmer. RIGHT, LIKE A RHEOSTAT. Yes. Like that. Then it seemed to rise a little and continued across the sky. I managed to see it again and followed it and it just looked like 3 small dots and I never saw any blinking lights at all, which an airplane should have blinking lights at that time of night. Unknowns Camouflaged As Known Sky Objects? I HAVE SEEN YOUR VIDEOTAPE AND AM SO GLAD THAT YOU HAVE BEEN TRYING TO CAPTURE THESE ANOMALIES OVER NAPOLEON ON VIDEOTAPE. AND THE THING THAT STRUCK ME WAS SOMETHING TRYING TO CAMOUFLAGE ITSELF IN THE SKY SO THAT MOST PEOPLE WOULD NOT PAY ATTENTION. Yes, That's the impression I get. It's sort of like they don't want to be that noticeable. But if you seem to take a notice in them, they will be noticeable. And I find it odd that as I would leave my apartment I would see this light in such a position in the sky that it would be noticeable to me because I sent you a picture of what I saw to the right a daytime picture of where I first sighted the object that ended up over the airport. You can see there is a section of the sky that to be noticed, the object would have to fit in this section of the sky. In other words, there are trees around and other objects and you couldn't see it. It was just in the right location at the right time for me to see it. And it stayed long enough for me to run into my apartment again and get my camcorder and leave again. And it seemed to be patient enough to wait until I took the longest route through all the stop signs to the airport. And then it seemed to wait around for me to park and get my camcorder ready and start videotaping and it stuck around for awhile 7, 8 or 9 minutes and I videotaped it. It just seems odd to me that I was always somehow in the right place at the right time to lead me to this thing and start videotaping it. The same thing with the second object over downtown Jackson. The lights that weren't moving I kind of get the odd feeling that they were parked there waiting"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"to be noticed and then when I ignored them and used the ATM machine and came back out, then they started moving slowly. It's almost like it was choreographed not by me, but by whatever intelligence is behind these lights. It's like if you take an interest in them, they will reveal themselves a little bit. That's just my impression. AND WHY YOU? Probably just because I'm curious and I have a camcorder and I look up. I had started paying attention again after the ice circle after you reported about that and the light associated with it. That's when I bought my camcorder and I just waited and it seemed to start with the northern Hillsdale sighting that I had. That's when all this seemed to start and it was only last Wednesday. AND SO IF YOU HAD NOT HEARD MY EARTHFILES AND RADIO REPORTS ON THE ICE CIRCLE IN HORTON, YOU WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN THE CAMERA AND YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR THESE LIGHTS? Right. Sunday night (Feb. 8) something else unusual happened. Sunday night, I got the same friend to go out into the northern Hillsdale and southern Jackson area. We drove around for I'd say an hour and a half. sometimes we parked, but we didn't see anything. We went back to where he lives in the Horton area which is not too far from the ice circle. I had made the tape at his house that I sent to you and as I was leaving, I left and he was right behind me and the first thing I saw maybe 200 yards away over a treeline, there was an orange glowing light. I said to my friend, 'They're here!' He looked and saw the same light. Then I made a move to my left and walked a couple of paces and I was going to get out my camcorder and start shooting again and it disappeared. It was just gone. I think back on it now and I sort of think whatever these lights are, they have a sense of humor because we searched over a wide area for an hour and a half or two hours looking for these lights. Then at the exact moment that we give up and I'm going home for the night, it's there. Then when I go to get my camcorder, it's gone.\" Request: If anyone in the larger Jackson, Michigan, region see or photograph any unidentified aerial objects, please e-mail: earthfiles@earthfiles.com More Information: For more information about the ongoing unidentified aerial phenomenon in Michigan, see these other Earthfiles reports: · 02/14/2004 -- More High Strangeness in the Michigan Sky · 02/06/2004 -- Unidentified Aerial Objects - Again! - Over Michigan · 01/24/2004 -- Oregon Man's Experiences with High Strangeness · 01/19/2004 -- Earthfiles and Radio Audience Feedback About Anomalous Sky Objects · 01/17/2004 -- High Strangeness in the Napoleon, Michigan Sky · 01/17/2004 -- Update on Horton, Michigan Ice Circle Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
