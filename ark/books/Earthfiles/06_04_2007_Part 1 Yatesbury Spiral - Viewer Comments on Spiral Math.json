June 4, 2007 Albuquerque, New Mexico - So many Earthfiles readers today were provoked by the Yatesbury Field spiral \"abacus\" and the single circle in the other field that seems to reinforce the importance of the number \"1\" in the spiral counting. Among the many emails was communication from Chris Steele of ICCRA (Independent Crop Circle Research Association). \"If you count the groupings (starting from the road) you have: 1,3,3,1,1,2,9,3,1,1,2,2,7,1,1,2,4,1,5,1,3,2,1. I f the “1” is denoting a break (stop/start) in the numbers, then you would have 33, 293, "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"227, 24, 5, 32. Who knows? It looks like a code of some kind. I am certain there are other ways to count them, too.\" I saw another counting option: 1 33 1 1 293 1 1 227 1 1 2415132 1 = 33, 293, 227, 2415132 Or reverse sequence of numbers if count starts at the center of the spiral. Chris also contacted others who gave permission for Earthfiles to reprint the following comments: 1) From Derek Skhane: \"I have long thought the actual speed of light ought to gel with 86400 seconds in 24 hours, likewise 86400 being 3.333 x 25920, the Platonic Precession cycle, otherwise 86400 being the modern day mile of 5280 x 16.3636 this being 360 degrees divided by 22, an old fashioned style of parceling land being to divide 360 by 22 Hence my preference with regard to the speed of light being exactly 186282.396 Particularly in view of the fact that 186 + 282 + 396 = 864 Anyway your 33,293,227,24,5,32, reading as 3329322724532 {I will abridge where necessary} {A} 145499.8703177665544332211009988 divided by exactly 46666.62 = 3.117857481809 this multiplied by actual Pi = 9.79503815979 {B} The exact 46666.62 being 666 x 70.07 otherwise 46666.62 being 5280 x 8.838375 exactly {etc} {C} The square root of 3329322724532 being 1824643.17731769 that is the 9.79503815979 x 186282.39600000053249 I trust this be of assist, however please take into consideration that number is ever so flexible, perchance I may perhaps be of further assist with reference to the math, you need but ask and if feasible, I will oblige.\" 2) From Johanna R: \"The Yatesbury circle with the number codes, resembles the rosary, part of our recent discussions. The Winterbourne circle resembles a rose seen straight from above, also part of our recent discussions. Rosary and Rose, very interesting!\" Spiral contains 87 spaces. Circles appear in 57 spaces, there are 30 blank spaces. By numbering the positions 1 thru 87 we get a sequence of colored dots where the circles appear. By reversing the sequence, from 87 to 1, we get the opposite sequence of dots. 1 thru 87 ( the upward spiral) 87 thru 1 ( the downward spiral) 88.......88 This is representative of the DNA or as someone in group pointed out, the null zone when a sequence ( of musical notes, etc) is reversed on itself. The chart is too long to reproduce here to remain legible. So I have pasted a portion of it to show the 88 sums. Here is the full chart, which is hardly legible given the reduction required: The bars come out clearly enough ( location of the 57 circles)."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"One alignment occurs between the upward spiral and the downward spiral (colored in green) at the following spaces: 8 – 9 – 10 – – 12 and 80 – 79 –78 – – 76 88- 88- 88- - 88 By repeating the upward spiral and downward spiral we get the repeated pattern below: 3) From Norma Smith: \"Sum of all circles is 57...Rose...England. Also, notice the palindrome 1,3,3,1 at outside 'end' or 'start' of circles sequence ...could be either end or beginning of such a spiral....or a palindrome. Sum of 1331 to 7 = 36...Child; the 5,1 as 51 = June 1 ( date of The Child dream ) In fact, the sum for this series to '51' does = 51. Then the final circles of 3,2,1 bring circle total to 57. ( 3,2,1 as letters C,B,A are the 3 notes in that Rosslyn music decoding.)\" Earthfiles welcomes further comments from viewers about the Yatesbury Field spiral and single circle to: earthfiles@earthfiles.com.
