Kecksburg Crash/Retrieval Update (See Earthfiles 10/25/03) Stan Gordon, who extends investigative credits to Keith R. Bastianini and Dennis Smeltzer, continues from Part 11 with his report, \"The Military Interest,\" reprinted in Leonard Stringfield's Status Report VII. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"Another new eyewitness to come forward is Jerry Betters, a well-known Pittsburgh jazz musician. Jerry was 41-years-old at the time of the 1965 incident. Jerry was living in Murrysville at the time which is located between Pittsburgh and Greensburg. Late that afternoon, Jerry had just finished feeding some horses. A short time later after returning to the house, he noticed a bright flash of light that lasted only a few seconds and quit. Suddenly the horses became agitated and the pet dog became excited and made crying sounds. Sometime later, after turning on the radio, he heard news reports about the object that had passed over the Pittsburgh area and had reportedly crashed at Kecksburg. Jerry did not have a car at the time, so he called some friends to tell them about what had happened at his home since he felt that the flash was related to the sky object. His friends had also heard the news about the UFO, so they picked him up and proceeded to go to Kecksburg to have a look for themselves. Jerry did not know the area, but they found themselves on the private lane. Jerry states that after rounding a slight turn, they were halted by a military roadblock. The men, stopping traffic, were dressed in Army fatigues with cloth caps. Other armed services personnel, some helmeted and bearing rifles, others carrying sidearms, were present behind the roadblock. The driver rolled down the window to talk to the men while Jerry was looking over the surroundings. To the left, Jerry noticed a mist or steam coming up out of the woods. Jerry thought that there might have been a fire since he also saw a fire truck ahead. In addition, Jerry recalls numerous military vehicles, including jeeps and canvas-covered personnel trucks with the Army star emblazoned on them scattered ahead on the lane. Jerry also noticed a number of \"Army brass\" officers who differed from the men blocking the road by their formal uniforms and commanding attitudes. He also stated that police and some well-dressed civilians were among the assembled group. Jerry's attention was diverted to the road black where a ranking officer had become impatient with the time it was taking to remove the sightseers. In a harsh commanding manner that left no doubt that serious action would be taken against them, the officer demanded their immediate departure. Coming up from the field towards the lane, Jerry noticed a large cab and flatbed trailer coming into view. At this time, he noticed a domed or acorn-shaped object that was being hauled and which was not covered at this time. Quickly, a tarpaulin was placed over it. In the final moments before their departure, Jerry watched the large cab with flatbed trailer attempting to turn with difficulty. Later that night, numerous eyewitnesses saw a large Army cab with flatbed trailer carrying something covered with a tarpaulin from the site. The flatbed trailer was moving at a fast pace and was accompanied by a military jeep escort. We later learned that truckers had spotted this military convoy as it journeyed towards Columbus, Ohio. Prior to the airing of the Unsolved Mysteries TV program, I had interviewed a former Air Force officer who was stationed at Lockbourne AFB in 1965. He was among other personnel who guarded the object from Pennsylvania when it made a short stopover at the base and before continuing on to Wright-Patterson AFB in Dayton, Ohio. Clifford E. Stone SFC, U.S. Army (Ret.), has had a long time interest in UFOs ever since he was young. Stone continues to be a very active UFO researcher and he has a personal interest in the Kecksburg case because he was also at Lockbourne AFB in 1965 when the Kecksburg object arrived. Stone was not in the service at the time, but had some friends at the base who knew of his UFO interest. He was contacted that night and asked if he would like to see what had"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"been recovered earlier that day in Pennsylvania. During the early morning hours of December 10, 1965, a friend of his from the base picked him up and drove him to the back gate of the base. Clifford Stone: 'We parked outside of an area located by a rear gate that lead to a hangar located inside the fenced flight line area (I believe this hangar to have been what was called the RB-47 hangar). Upon our arrival, my friend told me to remain in the car and try not to be seen. He informed me that he would explain later. From my vantage point in the car, I could see 25 to 35 military personnel, both Army and Air Force, around the hangar. The object on the flatbed trailer was tightly covered and took on a cone or egg shape. I remember thinking of it as a chocolate drop shape. From time to time, an eerie blue light would shine brightly from the bottom of the covered object and fade slowly.' Later as Clifford Stone watched, the truck, trailer and object sped away into the darkness, but this time was escorted by Air Force sedans, instead of Army gun jeeps. Other sources tell us that the object was taken to Wright-Patterson AFB for study. Where it is located today, we don't know. Much information - and even possible disinformation - has been provided to me as to the nature of the object involved. Until I have the evidence, I keep an open mind. After examining the data at hand, I stand by the two possible explanations that I have suggested for some time. My feelings are that the object might have been (A) a highly advanced Soviet space probe with some re-entry control capability; (B) a spacecraft of extraterrestrial origin. There are data on hand that suggests either possibility. That the military and government had a major interest in this Kecksburg event is well documented by those who witnessed various aspects of the event. One firsthand witness, that I have interviewed a number of times, lived a military life as a child. Her father was a high-ranking officer and apparently was directly involved with the investigation of UFO crash retrievals. Her family had been visiting in Pennsylvania at the time of the Kecksburg crash. She was standing next to her father when he received the phone call about the incident and was being given directions about how to get to Kecksburg. He quickly ran upstairs in his civilian clothes and soon came down in his dress blues. Then he quickly left the residence. More sources with information continue to reveal bits and pieces of the Kecksburg mystery. Two firsthand former military sources (unknown to each other) have told me that they saw the file report on the Kecksburg crash, but in different parts of the country at different bases. One of these sources I have met with again in the last year and while he had verbally provided certain information, I wanted to get his information recorded in a written statement. He told me he would, but after not hearing from him for several weeks, I again called him. He told me that because of the security oath he had taken, he wanted to check with a military source before providing this information to me. He sounded shaken and was told by the military source that even though his security clearance time had expired - because of the security nature of this Kecksburg event - that he should not write down anything and it would be in his best interest to forget about what he know. It is time that we strive to get our Congressmen and others interested in these matters. The evidence exists that UFO retrieval operations have taken place and likely still do. It is time that a new Congressional investigation should be conducted into cases such as Kecksburg and Roswell. If such an inquiry was to be held and"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"immunity provided to former military and government sources, then the truth will come out. I will continue to work towards this goal. To those who are curious, the report on the Kecksburg crash allegedly seen by two different military informants at two different bases, concluded the object was extraterrestrial.
