The two previous evenings leading up to the new moon were nearly as dark. And yet, a husband and wife driving along a rural Snohomish, Washington road thought they saw the biggest, brightest full moon they had ever seen low over the Snohomish River. Back in the 1970s, many eyewitnesses throughout the United States, Canada and other parts of the world reported seeing \"full moon\"-sized glowing spheres hovering over rivers, farms and ranches. One area that has long had such reports, coupled with Sasquatch sightings and unusual animal deaths referred to as \"animal mutilations,\" is Snohomish, Washington in wilderness country northeast of Seattle. Marc Probst, a hazardous materials specialist who works for a roofing company in nearby Everett, contacted me about the unusual object he and his wife saw on January 4, 2000. Interview: Marc Probst, Hazardous Materials Specialist, Everett, Washington: \"The light that my wife and I saw - it wasn't anything like a disc or typical what you hear about flying saucers. But it was - we were driving up the hill coming home -we overlook the Snohomish valley and my wife said, 'Look!' And I glanced over and said, 'Oh, it's the moon.' Then I thought about it a second. It was a cloudy night. It was kind of hanging behind some trees. You're saying that this was something so large it looked like a full moon. It did. You know those pictures you see in Africa of the moon. It looked that large. It was huge! It was real low to the ground over the river, maybe 100 to 200 feet. What color? "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"It was a yellowish...glowing I guess. Just stationery and just huge. We just got glimpses of it. We finally pulled over, but there are trees, big pine trees where we were. So we drove up farther and we'd get a better look at it and then it just blinked out. It was just gone. We never got more than ten minutes from the time we noticed it to the time it was gone. Did it seem to be focused on the River Or? Yes, it was hanging over the river, the Snohomish river in the valley. When you realized it couldn't be the full moon, did you begin to get any distance relationship between where you were in the car and whetheer this was at the river not very far away? It was about a half a mile from where we were. And there was absolutely no question that it was the moon! It was low hanging over the river. Meaning that it was not the moon. It couldn't possibly have been the moon. If it were a half mile away, what do you think the diameter might be? Larger than my fist if I held it out. Way larger.\" More Information: When I was producing the television documentary A Strange Harvest in 1979 to 1980 about unusual animal deaths known as animal mutalations, I interviewed law enforcement officials and ranchers who had also seen full-moon sized glowing spheres. One, Lou Girodo, was the Chief Investigator for the District Attorney's office in Trinidad, Colorado. On the record, Mr. Girodo described the night in the 1970s that he and a deputy were parked on a hill for a clear view of the sky because Stapleton Airport in Denver had alerted them that an unidentified object was being tracked on radar going south toward Trinidad. What they saw stunned them. Lou said an object moved rapidly to a point over the valley in front of them and stopped dead still in the air a few hundred feet above the ground. \"It looked like a big, orange full moon.\" he told me. \"And then it did the damndest thing. It split in two. There were two big, orange full moons hovering there. Then one took off fast going north and the other went south. The deputy and I looked at each other in disbelief. Not long after, the two big orange things came rushing back and merged back into one orange 'full moon.' Then that went straight down and disappeared, almost like it went into the ground. That shook us up.\" Please contact earthfiles@earthfiles.com if you have seen any unidentified aerial objects that resemble the \"full moon\" type observed by Marc Probst and his wife in Snohomish, Washington.
