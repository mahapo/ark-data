Stone, U.S. Army, retired in 1990 to his home in Roswell, New Mexico after more than twenty years as a specialist assigned to investigations of unidentified aerial vehicle crash and retrievals. Photograph courtesy Clifford Stone. Roswell, New Mexico - In 1997, a book was published entitled U.F.O.s Are Real, Extraterrestrial Encounters Documented by the U. S. Government containing documents assembled by retired U. S. Army Sergeant Clifford E. Stone of Roswell, New Mexico. He served more than twenty years as a specialist assigned to investigations of unidentified aerial vehicle crash and retrievals. Sgt. Stone was born in Portsmouth, Ohio fifty-two years ago and enlisted in the U. S. Army on July 8, 1968 when he was nineteen. From there he went to Ashland, Kentucky and then to Fort Lee, Virginia. In early 1969, he was assigned to drive an Officer-In-Charge to Ft. Belvoir, Va. for a briefing. No one told him where to wait and no one said the briefing was classified off limits. So, he waited for his superior along with an airman in the upper balcony of the auditorium in which the briefing was held. There was a clear Plexiglas wall separating their balcony seats from the main floor below so they could not hear what was being discussed. They also could not hear the sound of the motion picture film, both color and B&W, that was projected during the briefing. The film contained images of strange aerial craft and unusual bodies, both dead and alive. At first, Sgt. Stone and the airman wondered why their superior officers were being shown clips from science fiction films. Then suddenly men approached them and forced them out of the building to a debriefing room where Stone and the airman were held for several days until they learned to answer their interrogators' questions with \"I never saw anything\" or gave only their name, rank, birth date and serial number. From 1969 to this date, Sgt. Stone never spoke about the details he saw in that film. But now he agreed to tell me what he remembers seeing at the Army's Fort "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Belvoir, Virginia in March or April 1969. February 18, 1970 Certificate of Achievement for exemplary U. S. Army service during the period December 1968 to January 1970, signed by John D. McLaughlin, Brigadier General. Interview: Sergeant Clifford E. Stone, U. S. Army (Retired), Roswell, New Mexico: \"Being there at Fort Belvoir, Virginia in early 1969 where we saw the film footage is the first thing in the Army that got my real attention. UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES DID YOU SEE THE FILM? I drove my Officer-In-Charge (OIC) to Fort Belvoir because he was going to get some more on-going training that the officers needed to know for the quick response team. And I'm there as his driver. It was like a theater complex. It had seats and a stage. They were using a projector and a screen. There was an Air Force person and myself who went up into the balcony. WHY WOULD YOU AS A DRIVER BE ALLOWED TO SEE HIGHLY CLASSIFIED FILM? There was nothing indicating that this was classified. No one told us to. We just wanted to save money, had sack lunches and the balcony had seats. We didn't go up there to be nosy or anything like that. But you can't help when they turn on a projector, you start looking and seeing things that don't make any sense. I thought I had seen a lot of science fiction movies, but these were nothing like I had seen in science fiction. But we were trying to figure out what scenes these movies were from. We couldn't hear what was going on because they had a Plexiglas (wall in front of us) where we could look down and see what they were doing. DO YOU KNOW WHO WAS DOING THE BRIEFING ON THE STAGE? No, I don't. All I know is that I want to say he was a colonel, full bird, and I'm pretty sure the person was from military intelligence. Those are my impressions and from my experiences after with UFO recoveries and recovering debris and information thereof."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"But our being there created a problem, because while we were intent on trying to figure out the film, we didn't notice that people came in behind us. When we realized, they immediately said, \"What are you two doing up here?\" And we turned around and said, \"Nothing. We're just eating our lunch.\" They said, \"Do you have any idea how much trouble you're in?\" Well, they took us downstairs. They grabbed us and literally pushed us down the stairs. As soon as the stairs, no one even bothered to open the door. We were pushed out the door, pushed down the steps leading up to the auditorium. They opened up the van door and pushed us on inside.\" To be continued: Part 2 - Description of non-human entities in Ft. Belvoir, Va. 1969 film clips.
