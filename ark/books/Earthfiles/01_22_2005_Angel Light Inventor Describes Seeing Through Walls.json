January 22, 2005 North Bay, Ontario, Canada - There are many satellites now orbiting the Earth which help monitor air and water temperatures, glacial melts, hurricanes and dozens of other details in this complex world. Some of the many satellites that orbit our planet also do work for military and defense agencies. Protecting those satellites is vital to national security. But this week, a story from North Bay, Ontario, Canada, says an inventor there has come up with a machine that not only can see through walls, it can stop the electronics in any machine, including high-altitude orbiting satellites and nuclear missiles. Now, according to the inventor, the Pentagon, Saudi Arabia and France are taking notice. The inventor calls his wall-penetrating device, \"Angel Light.\" His name is Troy Hurtubise (HURTCH-uh-bees). He is 41-years-old and lives with his wife and family in North Bay, Ontario. Troy has no college degrees, but did study environmental issues for three years at the Sir Sanford Flemming College in Lindsay, Ontario. Once he was attacked by a grizzly bear and survived. That gave him a lifelong interest in studying bears and he invented a \"bear suit.\" The idea is that for a consulting fee from a bear spray company, Troy will put on his big bear suit and try out new red pepper sprays to see if the sprays will fend off black bears and grizzlies. I talked with him this week and asked him to explain his bear suit work and how he came to build the \"Angel Light\" device.

It's specifically designed for my body. I'm a bear behavior specialist. I wear the suit. I conduct the research. I try to find the trigger hormone that NASA has been searching for 20 years, find the best offense and defense against a grizzly bear, aggression techniques, develop deterrent sprays and change radio collars under winter conditions. Stuff like that. WHO WOULD HIRE YOU? The people who hire me are the companies that make the bear sprays around the world that market them to the public. It's a billion dollar business, bear sprays. Grizzly bears if you don't have a suit on, you're pretty well dead. As I say to many people in lectures think of a Great White Shark. A biologist won't study a Great White Shark unless he's in a cage. No cage, you're dead. Same thing with a grizzly bear. My suit is basically a mobile cage. AND YOU WOULD BE HIRED TO PUT ON YOUR CAGE SUIT TO PROTECT YOU FROM A BLACK BEAR AND GRIZZLY BEAR IN ORDER TO TEST THESE RED PEPPER SPRAYS. Right.\" Inventions Come from Repetitive Dreams Troy says that the ideas for building his bear suits - like the ideas for at least nine other inventions of his over the past 17 years - have come to him in vivid, repetitive dreams. Troy Hurtubise: \"I've had distinctive, repetitious dreams which I understand from the scientific community is rare since I was 16. I would see the innovation in the dream. When it would come back again and again and again, I would have basically a blueprint in my mind. I've always built my suits which is a marvel to the engineering community due to the fact I don't use schematics, I don't use blueprints, I don't use drawings. They come straight out of my head. I build them by hand and it comes out perfectly engineering proportions. They just can't understand how I do it. With all my innovations the big ones \"fire paste\" that MIT has said was 20 years ahead of what NASA is using. That comes out of a dream. The LIMBIC system that's just recent, not more than two months old. That is for the soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan that are getting killed needlessly because of their light- skinned HUMMERS. These (inventions of mine) are blast cushions that stop RPGs. Again, from a dream. Angel light. A dream. I see it and I just create it. It's never failed. It always works. I don't know why. Einstein once said the imagination and the mind. He went to bed all the time with a pen and note pad beside him and many times he would come out of a dream and right there, he would write it down. A lot of his theories came from dreams. FOR A GENERAL RADIO AUDIENCE, COULD YOU PLEASE GO BACK TO THE FIRST IN SERIES OF DREAMS YOU HAD ABOUT 'ANGEL LIGHT' AND EXPLAIN WHY YOU HAVE CALLED IT ANGEL LIGHT? The first dream started about a year and a half ago. I don't pay too much attention to the first dreams because it's just a dream. But when it's repeated basically in the exact same sequence. You can talk to a million people. You might find five that have a repetitive dream. So it's very, very rare. The dream happens again and you're basically in the dream building it from scratch. You have to look at Angel Light in its entirety. It's 14 feet long and weighs a quarter of a ton. There is probably 800 to 900 different sections to it. It's quite elaborate. All of this is pieced out in the dream. Then the actual use of it is portrayed in the dream. This time with angel light, it was to see through walls in real time space. It's all the other things that it does that's grabbing the attention. And why I called it 'angel light' is that I'm a great believer in Christ and angels. People would look at me as they have in the last couple of days and ask, 'Why would you call something like that with this terrible \"high\" effect that can kill people 'angel light?' I said, 'Why don't you understand angels?' I mean, God the way I look at God is that his left hand is Gabriel and his right hand is Michael. When he's in a good mood and wants to send a message to somebody, he sends Gabriel down who is nice and sweet. When he's in"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"a pissed off mood, he sends Michael down. Look out when Michael starts to come down because basically he's the Angel of War. There's always two sides to God and two sides to angels. So, that's what you have. Angel light, yes, can see through walls in real time and space. Troy Hurtubise standing behind his Angel Light invention. Photograph © 2005 by Phil Novak. First Time Angel Light \"Opened Up\" Cement Wall COULD YOU DESCRIBE THAT FIRST MOMENT WHEN YOU TURNED ANGEL LIGHT ON AND WHAT HAPPENED IN FRONT OF YOU? As soon as I turned it on, I mean how can you describe it? It's like out of Star Trek! I said George Lucas could not imagine this. I mean, the wall opened up. It was terrifying! It wasn't Eureka! It was like, Holy Geez!! I got so excited that I put my hand in front of it, figuring, 'Holy Geez, I wonder if you can see inside your hand?' You're talking blood cells, - it was so spooky looking inside my hand that if I had not pulled it back, I'd probably be dead today. Because after I did pull it back after it had hit the light for only 3 seconds was there a burning feeling? No. Was there a swelling? No. But an hour later, I lost the use of that hand for a year. And I've only got oh, maybe, 60% feeling in it back. I can't even wear my wedding ring. WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED TO THE WALL? DID YOU SEE LIGHT? DID IT JUST DISAPPEAR? WHAT HAPPENED? What happened is that I've got a wall in front of me 1.5 to 2 feet thick of solid concrete. On the other side of it is the garage. Now, I know what thermal technology is. I know what radar is. I know what all the technologies are in the world. If you put whatever technology you want in front of that wall right now that the military has, you're not going to see the garage in real time space. People say, 'What is that?' Well, this is what it is. Get a jackhammer. Cut a massive hole in the wall and then fit your front window on it. That's real time space. What you see in the garage if you stepped into it is exactly what you are seeing through the wall. And I almost broke my hand twice because what happened is: when you turn angel light on, a hole the size of the aperture whatever size you are using opens up in the wall. And it tricks you into believing that you could put your hand through the wall. Of course, you can't. There's still cement there and you'll break your hand. AND SO IT IS AS IF A WINDOW SUDDENLY APPEARS IN THE CEMENT WALL? Exactly. Exactly. It just opens up. And it looks like there's nothing there. It looks like someone just took a big chunk out of the wall and all you can see now is what's inside the garage the car, the license plate, the lawn mower. Just as clear as it can be. You can see the reds, the whites, the blues. You can read the fine print on newspapers that are lying around. It's like you walked into the garage. The problem is if you try to walk through the wall, you'll basically break your face! AND NEITHER YOU NOR ANY SCIENCE YOU'VE DISCUSSED THIS WITH UNDERSTANDS HOW THIS IS WORKING? I don't understand it. But one scientist said, 'The doors you've opened up, it's like another universe.' To me, it just sees through a wall. It's beautiful, lovely, who cares? I got more excited for my father who is an anthropologist and said, 'Oh, my God, son can you imagine the implications for the anthropological world for ruins and sites that have never been found, but only dreamed of?'"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Angel Light Penetration At Archaeological Sites? I said, 'Yeah, let's take a chopper and do a low fly over atop an area that you think there are ruins underneath there.' I mean, Wow! The ground would open up. It would be like looking hundreds of feet under the ground with nothing there. You would think that if you jumped out of the chopper, you would fall through the hole. But there is no hole there. You just think there's a hole there. I've done it right in my front yard, right in front of the neighbors. Right in the front yard! I had a buddy with me and my brother. He said, 'There are pipes underneath the ground here, Troy, like sewage and gas pipes, stuff like that, all the mains and that right there. 'Can we see them?' I said, 'I don't know. Let's turn it on.' Boom! My brother actually thought he went to step into it. He went to step in to the hole that was not there. It just appears to be a hole there. You can see all the pipes and everything. The whole infrastructure of the street opened up. There it was, bang! Just like that. But if you step on it, you're stepping on the ground. So, I have no idea what it's doing. SINCE YOU HAVE THESE IDEAS IN REPETITIVE DREAMS, DO YOU HAVE ANY INTUITIVE SENSE ABOUT WHAT IT IS EXACTLY THAT IS INSPIRING YOU TO COME UP WITH THESE INVENTIONS? I don't know. I really don't know. My mother is a very devout Catholic. She says, 'You have legions of angels around you.' Maybe it's destiny and stuff like that. I don't a have a clue. Inventor Says French Government Wants Angel Light Anti-Satellite Weapon The French do not care that it can see through walls. Their grabbing Angel Light and the only reason why the Pentagon is stepping up to the plate now and everybody else is because Angel Light can take out anything in the world that runs on electronics. That means if I point it towards space that's what I'm building right now. That's what France gave me the money for I'm building a booster to take satellites out into space if they so desire to do so. An F-18 fighter that's cloaked with stealth technology, it (Angel Fire) can pick it up. But more than than, intercontinental ballistic missiles, tanks, planes, anything that runs on electronics - which is 90% of all the militaries in the world right now - are totally rendered useless by Angel Light. So, it's got nothing to do with looking through walls. That's not what is grabbing the attention. What's grabbing the attention is that it is now a national defense problem. It's like a small country that's a nobody, but they have Angel Light, now becomes a big boy on the block. That's why I'm getting all the attention. That's the travesty of it. WHAT YOU ARE IMPLYING THEN IS THAT WHATEVER ANGEL LIGHT DOES, IT'S INTERFERING WITH THE ELECTROMAGNETIC FREQUENCIES OF SOME OPERATING MACHINES. It must be doing something because when the French came, they brought it in a box about a square foot in diameter. It had a glass filament, like a mirror filament on the outside. I asked, 'What's that?' They said, 'Just a curiosity.' After they saw Angel Light turned on and could see through the wall, was that impressive to them? That was not impressive compared to what it did to the box because apparently what was inside the box was electronics which could not be touched by anything. For the French, there was no way you were going to knock these electronics out. They put the box in front of Angel Light, and it was gone in seconds. I told them, 'Well, guys, light, lasers, anything, bounces off mirrors. You put a mirror in front of Angel Light though, and I'll walk right through it. So, it does not matter what is inside that box or what you've got for protection, the Angel Light will go right through it. I've already talked with MIT (Massachusetts Institute for Technology, Boston). They told me to try every known metal you can think of. I have tried pure tin. I have tried steel, titanium, ceramic, all the way up to lead. And Angel Light goes through it all.\" More Information:"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Troy Hurtubise says he will assemble Angel Light for a press demonstration at his lab in North Bay, Ontario, Canada, on February 17, 2005. He also expects the French government agency who contacted him to submit a contract for Angel Light's development and production as an anti-satellite military device.
