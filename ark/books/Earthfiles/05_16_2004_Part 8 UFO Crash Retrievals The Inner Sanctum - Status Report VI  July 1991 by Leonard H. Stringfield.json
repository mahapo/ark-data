Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. Len Stringfield: \"I am indebted to Tim Cooper again, this time for his story on 'Barnabas,' age 87, who passed 'way December 31, 1990, in Big Bear Lake, California. Said the local newspaper, Grizzly, on January 10, 1991, 'The Valley watchdog is gone. Albert Bruce Collins, known as Barnabas, passed away on New Year's Eve.' Described as a friend of law enforcement who always had something to report to deputies, the stoop-shouldered man with white hair and trailing beard to match was found by a repairman coming to fix the heater at the apartment where he was staying. Barnabas had called 911 early in the morning on New Year's Eve to report an odor of gas. The dispatchers on duty said Barnabas sounded sick and sent an ambulance as well, according to detective, Tom Bradford, of the Big Bear's Sheriff Station. Cooper's interview with Barnabas was November 20, 1990! (Month before death) In his interview, which lasted for three hours, without benefit of an audio recorder and depending on notes, Timothy said that Barnabas was a metallurgical engineer and retired government employee. His questions and answers, in part, follow: Interview with Albert Bruce Collins, aka \"Barnabas,\" provided by Timothy Cooper Cooper's Interview Date: November 20, 1990, one month before \"Barnabas\" Albert Collins died. Location: Big Bear Lake, California. Q. What do you know about UFOs? A. That they exist and are real. Q. Why do you say that? A. Because I saw one in 1947. It was on a long flatbed trailer covered with a green tarp being backed into a large warehouse at Berkeley. Q. What did you see? A. It looked oval-shaped. Kind of flat all around the edge. I later saw it again with the tarp off. It looked like an egg with its shell cracked ... with the yoke still inside. It looked like the craft sustained an internal explosion ... the metal skin appeared to be pushed out ... polished aluminum with a silvery-looking finish. It had a seam at the edge all around. There was a lot of damage ... like a large section ripped off ... a big "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"gash on top running down the side below the seam. It had a gold-like finish on the underside. Q. What did it look like inside? A. From my vantage point (from approx. 100 ft.), it had a bulkhead in front with multi-layer skin (honeycombed). It was dark inside. In the center, there was a shiny sphere surrounded by another bulkhead. There was a forward compartment; did not know what it was. Q. How big was it? A. 30-40 ft. in diameter and approximately 15 ft. high at the center. Q. Can you tell me who you saw there? What you were doing there? A. Can't tell you that. (Collins did not want to go any further. He wanted to talk about other things.) Albert Collins Studied Metal of Unknown Composition and Origin Q. What was your involvement with Berkeley? A. Worked on developing metal alloys used for electro-magnetic propagation and magnetic propulsion. I worked for Berkeley and Occidental College for the Manhattan Project from 1942 to the late fifties. They sent fragments to the lab for analysis. We could not identify the composition, origin or mode of manufacture. Before we could complete our tests, the Army came and took the samples away without an explanation. Q. Can you describe the samples? A. As best I can recall, it was a dull finish metal on the one side like aluminum and very shiny on the other side. It was thin and very light. It could be flexed, but not dented on impact. We could not separate its metals through any assay we knew of. It was fire and cold resistant. Could not be cut or punctured. Some pieces were big with slight curvature to them. Other pieces were very small. One piece was very big and about one inch thick. It was jagged, like it had been part of a structure that had been hit by high explosives. it had burn marks, but no scratches which was very odd. You could fold it and it would extend back to its original shape. Link Between Manhattan Project Atomic Bomb Development and UFO Sightings Hiroshima, Japan: The huge atomic cloud August 6, 1945. A uranium bomb, the first nuclear weapon in the world, was dropped on Hiroshima City. It was estimated that its energy was equivalent to 15 kilotons of TNT. Aerial photograph from 80 kilometers away from the Inland Sea, taken about one hour after the drop. Photograph by US Army. Q. Is there a connection between UFO sightings (1942-1946) and the development of the atomic bomb? "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"A. I attended seminars at Berkeley on 'shell' designs for advanced ordnance programs (he thinks that these seminars were designed to recruit engineers for the Manhattan Project). Read reports on new alloys being developed for 'containment' of temperatures greater than anything then known. Date of acquired knowledge by Collins: 1949. Agencies involved: Rand Corporation, CIA, Intelligence officers from the United States Army, Air Force and Navy. The Vatican was invited to advise U.S. government on religious implications (Spellman, Holy See and Vatican Secretary of State). Project name(s) mentioned: Archangel - CIA, Rand and Vatican Blackbook - USAF (1948 and 1949) Bluebook - USAF (1949) - (Stringfield note: Year not accurate) Whitebook - CIA & Vatican (1950) Yellowbook - Scientific panel of unknown government scientific review board. Stringfield: This is a portion of an interview with Albert Collins concerning his knowledge of a classified study conducted in 1949 by the Rand Corporation, CIA and solicited comments from a Vatican representative. Q. What do you know of a covert effort to learn of the origins of UFOs/recovered spacecraft and bodies? A. There was a rumor circulating around a small group of scientists that a secret study was underway to evaluate the UFO sightings and supposed recovery of spacecraft and their crews. I knew this because the rumors were coming out of Los Alamos, from people coming back to California. I saw some notes from a friend of mine. He told me that New Mexico was abuzz with unusual research into nuclear powered aircraft and bizarre biological experiments. Some people were losing their clearances for no apparent reasons. Project Archangel and Blue, Black, White and Yellow Books I saw the word 'Archangel' and other words that described four projects that had 'Blue, Black, White and Yellow prefixed to the word Book.' It was not clear what these four colors meant. I was told that these colors represented the 'nature' of the studies. I remember something about an astronomer being asked to help identify the green fireballs and strange debris being found in the desert. All I know is that the scary feelings everybody had who was asked to do experiments on stuff that nobody ever saw before and how we were later threatened if we talked about anything we saw, felt or heard. Q. What kind of rumors did you hear? A. - Autopsies of midget people with mongoloid heads that were accidentally exposed to high doses of radiation at Los Alamos. - Nuclear reactors being used in aircraft. - Failed nuclear-powered tests on experimental aircraft that killed pilots and ground crews at Muroc, California, and at Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, New Mexico. - Atomic Energy Commission control of experiments at Los Alamos, Holloman AFB and Kirtland AFB installations. - Unusual 'metal-like wood' being tested and results fed into a computer at Berkeley, California. - Security was unbearable. Everyone being followed, watched, spied on. Had to sign loyalty oaths just to keep job. - Military were into everything. - Flying disks were landing on military bases in California and New Mexico and they were not ours."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" - Everyone with clearances were afraid to ask or talk. It was better to not work for MED or APC. Q. What did your friend tell you about the Archangel study? A. Three things: 1) They (EBEs) were biological, gas-breathing, intelligent animals that have craniums larger than Homo-sapiens. They have vascular systems, skeletal structures (calcite), possessing a form of manual dexterity like humans; 2) They have a cell-like constitution somewhat like plants that are responsive to sunlight; 3) They are human-like possessing an ability to make right and wrong judgments. THE AIR FORCE COLONEL OPERATIONS OFFICER The following information is from a retired U. S. Air Force colonel who was in a key position to know some of the critical UFO issues facing the military establishment during the Roswell era. His disclosures were obtained February 10, 1991, and cleared for use in this report by Tim Cooper, as follows: Q. What kind of UFO sighting reports were at Pentagon in 1945-1951? Col. - Classified Double Top Secret .(Stringfield: Classification category unknown) - Foo Fighters in 1945-1946. - Thought they were German. - Utilized nuclear power in some way not understood. - Composed of metals and plastics not known on Earth. - Detected many bogies in and around Los Alamos and Roswell doing over 4,000 m.p.h. at 20,000 to 40,000 ft. altitude. Q. What was U.S. Air Force's reaction? Col. Panic. Fear of unknown. Thought they were Russian of captured German technology. Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit Q. Did you know of the IPU (Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit)? Col. I knew that Army G-2 had such a unit in the war to monitor the Foo Fighters. Worked with Project Silverplate. Did not know its name. There was a special intelligence organization headed by Doolittle, maybe. Interplanetary Phenomenon Unit TOP SECRET ULTRA Intelligence Assessment File ref. 001947122-A.1206 dated September 4, 1960, by authority of Lt. General John A. Samford, Director, National Security Agency (NSA) and approved by Allen Dulles, Director, Central Intelligence Agency.

Photograph from French WWII history file. 1940s - American Atomic and Space Research Q. Were there experiments being conducted using atomic power for Top Secret aircraft? Col. Yes. In 1946-1949, at Los Alamos and Sandia Labs. Possibly at Alamogordo and Kirtland. There were secret Navy testing at sea utilizing crude fission reactors for high voltage energy experiments. Also, there were atomic reactors being put into aircraft. The experiments failed. Some died from radiation exposure. Q. Did the Air Force recover 'flying disks'? Col. Yes. Some were found in 1946 and 1947. Some in Mohave Desert and some in New Mexico. Q. Where were these 'disks' taken to? Col. Some to Muroc and others to Langley. They wanted to know what they were made of and how they worked. Q. What were these things that were taken to Muroc and Edwards? Col. They were 'lifting bodies.' They looked like inverted bathtubs. It was assumed that they were some kind of 'pod' or short-range recon probes. Q. Who was in charge of the scientific research? Col. (Werner) Von Braun, (Edward) Condon, (Robert) Oppenheimer and (Edward) Teller. There were many technicians (civilian and military) regularly coming to watch and learn. The Pentagon was being briefed weekly on the new developments. Q. Did they find out how the lifting bodies worked and on what technology? Col. No. They theorized on the ability to achieve the speed of light and utilized magnetic lines of force. They made some gains in understanding how to harness an energy source greater than the hydrogen bomb and how it was possible to reach speeds of 6 miles per second in the earth's atmosphere. In 1948, they were learning how to recover people back from space and by 1959, how to re-enter from orbit. This knowledge led to the shuttle development. Q. How did they learn how to apply this technology? Col. They had help. Q. Who? Col. The same one who helped them develop the bomb."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":" Q. Who? Col. No comment. Q. How did the Air Force benefit from all this? Col. Highly experimental ram-jet technology was tested at Muroc that was classified Above Top Secret (Ultra). Also, heat compression technologies were developed at Edwards for some special spacecraft designs. Project Blue Book Q. Why did the Air Force initiate Project Blue Book? Col. Mainly for public relations. Basically, the Air Force wanted to gather UFO intelligence on a low-level so as not to tip off the Russians of any intensive efforts by the United States in developing high technology weapons. By that time, the Air Force had accepted the fact that there was a higher intelligence beyond ours. Only a dozen or so people in the U. S. government knew anything about the sighting reports and recoveries of these 'lifting bodies.' So it's not surprising that lower level Air Force officials did not know of the highly classified intelligence operations being conducted at that time. As long as the public was convinced that the Air Force was just as curious as the public was, it was the perfect cover. Q. Was there any UFO activity during the war within the U. S.? Col. There was some pilot sightings and by bomber crews who were in training in B-29s (Project Silverplate) that worried the Pentagon. Unofficially, some had speculated that Dr. Vannevar Bush and others were involved in some kind of aeronautical designs that were unconventional aircraft by any standards known at that time. President Roosevelt had authorized a great deal of money into 'lifting-bodies' technology that was associated with the Manhattan Project and ultimately with military applications. Embassy and military communications from Japan and Germany were constantly being intercepted and deciphered. I think some of the reports were dealing with Foo Fighters or new spy weapons in the MAJIC network operations. 1938 War of the Worlds Radio Test of Public Reaction to Extraterrestrial Invasion of Earth In 1938, it was believed that the Army G-2 wanted to test the response of the civilian population by monitoring the CBS radio broadcast of Orson Wells's War of the Worlds . Of course, this did create widespread panic in some areas. The New York Times front page headline on Monday, October 31, 1938, after Orson Wells produced the War of the Worlds fictional radio broadcast that many listeners thought was literally happening. 1945 - Large, Unidentified Black Objects Over Los Alamos, New Mexico Lab Cut Off Power There were, on several occasions, sightings of huge black objects hovering over Los Alamos in early 1945 which caused severe power blackouts that"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"could not be explained. Wendover AFB, Utah was kept informed of this because it was feared that unknown radio propagation could effect the detonation of 'Fat Man' and 'Little Boy.' (The two atomic bombs U. S. dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945). This was not recorded in the security files for fear of generating panic in Washington. Officially, Los Alamos identified it with 'atmospheric anomalies' and left it that way. Some identified it as storm cloud and electrical storm effects. It was never clear what caused the sudden surge of radiation detection or electrical shorts. 1945 - Unknown Radio Signal Affected Hiroshima Atom Bomb The first atomic bomb almost prematurely detonated en route to Hiroshima when an unknown radio signal almost armed and activated the detonation and trigger mechanisms. It was not known how it happened. The system was corrected. Q. Were there other Air Force investigations other than Blue Book? Col. Yes. Q. What were they? Col. Black Sky intelligence operations utilizing high altitude aircraft such as X-2, X-15 and U-2 aircraft. High altitude, long trajectory rockets equipped with all kinds of cameras and sensing equipment. Television was used on some rockets. White Sands and the Cape were the launch sites from 1947 into the late 1950s. All data were classified in a report called, I think, 'Blackbook' or 'Black-Sky.' Vatican Files and Photographs of UFOs I heard of another Air Force project that looked into all the historical records concerning UFO sightings from all over the world. Some of the records were from libraries, newspapers, folklore, mythologies, government records of unusual reports from farmers, lighthouse workers and so forth. There was talk that the Vatican holds numerous files of sightings going back to the fifteenth century. The Vatican also has photographs that clearly depict craft of unusual shapes and sizes that are the 1915 period. No one can gain access to this collection. It was rumored that the Vatican even has a UFO locked up in one of the vault rooms inside the Vatican Basilica and would not let the U. S. Air Force see it or photograph it. This study was called the 'Whitebook.' There was a scientific study that began sometime in early 1948 that involved the astronomical community. I only read a brief memo from Vandenberg that solar astronomy became a concern or was attractive to the Air Force for learning about cosmic radiation effects on aviation electronics. \"Black Sky:\" Loss of American Pilots and Aircraft Trying to Intercept UFOs Over Military Installations These projects were canceled after the Air Force experienced loss of pilots and aircraft while trying to respond to air space violations of UFOs over sensitive military and AFC installations. The Air Force wanted to counter the 'Black Sky' threat by the formation of the 'High Frontier' programs for space-based weapons systems in the early 1960s. Talon Gold and Teal Ruby projects were a direct result of satellite recon photos of orbiting space craft of unknown origins. (Howe's emphasis) This led to the establishment of the NRO (National Reconnaissance Office) in 1960. Also, the raw data were processed by the secretive Technical Reconnaissance Squadrons and classified by NORAD HQ at Ent AFB, Colorado Springs, Colorado.' "},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"Ent Air Force Base in September 1955, Colorado Springs, Colorado. Stringfield: The Colonel's reference to the Foo Fighter needs clarification. During WWII, these aerial interlopers, often described as highly maneuverable silver disks or self-luminous globes, were frequently witnessed by allied airmen starting in late 1943, mainly over war zones. In the European Theater of Operations, they were called 'Kraut fireballs' and as the number of encounters increased in Europe and Asia, U. S. Air Force Intelligence surmised that they were a new ingenious German weapon. Their objective? Theories ranged from intelligence gathering surveillance to jam engines, to render radar ineffective, or to cause psychological disorientation. Surprise! When Germany surrendered in May 1945, the Foo Fighters persisted throughout the Pacific Theater right up to the final days of the Japanese surrender. I know because I saw three of them approach my aircraft, a C-46, with twelve GI passengers, while flying near Iwo Jima on August 27, 1945. This famous island battleground was my stopover prior to landing at the Atsugi Air Base near Tokyo, four days before the war officially ended. Incidentally, the second C-46 following my flight, crashed mysteriously into Mt. Fuji; all passengers were killed. I will not belabor my experience here, as the story is basically described in my books: Inside Saucer Post 3-0 Blue and in Situation Red: The UFO Siege. Apparently, the Colonel used the (generic) name 'Foo Fighter' loosely just as we in research have loosely used the term 'Roswell' (signifying UFO crash/retrieval cases). The Colonel's mention of General Jimmy Doolittle as heading up the investigation of the phenomena should probably be in reference to the 'ghost rockets,' another mystery device that penetrated Scandinavian skies in 1945 and 1946, sometimes crashing. Like the Foo Fighters, early belief was that the rockets were a high-tech device that might have been developed by the Germans. But, when the war ended, the remaining German Luftwaffe pilots who had also encountered the strange craft, thought they were American. In summary, take your choice - Foo Fighter, Flying Saucer, Lifting Body or UFO. They are all of the same unknown origin. To those who want to argue the point that the Germans were capable, or did build a disc-like device, one might add that just maybe they got the concept from a crashed extraterrestrial spaceship. But seriously, while the Colonel presents extensive information showing official concern for the pervasive UFO, he carefully avoids data that confirm origin/s. Perhaps, then, it is significant when he states that the Talon Gold and Teal Ruby projects were a direct result of satellite recon photos of orbiting sp acecraft of unknown origins.\" Continued in Part 9.
