Photograph courtesy NOAA.July 2, 2000 Stony Brook, New York - Biologists in the Marine SciencesResearch Center at State University of New York at Stony Brook are puzzled bythe vigorous brown tide algal bloom this spring that has killed off most of theshellfish in Long Island's Great South Bay. Part of the problem, in addition tothe more traditional link of algal blooms to pesticide and fertilizer runoffs fromland, is global warming. Winter 2000 was warmer than normal and Spring 2000was the warmest spring on record in the United States. But no one expectedbrown tide algae to persist through the winter and then flourish and spread as faras it has in the Great South Bay.Craig Strong, Vice President of Bluepoints Co., Inc., a West Sayville hatcheryspecializing in hard clams and oysters, rates this brown tide as nearly the worsthe has ever seen. \"We have had no shellfish growth at all this entire spring in theGreat South Bay. That's happened before with brown tides, but this is thelongest we've had it because it went through the winter.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Phytoplankton, single celled marine algae, 1/1000 of a millimeter to 2 millimeters,live in the upper 100 meters of the oceans. Algae absorb oxygen and sunlight.If too widespread such as brown or red tides, the plants suffocate other marine life which iswhy shellfish have died in Long Island's Great South Bay. Photomicrograph by RitaHorner, Ph.D., NOAA.Brown tide, like red tide, is a microscopic single celled plant called aphytoplankton. Normally, algae are a food source for marine life. But when theplants begin to cover huge areas of water, they absorb the oxygen and sunlightthat other marine animals and plants need to survive. The current brown tide inLong Island's South Bay has effectively killed off all shellfish growth for thisseason leaving everyone to wonder what the consequences are for next year andbeyond if brown tides persist.At SUNY-Stony Brook, Professor Gordon Taylor, Ph.D. in the Marine SciencesResearch Center is studying chemicals in ground water as it leaves urban areasand enters rivers and the ocean with the idea that vigorous algal blooms mightbe connected directly to the chemical pollution.Gordon Taylor, Ph.D., Professor of Marine Sciences, State University ofNew York at Stony Brook, Marine Sciences Research Center, Stony Brook,New York: \"This brown tide is unusual because the most intense brown tidesusually occur in a different bay system at the east end of Long Island betweenthe North Fork and the South Fork of Long Island by the Hamptons. It'soccurred there just about every year since 1985. Great South Bay normallydoesn't get as intensive a bloom that we're seeing this year. That's what makes itso unusual.Factors that contribute to the brown tide's growth are things like rainfallpatterns, water temperature, wind. There is a weather component that sets upthe physical conditions for the brown tide and we think there is also acontribution from the water that flows into the bay - it's either from the smallstreams and rivers or from ground water. After a rainfall, some of the rainpercolates down through the soil and moves along the water table andeventually comes back up in our bays, so any chemicals that are added to ourwater go into the water table and end up going into the bay. That's one of thetheories I'm studying right now, the chemical quality of the ground waterentering the bay is what is promoting the growth of brown tides."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"THE ALGAE MIGHT BE SURVIVING ON PESTICIDES ANDCHEMICALS.In a matter of speaking. Probably the fertilizers that we apply to our gardens andlands contribute, and the pesticides may have a subtle effect where it tips thebalance to an environment that is particularly suitable for brown tide and not sosuitable for the brown tide's competing algae, algae that normally grow in thebay.WHAT DO YOU THINK HAPPENED IN 1985 THAT THIS HASBECOME SUCH A DEVASTATING PROBLEM IN THE LAST 10 TO 15YEARS?That's an excellent question. That's the one I've asked before I heard about thisproblem and moved to Long Island. What is different about the bay systems heresince 1985 as opposed to the previous century when it was never observed. Myhypothesis is that the land use patterns have changed around surrounding theGreat South Bay and the Peconic's Bay and that change in land use hasinfluenced the chemical quality of the ground water that leaves the land andenters the land.JUST LIKE THE PFIESTERIA PROBLEM FURTHER SOUTH,LARGELY IN NORTH CAROLINA, THERE ARE ALGAE THAT SEEMTO THRIVE ON PESTICIDES AND FERTILIZERS.That's correct. All plants need fertilizers, whether we're growing tomatoes in ourgarden or phytoplankton in our bays and harbors. They all need the nitrogenand phosphorous that we apply to our lawns. All plant life needs this forgrowth. The interesting thing with brown tide is that it's a species that's not thatfast growing. There are other algae out there that should compete just as welland they don't. And that's what really is the puzzling aspect of this wholeproblem.I should say this brown tide, unlike Pfiesteria (which can harm people) does notpresent a health threat to human populations, but it does seem to be a very poorquality food source for organisms for animals that eat algae. And most of thethings that live in our bay and harbor, their life depends on having a goodnutritional source of algae."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Aggressive algal blooms in both Pfiesteria and brown tide turn waters brown.Fish and other marine animals die when oxygen is depleted. Pfiesteria, a dinoflagellate thathas ananimal amoeba stage in addition to its plant life cycles, can literally eat the flesh of fish andwhatever tissue is in the water, including humans. Pfiesteria also releases aerosols into theair whichaffect the central nervous system and cause disorientation and memory loss. Photographcourtesy NOAA.YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM WHERE NOTHING WANTS TO EAT ITAND IT KEEPS SPREADING AND USING THE OXYGEN.Exactly. And the light. Because these brown tides get so dense, they shade thelight. They absorb all the light and use it for their own growth and very littlelight is left over to reach bottom vegetation which our bays and harborsnormally have, at least along the inshore areas, the shallow areas.I UNDERSTAND IT IS SO SERIOUS NOW THAT YOU ARE FACING ASUMMER IN WHICH THERE MAY NOT BE ANY SHELL FISHPRODUCTION AT ALL ALONG THE LONG ISLAND'S GREATSOUTH BAY.That's what some workers have told us. Yes, that's correct.NO SHELL FISH.There was a nice illustration I saw the other day of a commercial shell fishgrower down in Great South Bay in Blue Points where they have tanks wherethey raise the larvae and the small juvenile oysters. And in one set of tanks, theyhad water where they had removed the brown tide and you saw nice growth.Oysters were developing normally. And those where they just let the bay watercome in that had the brown tide were 1/10th the size. So they will not reachmaturity. They will not make it to market. And that's probably what is occurringuniversally across most of Great South Bay right now.HOW SERIOUS CAN THIS BE IF YOU LOSE ONE ENTIRE SEASONOF ANY SHELL FISH PRODUCTION - DOES THAT MEAN THERE"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WILL BE LESS AND LESS AND LESS OVER THE FORESEEABLEFUTURE?We've experienced this in the Peconic Bay system for the last 15 years, a browntide there, every year except two that I can think of and the effect it's had in thatbasin - it's completely decimated the bay scallop industry. They've had very fewyears where they have had a commercial crop of scallops. Great South Bay ismore intermittent. It's never as widespread as we see it this year. We have nomore reason to believe it's going to be this bad next year. This may just be afluke.BUT WHAT IF IT ISN'T?Then the shell fish industry is definitely in trouble. If the brown tide isn't herenext year, they will bring in seed stock to the hatchery from other locationswhere the shell fish are healthy. They'll grow them up in their hatcheries and putthem out in the bay bottom. And if there's not a brown tide, we'll be fine.BUT IF THERE IS A BROWN TIDE AGAIN?Again, that industry is going to vanish, because there will be no healthy watersto raise their product.THERE IS NOTHING THAT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CAN DOABOUT THE BROWN TIDE TODAY?Not today given the state of our knowledge. I'm optimistic that in the future, nottoo distant future, we'll understand all the conditions that allow this organism toproliferate and we'll be able to do something about t it. The solution might bevery expensive. It might be politically sensitive. It may be uncomfortable for alot of people. But I'm confident there will be a solution.WHAT IF IT'S TIED TO THE INCREASING PESTICIDE, FERTILIZERAND RUNOFF AND THE FACT THAT GLOBAL WARMING SEEMSTO BE SETTING IN REGARDLESS OF ARGUMENTS ABOUT ITSSOURCE AND THAT EACH SUMMER SEEMS TO BE GETTINGWARMER AND WARMER. ISN'T THAT CONTRIBUTING TO THESEVIGOROUS ALGAE BLOOMS?That's well put. That's a definite possibility. We find throughout the U. S.problems with agriculture lands being over-fertilized. But there are newgenerations of fertilizers being introduced that are less mobile. They don'tmigrate through the soils as rapidly. And through education and publicawareness,, if we change the mode in which we apply pesticides and fertilizersand the products themselves improve and become less mobile and stay on siterather than moving to bays and harbors, that there is a chance that there can besome correction. We can't do anything about the global warming issue. But otherthings are under our control."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"NEXT SUMMER THEN THE LIKELIHOOD IS THAT IF THE TRENDWE'VE SEEN FOR AN ENTIRE DECADE OF INCREASINGLYWARMER SUMMERS KEEPS GOING, THE LIKELIHOOD IS THATTHE SUMMER OF 2001 WILL FIND THE BROWN TIDE EQUALLY ASBAD. WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS NO SHELL FISH NOT ONLY INLONG ISLAND'S GREAT SOUTH BAY, BUT THAT I MIGHT BEGINTO AFFECT ALL THE SHELL FISH INDUSTRY IN THENORTHEAST?We haven't seen massive outbreaks of brown tide anywhere other than in ourarea of Long Island Sound Bay. I should point out on this temperature issue thatbrown tide doesn't do well when the water reaches summer temperatures. That'swhen the brown tide starts to die off because it doesn't like really warm water.There is an optimum temperature range in which it thrives. It just so happens thisyear, Great South Bay reached that optimum earlier in the year than it normallydoes. That's why it hit early and hard, we believe, combined with rainfallpatterns.THIS IS THE WARMEST SPRING ON RECORD IN THE UNITEDSTATES AS WELL.Yes, and we had a very wet May in this region. April was rather dry. We got ourApril showers in May. And the brown tide was reported around May 15th.THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE MAY START SEEING WARMINGSPRINGS AND THIS PROBLEM OF THE ALGAE BLOOMINGBEFORE HOTTER SUMMER TEMPERATURES KICK IN AND KILLIT OFF THAT THIS IS EXACTLY THE SPRING TIME WHEN THESHELL FISH NEED TO GROW AND THAT'S WHEN THE ALGAECOULD BE CAUSING THE GREATEST PROBLEM?Excellent. Yes, that's a very good point. The thing to consider is that most of thefisheries and resources that we're talking about, they reproduce in early spring.They produce their larvae which are most sensitive to environmental conditionsand so if something is not right with the environment, these larvae are not goingto survive. They are not going to make it to mature animals. So, as you say, if itdoes occur this way, brown tide is dominant in the spring when everything isreproducing that does not bode well for survival in those particularenvironments.IF THIS BECAME A REPETITIVE PATTERN IN THE SPRING AS THISYEAR, HOW EXTENSIVE COULD THIS DAMAGE OF THE SHELLFISH INDUSTRY BECOME?That's an interesting question. I think that the effects will be seen from heresouthward, but the waters are still cool enough northward in New England thatit would be a very long time before we would see that pattern migratingnorthward. But we would certainly see it more commonly to the south of us."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"SO GLOBAL WARMING MIGHT MAKE SHELL FISH AS RARE ASGOOD CAVIAR?(laughs) That is possible yes.\"http://www.nwfsc.noaa.gov/hab/blooms.htm#whatCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
