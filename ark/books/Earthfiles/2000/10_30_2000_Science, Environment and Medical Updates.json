The historic missionis scheduled to lift off on Tuesday, October 31st at 2:53 AM east coast time.Shepherd will be joined by two Russian cosmonauts, Yuri Gizenko and SergeiKrikalev. This expedition crew plans to spend nearly four months on the spacestation.NEAR Shoemaker Spacecraft Near Eros Asteroid Further out in the asteroid belt on October 26th, the NEAR Shoemakerspacecraft orbiting Eros got down to four miles above the asteroid's rockysurface. Scientist Scott Murchie said, \"What strikes me most about the picturesis the diversity in the sizes and shapes of the rocks.\" The smallest rocks so far areabout 5 feet long.West Nile Fever Virus Transmitted in Lab Without MosquitoesScientists at the U. S. Geological Survey labs in Madison, Wisconsin reportedthat birds infected with the West Nile Fever virus passed the disease to healthybirds in the lab - wi thout mosquitoes. Until now, researchers thought the virus -which so far has killed eight Americans - could be transmitted only throughmosquito bites. So far, no one understands how the virus was transmitted fromthe sick to the healthy birds. Or, what this could mean for the future spread ofWest Nile Fever in North America.25% of World's Coral Reefs Have Been Destroyed"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"- In the oceans, more than a quarter of the world's coral reefs have beendestroyed by pollution and global warming. That sobering statement came fromscientists gathered at a conference in Bali, Indonesia. Marine scientists warnedthat all remaining coral reefs could be dead in 20 years. Since coral reefs play acrucial role in marine ecosystems, their destruction could mean big andunpredictable trouble for ocean life.55 Cattle Dead in Roswell, New Mexico from Nitrate Poisoning- On October 18 at midnight, rancher Marcello Macias in Roswell, New Mexicochecked his heard of 55 cattle. All were alive and well inside a locked corral. Afew hours later at sunup, Mr. Macias discovered 23 of the pregnant cows, threebulls and four young calves all dead while the remaining cattle in the corralseemed fine. There were no signs of predators and all the cows drank the samewater and ate the same food.On Friday, October 27, the New Mexico Livestock Board issued this pressrelease:\"Dr. Steven England, New Mexico State Veterinarian, announcedtoday that ...the New Mexico Veterinary Diagnostic Services inconjunction with the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratoryin Amarillo have confirmed the cause of the deaths was nitratepoisoning. The source of the nitrate was probably \"Amaranthus,\"more commonly named 'red rooted pigweed' or 'careless weed' whichwas present in the hay which was fed to the cattle. Nitrate poisoningcan be rapidly fatal with death occurring within three to four hoursafter ingestion of a fatal dose.\"I talked with the local Roswell Veterinarian, Dr. Leonard Blach, who saidpigweed had been found knotted up in at least one of the hay bales which werethree or four years old. Mr. Macias explained that he got one hundred bales offour year old hay free of charge not long ago. New Mexico growers say that ifhay is stored correctly and covered well, it can last that long. But if it haspigweed or other nitrate-concentrating plants mixed in, nitrate concentrationincreases as the plants age. Nitrate poisoning alters an animal's blood, blockingoxygen absorption. So basically, cows suffocate. According to the New Mexicoveterinarians, that's what happened to half the herd in Marcello Macias'sRoswell corral.We b s it e s :http://www.nasa.govCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
