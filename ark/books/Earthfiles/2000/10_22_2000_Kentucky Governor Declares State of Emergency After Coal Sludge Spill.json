Seventy miles of waterways filled with 210 million gallonsof coal mine sludge headed for Ohio River after a slurry impoundment broke on October11.Photograph courtesy Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet.October 22, 2000 Frankfort, Kentucky - Kentucky Governor Paul E. Pattonvisited the Martin County site near Inez where an estimated 210 million gallonsof coal mine sludge collapsed into the Big Sandy and Cold Water Branches ofWolf Creek. Public water supplies in the town of Louisa and Martin CountyDistrict Number One were immediately polluted. On October 16, GovernorPatton declared a State of Emergency for ten counties \"in the wake of lastWednesday's failure of a Martin County coal slurry impoundment. ...Thedeclaration covers the counties of Boyd, Bracken, Carter, Fleming, Greenup,Lawrence, Lewis, Martin, Mason and Robertson, all lying within the Big Sandyand Ohio River watersheds.\" By October 22, at least seventy miles of waterwayswere filled with the cement-like sludge.According to the governor's Executive Order, \"public water supplies areexperiencing water shortages that are resulting in the disruption of essentialservices such as drinking water, basic sanitation and fire protection. Theseconditions are endangering the public health and safety and could result in"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"potential environmental damages.\"The Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Cabinet wasdirected by the Executive Order to take necessary actions to conserve waterresources in the affected watersheds.Interview:Heather Frederick, Public Information Officer, Kentucky NaturalResources and Environmental Protection Cabinet, Frankfort, Kentucky:\"There were two water systems in Kentucky that were initially affected: one is atown called Louisa. The area where they draw their water from was polluted bythis spill. For awhile, they were having to have water trucked into them. Now,they have constructed a temporary water intake on an unaffected area of theLevisa Fork and they have started pumping water. They will test the water to besure that it's safe for drinking and hopefully by the end of this weekend (October22), the folks will be cleared to drink the water again.IS IT TRUE THAT THE NATIONAL GUARD HAD TO BE BROUGHTIN TO BRING WATER TO LOUISiANA?The National Guard did assist in transporting water to Louisiana, yes.WHAT ABOUT OTHER COMMUNITIES SUCH AS ASHLAND THATHAS 30,000 PEOPLE?The other community that was initially impacted in Kentucky was the MartinCounty District No. 1 (Inez, KY). Fortunately, they had two weeks supply ofwater in their reservoir and have been able to continue to supply water to theresidents. But, the area where their water intake is was also contaminated by theslurry spill. And when I say contaminated, I mean polluted. So, they have beenconstructing a temporary intake that they will use to continue to obtain water.It's my understanding that the assembling of the pipe has been or will becompleted today and they will go through the same process of pumping waterand testing it to make sure it's safe for those folks to drink.IS IT TRUE THAT THIS ALMOST CEMENT-LIKE SLUDGE WASCOMING DOWN THE MIDDLE OF THE BIG SANDY RIVER ANDHEADED TOWARDS THE OHIO RIVER?Yes, and it still fills the Big Sandy River. Just the beginning of it has begun tomove into the Ohio. It's moving at about 1/2 mile an hour as it reaches the Ohio,so it's a very slow movement.HOW THREATENING TO FISH, WILDLIFE AND PEOPLE IS THISCOAL SPILL?We wouldn't advise anyone to go try to drink water out of the river, but I don'tthink they would want to when they saw it. But no water system is going tobring this water in and serve it up to people if it can't be treated to meet theestablished water quality standards.HAVE THERE BEEN ANY REPORTS OF FISH OR WILDLIFE BEINGKILLED?There have been dead fish sighted in the water. The problem is that in mostplaces this material is so heavy that the fish may be trapped underneath it. Andalso, they suffocate so they may be slowly dying as opposed to dying right awayand floating to the surface. There is almost no visibility in the water to be able totell how many fish are dead."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"HAVE THERE BEEN ANY REPORTS OF FISH OR WILDLIFE BEINGKILLED?There have been dead fish sighted in the water.

Andalso, they suffocate so they may be slowly dying as opposed to dying right awayand floating to the surface. There is almost no visibility in the water to be able totell how many fish are dead.Our next concern and what we're continuing to monitor right now is for thepublic water intake for the city of Ashland. We really can't predict what's goingto happen as the heavier portion of the plume starts to enter the Ohio. Clearly,this is not the type of situation we've ever dealt with before and there are a lot ofcharacteristics between the two rivers that could affect what happens here. We'reworking with the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers to monitor the situation and tryto determine how this material is going to behave once it impacts the Ohio River.Ashland has been developing a backup plan should that be needed. They havebeen cleaning barges that hold a half million gallons of water each and theywould send those barges upstream to obtain clean water and then bring thewater back to their water treatment plant and pump it into the intake so it couldbe treated and distributed to its customers.DO THEY HAVE ANY IDEA HOW LONG IT IS GOING TO TAKE FOR200 MILLION GALLONS OF THIS COAL SLURRY SLUDGE TOMOVE FROM THE BIG SANDY INTO THE OHIO?No. (laughs) Like I said, It's not the type of situation we've ever dealt withbefore. Factors like weather could play a role in that, how much the materialsolidifies could play a role in that. It entered the Big Sandy through tributariesand there is still material in those tributaries, too. So if we got a heavy rainfall, itwould just wash some of the material that has built up in those tributaries intothe Big Sandy. This could be something we're dealing with for quite some time.YOU SAY THIS IS AN UNPRECEDENTED SITUATION. I THINK THEMARTIN COUNTY COAL CORP. HAS BEEN ACTIVE IN THE STATEOF KENTUCKY FOR A LONG TIME. WHAT HAPPENED THATTHERE SHOULD BE SUCH A GIGANTIC SPILL?Obviously we are still investigating what happened and we're working with themand the Health and Safety Administration to determine that. Clearly, there wassome type of failure in the impoundment and we believe that that was caused bysubsidence in underground mine works that are adjacent to the impoundment.That's our best understanding of what might have happened, but it's somethingthat we're continuing to investigate. All I can tell you is that we inspected thatsite regularly. The inspections we have done for the past year have not foundany problems there.WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS GOING FORWARD NOW?We definitely want to get this cleaned up as quickly as possible and we'refocusing on how the best way is to do that and working with the coal companyon the best way to do that. Our other concern will be to continue to monitor themovement of this material as it enters the Ohio River and work with waterdistricts there.IN TERMS OF TOXINS FROM THE SLUDGE MOVING INTO THEWATER, HAVE ANY OF THE RESULTS SO FAR INDICATEDTOXICITY AND HOW LONG WILL THEY HAVE TO KEEPSAMPLING WATER TO DETERMINE THAT?There were some heavy metals present in the material they sampled, but thosemetals do not pose a hazard to public water supplies as long as they are properly"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"treated by the public water supplier.MEANING TO FILTER OUT?Right.\"More Information:Kentucky Natural Resources and Environmental Protection CabinetFax: 502-564-3354Office of Kentucky Governor Paul E.
