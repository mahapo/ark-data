Photograph courtesy European Space Agency and NASA.November 26, 2000 Madrid, Spain - Galaxies in collision have fascinatedscientists since 1877 when French astronomer Edouard Stephan discovered thefirst cluster that became known as Stephan's Quintet. The name applied to agroup of five galaxies (NGC7317, 7318A, 7318B, 7319 and 7320) about 270million light-years from earth in the constellation Pegasus. A sixth galaxy,NGC7320C, shown at the bottom of the above photograph, was originallythought to be part of the colliding cluster of galaxies. When its red shift(increasing wavelength emitted by receding celestial bodies) was measured in1961, it was moving away from earth much more slowly (800 km/second)compared to the other galaxies (6000 km/second). That puzzling and discordantmeasurement provoked some scientists to argue that red shift is not related todistance and that the universe was not expanding.As the puzzle persisted, another hypothesis emerged that NGC7320 is aforeground galaxy only 35 million light years away, that red shift does measuredistance and the universe is expanding. The Hubble Space Telescope nowconfirms with its detailed view of Stephan's Quintet that NGC7320 is definitelycloser than the more distant galaxies in collision.Spanish scientist Mariano Moles in Madrid has studied Stephan's Quintet formany years and says the Hubble resolution shows that the quintet is really a trioof NGC7317, 7318A and 7319 in collision. Further, Dr. Moles points out theirony that such potentially destructive galaxy collisions not only give rise to"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"clutches of new-born stars, but \"the incoming galaxies transfer energy to thegroup and so prevent the galaxies of the group from collapsing and mergingtogether totally.
