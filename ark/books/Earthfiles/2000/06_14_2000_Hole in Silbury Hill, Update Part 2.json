Photograph © 2000 Wiltshire Gazettteand Herald.June 14, 2000 Silbury Hill, Wiltshire, England - Continuing interview withthe Avebury Property Manager for the National Trust Estate in Wiltshireresponsible for the repair and preservation of the Neolithic Silbury Hill.Interview:Chris Gingell, Avebury Property Manager, National Trust Estate, Avebury,Wiltshire, England:\"HAVE YOU NOW GOT A TIME TABLE FOR WHEN YOU WOULDPUT REMOTE EQUIPMENT IN THERE TO PHOTOGRAPH?Not immediately. There are three stages to this sort of thing. When it first aroseon the 29th of May, when the shaft fell in, there was an immediate health andsafety issue and risk to the public safety. So that has been the first stage to placean engineered capping structure across the top of the shaft, much larger than thetop of the shaft."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"THOSE ARE THE METAL SHEETS THAT I'VE SEEN PHOTOGRAPHSTHAT YOU DRAGGED UP MAN TO MAN?Those are just the sheeting over. Actually a structure of girders and scaffolding,quite a heavy and substantial structure has been placed across the top of theshaft. That was the first stage.The second stage is to gather the information and that's where the photographicand other survey work that both the archaeologists and the engineers we've gotto help solve the problem finally will need. And that's started. There's a sitemeeting in more than a week's time where all that planning will be agreed.Then the third stage is, when you've recorded it, when you've found all theinformation you can, is the final stabilizing of the feature itself, both for publicsafety and of course to preserve the hill. Because interesting though the shaft is,it is exposing this ancient and wonderful prehistoric monument to the risk offurther erosion because undoubtedly the shaft will collapse further if left openfor any great length of time.HOW DO YOU REPAIR THIS HUGE HOLE? WHAT METHOD DOYOU USE? AND ASKING THAT, I HEARD YESTERDAY FROM SOMEPEOPLE WHO LIVE IN WILTSHIRE ABOUT IT AND THEY SAIDTHEY HAD HEARD YESTERDAY, THE 13TH OF JUNE ON SOMELOCAL RADIO PROGRAM, THAT THE NATIONAL TRUST OR SOMEONE IN BRITAIN HAD PROPOSED THAT THEY ACTUALLY FILLTHE HOLE UP WITH CEMENT?Oh, certainly, I think that's speculation. It's not one of the techniques thatNational Trust or English Heritage, the principal bodies involved in managingthe hill would have considered. I think cement or concrete is an unlikely choice.I can't say what material will be chosen as the final specification. But the mostlikely thing is the chalk, the material out of which the hill itself was made, willbe the chosen material to refill the shaft.Chris Gingell, Property Manager for the National Trust's Estate in Avebury,Wiltshire, England on May 29, 2000 during his visit to Silbury Hill to examinethe newly opened and unexpected hole on top of the 6,000 year old Neolithic mound.Photograph © 2000 by Wiltshire Gazette and Herald.6,000 YEARS AGO NEOLITHIC PEOPLE ARE SAID TO HAVE SOMEHOW WORKED HAND TO HAND IN RELAYS TO MAKE THISENORMOUS MOUND. BUT TODAY, HOW WOULD YOU GET"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"HUNDREDS OF TONS OF CHALK UP THERE AND DOWN INTOTHAT HOLE?A very serious possibility is to lift it in place by helicopter. Because any methodof hauling it or carrying it up the sides of the hill with conveyors or anything likethat is going to produce more disturbance to the hill itself than simply lifting itinto place by helicopter and running it into the shaft from some sort of chute.That's the sort of solution that engineers will come up for us.THE SIZE OF THE HILL, THE 7 X 7 X 34 FEET, THAT YOU JUSTMENTIONED, THAT WOULD FILL UP ABOUT FOUR LARGE DUMPTRUCKS. HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE FOR HELICOPTERS TOPUT THAT MUCH CHALK INTO THE HOLE?I'm afraid I couldn't say, but I imagine we would be talking about big liftinghelicopters like Chinooks and I couldn't tell you how much chalk they could liftat a time. But if the chalk or whatever material is used can be delivered close tothe site so that the helicopter is reloading and emptying on a fast sort of shuttleservice on to the hill, it shouldn't be too formidable a task. We do use this sort oftechnique for repair work in remote places.IN YOUR BEST EDUCATED GUESS, HOW LONG WILL IT BEBEFORE THE ACTUAL REPAIRS OF THE HOLE WILL TAKEPLACE?One of the things we've learned is that it's very important to consult very widely,not just about the technical method of repairing a site like this but of also aboutthe information that is gathered from it and to give people time to comment onthe methods we use and so on. There will be consultation at each stage in thework, so I wouldn't like to put a guesstimate of the time.DO YOU THINK THAT SILBURY HILL WILL BE CLOSED OFF INTHE CONDITION THAT IT'S IN NOW FOR ANOTHER 6 MONTHS?Remember that Silbury Hill has been closed to the public for 25 years. It's justthat the security measures are more rigorously maintained while this really quiteserious risk with the shaft in place. I'm sure it's everybody's intention that duringthis summer, the entire project will be completed. I have no doubt about that.But how, one, two or three months, I couldn't even begin to say.I WOULD THINK THAT PART OF THE CONCERN FOR THENATIONAL TRUST AS WELL AS THE WILTSHIRE COUNTY AREA ISTHAT SILBURY IS NOTED FOR WHAT SOME PEOPLE ARE SAY ASHAVING A CERTAIN KIND OF IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENTTHERE, WHAT EVER THESE LAYERS OF CHALK ARE ON THEINSIDE. SO, IT SEEMS NOW THAT YOUR CHALLENGE WOULD BE:HOW DO YOU REPRODUCE WHAT THE ORIGINAL BUILDERSABOUT 6,000 YEARS AGO DID WHEN YOU'RE NOT CERTAINWHAT THE INTENT OF SILBURY HILL WAS IN THE FIRST PLACE?Yes, I think you've got to accept that this vertical shaft dug in the 18th century, alot of material was lost over the side, just like the horizontal shaft or tunnelexcavated in the most recent one in the late 1960s by archaeologists. That thefill of those excavations will never be the same as the material around them. Alot of the original chalk fill has been lost through, from the 18th century shaftand you can't reconstruct that. You can't reconstruct with exactly the same typeof material containing the same environmental evidence and artifacts. It wouldbe a pastiche. And what is usually a more acceptable method is to repair it withsomething that is sympathetic to its character, to the character of the hill, but"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"which future generations of archaeologists will recognize as being a 21stCentury repair.IS IT TRUE THAT INSIDE OF SILBURY HILL WHEN THEY DID THEPREVIOUS HORIZONTAL EXCAVATION THAT THEY FOUNDTHERE WAS THIS UNIQUE LAYERING OF VARIOUS COLOREDCHALKS?Not so much colored chalk. No, the big distinction is between the very core ofthe mound, the first phase which consists of turf and gravelly soil which wasexcavated from a very wide area around Silbury Hill, several acres, and formsthis central core of the mound. And then the layers of chalk above. The chalkabove was simply excavated from the great quarry ditch which originallysurrounded the hill now filled with wet material. It has weathered in over thelast four and a half thousand years. But the chalk in the main (internal central)mound was all excavated from the site around. Yes, it was constructed in anumber of phases and there is some detail difference between each phase. Butthe chalk material is the same. The big distinction is between the turf core andthe chalk mound.THE TURF CORE ITSELF, WHEN YOU SAY TURF, YOU MEAN THECORE AT THE BOTTOM CENTER OF SILBURY IS SOIL ASOPPOSED TO CHALK?Yes, soil and grass itself just cut out into a turf as you might cut turf to lay agrass surface in your yard or something. It was a mound of turf and gravelly soiltypical of the valley floor around the hill.THAT'S WHAT THEY FOUND RIGHT AT THE CENTER?Yes, a very substantial mound, heavily compressed by the hill, by the weight ofthe chalk above it.BUT NO CHALK INSIDE OF THAT CENTRAL MOUND?Not significant quantities, no. It's principally a turf core.WITH ALL THE CHALK LAYERS ON TOP OF THAT UP TO 130FEET.Indeed.WERE ANY ARTIFACTS OF ANY KIND, BONES OR OTHER, EVERFOUND IN ANY OF THOSE PREVIOUS EXCAVATIONS?The big 1960's excavation found - like the other excavation almost nothing ofany significance in the core of the hill in the material that makes up the hillitself. But the quarry ditch which surrounded it did have quite a lot of bone andparticularly the red deer antler picks used in the construction of the monument,fragments of those. And in the upper part of the ditch, later material amongother things from the Romans that occupied this area.CAN YOU AS A HUMAN BEING AND AS AN ARCHAEOLOGISTSTAND AT THE BOTTOM OF THAT ENORMOUS HILL COVERING 5ACRES, 130 FEET HIGH MOUND, AND IMAGINE PUTTING ITTOGETHER WITH ANTLER PICKS?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"It seems an astonishing feature. Remember of course there have beenexperiments in modern times to do not on this scale but to create very largesections of earthworks using very primitive tools like that. If you look at the kindof engineering for example, the building of railways in Africa, in West Africa. Iunderstand it was quite common for big railway embankments to be built simplyusing hoes like agriculture hoes. It's a matter of teamwork which societies thatare used to laboring in the fields by hand to working by hand with very simpletools can produce astonishingly great works of engineering with remarkablysimple tools. And I think they compensate with the organization of their laborthe skill with which they do that for the simplicity of the tools they are using.IS THERE ANY TRUTH BY SOME OF THE PEOPLE IN THE SILBURYHILL AREA HAVE SAID THAT SOMEBODY LOOKING DOWN INTHE HOLE, I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS WHEN YOU WERE THEREOR NOT, THAT WITH FLASHLIGHTS THEY COULD SEE WHATAPPEARED TO BE A TUNNEL GOING OFF AT 30 DEGREES ORSOMETHING FROM THE MAIN SHAFT FURTHER INTO SILBURYHILL?No, from our studies at the surface, no, nothing like that we can observe.HAVE YOU EVER PERSONALLY BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY RADAROBSERVATION OVER SILBURY HILL AND THE AREA BETWEENSILBURY HILL AND THE WEST KENNETT LONG BARROW TO SEEIF THERE IS UNDERGROUND STRUCTURES OR TUNNELS THATMIGHT CONNECT BELOW SILBURY HILL TO THE WESTKENNETT LONG BARROW?No, there has been geophysical work including a certain amount of ground-sensing radar, although other techniques have been more extensively used in theAvebury area. There have been quite a large area surveyed in the area in thegeneral area of Silbury and West Kennett Long Barrow, but I'm not aware of asurvey designed specifically to answer that particular question. Remember thatany tunnel in that area would lie beneath the natural water table.\"More Information:The next scheduled meeting with engineers and archaeologists to discuss atimetable to photograph inside the hole and a probable helicopter airlift of chalkmaterial to fill up the hole is June 27, 2000.We b s it e s :http://www.thisiswiltshire.co.uk/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & Conditions"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Refund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
