C. at NASA Headquarters onThursday, June 22nd, to announce 250 photographs of widespread areas onMars that closely resemble gullies and springs of water on earth.Scientists are truly baffled by all the photographs in 120 Martian sites taken byNASA's Mars Global Surveyor. Some argue that water should not be able toexist at the low atmospheric pressure on the red planet. One planetary geologistfrom the U. S. Geological Survey, Michael Carr, said: \"My confidence is shaken.This does not fit with what I know from studying Mars for 31 years.\"Carr and other scientists have accepted that a lot of water flowed over Marsthree to four billion years ago. But these new high resolution photographs showsurface features that look like water was flowing there today."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Crater Wall in Noachis region of Mars showing possible springs of water in the crater wall.Photograph courtesy of NASA and Jet Propulsion Lab from Mars Global Surveyor.One of the planetary scientists at the press conference agrees about theirfreshness. Dr. Bruce Jakosky received his Ph.D. in Planetary Science from CalTech, is Professor of Geological and Planetary Science at the Laboratory forAtmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado in Boulder. Dr.Jakosky is also Director of the Center for Astrobiology at CU. After the pressconference, I talked to him about the surprising number of sites and detailedphotographs.Interview:Bruce Jakosky, Ph.D., Professor of Geological and Planetary Science,Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP), University ofColorado, Boulder, and Director of CU's Center for Astrobiology: \"Theyare so widespread and they don't seem to be connected up to a single type ofgeological feature, you know, like they are not all on the flanks of a singlevolcano or something like that. They don't seem to be connected to volcanoes atall. It just seems that they are widely distributed and that would seem to indicatethat there is a lot of water on Mars in the crust, that there is a lot of liquid waterin the very recent past, which is something we didn't know. And mostimportantly, perhaps, is that it's accessible at the surface. Nobody expected tofind liquid water this close to the surface, AT the surface in springs that areemanating from that shallow a depth. I think the geologists are struggling tofigure out how you can get water that close to the surface and in that quantity.But the images are compelling! I look at them, I looked at the hard copies inaddition to the ones that were on TV and in the press and they just look exactlylike small flood gullies on earth. It's hard to believe they could be anything else.WOULDN'T THEY HAVE TO BE RELATIVELY RECENT TO BEHOLDING UP WITH SUCH DEFINITION GIVEN THE DUST STORMSAND WIND AND ALL OF THAT ON MARS?Exactly. There are two things that say they are very recent. One is what you justsaid. The second is that they don't find any degraded ones, or they don't find"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"sand dunes or other features covering them up. These things are the top mostthings stratigraphically, which means they are the most recent event. If you try toput dates on it, it could be as recently as yesterday. And it can't be much olderthan a few tens of millions of years. But either way, ten million years is stillyesterday geologically.BUT YOU WOULD THINK IN TEN MILLION YEARS THAT ANY OFIT WOULD HAVE BEEN COVERED UP BY THE DUST STORMSTHAT WE HAVE SEEN PHOTOGRAPHED MANY TIMES JUST THISCENTURY.We can argue about that. The dust storms would cover it up quickly, but thewind could also strip off the dust. So, the fact that they don't seem to have anydust on them I don't think is conclusive.NOW IF YOU MAKE THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THEY LOOK SOFRESH AND THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN YESTERDAY, TO USE YOURWORD, AND THAT THERE IS SOME KIND OF MECHANISM INWHICH WATER IS BEING RELEASED AND THEN IS RIVELLINGDOWN IN SOME OF THESE AREAS THAT ARE PHOTOGRAPHED:HOW DOES THAT SQUARE WITH AN ATMOSPHERE THAT IS SOMUCH THINNER THAN THE EARTH'S THAT YOU WOULD EXPECTTHAT ANY WATER BREAKING TO THE SURFACE WOULD ALMOSTIMMEDIATELY EVAPORATE?Our expectations are based on relatively limited thinking in whatever data wehave available. Along with everybody else, I've been caught up in this idea thatMars is uniform and homogenous and has a cold surface and therefore, you'regoing to have to go down kilometers to find liquid water to find warm enoughtemperatures. But as soon as we saw these pictures, people were able to startthinking of ways that would allow liquid water that close to the surface. Forexample, the analogy that I use is if it's a freezing cold day outside, in order tokeep my pipes from freezing, I'll turn the faucet on a little bit. The water comesthrough the pipes more quickly than it can freeze. Similarly, if we have aconduit from depth to near the surface through which water is flowing, it canflow up to the surface more quickly than it can freeze. And you don't need avery big conduit. You don't need a very porous aquifer to allow that to happen.DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT BE LIKELY AND THAT THESE AREREALLY FRESH SPRINGS?Yes and yes. Now, let me give you a more detailed answer. One of the thingswe're finding as we learn more and more about Mars is that it's not the simpleplanet so much simpler than Earth that we always thought it was. Globally, itmay be simple compared to the Earth, but locally the geology is very complex."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Photograph of what looks like pooled water on Marscourtesy of NASA and Jet Propulsion Lab.FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE HAVE BEEN READINGABOUT THE CONTROVERSY OF WHAT MIGHT BE BACTERIAFOUND IN SOME METEORITES FROM MARS. WOULDN'T THISNEW POSSIBLE WATER EVIDENCE ACTUALLY SUPPORT AGREATER POSSIBILITY THAT THESE REALLY ARE FOSSILIZEDBACTERIA?The short answer is no. But let me give you a longer answer because if I just sayno, I'm missing the point of what you're really trying to ask. And that is: liquidwater is one of the key requirements for life and finding convincing evidence likethis for liquid water today, really. OK, ten million years ago. That's the same astoday. Finding present day evidence for liquid water says that life could exist onMars today. We've known that Mars has had liquid water for some time. Butwe've always thought it was 3 1/2 to 4 billion years ago rather than today. Inthat sense, we've been saying for a few years that maybe Mars had life early on,but without liquid water today, it would be very hard to sustain it. Finding theevidence for present day liquid water says that if there ever was life on Mars, itcould exist today, especially with the water being so widespread to have poppedup in so many different places on the planet. That says it's not a single isolatedreservoir of water tapped by one spring.WOULDN'T IT BE MORE SATISFYING FOR HUMANS TO REALIZETHAT THERE WAS LIFE ON AT LEAST ANOTHER PLANET IN OURSOLAR SYSTEM AND THERE IS A KIND OF PHILOSOPHICALANGST ABOUT BEING ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE?Exactly, that's the issue. It's one of those things that if we find even anotherexample of life elsewhere, even if it was microbial, that would be trulyprofound. It would be daunting to imagine that there is life elsewhere. But at thesame time, it would be just as daunting to imagine that we're alone. Either way,it's a big deal and finding out is important.HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT WILL BE BEFORE WE ACTUALLYPUT HUMAN SCIENTISTS OR ASTRONAUTS ON MARS WITH ASHOVEL, SO TO SPEAK, TO REALLY DIG INTO THIS?It will be a dozen years from the day we decide to do it. We could decide todaythat that's what we're going to do and then it will happen twelve years from now.We might not decide for twenty years and then it will happen thirty years fromnow.WE'RE IN JUNE OF 2000. COULD YOU GIVE AN OVERVIEW OFWHAT IS PLANNED OVER THE NEXT TEN OR TWELVE YEARS INTERMS OF ALREADY SLOTTED MISSIONS?Sure, but there is a lot of uncertainty. We are launching the new spacecraft toMars next year, in 2001. It's an orbiter and it's going to continue the globalreconnaissance that the Global Surveyor is doing right now. They are debatingwhether to send a spacecraft in 2003. They will make a decision next month.You know, with the loss of two spacecraft last year everything is in a littleturmoil. The 2003 spacecraft will be either an orbiter or a lander and theyhaven't even decided that.Downstream from that, they are in the middle of redefining what suite ofmissions they want to carry out, but the overall goals of the program are tounderstand the entire breadth of how Mars works as a planet and to addressspecifically the question about whether Mars ever had life and how that fits intothe global context of how Mars evolved. What's similar to the Earth and what'sdifferent from the Earth?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"It's anticipated that within the decade, we'll have a return of samples from thesurface of Mars to the Earth where we'll be able to investigate it in a lot moredetail about whether there is any evidence for ancient or present day life.YOU MEAN BY ROBOTICS?Yes. And there are no plans for human exploration, although everybody talksabout it.OVER THE ARC OF THE NEXT DECADE OR SO, IT WOULD BEONLY ROBOTIC MISSIONS IF WE CAN GET THEM THERE?Ye s . \"We b s it e s :http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/pictures/mars/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
