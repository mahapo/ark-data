The owner,Marshall Kisiak, runs close to 200 head on that pasture. Three days later onOctober 16, the bull was found dead with a pattern of neat and largely bloodlessexcisions from his head to his scrotum with no signs of struggle. Fern Belzil ofSt. Paul raised purebred cattle professionally. Now in retirement, he has taken aserious interest in the cattle mutilation mystery and has investigated severaldozen Alberta cases, including this recent bull death. He traveled to Derwent onOctober 19th to photograph the odd excisions.Interview:Fern Belzil, former purebred cattle breeder, St. Paul, Alberta, Canada:\"There was a fifteen to eighteen inch long cut on the stomach. The hide was allremoved. It was beautifully neat, like a surgical or laser cut."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Excision of penis sheath and surrounding hide in approximately 18 inch long oval.Darkened edge of cut consistent with other pathology reports of high heat.Photograph © 2000 by Fern Belzil.I thought at the time it looked like there had been some intense heat around theincision. But I wasn't sure. Then I went down and looked at the scrotum areaand it was gone and the penis was sticking out from this scrotum area betweenthe hind legs about 15 to 20 inches.Penile tissue pulled out from within abdomen through hole where scrotum had beenexcised.Three of bull's small teats were also excised in triangular pattern of small holes nearscrotum.Photograph © 2000 by Fern Belzil.I have never seen this before. I have seen where the penis is missing completely,but I've never seen this before where the entire organ is pulled out through thescrotum region. It is very odd.THERE ALSO APPEAR TO BE WHAT LOOKS LIKE HOLES NEARTHE EXCISION AND PENILE TISSUE.Those were the teats of the bull. A bull will have short teats and three of themwere removed. And it looked like a triangle shape.RIGHT, SO IN OTHER WORDS WHERE THESE MALE TEATS, SORTOF SMALL, WERE ON THIS BULL, THEY HAVE BEEN CUT DOWNNOT ONLY TO THE SURFACE OF THE HIDE BUT BELOW THESURFACE OF THE HIDE.That's right. It's unusual, too. It sort of proves it was not done by predators.WHAT ABOUT THE HEAD AREA?The left ear was missing and the tongue was missing. You see a stick in thepicture where we are keeping the mouth open to check on the tongue and theexcision of the tongue was very, very smooth. I've only seen a smooth incisionlike this one other time."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Bull's mouth propped open with stick. Six inches of tongue removed in smoothhalf moon cut. Some blood on lip tissue. Photograph © 2000 by Fern Belzil.WHEN YOU PROPPED THE MOUTH OPEN, WERE YOU SEEINGTHAT THE TONGUE HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM DEEP WITHINTHE THROAT?Not deep within the throat. About 6 inches into the mouth. I compare that towhen you scoop ice-cream, you get that smooth kind of half moon shape. That'swhat it looked like.WHAT ABOUT THE EAR?The ear was a very clean excision the same way. Really something to see. I wasvery surprised.YOU WERE SURPRISED HOW CLEAN THIS IS?Right. And completely dry. No blood or fluid inside ear holeLeft ear on Charlais bull cut off near scalp. Ear hole dry and devoid of blood.Photograph © 2000 by Fern Belzil.SIMILAR TO ONE OF YOUR PHOTOGRAPHS, I HAVE SEENMUTILATED ANIMALS AND MANY PHOTOGRAPHS OF THEM INWHICH ODD PATCHES OF HAIR AND HIDE ARE REMOVED FROMTHE BELLY OF THE ANIMAL.I've seen that in about 40% of the animals I've investigated. And in one case, itwasn't on the stomach but on the inside of the shoulder."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Patches of hair and skin removed from bull's belly near large excision of penissheath and hide. Photograph © 2000 by Fern Belzil.HAVE YOU TALKED WITH ANY OF THE LOCAL VETERINARIANSYOU HAVE ASSOCIATED WITH ABOUT THESE MISSING PATCHESOF HAIR AND HIDE ON THE BELLIES OF MUTILATED ANIMALS?Not really. The veterinarians in this area will not work with me. They are veryclosed minded about this. It's always predators to them and you can't talk aboutanything else. In many of the cases the hair is missing and the hide is very clean.There are what look like goose bumps with little red circles around the goosebumps.I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU ABOUT ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPH YOUSENT ME. IT SHOWS HANDS POINTING AT WILLOWS. WHAT ISTHAT IS BEING POINTED OUT?On those willows were little spots that appeared to me to be like blood. It wasabout a foot from the bull's rear end, the rectum area. I don't know how they gotthere.Ranch worker, Oscar Jackson, pointing out spatters on willowsthat resembled small blood spots. Photograph © 2000 by Fern Belzil.OVER THE YEARS, EYEWITNESSES HAVE DESCRIBED SEEINGANIMALS RAISED AND LOWERED IN PASTURES BYUNIDENTIFIED LIGHT BEAMS. MAYBE THE BULL WAS LOWEREDREAR FIRST AND SOME BLOOD SPATTERED THOSE WILLOWS.HOW MANY CATTLE ARE ON MARSHALL KISIAK'S RANCH?He had close to 200 head on that pasture, so he's not a small operator.THE BULL WAS THE ONLY ANIMAL EFFECTED SO FAR?Yeah. It's the only one.IN YOUR CONVERSATIONS WITH HIM, DID HE EVER HAVE AMUTILATION LIKE THIS BULL IN THAT AREA BEFORE?No, he hasn't. This is the first time he's seen it. The RCMP, Royal CanadianMounted Police, were involved in this. Marshall called them first, and theRCMP called a veterinarian to do a necropsy. Then they called me. The vet said"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the animal had died from pneumonia.WHAT'S INTERESTING TO ME AND A HEMATOLOGIST I'VEWORKED WITH IS THAT WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL CAUSES OFDEATH AS PNEUMONIA BECAUSE THERE IS INFLAMMATION INTHE LUNG TISSUE IN THESE ANIMALS OVER THE YEARS. BUTTHAT DOES NOT EXPLAIN THE BLOODLESS EXCISIONS OF THESAME PATTERN OF TISSUES.Exactly. Yes. There is another case in northern Alberta now that I'm waiting forphotographs. They said the lungs were mushy and so was the heart.HAS MR. KISIAK HEARD OF ANY NEIGHBORS HAVINGMUTILATIONS BEFORE?Not his neighbors, but this year it's really odd. See, Derwent where this Kisiaklives is mostly south of St. Paul and a little bit east. And in that area within 100miles, I've had four or five cases this year. But several years ago, it was north ofSt. Paul. We've had several cases. It shifted to this area this year for somereason.\"More Information:Blood splatters on willows will be analyzed by chemist and results will beposted in a future Earthfiles report.See books: An Alien Harvest and the two volumes, Glimpses of Other Realitieslisted in Earthfiles Shop and linked to amazon.com.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
