After the couple went to the ground to escape the low-flyinghelicopter, it pursued the bright yellow object again, both disappearing behind ahill. Then a second bright yellow aerial object appeared. The Sherwoodsvideotaped the helicopter and yellow object and learned that other people did,too. Frank Laumen, a researcher and photographer from Germany, was at thebridge in Allington and could see lights and a helicopter back toward EastKennett. He videotaped the interactions. Andy Buckley from Manchester,England was also on Martinsell Hill and videotaped helicopter and light activityabout the same time.Three days later on Thursday, August 3 in Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, frommorning into the afternoon four different helicopters with a yellow top, yellowbelly and numbers painted on the side such as 43, 44, 45 and 54 kept travelingbetween the East Field, West Stowell/Oare, Pickled Hill and Woodborough Hill.Where there were crop formations, the helicopters lowered several times as iflooking for something.British Army helicopter with yellow top and belly identified only as \"43\" flyingwith three other similar helicopters between East Field, West Stowell/Oare,Pickled Hill and Woodborough Hill on August 3, 2000.Photograph © 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"British Army helicopter descending over flower formation (discovered July 14, 2000) inEast Fieldduring aerial maneuvers by four helicopters flying between East Field, West Stowell/Oare,Pickled Hill andWoodborough Hill over several hours on August 3, 2000. Photograph © 2000 by LindaMoulton Howe.That day, there were also thunderstorms that caused flash flooding in roads andvalleys. But with all the persistent helicopter activity on the peculiar circlingroute around the four locations at the heart of the Wiltshire crop circlephenomenon, several of us decided that night we would stay up for a nightwatch from a parking area along the East Field that had clear viewing of KnapHill, Golden Ball Hill, Pickled Hill, Woodborough Hill and the lush ripe wheatfields in West Stowell.When seven of us gathered at the East Field site around 11 PM on August 3, thenight sky straight above us was perfectly clear as if all the rain had washed thesky clean. There was no moon. Others out to look were Carl Nevin, Geoff Stray,his friend, Tanya, Bob and Gil Nicholas and Gordan Stewart - all seasoned bydozens of night watches looking for the unusual amid the normal ebb and flowof airplane and satellite traffic. As the night wore on, misty fog settled along thehills. Eyes alone could not see through the fog. But I had with me asophisticated Night Vision scope loaned by a friend for my trip to England, anITT Night Vision F6015 with infrared capability that \"sees\" heat. Its lensmagnification was 3x. When I looked down the fields with that scope, tramlineswere clearly straight and dark in the gray-green lens typical of light gatheringscopes because the Night Vision scope was using heat as well as starlight todelineate features in the landscape around us.In the first couple of hours, the biggest light show was above our heads as brightmeteors flashed at the rate of about ten an hour. One was a large bollide thatstarted in the zenith seeming to come straight down toward Knap Hill beyondthe East Field and broke up into pieces as it neared the earth. Then around 1AM, three of us all said at the same time, \"Look! Did you see that red flash?\"The color was a pure red in the very black fog.I immediately looked through the Night Vision scope where the red flash hadbeen. To my shock, there now was a bright oval seeming to rest right above thecrop pulsing a beat each second. I passed the scope to the others and eachconfirmed he or she could see the bright oval pulsing. When the scope waspassed back to me, I was eager to look again at the strange object and wasfurther shocked when it jumped from the middle of the frame to the far right,then to the far left, then back to center and kept repeating the odd jumps. Again,I passed the scope to the others who all confirmed with their own astonishmentthat they could see the object jumping in the Night Vision scope even if none ofus could see anything in the dark mist."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Graphic depiction of pulsing, jumping oval object as seen in shades of grey-green in theNight Visionscope beginning around 1 AM on August 4, 2000.

Then, feeling light hearted, I saidout loud addressing the jumping object in the lens, \"Why don't you come closerso we can see what you are more clearly? We're not afraid. Please come closer.\"Immediately the oval flared up extremely brightly in the lens, turned into asquare of flickering brightness that reminded me of sunlight reflecting off amirror, and began to pulse faster and faster. Around the flickering square weretwo rings in the infrared frequency that seemed to pulse around the square.Simultaneously, my friends all yelled that they could see red light flare up againin the mist. One of them said, \"Linda, keep talking to it!\" So I did. I kept askingthe strange flickering brightness to come closer so we could see it better. Eachtime I and the others called out for the object to come closer, it brightened andintensified its pulsing in the scope. The others could see pulsing red in the shapeof a square.Graphic depiction of pulsing, jumping oval after it transformed to flickering square thatresembled sunlightreflecting off a mirror surrounded by two rings, an artifact of seeing object in infrared.Drawing © 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe.After about ten minutes of this peculiar interaction, in the Night Vision scope Isaw the square change back to the pulsing oval which began to dim. I called out,\"No, please don't go.\" And the object immediately flared back up again. Thatfading out, asking not to go, flaring back up and then dimming again continuedfor another several minutes. Then the object began to jump as it had in thebeginning and finally disappeared altogether."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"More Information:In July 1996, Bert Janssen and Janet Ossebaard from The Netherlands weresitting in a car at the foot of Golden Ball Hill very near the West Stowell field inwhich the August 3, 2000 object appeared. It was about 1:30 AM when theysaw an orange light at the edge of Tawsmead Copse across the road from theEast Field. Bert looked at the orange light through binoculars and described thelight as \"not a real steady light. It looked much more like a fire. The light wasalive like a fire is alive. Like a heartbeat ... (but) a steady, irregular pulse. It wasnot regular, but more like an open fire you look at the flames.\"We b s it e s :http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
