Budinger, Analytical Chemist © 2000.October 16, 2000 Chagrin Falls, Ohio - Retired analytical chemist Phyllis A. Budingernow operates her own independent lab, Frontier Analysis, Ltd., in Chagrin Falls, Ohio. InJuly 2000, she received from biophysicist W. C. Levengood two sets of the anomalousparticles collected from the Red Bluff, California mutilated bull's testicles and chest onJanuary 18, 1997.Phyllis took magnified photographs of the particles shown above as she began her analysisto identify them. In her July 31, 2000 Technical Service report to Dr. Levengood, shedescribed her procedure:“Infrared spectra were obtained from both samples as well as references ofhemoglobin and whole bloods using the Harrick SplitPea cell attached to aNicolet Avatar 360 spectrometer. The ATR crystal used was silicon.Microscope photographs were obtained from the Leica GZ6 stereomicroscopeinterfaced to a Kodak Digital Science MDS 120 camera. Additional SEM/EDXelemental information from the bull testicle sample was procured by Dr.Levengood and is included in this report for the purpose of consolidating allthe analytical data in one place. (See EDS spectrum before Conclusions.)Results:Infrared spectroscopy identifies both residue samples from the excised bull asbovine hemoglobin, a component of blood. Pertinent bands in the infrared"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"spectra of the samples compare to those in a reference of pure bovinehemoglobin purchased from Sigma Aldrich. Additionally, the spectrum of thebull (chest) side residue shows absorption in the C-H stretching region between2800-3000 (Superscript) cm-1. This absorption plus additional bands areenhanced in a difference spectrum generated between the bull testicle and sidespectra. The difference spectrum suggests a long chain glyceryl type ester.Following are the spectra of the two excised bull residues and a reference ofhemoglobin for comparison.”Infrared spectroscopy: “Bull Residue- Testicles” on top; “Bull Residue-Side”in middle; known samples of pure bovine hemoglobin purchased from SigmaAldrich for “Hemoglobin Reference” on bottom. Spectra providedby Phyllis A. Budinger, Analytical Chemist.Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of the particlescollected from bull's body showed major elements typical of hemoglobinsuch as carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O) and iron (Fe).“Conclusions:Both residues are identified as bovine hemoglobin, a component of blood. Itspresence suggests a processing of the whole blood has occurred at the excisionsite. Additionally, the chest area sample has a very small amount of possibly along chain glyceryl ester.The usual procedure for isolating hemoglobin from whole blood is rathercomplex. It involves separating red blood corpuscles from the lighter plasmacomponents by centrifugation. The plasma is siphoned off and ether is addedto the corpuscle paste, causing the cells to burst. Another centrifugationremoves the ruptured cell envelopes and leaves a clear red solution ofhemoglobin. (Merck Index, 12th Ed., S. Budabari, Ed., p. 794, # 4682, 1996)It is unlikely that a procedure such as this would be done on site (in the pasturefield). It is unknown how or why this occurred.”Credits"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
