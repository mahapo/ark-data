I think this energy comes from above.Not from the ground. It comes from above.\"-Frank Laumen, Crop Circle Researcher, GermanyMay 17, 2000 this formation was discovered in a field of barley at Doernbergclose to Zierenberg and Kassel, Germany. This was the third of nine formations in May.Photograph © 2000 by Frank Laumen.May 30, 2000 Kassel, Germany - Since May 1, 2000, nine mysterious cropformations have been discovered in Germany, the greatest number in one monthsince the phenomenon began to seriously show up in the world in 1990.The first formation found on May 1 by Frank Laumen was in Burghasungen nearKassel after a nightwatch by about twenty people, all looking in the oppositedirection. SEE Earthfiles.com Report on May 21, 2000 about mysteriousblackness. Behind them across a freeway in a field of yellow flowering oilseedrape appeared two circles connected by a curving pathway and surrounded byfour small grapeshot circles. All were neatly formed in the thick crop and in aphone interview recently, Frank Laumen told me there was no sign of anypathway through the crop. Blooming oilseed rape is particularly difficult tomove through and people will always leave green paths behind them amid theyellow flowers.Here is a sequence of photographs that Frank Laumen took the first of May inBurghasungen."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"A week later on May 9, 2000, a simple, perfect circle was found in more oilseedrape in Gut Rangen near Kassel. Frank told me, \"Kassel is a special place. Theres a famous building that stands on the top of a hill in Kassel built about threehundred years ago. The building looks a little bit like a pyramid and on top ofthe building is a big statue of Hercules, the son of Zeus in Greek mythology. Ifyou look on a map and start in the middle of Kassel and follow the hills, it willbe a line that crosses Bunghasengen and further south to other areas that havehad crop formations.\"Researchers are beginning to wonder if Kassel has a leyline relationship in theGermany geography that is not general public knowledge. In England where thecrop formation mystery has persisted over more than a decade with more than athousand formations, there are hundreds of stone circles, dolmens and megalithswhich do seem to be along magnetic leylines.May 9, 2000 at Gut Rangen near Kassel, a simple perfect circle in oilseed rape.Photograph © 2000 by Frank Laumen.Then in rapid succession formations were discovered on May 14th at Ehmen"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"near Braunschweig, Niedersachsen; May 17th at Doernberg near Zierenberg andKassel; May 20th at Niederrhein; then May 24th four formations came down infour different locations: Ehlen again near Kassel; Klein Kedingshagen nearStrahlsund, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern; Brandshagen near Strahlsund,Mecklenburg-Vorpommern; and Elfershausen again near Kassel.May 17, 2000 at Doernberg near Zierenberg and Kassel, in barley.Both photographs © 2000 by Frank Laumen.Diagram © 2000 by Dirk Moeller.Interview:Frank Laumen, Crop Circle Researcher and Photographer, Leverkusen,Germany: \"We have formations in the north, in east Germany on the East Seawe have two circles and north of Kasssel about 50 or 70 kilometers away.Yesterday, (May 27) we entered the field with the flower of life. But in thismoment, there came the farmer. He was so angry, it was not possible to talk withhim. He told everybody who entered the field, \"I will call the police and goaway.\" I think for two hours, he drove around the field and looked and cameback to the other car and made a picture of us. He drove away. It was impossibleto enter the field. It is so sad.\"HAVE THERE BEEN ANY AERIAL PHOTOS SO FAR?No, I hope I can fly next weekend because at the moment we have problemswith the weather. This formation we could not enter the field because this is thefield of the angry farmer. This is the problem. This is the same field we had last"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"year this beautiful spiral.SAME FIELD?Same field, every year in this same field, it's one field we have a crop circle inthis field every year.IS THIS WHY THE FARMER IS ANGRY? THAT THE FORMATIONSHAVE COME EVERY YEAR FOR THE PAST THREE OR FOURYEARS?I think he is angry because it's on his land. I think he is not angry if another field.It's his land and this makes problems for him.HAS HE CUT THIS FLOWER OF LIFE DOWN YET? OR IS IT STILLTHERE?The flower of life is still there and I hope he will not cut it because next week Iwill try to fly and make aerials.HAS HE CUT THIS FLOWER OF LIFE DOWN YET? OR IS IT STILLTHERE?The flower of life is still there and I hope he will not cut it because next week Iwill try to fly and make aerials.Also, that 5th formation south of Kassel 20 kilometers near Doernberg(photographs above)- every year we have one or two crop circles there and thiscrop circle is absolutely so close to the highway, it's impossible that no onecould miss seeing this crop circle.And at Burghasungen, it's very interesting. It's a very tiny place. But every yearsince 1996, we have a crop circle there.IT'S IN THAT AREA BETWEEN KASSEL AND THE ONE THAT HADTHE TWO CIRCLES AND CURVED PATH, YOU FOUND THATAFTER THE NIGHT THAT ALL OF YOU WERE ON A NIGHTWATCHAND SAW THAT PECULIAR BLACKNESS SETTLE OVER THE AREA.Yes, it was after this night that two circles were discovered and the whole nightwas very strange. Because two times, we saw this blackness comes from abovethe sky in the middle of the night after midnight. It was not a fog. It was strangebecause you could see a car. It comes along the street. But it was not fog. It wasdark. I cannot explain what it was. It was very strange.YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLACKNESS LIKE THAT BEFORE?I think it was two years ago in West Stowell. It was absolute black and absolutequiet. There was no noise of any birds. There was nothing. But it was not soblack as this night. It was very special here in Germany.JANET SAID YOU WENT OUT TRYING TO FIND THE FORMATIONIN THE DIRECTION OF THE VILLAGE DOWN BELOW, BUT YOUCOULDN'T AND YOU FOUND THE TWO CIRCLES WITH THECURVING PATH BEHIND WHERE YOU WERE ALL PARKED ONTHE OTHER SIDE OF THE FREEWAY.That's right. The formation was behind the highway and I think it was 500meters. It was the first time we had a crop circle in this field because the lastyears we've only had crop formations on the other side of the highway. This firsttime we had crop circle on this side of the highway and nobody watched thisfield. I think it's some type of joke. Everybody watched the fields and behind usappeared this crop circle! I think it's a little funny. (laughs)"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THERE WERE AT LEAST 20 OF YOU WATCHING DOWN IN THEVALLEY ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF WHERE THE FORMATIONCAME?That's right.YOU WENT INTO THIS RAPE SEED FORMATION AND YOU GOTTHERE ON THAT DAY. CAN YOU DESCRIBE FOR A NORTHAMERICAN AUDIENCE THAT IS NOT FAMILIAR WITH OILSEEDRAPE, WHAT IT IS LIKE TO GO IN A FIELD?It's not so easy to - when you walk in a field with wheat, it's very easy to putdown the crop. But in oilseed rape, it's very difficult. It's like a spider web. It'slike a web.ALL OF THE TANGLED BRANCHES.Yeah, that's right. Very difficult to put down the plants. Very difficult. When youwatch the areas of the formation that are exactly circles, there is no mistake.That's absolutely difficult for a human.MEANING THAT TO MAKE PERFECT CIRCLES IN OILSEED RAPEIS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR HUMANS TO DO?I don't know if it's impossible, but it's absolutely difficult to make it. I'm not sureit's impossible, but the chance for me in my opinion it's impossible to make aperfect circle.WHEN YOU GOT THERE TO THAT FIELD AND FOUND THATFORMATION, DID YOU FIND ANY EVIDENCE THAT ANYBODYHAD BEEN THERE BEFORE YOU?No, we didn't find any footsteps or anything else.BROKEN PLANTS?No, not the first day. It was absolutely perfect.DIDN'T THAT SEEM TO YOU TO INDICATE THAT HOWEVER THATFORMATION WAS MADE, IT HAD TO HAVE BEEN FROMSOMETHING COMING FROM ABOVE DOWN INTO THE OILSEEDRAPE?For me, it's no question, because I think this energy comes from above. Not fromthe ground. It comes from above.After the formation in Burghasungen, I was also in the second formation. It wasvery close to Zierenberg. It was a single circle and we all thought this circleappeared on the same night because the oilseed rape looked old. I think bothformations appeared in the same night.THAT YOU GUYS SAW THE BLACKNESS IN THE SKY.Yes, that's right.WHAT WOULD BE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE TWOFORMATIONS?I think 2 kilometers. (About a mile)WERE BOTH OF THESE FORMATIONS THEN BEHIND WHERE YOUWERE PARKED THAT NIGHT?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"\\No, the single circle was on the opposite side of the formation behind us.WAS THE CIRCLE DOWN IN THE VALLEY?The circle - it was possible to see it from the place where we were parked.SOMETHING MIGHT HAVE HAPPENED IN THE BLACKNESS INFRONT OF YOU THAT PRODUCED THE CIRCLE AND YOU STILLDID NOT SEE ANYTHING BUT BLACKNESS.All that we saw was blackness.A CIRCLE DID APPEAR THAT NIGHT APPARENTLY IN FRONT OFYOU AS WELL AS THE FORMATION IN BACK OF YOU?I think so. I think they were formed in the same night.THAT MEANS THAT EVEN IF PEOPLE WANT TO SEE THEMFORMED, AT LEAST THAT NIGHT WHATEVER HAPPENED THEENERGIES DID NOT ALLOW ITSELF TO BE SEEN.That's right. I think there - I think every crop formation that appears, it's a secret.(laughs) The energy is very deceptive.WHAT ARE THE REASONS YOU THINK THE ENERGIES COMEDOWN FROM ABOVE INTO THE FIELDS?Because there are so many sightings about lights and wind, strange winds, and Ithink it's coming from above. For me, there is no other explanation. When youlook at a crop circle and when you enter a crop circle you see the flattened cropwith a beautiful lay sometimes. There is no other explanation. You enter thiscrop formation. You think, 'No, there is no other explanation. It must be comingfrom above.'RIGHT. ESPECIALLY IN FORMATIONS AS YOU HAVE HAD INGERMANY THIS SPRING, THOSE FIRST TWO IN OILSEED RAPE INWHICH YOU WERE THERE YOURSELF AND YOU COULDN'T FINDANY PATH WAY OR EVIDENCE THAT ANYONE HAD BEEN THEREBEFORE YOU.We didn't find any footprints. We didn't find anything.THIS YEAR IS THE MOST FORMATIONS YOU'VE HAD IN THEKASSEL AREA SINCE IT BEGAN IN 1996?Yes. And I think the reason is that the first three weeks in May we had only sunand warm weather. I think the crop grows very fast when you compare it to thelast years. We had a very warm spring.BEAUTIFUL FIELDS?Yes, no wind damages. This is the first time we have no wind damages.FRANK, YOU HAVE BEEN STUDYING THESE FOR A LONG TIME.WHAT IS YOUR OWN PERSONAL OPINION NOW ABOUT WHAT ISBEHIND THE CREATION OF THE FORMATIONS?It's very difficult to explain. I think that crop circles show us there is more thanwhat we are thinking. We think this material world is all, but I think there ismore. When you are in a crop circle, you think, 'Wow!' It's very difficult toexplain. You have to enter a crop circle to see what I mean. It's very difficult toexplain. Because I saw my first crop formation in 1997 and it was the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Woodborough Rings, the Torus. And I thought, 'Wow, it's absolute brilliant tosee a crop circle!' And when you enter this crop circle, you think, 'No, it's notfrom humans. No human can make this crop circle. Absolute brilliant.'RIGHT, AND THAT TORUS REALLY WAS SOMETHING, ALL THOSEDOZEN THIN RINGS ALL BEAUTIFULLY CROSSING EACH OTHER.AND IF HUMANS AREN'T DOING THE TRULY MYSTERIOUSFORMATIONS, FRANK, WHAT, OR WHO, DO YOU THINK IS?That's a good question. The most people are making are aliens, but I'm not sure.I think there is more. It's some kind of intelligence, but I'm not sure what kind ofintelligence. It's very difficult. I'm not sure it's aliens. I think there is more. Itcould be the earth, the energy of the earth. Or you have so many times therelationships to the old kinds of ancient monuments and crop circle. There's arelationship between ancient monuments and crop circles.\"We b s it e s :http://www.franklaumen.de/Anfang.htmhttp://cropcircleconnector.com/Sorensen/PeterSorensen99.htmlhttp://194.200.2.248/~paul/search.cgi?d=uk00anCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
