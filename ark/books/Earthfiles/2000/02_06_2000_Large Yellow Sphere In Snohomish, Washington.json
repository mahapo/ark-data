The two previous evenings leading up to the new moonwere nearly as dark. And yet, a husband and wife driving along a ruralSnohomish, Washington road thought they saw the biggest, brightest full moonthey had ever seen low over the Snohomish River. Back in the 1970s, manyeyewitnesses throughout the United States, Canada and other parts of the worldreported seeing \"full moon\"-sized glowing spheres hovering over rivers, farmsand ranches. One area that has long had such reports, coupled with Sasquatchsightings and unusual animal deaths referred to as \"animal mutilations,\" isSnohomish, Washington in wilderness country northeast of Seattle.Marc Probst, a hazardous materials specialist who works for a roofing companyin nearby Everett, contacted me about the unusual object he and his wife saw onJanuary 4, 2000.Interview:Marc Probst, Hazardous Materials Specialist, Everett, Washington: \"Thelight that my wife and I saw - it wasn't anything like a disc or typical what youhear about flying saucers. But it was - we were driving up the hill coming home-we overlook the Snohomish valley and my wife said, 'Look!' And I glanced overand said, 'Oh, it's the moon.' Then I thought about it a second. It was a cloudynight. It was kind of hanging behind some trees.You're saying that this was something so large it looked like a full moon.It did. You know those pictures you see in Africa of the moon. It looked thatlarge. It was huge! It was real low to the ground over the river, maybe 100 to200 feet.What color?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"It was a yellowish...glowing I guess. Just stationery and just huge. We just gotglimpses of it. We finally pulled over, but there are trees, big pine trees wherewe were. So we drove up farther and we'd get a better look at it and then it justblinked out. It was just gone. We never got more than ten minutes from the timewe noticed it to the time it was gone.Did it seem to be focused on the River Or?Yes, it was hanging over the river, the Snohomish river in the valley.When you realized it couldn't be the full moon, did you begin to get anydistance relationship between where you were in the car and whetheer thiswas at the river not very far away?It was about a half a mile from where we were. And there was absolutely noquestion that it was the moon! It was low hanging over the river.Meaning that it was not the moon.It couldn't possibly have been the moon.If it were a half mile away, what do you think the diameter might be?Larger than my fist if I held it out. Way larger.\"More Information:When I was producing the television documentary A Strange Harvest in 1979 to1980 about unusual animal deaths known as animal mutalations, I interviewedlaw enforcement officials and ranchers who had also seen full-moon sizedglowing spheres. One, Lou Girodo, was the Chief Investigator for the DistrictAttorney's office in Trinidad, Colorado. On the record, Mr. Girodo described thenight in the 1970s that he and a deputy were parked on a hill for a clear view ofthe sky because Stapleton Airport in Denver had alerted them that anunidentified object was being tracked on radar going south toward Trinidad.What they saw stunned them.Lou said an object moved rapidly to a point over the valley in front of them andstopped dead still in the air a few hundred feet above the ground. \"It looked likea big, orange full moon.\" he told me. \"And then it did the damndest thing. Itsplit in two. There were two big, orange full moons hovering there. Then onetook off fast going north and the other went south. The deputy and I looked ateach other in disbelief. Not long after, the two big orange things came rushingback and merged back into one orange 'full moon.' Then that went straight downand disappeared, almost like it went into the ground. That shook us up.\"Please contact earthfiles@earthfiles.com if you have seen any unidentifiedaerial objects that resemble the \"full moon\" type observed by Marc Probst andhis wife in Snohomish, Washington.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
