Photographs courtesy www.mad-cow.org.November 26, 2000 Western Europe - On Friday, a shocked Germany andPortugal reported two new cases of mad cow disease that seems to be spreadingin Europe. Doctors think the brain destroying prions that cause loss of musclecontrol and progressive dementia originated in Great Britain after cattle weregiven feed containing the ground up remains of infected sheep. There is a formof mad cow disease known as Creutzfeldt-Jakob which enters humans who eatinfected meat. In England, 81 people have died of that disease since 1996.In France, two people have died, a third is dying from the Creutzfeldt-Jakobmicrobe, and a hundred cows have been infected. Recently French PresidentJacques Chirac requested a ban on using any cow remains in animal feed to helpprevent the increasing spread of mad cow disease. The French AgricultureMinistry announced that the restaurant delicacy, sweetbreads, will be bannedfrom sale to the public for an entire year. Sweetbreads are made from a cow'sthymus gland. Dozens of school districts in France and neighboring Geneva,Switzerland have also banned beef from school menus. Beef prices have plungedand several slaughterhouses have closed.Incineration of cow infected by mad cow disease.Photograph © 2000 by BBC News.Further, the Swiss Red Cross announced it was barring blood donations frompeople who spent more than six months in England between 1980 and 1996.

Diagnosis is made only by examination ofbrain tissue after death.Across the English Channel, the Financial Times reported that Britain's ratpopulation is at one of the highest levels on record. The National PestTechnicians Association said rats are building up resistance to rat poisons andare so smart they avoid deadly baits after seeing other rats die. The associationalso thinks global warming is allowing more rats to survive winters.Global Warming and how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has been thesubject of negotiations by more than 170 countries in The Hague, Netherlandsfor the last two weeks. But sadly, the European Union and the United Statescould not agree about how to implement the 1997 Kyoto treaty that calls for theworld's industrial countries to reduce their pollution levels by more than 5percent from 1990 levels.What nations can do next is uncertain at a time when many scientists warn thatglobal warming will cause temperatures to rise between 6 and 12 degrees overthis century. The predicted result is more violent storms, melt down of the polarice caps and rising sea levels.Intense thunderstorm courtesy National Severe Storms Laboratory, New Mexico.Global warming has also evolved hand in hand with ozone destruction at theNorth and South poles. This year the largest ozone hole on record at theAntarctic extended for the first time over the city of Punta Arenas in Chile,exposing humans, animals and plants to increased ultraviolet radiation whichcan cause skin cancer. Over the next four months, atmospheric scientists will bemonitoring what happens at the North Pole. Will the Arctic ozone hole also getbigger as winter takes hold and exposes more humans, animals and plants toincreased ultraviolet radiation?Is increasing ultraviolet radiation damaging amphibians?
