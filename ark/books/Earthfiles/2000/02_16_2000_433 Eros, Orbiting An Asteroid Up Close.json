NEAR moved into orbit around the 25 mile longasteroid on February 14, 2000 and took the first images from a range of 210 miles (330 km)above the asteroid's surface. Eros is about a hundred million miles from Earth in theasteroid beltbetween Earth and Mars. Photographs courtesy NASA and Applied PhysicsLaboratory, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland.February 16, 2000 Baltimore, Maryland - It looks a bit like a 25 mile long,five mile wide potato. In one photo, it even resembles a Dutch shoe. Called 433Eros, it's made out of iron and magnesium-bearing silicates and is now the focusof a NASA satellite called NEAR, Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous. NEARmoved into orbit around Eros on February 14 and will stay there for the nextyear. Eros is one of the biggest asteroids in our Solar System circling betweenthe earth and Mars. It's almost twice the size of Manhattan, measuring about 25miles long and nearly five miles wide."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Some scientists expected Eros to show jagged edges from breaking off otherrocky chunks in the asteroid belt - a belt of rocks presumed to be left over debrisfrom the Solar System's formation 4.5 billion years ago. Another speculation isthat perhaps a small planet might have existed between earth and Mars and beentorn apart by a collision or planetary forces.The first photographs of 433 Eros show a surprisingly smooth surface that iscovered with craters and even craters on craters. That suggests great age and nota freshly fragmented asteroid. \"The many craters visible serve as landmarks fornavigating the spacecraft. Mission operators observe such features from differentangles and use triangulation to calculate NEAR's position relative to the surfaceof Eros. The changes in position over time help to plot NEAR's course in orbit.\"While the orbit of Eros currently does not cross the earth's, asteroid orbits canbe influenced by Jupiter, Saturn and comets that come through the solar system.While the chance that Eros might strike earth is small, scientists say, there are alot more rocks big and small that could come our way and might put the earth inharm's way. That's why scientists and the Defense Department want to studyasteroids such as 433 Eros."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In fact, research in the 1990s by astrophysicist Jack Hills at the Los AlamosNational Laboratory in New Mexico suggests that asteroids big enough to doserious damage can strike our planet at any time, with almost no warning givenour current lack of knowledge about them. The consequences of an asteroidimpact on Earth by something the size of Eros, or even half as big, would becatastrophic.I asked Dr. Hills, while he is currently on sabbatical at the Space TelescopeScience Institute in Baltimore to study 433 Eros data along with other scientists,what concerns him most about potential asteroid threats to earth.Interview:Jack Hills, Ph.D., Astrophysicist, Theoretical Astrophysics Group, LosAlamos National Laboratory, New Mexico and on sabbatical at the SpaceTelescope Science Institute, Baltimore, Maryland: \"My primary concern isthat one of these objects is going to hit us and we won't know anything about it.My biggest surprise was how damaging a tsunami is. What's relevant is that weknow these objects exist. We certainly have the resources to find them. And thisis not being done. I see it as potential for absolutely catastrophe damage thoughit's very small in any given year. I'm just afraid one will come some time that'sserious.And sneak up on us?Yeah, unfortunately.Any special reason for scientists to focus on Eros now?It's one of the largest near earth asteroids. I guess I would have preferred asmaller and more typical one personally. But it is certainly the largest one. So,that may be of primary interest. And near earth also. It's not earth-crossing, soit's not going to hit us any time in the near future, although it could be nudgedinto an earth crossing or impact orbit in the future.Meaning that if something else comes through the solar system and hitsEros or any of the asteroids in the asteroid belt, there is a possibility of adeflection towards earth.That type of effect is not as important as the perturbations, the gravitationalperturbations, exerted by Jupiter and Saturn and to a lesser extent the earth andothers. Those gravitational perturbations gradually change the asteroid orbitsover a period of time. And that type of perturbation principally by Jupiter andSaturn could then pump an asteroid into an earth-crossing orbit, an impact orbit."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Where is Eros right now in relationship to where the earth is revolvingaround the sun?The closest approach of Eros is a little further out than the orbit of the earth. So,to make it into an earth impact orbit, it (orbit) would have to be a little moreeccentric and go a little bit closer towards the sun which is the type ofperturbation that Jupiter and Saturn tend to put on these objects.What is happening right now with the NEAR satellite and how far is itfrom the Eros asteroid?It's orbiting Eros (currently at about 210 miles). It's far enough away so thatgravitational perturbations produced by the fact that it's not spherical but kind ofa shoe-shaped or potato object doesn't wreck havoc with the orbit, but closeenough so the tidal field of the sun doesn't pull it (NEAR) away from Eros. It'sin a long, fairly safe orbit from Eros at this point.You were quoted as saying in your asteroid research that any can become a'sword of Damocles' and strike the earth at any time with almost nowarning. Could you elaborate?That doesn't apply to Eros.But to other asteroids?Yes, the difficulty is that there is a large number of earth-crossing asteroids, evenlarger than a kilometer across, that could end up killing a goodly fraction ofpeople on the earth, any one of those. The basic problem at this point is that weonly know and have cataloged a very small fraction of these objects. So any ofthese objects that are not cataloged or are not found yet, basically there ispotential that we would not know about them at all until just before they hit theatmosphere of the earth. So, they would be almost instantaneous without anywarning at all.So, there is no way for us to pick up by visual sight or other monitoringdevice an asteroid coming near earth and crossing our orbit?At the present time, there are telescopes not very many and not very big whichtake little frames using CCD camera of the sky in hopes of finding these objects.These are meant to find these objects years before hand and also to find thelarger ones. What they do actually is take a very small fraction of the sky eachmonth. They have to do that because they try to do long exposures to get veryfaint objects. The net result of that is if an object can't come then and is comingin right now and if it's outside of the frames they take each month, then they willmiss it totally. In particular, they tend to observe in the direction that is exactlythe opposite of the direction of the sun - not only because of the sun's brightnessbut those asteroids in that direction would look like full moons. If you lookedmore towards the sun, they would look more like crescent moons.For the same distance, it would be much fainter. So, in general the surveys arelimited to a very narrow cone in the direction exactly opposite the sun. So, ifthey came outside of that cone in the direction of the earth, we would miss it.And what is needed in addition to those types of surveys in my opinion is aseries of smaller cameras that would cover almost all the sky several times anight. Then it would be possible to see objects a few hundred meters acrossseveral weeks before impact. Unless they happened with very bad luck to comevery nearly in the direction of the sun. And I'm afraid that would be verydifficult to see at the present time.How does studying Eros help us understand how we might cope with afuture asteroid on a collision path with earth?Well, one of the things we do is to help determine how badly fractured it is, to"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"measure the porosity of it. If it were a solid rock, we pretty much know what it'sdensity is. If it has a lot of fractures in it, then if it's a rubble pile with just a dustlayer on it, its density would be much less than if it were a solid rock. And bymeasuring its average density you determine somewhat how badly fractured it is.And also by looking at the rate in which the object, the potato shape causes theorbit to be perturbed, you can say something also about the distribution of massin five of the asteroids. And that would also help us picture how badly fracturedit is.I mean, it's not ideal. Ideally, you would have some seismographs on the surfaceand then ping it and then look at the fractures that way. But this is a good start.Looking at the photographs of Eros, it appears to be very smooth wherethere are not a lot of crater impacts.You would expect rubble to collect around it with a layer of dust on top sinceit's a large earth-crossing asteroid that can pick up a lot of dust. The dust willmake the rock look smooth. If Eros were small with very little dust on it, then itwould look rougher.What about the issue of its having broken off of something even larger?It certainly looks like a fragment with a tortuous history! But, I think it'spremature to talk about the details at this point.Fragmentation, from an astrophysicist's point of view, involves trying todetermine whether the asteroid was broken off from something bigger andwhether or not it would break up a lot more if exploded by an atomicweapon trying to deflect it?That's right. It might already be what we call a rubble pile which means that it'sheld together by gravity, not by material strength basically a bunch of looseblocks that are held together with gravity. And then it has rubble filling in thecontact points and a layer of finer material, dust, eventually on top of that makesit look like a smooth object.It certainly has big chunks in it that are reasonably solid, but what may looksolid to the eye could have a lot of internal fractures in it. So strength is not verygreat and if you applied an explosion to it and hit it, then it would tend to comeapart at those fractures. And that's the main concern.Does the United States have any technology to counter an incomingasteroid?No. First and foremost, you have to know they are coming in. And then youhave to have the capabilities in hand that you can employ on a short enoughtime before they come in. So, we're just picking at it. Only a small fraction of theobjects have been found. They all have to be found, the larger ones. And at thesame time, we have to have the assets in place - at least to assemble them fastenough to deflect the object. Basically, nothing has been done on that latter endat all.How vulnerable do you think earth is?Well, we could all die tomorrow! We certainly are. An object several kilometersacross could hit the earth basically any time. That would cause a significantfraction of the earth to die. What we have going for us is that even though theamplitude or size of the disaster is huge, the probability of it occurring in thecurrent year, for instance, is very small. These large sized objects don't hit veryoften. We just don't know when the next one will hit.Primarily, my research has been focused on calculating the damage these objects"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"would do as a function of their size, so we get some better idea of what type ofresources we should put in to prevent these disasters from happening.The Eros asteroid is about 25 miles long. What would happen if it hit theearth?One half that size wiped out the dinosaurs. It would first of all probably producea crater about 500 kilometers, 300 miles, or so across.And then you would have the debris from that going out ten or twenty timesthat, big chunks of material. And then there would be a dust layer around theearth. The asteroid that killed off the dinosaurs left a layer of dust all around theearth about an inch thick. So, one this size is twice the size, twice the diameter,so it means about eight times the volume. So, instead of an inch layer of dust,you might expect eight inches of dust around the earth. And all this dust is up inthe atmosphere in the top of the atmosphere and settles down. There will betotal darkness on the earth. You can't see through eight inches of dust. Formonths! Maybe even years. So, the type of death that likely occurred in theCretaceus-Tertiary that killed off the dinosaurs would be even more severe. Outat twenty times the diameter of the crater, you would have these big chunkscoming in, probably continental fires.And if this happens to hit the ocean, it's likely to be even worse. In addition to acrater being produced, a large tsunami would be produced. We have made somecalculations that if a K-T impactor (like the one) that killed off the dinosaurs,for instance, hit in the middle of the Atlantic, the resulting tsunami would go allthe way across Florida. And even one 1/2 that size would go about half wayacross Florida and then inundate even the western one-sixth of Florida byhaving a wave go through Cuba and Florida. So, that's illustrative of what couldhappen.If something the size of Eros hit in the Atlantic Ocean, what would happen?We know that for something the size of the K-T impactor that killed off thedinosaurs, the waves go all the way up to the Appalachians. An Eros-sizedobject would create an even higher flood inland.The water from an Eros hitting the Atlantic would go past theAppalachians into the middle of the United States?No, I don't think so. It will just go higher up in the Appalachians, they wouldprotect it. We haven't made any calculations about what would happen in theGulf of Mexico. I'm sure it would go into Texas much more than something thesize of the K-T impactor. And the damage in Europe also would go up muchmore. But the Appalachians are like a barrier.The Yucatan Basin between the United States and the Yucatan Peninsula isconsidered to be a crater produced by whatever impacted 65 million yearsago and destroyed the dinosaurs, right?Yes. There is a crater there found by a Mexican oil company a few years ago oildrilling which was a crater left over from the K-T impactor that killed off thedinosaurs. It was known even before then that it had to have hit somewhere nearthe Caribbean because there were thick layers of debris - not just the 1-inchmaterial you find all over the earth - but thick layers that indicated that thecrater was somewhere in the Caribbean and big chunks of material had beenthrown out. So, we knew it was somewhere in there. Then the drilling foundthat. And other indications that that was the impact site as well, like theindications for tsunami along the coast of Mexico - the tsunami heightsapparently became larger and larger as the waves approached the crater.Your work and others' would imply that the impact on surface life isgreatly affected by the dust and debris that cuts off sunlight reaching the"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"earth's surface?That seemed to be the case for the dinosaurs, for the very large ones (asteroids).For the smaller ones, a few kilometers across there is also dust and that couldlead to mass starvation around the earth, particularly. in the undevelopedcountries. From where I work on tsunamis, for developed countries which havemore resources and animals that eat and the seed they would normally eat, theanimal would have much more reserve than undeveloped countries which arebasically just eating the grain itself. It would be less affected by the dust exceptfor the really big ones. And the tsunami might in fact be the worst thing thatcould happen - the water. It would scour even - one (asteroid) the size of theK-T impact hitting the Atlantic, it would basically scour the Eastern seaboard. Itwouldn't be habitable for maybe hundreds of years. There would be salt basinsthere. Everything would have to start all over again.Everything would be gone.Everything would be gone! Not just dust gently settling and everyone starving,but all the resources remaining. After a tsunami of that amplitude, there isnothing left in that area.The large crater in Arizona - what size object created that?That was very small. That was a nickel-iron meteorite and that is much strongerthan stone, so it penetrates much farther into the atmosphere before it startsbreaking up. When they break up, it spreads out and the atmosphere slows itdown. That object was probably between 20 and 60 meters across, a relativelysmall object.But that is a large crater.About a mile across. Not that large. It's a very clean, recent crater.If people had been living in the U. S. when that object landed in Arizona,how far away would the impact have been felt?The heavy debris would go out maybe 20 or 30 times the size of the crater, so20 to 30 times out you would have big chunks of material coming down fromthe sky.Would the ground shake?There would be an earthquake, but for that size object, it would be relativelysmall. And there is no significant amount of dust ejected into the atmosphere. Itwould be noticeable, but it certainly would not cause mass starvation. The worstthing that would come from that would be the shock wave which would go outmaybe tens of kilometers and basically flatten everything. A much smaller objectthat hit which was stone- and stone breaks up higher in the atmosphere - was inSiberia in 1908 in the Tunguska Valley in Central Siberia. And it basicallyflattened 20,000 square kilometers of forest which is much larger in area thanLos Angeles and it's about the same area as Mexico City which is the largest cityin the world. Much larger than Washington, D. C. or New York.It flattened everything.Yeah, it flattened everything in the forest.Why don't huge impact events happen more often?An object like that in Tunguska probably happens about every 300 years. Itrecovers quite easily. In Tunguska, it's in Siberia. You can still see the damage.There is no crater formed because it was stone and it broke up up in theatmosphere and the energy involved dissipated in the atmosphere."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"In case of the object in Arizona, it was about the same size object, but it wasstony iron, so it fragmented only a very short distance from the ground and madea crater. So that type of event as maybe every 50,000 years.The nickel-iron ones are more rare. They are only 3% of the total population.But those are the asteroids that could come around every 300 years?Yeah, something of that order and basically if they hit land, they would cause aflattening like that. If they hit the ocean because they dissipate their energy inthe atmosphere, they wouldn't produce very much, not a tsunami.The Defense Department indicates asteroids are enough threat to organizemore monitoring of Near Earth-crossing asteroids?I don't think there is going to be a coherent body such as the DefenseDepartment doing this. There is a realization that from the ground up there is aproblem and scientists like myself have been working on it and presenting theproblem. But as of now, there isn't any coherent body that has taken charge of itand said: here's the problem. Let's solve it. Which I wish would occur, but ithasn't occurred yet. There's some effort to find these through NASA, but mostlythe Air Force's Lincoln Labs - to find them. And there is some effort nowthrough NASA to look at a few of these objects, characterize them so we have abetter idea what they are like.You are saying that right now there is no official government body focusedaround the asteroid impact problem. Could there be a coalescence of amore formal government project around the Near Earth researchconnected with Eros?I think there should be and probably has to be some organization orcollaboration to solve the problem. For finding these objects, NASA has taken acertain amount of lead, but NASA is a research institution. It's not somethingthat funds long term studies. This is more like what the Air Force does for spacedebris. It has capabilities all around the earth to look for space debris andprobably could be refocused to look at five asteroids like Lincoln Labs is doingfor them.NASA is very good at research and development and for characterizing theseobjects we certainly need a NASA to go our and look at them as is being donefor Eros and studying their structure. Other things need to be done, I think, likelanding a seismograph on them and pinging on them so we know the internalstructure of them much better. And then on the other hand, we also need somecoherence so if we have these objects, we have the equipment in place or knowhow to put the equipment in place in a short enough time you actually deflectthese objects. And I think ultimately, it will have to be the Department ofDefense that will take the lead in this.You said earlier, we are vulnerable and are even more so if we do not get alist of what is out there that is large and could cross the earth's orbit.Otherwise, we're sort of flying blind around the sun not knowing what'sheaded our way.That's right. We're taking a chance. We're gambling. The right thing to do is tofind these objects. If hasn't occurred recently and maybe it won't occur in thenext few hundred years, but it could happen tomorrow. So, you have almostinfinite danger, but the probability in any given year is very small.What are the very nearest misses in the last few years?The ones we don't know about. In fact, we only know a very small fraction ofthe asteroid population. And there is an object the size that hit Tunguska in1908 and passes within the orbit of the moon every two weeks! And we know"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"only the smallest fraction of those objects. We're missing them, so even thoughthey are kilometers across, undoubtedly there have been encounters by acentury and we are simply blissfully ignorant of them.What would happen if something large hit the moon?That's no problem. These objects are very small compared to the orbit of themoon. They would produce craters and the moon is covered with numerouscraters from previous impacts. And it's still orbiting the earth at a safe distance.So another crater is not going to cause that much problem.But if objects pass within the orbit of the moon every couple of weeks andit's only about 242,000 miles from earth, what is the likelihood thatsomething big could come near the earth in the next 25 years?It depends on the size of the object. Something like the Tunguska one, there ispossibly one chance in ten that something that size will actually hit the earth in25 years. If you're talking about something a kilometer across, it's far less likely.Is there anything our government could do if we got a warning that akilometer-wide asteroid was suddenly coming our way?If we had just a few weeks all we could do is evacuate from the area. Time scaleis probably a few years right now because the equipment isn't locked in place totake care of it. People have made estimates that if there was a rocket with anuclear explosive on it ready to go, it could deflect asteroid with as little as aweek's warning if it's only one kilometer across. If it's several kilometers across,you would have to go several weeks warning and eventually if it gets larger, itwould have to be several months warning. But right now, the equipment is notin place, so the time table required is what it takes to get such a system set up.Which is years, unfortunately.Which is easier: Launch a missile from the earth to intercept and explodean in-coming asteroid? Or launch a vehicle toward the asteroid in order toland a deflecting device on the asteroid in outer space?It's much easier to put an explosive near it because then the vehicle would haveto slow down accurately for a landing. You just have to approach near theasteroid and set off the explosion.The percussion of the explosion could force the asteroid off in anotherorbital path?Basically the explosion, the shock wave, hits the asteroid and blows off material.So it acts like a rocket, all this debris flying off, and pushes the asteroid in theopposite direction.If we did have a warning tomorrow that something big was arriving in 6months, what is the first action humans could do?I don't think 6 months is enough time. If people were pushed hard enough, wemight be able to do something in 6 months. I think generally, we need a fewyears.So nothing could be done if we have only a few months?We can evacuate the immediate vicinity of the projected impact so therewouldn't be anyone in the vicinity of the crater. If it's hitting in the ocean, then itcertainly would be prudent to get people away from the water and up into highground. The number of deaths anyway would be mitigated. The economicdamage from a tsunami, for instance, would hardly be mitigated at all, or from acrater. You don't move buildings. So, that type of damage would be unaffected.You'd have to deflect the asteroid to prevent the economic damage."},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"If we had a year's warning, is there any technology we could apply now todeflect a large asteroid?Yeah, the explosives exist, the rockets exist, but they have to have the upperstages properly and the type of homing devices required for this mission tointercept. All this takes time and planning and it hasn't been done.Have we ever tried to do such an experiment out in space that's beenclassified from public knowledge?No, no. There was a program that was unfortunately vetoed by PresidentClinton. Clementine II which would have been a US Air Force mission andwould have gone to a number of asteroids and put probes into the asteroidwhich the mother craft would look at and see what affect it had on it.First goal of Clementine was to photograph the surface of the moon. Thesecond part was to photograph an asteroid, correct?Clementine I was launched to go to the moon and then be deflected out of theearth's orbit and intersect an asteroid. Unfortunately because of softwareproblems, it only did the moon. Clementine II was another mission, a totallyseparate mission, which would have gone to several Near Earth asteroids whichwould have been hit by the mother craft with a number of projectiles, probablythree or up to five. And these projectiles would be fired into the asteroid andthen the mother craft would photograph the impact sites to see how muchdamage was done. We were to study a number of asteroids that way and itwould have been practice for intersecting an asteroid.Why was it canceled?The concern of the Clinton Administration was that this looked too much likean anti-ballistic missile which they thought might violate international treaties.However, it would be intersecting these objects on time fields of months andyears. But for a missile, you're talking about minutes.\"We b s it e s :http://www.spaceref.com/focuson/near/http://www.space.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
