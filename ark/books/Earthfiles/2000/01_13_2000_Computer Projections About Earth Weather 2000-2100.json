So, they went to a climate expert Dr. Tom Wigley atthe National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado. Dr. Wigleyreceived his Ph.D. in Theoretical Physics from the University of Adelaide inAustralia in 1967 and has become a climate expert. The past six years he hasfocused on computer models of earth weather systems to project the effects ofever-increasing greenhouse gasses. Recently, Dr. Wigley's computer research wasreleased by the Pew Center.He presented two possible scenarios: one in which carbon dioxide emissionswould remain high over the next century. The other factored in cleaner energytechnologies. The computer conclusions?In the higher CO2 emission scenario, the average surface temperature of theearth increases about five degrees Fahrenheit and the sea level rises about twofeet.In the lower CO2 emission scenario, the average temperature increase is about3.5 degrees and sea level rises about 1 1/2 feet. Not much difference.The impact on temperatures and rainfall around the world can be summarizedthis way:Heating would not be uniform. North America would warm more than theglobal average.Northern latitudes would heat up more than southern ones. Cities such asNew York and Philadelphia would have climates more like North Carolina.Winters would become shorter.Northern growing seasons would lengthen and more crops would thrive."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Southern states might become so dry and hot that crops must be changed.Summer heat waves would become more dangerous as averagetemperatures and humidity shift upward.Both floods and droughts would increase in different parts of the world.The reason? The warmer the atmosphere becomes, the more moisture itcan hold. Water will evaporate from the land more quickly betweenstorms, but when it rains, the water will be much greater.Heavy downpours will not be absorbed by soil fast enough, so more flashflooding is predicted similar to what happened recently in South America.The heavier precipitation patterns mean that ironically, as the earth warmsmore over the next century, snowstorms could become heavier eventhough winters might be shorter.I talked with Dr. Wigley about his computer projections today and asked him ifhe was optimistic or pessimistic about our future in relationship to globalwarming, weather events and the impact on people.Interview:Tom Wigley, Ph.D., Climatologist, National Center for AtmosphericResearch, Boulder, Colorado: \"I'm neither optimistic nor pessimistic. I'mrealistic. I don't think we're going to respond rapidly to this problem, but I don'tthink we're heading for catastrophe. I think in North America and in Europe thatthe changes that are going to occur and I think certain changes are inevitable wecan respond to, we can adapt to. But there are other parts of the world that willnot be able to respond to what's going to happen. And these things are going tohappen no matter what we do. The real issue is: coastal environments, so thereare low lying island states, coastal areas that have inevitable sea level rises thatthey are going to cope with and I think that's going to be really difficult.So we're going to end up with peole who might be forced to move fromislands and low coastal areas because there is no option.That's true. And there are other problems as well and not just related to sea levelrise directly. But in a country like Bangladesh, for example, very low lying for alarge part of its area. It's affected by tropical storms in the Bay of Bengal. As sealevel rises, then the storm surges associated with those tropical storms are goingto be far more damaging. So, they are going to get it basically in spades.If storm surges and sea level rise threaten survival, where does a largecoastal population go?It's not just the huge population that's there now. But there's a very substantialpopulation growth rate in Bangladesh and many of these countries, too. So if wethink about what it might be like 30 years in the future, higher sea level, aremote possibility of stronger and more frequent tropical storms and perhapsdouble the population I just don't know how we can possibly cope withproblems like that. By we, I mean the global population. This is a globalproblem and we have to tackle the problem as a global community.One of the trigger points is that the Mediterranean basin, the southern part ofEurope, is almost certainly going to get a lot warmer and probably drier. So thatmeans that people around the Mediterranean Basin, people in Africa, forexample, are going to find that they are living in a climate that they cannot copewith. So, what do they do?Can we ever get to the point where we could artificially control weathersystems of the earth to cope with large areas of the planet not able tosustain food and habitation?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"That's another issue that has been explored to some degree it's the issue ofgeo-engineering. Can we engineer the climate to suit our needs? Well, right nowwe are performing an uncontrolled experiment and we don't really understandwhat's happening and we can't predict what's going to happen in the future.The uncontrolled experiment being our industrial emissions of carbondioxide into the atmosphere?Exactly. So, given the uncertainties there right now would be very dangerous totry to geo-engineer the climate. To actually deliberately try to do something tochange the climate because the possibility of predicting what might happen if wedo something deliberately is quite remote. That's just as difficult a problem aspredicting what's going to happen due to increasing greenhouse concentrations.Now, it might be that 10, 20, 30 years down into the future that we have bettermodels and we understand the systems better, that we could contemplateartificially modifying the climate to suit our own desires. That's not animpossibility. All things are possible. We get smarter as we go on.But tricky to do without causing even greater problems?Could be, but if we have good models and can predict what's going to happen,we decide what to do on the basis of those predictions.If the earth warms up 6 or more degrees F. over the next 100 years, itwould be six times warming in the previous century. Would storms scale upin energy as well?No, they wouldn't. To just give you one concrete example and I think it'smentioned in my Pew report.Hurricanes, according to some model predictions, would become more intense.In other words, the winds associated with hurricanes would be stronger. Butthey wouldn't be 5 times stronger. They might only be 5% stronger.Things do not scale up in that way, fortunately. You know, I'd hate to seehurricanes 5 times as strong. To do any scaling exercise, you have to look atweather now compared to weather 100 years ago. So, then you say: Are thewinds much stronger now compared with what they were 100 years ago? Andthe answer is, not noticeably.Are hurricanes more intense now than they were 100 years ago? And the answeris: not noticeably.\"More Information:A sign of the times - On January 7, 2000, the Waukegan News-Sun in Illinoishad this headline: \"Nicor buys insurance against warm weather.\" Nicor is anatural gas company headquartered in West Chicago.The story reads: \"For the first time, Nicor said it has purchased a weatherinsurance policy designed to protect the company from losses in the event ofunusually warm weather. The one year policy, which became effective January1, will pay Nicor when the weather is more than 6.5% warmer than normal. Thepolicy is being provided by North American Capacity Insurance Co. and willcost Nicor 1% of its earnings for 2000, according to Nicor spokesman LeeHaines.\"We b s it e s :http://www.pewclimate.org/projects/env_science_execsumm.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund PolicyCopyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
