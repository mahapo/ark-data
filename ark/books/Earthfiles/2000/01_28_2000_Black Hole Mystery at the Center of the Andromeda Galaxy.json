It usually gets very hot.So, this issort of a unique observation. I'm not aware of any otherblack hole systemswhere you see such cool x-ray radiation.\"- Eliot Quataert, Ph.D., Astrophysicist -January 28, 2000 Princeton, New Jersey - Observing x-ray and gamma rayemissions suggestive of a black hole at the center of many galaxies is old hatthese days for astrophysicists. Our own Milky Way galaxy seems to have oneand so does its nearby twin, the Andromeda galaxy. The suspected black hole atthe center of the Milky Way is two and a half times more massive than our sun.But a black hole candidate at the center of Andromeda is 30 million times moremassive than our sun.One of the signatures of a black hole should be intense emissions of x-rays andgamma rays as matter and gases are drawn into the black hole, heating up to veryhigh temperatures which can also be seen and measured. When NASA'sChandra X-ray Observatory took its first x-ray picture of Andromeda on October13, 1999, there were more than 100 individual X-ray sources at the center. Andone was located precisely at the galactic center where the black hole is thoughtto be."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"This is a color coded Chandra X-ray picture of the Andromeda galaxy's central region.The yellow objects are stars, most likely binaries or double suns. The blue colorat the center indicates temperatures cooler than the surrounding stars which surprisedastrophysicists who expected to see very hot temperatures. Photo courtesy NASA.The temperature data provided by Chandra's spectrometer showed the areawhere gasses and matter should be flowing into the black hole - the accretiondisk - was only one million degrees. That's very cool compared to other blackhole accretion disk temperatures. In fact, matter does not even register on anX-ray telescope until its temperature reaches about one million degrees. And theyellow suns in the Chandra X-ray image are ten million degrees. \"The Chandraobservation is telling us that an entirely different flow pattern could be operatingaround the Andromeda black hole. This could require a different class of modelsthan we usually consider.\"Interview:Eliot Quataert, Ph.D., Astrophysicist, Institute for Advanced Study,Princeton, New Jersey: \"How can black holes that suck in all matter andlight around them co-exist with stars at the center of galaxies?It's not really accurate to say that black holes suck in all matter and light aroundthem. For example, when you're far away from a black hole, the gravitationalforce that the black hole pulls on something is pretty much the same as anythingelse that had the same mass as the black hole. So, it's only when you get realclose to it where one starts to talk about how nothing can escape the black hole,even light can't get out. Where we are in the Milky Way on earth, there is nodanger of our being sucked into the black hole at the center of our galaxy. Thatwon't happen in the whole life time of the universe.No chance that our sun and solar system couuld be sucked into that blackhole?Right.What about the black hole in the constellation Cygnus near our solarsystem's position in the Milky Way Galaxy?It's called Cygnus X-1 and it was, I think, the first x-ray source to be discussedas a probable black hole.So that would be an example of a black hole out in the arms of a spiralgalaxy and not in the center?Right. This is also much smaller. This is a ten solar mass black hole, notmillions. So, this is quite different and formed by stellar evolution. You have areally massive star that burns, goes through nuclear fusion, uses up all of theavailable nuclear fuel and runs out of any source of heat to support itself againstgravity. Then at the end of its life if there is enough mass, the end state of thestar is that it will collapse into a black hole."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The black hole in Andromeda is 30 million times more massive than oursun. What would be the minimum distance from that black hole fromwhich matter and light would be pulled in?There's kind of a characteristic distance that determines where the force of theblack hole becomes more important than the force of the rest of the matter in thegalaxy and that is roughly a light year for the Andromeda Galaxy.Everything within one light year of that black hole at the center of theAndromeda Galaxy is being sucked into that black hole?No, that's where the force of the black hole is more important. You can actuallyhave a star that is perfectly happy even closer to the black hole than that on anorbit. It goes around and around the black hole.You can have a star with planets orbiting around it within a light year of ablack hole that is 30 times as massive as our sun and still orbit aroundwithout being sucked into it?Yes. I don't know about the planet part, but in principle, yes.Because masses can balance out each other?Right. Just like the earth revolving around the sun is in a stable orbit where it'sthe force of gravity that causes the earth to go around the sun. If you put a starnot to close to a black hole, you can get a similar orbit where the star is goinghappily around the black hole.At about one light year. (5,878 trillion miles, the distance that light reachestraveling in a vacuum for a period of one year at 186,000 miles/second.)Ye s .In between that star at one light year and the center of the black hole, whatwould be happening?There probably would be a lot of gas swirling into the black hole, heating up asit goes in and emitting a lot of (X-ray and gamma) radiation. The surface of ablack hole where matter and light begin to be drawn in is called the EventHorizon. And this is the radius where the force of gravity is stronger, so strongthat everything that is at that radius gets pulled into the black hole. The eventhorizon at the Andromeda black hole is estimated to be comparable to thedistance between the earth and the sun. Roughly an astronomical unit (A. U.).So, that's the distance at which the force of gravity is incredibly strong at theAndromeda black hole. But if you go much, much farther away from the blackhole than that - for instance, a light year, then the force felt by an object ispretty much the same as if you replaced a black hole with anything else that hada comparable mass. So a black hole is not going to eventually suck everythingup in the galaxy around it.Which I think is a popular conception.Yes, I think that is. I agree.This explains how it is ossible for you and other astrophysicists to keepfinding more and more black holes.All over.Black holes can live in harmony and balance with the rest of the matteruniverse.Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Which comes first, black holes or matter? There are white hole theories inwhich white hole matter comes from another universe or dimensionthrough black holes and creates this universe and the initial big bang.No, I don't think so. But this is very poorly understood how super massive blackholes at the center of galaxies are formed. It's not well understood. It probablyhas something to do with how galaxies are formed in the early universe billionsof years ago before you have much in the way of galaxies and stars. That's whenit's believed that these massive black holes formed.What is your personal opinion about whether the black holes come firstand then quasars, or quasars come first?Quasars are black holes, or are believed to be the accretion of matter into blackholes. So, I guess my belief is that probably quasars and black holes formedabout the time that galaxies formed.You're saying that a quasar in your definition now is a primordial blackhole in which there is a tremendous amount of matter swirling into it?Ye s .The matter is swirling into the black hole causing these enormousradiations of energy observed in quasars?Exactly. As it swirls in, it heats up. And as it heats up and things get hotter, theyemit a lot of radiation.If matter is going into the black hole, how could that contribute to thecreation of a galaxy?No, it doesn't contribute to the creation of a galaxy, but it probably happens atabout the same time that the galaxy is forming. So, you probably have early inthe universe several things happening. You start off with a big cloud of gas andsome of that gas goes to the center of the cloud and gets really dense and formsa black hole. Some of it forms stars. So you have at the same time the formationof a black hole at the center and stars around it. But this is not well understood.These are topics on which observations are just becoming relevant, so it's veryhard to say what is going on.So you have the big bang and whatever is happening in that gigantic energyand light explosion, are black holes created first before galaxies?No. You have the Big Bang and you wait a very long time before you have anystructure of any kind. For a long time, you just have a smooth distribution ofuniform gas. Then slowly at a later time - maybe a billion years later - you startto form stars, black holes. One of the outstanding questions is: were the firstthings that formed stars or black holes and that's not understood. My guess isstars because it's easier to form stars than black holes.Why would there be a black hole after the formation of stars?The general idea is that when you start to have lots of gas and stars at the centerof the galaxy which is fairly natural in any way of forming a galaxy, then thedensity of the gas, how much gas there is, starts to get larger and larger at thecenter. Eventually, it leads to a runaway situation in which there is so muchmatter at the center of the galaxy that the force of gravity becomes moreimportant than anything else. And that's when the gas and matter collapse toform a black hole.Would that mean that every single galaxy in this universe has a black holeat the center?I think that's a reasonable hypothesis - yes. From the observations of galaxies"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"pretty close to us, it does seem that the majority have black holes.What happens to all that matter at that accretion event horizon? Wheredoes it all go?(laughs) That's a good question. There isn't really a good answer to that in thephysical theories such as General Relativity and its theory of gravity. It says thatall the matter goes to a kind of point at the center, but that's not a verysatisfactory answer. The problem is there isn't really a theory of physics that candescribe what happens to the matter that gets to the center of the black hole.This is where General Relativity, which is the theory of gravity we have, starts tono longer be valid. And you need some new theory that combines quantummechanics and gravity. And until that theory comes along, it's essentiallyimpossible to say what happens. The leading hope right now is that StringTheory can reconcile quantum mechanics and gravity which is what you need todo if you want to understand what's happening at the center of a black hole.What is your own particular passion in all this?I'm particularly interested in what happens to matter when it falls into a blackhole. What can we tell from the radiation that we see from the vicinity of whatwe think is a black hole? What can we tell about what's going on?What do you think is happening?The general picture is that if you look at the center of a lot of galaxies, you see alot of emission, high energy emissions, x-rays, gamma rays, and this is generallybelieved to be due to matter that is swirling into the black hole. It's heating upand when it gets hot, it emits a lot of radiation.Even though it's emitting tremendous amounts of x-rays and gamma rays,it is not emitting light because the photons cannot escape the black hole.This radiation we're talking about is not coming from the black hole itself whichis a singularity in space/time. It's coming from the gas that falls into the blackhole. The black hole itself essentially doesn't emit any radiation.Why would the black hole at the center of Andromeda be cooler than thesurrounding stars?That's a very good question. Chandra's x-ray image of the cool temperatures inthe black hole at the center of the Andromeda galaxy kind of flies in the face ofwhat we think happens when matter falls into a black hole. It usually gets veryhot. So, this is sort of a unique observation. I'm not aware of any other blackhole systems where you see such cool x-ray radiation. Now we have to keepworking on mathematical models for how the gas might be falling into the blackhole and see if we can come up with one that matches the observed Chandradata.Andromeda could be unique?Yes, but it would be surprising if it were unique because there's not anythingobviously special about it. There's nothing clearly different that would say thatthis black hole should look different than others.Since Andromeda and Milky Way seem to resemble each other, assumingthey are pretty much similar, does that mean the black hole at the center ofthe Milky Way Galaxy should also be cooler?Chandra has also observed the black hole at the center of our galaxy and it doesnot appear to be this cool. There are other differences: the black hole at thecenter of our galaxy is about ten times less massive, about 2.5 solar masses, andhas quite a bit less energy emission."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"So basically there is an overall picture here that whether it is at thebeginning of the universe or now that any matter that condenses on itselfstrongly enough is going to create a black hole?Yes, if there are no other forces to support it. Exactly. So our sun doesn'tbecause it has pressure from matter supported against gravity, so it doesn'tcollapse. Eventually our sun will probably become a white dwarf. If you take astar that's, say, ten times more massive than the sun or twenty times moremassive than the sun, then you will probably end up with a neutron star. And ifyou take something that is 30 or 100 times more massive than the sun, thenyou'll probably end up with a black hole. That's the thinking.The brown dwarf, how does that come about?That's probably from the formation of stars. If you form something with notenough mass, less than a tenth of a solar mass, then you don't get hot enough toundergo nuclear fusion which is kind of the defining characteristic of a star.Brown dwarfs are suns that did not ignite, then?Yes. It's something that didn't become a star.\"More Information:At the recent American Astronomical Society meeting in Atlanta, Georgia, Dr.Douglas Richstone of the University of Michigan presented data about threeapparent gigantic black holes in Earth's neighborhood. The \"supermassive blackholes\" are in the constellations Virgo and Aries ranging from 50 million to 100million light years from our planet."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Images from Hubble Space Telescope courtesyastronomer Douglas Richstone, Ph.D., Univ. of Michigan, Ann Arbor,Michigan.Each of the black holes is between 50 million and 100 million times the mass ofour sun which puts them on a list of only twenty such massive black holesknown to exist. Exactly why such massive black holes have been produced insuspected star and galaxy formations is still not known.Stars that approach closely to the black hole without trespassing into the eventhorizon are sped up by its powerful gravitational pull. Measuring star speedsnear strong x-ray and gamma ray emissions suspected to be the massive blackholes helps scientists measure each black hole mass. In Aries NGC821, starshave been measured at 250 kilometers per second, or a half million miles perhour.We b s it e s :http://www.astro.lsa.umich.eduCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
