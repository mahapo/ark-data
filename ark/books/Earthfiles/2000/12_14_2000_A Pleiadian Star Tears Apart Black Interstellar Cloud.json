Hubble telescope photograph courtesy NASA, The Hubble Heritage Team,George Herbig and Theodore Simon, Institute for Astronomy, University of Hawaii.December 14, 2000 Hubble Space Telescope - In this new Hubble image, thestar Merope in the Pleiades cluster is just outside the frame on the upper right.Not far away in astronomical terms is a cloud of dust and gas referred to as\"Barnard's Merope Nebula,\" or IC 349. The cloud is being destroyed by thepassage of Merope. NASA says the beautiful and eerie light effect is produced\"like a flashlight beam shining off the wall of a cave. The star is reflecting lightoff the surface of pitch black clouds of cold gas laced with dust. These arecalled reflection nebulae.\" The parallel wisps extending from the lower left toupper right are explained by University of Hawaii astronomers, George Herbigand Theodore Simon, as dust particles slowed down by the strong starlight.Physicists call this phenomenon \"radiation pressure.\"The scientists theorize that \"smaller dust particles are slowed down more by theradiation pressure than the larger particles. Thus, as the cloud approaches thestar, there is a sifting of particles by size, much like grain thrown in the air toseparate wheat from chaff. The nearly straight lines pointing toward Merope arethus streams of larger particles, continuing on toward the star while the smallerdecelerated particles are left behind at the lower left of the picture.\"The Pleiades, or \"Seven Sisters\" of Greek mythology, are a small group of brightblue stars that resemble a dipper. The star cluster lies in the constellation Taurusat a distance of about 380 light-years from Earth and are clearly visible in thewinter sky.This collision between Merope's starlight and interstellar dark matter has never"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"been photographed so clearly before.
