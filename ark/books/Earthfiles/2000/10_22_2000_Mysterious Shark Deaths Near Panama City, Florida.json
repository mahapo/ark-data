Photograph © 2000 by John Brusher, National MarineFisheries Service.October 22, 2000 Panama City, Florida - More than a hundred blacktip andAtlantic sharpnose sharks were found October 16, 2000 dead and decayingalong a half mile of beach on the eastern side of Shell Island near Panama City,Florida. Marine biologists so far cannot explain the mass deaths of a ruggedspecies sometimes called \"living fossils\" because modern sharks arose during theJurassic Period between 135 and 190 million years ago. No one can rememberso many shark deaths at one time before.Panama City is the home of Tyndall AFB. In recent years, American underwatermilitary exercises have been targeted by environmental groups as the cause ofmany different marine species deaths. But currently, the only hypothesis underconsideration in tissue analyses at the Florida Marine Research Institute in St.Petersburg is the pernicious algae, red tide, even though no other marine animalswere affected.Marine biologist Enric Cortes, Ph.D., visited the beach on October 17 anddetermined that 85% of the dead sharks were blacktip and 15% Atlanticsharpnose.Interview:Enric Cortes, Ph.D., Research Fishery Biologist, NOAA/National Marine"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Fisheries Service, Panama City, Florida: \"I examined the animals andactually necropsied a number of them and did take some tissue samples whichwere sent to the Florida Marine Research Institute, a state agency, in St.Petersburg, Florida where they will be tested for red tide. The reason for that isthat there has been red tide detected in a number of places within the last fewweeks and there have been some fish, dead fish, a normal occurrence when thereis red tide, in a number of nearby areas. But where I saw the sharks, there wereonly dead sharks. There wasn't anything else dead.One small Atlantic sharpnose and two large blacktip sharks dead of unknown causes onShe ll Isla ndnear Panama City, Florida.

So, because of that, the explanation of red tide doesn't seem to make awhole lot of sense. Or other things such as low oxygen concentrations becauseyou would expect to see at least some other fish dead along with the sharks. Wecannot completely rule out red tide and hopefully those tests will tell us if it wasindeed due to red tide. But, the whole scenario was a little strange.In addition, if I might add, the animals had no signs of having interacted withany fishing gear, so the initial theory that perhaps they were discarded byfishermen doesn't seem to be possible.HOW UNUSUAL IS IT FOR UP TO 300 SHARKS TO HAVE A MASSDEATH?It's unusual. There may have been some event in the past. But it's not somethingthat is common at all with sharks.DOES THAT SUGGEST THEY POSSIBLY INGESTED SOMETHING INTHE WATER?I really don't know. The animals that I saw and examined had empty stomachswhich is common for sharks to have empty stomachs. So it doesn't seem to bethe case that they ingested any prey and the result of that they died. But perhapsthey went through a very high concentration of red tide and they died as a resultof that later. I don't know. It's speculation at this point. It could also be a viralinfection. But the shark's immune system is a very generalized one that seems tohandle disease fairly well.THAT'S WHY A MASS KILLING OF UP TO 300 IS SO UNUSUAL?Yes, it is.IF THE RED TIDE COMES BACK NEGATIVE?Then we may never know."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"UNLESS SHARKS KEEP DYING, IT'S NOT COST EFFECTIVE TOKEEP DOING LAB TESTS TO FIND OUT WHAT EXACTLYHAPPENED?You need to have fresh samples to do that and the only samples we had werethose used for red tide.UNLESS THIS HAPPENS AGAIN, THIS COULD REMAIN AMYSTERY?It could, yes. It could very well remain a mystery.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
