One of its x-ray images from October 1999 shows the Sirius A and B starsystem located 8.6 light years from Earth. The large central light is Sirius A, thebrightest star in the northern sky in optical light. Sirius B is a white dwarf that isten thousand times dimmer, but clearly shows up in x-rays. Because the twostars are so close together, Sirius B was not discovered until 1862 by AlvanClark using the best optical telescope in the world at the time. The pink sapphirepattern is produced by the satellite's transmission grating. For comparison,below is an optical image by Arizona's McDonald Observatory.Optical image of Sirius A and B by McDonald Observatory, Arizona.In 1976, author Robert K. G. Temple explored in The Sirius Mystery theattention that Sirius has had in several human cultures, including Egyptian,Sumerian and the Dogon tribe of Mali, Africa. The Dogon tribe for centuries hashad a mythology about the invisible \"smallest and heaviest of all the stars\"revolving around the large and bright visible star. In fact, the white dwarf, SiriusB, does have a mass equal to the mass of our sun packed into a diameter that is"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"90% of the earth's diameter. The gravity on the surface of Sirius B is 400,000times that of Earth.French anthropologists who had studied the Dogon in the early 20th Centurywere puzzled by the tribe's detailed knowledge of the invisible white dwarf. Thescientists said, \"The question has not been solved, nor even asked, of how menwith no instruments at their disposal could know the movements and certaincharacteristics of\" an invisible companion to Sirius.The Dogon believed that Sirius was the home of departed souls, which theearliest Egyptians also believed. Temple also speculated that the Dogon are\"descendants of Lemnian Greeks who claimed descent 'from the Argonauts,'went to Libya, migrated westwards as Garamantians (who were described byGreek historian Herodotus), were driven south, and after many, many centuriesreached the River Niger in Mali and intermarried with (locals).\"Pasadena, California - The lead author of the October 6 issue of Science, CalTech astronomer Maria Rosa Zapatero Osorio, says 18 \"young giant planets\" 5to 12 times more massive than Jupiter are drifting through the Sigma Orionis starcluster in the constellation Orion about 1500 light-years from Earth. The clusteris only about 1.5 million years old compared to our solar system's 5 billionyears.18 Planets drifting on their own through a star cluster namedSigma Orionis in the constellation Orion .Images courtesy California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California.Some scientists argue the eighteen strange objects aren't technically planetswhich traditionally are defined as dust and gas that condense into balls andrevolve around newborn stars. These huge, red, gas balls might be \"failed stars\"that require a new astronomical category. But where did they come from? Onespeculation is that they formed when a huge cloud of interstellar gas brokeapart. That's how stars are created, but these odd balls were perhaps too smalland cool to ignite into suns.These eighteen independent objects are the first planet-sized objects to be seendirectly from earth using visible and infrared light-detecting telescopes in Spain,the Canary Islands and Hawaii.Mt. Wilson near Los Angeles, California - On October 4, astronomers dedicateda new observatory called the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy(CHARA). The six telescope array at Mt. Wilson was built by Georgia StateUniversity with support from the National Science Foundation. CHARA willresolve details 200 times finer than is possible with the Hubble Space Telescope."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The National Science Foundation press release states, \"That's the equivalent ofbeing able to see the details of a nickel coin from a distance of 10,000 miles.\"NSF program manager James Breckinridge said, \"This will be the first timeastronomers can produce detailed images of the surfaces of stars other than oursun. We expect to learn more about the content and origin of stars and obtainclues about the sources of life on earth.\"We b s it e s :http://chandra.harvard.edu/http://www.science.org/http://www.chara.gsu.edu/CHARAhttp://www.nsf.gov/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
