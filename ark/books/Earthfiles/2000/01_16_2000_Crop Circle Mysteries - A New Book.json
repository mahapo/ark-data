She isa founding member of the Center for Crop Circle Studies and Chairman of theUnexplained Phenomena Research Society in the U. K. She is currentlycoordinating research into the effects of electromagnetic fields on living matterand has over six hundred reports in her data base.Diagrams of 1997 crop formations in England from Page 131,Crop Circles, The Greatest Mystery of Modern Times© 1999 by Lucy Pringle.One of Lucy Pringle's contributions in her new book are firsthand reports fromeyewitnesses who actually saw crop go down in front of them or around them in"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"a few seconds.One such event goes back to 1981 in Westbury, Wiltshire. Retired aircraftengineer, Ray Barnes, told Lucy that his attention \"was first drawn to a wave orline coming through the top of the cereal crop\" as if some invisible object orforce was touching all the seed heads making them jiggle, but not bending over.In addition, \"there was absolutely no wind, and the speed was constant. The linejust appeared moving across the wheat and there was no disturbance of hedge ortrees at the field boundary. The line almost disappeared where the ground dipsso it would seem it was maintaining a constant height irrespective of groundcontour. ... After traveling across the field at an arc, the 'line' dropped to theground and radially described a circle in a clockwise direction in approximatelyfour seconds. ...The crop in the circle went down as neatly as if it had been cutby a giant cookie cutter.\" The crops stayed flat to the ground. None sprang back.And that was ten years before the infamous hoaxers, Doug and Dave.In the1990s, biophysicist W. C. Levengood has studied hundreds of plants thatshow fundamental biophysical and biochemical changes that can not be hoaxed.This week, as her new book was released in North America, I talked with LucyPringle by phone at her Petersfield, Hampshire home about her research and Dr.Levengood's hypothesis that a spinning plasma vortex interacts with the plants.Interview:Lucy Pringle, Crop Circle Investigator and Author, Petersfield,Hampshire, U. K: \"You get this huge, enormous force that is not dissimilar toball lightning. We don't know an awful lot about ball lightning. But as a resultof this force that hits the ground, softens the plants at the base, we getmicrowave activity. What we don't know and what we can't explain and I thinkis the reason why we're still here examining this particular phenomenon, what isthe guiding hand? Whose guiding hand is behind these formations of theenormously and increasingly complex shapes?Yes, and what is creating the spinning plasma vortices?Well, this is something that we don't have an answer to. I think this is part of themystery. But also what is extremely exciting as far as I'm concerned is that myparticular part of research for the past decade has been looking into how theelectromagnetic fields or microwave radiation affects living systems. By that, Imean what happens to you and me and other animals when we go into genuinecrop formations and what happens to inanimate objects such as videos, cameras,mobile telephones? It's been very fascinating. (Equipment shuts off and batteriesdrain down quickly.)What seems to be happening is that we know microwaveradiation disrupts the central nervous system. What we don't know is the degreeof disruption to the central nervous system and this is something that needsintense and much greater research. This takes us into areas of mobile telephones.Are they safe? There has been a lot of research done at Bristol University whichindicates that they could possibly be a danger.In order to get this subject to stand up to the scrutiny of mainstream science, wehave to have definitive figures. And we've got to be able to have tests that we canrepeat year after year. And one thing that has shown up quite clearly is that ourhormone systems is being affected when people go into genuine crop circles.And I keep on saying 'genuine' crop circles because we know that there arehoaxed ones and I've done scientific tests in the hoaxed ones. We don't get anyof the scientific results that we get in the genuine ones.But going back to the hormone situation, this is exciting because we are gettingdefinitive figures. We are getting repeatable figures. It's showing that melatonin isbeing increased which shows us that our pineal gland is being stimulated. Thethyroid is affected which says that our pituitary gland is being affected. And thepituitary is actually the master gland which governs our whole endocrine system."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"We now know that there are impacts on humans, plants, soil, and animals.We also know this has been going on for decades, maybe centuries. Butstarting in 1990 and going through that decade, there has been anincreasing proliferation around the world with greater complexity. At thisjuncture, even though no one has definitive answers, what is your ownparticular sense of what could be the intent in all this?Yes, I have a sort of gut feeling that it's communication. Over the years, we havesent up messages to Mars and other places in order to try to establishcommunication. We send up universal language like binary and the signs of maleand female hoping they will be a universal language.I think the complexity - again, this is just a very personal observation or belief.Say, you know, when you are having a conversation with somebody and saythey look enormously bored and their eyes start to glaze over, you very quicklychange the subject. Or else, you move on and talk to somebody else. On theother hand, if you talk to somebody who is enormously interested in what you'resaying, you expound, you elaborate, you go into greater depth. And this seemsto me that the phenomenon is responding to human interest. Here, again we getthe interaction of consciousness between humans and other intelligences. And Ithink the impact - the interest started to expand tremendously in 1990. And thatwas when these shapes started developing. And they became more and morecomplex and the interest grew. The investigation became more intense. Moreand more people were drawn into the phenomenon. Many (scientists) are fearfulbecause this isn't accepted by mainstream science. They are fearful of theircareer prospects and that's why I have tremendous respect for Dr. Levengoodwho has shown his colors.He has been published in respected science journals.Absolutely.His hypothesis that spinning plasma energies are interacting with theplants and soil seems continually to be reinforced by new physical data.Isn't it ironic that in 2000 possible contact by another intelligence hasfocused on the earth's cereal crops? Further, that a story about two elderlygentlemen in southern England named Doug and Dave would have beenaccepted by mainstream media in 1991 as the explanation for a worldwidephenomenon. Why do you think that happened?(laughs) Well, I think the main reason for that is there was a general hysteria inEngland. It had reached almost fever pitch. And I think the powers that be werevery frightened of this. They were frightened of the implications. If these are notmanmade, then by whom or what? The intelligence behind it. What was goingon? That's like the UFO scenario. This seems to be an area that is not supposedto be discussed, which I think is a very great mistake and the more you coversomething up, the more likely it is to have frightening implications to people. Ithink this is what was happening. They tried to put a lid on it.And indeed, they were largely successful. I know my telephone calls wasabsolutely red hot. What's interesting is the complete dichotomy: 50% of peoplesaid, 'Thank goodness for that. Now we've got an explanation. Thank goodnessfor that.' Another 50% said, 'Could this be true? Could this really be true?' AndI said, 'No, it can't possibly be true. You only have to look at the logistics. It'shappened all over the world. All over England on the same night.'These two men had only claimed doing circles in two counties in southernEngland.That's right, but it took on. And I think a lot of people - if they don't understandsomething, they are extremely fearful. There are many people who can take thissubject on board. And I just wish more people could take it on board withoutbeing fearful because if you read the Bible and other parallel histories in India"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"and going back right to the dawn of our civilization - you will hear stories thatare really talking about visitors coming to this planet from somewhere else.Now, clearly they would have to have enormously good technology, far inadvance of anything we have. And they could annihilate us. The very fact theyhaven't done so over the ages says to me that these visitors are beneficial. Andwe have many indications in books written about all strange things that havehappened, all the technologies that appeared in the early days, that appearedfrom nowhere, to civilizations who up until that time had been primitive. Andsuddenly, they became advanced over night. How did that knowledge come?Who brought it with them? Where did those people go?It might even extend into other dimensional frequencies, time travel, otherincomprehensibles to current human society. But if we don't open up ourminds to all of the possibilities that could be behind this phenomenon, wecould deny ourselves the ability to ultimately understand it.I think you're absolutely right. I mean, we must consider that there are parallelworlds, other dimensions and these again are not frightening things. Just as allthe various levels of consciousness within our own physical. And again, I thinkyou are absolutely right that we have to open our minds. We're dealing withissues which are introducing a new aspect to science, but they are alsointroducing a very spiritual level. I think science without the spiritual level orwithout the heart is a very empty thing. And we need to bring in our spiritualaspects and understand that we are very small beings in a very enormousuniverse.And this I think is one of the extraordinary things. I've heard it so often. I'veexperienced it myself. And it's what I call the 'cathedral effect.' When I go intocertain formations, I feel that I'm in the presence of Something or Somebodyenormous. Just like when you go into a cathedral. You go in and treat it withenormous respect. And you feel strangely humble in the presence of somethingpretty awesome and pretty almighty.What are you expecting to happen in the fields in 2000?I don't know! Each year I try and think of something that is going to happen.Each year I can't begin to match what actually appears. It takes us all bysurprise. The ingenuity, the awesome geometry, the size, the imagination is quitebeyond the scale of human minds. So, I don't know.\"More Information:See the Earthfiles.com Shop to order Lucy Pringle's new book and her new2000 calendar.We b s it e s :http://home.clara.net/lucypringleCredits"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
