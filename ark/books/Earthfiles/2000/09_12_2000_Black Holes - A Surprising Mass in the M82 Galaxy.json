Theanomalous V-shaped brightening in the left frame is a transitory intensity of x-rays that areunidentified but typical of x-ray fluctuations.Chandra X-ray Observatory images courtesy of NASA/SAO/CXC.September 12, 2000 Washington, D. C. - Today at NASA headquarters in thenation's capitol, astrophysicists presented new x-ray images by the ChandraX-ray Observatory that indicate something with the mass of at least 500 of oursuns is packed into a region about the size of our moon in a nearby galaxy calledM82. Such concentrated mass is probably a black hole. And if so, it is the firstdiscovery of such a large black hole outside galactic centers. Until now,scientists have found evidence of small black holes only ten to twenty timesbigger than our sun (one solar mass) or massive ones millions of times moremassive than our sun, but only at the center of galaxies. This new discovery is atleast 600 light years from the center of M82 and could be a new type of blackhole that evolves and grows from the merger of many black holes. Further, thescientists reported that the intensity of the X-rays was rising and falling every600 seconds, a ten minute cycle. Cycles are more consistent with matter fallinginto a black hole than the collapse of one gigantic star.Why would any black holes be so close they could merge together? Could thishuge fluctuation be some other phenomenon other than a black hole? I askedDonald Kniffen, Ph.D., a gamma ray physicist who worked at the GoddardSpace Flight Center for 31 years and was Project Scientist on the ComptonGamma Ray Observatory when it was launched. Dr. Kniffen is now DeputyProgram Scientist for the Chandra X-Ray Observatory at NASA Headquarters inWashington, D. C.Interview:Donald Kniffen, Ph.D., Deputy Program Scientist, Chandra X-RayObservatory, NASA Headquarters, Washington, D. C: \"The reason why thisobject is of interest is that it is by far the brightest object with the greatest massin M-82.COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHY A BLACK HOLE CAN BE DEFINED BYA BRIGHT LIGHT OBJECT WHEN BLACK HOLES BY DEFINITIONABSORB PHOTONS?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"We're not seeing the black hole itself. What we're seeing is the result of mattersurrounding the black hole, circling around the black hole, heating up very hotand getting ready to fall in. Some of it will eventually spiral into the black hole.So, it's not directly the black hole itself you're seeing, but matter that is swirlingaround it getting very hot because of friction, so hot that it heats up to millionsof degrees where it will emit x-rays.WHY WOULD THIS HAVE INCREASED WITH SUCH INTENSITYOVER THE PAST THREE MONTHS?More in-falling matter. The characteristic of a black hole compared to asupernova which can also get very bright is that the supernova would get bright,flare up, and then have a continuous decay. And this one, they see it brighten upand dim and brighten up and dim. This has to do with the sort of spastic naturein which matter falls into the accretion disc and into the black hole.WHAT IS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDING THIS PARTICULARSIZED BLACK HOLE ALMOST AS IF BLACK HOLES COME INTHREE SIZES: SMALL, MEDIUM AND LARGE - AND THAT THISMEDIUM SIZE SEEMS TO BE POSSIBLY FILLING IN AHYPOTHESIZED ACCRETION OF MANY BLACK HOLES CREATINGA MEDIUM SIZED ONE?Yeah, a merging of several black holes - that is certainly one theory. It's notnecessarily the only way it could happen. As they said at the press conference,it's entirely possible, but not probable, that entirely new physics is involved hereand that we're seeing the collapse of a star much more massive than any we everknew existed. Or a process that leaves behind more mass. Maybe there is newphysics here that causes this to be so bright that it fakes us out into thinking it'sgot this much mass. This is all highly unlikely because the mass is determined intwo different ways here: one is just the brightness which scales with the mass.That is, the more mass, the brighter it is. And the other thing is the oscillationsthat occur in the accretion disc itself, like the ringing of a bell. They are theoscillations in brightness that occur. Those can also be used to make an estimateof the mass and the two estimates are in agreement.THIS M82 OBJECT IS HOW MANY SOLAR MASSES?A minimum of 500 solar masses. And a maximum, I think, of about 80,000 solarmasses as determined from the oscillations.THAT COMPARES TO THE GIGANTIC ONE AT THE CENTER OFGALAXIES WHICH ARE HOW BIG?Millions or billions even. (solar mass size)UP UNTIL NOW, YOU'VE EITHER HAD SMALL ISOLATED BLACKHOLES ...Yes, a few times our solar mass...OR THE GIGANTIC ONES AT THE CENTER OF GALAXIES.Ye s .WITH THE DISCOVERY OF M82, THIS SEEMS TO SUGGEST THATBLACK HOLES OR SOMETHING MIDWAY CAN BE CREATED INTHAT 500 TO THOUSANDS SOLAR MASS SIZE?Yes. By some processes yet to be determined, but the most likely one - at leastspeculated by the scientific panel, is the merging of smaller black holes. And thereason for that is that one of the things that is special about M82 is that it's a starburst galaxy, so there really should be a cluster of black holes there. The suns"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"are packed in fairly tightly and they have the opportunity to interact andcoalesce to form larger black holes.A STAR BURST GALAXY IS?One where a lot of stars are being formed.Star burst galaxy M82 that is filled with stars of all sizesand the probable consequence of their close evolution, multiple black holes.WHEN YOU HAVE A LOT OF STARS BEING FORMED FROM NEWGAS AND DUST, WHY IS THAT A BREEDING GROUND FOR BLACKHOLES AS WELL?Simply because the more massive the stars that are formed will live for a veryshort time and live through their life and then die out and they die out in aviolent event that would leave behind a black hole - a hypernova as we mightcall it where massive stars collapse to form massive black holes. If the apparentstar is above three solar masses or so, then it can form a black hole. So, all thosemassive stars - and we know there are lots of them up in the 10 to 20 solar massrange - will collapse at the end of their life to form a black hole and these areprecisely the ones that are going to go first. The more massive it is, the morequickly it burns out.THE MORE VIOLENT ITS COLLAPSE.Ye s .SINCE A BLACK HOLE IS BASICALLY PULLING INTO ITSELFEVERYTHING INCLUDING LIGHT, IF THERE IS A CLUSTER OFBLACK HOLES THEN IT'S GOING TO BE A QUESTION OF TUG ANDPULL OF WHICH BLACK HOLE SUCKS IN WHICH BLACK HOLE,SO TO SPEAK?Yeah, that's right. That's sort of a matter of chance, depending upon their relativespeeds to each other.M82 MAY BE THE FIRST DISCOVERY OF WHAT COULD BE THERESULT OF MULTIPLE BLACK HOLES MERGING?That's right.THAT'S WHY THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT DISCOVERY?Yeah, and it may give us some clues. Not having ever seen anything in this massrange before, it may give us some clues about how these super massive blackholes form. They may form by such coalescence as well. Or they may form inthe process of the galaxy formation. Or they may even precede the galaxyformation and this is how the galaxies actually form by matter that falls in"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"around the super massive black hole. We just don't know much about massivesuper hole formation and it's entirely possible that by seeing the formation andlearning about the formation of this intermediate mass type of object that wouldshed some light on that.THERE IS A MASSIVE BLACK HOLE AT THE CENTER OF THEMILKY WAY GALAXY, CORRECT?Probably so, yes.WHY DO WE NEED NOT WORRY ABOUT THE EARTH AND OURSOLAR SYSTEM NOT BEING SUCKED INTO A BLACK HOLE ATSOME POINT?It's just because of distance. There are lots of things tugging on the earth andsince the pull of these things falls off as one over r squared - all of the blackhole candidates that we know about are so far away that by the time the forcefalls off as the square of the distance, there are less massive objects closer bythat have at least as much pull or more so and this all sort of balances togetherwith our - you have to consider the fact that we are orbiting around the center ofthe galaxy, our solar system is, just as planets orbit around the sun.Why don't those planets fall into the sun? It's because they are orbiting. Theseblack holes are not so massive that we are orbiting about the black hole. We areorbiting around the dynamical center of our galaxy.THE PARADOX IS THAT WE ARE IN A UNIVERSE WHERE ITAPPEARS INCREASINGLY THAT BLACK HOLES ARE A RESULT OFSUN CREATION AND DEATH.Yes. It is sort of paradoxical and it's in part because we need more evidence thatthe M82 object could help us better understand black hole creation.\"We b s it e s :http://chandra.harvard.edu/http://chandra.nasa.gov/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
