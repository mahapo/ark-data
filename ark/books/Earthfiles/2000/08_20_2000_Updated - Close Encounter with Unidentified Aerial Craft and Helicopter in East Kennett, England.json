Drawing © 2000 by Kris Sherwood.August 20, 2000 East Kennett, Wiltshire, England - This weekend I learnedfrom crop circle researchers, Ed and Kris Sherwood of Millennium Research inSanta Monica, California, that when they were in Wiltshire this summer doing ameditation experiment, the couple had a close encounter with a helicopter andtwo unidentified aerial craft. The date was July 31st around 11:30 PM and thelocation was the East Kennett square inside a circle formation. Part of theirmeditation experiment was psychic photography, to photograph with a flashcamera the air around them in an effort to capture images of luminosities andtranslucent spheres that increasing numbers of people have photographed thepast several years. The exact source of the images is still a mystery. Their camerawas flashing in the darkness when they first heard a loud helicopterapproaching.Interview:Ed and Kris Sherwood, Millennium Research, Santa Monica, California:Ed: \"I became aware of the helicopter staying in one place and hovering at lowaltitude. Kris and I carried on flashing the camera taking pictures. Thensuddenly, another object appeared very close to the helicopter a couple of fieldsaway. This object had a very different light configuration than the helicopter.And it was completely silent. Instead of lights spaced apart that you wouldexpect at night with a helicopter, the lights were close together and large andkind of a yellowish-white color. They were flashing, too, but in a sequence thatwas very different from the helicopter."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Ed Sherwood's drawing of the odd yellow flashing object that was silent and followed bythehelicopter that shut its lights off when it approached him and Kris in the East Kennett cropformation.Drawing © 2000 by Ed Sherwood.This started basically at about 1,000 meters away from us, a couple of wheatfields away, and then very quickly began to move towards us. The object movedtowards us from across the field and the helicopter came with it. Perhaps 250feet beyond where we were, the object then turned to fly along and behind ahedge row we could clearly see and the helicopter then positioned itselfbetween us and the UFO. The helicopter stayed between us and the object as ifit were hedging the object in. All this happened very quickly.The helicopter at first seemed to be more preoccupied with the object and thencame in our direction straight at us. Just before it crossed the hedgerow wherethe object was behind and slowly moving up the hill, it turned out all of itslights...THE HELICOPTER?The helicopter. So, in one moment, it had several flashing lights and was veryloud. Then the next moment, it turned out all its lights just before it crossed thehedgerow and came into our field straight towards us. We suspect it had seen us.Kris: It was quite low over the crop, too. It was about eight to ten feet above theground and in the field with us and we could see a sideways silhouetteadvancing towards us, coming very close and aggressively. I was quite alarmed.Ed had experienced this before, but this was my first experience and going fromthe dead of night in a very quiet crop circle during this meditation. Then beforewe knew it, we were being approached by this large, dark, unlighted helicopterthat was even below the silhouette of the hilltops that are quite low and rollingand the helicopter was below the opposite hilltop from us. So, it was very lowand very dangerous.Ed: Yeah, I would say it was even lower than ten feet. To me, it was only two orthree feet above the crop. Once the helicopter crossed the hedgerow and shut offits lights, it came straight at us. And there was a moment when I said to Kris,'Get down in the crop, in the tramline!' I was kind of hoping the helicopter hadnot seen us and was doing some kind of maneuver to continue to hedge theobject in. But after a second or two, it was fairly obvious that it had spotted usand it was coming straight for us.I was about to stand up and flash a flash light at it to at least let it know that wewere there and on a direct course to us. It would have hit us. Just at thatmoment, it veered off suddenly to then fly straight towards where the object waswhich was slowly going up the slope of the hill behind the hedgerow. Quiteimpressive to see it flying behind the hedge and making no noise. This was alarge object. The helicopter itself was not a small helicopter. It was somethingthe size of a Black Hawk or maybe a Puma. It was not a small one. And theobject was at least the same size, if not larger. And to see the object moving"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"behind the hedgerow, which from our position was not more than 250 feetaway, passing behind the trees, lit up very brightly, flashing, but makingabsolutely no noise.AT THIS POINT, IS THE HELICOPTER STILL WITHOUT ITSLIGHTS?It was until it reached the hedgerow, and then as it hopped over the hedge torejoin the object staying between us and it, the lights all came back on again.But our experience is in two parts because right after this, the object flew below- this is the UFO - flew below the hill line and disappeared from view. It alsowas flying very low over the landscape with now the helicopter in tow. Thehelicopter was now a little way back because it had veered off to come towardsus. Then the first bright object disappeared beyond the hedgerow. The nextthing that happened was confusing and that's when I started to record with thevideo camera. Suddenly from the far left, at the top of the field, traveling downtowards where the object had been flying and to where the helicopter was nowproceeding - another luminous object appeared. It was a flashing object, large,very bright, yellowish-white color.At first I assumed it was another helicopter coming to intercept the very unusual,completely silent object we had just seen fly below the hill line along the hedge,but as seconds ticked on while we were taping this, we both realized that thiswas not just another helicopter coming or anything else we know. It was eitherthe first object suddenly coming back, and if so, it had covered a great distancevery quickly. Or, it was a second object, second UFO, which was alsocompletely silent now traveling down the hedgerow in the opposite direction.On film, we have this possibly second UFO flying left to right behind thehedgerow, coming down crossing the path - actually closer to us this time thanthe helicopter, but crossing the helicopter path which itself very quicklydisappeared behind the hedgerow and hill rise as if it were still following thefirst object. We could clearly hear the helicopter receding in the distance and Iassumed it was hotly pursuing the first object as the sound got dimmer anddimmer.Kris: And we have that on tape. On tape, you can clearly hear the helicoptermotor going from very close and loud and it recedes away gradually while thisother object approaches closer and moves to the right and makes absolutely nosound whatsoever and not a helicopter or anything we knew what it was.Ed: The helicopter had veered off its course to fly towards us and then it hadrejoined the object to follow it and the object had disappeared behind the hillline and then the helicopter did eventually and then gradually went off in thedistance. So, to us it was very confusing that the helicopter should just leave andthen another one appeared where the first one had disappeared.Kris: They looked identical, the light configuration on the objects in questionwere exactly the same and had the same flashing light sequence.Ed: We have this on film. You can see the hedgerow and the field we're in, andthe object after the helicopter has disappeared behind the hill rise and you canhear it recede in the distance and eventually you can't hear it at all - what is leftis this single, bright, flashing UFO traveling behind the hedgerow making nonoise, gliding very cleanly at very low altitude.The way this finishes, this object returned to the spot where the experiencebegan where the 1st object appeared with the helicopter. On the video film itblinks out. Then there are three quick bursts of a flashing light. And then it'sgone. This object was in front of hills that weren't far away and there wasnothing to block its view. So, either it turned off all its lights or vanished or"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"both.Sequence of events illustrated by Ed Sherwood for more clarity.Graphic © 2000 by Ed Sherwood.A) Large, low hovering, noisy, flashing military helicopter initially attracted ourattention to an area several fields away.B) Moments later a second object came into view with a very different flashinglight configuration making no noise. The lights were large, closely arranged, anda brilliant yellow/white color. The structure of the object could not be seen as itglided across the landscape at first coming towards us.C) Before the flashing 'UFO' reached the hedge separating the field that we werein from the one the object was in about 250 feet away, it veered off to our leftand began to glide parallel to the hedge, slowly climbing the hill rise, below treetop level approximately 25 feet off the ground.D) The flashing helicopter continued to follow and 'flank' the UFO and thenheaded straight towards us, only six to ten feet above the ground. As it enteredthe corner of the field we were in, it abruptly turned off all of its navigation andcockpit lights. The helicopter was medium sized, its type perhaps a Puma orBlack Hawk helicopter.E) Approximately fifty feet from us, the helicopter suddenly banked away andheaded back towards the UFO with its lights still off.F) The UFO slowly and silently continued up the hill behind the hedgerow.G) The helicopter caught up with the UFO and 'hopped' over the hedge before agroup of large trees. As it did this, it turned its flashing navigation lights back onagain.H) Moments after the helicopter caught up with the object, the UFOdisappeared below the hill rise behind the tall trees.At this point , Ed began videotaping the event with a Sony HI8 Handycam set toNight Vision mode.I) With the helicopter still in view, another (possibly the first?) flashing UFOappeared, traveling from left to right from the top of the field at speed towardsthe helicopter. Like the first object, it glided parallel to the hedgerow withoutmaking any noise.J) Behind the trees, the helicopter seemed to head away from us as if following"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the first object.K) At one point, the second UFO and helicopter appeared to cross paths,though in actuality the flashing helicopter was heading away from us (wesuspect it followed the first object we saw) and the second UFO. Moments later,the helicopter disappeared behind the hill rise and could be clearly heard by usto recede into the distance.L) The second UFO continued to flash and glide parallel to the hedge until it'blinked out' towards the bottom of the field.\"More Information:On Tuesday, August 22, 2000, Kris and Ed Sherwood sent a follow-up e-mailwith a photograph attached, an image they captured on a digital camera in theEast Kennett crop formation \"...only minutes before our experience with theunidentified aerial craft and helicopter.\"Shortly after arriving inside the crop circle formation, I sensed clairvoyantlywhat I have come to recognize as the psychokinetic 'presence' of the circlemaking intelligence above and at the edge of the 'square' inside the circle.Quickly taking several photographs towards this spot, Kris and I saw hundredsof bright luminosities of different sizes in the light of the camera flash.\"Digital camera with flash photograph taken at night on July 31, 2000 at East Kennettsquareinside a circle crop formation minutes before the unidentified yellow aerial object andhelicopter approached.Digital photograph © 2000 by Ed and Kris Sherwood.The Sherwoods videotaped the helicopter and yellow object and learned thatother people did, too. Frank Laumen, a researcher and photographer fromGermany, was at the bridge in Allington and could see lights and a helicopterback toward East Kennett. He videotaped the interactions. Andy Buckely fromManchester, England was also on Martinsell Hill and videotaped helicopter andlight activity about the same time.To communicate with Ed and Kris Sherwood:Millennium ResearchP. O.
