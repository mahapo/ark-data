Temperature graphic courtesyNOAA.June 18, 2000 Asheville, North Carolina - This weekend, the NationalOceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Climatic Data Centerannounced that this spring of 2000 has been the warmest on record for theUnited States. NOAA reports that during this spring season, \"every state in thecontinental U. S. was warmer than its long-term average. ... The extremely warmtemperatures contributed to worsening drought conditions in many areas of thecountry. Parts of the Southeast, Midwest and Southwest continue to experiencesevere to extreme drought, causing crop damage and creating the need for waterrationing in many areas. Twelve states averaged drier than normal for the springseason. Florida reported its fourth driest spring on record while Missouri had itseighth driest spring since 1895.\" This is not helping the Great Lakes region,either, where concern continues to deepen there about falling water levels, as Ireported on Dreamland recently.NOAA also reported that January through May 2000 was the hottest five monthperiod since record keeping began 106 years ago. Global warming IS upon us,but the exact reasons why - manmade or a natural variation in the earth's owncycles - is still hotly debated by scientists.Global temperatures were also very high. In fact, NOAA reports that spring 2000was the \"24th consecutive March to May period in which global temperatureswere warmer than the 1880-1999 long-term mean average.\" Paradoxically, in thetropics during this spring, it was the second COLDEST on record.Global warming could mean the spread of infectious diseases such as malariaand the West Nile Fever virus beyond their traditional borders. Recently, WestNile was suspected in a chicken from Queens, New York. Fortunately, bloodtests were not positive as of Monday, June 19, 2000. If West Nile does show upagain, New York health officials face the challenge of mosquito control,probably spraying with pesticides which can damage marine and other life."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"More Information:Climate Services DivisionNOAA/National Climatic Data Center151 Patton Avenue, Room 120Asheville, NC 28801-5001FAX: 828-271-4876PH: 828-271-4800We b s it e s :http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/http://www.noaa.gov/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
