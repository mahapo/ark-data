Never before in world archaeology hasany human habitation been found so deep under water. He has been usingsubmersible vessels to look for old river beds beneath the Black Sea wherepeople might have lived before a great flood inundated the region about 7000years ago turning it from fresh water to salt water and burying the surroundinglands under hundreds of feet of water. Using that river bed strategy, he found theremains of a stone house with fire place and grooved wooden beam.Grooved wooden beam next to cut stones used in building construction.Many ancient Middle Eastern cultures have legends of a great flood, includingthe Bible story of Noah escaping rising waters in a boat after a warning and"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"guidance by the god, Jehovah. A 20th Century edition of The Living Bible saysin Genesis Chapters 7 to 8 states:\"...the rain came down in mighty torrents from the sky and the subterraneanwaters burst forth upon the earth for forty days and nights. ... For forty days theroaring floods prevailed, covering the ground and lifting the boat high above theearth. As the water rose higher and higher above the ground, the boat floatedsafely upon it; until finally the water covered all the high mountains under thewhole heaven, standing twenty two feet and more above the highest peaks. ...theflood gradually receded until 150 days after it began the boat came to rest uponthe mountains of Ararat...\" which is in Turkey.In fact, it was a 1997 book entitled Noah's Flood by geologists Dr. Bill Ryanand Dr. Walter Pitman at Columbia University that gave Robert Ballard the ideato look along the Turkey coast for underwater river beds where humans mightonce have lived. But the Black Sea north of Turkey is a long way from theMiddle Eastern Mesopotamia homeland of Noah.Robert Ballard, Ph.D., Marine Geologist,Titanic wreck discoverer and Director of Institute for Exploration,Mystic, Connecticut.

I came here with two goals:1) One goal was to test a theory that has been proposed by two scientists atColumbia University suggesting that there was a great flood that occurred in theBlack Sea and that flood occurred when humans were living in the now-floodedarea.2) The second reason I came here was to search the deep waters of the BlackSea which are the largest body of water in the world that has no oxygen inhopes of finding some of the best preserved ancient ships.The first part of the expedition that we're on right now is focused on theRyan-Pitman theory. I'm hoping you know what that is or I'll give you a briefsynopsis. In the Ryan-Pitman theory, a great flood occurred 7,000 years ago andflooded the Black Sea with the Mediterranean water. Prior to this flood, theBlack Sea was 150 to 160 meters below the level of the Mediterranean and thatit was a fresh water lake. And then as a result of that flood, the Black Sea rosesuddenly inundating 150,000 square kilometers of land and converted the BlackSea from a fresh water lake to a salt water sea.I'll deal with that first and then we'll talk about the human aspects of it. Wecame in last summer with National Geographic and we found that ancient shoreline at a depth where they said it was. We collected shells from that beach andwe had those shells analyzed by specialists on shells. The specialists whoanalyzed those shells told us we had two collection of shells. We had a group ofshells that were salt water shells and their closest affinity was to theMediterranean. They said that we had a second - and the person who did this isDr. Gary Rosenberg at the Museum of Natural History in Philadelphia. He toldus we had two collection of shells: the first being salt water and the secondbeing fresh water. He said not only are the second fresh water, but they areextinct, are gone.We then took that shell collection and sent them to the Woods HoleOceanographic Institution and asked their Carbon 14 laboratories to date thoseshells. They told us that the shells were between 2,000 and 15,000 years in age.They said that the shells, the fresh water shells, were from 15,000 years ago upto 7,400 years ago B. P., before present. They said the salt water shells werefrom 2,000 years ago up to the oldest being 6,400.In other words, we had a sudden conversion of the Black Sea from a fresh waterto a salt water sea exactly as Ryan and Pitman proposed. We did see, though, inour data - and this might just be an artifact of our data - a 600 year gap betweenour youngest fresh water shell and our oldest salt water. In other words, howfast did this occur? In geologic time, it occurred very rapidly. But in humancontext, did it occur very rapidly?Our data says, we cannot say it occurred over night. Or that it occurred in 40days and 40 nights. Our data says it's no more than 600 years, but it could befaster. So, that we know.We then came out this summer to search for an area in the Black Sea that wouldbe most optimum for human habitation. What we did is that we took a map ofthe Black Sea and we drained it to this ancient shore line exposing 150 squarekilometers of land. Along the coast of the Black Sea, most of that land is steepcliffs. So, clearly it was not ideal for human habitation. But we did find a verylarge area of about 200 square miles where at that ancient lake you could goashore and find a rolling and inhabitable countryside with streams meandering"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"across it. We then put down our sonar system and began searching for targets.There are many targets in this area. You have rock outcrops. You have sunkenships. You have trash that people throw overboard, 55 gallon drums and so on.So we have to wade through all of these targets, which we did.But we found one target and one target only that was distinctively different fromall the rest. And that target was rectangular in shape, 4 meters by 15 meters insize and we then pulled the sonar and went down to investigate that target. Andwhat did we see at that target? We saw crafted wood, notched and cut. We sawimplements that were drilled implements. We saw stone slabs that had beenarranged.Cut stones used to construct structure 7,000 years ago in land now 300 feet below thesurfaceof the Black Sea north of Sinop, Turkey. Photograph © 2000 Institute forExploration/National Geographic Society.In other words, we saw evidence of human activity. So, from what we have seenthus far, we can say safely that we have found evidence of human habitationprior to the flooding of that surface. But that's all we can say right now. We havenot recovered any of the artifacts. We have not dated the wood we see there.And those are the silver bullets that can still be fired through the heart of thistheory. And we want to go and recover that wood. We want to recover thoseartifacts. But we can only do so with the permission of the Turkey governmentand we have yet to go down and do the necessary documentation that willpermit us to do that recovery. So that's where we are.Right now what we are doing is we are back down searching for targets that looklike this other one to see if we can find more. We've searched a small area andwe hope over the next several days, we'll search 4 to 5 times more than we'vesearched already. And that we will find other targets. But right now we haveone.Reporters wanted to know if this evidence of a Black Sea flood 7,000 years agomight relate to the Noah's Ark story in the Bible.Frederick Hiebert, Ph.D., Professor of Anthropology and Archaeology,University of Pennsylvania and Chief Archaeologist from Black Sea nearSinop, Turkey: \"I think one of the surprising things is that because we've allbeen compelled by the story of flooding in the Bible and the stories that are sofamiliar to our way of life, one of the surprising things for me as ananthropologist and an archaeologist, is to see how different this Black Sea worldis from the world responsible for these myths. There is a Biblical world, theworld of the Bible that has provided this myth.To tell you the truth, this new data from my perspective, this new data suggestswe are looking at an incredibly important event in human history that impactedon the spread of farming, the spread of perhaps Indo-European languages, but it"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"really didn't affect directly the development of these stories that deal with adifferent part of the world. We are discovering the Black Sea world is a wholeculture area of itself. And this is a wonderful event to discover, a wonderfulthing to work on at the beginning of the 21st Century when we thought most ofthe world was pretty much known. And here we have a whole new culturearea.\"As Dr. Ballard said, he found this Neolithic structure 300 feet below the surfaceof the Black Sea because he was following up on the research of geologists BillRyan and Walter Pitman from Columbia University. Doctors Ryan and Pitmanhypothesized in their ground breaking 1997 book, Noah's Flood, that geologicand sea shell data around the Black Sea indicated a massive flood 7,000 yearsago. Their theory was that melting ice caps in the last ice age raised ocean levelsso high that the Atlantic Ocean spilled through the Mediterranean and what isnow the Straits of Bosporus and flooded the Black Sea with salt water.William Ryan, Ph.D., Co-author with Dr. Walter Pitman of Noah's Ark,Geologist and Senior Research Scientist, Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Palisades, New York: \"And when that salt waterof the oceans got to that level, it found that it could pour back into the BlackSea. And the Black Sea was below the world sea level, much like the Dead Seais today or Death Valley in California is.THE IRONY IS THAT IT WAS THE FRESH WATER MELT OF THEICE INTO THE OCEANS THAT RAISED THE OCEANS HIGHENOUGH TO FLOOD BACK INLAND?That's right.WOULD THIS HAVE BEEN SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVEHAPPENED OVER FOUR OR FIVE DAYS? WEEKS?There is work that Walter has calculated. He has taken the shape of theBosporus and 'removed' all the mud that sits in the Bosporus floor that isyounger than the flood. You look at it as a pipe. And you just do a hydrauliccalculation and you can come up with numbers that say how fast the water wasrushing through it, how fast the lake was rising. Walter has published a veryconservative number. Other researchers have done calculations and come upwith much faster rises. Walter's conservative number would have the lake risingmaybe half a foot to a foot a day and then taking a good portion of a year tocomplete the flood.WOULD THIS HAVE BEEN SOMETHING THAT WOULD HAVEHAPPENED OVER FOUR OR FIVE DAYS?

And others would raise those calculations by ten to ahundred times the rate.MEANING TEN TO ONE HUNDRED FEET A DAY?Something that would be over in a month. And so, we're content to sit with theconservative calculations because even happening in a year or so, that's rapid.That's a big impact."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"CAN YOU EXPLAIN WHY A DISCOVERY OF THESE UNDERSEAARTIFACTS ABOUT TWELVE MILES OFF THE NORTHERN COASTOF TURKEY SUGGEST THAT THERE WAS AN ANCIENT FLOOD?It's not so much how far off Turkey. It's how deep under the Black Sea thissettlement, these human artifacts are. They are more than 300 feet under thesurface of the Black Sea today. And if you look at the age of this at that time,the world sea level, the world's ocean, was just 40 feet below what it is today.These villages were built on dry land. It gives a setting that is more than 250 feetbelow the ocean. And so, it means the area could be flooded.250 FEET ABOVE WHAT WAS ONCE DRY LAND INDICATES WHATA HUGE VOLUME OF WATER FLOODED INTO THE BLACK SEA.Yes! In fact, if you look at the opening that was carved away - the modern dayStraits of Bosporus where Istanbul is and you explore the size and shape of thatchasm - the size and breadth, it would indicate that water would have flownthrough once the dam collapsed at the rate of 12 cubic miles a day or more. To alay person, that's like standing at Niagara Falls and watching water come at youmaybe 200 to 400 times greater volume than you would see today.WHY DO YOU AND WALTER PITMAN THINK THAT THIS COULDEXPLAIN THE BIBLICAL STORY OF NOAH'S FLOOD?It really can't explain the Biblical story of Noah's flood. No scientific methodthat we can apply can show that the Black Sea flood was the one that Noahwitnessed and survived. What you have in the Black Sea flood is a permanentflood that would have driven people away for ever who would have to havesettled a new land. In the legends and genesis story, Noah goes to a far awayland. His sons disperse. They carry the different languages to Asia and Africa.IS THERE ANY EVIDENCE FOR A COMPLETELY GLOBAL FLOOD7,000 YEARS AGO?Oh, no, there is no evidence in the oceans, record in the land, of a global floodother than the very slow rise of global sea level with the melting of the ice capsbeginning 15,000 years ago when sea levels were 350 feet below where they aretoday and more or less getting to where they are today five or six thousand yearsago. At times, that rise in sea level might have been as much as ten feet in acentury.HOW FAR IS MOUNT ARARAT FROM THE SINOP AREA?Hypothetically, if you were to escape the flood and arrive at what is called theTrans-Caucus which is the southeast corner of the Black Sea. And throughtrading and commerce of your village, you knew of the people who lived outsidethe Black Sea and you wanted to go into the river valleys of the Tigris orEuphrates Rivers, you could do that by following rivers up from the Trans-Caucus to the watersheds, especially the continental divide. And then youwould land in the head waters, for example, of the Euphrates Rivers. Such a tripwould take you right around the flank of Mt. Ararat.THE IDEA THERE COULD HAVE BEEN A FLOOD SO GREAT THATIT COULD HAVE RAISED AN ALLEGED BOAT OF SOME SORT UPTO THE TOP OF A MOUNTAIN LIKE MT. ARARAT....Oh, that, no. No. Mt. Ararat is huge, tall, a volcano. This flood never gotanywhere near Mt. Ararat. What this flood would have done, though, is that itwould have taken water imagine you are on a lake and suddenly the level of thelake rises 50 or 60 feet. Your beach disappears. The water is now lapping inamong the trees. There is no conventional shore. Trees are poking out of waterthat are drowned. If you try to get to the edge of the lake, you're going to row"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"your boat in amongst treetops. And so, anybody coming back to shore of thislake that is permanently drowned would land their boat amongst treetops. Andof course, if you did this, what would you think? You would think you werelanding on some mountain slope. But, no, Ararat stayed high and dry all thetime during such an event.A FEW YEARS AGO, RESEARCH WAS DONE IN EGYPT AT THESPHINX BY A GEOLOGIST FROM BOSTON UNIVERSITY NAMEDROBERT SCHOCH. HE AND SOME OTHERS HYPOTHESIZED THATTHERE WERE WATER MARKS AROUND THE BASE OF THESPHINX THAT SUGGESTED TO HIM THAT THERE HAD BEENFLOODING AROUND THE SPHINX SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 7,000AND 10,000 YEARS AGO. IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THIS SAME SEARISE THAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING MAY HAVE ALSO AFFECTEDTHE NILE RIVER VALLEY?Yes, it affected the Nile River Valley. But there is no evidence that it rose to thelevel of the base of the Sphinx or the Pyramids during the lowering of sea levelat the time of the glacier activity. The last big Ice Age was 20,000 years ago. TheNile River cut a deep valley to get out to the edge of the Mediterranean Sea.And then with the rise in sea level, that valley filled in and the delta built out.But it wasn't until the delta was completed that the first city-states were builtthere in Egypt. And that would have been thousands of years after the Black Seaflood and long after sea level came more or less to its present position today.WHO WERE THESE PEOPLE WHO WERE LIVING AT THIS PLACETHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 300 FEET LOWER THAN CURRENT SEALEVEL?That's a great question and I hope it's a question we learn answers to, or at leastsome answers to from the further work of Bob Ballard and their team as theyexplore these settlements and then begin to bring up some of the artifacts. But ifyou look at people living at the contemporary time in the inland of Turkey, forexample, or living in southeast Europe 7,000 to 8,000 years ago, they live intowns. There is an ancient town called Catal Hoyuk on the Anatolian Plateauthat would have had a population as large as 10,000 inhabitants. And they livedin mud-brick houses, some multi-storied. They were carpenters. They paintedelaborate frescoes on the plaster walls. They wove rugs. They chipped the mostelegant tools and knives and arrowheads. They traded all across the Middle Eastand into Europe. They were quite remarkable people and they were spiritual.They elaborately buried their dead. They had rituals. They were concerned withlife after death.AS EVIDENCED BY?As evidence by various burial practices. By something called excarnation wherethe head of the body was removed after death. The body was left out onelaborate racks for the birds to remove the flesh and the bones were verycarefully placed in graves in certain portions of the house, always in the sameplace in all houses.WHERE WOULD THAT PLACE BE IN A HOUSE?The place might be under a bench on which you slept. It could be beneath thefloor. It's usually in the part of the house furthest from the entrance way andfurthest from the cooking areas.DOES ANYONE HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHYEXCARNATION WAS DONE?I think it was for one, sanitary reasons. Burying a body with the flesh in yourbasement, it's going to smell awful. But if you leave it outside or bury it in ashallow grave, it's going to be dug up by animals. So, if it's put up on a high"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"rack, it can be delicately consumed and all the bones left for burial.WITH ALL THESE COMPLEXITIES IN PEOPLE LIVING SEVEN OREIGHT THOUSAND YEARS AGO, WHY IS IT THAT SUMERIA ISALWAYS FOCUSED ON AS THE 'BEGINNING OF CIVILIZATION'?That's the appearance of the first big complex cities, cities that have to rely onintensive farming and farming had a great dependency upon irrigation andirrigation channels. If you look at the ancestors of the Sumerians, the so-calledUbaids, they appear in Mesopotamia on virgin soil. And one of the things thatstruck Walter Pitman when he was carrying out the research for our book andinterviewing various archaeologists is that the Ubaids appear - their firstoccupation in Mesopotamia is within the accuracy of radiocarbon dating thetime of the Black Sea flood.7,000 YEARS AGO.That's right. And if you look at the construction of the Ubaid's very first houses,they are of the post and beam, wattle and daub, style that is being describedfrom the Black Sea. So, people have often wondered, actually puzzled, why isthe lowest levels of the Ubaids a style of house architecture characteristic of thesoutheast Europe and northern most Anatolia? It's never been explained before.YOUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT WAS FROM THE DIASPORA OF THEBLACK SEA FLOOD, THE PEOPLE MOVED AWAY FROM THEREAND INTO MESOPOTAMIA?We would ask the question: Could it be? We can't demonstrate it. We can't makeit a strong hypothesis, but we can point out that it's an interesting curiosity. Andthen when you look at the first tools to appear - the chipped blades - they arechipped from a volcanic rock called obsidian. And a geologist, a geochemist, hasanalyzed the chemical composition of the obsidian and it can actuallyfingerprint the volcano from which this lava erupted. The obsidian that arrivedin Mesopotamia arrived in Palestine, gets to Jericho, all comes from Turkey. Isn'tthat interesting?BUT THE BIG MYSTERY IS THEN THAT IF YOU AREESTABLISHING MORE AND MORE THAT THERE WAS A LARGEPOPULATION AT LEAST 7,000 OR MORE YEARS AGO IN THATBLACK SEA TURKEY AREA, WHO WERE THEY THAT THEYCOULD HAVE ENDED UP IN THE UBAID AND SUMERIAN REGIONWITH SUCH SOPHISTICATION?That's just exactly the question to be asked. You've hit the nail on the head. Andso as this exploration continues, we wait with baited breath and with greatexcitement to find out what they are seeing, what they are bringing up. What isthe density of settlements. The fact they found these houses so quickly in theirfirst expedition looking for them. Does it mean they are all over the place? Whatsettings are they in? Are they along rivers? Or along the lake edge? Is theirevidence of farming? What are the pottery styles? All of these are going to beimportant clues to answering your question.I had a Russian astronomer contact me. He had been studying the earliest zodiaccalendars of Mesopotamia. And he contacted me and he wrote a wonderfularticle for Sky and Telescope showing that the earliest Sumerian zodiac isexactly the time of the Black Sea flood.ALMOST AS IF SOME ONE WAS TRYING TO......remember the date.... AND THAT SOMETHING REALLY EARTH CHANGINGOCCURRED AT 5,000 B. C."},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Something was happening around that time, yeah. I wouldn't want to say thatthe flood was causing it all. But there were changes in landscape and climate.WHY WAS DR. BALLARD LOOKING IN THE SINOP AREA?They were in that area because Walter and I met Bob and Fred and othermembers of his team up at MIT and we discussed how would you do this? Andthe consensus was that you would find old rivers under water and essentiallymove along the edge of Turkey until you intersected rivers and then you wouldsurvey up the rivers. You would look for optimum sites on banks. You wouldlook for areas where rivers had joined a confluence in the river and you wouldlook at a bank in the middle. Locations like those that are settled elsewhere.And in fact, one of the students I supervise is out on that expedition and she hasgeological training and from the reports from the ship, that's what they did do.They did intersect rivers and they find these sites in proximity to the old riversbecause the villages needed fresh water.WHY WOULD THERE BE ANY REMAINS OF OLD RIVERS FROM7,000 YEARS AGO UNDER WATER THAT IS 350 FEET DEEP? WHYWOULDN'T IT HAVE ALL BEEN OBSCURED LONG AGO?That's a good question. On our offshore of New Jersey and Long Island, theAtlantic margins, the Native Americans were out there hunting, fishing, living.But as the sea returned slowly, just progressively, the waves would havepounded the beach. The beach would have moved across that whole surface andall elements would have been churned in the surf and sand and scattered andburied and destroyed.When a flood happens and water suddenly pours in and you are buriedhundreds of feet in a matter of months to a year, you find yourself deep underwater where the currents are very quiet and you are only slowly dusted withmud.BUT EVEN THAT MUD WOULD NOT FILL IN THE EVIDENCE OFAN OLD RIVER?In areas that Walter and I explored off Russia and the Ukraine, off Rumania andBulgaria, we can map that surface layer, the covering. We call it a 'mud drape.'And it ranges from about a few feet down to a few inches. The further you goaway from land out near the edge of the continental shelf, the mud coveringbecomes quite thin. And Bob has stumbled on an area - we are quite amazed -that seems to be almost free of this cover. At least from what we're hearing fromthe ship.WHAT FINANCES THE BLACK SEA EXPEDITION?This project is strongly funded by the U. S. Navy which also funded the Titanicresearch, as well as other government agencies. NOAA plus private foundationsand the National Geographic is handling all the filming. Ballard is a researchfellow at NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC.THE NAVY WOULD FUND THIS RESEARCH BECAUSE?Because they funded his research on the Titanic. They have a need for puttingrobots and survey instruments in the deep oceans and even though they developa lot of these tools themselves in government labs, it's of great value to see whatthe academic sector can do. I think they want to be up on what's the latest andbest. When Bob gets back, every stone tool and artifact will be known to theprecision of better than an inch. Everything will be mapped in 3-D. Thetechnology is extremely impressive.HOW WILL THEY CONTROL SECURITY ON THIS UNDERWATER"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"SITE NOW?Bob Ballard, myself and others would like to convince the public that the bestplace for this is where it is. Turkey is adamant that nothing leaves Turkey.Everything you dig or find must remain in Turkey. \"We b s it e s :http://www.nationalgeographic.org/ngnews/blacksea.htmlhttp://www.mysticaquarium.org/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
