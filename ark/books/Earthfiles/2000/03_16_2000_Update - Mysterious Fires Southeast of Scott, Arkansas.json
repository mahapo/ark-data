March 16, 2000 Scott, Arkansas - The mystery of unexplained fires about 25miles southeast of Little Rock, Arkansas might actually be related to a fierybolide that apparently came down and evaporated north of Austin around 8:30PM CST, March 9th. I interviewed one eyewitness from Cabot, Arkansas todaywho wishes to remain anonymous, but told me, \"It was 8:25 p.m. We were onStagecoach Road and Highway 38 outside Old Austin. We started driving downthe road heading home and I looked over at my husband and right there to hisleft, I could see out of nowhere running parallel with us on the road was whatwe thought at first was a small airplane on fire.\"Interview:How high above the ground was it?Little over tree top. All I remember seeing was a long tail that was red, orange,white sparkly - it was awesome! It was something I have never seen in personbefore. To me - like I said, my first instinct when I saw it was a small airplanecoming down on fire because we do have a small airport outside of Cabot andthe Air Force base is less than fifteen minutes from our house. They were flyingover at the same time, the C-130s.You could see the C-130s?I heard them. I didn't see them.Could you see any vehicle or structure in front of the flame?No, Ma am. All I saw was the flame. It was so sudden. I told him, 'Stop!'Whenever NASA sends up the space shuttle - that's how it looked. The bottom,the flames and everything that comes out. It's going in front of us and wewatched it as it was coming down in front of us. We just knew it was fixing to"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"hit, so we sat there waiting for it to hit and explode. And it never did! What Imean, the fire was gone.What did you both say to each other at that point?What the hell was that? It was exactly 8:27 p.m. CST when it quit because Ilooked at the clock in the Blazer. Because I thought, whatever that was, it'sgoing to be on the news and I stayed up and watched the news at 10 o'clock thatnight. There was nothing. I got up Friday morning to get ready for work, turnedon the TV, and they were discussing a mysterious fire in England. Where we sawthis was in a total opposite direction.\"Bright Shooting StarsAbout that same 8:30 p.m. CST time, other eyewitnesses reported bright flashesor \"shooting stars like fireworks\" in the sky moving from a southerly to anortherly direction over Sheridan, Scott and other Little Rock communities.John Rehrouer, Public Information Officer at the Pulaski County Sheriff's Officetold me on Friday, March 10, \"I saw myself earlier in the evening what lookedlike a shooting star - very bright shooting star.\" He said it had an orange colorand was moving toward the northwest.The Old Austin eyewitness and her husband saw the large fiery object disappearin front of them, probably because a meteorite burned up before it hit theground.Current Speculation:Fragments from the meteorite might have fallen into the swampy farm landsoutheast of Little Rock. No one knows what kinds of fertilizers and pesticideswere in that soil, but hot rocks from a bolide could explain the suddenmushroom cloud explosions at 11:20 p.m. that were reported by a pilot to theLittle Rock Arkansas Airport that in turn called 911. Another eyewitness at thesame time called 911. He was sitting on his porch a half mile away looking atthe field when he saw the three mushroom clouds. Meteorite pieces could havefallen over the one or two mile area into the swampy wet land where sporadicfires occurred, eventually heating up chemicals in the soil to a point ofcombustion. That would also explain the odd burning of the tree roots downseveral inches into the soil without affecting the rest of the trees which puzzledfirefighters and other investigators. That also might explain why dry leaves insome areas that had no subterranean connection were not even scorched. Thefew trees that burned to ash might have been set afire directly by the fallingpieces of fiery meteorite and burned longest. Other tree tops were burning,perhaps where the fiery fragments came through the branches.The following comments were made by reporter Mark Minton in the March 16,2000 Arkansas Democrat-Gazette: \"A falling star arced across the centralArkansas skies last Thursday night, its fiery tale lingering as it descended. Abouttwo hours later, a caller reported a fire burning a patch of brush southwest ofEngland. Nearly a week later, investigators have determined that the falling stardid not start the fire. But it did start a commotion.\"Nearly a week later, Jefferson County sheriff's Lt. Eugene Butler still doesn'tknow the precise cause. But he could say for certain Wednesday that it was nota meteor that started the fires near Scott. Butler had no doubt that a meteor didfall, though several people reported it, including John Rehrauer at the PulaskiCounty Sheriff's Office.\"But Butler said a witness emerged Wednesday to tell investigators he had seenthe fire on the property in Scott on March 8, the day before the falling star shotthrough the sky. The witness, a retired farmer who Butler said did not want hisname released, did not view the fire as an immediate concern and did not reportit that day.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"If there really was fire at the Scott location on March 8, it might be thatchemicals in the soil are very concentrated and combustible.Below are four photographs taken by Little Rock, Arkansas banker CraigMcGinley on Tuesday, March 14, 2000 at the quarter mile long by 150 yardsection in which most of the heat and flames were concentrated when the ScottVolunteer Firefighters arrived about midnight on March 10th.Uprooted tree, possibly toppled over from root burn in the wet, swampy soil.Photograph © 2000 by Craig McGinley.Explosives expert with the Pulaski County Office of Emergency Servicessampling magenta-colored residue in the middle of grey-white ash ten inches belowground level where tree roots had burned and charred the hole.
