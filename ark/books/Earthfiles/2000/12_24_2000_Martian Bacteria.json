The lander will use a robotic arm toburrow into soil and under rocks. Samples will be analyzed chemically andresults transmitted back to earth. What are the odds that Beagle 2 finds traces oforganic life?At least one Earth scientist thinks she already has found hard evidence ofbacterial life on Mars. Kathie Thomas- Keprta, Senior Scientist at LockheedMartin's Johnson Space Center in Houston, has been studying the crystalstructure and purity of magnetite beads manufactured in a species of earth-basedbacteria called magnetotactic, or MV-1. The crystals work like tiny compassessensitive to the earth's magnetic field. (When terrestrial inorganic magnetites arestudied, none have all the properties displayed in bacteria magnetites.) She hascompared the magnetotactic bacteria's magnetite with nearly identical crystalsfound in the Allan Hills meteorite that was discovered in the Antarctic."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The Allan Hills meteorite (ALH84001) that crashed into Antarctica about 13,000 yearsago.Scientists say it definitely came from Mars.

Phillip,Associated Press.Scientists have confirmed from chemical analysis that the Allan Hills meteoritedefinitely was ejected from Mars before it crashed down into the Antarctic about13,000 years ago. Kathy Keprta said the meteorite's carbonate layers match theunique chemistry of rock carbonates studied by the Viking lander on Mars in the1970s. Further, the magnetite crystals are embedded in the Allan Hills carbonateand cannot be earth contamination.Left column ALH84001: Transmission Electron microscope (TEM) images on left of theelongated prismatic magnetite crystals extracted from the carbonate globules in Martianmeteorite ALH84001. These crystals display a unique morphology: In one orientation theyhave a rectangular projection and, upon tilting the crystal, they display a hexagonalprojection. These crystals also have facets on top and lower edges of the crystal. This typeof morphology is displayed only by certain types of biogenic magnetite crystals on Earth. Inaddition, these Martian crystals are composed only of Fe (iron) and O (oxygen) and havefew defects.Right column MV-1: TEM images on right of magnetite crystals extracted from cells ofmagnetotactic bacteria strain MV-1. In one orientation, the crystal has a rectangular viewand when the crystal is tilted, the crystal appears to have a hexagonal view. These crystalsare chemically pure and have few defects. Natural selection in terrestrial magnetotacticbacteria has optimized the stability and magnetic moment of these crystals making themuniquely identifiable as biological precipitates. The elongated prismatic magnetites fromALH84001 share these distinctive features. Thus, the presence of these prismaticmagnetites in Martian meteorite ALH84001 is strong evidence for life on early Mars.Photographs courtesy NSA/JSC."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Interview:Kathie Thomas-Keprta, Biochemist and Senior Scientist at LockheedMartin's Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas: \"We looked at themagnetites. We dissolved away the carbonates in Allan Hale's meteorite and inthese carbonate, we found these tiny magnetite grains as we reported in the 1996Science paper. We know these carbonates formed on Mars. So, we know thatthe magnetites that are embedded in the carbonates also formed on Mars. Weknow these are not terrestrial contaminants. That's very important.And what we were able to do is divide these magnetites into three differentpopulations. One, about 25% of the particles in the Allan Hale carbonate, areidentical to the magnetites produced by MV-1 bacteria here on earth. Theyshare all of the same criteria.SO THERE IS NO OPTION YOU'RE DEALING WITH EVIDENCEFROM MARS OF EXACTLY THE SAME TYPE OF MAGNETITEPRODUCED BY THE MV-1 BACTERIA HERE ON EARTH?Let me put it to you this way. These populations are identical to each other.And if this rock were a terrestrial rock, there would be no doubt about biogenicactivity associated with it.NO DOUBT AT ALL?No doubt at all. But because it comes from Mars, I'm going to have a lot ofdoubters!! (laughs)WHY IS THERE SO MUCH RESISTANCE TO ALL OF THIS DATASIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S ANOTHER PLANET, EVEN IF IT'S IN THESAME SOLAR SYSTEM THAT THE EARTH IS IN?It's rather unfortunate. When we originally came out with the science paper,these papers are very restricted in length when you put something in Science.And we could only touch on the very highlights of this research when we putthe 1996 paper in Science. At that point, you're not able to discuss everythingyou've seen and you still know you've got a lot more work to do. And it's takenfour more years to take a close and fairly complete look at just one aspect of the1996 paper which is the magnetite crystals.BUT IF SCIENCE IS NOW SEEMING TO ACCEPT THAT THERE WASA WATERY PAST ON MARS AND MARS IS A NEARBY PLANET INTHE SAME SOLAR SYSTEM NOT FAR FROM THE EARTH INTERMS OF ASTRONOMICAL DISTANCES - AND BOTH PLANETSHAVE HAD WATER - WHY WOULDN'T IT BE NATURAL THATMARS WOULD HAVE SOME TYPE OF BACTERIA, VIRUS OROTHER MICROBIAL LIFE?I completely agree, and not only because of water. But we also know that therewere sources of organic compounds on Mars. We know that.MEANING?We know that even though Viking found no evidence of organic compounds onMars, we know there are organics in the rock and those organics are indigenous.BECAUSE?For example, hydrocarbons.THAT WOULD BE COMING FROM WHAT?There are many extraterrestrial sources of organic materials."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"COMETS AND METEORS?Sure, they impact the earth and would impact Mars. So, if they are not trulyMartian in origin, they are truly extraterrestrial in origin. And so, much of theorganic content of the earth has come from extraterrestrial materials.AGAIN, COMETS AND METEORSExactly. So, we know there are sources of water. It is highly likely that Mars atone time had lakes and possibly vast oceans on it. Magnetotactic bacteria live inaqueous environments here on earth with the exception of the very bottom ofthe deepest oceans.WHERE THERE WAS WATER, YOU ARE BOUND TO FIND THESEPARTICULAR KINDS OF BACTERIA THAT PRODUCE THESEMAGNETITE CHAINS?Exactly. And they can survive with, and without, oxygen. They can survive byeating organic compounds. You would think that based on natural selection inDarwinian evolution, they would require a magnetic field to grow and by takinga look at the results published by others on the magnetic lineations on presentday Mars, that at one time Mars had a very strong global magnetic field. Exactlywhat would be needed for magnetotactic bacteria to set up shop and thrive.WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS PRECISELY WHAT HAPPENED IN THEDISTANT PAST OF MARS THAT KNOCKED AWAY THAT MAGNETICFIELD? OR WHAT HAPPENED TO ALL THE WATER ?Exactly. And if it's underground today, we could still have these organismsunderground on Mars today.IF YOU WERE SPECULATING ABOUT WHEN THE HEADLINESWILL ACTUALLY SAY 'CONFIRMATION OF BACTERIA ON MARS' -WHEN DO YOU THINK THAT MIGHT HAPPEN?Boy, that is a tough question. Personally, I like to think that we have very strongevidence now with these magnetites. Confirmation? Gosh. I hate to say it maytake a sample return to get something like that.WE WON'T HAVE A SAMPLE RETURN FROM MARS FOR HOWLONG?At least 10 years. At least. Minimum. I've got a 3.5 year old son and I just hopeit won't take my son replacing me - that I'll be retired before we get the samplesback! That would be really anti-climatic. I'm hoping that's not going to be thecase.I GUESS PHILOSOPHICALLY IF YOU CAN CONFIRM THAT THEREHAVE BEEN BACTERIA THAT RESEMBLE OR ARE IDENTICAL TOBACTERIA ON EARTH - WHAT IS THE MAJOR IMPLICATION OFTHAT FROM PLANETARY SCIENTISTS TRYING TO STUDY THISSOLAR SYSTEM AND THE ISSUE OF HOW LIFE AROSE?In the Allan Hills meteorite, we are talking about 3.92 billion year old life inthis meteorite, if that's what it is. So, it would be so interesting now to collectyounger samples from Mars, know exactly where they were collected from, seewhat we find in those samples. If we did find evidence for organisms in thosesamples, what types of organisms? Are we looking at Darwinian naturalselection occurring through time on Mars? What would that tell us about theevolution of life on Mars in comparison to the evolution of life here on earth?Are there analogies that can be made? Or is it completely different on Mars, soclose to the Earth, but because of the way Mars developed?I can't imagine the answers being so different because you would expect the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"same chemical and physical principals to be applicable on Mars, the sameprincipals that we find here on Earth.ESPECIALLY IF IT HAD A WATERY PASTExactly. But biology is a funny thing. And as soon as you think you can predictone thing with an organism, or with a virus, something else happens. So, I don'tknow the answer to that.IS IT POSSIBLE SINCE THE ALLEN HILLS METEORITE YOU HAVEGOTTEN THE BACTERIA MAGNETITE SIGNATURE FROM IS 3.9BILLION - WHICH IS ALMOST BACK TO THE BEGINNING OF THESOLAR SYSTEM - IS IT POSSIBLE THAT LIFE ON THIS PLANETWAS SEEDED FROM ROCKS COMING FROM MARS TO THEEARTH?Joe Kirschvink and Ben Weiss in a recent paper they had out in Science about amonth ago suggested that the Allan Hills meteorite in its last shock event did notsee greater than 40 degrees Centigrade as it left the planet (Mars). And if that'strue, then any organism that was trapped in that meteorite would not have beenheated and could have made the trip to Earth. The meteorite itself was ejectedfrom Mars 16 million years ago and it laid in Antarctica for about 13,000 years(before discovery).WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT WHEN IT WAS EJECTED FROMMARS, FOR WHATEVER REASON, 16 MILLION YEARS AGO, ITWAS AT A COOL ENOUGH TEMPERATURE THAT ANY BACTERIAOR OTHER MICROBES ON IT COULD HAVE SURVIVED?Yes. That is the work done at Cal Tech by those geo-biologists.IF THAT IS TRUE, THEN ANY MICROBIAL ORGANISM THAT WASALIVE COULD HAVE ENDED UP ON EARTH AND CONTINUED TOFLOURISH AND EVOLVE HERE?That is their contention.IF WE HAVE THIS BACTERIA THAT PRODUCE THE MAGNETITEON EARTH, THEY MAY HAVE ORIGINATED ON MARS?I remember at our 1996 press conference the statement that we could all beMartians.\"We b s it e s :http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/pictures/mars/http://www.nasa.govCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
