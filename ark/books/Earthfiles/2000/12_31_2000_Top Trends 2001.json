Andthey are oblivious to the criticisms. They aren't going to find these criticisms onthe nightly news where most people tune into.Secondly, there is this America right or wrong attitude. And the reasonscountries tolerated the Ugly American before was that they needed our militarymight to protect them. This isn't the beginning or end of W.W.II where countriesneeded our economic strength and military might. Like in any relationship, whenyou don't need that person, you become more critical of their faults. So, thoseare some of the reasons why it's not being overlooked and why Americans don'tsee what's happening to them overseas. They are blinded by an ideology thatAmerica, right or wrong, is supreme around the world.BUT INSTEAD WE ARE RESENTED.Instead, we are becoming more and more resented. And by the way, not only forour political fake beliefs that we export, but also our cultural exports. They arealso coming under question and attack. You know, the moronic Hollywood"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"formulas of crime, violence, sex and stupidity. So, what you are seeing on theentertainment front is a blooming more and more of a cultural identity ofdifferent countries rather than to automatically buy into the American way.IS THERE ANY HARD EVIDENCE ON BUSINESS AND CORPORATELEVELS THAT YOU ARE AWARE OF THAT OTHER COUNTRIES INTHE WORLD ARE RESISTING OR WANTING TO RESISTAMERICAN PRODUCTS?Take the example of what is happening in China, for instance. You know,Starbucks just opened up in the Ancient City of Beijing. And any time there isan attack against American interests, they attack the American symbols whetherit is McDonalds in France or Starbucks in China. So, you're going to see more ofanti-Americanism being taken out on the symbols that sell those Americanproducts now. Having said that, they're is still going to be a strong demand for alot of things American, but the demand is going to wane unless Americansunderstand what is going on abroad.Recession ProofingIF THERE IS RESISTANCE TO AMERICAN PRODUCTS OUT OFTHEIR RESENTMENT TOWARDS THIS COUNTRY, THAT COULDEXACERBATE WHAT APPEARS TO BE A TREND TOWARDRECESSION IN 2001?Yes, it will exacerbate it because one of the great untold stories is the size of ourtrade deficit with other countries. Other countries are supporting our spendinghabits by through deficit spending. What happens when we go into a recessionwhich appears we may be heading into at some level, the countries abroad areless willing to finance our excessive behavior in terms of paying down our tradedeficit. So, as the trade deficit grows because even the meager amounts ofproducts we are selling overseas begins to decline, it worsens the economicsituation at home.So, for instance, look at what's happening on the farm front. There's greatresistance to American agricultural products. As we know, our corn has beentainted with genetically modified hormones and have not been FDA approvedfor human consumption. So, they are concerned overseas about getting thoseproducts. The Economic Union has vehemently fought the importation ofhormone laden and drug fed livestock and poultry products. So, there is going tobe even more resistance as all things American begin to be tainted with the UglyAmerican brand.WHAT WILL SMART MONEY IN THE UNITED STATES DO IN THISCOMING YEAR DO YOU THINK?The real smart money will start branding overseas as more friendly and sensitiveto the needs and desires of the people they are attempting to sell their productsto. But they are going to have a real tough row to hoe.WE'RE HEARING THAT THE FED MAY REDUCE INTEREST RATESA BIT TO TRY TO OFFSET A RAPIDLY COOLING ECONOMY ANDTHERE ARE THESE CONCERNS ABOUT THINGS HAPPENING INSOUTH AMERICA AND PERHAPS IN ASIA. ESPECIALLY SOUTHAMERICA AND POTENTIAL ECONOMIC CRISES THERE. DO YOUSEE ANYTHING COMING APART FURTHER IN SOUTH AMERICAOR ASIAN MARKETS IN 2001 THAT WOULD MAKE THE FEDSABILITY TO CONTROL THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN THE U. S.MORE DIFFICULT?Oh, definitely. The Feds will probably lower interest rates somewhere down theline. Will that be enough to reinflate the casino fever? They call it liquidity byputting more money into the system. We call it cheap money. So, will that beenough to reinvigorate the stock market to the highs we have seen over the pastseveral years and boost economic growth? It's questionable at this time preciselybecause of what is going on in the rest of the world.Asia, for instance. Japan hasn't come out of the decade long recession. There arereal problems going on in Taiwan. Remember that term they used to use: the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"\"Asian Tigers\" in the old days of the 1990s. You don't hear that anymore. Theyare barely recuperating from the currency crisis of 1997. And then you havewhat is going on in So. America. Argentina just had to be bailed out again by theIMF and they are talking about 35 to 70 billion dollars worth of long-termbailouts to save that country. And then you have the problems in Brazil thathave just been quieted down a little bit. There are really serious financialproblems going on around the world that may cause a soft landing to become ahard landing.ARE AMERICANS NAIVE TO ASSUME THAT CHINA IS GOING TOBE THE NEXT BIG ECONOMIC FRONTIER?Oh, Linda, what a great question! Yeah, they are very naive. Here is the exampleI use. Remember Indonesia, that wonderful place when Suharto - the dictatorwho killed about 300,000 people during his reign - and how Americancorporations and government tolerated his abuses because he was building astrong middle class in Indonesia. We heard that great lie for decades. There wasno middle class in Indonesia, a country of 150 plus million people. There werethe rich that were small in numbers and the very large proportion of the countrypoor.And when we saw the Asian currency crisis hit in 1997, we saw that theEmperor Suharto had no clothes and there was no middle class in Indonesia.The same thing is true for China. All China is is a country with about 1.5 billionpeople whose labor many countries are exploiting. There is not going to be ahuge middle class in China for those great consumer products that so manycountries want to sell.Peace Talks on the Drug WarLET'S MOVE ONTO THE 3RD ON YOUR TRENDS FOR 2001: PEACETALKS ON DRUG WAR.The drug war by anyone's calculation you can see that the cost of this war bothin financial terms and socially have been enormous and there is no end in sightto show victory on the horizon.We are noticing it is becoming more apparent in the press and among politiciansof all stripes that fighting the drug war is a losing battle. So we are estimatingand forecasting that we're going to see peace talks start to take place. And arecognition that it was a noble cause to fight this drug war, but there is nowinning it.So, the resources of the war are going to be shifted towards not treating the drugwar as a crime, but really helping the victims. And you are seeing an unlikelyconglomeration of strange bedfellows saying this war isn't working, whether it'sthe financier George Soros, former Secretary of State George Schultz, theRepublican Governor Gary Johnson of New Mexico and we even heard AnnLanders, the columnist say, 'Those who keep pot for their personal use shouldnot be treated as criminals.'And then we're seeing the facts come out again, according to Human RightsWatch. 64% of those people in prison for drug offenses are black, even thoughthere are 5 times as many drug users who are white. And listen to this number,Linda. With 1.5 million drug arrests each year, half of those are for marijuana.So, we are seeing observers from every political stripe recognizing that it's afailed war, just as Vietnam was a failed war and it's time to cut your losses andget out.Immigration IssuesHOW MORE DIFFICULT WILL THIS WAR ON DRUGS BE IFIMMIGRATION, WHICH IS 4TH ON YOUR LIST, BEGINS TOINCREASE AS WORLD ECONOMIES HAVE PROBLEMS AND MORE"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"PEOPLE WANT TO GET INTO THE UNITED STATES?There were about 2 billion people on the planet in 1920. From 1920 to 2000,world population grew to 6 billion people. And by 2050, that's supposed toincrease to ten billion people!No one has ever worked with these numbers before. In these best of timesaccording to the World Bank, hardly a socialist or west wing organization,according to them, half of the world's working population in these best of timesare earning only $2/day. So, you're going to see billions of people searchingaround the world to find a decent wage. That means going into the developedcountries.So, immigration is going to be a huge issue. And again, people aregoing to take sides rather than look at the complexities of it all.IT'S IRONIC THAT YOUR TOP TREND IS THE INCREASING UGLYAMERICAN CHARACTERIZATION BY THE REST OF THE WORLDTOWARDS US, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME YOU SEEM TO BESAYING THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WANT TO GET INTO THE U. S.AND THUS THE IMMIGRATION INCREASE.Oh, yeah, but that doesn't mean they like what America stands for. In Europe,people are living just fine. It's not like the days of immigration at the turn of thecentury when so many people were fleeing their countries for higher economicgrounds. But for other countries, particularly in the African and South Americancountries, America is still the Promised Land. So nothing is black and white asyou look at these trends.AND SOME CAN BE CONTRADICTORY.Oh, sure.Closed MindsCLOSED MINDS ON YOUR LIST. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?It means that people are not really discussing issues to find the truth, whateverthe truth might be. Instead, people are looking towards building agendas andplatforms and twisting the language to meet their needs. And we've never seen itmore apparent than it is right now. As a matter of fact, there is this wholedumbing down of thought where you have the presidential candidates whereimportant issues are being discussed on entertainment platforms, from RosieO'Donnell to David Letterman. Which candidates did you think was thefunniest?! So, the closed minds for a country and a world that is transitioningout of a period of remarkable stability into uncharted waters, the future is goingto have to be looked at more discerningly than it is now.Involuntary SimplicityWHAT ABOUT INVOLUNTARY SIMPLICITY ON YOUR LIST?Remember the voluntary simplicity movement that found life after the StockMarket Crash of 1987 and it was going pretty strong until the late 1990s whenthe stock market started booming and the GNP began to skyrocket. We sawpeople buying their SUVs and trophy homes and conspicuous consumptionbecame the thing to do.Now we can see that the best of economic times are over. People are going to beforced to cut back and tone down. So, they are going to find new converts forthe simplicity movement, but these are going to go into it kicking and screamingbecause conspicuous consumption and consumerism is what drives America.Two-thirds of our gross national product is built on consumption. But like avictim suffering a health crisis, after the crisis they say I like my new style of life.I've cut way back on the stress levels as well as the food intake and now I'mexercising more. I really hated the way I was living before. That's why we call itinvoluntary simplicity. While people will be involuntarily forced to change theirlife styles, they are going to like their new lifestyles better than the old becausewhat we're going to be seeing is new philosophical thoughts developing aspeople begin to understand that they have a purpose and meaning in life and it's"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"not just to consume, but to find a divine purpose within. You start finding thatwhen you start looking at life a bit more simpler than just consumption.WHAT ABOUT THE FACT WE LIVE IN A NATION IN WHICH THEPOLITICAL SYSTEM AND ECONOMIC SYSTEM IS REALLY BASEDON PEOPLE IN A CONSUMER MODE. IF PEOPLE BEGIN TO CUTBACK, WHAT HAPPENS?W.W.II, what will happen is that we're only going to see involuntary simplicityhit only about a maximum of 20 to 25% with people taking on some of theaspects of simplicity probably by around 2010. But, the overall society will stillbe lionizing those doc.com bourgeoisie that found riches so quickly. So, we'restill going to be a consuming society, but the philosophy is beginning to change.And that's what we do: by the way we look at the top trends of the New Year.We look at them over the long term.THEN THIS IS A TREND OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS THAT WILLKEEP INCREASING YEAR BY YEAR UNTIL AT LEAST A QUARTEROF THE POPULATION FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW ARE ANDHAVE CUT BACK CONSIDERABLY TO A MUCH SIMPLER KIND OFLIFE.Sure. And many of us who are old enough to remember, speaking for myself, myparents were married in 1933 during the Depression. And all I heard wereDepression stories. Frugality and thriftiness was something that was just apart ofour lives and it wasn't looked as a negative, it was looked at as a virtue. We aregoing to go into economic times in the future that are at much lower level thananything that we've seen in the past, in the post W.W.II past.MEANING THAT YOU SEE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GLOBALECONOMIC CRISES?Oh, yes. Yeah. Again, the economic prosperity that we lived through in the postW.W.II era, we're never going to see that again. Not in our life times. And you'renever going to see a stock market like you saw in the 1990s. That came aboutthrough a confluence of 2 very unique circumstances: one was the breakingdown of the Berlin Wall and the end of Communism and the opening up ofglobalization which at the same time happened with the whole digitalrevolution. So those kinds of circumstances are once in a couple of life times.Now, you can see that globalization is going to take longer than anticipated andthe internet revolution while it was an evolution of technology, it wasn't arevolution. And it was way oversold.Re-Unionizing of the Soviet UnionWHY DO YOU THINK THAT THESE BOOMING TIMES OF THE1990S DID NOT HELP THE SOVIET UNION TO COME OUT OF ITSCOMMUNISM ERA AND ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO JOIN THE FREEMARKET CAPITALISM AS YOU HAVE ON YOUR LIST OF TOPTRENDS IN 2001 - THE SOVIET UNION ACTUALLY GOINGBACKWARDS AGAIN?The reason it didn't work is the same reason it is unrealistic to think there couldbe one world religion as it is to believe there could be one world economicsystem. The U. S. system of open free markets can't fit all structures around theworld. And the Soviet Union was not ready. I love how belief systems becomeso entrenched and then they fade from everybody's memories.Remember this one: 'Shock Therapy.' Well, just as shock therapy doesn't work inreal life, it doesn't work in economic life. They're going to go back to a new formof Communism. Now, here's the danger. The free marketeers in favor ofprivatization are going to condemn anything that doesn't fit their theo-economicbelief system that the rest of the world should be buying into. So, they are goingto radicalize a movement in the former Soviet Union rather than accept it. So,you're going to see the beginning of a new Cold War.IN WHAT WAY DO YOU THINK WE WILL SEE THE COLD WAR ISBACK IN PLAY?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"You're going to see the first evidence in the re-unionization of the Soviet Union.And as a matter of fact, after we wrote these trends, it was announced thatVladimir Putin, the President of Russia, is bringing back the old Soviet nationalanthem. They are changing the words, but the sound remains the same. They arealso bringing back the red flag, minus the hammer and cycle. So, you can see themovement is already going in that direction.Dumbsizing IIWHAT IS THE LAST ONE ON YOUR LIST FOR 2001, DUMBSIZINGII?Go back to after the 1987 stock market crash. That's when dumbsizing began tocut fat out of the corporations and make them lean and mean. They have theselittle slogans. Well, they didn't downsize. They dumbsized. We coined thatword, by the way. We coined it in 1993.THAT WAS DUMBSIZING I.Right. And when it happened, any of us who have a brain or do any businessknow what a drag it is to try to get any kind of service from anywhere. It doesn'texist! I mean, isn't it amazing there is such a thing as air rage. Look at the serviceyou get! And look at the pay people are getting.YOU MEAN THE LACK OF SERVICE IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY?Exactly. And look at something else. Everyone working today knows they aretaking on more work than they ever handled in the old days. That's why we havethis moronic 24/7 mentality. People are taking on the jobs and those that weredownsized in the last round of downsizing and even as the economy turned up,very frequently the corporations wouldn't restaff to the size that previouslyexisted before the fist round of downsizing.Now, we're going into an economic slowdown. Indisputable. What arecorporations doing? Pick up the newspaper. They are cutting the fat out of thecorporate budget and we are going to become lean and mean. Well, there's no fatleft! Service stinks already. People are working harder and longer than they evercould possibly thought they were working and now they are making thecorporations even smaller. So, Linda, if you thought service was bad before, youhaven't seen anything yet. It's going to get worse.And if you think people are over-stressed by working too long and too hard,those stress levels are going to increase as corporate America again champions anew round of dumbsizing.IS THERE ANYTHING THAT CAN TURN THIS AROUND ANDIMPROVE IT?Yes, there is. Ideas have to change. And the idea that has to change is that ourpurpose for being humans on the earth is to do more than just make money andbuy things. But right now, the corporations are the God of Society. As a matterof fact, I do a lot of the media. And when I talk anything bad about corporatewelfare or signs to trim back corporate power, the phones start ringing like, 'Getthis guy off the air.' So, until we have more purpose in life that is not builtaround the almighty dollars, then things are going to decline emotionally,morally and spiritually. Having said that, I think we are at the end of this DarkAge of thinking and that we are going to be looking at a Renaissance inPhilosophy and thought and we're just in the early days of it.\"We b s it e :http://www.trendsresearch.com/Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
