My reportsprovoked one listener, Dale Patrone of Delta, Colorado, to FAX me concerninghis own encounter with a round disc on top of a snow-covered mountain nearMiracle Mile, Wyoming on March 28, 1977 after a raging blizzard. Dale, hisbrother and sister-in-law and another friend had camped along the Platte Riverfor a fishing holiday northwest of Medicine Bow. Dale, now 44 years old and aminer most of his life, had never seen anything like the disc's blackish-brown,glassy-metallic surface - nor the dozens of odd symbols embedded around itsedge.Interview:Dale Patrone, Miner, Delta, Colorado: \"Around 9 o'clock at night, the stormsubsided and it became very quiet outside. We were playing cards in this trailerand were cramped up. It was a small pull trailer. And so, I went outside, opened"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the door. It was a completely star lit night above us.IN OTHER WORDS, THIS VIOLENT SNOW STORM HAD JUSTALMOST IMMEDIATELY GONE AND THE SKY ABOVE WASCLEAR?Yes. What was unusual is that it formed almost a perfect circle around us and inthe distance, you could see the clouds were rolled up and the storm was stillraging and continuing on. You could still hear it in the background.Well, I started walking up this hill. I had a flashlight in my hand and a friend ofmine was following behind me. And I was going up this mountain that seemed tobe terraced in three levels. And it was quite steep, so when I got up there to thetop I was the first one up when I walked upon this UFO that was on the ground.It was a large, circular-shaped disc.WHAT WAS IT THAT MADE YOU WANT TO CLIMB THISMOUNTAIN RIGHT AFTER A RAGING SNOW STORM?I have no idea to this day, to tell you the truth. I have no idea whatsoever.YET, WHEN YOU GOT UP AT THE TOP, YOU ARE LOOKING ATFRESH SNOW WITH NO TRACKS IN IT?Ye s .SITTING ABOUT HOW FAR FROM YOU AT THAT POINT WAS THISROUND OBJECT?When I crested the top of the hill, it was approximately 25 feet from where thetop of the hill, from where I climbed up to the ship that had landed was.SO, YOU ARE SAYING THAT WHEN YOU GOT TO THE TOP, HEREWAS A TOTALLY STRANGE OBJECT ONLY ABOUT 25 FEET FROMYOU?Ye s .NOW, YOU'VE GOT YOUR FLASHLIGHT AND YOU ARE SHININGYOUR LIGHT ON THE BRIGHT SNOW AND THIS OBJECT. WHATWAS THE COLOR OF THE OBJECT IN YOUR FLASHLIGHT?It was kind of a glowy, or a shiny, metallic blackish-brown.DID YOU APPROACH IT?Yes. I walked up to it when I noticed these blocks that were raised blocksapproximately an inch and a half apart, these blocks. Then I noticed thehieroglyphics that were printed in the edge of the ship. There were things likelightning bolts. The only thing I've been able to compare the symbols to isEgyptian hieroglyphics, but those are much different."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Sketch by Dale Patrone on April 15, 2000 of the 150 foot diameter discthat appeared to have been molded from a blackish-brown glassy substancethat included raised rectangles spaced 1.5 inches apart over the entire surface aroundthe central dome (only a few examples in sketch). Strange symbols orhieroglyphs were embedded around the disc's perimeter edge.THEY ARE NOT EGYPTIAN. CAN YOU EXPLAIN IF THEY WERECARVED INTO THIS POLISHED GLASSY SURFACE? OR WERETHEY RAISED ABOVE THE GLASSY SURFACE?I would have to say they were almost stamped into it, but there wasn't noindentations. It was almost like it was coated. They were definitely there, butyou could not feel them.SO IT WASN'T LIKE THEY WERE CARVED INTO THE SURFACE?Not at all.WERE THEY A DIFFERENT COLOR?No.SO HOW DID YOU KNOW THEY WERE THERE?They just showed themselves like Roman numerals would show if you hadstamped them and then coated over them.ALMOST AS IF THEY HAD BEEN PRESSED INTO WHATEVER THISCRAFT WAS MADE OUT OF AND THEN THE GLASSY SURFACEWAS PUT OVER THEM?Correct.SO YOU COULD SEE THEM SORT OF UNDERNEATH THIS GLASSYSURFACE?Ye s .DID YOU PUT YOUR HANDS AND RUN YOUR FINGERS AROUNDTHE EDGE WHERE THE SYMBOLS WERE?Ye s .DESCRIBE HOW THAT FELT?It was still smooth as glass.DID THESE SYMBOLS GO ALL AROUND THE CRAFT? DID YOUWALK ALL THE WAY AROUND THE WHOLE CRAFT WITH YOURFLASHLIGHT LOOKING AT THEM?No, I did not. But they did continue on around the craft.WHY DIDN'T YOU WALK ALL THE WAY AROUND?Because when I started knocking on it to see what type of metal it was made outof, it started glowing red like a fluorescent red. And I jumped back in shock. Itstartled me. I jumped maybe a foot or foot and a half back and it shot up abovemy head and stopped about 100 feet above my head. And then it sent out a largegreen beam of light and I was engulfed in this green beam of light. And I wasfilled with an enormous sense of energy, a sense of energy like I've neverexperienced.Then it took from me everything I had ever seen, tasted, felt and touched fromthe time I was that age (21) clear back to the time I was an embryo in mymother's womb. I got to see that like a tape being played out. It was like takingfrom my life experience everything I've ever seen or tasted or felt or touched.DID THIS PLAY OUT IN YOUR HEAD SORT OF LIKE WATCHING A3-DIMENSIONAL MOVIE?Yes, it was just like being taken from you. I turned and it's a good thing that itretracted its beam because it was almost like I was going to fly off the mountain."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"And when it retracted its beam, it started bright white and it shot up anotherthousand or fifteen hundred feet and then slowly started across the sky, speedingup as it went until it left a meteor trail like a falling star.WHEN THAT GREEN BEAM HAD ENGULFED YOU AND YOU FELTLIKE YOUR MIND AND ALL OF YOUR EXPERIENCES ANDEVERYTHING WERE SORT OF BEING UPLOADED FROM YOU, DIDYOU GET ANY KIND OF A MENTAL IMPRESSION OF WHO WASDOING THE DOWNLOADING? OR WHY THEY WERE DOING THEDOWNLOADING?No, I did not. It's not like you see the large-eyed little green men or anything likethat.\"More Information:Dale Patrone's experience of having his entire life downloaded while hewatched, reminded me of a similar event that other Colorado residents hadendured three years later in November 1980 north of Boulder.Colorado husband's drawing of the disc that picked up his car in a beam of lightand landed in a forested area where Oriental-looking humanoids interactedwith him and his wife © 1989 An Alien Harvest by Linda Moulton Howe.A husband and wife were driving on a freeway at night when a blue-white beamsurrounded their car and they rose upward.
