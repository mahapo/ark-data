Photograph on January 18, 1997 © by Jean Barton.October 15, 2000 Grass Lake, Michigan - Since the 1950s, unusual deaths called “animalmutilations” have been reported around the world. Both domestic animals and wild gamehave been affected, especially horses and cattle. Ranchers and law enforcement have longbeen puzzled because animals are found with the same pattern of hide and tissue removed usually without blood from the head, sexual organs, and rectum. There are no signs ofstruggle or tracks around the dead animals, not even the animal's own tracks. That peculiarfact provoked law enforcement to wonder if perpetrators came in and out of pastures usingaerial craft.Many ranchers have also speculated that their mutilated animals have been cut with lasersbecause of the bloodless nature of the excisions. In fact, pathology exams over the yearshave confirmed in some mutilations that cuts were made with heat energy. (See: An AlienHarvest in Earthfiles Shop.) Biophysicist W. C. Levengood in Grass Lake, Michiganthinks a very complex set of energies are involved. He began studying soil and grasssamples from mutilation sites to compare with soil and grass from crop formations. In bothphenomena, he has found the same pattern of respiration changes in plant cellmitochondria, including grass collected near the rectal area of the California bull discussedin this report. He has experimented with microwaves to reproduce some of the biochemicaland biophysical effects he has found.Upper graph indicates respiratory stress in the grass sampled near rectal area ofmutilated California bull discussed in this report. Bottom graph shows normal respirationof mitochondria in grass sampled one hundred feet north of the dead animal.Redox text and graphs by W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist.Now, a startling new discovery has been reported from research on a mutilated bull.The case began on January 17, 1997, when ranchers Jean and Bill Barton werechecking their cattle from horseback at their winter ranch near Red Bluff, California."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Their 2,000 pound Black Angus bull was dead and mutilated. The young bull hadbeen seen alive and well ten days earlier. He was in a hillside pasture about one-halfmile from the only dirt road into the area. The field is remote, strewn with volcanicrocks, and can only be reached on foot or horseback.Field investigator Jean Bilodeaux collected tissue, grass and soil samples. Her fieldnotes stated: “Bull was lying on its right side, positioned along a north/south axis,with his head pointing north. His right foreleg was drawn way up, almost under hischest; his right hind leg was up underneath his body, and he was lying on his tailwhich was curved upward with the end of the tail protruding out over is rump. Hisback towards the rear end seemed curved under his body in a very unnatural positionas if he might have been dropped from a height. The right shoulder appeared crushedby the rock underneath the animal and the grass around him was standingundisturbed with no stems broken. There were no obvious signs of a struggle as hisfront legs were lying against some small rocks which had not been dislodged.”Bull ExcisionsThe hide on the left side of the bull's nose and mouth as well as the left eye had beenexcised in smooth and precise cuts.The right eye that remained was very inflamed, much redder than pink eye, and theiris and pupil were rolled inward toward the nose.The tongue was gone.A large, round section of hide had been removed behind the left front leg. Theexcision stretched from the chest to the left knee. Yet, that large wound showed nosigns of blood or fluid drainage to the ground.The rectum was cored out and a watery, reddish liquid could be seen in the rectalcavity.Excisions of bull's left eye, nose and mouth hide, and large circularsection beneath left foreleg. White marks on body are bird droppings and feathers.Photograph on January 18, 1997 © by Jean Barton.Large, round excision between chest and left knee on Black Angusbull with both legs and tail under body as first discovered.
