The three radar stations were part of the U. S. Aircraft Control and Warning(AC&W)system that also became known as LASHUP. One of El Vado's specific missions was toprotectthe Los Alamos Laboratory and the Atomic Energy Commission's atomic bombproduction at Los Alamos and Sandia Base. Interview: (continues from April 2, 2000 Santa Fe, New Mexico)In my mind, after trying to understand New Mexico's history for the pastfifty years in relationship to non-human intelligence interacting with earth,it's not clear if White Sands Proving Ground and Missile Range alwayshad the upper hand on what goes on in New Mexico. Or is a higher peckingorder at Los Alamos? Or have decisions about non-human activities beendivided among various military and intelligence commands so no onegroup or person could know everything that was happening?Actually, I think that the atomic activity was being handled by the AtomicEnergy Commission (AEC) and the activity at White Sands Missile Range, or atthe time, White Sands Proving Ground, was the Army. Then you had the AirForce presence guarding with radar capability. Then you had the Navy - theyeven had a facility here in terms of radar work. And so you've got a number ofdifferent groups. And if you're talking about air defense, flying in the air was aresponsibility of the Air Force after August of 1947. But shooting things downout of the sky was the responsibility of the Army. That was Army Anti-aircraft"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Artillery Division (Robert M. Montague, member of MJ-12 and Director of theNational Anti-aircraft and Guided Missile School, Ft. Bliss, Texas, 1946-July1947 and Base Commander, Sandia Base, July 1947 - February 1951.) And soyou had a number of different groups all active in the same area. And it's notinconceivable that each one would have its own capacity to do whatever itneeded to do to protect the air space above New Mexico.In the work you have done to establish why the El Vado Radar installationshould be preserved, have you come across any information that wouldgive an insight into the non-human activities in New Mexico?No, that was not a part of this research activity. What really propelled me to dothis is that New Mexico has such a rich history in that 1942 period on inrelationship to science and technology. And we have lots and lots of facilities.But somewhere along the line, most of those have been destroyed. AFS-P8 is afacility that was abandoned in 1958 and remains pretty much intact. So theHistoric Preservation Division of the State of New Mexico is interested inpreserving that site from the standpoint of its role with the Atomic EnergyCommission and with Los Alamos and the early Cold War period in the state.In the process of doing the radar station research, I think you hadconversations with Congressman Schiff before he died about his officialefforts to get to the bottom of what happened at Roswell.Right.One of the most startling revelations in his GOA inquiry resulted from hisrequest for all Roswell Army Air Field (RAAF) records from January 1 toDecember 31, 1947. The reply to him was that all of the records had beendestroyed without authorization.Yes. I know that the folks working around him were pretty stunned that nothingexisted in terms of documentation from Roswell or from several other facilitiesin southern New Mexico.Did anyone believe those RAAF records had really been destroyed? Isn't ita shell game and the records are hidden somewhere else?I have no idea. But I do know that I did talk with one of the GAO (GovernmentAccounting Office) staff people and Jack Anderson did also. He wrote a nationalcolumn. The researchers that were involved with the GAO, at least one of themfelt, something significant had happened in the Roswell area. They didn't wantto speculate on what had happened there, but from the movements of differentgroups back then it was apparent even in newspaper reports that somethingsignificant had happened there.In the Roswell area in 1947?Right. In the Corona and Carrizozo and Roswell triangle there.There is even more information in documents released in the last threeyears which indicate there was a landing or crash near the Trinity Site atWhite Sands between Oscura Peak and Socorro.OK, and then the one thing that really hasn't been discussed is that airplaneaccident in Carrizozo where the jet flew into the gas station. The plane blew upand killed a couple of people. Basically that was never reported outside ofCarizzozo."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Do you think the Carrizozo incident could have been the military's way todeflect attention away from some other highly classified activity such as theretrieval of an extraterrestrial craft?I would have to speculate about having that P-80 jet sitting on that highway overthat period of time immediately after the dates of interest that we have withRoswell collection activity. It was immediately after that that there was a levelof military activity occurring in that same geographic location and theinformation related to something as traumatic as a jet flying into a gas stationwas not reported. You can only draw one conclusion from that and that is theinformation was suppressed by someone.The other thing that has not been well reported that really from the Schiffinquiry was that the Commander at White Sands Proving Ground at the timereported several days before the Roswell thing that two folks at the MissileRange had seen two flying discs about to crash.What would there be about the behavior of two discs that anyone watchingwould know they were about to crash?That's also a good question. But it was only a few days after the Washingtonstate flying discs sighting.You're talking about the June 24, 1947 Kenneth Arnold Report?Right. White Sands reports two flying discs about to crash on 27th of June1947.\"El Paso Times New Mexicans Add To Mystery Reports"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"\"Mysterious 'falling objects' reported near Tularosa and Eagle, NewMexico Friday (June 27, 1947) had not been located or identifiedlate Friday night. There were no rockets fired from the White SandsProving Ground Friday.There was much conjecture as to whether the falling objects had anyrelation to the mysterious flying discs which had been variouslyreported seen recently from Oregon to Oklahoma.Lt. Col. Harold R. Turner, commanding officer at White Sands, saidthat he had received reports that a track walker said he had seen afalling object near Eagle, New Mexico and an Army captain flying hisown plane reported seeing an object falling from the skies nearTularosa. Search parties were sent out from White Sands in attemptsto locate the objects or secure additional information.\"What you're saying is that down at white Sands within a week of theKenneth Arnold sightings and report, two people at White Sands reportedthat they watched two discs having some kind of trouble or headed towardsa crash?Yes, the commander of the missile range reported that two of his people hadseen two flying discs about to crash. And he was sending out military patrols tofind them.Raising the possibility that there were half a dozen crashes in a very shortperiod of time in New Mexico which would have confused and alarmed theTruman Administration.I don't know. The reason that I mentioned June 28th because it's the only reportthat I've ever seen in the newspaper that says two flying discs were seen about tocrash on June 28th. And it was reported by the Lt. Col. in charge of WhiteSands Proving Ground. And what they would routinely do at the missile range -because they were doing the V-2 rocket experiments and other rocketexperiments - if a missile got away from them and headed in a differentdirection, they would publish the idea that one had gone in a given direction andoffer a reward to people who could provide information on the whereabouts ofthe technology. And so basically, this newspaper article was saying that theysaw these two flying discs about ready to crash and they were asking people tolook around and see if they could find anything.Do you think this activity from the end of June into July 1947 fromWashington State to New Mexico could have anything to do withmicrowaves and radar interfering with the aerial craft propulsion, eitheraccidentally or from deliberate U. S. effort?I think this activity of these anomalous objects were definitely something thatinterested the military from the standpoint of where they were appearing andthat the areas in which they were appearing, especially in southern New Mexico,with the research related activity they had going on down there.Missiles.Exactly. And then also with the Atomic Energy Commission - that anyanomalous object that flew into this area would have been considered, and notknowing what it is, I think the assumption would have been that they werehostile. And not knowing their source or anything about what these things mightrepresent. And because of our existing air defense capability, I think it would bea natural assumption that we would consider those things to be hostile and dosomething about it."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Any evidence that you've come across either in firsthand testimony orsecret documents that confirm a hostile intent on the part of thenon-human intelligence/s?Not that I've ever seen. In terms of technology, I can only say that if you doresearch over that period of time from late June 1947, you'll find that discs arebeing seen all over the United States. It was written off as national hysteria inthe first week of July 1947. But prior to that, you had military movements of(unidentified) air craft all over the United States and the reports fromWashington state and different air defense headquarters were that they weresending airplanes up to find out what these things were. And there were lots andlots of reports in New Mexico during that period of time of anomalous objects inthe sky.My only speculation would be that we had such highly critical facilities hereand that we did have people in place to defend the air space above New Mexicoand that (unidentified) technology would have been assumed to be hostilewhether it was occupied or unoccupied. If it was a remote-controlled, some kindof airplane sent over to photograph installations or whatever - they would haveengaged that also.What about the fact that there were so many civilian and militaryairplanes crashing out of the sky in that period of 1947 to 1948 thatPresident Harry Truman even called for a change in the way civilian andmilitary aircraft were being serviced and repaired because there were somany accidents?Graph of May 15 - June 1, 1947 Airplane Accidents excerpted fromPeculiar Phenomenon © 1994 by J. Andrew Kissner.Absolutely right. During that period of time from about late May through atleast the middle of July, we had hundreds of airplane accidents in the UnitedStates. And that was of all kinds of aircraft. And the President Truman called a"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"special board, a presidential board, a panel, in early June 1947 to investigate theair crashes. There never was a final report. The offshoot of that was the NationalAir Traffic Safety Board, the NTSB.Has it ever been implied to you that all those air accidents might have hada link to the craft and intelligences of unknown origin?No, but it's interesting that both of those air-related situations were occurring atthe same time and no one associated the idea that they could be associated. Andit's interesting because the flying disc sightings are right next to on the front pageof the New York Times next to reports of aircraft accidents.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":" More Information:I welcome further information concerning this report atearthfiles@earthfiles.com or FAX me at 215-491-9842 or write me:Linda Moulton HoweReporter and Editor,Earthfiles.comP.
