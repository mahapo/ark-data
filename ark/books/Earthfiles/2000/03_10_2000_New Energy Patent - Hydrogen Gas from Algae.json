A joint patent on this newhydrogen production technique from plant photosynthesis has been filed by thetwo institutions.Currently, hydrogen fuel is extracted from natural gas, a non-renewable energysource.The U. S. Department of Energy's Hydrogen Program has been hoping tofind a renewable source of hydrogen. For nearly sixty years, scientists haveknown that certain types of algae can produce gas, but until now the amountswere only small traces. The breakthrough was discovering a \"molecular switch.\"This is a process by which the cell's usual photosynthetic apparatus can beturned off at will and the cell can be directed to use stored energy whichproduces hydrogen as a by-product.Tasios Melis, Professor of Plant and Microbial Biology at UC Berkeley and oneof the algae researchers said, \"The molecular switch is actually very simple toactivate. It depends on the absence of an essential element, sulfur, from themicro-algae growth medium. The algae are utilizing stored compounds andbleeding hydrogen just to survive. It's probably an ancient strategy that the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"organism developed to live in sulfur-poor anaerobic conditions.\"It was actually a surprise when we detected significant amounts of hydrogencoming out of the culture. We thought we would get trace amounts, but we gotbulk amounts. In the future, both small-scale industrial and commercialoperations and larger utility photobioreactor complexes can be envisioned usingthis process. Hydrogen is so clean burning that what comes out of the exhaustpipe is pure water. You can drink it.\"The scientists first grow the alga in sun like all other plants on earth. This allowsthe green-colored miniature plants to collect sunlight, carbohydrates and otherfuels. Then the liquid alga culture, which resembles a lime-green soft drinkphotographed at the top of this report, is transferred to one-liter glass bottleswith no sulfur present. The alga culture is corked and metabolizes all the oxygenuntil hydrogen begins to bubble to the top of the bottle. The hydrogen gasbleeds off into tall, hydrogen-collection glass tubes.So far, the algae can produce about three milliliters of hydrogen per liter ofculture every hour over four days. Then the culture needs to go back to sunlightto absorb more fuel. A few days later, it can be tapped for hydrogen again.Researchers say the cell culture can go back and forth many times.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
