Also see: http://www.cropcircleconnector.comAugust 17, 2000 Woodborough Hill, Near Alton Priors, Wiltshire,England - This past Saturday night of August 12, 2000, around 10:30 PM, threeof us had climbed Wiltshire's famous Woodborough Hill which has been acentral focus for crop formations since the phenomenon seriously began on aglobal scale in 1990. With me was Andrew J. Buckley, a graphic artist fromManchester, England, and his friend, Hazel. Andy had videotaped six small,white, glowing lights moving over the wheat field between Woodborough Hilland Pickled Hill on July 18th and wanted to visit again to see if any more wouldturn up.Map of Woodborough Hill and Pickled Hill near Alton Priors, Wiltshire, England. Fieldbetween thetwo hills had large, new crop formation on Sunday morning, August 13, afterstrange unidentified light seen prior to midnight on August 12, 2000.His videotape not only shows at least six mysterious lights clearly, but hiscamera was taping as a Puma helicopter, perhaps from either the Royal Air"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Force or Army, moved quickly into the field where the lights were. At theappearance of the helicopter, the first white lights disappeared. After thehelicopter had circled twice over the crop and left, more white lights returnedtraveling across the field where the August 13, 2000 formation would lateremerge. At one point on Andy's tape, one of the lights splits in two in a singlevideo frame which is 1/30th of a second.I had with me 7 x 35 Bushnell binoculars and an ITT Night Vision F6015 scopewith infrared capability that \"sees\" heat. Its lens magnification was 3x. Andy hada Panasonic video camera and tripod. The nearly full moon cast so much lightthat through the Night Vision scope, I could clearly see individual stalks ofwheat in the ripe field that lay below us between Woodborough Hill and PickledHill to the east.When Andy walked down the hill many yards away towards the wheat at onepoint, I could clearly recognize his face in the starscope. As I scanned down thetramlines created by the farmer's tractor, they were empty. No one was in thefield and we were the only people on Woodborough Hill.I had handed the Night Vision scope to Hazel so she could see how clearly itboth magnified objects and showed them almost as if it were daylight because ofits ability to gather light from the stars and moon to enhance visibility in thedark. I had in fact been using the scope earlier in August when there was nomoon and fog covered the hills, yet light and heat sources stood out clearly,including a pulsing and still unidentified object that jumped from point to pointand grew much brighter when seven of us spoke. For more about that incident,see upcoming Earthfile's report about the unidentified pulsing light in the WestStowell field.While Hazel was looking through the scope, I was looking through mybinoculars to scan the northern horizon of hills that stretch in an east to westdirection in the Vale of Pewsey. One of those hills, Golden Ball Hill, has acluster of trees at its top. Above those trees, I suddenly saw an orange color thatwas distinctly different than any other object in the sky. The object was roundand stationary.Drawing by Linda Moulton Howe of unidentified aerial object as seen through magnifyingbinocularsfrom Woodborough Hill, Wiltshire, England around 10:30 PM above the trees atop nearbyGolden Ball Hill to the north.To the naked eye without binoculars, it appeared the size of a bright orange star.The quality of the orange light reminded me of the halo that surrounds laserbeams. Embedded inside the round, orange halo were two lights. One was veryyellow and seemed embedded in the middle of the orange object on the left side.A little lower, smaller, and to the right was a white light. There seemed to be ashimmering interaction between the yellow and white lights.I asked Hazel and Andy to look where my binoculars were pointing to see whatthey could see. Hazel found the object in the Night Vision scope and said it was"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"round and had two hot spots within a round haze in the green-graymonochromatic image typical of night vision scopes. Inexplicably, the NightVision scope with infrared sensitivity gave Hazel the impression that the light onthe right was bigger than the one on the left, but she could not see colors. Hazeland I kept describing for each other what we were seeing through our respectivedifferent lenses - mine binoculars, hers the night vision scope - while Andystarted setting up his video camera on a tripod. He confirmed that he could seewith his unaided eyes an orange glow low in the northern sky above GoldenBall Hill.After several seconds, Hazel and I both said at the same time, \"It's blinked out.Just disappeared.\" I was looking at a black space and Hazel could not see anytrace of the object that had been there. If it were an aerial craft, logic says itwould have heat that the infrared scope would still be able to register even if thelights were shut off. The complete absence of any image in the night visionscope implied that when the orange object blinked out, it was also not therephysically. But to where did it \"pop out?\"Hazel and I kept our lenses on the spot where the orange object had been,waiting for several seconds. Then to my amazement, a sparkle of intense fireengine red literally burst into the top of my binoculars frame resembling aFourth of July sparkler, pulsed out and immediately appeared in the far left ofthe frame as another intense red sparkle burst, pulsed out and immediatelyappeared in the bottom of the frame as a silver-white sparkle burst. Thissequence continued with the three red, red, white bursts in counter-clockwiserotation in the same stationary position we had seen the orange glowing object.Graphic depiction by Linda Howe of the \"Fourth of July sparkler\" bursts in bright red andwhitethat pulsed counter-clockwise at a rapid rate in same location that the orange objectdisappeared.Then, Andy said he could see the red flashes and was getting his camera on atripod and focused on it. Almost simultaneously, the pulsing flashes began tomove to my left, or west over Knap Hill and on down the chain of hills. Itsmotion was not rapid, but steadily moving south. Hazel could see the pulseswithout seeing their colors in the Night Vision scope. Andy finally got his lenson the moving object again and videotaped three seconds before the pulsingobject went behind a dark cloud. We waited for it to come out, but theunidentified object never appeared again. In those three seconds of tape, Andysaid the sparkles are covering a large area of the sky compared to the typicalblinking lights of an airliner. He said that even though the sequence is short, it isvery similar to a longer videotaped sequence he photographed last August 1999when several of us watched sparkles pulsing in a counter-clockwise rotationfrom several locations at and around Woodborough Hill. But the color then wassky blue and white, not red and white.We stayed on top of Woodborough Hill August 12th until near midnight.

The tramlines remained empty and the field was a solid mass ofstanding wheat except for one small circle near the grassy top of WoodboroughHill that had appeared earlier in the season.So, it was almost shocking to learn the next morning that a large, complicatedpattern was discovered in that same wheat field by Ulrich Kox from Germanywho was driving around looking for new crop formations. I immediatelyreturned to Woodborough Hill where the new formation was sculpted instanding and flattened crop covering about 250 feet in diameter.Morning of Sunday, August 13, 2000, Linda Howe is standing in new wheat formationbetweenWoodborough Hill and Pickled Hill where she and others saw through a Night Vision scopeas late asmidnight only hours before that there was no formation and no people in that field.Photograph taken with help of Bob Nicholas © 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe.Could it have been created between midnight and sunrise as some people claimwho champion the human-made theory? Or did the strange orange light thattransformed into the red and white pulses have something to do with thecreation?The mysterious lights and their link to crop formations are a global phenomenonand not confined to Woodborough Hill or Wiltshire, England. So, what wasbehind the press release in the second week of August from former Britishresident and now American-based researcher, Colin Andrews, asserting that atleast 80% of crop formations are human-made without any hard evidence toback up the statistical claim? Was he talking only about Wiltshire? Is a counter-intelligence unit trying to deliberately claim hoaxes in order to confuse thepublic and media again as Doug and Dave did back in September 1991?Finally, if even the human circle makers agree that at least 20% of the globalcrop circle phenomenon is unexplained, who - or what - has been creatingsymbols and patterns with repeating mathematical themes in fields around thisplanet for more than a decade? And why?More Information:Coming up in Earthfiles.com news, more about the West Stowell pulsing lightand an interview with Andrew Buckley about the intelligence he has sensed inthe lights he has now videotaped more than a dozen times in or near cropformations.We b s it e s :http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund PolicyCopyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
