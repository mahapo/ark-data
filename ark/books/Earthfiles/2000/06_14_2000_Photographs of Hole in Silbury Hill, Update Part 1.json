Photograph © 2000 Wiltshire Gazettte and Herald.June 14, 2000 Silbury Hill, Wiltshire, England - Around 3700 B. C. - almost6,000 years ago by some estimates - an enormous complex of stone avenues,stone circles and the largest artificially constructed mound in all of Europe werecreated in Avebury, England. The huge artificial mound that rises 130 feet andcovers five acres at its base is known as Silbury Hill. Two weeks ago on May29th, a large hole was discovered on top. The last time there was any suchwound in the great hill was 1776 when the Duke of Northumberland decided tolook for buried treasure inside. When he found nothing, his workers closed upthe shaft they had dug - perhaps only \"capping\" the top - which apparently nowmore than 200 years later has sunk in. Witnesses also reportedly sawunidentified lights near Silbury Hill and the West Kennett Long Barrow aroundthe end of May and first of June, but no one knows if there is a connection tothe large transforming crop formation that appeared June 1-2 in the WestKennett Long Barrow, followed by two more large formations on June 11, 2000in the barley field right next to Silbury Hill.The private British charity called the National Trust that cares for Neolithic andother sacred sites in the United Kingdom is responsible for the repair andpreservation of Silbury and has sealed off the hill while engineers andarchaeologists decide what to do. Today, I talked with the National Trust'sAvebury Property Manager, Chis Gingell, who inspected the hole in Silburyshortly after the police were notified on May 29th. I asked him what he couldsee.Interview:"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Chris Gingell, Avebury Property Manager, National Trust Estate, Avebury,Wiltshire, England:\"The hillside is a flat grassy summit on a big conical hill 130 feet high. Thegrassy summit is perhaps 50 or 60 feet in diameter. And there are a number ofshallow depressions in the turf. And in one of these shallow depressions wasthis ragged hole in the turf perhaps 5 feet across. It had freshly broken, so theturf was hanging dangerously into the hole. If you lay down and wriggledtowards the hole and peered down inside, once your eyes had adjusted yourealized it was just the opening of a vertical shaft rather wider than the tear inthe turf at the surface. The shaft was about 7 feet square. And once your eyeshad adjusted you could see that it was 30 to 40 feet deep. Our measurement wasabout 34 feet.Local residents inspecting the unexpected hole that opened in the topof ancient Silbury Hill, Wiltshire, England on May 29, 2000.

But we understand from mining engineers and archaeologists,indeed, who worked on early mining sites in Britain. Remember this shaft wasdug for antiquarian purposes and was dug by professional miners.YOU MEAN THE 1776 DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND?Indeed, indeed. There were two near contemporary reports about the Duke ofNorthumberland's and Col. Drax's excavation on Silbury Hill. One report fromminers came from Cornwall. And the other came from the Mendip Hills. Thoseare both traditional mining areas in the west of England. And certainly the wayit's cut is reminiscent of early hand-excavated professional mine shafts.ANOTHER QUESTION: WHY WOULD THEY HAVE GONEVERTICALLY DOWN? WHY NOT IN HORIZONTALLY AT THE BASE"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"OF SILBURY HILL IN?I suspect that in many ways, that a vertical shaft if they were going to the centerof such a, it's quite a big hill. A vertical shaft would be their preferred method.You see, it wouldn't need shoring up in this loose chalk rubble the way ahorizontal tunnel would. It would in many ways have been similar to digging awell shaft. A little bit of propping up and a little bit of timber supports so themen could climb in and out and some sort of platform to hoist the material. Butit wouldn't necessarily be such a complex operation as going in as a horizontaltunnel.HAVE YOU SEEN ANY EVIDENCE HAVING BEEN THERE ANDLOOKED INTO THE HOLE YOURSELF OF ANY REINFORCEMENTSAROUND THAT 7 FOOT SQUARE SHAFT?No, it's just cut, clean cut through the chalk rubble. And what you can see is theway the capping of chalk rubble - this is local soft limestone - the way thiscapping has broken at the surface. It appears that early miners, probably almostup to the 20th Century, were in the habit once they had finished with a mineshaft, not of filling it completely, but simply of capping it. To do that, they putin a timber platform. It might be one of the platforms they actually used whenthey were digging the shaft, boarded over and poured ground rubble on top ofthat just a few yards thick at the top of the shaft. Really just plugging the top ofthe shaft. And in areas in Britain where there are long histories of mining, thereis a continuous problem of mine shafts opening up in this way.WOULD ALL OF THIS SOIL THAT'S GOT TO BE IN THE HUNDREDSOF TONS TO FILL UP A 7 FOOT BY 7 FOOT BY 34 FOOT OPENING -WHERE WOULD ALL THAT SOIL HAVE GONE IN THE FIRSTPLACE?Right, I described the top of the hill as being quite a narrow flat platform. Weknow from both contemporary records and the fact that the bottom of this shaftwas canted in later excavations which were tunneled in from the side of the hill,we know that the shaft itself was approximately 100 feet deep. Now, that bulkof soil from a shaft 100 feet deep and 7 feet square...THAT'S THE DUKE OF NORTHUMBERLAND'S 1776.That's right. The bulk of chalk and soil excavated from that probably wouldn'thave fitted on the narrow summit around the mouth of the shaft on top of thehill. In other words, some of it would have spilled over the sides of the hill. AndI imagine what happened is that when they finished the shaft when theexcavation was completed from their point of view, disappointed not to findsome sort of great burial in the center of the hill, what soil and chalk was left intheir heap at the top of the hill, presumably would have been shoveled backdown the shaft. And then a certain part of it was kept back to cap or plug themouth of the shaft itself. And it's that plugging that has finally collapsed downinto the shaft.WHAT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF LOWERING ANARCHAEOLOGIST RIGHT DOWN THROUGH THAT HOLE FROM AHELICOPTER WITH GOOD LIGHT TO TAKE SOME REALLYEXCELLENT PHOTOGRAPHS OF WHAT HAS BEEN ONE OF THEMOST MYSTERIOUS MOUNDS IN ALL THE WORLD'S HISTORY OFTHE LAST 6,000 YEARS ABOUT WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OFSILBURY HILL'S CONSTRUCTION AND, AS I UNDERSTAND, IT ISACTUALLY CONSTRUCTED WITH LAYERS OF DIFFERENTCOLORED CHALK IN THE CENTER AND NO ONE REALLY KNOWSWHY.Yes, I think access to the hole itself on the present advice we have would not beconsidered because the sides of the shaft are so unsafe. That doesn't mean,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"however, that we can't get a first class photographic and measured survey of thehole itself with remote-controlled cameras - both video and still cameras -methods called photogrammetry, which is taking photographs from fixedpositions so you build up a continuous carefully positioned sort of photographicimage of inside the shaft. A technique like that is quite possible. But the shaftitself, the material through which it was dug - although an ancient man-madefeature is still a man-made rubble mound. The material around the shaft isextremely unstable. The only way you could get safe access to it would be toline it and lining it would be self-defeating because you couldn't actually thenexamine the sides of the shaft that you wish to. So, I think the first choice willbe to use remote-control cameras.WOULD YOU BE WILLING AS AN ARCHAEOLOGIST TO BELOWERED DOWN INTO THAT HOLE?Oh, into a hole of that size, having worked in prehistoric flint mines in the eastof England many years ago, to go into a hole that type and size would be a greatchallenge and experience for an archaeologist. It's just that in this particularcase, none of the organizations involved in managing Silbury Hill would beprepared for anybody to be exposed to the danger of working within the shaftitself. That's not to say we won't get a good record of it.\"More Information:See Hole in Silbury Hill, Update Part 2.We b s it e s :http://www.thisiswiltshire.co.uk/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
