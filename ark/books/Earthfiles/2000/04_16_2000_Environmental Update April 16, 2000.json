C. - This past week, President Bill Clintondeclared a large section of the Sequoia National Forest in California to be a\"national monument\" in order to permanently preserve the giant redwood trees.The President used his executive authority under the 1906 Antiquities Actwhich allows U. S. Presidents to safeguard objects of historic or scientificinterest without going to Congress.President Clinton said, \"These giant sequoias clearly are the work of the ages.They grow taller than the Statue of Liberty. This is not about locking lands up.It is about freeing them up for all Americans for all time.\"Some sequoia are more than 3000 years old, rise up to 300 feet tall, measure100 feet around the base and have been described as Nature's cathedrals. Acouple of centuries ago, the sequoia grew all over western North America. Butafter humans began to settle into the land and cut so many down, only 70 grovesare left on the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountains in CentralCalifornia. Now President Clinton's declaration that the unique trees are anational monument should give the sequoia a long future.This is a positive step for the earth, but at the same time, Africa is losing morethan nine million acres of forests each year. Trees are being cut down at a rapidrate for farming, animal grazing and lumber production. The United NationsFood and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) warns that deforestation is aserious threat to the African continent which contains the second-largest reserveof tropical forests after the South American Amazon regions."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Culex pipiens mosquito.For the first time in New York City's history, the health department on April17th will officially attack mosquitoes. The reason is West Nile Fever Virus thatshowed up last year for the first time in North American history, infected birdsand humans and caused the death of half a dozen people in New York. Last fall,the insecticide Malathion was heavily sprayed to control mosquitoes that carrythe West Nile Virus between birds and humans.All that poison in the air angered residents and provoked political retaliationfrom lobstermen who said 95% of the lobsters from Connecticut to Long IslandSound suddenly died off after the Malathion spraying. Now, the New YorkHealth Department says it will spray insecticides only as a last resort and won'tuse Malathion at all. Instead, the city and state will use mosquito-eating fish andlarvae-killing chemicals. Mosquito-control experts say it is much more effectiveanyway to attack the larvae than to spray pesticides at adult mosquitoes, andindirectly at people, animals and marine life.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
