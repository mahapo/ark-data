K.Order Information BelowJuly 9, 2000 Wiltshire, England - While researching for my next book aboutmysterious lights and crop circles, I found fascinating history and facts about thecenter of the crop circle mystery, Wiltshire, England, in a recent book entitled,Legendary Landscapes, Secrets of Ancient Wiltshire Revealed by Julie andJohn Wakefield who live in Marlborough. This work is essential reading foranyone interested in prehistoric Avebury, the region's Neolithic ancestors andthe rites that were performed in a land filled with stone circles, avenues, longbarrows and rock mounds whose exact purposes are still unknown. In thedecade of the 1990s and ongoing, some of the largest and most spectacular cropformations in the world have been focused in Wiltshire's Vale of Pewsey whichthe Wakefields have discovered is connected to Avebury and the large landcanvass upon which cycles of birth, death, fertility, harvests, the sun, moon andstars were tracked for survival and communication with the Infinite Source.One particularly surprising revelation is described by the Wakefields:\"The Neolithic people appear to have placed particular sites onto thenatural rolling hills to accentuate their womanly shape; so much sothat they have created an incredible architectural icon. Could thisreally be possible - or could the position of the monuments that seemto make up this female form be mere coincidence and not intentionalat all? ... There are many examples of vulvas engraved on rocksurfaces in caves, some of which are reddened with ochre which wassymbolic of life-giving blood. The carvings date by tool association toaround 30,000 B. C. ...(In Wiltshire) The two hills that form thebreasts of the Alton Barnes Goddess are Milk Hill and Walker's Hill.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"With drawings and photographs, the Wakefields show how thosehauntingly beautiful hills in the Vale of Pewsey were seen byNeolithic minds as breasts and the body of a goddess with anaccompanying serpent.\"Other research the authors have done about the archaeological finds of Egyptianand Mesopotamian beads, other objects and name connections between Englandand Egypt are another reason that Legendary Landscapes should be read andtreasured as an invaluable archive and reference.More Information:Legendary Landscapes, Secrets of Ancient Wiltshire Revealed by Julie andJohn Wakefield.This book can be order from:Nod PressP.
