Now, the borough of Conshohocken west ofPhiladelphia has become the second community in Pennsylvania to prohibitmotor vehicle drivers from using cell phones while driving. Pennsylvania'sgovernor is even considering a legislative proposal to ban cell phone use bydrivers throughout the state. Recently a 2-year-old girl was killed in a collisioncaused by a driver dialing a cell phone. Another child was recently killed by adistracted cell phone user. Conshohocken Police Chief James Dougherty added,\"We've had problems with people driving through town talking on cell phoneswhere they've almost hit people. They're not paying attention.\"Dozens of medical research studies have also concluded that the microwavefrequencies coming into the heads of cell phone users are enough to causeneurological changes in brains that can produce fatigue, dizziness and loss ofconcentration. Recently I talked with Neil Cherry, Ph.D., Biophysicist atLincoln University in Christ Church, New Zealand. Dr. Cherry considers theproliferation of cell phones, microwave towers and microwave pollution to be aserious contributor to cancer, brain tumors and increasing neurological problemsamong the human population.Interview:Neil Cherry, Ph.D., Biophysicist, Lincoln University in Christ Church,New Zealand: \"Cell phone users in Sweden 11,000 Scandinavian cell phoneusers were studied and they showed significant neurological effects in a doseresponse manner.Such as?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Such as headaches, fatigue, tiredness and dizziness and a study in Australia alsoshowed nausea. So, neurological effects, hormone effects, show that all theseexposures are damaging cells, are changing the cell to cell communication in thebrain causing neurological effects. And we now also have studies showingchronic neurological problems of depression, arteriosclerosis and Alzheimer's'' inelectrical industry. So, this is not a surprising result with the soup ofelectromagnetic radiation we are living in these days.Are you saying that people who work in the electrical industry or are anelectrician or working on power lines or in microwaves will have a higherincident of neurological problems?That's right. That's what these studies show. There is also a higher incidence ofcardiac problems. A recent study showed a definite dose response manner interms of the timing function in hearts. You get more heart attacks and more heartdisease. So, we now have a very large body of science showing that brains andhearts and bodies in across the spectrum exposure from power lines, fromappliances and electrical industries, military personnel working with radio andradar get sickness which is associated with cell deaths and accelerated agingtowards cancer, accelerated aging towards neurological problems. It has nowbeen shown in many studies.Looking at this from your perspective as a biophysicist, what can be doneto protect animal, plant and human life from a proliferation of microwavesand extreme low frequency waves?We can design houses to reduce the exposure to people living in them. We candesign appliances like cell phones and microwave ovens, televisions andcomputer screens so they are not exposing the users as much as present devicesdo. We can have corridors for utilities like power lines. In New Zealand andother countries, power lines go right over houses. That shouldn't happen.We have a very big push around the world at the moment to go mobile, to usemobile phones, to not use the wired telephone. The wired telephone is muchmore benign than the mobile phone. And we should be wiring up our cities withfiber optic cables to provide internet, FAX, telephone, radio and television atvery high quality to houses and cities, rather than saturating our cities with themicrowave, radio wave and low frequency signals all the time. There are plentyof ways of fixing the problem.So, a shift from microwave transmission to fiber optic cable woulddiminish this negative impact a great deal?Yes. So instead of having a very large tower like in San Francisco with dozensand now probably hundreds of antennas on it radiating people in the Bay area;or in Golden, Colorado there is an antenna farm that radiates people in theDenver and Golden area - all those signals could be put in fiber optic cable atfar higher quality and there is no electromagnetic radiation from that cable. Butit would also be more expensive. The situation is: the carriers, thetelecommunications companies, are using the atmosphere and polluting it justlike the factories and nuclear power stations have in the past, rather than puttingtheir pollution in pipes. In this case, fiber optic pipes so there is no emissionfrom them.Given the fact there has been enough research documenting these negativeeffects neurologically and in other ways after exposure to microwaves andextreme low frequencies (ELF), why wouldn't industry and politicalsystems want to push for fiber optics to reduce harm to people?Money drives the system, doesn't it? And the companies are based onshareholders' profits and if a company is allowed in one part of the world to usethe atmosphere and another country tightens up and says, like the United Statesestablished this policy of going from wireless to fiber optic cables, then theywould carry the cost. And it's a cost-driven system that is not driven by the"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"public health system. That's how you get these decisions. Just like in the tobaccoindustry, for decades the industry will deny the evidence of these effects. Theywould deny that these studies exist or they deny the quality of these studiesbecause it is far cheaper for them to make profits by polluting the air rather thanthe higher cost technology.But in the long run, those industries that move into this area (of fiber optics) firstand the same with the oil companies and those who are moving to have moreefficient energy, those who move to more efficient telecommunications willprobably make the biggest profits in the long run as these studies get more andmore strength behind them and the public hear about them and say industry isignoring them. Hopefully, governments eventually will take the independentadvice - not industry advice - and will protect the public health and move tolead the world in this area of finding new clean technology. It's an old fashionedterm, clean technology. Telecommunications currently is dirty technology, notclean technology.Except for those areas that are trying to convert over to fiber optic cable?Yes, those are the leading industries and they will find that they can get farhigher signals down those cables, with far bigger bandwidth, far faster cleanerdata transfer than you can through the atmosphere with thunderstorms,geomagnetic activity and all sorts of activity does interfere with the signals.For example, the telecommunication operators in the Southwest Pacific havejust made a very expensive cable from Australia and New Zealand to the UnitedStates because they can't rely on satellites. And they thought they could.For people who have cell phones, what is the current state of the art on themost recently manufactured cell phones in terms of protecting users frommicrowave radiation?There are the hands-free kits available and there are also information on theinternet on the levels of exposure of each of the cell phones manufactured. Butpeople should be choosing cell phones that have low emissions, they should bechoosing hands free, they should also choose not to use a cell phone when anordinary telephone is available. And that way, the cell phone companies will beencouraged to put shields around their cell phones before they sell them and tomake sure the antenna is pointing at the cell site, mobile phone site, not at yourhead.For people who were some of the first users of cell phones and exposed tomicrowave frequencies over the past decade or so, what is the increasedrisk of cancer or neurological disease in those people?The risk is extremely high. I have established that there are 66 epidemiologicalstudies showing that electromagnetic radiation across the spectrum increasebrain tumors in human populations. Two of those studies are for particular braintumors from cell phones. I am expecting because these cell phone exposures ofthe head is far higher than even the highest military exposures for which we findvery large increases in cancer - then cell phone users will be showing thesesymptoms. But the latency of cancer is decades. And so we need a largepopulation for about two to three decades using these cell phones for a largeincrease in brain tumors to be observed.The neurological effects, though, are coming earlier and we're already seeingthose as acute effects that are noticed within minutes of using a cell phone. Butthe neurological disease requires a good portion of the brain to be damaged.That takes time because our bodies are working very hard to repair the damageand the continuing accumulation of damage over decades will show a very largeincrease in neurological effects, memory loss, headaches and the concentrationproblem. So when people, for example, start to have those affects, are drivingthe car and are using their cell phones so their attention is diverted, there will be"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"a large increase in road accidents and that is already starting to occur. It's beennoticed in some areas that the use of cell phones while driving is being looked atvery carefully. But it is also the actual neurological effects of reducing theconcentration, of producing neurological dysfunction while you are drivingwhich is a very scary thing on our very busy roads.It is not simply the distraction of talking to somebody on the phone asmuch as it is that you and others have been able to verify that the very actof talking on a cell phone and being exposed to microwave frequencies doeshave a deleterious effect on the brain's ability to concentrate?That's right. The Univ. of Washington exposed rats, for example, to a microwavesignal and ELF signal having learned the task of swimming and finding a way toget out of a pool. When they were exposed, they couldn't find their way out. So,that showed that microwaves in rats produce these problems. The experiment ofusing cell phones has shown similar effects that cell phones changes your way ofrecalling information.And some frequencies, we know from electromagnetic radiation, interfere withtheir brain frequencies and speed up a reaction time and other frequencies slowdown our reaction times. This has been known now for 30 years. The work wasdone at the Max Planck Institute and the Munich Technical University in the1950s and 1960s, where you could change peoples' reaction times at will usinglow frequency signals. So, we are exposing people to a thousand times highersignals using cell phones than that signal; therefore, I'm not surprised that we'veseen these neurological effects.Do you think it will come to the point that political systems will begin tomove to banning the use of cell phones in automobiles in general?That I think will be an early political response to the growing data. It will bepart of a series of political responses. There is now a strong move that is beingopposed strongly by industry to put health warnings on cell phones. We shouldget information out to the public about driving because that's a very clear risk.And then, the use of the cell phones about the neurological and brain tumorproblem is another one to put a health warning on. And we can see the historyof pattern in the tobacco industry being followed quite precisely in the cellphone industry because the effects were known and shown very early. And that'strue with the cell phone.\"More Information:\"There is strong evidence that extreme lowfrequency (ELF) and radio frequencymicrowaves (RF/MW) are associated withaccelerated aging (enhanced cell death andcancer) and moods, depression, suicide, anger,rage and violence, primarily through alterationof cellular calcium ions and themelatonin/serotonin balance.\"- Dr. Neil Cherry, Lincoln University, NewZealand from his June 1998 report, \"Actual orpotential effects of ELF and RF/MW radiationon accelerating aging of human, animal or plantcells.\"See the book Electromagnetic Fields, A Consumer's Guide to the Issues andHow to Protect Ourselves by B.
