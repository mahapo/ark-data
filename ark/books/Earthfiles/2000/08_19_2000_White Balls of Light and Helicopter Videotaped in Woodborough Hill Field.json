Buckley of Manchester, England.This map of events © 2000 by Andrew J. Buckley.August 19, 2000 Woodborough Hill near Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, England- Recently during my research trip to England, I met and talked with Manchestergraphic artist, Andrew J. Buckley. He showed me about a dozen videotapes hehas taken the past few years of mysterious aerial lights associated with cropformations in the county of Wiltshire. The most dramatic incident occurred thissummer on Friday, July 18, 2000, between 8 and 8:15 PM. Andy was onPickled Hill aiming his camera toward Woodborough Hill to view and videotapetwo small formations that had emerged in the fields below.Interview:Andrew J. Buckley, Graphic Artist, Manchester, England: \"It was a littlebefore 8 PM and I had only been there five minutes or so when out of the cornerof my eyes, I saw a flash coming from the field on the left. I was surprised to seea small, bright object moving along the surface of the plowed field at the foot ofthe hills.HOW WOULD YOU CHARACTERIZE IT IN TERMS OF COLOR ANDSIZE?It was obviously quite bright. It was also quite small. I would estimatesomewhere around a football or beach ball, maybe sort of about 12 to 15 inchesin diameter and sharply outlined.COLOR?"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"White. All the lights I filmed were white in color. And it was moving quicklyquite close to the ground, maybe only a few inches above the ground. But itseemed to be maneuvering along the contours of the hill as if it were aware ofthe hillside. It increased in altitude slightly when it came to a divide in the field.There was a sort of small crop formation next to Woodborough Hill, a simplecircle, and it moved across that formation before disappearing from my view.I was quite annoyed that I hadn't unpacked my video camera at the time. Thelight disappeared and I thought it would have been nice to have recorded it. Iwas also surprised to see it. And I wasn't expecting to see anything else, so Iunpacked the recorder and started to film the formation which was down belowin the fields.Again, I had only been filming for a minute or so when something caught myattention and I saw another object quite similar to the first. But this time itseemed to be moving in a slightly different direction. It appeared more closely tome and moving across my field of vision and again across the crop formation.This time I got my camera ready and got it (the light) quite quickly and manageda few minutes of footage. And then it kind of moved away again and out of thefield of view.Almost immediately, I saw another object! And I thought, 'This is veryinteresting. How many more?' While I was filming this object which was verysimilar to the others - they are all roughly the same size - I heard quite a loudnoise. I was looking through the viewfinder and couldn't see around me whatwas making this noise. I just assumed it was a tractor or something. It soundedlike that. Then the light went out of view and I put my camera down. Comingfrom behind the trees on Woodborough Hill was a helicopter which was makinga very loud noise, a military helicopter. And it appeared over the summit of thehill where the lights had been flying and kind of moved around in that area.Later, I identified the helicopter as being a Puma which I think is RAF (RoyalAir Force) rather than an Army helicopter.Anyway, this helicopter seemed to bank slightly towards Knap Hill which is tothe north and flew across in that direction and I got my camera on it. I alsothought there might be other lights, but I couldn't see any at the time.DID YOU HAVE THE IMPRESSION THAT THE HELICOPTER WASTRYING TO ENGAGE WITH THE LIGHTS? CHASE THEM AWAY?DID YOU HAVE ANY SENSE THAT THE HELICOPTER WASFOCUSED WHERE YOU SAW THE LIGHT MOTION?Sure, yeah. I'm fairly familiar with military helicopter activity in the area andthere is quite a lot of helicopter maneuvers going on, mainly over towardsSalisbury Plain. But occasionally we get some down in the valley. But that timeof evening, It's quite unusual to see military helicopters flying around in thatarea. I did get the impression that the helicopter was aware of these objectsbecause it was circling in the same vicinity. Had an object been flying around,the pilots must have seen them, but I couldn't see any at the time.THE SUN WAS STILL UP?Yeah. It was a fine evening. The sun would still be up, setting, and the time thatthe first object appeared would be sort of five minutes to eight o'clock in theevening, so the sun would still be quite high up. And the objects appeared overthe next ten to fifteen minutes. The helicopter appeared in the area circling andwhile I was filming, I was aware there were some people coming up behind meon the hill. I could hear these voices getting louder and I glanced away and saweight to ten men standing behind me which was quite unnerving. It turned outthey were soldiers and they were on some kind of cross country run. They wereall in some kind of running gear. And they stood behind me and watched mefilm the helicopter. They made certain comments regarding the helicopter such"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"as, 'That's one of our mates.' And were waving to it. And they were making somevery joking remarks about the crop formation like they had made it, or it wasone of theirs, or something, 'We did it the other night.' They stood there a minuteor so and I managed to get a few of them on film and you can hear them on thesoundtrack. Then they just ran off down the hill.While all this was going on, the helicopter had come back again across thevalley behind Woodborough Hill and went up towards the WoodboroughVillage direction. Then it suddenly banked to the right and came back again.Now, as I was filming, I didn't actually see this at the time, but when I playedback the tape, a light had actually appeared. It flew on a diagonal from bottomto top in front of the helicopter, but I would say the helicopter was quite adistance from the light. Whether the helicopter pilot saw it or not, I don't know.Anyway, the helicopter just kind of flew again across the other side of the valleyand then flew off towards Pewsey and I never saw it again. So, I carried onfilming and to my amazement, the objects reappeared and I saw two objects,small, and they seemed to be rotating around each other, kind of flying veryclose to the ground. And then the one went in one direction and I decided Iwould follow one of the objects. I don't know where the other one went to.The one I followed flew across the field of view. It really speeded updramatically compared to the others which were quite leisurely. This oneincreased in speed and it was really quite difficult to follow it in the camera. Itflew to my right down the valley and again disappeared. And then almostimmediately, I saw two others which again I filmed. These were much largerthan the previous two and seemed to be brighter as well. Again, they speeded upand moved across the field and one of the lights split in two in one frame of thevideotape which is 1/30th of a second. Then they all disappeared. And that wasit. After that, I didn't notice any more lights.THAT WAS ON THE NIGHT OF JULY 18TH. WERE THERE ANYMORE FORMATIONS IN THE AREA AFTER THAT?Yes, a new formation appeared quite close by at the Woodborough Canal Bridgewhich would be roughly where the lights were coming from.THAT WAS THE FIRST FORMATION I WAS IN. I GOT HERE ON THENIGHT OF JULY 18TH AND WE WERE IN THAT ONE IN THEMORNING. IT WAS A VERY INTERESTING FORMATION, THE ONEAT THE BRIDGE. WERE YOU IN IT?Yes, I did go in it the following day to look at it. I was quite surprised to see it. Ihad not seen a formation there before. But at the time I hadn't connected itnecessarily with the appearance of the lights. But now you mention it, it wasvery interesting because the lights appeared to come roughly from that area.IN THE CONTEXT OF PRESS RELEASES IN THE SECOND WEEK OFAUGUST (BY COLIN ANDREWS) THAT 80 TO 90 PERCENT OF THECROP FORMATIONS IN WILTSHIRE ARE MANMADE. WHAT ISYOUR COMMENT ON THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF MORE THANTEN YEARS OF FORMATIONS IN WILTSHIRE AND WORLDWIDE.I have seen no evidence that 80 % are manmade. Various people have claimed tomake formations and there have been commissioned formations which I supposedon't count as hoaxes because we know who made the formations. But withregard to the other claims, I'm still waiting to see any evidence. I haven't seenany hard evidence.WHY DO YOU THINK SOME PEOPLE ARE GOING ON NATIONALAND GLOBAL MEDIA TO MAKE SUCH A CLAIM?I suspect they have their own agendas whatever they are. I would say that in my"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"own opinion, there is quite a lot of misinformation going around. There has beenmisinformation regarding crop circles for years.\"More Information:Coming up in Earthfiles.com news, more about the West Stowell pulsing lightand an interview with Andrew Buckley about the intelligence he has sensed inthe lights he has now videotaped more than a dozen times in or near cropformations.We b s it e s :http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
