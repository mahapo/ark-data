It's all fossilized, of course, butnow modern CT scanning technology has confirmed it's four chambered withone aorta like warm-blooded animals today, not the cold-blooded reptilianmetabolism assumed for dinosaurs over the past 150 years.This is the first time in history that an internal dinosaur organ has been found -literally a \"heart of stone\" inside the whole body fossil of a creature that wasalive on earth 66 million years ago right at the end of the Age of Dinosaurs. Thenew fossil is a Thescelosaurus. That dinosaur was about 13 feet long, weighedover 600 pounds, ate only plants and had to eat a lot of them to sustain itswarm-blooded heart.Ornithischia Thescelosaurus (T. neglectus). Thescelosaurus means \"marvelous lizard.\"Roamed from Wyoming and the Dakotas into Alberta, Canada 66 million years old at theendof the Cretaceous period eating vegetation.13 feet long, about 665 pounds. First dinosaur tohave afour chambered heart confirmed by modern day CT scanning. Artist's rendition by EdHeck.I talked this week with the man who did the CT scan on the fossil heart and Ialso talked to a dinosaur expert.First, Paul Fisher is Director of the BiomedicalImaging Facility at North Carolina State College of Veterinarian Medicine wherehe is also working on his Ph.D. in Paleontology. The past 24 years he has"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"worked with CT Scanners. CT stands for \"computerized tomography.\" Instead ofnormal X-rays which are imaged on a flat medium like a photograph, CT scansgo through the body taking electronic image slices as you would slice a loaf ofbread. The computer then puts all the slices together for a complete3-dimensional electronic look at the internal body structure and organs.But how do you do this with a dinosaur body that's turned to rock?Interviews:The CT Scan DiscoveryPaul Fisher, Director, Biomedical Imaging Facility, North Carolina StateCollege of Veterinarian Medicine, Raleigh, North Carolina: \"The heart isalso fossilized. So everything is rock. We're not really looking at soft tissue.Everything has been fossilized. But there was enough CT works on the principalthat different structures have different densities. Therefore, they turn out to bedifferent shades of grey and you can see structures. There was enough differencein density that you could actually see structures within the thorax of thisparticular specimen. . One of the things I think is very unique about thisspecimen is that we really haven't used this technique before to look for softtissue structures in dinosaurs. We've done a lot of work CTing and doing x-raysand different imaging modalities, but we've always been looking at bones. This isthe first time we have looked specifically at something that used to be soft tissue.The dinosaur fossil hunter, Mike Hammer, who found the body at Hell's Creekexhumed the entire rock. It was so big and heavy that he very carefully cut itinto thirds. What we had was the middle third where the chest was.The white shaded area shows the fossilized chest section that Paul Fisherhad to make the CT scans of the Thescelosaurus dinosaur's stone heart that revealed fourchambers © 2000 by Paul Fisher, NCSU College of Veterinary Medicine BiomedicalImaging Resource Facility, Raleigh, North Carolina.THEN THAT WOULD FIT INTO A MODERN DAY CT SCANNER?Right. That part of thisThescelosaurus. dinosaur isn't much bigger than a humanbeing and Mike Hammer had pared away most of the rock from around it so itwould fit through the scanner.FROM YOUR TRAINED EYE, WHEN YOU FIRST GOT THAT INYOUR MACHINE, WHAT EXACTLY DID YOU SEE AND HOW DIDYOU KNOW FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WAS A FOUR CHAMBEREDHEART?It looks an awful lot like a heart on the 2-dimensional slices which is what youget out of a CT scanner. What we did from there is we put it in a softwaremodel, an image analysis system, and we made 3-D models, like taking slices ofbread and putting them all back together. We made a 3-D model of this. Whenwe had that model, it became very apparent that what we had was a4-chambered heart with a single aorta. It stood right out. It's one of those thingswhere a picture is worth a thousand words."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Enhanced 3-D composite images of dinosaur's thoraciccavity showing single aorta and four chambered heartfrom series of 2-D computerized tomography (CT) scans© 2000 by Paul Fisher, NCSU College of Veterinary MedicineBiomedical Imaging Resource Facility, Raleigh, North Carolina.The complete 3-D view of the area reconstructed from Paul Fisher's CT scans© 2000 by Paul Fisher, NCSU College of Veterinary Medicine BiomedicalImaging Resource Facility, Raleigh, North Carolina.WHAT WAS THE REACTION BASICALLY FROM EVERYONE'SPOINT OF VIEW EXACTLY AT THAT MOMENT THAT YOU WERELOOKING AT A 4-CHAMBERED HEART?Initially it was disbelief. This class of dinosaur was thought to be more like acrocodile, more of that sort of heart...WHICH WOULD BE COLD BLOODED, RIGHT?Right. Crocodiles have 4 chambers, but they have 2 systemic aortas. They havetwo arches coming out of their heart. This class of dinosaur was thought to bethat way and we actually spent a significant amount of time trying to make surethat it was a 4 chambered heart with a single aorta as opposed to something else.We took months to look at the data to make sure we weren't missing something.We came up with the same solution when we first saw it: it's a 4 chambered heartwith a single aorta. It's that of a creature that has a fairly high metabolism andwas probably warm blooded."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"False color 3-D reconstruction of dinosaur's chest cavity.

What we would like to do is get the specimen back and do much more highdetailed work on it and see if we can find some smaller structures. And we reallyhaven't scanned the abdomen. We want to go back and do detailed work on theabdomen.IS IT POSSIBLE THAT ALL THE DINOSAURS HAD 4 CHAMBERED,WARM BLOODED HEARTS?I think all of the dinosaurs and certainly the recent dinosaurs may have been, Iguess, what we could classify as warm blooded at least with a higher metabolismthan we originally thought.BUT WHAT ABOUT TRICERATOPS AND TYRANNOSAURUS REXAND THE ONES THAT WE'RE MORE FAMILIAR WITH? IS ITPOSSIBLE THEY HAD 4 CHAMBERED WARM BLOODED HEARTSAS WELL?It is. When you start to get into those kinds of huge animals, one of the thingsthat happens is you have to worry about how to get rid of heat rather than howto maintain it in your body. And you look at a Triceratops and they came upwith very elaborate mechanisms to dissipate heat from their bodies.MEANING THAT THOSE STRANGE SPINY THINGS ALONG THEIRBODY WAS TO GET RID OF HEAT?Right. The big cowls around their head, the bony plates, were probably filledwith blood vessels and used to get rid of heat. So, they may certainly have had ahigher metabolism that we originally were thinking.WAS THERE ANY EVIDENCE IN THE PAST THAT WOULD GIVEACADEMICS A REASON TO PLACE DINOSAURS IN THEREPTILIAN COLD CHAMBERED HEART CATEGORY?No, when paleontology started 150 years ago or so and these bones were foundwith the big teeth. They looked like big lizards. And I think that's where at leasthistorically they looked like big lizards, they were classified as cold bloodedreptiles. And as we have learned more and found more specimens and foundthat many of them were herd animals and those kinds of things and then withthis specimen, having some proof that they had higher metabolisms or weremaybe warm blooded this changes our way of looking at things."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"IS THERE ANY FOSSIL EVIDENCE OF A CONNECTION BETWEENDINOSAURS AND REPTILIANS?No direct connection.THEN IT IS ODD THAT WE HAVE BEEN ON AN ASSUMPTION FORALL THESE DECADES THAT DINOSAURS WERE REPTILIAN WHENTHERE REALLY WASN'T ANY BIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE OR LINKTO PUT THEM INTO THE REPTILIAN CATEGORY.Man is an interesting creature. We believed the world was flat for a long, longtime. So, it's amazing what man will choose to believe on such slim evidence.OR DENY ON SLIM EVIDENCE.Exactly!\" The Warm Heart Impact On Dinosaur ScienceA PALEONTOLOGIST WORKING WITH PAUL FISHER IS REESEBARRICK, Ph. D., ALSO AT NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITY INTHE DEPARTMENT OF MARINE, EARTH AND ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE.I ASKED DR. BARRICK HOW THIS REVOLUTIONARY DISCOVERY OF AWARM BLOODED HEART WILL CHANGE OUR THINKING ABOUTDINOSAURS.Reese Barrick, Ph.D., Paleontologist in the Department of Marine, Earthand Atmospheric Science, North Carolina State University, Raleigh, NorthCarolina: \"Dinosaurs sort of dominated the earth for 180 million years and itwas always thought there was just a really warm time and they were really bigand slow and stupid and sat around with a very slow world. And now when wego back and look at it, we have to think of a world not so much in slow motion,but very similar in some senses as we have today with animals being active,migrating out searching for food, eating relatively frequently. A cold bloodedworld you would have Tyrannosaurus eating once every other month or a bigmeal once every four or five months. So if you saw a Tyrannosaurus, you mightnot be that scared because if he had eaten in the last two months, he might notbe that hungry. And now we have to look at them as a very active world wherethese guys are moving all the time and eating all the time and you run into acarnivorous dinosaur and he's probably got the endurance to chase you round.DO YOU THINK THE THEORY THAT AN ASTEROID SLAMMEDINTO THE CARIBBEAN WHERE THE YUCATAN PENINSULA IS OFFTHE COAST OF FLORIDA IS WHAT CAUSED THE MASSEXTINCTION OF THE DINOSAURS?I do think it is the best hypothesis because we know we have a crater and weknow we had an impact and any type of animal that is very large in body sizeand has a relatively high metabolic rate which means it has to eat all the time,certainly wouldn't survive very long if its food sources were gone. And that's justwhat the asteroid would have done - wipe out all the vegetation for anything toeat. So, if you were large and relatively warm blooded, you wouldn't have had achance.IRONICALLY, IF THEY HAD BEEN COLD BLOODED REPTILES,THEY MIGHT HAVE ACTUALLY SURVIVED?There might have been a few of the smaller dinosaurs had they really been coldblooded that would have survived.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"More Information:Entire dinosaur fossil with heart of stone is now on public display at NorthCarolina's State Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh, North Carolina.
