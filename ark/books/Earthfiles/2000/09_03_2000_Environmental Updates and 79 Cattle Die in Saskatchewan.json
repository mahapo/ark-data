Onewas found on the campus of Princeton University. This brings the total in NewJersey this year to 322 infected birds.Humans can only contract the virus from the bite of a mosquito that has fed onan infected bird. Last year, sixty-two people got sick and seven died in NewYork state. Recently in New York City, a woman was hospitalized in criticalcondition from complications stemming from West Nile Fever virus. Five moreNew York residents have been diagnosed with the virus this year and moreground spraying to kill mosquitoes is planned. Residents should call theircounty health department if they find dead birds.Last year when New York used helicopters and planes to spray heavily againstmosquitoes, 95% of the lobsters in the western part of Long Island Sound died.Now, Long Island lobster fishermen have announced that they are suing thepesticide makers and seeking $125 million in damages. Many fishermen havealready gone out of business or declared bankruptcy because there are nolobsters left to catch.Uranium Contamination in American Gulf War SoldiersIn other contamination news, today in Paris at a meeting of nuclear scientists,former head of nuclear medicine at the U.

Since the Depression Era, Canada has had such rentalagreements in which provincial government employees have had theresponsibility to water, feed and care for cattle pastured on government land.The same government employees have cared for cattle in the Meyronne,Saskatchewan pastures for the past several years. So everyone is shocked andpuzzled about why so many nursing mothers and their calves would suddenlyall die on the same day in the middle of August 2000.Today I talked with one of the farmers, Calvin Gavelin, about what he and hisfather saw on August 18th, the day they were notified their cows were dead.Interview:Calvin Gavelin, Rancher, Meyronne and McCord, Saskatchewan, Canada:\"When we arrived, they were doing an autopsy on one animal outside the gate.And when you looked - like it was just outside where our cows were. I think itwas a five or six strand fence, I think, an old sheep pasture. So, they were doingthis autopsy and at that point, they thought it was anthrax. It was at least apossibility because when you looked on the hills and all around, it was just deadanimals everywhere. Every position. Like they weren't just with their feet in theair. It was like some were dead sleeping. It was so unusual.So, that night authorities phoned us and said you had better go get yourvaccines, better get penicillin in case it was anything we were exposed to. Becautious.LIKE ANTHRAX.Yeah. So we went and got the penicillin and when we got home that night wehad a phone call that they figured we should go and treat the cows withpenicillin and do the same with the rest of the cows that were alive in case it wasanything that could be stopped.So, the next day it was pretty tough on us. It was really hot and smoky (fromforest fires) and we were there and as you worked the cattle, you could seewhich ones weren't coming back. Whereas the night before, there were certainones there that had more meaning to you and when we worked them the nextday, they weren't there, so.MEANING THAT MORE WERE DYING.No, just the best cows, the prime cows of that bunch we had up there, were thedead ones.THE PRIME ONES?Yeah. Like the heavy milkers, all your best cows up there. We had like sixdifferent age groups up there and there was no age discrepancy - like every age,like for our three year olds, we lost about over half of them. Of the 4 year oldsthe same. The 5 year olds. It wasn't just one group of age of cows.IS IT TRUE FROM THE REPORTS THAT THE COWS SEEMED TO BE"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"DEAD AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE FENCE?From what I seen, that's what I seen. At the gates and that.DOES THAT SUGGEST THAT THE ANIMALS WERE TRYING TOGET AWAY FROM SOMETHING?I think they were looking for something myself.MEANING?Water. Because the one gate area of the pasture was broken down and therewere no dead animals around that gate. And those cows broke through anothergate and went and got water like a mile and a half away where they had wateredthat spring.WHY WOULD THEY HAVE BEEN DESPERATE FOR WATER?Like I know they were there August 2nd when we moved them into the pen. Thewater was in the trough. Because there was only one water trough. It's off apipeline. The water was there then. And what we seen by the pictures when theywere taken that night of the 18th and 19th, there was water. But there was norecord of if there was water ever between those two dates.I DON'T FOLLOW.The first day, the trough had been filled in the spring. And if the tap was shutoff, those cows would not have had water for all those days. They would havebeen out of water.FROM THE VETERINARIAN EXAMINATION, DID THEY FIND THATTHERE WAS ANY EVIDENCE THAT THE ANIMALS HAD DIED OFLACK OF WATER?What we have heard on Friday night here on TV here, they said all the animalsthat died and the ones left alive show signs of dehydration. What we only get isfrom the media, from the interviews of the specialists looking into it.MEANING THEY ARE NOT TALKING TO YOU DIRECTLY ABOUTTHE DEATHS OF YOUR COWS?No, not yet.WHY?I don't know.BUT YOU KNOW THAT THE TROUGHS DID HAVE WATER IN THEMAT O N E P O IN T .Ye s .FROM YOUR POINT OF VIEW AS A RANCHER, WHY WOULD THEHYPOTHESIS OF NO WATER IN THE TROUGHS BE ACCEPTABLETO YOU?Just by what we see. The trough areas, that's where the cows usually water. Thatwasn't grazed down, not too much traffic there.WAS THERE WATER IN THESE TROUGHS WHEN YOU WENTTHERE?There was then. But it was stagnant water. It wasn't filled that day. That was the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"first time that pasture was used all year.HOW IS THE WATER DISTRIBUTED? HOW ARE THE TANKSFILLED WITH WATER? WHAT HAPPENS? IS IT A MECHANICALSYSTEM?It's a float off, it's a pressurized line with a float on the end of it.DID YOU KNOW IF IT WORKED?When we put them into the government pasture, we pay the government forriders and for a manager of the pasture to view our cattle twice a week and t olook at the water troughs and everything. So, like right now what we've heard inthe press is that water is there, was there at all times. But, what we see in thepictures of the zone where the cattle drink, there was no traffic in there.IF THERE HAD BEEN WATER SUPPLIED AS IT SHOULD HAVEBEEN BY THESE PEOPLE, HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THISMASSIVE DEATH?I don't know. Because they have ruled out toxic plants in the pasture, poisoning,any disease, the grass condition was good so there is not too much to go on.Lightning was ruled out. Natural things, everything else was ruled out.HAVE YOU EVER HAD ANYTHING LIKE THIS HAPPEN BEFORE INYOUR RANCHING EXPERIENCE?Never. I've never heard of it either.WHEN SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS TO THIS EXTENT, CANYOU RECOVER? WHAT HAPPENS?That's what we're hoping that we'll get compensated for it. I know right now it issuch a loss that the value of the farm has just dropped in one night. I know likefor ourselves, that was a quarter to a third of our herd that was lost. And UncleDanny, it was almost over a third.IF THE GOVERNMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR LACK OF WATERINGIN THIS ONE PASTURE WHILE ALL THE OTHER PASTURESSURROUNDING THIS PASTURE WERE FINE, HOW WOULD YOUEXPLAIN THAT?Probably just an error done on their sake because that's. It looks that way.DID YOU SEE THAT THE SAME PEOPLE FROM THEGOVERNMENT WHO WERE THERE TO WATCH OVER THEPASTURE WERE PEOPLE YOU RECOGNIZED FROM THEPREVIOUS YEAR OR SO?Yeah, they were there last year.NO PROBLEMS BEFORE?No problems before.THE MEN WHO HAD WORKED THERE BEFORE IN THE PREVIOUSYEARS WERE TELLING YOU WHEN YOU WENT BACK TRYINGTO COPE WITH ALL THESE DEAD ANIMALS THAT THEY KNEWFOR A FACT THAT THERE WAS WATER IN THE TROUGHS?That's what they were saying.ANY REASON FOR THEM TO NOT TELL THE TRUTH?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I don't know why. I know we were discussing this the other day when we weretalking with Uncle Danny and Norman. We were always raised that if you did anerror, admit up to it right now and don't create a bigger one. Because the truthwill always come out.LET'S SAY FOR A MOMENT, GIVING THEM THE BENEFIT OF THEDOUBT, THAT THEY ARE TELLING THE TRUTH AND THAT THEREWAS WATER. THEN YOU ARE LEFT WITH A REAL MYSTERYBECAUSE EVERY SINGLE THING HAS BEEN RULED OUT EXCEPTDEHYDRATION.Right, except dehydration and we were at a meeting on the 23rd of Augustcalled by some of the people like to inform us what the media has said. And oneguy that worked with the department said there will be an answer and heguaranteed it. And just by these investigators, the impression I got is that theanswer is there.BUT RIGHT NOW ON LABOR DAY WEEKEND OF SEPTEMBER2000, YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW FOR SURE WHAT HAPPENED TO79 ANIMALS?No, it's still out there.IT'S STILL A MYSTERY.It's still a mystery.\"Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
