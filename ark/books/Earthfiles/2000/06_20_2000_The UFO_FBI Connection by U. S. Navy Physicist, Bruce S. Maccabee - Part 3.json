D., Research Physicist at the Naval Surface Warfare Center(NSWC) in Dahlgren, Virginia begins with the clash between the FBI and USAFover UFO investigations. On May 1, 2000, his book The UFO/FBI Connection,was released detailing his research since 1976 into FBI documents andknowledge about the UFO mystery.Interview:Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist, Naval Surface WarfareCenter (NSWC), Dahlgren, Virginia:FBI and USAF Clash Over UFO Investigations\"IT MAY BE THAT THOSE MEN DOING THOSE REAL X-FILESINVESTIGATIONS FOR THE FBI WERE THE ORIGINAL MEN INBLACK?I suppose, but no one thought of them as Men In Black in those days. Theyintroduced themselves. They probably didn't wear black. I'm sure they woreordinary business suits. There aren't any stories of MIBs until the late 1950s.The FBI definitely went to talk to people and there are reports of theirinterviews in the FBI file, about two dozen. Then there was a bit of a scandalthat took place when an Air Force Colonel smuggled to one of the FBI agents adocument written by one of the Air Force Generals that said the FBI had beenbrought in to handle all the cases of ash can covers and toilet seats that might befound, indicating the FBI was to be given all the hoaxed trash cases and the AirForce would go after the good stuff.When this came to Hoover's attention, he said the FBI couldn't have its peopledoing that so stop investigating. If you get any information, immediately turn it"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"over to the Air Force. We're talking about late 1947 now and that did end theFBI involvement for about a year.From the fall of 1947 onward, the Air Force Intelligence investigatedsightings.There were two intelligence groups, as I make clear in my book. Therewas an Air Force intelligence group at the Pentagon and the technicalintelligence group at Wright-Patterson AFB which subsequently became AirTechnical Intelligence. That's where Project SIGN was headquartered. And thesetwo intelligence groups were certainly aware of each other, but they tended towork independently.Anybody who has studied the UFO subject in the past thirty years is probablyaware of General Twining's September 23, 1947 letter recommending that aspecial project be set up. It's his letter that starts off saying, 'It's our opinion(ATIC) that these saucers are something real and not visionary\" and they havecertain characteristics. It also says there is no hard evidence. That was written toa General George Schulgen at the Pentagon. The Pentagon Air ForceIntelligence people had their own study going on and arrived at the sameconclusion: that there really was something going on that was worthy of study.So, it was a combination of the letter from Twining which represented theopinion of the Air Technical Intelligence guys and the group at the Pentagon.Those two reports were added together and caused General Craigie to set up hisresearch in Project SIGN. And that's how the U. S. Air Force got into ProjectSIGN and we're all familiar with the history that comes out of Ruppelt that inthe summer of 1948 with the Chiles-Whitted encounter being the straw thatbroke the proverbial camel's back.\"Howe's Note: One of the most dramatic 1948 events was in Montgomery,Alabama on July 24th when Captain Clarence Chiles and John Whitted wereflying an Eastern Airlines DC-3 at about 2:45 AM and saw a large red lightheaded toward them. As the aircraft veered to avoid collision, the UFO seemedto react intelligently and passed to the right of the DC-3 and pulled up with aburst of flame and disappeared upward into the clouds. The pilots said theobject was shaped like a cigar, about 100 feet long and 30 feet in diameter. Themen could see a pointed protrusion resembling a radar antenna on the nose ofthe cigar-shaped UFO. The pilots also described two rows of rectangularwindows that glowed a bright white like burning magnesium. The bottom of theobject glowed a phosphorescent blue. An orange-red flame extended about fiftyfeet from the rear. That same night, a cigar-shaped object with flames comingfrom the rear was also reported by another pilot and observers at Robbins AirForce Base in Georgia.GENERAL HOYT S. VANDENBERG EXCLUDESANY POSSIBLE 'INTERPLANETARY' EXPLANATION\"The people at the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) wrote a documentcalled \"The Estimate of the Situation\" where they estimated that this wasinterplanetary and that some time in early October that made it up to the USAF'sChief of Staff General Hoyt S. Vandenberg and he shot it down.In my book, I make it clear that that was a watershed event in the history of thesubject. Why did that General shoot it down, I can't say. I can only make someguesses. But in effect, these people at the Air Technical Intelligence Center werethe experts in aeronautics back engineering aircraft of other countries, primarilythe Soviet Union. Also, they were doing their own research. And it is interestingto note, by the way, that a guy by the name of Alfred Loedding who was one ofthe people at Project SIGN was building pancake or pumpkin seed airfoil shapesand testing them. He was already into the disk-shaped aircraft mode and whenflying saucer sightings started, you can imagine - I can't prove it - but you canimagine he probably said, 'Wow, somebody has already done it!' Taken hisdesign and flown it."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"That justifies his being avidly interested in the flying saucer phenomenon rightfrom the beginning which he apparently was. He was one of the first people tobe involved in this Project SIGN that branched out into Project GRUDGE,Project BLUE BOOK and so on.We're learning more about what happened years ago then they knew years ago.And this book could not have been written twenty years ago or ten years agobecause it involves information that has only been recently released.Anyway, Project SIGN in 1948 concluded the aerial objects were interplanetary.This was a conclusion by the experts in the subject based on all the informationthey could get hold of. And General Vandenberg essentially told them, 'Sorry,wrong answer.'When you use all your best logic and arrive at an answer and somebody elsetells you with the authority to make it stick, 'That's the wrong answer.' Thenwhat do you do?For one thing, it could be a morale buster. But, that meant Vandenberg hadremoved 'interplanetary' from the list of allowed potential explanations for UFOsightings.IT WAS POLITICALLY UNACCEPTABLE.Why he did it, we can only guess. I point out in the book that the Roswell casehad happened by that time and if there really was a Roswell case (ofextraterrestrial crash and retrieval), he might want to keep the people fromknowing. He did NOT want to establish a policy that interplanetary was anallowable explanation. Or you might say, he wanted to establish a policy thatinterplanetary was not allowed.AFTER THAT IT SET THE TONE FOR THE U. S. GOVERNMENT'SDENIAL.That's right. Up to that point, there were the following possible explanations:hoaxes, delusions and misidentifications covered most of the stuff.Misidentifications of normal or natural phenomena or man-made phenomenasuch as misidentified stars, airplanes, balloons or whatever.Our secret project, which was definitely in the mix back in those days, \"theirsecret projects, what were the Soviets doing was the really scary part, andsomething that was totally out of this world. So you had six possibleexplanations: hoax, delusion, misidentification, ours, theirs, or from way out.And Vandenberg removed the way out possible explanation.Now, when you read my book you will see how the U. S. Air Force wentthrough gyrations and contortions to try to argue: 'Well, it was Soviet, but wedon't believe it was Soviet really because we don't think they had a big enoughjump ahead of us.'There is a document in the FBI files which specifically states the search of allthe research projects by the Air Force failed to turn up any project that wouldcause flying saucer sightings. And, by the way, people over and over have askedme, 'Couldn't this be our own secret project?' And I can refer them back again tothe August 1947 document from General George Schulgen in which he said, 'Wehave thoroughly investigated our own research. There is nothing there that couldcause flying saucer sightings.' And this was a document written TO the FBI's J.Edgar Hoover. Hoover did not want to have his agents investigating our ownsecret projects which would make no sense.So, there is a document from Schulgen that rules out our secret projects. Andyet, you find over and over again in the Air Force documents, 'Gee, could this be"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"something that we don't know about?'But the Air Force tied themselves into contortions trying to decide whether itwas ours, or theirs and finally they ultimately, by 1951 or 1952, had said thatit's not ours and it's not theirs. That meant it had to be a hoax, a delusion or amisidentification. Those were the classifications of all sightings that ProjectBLUE BOOK used all the way up to 1969. They did have unidentified sightings,but they always said, 'Well, these are unidentified, but if we had had moreinformation we could have identified them.'\"BECAUSE THE 1947 STATEMENT BY GENERAL VANDENBERGSAYING, 'NO, IT CANNOT BE INTERPLANETARY,' WAS STILL INEFFECT.Yes. By tradition. We've known about that ever since Ruppelt's book. But it's notuntil you put the whole history together in the way I have here that you see justhow important that is. Because what you see are the contortions of the U. S. AirForce people trying to explain sightings when interplanetary is removed from theavailable list of candidate explanations.THAT THEY WILL GET IN TROUBLE AND THEIR JOBS COULD BEIN JEOPARDY IF THEY EVEN TRIED TO INTRODUCE THE IDEA.Well, that may be. Certainly, Ruppelt said that. Ruppelt said that anyone whoproposed anything other than a conventional type of explanation - well, therewere NO feathers in the caps for 'unexplained sightings.'And we know that Project GRUDGE, and that's something else I put in thebook. The Project SIGN report was publicly released in April of 1949. And ifyou go back and get the Project SIGN report, which I presume is on the web,you will see that it does leave open the possibility that some things have notbeen explained. They say at the end that there are some cases that have not beenexplained and 'it's our job to put the dot the i's and cross the t's on all thesesightings that we've studied.' They had studied about 180 to 200 by that time.So, Project SIGN left open the possibility that there was something unexplained.And you'll remember that in December 1949 was Keyhoe's article in TRUEMagazine, 'Flying Saucers Are Real.' And a few days after that came out, the AirForce publicized the results of their Project GRUDGE which was the follow onto Project SIGN. And it turns out that in the latter part of 1949, the people atAir Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC) had exerted all possible force toexplain every sighting. So, GRUDGE claimed at the very beginning of the reportthat all sightings had been explained. And then you could go to the Appendix ofthe report and could see in particular that they concentrated on 57 sightings thathad not been explained to that point.And sure enough, every one of them had an explanation! And Ruppelt pointsout in his book that one of the most egregious examples of a typical explanationwas where a pilot had been chasing a light at night and people on the groundhad seen it moving along and he had chased it for some number of miles in astraight line, couldn't possibly be a balloon. But nevertheless, in the GRUDGEReport, it is identified as a balloon. You can get the GRUDGE Report from theFund for UFO Research, the whole thing.HOW DID THE CIA PLAY ITS ROLE IN RELATIONSHIP TO THE FBIAND THE AIR FORCE FROM ITS CREATION IN 1947 ON?We have a couple of documents that are in 1948 or 1949. The CIA file wasreleased in December 1978 only a year and a half after the FBI file. And the oneor two documents in the CIA file in 1949 indicate there was only minimalinterest in what was going on. They assumed the Air Force was handling theproblem as the Air Force claimed in public to have all the explanations. CIA"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"agents could read the same newspapers as everybody else. The Air Force wassaying there was nothing to this, there was no threat to the United States and allthe cases can be explained by natural phenomena.The CIA didn't get deeply involved in the subject until 1952 during the big flapover Washington, D.
