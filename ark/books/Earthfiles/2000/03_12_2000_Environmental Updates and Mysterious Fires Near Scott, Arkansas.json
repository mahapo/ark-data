Before then and since, it has been unusually warm. Andyesterday on March 11th, big, booming thunderstorms with lightning and heavyrain roiled around here most of the day through last night.Now - scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration havemade it official: the winter of 1999 to 2000 has been the warmest on recordsince the U. S. government began keeping weather statistics 105 years ago.This winter has also been one of the driest on record. The only areas with muchmoisture were the northern and central Rocky Mountains and the Central Plainseastward to the Ohio Valley. Everywhere else is drier than normal.Most atmospheric scientists today attribute the trend of higher temperatures toglobal warming brought on by civilization's putting huge amounts of carbondioxide into the atmosphere. Others still argue these are natural cycles of theearth, including the Pacific Ocean oscillations from La Ninas to El Ninos. Forthe past two years, La Nina has been in control of North American climate.But La Ninas and El Ninos would not explain the spreading of infectiousdiseases and new territories for viruses such as Kunjin West Nile Fever thatoriginated in Africa and the Middle East and made its debut in the United Stateslast fall. New York City's sprayed the pesticide Malathion to eliminatemosquitoes carrying the virus that killed seven people in the Manhattan area andput dozens more in hospitals. Traces of the virus that can cause brain swellingand flu-like symptoms has now been found in mosquitoes wintering in buildings,storm sewers and sewage treatment plants in the Fort Totten area in northeasternQueens.West Nile Fever Virus in Queens, New York MosquitoesThe warm winter probably helped the infected mosquitoes to survive. New YorkCity Health Commissioner Dr. Neal Cohen said New York will eliminatemosquito breeding areas and spray larvicides, particularly in the Borough ofQueens. He also has asked the public to help by cleaning clogged roof gutters,emptying unused swimming pools, changing bird bath water and discarding oldtires or anything outside that can hold water where mosquitoes thrive.The West Nile Virus is carried in the blood of birds and transmitted from birds tohumans by mosquitoes that bite and suck blood. So far, the virus has killedhundreds of crows from Connecticut to New Jersey and Pennsylvania andinfected several horses and domestic animals.Lobstermen in Connecticut and New York suspect that the Malathion spraying"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"last fall contributed to the huge die off of the lobster population in Long IslandSound and are appealing to New York politicians to stop pesticide spraying overthe Sound waters. Exactly how serious the spread of West Nile Fever virus mightbe in 2000 and whether New York City will have to spray as heavily again to killmosquitoes is still unclear.Mysterious Fires Near Scott, ArkansasMarch 12, 2000 Scott, Arkansas - The mystery of unexplained fires near thesmall rural towns of Scott and England near the three county borders of Pulaski,Lonoke and Jefferson Counties about 20 miles southeast of Little Rock,Arkansas. A mushroom cloud was first reported to the Little Rock Airport after11 PM on Thursday evening, March 9th. Concerned there might be a planecrash, the airport called the Scott Volunteer Fire Department and the PulaskiCounty Sheriff's Office. I talked with Sheriff Spokesman, John Rehrouer onFriday evening, March 10th.Interview:John Rehrouer, Public Information Officer, Pulaski County Sheriff'sOffice, Little Rock Arkansas: \"We got a call from the Scott Volunteer FireDepartment that they had received a phone call from the Little Rock Airportindicating that someone had called them and told them that they had seen eithera plane crash or a large explosion in the Scott area off Highway 161.Did they have the impression it was in the air?No, they really didn't. They thought maybe a plane had hit the ground. Wedispatched units out there, and an adjoining county, Loanoke Countydispatched units out there. They located an area maybe as big as a mile longwhere there were a multitude of small fires burning in a wooded area. We calledin a helicopter from the Little Rock Police Department and they flew over thearea and surveyed it trying to see if there was any wreckage from a plane. Theydid not find anything and just reported seeing a multitude of small fires in apretty wide ranging area. We had some reports in fact, I saw myself earlier in theevening what looked like shooting stars very bright shooting stars. But that was agood two hours, maybe three hours, before anything like this was reported.Can you describe more details about what you saw in the sky?Just a very, very bright light and it almost looked like fireworks, but not in anupward trajectory, only coming down. A pretty good flash and then a tailheading towards the ground.What was the color?Really, I don't remember. I think it happened so fast it looked kind of orangish.Was there only this one that you saw?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"That's all I saw.Were other people seeing the same kind of thing?We had a report from a couple of deputies a little further north in the countythan I was. In fact, I talked with one of them today. He said about the same time,he also saw it.CBS today was reporting a tree had been burned completely to ash, butnearby were dry leaves that were not scorched at all. A reporter said itreminded him of spontaneous combustion cases.I will tell you that I did hear the helicopter pilot comment that he saw they gotlow enough to notice that several trees had been burned. He described it asalmost half way through and his reaction was that maybe this fire had beenburning for some time. There seemed to be honestly a fair amount of confusionis probably not the right word but mystery about what is this? It was very hardto describe and you can tell there was a lot of hesitation in peoples' voices aboutwhat was going on here.\"No Meteor Showers or Space DebrisAstronomers said there was not any known meteor shower March 9th andNORAD said it was not a satellite or space debris. No craters nor debris werefound either. So, at first, the sheriff's office thought the explanation might be theexplosion of a liquid fertilizer pipeline in the Scott area. But no damage wasfound on the pipeline.Next, law enforcement turned the case over to the Pulaski County Office ofEmergency Services. The Director, Kathy Botsford, went to the site aftermidnite. The fires were still burning in an area one to two miles long by 150 feetwide. Little Rock local CBS reporter, Bobby Sisk, was there with hiscameraman and told me what he saw.Bobby Sisk, Reporter, KTHV (CBS-TV), Little Rock, Arkansas: \"We gotout there probably around midnight, a little after midnight, my photographerand I. We were going down the road it's out in the middle of nowhere in farmland where the closest house is probably within a mile, but it's still out wherethere aren't residents right around there, driving down through there. It was verydark. And all of the fire crews that had been there as well as state police wereleaving at that point. However, we get down there, there is still fire burning andit just looks so bizarre because it looks to be about a mile stretch burning someon one end, burning some in the middle and up in the trees and then down onthe one end and then down to what looked like a warmer spot near the end.So, while everyone else left the other news crews came and left and thought itwas nothing and my photographer and I stayed around just because we didn'tfeel comfortable with leaving. We thought something was still there. And at thatpoint, a lady from the Pulaski County Office of Emergency Services I don't knowif you have spoken with her, Cathy Botsford?She was referenced to me. She just wasn't there tonight.OK, Cathy Botsford came out there and she was very, she wanted to check it outand make sure because the first dispatch said it was a possible plane down. Andso to my knowledge, they have absolutely no idea what it was.Did you follow her around?We followed her around for a little while last night. What she found was areas alot of underbrush next to a field. She found areas that had been burned outunderneath and then she found what looked like the tops of trees were like"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"knocked down. But then in some places she determined that the tree had justburned so much that maybe it possibly had fallen over. It was just very bizarre. Ihad the most unsettling feeling, I can tell you personally, out there last nightthat I've had on anything I've been on. Just very, very bizarre.\"More Information:Firemen at the scene described the flames as unusually sparkly which suggestedsome kind of incendiary chemical. So, samples from burned brush and treeswere supposed to have been collected by fire officials for lab analyses. Also, onMonday, March 13, 2000, the Arkansas Forest Commission's Fire Marshall'sOffice is officially taking over the case and more plant, soil and ash samples willbe collected. No one yet knows what caused all the strange fires that weresprinkled over a mile near Scott, Arkansas before midnight, March 9th.To report any more information about this report, or other unusual phenomenain your area, please e-mail me at earthfiles@earthfiles.comWe b s it e s :http://www.adem.state.ar.us./Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
