Body Print and HairsDiscovered in Washington State© 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe Gifford Pinchot National Forest west of Yakima, Washington is location of unidentifiedand possible Bigfoot body print and hairs discovered in mud on September 22, 2000.October 8, 2000 Tahuya, Washington - Bigfoot tracker, landscape contractorand Tahuya resident, Derek Randles, has a large plaster cast of what might bethe first partial body print of a Bigfoot ever found. In September, he helped theBigfoot Field Researchers Organization (BFRO) plan an expedition of fourteenpeople into the Gifford Pinchot wilderness west of Yakima, Washington. Theirgoal was to find Bigfoot tracks, hairs and screams for an Australian camera crewproducing a segment for the Discovery Channel program Animal X . The groupset up a sound projection system to loudly broadcast a Bigfoot scream recordedrecently at Lake Tahoe, California. On September 21st, after one of thebroadcasts of three Bigfoot screams, the researchers were shocked to hear anearly identical series of three screams answer back.Around 3:30 AM on September 22, Derek Randles and some of his colleagueswent in the direction of the screams and placed fruit in the middle of a watery,muddy wallow in hopes that whatever was producing the eerie answers might betempted to eat the fruit and leave tracks in the mud. After sunrise, the menfound more than footprints.Interview:Derek Randles, Bigfoot tracker since 1985 and member, Bigfoot FieldResearchers Organization (BFRO), Tahuya, Washington: \"That evening weset up a sound projection system and started projecting sounds, basicallyscreams, recorded Sasquatch screams through the mountains there near camp.The scream we were projecting was recorded up near Lake Tahoe not too long"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"ago. It was felt to be one of the better Sasquatch screams that you can get. Andwe were projecting the sounds through the mountains and on the second evening(September 20), we got an answer. It actually answered us back!WHAT WAS THE REACTION OF YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE ATTHAT POINT?It was pretty incredible. Nobody could talk for a moment because we were alltrying to make sure everyone heard it. But we all heard it, including the filmcrew and everyone there. And it was from about 1/4 mile to 1/3 mile up behindour base camp. We had two people up there during that second evening. And wewere answered from very close range. We figured approximately 350 feet fromthe two individuals up on the ridge. It scared them to death. We all heard italmost as loud as what we were projecting. And we were projecting a 150 wattamplifier through a huge bugle horn. This thing answered three times. And itwas almost identical to what we were projecting. It was very freaky. A littleweird.DID THE GUYS AT THE UPPER CAMP START RUNNING BACKDOWN?No, but they got very shaken. Very shaken, as a matter of fact.DID THE FILM CREW FROM AUSTRALIA GET THIS RECORDED?I'm sorry to say that no one got that night recorded. They were busy workingwith thermal imaging equipment and we were not recording which was a bigmistake on our part. But on the good side, on the third night of September 21,we also got a return vocalization and I did record it. It was the night theimpression was left in the mud.THE THIRD NIGHT YOU GET A RECORDING. AND HOW DID YOUCOME TO FIND THE IMPRESSION OF THE PRIMATE HUMANOIDTORSO IN THE MUD?What happened is that the third night on September 21, we heard it coming fromthe direction of where this muddy wallow was. And the wallow was a good 3/4of a mile away. So, later that evening, there were a few members of the BFROthat were placing fruit in different areas, a kind of offering.PUTTING FRUIT OUT TO SEE ...To see if something would walk in and leave tracks so we could get an idea ofhow many animals were there, if any animals were there. We already knew therewas something out there because of the return vocalizations. So at about 3:30AM September 22, I said we should put some fruit right in the middle of thewallow since it was right from where we heard the return vocalization. Myfriend, Leroy Fish, and I put some apples in the middle of the wallow - a muddyhole that's probably 15 feet across, a low spot so when it rains it gets full andthe animals seemed to congregate there. Then we returned back to camp. Wewere freezing to death and went to bed.We got up about 7:30 still on September 22 and went to check the wallowaccompanied by Richard Knowle who also left fruit out. We noticed that someof the apples were gone and some of the nectarines. And then all three of usnoticed at the same moment an impression where an animal had laid down. Itlooked like a giant human thigh. Actually, left buttock, thigh, knee area, lowerleg and four heel imprints.\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Researcher's hand on plaster cast next to one of four large heel prints found in mud wallow.Video frame courtesy of King TV, Channel 5 and King5.com, Seattle, Washington.Jeff Meldrum, Ph.D., Professor of Anthropology, Idaho State University,Pocatello, Idaho: \"Upon examining the cast, one can clearly see the hip orbuttock region. It appeared that it rolled back and forth as it reached to pick upthis fruit out of the water. Why it laid down, I can't say. The posture it adoptedupon laying down is a typical primate posture though of sort of hunkering downon one hip and leaning down on the adjacent elbow. We do it when we sit downin the grass sometimes.You can look at great apes in the zoo and picture books and see them adopting asimilar posture frequently. You can see the rump or buttock region andcontinuing on into the thigh. Hair striations are clearly visible there. Then to theside of that is the impression of a forearm from the elbow down to the wrist. Thehand is not very distinct and not very visible because of the disturbance of thesoil. There were elk and deer that had walked across this puddle and mudsubsequent to the impressions, so it wasn't a smooth pristine surface to beginwith, before and subsequent. There are clearly footprints over the top of theimpression, the body impression. In fact, there is a little trail of coyote footprintsthat walked right up across the back side of the impression and left their prints.YOU HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT TRACKS AND CASTS OF WHATSEEM TO BE A SASQUATCH FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME. WOULDYOU SAY THIS BODY IMPRESSION IS DEFINITELY PRIMATE ORHUMANOID?It's definitely humanoid in its shape and proportion. And the thing that reallypoints for me is that there are a series of heel impressions where one of the legs,the knee was apparently raised and the toes pointed up to the sky and the heelpushed in on several occasions, probably as it was reaching across to grab thatfruit. There were finger drag marks over near the fruit that suggest that's what itwas doing.The heel marks were extremely telling because the under surface of the heel andthe back part of the foot, sole of the foot, evidences dermataglyphics, the skinridge patterns that is characteristic of the palms and soles of primates. These arenot human ridge patterns. They are of a texture and a flow pattern that we haveseen on other Sasquatch prints which is quite distinctive from humans. But theyare not exactly like ape, either. They possess some characteristics of both. Bythat, I don't mean some hybrid or some missing link. I just simply mean thatbasically we have an ape pattern that superficially resembles a human in that thegreat toe is in line with the other toes. That alignment naturally affects the flowpattern of the ridges on the sole of the foot, and the composition of the sole ofthe foot. And this is sort of in between. It has characteristics of both.IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT IN OCTOBER 2000 THAT THIS APPEARSTO BE A FRESH BODY PRINT OF A CREATURE THAT IN ONE OFTHE PRESS RELEASES SAID THAT THE RESEARCHERS ISBELIEVED TO BE 7 TO 8 FEET TALL, WEIGHING 800 TO 1000"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"POUNDS AND THEY BELIEVE THERE MIGHT BE HUNDREDS LIKETHIS THROUGHOUT FORESTS IN THE NORTHWEST.That's correct. In fact, since that interview, that press release, we did some morecareful measurements and we completed the cleaning, we were able to make amore accurate measure of both the forearm from the elbow to the wrist and fromthe gluteal fold at the top of the thigh down to the outside of the knee and thatwould be a minimum measure and they are about 40 to 50% larger than thesame measures on a 6 foot man.So, we're talking at least like 7 or more like 8 to 9 feet in height. This wasprobably a very large male individual based on the size and extrapolating fromprevious reports and eyewitness accounts. And the footprints that were found,where the entire length of the foot was present, measured between 16 and 17inches. That would correlate very well with the dimensions exhibited by thisbody print.WHY WOULDN'T THE GENERAL SCIENCES OF ZOOLOGY,BIOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY ACCEPT EVIDENCE LIKE THISAS ABSOLUTELY HARD EVIDENCE THAT SOMETHINGUNIDENTIFIED IS OUT THERE?It's difficult to say exactly why. I think there is a combination of reasons.Obviously, zoology typically requires for the description of a new species a typespecimen. And that tends to be constituted by a skull or entire body or skin, butsome significant tangible piece of the animal. The only precedent we have fordescribing new species on the basis of trace evidence is that there is a practice inpaleontology of describing what is called an ichno species which isn't really anew species, but it is a particular footprint pattern that is seen but for which noknown fossil species can account for and so basically, the paleontologistsdescribe the footprint in the absence of the bones of an extinct species until suchtime some species can be correlated or connected to that particular footprint.HERE YOU HAVE SOMETHING THAT APPEARS TO BE ALIVELEAVING FOOTPRINTS OF SOMETHING THAT IS MYSTERIOUSBUT YOU'RE SAYING THERE IS NO CATEGORY FOR SCIENCE TOPUT THIS PARTICULAR COMBINATION OF SOMETHING ALIVEWITH FOOTPRINTS AND NO BODY TO GO WITH IT?Exactly. So that's the quandary we're in at the moment. Some scientists arebasically awaiting the body to make a final judgment. There are others that areincredulous because of the outrageous notion, in their minds, that such a hugeanimal could have existed in such a habitat in the back yard of the mostsophisticated, scientifically, country in the world, if I may.THE UNITED STATES.That is a difficult pill to swallow. There is no question about that. But that Ihope the philosophy of their discipline should not preclude at least theentertainment of a hypothesis to be tested. That's what I'm about. Trying toaccept that as a hypothesis from which we can embark on a serious andsystematic evaluation of the evidence. And let the evidence speak for itself.The difficulty that I encounter is when someone says, 'Bigfoot couldn't existbecause my preconception of apes' ecology and behavior won't accommodatesuch an animal living in a temperate forest in the western United States.'Well, that begs the question: What one does with this evidence that exists?These footprints exist. Hair samples exist. And so on. That has to be dealt withon its own merits first. And then the questions: What is its ecology? How does itsurvive in the winters? Why do we never find bodies or remains of these animalswhen they expire? Then those will have to be taken in turn and they arelegitimate questions."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"WHAT ABOUT THE HAIR ON THIS MOST RECENT FIND? HAVEYOU HAD HAIR ANALYSES AND HAS IT BEEN UNUSUAL?We sat down, myself and two other researchers that were there, we examined thecast and sorted through all the hairs collected, both at the scene and quite anumber more picked up off the surface of the cast. A number of those turned outto be plant fibers upon close examination, which is easy. People want to becareful and collect absolutely everything that even resembles a hair. We sortedout those and the remaining hairs, and we were quite certain there was a broadsampling of the fauna that made it to that region. Clearly, the footprintsindicated that animals were in that area. Those were taken on Tuesday (October3, 2000) to Dr. Henner Fahrenbach who is affiliated with the Oregon RegionalPrimate Research Center. He was able to immediately differentiate bothungulates and carnivores. That accounted potentially for the bear and coyoteand the ungulate for the deer and the elk. Also among the samples were someprimate hair.So, his next step in the wake of that is to take that 'primate' hair and compare itto the samples we have collected from numerous other sites independently all ofwhich show similarities to humans and other primates, but have a distinctivesuite of characteristics that seem to characterize them uniquely from otherprimates and animals.IT'S HAIR THAT DOESN'T QUITE MATCH PRIMATES SUCH ASGORILLA OR PRIMATES SUCH AS HUMANS?Right. It has the greatest similarity to human hair. And at first glance, one caneasily mistake it for a human hair. But there are subtle differences in thediameter of the shaft structure, the architecture and the cuticle structure thatdistinguish it. On last count, Dr. Fahrenbach has a dozen hair specimens thathave been collected from a variety of different sources throughout the northwestthat all show this same distinctive suite of characteristics. So, it says there aresome animals whose hair cannot be readily attributed to any other knownanimal, but which have consistently showed these same characteristics.\"Derek Randles:\"WHAT PROVOKED YOU TO WANT TO RESEARCH BIGFOOT INTHE FIRST PLACE?In 1985, two friends and I were up backpacking in a national park along theSnohomish River. We decided we were going to cross country, so we left thetrail and started hiking up what is called Six Ridge. We got to the top of theridge and we got our backpacks off and started laying our stuff up and gettingour tents out and all of a sudden, we heard a loud cracking noise. We all lookedup in the direction. We were not near a cliff or a shelf. And all of a sudden, wesaw a rock flying at us. And it landed about 10 feet to the left of us. It wassomewhere between a grapefruit and a volleyball size. And then another one.And then another one. Someone was throwing rocks at us and they were landingten to fifteen to twenty feet to the left of us. And they were fairly consistent insize. They weren't huge, but they weren't small. I've built rock walls for a living.I know how far I can throw a rock. And there's no way I could throw these rocksas far. Not even close.Then they started coming to the right of us as if they were trying not to hit us,but trying to get us out of there. So, it worked. We grabbed all our stuff up anddidn't even take the time to put our backpacks on and flew down the side of theridge as fast as we could.WHY WOULD YOU ASSOCIATE THAT WITH SASQUATCH?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"We didn't at the time. We didn't know what was going on. I didn't know if it wasViet Nam veterans who had left society and had a catapult. We really didn'tknow. It was just so weird and so bizarre, we had to leave. These rocks werecoming at us from at least 50 or 60 feet and landing 10 to 15 feet to the left ofus and then to the right. If they had wanted to, they could have taken us out.Just the weirdness of the whole situation. We were not where we were supposedto be. You would have to have been there to understand, but it was almost dark.Here we were almost 9 miles up in virgin wilderness and we're getting big rocksthrown at us. So, we had to get out of there and we rolled and tumbled downthe ridge onto the trail almost right at dark. And we started running fast to thecamp we had passed at the 9 mile mark called Camp Pleasant on the SnohomishRiver Trail. And as we came running into Camp Pleasant, three other hikerswere coming up from down below and met us at the exact same time. We startedtrying to tell them what was going on and we heard more noise in the woods.This thing had apparently paced us and more smaller rocks kept falling aroundcamp that night as everybody, including the three new hikers - now there weresix of us - were sitting around the campfire. A couple of girls were there. Theywere crying. It was very scary. The next morning we went down that weekendand made a report to the ranger station and he just kind of looked at us strange.Then a couple of weeks later, I was hiking back up there with my first wife andthat's when I found my first Sasquatch tracks coming off the ridge where therocks were thrown at us. They were there as plain as day. There was snow, andours tracks were the only snowshoe tracks. Nobody else was up there.YOU HAVE TO HAVE SYMPATHY FOR THESE CREATURES THATTHEY WOULD THROW ROCKS AT SOMETHING THAT THEY DOCONSIDER TO BE AN INTRUDER AND HUMANS HAVEDESTROYED A LOT OF THINGS IN THE ENVIRONMENT. THEREMIGHT BE GOOD REASON FROM A SASQUATCH POINT OF VIEWABOUT WHY THEY WOULD THROW ROCKS.I think it speaks to their intelligence and behavior. I think these things are a lotmore intelligent than we give them credit for. When the rocks were thrown at mein the Olympics, they were not thrown at us. They were thrown around us. Thatwas apparent because the rocks that were coming were thrown accurately.Plus their stealth. I think they are very, very intelligent creatures.WILL THE WORLD ACCEPT THE FACT THEY EXIST WITHOUTWANTING ONE IN A CAGE OR DEAD?I think that if the general public was taught or explained the evidence that is outthere, the general world would accept it before the scientific community. A lotof scientists aren't even willing to look at the subject because as far as theyknow, it doesn't exist so why study it.SOMETHING OUT THERE HAS HAIR SOMEWHERE BETWEENHUMAN AND PRIMATE, BUT IS NEITHER.Right. That fact alone is compelling enough as far as I'm concerned, along withthe work that's been done on the dermal ridging. The dermal ridging is notsomething you can readily fake. If you have a good dermal ridge expert, he cantell you almost instantly if it's a manufactured track or a living animal. Thesetwo facts alone: the hair and dermal ridging are compelling.\"More Information:More photographs and hair analyses will be released in the future after morescientific investigations have been completed."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"We b s it e s :http://www.king5.com/http://www.bfro.net/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
