DanHeaton, his wife Lorraine and their 30-year-old daughter, Kim, were drivinghome at 10:20 PM when Mr. Heaton first noticed a diamond or square patternof lights coming so low that he pulled the car over and asked his wife anddaughter to get out and watch with him. Dan has worked for the same insurancecompany for twenty-nine years and had U. S. Air Force training when he wasyounger. He told me, \"I know planes and I generally know what we have, butmy family and I had never seen anything like this before.\"Interview:Dan Heaton, Insurance Salesman, Phoenix, Arizona: \"It was approximately10:20 PM, Monday evening the 28th of June, 1999. I was about a mile from ourhome with my wife, Lorraine, and daughter, Kim. Kim was 30 years old at thetime. We had turned off of a main artery in Phoenix called Shea Blvd. goingnorth on 54th Street. About a mile from our home, I noticed a light in the skythat looked like landing lights for an airplane. The Scottsdale Airpark is about 4miles northeast of where we were and it's not uncommon for planes to come inlow and make a bank and then go in for the approach to land at the airport. ButI was watching these lights because it seemed like they were going off veryslowly. And then finally, as they approached the car I would say anywhere from800 to 1000 feet altitude, I noticed there were four bright lights in a diamondpattern. And so I pulled off to the side of the road in a residential area, very nicearea, and I asked my daughter to get out of the car and take a look at thisbecause I knew it was going to go out of sight fairly quickly. She has very goodeyesight and so does my wife. I see clearly, but I'm color blind.So, all three of us got out of the car and we looked right under this thing. Theway I would describe it is about the size of a large private jet, so probably 80 to120 feet across if you want to look at it as a square rather than a diamond. Andthere were these four bright lights, one on each corner. And as it was"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"approaching us and flying overhead, it was coming in the shape of a diamondgoing in a southeasterly direction. Then it made a turn without banking and itwent due east. And as it was leaving us, it was going away from us in a squarepattern.What was the color of the light at the four corners?Chartreuse green. And I say that because my wife and daughter told me that.Like I said, I'm color blind, so to me they looked like the headlights on an oldcar or truck. They were round and to me, they looked like a white light. ButLorraine and Kim told me they were chartreuse.Drawing of green square aerial object over PhoenixJune 28, 1999 © 2000 by Lorraine Heaton.Drawing of green square aerial object seen over Phoenix, Arizonaon June 28, 1999 © 2000 by 30-year-old Kim HeatonWas there any pulsing or flickering to the lights?None whatsoever. There were no running lights. There was no red or green orblue light flashing on the vehicle. And the thing that got me more than anythingwas that there was absolutely no sound. At one time, I was thinking this must bea glider or something. But there was nothing towing this thing. And we watchedit. We more or less followed it for probably six or seven miles before itdisappeared over some mountains east and a little north of where we weresitting. So, we watched it gradually climb in altitude and finally disappear overthe top of the mountains.What about some of the explanations these days that our government isfloating around dirigibles in the shapes of triangles or squares or othershapes, perhaps for psychological tests of public reaction. How do youknow what you and your son saw was not a dirigible?Well, it could have been. But again, there was no sound. And dirigibles havesome method of power, engines of some type, whether it's a jet engine or propengine of some type. So they still make noise. But this was not a dirigible or"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"blimp or anything like that that I've ever seen before.It had the ability to climb in altitude?Yes, it climbed. When it was over the top of us, it was - I would guess - not morethan a thousand feet in altitude over us. These planes that come in and land,they fly over our house. You can see the details of the planes. You can see thelanding gear and landing lights and you can make out the planes very clearlywhen they fly over the house, even at night when their lights are on. It's prettyeasy to tell what type of plane it is, even.This thing was even lower than the typical airplane. I think maybe that was whatcaught my eye more than anything was the fact that it was coming in so low tomake the turn. Then I noticed the four lights. It would be like having an aircraftwith a large nose landing light and then light one each tip of the wing and thenone on the tail. But as it flew over, we looked right up in the bottom of thisthing and we could see that it was kind of a concave underneath. It wasn't flat. Itwasn't bellied, but it was slightly concave and there were faint lines that weregoing from the corners to the center. Other than that, there were no landing gearor flaps or anything that you could make out on it. It was a clear night. Therewas a full moon. It was probably one of the nicest nights we've had.Were there any other people around?No. It was about 10:20 PM and that evening I called a couple of TV stations anda radio station to see if they had had any reports. The next day I called the towerat the Scottsdale Airport and they told me they closed the tower to all aircraft at9 PM that night. When I called Sky Harbor in downtown Phoenix, they saidanything that low would have been out of their radar beam because ofmountains just to the north, between Phoenix and Scottsdale. They wouldn'thave picked up anything that low anyway, they said. But they did not have anycalls either about anything abnormal that night.As far as I know, we're the only three people in town that saw this thing! Whichis amazing to me.Yes, and you were in the U. S. Air Force at one point?Right. And I've never seen anything like it before.Is there anything about this object that strikes you as falling into thecategory of anything that could be terrestrial?Well, it could be. But I just don't know of anything we have or any othercountry as far as that goes that is quiet. This thing - there was no sound at all. Itactually kind of spooked me because as I was watching the thing go away, Irealized that we don't have anything like this that I know of. It could have beenfrom some place other than here, unless the government has some new aircraftthat they are working on that is using some propulsion that none of us have evendreamed of.Otherwise it might be that you saw something that was not terrestrial?Right.How close do you think it came at the closest to you?Probably somewhere between 800 and 1000 feet, at the most. On the outside.I've talked to a number of pilots that have flown in and out of Scottsdale andthey say the approach at that point should be about 1500 feet. But I know thatsome of the planes that come in daily are flying lower than 1500 feet going overthe top of my house. The house is not quite a mile north of the point where wesaw this thing."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"How far was this from the main Phoenix airport?About sixteen miles north of the airport, Sky Harbor International Airport.So the direction it took off was which direction?This thing came from the northwest going southeast and as it approached to thepoint where we were approximately 150 to 200 yards north of Shea Blvd. whichis a main artery going east and west in north Phoenix and Scottsdale then itproceeded due east for half a mile, and then it appeared to start going southeastagain, and then it started going a little northeast and it started making a zigzagmotion back and forth just north of Shea Blvd. Now, it may have crossed overShea going south a couple of times. It was so close to Shea Blvd. This is why itsurprised me that nobody else saw this. Or maybe just didn't pay any attention toit. They may have thought it was a helicopter, or an aircraft, just a private plane,not really paying any attention to it. But what caught my eye was that it was solow and number two, that diamond pattern. And that's what made me stop thevehicle in the first place. Otherwise, I would have just kept driving. But Ithought, 'God, this thing is awfully low!' And then when I saw the four lights, Ithought 'This is irregular. That's not a normal pattern for running lights.'What was southeast in the direction that it went anything of a militarynature?No, not at all. If it had proceeded going southeast, it would have gone throughsome central and southern Scottsdale and into Tempe and Mesa which arecommunities southeast of where we are. But instead, we tried to follow it whichsounds almost crazy when you think this is an aircraft and it's going who knowswhere it's going. But my wife and daughter are not the type to get excited aboutany of these types of things and when I say that I mean, it could be as simple asa fire truck going to a house fire. They just say, 'Let's go home.' Now me, I like towatch the guys do their work. But they got back in the car and the first thingthey said was, 'Let's follow this thing.' So, they were excited because they knewthey were seeing something very special.We started going east about a half mile and we came to another main streetgoing north and south and my wife said, 'It's going southeast. Turn right.' I said,'No, the thing should start going back north again.' So I went up about half amile to another main street that runs parallel to Shea which is called CactusRoad and that's a mile north of Shea and I searched proceeding east downCactus. And the object was going back and forth. So then I started to go southagain on 64th Street to Shea and then it started going north again, so I cut acrosson another road to Scottsdale Road which is a main street going north andsouth, a main artery. Then, I proceeded north on Scottsdale Road back up toCactus and we just watched the thing disappear over the McDowell Mountains.And then it was gone.It's funny, it's going to sound weird. But since this has happened, almost everynight I go out about this time and just look in the sky. My wife says, 'You'renever going to see this thing again.' You know, it's a once in a lifetime thing. Thefunny thing about this is that two or three weeks ago, there was a police officer Isaw on television saw something similar to this.Theirs was arrowhead-shaped.OK. Then some other folks in Illinois saw something similar that same night.And there is a police officer here who saw something in October, saw greenlights. And northwest of Phoenix. I tried to talk to him a couple of times. I justwant to verify that I saw something. I know what I saw. But I want to know thereare other people out there who have seen the same thing.Your wife and daughter saw this with you."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Right. Right. And in fact, that night we were laying in bed and quietcontemplating what we had seen and she's over there giggling. And I said,'What's so funny?' She (Lorraine) said, 'I just never thought I would ever seeanything like that.' And then I knew that she felt she had seen somethingextraordinary. And I had her and my daughter draw on a piece of paper a pictureof what they saw. And I did the same thing. And they were all the same. All fourwere pretty much diamond shaped. But they were square depending on how youturned the paper. And with a light in each corner.Could you please tell me about your unusual experience in the Air Force?United States Air Force Photographs of Unidentified Silver SpheresOne of the missions in the squad room was to indoctrinate fighter interceptorpilots on what to look for and what to identify and how to remember what youare seeing when you see extraordinary objects and they did have slides of UFOsthat were taken. These were, as far as I know, Air Force photos taken of anobject in the Grand Canyon and one on the ground in New Mexico. Anothertwo or three I don't remember if there were three or four, but at least two photosof interceptors going after a UFO over Alaska. And all of these photos werepictures of UFOs that were silver balls.Balls?Balls. They were round. They weren't saucers. They weren't pancake shaped oroblong shaped. They were like silver spheres.What year would this have been?This would have been, when I was there, in 1963 and 1964. I was an Airman, anadministrative person.You saw the slides because?Well, the orientation they would give, this was part of our Squadron's duties, Iguess. We had several things we did. But one of the things they did that wedidn't know - very few people knew this even was going on. But they would goto different fighter interceptor bases around the country - Canada and Alaska -and then indoctrinate pilots in what to look for, what to remember, try to judgesize of the objects, approximate speed, what they looked like. They wanted themto take notes, not just mental notes, but to actually draw what they saw. Thatwas part of the instructions.If you weren't a pilot, why were you in the orientation class?I wasn't. I just had access to the slides. At the time, I had what is called acryptographic clearance, security clearance. So, I had access to these things. Afriend of mine said to me one day, 'Why don't you come in and take a look atthis.' And so, he showed me the slides. And then also the paper work that wentalong with it as far as what they were told to tell the pilots in their orientation.In other words, what they were trying to do was to teach the pilot what to lookfor and how to remember what they saw and things they wanted to know. Theywanted to know what these things look like, approximately how big are they,how fast you estimate they are traveling on the intercept. Because I guess someof these people when they see these things are just overwhelmed at what theywere looking at. They weren't thinking of the things the Air Force or thegovernment really needed to know. What were they seeing?Do you remember if any of the reports said the silver balls were considereda threat or not?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"No, never. There was nothing ever mentioned about that. It was only anobservation thing. If you see something like this - and that's why they had theslides - we want you to think of what the size is?, what's the shape of it?, anydistinguishing lights? or features? and speed?The objects were total spheres, not discs on end?Yes, they looked like silver balls. All of them. The one in Alaska and the GrandCanyon and the one in New Mexico.Did you have any geographic reference for size comparison of the spheresin the photos?It would be really hard. You could guess. Like the one in New Mexico it lookedlike it was sitting on the ground and it looked like it could be a quarter of a mileto a half mile away from the car. This photograph was taken from a car. Youcould see that. But it looked like it was sitting in like an onion field or cabbageor something. It was some kind of a farm or something. And the one in thebottom of the Grand Canyon was sitting right next to the river. I would guess itwas probably, it looked like it was the size of maybe 60 to 80 feet in diameter,something like that. It wasn't something you would miss.That's pretty good size. Something perfectly spherical has also beendescribed in Cambodia and other parts of the world. It's interesting thatmost of our history associates the 1940s and 1950s with the disc-likeobjects, not spheres.Right. The thing that irritates me and bothers me about that kind of thing is thatI know there are people out there that have seen these slides. There are probablyhundreds of former pilots who have seen this presentation. And why theyhaven't come forward, I don't know. They knew they were looking for somethingthat had already been seen. If I were a pilot and looking at something like theseslides in that type of presentation, I would be very interested, especially if I werestationed in those areas.Alaska, New Mexico...Grand Canyon, Arizona and Utah. Those are the ones I saw. Now there wereprobably, I'm guessing, about 50 slides in this presentation and I only looked atabout half a dozen of them.Why do you think since 1963 you would still have any nervousness orsensitivity in talking about this?Why haven't they told us officially? These things are out there. These slides areout there some place. They are not at Hill AFB anymore, but they do exist. Andwhy haven't they come out? Why hasn't Bill Clinton opened these files? Thatwas one of the things he promised us when he went into the presidency eightyears ago. If there was anything like that, he said he would release it.Did you sign any oaths?Oh, yeah. That we would not divulge any of the information because there wasmore sensitive stuff there I had access to. But this is something that reallybothers me because it's time for people to know that this stuff is out there. Thereis proof! That's what really bothers me. Why don't they just come forth and giveus the truth about it and show what they have?\"More Information:I would appreciate hearing from anyone who might have more information aboutthe green square aerial craft that the Dan Heaton family saw over Phoenix,"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Arizona on June 28, 1999.
