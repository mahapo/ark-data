C. Levengood, BiophysicistReturn to Part 1.October 16, 2000 Grass Lake, Michigan: W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist and Owner,Pinelandia Biophysical Laboratory, called me in early January 1997, to talk about hisexamination of black particles that rancher Jean Barton found on one of the severalmutilated cattle she and her husband, Bill, have discovered on various pastures of their RedBluff, California ranch. He read to me from his lab work book about the hard, darkparticles found on the chest and testicles of a mutilated bull at the Barton ranch.W. C. Levengood January 1997 lab work book:“The particles were non-magnetic. They were hard, resinous black particlesrather easily broken into fragments when crushed with forceps. The matrixcolor of these fragments was a deep red with a fine graine amorphousstructure. There were no cellular composites whatsoever. There was a slowdissolution in water. It was not highly soluble. In the early stages of hydration,two to three hours, an occasional cluster of blue colored tissue was found inisolated patches on the slide. After 24 hours, the slide had dehydrated andthere was an excellent example of uninterrupted mud crack-type patternsformed around the edge of the slide.”Dehydrated fragment from black particles found on chest hide of mutilated bulldiscovered in Red Bluff, California, January 17, 1997. This photomicrograph (450x)show s uninterrupted “mud crack”-type patterns and no indication of cellular structuressuch as erythrocytes and leukocytes.

In contrast to the homogeneouspure bovine hemoglobin, this normal blood sample is not homogeneousand has a different “mud crack”-type pattern. Photomicrograph© 2000 by W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist.Interview:W. C. Levengood, Biophysicist, Pinelandio Biophysical Laboratory, Grass Lake,Michigan: “When I took a sample of normal blood and did the same thing, the mud crackswere far less extensive. They were ragged and they did not have the long path lengths ofthe ones in the bovine sample. What this means is that the liquid from the anomaloussubstance is very homogeneous. There were no cell particles to interrupt the forces thatcaused these so-called mud crack patterns. That being the case, I went back and thoughtabout this finding of the blue particles. The one thing that crossed my mind here is,although it seemed very doubtful at the time, the only way I could see that these blueclusters could form at the center of all this red liquid was if this were actually purehemoglobin and still active biochemically.The blue particles, what they indicate, if this is hemoglobin and it formed carboxy-hemoglobin, then this means that you would see this blue color because without oxygenhemoglobin has a blue color. The iron at the center of the hemoglobin molecule is changedfrom the ferrous to the ferric state. In hemoglobin, the ferrous state of iron is more stablethan in the other iron compounds. The reason is that there is a residue on the hemoglobinmolecule which prevents it from being reduced to the ferric form. Any loss or deactivationof this residue in the process of creating the compressed, black particles could explain theblue colored tissue regions.The homogeneity of the thing - the fact that erythrocytes and leukocytes are missing -somehow they had to be extracted from the blood of the animal in order to obtain the veryhomogeneous hemoglobin. To do this, you need to break down the cell membranes to theerythrocytes and leukocytes to remove the hemoglobin molecules. To do this, requires alaboratory procedure with very precise biochemical steps. It's totally incomprehensible howthe hemoglobin could be removed in the middle of the night out in the middle of a pastureand separated from all the other cellular components.Then, you have to consider the fact that it was also now formed into a solid compact formwhich retained the biochemical activities of the molecule. In other words, in this process ofdehydration - if heat was involved, it was a very gentle heating because it would have to begentle in order to not heat the liquid up high enough to get actual degradation of theproteins. If it were high, you wouldn't have hemoglobin any more.Here you have two basic enigmas: how was it removed in the fresh state and remainedbiochemically active in a very pure form? And second, how was this formed into a solidthat looks like a piece of old, black Bakelite - a very black, hard substance. I sent theparticles to several laboratories. They took one look at this and said, 'This sure isn'themoglobin because whoever heard of hemoglobin in a solid, black form?' They dismissedit.Then a couple of years ago, I began working with a retired analytical chemist in Ohionamed Phyllis Budinger. She has the latest state-of-the-art infrared spectral photometer. So,I thought it would be an excellent idea if we sent some of these black particles to her andsee what she could find. To my great interest and delight, she came up with the conclusionthere was not much doubt that this material was pure hemoglobin, bovine hemoglobin. Shewrote a report on this dated July 31, 2000 to me and she has shown the infrared curves andthere is no doubt."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Infrared spectroscopy: “Bull Residue- Testicles” on top; “Bull Residue-Side”in middle; known samples of pure bovine hemoglobin purchased from Sigma Aldrichfor “Hemoglobin Reference” on bottom. Spectra provided byPhyllis A. Budinger, Analytical Chemist.Further, she got some blood from steak and examined the infrared characteristics of thatand, of course, it was quite different with all the other chemical cell components such aserythrocytes and leukocytes in it that were entirely missing from the bull's blood. With thatanalysis, it was very conclusive that the dark material at the bovine excision sites was veryanomalous.So, what this does in my estimation, it takes it out of the realm of the predators, takes it outof the realm of devil worshipers.THAT RAISES THE QUESTION ABOUT WHAT TECHNOLOGY WOULD BEREQUIRED TO BREAK THE BLOOD FLUID IN A COW DOWN INTOHEMOGLOBIN IN THE FIELD?Oh, absolutely! This has to be an extremely sophisticated process. And remember, themolecules are completely dehydrated, but they are not destroyed and not injured. They arestill active hemoglobin with all the other components removed. Yes, I have no idea how thiswas done.Further, the hypothesis that everyone has had, or the assumption, that the blood is removed I don't think it's removed at all. I think this sample gives us a very good clue that the bloodis disintegrated, maybe to its very elemental material. If that is the case, the only thing thatwould be left to look at is the iron that is left over from the center of the hemoglobinmolecule.I think if someone would examine the arterial wall with an EDS (energy dispersivespectroscopy) to get some idea of the amount of iron on the arterial wall of one of thesebovine excision sites and then get one from a slaughterhouse, from a normal animal, thenyou might find a much higher iron level in the veins and arteries than ordinarily. Andanother thing I think is interesting is that we've got this information from a number of sitesnow - that when people take a compass with them, they find that when they are right overthe animal, they get a very strong deviation from the normal north position. Then a coupleof days later, the magnetic abnormality disappearsWhat that suggests is that there is something magnetic for awhile in the animal. Now, howdo you explain that?It is quite apparent from the black particles that probably a non-oxidizing, maybe evenchemically reducing, atmosphere was present at whatever process was carried out to breakthe blood down and remove everything but the hemoglobin. In that case of total blooddisintegration, in a possible non-oxygen atmosphere, the iron would end up in the reducedstate which would be in the magnetite form. If it is a high deposit in the arteries and bloodcells, that could cause the deflection of a magnet.Conversely, over time all the oxidizing compounds and liquids inside the animal could, in amatter of hours, oxidize the concentrated iron residue to the non-magnetic form ofhematite. So, it would not be surprising if that change could explain the disappearance ofthe magnetic effect after a day or so.\"Analytical chemist Phyllis Budinger's analysis is described in Part 3 of this report.Continued in Part 3Return to Part 1.Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund PolicyCopyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
