People in formation did notseem aware of the mysterious light seen and videotaped © 1999 by Donald Fletcher ofLondon.August 23, 2000 Wilcot, Wiltshire, England - On August 12, 2000 before weclimbed Woodborough Hill to watch for mysterious lights, graphic artist, AndyBuckley, and his partner, Hazel, and I met at The Golden Swan pub in Wilcot,Wiltshire to talk about the intelligence in the mysterious lights each has sensedthe past few years. Andy has a dozen videotapes of light phenomena associatedwith the crop formations, both day and night.His most dramatic July 18, 2000 videotape from Pickled Hill down into thewheat field below Woodborough Hill shows at least six small, white objects thatclosely resemble the white object in the photograph above by Donald Fletcherof London. On August 7, 1999, Donald was videotaping with his camcorder inthe Barbury Castle triple crescents formation when his eyes caught a glimpse oftwo white objects, one moving especially fast. He focused his camera on that fastobject and got about thirty seconds on tape of it traveling over the formation. Asthe object passed low over the tramlines, it appeared to be about the size of afootball - a size in the 12 to 15 inch range with which Andy Buckley wouldagree.Interview:\"My belief is that the mysterious lights could be there allthe time in greater numbers and in some kind of invisible"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"state in another frequency...\"- Andy Buckley, Graphics ArtistWilcot, England, August 12, 2000Andy Buckley, Graphics Artist, and his partner, Hazel, Wilcot, England: \"Ithink the lights that appear are actually quite common if you know where tolook for them and when to go out. They can be seen quite frequently.IS THERE A TIME PERIOD FOR NIGHT WATCHING YOU FAVOR?Most of the objects that I have videotaped probably happened between 9 and 11PM in the evening. But I wouldn't say there is any specific time period whenthey appear. That's usually the time I like to go out, but I do know lights havebeen seen during the day and later at night and throughout the year. Some havebeen seen in the winter.OF YOUR DOZEN VIDEOTAPED SEQUENCES OF MYSTERIOUSLIGHTS, HOW MANY ARE IN THE SAME GEOGRAPHIC AREA?Most of the lights have been seen in the Vale of Pewsey which stretches roughlyfrom Devizes through to Pewsey and beyond on both sides of the valley.WHERE WERE YOU WHEN YOU VIDEOTAPED?Several places: Knap Hill, Woodborough Hill, Martinsell Hill and sometimes inthe Everleigh direction. But Knap Hill and Woodborough Hill, in that generalarea, seem to be active spots to see lights.IN ADDITION TO THE DRAMATIC JULY 18, 2000 VIDEOTAPE YOUGOT OF THE SIX LIGHTS AND HELICOPTER AT WOODBOROUGHHILL, IS THERE ANOTHER INCIDENT THAT STANDS OUT IN YOURMIND?Possibly one incident occurred in 1993 which I think was the first time Iwitnessed an unusual light down here, so I have fond memories of it and didmanage to videotape it which was July 31, 1993 at about half past 9 PM fromKnap Hill. I had gone for a sky watch and saw this light that appeared still indaylight. It was a bright orange-white light that was oval shaped and it wasmoving across from west to east. It was a case I investigated quite intensely. Ihad the videotape analyzed and it was pretty good footage. There were referencepoints in the field of view and it was not a satellite nor meteor nor anything likethat. It was certainly an unidentified flying object.SOME PEOPLE TALK ABOUT THE SENSE OF SOMETHINGSTARING BACK AT THEM WHICH SEEMS TO HAVEINTELLIGENCE. HAVE YOU HAD ANY OF THAT SENSE WHENYOU'VE BEEN WATCHING OR VIDEOTAPING MYSTERIOUSLIGHTS?Yes, my view is that I have an interaction with the lights, although it's quitedifficult to explain because it's a very personal experience that I have. But I'vefound that most objects have appeared when there's a certain state of mind. It'squite difficult to explain, but I've always felt the lights seem to respond to a sortof positive state of mind. I have gone out not feeling particularly positive aboutseeing anything and nothing happens. When I've been in a fairly optimistic frameof mind, the lights seem to appear. There also seems to be an interactionbetween the lights. I've noticed that in quite a few cases, the lights seem to resist"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"being filmed. When video equipment is packed away, they seem to appear.When video cameras are pointing at them, they seem to shy away and not appearvery frequently. Although that tends to contradict the other incident that Idescribed (July 18, 2000).The interactive aspect is quite interesting, but also quite disturbing because itseems that the objects do respond to certain thought patterns or states of mind.Quite which way this works, I don't know. There's also a condition called the'Oz Factor.' I think it's from the Wizard of Oz. I think it has something to do withthe fact that shortly before a sighting occurs, there's a certain atmosphere thatoccurs where everything goes completely quiet and silent. You seem to be highlyaware of your surroundings and it's almost as if you're in a kind of dream state.And certainly, I've had this experience not only with the lights, but with theappearance of crop formations. So, there may be a connection there. Certainly,this atmosphere has appeared.But also the lights do seem to cause certain mental or physical conditions aswell. There are times when lights have appeared and maybe you can sense themin a kind of almost physical way. The atmosphere changes. The temperaturemaybe changes. Air pressure changes. That kind of thing. That might becoincidence or it may be the result of the lights themselves, particularly if theyare plasma-based. They could cause some kind of ionization effect on the airaround them. But I have the impression that the lights are intelligentlycontrolled in the sense that they do seem to respond to thought patterns andthoughts put out towards them.IF YOU WERE SPECULATING BASED ON WHAT YOU HAVE FELT,WHAT DO YOU THINK THEIR PURPOSE IS? WHAT ARE THELIGHTS? THEIR SOURCE?That's something I have been researching for many years now. I don't have anyspecific view or theory as to the origin of these lights. There are obviouslyvarious theories around, everything from natural phenomenon such as earthlights to craft that are extraterrestrial or other dimensional. I think on the basisof my own research, I would say there is definitely something more to the lightsthat would take them beyond just a natural or earth light phenomenon.Although, it could be that how the lights operate depends on certainatmospheric or geological conditions in the area. It may be that there are certainmagnetic states that exist which may influence the appearance of these lights andhow they operate. But, from my own observation, it does appear that there issome kind of purpose or intelligence.HAVE YOU EVER EXPERIENCED ANYTHING THAT WOULD FALLINTO THE CATEGORY OF TELEPATHIC COMMUNICATION WITHTHESE LIGHTS?Yes, in the sense that I seem to have a kind of extra-sensory awareness of themabout when and where they are likely to appear. It's difficult to quantify. Iwould love have really good equipment, technology, to try to measure some ofthese responses. Some researchers have used technology and come up with someinteresting results relating to the use of meditation, or the use of certain thoughtimages in relationship to these lights. And also, they have been captured oninfrared and other kinds of film other than normal film that tends to suggest theycan exist in the invisible state. I'm not talking only about lights that I haveactually seen, but my belief is that these objects could be there all the time ingreater numbers and in some kind of invisible state in another frequency orwhatever. So, that's something that's quite interesting.WHEN YOU HAVE THE SENSE THAT THEY MIGHT BE THERE ORABOUT TO BECOME VISIBLE, DO YOU CONCENTRATE ON ANY"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"KIND OF SPECIFIC MENTAL IMAGE YOURSELF IN ORDER TOILLICIT THE INTERACTION?Yeah, I drew up a kind of list of conditions that I thought were conducive tolights appearing. I've also found that it's not just an intellectual response, butalso certain emotional states seem to work. Certainly conditions are that a highdegree of concentration is required.WHAT WOULD BE AN EMOTIONAL STATE THAT HAS WORKEDFOR YOU?Possibly a need for, or desire for, something to happen, whether it's a light orother happening. I don't know how it relates to the appearance of these thingsbecause it's very difficult to quantify. Obviously, you can be in a positive state ofmind and nothing happens. And you can be in a really bad mood or low state ofmind and something happens. But I think in all this, it's a certain focusing ofconcentration or a certain awareness of one's own state and the kind of shuttingoff of outside distractions which I find is quite important. I've had more successin seeing the lights when I've been able to focus and concentrate without a lot ofdistractions.ROBBERT IN HOEVEN, HOLLAND, HE HAS DESCRIBED A SENSETHAT THE LIGHTS ARE ANGELIC AND THAT THEY ARECONCERNED ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS. HE SAYSTHERE IS A PROBLEM WITH 'DECEIT' AND THAT THE CROPFORMATIONS ARE AN 'ANTIDOTE' TO THE DECEIT. DOES ANY OFTHAT MAKE ANY SENSE TO YOU BASED ON YOUR EXPERIENCESWITH THE LIGHTS?Yes, in the sense that I feel that my own belief is that the intelligence in the lightconsciousness, or whatever you want to call it, can read our thoughts. I think it'saware of how we are with regard to the idea that the lights may be related toangels or devic beings or nature spirits. I find that quite interesting and notsomething I originally entertained. I was very dubious about those kinds ofideas. I was very much into the idea that it was rather nuts and bolts phenomenaor it was natural phenomena. But having experienced these objects andresearched these other theories, I find there could be a lot of interestingcorrelation between these ideas and the lights. I feel the lights are related to theenvironment, to the landscape - not just in this area, but in other parts of thecountry and other countries across the globe where these lights have been seen.HAVE YOU EVER HAD A SIGHTING OF SOMETHING THAT FELLINTO THE CRAFT CATEGORY OR AN EXPERIENCE WITH ANENTITY IN A FIELD, HOME OR ANY OTHER CONTACT?Not personally. I originally started researching the whole subject in 1972. I wasan amateur astronomer at the time. A lot of objects I witnessed occurred in the1970s. A lot of lights I witnessed were lights in the sky or luminosities.However, in the late 1970s, I did witness possibly two or three objects that weremore in the category of structured craft. They were obviously quite large inshape carrying lights and were not clearly aircraft. What they were, is anothermatter.I GET THE SENSE THAT MAYBE YOU HAVE HAD EXPERIENCES,HAZEL?Hazel and I were doing a sky watch at the foot of Knap Hill and while this wasgoing on, a larger sky watch was taking place just across the field onWoodborough Hill. They were seeing quite a few orange lights maneuvering at"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"the end of the valley. We did see some lights in that area. But from about 9:30PM onwards, we saw in the Everleigh direction on the other side of the valley,very orange lights that kept appearing and disappearing. They only stayed inview for a few seconds. I had a video camera on a tripod and every time I tried tofilm the objects, they just disappeared. So, after a period of maybe an hour,Hazel made a comment to me ...Hazel: 'If the camera was in the bag, maybe the lights would actually appear.' Isaid something like that. We waited a little longer and decided maybe nothingwas going to happen. So, Andy packed up the camera. Then I said, 'It's all right,now. You can come. He's just put the camera away.' And a few seconds later, avery large ball of orange light appeared over the hill where the other lights hadbeen appearing. It gradually moved along to the right and as I was looking at it, Ifelt it was homing in on me and communicating with my brain or trying to takesomething out of my brain. It was quite alarming at the time. It rather spookedme for a while after that. I felt there was definitely some kind of interactiongoing on and I wasn't sure I liked what was happening.CAN YOU DESCRIBE WHAT YOU WERE FEELING WHEN IT WASAS IF SOMETHING WERE GOING OUT OF YOUR MIND?Yes, it was definitely like a probe. Something was present in my head and wastrying to take something out of me. That's the thing that spooked me because Iwasn't quite sure what it was doing and I didn't like the feeling at all. I got thisfeeling in the center of my forehead. There wasn't any pain, but just a strangefeeling as I was looking at the lights. I was rather transfixed by the lights, somaybe there was some connection between me actually looking at it and itscommunicating that way.DID YOU FEEL LIKE SOMETHING WAS BUZZING OR VIBRATINGIN YOUR MIND WHEN YOU HAD THE IMPRESSION OFSOMETHING GOING OUT?No, I wouldn't say that anything was actually buzzing. It just felt as if it weredraining from me. It was a very strange feeling.DID YOU HAVE ANY VISUAL IMPRESSIONS ALONG WITH THEFEELING?No, I don't recall having any visual impressions.WHAT HAPPENED?Possibly because I started to feel fear, the lights did go out and it stopped. It justblinked out like the lights do tend to do. And as it blinked out, the feelingstopped.HOW BIG DO YOU THINK THE ORANGE LIGHT WAS?It's very difficult to say what size it was because it was quite a distance awayfrom us. On a scale of these normal orange luminosities, this was a fairly largeone.WAS IT THE GLOWING ORANGE SPHERE AS OPPOSED TOTRANSLUCENT?Yes. It was not the translucent variety. It was the orange ball of light."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ANDY, DO YOU HAVE ANY HARD EVIDENCE OR KNOW ANYONEWHO HAS HARD EVIDENCE THAT THE BRITISH GOVERNMENTAND AMERICAN GOVERNMENT ARE WORKING TOGETHERFROM SATELLITES IN TERMS OF MONITORING CERTAIN HERTZFREQUENCIES THAT MIGHT BE RELATED TO THESE LIGHTS ANDTHEN SCRAMBLING HELICOPTERS OR JETS TO WHERE THELIGHTS APPEAR?I'm not particularly knowledgeable about the satellite monitoring of a cropformation or lights, but my own observations in this area make me absolutelyconvinced that the military are aware of the objects and obviously the cropformations. They fly over the crop formations every day. The response to theappearance of these light objects is extremely rapid, within minutes. I'veexperienced interceptions between helicopters and lights. This has also beencaptured on film. Other people have witnessed this apart from myself.There is a lot of military activity in the area which is very close to the SalisburyPlain. There is a certain degree of military maneuvers and training that goes oninvolving helicopters, but of course, it's also a convenient cover for them toobserve these objects and not draw attention to themselves. Certainly, therehave been incidents where the helicopters and lights have been caught togetheron film. I've investigated this. I've written to the Ministry of Defence and theArmy. Of course, they are going to deny it on the record. Off the record is adifferent story, however. I think they are quite prepared to admit that somethingis happening. Whether the objects are - how they are related to the military isanother matter. I wouldn't know about that. But certainly the military are awarethe objects exist and monitor their activity.WHAT HAVE PEOPLE TOLD YOU OFF THE RECORD?I've spoken to one pilot who was a helicopter pilot and he made a comment thatthey were aware that these objects existed. He didn't go into great detail. Andobviously, the crop formations. The helicopters have quite sophisticatedequipment to detect the objects of these objects on radar and they presumablycan intercept them quite quickly.WHY WOULD THE MILITARY BE THREATENED BY WHITE ORORANGE BALLS OF LIGHT THAT MAKE CROP FORMATIONS?I wouldn't think they were threatened by them. I think the lights could possiblyhave defense implications in that they are violating air space quite close to asensitive military area in the Salisbury Plain. Any unidentified objects thatappear in this area are going to be very closely monitored. Some would say theobjects are military in origin. Of course, that's another issue. I don't feel they are,but the military are definitely aware of the objects. Perhaps the lights createcertain magnetic anomalies in the area. It's very close to air corridors that areused by military aircraft. Perhaps if the military suffers instrument failure, maybethey need to know what and where these objects are for their own protection.HAS ANYBODY IN THE MILITARY OR GOVERNMENT TALKED TOYOU OFF THE RECORD ABOUT ANY KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THEPURPOSE OF THE CROP FORMATIONS IF DONE BY ANOTHERINTELLIGENCE?Not to me personally. I don't know about other people. But, I investigated myown sightings and have written to the MOD and military bases in the area.They've shown interest in the existence of the objects. They wanted to viewvideo footage that I have taken."},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"HAVE YOU SHOWN IT TO THEM?No. (laughs) I just feel they already have enough footage of their own. Theydon't need my footage.WOULD YOUR CONCERN BE THAT THEY MIGHT END UPCONFISCATING YOUR TAPE?No, I think they have enough footage of their own. I think some are interested inkeeping a watch on researchers in this area. Of that, I'm absolutely convinced. Iwould say they are probably not keen on researchers and people who interactwith this phenomenon. The authorities have their own agenda and I think maybethey resent independent researchers in this area and the fact that we can step ontheir feet. I don't know.WHAT IF THERE IS SOME KIND OF ENCODED MATHEMATICALLANGUAGE IN THE CROP FORMATIONS AND ALREADY HAVESOME GLIMMER OF WHAT IS BEHIND THE FORMATIONS?They may have the information. It's interesting that this kind of phenomenonappears almost on the doorstep of one of the largest military ranges in England. Idon't see how the military could fail to be aware of the crop circle phenomenon.I would say that they have probably been researching, certainly the mysteriouslights phenomenon, probably thirty years in Wiltshire.DO YOU HAVE HARD KNOWLEDGE ABOUT RESEARCH GOINGBACK THAT FAR?Yes, because the objects that are appearing currently in the Vale of Pewsey I'msure are the same kind of objects appearing in the Warminster area in the 1960s.I do feel there is a real connection between the Warminster phenomenon and thephenomenon that is now appearing here in the sense that the objects seen arevery similar in description. In Warminster, the military did research thephenomenon there. Of course, Warminster has a large military presence there aswell.THE 1960S EVENTS IN WARMINSTER WERE PUT IN THECATEGORY OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL INTERFACE WITH EARTH.DO YOU THINK THERE IS A SHIFT IN YOUR MIND ORGOVERNMENT THINKING THAT PERHAPS THE LIGHTS MIGHTBE IN ANOTHER CATEGORY?I think the jury is still out on that as far as the origins of the crop circles and thelights. I remain agnostic. There are so many theories ranging from extraterrestrialto inter-dimensional to earth light natural phenomena. But in the Warminsterarea, it is interesting that the crop circles had their origin or genesis in theWarminster area. That is not something that is widely published, but certainly inthe late 1960s in association with the appearance of unidentified objects in theWarminster area. There were ground markings, fairly simple, but they werethere. It could be that some kind of migration occurred with the phenomenon forsome reason to this area (of Wiltshire). Although crop formations do still appearnear Warminster, but to a lesser extent. The UFO phenomenon is still appearingin that area. I'm sure the military is aware of that fact.Then there are the writings of Arthur Shuttlewood. He was the prime author andjournalist in the area at the time. Although a lot of people find his books verycontroversial and some have written him off as a crank, I think reading between"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"the lines, he was very prophetic in what he wrote in his books. Certainly, inregard to the phenomenon not being necessarily of extraterrestrial origin. ArthurShuttlewood did mention in some of his books that there could be a strangerorigin for these lights, perhaps.LIKE OTHER DIMENSIONAL OR ANGELIC?Possibly, yes. And also he related the appearance of the lights to possibleground markings and crop formations which were innovative at the time beforecrop circle researchers appeared on the scene.\"We b s it e :http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
