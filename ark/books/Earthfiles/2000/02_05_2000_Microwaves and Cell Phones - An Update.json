Dr. Cherry considers theproliferation of cell phones, microwave towers and microwave pollution to be aserious contributor to cancer, brain tumors and increasing neurological problemsamong the human population. Several thousand more microwave towers areexpected to be built in the United States in the next few years. The following area series of audience questions and Dr. Cherry's responses this week.Interview:Neil Cherry, Ph.D., Biophysicist, Lincoln University in Christ Church,New Zealand:\"1. Even if the cell phone itself is shielded, isn't the antennae the source ofmost of the offending radiation? Is there a way to shield it, too?The antenna of the mobile phone travels down the length of the hand piece. Toshield the user from this, the body of the phone and the antenna need to beshielded. There is at least one such shield on the market (Microshield) whichencases the handset in a metal grid which is embedded in the leather pouch. Ithas a sliding extension which goes up the aerial on the head side, thus protectingthe user's head from more than 95% of the radiation.\"Another is: BrainGuard - this product will position the cellular antenna awayfrom the head to lower the amount of RF that is absorbed by the brain. Contact:Martsales@msn.com or P. O. Box 7704, Algonquin, IL. 60102-7704.2. Does it help to use a remote mike and earpiece?Dr. Cherry: \"The hand-free kit does help a great deal by keeping most of theradiation from the user's head. But don't keep the phone in a breast pocket or onyour belt near your liver, kidneys, womb or testes because the microwaveradiation can break chromosomes wherever they are.\"3. Did the studies find if there is a threshold at which the radiationbecomes harmful? Or is being on your phone just a few minutes a month asbad over time?Dr. Cherry: \"We do not know of a threshold. However, risk is proportional toaccumulated usage. Any reduction in number of calls, length of calls, hands freeuse and so on reduces risk.\"4. Can a person minimize the damage by making the call as brief aspossible?Dr. Cherry: \"Yes, a person can minimize damage by using only brief calls.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"5. What is the best material to use for shielding from microwave and otherforms of electromagnetic radiation?Dr. Cherry: \"Distance is good. A fine metal mesh can provide significantshielding from UHF and microwave radiation. That is why microwave ovenshave a metal grill over the glass door. If the holes are much smaller than thewavelength of the radiation, it is a good shield. The shield works mainly byreflection.\"6. Are there any nutritional supplements that can help repair the damageto the human body?Dr. Cherry: \"Good fresh fruit and vegetables are full of anti-oxidants which areessential for repairing the body. Melatonin is a potent free radical scavenger. Agood night's sleep produces good melatonin. Unfortunately as we age, we havelower and lower natural melatonin which causes accelerated cell death and celldamage. This is why cancer rates rise very significantly after 65 years. It is alsothe cause of neurological degeneration and disease.\" Melatonin supplementsmight be helpful.7. I would like to know if the new digital phones are also microwave bandphones, or are they different? What disadvantages might there be in usingthem?Dr. Cherry: \"The new digital phones are microwave. The signal is pulsed toproduce the digital signal. Pulses are shown to be worse than continuous wavesin causing cell damage and cancer.\"8. What is the brand name of a cell phone manufacturer trying to providemore shielding?Dr. Cherry: \"The brand name of a low emission phone is Nokia, a very largemobile phone manufacturer in Finland.\"9. Could you address the issue of computers and cordless phones? Mychildren spend hours writing reports and doing homework on thecomputer, not to mention games and surfing the web, and I am concernedabout what potential health hazards this may pose. I also have a cordlessphone and was wondering if you are exposed to microwaves using acordless phone?Dr. Cherry: \"Computers: There is a wide range of low frequency and radiofrequency radiation from computer screens. Modern screens have much loweremission levels than older computers. The computer I am using to send thise-mail to you is producing 35 microwatts/sq. cm. at the screen which reduces to0.05 at my head and at womb level. This is radio frequency radiation whichpenetrates tissue more effectively than low frequency fields. With homecomputers and children starting very early, it is a real worry because a U. S.study, Beall et al (1996) Epidemiology 7 (2): pages 125-130, shows thatcomputer programmers develop and die more from brain tumors, with the rateincreasing with the years of work:a) Up to 5 years exposure, OR = 0.6 95% CI: 0.2-1.9b) 5 to 9 years exposure, OR = 1.9 95% CI: 0.7-5.2c) 10 years or more, OR = 2.8 95% CI: 1.1-7.0Since our brains detect and use very low frequency signals from the SchumannResonances, which have a mean intensity of about 0.0000001 microwatts/sq.cm. (0.1 picowatts/sq. cm.), it is not surprising that at exposures which aremillions of times higher, there is increased brain cell damage and an increased"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"risk of brain tumor in a dose-response manner. This kind of result is indicative ofcause and effect.Portable phones (not cell phones) use a high frequency radio signal which isn'ttoo far from the mobile phone frequency, but are much less powerful thanmobile cell phones. So they do expose our heads to measurable RF radiation.Hence, portable non-cell phones are low risk, but not risk free. Some peoplereport a 'fuzzy head' after a long call on a portable phone.Cell phone users describe dose-response symptoms of dizziness, loss of memoryand concentration and headaches. Some people also report nausea. Thisprobably is caused by differential heating of fluid in the middle ear affecting thebalance mechanism.\"A sampling of audience e-mails:\"I am a cell phone user. Your report has confirmed to me what I have alreadybeen coming to the conclusion about recently. I didn't want to believe that theprolonged use of my cell phone (more than a few minutes here and there) wascausing my headaches and confusion. However, I'm absolutely sure it's true. Mybrother tells me that his eye starts twitching uncontrollably when he uses his.On longer conversations, I find myself needing to shift frequently from ear to earto get relief. They are so damned convenient!!! That's the big problem in a worldthat seems to be going faster and faster every day now. Thanks for your report.The word needs to get out.\"\"I have suffered so much from EMF since living in a home I bought in 1995which I've actually had to move from. I now live in the woods away frommicrowave towers, but I am super sensitive to EMF. I know of others alsosuffering in the dark. One lady in particular is very ill from living in anapartment that has approximately 25 antennas on the roof. She is trapped withvery little resources to move and no help from government.\"\"Are you aware that there is a trend in the design of new cordless phones thatoperate in the 2.3 gig frequency and these could perhaps be even moredamaging?\"More Information:The Chicago Tribune reported on January 14, 2000 that a 6-month ban on theconstruction of microwave cell towers has been imposed by the Lakewood,Illinois Village Board. The vote was unanimous. Lakewood currently has noordinance in its zoning code for telecommunications towers and federal lawstates that municipalities cannot prohibit the towers entirely.Village Manager Mike Friesen said: \"We want to have some control over them.It's more of a means of protection.\"A major source of information about legal issue of Wireless Technology Impactson people and the environment is:California Council on Wireless Technology ImpactsContact: Libby Kelley, libbykelley@ccwti.orgWeb Site: http://www.ccwti.org/PH: 415-892-1863 and FAX: 415-892-3108\"There is strong evidence that extreme low frequency (ELF) and radio frequencymicrowaves (RF/MW) are associated with accelerated aging (enhanced celldeath and cancer) and moods, depression, suicide, anger, rage and violence,primarily through alteration of cellular calcium ions and the melatonin/serotonin"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"balance.\" - Dr. Neil Cherry, Lincoln University, New Zealand from his June1998 report, Actual or potential effects of ELF and RF/MW radiation onaccelerating aging of human, animal or plant cells.See the book Electromagnetic Fields, A Consumer's Guide to the Issues andHow to Protect Ourselves by B.
