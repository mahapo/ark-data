D., Research Physicist at the Naval Surface Warfare Center(NSWC) in Dahlgren, Virginia begins with the complex politics of the USAF,FBI, CIA and one of the main reasons for their cover-up policy about the UFOmystery. On May 1, 2000, his book The UFO/FBI Connection, was releaseddetailing his research since 1976 into FBI documents and knowledge about theUFO mystery.Interview:Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist, Naval Surface WarfareCenter (NSWC), Dahlgren, Virginia:FBI, USAF, The CIA and the UFO Cover-Up\"But not for the FBI. In October of 1952, the FBI learned about the famousNewhouse Utah movie. And the FBI was told that all sorts of analysis had beendone and it could not be explained. And the FBI also learned that top militaryofficials were considering interplanetary ships. There are two documents in theAir Force file that indicate that."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"October 27, 1952 internal Office Memorandum from FBI Agent V. P. Keay to FBI AgentA. B. Belmont on the Subject of 'FLYING SAUCERS.\" Despite U. S. governmentpropaganda to the media and public that UFOs were only misidentified weather balloons,meteors and swamp gas, the Synopsis of this memo tells a completely different story:\"Military officials are seriously considering the possibility of interplanetary ships.\"Document provided by Navy research physicist Bruce S. Maccabee.I should point out that I have other information in my book which suggests thatthe top Air Force officials assumed that flying saucers were interplanetary andthat there was nothing they could do about them and that is why Project SIGNor Project BLUE BOOK were never high level projects. The top people knewwhat was going on and knew nothing they could do about it. They had a publicrelations problem which BLUE BOOK was designed to deal with. They did notwant the general public to realize that something was going on that they had nocontrol over, so the attempt was to damp it down as much as possible.IT''S BEEN A WAITING GAME LIKE THAT FOR FIFTY YEARS.Yes, and you asked what did the CIA have to do with it? I have a chapter called\"The X-Files, CIA Version.\" In August 1952, all these sightings were too muchfor the General Walter Bedell Smith, Director of the CIA, and he decided tohave a little research group to find out what was going on. Where the CIA madetheir mistake was in going to Air Force Technical Intelligence Center there inWright-Patterson AFB where they were told, 'Oh, by the way, we can explain allsorts of stuff.' The CIA was not told that 3% were unexplained.Remember, that the information that the FBI got came from the Air ForceIntelligence in the Pentagon. However, the CIA went over to Dayton, Ohio, toWright-Patterson AFB, to talk to the Air Technical Intelligence people there. Itwas there job by tradition, thanks to General Vandenberg, to explain everything!And so they basically told the CIA all sorts of things can be explained. And theCIA guy went back to Washington and told the Director that the Air Forceseems to be handling the problem. However, they are not doing what we wouldlike them to do. We would like to know why these reports are generated in thefirst place. And we want to know why there can't be more rapid identification.The CIA was worried about two possibilities:1) A sudden flux of flying saucer reports at a time when an attack was imminent"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"could clog information channels.2) And the second thing they were worried about was that if an object in the skywere not identified immediately, we might waste some of our precious aircraftsending them after this object and the airplanes would get close to the objectand say, 'Oh, it's a weather balloon.' In other words, if Soviet agents suddenlystarted to sprinkle flying saucers and launch weird looking balloons, they mightclog communication channels and they might raise spurious targets for ouraircraft while their own aircraft were sneakily getting into our borders anddropping bombs.THIS IS THE CONFUSING PART OF THE HISTORY, BRUCE. WHY ISIT THAT THE UNITED STATES ALLOWED THE SOVIET UNION TOBE THE FALL GUY FOR THE PHENOMENON THAT WAS PUT INTHE POSSIBILITY OF BEING INTERPLANETARY, MEANINGNON-HUMAN FROM SOME OTHER PLACE? WHY WOULD WEALLOW EVERYONE IN MILITARY AND THE PUBLIC AND THEMEDIA TO KEEP ASSUMING THAT THIS WAS A SOVIET THREAT?THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT THIS HISTORICALLY THAT IS SOSCHIZOPHRENIC.I know. But remember, the CIA was not saying there was a real Soviet threat.The CIA was not arguing that the Soviets were flying saucers over us. They wereworried about the communication channels being clogged and the possibility ofspurious targets, unidentified targets up there which we might be vectoring ourjets toward and not vectoring our jets toward the real T-shaped aircraft flyingalong dropping bombs.REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE UNIDENTIFIEDS WERE, THEY WEREACTUALLY WORRIED ABOUT A SOVIET INTRUSION USING THEPHENOMENON FOR ITS OWN COVER.Sure. And the Psychological Strategy Board says, 'Hey, can we take the flyingsaucer phenomenon and turn it around and use it against them?' That's NOTsaying they think flying saucers were not interplanetary. But the problem wasthat the CIA went and talked to the ATIC people at Wright-Patterson AFB. Hadthe CIA gone to Air Force Intelligence in the Pentagon, they might have gotten adifferent story. But at ATIC where everything was supposedly going to beexplained that's what they were told, everything could be explained.If you look through the CIA files for the fall of 1952, it becomes clear that thisguy, Marshall Chadwell, who was in charge of the investigation of what theflying saucer stuff was all about, came upon some information. We don't knowwhat it was exactly because it's not in the files that were released. But somethingapparently convinced him there was really something going on that was not justa problem of communication channels and not being able to identify things. Butthere was something really bizarre happening. The document in the CIA fileindicates he was avid to set up a research group to find out why sightings wereunidentified.Ultimately, he wanted to write a document for a National Security CouncilIntelligence Directive, a so-called NSCID, to have a special project set up. Butthen some other people argued to have a scientific panel first to find out whatthe probability is that there is really something unusual in these flying saucersightings. And that's what ended up being the Robertson Panel. And of course,we all know what happened with the Robertson Panel. A bunch of gray beards,old guys well known in the fields of research, got together and stumbled in afield they really weren't familiar with, the flying saucers.Oddly enough in this case, the Air Technical Intelligence people, the ProjectBLUE BOOK guys, Ruppelt, we're talking about January 1953, put their bestfoot forward and tried to get the best 100 cases or what ever it was to present tothese people. But the scientists were adamant that everything could beexplained. The Newhouse movie that so impressed the Air Force and the Navy,the Navy photographic analysts, that it led to the document in the FBI file"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"saying that top Air Force officials are considering interplanetary spaceships -that film was explained as birds in the Robertson Panel. As seagulls! Totallyignoring Newhouse's own description when the objects were closer to him andthat they were circular, shiny metallic things.So, after the debunking, the CIA got out of it. They weren't interested any more.They did collect some documents over the following years. There are someinteresting UFO sightings in the CIA files. But they aren't really material I put inmy book because I am primarily interested in what the FBI did.The FBI following the 1952 thing still continued to collect information at a lowrate. There is a sighting in there by an FBI person, a lady who is described as\"one of our best employees\" and her boyfriend who worked for the NationalSecurity Agency (NSA).WHAT WAS THEIR SIGHTING LIKE?They were driving along early in the morning in North Carolina, according tothe report. The lady made the report and then they interviewed her a secondtime. They sent all this information to the Air Force Project BLUE BOOK and itdoesn't appear there. I don't know where it went.Anyway, they were driving along on a misty morning and some circular objectwent over their car. They both saw it and were obviously surprised by it. Thereis no indication that the Air Force took any interest or interviewed them in anymore depth. All we've got on it is what's in the FBI file.April 24, 1964 - Socorro, New Mexico Policeman Lonnie Zamora's Film Wentto USAFThe last sighting in the file is the Lonnie Zamora sighting. In my book, the firstthing I mention is the last sighting in the book which starts out with a teletypemessage from the agent in charge at Socorro, New Mexico. He was on the scenewithin 30 minutes of Zamora's sighting. And he did the most extensive interviewwith Zamora.THIS IS FBI?Yes, the FBI agent. I have one chapter in the book on the CIA and everythingelse is the FBI or Air Force. And this was the last sighting in the FBI file thatwas investigated. And it was not investigated on an official basis, according tothe FBI agent. But nevertheless, he sent plenty of information to headquartersand it forms the core of the Zamora sighting. People who haven't read about thatfor years will probably find some interesting stuff in there. For example, anotherpoliceman's report that he arrived at the scene within minutes of Zamora'ssighting and took pictures. He gave the film to the Air Force to be developed.When he asked them some weeks later, 'What happened to the photographs?'The Air Force said, 'The film was fogged.'FBI File Has a 1967 Abduction ReportThere is a document in the FBI file that was not investigated, but is related toabductions. In 1967, a guy called the FBI at 4 o'clock in the morning fromChesapeake, Virginia. He reported that he had been working in his store late thatnight. When he left the store, he thought he had been picked up by some strangecreatures, taken away, and then brought back. He wasn't absolutely sure whathad happened, but he was calling at 4 o'clock in the morning to report. So, theFBI agents checked through their files to see if they had a file on this guy andthey wrote down on the bottom of the report that there was no file on thisperson. That's all they did.I bring that up because debunker Phil Klass has been noted over the past fewyears to say that if abductions were real, they would report them to the FBI"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"because it's a federal offense. So, now we know what the FBI will do about UFOabductions.THEY CONFIRM THEY DON'T HAVE A FILE AND CLOSE IT.That's right. They investigate the abductee as opposed to the abductor.HOW DID RON PANDOLFI AT THE CIA COME TO BE INVOLVED INUFO INVESTIGATIONS IN 1984 ON?Kit Green, whom I had met in 1978 when I went to the CIA to talk about theNew Zealand sightings, I went there with some fear and trepidation withoutknowing what the heck was going on. I knew they had radar experts and Ithought maybe they could help me with some of the radar and if there wasanything TOP SECRET that happened to be flying around in New Zealand atthe time. But basically, what it amounted to was that I gave them a lot ofinformation and they gave me nothing.But I did meet this guy, Kit Green. Well, Kit Green, who by the way has been'outed' several times the past few years when it comes to paranormal and remoteviewing stuff. Puthoff and Targ did remote viewing research at Stanford ResearchInstitute twenty-five years ago or more. Kit Green was a medical doctor, but heheaded the CIA weird desk.The main point is that Puthoff and Targ had worked with Ingo Swann anddetermined that something was really going on there with remote viewing. And aguy at the CIA took an interest in it, a man who is dead now. The DefenseIntelligence Agency (DIA) was also involved in funding remote viewing. Therewas an intersection point between remote viewing and UFOs. This has nothingto do with my new book, but the remote viewing they were doing involvedputting a guy inside a room and asking him to identify or draw something thatappears to be what someone else is either looking at or had taken a photo of.They seemed to be getting some success. In Ingo Swann's book, Penetration, hetalks about finding that gantry or big crane thing in the Soviet Union. He did adrawing that looked very much like a perspective drawing of that big machine.And Ingo drew a UFO behind a submarine in one of his remote viewings. That'sthe kind of intersection I'm talking about.These guys who didn't believe in UFOs, but did believe strongly in metalbending, psychokinesis, remote viewing and all that mind research, weresuddenly confronted with the UFO problem right in their face.\" And the CIAwas putting money into remote viewing and they worried there was a remoteviewing gap between the U. S. and the Russians.When I talked with Kit Green in 1979, he was aware of all this, too, but hewouldn't tell me anything. He would only suck up information from meregarding the UFO aspect. But there was this intersection point where thepsychics started zeroing in on UFOs and the people in the paranormal side weresaying, 'This can't be. UFOs aren't real.'So they had to start investigating what was going on in the UFO community.Green, as the head of the weird desk at the CIA, was aware of all this in theparanormal and remote viewing and he was part of the intersection with UFOs.When he was trying to analyze the New Zealand case, he was standing theretalking about, he was wondering if the pilot and co-pilot had some kind oftemporary insanity? Could the reporter have hoaxed the film? They were tryingto come up with all sorts of explanations that I knew would be hokeyexplanations that made no sense at all. But from his point of view, he was tryingto explain it away. Remember, these guys did not come from the point of viewthat UFOs were real. They came from the point of view that psychic stuff wasreal."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Kit Green left the CIA in the early 1980s and Ron Pandolfi took over what KitGreen was doing. Pandolfi is a very smart guy and he ended up doing a lot ofdifferent research. Being in charge of the weird desk was only part of it. But alsohe was worried about the laser zapping gap which is why he contacted me in thefirst place back in 1984. Presumably, if he had contacted the other guy who wasworking on it, Charlie Bell, he never would have found out about the NewZealand UFOs and me and there never would have been any connection. Butbecause he called me and I happened to be the guy who answered the phone, Ialready had a reputation at the CIA because of the talk I'd given five yearsbefore.ABOUT NEW ZEALAND.Yeah. He started talking to me about UFO stuff. In 1987, we had the MUFONsymposium at American University in 1987 and there was a lot of publicityabout it. So, Ron Pandolfi invited me to give a talk at the CIA about UFOs. Itwas to be an open talk, that is in the sense that anybody at the agency couldshow up from secretaries, case workers and so on. And he told me that the roomit was in was the Director's Conference Room. There was a big long table in itand so many people showed up all the chairs in the room were taken up. Peoplewere standing around the outside. And guess what I told them? I told themabout their own CIA files. I carried coals to New Castle. I went through all thestuff we knew about the CIA and sightings and Pandolfi told me afterward that Icreated a lot of spies in the agency. People who were trying to dig up stuff thatmight be buried here and there. That's sort of how he got involved in this stuff.NOT BECAUSE HE HAD A SPECIFIC UFO ASSIGNMENT?It's a non-specific assignment. It's like the remote viewing. If there is a possibilitythat remote viewing is real and the Russians can do it, we had better be able todo it. So we put a few million dollars in over a few years. Pandolfi told me itwas something like $5 million bucks over 10 years they had put in to remoteviewing. Somewhere around the mid 1980s, it crashed and the whole programwas declassified and articles have been written about it in the last five years. Infact, Puthoff wrote an article that appeared in the Journal of ScientificExploration a couple of years ago where he said, 'Finally I can tell you what Iwas doing.'\"More Information:The UFO /FBI Connectionby Bruce S.
