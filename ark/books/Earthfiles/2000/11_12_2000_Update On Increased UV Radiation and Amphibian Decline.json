Photograph courtesy University of Minnesota.November 12, 2000 Corvallis, Oregon - This year the largest ozone hole onrecord at the Antarctic extended over the city of Punta Arenas in Chile,exposing humans, animals and plants to increased ultraviolet radiation whichcan cause skin cancer, kill amphibian embryos and stunt and deform those thatsurvive. Over the next four months, atmospheric scientists will be monitoringwhat happens at the North Pole. Will the Arctic ozone hole also get bigger aswinter takes hold and expose more humans, animals and plants to increasedultraviolet radiation?Largest Antarctic ozone hole recorded in history extends over the city of Punta Arenas,Chilein October 2000 which has exposed humans, animals and plants there to increasedultraviolet radiation.One zoologist who is very concerned about the effects of thinning ozone andincreased UV radiation is Dr. Andrew Blaustein at Oregon State University inCorvallis. After a large increase in numbers of deformed frogs, toads andsalamanders in the mid-1990s, and decline in amphibian populations around theworld, Dr. Blaustein began studying the animals in their natural Oregon lakehabitats. He reported in the December 1997 Proceedings of the NationalAcademy of Sciences that ambient UV-B radiation alone can cause death anddeformities in amphibian embryos.But eventually he and other scientists agreed that a fluke parasite was probablyresponsible for most of the reported deformities. However, no one is certain why"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the parasite suddenly infected so many amphibians over such a widespreadgeographic area. And deformities and population declines have continued.Deformed frog with two extra small, pink legsemerging from the amphibian's abdomen. Photograph courtesy University of Minnesota.Dr. Blaustein hypothesizes that increased UV radiation from large ozone holesweakens amphibian immune systems making them more vulnerable to diseaseand parasites. He also has new and troubling information that has recently beenpublished in England's Journal of Zoology; Germany's Ethology, and theAmerican Archives of Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry.Interview:Andrew Blaustein, Ph.D., Professor of Zoology, Oregon State University,Corvallis, Oregon: \"Recently we have shown that some species whose eggs arenot dying are still affected later on in life when they grow into tadpoles and intofrogs because they undergo sub-lethal effects - effects that don't kill themoutright, but really ruin their behavior and ruin the way they grow and develop.HOW AND IN WHAT WAY?There are several ways in which this occurs. Under (increased) ultravioletradiation, for example, some of these species will not recognize predators. Sothey get eaten. Or they won't be able to escape predators. They stop theirmovement patterns to a degree. They get slow. It looks like they have a fever andcan't move away.Another thing that happens is their growth is stunted. Sometimes they becomehyperactive and that aids their predator in capturing them. So, what I'm trying tosay is that in some cases it is good to hide and the animals don't hide after theyare exposed to UV. And in some cases, the animals come out and they startmoving around more, so they get captured more easily.EITHER WAY, THEY BECOME MORE VULNERABLE TOPREDATORS.Ye s .DO YOU HAVE ANY UNDERSTANDING ABOUT WHAT WOULD BEHAPPENING BETWEEN DOSE OF UV RADIATION AND THEIR NOTBEING ABLE TO PERCEIVE PREDATORS OR HAVE STUNTEDGROWTH?We don't have any idea what's going on with the doses per se. But what I amtelling you right now is that this is natural, but increasing levels of ultravioletradiation.MEANING FROM THE THINNING OF THE OZONE LAYER YOU AREFINDING THESE EFFECTS?Right. We are not enhancing it at all. It's natural sunlight. So, let me give you ascenario and then we'll get to that ozone hole.Let's say you are in a forest area and you're living in the tropics or in the Pacific"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Northwest and you chop down a little bit of forest and light comes in. Theseanimals will get hit with unnatural levels of ultraviolet radiation they are notused to because they lived in forests. Now, it may not kill them outright, but itmay effect their behavior and that is very important to know.Now, if something is occurring where there is an actual hole in the ozone like inPunta Arenas down in South America, then we have organisms that haveNEVER seen that kind of ultraviolet radiation throughout their entire lives. Andthis could cause severe damage. We all know that ultraviolet radiation can causeskin cancers, eye damage, can destroy immune systems, can effect crop plantsand so on. We've got a problem there.ANY SPECULATION ABOUT WHY AN AMPHIBIAN WOULD NOT BEABLE TO RECOGNIZE A NATURAL PREDATOR JUST BECAUSE OFINCREASED UV RADIATION EXPOSURE?It's not a recognition per se. What is going on - they may recognize it, but theydon't do anything about it. They are just not moving away. What I think is goingon is an endocrine problem. We think they are stressed, the amphibians areunder stress when ultraviolet rays hit the body and the endocrine system putsout stress hormones and they don't behave naturally.IN TERMS OF THE STUNTED GROWTH, DOES THAT MEAN THEREIS DAMAGE AT THE GENETIC LEVEL?We don't know about that, but there is definitely some damage developmentally.We have shown and so have others that if you put these animals in high doses ofUV radiation, their growth will be stunted.But this (new research data) is unique in that these (UV increases) are naturallevels (from the sun), but that increase stunts their growth.WE HAD HEADLINES EVERYWHERE ABOUT DEFORMEDAMPHIBIANS ONLY THREE YEARS AGO, LAST YEAR, FOURYEARS AGO. THIS YEAR OF 2000 THERE HAVE NOT BEEN ASMANY HEADLINES AND I WONDERED ONE, IS IT THAT THEMEDIA IS NOT PAYING ATTENTION? WHAT IS THE CURRENTSTATUS?That's a good question. Deformed amphibians are still around in the samenumbers they were. They were three reasons why they could have beendeformed: one is a pesticide problem. One is an ultraviolet radiation problem.And one is a parasite. It's pretty convincing evidence now that it's a parasiteknown as a fluke or trematode that is causing the multiple leg and missing legdeformities in most of the cases. Not in all, but most of the cases.That does not mean it's a natural phenomenon. It means it's a natural thing that'scausing it. But there could be some ecological changes that have causedparasites to become more prevalent. And that's what we're looking into also. Soare other people. What we're thinking is that the amphibians affected byultraviolet radiation are not behaving normally, which can also help themincrease their parasite load. In other words, if they don't get away from theparasites sufficiently, then they may get more parasitism. Also, the endocrinesystem will be affected and the immune system will be affected and then theycan get parasites more easily also.DO YOU THINK THAT AMPHIBIANS ARE IN A GENERAL STEADYDECLINE AROUND THE WORLD NOW?Yeah, I think amphibians there are many populations of amphibians that aredeclining around the world. I don't know about a steady decline, but they aremissing from places where they used to be. This is an overall problem inbiodiversity. We're loosing species at unprecedented rates. Some of the estimates"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"for species loss that I've seen range from 50,000 to 100,000 species being lostper year! That's a lot. So they are being hit by a lot of things. All organisms onthis planet have to come to grips with these environmental changes which aresignificant when you read about ozone holes over the first major city of theworld, Punta Arenas.THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THERE HAS BEEN SUCH A THINNINGOVER A CITY WITH A LARGE POPULATION?I think so. And I think the ultraviolet rays hitting that city are really high.ANY DOCUMENTED CHANGES IN ENZYME LEVELS IN HUMANSASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED UV RADIATION?Don't know about that.IF THERE WERE, WHAT KIND OF EFFECTS MIGHT WE SEE INHUMANS?I don't know what kind of changes we would see in humans except the skincancers, the immune system problems. When I first published my UV paper in1994 which is one of the first papers in our studies showing that amphibian eggsare dying from ultraviolet radiation, I got calls from a couple of physicians whostudy auto immune responses. They are interested because they knew that UVradiation hampers immune systems.
