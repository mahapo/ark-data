Pathologists confirmed an amoeba which invades marine animals whentheir immune systems are weakened was pervasive throughout the dead lobsters.But what weakened the creatures' immune systems?According to the Association's President, Nicholas Crismale, the terrible die offoccurred right after the massive spraying of the pesticide Malathion to killmosquitoes in New York and Connecticut. That was after birds and peoplebecame ill and died from the Kunjin West Nile Fever Virus. At first, both NewYork and Connecticut officials said pesticides had been ruled out because notenough pesticide was sprayed to accumulate in any strength in the Long IslandSound waters. However, the lobstermen have since learned there was nopesticide testing. So, now they are using their own money for independent testson the lobsters. Malathion is metabolized in animals to another toxin calledmaloxon which is harmful to marine life. The lobstermen also learned there wasenough wind during the helicopter spraying to carry Malathion over the LongIsland Sound waters.Interview:Nick Crismale, President, Connecticut Commercial Lobstermen'sAssociation, Guilford, Connecticut: \"And some of the reports I've been gettingfrom Rep. Ackerman in New York who is concerned about the way the sprayingwas handled and the doses and the breakdowns into metabolites, we becameconcerned.Has anybody discussed what they might do to control the malathionspraying if in factg there is a link to the lobster die off?I would think if there is a link to the lobster die off that our government wouldbe a little reserved in using the spray. I mean, at this point here, they can't tell usit isn't the spray. They can't tell us it is the spray. They really can't they haven'ttold us anything! And that's concerning to us as an industry. We don't know. I"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"would say if it's the spray I think at this point, the lobstermen in the industrywould like to see it stopped. If we feel that is directly the smoking gun here, wewould do as much as we could to stop it.I think there are alternatives to the spraying of Malathion and after researchingand reading about it, I'm a little concerned about the spray and the effect itwould have on people and the environment. People first and then theenvironment. I was a little concerned that the people that were hurt it is a healthconcern I think our government has to take some issues here and really assesswhat they are spraying. And if they are going to spray it (then) deem it'snecessary to oversee the whole spraying operation.The thing that concerns me more than anything is that everyone seems to beconcerned on the lobsters and the lobsters are dying. But the other creatures,the other fish and crabs and so on that live on the bottom are also dying. Seaurchins and so on.So everything is affected?Well, everything seems to be affected, yes. Whatever is causing this, it seems tobe affecting the environment in the Long Island Sound, the eco system in theLong Island Sound. We saw massive die offs down toward the western end ofthe Sound. I mean, to the point where we were losing 80% to nearly 100% ofthe lobsters. They were dying. The balance were extremely lethargic andeventually died.Is that why you were quoted as saying that you lost a four to five year stockon lobsters?Yes, it is.Can you explain to the lay person what that means?Traditionally in the course of a season, we go out and trap the lobsters. We arevery discriminating fishermen in that we put bait in the trap and put the trapdown. We provide food for the lobsters and we provide them a place to seekshelter from predators and so on. And what happens is that we pull up the traps.We take the ones that are legal. We have a gauge size and we take the ones thatare legal and the immature lobsters and the females we let go to propagate thestock. And those lobsters were lost.Now, the original estimate was approximately 100,000 lobsters. And when youtake into consideration that approximately ten million pounds of lobsters arecaught in the (Long Island) Sound annually and then you multiply that by a 5 or6 year stock and that's approximately how long it takes a lobster to reach legalsize.We approximate that 40 to 50 million pounds of lobsters (died off).Does that mean there won't be lobsters to catch in the next four to fiveyears in the Norwalk to Long Island area?What it means is we don't know yet. We have seen a few lobsters. Not enough tomake it economically feasible to trap them, but we don't know. And they arestill in a very lethargic and sickly state, so what we've been told from the sciencethat's been done so far is that they are infected with this amoebae - it's somethingsimilar to a virus, a flu bug that somebody might get when your immune systemsbreak down. This opportunistic bug that's in the water gets into their systemsand eventually kills them.What is it that destroyed their immune system?That's what we're concerned about. Initially we weren't getting too manyanswers from our local, state government. So we solicited help from a biologistat the Lobster Institute in Maine. He came down at our expense. He spent"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"approximately ten days here and dove on different sites and he accumulatedblood samples and dissected weak lobsters to assess it. And at that point, heindicated that the stock - which is pretty native to Long Island Sound - wasinfected and he was extremely concerned. They are going to die.That they are all going to die?That eventually all. What happens is the disease is transferable, unfortunately.And we're obligated to let the weak lobsters and the female lobsters go. Soconsequently, if they have the bacteria or virus and they die, the healthy oneswill eat them and they eventually become infected.We had by-passed the idea about the pesticide, which was our original idea,because our state government told us it was not pesticide. It's the Department ofEnvironmental Protection in Connecticut and DEC in New York.They had ruledthat out and they had ruled out any pollution. That's all been in the newspapers.So, naturally we figured that they had assessed that and tested for it, only to findout that they had not tested for it and we as concerned fishermen said, 'Well, Iguess we have to take the next step.'You had specifically asked them before that ruling about the spraying withmalathion to kill mosquitoes because of the West Nile Virus Feveroutbreak?Yes, and the initial response was that they ruled it out because of the dilutionfactor.They said there would be too much dilution of the sprayed pesticide in thewater they would be spraying over in planes?That's correct.What happened after the political denials of a link between the lobster dieoff and the malathion spraying?Well at that point, no one was giving us any answers as to what to do. We hadbusinesses and families and being lobstermen, our business is closely related toour personal lives. A lot of our expenses are based on funding from our homes,equity and we had to find out what was going on.You were quoted in the Daily News as saying, 'This is a catastrophe.'At this point in time, Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro from Connecticut wasreading the articles and we explained to her that there were no lobsters. And sosome of the Congress people and representatives went out on boats and visuallyseen for themselves what was coming up in the traps. And there was nothingcoming up in the traps. The few that were there were lethargic or dead!And at this point, she stepped in and encouraged Gov. (John) Rowland to call ita catastrophe. And he has. And we've spoken with Secretary of Commerce Dalyin Washington, D. C. who is investigating it. And I think this week, we'll behearing something.Has the biologist at the Maine Lobster Institute been able to confirm thepresence of the malathion breakdown into the toxin which can destry theimmune systems of marine animals like lobsters?At the meeting on Thursday (January 20, 2000), we also found out that Dr.French - a pathologist from the Univ. of Connecticut - is going after a federalgrant of some kind to test the lobsters for metals or pesticides. But we haven'theard anything yet. He along with his associates and staff at UCON were alsodoing tests and they were dissecting the lobsters. And they had also found thedisease bug. Dr. French and his associates were doing this pretty much on theirown time or a little bit of funding from UCON, not supported by the state at all."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"When will you know as fishermen what the impact is on lobsters coming upinto the summer of 2000?We won't know until late June or early July.By then, what are you expecting based on what happened this fall?I don't know. I'm very skeptical of the season. I don't know what to do at thispoint. We're going to set our traps and see what happens. We can only hope thatwhatever affected the lobsters in the western end of the sound, maybe some ofthem were able to escape and move to the eastern end. The ones that hadn'tshed, maybe there will be some lobsters left. I can't really assess that right now. Ireally don't know.There was just too much of a die off too quickly. I mean it was just a massive dieoff and something affected them very quickly.It was the same time, wasn't it, of the malathion spraying for West NileFever Virus?Yes, it was. After talking with Dr. French, we found out that the paramoeba hasattacked the nervous system. And from some research and information about themalathion, it is a nerve attacker. We either want to say it's the spray that affectedit. Or it's not the spray and then we can go on to the next step whatever thatmight be. But we have to find out.How big is the area affected in this lobster die off?It goes from Branford, Connecticut to City Island in New York. It encompassesthe whole body of water there from north to south shore. Both shores.If you take Long Island Sound, Branford is at the widest part of the Sound. It'sapproximately 18 miles across. Then as you go west towards NYC, it narrowsdown to about 3 miles across. When you go east of Branford toward the ocean,it again narrows until it comes to New London.Pretty much, it's a contained body of water. And unfortunately, whateverhappened here isn't flushing itself out. If there's something in the water, it's notable to flush itself out. We were told to believe that the dilution factor wouldnever have allowed this to happen. But after hearing the amounts and volumethat was sprayed and how it was handled, I guess there is a possibility. We're nottoxicologists. But when it's put in laymen's terms, it's difficult not to wonder.There might be a connection because iimmediately after the spraying iswhen you found all the dead lobsters and crabs?That was the period when there was a massive amount of kill.It sounds as if the representatives at the state level and in Congress arereally depending upon you lobsermen to come with the facts.That's the way it seems to us. We want to get to the bottom of this. This is ourindustry, our livelihoods. We have second and third generation fishermen outhere. They've been fishing all their lives. They don't know anything else to do.What happens to the whole lobster industry?We don't know. And that's where right now Congresswoman DeLauro - she hasstepped in and said, 'These guys need some help until we find out.' The state istrying to get a state grant to assess this thing in February or March. But thisthing happened back in September and October. We can't wait for February andMarch!"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"It's almost as if you lobstermen had not pushed to find out what waswrong, the political leaders and environmental agencies in New York andConnecticut weren't going to do anything?That's a pretty astute assessment. After talking about the Malathion breakdownsand the mishandling of them, I am concerned. People have to be accountable. InConnecticut, I think it was sprayed on land, but in the information I got, it wassprayed in the air in New York City. And it was considerable spraying byhelicopters and it was a disregard for the warning labels for spraying near thewater or the watershed. And that's what I'm a little concerned about. There wasa 6 mile wind drift involved. All these things we found out - people see a bugand say 'Come on and spray and kill the bug.' But they don't understand thatwhat's being sprayed or the eventual hazards in respiratory problems and thingsthat could emerge from that spraying.There's a lot of concern and a lot of people are watching to see what's happeninghere. And a lot of people want to find out what's killing all these lobstersbecause if it happened here, it could happen elsewhere.\"More Information:In late September, more than 1,000 fish did turn up dead at Clove Lake inStaten Island and hundreds more two weeks later in Willowbrook Lake - allonly a few days after the area was sprayed to kill mosquitoes to control furtheroutbreaks of West Nile Fever Virus. The Lobstermen's Association is now payingfor independent lab analyses to look for malathion-related toxins in the lobsters.Results will be known in the next two weeks.Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
