Maccabee.June 21, 2000 Sabillasville, Maryland - Part 4 of the interview with Bruce S.Maccabee, Ph. D., Research Physicist at the Naval Surface Warfare Center(NSWC) in Dahlgren, Virginia begins with green fireballs, the FBI and theSoviet threat. On May 1, 2000, his book The UFO/FBI Connection wasreleased detailing his research since 1976 into FBI documents and knowledgeabout the UFO mystery. Interview:Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist, Naval Surface WarfareCenter (NSWC), Dahlgren, Virginia:Green Fireballs, the FBI and the Soviet Threat\"A green fireball phenomenon began in December of 1948 which was originallythought to be meteors or flares.METEOROLOGIST DR. LINCOLN LA PAZ WAS STUDYING THEM INNEW MEXICO.That's right. These were initially reported as green lights that would travel alonga horizontal trajectory for a period of several seconds over a distance and thensuddenly drop downward and disappear. And La Paz was one of the witnessesand there were dozens of sightings over a couple of months. The FBI gotinvolved with these green fireball sightings because the FBI was responsible forprotection of vital installations. 'Vital installations' was a code word for atomicresearch installations. Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, NewMexico where they designed atomic bombs, Sandia Labs near Kirtland AFB inAlbuquerque, New Mexico where they built the atomic bomb, and then KilleenBase at Fort Hood, Texas where they actually stored atomic bombs.The initial sightings of green fireballs were in the Albuquerque and Los Alamosareas. There were numerous green fireball sightings and the national securityagencies were worried. And Dr. Lincoln LaPaz gave them plenty of reason to"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"worry and this turned up in the FBI file. Dr. LaPaz had argue that these thingsfirst of all were NOT meteors. As far as he was concerned, there were nometeors that were that vivid grass green color, no meteors that had continuouslyflat trajectories and no meteors that concentrated on one small area of the earth.Green fireballs were not being seen other than in the southwestern U.S. A. Andlots of people saw them.He had triangulated some of these tracks and found that they were traveling liketen miles above the earth at a high speed. His belief was that these werefractional orbital bombs that had been launched in the morning in the SovietUnion when they could do optical tracking. They were coming over the polefrom the north and down towards the south, that's where most of the directionswere originally. And then decaying when they reached the end of theirtrajectory. And he argued that Soviet agents on the ground could be feedingback to their people in the Soviet Union where these things were burning out. Inother words, ranging on our atomic installations!Well, it wasn't just the security agencies that were handed the problem of whatto do about the questions: Is it a real Soviet threat? And what do we do about itin terms of the public opinion? What is the policy on these? The Air Force hadcontinually said that flying saucer sightings are not a threat. And here wassomething that Lincoln LaPaz was saying: 'This is a threat. It's not ours. This is athreat!'The FBI first heard about this in early 1949 and we know that Hoover wasdirectly aware of these sighting reports of the green fireballs. And Hoover, likeeverybody else, could read the newspapers and the Air Force would say, 'Well,these were meteors. Nothing to worry about.' But Hoover's people also knewthat these security agencies were not quite so blase about it and Lincoln La Paz'sopinion turned up in the FBI documents.One of my chapters in my book is called, 'An Unimpeachable Source' and it's achapter in which I speculate that Walter Winchell (the famous radiocommentator) was told by J. Edgar Hoover that these green fireballs were Sovietweapons. The reason I speculate that is on April 4, 1949 Winchell was on theradio and made a statement that the green fireballs were actually missiles fromthe Soviet Union. I think, basically he said 'flying saucers.' It was a term thatencompassed everything at the time. And one of the FBI agents wrote a letter toheadquarters asking, 'Shouldn't we interview Walter Winchell to find out wherehe got this information about flying saucers being Soviet weapons?'Hoover responded that there would be no interview of Walter Winchell. WhatWalter Winchell has said is substantially what the FBI was told by an Air ForceColonel several months before. So, what J. Edgar Hoover was saying to his FBIagent was that what Walter Winchell said on the radio was basically correct.I suspect that Hoover did not want Walter Winchell to be interviewed becauseHoover had been the source of information for Winchell and Hoover did notwant his agent to find out that Hoover was breaking security by telling Winchellstuff that the Air Force was keeping TOP SECRET. Hoover probably knew thatwhile the USAF on the one hand publicly dismissed the fireballs, on the otherhand it was secretly concerned. And I suspect that Hoover, seeing that the AirForce was not doing anything about it, may have felt that the only way to getsome action in regard to these things if they were really Soviet missiles was toput this out in the open where the Senators and Congressmen could start arguingabout it.What was the reaction? Immediately after this Walter Winchell statement, theAir Force pooh poohed the whole thing. And nothing was ever done.BUT THERE WAS NEVER ANY EVIDENCE THAT THESE WERESOVIET MISSILES, WAS THERE?"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"No. Nobody to this day, as far as I know, knows what those green fireballs were.Their characteristics changed over a couple of years and then they more or lessfaded out. But as a result of all those sightings, Project TWINKLE was set up.And I have published in my book, probably for the first time a document thatwas found in the BLUE BOOK file on a microfilm record relating to a sightingthat occurred during the Project TWINKLE time. It was a day time sighting, butnot of green fireballs. Objects that were flying and recorded on a theodolitecamera at White Sands Missile Test Range in New Mexico unidentified objectswere flying at 150,000 foot altitude and were about 30 feet in diameter. We hadnothing that could approach that altitude then. Even the high altitude balloonsonly went up to 100,000 feet. And of course, the balloons did not move fast.The unidentified objects moved very fast. Here is a document which I guess youcould say proves that UFOs are real!And yet, Project TWINKLE ignored it. I take special pains to beat on a guynamed Louis Elterman who was in atmospheric physics and who wrote the finalreport for Project TWINKLE. You could argue that he deliberately covered upthat information, or he did not know about it. He was a Project Director. Heshould have known about it, but he did not mention it. The sighting itself ismentioned in Ruppelt, but Ruppelt did not even say they had succeeded with atriangulation to get the height and size. So, anyway that's a document in my newbook that proves that UFOs are real.DID THE GREEN FIREBALL PHENOMENON TRIGGER ANYREACTION INSIDE THE CIA?There aren't any documents that indicate that. By the time the CIA got interestedagain in 1952, the fireballs had sort of faded into history. But I have said thatthe Air Force told one thing to the American people and some times they toldsomething different to the FBI. And that dichotomous situation is epitomized onJuly 29, 1952 which is the day that USAF General John A. Samford, the generalin charge of Air Force Intelligence, made a public statement at a pressconference. Why in the world would he do that? This was a press conferenceabout flying saucers. Why in the world would the Air Force Intelligence Generalhave a press conference about flying saucers? And to understand that, you haveto understand that in April 1952 there was the beginning of what was perhapsthe biggest UFO flap in the United States that had ever occurred.July 1952, UFOs Fly Over Washington, D. C.It was not only Washington, D. C. I'm talking about every state in the Union. Wenow know the Air Force collected only a fraction of the sightings. The Air Forceonly had two dozen sightings from the 1947 flap, but thanks to Project 1947 wenow know there were probably 3,000, something like that. During 1952, the AirForce collected several thousand reports in that one year. They believed 1500and some objects had been sighted, sometimes by more than one person so itmade for more than one report. In any event, the bulk of the sightings occurredfrom April through August 1952 and if you track the sightings per day or perweek, you find that they were increasing rapidly in late June and July, peakingin July on the 27th or 28th, I believe, when they had 50 reports in one day. Fora period of a month or more, they were getting ten or more reports per day.THOSE FIFTY WERE COMING FROM ONE AREA?Oh, no. These were from all over the place, including from all over the world.Many of them came through official channels such as military reports.DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING DURING THATTIME?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I can well imagine that the guys at Project BLUE BOOK were wonderingwhether World War III was going to begin? It really caught the interest of thepress when sightings occurred over the Washington, D. C. area on the 19th and20th of July and again, the following weekend.In each case, three radar sets in the Washington, D. C. area: 1) Andrews AFB, 2)National Airport and 3) Bolling AFB. All three had unexplained targets.Sometimes these targets appeared over the White House, but in restricted areas.And they actually ended up scrambling jets to find out what was going on.Civilian aircraft reported seeing strange lights and occasionally they could see anobject in the sky and a radar target in the same direction. There were a numberof what appeared to be correlated sightings.One of the most spectacular was when one of these jets that was scrambled camein on the second weekend this happened, July 26-27, and there is a report in theBLUE BOOK file indicating that when the pilot saw the object ahead of him, alight, and on radar they could see the airplane approaching this object. Thetarget on radar started to move at the same speed as the jet and then pulledaway. And the jet pilot reported to the radar people that whatever it was, it hada phenomenal acceleration or speed capability. So, they were seeing the samething, the pilot and radar. This did make it into the news.The Misleading Press Conference of Major General John SamfordThere were so many sightings that General Samford had been planning to give abriefing to another General on the flying saucer situation. And this briefingpaper had already been written. But it turned out that he did not end up briefingthat General. He ended up briefing the Washington press corps.On the morning of July 29th, 1952, an announcement went out that GeneralSamford would hold a press conference on the flying saucer situation in theafternoon about 4 o'clock. And the press did show up for that and it was thelongest press conference held to that point, 80 minutes. The Korean War, whichwas still going on after a couple of years, had been wiped off the front page byall the flying saucer sightings. If you were to look up almost any majornewspaper in any major city in the U. S. for that time frame, late July 1952, youwould be likely to find one or more flying saucer sightings reported in the paper.And of course, everybody reported on General Samford's press conferencewhere he said that the sightings over Washington, D. C. as far as he wasconcerned were probably caused by temperature inversions that affected theradar and that the sightings that people were reporting, as far as he could tell,were natural phenomena. He said the Air Force had investigated more than athousand sightings and the one thing that could be said about them was thatthey posed no threat to the United States. But that is NOT what he had told theFBI.WHICH IS A METAPHOR FOR THE PAST FIFTY YEARS.Yes. On that same day of his press conference, I suspect earlier in the day in latemorning or early afternoon, an FBI agent had gone to the headquarters of AirForce intelligence to find out what the heck was going on with all these flyingsaucers. And the agent spoke to a Navy man, oddly enough, who was apparentlyon duty for the Air Force intelligence. He was talking to a person who wasworking for General Samford. Presumably General Samford would be aware ofeverything this person who worked for him also knew. They were all working inthe same office.But what the FBI was told was that they had lots of sightings, most of themcould be explained, but 3% of the sightings could NOT be explained. That's notwhat General Samford told the American people. He said it was all naturalphenomenon. But more than that, this Navy man told the FBI that some AirForce officials were seriously considering interplanetary ships. And that is in the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"FBI file.Now, you can imagine if General Samford had said at the press conference, 'Oh,by the way, we are considering interplanetary ships,' that the press conferencewould have blown up right at that point. There would have been questions likewho knew what, when, where, why and all that sort of stuff. But that's not whathappened. The press conference and a few other comments from a few othergenerals in the succeeding days managed to calm everything down. The UFOflap ended. And like what has happened before and so many times since, thepress interest faded away and UFOs went back into oblivion.\"Next: FBI, USAF, the CIA and the UFO Cover-Up in Part 5, June 22, 2000.More Information:The UFO /FBI Connectionby Bruce S.
