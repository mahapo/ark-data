Navy Research Physicist BruceMaccabee is the author of a new and important book released May 1, 2000entitled The UFO/FBI Connection, The Secret History of the Government'sCover-Up. He told me this week, \"We're learning more about what happenedyears ago then they knew years ago. And this book could not have been writtentwenty years ago or ten years ago because it involves information that has onlybeen recently released.\"Bruce Maccabee received his Bachelors of Science degree in Physics from"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Worcester Polytechnic Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1964. Threeyears later in 1967, he added a Masters of Science degree in Physics fromAmerican University (AU) in Washington, D. C. Then he earned his Ph.D. inPhysics from AU in 1970.He worked as a post-graduate student in AU's Physics Department until he washired by the U. S. Department of Navy to be a physics researcher at what wasthen called the Naval Ordnance Laboratory (NOL). That name was laterchanged to the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division (NSWCDD)where Dr. Maccabee has worked ever since. NSWC used to be closer to thenation's capitol, but in recent years has moved about seventy miles southeast toDahlgren, Virginia.Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist,U. S. Naval Surface Warfare Center, Dahlgren Division, Virginia,speaking at a recent conference. Photo provided by Bruce Maccabee.In this Part I of a five part series, I talk with him about his physics work for theNavy from 1972 to the present and whether any official work involved theunidentified flying object mystery.Bruce S. Maccabee, Ph.D., Research Physicist, Naval Surface WarfareCenter (NSWC), Dahlgren, Virginia: \"When I first started working forNSWC, I was doing rapid processing of acoustic data by optical means. By theway, Naval Ordnance Laboratory was changed to Naval Surface WeaponsCenter and then to the Naval Surface Warfare Center. They were all in the samebuilding.WOULD YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF RAPID PROCESSING OFACOUSTICAL DATA BY OPTICAL MEANS?Acoustical data specifically were tape recording of underwater sounds obtainedfrom the so-called SOSUS Arrays that were in the ocean listening forsubmarines and listening, of course, to other ships. Back in those days, people"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"sat there with earphones on and listened to these tapes being played. The bestthey could do was about twice normal speed. And you have to understand, therewere dozens of tapes made every day from various places and (intelligence) wassupposed to digest all this information and pick out which sound was like asubmarine and which sounded like a Soviet trawler as opposed to anything elsethat might be making noises in the oceans. And apparently the guys got veryaccustomed to doing that, but it was very slow.So, I was asked to see if I could come up with a speeded up method to do it andI made use of a method whereby the acoustical signals could be converted intoan optical signal. You can see a lot faster than you can hear. So, the idea was totry to paint a picture of the sound and to run this at maybe ten times normaltime. I succeeded in doing something like that, but then the funding was cut.And subsequently, monster computer stuff became available. Back in 1972,computers were few and far between. But over the next few years, they began toanalyze these tapes by computer techniques which were faster than humanbeings. So, they didn't need my method.BUT THE CONTEXT IS IN A GOVERNMENT OPERATION LOOKINGFOR WHAT WAS UNDER THE OCEANS IN TERMS OF POSSIBLEENEMY THAT THIS IS WHERE YOU GOT YOUR START IN OPTICALANALYSES?Right. Specifically for the super-scientist in the reading and listening audience,listening to an acoustic sound, you hear the frequencies that are characteristic ofwhatever the sound generator is. In this case, it would be like engine noise, 100Hertz or something like that. These noises would be very faint generally andwould be competing with all sorts of noises, such as biologically created noisesin the ocean. So, the attempt was to do what we call a Fourier transform andlook at the frequency spectrum of the total noises coming out and pick outcontinuous engine-generated sounds by its frequencies. And it was possible toconvert this spectrum to an optical picture, in effect, a picture of the spectrumand sit there and play this optical analog of the sound and see the spectrum goby you ten times faster than you could hear it.AFTER THAT FUNDING WAS CUT, WHAT WAS THE NEXT STEP INYOUR WORK?High Energy Laser ResearchThen, I went into the generation of underwater sound using lasers. I started thatin 1973 or 1974 and more or less continued that into the 1990s working onvarious aspects of that. I also got involved with the high energy laser program forthe Navy in 1976, I believe it was, when I became involved with a program thathad to do with the creation and utilization of a big instrument to analyze thelaser output of a laser that was generating hundreds of kilowatts of power.WHERE WAS THAT?It was west of West Palm Beach at a Pratt-Whitney installation.WHAT WAS ITS PURPOSE?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"That laser was a test laser. The purpose of most of these lasers is to learn thebasic physics involved. Of course, the 3-Stars and 4-Stars up the chain ofcommand had a twinkle in their eye that they could use these things to shootdown whatever. The laser that has a power level of hundreds of kilowattspresumably can be focused to a reasonably small spot and burn a hole throughalmost anything. And so, the purpose of this laser was to do research, but theresearch was directed towards using lasers as weapons.As a result of my involvement in that program which was at the Pratt-Whitneyfacility at West Palm Beach, Florida, I became involved with a follow on highenergy laser program that took place in California near San Juan Capistrano atthe TRW test site there where they had a famous laser back in those days calleda NACL, which happens to be the formula for salt, but it stood for Navy ARPAChemical Laser. ARPA was the Advanced Research Projects Administration thatlater became DARPA, Defense Advanced Research Projects Administration.Back in those days, it was ARPA.The Navy was big into high energy lasers in those days thinking they could uselasers to protect ships. The Navy was instrumental in building the world's largestlaser called MIRACL, Mid Infra Red Chemical Laser. That laser wasconstructed and utilized first at the San Juan Capistrano test area which isactually like several miles east of San Clemente. You could actually see the flagpole on top of Nixon's compound. And there were a number of times thatpeople thought about what the laser would do to the top of the flag pole!The first ever rocket devices, actually TOW missiles, that were shot down by alaser were shot down from the Capistrano test site in 1978 . During that testingperiod, I didn't happen to be there that specific day. I was trading off work withanother guy and he was out there it happened. That laser now is at White SandsMissile Proving Ground in New Mexico. And I should point out, this is aNavy-funded project to create a laser. So, where do they create the laser? Theyput it where it's best likely to work which is in DRY air. And so whenever theNavy decides to put lasers on ships of the desert, we will have it made.CAMELS OR OTHERWISE.Right.IN THIS EVOLUTION UP TO 1978, WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN1978 AND 2000 IN YOUR CAREER?It's been a long and checkered career. After 1978, high energy lasers for metemporarily died and I went back to laser zapping, creating under water sounds.And we had some funded programs.WHEN YOU SAY CREATING UNDERWATER SOUNDS, DO YOUMEAN YOU WERE USING THE LASERS TO CREATE SOUNDS?Right. For example, the laser is in an airplane flying over the water. You focus avery sharp laser beam down onto the surface of the water. It's absorbed by thewater and there is so much energy in the laser beam that the water literallyexplodes like you dropped a little explosion on the surface. The sound goes"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"down into the water and propagates some distance under water. Ourexperiments were directly designed to find out what was the best way togenerate that sound and how far it would go.A Call from the CIAOddly enough, it was in 1984, I got a phone call from the Central IntelligenceAgency (CIA), Ron Pandolfi, asking me about the laser-generated sound. Hewas a scientist, graduated from Cal Tech, had been at the CIA for a couple ofyears and had noted there was a huge disparity between the amount of paperspublished on the subject in the United States compared to the number of papersin the Soviet Union. So, it looked to him like there was a laser-zapping gap.That is, it appeared to him that the Soviets knew more about creatingunderwater sound with lasers than we did.WHO WAS PUBLISHING THE MOST?The Soviets had us outnumbered two to three to one in terms of the number ofpapers on the subject of creation of under water sound with lasers. And Pandolfiknew from his intelligence experience, that what appeared in the open literatureis only a fraction of what appears in the closed literature. So, he wanted to findout what we knew and some how determined that I and another guy at NSWChad the United States' main source of information on actual sound created underwater and were the only people testing it out in the ocean.WHAT WOULD BE THE CONCERN TO THE CIA?Under water sound is always of a concern because it can be used for variousthings like signaling and for under water detection. And in particular, we hadproposed that if you had sono buoys, which are devices that detect sounds in theoceans, if you had a sono buoy array with several of them located a couple ofmiles apart. Then you fly over the area with a laser generating sound and youlisten for any echoes. You can distinguish direct sound from an echo. And anyechoes would be detecting something that was under there and you can imaginewhat we were trying to detect. It wasn't whales, it wasn't sharks.SOVIET SUBMARINES.Yes, and the nasty ones. So-called nukes, the 'boomers,' as they called them. Sothis was a potential method for ASW, Anti-Submarine Warfare. Nowadays,nobody cares. Soviet subs are sort of turning into piles of rust. I suppose theSOSUS array is still out there listening, but I don't know who is listening to thetapes.BUT BACK THEN IT WAS OF GREAT INTEREST TO THE NAVY ANDCIA...Well, the Navy was interested because their job is to protect us from attack inthe oceans and the CIA interest was that they wanted to make sure that we knewat least as much as the Soviets did, so they contacted us to find out what weknew."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"THAT WAS 1984.That's significant from the UFO point of view simply because this is how I gotconnected with Pandolfi in the CIA. My first contact had nothing to do withUFOs.New Zealand UFO on December 31, 1978However, part of my history is that at the end of December 1978 were the NewZealand sightings that I investigated as a private citizen in January 1979. And aspart of my talking to a number of people throughout the U. S. about the data Icollected that I was invited to give a talk to the CIA. And at that point, I met aguy by the name of Kit Green, Christopher Green, whose name has popped upover the years in Ufology. I went to the CIA once to give this long talk about thesubject to see if they could help. And maybe twice more to talk with individualsto talk about radar and other aspects of that particular New Zealand sighting.That was in 1979.\" Background on the 1978-1979 New Zealand and Australia UFO FlapsHowe: Prior to New Year's Day 1979, a number of radar sightings had occurredfor two weeks off the northeast coast of New Zealand's South Island. One of thefirst major radar/visual sightings began on December 21, 1978. At about 12:30AM, air traffic controllers at Wellington Airport detected three unidentifiedtargets on their radar screens. One object moving at high speed for sixty mileswas estimated to be as large as a commercial airliner. Then it stopped andremained stationary.A pilot in the area was asked to look and reported at 1:20 AM, Captain VernPowell radioed that he could see white lights similar to landing lights thatappeared as targets on the airplane's weather radar. Then a couple of hours laterat 3:30 AM, the pilot radioed that a bright red light was visible. Wellington airtraffic controllers confirmed that their radar showed a target about 23 miles tothe right of Vern Powell's plane. Air control watched as the target paced Powellfor about twelve miles. Then Powell reported that the red light had changed towhite with a red ring around it. The light was extremely bright, so bright thatPowell said when the object passed behind clouds he could still see its glow.By then, Wellington radar operators said they had five strong targets near thepilot as he approached Christchurch. Powell radioed that his weather radarshowed a target approaching his plane at high speed, travelling fifteen miles infive seconds. Then the blip disappeared off his radar screen, but he could lookout his window and see a flashing white light.Ten days later on December 30, 1978, Quentin Fogarty, a reporter for AustralianTelevision Channel 0 and a cameraman were working on a news story about theUFO and radar sightings. It was 10:15 PM and the television crew was aboard anArgosy plane with Captain Bill Startup and copilot Robert Guard for thepurpose of reconstructing Powell's flight. They were flying south of Wellingtonwhen the flight crew noticed unusual lights near the Kaikoura peninsula. Aftermidnight on December 31, 1978, Wellington radar controllers confirmed they"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"were picking up strong unidentified returns in the area of the Argosy plane.During the next hour, the television team and the flight crew watched aspectacular and sometimes frightening display by the unidentified lights.Wellington radar said there as many as ten targets at a time and at least two. Thepassengers and crew were a bit worried because they were familiar with theOctober 21, 1978 disappearance only two months before of pilot FrederickValentich who was flying between Tasmania and Australia in his small Cessna182. The last words that Melbourne Flight Service Controllers heard fromValentich was, \"It has four bright lights that appear to be landing lights. Aircrafthas just passed over me about 1,000 feet above.\"Controllers asked him to identify the object. Valentich said, \"It's .....\" Then therewas silence. Two minutes later, Valentich's voice said, \"Melbourne, it'sapproaching from due east toward me. It seems to be playing some sort of game.Flying at a speed I cannot estimate. It is flying past. It is a long shape. I cannotidentify more than that. Coming for me right now. It seems to be stationary. I'morbiting and the thing is orbiting on top of me also. It has a green light and sortof metallic light on the outside.\" Then Valentich said his engine was choking up.What Melbourne Flight Controllers heard next was a metallic sound that J.Allen Hynek, who heard the audiotape, told me reminded him of \"tin cansrolling around in the bottom of an empty oil drum.\" Valentich never returnedand is still classified as a genuinely mysterious missing person's case.Further information on the New Zealand radar-visual sightings can be found atthe web site of the Journal of Scientific Explorationwww.jse.com/article.html. Select the article entitled \"Atmosphere or UFOs: AResponse to the 1997 Review Panel Report.\" The final two-thirds of that paperdescribe the analysis of the New Zealand radar sightings.Ron Pandolfi, CIA, Contacted Bruce MaccabeeBruce Maccabee: \"When Pandolfi contacted me in 1984, I didn't say anythingabout the fact I had been in New Zealand on the UFO investigation in 1979. Butthe next time he called me up, he said, 'By the way, I understand you do someother research, too.' Or words to that effect. And he brought up the subject ofUFOs because he had been asking around to people to see if they had heard ofme. And somebody said something.Anyway, in March of 1983, President Ronald Reagan made his speech about anorbiting, protecting against nuclear strikes, that came to be called 'Star Wars.'The press disparaged the idea and sort of tried to make it look like Hollywoodentertainment, but it wasn't.Special panels got together to try to figure out how they would put togetherwhat's called an architecture or structure of weapons that could actually handlethe ballistic missile threat from the Soviet Union.In 1984, I was on a panel, a little group of people from the Naval SurfaceWarfare Center. We went traveling around to various military bases to find outwhat other people were doing about space. What's the Navy got to do withspace? It just so happened that the Navy was the biggest users of space assets."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"People wouldn't think of the Navy being interested in what happens up abovethe atmosphere, but the Navy had satellites up. In fact, the first satellites up inthe 1950s were sponsored by the Navy. And one reason was geodesy, to find outexactly how the earth is. The cryptic reason for the interest in geodesy was thatwe had to be able to determine if a nuclear submarine was going to fire a missile,how in the world do you tell that missile where to go? It has to know exactlywhere it is on the earth to begin with. How much firing time and which certaindirection to run its rockets? After it fires, its rockets are gone. It's just a dumbthing coasting towards a target. So, you have to get all this stuff correct and theyhad to find out exactly how the gravity varied around the surface of the earth,anything about actual dimensions of the earth and so on.Star WarsThe Navy had a lot of satellites up there and they also had to havecommunication with ships. They used satellites for communication. And in1984, we were trying to find out what other people were doing in space, shouldthe Naval Surface Warfare Center in particular get involved. And that connectedme up with the government's Star Wars architecture study, I guess you could callit. For a period of time, I was working on various aspects of Star Wars. Havingbeen involved with that problem in 1985, that got me into another program in1986 which was directly related to big lasers in space. That program iscontinuing.UNDER WHAT NAME?First of all, under the Strategic Defense Initiative Office (SDIO), or StrategicDefense Initiative Organization which was the organization set up to develop thearchitecture of a weapons system that could handle a Soviet threat. This was nomean problem. The Soviet threat consisted of like 10,000 missiles that could allbe launched at once. If they really wanted to wipe out the United States. And sothis system was an attempt to shoot down all those missiles some how or other.It still hangs in there and you can still see the discussion in the papers even inthe last few days as to whether or not Clinton is going to make a decision aboutcontinuing what is known as the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization(BMDO). You can go to their web page and find out all the latest about shootingdown missiles. But instead of trying to shoot down 10,000 missiles, we nowhave an architecture that can shoot down maybe ten missiles. A big difference.We might actually be able to DO that, assuming that Congress appropriates themoney to put some satellites up there.IN ALL OF THIS, THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE PARALLELTRACK AND SUSPICION SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE REAGANADMINISTRATION AND THE DISCUSSION OF STAR WARS THAT ITNEVER HAD ANYTHING REALLY TO DO WITH THE SOVIETUNION, BUT THAT THERE WAS CONCERN ABOUT A NON-HUMANINTELLIGENCE INTERACTING WITH OUR PLANET.I can tell you from experience, and I would take lie detector tests on it and"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"swear on a stack of Bibles, a discussion of anything other than Soviet attacknever occurred during any of the talks, lectures, discussions, whatever that Iparticipated in. (Howe's note: In my research, it became clear that \"SovietUnion\" was used as a code phrase to mean any foreign technology that couldalso include non-human advanced technology.)WAS EDWARD TELLER IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS?I don't think I was ever in the same room with him. I might have been backduring the hay days of Star Wars in the 1986-1988 time frame. I went to anumber of meetings, so he might have been in some room. But I never heard himspeak and as I said, of all the people I did hear speak, including the guy who wasin charge of the SDIO, General Abrahamson. None of those people gave anyindication there was anything other than a Soviet threat.And when the details of the architecture were discussed, always the threatdiscussed was missiles in terms of shooting down something on the order of10,000 missiles. SS-18s, SS-16, SS-22, whatever numbers were attached to thedifferent types of missiles, the whole different array that the Soviet Union had.They had long range, short range, intermediate range, missiles launched fromsubmarines. That was always the threat discussed, missiles. And all of thesatellites, there were a bunch of satellites supposedly up there that would bemonitoring the earth. There ARE satellites up there monitoring the earth. Alltheir sensors are directed towards the earth. None of the sensors are directedaway. Astronomers and NASA have put up satellites with telescopes directedaway from the earth, but I'm not aware of any military satellites that are lookingaway from the earth. They are looking towards the earth to detect nuclearmissile launches or nuclear explosions, testing.HOW DID ALL OF THIS COME TO FOCUS ON THE UFOPHENOMENON?As I have said to many audiences, I happened to work for the Navy. My Navywork has nothing to do with UFOs which is true. I'm not saying that the Navydoes not have any UFO information. In fact, I suspect they are not Mr. Clean.But nobody has told me about anything! Navy intelligence is in a completelydifferent part of the organization.LET ME PUT IT IN THE CONTEXT OF YOUR NEW BOOK, THE UFOFBI CONNECTION, AND YOUR FOCUS IS GOVERNMENTKNOWLEDGE IN CERTAIN AGENCIES.As you know, I've been interested in the subject since the late 1960s and haveinvestigated a number of sightings and also have read a number of books, historyand direct files out of Project Blue Book.YOUR INTEREST WAS NOT PROVOKED BY YOUR PROFESSIONALWORK? IT WAS ALWAYS A PARALLEL TRACK OUT OF YOUR OWNCURIOSITY?"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Right. I became interested in 1967 or 1968 while I was at American University.WHAT TOOK YOU TO NEW ZEALAND TO STUDY THE UFOINCIDENT THERE?It was a fortuitous circumstance that I had done some photographic analysis forNICAP (National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena). When theNew Zealand movie was taken December 31, 1978 and was shown the next dayon TV around the world. Even Walter Chronkite had it and he said at the end ofhis nightly news, 'And that's the way it is. Or is it?' That was the only time heever added anything to his nightly news closing statement.The point is the TV station in Australia, the TV station that the reporter was anemployee of, we were told was on board the plane when they had all thesesightings. And they were accused of hoaxing this whole thing up to improvetheir ratings. It was called Channel Zero, or \"O\" in Melbourne, Australia, andthey were accused of trying to bring their ratings from a zero. Their ratingsmatched their Channel Number, we were told. Anyway, they decided to have aninvestigator. They contacted a guy named Paul Norman. Paul used to live in theU. S. and was a member of NICAP. He moved into Australia back in the 1960s,I think. He recommended that they take the film to the United States to NICAPheadquarters where they had the best analysts and equipment. I saw that filmshown on TV and J. Allen Hynek was commenting on it and I thought to myself,'Well, somebody on the other side of the earth gets to look at that. I won't.' So Ipromptly forgot about it. But six days later I got a phone call from Jack Acuffwho was the head of NICAP and he said, 'How would you like to see the NewZealand movie? They're bringing it here.'So maybe two weeks later I had it in my house. But how did I get down there?Well, after I did this preliminary investigation, the news team that brought thatfilm was here in the U. S. for a week, maybe two weeks. And I told them that bythat time I had talked to the captain and cameraman by phone and I told theAustralian newsman who brought the film, 'This looks really weird. It could be aUFO. But I'm not going to say anything publicly until I actually get to carry outan investigation.' So, they paid for a trip and I went down to Australia and NewZealand. I was gone for two weeks in New Zealand and a week in Australia andwhen I came back to the U. S., I stopped to discuss the case with scientists onthe west coast. Then I stopped in Chicago to tell Hynek what I had learned andfinally I discussed the case with scientists in the Washington, D. C. area. Thiswas all done while I was on leave from work.And there were some people who were interested after I came back. Some of thepeople in the Naval laser office where I worked knew I had taken this trip andasked me to tell them. In fact, I gave them a little briefing on it, but nothing everofficial involved. No money changed hands. There was no program set up. It wasjust a question of some guys who wanted to know what it was.\"Next: There really was an X-Files in the FBI, continued in Part 2 on June 19,2000."},{"pageNumber":11,"pageContent":"The UFO/FBI Connectionby Bruce S.
