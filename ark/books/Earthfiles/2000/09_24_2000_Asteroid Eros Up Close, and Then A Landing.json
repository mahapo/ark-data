Eros is 34 kilometers (21 miles) long, about11 kilometers (7 miles) wide and a hundred million miles from Earth in the asteroid beltbetween Earthand Mars. The butterscotch hue is typical of a wide variety of minerals thought to be majorcomponents of asteroids such as Eros which has very little metal.

The South Pole of Eros, which has been pointed awayfrom the sun until now, will be lighted and is the likely target area. There arealso many features on Eros that scientists would like to see more closely,including ridges, troughs, large boulders and craters that are square. Detailedsurvey data has been published inScience and one of the puzzles for geologistsand astronomers are many loose boulders laying around on the surface. Eros is arelatively small mass, so it was logical to expect a smoother surface from whichdebris would have been knocked off into space over its 4.5 billion yearevolution from the beginning of the solar system."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Photograph by NEAR on March 6, 2000 from about 200 kilometers (125 miles)that shows many very large boulders in the southwestern part of the saddle region.

Theresult is that the crater rims that run parallel to the fractures are straighter thancraters located in nonfractured areas.\" On Earth, Arizona's Barringer Meteorcrater is a similar example in which the rim is slightly squared off.If NEAR is lowered in October to the closest approach any human spacecrafthas ever come to an asteroid, the camera and satellite will take pictures withcomputer instructions designed by engineer Ann Harch at Cornell University inIthaca, New York.Interview:Ann Harch, Engineer and NEAR Mission Support Specialist, NEARProject, Cornell University Space Sciences, Ithaca, New York:\"HOW CLOSE TO EROS WILL THE NEAR SATELLITE GO?The closest we will be on this first low altitude flyover will be about 5kilometers and that means we will be able to see objects as small as about ameter across.HAVE WE EVER BEEN IN THIS CLOSE TO AN ASTEROID BEFORE?No, we've never been in this close. Before the NEAR spacecraft arrived at Eros,we had never been closer than about 1200 kilometers. We went into about 1000kilometer orbit last February 2000 and we have been progressively going lowerand lower. For about four or five months, we were in a 50 kilometer mappingorbit. And then just recently, we have gone up to 100 kilometers again to get amore global view of the south side of Eros which was not visible at the first partof the mission because the South Pole was pointing away from the sun when wefirst arrived.IT WAS IN DARKNESS?It was in perpetual darkness. We are in orbit around Eros as Eros is in orbitaround the Sun. And we've had to wait until this part of Eros's year in order tosee the south side."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The NEAR camera took this long view of the Eros southern hemisphere on September 6,2000as the South Pole region brightens with sunlight. Craters shown in the left foreground areabout1.3 kilometers (0.8 miles) across. Photographs from NEAR satellite courtesy ofJHU Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, Maryland.So, that's why we went up to the 100 kilometer orbit. It's from there we will bediving down. We will go into a 50 kilometer circular orbit briefly and then we'llgo down to the 5 kilometers.THAT'S IN OCTOBER.That's on October 25th.HOW LONG WILL IT ORBIT IN THAT FIVE KILOMETERALTITUDE?Not that long. I think the whole thing is going to take about a day. The time weare the closest is going to be five or six hours. Our sequence that we're focusingthe energy and activities, will run for five or six hours.WHY IS IT THAT YOU WILL KEEP IT DOWN AT 5 OR 6KILOMETERS FOR ONLY FIVE OR SIX HOURS?That kind of a close orbit is difficult to maintain.BECAUSE OF GRAVITATION?Right, we don't want to crash into the asteroid, essentially. (laughs) And sothey'll do a burn that will take us in and then several hours after the closestapproach time period, they'll do another burn that will take us out to a largerorbit right away so there is no chance we're going to crash into the surface.Another interesting thing I want to mention about going closer. The higherresolution, the finer the details that you can see, the more you are going tounderstand the nature of that rock material that makes up Eros. And one of themost interesting features on Eros are boulders. I don't know if you have seen anyof the pictures on the web, but Eros is covered with these various sizes ofboulders which represent material that has been excavated. When anotherasteroid impacts Eros, it creates big craters. The material is thrown out into thevicinity of the earth and ultimately lands on the surface again. So, theseboulders do represent the rock material that's on the inside of Eros. So, thecloser we can get, the finer detail we can see of these boulders, the more we canunderstand about the rock material and the structure of the material that makesup the inside of Eros."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"This is a composite of four images taken by the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft orbitingabout 100 kilometers(62 miles) above the asteroid, 433 Eros which shows some of the boulders and the heavilycratered surface.Photograph on September 22, 2000 from Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR)satellite courtesy ofThe Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, Maryland.There is one more piece of information we have gained. We have amagnetometer on board which would measure the presence of metallicmaterials. Some asteroids are very heavily concentrated with metallic material.We have not seen any magnetic fields. They have not detected the presence of amagnetic field from Eros which is a scientific result that says there is probablynot much metal inside of Eros.HOW WILL TRYING TO ANALYZE THE STRUCTURE OF EROS ORANY ASTEROID HELP US IN TERMS OF DEALING WITHASTEROIDS THAT MIGHT BE COMING TOWARDS THE EARTHCLOSE ENOUGH TO IMPACT. AND I'M THINKING IN TERMS OFSEPTEMBER 2000 IN WHICH THERE HAVE BEEN AT LEAST FIVESPACE ROCKS THAT HAVE FLOWN PAST THE EARTH SINCE THEFIRST OF SEPTEMBER AND A COUPLE OF THEM WERE NOTMORE THAN 12 TIMES THE DISTANCE TO THE MOON?NASA's Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking systemspotted this asteroid called 2000 QW7 on August 26, 2000when it suddenly appeared no farther away from Earththan twelve times the distance to the moon. Image courtesy of NASA and JPL.Large asteroid impacts with the earth occur very rarely. We're talking once every30 million years. But you never know when it's going to happen. It couldhappen any day. If it does happen, then it might be good to understand whatasteroids are made of, how the rock material - whether it's one solid piece, whatthe density is, how strong the material is. And some of the questions we cananswer with our orbital mission to Eros.Then for the remainder of the year, we will spend time in orbits that will beabout 35 kilometers or less from the center of Eros. Then in January andFebruary, we are going to start some unusual operations where we will do some"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"more of these low altitude passes. At the very end of the mission, we will gentlybring the spacecraft down to the surface taking pictures as we go and hopefullytry to lay the spacecraft down on the surface with the objective that if we can layit down in just the right way we might be able to keep transmitting data from thesurface to the earth of pictures while we're laying on the surface.THIS MEANS AN ACTUAL LANDING ON EROS IN FEBRUARY. ANDWOULD THE SPACECRAFT LEAVE EROS OR STAY THERE?I think if they could lift it off again that would be a fun thing to do! But it's notclear that's possible. This spacecraft was not designed as a lander, so it's going tobe tricky to land it intact.ARE YOU GOING TO BE BEHIND THE CONTROLS IN SOME WAYWHEN THEY START TRYING TO LAND THE SPACECRAFT ONEROS?My part of it will be to design the sequences that will tell the spacecraft howand when to take pictures. There will be other teams of people who are incharge of the thruster control, the maneuvers that will bring the spacecraft closeto the surface. We'll all be working together to build the sequences that willoperate the spacecraft during those last few hours.DO YOU HAVE YOURSELF ANY SENSE OF WHERE THE LANDINGSITE WILL BE ON THE ASTEROID AND WHAT THEENVIRONMENT, THE SURROUNDINGS, MIGHT BE?That is being worked out right now. We're going to have a series of meetings overthe next few months that will determine where the best place is to bring thespacecraft down. There are a lot of factors that will go into that. Some of thefactors are where is an area that will provide good viewing. You have toremember that Eros is spinning. It's a 35 kilometer-long object that is spinningonce every 5.3 hours. So, the place that we land is likely going to be somewherenear the South Pole because if you can imagine trying to land on the tip of thething as it's spinning once every 5.3 hours, there is too much movement to bringthe spacecraft in safely. So the place on the planet that is going to be the moststable is going to be somewhere near one of the poles. It will probably be theSouth Pole since that is the illuminated side at the time of the year we're goingto land.WHICH IS FEBRUARY 2001.Right.WHAT IS DOWN THERE THAT YOU KNOW NOW THAT WOULD BEINTERESTING TO TRY TO LAND CLOSE TO?With the way our camera optics work, they are designed as a remote sensinginstrument that is supposed to take pictures from a distance. So, there is aminimum distance we have. We can't take pictures like the little Pathfindercamera where you can see something a few meters away. We can only takepictures say that are a half a kilometer or so away. So, what we'll be looking aton the surface will be the horizon essentially. And as we're coming down, we'llbe looking at the part of Eros we'll be able to see. There are a lot of spacecraftconstraints when you do something like this.We get our electrical power from solar panels, so it's a big game of trying to keepthe solar panels on the sun, trying to keep the transmitters on the earth so wecan continue to send pictures back and there are a lot of these things. We can'tturn the camera and look straight down. We'll probably look to the side a littlebit whatever direction we're allowed to point the camera in that will allow us tosatisfy all those other engineering constraints at the same time.\""},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"We b s it e s :http://near.jhuapl.edu/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
