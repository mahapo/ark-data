New flu strains emerge every thirty to forty years on average. The lastmajor one was the Hong Kong flu in 1968, thirty-two years ago. So healthofficials are afraid the stage is set for another major influenza epidemic, orpandemic. The 1968 flu killed about 34,000 Americans.The most severe pandemic was the Spanish flu in 1918 that killed 620,000Americans and at least 20 million people worldwide. Virus specialists areconcerned about flu strains that now exist in birds, but not in humans.Thatmeans people have no resistance to those new influenza microbes. At theAtlanta meeting, virologists talked about two of those new bird flu viruses thatmight have jumped to a worldwide scale in 1997. That year, a virus spread fromHong Kong chickens to humans through poultry feces. Hong Kong's reactionwas to kill all the 1.4 million chickens in the city before the new virus spreadfurther among birds and people.At exactly the same week in Hong Kong, the A Sydney flu virus was confirmed.If that virus and the chicken virus had combined in one human to form a new flustrain, no one would have had immunity and the pandemic would have startedin 1997. Dr. Robert Webster, Chairman of Virology and Molecular Biology atSt. Jude Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee told the epidemiologists, \"We werevery l u cky t h en . It go t very cl o se.\"Since it can take half a year to develop new flu vaccines, medical researchers arenow trying to create against the dozen new influenza strains now in birds. But itcould take five more years. Are any of the local and state health facilities in theU. S. prepared to handle a huge population of sick people? Or the panic thatcould ensue if there is not enough medicine and staff to cope with a pandemiccrisis? Those questions were posed at the Atlanta meeting of epidemiologists."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Culex pipiens mosquito, one of the carriers of the West Nile Fever virusbetween birds, animal and humans.While those doctors are worried about a worldwide flu epidemic, other healthofficials from Israel to New Jersey, New York and Connecticut are worried aboutthe persistence of the West Nile virus that is transmitted by mosquitoes that biteinfected birds and pass the disease on to animals and humans. Three horses incentral and southern New Jersey have now joined the list of infected animalsthat have become so ill they have been euthanized to put them out of theirmisery. So far in New Jersey this year, 837 crows and a cockatiel have testedpositive for the West Nile virus - all in the northern counties near New York Citywhere there have been eleven cases of human infections in 2000.In Israel, eighty people have become ill with West Nile Fever virus and sevenhave died since the beginning of August, including a three-year-old child. Thedisease, long associated with the Middle East, Africa and Eastern Europe, hastraditionally had about a 23% mortality rate.New questions about the virus's ability to spread beyond the mosquito-birdconnection have now been raised. Until now, the West Nile virus was said tospread only by mosquitoes that bite infected birds. In September, the U.S.Center for Disease Control and Prevention announced the virus has been foundin cats, dogs and bats at the same time the Pasteur Institute in Paris, Franceannounced that it has confirmed isolation of the virus in horses. Researchersnow wonder if the West Nile viral load in some mammals is great enough formosquitoes to transfer the fever illness directly from sick mammals to humanswithout bird intermediaries.We b s it e s :http://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r2k0622a.htmhttp://www.jpost.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
