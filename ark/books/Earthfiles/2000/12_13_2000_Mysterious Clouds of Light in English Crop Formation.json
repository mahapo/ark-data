Researchers called it the \"Galaxy\" at West Stowell, alittle east of Alton BarnesInside Galaxy formation at West Stowell, Wiltshire after its discovery onJuly 23, 1994. Photograph © 1994 by Chad Deetken.\"As the two men entered at the southeastern corner of the field about 150meters from the Galaxy, a very large and bright light seemed to come from theground inside the crop formation and rise into the sky. Werner told Bert Janssenand Janet Ossebaard in their 1999 documentary Crop Circles, The Research, \"Itwas so bright, it lit up the hills in the background. It was bluish-white in colorand about as big as the formation, fifty to sixty meters wide. The bright lightformed some sort of cloud and it changed shape continuously as it hovered overthe formation. After a couple of seconds, it rose at slow speed and disappearedinto the darkness. My friend and I were totally flabbergasted!\"Drawing by Werner Anderhub for Linda Howe © 2000 with this note:\"The five sequences of the light encounters began all in the same way as a fluid light cameout of the Galaxy,forming a cloud above the field, stayed there for several seconds, moved slowly up into thesky,and then disintegrated into nothing visible.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"The 'cloud' disintegrated by moving up into the sky and lighted up the Vale of Pewsey.We could easily see the Golden Ball Hill with its bushes and sheep.Please note this was not a UFO. I have seen those. This was a totally different event.\"Drawing by Werner Anderhub for Linda Howe © 2000.\"As we stood in the dark night, a second light emerged from the formation,repeating exactly the same action and movement as the first one. And after abouta minute, there was a third light. And then a fourth light appeared. This fourthone did not just form a cloud. It formed a perfect rectangular shape, like a bigshoe box hovering only a few meters above the wheat and measuring five bytwenty by sixty meters. It was transparent like a jelly fish. And it didn't just hangthere. It started to float towards us. At that point, my friend began to get reallyscared and wanted to run away, but I asked him not to go. At that instant, thelight stopped. It floated back towards the formation where it transformed intoanother cloud and moved slowly up into the dark sky.\"After the fourth 'light cloud' was formed above the Galaxy formation, in an instant thatlight cloudbecame the form of a 'shoe box' hanging over the field for awhile. Then it moved slowly inour direction.\"Drawing by Werner Anderhub for Linda Howe © 2000.\"At that point, two other friends arrived and a fifth light emerged from theformation, forming another bright cloud that hovered for a couple of secondsafter which it moved upward and disappeared into the sky. We had witnessedsomething that could not be easily explained. What struck us most was thestrange rectangular box, how it approached us and then how it left when myfriend got really scared. It was as if the light were intelligent, or guided by anintelligence.\"More Information:"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"The above excerpt is from Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles - 1st Edition ©2000 and Updated 2nd Edition © 2002, expanded to 400 pages with morephotographs, including the Gog and Magog Hills and Chilbolton formations of2001.
