He was flying with two others on August 28, 2000 whenthey saw a second new wheat formation in Whitefish only about 600 feet fromthe first formation discovered in mid-August. Flying over that first formation,Mr. Johnson and watched his compass shift fifteen degrees while travelingstraight south to north, then shift another ten degrees flying north to south. Sohe tried the compass over this new formation.Interview:Gilbert Johnson, pilot since 1957, runs charter service and flight school,Kalispell, Montana: \"The first time that I know that anyone saw this formationis when a photographer gave me a call on August 28th. It's about 600 feet south"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"of the first one. We circled it for about fifteen minutes and then we took aheading to the north and I made a 180 and came back and checked he compassfor any anomaly over the crop circle. I got a ten degree anomaly. And then whenwe turned around after about a quarter mile or so and headed back over thesame area, I got another ten degree anomaly over the crop circle.THAT'S REALLY QUITE SIMILAR TO THE FIRST ONE WHERE YOUGOT THE FIFTEEN DEGREE ANOMALY GOING SOUTH TO NORTHAND THE TEN DEGREE SHIFT GOING NORTH TO SOUTH.Right. I had two other photographers with me. They were watching the compassand I was watching the airplane so I wouldn't deviate or cause any banking.You're not supposed to increase or decrease your speed. I tried to keepeverything steady and did a pretty good job. And they both shouted at the sametime, \"There's ten degrees shift!\"ANY SIGNS OF ENTRY OR EXIT FROM THE FORMATION?From the air, we didn't see any entries anywhere. I don't know how anyonecould do ever do that. They levitated if they did.BECAUSE IT WAS JUST CLEANLY LAID DOWN IN THE DRYWHEAT?Yeah, it was pushed down in a counter-clockwise direction the same as the otherone (August 14).THERE ARE NO TRAMLINES IN THOSE FIELDS?No, nothing. Nobody knows the answer.\"Melody Watts, Owner, Midway Mini Mart, Whitefish, Montana:\"This new one is in the same field, same farmer who had the first one this yearand one in 1998 across the street. He owns more than 500 acres of wheat. Icalled the pilot to make reservations to fly over it to take pictures and the pilothad already flown over and had beautiful pictures of when there were no trailsin or out. You could not see a trail anywhere.MELODY, HOW UNUSUAL WOULD THAT BE AT THIS POINT ATTHE END OF AUGUST WITH THE WHEAT AND SOIL AS DRY ASTHEY ARE?There is no way you could wear stilts to get in there! It was cracked. Youcouldn't even walk through it without breaking anything. It hasn't rained in overthree weeks. There is no way anybody could walk in there to make thisformation.THAT'S WHAT THE PILOT SAID. HE WAS AMAZED THAT THEYWERE FLYING AT 500 FEET AND COULDN'T SEE ANY SIGNS OFANY ENTRY OR EXIT. SINCE YOU'VE NOW BEEN IN ONE LASTYEAR AND THE TWO THIS YEAR, WHAT ON THE GROUND AREYOU LOOKING AT?It's just gorgeous. And unless you're in a real high pick up truck, you can't reallyeven see it from the road. So, even the farmer hadn't noticed it. And once youstep on this wheat that's so dry - more than a month with all the fires - and onceyou step on it, you make a trail through there. Everything just cracks. A personcould not walk through there without making a trail. It's just amazing.THIS IS ONE OF THOSE FORMATIONS IN WHICH THE ONLY"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"LOGIC TO HOW IT WAS MADE WAS FROM SOMETHING UPABOVE OR BELOW GROUND?I couldn't imagine. Even if you had stilts, you couldn't get in there withoutmaking some type of mark.AFTER WALKING THROUGH THE VERY DRY WHEAT AND SOIL,WHAT WERE SEEING WHEN YOU FINALLY GOT TO THEFORMATION ITSELF?There was a perfectly round circle. It's laying in a clockwise direction. Then youwalk just a little further and you find another huge circle. The wheat is just laiddown perfectly. There are no faults anywhere, as you can see in the pictures.Melody Watts pointing camera down long corridor in pictogramdiscovered by pilots on August 27-28 in wheat on same farm as first formationdiscovered August 14th about 600 feet away. See Earthfiles August 27th.Photograph © 2000 by Melody Watts.I THINK YOU MEAN ARCS BECAUSE THERE ARE ARCS ATEITHER END OF THAT LONG CORRIDOR. AND THERE IS ONLYTHAT ONE CIRCULAR RING IN THE MIDDLE.Yes, and the arcs and circle are all going in a clockwise direction.EVERYTHING IN THIS ONE IS LAID DOWN IN A CLOCKWISEDIRECTION?Yes, it is. Opposite of the first one laid down all counter-clockwise.WHAT DID YOU NOTICE IN TERMS OF THE DRY WHEAT WHEREIT WAS LAID DOWN TO THE GROUND?Well, it didn't look like it was walked on at all. It didn't look broken. It's justflattened. The wheat stems, when I walked on it, they break. So, where it wasn'twalked on, I pulled up samples and they were just bent over. So that's kind ofunusual.MEANING THAT THEY WERE BENT DOWN TO THE GROUND, BUTTHEY WERE NOT BROKEN?Righ t . Amazin g.WHEN YOU LOOKED WHERE YOU HAD WALKED INTO THEWHEAT FIELD UP TO THE FORMATION, WAS EVERY STEP IN THEWHEAT BROKEN OFF?Yes, there was no way to get in and out of there without breaking it. It's been so"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"dry.COULD YOU SEE ANYTHING IN THE SOIL? GILBERT JOHNSON,THE PILOT, SAID THE SOIL IS JUST POWDER DUST. DID YOULOOK FOR ANY SIGNS OF TRACKS OR MACHINERY ORANYTHING IN THERE?There were no footsteps. And actually, when I walked through there, the dustwould fly up and I could see where I had walked. But before I walked on it,there were no footprints anywhere. I don't know about the meaning, but there'ssomething out there trying to tell us something.And it's so close to the airport, it seems like somebody might have reported itfrom there. But, no. Also, the fires are going on and the Forest Service has hadhelicopters within a mile of there going up all day long and nobody has saidanything. I'm sure they've seen it.IS THERE ANYTHING ABOUT THE WHEAT ITSELF IN TERMS OFTHE GROWTH NODES OR STEMS OR SOIL YOU NOTICED THATWAS UNUSUAL?Nancy Talbott has been trying to educate me a little on the nodes. And when Ilooked at it, it seems that where it's bent over the nodes are expanded. To me, asI look at it. I will have to send the samples to BLT Research to let them look atthem and confirm anything. It does look a little odd compare to the controlsamples.THEY ARE LARGER?Yes, much larger. And there are some small blackened holes around the edge,around the nodes of the first joint coming out of the ground.THAT'S WHERE THEY NORMALLY ARE. IF THERE HAS BEEN ANINTERACTION WITH THIS ENERGY THAT DR. LEVENGOODHYPOTHESIZES IS INVOLVED WHERE THERE USUALLY AREEXPULSION NODES IS USUALLY ON THE NODE CLOSEST TO THEGROUND OR THE ONE ABOVE IT.Yeah. I can't believe this is happening and nobody really cares. It's too bad.Something is trying to tell us something and we're not even listening.\"We b s it e s :http://www.cropcircleresearch.com/http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
