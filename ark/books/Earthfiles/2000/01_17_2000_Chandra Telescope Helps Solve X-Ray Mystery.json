Now, it is within reach.\"- Dr. Alan Bunner, DirectorNASA's Structure and Evolution of theUniverseX-Ray Image: A view of our galaxy from the all-sky image by the German-ledROSAT x-ray observatory research \"oriented so that the plane of our Milky Way Galaxyrunshorizontally through the center. Both x-ray brightness and relative energy are representedwithred, green and blue colors from lowest energy to highest. Over large areas of the skya general diffuse background of x-rays dominates.\" Provided by NASA'sMarshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Alabama.January 17, 2000 Huntsville, Alabama - NASA's Chandra X-RayObservatory was launched only five months ago, but it continues to astonishastronomers with its discoveries. One of the most perplexing cosmic mysterieshas been the source of x-ray radiation that seems to pervade the universe.Now a German-led team using Chandra has \"resolved much of the lower-energyX-ray background showing that it arose in very faraway galaxies with extremelybright cores, called quasars or Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN).\" In one sampledregion of the sky, the Chandra team resolved about 80% of the more energeticX-ray background into discrete sources. \"Nearly one-third of the sources aregalaxies whose cores are very bright in x-rays, yet emit virtually no optical light"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"from the core. The observation suggests that these 'veiled galactic nuclei' galaxiesmay number in the tens of millions over the whole sky. They almost certainlyharbor a massive black hole at their core that produces X-rays as the gas ispulled toward it at nearly the speed of light.\"During this research, the scientists discovered another new class of objects thathave a red shift of 6 or higher, meaning they are well over 14 billion light yearsaway and could be the most distant objects ever identified.X-Ray Image: New class of galaxies that have a redshift of 6 or higher, meaning they arewell over 14 billion lightyears away and could be the mostdistant objects everidentified.

The flares were the brightest source of X-raysin the sky except for our own sun.According to astronomers at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, radiotelescopes detected two jets of matter firing at nearly the speed of light in theregion identified as a black hole. Black holes are being discovered throughoutthe universe from the center of galaxies to the very edges of the theoretical BigBang. Why there are so many is not understood?It is theorized that black holes are produced when stars or even galaxies collapseon themselves distorting the gravity fields around them so that nothing canescape, including photons of light. Normally, black holes give off steady x-raysand gamma rays. But the star V4641 Sgr released four brief bursts of rapid andintense X-rays.
