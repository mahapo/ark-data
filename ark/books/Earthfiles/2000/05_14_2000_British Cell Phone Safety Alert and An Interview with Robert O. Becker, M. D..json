D.© 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe\"I have no doubt in my mind that at the present time thegreatest polluting element in the earth's environment is theproliferation of electromagnetic fields. \"- Robert O. Becker, M. D., Orthopedic SurgeonMay 14, 2000 London, England - The British government this past weekreceived a medical research recommendation that controls be placed on mobilephone use, especially for all young people under the age of sixteen. TaysideUniversity Hospitals in Scotland reported that in its study of the sort ofmicrowave radiation emitted by cell phones on worms - scientists discoveredchanges in proteins consistent with cooking of the tissues. The British reportsaid that children in particular are considered to be at risk because their nervoussystems are still developing and because the smaller size of a child's skull allowsgreater absorption into the brain tissue of the low level microwaves emitted bymobile phones. Right now in Britain, one in four mobile phone users is under 18years of age.The medical report makes a series of recommendations to the British governmentthat include:1) To reduce cell phone radio frequency exposure five times lower than currentregulations.2) To monitor workers exposed to radio frequency radiation.3) To do independent audits of microwave masts and their emissions to makesure they are not exceeding agreed upon levels.4) To create exclusion zones around microwave masts that are clearly marked.5) To create a national system to test shielding devices and hands-free kits.6) To fund a substantial research program under an independent panel to studythe health effects of mobile phones, financed equally by the public and industrysectors.As electromagnetic pollution proliferates around the planet and scientists incountries such as Great Britain, the Netherlands and Australia continue to raisecautionary alerts, one of the first medical pioneers to study natural electricalcurrents in the human body and to caution about electropollution is Robert O.Becker, M. D.Fifty-two years ago in 1948, Robert Becker graduated from New YorkUniversity's College of Medicine. Later, he became a certified orthopedicsurgeon and spent thirty years as Director of Orthopedic Surgery at the Veterans"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Hospital in Syracuse as well as Professor of Medicine at New York University'sUpstate Medical Center there. During those decades, Dr. Becker pioneeredlaboratory research in the field of regeneration of bone and muscle after injuriesusing weak electrical currents. In his 1985 ground-breaking book, The BodyElectric, Dr. Becker described the exciting progress in his regeneration researchwhile simultaneously warning the public about the growing electromagneticpollution in the environment which could do harm. Twice Dr. Becker has beennominated for a Nobel Prize in Medicine.In Dr. Becker's 1990 book, Cross Currents, The Perils of Electropollution, Dr.Becker showed how our human bodies and immune systems are being adverselyaffected by man-made electromagnetic fields from power lines, radar,microwaves, satellites, ham radios, video display terminals, and even electricappliances. In his book, Dr. Becker pointed out that radiation once consideredsafe,is now correlated with increases in cancer, birth defects, depression,learning disabilities, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Alzheimer's Disease andSudden Infant Death Syndrome.\"He told me this week that he met resistance in finding funding for his pioneeringresearch in the same way that scientists and medical people today cannot getfunding for independent research on microwave and electromagnetic impacts onhuman health. There are now, he says, too many industrial and political interestsvested in the exponential growth and profits of the global telecommunicationsindustry, regardless of the impact on cancers and neurological disease. I askedhim what his current perspective is on the controversy surrounding the safety ofcell phones and electromagnetic pollution.Interview:Robert O. Becker, M. D., Retired Prof. of Medicine at Upstate MedicalCenter, Syracuse , Director of Orthopedic Surgery at the VeteransHospital, Syracuse, New York and author of Cross Currents and The BodyElectric: \"When you get into this business of the environmental effects ofelectromagnetic fields, I was involved in the early stages of questions ofmicrowave radar safety surfaced. My approach was: OK, first of all we have toknow if electromagnetic fields, the fields in the space around you emitted fromany sort of radiating source of such energy - do they have any biological effects?And secondly, what was the natural electromagnetic field environment beforeThomas Edison came along.Now if you look at the question of: Are there biological effects, the engineersand the physicists say absolutely not. Their view in general of what living"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"systems consist of is that the cells are little plastic bags filled with minestronesoup. And you can then with that sort of a concept calculate the field strengthand the frequencies you would need to produce an effect on the minestronesoup. And this is exactly the concept that was employed after it becameapparent that radar systems could heat up the human body. The physicists thatwere involved in answering the question: Are there effects? And at what level dothey occur? And what would be a safe level? Basically, they followed a basicprecept which was to consider a spherical cow, a circular oval object filled withconducting solution and composed of a skin that is transparent to the radiofrequency waves that microwave generators produce. And on that basis, theyasked: How much does it take to heat this up? Where does the cow's temperaturestart to rise?And that number was calculated and confirmed in actual procedures in the labusing the spherical cow concept. They said, \"OK, that's the number at which youare going to start heating people. Let's say that's not such a good idea and we'llset a level ten times lower as the safe levels.\"That level was applied for several decades to everything that concernedelectromagnetic pollution. Of course, this is not correct. Any biologist can tellyou that the body is much more complicated than that and the work I had doneup to that point had involved the body's actual use of electric currents generatedin the body that regulated certain things like healing. Wound healing isassociated with a rather specific electrical current and voltage. So, the premisethat was applied by the physicists and the engineers was erroneous from thestart.That's number one. Number two, what would be the normal electromagneticenvironment assuming that we're starting from scratch at Edison's time - and notEdison either because he went to DC current to light the light bulb. It wasNikolai Tesla who conceived of the system we presently use and who,incidentally, gets no credit for it: the 60 second electromagnetic field that iscarried by power lines, the big lines that are strung across the country, andprovides the current that comes into your home and appears in the wall socketand you use to run the coffee maker and the TV and all the rest of the things inthe house 60 cycles. That didn't even exist one hundred years ago.The only electromagnetic fields on the earth were those inherent in the basicmagnetic field of the earth as it is influenced by the sun. And these were all ateither a steady state magnetic field which is one that is non-varying. The earth'sfield is roughly 500 milligauss. The power, the magnetic field strength of therefrigerator magnet is higher than that.The magnetic field strength inherent in the communication frequencies is far, farlower than that, but all of these are oscillating. They are frequency-dependent.The earth's field does not oscillate very much at all. It goes up and down to aslight extent depending on the time of the day and the situation on the sun.WE HAVE SURFACE LIFE THAT HAS BEEN USED TO EVOLVINGAND GROWING IN A VERY SPECIFIC KIND OF FIELD THAT THEEARTH HAS EMANATED STEADILY AND THEN SUDDENLY SINCEEDISON, ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO, EVERYTHINGCHANGED.Everything markedly changed and if you graphed the curve of increasingincidence of use, it would go up in an exponential fashion. It has been a rise thatdoubles itself every couple of years.BASED ON YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN THE WORK YOU HAVE DONEIN YOUR CAREER CONCERNING ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDSAND BIOLOGY, WHAT IS YOUR OWN ASSESSMENT OF WHEREWE STAND TODAY IN 2000 IN RELATIONSHIP TO THEPROLIFERATION OF CELL PHONES AND THE MAST TOWERS"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THAT PUT OUT THE RADIO FREQUENCIES?As far as I'm concerned, these factors DO have biological effects. I think that theoverwhelming evidence indicates that happens. There is an effect even thoughphysicists and engineers continue to say it's impossible. But the biologists knowbiology. The engineers know engineering and electromagnetics and the two werenever able to see eye to eye on this subject.I have no doubt in my mind that at the present time that the greatest pollutingelement in the earth's environment is the proliferation of electromagnetic fields. Iconsider that to be far greater on a global scale than warming.GLOBAL WARMING.Yeah, and the increase in chemical elements in the environment. All of thesethings are reduced when compared to the proliferating affect of theelectromagnetic fields. The only difference is that we don't know they are there.YES, IT'S AN INVISIBLE POLLUTION.Yes, it's invisible to us. We don't know that it's there. So, it has never been aparticularly prominent question even among the environmental people. And partof the problem is that our total economy is based on unlimited use ofelectromagnetic energy.WHAT IS YOUR GREATEST CONCERN ABOUT WHAT THEEFFECTS AND CONSEQUENCES OF THIS INVISIBLE MICROWAVEAND ELECTROMAGNETIC POLLUTION IS UPON US ALL?There are basically two most important biological effects of electromagneticeffects on, or in, living systems are their effects on growth and development.There is potential for producing disturbances in growth processes in the bodythat can lead to the presence of malignancies. And in that regard, for a long timethe National Institutes of Health had studiously insisted there was absolutely noevidence that there was ANY affect of such fields upon any cancer system in thehuman. I think this is absolute nonsense. And last year, the NIH - without anyfanfare and rather quietly in the dark of the night - issued a little report that saysthere is a relationship between electromagnetic effects and childhood leukemia.Period. End of story, as though that was all. That's not true. Absolutely not true.THAT THERE ARE MORE CONSEQUENCES?Much more. And much more in the area of abnormal growth, the production ofmalignancies, the production of cancers. That's number one.The second one is in the operation of the central nervous system, the brain.There are definitive effects of low strength oscillating electromagnetic fields onbrain function. Now, we look around at the present time and I have livedthrough roughly half of this period of increasing use of electromagnetic energies.We're looking at an entirely different behavioral aspect of the population at thepresent time. We certainly have a far different social attitude at the present timeamong the majority of the population.THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO WHEN THERE WAS NOTOSCILLATING FREQUENCIES?Ye a h .WOULD YOU PUT AT THE TOP OF THAT LIST IRRATIONALVIOLENCE AND ROAD RAGE?Yeah, I would put it up there. I don't know if it's the first thing on the list. If youlook at the proliferation of what is called Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD) -"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"that wasn't even here when I was young. That was not a diagnosis. It neverexisted.ATTENTION DEFICIT DISORDER WHICH HAS BEEN A BIG DEALIN SCHOOLS IN THE LAST HALF OF THIS CENTURY ISSOMETHING THAT IS RELATIVELY MODERN AND COULD BEASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROLIFERATION OF OSCILLATINGELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS?I have no doubt of that. There are people who were interested in this. No one,though, has done the definitive study. This would involve the exposure ofhumans to fields which gets to be morally difficult. But we should know. Theseare very important questions. And the problem is that this is such an importantaspect of our entire economic structure, and not to mention our military posture,you cannot get very much in the way of support from federal granting agenciesto study this sort of thing.SCIENTISTS AND RESEARCHERS ARE STYMIED IN THATREGARD?Yeah. There is no money.IN ENGLAND AND IN AUSTRALIA WHERE THERE HAS BEENSOME SUPPORT FOR THAT RESEARCH, THIS IS WHERE WE AREGETTING THE LARGEST BREAKTHROUGHS IN TERMS OF DATAAND THIS WEEK THERE HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCEMENTS FROMENGLAND, SPECIFICALLY FROM TAYSIDE UNIVERSITY INSCOTLAND. THEY ARE RAISING A BIG RED FLAG ABOUTKEEPING CELL PHONES AWAY FROM CHILDREN. ARE YOUFAMILIAR WITH THIS WORK AND WHAT IS YOUR COMMENT?I'm only familiar with the press releases that came out. It's a very good idea. Icertainly would not permit any child of mine under the age of sixteen to walkaround with a cell phone in their pocket.The funny thing is that 20 or 15 years ago, maybe even a decade ago, cellphones weren't around. Now, when you're using this, you put the telephoneright up against your head. The antenna that is emitting the signal that is pickedup by the cell phone towers and then sent to wherever you intend to go isirradiating the brain. There is no doubt about it. It does.Can this be good? As far as I am concerned - No, it can't be good.Could it possibly be neutral? In other words, have it and not get sick from it?I'm going to negate that one, too. I say I don't believe that. I think that any timeyou have an extraneous energetic source of electromagnetic energy introducedinto a body carries a potential for harm.THAT'S BASED ON YOUR MEDICAL WORK?Ye s .THEY ARE SAYING IN THIS NEW WORK THAT THEY HAVE DATATO THEIR OWN SURPRISE THAT \"ONE ODD FINDING CAME UPWHEN WE LOOKED AT MICROWAVE RADIATION IN NEMATODEWORMS THAT SHOWED ODD CHANGES TO THE PROTEINSTRUCTURES. AND THAT IT WAS A KIND OF HEAT SHOCK ONTHE PROTEIN, SLIGHTLY COOKED.\" AND THAT CHILDREN ARETHE MOST SUSCEPTIBLE.That's correct.THEY ARE GROWING."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"They are still forming structures in the brain. They are still forming synapticconnections throughout the whole brain. You introduce something that is goingto change things there and you are running the risk of producing a permanentalteration in some aspect of cerebral functioning.Now, I'm sorry, I know how important this is from an economic point of view.But I think it's a very bad thing to do. I think the cell phone proliferation hasresulted in exposing more people to electromagnetic energy that's exceeded onlyto our exposure to the 60 cycle radiation coming from our power frequency,electric power grid. That exposes almost everybody in the world. It's either 50cycle or 60 cycle and you can't go any place on the face of the earth and put upan antenna and find an electromagnetic environment NOT contaminated withone or another or many more of these frequencies.IT'S NOT CLEAR WHAT THE CONSEQUENCES OF ALL THIS IS ONOUR EVOLUTIONARY PROCESSES?Absolutely no.THE INCREASING VIOLENCE AND RAGE AND IRRITABILITIES INSO MANY LEVELS OF SOCIETY, ESPECIALLY IN THEINDUSTRIALIZED WORLD, COULD BE LINKED DIRECTLY TOTHIS?I don't know of any data that says that, but as far as I am concerned that wouldconstitute a perfectly valid hypothesis.IN YOUR WORK, DID YOU EVER WORK WITH MICROWAVEFREQUENCIES TO SEE WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE ONBIOLOGIES?No, I did not. I stayed closer to the natural frequencies. I did a lot of work on 60cycles. Back then, microwaves were theoretically considered capable of onlyheating things.I've lived through a fairly lengthy period of time in which science looking at thisproblem - both the biologists and physicists and engineers looking at it - havechanged their mind and have grown closer together in regards to the potentialfor harm.AGREEING THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR HARM.Yeah. I think at the present time that the majority of the physicists in the UnitedStates view with practically the same amount of alarm as you and I do. And atone time that was not true. So, there has been a learning curve in all this andwe're still on that learning curve! Now, how do we learn more. It's rather simple.Make available more money and make it available to independent researcherswho have no connections to any aspects of the economic end of theelectromagnetic usage. This is very important.The Electric Power Institute funded large studies and they found nothing!BECAUSE THEY HAD A VESTED INTEREST IN NOT FINDINGSOMETHING.You can design a project to be negative if you like to from the very start.IN THIS TIME WHEN SCIENTISTS THEMSELVES ARE EXPRESSINGCONCERN ABOUT THE POLLUTION OF ELECTROMAGNETICFREQUENCIES, ISN'T IT IRONIC THAT NOW IS THE TIME THATTHE VESTED POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS AREEVERYWHERE WORKING TO MAKE THIS AN ELECTRONICALLYCONNECTED WORLD. IS THERE ANYWAY OF PERSUADING"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"ANYONE THAT GOING THIS ROUTE COULD HAVE ANINCREASING PSYCHOLOGICAL AND OTHER NEGATIVE IMPACTSON PEOPLE?I don't believe there is ever going to be a real solid unimpeded study of thesefactors. I think we will continue to increase the exposure of the globalpopulation, that we will see as a result of this, increases in cancer. We alreadyhave. We're at the point now where every other person, one out of two, is verylikely to in the course of their life time to develop a malignancy. It was too longago that it was one out of three. And a little bit further back, it was one out offour.IF WE'RE AT ONE OUT OF TWO, IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT NOONE COULD LIVE WITHOUT HAVING A MALIGNANCY.That's right. We shouldn't have to have it. We should be able to prevent it. Whois looking at prevention?And as far as the other aspect of it - growth control and central nervous systemoperations. Now, on that side of it, I will give you the prediction that you aregoing to see more and more hyperactive attention deficit disorder, you're goingto see more and more aberrant behavior in the mature population. Where doesthis end? Every time you start thinking that we're at the end of the line as far asthe development of electromagnetic devices that radiate into the environment,then something new comes along. The cell phone is a very new item and it hasbecome ubiquitous in our environment and in most industrialized nations.In the Scandinavian countries, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland - they havebeen looking very closely at the power frequency, electric power, 60 cycles.And to the best of my knowledge, they are the only countries that have set upstandards for exposure to that and regulations as to what you can build andwhat you can put into the environment.WHAT KIND OF RADIO FREQUENCIES ARE EMITTED FROM THETYPICAL CELL PHONE?The present generation of cell phones, some are operating at the megahertzrange. Others are operating at the gigahertz range which is billions of cycles persecond. So, the radiation is oscillating at the enormously rapid frequency. Evenstandard TV signals are megahertz signals. These are just an awful lot fasterfrequency. The fact of the matter is that the higher up in frequency you go, themore energy the radiation happens to have.IN YOUR CAREER, YOU WERE ON THE TRACK OF BEING ABLETO HEAL FRACTURES AND POSSIBLE SPINAL INJURIES ANDWHAT IN THE WORLD WOULD BE MOTIVATING THE MINDS ATTHE TIME TO STOP RESEARCH IN THAT DIRECTION?At that point in time, it was primarily a military problem in the Dept. of Defense.We were shifting very rapidly from the standard warfare or WWII to the morehigh technology of the Vietnam war. This is where most of the technology thatwe see now in the military evolved was during Vietnam. The use ofelectromagnetic fields for communication and remote sensing and things of thisnature were considered to be essential and here I was saying, 'Hey, it might notbe such a great idea.'WHAT DO YOU THINK IT WOULD TAKE TO HAVE THE POLITICALAND MONEY POWERS CHANGE THEIR PRIORITIES?(long laugh) I don't know. Maybe at the end of the line when the occurrence ofmalignancy is two in every person during their life time and we have rioting inthe streets for no cause and obvious problems with the psychology of the humanrace - maybe some people will still be OK enough to say, 'Geez, we made aterrible mistake.' But I don't see anything happening between now and then. Or"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"there may be a technology that becomes available that is capable of safelyreplacing the cell phones. I don't know.
