Photograph © 2000 by Linda Ross.August 29, 2000 Woodburn, Oregon - Yesterday I received the photographabove in an e-mail from Helen Bibelheimer of Keizer, Oregon. She wrote:\"My friend, Linda Ross, took the picture from a hot air balloon earlyAugust 13, 2000 near Woodburn, Oregon. I have an original and shehas the negative. She wasn't looking for it (crop formation), justtaking a ride! Linda is not that interested in crop circles.\"No news about it in the newspaper, nothing about it anywhere. Thegal who owned the hot air balloon hadn't seen it before, either, andthought it was a place where tractors turned around. When Lindashowed it to me, I immediately e-mailed it to you.\"More Information:Nancy Talbott, Coordinator for the BLT Research Group in Cambridge,Massachusetts, says this is the Whiskey Hill Road formation between Woodburnand Hubbard, Oregon, first noticed on August 5th by pilot Michael Salisbury ofPortland. A field report was made by Carol Pedersen on August 7, 2000 in"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"which she described the large formation as having a 481 foot diameter in verymature and dry wheat.August 7, 2000: \"Three 62-foot circles (not touching each other)arranged in a triangle shape surrounded by a three-scallop edgedpathway about four foot wide. The edge of each circle intersected ata scalloped edge indentation inward. The lay was all counter-clockwise in the outer path and in each circle. There were nopathways to or from the formation\" at the time she did the fieldsurvey at Longitude 122 W 48 Latitude: 45 N 10.\"Carol said, \"The field is located in the highly populated farm countryof the Willamette Valley along a well traveled road, but the fielditself is in somewhat of a depression so the formation could not beseen from the road.\"The farmer was not aware the formation was in his field , it was never reportedto the media and no one ever claimed to have made it. This 2000 formation wasin the same field crossed by electrical power lines where a previous and majorformation appeared in 1998. Carol Pedersen became sick and dizzy whileworking inside the formation, possibly affected by residual energies or magneticfield anomalies produced by whatever made the crop glyph.We b s it e s :http://www.cropcircleresearch.com/http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
