Thirty-three of the best 1999 Englishformations are featured in more than 100 images.Karen Douglas writes, \"Many of the most dramatic crop circles continue toappear in and around the Avebury area of the county of Wiltshire. This is indeeda most ancient and sacred ritual landscape. Sites such as Silbury Hill, WestKennett Longbarrow and the Devil's Den dolmen are all part of the once hugecomplex of Avebury, now largely destroyed and its past glories as one of theearliest Megalithic sites in Britain long forgotten. In fact, the whole of the cropcircle phenomenon could be seen as one mysterious ritual being played out insecret on our sacred landscape.\"There is a clear relationship between the crop circles and these ancient sites.Underlying geometries and careful placement on the landscape are but two overtsimilarities. One less obvious correspondence involves strange sightings of apeculiar form of light phenomenon which has been seen for hundreds of yearsaround our ancient sites, but which is now seen with a growing regularity in andaround the crop circles.\"It seems we are dealing with a complex system of universal principles, coded insacred geometries and number mysticism, which have been alluded to forthousands of years. Crop circles in some way seem to be hinting at or evenheralding the rediscovery of some of these principles.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"An excerpt from Page 7, Crop Circle Year Book 1999 featuring the August 4, 1999formationthat appeared near the West Kennett Longbarrow across the road from Silbury Hill,Wiltshire County, U.K. © 1999 by Steve Alexander and Karen Douglas.More Information:Crop Circle Year Book 1999 can be ordered directly from Steve Alexander andKaren Douglas by sending a check for $25.00 in U.
