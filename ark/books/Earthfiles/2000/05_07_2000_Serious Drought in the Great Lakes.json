On Lakes Michigan and Huron, this is the largesttwo year drop that we've had in our 140 years of record.\"- Frank H. Quinn, Ph.D., May 2000Great Lakes Environmental Research LaboratoryMay 7, 2000 Ann Arbor, Michigan - Drought has taken hold in the GreatLakes in a severity not seen since the mid 1960s and the 1930s. With waterlevels in the lakes near record lows, big cargo ships can no longer carry theheavy loads they used to. So far in 2000, the Great Lakes Carriers Associationestimates it's having to lighten each trip by about 8,000 tons and the costs areclimbing. For example, iron ore and coal are valued at $35/ton per trip. So,every 8,000 pounds left behind to get a cargo ship across the shrinking lakewaters is a loss of $300,000 in cargo.Experts warn that water levels in the Great Lakes which contain 20% of theworld's freshwater are likely to continue dropping and that conditions forshipping cargo, recreational boating, dredging, public health from morecontaminated water, crops drying up and a lot more problems are likely to getworse before they get better.A civil engineer who got his Ph.D. in mathematical modeling and water resourceissues for the Great Lakes and is now Senior Research Hydrologist at NOAA'sGreat Lakes Environmental Research Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan isFrank H. Quinn. Dr. Quinn also heads up the Water Resources Division forcomputer modeling data as part of the U. S. National Assessment of thePotential Impacts of Climate Change on the U. S. He was working on GreatLakes water problems in the mid-1960s when the last great drought hit theregion. I asked Dr. Quinn to compare that period with this new drought of 2000. Interview:Frank H.

OnLakes Michigan and Huron, this is the largest two year drop that we've had inour 140 years of record. So, this is really an unusual event in terms of the waterlevels.ARE WE TALKING ABOUT A DROP OF A FOOT, TWO FEET?We're talking about three feet.THREE FEET DROP IN TWO YEARS.Yes, actually I think it was 2.9, but it's close to 3 feet.IS IT TRUE THAT PART OF THE RAPIDITY OF THIS DROP ISRELATED TO THE FACT THAT CANADA HAS NOT HAD THELARGE SNOW PACK THAT IT'S USUALLY HAD IN THE PAST?Yes. A large part of the drop is due to the fact that not only Canada, but theLake Superior Basin has had a lower snow pack than usual. Because of ourmuch warmer weather, it's also melted sooner than usual. And instead of goingoff into the lakes in a rush which gives us our spring rise in lake levels, it kind oflimply trickled in what was left of the snow pack and it went into the lakesearly. But also the northern part of Michigan and Wisconsin also had very lowsnow packs this year that went into the lakes, so the snow pack what's left onthe ground in March is usually the main driver for our water level rise in thespring to when we peak in the summer. The past couple of years has been prettydeficient.IS IT TRUE THAT IN THE AREAS OF MANITOBA AND ONTARIOTHERE WAS A QUOTE FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICETHAT SAID: \"The lack of snow in both the Great Lakes Basin andManitoba and Ontario is 'astounding.'\"Yes, it's a very rare event. Really, the drought to me started in the late fall of1997 and we had an El Nino event in 1997 to 1998 that had a very low snowpack as well. And that's kind of when the drought actually started. But with theGreat Lakes being different than say the Mississippi or inland stream, it takes along time for the impact to be felt. So, right now we are feeling the impact thatstarted back in 1998 and continues to the present time.DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A TREND THAT CONTINUESBECAUSE IT ALSO APPEARS WE ARE IN A GLOBAL WARMINGCYCLE THAT IS INCREASING? WE'VE HAD THE TWO WARMESTWINTERS ON RECORD IN 1999 AND 1998.We know we are going to have continued low lake levels through the remainderof the year. There is a possibility, maybe 5 to 10% probability, that we may hitrecord low levels late this year on Lake Michigan and Huron. If we come to ayear from now in March 2001 and there still is no snow pack, there's a highprobability then that we will set low lake record levels on a number of the lakes.But I think it's important to note that when we came out of a record low in 1964and set a record high in 1972 and 1973, we all thought the Lakes would go backdown again. And we maintained very high lake levels for a thirty year period.So, it's really hard to project what will happen. But if we continue to get drywinters and it's not only the fact that the winters are dry. But they are muchwarmer. So, in addition to not just the snow pack, we have all the plantsthroughout the Great Lakes region using more water for transpiration. So, we'vealso got less run off for the same amount of rain because of the very warmtemperatures.THE PLANTS ARE ALL TAKING UP SO MUCH WATER.The plants are taking up more water and because of the warm temperatures, we"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"also have more evaporation from the Lakes.ISN'T THIS LIKE A DOMINO EFFECT WE ARE BEGINNING TO GETINTO THE WATER IS DROPPING TO PERHAPS UNPRECEDENTEDLEVELS. IF WE GET TO THE END OF THE YEAR AND WINTERAND THERE ISN'T MORE MOISTURE, THAT YOU'VE GOTSHIPPING BY TRAIN AND BOAT ARE NOW AFFECTED, THERECOULD BE AN INCREASE IN THE BACTERIA IN THE WATERSTHAT ARE GETTING HOTTER AND LOWER A PUBLIC HEALTHPROBLEM; YOU HAVE THE ISSUE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OFILLINOIS THAT ALL PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS AND AQUIFERSARE ALSO LOWERING AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS DROUGHT;THAT THIS IS GOING TO AFFECT AGRICULTURAL CROPS ANDYOU MIGHT HAVE TO RESTRICT THAT WATER SIPHONING OFFLAKE SUPERIOR THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING SOLD TO JAPAN?A couple of things right now we are seeing that a good portion of the streams inMichigan, for example, are at record or near record low levels, the tributarystreams. So we are seeing a major impact of the drought.The shipping industry is affected right off the bat because they cannot load theirvessels so deep, so they have to make more transits which means from a socialaspect, the crews are going to have to stay on longer and be away from theirfamily and that's more expensive.The affect we are seeing right now, the most vocal effect, is from the recreationalboaters. A lot of the marinas in the Great Lakes were designed and put in in the1970s, 80s and 90s. A lot of these marinas do not have adequate water in theirslips to float the boats. So there is a lot of dredging going around. And whenyou have the dredging, you tend to stir up the sediments which can have somewater quality issues.Right now, the movement to sell water from Lake Superior to Japan, bottle it upand send Lake Superior bottled water, has been stopped. So that's really not anissue right now.YOU'VE ALREADY ACTED ON THAT?The Great Lake Governors and Premieres, particularly in the Province of Ontariothat had to give the permit. And the International Joint Commission has just hada report come out they regulate the water. They are the joint Canada and U. S.treaty organization and is responsible for water levels and flows in the GreatLakes and they sent a report to the U. S. and Canada stating that we have to bevery careful in conserving our water in the Great Lakes who can use it, how canit be used, where can you take it out. Right now, we are bringing in water fromthe Hudson Bay watershed into Lake Superior, Canadian water. And at the sametime, we're taking water out of Lake Michigan at Chicago to send down theMississippi and for drinking water for the people at Chicago. And these twodiversions basically balance each other.But I think that you will find a continued interest in water conservationthroughout the region if we continue, if we do have a warm and dry summer.WHAT HAPPENS IF THE HUDSON BAY WATER BECOMESAFFECTED BY THIS CONTINUING GLOBAL WARMING, LACK OFSNOW PACK IN CANADA?If they were to have problems with that, they would cut down on the diversionto the Great Lakes which would cause a small drop in the water levelsthroughout the Great Lakes system.HAVE YOU DONE A WORST CASE COMPUTER SCENARIOPROJECTION THAT IF GLOBAL WARMING IS EXACERBATING"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THIS TREND OF WARMING IN CANADA AND THE GREAT LAKESAND IF YOU'VE GONE DOWN THREE FEET IN TWO YEARS OR SOAND YOU WENT DOWN ANOTHER THREE FEET IN THE NEXTTWO YEARS, LET'S SAY, WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OFINCREASED REDUCTION IN WATER LEVELS THROUGHOUT THEENTIRE GREAT LAKES BASIN?Some of the model runs we've done based on global warming have indicated thatwe could indeed be down another two to three feet, but by the year 2030 fromwhat we are right now. I think what you would see happening under thoseconditions is there would be increased demand for water management in theGreat Lakes. Two of the Great Lakes Lake Superior and Lake Ontario arecompletely regulated at the present time. The flows coming out of those lakes Lake Superior by a series of gates across the St. Mary's River and the Siouxlocks. And on Lake Ontario, the amount of water going down the St. LawrenceRiver is controlled by a shared U. S. and Canada power dam across the St.Lawrence between Messina, New York and Cornwall, Ontario.I think if we continue to go down another 2 or 3 feet, we will see a move afootto seriously regulating both Lake Erie, Michigan and Huron to keep their waterlevels up as much as possible. But of course, that doesn't take care of the factthat as the water flows out of the Great Lakes down the St. Lawrence River nomatter what you do upstream, you're still going to have greatly reduced flows inthe St. Lawrence.WHAT IS YOUR OWN PROJECTION THAT IF THIS DROUGHTEXTENDS FOR ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO WHAT COULD HAPPEN?I think what we will see if the drought were to extend for another two years wewould probably see a lot of dredging going on in the Great Lakes, primarily forrecreational boating. Right now, there is mercury in some of these sediments.And if this mercury is de-watered and then watered again, it tends to becomeavailable to the fish and the plants.MEANING THAT MERCURY CONTAMINATION COULD BECOME AREAL PROBLEM IN DREDGING OPERATIONS?It could become a problem in a number of areas. We did have back many yearsago some very serious mercury problems on the Great Lakes. A lot of thismercury has been buried in the sediments. And so, if the sediments becomede-watered; i.e., the lake levels drop and then the lake levels come up a little bitand they are wet again and then dry out, that can make it available. And again, alot of the uses of the Lakes are for recreational and social needs.But in addition, you would have a lot of problems with water intakes for thevarious municipalities that draw water from the Great Lakes. Those in shallowareas may have additional sedimentation due to the fact that the water level islower and therefore, waves that come in would stir up more sediments. Inaddition, a lot of people along the Lakes that have shallow wells that drawwater from the Lakes through the ground water could see their wells start to dryup. And that's already happened in some areas along the St. Lawrence River.WELLS ARE DRYING UP ALREADY?Yes, some along the St. Lawrence River are drying up, the shallow wells that anumber of the people have for their water supplies.RIGHT, AND THE LA NINA CONDITIONS ARE STILL IN HOLD OFNORTH AMERICA AND THAT MEANS USUALLY DRIER IN THEEAST AND SOME OF THESE AREAS LIKE THE GREAT LAKES ANDTHAT WOULD TEND TO SAY THAT A FORECAST OF INCREASINGDRYNESS AND WARMING TEMPERATURES OVER THE NEXTYEAR."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"What we've seen in the outlook, particularly over the next 3 months, put out bythe NOAA Climate Prediction Center does call for warmer temperatures and fordrier conditions. And of course, this will just tend to exacerbate our problemthroughout the Great Lakes system.One of the things we did run with our models was to see what would happen ifwe had the climatological conditions that gave us our record highs in 1986, ifthey were to start right now with out present soil, moisture and Lake levelconditions what would that do by next October? And it was surprising to seethat even if we had those really wet conditions, that we would only bring theLakes up to about where they were last October the importance of the snowfalland how low we are right now, it's really critical. We're really not going to have-even if we have very wet conditions this summer we're not going to have theLakes anywhere up towards normal.\"We b s it e s :http://www.lre.usace.army.mil/http://www.noaa.gov/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
