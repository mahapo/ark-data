Photograph © 2000 by Lou Ashby.October 15, 2000 Boulder, Colorado - Since the 1950s, unusual deathscalled \"animal mutilations\" have been reported around the world. Both domesticanimals and wild game have been affected, especially horses and cattle.Ranchers and law enforcement have long been puzzled because animals arefound with the same pattern of hide and tissue removed usually without bloodfrom the head, sexual organs, and rectum with no signs of struggle or tracksaround the dead animals. Not even the animal's own tracks which provoked lawenforcement to wonder if perpetrators came in and out of pastures using aerialcraft.Colorado has had hundreds of such cases, including a heifer found nine milessouth of Boulder near Eldorado Springs on October 2nd. Eyewitnesses saw thecow alive the day before. The Boulder resident who first found the mutilatedheifer is Lou Ashby, a former newspaper reporter, writer and MUFON fieldinvestigator for the past six years. I talked with her this weekend about herdiscovery near Eldorado Springs. Interview:Lou Ashby, former newspaper reporter, writer and current MUFON fieldinvestigator, Boulder, Colorado: \"As we were hiking back into the opencountry there, we saw a dead cow lying on its side with its legs sticking up verystiffly. So, we crossed the little creek to get over to it. When I came up to thecow, the wounds to its head were very strange. I looked at them closely. Thehide and flesh had been taken off in a circular pattern along the jaw and thewhole muzzle of the cow. The mouth was opened and I looked in and there wasno tongue. The tongue had been removed way far from in the throat. I checkedthe udder. The teats were still there. They were intact. And I checked the cow'srear end and there was no damage there."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE EXCISIONS WERE DRY WITHOUT FLUIDOR BLOOD?That's correct.AND THERE IS AN UNUSUAL PROGRESSION OVER THE NEXT FEWDAYS CONCERNING THIS ANIMAL. COULD YOU GIVE HIGHLIGHTSABOUT WHAT KEPT CHANGING?On Tuesday, the owner found the cow. There were three witnesses there also.The excisions were also present that I mentioned: the tongue was missing, but inaddition, the teats were now missing and the rectum and vagina were cored out.That was the morning of October 3rd. In the afternoon of that same day, theowner came back and dragged the carcass away to another site about 1/4 of amile away and left it in a stand of small bushes.On Wednesday, the 4th, the next day, I went out with a team from MUFON andwe investigated the site. When we arrived at the site, to our surprise the carcasswas missing. We didn't know, of course, that the owner had dragged it away. Butwe took photographs of the site and soil samples and grass samples.ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THE GRASS AT THAT PLACE?We were impressed with the fact that there was a roughly circular patch that wemeasured to be 12 feet in diameter of grass that was more than a foot longwhereas the surrounding grass was very short. And this grass was flattened andswirled. That was exactly where the carcass had been laying.MUFON field investigators sampling grass for analysis from round,flattened area upon which the mutilated heifer was laying.Photograph © 2000 by Lou Ashby, Boulder, Colorado.By Sunday, October 8th, I had found the name of the owner and we had talkedto him and he told us where he had dragged the carcass. So, the same fourmembers of MUFON and I went out again to what I call Site Number 2 and thebody was there. What we found then was in addition to the previous wounds,the cow's neck was completely de-fleshed. All the hide and skin on the entireskin, including the eyes and ears and down the neck to where it starts joiningwith the body - all of that flesh was removed. And half the tail had been cut off.I saw nothing that looked like bite marks or tear marks or tugging or pulling.And the wounds we did see had precise edges."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"October 8, 2000, more tissue from the heifer had been removed including half the tail,flesh from the neck vertebrae and heifer's jaw. Photograph © 2000 by Lou Ashby.I UNDERSTAND THE OWNER HAD ANOTHER UNUSUAL ANIMALDEATH EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO?He lost a cow under somewhat similar circumstances and he said when he foundthat dead cow, it was lodged in a stand of trees and it was lodged so tightly theyhad to cut down trees to get the body out. What Mr. Hogan said to me was thathe saw these excisions on the body of the animal, 'You could tell it had beendone with a laser.'HOW DID IT COMPARE TO THIS NEW ONE?He said they were similar.AND TO HAVE AN ANIMAL LODGED SO TIGHTLY SUGGESTS THEANIMAL WAS DROPPED FROM THE AIR DOWN INTO THE TREES.I can't think of any other explanation. It couldn't have been dragged there.\"Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
