I was in that formation around 4 PM that afternoon and wasamazed at the thousands of \"peacock feathers\" neatly created in wave patternsby the whiskers of the mature barley.Mature barley with hairs carefully laid like feathers on a choppy sea throughout the floorlay of theWindmill Hill pattern discovered August 7, 2000.

We arrived at theformation at around 9:15 PM in the evening.WHICH FORMATION WAS THIS?The formation that appeared with the rings, fairly simple design with rings andcircles.THIS IS THE ONE THAT PEOPLE ARE CALLING THE PEACOCKFEATHER FLOOR LAY?That's correct. We set ourselves up inside the formation and had been there acouple of hours. By about 11 o'clock in the evening, we started to see verybright lights on the horizon towards the Cherhill monument. One's first reactionis that it's probably a helicopter or plane flying directly towards you with itsmain lights on.Spinning DiscBut we stood there for some time and watched this particular light and it seemedto remain motionless in the sky. And when you looked at it through binoculars,it seemed to be shifting or rotating or something. There was definitely a feelingthat it wasn't one light. There was a feeling that there were other lights around itor the whole thing was shimming backwards and forwards or something likethat.WHAT COLORS WERE YOU SEEING?It was predominantly white and orange, but the two people who were with methat evening also saw other colors. Blue was mentioned as well. We'd all sat andwatched this for some time and I decided to get my camera from its bag to try totake a photograph of it and the very instant I picked the camera bag up, the thingjust blinked out, disappeared. We stayed there for some time and the wholeprocess repeated itself. We saw a similar light in a similar direction to that, but itdidn't stay stationary for so long. It disappeared off to the west.Red LightsAnd then shortly after this, we noticed some red lights traveling towards the eastfrom that point. Naturally, we tracked these and I looked at them throughbinoculars and then put the binoculars down and watched the lights. Thereseemed to be one or two lights traveling eastwards. Then a third light appearedvery near by these other two.Black TriangleThen they seemed to remain stationary in the sky for awhile and started what Ican only describe as sort of darting about, or flashing on and off. It was difficultto say what the motion of these lights was. So, I picked up the binoculars oncemore and had a good look at the lights. And just as I did so, one of these redlights went off, blinked out, and I saw what I can only describe as a blacktriangle fly away to the west from these other lights at a high speed and thisblack triangle was fairly large in size, I would say. It had no lights on itwhatsoever. And none of us could hear anything at all. We couldn't hear aircraftnoise, helicopter noise, or anything. It was dead silent. And it appeared that asthe black triangle went off to the west, the remaining red lights seemed to betrying to follow it. In other words, they went off in the same direction as thetriangle."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Drawing of red lights, yellow spinning disc and black triangle observed with eyes andbinocularsby three adults and one teenager from Windmill Hill formation around 11 PM on August 7,2000 in Wiltshire, England.Drawing © 2000 by Richard Salter.AT ANY POINT, DID THE RED LIGHTS SEEM TO INTERACT WITHTHE TRIANGLE?No, because I didn't notice the triangle until - you know, I had trainedbinoculars on these red lights and the whole thing happened very fast. Oneminute, I was aware of the lights. The next minute, I saw this black object and itjust darted away to the west. And the remaining lights seemed to be tracking it,following it or making an attempt to follow it, but couldn't maintain its speed. It(the triangle) just vanished.IS THERE A RED YOU COULD COMPARE THESE RED LIGHTS TOTHAT WE MIGHT ALL KNOW?I have spent many nights on the hills around here and it is very easy to getcarried away with sightings that could have more explainable feel to them. Theselights are sometimes associated with helicopters and do see these lights onhelicopters, so I naturally thought at first that's what I was witnessing. Butbecause of the way they behaved and darted about in the sky, flickered on andoff, and then the sudden interaction with this black object, I'm not so sure theywere helicopters, but who knows?BUT THE RED YOU WOULD RECOGNIZE AS A RED ON AHELICOPTER?Yes, it was a very intense red. No other hint of color in it.HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THEREMIGHT BE SOMETHING IN THE UNKNOWN THAT MIMICS THINGSLIKE HELICOPTERS AND PLANES?Oh, yes. It's well known that unmarked helicopters are seen in various parts ofthe world, usually with no lights or markings.YOU AREN'T THE FIRST PERSON WHO HAS BEEN WATCHINGSOMETHING, GOTTEN A CAMERA OUT TO VIDEOTAPE WHATTHEY THOUGHT MIGHT BE A HELICOPTER ONLY TO HAVEWHAT THEY THOUGHT WAS A HELICOPTER WITH A FLASHINGLIGHT SUDDENLY TRANSFORM INTO MULTIPLE LIGHTS THATSEEMED TO BE GOING AROUND SOMETHING?Right. This group of lights, originally the three red lights, were very closelybunched together and seemed to be tracking from west to east in a line. Then atthis particular point in time, they all seemed to converge on this one spot andthat's the point at which I trained the binoculars on them. And no sooner had Idone that then I was aware of this black object which seemed to me - I got the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"distinct impression that this black object was trying to evade these lights.WHEN YOU WERE LOOKING AT THE RED LIGHTS THROUGH THEBINOCULARS, COULD YOU SEE ANY STRUCTURE AT ALL?No, none whatsoever, until this black object appeared.HOW FAR DO YOU THINK, ESTIMATE, THE BLACK TRIANGLEWAS FROM THE RED LIGHTS THAT YOU COULD SEE THROUGHTHE BINOCULARS?I'd say they were all together in the same part of the sky.DOESN'T IT SEEM LIKE THERE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE ARELATIONSHIP, ATTACHMENT, BETWEEN THOSE RED LIGHTSAND THAT BLACK TRIANGLE?That's certainly how it seemed to me.WHEN THE BLACK TRIANGLE BEGAN TO MOVE OFF AT A RAPIDRATE, THE RED LIGHTS FOLLOWED?I think one or two might have followed, but because I was concentrating on theblack object through the binoculars, I'm led to believe by my two friends whowere with me that other things happened after this.Claire Salter, 14-Years-OldYOU HAVE HEARD WHAT YOUR FATHER DESCRIBED WHAT HESAW. CAN YOU NOW START FROM THE VERY FIRST UNUSUALTHING YOU SAW AND DESCRIBE FOR ME IN AS MUCH DETAIL ASPOSSIBLE, THINKING OF A RADIO AUDIENCE ABOUT WHAT YOUSAW WITH YOUR OWN EYES?Yes, we were just looking around and then we saw a very bright light. And it waswhite and it seemed to be flashing different colors like orange, red, green. Andwhen we looked through the binoculars, it didn't seem to be like a round object.It seemed to look like a flat disc-shaped object and it looked like it was rotatinground and round in the same spot all the time.WHAT WERE YOU SEEING THAT SUGGESTED TO YOU THAT ITWAS SP IN N IN G ?I don't know. It just didn't seem to be on the same spot. The lights were moving,but not coming forward or backwards, just rotating.WOULD YOU COMPARE IT TO SOMETHING LIKE A MERRY-GO-ROUND?Yeah, it looked like a merry-go-round.YOU'RE WATCHING THESE DIFFERENT COLORED LIGHTS THATAPPEAR TO BE TURNING AROUND LIKE A MERRY-GO-ROUND.DID YOU SEE ANY OTHER OBJECTS AROUND IT?No, that was the one.DID YOU SEE ANY BEAMS OR LIGHTS EMANATE FROM IT?No, it just looked like a disc shaped object rotating.HOW DO YOU THINK THAT COMPARES, THE FLAT DISC WITHROTATING LIGHTS - WITH WHAT YOUR FATHER DESCRIBED OF"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"THE RED LIGHTS AND BLACK TRIANGLE? DID YOU SEE THEBLACK TRIANGLE?I saw the red lights, but because I didn't have any binoculars or anything, I didn'tsee the black triangle.WHERE WERE THE RED LIGHTS IN COMPARISON TO THEFLATTENED DISC THAT SEEMED TO BE SPINNING?It was further to the left. I don't know how much further, but quite a long wayand lower down.WHICH PART WAS LOWER DOWN?The red lights and the black triangle were lower to the horizon than the singledisc.WHEN THE BLACK TRIANGLE TOOK OFF WITH THE REDLIGHTS, WHAT DID THE SPINNING DISC DO?It had gone by then. The spinning disc had gone by the time the red lights andblack triangle had arrived.DID YOU SEE IT MOVE OFF? WHAT HAPPENED? HOW DID THATDISC GO AWAY?My dad was going to get the camera out to take pictures and it just blinked out,disappeared. I have something else to add. Because when my dad was watchingthe black triangle, he didn't see what else went on and one of the red lights thatstayed and didn't follow the black triangle turned a really, really bright whitecolor. And then just blinked out and another light just shot up into the skyupwards really quickly.W H AT T IME WAS T H AT ?I think it was around about midnight. (Monday, August 7 to Tuesday, Aug. 8)We were pretty much amazed to find out the following morning after this nightwatch that a new crop circle was found at All Cannings, it's a 9-pointed starformation. And of course, we were trying to figure out if the lights and triangularobject that we saw from our perspective at Windmill Hill been in the generaldirection of All Cannings. I would say it was slightly to the west of AllCannings, but who knows? Directions can be deceptive, especially at night. Butit is rather odd that we witnessed all these things and then the followingmorning, there was a fresh crop formation.WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY OF 2000, THE9-POINTED STAR WITH THOSE FOUNTAINS IN IT.Nine pointed star with tall swirls of wheat between each point discovered"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"between Stanton St. Bernard and All Cannings on August 8, 2000.Aerial photograph © 2000 by Steve Alexander.One of the nine tall swirls between the nine points of the star.Photograph © 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe.RICHARD, HAVE YOU EVER SEEN ANY OTHER UNUSUAL LIGHTPHENOMENA OVER THE LAST SIX YEARS IN WILTSHIRE?Yes, I was here last summer with my son on numerous occasions and every timewe came down, we experienced different sorts of light shows in the area. We satand watched what we thought were satellites tracking across the night sky onlyto be completely confounded by their peculiar and erratic motions. Sometimesthey would change direction while we were watching them. Or we had oneparticular case in which what we thought was a satellite suddenly started to do aslalom in the sky and just wobbled from side to side and then disappeared. Wesaw numerous bright lights come off the horizon, very intense white light thatwould change colors to green or orange and then suddenly stop or changedirection and move off.We've been watching a starry sky. I'm quite used to observing the sky because I'msort of a keen amateur astronomer, so I know the constellations and various keystars. And I'm used to gazing at the sky. And last year, I saw several what Ithought were stars suddenly start to move where they had been completelystationary before. Then they would suddenly move positions in the sky. Ofcourse, you question your sanity when you see these things because it's just soweird and bizarre, but I'm fairly certain what my son and I saw last summer waspretty unusual.NOW IN 2000 IN AUGUST, YOU SEE RED LIGHTS IN ASSOCIATIONWITH A BLACK TRIANGLE AND A MERRY-GO-ROUND OF LIGHTSTHAT IS VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT PEOPLE SAW IN JULY OF 1991THE NIGHT THAT THE BARBURY CASTLE EXTRAORDINARYFORMATION OCCURRED. IT'S ALMOST THE IDENTICALDESCRIPTION.Yes, I've read about that series of events and was fascinated by it. And therewere also very loud noises heard in the district, I believe, very loud, thunderynoises. Some people put them down to military aircraft. But there were a wholeseries of bizarre events that particular night.AFTER SIX YEARS, DO YOU HAVE ANY KIND OF INTUITIVEINSIGHT ABOUT WHAT COULD BE BEHIND THIS PHENOMENON?Difficult question, but my own gut feeling is that it's extraterrestrial. I can't pin itdown to anything else. It has to be an intelligence that's interacting with us insome way or wanting to. I don't go down the hoax theory at all. It doesn't washfor me, I'm afraid, having seen so many formations for myself over the years. No,I really am convinced whatever is doing it is coming from above and it's donewith extreme intelligence and great forethought and planning. It's got to be ET"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"as far as I'm concerned.WHEN SOME PEOPLE LIKE ROBBERT IN HOEVEN, HOLLANDWHO SAYS HE THINKS IT IS ANGELIC - WHAT IS YOURRESPONSE TO THE IDEA OF SOMETHING IN ANOTHERDIMENSION THAT MAY HAVE BEEN OVER THE CENTURIESDESCRIBED AS ANGELS?Yeah, it's a possibility. I've often thought along those lines. I don't know. I stillgo with the ETs. There are so many UFO sightings globally now and we've hadour fair share in Britain over the years. It just seems to me that the two have gotto be connected. People see lights in the sky and strange objects darting aboutand then the following day we have crop circles. It just seems to me too obvious.It's got to be the best consideration, I think.WHAT ARE THESE SOLID BLACK TRIANGLES THAT HAVE NOLIGHTS, THAT HAVE BEEN SEEN OVER AN ARC OF TEN YEARS INASSOCIATION ALSO WITH THE CROP CIRCLE MYSTERY? THATSEEMS TO BE ONE OF THOSE UNSOLVED MYSTERIES THAT SOFAR NO ONE HAS BEEN ADDRESSING.Yeah. Black triangles in Britain have been seen for some time now and peoplehave had them fly overhead completely silently and describe them as being thesize of football fields - great big black, sinister-looking objects. Who knows?\"More Information:Back in 1992, a book entitled Ciphers in the Crops, The Fractal andGeometric Circles of 1991, Edited by Beth Davis was published by GatewayBooks in Bath, England. On Page 57, under the title \"Pulsing Lights atBeckhampton\" author Gary Hardwick wrote about what he and two others sawaround midnight on August 16-17, 1991, only hours before the extraordinaryBarbury Castle Triangle formation was discovered at sunup.\"We (Gary, Brian Grist and friend, Alison) stood outside an watched as this light(Light Number One) pulsed green and red... It was traveling in a westerlydirection towards Calne. There was no noise. ...I had a pair of field glasseswhich I attempted to focus on the light. I handed them to Brian. I then noticedanother light moving behind us... For some reason I looked straight above whereI was standing - vertically into the night sky, which was clear and peppered withstars. In an instant, probably no more than two or three seconds, I saw above mea black shape, narrow at the front and wide at the rear, which obscured the starsand which passed eastward at incredible speed and totally silently towards thehorizon. ...all that I can say is that it resembled a triangle. ...I was left with anoverwhelming feeling of having seen something so powerful that any attempt atdecoding its possible meaning would be futile.\"Light Two ...was just sitting in the sky in the general direction of Windmill Hill.Through the field glasses, it could be seen pulsing white, green and green-blue;it had no discernible shape.\"We next became aware of Lights Three and Four across the toad towards thenorth. ...They were pulsing like the uncoordinated flashing of the two lights onthe roof of an emergency vehicle, like an ambulance...(Light Five) ...and we nowall saw together a much larger light of pulsing red in vertical motion. ...Itsmovement also seemed quite jerky, which could be to do with its distance fromus. However, it also seemed to be quite large in comparison to the earlier lights.I had to steady the field glasses on the roof of the car and hold my breath.Having done this, what I saw was a column of red, green and white pulses,alternating direction from bottom to top and vice versa."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"\"Light Five, the vertical column, was by now very low in the sky. Suddenly wesaw a very thin white beam of light join it to the ground. This beam was curved,not straight or jagged, and lasted one to two seconds.
