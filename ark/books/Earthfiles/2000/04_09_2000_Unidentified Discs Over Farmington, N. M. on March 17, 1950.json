Speed Estimated at 1000 mph. Altitude 20,000 feet.Estimates of the number ranged from 'several' to more than 500. Whateverthey were, they caused a major sensation in this community, which lies only110 air miles northwest of the huge Los Alamos atomic installation.\"March 18, 1950, Farmington Daily Times, Farmington, New Mexico.The Denver Post had a similar headline on March 18, 1950 that read: \"Mass 'Saucer' FlightReported Over New Mexico City,\" along with a United States Air Force denial that\"despite a flood of new reports to the contrary, the Air Force still believes there is no suchthing as a 'flying saucer.'\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"March 18, 1950, The Denver Post, Denver, Colorado.That official statement meant the U. S. government was dismissing testimony of at least 250people personally interviewed by Walt Rogal, Editor of the Farmington Daily Times. Mr.Rogal told The Denver Post that he estimated 85% of Farmington's 6,100 population sawthe unidentified objects. Half of 6,100 is 3,050 eyewitnesses!Most witnesses agreed all of the objects were a silvery color except for one tomato-redsaucer which descended to a lower altitude than the others.This week I talked with two of the eyewitnesses. Clayton Boddy, now 83-years-old, isretired and living in Arizona. Mr. Boddy originally went to Farmington in 1947 and workedas Business Manager for the Farmington Daily Times until 1951 when he was pulled backto military duty in the Korean War.Interviews:Clayton Boddy, former Business Manager, Farmington Daily Times, 1947-1951,Farmington, New Mexico: \"We were walking down the street when we looked up andsaid, 'What in the world is that?'WHAT WERE YOU SEEING EXACTLY?I saw a group of - I don't know how to explain it - it looked to me like silver discs goingthrough the air end over end. And they were following in a compact group.\\HOW MANY DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SEEING?They were extremely high, so I suspect it's hard to tell, but I imagine there must have beena hundred or so.WHEN YOU SAY THEY WERE GOING END OVER END, CAN YOU EXPLAIN THATMORE?If you were to hold a disc in your hand and then just turn it clear over, where the top comesto the bottom and the bottom goes to the top in a circle - like that.THE TOP KEPT GOING TO THE BOTTOM, THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP, THE TOPTO THE BOTTOM. SO IT WOULD BE LIKE THESE ROUND THINGS KEPTTURNING OVER ON THEMSELVES IN THE SKY?That is correct.WERE THEY REFLECTING SILVER LIKE SOMETHING POLISHED? OR WAS IT A"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"DULL SILVER COLOR?They were very high and it seemed to me they were pretty bright. And this was maybe 10or 11 o'clock in the morning because I had pointed out some possible buildings to somebuyers that were empty or would be. Then I went back over to the newspaper office.HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU THINK WERE OUT ON THE STREET INFARMINGTON AT THAT TIME WHO SAW THE ARMADA OF SILVER DISCS GOINGOVER?There were quite a few people. I think it was pretty well covered in the newspaper at thattime. I saw something I could not explain.YOU HAD A FOLLOW UP CALL, DIDN'T YOU, FROM WASHINGTON, D. C.?Ye s .WHO WAS IT FROM AND WHAT DID THEY SAY?I don't know the gentleman's name. It seemed he was from the War Department, somegovernment agency. And he said, 'There's nothing to this. We're running some experimentsor something. And we would prefer if you didn't say anything.'DID YOU THINK AT THE TIME THAT THE FACT THAT THE WAR DEPARTMENTWOULD BOTHER TO CALL YOU UP TO TELL YOU THERE WAS NOTHING TOALL THOSE SILVER DISCS THAT YOU HAD SEEN IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACOVER-UP BY THE GOVERNMENT?As I look back on it, it could have been. But they all probably thought it was a sleepy littletown out west and maybe we were hallucinating! I don't know.BUT IT APPEARS THAT IF THEY WENT TO THAT MUCH TROUBLE TO CALLRESIDENTS IN FARMINGTON, THEY MUST HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUTSOMETHING.I think they were. And, of course, my position with the newspaper at that time was prettyhigh.THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT MEDIA ATTENTION OF THE SILVER DISCS?That's right.sDID ANYBODY ELSE RECEIVE PHONE CALLS FROM THE WAR DEPARTMENTABOUT THOSE DISCS?I don't know. I never heard that anyone else did. Then NBC or one of the major networkscalled me and asked if I could be interviewed. And then they called back shortly afterwardand said the interview was called off.THE IMPLICATION MIGHT BE THAT IF THE WAR DEPARTMENT WAS CALLINGYOU, TELLING YOU TO FORGET IT AND NOT TALK ABOUT IT, THATSOMEBODY IN THE WAR DEPARTMENT MIGHT HAVE CALLED THE NETWORKSIN NEW YORK AND INTERFERED?It's a possibility. A likely possibility, I would say.DID YOU ASK THEM AT THE TIME WHEN THE WAR DEPARTMENT CALLEDWHAT THE DISCS WERE?No, I didn't ask them. It was a very short conversation.SORT OF ONE-SIDED?Yes, they just told me (there was nothing to it).AFTER THAT CONVERSATION, WHAT WERE YOU LEFT FEELING?I didn't have as much feeling about it as my editor and some of the people in the paper.WHAT DID YOUR EDITOR SAY?Obviously he thought it was something or they wouldn't have put in all the headlinesPROBABLY WHEN YOUR EDITOR HEARD THAT THE WAR DEPARTMENT HADCALLED YOU, HE FIGURED THERE WAS A LOT MORE TO THIS STORY."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"They didn't call the editor. I think I was the one they called. And I think it was based on thefact that I was invited to be on the NBC news show.SO, SOMEBODY DID NOT WANT YOU TO BE ON NATIONAL MEDIA.I think the government was trying to squelch the whole thing.\"That same day, March 17, 1950, Marlo Webb was outside working at the Chevroletdealership in Farmington. Mr. Webb had served as a Navy pilot in the war and knewairplanes. He had no idea what the silver objects were that moved together so erratically.He is now 76-years-old and owns the same Chevrolet dealership. He knows Clayton Boddyand remembers the unusual objects that moved in the sky, which he and several of hiscolleagues watched for about five minutes.Marlo Webb, Owner, Chevrolet Dealership, Farmington, New Mexico: \"I think it waslate morning to the northwest approximately 70 to 80 degrees above the horizon, a group ofshiny I say shiny objects because I think they were visible only because the sun wasreflecting off of them. And I would estimate anywhere from a dozen to dozen and a halfseemed to be in formation seeming to make erratic course changes. They were not going tothe horizon and disappearing. They didn't look like they were on one course going fromhere to there.WHEN YOU SAY ERRATIC COURSE MOVEMENTS, COULD YOU EXPLAIN THAT?Normal aircraft would make a curving course change, where these seemed to be dartingabout at nearly 90 degree angles, very sharp angles.DID THEY MOVE TOGETHER THE WAY FISH DO IN A SCHOOL?Basically yes.SO THEY ALL MOVED TOGETHER NO MATTER HOW ERRATIC THEMOVEMENT?Yes, but they didn't keep their same position in the formation, or at least I did not noticethat.HOW LONG DID YOU WATCH THEM?Five minutes or less.HOW MANY PEOPLE WERE WITH YOU AT THE CAR DEALERSHIP?Three or four.EVERYONE WAS WATCHING?There was no question that the people there could pick them out and see them. It wasn't asthough I see something you don't. We all observed it.FROM YOUR MILITARY BACKGROUND AS A PILOT, COULD YOU COMPAREWHAT YOU WERE SEEING WITH ANYTHING YOU HAD SEEN BEFORE?No, I couldn't identify what it was. And I think I gave all the details to the military whenthey came to investigate it. They asked basically the same questions you are: what was thesize, shape, distance, course, speed. But it was impossible to judge.DID YOU INFER FROM THOSE MILITARY QUESTIONS THAT THEY DID NOTKNOW WHAT HAD FLOWN OVER FARMINGTON EITHER?Yes, I think so.THEY WERE UNIDENTIFIEDS. DID THEY MAKE ANY COMMENTS TO YOUABOUT THEIR OWN WORRIES CONCERNING WHAT THE UFOS WERE?No, not at all. These were interviewers. These were not decision makers.IN TOWN, AMONG THE PEOPLE WHO HAD SEEN THE ARMADA OF THESESILVER CRAFT GOING OVER, WHAT KIND OF DISCUSSIONS WERE THERE BACKTHEN?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Strictly unidentified objects. People were out for days trying to see more discs. In fact, laterin the day, I heard or read in the newspaper that other people had seen other groups ofdiscs later that day (March 17, 1950).\"More Information:If anyone has more information about the Farmington disc flyovers on March 17, 1950, orthe retrieval of one or more silver discs near Aztec, please contact the Aztec Library at:505-334-7658.Also, I welcome further information concerning this report at earthfiles@earthfiles.comor FAX me at 505-797-7908 or write me at P.
