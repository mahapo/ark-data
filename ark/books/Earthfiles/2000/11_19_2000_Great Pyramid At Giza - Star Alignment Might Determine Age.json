November 19, 2000 Cairo, Egypt - This week a Cambridge UniversityEgyptologist from England, Dr. Kate Spence, announced a possiblerecalculation on the age of the Great Pyramid of Khufu or Cheops on the GizaPlateau near Cairo. She wanted to know how the ancient Egyptians lined up theCheops pyramid so precisely north to south. She hypothesized that stars werethe guide, so she used a computer to wind back time in the sky from today toabout 4500 years ago. Dr. Spence found that the star Mizar, in the Big Dipper'shandle, and Kochab, in the bowl of the Little Dipper, would have appeared oneover the other at a point directly above the North Pole. Dr. Spence thinks thatthe Egyptians then hung a plumb line against the two stars to find true north forthe construction of the great Cheops Pyramid. Her revised date for thatconstruction is now 2478 B. C., give or take five years. If correct, the GreatPyramid could be 75 years older than traditional estimates.Another professor thinks this application of computer power to refine ageestimates of large ancient monuments by calculating star alignments will have abig impact on Egyptology.

I suspect we will start to seepeople attempting to do similar modeling for monuments built in other periods. Ithink we have had such argumentation in Egyptology about using doingastronomical chronology based on the rising of the star, Sirius, which we knowis technically the beginning of each Egyptian civil year. But we don't knowwhere they did it. So, what Kate has done is give us another opportunity to goback and take monuments ignoring the notion of the rise of Sirius and looking atanother sighting or alignment principal that will allow us to do chronology also.So, I think you are going to see people looking for places they can apply similartechniques toUSING COMPUTERS TO GO BACK IN TIME AND SEE WHERE THESTARS MATCHED UP TO THE BUILDING OF THE LARGEMONUMENTS.Exactly. I mean we don't know for sure how many times the Egyptians throughhistory attempted to align monuments to true north, but I suspect that we'rego in g t o :a) see more people looking into that question.b) when they find it, they will perhaps apply her modeling principals for howthey did it.WHY WOULD TRUE NORTH HAVE BEEN SO IMPORTANT TO THEEGYPTIANS?Well, actually to me is pretty fascinating. Because the Egyptians recognized thatthere were a set of stars in the sky that never set. And those are the stars thatrevolve around the north pole, the north celestial pole in the northern sky. Thatwould be our Big Dipper and our Little Dipper. And so they recognized thatfrom obviously very early on and we have references in the pyramid texts to theEgyptian king traveling up into the sky to become and join with one of thecircumpolar stars. The Egyptians called them the \"imperishables\" because theynever set. And they were aware that anything that was further south than thosesets of northern stars were going to disappear below the horizon for a period oftime during the year. That would essentially signal to them that these were starsthat could die and then be brought back again. But the king was to become oneof these stars that never ever set.AND THAT'S WHY HE HAD TO HAVE AN EXIT THAT WOULD TAKEHIM TO THE NORTH AND TO THOSE POLAR STARS."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Exactly. So, the door to the pyramid or entrance out of the pyramid was locatedon the north so that the king was facing what was to be his eternal home.WHY DO YOU THINK AS AN EGYPTOLOGIST THAT THEEGYPTIAN CULTURE WAS SO FOCUSED ON THE STARS ANDSEEMED TO HAVE SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY RELATIONSHIPWITH BUILDINGS AROUND THE STARS IN THE HEAVENS?Well, that's a really wonderful question! It's a question that every Egyptologistwould love someone to give us an explanation for. I don't know the why. I thinkall of us can demonstrate that it is a fact that from the earliest time that we havereferential materials, there is an interest in the heavens and there is anidentification of the heavens with various deities that the Egyptians worshiped.Now, whether that is because they had worked it into their religion, which theycertainly did, or whether there is also a play in it as we know from later Greekconstellations that the Egyptians were just trying to identify things in theheavens with something else that they knew? We really don't know the fullanswer to that. But the truth of the matter is that if you go all the way back andask the question: why are they so interested in the heavens? We can only answerthat we know that within their funerary religion the sky plays a major role whereevents will take place for eternity.AND REINFORCED BY THEIR ALMOST OBSESSION WITHMUMMIFYING THE DEAD FOR LIVING BEYOND THE MOMENT OFDEATH.Oh, definitely. I think the one thing anyone learns studying ancient Egypt is thatthey had a notion of the cosmos as a cycle. Everything continues and themummification process is part of that. Death is not the end. Death is a transition.The same is true in watching the sky. The Egyptians were well aware thatthroughout the year, the stars that were visible in the heavens were not in thesame exact place from day to day. And yet, they also knew that the same sets ofstars were going to reappear next year at the same time. And very early on, theydeveloped very intricate sky maps that would indicate which groups of starswere visible in Egypt at different times of the year and they used them to maketheir calendar with. So, it is the cyclicity of it they could use for marking time -and I mean time in a true sense, but also a really eternal sense that the Egyptianswere taken with.NOW, ROBERT BAUVAL AND JOHN ANTHONY WEST AND OTHERSHAVE WRITTEN BOOKS PROPOSING - AND I THINK ROBERTTEMPLE WHO DID THE SIRIUS MYSTERY ON YET ANOTHER SETOF STARS CONCERNING THE DOGON TRIBE IN AFRICA - THEYHAVE PROPOSED THERE WAS ALL OF THIS FOCUS FROM THESUMERIANS AND EGYPTIANS AND PERHAPS THE GREEKS ONCERTAIN STAR SYSTEMS BECAUSE OUR ANCESTORS MAY HAVEBEEN FROM SOME OTHER STAR SYSTEM. AS YOU STUDYANCIENT EGYPT, DO YOU FIND ANYTHING THAT WOULDSUGGEST PERHAPS THIS IS A SEEDED CIVILIZATION PLANET?You know, when I get asked a question like that, I'm always surprised becausethe ancient Egyptians despite what we might call obsession with preparations forthe afterlife are the most down to earth people in what we can tell from theirtext and inscriptions they have left and their representations of themselves theyhave left us. These are people who just loved life and the fact that they wereinterested in what was going to happen to them after death is only part of theirworld view that meant they wanted to have some control or to predict some kindof control over what was going to happen to them later on and that is as humanas it can be.There is no over concern at all, in my opinion, of the Egyptians with the sky.The skies are practical in the sense that they are brought into their explanationsfor understanding the movement of time and the year and sun from one horizonto the other horizon. It would be difficult for me to understand why anyone"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"would not want to see the Egyptians as not being as human as anybody. Theyhave these wonderful texts where they talk about how they worry if theirfunerary religion is valid, whether it really means they are going to live foreverjust because they build a tomb and fill it with treasures. They are just normalhuman beings.\"The Sphinx faces due east with the Cheops Pyramidin the background at the Giza Plateau. Its age and creator are still unknown.By 1500 B. C., the Egyptians referred to it as Hor-em-akht, Horus in the Horizon.Photographer anonymous.Geologist Reports Sphinx Has Water Erosion Dating Back 7,000-9,000 YearsAgoNear the great Cheops pyramid is the mysterious Sphinx, a statue with the bodyof a lion and the head of a human. Its age and creator are still unknown. Ageologist, Robert Schoch, Ph.D., at Boston University recently spoke before theGeological Society of America about his research at the Sphinx whichconvinced him there is water erosion that must date back at least 7,000 to 9,000years ago, or around 5,000 to 7,000 B. C. That would make the Sphinx nearlytwice the age of the Cheops pyramid. But Dr. Kate Spence's star alignment workdoes not bother him because he and others are coming to the conclusion that theCheops pyramid was built long after the Sphinx.Robert Schoch, Ph.D., Assoc. Professor of Science and Mathematics,College of General Studies, Boston University, Boston, Massachusetts: \" It'svery clear that the origin of the Sphinx goes back before Old Kingdom times,before Khufu (Cheops) who is the traditional builder of the Great Pyramid onthe Giza Plateau. And the work we've been doing is pushing all of the Sphinxback well before that time in a moister, more temperate, rainier season beforethe hyper arid regime of the current Sahara Desert which comes in about 3000B. C. or slightly later.My best estimate now is about 7,000 to 9,000 years ago, or 5,000 to 7,000 B. C.But let me say, I'm open that it could have its origins even earlier than that. Topush its origins any later than about 7,000 years ago, or 5,000 B. C., becomesproblematic given the nature of the geology, given the nature and degree of theweathering that we see on the original body of the Sphinx.WHAT IS THE STRONGEST PHYSICAL EVIDENCE YOU HAVE TOSUPPORT THAT HYPOTHESIS?I would say two things:1) One is the nature of the surface weathering and erosion or we could call itdegradation. Not just the degree but the nature which we can correlate with the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"ancient earlier climates.2) The seismic studies we have done of sub-surface weathering under theSphinx, under the base of the Sphinx which allows us to calibrate how long thatweathering has taken place. Again, we're dealing in our calibrations, dependingupon what assumptions you make, I'm taking a conservative approach more orless looking at it has to be so old - not what is absolutely the oldest it could be.BUT THIS WORK OF KATE SPENCE AT CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITYABOUT THE DATING OF THE PYRAMID OF GIZA AT ABOUT 2,478B. C. IS REALLY NOT IN CONTRADICTION WITH YOUR WORK ONTHE SPHINX BECAUSE THERE MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ANYCONNECTION BETWEEN THE SPHINX AND CHEOPS?Right, I don't think it is in contradiction at all. I think you just said very nicelythere may not be any connection between the Great Sphinx and the GreatPyramid. I think if there is a connection between the Sphinx and any pyramid, Ithink the second pyramid is actually a secondary structure built on somethingelse at that same site and that something else I suspect is related to the GreatSphinx in time and conceptually.THE PYRAMIDS WERE BUILT ON TOP OF PRIOR PYRAMIDSWHERE THE GREAT PYRAMID OF GIZA IS CURRENTLY ANDTHOSE UNDERNEATH MAY BE CONNECTED TO THE SPHINX. ANDTHAT LEAVES THE HUGE MYSTERY: WHO WAS AROUND 7,000 TO10,000 YEARS AGO.What was going on? And you said the pyramids built on prior pyramids. I don'tknow for certain that they were pyramids or platforms of other structures. If Ican mention one other thing, we - being John West and I - when we were inEgypt this past summer, we spent some time at Dashur where there are alsopyramids, and particularly the so-called Red Pyramid or North Pyramid. Andthat illustrates exactly the same point. You go into the Red Pyramid at Dashurwhich is traditionally is considered to be slightly older than the Great Pyramidat Giza.You go into it and go through the corridors and go into one chamber and theninto another chamber, all classic Old Kingdom chambers, Old Kingdompyramid, Old Kingdom masonry. No problems there. Then you go into anotherchamber, and you are just struck. It is totally different style made of verydifferent style blocks of larger blocks. They have the aspect of being moreroughly hewn. They seemed to be weathered and I think weathered in such away they would not be weathered once enclosed inside a pyramid. And you're inthis chamber. It's incredibly dramatic once you realize what you're looking atand then you look up and see this beautiful corbeled roof over the chamberwhich is clearly in a different style. Beautifully dressed, smooth rocks that arenot weathered, seems to be classical Old Kingdom style.Bottom line I think this is another case where we have credible evidence that thepyramids at Dashur in Old Kingdom times was built over and around andenclosing a much older structure and they were reusing something that in myopinion was very sacred or important to them in Old Kingdom times. And thatsomething would have gone back to a much older period that you can generallycall a Sphinx Age.WHO WERE THE BUILDERS THEN OF THE SPHINX AND THESEOTHER MUCH OLDER PYRAMIDS?That I can't tell you at the moment. I think that the fact we are establishing thatthe Sphinx is older and there are other structures that are older, too. We'remaking headway, we're making progress in our studies. But I really at this point"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"can't tell you who these people were or what their culture was.OR WHERE THEY CAME FROM.Or where they came from. I'm hoping someday we can. Right now, I just think ofthem as named after the Sphinx as the Sphinx Culture or Sphinx Age.
