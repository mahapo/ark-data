They havea residence time of about 300 years in the atmosphere, soit's going to take a long time. We really have to do twothings. One is we're going to have to learn to live with theworld that has a different climate than it has today. Andwe're going to have to learn how to be more energyefficient.\"- James Baker, Ph.D., Administrator, NOAA,January 7, 2000January 9, 2000 Washington, D. C. - Three massive storms with high windsswept across England and Europe in December knocking down 300 milliontrees in France alone. Scientists told the American Geophysical Union that thepolar wind pattern has changed and \"could be responsible for fiercer winterstorms across western Europe and western North America.\""},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Winds of more than 110 mph flattened more than 10,000 treesin the elegant gardens of Versailles, France, December 1999.Photograph courtesy Chateau of Versailles.What caused the change? Upper atmosphere winds have been blowing in asmaller, stronger circle around the polar region, not moving as far south. Thatmeans warmer temperatures at low altitudes across Europe and Asia clash evenmore strongly with the very cold temperatures above the North Pole. The result:stronger winds that pull heat and moisture from the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.Already, Spain has had a sharp decrease in rainfall.In December, various scientific reports confirmed that 40% of the Arctic NorthPole ice has melted in the past thirty years. That ice melt is diluting someAtlantic Ocean currents which could end up affecting the North Atlantic Drift.That drift brings warm water from the tropics to the British Isles and Europe.The strange possibility exists that in a steadily warming world, Europe couldbecome cooler.Melted Arctic ice in winter is shown in light blue in this satellite image.Snow cover is gray. Photograph courtesy NOAA, January 1995.The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, known as NOAA, andthe United Kingdom Meteorological Office in London recently issued a jointalert about global warming trends. The official letter states: \"The rapid rate ofwarming since 1976 of .35 degrees Fahrenheit per decade is consistent with theprojected rate of warming based on human-induced effects. In fact, scientistsnow say that they cannot explain this unusual warmth without including theeffects of human- generated greenhouse gases and aerosols. ...We must learn tolive with the likely consequences: more extreme weather, rising sea levels,changing precipitation patterns, ecological and agricultural dislocations and theincreased spread of human disease.\"The letter is jointly signed by James Baker, Ph.D., Administrator, United StatesNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Washington, D. C. andPeter Ewins, Chief Executive Officer of the United Kingdom MeteorologicalOffice in London. I talked with Dr. Baker about what provoked the jointstatement.Interview:James Baker, Ph.D., Administrator, U. S. National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration, Washington, D. C: \"The precipitating thing wasthe release of the temperature records for 1999. We found globally it was thefifth warmest year on record and in fact, for the U. S., the second warmest. Itwas a similar thing for the United Kingdom. And we felt, both Peter Ewins and I"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"felt, that this was significant both in terms of the fact that the temperature hasbeen warming throughout the last 20 years at a rate which is fully consistentwith what the global warming theories say. So, we thought it was an importantpoint to make.With these three recent storms in December across Europe, the last twobeing the strongest and doing so much damage, especially in Paris, it seemsconsistent with reading I have done in NOAA and GISS (Goddard Institutefor Space Studies) in New York about greater instability in the upperstratospheric temperatures. The upper is getting colder while theatmosphere nearer the earth is getting warmer. That sets up instability anda potential for greater energy in storms. Would the three recent Europeanstorms fit that category?There certainly was a lot of instability, as you say, in that storm. It was a verypowerful one. The last time we saw something like that was in 1988 when therewas a big storm that hit England. And there were two storms that hit France -very concentrated and very strong.You can never ascribe any one storm to global warming because that's a gradualchange. But there's no question that you expect to see a world where it isstormier, wetter and drier - all the extremes get stronger when you go into thisworld where there is more energy being absorbed by the increased greenhousegasses.I think it's important for us to learn how to use energy efficiently to try to reduceour greenhouse gasses that we put in the atmosphere. There are a lot of thingswe can do. And I think we have to work very closely with other countries. Chinaand India, in particular, as they grow and start to use more energy to raise theirstandard of living, we need to give them the technology so they can do that in avery energy-efficient way. It can be done. We're doing it now, but I think it isvery important for us to help these countries to do a leapfrog of the oldtechnologies.It's my understanding that the amount of carbon dioxide going into theatmosphere is at a level that even if we stopped all industrial productionnow, we would still see over the next 100 years an increase in averageglobal temperature to perhaps as much as six or more degrees Fahrenheit.There's no question that greenhouse gasses are there, that they are going toincrease and even if we started action now, it takes a long time for them to comeout. They have a residence time of about 300 years in the atmosphere, so it'sgoing to take a long time. So, we really have to do two things. One is we're goingto have to learn to live with the world that has a different climate than we havetoday. And we're going to have to learn how to be more energy efficient.What do you say to countries such as India, Thailand and South Americawho say, 'You industrialized countries have had your air conditioners andappliances. Now we want the same ability?' Such increasing energydemands will intensify the greenhouse gas problem, won't it?What we're saying to them now - and we're doing this jointly with industry - isthat as you put in new industry and as you provide more appliances and energyuse, try to make this as carbon-free as possible. And that way, they'll be able toleap frog some of the difficulties that the developed countries already wentthrough.Now, that doesn't solve the whole problem. But at least it makes everybodyaware and it slows it down so that as we look for other technical solutions, wecan find a way to do that. In the end, what we hope to do is to find some waysthat we can increase our energy use without putting carbon into the atmosphere.We don't know the answer yet, but at least if we can be as efficient as possibleand we can get these countries that are growing rapidly to do the same thing,"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"that will be a big help.One of the criticisms has been that this particular administration(Clinton/Gore) has not been aggressive in leading the way in terms ofreducing greenhouse gases enough in terms of the industrialized world.That was the main criticism at the Kyoto conference.There's no question that the United States right now is the major emitter andthere are a lot of things we can do. The Administration has proposed a numberof things that might be done to the Energy Department. We've proposed BTUtaxes, a variety of things that might have an impact. But Congress has in factrefused to act on any of these and I think it's partly because the Congress isreflecting a public view that this is less of a problem than it really is. I think thisis a real issue. We need to get the American public aware that this is a seriousissue for all of us and that we need to do something about it.I think there were more tornadoes in the last two to three years than in theentire previous century. Then Hurricane Floyd dumped flood waters alongthe East Coast. Does NOAA project that the numbers of hurricanes andtornadoes will increase with more energy?We have definitely seen more tornadoes in the last couple of years. That's a fact.Whether that's a global warming effect or not, it's hard to say. But the hurricanes- we saw more tropical storms in the last five years than we have seen at anytime in recorded history. We're definitely on the upswing in terms of numbers oftropical storms. And we've seen some very, very strong ones. In fact, this pastyear we got more strong hurricanes than we've seen in a very long time. And it isalso true that as you add these greenhouse gasses and put more energy into theenvironment, that feeds the energy of these things. It's something where the twothings go toget her.Do you see a projection over the next 30 years in which wind systems alonecould keep on exceeding 200 mph?This is a good question. I don't have a strong answer for that. But wind and windspeed is something our scientific researchers are looking into very carefully. Wehave a better understanding of how the temperatures change at this point. Butwe are very concerned about that and that's one of the subjects we have beenstudying.If the energy systems increase with greater instability in a global warmingatmosphere, isn't the time approaching when insurance companies aregoing to say to coastal residents, 'We cannot afford to insure any more.'And shouldn't this issue be a big political priority in Congress?Well, it should. There's no question that the insurance companies are veryconcerned that the losses due to weather-related disasters have been rapidlyrising. You have more people living on the coast. You've got more expensivehomes. So this is something where the insurance companies are vulnerable. Theyhave been helping us in terms of doing research and trying to understand thesystems and trying to improve our forecasts. This is a segment of industry that isvery concerned.They are having increased losses every year because of the number of storms andbecause we have more people living in vulnerable area. And they have formedsome pretty strong coalitions that come to Congress and try to do somethingabout it. Insurance companies are a very important part of our economic stabilityin the United States and they are being listened to.Why isn't Congress listening?It's hard to say. I can't really give you an answer about how Congress makes itsdecisions, but I hope we will find some progress on these issues in the next fewyears."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Do you think it's going to take a catastrophe beyond anything we haveimagined so far?Well, sometimes catastrophes are ways to get action. We've certainly seen thatafter some of the major hurricanes. That was one of the reasons to write thisletter (alert)- that we get enough awareness, some real action without having tosuffer a major catastrophe.U. S. Navy submarine USS Pogy during a recent Arctic missionto study accelerated Arctic ice melt. Photograph courtesy U. S. Navy.The Arctic - in December there was the report that 40% of the North Arctic icehas now melted. I talked with GISS in New York a couple of weeks ago andtheir projection is that if the current melt rate persists, there will be no Arctic icein summers at the North Pole in another thirty years. That would be 2029 to2030. If the Arctic ice is completely gone, that would dilute the salt content insome of the ocean currents, especially the North Atlantic Drift which provideswarm water from the Tropics to the British Isles and Europe. Are you concernedat this point about the North Atlantic Drift changing?This has been one of the big issues because our models - although they arecertainly not complete as far as oceans are concerned - all seem to say that asyou add greenhouse gasses and change things like the Arctic ice, it's verypossible that you could change some of these major currents. That changes theheat that goes to Europe. It certainly could lead to things like little Ice Ages andother things. Whether this happens is still a question. But like you, I was veryconcerned to hear that the ice pack in the Arctic is diminishing with these veryaccurate new measurements that we have - another indication that we areprobably seeing a global warming effect.I think every scientist I've talked to would agree with that and anotherarea of deep concern is that the Wilkins and Larsen B ice shelves in theAntarctic melted enough in the summer of 1999 to open up ice on land tomore sun. If that continues and ice on the Antarctic mainland melts intothe sea, that will raise ocean levels.Yeah, exactly. And of course, we've been concerned about that for a long time.If you get this ice which is currently on land melting and then running into theocean, not only does it change the salinity, but it also changes the sea level. So,we've been following this whole question of the ice melting in the Antarctic verycarefully.What kind of response do you get from the administration officials whenyou present this data and say we have a very serious problem that's goingto continue to affect us decade after decade?The Clinton Administration has been very interested and supportive of all theseissues and as you know, Al Gore has been a leader in identifying global warmingas a very serious issue for a long time. He identified this as something we had tobe very serious about.And as I say, the Administration has proposed a number of energy measures,addressing both new technology and trying to reduce energy use and so on."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"None of them have gone very far in the Congress, but I would say that we havean Administration that is very aware of the problem and would like to see someaction.Are you personally dismayed that all of this cannot happen faster?Well, faster would be better, there's no question about that.\"More Information:In November 2000 - the next big global climate conference will be theFramework Convention on Climate Change in the Hague, The Netherlands. Thatwill be the major meeting this year where countries will come together from allover the world to discuss what can be done to better understand, mitigate, anddevelop technologies to cope with climate change.One technology that has been endorsed by the Sierra Club is the Honda Insight,a hybrid car that combines solar electric power with gas to get 70 miles pergallon. The Sierra Club honored the Honda hybrid with its first Excellence inEnvironmental Engineering Award in Los Angeles on January 7th. Honda'sInsight is priced at about $20,000 and is the first hybrid to be sold in the UnitedStates. Sierra Club Executive Director Carl Pope presented the award \"becausethe auto industry is finally moving to produce vehicles that represent a majorstep forward in improving the environment.\"We b s it e s :http://www.noaa.govCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
