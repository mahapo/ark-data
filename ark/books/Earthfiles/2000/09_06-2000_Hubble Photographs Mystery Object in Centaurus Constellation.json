It is giving off large jet pulsesthat are more typical of star births. But there is also an accretion disk of gas anddust often associated with a dying star. The paradox of birth and deathcharacteristics is forcing a re-evaluation of what has been considered a planetarynebula since the 1990s.Interview:IF IT IS NOT A STAR BEING BORN, WHAT IS IT?The most likely scenario we can think of right now is that this is a pair of stars.And the reason why we think it might be a pair of stars is because we want to"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"explain how the jets are formed. Usually jets like these which are seen in theuniverse including young stars and centers of galaxies- they are the result of arotating disc of matter around a compact object. And this is called an 'accretiondisc.' And to produce an accretion disc, you normally require matter fromsomewhere to collect around a compact object. And so, you need somethingthat gives out matter and something that collects matter. So, that's why werequire a pair of stars, a pair which is called a 'binary star system.' Two starsgoing around, orbiting each other. For one star to be able to suck matter fromanother star, the following has to happen:First, the two stars have to be very close to each other, roughly about 10astronomical units from each other (one A.U. is the distance between earth andthe sun).Second, one star has to have an atmosphere which is very loosely bound,gravitationally loosely bound. And such stars are red giant stars which are dyingstars. A star like the sun would be a red giant star 5 billion years from now.Third, the star that is sucking the matter towards it has to be fairly compactobject, but roughly as the same mass as the other star so they have a very stronggravitational field. The most common compact objects are white dwarfs.So that's how we hypothesize that the central part is a binary star with a whitedwarf collecting matter from the outer layers of the red giant, gathering it into arotating disc around it. As matter falls inwards into the disc, some of it is slungoutwards along magnetic field lines and then produces the jet-like streams ofmatter.HAVE YOU EVER SEEN JETS LIKE THIS IN A DYING STAR SYSTEMBEFORE?Nothing like this, no. That was what was the big amazement which we had. Ihave used the Hubble quite extensively to look at many dying stars and we'veseen many mysterious and beautiful shapes and structures, but we've never seensuch a jet-like structure.IS IT POSSIBLE THAT THIS IS NOT A DYING BINARY STARSYSTEM?It has to have at least one dying star in it, we think, in order to produce thejet-like streams of matter and it requires an accretion disc, the rotating disc ofmaterial. In order to produce a rotating disc of material, you have to get materialfrom somewhere. That somewhere, the most likely possibility is a red giant star.We don't have other possibilities.Now, the companion that is orbiting around it could be something else, could besomething else even more compact like a neutron star or black hole. However,to the best of our knowledge, we think we need a binary star system.In the case of young stars, you don't need the binary star system because theaccretion disc is there to begin with and has to do with how the star formed fromits parent cloud. So that automatically generates a disc of material. That's why inyoung stars, we don't need binary stars to produce the jets.YOU'VE ELIMINATED THE YOUNG STAR POSSIBILITY?We've eliminated the young star for two reasons: the strongest one is that we seevery hot gas around this object. In fact, the gas is so hot that the hydrogen atomsin the gas have been stripped of their electrons. So they are just basicallyprotons and other atoms such as oxygen, nitrogen have also been stripped oftheir outer electrons, so it's ionized gas.SIMILAR TO THE PLASMA OF LIGHTNING?Exactly! That's a plasma. Exactly."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"A HOT PLASMA.To produce plasma, it requires very energetic radiation which you can get fromstars that are very hot. So, based on the characteristics of the gasses you can seearound them and we can see emissions from different things like ionizedhydrogen and ionized oxygen and ionized nitrogen, we can tell that the centralobject that is illuminating this has to be about 50,000 degrees. And young starslike the sun during the early formation stages are only at best a few thousanddegrees.WHAT ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS IS A BLACK HOLE?That possibility is always there. Black holes are very exciting and notoriouslyhard to correctly say, 'Yes, this is a black hole.' As you know, black holes don'tallow any light to escape from them. So you can never directly see the presenceof a black hole. You can only see them indirectly. If there was a black hole,there would still be an accretion disc around the black hole and as the matterfell from the outer areas of the accretion disc inward into the black hole, someof it would be flung out before it got ingested into the black hole.In an accretion disc, that's what happens. Not all the matter which is flowinginwards gets ejected out. Only some small fraction, a few percent of it, getsthrown out along magnetic field lines. So you will see jets even if at the centerof the accretion disc there was a black hole. Some part of the matter would beejected before it got into the black hole.There are reasons why we think it is unlikely to be a black hole because of thespeed of the jets. Right now, we only have indirect measurements that indicatethe speed of the jets are moving at about 150 to 200 kilometers per secondwhich, by other physical standards, is kind of slow for a jet. And the speed of ajet is directly related to how fast the matter is falling inwards in the accretiondisc. So, if you have a black hole, the matter will fall much faster as it getscloser to the black hole, close to the speed of light basically. So the jets youwould expect to come out from a disc around a black hole would be closer tothe speed of light. So, it seems unlikely that the companion in He2-90 is a blackhole.However, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, which is one of NASA'sgamma ray observatories in space, was surveying the whole sky a few years agoand found a gamma ray source in the direction of this object. The reason I saythe direction is because gamma ray observatory could only tell the position to alimited accuracy. It's in the general direction of He2-90, but we don't knowwhether it's actually physically associated with it or not. We need much moreprecise measurements of the position of the gamma ray source and we want todo that using NASA's X-ray Observatory (Chandra), the argument being that ifthere is a gamma ray source, it's probably also emitting x-rays and we canmeasure the position of x-rays with the Chandra Observatory much moreaccurately. Then we will definitely be able to say if there is an x-ray sourcethere and if it's associated with He2-90.IF IT IS A BLACK HOLE.If it is x-rays, the companion would be more compact than a white dwarf. Thenext most compact star after a white dwarf is a neutron star. And so, it couldstill be a neutron star. And then down from a neutron star, the next mostcompact object is a black hole.HUBBLE IS PHOTOGRAPHING AN EVENT THAT TOOK PLACE8,000 YEARS AGO?Yes, the light which we are seeing right now started out about 8,000 years agofrom this objec which we estimate is about 8,000 light years away. Which meansthe distance from us to this object is so great that light will take 8,000 years to"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"come from there to us. So, whatever light we are seeing right now started 8,000years ago. Therefore, it's quite possible - certainly in the case of the jets whichmay be a phenomenon that lasted only a few hundred years - that the jets nolonger are there.HOW DO WE EVER KNOW WHAT THE UNIVERSE ACTUALLYLOOKS LIKE?In this instant?YES.No, we can never know that. If the sun went off this instant, we would still see itshining for 8.5 minutes because that's how long it takes for light to get here. Thenearest star which is Alpha Centauri - if it were turned off, we would see itshining for four and a half years.ARE QUASARS EVEN IN PHYSICAL EXISTENCE TODAY?Quasars are very bright light sources and today we know that most of thosebright light sources are at the centers of galaxies. It's quite possible quasars attheir great distance are no longer shining.IT'S REALLY ODD BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST ALICE INWONDERLAND THAT SO MUCH OF THE UNIVERSE MAY NOT BETHERE PHYSICALLY, BUT THE LIGHT IS ITS LEGACY ANDTHAT'S THE ONLY THING WE SEE.Yes. Absolutely. The universe is far more mysterious than anything we everconceived of even in our wildest fantasies! That is part of the great excitement Ifind in studying the universe. It's so much more amazing and wonderful andmysterious than anything you've even conceived of, and even science fictionwriters have conceived of! It's so much more amazing.WHAT ELSE PROVOKES YOU AS A MYSTERY BESIDES THISCURRENT HUBBLE PHOTOGRAPH.I have mostly studied dying stars. And dying stars or planetary nebulae come ina very vast array of beautiful symmetries, shapes and sizes. It's a tremendousmystery about why stars that are round ultimately end up throwing out matterthat looks so strange instead of making round bubbles.When I started my imaging survey with Hubble, I was hoping to find answers tothe mystery and I got ten times more puzzles and questions than answers. Infact, the best theory we had for explaining these kind of things would no longerwork any more. So, in my field that's what I've found the most exciting.It's also important to remember that most of the carbon in the universe isproduced in dying stars. They produce carbon inside them and then eject it,throw it out, into the interstellar medium which collects and makes littleparticles which make systems and people like us. It's from death springs life, soto speak. Really without these kinds of stars, life as we know it - which is carbonbased - would not exist without dying stars to manufacture carbon.WE REALLY ARE STAR DUST?Oh, absolutely! In a very strong sense of the word. Each little carbon atom inour body was manufactured in one of these dying stars.And if you get to a more philosophical level, ultimately the greatest mystery iswhere did our universe come from? And that is the beginning of a series ofunanswerable questions. For example, suppose we learned this universe came"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"from something called X. The next question is, 'Where did X come from?' Thereis no end.COMING BACK TO THE HUBBLE OBJECT, WHAT IS THE NEXTSTEP IN YOUR RESEARCH IN TERMS OF TRYING TOUNDERSTAND WHAT THIS MYSTERIOUS OBJECT MIGHT BE?We are contemplating at this moment three sets of observations:1) More extensive observations with Hubble, especially the first thing we'd liketo do is take more images and see if the knots in the jets have moved. And thatwill give us some idea how fast the jet is actually moving. If it is moving at onlya few hundred kilometers per second and it's at the distance we think it is, thenwe won't see the knots move at all. But if it's moving at something like athousand kilometers a second, which is what it should be if the companion is awhite dwarf, then we should see movement of the knots.We'll also take spectra which allow us to separate the light out and use theDoppler affect and measure the speed of moving gas. Together we should beable to tell better what speed the jet is. That's what we want to do with Hubble.2) We also want to use the Chandra X-ray Observatory to look in that directionand see if there is an x-ray source. If there is, then is it associated with He2-90 ornot? If we see x-rays and depending on how hot the x-ray spectrum is we shouldbe able to tell something about the companion, the compact object.WHETHER OR NOT IT COULD BE A BLACK HOLE?Yeah, what it could be.3) And the third thing we want to do is there is a European Gamma RayObservatory called Integra which is supposed to go up in a couple of years, sowe would like to use that again to look at the gamma ray source. It will be ableto look at gamma ray sources much more precisely than the NASA Chandraobservatory.HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE TO DO ALL THREE OF THESE?We have to go through the process to get our proposals accepted.YOU GET FUNDING FROM?Through NASA.\"We b s it e s :http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/pictures/wfpcCredits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
