One of two formations about 200 feet diameterdiscovered in barley at 5 AM on June 11, 2000 near Silbury Hill inWiltshire, England. The two fresh formations were only about 150feet apart. Photograph © 2000 by Peter R. Sorensen.June 11, 2000 Silbury Hill, Wiltshire, England - Photographer PeterSorensen has been photographing the mysterious crop formations in Englandsince 1992, both on the ground and in the air. He is back in Wiltshire, Englandfor the 2000 crop formation season and e-mailed today:E-mail from Peter: \"Thanks to an e-mail tip from someone who was driving towork at 5 a.m. this Sunday morning, I was able to promptly visit two newformations between Silbury Hill and the Waggon and Horses pub. Both are over200 feet in diameter in barley. ...\"Now to see if I can possibly fly tomorrow. At least SOMEbody was above in ahelicopter, so the twin formations have been documented before they aredestroyed by tourists. There were about 50 people traipsing around during thetime I was there and a couple of them walked thoughtlessly through the cropfrom one circle to the other. The farmer is charging two pounds to go in, a quida piece. A fair deal!\"I called Peter in Stanton St. Bernard for more details about his visit to the twoSilbury Hill formations created in the same field in which the huge WingedSolar Disk formation emerged last year on June 19, 1999.Interview:Peter R. Sorensen, Videotape Photographer, Stanton St. Bernard,Wiltshire, England: \"I quickly arranged to get a ride out over there and what Ifound was - it's like two squares overlapping each other in such a way you canget a blunt 8-pointed star and surrounding that are several rings going outward.Total diameter of the thing is well over 200 feet."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Diagram of 8-pointed \"star\" formation discovered June 11, 2000 at Silbury Hillnear the second formation of a triangle inside the hexagon. Diagram © 2000 by Peter R.Sorensen.And very curiously, the way the crop was laid down in this 8-pointed star isthere were several, maybe 100 different clumps that were still standing up in theflattened crop and seven of those clumps had little swirls around them. I'venever seen anything like that before.One of nearly 100 different clumps of barley left standing in the 8-pointed star.Oddly, only seven of the many clumps were surrounded by very deliberate swirls like thisphotograph.All the clumps seemed to be distributed randomly within the formation.Photograph © 2000 by Peter R. Sorensen.So, that's formation number 1. Formation Number 2 which is higher up on thebrow of the hill and you couldn't see what the design was until you walked upthere. This formation consists of a flattened circle about 60 feet in diameter andsurrounding it is a standing triangle and surrounding that is a flattened hexagon.Now, this is all contained within two broad rings, so the ultimate size of thisformation ends up being about as large as the other which is 200 feet plus.Camera raised on pole inside the hexagon formation on June 11, 2000 with Silbury Hill inbackground,now closed off by Britain's National Trust because a 50 foot by 6 foot hole has opened upon top."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"See story at earthfiles.com.

And even though theyare quite similar in some ways, on the whole each seems to have very differentflavors. Either different entities made them or who knows? I don't think thesewere made by the same source or people or hedgehogs or little green men orwhatever is making these crop circles. There seems to be two different artisticflavors to them.WHICH ONE DID YOU PERSONALLY RESONATE WITH THEMOST?Definitely the triangle and circle. Not the 8-sided one. The hexagon was the firstone I came to and also this was so beautifully laid out. There were hardly anystanding, except for an occasional magical standing stalks. That's what I callthem, those lovely single standing stalks. No, it was all very neatly flattened tofill in even here and there diamond shapes and circles within the lay. Verybeautifully done.THE HEXAGON.Ye s ."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"THE EIGHT-SIDED, THE TWO SQUARES DOWN OVER EACHOTHER - IT ALMOST SOUNDS LIKE THERE WAS MORE CHAOTICENERGY INVOLVED GIVEN ALL OF THOSE RANDOMLY PLACEDSTANDING STALKS WITH THE SWIRLS.Absolutely. Absolutely. That was very chaotic. Maybe that's what I didn't feel Iliked about that one.WHAT ABOUT THE MYSTERIOUS FORMATION ACROSS THEROAD AT THE WEST KENNETT LONG BARROW THAT YOU FIRSTREPORTED ON JUNE 2ND? COULD YOU DESCRIBE THATTRANSFORMATION THAT TOOK PLACE AND THE INTERESTINGISSUE OF SOMEBODY TRYING TO DESTROY THE FIRSTVERSION? WHAT HAPPENED?Right, this went through some stages of evolution which is unusual, but it'shappened before. The formation when it was first found was about the same sizeas the others - over 200 feet in diameter, but was almost all standing crop withthin lines used to define a 12-sided figure around the outside. Actually 12 littletriangles, very shallow triangles, going all the way around the outside. And then,inside of that was a very thin ring and a very thin flattened lines making atriangle in the center of all standing crops. There were just these thin lines andthin little triangles around the outside.About it being rough, the first people in it that morning reported that it lookedas though somebody tried to trash it. The lay of the crop circles are usually quitesmooth and going in one direction. This was as if somebody had been walkingbackwards against those lines, messing up all the crop. The guy said to me, 'Nohoaxer in his right mind would ever do this to their own artwork!' So, this mustbe somebody who was intentionally trying to damage the thing.THEN BY THE NEXT DAY?Then the design matured tremendously, getting large flattened areas which tookthat large standing central triangle and cut small flattened triangles into it. Bythe way, it has a lot of the same flavor as the new one today which has thetriangle and the hexagon.THAT'S WHAT I WAS GOING TO ASK YOU.Yeah, same family.IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS FIRST ONE AT THE WEST KENNETT LONGBARROW ACROSS THE ROAD WAS A 12 WHICH IS A DOUBLE OF 6WITH THE TRIANGLE AND NOW YOU'VE GOT THE HEXAGONWHICH IS THE 6 ALSO WITH A TRIANGLE MOTIF. I'VE GOT ONTHE WEB SITE AT EARTHFILES.COM YOUR BEAUTIFULPHOTOGRAPH OF IT AFTER THE TRANSFORMATION AND THERECONSTRUCTION THAT YOU DID LABORIOUSLY WHICH I AMGRATEFUL BECAUSE IT GIVES US A CLEAR IDEA WHAT IT WAS 24HOURS BEFORE AND RAISES THE MYSTERIOUS QUESTION OFWHO TRIED TO DAMAGE? AND THEN WHAT CAME BACK ANDWENT MANY STEPS FURTHER IN THE COMPLEXITY?That's right. As if somebody tried to damage it and then the original circleintelligence said, 'OK, then try to damage this!' and then flattened about TENtimes as much crop beautifully again. Yeah, it's very unusual. But remember the"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"web formation we had at Avebury several years ago. That one also was done intwo stages. On the first night, the lines went down. And on the second night, thelarger areas were flattened.I'M CURIOUS IN THE PROCESS OF PHOTOGRAPHING THESEFORMATIONS, WHAT IS IN YOUR MIND AND YOUR SOUL INRELATIONSHIP TO WHAT THE PURPOSE MIGHT BE FROM YOURPOINT OF VIEW NOW OF THESE CONTINUING FORMATIONS,SOMETIMES GEOMETRIC, AND SOMETIMES NOT? AND THISISSUE OF SOMETHING PERHAPS IN CONFLICT OR WITH ATLEAST TWO DIFFERENT INTENTS PLACING THESE FORMATIONSDOWN, NOT ONLY IN ENGLAND, BUT IN GERMANY AND MANYOTHER PLACES?My sort of philosophy or understanding as best as it is of the crop circlephenomenon is that some intelligence interested in mankind is bringing us these maybe they are messages, but at the very least they are like visual music. Theyare harmonies that are good for the soul to look at. And it's affecting millions ofpeople in the world, these designs, one way or another, making people start toask questions they might never have asked before. A UFO is a fleeting thing andmaybe you get a blurry picture of it and it doesn't affect people unless theyreally want to be. But crop circles are really beautiful. When you see a picture,you can't ignore it. No matter what you think made the crop circles like I said,whether it's hedgehogs or little green men, it moves your spirit so beautifully. Itdoes that for me and I thank the circle makers for leaving humanity better offwith these messages. And it may well be, of course, that there are some reallyastonishing times ahead of us here in the year 2000 and up to the year 2012.This is an extremely important time in our evolution. So, something is singing tous.YOU ARE PICKING 2012 AS THE CLOSE OF THE GRAND MAYANCALENDAR, FOR EXAMPLE?Right, I think that is more important than the year 2000. Pope Gregory and hisGregorian Calendar is not exactly based on the birth of Jesus and, I think theMayan Calendar is much more ancient, much more probably fundamental toreality, this slice of reality we're in. You know, the crop circles may affect a fewmillion people on the planet, but that's not a lot of people. But what it might beis just the exact amount necessary, the straw to take off the camel's back so thecamel doesn't break its back, right? Just the right amount to get us through theeye of the needle.ENOUGH CONSCIOUSNESS IN A CERTAIN NUMBER OF PEOPLE.That's right.PAYING ATTENTION.Ye s .EVEN IF THE REST OF THE WORLD IS COMPLETELY OBLIVIOUSTO ALL THESE FORMATIONS THAT ARE NOW IN SEVERALCOUNTRIES. WHAT IF THIS IS REALLY BEING DONE BYFREQUENCIES THAT ARE BEYOND WHERE WE ARE NOW?Oh, sure. Actually, the more time I've spent with these crop circles, the less I'vebegun sure at all what the actual source of the intelligence is. Sure, all sorts ofdimensional - angels. God's probably been looking out for the universe since"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Square One.
