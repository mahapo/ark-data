The date was 21st July. It was around 8:00-9:00pm. This was the day I just arrived to England and the first complex formation Iwalked in. There wasn't anything unusual. The sun was going down and I thinkthe sun was on my front left hand side. I was with my friends (3 Japanese) andthere were two men and a woman in there with me. But when I took thisphotograph, I was alone. This was (my) first time to see and be in cropformations.My camera is: Olympus digital camera (CAMEDIA 2.1 Megapixel)Model No. C-990 ZOOM DC6V"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Wheat formation near Lockeridge Dene, Wiltshire, Englandin which Amica saw and photographed light spiral on July 21, 2000, two daysafter the formation's discovery on July 19th. Aerial photograph © 2000 by SteveAlexander.Amica reported about her photograph for the German Association for CropCircle Research and wrote:\"It was beautiful formation. I was so impressed by my first visitingcrop circles. The formation looks as if it has three blades and thereare spiral crops on each blade. I sat down on one of the spiral crops.At once, I felt something spiral energy through all my body. It was socomfortable. After a while, I tried to take a photo. When I looked atthe monitor of my digital camera, I saw an amazing image. There wasspiral light turning above the centre. In a hurry, I took the photo.\"Amica said the light swirled, moving and turning, for two or threeseconds before she took the photograph. Her friends did not see thelight. \"After taken this spiral light, I doubted my eyes and tried totake it again. On purpose, I tried to get sunlight somehow in themonitor. But I couldn't because the sun was far left hand side andfrom my standing position, it was impossible to get it (in frame.)\"My purpose of visiting England this time was to see crop circles. Isaw many circles and took a very interesting photo, but I wonder...What does this mean? What I got? Has the crop circle or my photomeaning or purpose? I think the answer is yes. It has a meaning foreach one. You can take it as you like. It is not for particular person,but for everyone. At once, it has no meaning and a lot of meaning.Crop circles are transient and last for a little while until disappear atharvest. Nobody knows the truth. However, why people is sofascinated? And me, too. It is so beautiful, amazing and mysterious.The photo? I think it is one of a guide for my spirituality.\"We b s it e s :http://www.fgk.org/00/Berichte/amica/http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"earthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
