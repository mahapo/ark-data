The politically unspeakable are unidentified aerial craft in earth skies,even when there are multiple eyewitnesses. One example of such an incident hasbeen investigated over the past year by Martin Jasek of the UFO BritishColumbia group who lives in White Horse of the Yukon Territory in Canada.There are only 30,000 residents in the entire Yukon and at least thirty-oneeyewitnesses near Pelling Crossing saw an aerial craft estimated to have beennearly a mile long hovering silently about 300 feet above the ground.Map of mile long aerial craft's path on December 11, 1996observed by 31 eyewitnesses © 2000 by Martin Jasek, UFO British Columbia (UFOBC).The incident occurred on December 11, 1996, but it was not until this year thata summary report with eyewitness drawings was assembled by Yukoninvestigator Martin Jasek for UFOBC.

I was all bymyself and it was probably around 8:30 or quarter to 9 at night. As I waswalking along my trap line, I came into a very small clearing in the bush and Iwas coming downhill when I came to this clearing and off to my right, I saw alight. I thought to myself, 'Oh, a 747 or a big plane is coming down.' But then,when I continued to look at it, it was moving very, very slowly and I realizedthat it wasn't an airplane and I had myself an encounter with a UFO. So, I turnedto my right where the object was and as I turned, the flashlight that I had slungfrom my waist pointed in that direction. At the first sighting of the UFO, it wasprobably three-quarters to a mile off. When I turned and the flashlight pointingin that direction, then the object moved towards me very rapidly. It stoppedprobably about 300 yards in front of me after I put my hand over my flashlight.Right out of the center of it, a beam came down at 45 degrees pointing forwardin the direction it was moving. Then it did a sweep to about 45 degrees back.Then it went out. Also, too, out of the front of the object was some kind ofgreen light and I could see it very clearly because of the ice crystals in the air.And out of the back of the object was two white lights that were shining downin behind the object and then they slowly rotated up until they were completelylevel with the object. It was moving I would say between 5 and 10 mph and itwas moving slowly to my right. And on the object itself, there was a long line oflights. They were square. They weren't round. They were rectangular. They wereabout 9 feet high and probably about 20 feet long.Computer graphic based on eyewitness Don Trudeau who was walking his trap line severalmiles from any roads in the wilderness and up high enough to be at eye level with thestrange and immense aerial craft © 2000 by Martin Jasek, UFOBC.COULD YOU MAKE SOME COMMENTS NOW SO THAT ANAUDIENCE COULD GET SOME SENSE OF THE SIZE OF THIS INRELATIONSHIP TO YOU AND THE ENVIRONMENT?Yes, I would estimate it was about 3/4's of a mile long. It could have beenlonger. But where I was standing when it was close to me, I could not look atthe whole thing. I had to turn my head from side to side.THREE QUARTERS OF A MILE LONG AND ABOUT HOW CLOSE TOTHE TREETOPS OR THE ROAD OR TO YOU WAS IT HANGING?It was probably hovering about 250 feet or 300 feet up and because I was on ahillside, I was almost looking straight level with it, maybe had my gaze up just atiny little bit. And there was no noise, no humming, nothing coming out of thismachine."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"IT'S SUCH AN ENORMOUS THING TO BE SO LOW AND FORTHERE NOT TO BE ANY SOUND. WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TOTHAT FACT THAT IT WAS SILENT?At first, I guess you could say I was standing there with my mouth open justlooking at it. But at no time did I have any fear of this. At no time was I otherthan awe of something so huge.\"Martin Jasek is a civil engineer with a masters degree in Water Resources. Whenhe started his investigation for UFO British Columbia a year ago, he had no ideathere wee so many eyewitnesses who had watched the giant aerial craft forseveral minutes.Martin Jasek, Civil Engineer and UFOBC Investigator, White Horse,Yukon Territory, Canada: \"I couldn't believe it as it was unraveling. You startwith one phone call and it kept getting more and more detailed. Every person Italked to was really down to earth and not looking for attention. I had toconvince some of them to talk about what they had seen.Two cousins were driving in two different vehicles about a mile apart from eachother. It was about 8:30 in the evening and they were going along a highway thatis adjacent to a lake. The lake is on the left hand side and there is this huge UFOthat comes over from the other side. They slam on the brakes and skate to astop. The first fellow in front gets out of the vehicle and he's watching the thingmove slowly towards his side of the lake. Now, his cousin is about a quarter of amile back from him and he doesn't want to go further because if he goes towhere his cousin is he'll be right in the path of this UFO, so he stops furtherback. He watches this huge UFO go over his cousin and off over the right andthe hills. A drawing based on that report is included in our report.Computer graphic based on Fox Lake eyewitnesses who watched the mile long aerial craftfor at least five minutes © 2000 by Martin Jasek, UFOBC.A brother and sister were just driving into Pelly. It would have been about 8miles from where Don was and they were looking north and they saw this hugerow of lights traveling over the hills on the other side of the village. It was justenormous in size and pulled over. The woman was very smart in that shecompared the size or length of the lights to the Big Dipper which happened tobe right above it. And it was the same length as the Big Dipper. And the BigDipper takes up 25 degrees of the sky.Then there were also four women taking an evening course at a college and theywere out on a break and they watched lights coming from the west and goingnorth in Don Trudeau's direction. They did drawings as well.Then there was a fellow I just learned about recently. He was walking over thebridge and coming back from hockey game practice and he saw this huge row of"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"lights approaching him and got scared and laid down on the deck of the bridgeface down. And then at one point he looked up and right above him and it wasthere and looked back down until it was gone.HE ACTUALLY LAID DOWN?Yes. That's what his grandmother told me. He was 13 years old, pretty shakenup. I haven't talked to him.All these people saw the same thing over the same spot. we were able tocalculate the size from the triangulation and we had a good angle this timebecause it was compared to the big dipper.THAT ESTIMATE TURNED OUT TO BE HOW BIG?Between 1 and 2 kilometers, about a mile.A MILE IN DIAMETER. IT'S HARD REALLY FOR US HUMANS USETO SEEING CRAFT IN THE SKY THAT ARE ONLY 200 OR 300 FEETLONG IN AIRLINERS THAT ANYTHING COULD BE A MILE LONGSITTING 250 FEET UP ABOVE TREES AND COMPLETELY SILENT.Yeah, I agree with you. Just stand next to a football stadium and picturesomething 5 times the size.FIVE TIMES THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL STADIUM HOVERING INTHE AIR 250 FEET.Ye a h .WHAT IS IT? AND HOW CAN IT DO THAT COMPLETELYSILENTLY?Exactly. The only one who could see the actual surface texture of it were thetwo cousins at Fox Lake and I think that was the one area where the UFO wasreally close to the ground that enough light was reflecting off the snow toilluminate itself.DID THEY GIVE ANY DETAILS ABOUT WHAT THE SURFACELOOKED LIKE BETWEEN THE LIGHTS?They just said smooth, grey, metallic.ANY CONTACT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT?No, no one that we know of called the police.\"More Information:Martin Jasek's summary of where eyewitnesses lived: \"Fox Lake had 6witnesses.The Village of Carmacks had 9 eyewitnesses. Then north of Carmackswas the Village of Pelly Crossing where Don Trudeau lives and there was a totalof 8 witnesses there. Then there is the Village of Mayo further north and therewas another 8 witnesses at that location. All the same evening, covering an arearoughly 250 miles.\"Copies of Martin Jasek's UFOBC report, \"Giant UFO in the Yukon Territory\" isavailable from:UFOBC"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"11151 Kendale WayDelta, B.
