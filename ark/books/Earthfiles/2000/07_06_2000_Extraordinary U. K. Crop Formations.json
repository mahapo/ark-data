Crop Formations© 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe June 18, 2000, this extraordinary 270 foot diameter formation in wheat was discovered atancientWindmill Hill (3700 B. C.) not far from the sacred Avebury stone circle and avenues.Aerial photograph © 2000 by Francine Blake with her permission.July 6, 2000 Wiltshire, England - By the first week of July 2000, with somuch of the summer yet to unfold, the crop circle mystery has been more globalthan 1999. Thirty-six crop formations have been reported in England, eighteenin Germany, three in The Netherlands, two in Spain, two in Italy, two in the U.S., one in Russia, one in Canada and one in the Czech Republic. In the past twoweeks in England alone, two of the most extraordinary formations of the pastdecade appeared. The checkered one featured at the top of this report emergedin a field of very green immature wheat. Researcher Charles Mallett of Horton,Wiltshire discussed the Windmill Hill pattern at the web site where he and hisartist wife, Frances, produce C & F Phenomenon Research Field Reports.Interview:Charles Mallett, C & F Phenomenon Research Field Reports, Horton,Wiltshire: \"The scale and scope of the design had us, to say the least, ratherbaffled. Standing on the ground in this maze of standing and downed squaresand rectangles was, for quite some time, incomprehensible. This is not aformation to be viewed from ground level. Because the wheat had been brusheddown so gently, most of the crop had returned to an almost upright position verysoon after the formation was discovered. When we arrived on the scene, all wecould see was a vague and rough chequer board pattern that had a strange orderwithin the chaotic downed sections.\"What we have here is a square sectioned into various size chunks of alternatingstanding and downed crop that give the effect of stretch and perspective invarious directions. The sides of the internal square measure 200 feet in length.This checkered square shape sits uniformly inside the 270 foot diameter circle ofdowned crop that creates a very imposing crop circle indeed."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"\"Seeing the aerial image of this formation is simply stunning. It pops right out ofthe ground at you. There is no way we would have expected this effect from theimpression we had at zero elevation.\"June 19, 2000, this 220 foot diameter circle of elegant spokes was discovered in barleyacrossthe road from the famous East Field at Alton Barnes, Wiltshire. Aerial videograph © 2000by Peter R. Sorensen.The next day on June 19, 2000, sixteen elegant spokes around a rose-like centerwere discovered carefully crafted inside a 220 foot diameter circle in barleyacross the road from the famous East Field at Alton Barnes. Charles Mallettnoted in his C & F Phenomenon Research Field Report: \"The paths between thesixteen fans of this design have a very impressive fluid look and feel about themthat continues beneath the downed central area to the very centre of theformation.\"As we studied and took time to examine the formation, we came acrossnumerous examples of severe distortion to some of the seed heads of the barley.One in particular was so affected by whatever process caused the barley to laydown that it had become twisted and distorted, almost beyond recognition.Another seed head had a very well-cooked young snail welded to the scorchedbristles of the affected plant. Most of the heat damage and distortion weobserved was found on the edges and corners of the standing sections that createthe elegant spokes of the formation.\"July 1, 2000, a 6-petalled flower inside a circle in wheat below the Milk Hill White Horsein Alton Barnes, Wiltshire.

If there are twodifferent intelligences, are there two different agendas?There have been a series of 6-petalled flowers over the years in English cropfields, but this is perhaps the most elegant of all. Charles Mallett and I talkedabout the new Milk Hill formation by phone and he wrote in the C & FPhenomenon Research Field Report: \"This formation is situated in almostexactly the same spot as the 1997 fractal snowflake glyph, give or take a fewyards. ...Between the large petals that extend almost to the edge of the innerdowned circle, there are six additional shorter petals that give added body to anotherwise quite simplistic design.\"The lay of the wheat around the flower and throughout the whole formationwas clean and precise. In some areas, we came across junctions in the lay thatwere very tightly woven and bound into knot style twists. Quite impressive. Atthe very centre of the formation where the construction circles cross, there wereseven stalks that had been left standing in a rather delicate little bunch.\"July 2, 2000, this amazing 250 foot diameter formation of 1600 little squares of standingwheat was discoveredat East Kennett near Avebury. Aerial videograph © 2000 by Peter R. Sorensen.The next day on July 2nd at East Kennett near Avebury was a shocker. Sixteenhundred little squares of standing wheat on downed crop were neatly orderedinside a circle. Photographer Peter Sorensen took both a wide shot aerialvideograph and a close-up on the squares and wrote in an e-mail: \"This newformation to the South East of the West Kennett Long Barrow has a new kind of'weave,' very unlike last summer's 1999 'Basket.' This looks more like some kindof cloth.\"Close-up aerial image of a portion of the 1600 little squares that make upthe East Kennett formation near Avebury. Aerial videograph © 2000 by Peter R.
