But this year, NASA's Goddard SpaceFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland reports that already the ozone hole islarger than all of the Antarctic and extends over the southern tip of SouthAmerica. That's 11 million square miles and breaks all previous records. Aspokesman at the United Nations World Meteorological Observation agency inGeneva, Switzerland told reporters: \"It is remarkable to find these low values soearly in September, perhaps one or two weeks earlier than in any previous year.\"NASA scientist, Paul Newman, said, \"We're perhaps beginning to see someevidence of climate change in the stratosphere. Maybe we have to be a littlemore serious about looking at this problem of the interaction of global warmingand stratosphere cooling and ozone loss.\" Increased cooling in the earth'sstratosphere has been linked to the global warming blanket of carbon dioxide inthe lower atmosphere which traps heat at the surface. Will the huge Antarcticozone hole continue to widen through September? No one knows. But allpeople and animals now living beneath that hole without ozone protection facethe risk of increased skin cancers and eye damage. And scientists will bemonitoring the Arctic this winter and spring for evidence of an enlarging ozonehole over the North Pole which could affect the Northern Hemisphere.More Information: "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"This is an October 1999 graphic of the TOMS datashowing a smaller hole than September 2000 when ozone depletion rates areunprecedented.Graphic courtesy NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland.We b s it e s :http://jwocky.gsfc.nasa.gov/TOMSmain.htmlCredits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
