That early carbon trace indicative of metabolicprocesses is probably residue from microbes such as bacteria. The strange truthis that all the oldest sedimentary rocks found so far have evidence of life inthem. No one has yet found a sedimentary rock devoid of carbon traces. So,when exactly did life begin on Earth?One scientist trying to answer that question is Dr. Stephen Mojzsis (MOY-zish),a geologist at the University of California, Los Angeles. Dr. Mojzsis found asedimentary rock in Greenland that's nearly 4 billion years old and contains thecarbon residue of ancient life. Our Solar System is only four and a half billionyears old.How does he know the rock's carbon was linked to living organisms? There arethree isotopes of carbon: Carbon 12, 13 and radioactive 14. Dr. Mojzsis saysthat when the relative abundance of Carbon 12 is much higher than Carbon 13,it indicates the carbon has been processed in the metabolism of living creatures.Interview:Stephen Mojzsis, Ph.D., Professor of Geology, University of California, LosAngeles: \"There is no other process known on the Earth that can cause this kindof signature, a signature that is unique to life. Now, these rocks, if they had littlefossils in them, those fossils have long since been destroyed because they arefragile shapes. So, instead what you use is a reliable chemical indicator of pastlife. If I was to find a piece of carbon in there that didn't have this chemicalsignature, I couldn't tell you either way. So it has to pass through a number oftests before we are convinced that this can only be explained by metabolicprocesses."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"And that's what we've done with these rocks from Greenland. And subsequent tothis work, other people have gone up there and found many other rocks withsimilar signatures of different ages. Certainly life was pervasive on earth's surface3.8 to 3.9 billion years ago.WERE YOU YOURSELF SURPRISED THAT YOU HAVE FOUNDEVIDENCE IN GREENLAND OF MICROORGANISMS THAT GOBACK ALMOST 4 BILLION YEARS?You know something. In hind sight, no. At the time, I must admit we weredisappointed.WHAT DO YOU MEAN?We were hoping that we could get so far back in time that we were at the time ofpre-life before life on earth. That would be an even more interesting resultbecause then we would be able to bracket time between which life and non-lifewere on this planet.BUT ARE YOU SUGGESTING THAT YOU HAVE YET TO FIND ALAYER THAT DOES NOT HAVE SOME KIND OF MICROORGANISMCARBON TRACE IN IT?We have yet to find rocks on the planet earth, rocks that are sediments -water-laid rocks, rocks formed in water under conditions wherein life could alsohave been present. We have yet to find ancient sediments on the Earth that donot contain some trace of past life, even in the oldest sediments. So, this tells ussomething. This tells us that one, during this period of Earth's history 3.9 billionyears ago when the moon was being bombarded and the Earth was beingbombarded, life was present.Life Forms on Earth 4 Billion Years AgoWas life seeded to this planet? I don't know. Nobody knows. What sort of lifewas it? It was primitive, maybe bacterial life. But that early life was stillsophisticated. It was sophisticated enough to cause this unique chemicalsignature in the carbon that we find and so this life was far from the origin oflife. The origin of life is taking a collection of simple molecules and assemblingthem into information storage and recognition systems that then go on toreproduce and evolve by Darwinian evolution.WHAT YOU MEAN IS THAT WHAT YOU HAVE FOUND SO FAR ATEVEN THE OLDEST LEVELS SUCH AS 4 BILLION YEARS IS LIFETHAT IS MUCH MORE ADVANCED AND SOPHISTICATED THANYOU WOULD THINK FROM THE BEGINNING OF UNICELLULARCLUSTERS?Exactly. We're far from the origin of life even at 3.9 billion years ago.Origin of the MoonIt's now known to a fair degree of certainty that the moon formed between 4.45and 4.5 billion years ago. So, the moon formed after the earth. The moonformed from the earth after a giant impact between the proto-earth and aMars-sized object, another planet that existed in earth's neighborhood, in thesolar system, about 4.5 billion years ago. Well, this impact caused the formationof the moon. This impact would also have wiped the slate clean for the earth.So, if there was life on earth before 4.5 billion years ago, it was wiped out.So, sometime between 4.45 when things settled down after the lunar formationevent and the oceans and atmosphere re-condensed on the earth and 3.9 where"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"we find the the oldest known sediments containing life life forms appeared inthat 550 million year interval.We can begin to ask questions like: Since life appeared so early on the earth,seemingly as the crust and atmosphere and hydrosphere were present - whycouldn't it have gotten started somewhere else just as early? Like Mars. Or someother planet anywhere else in the galaxy or the universe where the three criteriaare fulfilled: liquid water, energy resources and raw materials.A LOT OF THOSE RAW MATERIALS WOULD HAVE BEEN DUMPEDON PLANET SYSTEMS BY ASTEROIDS AND COMETS?Yeah! Anywhere you point a telescope out into space, you see these rawmaterials. You see them in dust clouds, in galactic dust clouds.Is the universe teeming with living organisms?IT'S ACTUALLY LOGICAL THAT THE UNIVERSE COULD BETEEMING WITH LIFE?Yes, it is logical. And this is really something that NASA is banking on and Ithink it's a fair bet. Now, this might not be a surprise to readers that life is outthere. What they might be surprised about, though, is the kind of life. See, lifemight be extremely common in the universe, but the kind of life that is extremelycommon may be restricted mostly to bacterial life. To get life to a sufficient levelof advancement, you need to have stability. You need to have a planet that iscorrectly positioned in a solar system with a stable star and that the planet andits biosphere evolves with the changing conditions of the solar system.Our Sun Increases Its Luminosity 6% Every Billion YearsThe sun is gaining in its luminosity. The sun makes light and heat and energyfrom a nuclear reaction called fusion. And fusion means that you take hydrogenand you fuse hydrogen atoms together to make helium. Well, helium is a denserelement than hydrogen. so, that means that the density of the sun is increasingover time. And with an increase in density, that means things burn hotter.Therefore, you convert more fuel to helium.THERE IS A NATURAL SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION FOR WHY THESUN WOULD KEEP INCREASING IN BRIGHTNESS AND HEATWITH THE AGE OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM?That's correct.THE MORE HELIUM, THE HOTTER IT GETS.The more helium, the denser it gets and the hotter it burns. Therefore, morehelium is produced and more hydrogen is consumed and the hotter it becomes.It's a positive feedback loop.DOES IT MEAN THE SUN WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE INTEMPERATURE THROUGH THE REST OF ITS LIFE?Yes. The sun is increasing its luminosity by about 6% per billion years. And inthe future, this is going to be a problem. When I say the future, I mean hundredsof millions of years in the future.BECAUSE THE SURFACE COULD BECOME SO WARM THAT ITMIGHT NOT BE LIVABLE?Right. So in the end - this is interesting because I think this has a lot to do with"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"the search for life elsewhere in the universe. The window wherein you can havesophisticated life on a planet like the earth is relatively short compared to theage of the biosphere itself. Our biosphere is about 4 billion years old. We havemaybe another 500 million years. So, our biosphere is in late middle age.THE SUN IS EXPECTED TO TURN INTO A RED GIANT AT ABOUTTHE AGE OF 10 BILLION. BUT WHAT YOU ARE SAYING IS THAT INTERMS OF SURVIVING ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH AS WEKNOW IT, THAT WOULD BE CLOSED OUT IN ANOTHER 500MILLION YEARS?That's right. And the last life on the earth will be much like the first. Bacterialiving in an extreme environment of heat. This is something that geologists andastrophysicists have been able to contribute to the search for life elsewhere -that you may have little luck in finding anything but bacteria. But then, you alsohave to look at stars that are between 1 billion and 5 billion years old becausethat's your window. Anything younger than that, it's too early. Anything olderthan that, it's too late.Origin of WaterTHE QUESTION WOULD STILL REMAIN: WHAT WAS THE SEEDFOR LIFE, WHETHER IT WAS UNDER THE OCEANS OR ON THESURFACE OF LAND? AND FURTHER, WHAT IS THE ORIGIN OFALL THE WATER ON THIS PLANET?Studies from planetary probes have demonstrated that Venus which is now ahellish planet with a surface temperature around 800 degrees F. once hadabundant water. And that's from analysis of the chemistry of its atmosphere.That water is gone. It's all been evaporated away and the sunlight has caused thiswater to escape into space.COULD IT HAVE HAD WATER BECAUSE IN THE EARLY STAGES OFTHE SOLAR SYSTEM, THE SUN WAS AT LEAST 30% DIMMERTHAN IT IS NOW?Right. And the fact that the sun was dimmer in the early solar system means thatwater could have stayed stable on the surface of Venus for a few tens of millionsof years after the planet formed. Then you had a runaway greenhouse becauseVenus was just too close, too close to the sun.Earth Water - Not Much from CometsNow, the earth. Earth has lots and lots of water and from the point of view ofchemistry, it looks like it's mostly indigenous to the planet - that it wasn'tbrought in by comets. That was a popular theory in the 1980s that comets wereresponsible for earth water.HOW WOULD YOU KNOW? HOW COULD YOU SAY IT ISINDIGENOUS TO THE EARTH?Since the time of the comet-ocean theory, we've had a chance to test this theoryby examining the chemistry of comets remotely and to ask ourselves: What dowe know about the chemistry of cometary water? And compare it to chemistryof atmospheric water on plantets like Jupiter and Saturn to the Earth's water. Itturns out that the chemistry of cometary water as measured remotely by spaceprobes is very, very different from the Earth's water. It is so different that itcould never have contributed more than about 5 or 10% of the earth's waterbudget.HOW CAN IT BE SO RADICALLY DIFFERENT IF WATER IS SIMPLY"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"H2O?This has to do with isotopes. Different elements themselves, each element tendsto have more than one 'flavor' and these are called isotopes. For instance, carbonhas three isotopes, three flavors.Isotopic RatiosWHICH RELATES TO THE NUMBER OF PROTONS IN THENUCLEUS?An element is defined by the number of protons in its nucleus. But an isotope ofan element is determined by the number of neutrons. So, for instance carbon isan element with six protons. And the most abundant isotope of carbon isCarbon 12. It's an element that has 6 protons and 6 neutrons. Therefore, it hasan atomic weight of 12.The second isotope of carbon is Carbon 13. It still has 6 protons, but this timeCarbon 13 has 7 neutrons. So, it has an atomic weight of 13. Now, there is aradioactive isotope of carbon called Carbon 14 that many people have heardabout. It again has another neutron so it has 6 protons and 8 neutrons. And thiselement is unstable and breaks down rapidly in the time frame of a few thousandyears.The same is true for oxygen. Oxygen has three isotopes. It has 16, which is 8 and8; which is 8 and 9; and 18 which is 8 and 10, protons and neutronsrespectively. So when you look at the oxygen isotopic composition of comets ofother planets and of the earth, you find that comets are unrelated isotopically tothe earth or other planets. And if they made any contribution, it's rather minor.So, it looks like most of our water came from the original stuff that went intobuilding planets.IT WOULD HAVE BEEN HERE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING 4.5BILLION YEARS AGO?Exactly.
