But wedidn't do that this year because we wanted to show that the last 2000 yearscould be looked upon as a separate block of time. It won't cross the MillennialDivide. And the point that we make is that you could have gone to anyindustrialized nation 50 years ago and seen in their agrarian societies a life thatresembled medieval days. No electricity. Doing things by hand.And then if you look at the last 50 years with space travel, jet travel, cloning,artificial intelligence, genetic engineering.The internet."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"The internet - computerization of the planet. You can see that the scope ofchange and the depth of change is like something we've never seen before. Andwe make the point that from Julia Caesar to Grover Cleveland, the world'sleaders have gone to their inaugurations and coronations by horse drawnbuggies.But the order of scope and change before us really shows us that this is a newblock of time. And we wanted to show that in looking at these new top tentrends for the next hundred years that many of these are before us now. Andthey are just being born so that you can see them develop as you grow.Let's go through your Top Ten and start with the Energy Revolution.1) Energy Revolution:We're going to see something in the 21st Century that rivals the discovery of fireand the invention of the wheel. And it's going to be an alternative energy. It's afossil idea to think that we're burning fossil fuels as we enter into the NewMillennium. And the new alternative energy won't be the solar or wind energyor the half measures of hybrid fuel cells. What we're going to see from researchare breakthroughs going into low energy nuclear reactions, or LENRs, and zeropoint energy (ZPE) and hydro-catalytic hydrogen power that are going to freepeople from the energy giants, free them from the energy grid and create apollution-free world in a lot of ways as this new energy moves on line.How long do you think it will be before our reliance on fossil fuels ends?We think we are going to see developments within the next decade, the firstdecade of the 21st Century. Lab work substantiates the reality of new energyresearch and there are published peer-review studies to support it. So, we thinkit's only going to be a matter of time.What about the \"New Millennium Religion?\"2) New Millennium Religion:You can see the seeds of a new millennium religion planted in the quest forspirituality that is driving so many Americans today. And what we're going to seeis what we call a \"mix and match religion.\" You can see it again with thespirituality as people are selecting a piece from the Qabbalah, a piece fromBuddhism, a piece of Catholicism and forming it into something that fits theirlives and lifestyles. And as these things continue to grow and expand, theybecome institutionalized. So, we are forecasting that by 2020, within the next 20years, we're going to see the beginning of a new millennium religion thatincludes pieces of religions from Islam to Christianity.In that mix and match, is what you are saying that people are moving awayfrom restrictive boxes of the old religious concepts to something thatrelates more to the unseen soul and spirit?Exactly. In all religions, there are universal truths and principals that believethere is a soul and it is immortal by nature. But today's religions - and we're notsaying rightly or wrongly - but the fact is that many of today's religion's devotemuch energy to the socio-political and moral issues such as inter-marriage,abortion, political power, social reform and so on. But the new religion won'tlook at those issues as much and will focus more on the spiritual developmentthat brings people closer to the peace and salvation that they are seeking. Andpeople are understanding or believing more and more that they have a divinepurpose in life. And what these new religions are going to do is to help peoplefind that purpose.How does that fit with Number 3 on your list, the \"New Millennium Family?\""},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"3) New Millennium Family:It fits rather closely because a lot of these things are evolutions of the socialfabric rather than revolutions. And as we look at the family, it's clear to us thatas we move into the 21st Century, we are leaving the traditional family behind.The traditional family of parents and children now accounts for only 26% ofAmerican households. We understand that the agrarian age in and of itselfbrought about that type of family unit that we had. And as this agrarian ageends, it's a return to the pre-agrarian nomadic societies where you had alldifferent types of households. There were matriarchy, patriarchy, polygamy,monogamy.But we can also make the point that right now, we have a neo-nomadic society.And we're traveling far and wide to find our financial hunting grounds. So, theNew Millennium families will be the collective body of people living in onehousehold. People just living together for shared values or another one that is areality economic needs.We can talk as much as we want about the great economic prosperity of the1990s. But when you look behind the numbers, you realize that 40% ofAmerican families have seen their net household assets decline 36% between1983 and 1997. So, people are going to be getting together for economic needsas well, particularly in an aging society.Why has that occurred in what seems to be an economic boom time?Well, because of the world religion which we at the Trends Institute call 'TheoEconomics' in which the economy is God and finance is the philosophy. And wehave right now a government that is clearly in control of the corporations thatput the politicians or shills for the corporations into power. Everybody knowsthese words that they come up with - campaign financing. That's influencepeddling! The other one is soft money. That's called bribes. So, what hashappened is that the moneyed interests have bought and paid for shills in thefaces of men and women posing as representatives of the people to pass lawsand institute policies that make the rich much richer and everybody else a lotpoorer.By the way, as you saw the Battle of Seattle - that was the first shot of Cold WarII, another one of our Top Ten Trends.4) Cold War II:It's unrealistic to believe that there could be one type of economy to fit theentire world. There is no such thing as one size fits all. We're going to see a new'Ism' develop in the 21st Century to challenge capitalism, or to challenge whatthey call open market democracy. And we don't know the name of that Ism yet,but the first battle of Cold War II was the Battle of Seattle. And indeed the shotswere actually fired at the people. And the theme is very old - it's called workersof the world against moneyed interests.That Battle in Seattle relates to Cold War II in what way in the 21stcentury?If the last Cold War was ostensibly fought over political agendas, this one isgoing to be fought over economic philosophy. And the philosophy is going to beone in which there is a backlash against the moneyed interests that arecontrolling so much of the world's wealth. I'm old enough to remember whenpeople weren't bragging about working what they call the 24/7 week. Iremember when everything was closed on Sundays and my Dad was home onSaturday and Sunday. And I had 7 kids in my family and he could support all ofus. My mother didn't have to work.What people don't realize is that they are working longer and harder than everbefore just to keep their heads above water. So, the Cold War II is going to be"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"fought over philosophy of the value of life and the economic imperatives.President Clinton said that anyone who is against the World Trade is wrong.Well, pardon, Mr. President, but I think a lot of people are going to disagree.And you can't say one person is right and the other is wrong. As I have beensaying over and over again, it's unrealistic - almost infantile - to think that youcan have one world economic system. There is going to be a challenge to it andit will be Cold War II.Cold War II, I assume sets up another of your trends which is the \"New Politicsof the 21st Century?\"5) New Politics of 21st Century:Yes. We have an election coming up this year in 2000 and the media isportraying it as George Bush fighting for the hearts of the conservatives. And onthe left, Al Gore fighting for the hearts of the liberals. Both of these guys arefrom the Ruling Class - it's George Bush's son and former Senator Gore's son,Al. This is no fight for the right or left. It's the two-headed, one party systemwith a minor bit of difference between them. And most people recognize that.We're going to see a continuing decline of people going to the polls. It'sbecoming a moronic concept to waste your time to go to the polls to vote for alesser of two evils. In any kind of dignified society, we should be voting for thebetter of two goods.So, you're going to see more of a decline at the polls and it's going to bringabout at some point a political revolution and you're going to see the emergenceof a new Third Party. We call the new Third Party, Progressive Libertarian.Progressive in the terms of social needs such as health care, retirement,environment - and progressive libertarian in terms of the U. S. staying out ofother countries' foreign affairs. Then there's the privacy issue.The privacy issue is going to be a HUGE issue and you know also that the2-headed one party system just changed the law to allow financial corporationsto exchange peoples information virtually at will.How would this new politics be different from the Ross Perot effort to starta Third Party in the U. S. in which Donald Trump and Pat Buchanan arecandidates?Well, the Donald Trumps and Ross Perots and Pat Buchanans are merely clonesof the 2-headed one party system. And that's why they are not getting the kindof recognition or support that a Jesse Ventura, for instance, has garnered inMinnesota. I loved it when he became elected! The media pundits andannouncers were saying things like, 'What kind of qualifications does JesseVentura have?' You know, like the rest of these guys go to school to learn howto run a government! They're a bunch of hacks, political hacks, that are justlooking for jobs.So, the people are going to more and more pick the kind of candidate thatrepresents their interests rather than the special interests that have put thecurrent class of politicians into power. To make my point, a U. S. Today poll inlate December showed that only 5% of the American public believes that thegovernment does things in the best interest of the people. So, I assume that 5%is the politicians and their vested interests.What about the internet being used to vote?That's going to become a reality. And the only thing that's stopping it is thepolitical will not to let it happen. Because if that happens and WHEN ithappens, because eventually it will, that will free people up to make more of achoice and to choose more candidates eventually as this new Third Party movesinto motion. So, at one point, we're going to have a decline in attendance at thepolls and that will begin to reverse as on-line voting becomes a reality."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"I suppose right now it is against the entrenched vested interests to haveinternet voting which is more democratic?Right. And the big fallacy today is that we are living in a democracy. Democracyhas been stolen from the people. When you look at the finance campaigncorruption that is going on and the influence peddling. I know there arepoliticians that are saying, 'How dare you say that just because somebodyshuffled over $10,000 to $20,000 to $50,000 to me that that can buy theminfluence.\"Well, I'll tell you what, you try going out to see your governor or your senatorwithout going with a bag full of dough before you enter into the halls of wherethey residing and you'll probably get arrested if you put up too much of a stinkto go see that person. And by the way, in my book TRENDS 2000, I had pointedout that this internet candidacy as well as internet voting is going to become areality, but the only thing that's going to stop it are the political interests that arein power.And there is another thing going on, by the way. With people working as longand hard as they are right now, they don't have time to know what's going on.And I've never seen it as bad as it is right now and I've been in this business fortwenty years. So forget all the talk about the Information Age. People are wiredout of their minds, just doing the chores of every day. And all they know are thesound bites that they hear from the media.Nobody has the time anymore to sit down to read and absorb.Precisely.Looking into the next several years, how does all of this reconcile withwhat you call \"Renaissance 2000?\"6) Renaissance 2000:I look at this as the end of the Dark Age of Modern Times and I call the 21stCentury the Global Age - the beginning of the Global Age. And as the IndustrialAge dies, many of the institutions that were designed to support it are eitherunder attack or under question or failing, whether it's politics in government,health care and education, traditional religions, traditional families, thecorporations. You look at it, and you can see it falling apart or being re-aligned.So, just as the last Dark Age was followed by a Renaissance, I'm of the beliefthat this Dark Age will be followed by a Renaissance and it's going to be a richera of intellectual, scientific and philosophical development. You can see theseeds of this change and of art, too, in the sense that art is going to play its rolein helping to uncover the true meaning of the human spirit. But also in terms ofthis new quest for spirituality. People are really searching for a Universal Truth.And they can't rely on the old institutions to find it. So, something is going to beborn.We don't believe we're going to see this Renaissance in our life times. We'll seethe buds of it. But our children will experience or begin to experience theflowering of it.So, Renaissance 2000 and the New Religion are in a way two sides of thesame coin?Very much. And even the new family. People can talk all you want about thetechnological revolution. But the biggest changes that are going to come aboutwill be philosophical changes. Ideas. Because when ideas change, that's wheneverything changes. I'm not the first person to say there's nothing more powerfulthan an idea whose time has come. And new ideas are being developed."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"And this thing about the internet - they talk about the new economy. What ahoax! What a hoax! Go back about 120 years ago to the advent of the electriclight and electrification of the planet. Can you imagine the electric geeks at thattime talking about, 'Hey man, we're going to electrify the whole planet. Justthink of the stock options and the IPOs we could have.' Well, they were right.But you know what? During that time, we've seen recessions, depressions,panics, world wars, holocausts, gulags and nuclear bombs. There is no neweconomy. It's an arrogance of the high tech people who think that they arebeyond the natural laws and the organic processes that are really controlling theplanet.The statistics you gave that in a booming economy a large percentage of thepopulation has lost ground in terms of income. The fact that the disparitybetween the rich and middle class and poor seem to be greater leaves a bigunresolved issue as we move into 2000: health care. What do you seehappening in the next few years concerning universal health care?Well, there is going to be huge problems, particularly as the baby boomerscontinue to age. And the nation is faced with a slew of chronic degenerativediseases. And I don't buy into the scientific line either - with genetic engineeringand stem cell manipulation we're going to be living to 140 years old and we'll bedecoding the genome with the DNA. I've been around for over half a centuryand I remember the talk in the 1950s that, 'Don't worry. Science will come upwith an answer.' Well, guess what? They haven't come up with a cure for thecommon cold. And guess what else? As far as I know - and I would love to becorrected in what I'm saying - as far as I know, there's not one drug on themarket that cures chronic degenerative diseases. And all any one has to do isstep back into your memory bank and think about what happened when youtook a loved one to see a doctor because of a chronic degenerative disease. Andthink how limited the options for treatment really are.What is \"Whole Health Planning\" on your Top Ten Trends list?7) Whole Health Planning:It's a brand new concept that we've just identified and what it means is that justas in the latter part of the 20th Century financial planning has become anecessity for all those that want to make sure that they are not caught shortwhen their earning years end, it's the same thing with Whole Health Planning.It's not only your financial health, you better get in shape for your physicalhealth and emotional health and spiritual health. And we're going to understandthat this is an integrated system. And when I talk about their being a GlobalAge, it's not only global in terms of communication and trade. It's global in theunderstanding that all things are connected. Or like Chief Seattle is alleged tohave said: 'All things are connected like the blood which unites us all.' So,Whole Health Planning is going to spur a whole field of professional WholeHealth Planners that are going to lead you and guide you in helping youestablish a well-integrated program that blends and balances financial,emotional, spiritual and physical health.What then is \"Virtual Education\" on your trends list?8) Virtual Education:You heard the talk about broadband technology. It means that fat pipe that'sgoing to allow information to flow into our homes at hundreds of times the rateof conventional modems. When that happens, the technological skill alsoincreases. Which means that when we're talking in the future, we're going to bedoing so in a 3-dimensional holographic atmosphere. That makes on-lineeducation more and more of a reality. It also means that you are going to be ableto select the tops, the Dream Team of Education, that you want to learn from.You can already hear from the traditional education establishment, 'Well, you"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"know, you're going to miss that hands on personal touch.' I don't know whatthey are talking about because when I was there in college, I was in anauditorium with 300 different kids and listening to some grad student orprofessor droning on and on.Now, with interactive education, you're going to be able to tap into the best andbrightest in any given field. So, virtual education is going to be a hybrid system.There is no either/or. You'll go to school in a centralized location a couple oftimes a week and then you're on-line doing your virtual education a couple ofothers.Is this going to reduce the need for the brick school building?Yes, in a lot of ways it will. And it's not only going to reduce the cost of schoolbuildings, but this whole new virtual world is going to bring down the costs ofbusinesses because the second greatest cost after labor costs are plant andmaintenance operations. So, you're going to see by mid-21st Century less of aneed for these massive sprawling universities.I wonder how that's going to affect the school tax revenue that goes into somany cities and counties to keep cities running?Well, it's going to be interesting because we're anticipating some major taxrevolutions in the years to come. I mentioned about the aging baby boompopulation. You're going to see more and more resistance to people payingproperty taxes, for instance, for school systems to put other peoples' childreninto schools. The baby boomers are running short on cash and running out onlife and earning potential. So, we're going to see some dramatic reversals in yearsto come in the entire taxing system. There's going to be quite a debate going on.If there is more reliance on the internet for the Virtual Education, then thismeans that the home itself is going to become the business, family, spiritualcenter?9) 21st Century Home Center:More and more. The home right now - and that's one of our Top Ten Trends -the Home for the 21st Century. Home right now is just a place for people tohang their hat as they are going in between commutes and crashing on theweekends and getting ready to go back to work early on Monday morning.But now with this new interactive world and the broadband technology when anation becomes wired, more and more people will be working out of their homefull or part time. Also, with people working at home, you actually become morecommunity oriented because now you're going to know what's going on aroundthe area because you'll be spending more time in it. Also, your child will beeducated at home - not full time, but maybe two or three days a week and therest of the time at either a satellite or a centralized location. And for those whereit's impossible to be home, then a child will go to a centralized or satellitelocation.When I interviewed you a year ago about trends for 1999 to 2000, Y2K wasup there at the top of the list. What do you now expect to happen afterJanuary 1, 2000?Well, there is definitely going to be Y2K problems. The systems today are sotightly integrated that when one link on the chain breaks, the entire systemcrashes. But you know, we don't think it's time to head to the hills with yourpork and beans and water and ammunition. It's definitely a time to be prudentand to stock up.We just have to hope we don't have a nuclear disaster occur from the formerSoviet Union. As you may remember in my book Trends 2000, I wrote"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"extensively about the problems of the former Soviet Union regarding theirnuclear facilities. And the one thing we learned is that the winds of Chernobyldon't stop in that country's borders.One of the weak links in preparedness for Y2K are nuclear power reactors,not only in the U. S., but around the world.Exactly. We don't want to sound like Armageddon that the world is going tocome to an end, but there are some serious problems. Manmade, by the way. Wemention also about the world war weapons of mass destruction that are going tohappen.10) World War Weapons of Mass Destruction (WWWMD):Now you're hearing in the news about so-called terrorism slipping across theborders. What's slipping across the border? Tons of drugs and millions ofimmigrants slip across the border each year. And they can't be stopped and theywon't be stopped by New Millennium Warriors either. The point being is thatthe only thing that will stop a global war of weapons of mass destruction beingbought by so-called small groups of terrorists. We call them people who want toget even.Terrorists resent the United States for being the 800-pound guerrilla on theworld.You can make arguments that there are Iraqis that don't like the United Statesbecause as we speak, Iraq is probably getting bombed right now. It's gettingbombed virtually on a weekly basis. You can make a case that there are peoplein Yugoslavia that really don't love the U. S. and its role in NATO and if any oftheir parents, children or loved ones are killed, they would like to retaliate. Anytime you get involved in somebody else's business, they want to get even withyou. But what we're saying is that in the absence of enlightened leadership anddivine intervention, a world war of weapons of mass destruction is like bettingon a favorite in a one-horse race. And you can say the same thing about thedestruction of the environment. Without divine intervention or some kind ofenlightened leadership, the planet earth is going in a very dangerous direction.I'm curious why in the list of the Top Ten Trends of the 21st Century youhave placed world war weapons of mass destruction above global warmingchanges? Huge environmental shifts are already taking place and areexpected to accelerate such as the North Pole Arctic ice melt. It is 40% lessthan it was twenty years ago. If that trend continues, in 30 years there willbe no icy North Pole in the summers. There are so many large changeshappening so rapidly. The global weather system seems to be under greatstress to change.There's no question about it and we are aware of it. And selecting these Top TenTrends - it's very difficult to forecast straight-line events. We think that a wildcard in this is the energy revolution whereby it will be operationally cost free. Ifit's a low energy nuclear reaction, it will be radiation-free. And we also believethat philosophical thoughts are going to begin to change. And with new politicalparties developing, we believe there is going to be a dramatic reversal. If we'rewrong and events continue to go the way they are, then we'll see the kinds ofenvironmental calamities that you are talking about.Many scientists now are concerned that the greenhouse gas emissionbuild-up in the 20th century has set in motion a ship that cannot be turnedaround for at least another 50 or 60 years, even if fossil fuel consumptionwere stopped tomorrow.Right, it can't be turned around immediately. But also, if it were stopped, thedamage would begin to reverse itself and there is a possibility that the planet,being an organic system, does potentially have a healing potential within it if the"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"right decisions were made.But global weapons of mass destruction can cause a chain reaction of retaliationand war that would do more to damage the planet short term than the long termtrends of environmental destruction which are simultaneously would go on. Itwill also have an immediate socio-economic political implications as strategiesare developed for retaliation and preparations are made for war.Now, all you have to do is go back to 1999 April and remember the war againstYugoslavia that the United States lead. It was launched without debate on thepublic scale or for Congressional debate. The nation marched off to war withoutknowing the facts or details. If there is - and there will be - an attack against theU. S. using weapons of mass destruction, the people will follow the lock step ofthe government to fight back against the people who they believe were thecauses of the destruction, just as we saw what is going on in Russia today againstChechnya. The same thing will happen in the U. S. if we go to war against asuspected terrorist group or a terrorist country. So, the short term implicationsand the long term implications stemming from a war of weapons of massdestruction will be devastating.It seems to be contradictory to a Renaissance 2000 in which people wouldbe trying to become more spiritual that such a trend would evolve in aworld bogged down in fighting over territories.These things could happen simultaneously. And we're very clear in saying thatin the short term we're expecting some very serious problems. But as this is alsogoing on, there is a very strong movement underfoot for positive change. Forinstance, right now the politicians can be labeled as the Princes of PopularCulture. For them, it's OK to build strip malls. For them, it's OK to depleteforests, to poison the planet. For them, it's OK to be bought out by corporationswho want to peddle influence. But then there is a whole other culture that isgoing to begin to demand its half of the pie - that doesn't want to see things goon the way they are going on by the popular culture's creed. So, when I say aRenaissance on one hand and a war of weapons of mass destruction on theother, it doesn't mean they can't happen simultaneously. We think at the endpoint, the philosophy of a Renaissance will be winning out.In everybody's life if you've been around long enough, many of us have had togo through tough times and pay for our mistakes to learn what we did wrong tochange ourselves. The same thing holds true for a society. Or could hold true forsociety.Do you think that we will be able to evolve on this planet for another 100years and survive?Yes, I do.Because?Because the human being is a pretty resilient breed. And even if there is a majorcatastrophe. You can look back to WWII, certainly a major war. I wouldestimate between 25 to 30 million people were killed. But when you look at thescope between the 1920s and the year 2000, there are nearly 6 billion people onthe planet! So, even if a third of the population was eliminated from a plague -which we are also forecasting - an environmental AIDS, so to speak, as peoples'immune systems break down from the onslaught of chemicals and thepossibilities of nuclear radiation.There is still going to be life on the planet and it may evolve into a higher beingthan the Theo-economic culture where money and greed and materialism are theruling schools of thought.\"More Information:"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"Trends 2000 is available at bookstores everywhere and in the on-line bookstoressuch as amazon.com and barnes&noble.com.
