The circled X marks the area where eyewitness Dwain Wrightsaw mutilated bull andwhere a cowboy described having seen glowing discs that lifted cattle up inglowing beams anddropped them back down through the trees in late 1970s to early 1980s. Brothers, Oregon March 29, 2000 - The high desert area southeast of Bend,Oregon has long been associated with unusual animal deaths known as \"animalmutilations.\" A very active area back in the 1970s and early 1980s was the PineMountain area that included Sand Springs and Brothers, Oregon. In the secondhalf of this report, an eyewitness describes animal mutilations in Sand Springsassociated with glowing discs and beams of light.On Saturday, March 18th, a Deschutes County Sheriff Deputy and OregonAnimal Humane Agent, Kimball Lewis, were called out to investigate four deadcalves in the remote Millican Valley northwest of Brothers. The calves weredivided up in pairs about a quarter mile apart. All four had been strangely andbloodlessly skinned. The next day, Sunday, March 19th, eight more calves werefound in the same area. Four of those had also been skinned the same way.Puzzling over the lack of tracks and blood on the ground, Kimball Lewisdecided to call in a veterinarian to do necropsies to see what the calves lookedlike inside. Lewis has worked sixteen years on animal abuse cases, first inColorado. Then in 1996, Lewis was appointed by Oregon's governor to be oneof the state's four commissioned agents specializing in large animal abuse andneglect. But he had never seen anything before like the skinned calves.Only one year ago in March 1999, fourteen other dead calves and a pig with itslegs cut off had been found only a couple of miles from this new batch of deadcalves in March 2000. Early last week, an Oregon judge placed a temporary gagorder on the case. Afterward, another eighteen calves were reported dead, but"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"by March 28th, Kimball Lewis said those additional eighteen belonged to arancher who had simply dumped dead spring calves to avoid going to a landfill.Mr. Lewis agreed to talk with me on the record about what he knows so far,particularly about the eight skinned calves. Interviews:Kimball Lewis, Oregon Humane Agent, Bend, Oregon: \"And these animalshad their skins removed from just behind their front shoulders, if you will, in a360 degree pattern down to if you can imagine what would be the equivalent ofour ankles on their hind legs. The skin removed was neatly and uniformly downto that area on these animals.The hide on the head and neck was there. But everything else was removeddown to the lower half of each leg?That's correct.Was the lumen tissue, that thin tissue over muscle, still intact?It appeared to be, yes.Did you find that to be unusual?From a forensics standpoint, it appeared to be an anomaly. And I really didn'thave any explanation for that. I did at that point elect to have a state certifiedlarge animal specialist, a veterinarian, return to the scene for the purposes oftaking tissue samples and to obtain any other physical evidence that we couldgarner from that scene.That was Dr. Trish Kentner?Ye s .She is a veterinarian. Did she take these animals back to her clinic? Or didshe do the necropsies in the field?We conducted the necropsies in the field at the site and removed some tissuesamples and removed those. In hind sight, it's difficult to say one way or theother which would have been the preferred method. But given the size of theseanimals, it's not as easy to pick them up and take them up as it would be smallerspecimens. And so, we discussed that between us and thought that taking oftissue samples would be sufficient for analyses at that point.We're talking about two-week-old calves?Yeah, they appeared to be about two weeks old and along those lines, one of thefirst questions was: Is it possible these were calves that died during the birthingprocess because this is calving season. This is the time of year when calves areborn. So, one of the things we wanted to determine through the necropsy, andnecropsy being the animal version of an autopsy, we wanted to determine if"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"these animals were stillborn? Or had they been alive and thriving? And when weopened the cavities into the internal organs of the animals, we were able todetermine that there was food stuffs or milk in the digestive process and that wewere able to determine that these calves had been nursing. So we know theyweren't stillborn. They were alive.What were the other anomalies the veterinarian discovered when sheopened them up for the necropsies?There appeared to be a diminished amount or lack of blood in the internal areasthat you would normally expect to see blood in a deceased animal. And to thatextent, in the heart and other organs there was less blood than what one wouldexpect to find in an animal in that state.Was there any blood in the chambers of the hear at all?Not that I was able to see. And I don't think that Trish found any.She is a veterinarian opening up the two calves and finding lack of blood inthe heart. What was her comment at the time?At that point, she turned to me and said there seemed to be a lack of blood inthese animals and that was one of the remarkable observations that we made inthe field there that day. I can't say there wasn't any blood because there wassome blood. But certainly much less than what we would expect to find.What about the genitals and the sex of the calves?We went to determine the sex of the animals for our reports and she made theobservations that the sexual organs were absent and that we could not determineif they were male or female from what we were looking at from a cursoryoverview. And attempting to look at the organs, there were none.If we look at the case overall and we say, 'What stumped us about this particularcase?' it would be the lack of sexual organs, it would be the absence of the skin,it would be the manner in which the animals were disposed of and the lack ofblood in the cavity. Being pragmatic, I try to look towards logical explanationsfor these things. And yet, I don't have a logical explanation. So, I find myselfbeing frustrated in being unable to ascertain what really happened out there.The other thing that was remarkable to us was that the coyotes, which areprolific in that area it's an area that has a large coyote and other population ofwild animals that none of these animals had touched these carcasses. And evenover a period from Friday, March 17 when we think they came to be there up toMarch 23rd, it was obvious that no coyotes or birds or other predators haddisturbed these carcasses. So, that was one thing that stuck out in our minds andthat was one thing that Dr. Kentner had commented that she found to be strangeabout the scene there.Or strange because it would be an entire week without predation.It would be an entire week without predation. We were surprised to find thatcoyotes had not predated or disturbed these carcasses. And we were surprised tofind that the birds would not even disturb them. So, these were just theanomalies that stood out in our minds overall.And another factor that left us a little curious is that no one has ever comeforward to report their cattle missing or that these were their livestock animals.After two weeks at the end of March, you still don't even know whosecalves these are?We don't have a clue. We are nowhere nearer to resolution to this than we werethe day we went out there the first time.There has been some publicity, too, in that press release from yourHumane Agent office in Oregon and articles in local newspapers."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Ye s .There has also been some local television and radio. You would think thatout of all that, somebody who had lost these many calves - twelve orfourteen - would report it.Twelve. And these types of cases do generate a lot of public interest for anumber of reasons, particularly in an area like this where livestock production isa big activity. You know, in the barber's chair in town or the school room, therehas been a lot of discussion about what it could be. Certainly, there is no secretthis happened. And all the ranchers in the area are familiar with it. I think ifsomebody owned the animals in the region would have found out by now theywere missing and would have contacted us, but that isn't what has occurred.The implication might be that these eight calves cut so strangely mighthave originated in another part of the country and been placed nearBrothers, Oregon for reasons unknown.Well, it would be hard for me to speculate. I don't have a scientific background,I couldn't comment to the origins of the animals, although naturally I wouldbelieve they came from somewhere in a geographically relevant area that theywere able to be placed there. But again, there are factors in this case we don'thave answers to. And at this point, I would doubt the answers will ever manifestthemselves to us.You don't think you are going to solve this?I hate to say this, but I don't. I'm not optimistic that we will have resolution tothis. I think it is something there is a file drawer for unresolved cases. Call itwhat you will, we quipped about the X-Files because it was a curious event. Itwas a curious event where we said there is no answer for that. Naturally whenyou find mutilated animals out in the desert, office humor can run rampant. Youcan say all types of things. But I think the reality of it is, I doubt we are going tohave answers for how the calves came to be there or who owns them. I don't seeany resolution to that forthcoming.\"Lab Analysis and Other High Strangeness in Eastern OregonTissue samples from the bloodless heart and lungs of the two calves necropsiedby Dr. Trish Kentner were sent to the National Institute for Discovery Science(NIDS) in Las Vegas, Nevada. Colm Kelleher, Director of NIDS Research, saidhe might have results about element composition and capillary blood by thesecond week in April.In 1980, southeast of Bend, Oregon, then 34-year-old Dwain Wright had joineda friend on a hunting trip. Wright, who received a Ph.D. in Psychology fromUCLA and a masters degree in graphic design, went along to enjoy the outdoors,not to hunt. the men were in a place called Sand Springs where forest and openrange meet. The year before, Wright had discovered a dead cow wedged in theupper limbs of a huge ponderosa pine tree. On this hunting trip, he went off toexplore again on his own and stopped at some cattle watering tanks.Dwain Wright, Graphic Artist, Grants Pass, Oregon: \"There was quite anumber of what they called cattle mutilations all over the high desert. Bend sitsright on the edge of forest with another ridge of mountains and more forest andthat opens up into eastern Oregon which is all high desert. It's open cattle range.The current place where there have been these calf deaths in Brothers,Oregon, is only about ten miles from Sand Springs?Yes, as the crow flies, it's about ten miles across the desert. Sand Springs was awatering station where they had large watering troughs. And an old rancherlived in a small travel trailer in the forest in the trees to kind of watch over openrange herd and to keep the water tanks full."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"So, please explain what happened that day and what you first found in theground before you talked to that cowboy.I had gone up there with a friend who wanted to go hunting. But the huntingseason in Oregon that particular year was very early. There are two seasons inBend. They call it winter and August. It's either very hot or very cold. Ithappened to be extremely hot, well over 100 degrees. You don't find deer whenit's that hot. Most deer hunters go out for the exercise and nature and notnecessarily to hunt deer. So, I stayed behind and I had parked by the wateringtanks and was just walking around looking at some unusual things like I found acow (bull) kind of dead. And I was noticing that particular parts were missing. Ihave five degrees from UCLA, including a doctorate (in Psychology), and Ithought it was fairly unusual. And the more I looked, pretty soon I noticedsomeone approaching me. And he was an old rancher type. We got to talkingand once a little bit of trust was built up, he began to say things that weren'tcommon at the time. People didn't talk about what was happening.Essentially, the bull looked to me like it had been dropped from a great distancein the sky. Cows are fairly heavy, a thousand or more pounds. So, this is sandysoil and it was obviously imprinted in the soil. It reminded me a lot of what theydo in England with catapults. They catapult dead animals and I've seen picturesof where they land and it makes quite an impression in the soil.So literally you were looking at a dead cow laying in a shallow crater madeby its own body weight landing in the sandy soil?Yes, that's correct. And there were things missing like the tongue, the eyes, theanus. All these things were missing and yet they looked like they had been donebloodlessly. I had cleaned lots of animals having been raised on a farm. Anddespite the fact the animal is dead, there is still profuse bleeding and there didn'tseem to be any blood. And the question in my mind was: the desert and forestsare full of wild animals. Why hadn't these (mutilated) animals been consumedby the coyotes or mountain lions or bears? Or just decayed? Those things hadn'thappened.You're looking at the body of an animal that is mutilated. How did youcome to talk to the cowboy?As I stood up, he was almost behind me. And we started talking, first about therifle I had along and pretty soon I started asking him about the cows and whathad happened and what his function there was. And after half an hour or so, hebegan to talk about, he asked me if I believed in flying saucers. And he in turnbegan to talk about what he had seen at night. And he had seen that glowingobjects, saucer-shaped objects, would come across the desert. It's clear. It'sbeautiful at night in Bend out there in the desert. And they would come acrossthe desert and where there was a herd grazing at night, some of these would justbe lifted up right up towards the objects and later dropped out through the trees.And he said, they would come down crashing through the trees and hit theground and he said, 'It was frightening.' He said some of these cows had beendragged across the sand that he couldn't see but made a barking noise a lot likean arc welder. I've heard other people give that same description.The arc welding sound was associated with the beams or these round,glowing discs dropping the animals down through the trees? Or draggingthe animals across the ground?Well, he said some were just picked up in a beam of light and just floated up offthe ground. He said others were just literally like they were struck over the headand fell flat on the ground and then were dragged off and picked up by a beamof light. He said the whole thing was so bizarre.I had a similar experience on a piece of property I had at the Tumalo Reservoir. Ihad a huge pine tree in a canyon and it was hundreds of feet from either side ofthe canyon and yet, there was a cow that was probably a half-size cow at anyrate in the top of that pine tree. There was just no way it could have gotten up"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"there. And I thought about it for years. I thought it must have, the only way itcould have gotten there was taken up by a flying saucer and dropped out. Thereweren't any helicopters working in the Bend area at that time. No helicopterpilots I went to helicopter school in the U. S. Army in the Viet Nam era. Theyare responsible people. No one would pick up a cow and drop it into a pinetree!This finding animals up in trees also was described sporadically back inthe 1970s in various parts of the U. S. Did the cowboy describe the soundof the animals dropping down through the trees? Did he actually see thecows drop with his own eyes?Yes, he had actually seen it happening. He said it was frightening and he fearedfor his own life. It was at the time on the radio, this was happening once to twiceevery week. It would be on the local radio station about strange thingshappening to cows out in the desert. And it was always blamed on some type ofcult activity. There were no cults out there, period. At that time, this was a verycowboy or redneck type community. Very conservative. If there had beenanybody practicing anything, they would have been known about andeliminated from the community.How many times had the cowboy seen those glowing discs put the beamsdown?He mentioned it happened many times. It was a common occurrence. It was, hedidn't say it happened four times a week, or three times a week. He said ithappened a lot. And from the news reports, it did happen a lot.Did he ever try to report that to anyone in law enforcement or anyone else?He didn't say if he did or not. I believe at the time he tried to report it, youwould either be listed as a nut case or maybe involved with it. People tended toreport it like ranchers would say missing cattle. Something has happened andthe sheriff would come out and say, 'Well, it was a mountain lion.' I don't believethere are any mountain lions in the high desert around central Oregon. Theremay be. But where I live here in southern Oregon, mountain lions don't dosurgical work on deer or cows. They eat the carcass up in such a means theydon't care which part they eat. They just gobble it up.When you heard about this most recent round of the mutilated calves nearBrothers, Oregon, what went through your mind?The exact same thing happening that happened before, but I believe it has beenhappening all along. It's just that there were so many of them in such a shorttime frame that it got more attention.\" More Information:Book Reference: You can read much more about Sand Springs, Oregon andrelated accounts in my book Glimpses of Other Realities, Volume II: HighStrangeness in bookstores and at amazon.com and barnes&noble.com.

There are only a few hundredfarm residents who depend on each other to survive. They watch their pastures,the mountains and the sky for any signs of trouble. Around September 11th,1994, two people reported seeing an object moving in the night sky that \"lookedlike a house with lighted windows.\"Three days later on September 13, 1994, at the base of Luhan Canyon, a cow"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"was found dead and mutilated.

It was in themiddle of the day about 2 o'clock, but it didn't phase me then. I didn't thinkabout it. I just ignored it except I looked out and it wasn't in the same area. Itwas the opposite from where I had seen the cow. I thought it was someoneworking with an arc welder. It sounds like an arc weld sound. It goeszzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz and that was the thing that came into my mind atthat second. Arc weld. And everything like happened so quick. When I heardthat noise, I heard the cows I had passed coming up the canyon because I heardthe running of the steps, running the opposite direction away from me. And in"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"those few seconds I had to look around where sound was coming from, I saw acow going over the fence and being dragged along the ground and making asound like being tortured.Like being tortured?Ye s .Do you mean the cow was being dragged on the ground?It was being dragged, but sort of in the air low to the ground. The cow was ableto touch the ground with its feet. Its back was going toward the sound, but itcouldn't get up.You mean the cow was on its side with its legs dragging but the back wasslightly up in the air?Right.Any tracks where the cow was dragged?No tracks. By the time I came back down to call the sheriff's office and friends,we couldn't find no tracks. The only thing I found were broken branches. I knowI saw what I saw. But we couldn't find no tracks. And it had barely rained.So the ground was wet, but still no tracks?There still was no tracks.Does that mean the cow was floating a bit above the ground while it wasbeing dragged?I guess so.\"Carpenter Larry Gardea pointing to the wide ditch that the dragged cow seemedto \"float over\" under the influence of the loud sound that resembled an arc welder's torch.The mutilated cow in photographs above was laying inside the grove of aspens to Gardea'sleft.The dead cow on its knees was laying behind where Gardea is standing.Photograph © 1994 by Linda Moulton Howe.Larry Gardea and I walked all over the hill side looking for any obscureantenna, metallic equipment or signs of any new structures, but did not findanything unusual. I also collected plant samples from the three areas where themutilated cow, the dead cow crumpled on its knees and the dragged cow hadbeen. Those plants were studied by biophysicist W. C. Levengood in Michigan.On some broken aspen branches five feet above the head of the mutilated cow,he found a reddish-black stain which showed the strong presence of iron whenanalyzed for elemental composition. Dr. Levengood's hypothesis is that some ofthe cow's blood was somehow sprayed thinly onto the broken branches. Was thecow being lowered down from above by a mysterious force, mutilated, whileanother force sent the second cow dead to its knees and the noise welder's arcfrequency lifted the third cow over the fence and dragged it along the ground?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Larry Gardea in a panic raised his 30.6 to fire in the sky above the trees at whatseemed the source of the terrible noise. His first blast had no effect. He raisedhis gun sight a little higher above the trees and blasted again. Immediately, allwent silent. The cow moving across the ground had disappeared into the trees infront of him.\"Suddenly I realized that whatever was making that noise and dragging that cowaway knew I was there.
