The large red and bleeding sores are typical of the Pfiesteriadinoflagellate whichcan be either an algae plant or amoeba animal, depending upon environmental conditions.In its amoeba form, it likes to eat fish.

And this is only the first of July. Whathappens in August and September?That same question is being asked by environmentalists and river keepers inNorth Carolina in one of the warmest springs on record in which the dreadedPfiesteria dinoflagellate is killing fish in the Neuse and Pamlico River estuariesagain by the hundreds of thousands. Pfiesteria was not known until the early1990s when massive kills filled the Pamlico and Neuse Rivers with millions offish covered by large, red bleeding sores. The water around the dead animalsturned a bizarre maroon-brown and fishermen reported dizziness, disorientationand open sores on their own arms after crabbing in those rivers.Eventually, Dr. JoAnn Burkholder, an aquatic botanist at North Carolina StateUniversity, got samples of water and fish to her lab to study. She and a labcolleague also became dizzy, disoriented and unable to speak or walk. What shewas looking at under her microscope is what The New York Times described onAugust 27, 1996 as the \"cell from hell\" - a dinoflagellate that can transformfrom a plant algae into an amoeba animal that loves to feed off fish and gives offan aerosol that is very dangerous to breathe. One scientist studying thePfiesteria creature said that when it transforms, it is like grass rising up to eatsheep in a pasture.A few of the fifteen forms that Pfiesteria piscicida can take in its dinoflagellate life cyclefrom plant to animal and back."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Photomicrographs by JoAnn Burkholder, Ph. D., North Carolina State University AquaticBotany Laboratory, Raleigh.This weekend, I talked with the Neuse River Keeper who recently was appointedby Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. to be a representative of the National Water KeeperAlliance which licenses River Keepers throughout North America. Rick Dovehas lived and worked on the Neuse River in North Carolina all his life. He isvery concerned as one of the warmest springs on record has warmed up thewaters to perfect feeding conditions for Pfiesteria.Interview:Rick Dove, Representative, National Water Keeper Alliance and formerRiver Keeper for the Neuse River, North Carolina, New Bern, NorthCarolina: Between the Pamlico and the Neuse Rivers recently approximately300,000 fish have died. Most of those fish, including those swimming around inthe waters now, have open bleeding sores all over their body which ischaracteristic of Pfiesteria.Typical Pfiesteria sores in fish where the dinoflagellate in its amoeba stage consumes fishflesh.Tissue samples are now in laboratories for analysis and to confirm if Pfiesteria is thedefinite culprit.Photograph © 2000 by Rick Dove.YOU'RE SAYING THAT 300,000 HAVE DIED ALREADY AND WE'REONLY IN THE FIRST WEEK OF JULY?That's correct. You know, this year Pfiesteria appears to have turned on earlyand we've seen more fish deaths for this point in time than we've ever seenbefore very early. And of course the concern is that these fish aren't dying fromjust low oxygen. We're seeing those sores on their body. It takes a little time forus to get absolute confirmation from Dr. Burkholder and the lab that Pfiesteria isabsolutely the cause of the fish kill. It takes weeks for that to happen. But I cantell you based on my experience for more than ten years now is what I'm seeingout there has me convinced that Pfiesteria is at work right now and that's notgood so far as public health is concerned.WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THE MENHADEN AND OTHER FISHYOU'VE BEEN LOOKING AT IN THE RIVER SEEM TO HAVE THESEOPEN RED SORES?That's a good question. Earlier, we had a few small fish kills where there wereno sores on the fish and we were relatively certain they were due to low oxygenin the water. But, here recently over the last few weeks when these fish aredying, we're seeing sores on the fish upwards to 90%. So, it's overwhelming thatthese sores are present."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"IF THIS IS THIS BAD BY THE FIRST WEEK OF JULY AND THEWARMEST WEEKS ARE AHEAD OF US, DO YOU THINK THISCOULD END UP BEING A PFIESTERIA KILL SEASONCOMPARABLE TO THE LATE 1980S OR EARLY 1990S?It could, Linda. One of the things we are really scared about is what happenedafter Floyd, in Floyd and after Floyd. When Floyd hit down here, it delivered anawesome amount of polluted water. You could see it moving down the middle ofthe river: hog waste, human waste, toxins, sediments. And because theTar-Pamlico and the Neuse where most of these fish die with Pfiesteria becauseit's dammed in by the Outer Banks, these pollutants don't flush out of here, evenwith a flood not that much gets out from what I'm told by scientists. So, thesepollutants settle out here. We have been really afraid because we knew thesepollutants got delivered and we didn't know what Mother Nature was going todo with them this summer.Well, the summer has started early and the fish kills have started early and allthese are not good signs. But predicting what Mother Nature will do is abusiness for fools because Mother Nature will prove you wrong more times thannot. So, what we've been saying all along is that everything is in place for this tobe a bad year, but we're going to have to wait for Mother Nature to say and sofar it seems like she is saying, 'Look out, boy, I'm coming!'WHAT IS THE STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA DOING IN TERMS OFWARNING THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE WATER?That's a very good question. We've got a very good Health Director in NorthCarolina now. His name is Dr. Dennis McBride. If I could give him sainthood, Iwould. I think he's a spectacular guy. And he has done everything he can fromRaleigh which is about 150 miles up the river here. He's done everything he canto post health warnings and to tell people if you see dead or dying fish or fishwith sores not only get out of the water, get out of the area. But for the mostpart, he has had to leave the individual control of bodies of water to local healthdirectors over which he has no control because that's the way it's set up in NorthCarolina. He doesn't direct the local health directors in the counties.I can tell you here in Craven County our local health director has done verylittle. If he's done anything, I don't know what it is but he hasn't done anything Ican see. I've complained bitterly about it. One day we had a fish kill with 90% ofthe fish had sores. This was at Flanner's Beach. It's a public access beach off theforest right on the Neuse River. The next day I came back and catching fish inthe river with sores. I saw some dying. And there were people in the water,parents, with children as young as 2 and 3 years old in the water. And when Iwent up to them and asked them if there were any signs on the beach, had theyread the paper because there had been some news coverage. And they said theyhadn't seen the news but there were no signs on the beach and nobody was thereto tell them they shouldn't be in the water."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Family swimming at Flanners Beach on the Neuse River in North Carolina the day after10,000 fish with open bleeding sores died right where the family is playing. No warningsignswere posted by local county health officials of the Pfiesteria danger. Photograph © 2000by Rick Dove.One of the world's most prestigious medical journals, The Lancet, has covered areport of the Maryland doctors and scientists who worked on this for GovernorGlenn Denning in Maryland when he sent his doctors down to the Pocomo totake a look at this and whether there were any impacts to human health as aresult of Pfiesteria, they found that there was. And they published their report inThe Lancet which is an incredible feat. That publication accepts only very goodpeer-reviewed work.And I'll tell you something else that's concerning is earlier everybody thoughtthe health impacts from Pfiesteri a were reversible and would go away veryquickly. More and more, they are finding there are residual effects that hang onfor along time. And I have actually seen that here in a number of people whohave gotten sick over the years likely from the exposure to Pfiesteria.HAVE YOU HAD ANY OF THAT COFFEE BROWN STAIN ON THERIVERS YET? OR IS IT TOO EARLY?Oh, we have. And I've seen colors I have NEVER seen before. I actually havephotographs of the river right here where my office is turning red. I mean really abright red!December 14, 1999, Neuse River at New Bern, North Carolina turned bright red from somekind of algae and chemical pollution. Photograph © 1999 by Rick Dove.This happened about two or three months after (Hurricane) Floyd went throughhere. And then, I've seen the typical colors of brown and maroon that we seewhen Pfiesteria outbreaks are beginning or in progress. As I was coming up hereearlier today, knowing that you were going to call, I looked out over the riverand it was a maroon color. It was flat out there today. And I would not besurprised here fairly soon to see another major kill on the Neuse itself.Brown foam and maroon-brown colored water often occur when Pfiesteria is in itstoxic stage that seeks out fish and marine animals to eat. Photograph © 2000 by Rick"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Dove.THAT CHANGE IN COLOR IS RELATED DIRECTLY TO THETRANSFORMATION IN THE DINOFLAGELLATE FROM ITS PLANTVERSION TO ITS ANIMAL VERSION?Dr. Burkholder thinks it's not related to that so much as it is the attack on thefish. When it begins to go after the fish and open up the bleeding sores and thefish get the sores and have this biological decomposition that begins, even insome cases while the fish are still swimming, then you begin to see that.FROM THE BLOOD...Yeah, and just the fish, even those that are alive, just beginning to rot. So, I thinkthere is probably a number of reasons why this water turns the color it does.Some of it may be related directly to the Pfiesteria. Then indirectly to the fish asa direct of getting hit. And then there could be a lot of other things happeningthat I and the scientists don't understand yet to cause the water colors.We know the algae when they bloom, that some of them have colors in them.They can turn a river anywhere from like a red tide, red, - I've seen the river hereturn the color of Florida orange juice. I really have. I have videotape back to1993 and 1994 where you would take a glass or sample bottle of water from theriver and hold it up to a glass of orange juice and they were the same color!THAT WAS SOME KIND OF AN ORANGE ALGAE?It was. We know that. And it was a harmless algae, but it was a sign of too muchnutrients being in the water. It was a winter bloom and it happened in themonths of December, January and February. And Dr. Burkholder came downand studied it and other scientists studied it, and it didn't turn out to be harmful,but it certainly was a sign. The river was telling us something then.RIGHT, BECAUSE ANY TIME THAT ALGAE CAN PROLIFERATEREGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S RED, BROWN, PFIESTERIA ORANY OTHER COLOR, IT MEANS THAT THE CONDITIONS ARETHERE FOR THE ALGAE TO BLOOM WHICH IS TAKING OXYGENFROM THE WATER WHICH CAN THEN KILL THE FISH.That's correct. And most of these things, these algae, they are all natural inNature, but what we're looking at is them out of balance with Nature. And that'swhat happens with a river like the Neuse or the Pamlico. You could probablypick any river in the country where people are using that river as a dumpingground for industrial waste, domestic waste, and just over-development. Whathappens is that a river gets out of balance and then it can't cope within thebounds of itself. The river, for example the Neuse. It took Mother Nature twomillion years to make this river and put her in balance. In the last 50 years,mostly in the last 25 years, we have just totally upset that balance. And now wesee Pfiesteria and this vegetative growth that clogs whole creeks and we see fishdying and see people getting sores and getting sick. I don't think we should besurprised about that.IF THE SPRINGS CONTINUE TO BE WARM AND WARMER EACHYEAR, HOW BAD, RICK, COULD ALL THIS GET?You know, you pose a very good question. I think it could get very bad. I thinkthat global warming is a result of our actions as human beings and what we'vedone to the environment. There are others out there who want to attribute itfrom a cycle or from activities of man we know we've got it. We know the ice"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"poles are melting. We know the oceans are getting warmer. We know because ofthat, the storms are getting greater. But now because of all the pollution we'veput out there, all these nutrients and everything, as these waters begin to warm,we have created the fire necessary to cook the brew. And we should not now besurprised when bad things begin to happen to the animals and the peoplebecause Nature is going to have a tough time coping with what's happening here.And I don't know that we as people are going to be ready for this.A lot of people say to me, Rick, it's a wonderful thing you are doing and theother keepers are doing for Nature. That's a mistake. This isn't about doing thisfor Nature. Mother Nature can take care of herself. And heal herself, even if itmeans she has to take out some or all of us if she wanted to. She could, just toheal herself. What this is about even your coverage of the stories here aboutwhat's going on what this is about is an effort for people to save themselves andtheir children. Mother Nature makes the rules, makes the laws. We need tofigure out how to exist within those rules. We're darn fools most of the timebecause we think we can make our own rules and make Mother Nature justadapt to us. That doesn't work and I think that's what we're going to see as thesewaters and air temperatures are getting warmer.\"More Information:For an excellent book about the discovery of the Pfiesteria dinoflagellate andthe pioneering research ofDr. JoAnn Burkholder at North Carolina State University, see:And the Waters Turned to Blood© 1997 by Rodney BarkerSimon & SchusterWe b s it e s :http://www.neuseriver.com/http://www.pfiesteria.org/http://www.neuseriver.org/http://www.hogwatch.org/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.com"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Republication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
