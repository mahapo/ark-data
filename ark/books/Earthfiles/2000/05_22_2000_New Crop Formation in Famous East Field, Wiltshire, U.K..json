I tried to figure outthe design, walking around the perimeter of the formation which is a bit under200 feet in diameter. I sketched on a bit of paper as I went. But beyondsuspecting a pentacle was part of it, I was befuddled.Then my friend, Nick, borrowed my pen and standing in the center, he sketchedfor awhile and concluded it was a ring with a 5-pointed star in the middle. Butthe star i bisected and those bits flattened or standing in the left side half of thedesign are just the opposite on the corresponding bits in the right hand side. Notonly that, but the confusing part is that the lower portion is quartered. That'swhat threw me off.Possibly, when it's seen from the air, the geometry will consist of a pentacle andan equilateral triangle overlapped and bisected.The formation is now a day old (came down on Saturday, May 20, 2000) andthe barley is springing back up. What appears to be lots of 'magically standingstems' are actually stalks which were never totally flattened and are now the firstto be standing right straight up again."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I also received a message that a formation in barley has been discovered on theMorested Road in Hampshire. The formation is in barley and is rising up fast. Itconsists of scalloped edges approximately twelve inches wide that are likeeyebrows over seven circles. In the middle is an eternity symbol. It measuredapproximately 60 meters diameter in total.\"5-pointed star in circle discovered on May 20, 2000.Pole photograph © 2000 by Peter R.
