When pilot Gilbert Johnson flew over the latest formation on August15th, he might have been the first to discover and photograph it. The next dayon August 16th, Mary and Larry Johnson, who own a health food store in town,saw the formation from Church Avenue near trees that completely obscured the"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"pictogram from nearby and well-traveled Highway 93. The couple asked thefarm owners for permission to enter and told people in town about it. MelodyWatts, who runs a convenience store in Whitefish and investigated the formationin Whitefish last year, heard about the new formation while driving back from avacation on August 20th. She was so excited, she first went to the farm ownerfor permission to get into the new formation before even driving home. Then shereturned in the evening.Interview:Melody Watts, Convenience Store Owner, Whitefish, Montana: \"I had mycamcorder all recharged and all my cameras. And as I walked in, I was filmingand my camcorder battery lasts for at least eight hours. And I knew it wascompletely charged up. I filmed for awhile and all of a sudden the battery lightstarts flashing after about twenty minutes in the circle.THAT MEANS YOU HAD A CAMCORDER WITH A NEW BATTERYTHAT DRAINED DOWN IN 15 TO 20 MINUTES AFTER BEING INT H AT F O R MAT IO N ?Ye s .HAD THAT HAPPENED TO YOU BEFORE IN THE OTHER TWOFORMATIONS IN 1999 AND 1998?I did not get to investigate the one in 1998. And the 1999 one on Highway 40about five to seven miles as the crow flies from these other ones, that one I didnot have my camcorder in there. But I did see oddities with a compass. Itwouldn't hold a directional signal.IN 1999?Ye s .WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE COMPASS IN THIS ONE IN 2000?The compass that I took in wouldn't hold a direction. And also, as we weredoing the aerial shots, I told the pilot (Gilbert Johnson) about some odditieswith compasses. He said, 'Well, to test a real signal, you fly from north to southand south to north. And as we got directly over top of the formation, hiscompass swayed and his mouth fell wide open. He couldn't believe it. So, hehad to turn around and go back and it swayed both directions. Both times, abouta ten degrees sway on his compass. He was very in awe of that.\" Pilot Sees Compass Shift Flying Over Whitefish Wheat FormationI called up Gilbert Johnson who has been flying since 1957 and now runs acharter service and flight school. I asked him to explain what happened with thecompass when he flew over the Whitefish wheat formation.Gilbert Johnson, pilot since 1957, runs charter service and flight school,Kalispell, Montana: \"I was staring at the compass. We (Melody and Gilbert)had just talked about it. She mentioned that - we were talking about cropformations - and she happened to mention that there was compasses that shifted.So, I was curious. So, I held it real steady and we were going right over it. Icould have dropped a flour bag and hit the center of it when it happened. It allof a sudden, BOOM, she just shifted fifteen degrees and the airplane didn'tmove, you know, left wing up, down or anything. I'm pretty certain thatsomething happened. 60% certain."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"HOW CLOSE WERE YOU TO THE GROUND AT THAT POINT?500 feet. I told her we can't get any lower than 500 feet because of the law.There are people in cars and stuff down there. So, I got her down to theminimum.I saw it shift and I had the airplane steady. I perceived a 15 degree shift and Iwas going straight and level. And there wasn't any turbulence. Now, I turnedaround. I made a 180 and went out about a mile and came back exactly andtried to get over the same spot.OVER THE FORMATION IN WHITEFISH?Right. And what happened was - I got right over it. I didn't get anything. Ithought, that's strange. We're right over it and I didn't get anything where I got ashift before. So, it could have been some kind of anomaly. Maybe I got a bumpand didn't realize it. You know, in the air pressure. I mean, the air rising with theheat and stuff. So, then I continued on about 150 to 200 yards passed the cropcircles and I got a 10 degree shift.YOU GOT A 15 DEGREE COMING ONE WAY...Yeah, heading towards the north.THEN YOU TURNED AROUND AND CAME SOUTH....Yeah, and I got a 10 degree shift, but in a different location after I flew over it,south of it.WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO SEEING THAT COMPASSANOMALY?My eyes bugged out. (laughs)\"Melody Watts:MELODY, ANY OTHER ANOMALIES?I did get the pictures back. I took some pictures late in the evening after sunsetand I got some odd spheres in the sky, those little balls of light. There wasnothing at the time that I saw with my eyes.August 26, 2000, Melody Watts took flash camera photographs inside theWhitefish, Montana formation. This frame had one clear translucent sphere and echoes ofother fainter ones.Similar photographs in crop formations and sacred sites have been taken by many peoplethe past few years.Low energy plasmas is one hypothesis, but nothing has yet been proved.

I didn't expect anything until I got my film back. I couldn't takeenough pictures, of course, knowing that the farmer was going to destroy it soon.So, I sat in the middle of the formation and would take pictures around us to seeif I got any oddities. And to my surprise, I did. I could not see anything when Iwas there.THAT'S THE TRANSLUCENT SPHERE?Yes. It was very dry. There was no moisture in the air. My lens was cleanbecause my other pictures had come out of the same camera.CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT NOW ABOUT THE FLOOR LAY INTHIS 2000 FORMATION COMPARED TO WHAT YOU SAW IN 1999?No, the wheat was all laid counter-clockwise in the whole formation. All of itwas laid in the same direction, counter-clockwise, even in the small circles onthe outside of the ring. And the centers were all going in a counter-clockwisedirection.DID YOU LOOK FOR ANY OF THE NODE EXPULSIONS ORLENGTHENED NODES?I think I see them, but I'm not an expert in that field. It looks like there are a fewblown nodes that Nancy has been talking about.THERE WERE HOLES IN THE NODES THEMSELVES.Yes, as far as I can see. There are.\"The BLT Research Team coordinated by Nancy Talbott for biophysicist W.

It's a very small 10 foot circle, actually a babyformation, if you will. But what's interesting about this one is that it has a radiallay pattern. Again, this is in wheat.THIS IS WHERE IT COMES DOWN IN THE MIDDLE AND THEN SPLAYSVERY STRAIGHTLY OUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"That's right. Sprayed out from the center point in all directions to the outeredges of the circle. So, again, it's a very small one but it has that unusual laypattern. And even the reporter who first reported it to me thought it was sounusual that he had never seen anything like that before. So, he thought it wasworth reporting about and he has taken some close-up photographs and from astep ladder just to get some elevation on it. And I should have those in the nextday or two.AT YOUR WEB SITE?Yes, and of the dumbbell as well.WHEN WAS THE RADIAL LAY REPORTED?That would have been August 10th which is the same day, within a day or twoof what we know, that the formation in Ontario was discovered which is a 3circle pattern. The largest circle about 60 feet in diameter, excuse me, 70 feet,and the smallest one approximately 30 feet in diameter. So, again, it's a verysimple configuration, but beautifully laid down from people who have beeninside it. But unfortunately by now, it's been trampled to death by over 1,000visitors. And that was just a very simple formation. Nothing else standing likeyou get in England. And yet, they've already had over 1,000 people go throughit.August 10, 2000 three circles discovered in a barley and oats fieldwithin Oro-Medonte Township, Ontario.Farmer's dogs refused to go anywhere near the formation.Photograph © 2000 by © Julie Langpeter, The Orillia Packet & Times.\"The one thing we've had reported from the farmer in Ontario was - and issomething you've heard, of course, and we've heard many times now - is that hisdogs refused to go anywhere near the formation. They wouldn't go inside it.They wouldn't go near it. And that seemed to change a bit over time for a coupleof weeks after. But initially, they wouldn't go near the thing.AND THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED IN THE LONG PICTOGRAM FORMATIONIN THE EAST FIELD LAST YEAR IS THE DOGS, MANY ANIMALS,WOULD NOT GO IN THAT LONG PICTOGRAM.Yeah, it's like they sense something, pick up on the energy, I don't know what.They can sense something that we don't, I think.I always want people to keep in mind and realize that this isn't just somethingthat goes on in England every summer.
