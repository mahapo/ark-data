We could see them up in the Osage Hills to the eastand southeast, some getting too close for comfort at times.\"I was a teenager at the time and decided to ask a group of friends to go up on ahigh ridge overlooking the town and surrounding area to look for UFOs for fun.We took binoculars and telescopes and had a great time, really not expecting tosee anything. But what we did see startled us greatly that night.\"The writer is Brenda Livingston, an artist, who provided this firsthand reportthat seems to link two unidentified lights in the sky directly with a fire in theRadar Mountain area above Bartlesville, Oklahoma more than thirty years ago. Interview:Brenda Livingston, Artist, The Colony north of Dallas, Texas: \"My groupseparated off a little bit and spotted two bright lights off to the south about twoto five miles away. And they started to descend. They were larger than I wouldexpect from an aircraft or helicopter. Certainly back then, there weren't verymany aircraft going over there or helicopters in the area at that time. The lightswere much larger than you would expect on any kind of aircraft. And there were"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"no other lights on it.\"We started looking with our telescopes and binoculars and got a pretty goodlook at them. They started to descend at an angle looking like they were comingin from the south and descending towards the east slowly. And then one of thelights stayed and began to hover. And the other light began to descend at anangle going closer, almost above the treetops. We could tell where it was atanother place where we used to frequent. And I can't remember, but I think thename was Round Rock Hill or something like that. And it looked right in thatarea and we started getting very excited and nervous about it. But we kept onwatching them. And this other light, the lower one right above the treetops, itseemed to just hover there for awhile. Suddenly while we were watching, itseemed to emit this light - kind of a golden spike coming from underneath it.And it just stayed in that position for quite a few minutes.What color was the upper part emitting the gold spike?White. It was a really bright white light, rounded. And everybody by this timewas starting to gather around. The other group had joined us and we weresharing our binoculars and getting very excited about it trying to figure out whatit was.Through binoculars, could you see any structure anywhere?Not any structure at all. It was total light and very bright. We certainly lookedfor that thinking maybe it was a helicopter, trying to explain it. There just wasn'tany explanation for it. They were just too large and too bright to be a normalaircraft.And that light stayed in that position for quite awhile and then hovered in thatposition without the gold spike and then began to ascend. It ascended at anangle rather haphazardly. It wasn't a very straight line. And it moved very closeto the other light and hovered there very briefly. Then they both moved off tothe southeast pretty rapidly. Within thirty seconds or so, they were gone.We were very stunned and excited and we were really wanting to find out whatit was and what was going on over there. Since we knew where it was, we allhopped into our cars and raced over there, a couple of car loads of us. And wewent around the corner to go on the road that would lead up on to this hill. Andjust before the turnoff to go up the hill, we noticed that the area I mean, we juststopped. It was amazing! The area was charred, burned to a crisp. There was afield area that was rectangular in shape. The grass had been totally burned. Weshined our headlights off in that direction. The car behind us stayed about a fewseconds and they just did a U-turn and left very rapidly. I guess they got scared.It was just a very eerie feeling.There was a large tree directly in front of us which was totally charred insideand out and had fallen over on to the road in front of us. And there were stillflames, some coming out of the middle of the tree and on the branches. Therewere small fires around the area. The area looked like it was about a fourth of amile long and there were trees surrounding the grassy area. Those trees were allcharred and on fire a little bit. It wasn't like a large fire, but there were someflames coming up from those trees."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Computer drawing by Brenda Livingston depicting her teenage memory of charred area,burned and fallen tree across road and scattered fires in grass and other trees afterunidentified light emitted gold beam on to this hill area in summerof 1966/1967. Drawing © 2000 by Brenda Livingston.There were trees in the background which were several hundred yards away thatwere also charred and there were several fires in those trees. Most of the grasswas smoking, although there were a few fires kind of separated out across thegrass area. It was so contained. That's what struck me. It was in a rectangulararea and there was nothing affected nearby. Ordinarily when I've seen fires, theyrace along and create their own little pathways. You'll see some of the fire orleftovers from the fires in patterns coming out from it. This was like it wascontained in a rectangular area. It was very strange!It was such an eerie feeling. It struck me. I could not move. My friend wanted topick up and leave. She was in tears by this point and scared. But I wasmesmerized by this feeling I got at looking how unusual it was and a strangefeeling in the air.Did you go from there back to town to the police or fire department?When it finally hit me that perhaps this was a UFO kind of thing and that it wasvery strange, I finally went into a panic like my friend and turned around and gotout of there at a very rapid rate. We just raced home. I took her immediatelyhome because she was not in good shape. And it really I felt it had died downenough that it wasn't a threat.But if something in the air put a beam down that you could see. Then yougo there and find an entire scorched area with trees burning, isn't thatsomething that would be reported to the police and fire department?Wouldn't everyone want to know what did this?Yes. I agree now at this point in my life I would have done that. But back when Iwas a teenager, I was frightened by it. I was weirded out. I wanted to forget it asfast as possible, actually. I really could not figure out why would they go around if these two objects or lights were the source of this fire, were they the source ofthe other fires? And I wondered why they would go around from place to placeand risk I guess the fires were incidental to whatever they were doing? And ifthey were associated with the other fires in the area.When you went back a month later and were looking at the ground, howwould you compare that charring with other more normal forest charring?What we noticed was there was not any areas that were re-growing. Usually yousee a few sprigs or sprouts. But that whole field area was still looking verycharred and burned. Blackened."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"So, it was a quarter mile by about 600 feet in a rectangle that was almostpure black in color and surrounded by normal trees and plants?Everything was black. And everything around it was normal. It just ended ratherabruptly where the trees that were affected were charred and broken off andthen the trees next to them were normal.\" More Information:I welcome any information from long time Bartlesville, Oklahoma residentsabout fires in the Osage Hills back in either the summer of 1966 or 1967.
