Last month, on July 20th, he was flying overthe Janelle and Randy Bata farm three miles west of Langdon when he saw whatlooked like a tinkertoy of half a dozen circles connected by a path in a wheatfield.Then four days later on July 24th, a dumbbell formation was discovered on theBob Ullyott farm north of Langdon. It was 155 feet long. The local newspaper,the Cavalier County Republican, took an aerial photograph and published it.Discovered July 24, 2000, the large circle was 90 feet diameter;the path connecting it to the ring was 30 feet; the ring was 3 feet wide;the space between the ring and inner flattened small circle was 15 feet; the innercircle was 17 feet diameter.

The larger circle had a distinct outer ringgoing in a counter-clockwise direction and within the middle of this circle, theflow was southwest to northeast straight across.LIKE THE PATH?Yes. And like the radial splay in the smaller circle as far as being straightwithout any swirl. But the outside edge was swirled. And then on the southernedge just to the southeast of the extension, there were bunched stalks that weregoing the opposite direction into the standing wheat. So there was opposing layright at the edge there."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"ANY EXTENDED NODES OR EXPULSION CAVITIES IN THIS ONE?The odd thing about this formation, Linda, is that the nodes were compressed.The nodes were shrunken in.
