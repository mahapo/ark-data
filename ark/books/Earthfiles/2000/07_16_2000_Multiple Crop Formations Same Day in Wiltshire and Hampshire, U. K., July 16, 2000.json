K.,July 16, 2000© 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe East of Corhampton near Petersfield, Hampshire, reported on July 15, 2000.Aerial Photograph © 2000 by Busty Taylor.July 16, 2000 Wiltshire, England - In the past week, there have been nearly adozen formations in southern England and five of them emerged between July15 to 16. Charles Mallett and his wife, Frances, have been studying,photographing and drawing crop formations in England for some time andproduce a great web secton at the cropcircleconnector.com called C& FPhenomenon. I talked with Charles this afternoon about what happened thisweekend.Interview:Charles Mallett, C & F Phenomenon, Horton, Wiltshire, England: \"Acrossinto Hampshire, not far from here about an hour's drive, we had two beautifulformations discovered today. One is so complicated I'm having a hard timedescribing even with a picture in front of me. It's about 300 foot diameteressentially made up of dozens of rings, interlocking, half standing and halfdowned. It's a picture of opposites. I strongly recommend people look atwww.cropcircleconnector.com web site. They will be impressed.This is an approximate 300 feet formation consisting of multiple standing anddowned sections. All the downed sections are essentially replicated by oppositestanding sections, so it's a yin/yang, left and right, positive and negative, verywell balanced and executed."},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"New Alresford near Winchester, Hampshire, reported July 15, 2000.Aerial photograph © 2000 by Busty Taylor.SORT OF LIKE MIRROR OPPOSITES?More or less. It's extremely hard to describe. I've never seen anything quite likethis. It projects in one direction. It does come out of the ground some what ifyou look at it and squint. I can't fathom how this could have been constructedon the ground. I could imagine standing in this thing you would have absolutelyno idea what you were within at all. The construction is amazing. Some of thelines are incredibly thin, thinner than the actual tramlines that run through thefield.And it's partner that arrived the same day today is fairly similar by in anembryonic fashion of the same thing. It's extremely thin lines. To look at theaerial shot - this was too far to travel so I haven't looked at the actual location but the aerial shot, some of the paths are inches wide only which for me rulesout hoaxing ideas. You can't really walk through a crop field without causingsevere d amage.CHARLES, HOW COULD A FEW INCHES BE DONE? IT CAN'T BEDONE ON THE GROUND.Sure. We've seen, not this year, but in previous years we have seen paths goingaround the main formation in oilseed rape one stalk wide. That's about 1 1/4inches wide. One large perfect circle in a field. It's beyond physical execution byhuman hands. It just takes some common sense to look at the image really.THIS PARTNER, THIS EMBRYONIC ONE?It's not the same pattern. It just has a similar feel about it. It's essentially a ringsurrounded by concentric rings interlocking, fairly geometrical. It just looksrelated to its more spectacular big sister.One of the other ones that happened came down last night, or this morning, nextto Avebury, a high profile location for crop circles. It's a huge formation rightnext to the Avenue of Standing Stones. This is an approximately 300 footformation. Incredible. I've never known it this busy. Essentially it's a 250 to 300foot cleanly cut formation and I think it's some kind of nuclear type or symbolicdesign, a motif of some kind.THAT MEANS, CHARLES, THIS MORNING ALONE, THERE WAS ALONG 300 FOOT PICTOGRAM AT AVEBURY; THERE IS THEBEAUTIFUL FLOWER AT PICKED HILL AND THE TWO ATHAMPSHIRE."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Five formations in one night is incredible. We're wondering what's going on. It'svery odd. At the start of the season, nothing was really happening. We weregetting one fairly mediocre formation a week at best. Now, we're getting likeevery night. We're averaging two or three a night. Last night was a bit intense. Ihope it doesn't continue that much.IT'S AS IF SOMETHING IS RAISING THE LEVEL AGAIN.Yes, the fifth formation is an event harks back to the Basket formation that wascut last year. We had another one a few days ago in Alton Barnes, a 100 footcircle with the floor entirely woven and spun and laid down in a flat typemanner.SOME PEOPLE ARE CALLING IT A 'TRISCUIT,' THAT ONE FROMADAMS GRAVE NEAR ALTON BARNES (FOUND JULY 12TH).Right. Well, the fifth one last night was at Furz Hill, also near Alton Barnes.This is the real hub of activity. It's a major hot spot. It's about 150 foot ring andinside the ring is a standing section with about 8 to 10 smaller circles whichappear to make up some kind of pattern. I don't know what. It almost looks likea star chart almost. But the actual flattened area of the ring is again woven in afour directional flow. It's been swirled down clockwise or anti-clockwise.Wherever you stand, you see wheat going in four different directions interwovenlike a basket basically. Very impressive.The geographical spread of these formations has been more spread out aroundsouthern England this year, quality formations. Normally we get the major eventhere around Avebury and Alton Barnes area and then they sort of thin out asthey go across southern England. This year, though, we've had a lot hundreds ofmiles across southern England. A lot of them aren't even getting photographedbecause no one flies anywhere and takes pictures of crop circles except for thisarea. But there has been a lot way, way up north, hundreds of miles away andgood quality formations, too. So, they do seem to be spreading out some whatunless it's just a quirky glitch this year.WHAT IS THE POSITION OF THE BBC AND OTHER MEDIA INENGLAND ON THIS EXTRAORDINARY FLURRY OF OUTSTANDINGFORMATIONS?As far as TV goes, BBC in particular, all they are interested in is the hoax idea.They regularly get or hire people from London whom I'm very familiar with toget them to make fairly basic formations. Essentially they are involved in, Ibelieve, a misinformation campaign. To put this hoaxing idea into some kind ofcontext, myself and my partner sat on the side of a hill, watched the BBC and ateam of people, about six people, make a corn circle. It took them a good manyhours, four or five hours, to make a fairly non-elaborate pattern: a bunch ofcircles arranged in a large circle with diminishing sized circles coming off theperimeter. From a distance, it looked fairly impressive about 200 feet away. Ittook them more hours to do it than you get in darkness in the night. The nightshere are very short this time of year.THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK THAT AMERICAN AUDIENCESFORGET THAT IN THE ISLANDS OF THE BRITISH ISLES, AT THISTIME IN THE SUMMER, THE SUN IS STILL PRETTY BRIGHT AT 9O'CLOCK. IT'S STILL TWILIGHT AT 10ish, AND THE SUN IS UP BY4:30 TO 5 AM.Right. This time of year, we get four hours of darkness. Apart from those fourhours of good quality blackness, you can see into fields. It took the BBC team ofpeople approximately four to five hours to make a fairly rudimentary formation."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"The moment they finished it, we walked into it to examine it. That's what we do.We want to experience what their capabilities are. And what we were looking aton the ground was stamped down corn, smashed to the floor. No coherence tothe way it's laid. No waves in the corn, no fluidity, no banks up on the cornerwhere the whatever it is has whipped around the corners. It was entirelyinconsistent with what we see in at least 90% of crop circles we examine.Some times all you need to do is see an aerial image. I mean that should beenough to make anybody think. A thousand foot long fractal consisting of 200circles! If it carries on at this exponential rate, we'll end up with a helluva a lot. Iguess on average we're getting 150 a year. I think we'll probably get a similaramount, but the quality is the main thing this year. Some of these multi-dimensional patterns are incredible. We're supposed to go out and measure themand some are so difficult! You walk into a space in a wheat field on flat groundwhere you can see the formation disappearing in the distance over the side of ahill. That's when it would dawn on anybody for people in America if they couldgo in them that when you stand in one of these things and see it disappearinginto the distance, like hundreds of circles or hundreds of squares in some weirdpattern. It's undeniable that something incredible is happening here.\"We b s it e s :http://cropcircleconnector.com/signsofthetimes/signsofthetimes.htmlhttp://www.cropcircleconnector.com/Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright © 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
