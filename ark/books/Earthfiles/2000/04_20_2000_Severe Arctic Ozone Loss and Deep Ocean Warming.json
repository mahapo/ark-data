The specific concern wasozone levels. The stratosphere was much colder than normal this winter whichmakes ozone deterioration worse. And even though satellites and groundinstruments monitor the atmosphere, there hadn't been direct measurement byinstruments on a high flying plane since 1992. The result? More than 60 percentof the Arctic ozone at 11 miles above the North Polar region had been depleted.The European Commission announced, \"These are among the largest chemicallosses at this altitude observed during the last ten years.\"The lead U. S. atmospheric physicist on this mission is Dr. Paul Newman at theNASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. Since the ozonelayer was supposed to be improving after nations agreed in the MontrealProtocol at the beginning of the 1980s to cut back chlorofluorocarbon emissionsknown as CFCs, I asked Dr. Newman why ozone over the Arctic today is nowfifteen percent below where it was in the early 1970s?Interview:Paul Newman, Ph.D., Atmospheric Physicist, NASA Goddard Space FlightCenter, Greenbelt, Maryland: \"The reason that we now have large ozonelosses is, of course, because in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, we were producing a lotof CFCs. So, the CFC growth rate was fairly fast. And the time it takes to comeout of the atmosphere is very, very long. So, what you're going to have is ozonelosses as CFCs built up over the past two decades. We guaranteed that we weregoing to have ozone losses well into the middle of the next century.Now, this year in particular was bad for a couple of reasons. First of all, as Imentioned, there's a lot of chlorine up there in the stratosphere. In fact, there isa lot of chlorine down here in the lower atmosphere. We're breathing thoseCFCs right now. But because you've got a lot of chlorine up there, that chlorinegets broken down into forms that are fairly ozone benign. What happens is thatwhen those benign forms of chlorine come in contact with polar stratospheric"},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"clouds these very beautiful clouds we see up there in the Arctic they getconverted into a chlorine form that is very reactive and can destroy ozone veryfast.The second ingredient here is we have all the chlorine we need. But the secondingredient, it has to get very cold to form this polar stratosphere clouds. Onceyou form the polar stratosphere clouds, then you put the chlorine in a reactiveform that can destroy the ozone rapidly. And that's the difference between whatwe saw in the past and what we now see. In the past there were polarstratospheric clouds, but there was no chlorine. Now, we have both polarstratospheric clouds and a lot of chlorine so we get a lot of reactive chlorine thatdestroys ozone very rapidly.NOW IS THAT TIED TO GISS'S COMPUTER MODEL THATPROJECTED THAT WITH GLOBAL WARMING, A WARMING ATTHE LOWER ALTITUDE IN THE ATMOSPHERE, THAT THERECOULD BE A CONSEQUENTIAL INCREASING COLD IN THEHIGHER STRATOSPHERE?The GISS model has forecasted colder temperatures because of greenhouse gaschanges. So, we're beginning to be a bit more worried that in fact the reasonwe're having these colder winters is because of increased greenhouse gasses. Butwe don't have a one-to-one connection between those two things.What's happening is that yes, ironically, the greenhouse changes will warm thesurface and they will cool the stratosphere. Because the stratosphere gets colder,you get more polar stratospheric clouds which means you convert the benignform of chlorine into a highly reactive form of chlorine which then destroysozone very rapidly. So, the connection is that it's the greenhouse gasses that arecreating more polar stratospheric clouds which then causes more ozone loss.IN THE MOST ACCURATE COMPUTER MODELS THAT YOU AREWORKING WITH NOW, WHAT ARE THE IMPLICATIONS FOR THENEXT 20 YEARS IF OZONE LOSS OVER THE ARCTIC AND THEANTARCTIC CONTINUE TO BE SEVERE?The implications are in the end what happens to low ozone air is it gets mixedacross the Northern Hemisphere. So, mid-latitudes if we have a severe Arcticloss, that low ozone air gets mixed down into the mid-latitudes and it willreduce the amount of ozone in the mid-latitudes where we live. And that meansyou will get a slightly increased ultraviolet radiation at the surface. And ofcourse, increased ultra violet radiation means things like more severe sunburns,or sunburns take a shorter time to occur. And all the health consequences ofincreased ultraviolet radiation on the surface. That's what we're principallyworried about.AND SKIN CANCERS.Skin cancers are directly related to your total amount of solar exposure. So, aconsiderable increase in UV radiation means more skin cancer if people don'tchange their behavior. Don't get those sunburns. Wear your sunscreen and wearyour hat. That's the best guidance I can give everybody.WHAT KIND OF REDUCTION IN OZONE OVER THE UNITEDSTATES ARE WE EXPERIENCING NOW?If you go back into the 1970s and look at the levels we had back then, there'sbeen about something like an 8 to 10% reduction in ozone over the UnitedStates during the springtime. Which is quite a bit of reduction and something toworry about.BUT DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA IN COMPUTER MODELS HOW MUCHLOSS OF OZONE WOULD IT TAKE BEFORE WE WOULD HAVE ASERIOUS AND IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCE ON SURFACE LIFE?I don't really see that happening. The worst thing I've heard of I actually have"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"heard of incidents where the ozone hole, the edge of the ozone hole has passedover the Falkland Islands. In fact, I heard of a young girl who decided to go outsun bathing on the same day that the rim of the ozone hole drifted over andwithin five minutes she had second degree burns.But that was a case of the ozone hole drifting fairly far north away fromAntarctica. It had very low ozone levels and a very high sun.BUT YOUR POINT IS THAT IN THAT CONDITION A PERSON ONTHE GROUND COULD GET SECOND DEGREE BURNS OVER THEIRENTIRE BODY WITHIN FIVE MINUTES.On the exposed parts of the body.HOW FAR INTO THIS 21ST CENTURY WILL WE CONTINUE TO GOWITH A LOT OF OZONE LOSS BEFORE WE'RE NOT HAVING SUCHHUGE HOLES AGAIN?Yeah. Well, the ozone holes will begin to go away sometimes in the middle ofthe next century, 2050 or 2070 or so.ACTUALLY WE WON'T HAVE BIG LOSSES OVER THE ARCTIC ANDANTARCTIC BY THEN IF EVERYTHING CONTINUES TO HEAL ASIT IS NOW?That's right. Now the worry about the Arctic is that the actual recovery of ozonein the Arctic will be delayed by greenhouse gasses.GLOBAL WARMING.That's right.SO IN SUMMARY, WE ARE IN A TIME IN WHICH THE ARCTIC ANDTHE ANTARCTIC HOLES COULD ACTUALLY CONTINUE TO BEWORSE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS BEFORE THEY GETBETTER, DEPENDING UPON WHAT DOES HAPPEN WITH GLOBALWARMING AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO OZONE DETERIORATION.BUT THAT IN APPROXIMATELY 50 OR 60 YEARS, IF ALL ELSECONTINUES TO HEAL IN THE OZONE, WE COULD BE BACK TOEARLY 1970 LEVELS?That's right. If chlorine and bromine compounds continue to decrease as theyappear to be doing right now, global warming will lead to a cooling of thestratosphere which should make the problem a little bit worse, but eventuallychlorine and bromine are going to decrease in the stratosphere and that will leadto a recovery of ozone levels in the stratosphere.\"Deep Ocean Temperature IncreaseIN ADDITION TO GLOBAL WARMING MAKING THE STRATOSPHERECOLDER AND OZONE HOLES BIGGER, FOR THE FIRST TIME THERE ISNOW HARD SCIENTIFIC DATA THAT THE OCEANS ARE WARMING UP,TOO. IN THE MARCH 30TH, 2000 JOURNAL, SCIENCE, THERE IS AREPORT BY SYDNEY LEVITUS, CHIEF OF THE OCEAN CLIMATE LABAT NOAA, THAT SUMMARIZES FIVE MILLION TEMPERATUREPROFILES MEASURED IN THE WORLD'S OCEANS OVER THE PASTHALF CENTURY. THE OCEANS HAVE WARMED UP .11 DEGREESFAHRENHEIT AS FAR DOWN AS TEN THOUSAND FEET. THEGREATEST WARMING WAS AT 900 FEET WHERE THE AVERAGE HEATCONTENT INCREASED BY .56 DEGREES F., A LITTLE MORE THANHALF A DEGREE.JIM HANSEN, DIRECTOR OF NASA'S GODDARD INSTITUTE FOR SPACESTUDIES, SAID COMPUTER MODELS PREDICTED THAT EVENTUALLY\"GLOBAL WARMING WOULD HEAT THE OCEANS TO THISMAGNITUDE. SO, NOW THIS TEMPERATURE DATA CONFIRMS THATTHE EARTH IS HEATING UP.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"I ASKED NOAA'S SYDNEY LEVITUS IF HE WAS SURPRISED BY THEDEEP OCEAN TEMPERATURE INCREASE.Sydney Levitus, Director, Ocean Climate Laboratory, National OceanicData Center, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, SilverSpring, Maryland: \"Well, one of the major surprises was that of the totalincrease of heat content over the last 40 years half of it is coming from depthsbelow 300 meters, or approximately a thousand feet. This was really unexpectedthat these changes from this region of the ocean would be so large. And it reallychanges our thinking. We have to now consider the deep ocean to be much moreactive on periods of 40 years or so than we had ever previously thought.Another surprise was just the extreme state in which the North Atlantic has goneinto during the past several years, particularly in 1998. There was warming inthe sub-tropical North Atlantic that really exceeded anything we expected basedon all historical data we have. So, we know the atmosphere has becomeextremely warm and parts of the ocean have also become extremely warm. Andthe degree to which it became warm in the North Atlantic really surprised us.THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WOULD BE IN RELATIONSHIP TOTHE WHOLE QUESTION OF: ARE WE IN A SERIOUS GLOBALWARMING THAT'S RELATED TO GREENHOUSE GASSES WHATDOES THIS NEW DATA SAY ABOUT THAT QUESTION?For many years, these models did not include the ocean and the modelspredicted much larger increases in atmospheric temperatures than have beenobserved. And so, critics said the models are too sensitive. And the climatemodelers responded that, 'Well, we believe this heat is going into the oceans.'And our results confirm that a lot of the heating has occurred during the last 40years and in fact, quantitatively, the increase we see is consistent with thepredictions made by the climate modelers. And so, it lends strong support to thecase that's been made that we're going to see an increase in atmospherictemperatures due to increasing greenhouse gasses.The United States has experienced the warmest January to March period ever,according to 106 years of record-keeping compiled by NOAA. The latest data also showthatJune 1999 to March 2000 was the warmest June to March on record.

This has been happening in the northern North Atlantic since 1971.But it's very difficult for us to separate out natural variability from what we callhuman-induced or anthropogenic affects.BUT ISN'T THIS NEW DATA THAT YOU HAVE GATHERED IN THELAST SEVEN YEARS REALLY PILING UP ON THE SIDE THATSOMETHING REALLY OUTSIDE OF STATISTICAL ABNORMALITIESIN THE EARTH'S CHANGES IS BEGINNING TO HAPPEN IF ATHOUSAND FEET DOWN THE OCEANS HAVE WARMED UPALMOST HALF A DEGREE.Well, that's a very good point. And the evidence is pointing towards, in my view,towards human-induced affects. But we have acquired these data and publishedthese results and we will be doing much more work with these data in order tosort out the affects of natural variability versus human-induced changes. Andpersonally, I believe that we're seeing human-induced changes in the atmosphereand the ocean. But I'm being somewhat conservative because I think we needmore time to examine the data. We need to keep building better data bases. But Idon't believe the results are going to change. I think we're going to see there is apreponderance of evidence now that we're seeing a human-induced warming.WOULD THE RECENT BREAK OFF ON THE ROSS ICE SHELF INTHE ANTARCTIC IT WAS A HUGE BLOCK OF ICE TWICE THE SIZEOF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WOULD THAT BE RELATED IN ANYWAY TO O C E AN WAR MIN G ?It's related to warming of the atmosphere and ocean, probably. Parts of theAntarctic have been warming. And they have been warming for quite a longtime, even before the build up of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. So, that'swhat I mean when I say there's natural variability also. The earth is still comingout of the last Ice Age which reached its peak 18,000 years ago. And so, it'sprobably due to both. But certainly, if the atmosphere continues to warm, wemay see increased break off of ice masses from the Antarctic, as well as meltingon part of the Greenland Ice Sheet. I think some of the more recent findings arethat the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is much more stable than previously thought,but that the Greenland Ice Sheet is less stable than previously thought.So, there is really no question that sea level has risen even in the past century Ithink it's on the order of about a foot, or about 6 inches to a foot. We know thatsea level rise is occurring. We have very good evidence of it.ISLANDS ARE GOING UNDER IN THE PACIFIC.Yeah, and in some coastal areas, subsidence there is not only sea level rise, butin some areas like the northeast part of North America the land is sinking. It'sstill showing changes due to the melting away of the continental ice caps thatwere at a maximum 18,000 years ago. So, locally you can have not only changesdue to global sea level rise, but sea level rise due to land subsidence.YOU HAVE TWO THINGS GOING ON LAND CAN BE SINKINGWHILE THE OCEANS ARE RISING.Yeah, exactly. And that really increases the affect. These are going to havetremendous implications for the future and what we need to do. But the fearagain is not so much if they are long term small changes, one can mitigate. Youhave to move populations. You can build dikes in some areas. But, if there is anabrupt change because the climate system has changed quickly on a period of adecade, we're not going to be able to mitigate that.\" Colder Stratosphere TemperaturesDrew T. Shindell, Ph.D., Associate Research Scientist, NASA GoddardInstitute for Space Studies (GISS) and Center for Climate SystemsResearch, Columbia University, New York City, N. Y.:\"So as we see a trend towards colder and colder stratospheres, we expect and we"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"seem to be seeing over the past two decades or so a trend towards increasingwesterly winds near the surface in the winter time. And what affect this has isthat it actually leads to during the winter warmer temperatures over thecontinents because the oceans are relatively warm compared to the land. And aswe get increasing westerly winds, you get warm air from the Pacific blowing overNorth America and warm air from the Atlantic blowing over Eurasia. So, weexpect an increasing trend towards warmer and warmer temperatures over thecontinents over the winter time. And that's actually been what we've beenseeing. During the 1990s, we've seen there is still a lot of variability.Occasionally we'll get a lot of snow. But typically winters here have been verywarm. And for the lower 48 states in the U. S., we've had three of the warmestwinters on record including the warmest winter on record during the 1990s.So, it looks like we could expect as the stratosphere continues to cool fromglobal warming, more and more of this. And we'll have more years with lesssnow and warmer temperatures during the winter.IS THERE ANY HYPOTHESIS THAT EVENTUALLY WITH THISDISPARITY IN TEMPERATURE BETWEEN THE STRATOSPHEREAND THE LOWER LATITUDES THAT ARE WARMER, THAT ITCOULD ACTUALLY KICK INTO GEAR SOME KIND OF EFFORT TOBALANCE OUT THE STRATOSPHERE AND THE LOWER, CAUSINGSOME HUGE ABRUPT CHANGE IN GLOBAL WEATHER?I'm not sure the atmosphere would respond in that way, or that anybody thinksthat's very likely. The lower atmosphere and the upper atmosphere tend to stayfairly separate in many ways because air moves around quite freely in the loweratmosphere. In the stratosphere, things are very segregated. That's what the name\"stratosphere\" refers to, how stratified the layers are. There is very little mixingin the vertical direction.But one thing that is quite interesting is that with this increase in westerly windsat the surface, you tend to bring colder air coming off of North America into theNorth Atlantic and you tend to speed up the strength of the ocean air in theArctic Ocean. So, this is a circular, circum-polar circulation that flows aroundthe Arctic Ocean counter-clockwise. It's driven by the westerly winds. So, if youspeed up the westerly winds, the circulation increases and what this does, ittends to increase the flow of Arctic ice out in between Greenland andScandinavia which is the only big outlet out of the Arctic Ocean. And this tendsto bring fresh water into the North Atlantic.This is also something that has been very striking in observations over the pastseveral decades. From submarine measurements from the 1950s and morerecently in the 1990s, if we compare those two, it looks like we've lost about40% of the Arctic ice. So, it's a huge change in the amount of ice that's stillpresent in the Arctic Ocean. But as this comes out into the North Atlantic, it canchange ocean circulation. And the ocean circulation has a really profound effecton climate. All you have to do is look at something like the difference betweenthe climate in New York City and the climate in southern Italy, which is aboutthe same latitude. And Europe is much, much warmer because ocean circulationbrings up a lot of heat to the northern latitudes.And the same thing if you look at the western coast of the United States. NewYork is about the same latitude as the Oregon and California border whichcertainly doesn't get nearly the cold weather that New York does. And this againis related to the ocean circulation.So, if we can shut off the ocean circulation to some extent by bringing out a lotof fresh water ice from the Arctic, we could have a profound effect on theclimate. And without the ocean circulation again, if you just look at things at thesame latitude Moscow is about the same latitude as Scotland. And Moscowcertainly has much more severe winters. So, if we shut off this ocean that'swarming western Europe, we expect that could plunge into a really, really cold"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"time. And the same type of thing could happen in the western part of NorthAmerica with Seattle suddenly starting to look like other cities at the samelatitude.LIKE BUFFALO.Right, and even quite a bit farther north than Buffalo. So, it could get reallycold if something like that were to happen. Again, it's a little bit counter-intuitive when we think of global warming as making everything warmer. But theocean circulation has just such an enormous power that if we change that tosome extent, we can throw everything off. And while the whole planet might begetting warmer by half a degree, if suddenly the ocean circulation changestemperatures by twenty degrees, then global warming becomes actually a smallworry. These type of things, these big circulation changes, could just have ahuge impact.BECAUSE IF EUROPE AND THE WESTERN UNITED STATESSUDDENLY GOT VERY COLD WITHIN A FEW YEARS, IT WOULDAFFECT GROWING SEASONS AND THE ECONOMY ANDEVERYTHING VERY RAPIDLY.Sure. And there's no way that a forest that drops a pine cone and it rolls downthe side of a hill. That's how much it can migrate from generation to generation.Or perhaps a squirrel can pick it up and carry it a little ways. But while peoplecan move to address the climate change, things like a forest it takes centuries fora forest to move a matter of tens of miles. So, there is no way the ecosystemcould cope with such a very dramatic response like that.\"We b s it e s :http://www.giss.nasa.gov/http://www.noaa.gov/Credits Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.All Rights Reserved.www.earthfiles.comearthfiles@earthfiles.comRepublication and redissemination of the contents of thisscreen or any part of this website are expresslyprohibited without prior Earthfiles.com written consent.Privacy Policy | Terms & ConditionsRefund Policy Copyright Â© 1999 - 2009, Earthfiles.com /DigitalEyeCandy.caAll rights reserved."}]
