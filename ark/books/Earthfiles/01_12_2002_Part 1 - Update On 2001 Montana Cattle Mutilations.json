Twenty-seven years ago in 1975-1976, one center of animal mutilation activity was around Great Falls, Malmstrom AFB and the Minuteman missile sites in Cascade County. Polaroid by Sheriff Tex Graves, Logan County, northeastern Colorado, 1976.

The mutilations had first made national and international news in September 1967 when an Alamosa, Colorado mare was found dead with flesh stripped from the neck up.

The ground was dry, powdery dust and there were no signs of any tracks around the dead horse, including her own hoof tracks. But investigators found her apparent last tracks one hundred feet from her body. Her feet had moved in a circle of frenzied tracks as if she were trying to run, but was somehow held in one spot. (See An Alien Harvest .) Since June 2001, Pondera County Deputy Sheriff Dan Campbell has been investigating another rash of Montana cattle mutilations in his and nearby counties that include the following fourteen cases, plus a possible other half dozen from a rancher west of Conrad who never reported them. Investigated Montana Cattle Mutilation Cases in 2001: June 12, 2001 - Don Reishus, Depuyer (Pondera County) - Mutilated cow. June 12, 2001 - Karl Rappold, Depuyer (Pondera County) - Alive bull with severed tail. June 26, 2001 - Mark Taliaferro, Depuyer (Pondera County) - Mutilated cow with blue-green color on jaw tissue. August 6, 2001 - Steve Young, Fort Shaw (Cascade County) - Mutilated cow. August 15, 2001 - Larry Elings, Browning (Glacier County) - Mutilated yearling. August 15, 2001 - Doug Banka, Belt (Cascade County) - Mutilated cow. August 31, 2001 - Gerald Miller, Conrad (Pondera County) - Mutilated cow. September 24, 2001 - Jim Vandenbos, Conrad (Pondera County ) - Mutilated cow with \"burned off\" hair. October 6, 2001 - Everett King, Valier (Pondera County) - Mutilated Charolais cow in impact crater. October 21, 2001 - New Miami Hutterite Colony, Dupuyer (Pondera County) - Two mutilated cows. October 28, 2001 - Robert Lettenga, Conrad (Pondera County) - Mutilated cow. November 1, 2001 - Glen Bouma, Conrad (Pondera County) - Mutilated 8-month-old steer calf. December 8, 2001 - Dan Majerus, Conrad (Pondera County) -"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Mutilated 13-year-old cow. Deputy Campbell traveled to the Mark Taliaferro ranch to investigate the June 26, 2001 cow and took several photographs of the stripped jaw and adjacent tissue which had a light blue-green discoloration. He contacted the National Institute for Discovery Science in Las Vegas, Nevada (NIDS), a privately funded organization which researches the animal mutilation mystery. NIDS asked Deputy Campbell to cut off the cow's entire head and ship it to Las Vegas for examination. On January 3, 2002, NIDS released at its website, \"Investigation of a Report of Animal Mutilation in Dupuyer, Montana on June 27, 2001.\" That report identifies the blue-green substance as a compound called oxindole, a tranquilizer not approved by the Food and Drug Administration. NIDS's Deputy Administrator, Colm Kelleher, speculated that the oxindole was used to sedate the animal. However, Deputy Campbell said he did not see any needle puncture marks on the cow at the site of the blue-green substance when I talked with him earlier today.

Interview: Dan Campbell, Pondera County Deputy Sheriff, Conrad, Montana: Case File for Mark Taliaferro, June 26, 2001 \"Of the eleven cases in your county in 2001, was there any other case that had that green substance on it? Not that we came up with. We didn't show any punctures on that one, but then this is the first one that any of us had really done, so, I guess we didn't know what the hell we were doing, basically. I mean, we were digging for what we could find and going for that."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Deputy Dan Campbell examining rancher Mark Taliaferro's cow found mutilated June 26, 2001 near Depuyer, Montana. Photograph © 2001 by Pondera County Sheriff's Office. You had the green substance on the jaw that had been stripped, but you did not find and send into NIDS a puncture mark on that cow? Nope. On that one, what we sent in was like a pucker in the hide on the left front shoulder, like a clamp mark was put on there.\" Case File for Everett King, October 6, 2001 Another of Dan Campbell's cases was reported to his office on October 6, 2001. That was Everett King's 7-year-old Charolais cow found sunk into rock-hard soil as if dropped from above. Not only was there a crater, the animal was in the wrong pasture. The plowed ground was a summer fallow pasture, not for grazing cows. This cow also had the now-famous serrated edge found in several animal mutilations since the 1970s. Seven-year-old Charolais cow rolled by Dep. Sheriff Dan Campbell up out of \"crater\" in which her large, 1500-pound body had been found dead and mutilated as if dropped from the air. In fact, it was the wrong pasture of summer fallow ground in which no other cattle had been placed. Photograph © 2001 by Pondera County Sheriff's Office. Deputy Dan Campbell: \"Yeah, the King cow wasn't missing the tongue, wasn't missing the jaw. It was missing an eye and an ear, half the udder. We took samples of what looks like an injection site on one of the legs and then we took a really good photograph of the cut made around the rectum and the female organ there. The vagina? Yeah, and that goes all the way up under the tail head. Was this only hide deep? She had been cored, but the marks itself, the cut was just precise. It's maybe 3/16th of an inch and leaves a little notch, kind of like a pinking sheerer (scissors), only not as severe as a pinking sheerer."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"This is a notched cut? Right. Leaves just a perfect. Notched or serrated mutilation cut on Everett King cow on October 6, 2001, similar to other serrated edges since the 1970s.

Those notched cuts have come up from the early 1970s in Great Falls up to the present, but I've had photographs of these notched edges from the Great Falls County Sheriff's office from the 1975 to 1976 time period. That's in my book, An Alien Harvest . You can see what that looks like. And they compare to other serrated edges over the years. So, it sounds like this fits into that serrated edge cut that has always been puzzling. Yes. And this one, this cow here, she was sunk into the earth. She was in a plowed field. And when we rolled her out of it, the ground underneath her was just hard like a rock. I mean, I stomped up and down on it with my boot, but couldn't leave even the smallest of an impression. She was a big cow. She probably weighed 1400 or 1500 pounds. How deep a crater had her body made? I am going to say four to five inches. This was definitely one of those cratered as if her body had been dropped from the air straight down?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Ye s .

That has been reported over the years as well, and that's why law enforcement as far as my reporting and interviews go back, the sheriffs I talked to from 1979 on working on (the documentary) A Strange Harvest , there were so many discussions of broken bones and craters. And it was the sheriffs and deputies back in the 1970s who were saying whatever is doing this has to be doing it from the air because these animals appear to be dropped. Well, that's the first one we actually noticed an impression in the ground. And the ground is pretty hard anyways. We haven't had any moisture to speak of, so even the plowed ground is hard. I know that Mr. King told the Great Falls Tribune that as far as he was concerned, this was surgery on his cow because to his eye the excisions in the hide had to fall in that category. You were there. Would you agree? I would agree. You bet I would.\" Above is clean excision of the udder from Everett King's Charolais cow discovered October 6, 2001 south of Valier, Montana.

This was the oldest animal among the mutilations, had an unusual bloodless, two-inch-diameter hole near a leg, and a neighbor reported to Dan Campbell have electrical fluttering in his house and seeing bright lights on one of the nights the week the cow died. 13-year-old cow found dead and mutilated by rancher Dan Majerus only 500 yards from his house on December 8, 2001. Photograph © 2001 by Pondera County Sheriff's Office. Dep. Sheriff Dan Campbell: \"This is probably the oldest cow we had. He figured her at about thirteen years old. It was the last cow he had left after selling. He'd sold the rest of the good cows. This was kind of a pet. He kept it around. She was cored in the vaginal area and rectum. She was missing, I'm going to say, four feet of hide from about her naval would be all the way through the back legs. The udder was gone. The eye was gone. Tongue was there. What happened to the rectal area? I would say it was tampered with, but not cored out as much in the vaginal area as some of the others. Like some of them, it was one big hole. But this one looked like she had a serious rash. The tail was there? The tail was there, but all the bag was gone on this one. There was also blood spray on this cow, on the one leg. Was that blood spray near where that 2-inch diameter hole was? Yes. But there is no blood on the ground. Any tracks? Nope. This one was clearly was laying in a way that again challenges how did anyone get to the cow in the first place? Exactly. And this one was within 500 yards of the owner's house. When was the last time he saw her alive? About a week prior. Had he heard anything the night before? I have one guy to talk to. He said that he noticed on a weekend that his lights had fluttered and he saw bright lights. (The cow) was found one day and he phoned in the next day that he had seen lights the night before. He lives maybe a mile from (the Majerus house.) After eleven mutilations in 2001, what goes through your mind about who"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"or what could be killing these animals? I'm going to catch 'em. Sooner or later, I'll get 'em. We've got our first evidence coming in. It's a sedative that is not FDA-approved. So, hopefully we can get a list of who does have it and who does use it. That was the green substance I talked about in the head. The problem is that every once in awhile over the last forty some years, a sedative has been located in some. But you've got to accommodate 50 years of evidence. And why would there be a mixture of a sedative on one with the multiple eyewitnesses of beams of light raising these animals up? Well, takes a better person than me to come up with that one, I guess. I think there are ships out there that could do it. I think there is a lot of things we don't know about.\" Continued in Part 2.
