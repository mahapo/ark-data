Stringfield: ALLEGED SECRET GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS \" Government printed letterheads of all kinds have been used in UFO research to serve nefarious purposes. Government memoranda letterheads are such a vehicle and are variously entitled, 'Office Memorandum - United States Government' and 'United States Government Memorandum.' One example of 'Office Memorandum - United States Government' is an alleged letter sent to the Director of the FBI from a Guy Hottel, SAC, Washington, D. C., Subject: Flying Saucers, Information concerning; dated March 22, 1950.' The letter, supposedly declassified and cleared by the FOIA and well circulated among researchers as bona fide, reads as follows: The following information was furnished to SA (entire section of this paragraph censored). March 22, 1950, Memo to FBI Director: 'An investigator for the Air Force stated that three so-called flying saucers had been recovered in New Mexico. They were described as being circular in shape with raised centers, approximately 30 feet in diameter. Each one was occupied by three bodies of human shape, but only 3 feet tall, dressed in metallic cloth of very fine nature. Each body was bandaged in a manner similar to the blackout suits used by speed pilots and test pilots. According to Mr. (censored) informant, the saucers were found in New Mexico due to the fact that the Government has a very high-powered radar set-up in that area and it is believed the radar interferes with the controlling mechanism of the saucers. No further evaluation was attempted by SA (censored) concerning the above.' COMMENT: In one instance, when this memo was photocopied and published in UFO...Contact From Reticulum by Stevens and Herrmann, for some unaccountable reason my name appeared in script at the bottom of the page. Although probably an innocent annotation without conspiratorial ties, it prompted one querulous buff to believe that I had been somehow implicated with the FBI in such secret matters. Still unresolved is another document alluded to in my articles appearing in the MUFON UFO Journal, December 1980 and September 1981. Using a modified masthead, viz., 'United States Government Memorandum,' a copy of this document dated July 22, 1978, has been in my possession since the spring of 1980, but I have withheld disclosure. According to its source, the memorandum was intended for me to use as evidence, if needed, to support photographs he sent to me for public release and to back up his claim of a frame-up by authorities when they learned that he possessed photographs and other sensitive information about crashed UFOs, the preserved alien corpses and other Top "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Secret projects. Allegedly, directed to a judge in the United States District Court, the memorandum is herewith published for the first time, excluding names and places, as follows: July 22, 1978, Memo to U. S. District Court Judge: 'The essential role that must be taken is one where the defendant must be made to be viewed as an offender without identification to the UFO problem. Only as a last resort can the Defense Attorney evoke Section III, 210a, as it relates to civilian involvement under Espionage Laws, J8 US Code 793, 794: briefly, the unauthorized transmission of the contents of TOP SECRET reports. This certainly will alarm too many people and open a Pandora's Box of headaches for all Intelligence agencies that are presently involved. Such a last resort must have prior approval if the present proceedings end in failure. This man has access to and holds materials from TOP SECRET files of numerous agencies, and the security breakdowns have made him dangerous and powerful. We have been unable to this time to trace effectively how the information was obtained. This is an agency process we hope to rectify in short matter. He is known to possess vitally sensitive materials and photographic evidence of: [1] Military maneuvers in the Atlantic Test Area and information classified TP SECRET ('O' missing in original photostat copy - LS Note). [2] Photographic evidence of deceased aliens held presently by certain TOP SECRET programs of the United States. [3] Damaging information re a TOP SECRET project and a particular scientest's (misspelled - LS Note) involvement in a thirty year old Government war time project, which, I must add, must be kept confidential at all costs. [4] Photographic evidence from numerous Intelligence files of landed and crashed U.F.O.'s, secret meetings and other highly sensitive materials that must not be in the public forum. [5] Knowledge of experimental projects presently TOP SECRET in nature and secured under J8 US 7933,794. It is essential that corrective measures be taken seriously to eliminate this threat posed by this information for at least a six month [6] period. This will allow establishment of security ground rules that can effectively deal with your defendant. The defendant must be labeled so that whatever he pronounces can be handled. He must be silenced in one way or another. This matter requires serious decision and should be handled at your level in order not to manifest an international incident that this Agency might find difficult or impossible to handle. All credibility of the defendant should be effectively eliminated. As a 'common' criminal offender and with a taste of what we are able to do, he may quickly understand where the final power of pronouncement sits.' COMMENT: At first glance, the allegedly secret memorandum tucked away in my file like a time bomb appears to have the 'official correctness' about it. But I was suspicious from the day I got it from my source, the defendant. Taking a long, hard look at the lurid charges on sensitive issues made against him caused me to wonder about the loose methods employed by the authority in this case. Questioned is the necessity for such an open directive which, if scandalously exposed, would not only compromise UFO secrecy by the integrity of the federal court system. It seems that the word-of-mouth method of communication in such highly sensitive matters would have been sufficient. Because of these doubts, mainly, I thought it would be unwise to use the memo either in support of my C/R research or in defense of the controversial photographs he sent me. In a sense, whether bona fide or bogus, the memo was a veritable 'barrel of eels' that would not serve in my interest. When Richard Hall visited my home in March 1982, I discussed the memo with him, asked that he check into a couple of its touchy items and to give to me his opinion. By letter dated May 29, 1982, Richard said he found the federal judge's name in Who's Who 1982, offered ideas for further investigation, and made the following comment: 'I am skeptical that the memo is authentic for several reasons. Obviously a hoaxster could come up with the name of a real federal judge. But the memo content is what bothers me most. To suggest to a Federal Judge that he 'punish ... discredit ... squelch' a defendant would be a severe insult, unless they had him in their pocket or he were dishonest, given the rules of our court system. Also, if they were trying to"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"persuade the judge that high-level classified information had been compromised, it seems unlikely to me that they would parade out a laundry list of that information in a memo that would stay in files. I could imagine them saying it was highly classified information with sweeping implications for the world, or even alluding to evidence of extra-terrestrial life, but I would think they would be much more guarded and indirect, only hinting at specifics.' Unlike many documents of questionable merit, others with secret classification which, for example, I have seen privately in the possession of researcher, William Moore, at the MUFON Symposium in Toronto, Canada, in July 1982. Another I had received in 1980 released by the Canadian government. Those stand out as bona fide. The Canadian document, a memorandum downgraded from Top Secret classification, which emphasizes U. S. official concern and was based on an evaluation report dated November 21, 1950, by Wilbert B. Smith, head of Canada's Project Magnet. Following is an excerpt from the report on the subject, 'Geo-Magnetics.' November 21, 1950, Evaluation Report about 'Geo-Magnetics' by Wilbert B. Smith, Canada's Project Magnet: 'We believe that we are on the track of something which may well prove to be the introduction to a new technology. The existence of a different technology is borne out by the investigations which are being carried on at the present time in relation to flying saucers. While in Washington attending the NARB Conference, two books were released. One was titled Behind the Flying Saucer by Frank Scully. The other was The Flying Saucers Are Real by Donald Keyhoe. Both books dealt mostly with the sightings of unidentified objects and both books claim that flying objects were of extra-terrestrial origin and might well be space ships from another planet. Scully claimed that the preliminary studies of one saucer which fell into the hands of the United States Government indicated that they operated on some hitherto unknown magnetic principles. It appeared to me that our own work in geo-magnetics might well be the linkage between our technology and the technology by which the saucers are designed and operated. If it is assumed that our geo-magnetic investigations are in the right direction, the theory of operation of the saucers becomes quite straightforward, with all observed features explained qualitatively. I made discreet inquiries through the Canadian Embassy staff in Washington who were able to obtain for me the following information: a. The matter is the most highly classified subject in the United States Government, rating higher even than the H-bomb. b. Flying saucers exist. c. Their modus operandi is unknown, but concentrated effort is being made by a small group headed by Doctor Vannevar Bush. d. The entire matter is considered by the United States authorities to be of tremendous significance.' While attending the Toronto MUFON Conference, I was also privileged to have lunch with Mrs. Wilbert Smith, wife of the late eminent researcher, and with Arthur Bray, author of The UFO Connection (Jupiter Publishing, Ottawa, 1979), who was familiar with Smith's work. Both Mrs. Smith and Bray assured me of the memorandum's official status. Of note, Bray shares the following in his July 3, 1980, letter to me: July 3, 1980, letter from Arthur Bray: 'I have read your Status Report II , and with particular reference to item B-12 (Frank Scully), I thought you would be interested in the following. The noted Canadian Ufologist, Wilbert B. Smith, conducted an interview with a top American scientist involved in the UFO business in the early days, who confirmed to Smith that the facts in Scully's book were 'substantially correct.' I have Smith's personal notes recording this interview on September 15, 1950. The interview was conducted through the Canadian Embassy in Washington. I reported this information on page 59 of my recent book, The UFO Connection. The name of the American scientist was Dr. Robert I. Sarbacher, who was Director of Research, National Science Laboratories, Inc.This greatly strengthens Scully's claims and certainly lends support to the 'contrived exposure' theory.' Also of note, Bray in his book relates that Wilbert Smith (Canadian engineer) was provided, for research purposes, a fragment allegedly obtained from an alien craft which had been shot off by USAF interceptors near Washington, D. C., in July 1952.\""},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":" Continued in Part 14 - Invisible Inside Informant Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
