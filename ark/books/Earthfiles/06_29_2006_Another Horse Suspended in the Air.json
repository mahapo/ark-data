Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Another Horse Suspended in the Air © 2006 by Linda Moulton Howe A lleged photograph of horse suspended in the air over a Texas location in June 2005. The photographer requests anonymity. See e-mail below. J une 29, 2006 Albuquerque, New Mexico - A week ago on June 22, 2006, I reported about an alleged horse suspended in the air beyond towers and antenna in front of an apartment building in Milan, Italy. See image below and 062206 Earthfiles. Three minutes of the horse in the air was videotaped and that videotape was given to Jaime Maussan, investigative reporter from Mexico City, while he was in Italy at a conference and met the Milanese fashion designer who videotaped the horse suspended in the air. Jaime called me about the tape because I have reported over the past two decades about eyewitnesses who have seen animals rise \"paralyzed\" in beams of light from pastures where the animals are later found dead and mutilated. The perpetrators of animal mutilations have been described by the late Lt. Col. Philip J. Corso, author of The Day After Roswell © 1997, as \"extraterrestrial biological entities,\" which use beam and laser technologies to interact with Earth life. Jaime sent me a copy of the videotape. He and I discussed in my earlier Earthfiles report whether the horse in the sky could be a balloon. The largest known commercial balloons shaped like horses are 43 inches (110 centimeters). The average size of a full-sized horse is 58 inches (145 centimeters). Some horses are larger than that and some smaller. The man who said he videotaped from his 6th floor apartment balcony in Milan described the \"flying horse\" as large and alive. But Jaime was aware that critics would claim it was a balloon hoax. So he has asked a balloon manufacturer to create a full-sized horse balloon to compare to a commercially available 43-inch-long balloon and plans to test the balloon hypothesis in Mexico City in July. Whatever is learned, I will report at Earthfiles.

After my report about the Milan \"flying horse\" caught on videotape, I received another image of a horse in the air beyond telephone wires. Below is the description from the e-mailer who has requested anonymity. I asked if he would talk with me by phone on, or off, the record about the Texas June 2005 event. I would like details about what he saw and heard before the photograph and what happened to the horse in the sky. So far, he has declined to do an interview. J une 23, 2006 E-mail: \"I took this in 'June of 05 in Texas. The picture is real..It hasn't been retouched or Photoshopped. ... I saw it myself. Did you notice the glow of light above it? The magnetic field distortion? \"I have been a bit reluctant to answer your email. I do not know what I thought when I sent you the picture. I thought that would be the end some how. I was naive I guess. You see I have a job to protect as well as legal hassles due to a government contract. I do not feel comfortable owning up to things. Still ..I feel I must do something and I am not just sure what. Me letting that picture out was a feeble attempt. I guess without an explanation and documentation it is worthless. So what to do? So...I have decided to tell you what I can. \"That picture was from a burst of four with my digital camera. It was the only camera image that turned out...You may of noticed even it was affected by a strong electromagnetic field. It is a camera that I was not supposed to have with me. I am a meteorologist who made a break through in the study of the relationship between solar radiation and reciprocal wind patterns. I cannot tell you any more than that. I and a team of others were hired based on my research to go in another direction than I had anticipated with my research data...but others had. Mine is just one piece of the puzzle. I can tell you four locations where we are assigned to test because of the presence of recurring electromagnetic anomalies. \"Hunt County, Texas area, Groom lake area, a small area off of the Florida Keys and the pan handle of Oklahoma. I cannot be specific as yet. I have noticed that our next test site falls into a known area of activity. ...In the future maybe the need for plain speaking will outweigh the current climate's concerns..But not now..not yet. I will be in touch. ( P.S. When I heard you speak of a floating horse on Coast to Coast I almost fell outta my chair! \") C ropped close-up of original e-mailed image by Linda Moulton Howe, Reporter and Editor, Earthfiles.com.
