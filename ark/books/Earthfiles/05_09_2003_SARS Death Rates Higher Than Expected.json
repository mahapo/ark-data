May 9, 2003 Geneva, Switzerland - The World Health Organization announced yesterday that the death rate is higher than originally calculated. After two intense months, as of May 8th, the SARS cases now total more than 7,000 with 506 deaths in 33 countries. The epidemic is still most severe in China where the rural provinces around Be ijing are reporting a rapid increase in SARS cases. The global average death rate is now broken down by age groups: 50% for patients 65 or older; 15% for people 45 to 64; 6% for patients 25 to 44; and below 1% for patients 24 or younger. For comparison, the death rate from influenza viruses is 2%. Further, a Lancet medical study based on data learned the past few months indicates that so far the SARS coronavirus samples collected from patients do not show mutation and are remarkably stable. This suggests something that Dr. Mark Jackwood at the University of Georgia said about coronaviruses being so species-specific that he doubted this new one had jumped from animal to human. See: Earthfiles 05-02-03. Dr. Jackwood said he thought it was more likely the new SARS coronavirus has been in the human population in a more benign form for a long time without being detected. Then it mutated to the more virulent SARS already adapted in the human system to infect and spread in the human population. The Lancet study says the stability of the SARS coronavirus so far means that a successful vaccine might be developed. But it also means the virus is not mutating to a more benign form and SARS might persist as the first new and dangerous disease of the 21st Century.

Avoid crowds. Wear surgical mask #95 if in close contact with people who have respiratory symptoms such as coughing or shortness of breath. Avoid sharing eating utensils, towels and bedding. Do not touch toilets and sinks that have been soiled by body fluids. When you return from an infected area, for 10 days SARS symptoms could emerge. SARS Symptoms: Fever above 101.4 degrees F. that \"feels like the thermostat in too high and I can't escape.\" Painful, achy body. Nausea, possibly diarrhea. Dry cough, shortness of breath, difficulty breathing.
