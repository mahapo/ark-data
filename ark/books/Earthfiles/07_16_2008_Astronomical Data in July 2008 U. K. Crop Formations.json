East Field has been the hub of this phenomenon for many years. The design has a wonderful lyrical quality to it. One can almost hear the music emanating from it. Just enjoy the magic that radiates from this delightful formation.” July 4, 2008 Honey Street Stanton Bridge near Alton Barnes, Wiltshire: H oney Street Stanton Bridge near Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, reported July 4, 2008. Aerial image © 2008 by John Montgomery. Comment by Stuart Dike, Cropcircleconnector.com: “ Hermetic Philosophy The three circles at Stanton Bridge, are extremely simplistic in form, and nothing we haven’t seen already since the dawn of crop circles. This triangular form of circles has appeared countless times; however, if we are to gain anything from interpreting the design, we need to delve deeper into why they have formed in this manner. An event of this kind would be totally ignored, being inevitably overshadowed by the more complex and spectacular formations we have come to expect from the phenomenon year after year. Although we must not spend any less time in trying to interpret what has occurred here, than decoding the more impressive designs due to form between the months of July and August."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"From my recent teachings involving Kabbalistic ideas, it has suddenly turned on a light that a number of these formations could actually be showing us ultimately the path of spiritual awareness, whether (the formations are) only a few feet across to hundreds of feet in length or diameter. Kabbalistic teaching suggests that the hidden processes were put into place when God uttered verbal commands and created a numerical sequence of consciousness or energy. This produced order in the cosmos by way of the 10 sefirot and the Tree of Life. This order is reproduced by a number, the Hebrew word, the English translation of the word and the modern meaning of each word. Without going into great depths of the Kabbalah ‘Tree of Life’ many readers will already know of its structure with Keter (Kether) at the very top of the tree, and Malkhut (Malkuth) at the base. This is basically where humanity dwells and is the seat of our perceptions through the senses. K abbalah Tree of Life. Source: Wikipedia. This small (triple circle) event at Stanton Bridge, I personally feel plays a huge part in understanding the true nature of the crop circles, and how we can break through into higher levels of consciousness. It is showing us the lower levels of the ‘Tree of Life’ and the path we all need to take, as this is the crucial step to enlightenment. If we take the lower circle (in image above by John Montgomery), this is called ‘Objective Consciousness.’ This is where we are here and now. It is also the place where we make the decision to act. Many teachings of Freud and Jung have told us that we must proceed directly from Objective Consciousness to Sub-Consciousness. This would be too hard for many people to undertake, and if we return to the Stanton Circles, we have no path to take. What this design could be showing us is an alternative path, which will allow us to truly understand ourselves before we are ready for the next journey. So from the base circle of ‘Objective Consciousness,’ we move to Desire (top right circle). This takes us straight to our power house and the source of our motivation. From Desire we go to Intellect (top left circle). This is the source of our beliefs. This is where we must examine our faith and our belief system. Next, we return to Objective Consciousness (base circle) so that we can act with desire and belief. From that point, we can then move to Sub-Consciousness and then to Cosmic Consciousness. If the Stanton Circles had these two elements attached to the design, it would have completed the bottom portion of the ‘Tree of Life’ However, how many times have we witnessed the classic dumbbell design with the two circles connected together! Is this (third circle and beyond to complete Tree of Life) the other part of our journey?”"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" Analysis by “ Red Collie” scientist from Australia: “Stanton St. Bernard three circle formation reported on July 4, 2008, is the Mayan number 3. M ayan number system of dots and lines prepared by Red Collie, Australian scientist, for his 2007 comments about crop formation reported August 12, 2007, at Stanton St. Bernard in Wiltshire County, England. A year earlier on August 12, 2007, the Mayan number 6 appeared at Stanton St. Bernard, Wiltshire, England. See Cropcircleconnector. S tanton St. Bernard, near Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, reported August 12, 2007. Aerial image © 2007 by John Montgomery. The August 12, 2007, crop formation had two meanings: (a) six days left until August 18, 2007, which was an inferior conjunction between Venus and our Sun, or (b) six Sun-Venus conjunctions left until Venus transit on June 6, 2012. The 2007 crop formation showed planetary locations of Jupiter, Saturn, Mars or Moon on several Sun-Venus conjunctions leading up to June 6, 2012. A crop picture from Secklendorf, Germany on June 23, 2008, used an ancient Mayan Sun-Venus calendar of 104 years to date when their Long Count calendar would end on December 21, 2012, see below in this Earthfiles report and originally HERE . Now, on July 4, 2008, the Mayan number 3 has appeared at Stanton Bridge. If field inspection determines that picture to be real, then it probably means: ‘three superior conjunctions left until our current Sun-Venus calendar ends on March 28, 2013.’ The astronomical data are listed below: 0. June 9, 2008 superior conjunction---passed (March 27, 2009 inferior conjunction) 1. January 11, 2010 superior conjunction (October 29, 2010 inferior conjunction) 2. August 16, 2011 superior conjunction (June 6, 2012 inferior conjunction---Venus transit) 3.

It counts 130 Sun-Venus conjunctions of 292 days each, and lasts for 104 years minus 26 days. The time required for three more superior conjunctions to pass therefore equals 3 x 584 = 1752 days or 4.8 years, which is approximately correct for July 4, 2008 to March 28, 2013 see HERE or HERE. ” July 6, 2008 Burderop near Wroughton, Wiltshire, reported July 6, 2008: C omment by Craig Neville: “It is about the same size as the Pi formation at Barbury Castle [ barley crop formation near Wroughton, Wiltshire, U. K., reported June 1, 2008, 300 feet in diameter. See Earthfiles. ] This new Wroughton, Wiltshire, crop circle is just up the road, but from first glance, not as technical.

Since the Mayans kept 20 days in any month, as opposed to 30 days for most Western calendars, then one implication of this new picture might be that the crop artists follow a Mayan calendar rather than a Western one (see HERE or HERE ).” July 9, 2008 East Field, near Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, reported July 9, 2008: E ast Field, near Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, reported July 9, 2008.

Analysis by “ Red Collie” scientist from Australia: “Avebury Manor of July 15, 2008 reminds us that the Mayan Long Count calendar will end on December 23, 2012: by showing precise orbital locations for all nine planets of our solar system on that date, plus an accurate elliptical orbit for Pluto. The 5125-year Mayan Long count calendar will end on D ecember 22-23, 2012. Given the long period of time which it represents, all nine planets of our solar system need to be shown in order to mark its end uniquely. Such a clever astronomical diagram was shown at Avebury Manor on July 15, 2008. All nine planets appear there precisely as they will be located in space four and one-half years from now on December 23, 2012, with one exception. Thus, the outermost planet Pluto has been drawn in this new crop picture somewhat further to the right (or closer to Neptune) than should be the case. Yet Pluto still seems to be located correctly relative to the crossover of its highly elliptical orbit with the orbit of Neptune. Three weeks ago at Secklendorf in Germany, two different dates from the year 2012 were indicated astronomically in a crop picture, one of which (December 21, 2012) was essentially the same as that shown HERE. ”"},{"pageNumber":10,"pageContent":"A vebury Manor “solar system,” near ancient stone circles of Avebury, Wiltshire, reported July 15, 2008.
