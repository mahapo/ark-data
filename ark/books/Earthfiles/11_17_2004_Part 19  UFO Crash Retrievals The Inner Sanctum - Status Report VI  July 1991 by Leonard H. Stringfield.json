Leonard Stringfield: I feel reluctance to chronicle all the convolutions of the South African case, which involves me personally, as it will serve no objective purpose. For me, as with others thrown together by circumstance to work as a small investigative cell, it was an expensive and time-consuming misadventure. But, in the long run, our efforts paid off by helping expose a hoax. The story began on an upbeat when Tony Dodd of England dropped his newsy bombshell at a UFO conference in October 1989 in Frankfort, Germany, sponsored by Michael Hesemann. But it was before the conference that I first got word of a crash from \"Henry\" Azadehdel, a frequent caller since 1988. In a voice that sounded more excited than ever before, he claimed that he was on the verge of getting a big UFO crash and retrieval story in South Africa. He went on to explain that he was in touch with a firsthand source who was involved in its retrieval and that he had called the Office of Special Investigations at Wright-Patterson AFB, supposedly involved in the retrieval, and getting some surprising responses. He promised more information to come and a copy of the taped call to Wright-Patterson. But that was it. Nothing more came by mail or phone for a long time. Attending the 1989 Munich Conference were several Americans, including Dr. John Kasher, a professor of physics at the University of Nebraska. On his return to the States, he sent a report to Walter Andrus, International Director of MUFON, who in turn, sent me a copy. I called Kasher and agreed to work with him which we did amiably, keeping in touch almost daily by phone until, alas, the curtains of the drama closed. In the meantime, fortuitously, I learned from another researcher that Tom Adams and associate, Christa Tilton, in Paris, Texas, had received a copy of Henry's preliminary report about the South African affair in October. Not receiving my copy as promised, I called Tom on November 30, and learned further that Christa had already been in communication by phone with James Van Greunen and wife, Janice, in Africa. Later that day when discussing Van Greunen with Christa, she said that he had called her, inquiring about her abduction experience and this gave her the opportunity to discuss his part in the crash and recovery operations. At that time, the case was still upbeat and Van Greunen, making his plea for financial help, sounded genuine. Because of my special interest in crash/retrieval matters and with the opportunity to learn more about captive humanoids, Christa agreed to entrust me with his phone number. She also agreed that I could share it with my colleague, Jack Kasher, and within two days, we all agreed to work together as a team. If indeed, Van Greunen had been exposed to alien humanoids - one, an aggressive livewire who injured an attending doctor, then by all means, I wanted to get his firsthand story. My first call to James Van Greunen in Hillbrow, South Africa, seemed reassuring. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"His manner of speaking was forthright with a good command of the English language. Like Christa, I thought he sounded genuine. I winced a little though when he described the two live alien entities taken captive from the craft. The physiological features were strikingly similar to those described by my two medical specialists which I had published in status report, The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome in 1980. (To be reprinted in subsequent Earthfiles.com of all Stringfield Sta tus Reports.) In summary, Van Greunen had ready answers for all questions. In fact, he promised even more information which he claimed was contained in more than 500 pages in his possession. This, he said, he would share with our team if he and his family could get out of Africa safely. He also stressed that he would soon face trial for treason for his breach of security and, he claimed, that he was under heavy surveillance. Nagging me immediately, I asked, 'How can you escape if you're under heavy surveillance?' His response, 'I have the right connections. There are others who want me to succeed, but my time is getting short.' Then, after a brief pause, he made his pitch: he needed money immediately to buy plane fare to Europe. His sobbing wife, Janice, and two children? Well, they must go, too, if more money can be provided. But in the main, he must get out soon or face trial. When I called the second time, Janice was home alone. Pleadingly, she made her case: hunger, fear and the urgent need for money. Needles to say, an air of urgency prevailed among our team members. Our phones were busy day and night, almost neglecting the holiday season, as each of us came up with news and views from sources in Europe, such as Michael Hesemann in Germany, or from the Van Greunens themselves. There were also some loose ends about the Van Greunen story, little inconsistencies that we each discovered as we compared notes. Also, there was the word of Henry, who had already announced to the world that Van Greunen was a fake. But when our hopes were at the lowest ebb, Van Greunen always managed to get his act together, blaming Henry for spreading malicious rumors about him. Once when I questioned his vow to deliver the documents, he said, 'In God's name, trust me.' Still concerned about the loose ends, Kasher called Van Greunen to get his story on tape. We agreed that it would not only be wise to get his firsthand testimony on record, but it would also serve as a test of his behavioral response and willingness to make sensitive disclosures knowing that his phone might be bugged. But again, when recounting his experience, there were no restraints. Instead, he threw all cautions to the wind, warning: the world must know the truth - the human race is in great danger and that we might all end up being hamburgers. \\Then on December 13, Van Greunen phoned Kasher and made it clear that unless he got the money for plane fare to Germany by December 15, the whole deal was off and threatened to destroy the documents. Walt Andrus was advised. MUFON came through. Kasher acted quickly, transacting payment for Van Greunen's flight to Germany. Janice and children would leave later and join her grandmother in England. The decision to help financially was made simply on the premise that the expenditure would either produce positive results or eventually expose a hoaxer. The gamble was worth it. In Munich, Germany, as pre-arranged, Van Greunen contacted Michael Hesemann. The fugitive and documents were now safe. Financially helped briefly by his new host, he assured no only him, but also each of us on the American team by phone, that his papers were stashed away in a bank safety deposit box. Christa even offered to fly to Germany to wrap the deal, but he said he needed time to get settled. Van Gruenen soon became hard to reach in a new lodging, not far from Munich. When I finally reached him, he talked of coming to the United States, thanked all of us who helped him to safety with a promise to repay his expensive plane fare ticket and said that his family was safe in England. I asked about the documents and he assured me that soon copies would be made for delivery. To simply matters, I suggested that he send me a sampling of five to ten pages, taken from the middle portion of the more-than-500-pages he had boasted having while in Africa. He agreed. Days went by and I called again, asking if his pages were on the way. He was delayed, he said, claiming that he had been ill with the flu. Kasher suggested sending it by FAX. No response. My next call: his excuse was that he was frightened by the German police who were informed by Henry that he was a spy. By this time, we all wondered about the intent of Van Greunen. Hesemann wondered, too, and was concerned when he learned that Van Greunen, dating a German girl of past acquaintance, was away on a fun trip to Italy. "},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"With this news, we all agreed that James Van Greunen was a con man and a hoaxer. Or, was the hoax actually a 'fix' to hide the real story of a crashed and retrieved UFO? Some of GV's tricks pulled on a few of his contacts were so obviously fraudulent, that it seemed highly irregular for a person, hoping to appear genuine, to go to such ludicrous extremes. One such victim was Bill Knell, who published a photo which falsely identified a mummified Mexican Indian child as an alien. He should have known that this kind of mischief would soon catch up wit him, which it did, leading to his shameful downfall. Of course, official disinformation will go to any extreme, if needed. If he was a stooge, we'll never get official admission or confirmation. But, personally, I think that James Van Greunen was a womanizing con man out for money. 4) THE GERMAN CONNECTION; SUMMARY BY MICHAEL HESEMANN My German friend, Hesemann, was committed to the South African affair from its earliest to its final stages. His view of Van Greunen is essential in this study of what was once a 'hot' case. His report, dated April 5, 1990, follows: Michael Hesemann: 'On October 26-29, 1989, UFOlogists from all over the world met in Frankfurt, Germany, at the International UFO Conference D. U. - Dialogue with the Universe , organized by me. One of the most amazing lectures, presented to an audience of 1800 people from 29 countries of all five continents, including Russia, was held by the British researcher and former police officer, Anthony Dodd. Dodd presented alleged original governmental documents and the results of his investigation on the alleged crash/retrieval of an alien spacecraft in the Kalahari Desert, Botswana, near the South African border, by the S. A. Air Force on May 7, 1989. After the conference, I kept in contact with Tony. Together with my friend and fellow researcher, Johannes Baron of Buttlar-Brandenfels, I visited Tony in England in January to discuss the case. On December 22nd, I got a phone call from a person who introduced himself as Captain James Van Greunen from the South African Air Force who wanted to talk with me about the Kalahari Incident. We made a date of December 23rd. I invited the Baron of Buttlar to participate at the meeting. On this date, Capt. Van Greunen told us that he just escaped court martial in South Africa and that MUFON paid his ticket (to fly to England). He gave us different telephone numbers of alleged witnesses of the case and some of them we reached. He told us that he is 26-years-old, a cryptologist and helicopter pilot. He said that for starting a new life in Germany, he needs money. He told us that he has 300 pages of U. S. and S. A. intelligence documents in a bank safe in Zurich, Switzerland. He said that he read about my conference in a S. A. newspaper and later gave me a clipping proving this - he got my phone number out of the telephone book after arriving at Munich airport. Supposedly in S. A., he was called by the intelligence and asked to come to a special office where he was shown a video taken by a member of the S. A. intelligence at the Frankfort UFO Conference showing Tony Dodd and me standing on stage - Tony holding the documents in his hands (the scenery is true). We arranged a new date, January 3rd, where he wanted to bring us to Zurich, giving us the original material. In the meantime, he called the Baron many times, asking for money. On December 28, 1989, I got a call on my answering machine by a 'Dr. Henry from England' saying, 'If you do not call me immediately, I will release tapes that could do great harm to James Van Greunen.' This sounded a little threatening before I found out that the person calling was Dr. Henry Azadehdel, Tony's co-researcher from England who, for some reason, tried to silence James Van Greunen. He also informed the German Embassy in London that JvG was a spy, who brought classified documents to Germany. They informed the BKA (Germany's FBI), the BKA informed the Lindau police who checked JvG on January 1st evening, but did not find anything. On January 2, 1990, James called me, that he was afraid to go to Zurich, believed that Germany would not let him enter the country again. Instead of this, he promised to come over and give us a 3-page document 'of highest importance, the central document of everything.'
