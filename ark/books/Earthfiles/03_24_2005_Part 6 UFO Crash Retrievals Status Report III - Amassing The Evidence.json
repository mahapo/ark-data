Previous Status Report IV begins at Earthfiles 021205 . Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. CASE A-11: 1965, Air Force Museum, Fairborn, Ohio: The Air Force Museum is in Fairborn, Ohio, near Dayton. Fairborn is also the location for Wright-Patterson AFB. RM has been in government service for 23 years, is married with family, resides near Cincinnati, Ohio. This extraordinary case is fact, according to the witness, RM, and if what he encountered is indeed fact, then we as appraisers can either accept it as possible, or probable, or reject it utterly as fantasy as we can do with all UFO events of high strangeness. RM, referred to me by a Cincinnatian who can vouch for his integrity, prefers anonymity because of his long service with a government office. The story goes back to about 1965, said RM, during a Sunday visit with his wife to the Air Force Museum in Fairborn, Ohio (suburb of Dayton). While his wife became engrossed in examining a German V-2 rocket on display, RM wandered off and found that he had gone down a corridor, got disoriented, went through a double-door marked 'Off Limits' and then suddenly came face to face with a being so incredible-looking that all he can remember in his numb state was saying, 'Hi,' to which he got no response. The being was dressed much like an astronaut in a silver suit with support pack. It was a diminutive figure, about 4.5 feet all which had a translucent dome over a large head. 'It wasn't human,' said RM. 'Its eyes were large under a heavy brow and there was no nose and only a slit of a mouth. The skin was bluish - or at least that's the way it looked through the dome.' RM said when the space-suited creature walked, its gait was different. It shuffled forward without bending its knees. At one point during the brief encounter, RM said the entity stopped, held out both arms mechanically toward him and pointed its long elongated fingers into his face. Then the alarm system sounded. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"While red lights flashed everywhere, RM somehow found the corridor and made a fast exit. As the loudspeakers announced an emergency evacuation, MPs were ushering people to the exits. RM said there was no panic and although the MPs were polite, there was a feeling of anxiety. The cause for the emergency evacuation he thought was without question about the creature who probably had escaped from its confinement. In 1970 or 1971, RM said because of his work, he met a retired Air Force Colonel to whom he related his experience. Having once served in a top secret capacity at Wright- Patterson, the Colonel replied to RM's surprise: 'If you know that much, I'll tell you the rest.' According to RM's informant, two live alien beings were in captivity. Scientists had developed a benign incubative atmosphere to sustain their life, at least for awhile. The Colonel also revealed that he was aware of a crash in 1969 of a 'two-man-sized' craft near Whitewater Lake in Indiana. The cause was electrical disturbance. No other details were revealed. RM said, 'The Colonel made it clear that he did not want his name or his disclosures made known as long as he lived. However, shortly after RM got the information about two captive aliens, his source died of cancer. RM called his friend 'Colonel Schmitz,' which at a later time RM admitted was a false name he used to protect the family of the Colonel. COMMENT: Live aliens! Loose in the Air Force Museum? Fantastic, of course, but the Wright-Patterson complex is vast and so are its underground facilities. It is conceivable, if truly live aliens exist, that one might have slipped by the guards into the passageways and surfaced in an upper chamber of the Museum. This story recalls another of seeming fantasy published in Situation Red, The UFO Siege , based on information related to me by Sherman Larsen of CUFOS. In that case, alien cadavers were purportedly stored in the Science and Industry Museum, Chicago, and were witnessed accidentally by a minister and son who went down a wrong corridor. CASE A-12: 1944, Kaneohe, Oahu, Hawaii E.L. of Los Angeles, married, has daughter, grandchild, is retired. Served as Carpenter Mate, 1st Class, Hqt. Co. 112th Construction Battalion, WWII. This case dating back to 1944, allegedly involves a landed or disabled alien craft discovered by a Seabee, E.L., near the beach of Kaneohe, Oahu, Hawaii. The year of the event is not only difficult to accept, but so is the story, mainly because of the fictionish anachronisms EL related during certain CE III phases of his experience. Lucius Farish, author of \"In Other Words\" in MUFON UFO Journal, referred me to the source. Lou agrees that while the story is fantastic, and probably beyond verification, it is nonetheless a case that just might have happened - or some of it - and should be recorded. EL, during three interviews by phone, related his experience cooperatively when assured of anonymity. He explained that only his offspring and one other researcher, Don Worley of APRO, had heard his story firsthand. He admitted that no one would ever believe his story and at 66 years of age, he seemed relieved when I told him I planned to publish part of his story for research records. EL's story begins with a stroll along the Kenoehe beaches on a Sunday morning to look for shells. Suddenly, his eye caught a glint of metal reflecting sunlight near a wooded ridge not far from a radar installation. Curious, EL went to look and was faced with a strange globular object about 50 feet in diameter. 'It looked like an igloo,' he said, 'except on the top was a clear glass dome about a foot high with a gold device, like a weather vane, spinning inside.' Outside were a group of people, EL said, all dressed in tight-fitting green uniforms. A closer look to his surprise revealed they were short, or 'scaled down' people, about 4.5 feet tall, of exceedingly slight build with no buttocks. Their faces were human-like with heads topped with short, lush black hair, large dark eyes, heavy eyebrows. One featured large, fanged teeth. This one, EL was told later, was a female. Each wore a heavy belt with a box-like apparatus attached in front. Two of the group of seven were sitting on the ship's ramp, four at regular intervals around it and one was out front, just 20 feet away from him. 'All were staring at me,' he said. 'The nearest one, probably the leader, acted like he was waiting for me. I still had no fear because I thought they were just small Navy people used in submarine duty.' Then the man nearest to EL spoke. It was in heavy accent, but the voice was too deep for his size. While the others remained silent, one of them suddenly reached down to the apparatus on his belt, pressed a button which instantly made EL dizzy and nauseous. Then"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"he lunged at EL with a sword-like weapon drawn from a scabbard. EL resisted, drew his knife and a battle for 'life or death' ensued. But EL managed to overcome his assailant forcing him to the ground. Then to EL's amazement, the others jumped into the fray and slew their own comrade. EL, who was dazed by it all, was told by the leader to return the next morning to talk by a large black rock near the water's edge. Said EL, 'They didn't know it, but I took the box from the dead man's belt.' Meeting at the black rock, EL was told of the wondrous world from whence the aliens came, 21 light years away. The leader also explained that this was the beginning of a period of world visits to check on the Earth they colonized eons ago. But EL's accord with the space people did not last long. A 'Navy swabbie,' who had witnessed EL's meeting with the strange men dressed in green, reported his activity to Naval Intelligence. According to EL, he was promptly summoned to Intelligence to explain his escapade to a Lt. Lewis. After lengthy interrogation by Naval Intelligence, OSS and the FBI, who had been called in, E. L. was forced to surrender the so-called Black Box and to designate the location of the alien craft. By some crafty maneuvers, they managed to capture the female entity who was heavily guarded until she was sent to the U. S. mainland. Then EL learned that Naval aircraft shot down the alien ship as it tried to take off and it fell into the ocean. It was towed, he said, using nets to San Diego. The remaining crew of six probably rotted inside because the Navy could not penetrate the craft's metal skin with conventional tools. According to EL, the Black Box was the subject of great interest to the OSS and Naval Intelligence. While in the office, its great power was luridly demonstrated on a pet cat. Pressing one of its three buttons, the cat faced the object's invisible wave and fell dead instantly, its bones liquefying into jelly. Even the desk upon which the box sat was seared through the varnish and into the wood which caused a foul odor. EL, of course, signed an oath of secrecy and was threatened by one of the plain-clothes agents who 'looked like President Johnson.' If he talked about the incident, he was told, he could be charged with murder of the ship's crew member. He had been framed, EL said. COMMENT: EL's complete story, which includes voluminous CEIII data, is beyond the scope of this paper. My notes cover several pages. Before my investigation, Don Worley of APRO in 1974 had made extensive efforts by mail to get the facts. But Don gave up when many of his questions went unanswered. The story is difficult to believe, especially the phase when EL does battle in medieval style with an alien. Such an anachronism, on the other hand, might have been staged using hypnotic techniques, for reasons that will remain inexplicable. THE INTERMEDIARY REPORT: CLASSIFIED 'B' In this section of 'B' material is support information from various sources, mainly intermediaries who in most instances have been advised by their first person source of a preference for anonymity. In most of these cases, I have been privileged to know the name of the informant. However, because of alleged deep fears a few will not allow biographical clues to go beyond their trusted go-between. Section 'B' also includes other general C/R information that I consider useful in helping the reader understand the scope of this research and its seeming sensitivities. CASE B-1: 1950s, Wright-Patterson AFB, Fairborn, Ohio YR is retired on medical pension, served in the U. S. Army, WWII, was chauffeur for General Patton; worked as millwright at General Electric. Resides near Cincinnati. YR, a government pensioned retiree, a patient who has long suffered from radiation exposure, and one of a few non-military, non-scientific people to see the bodies at Wright- Patterson. He was made known to me through his daughter who lives near Cincinnati. The daughter told me: 'Dad was working at Wright-Patterson in the early 1950s. He would not pin down the year. He was gone from home for more than a week to do some secret work at the Air Base. He would not discuss it with anybody, except Mom (now deceased), not even me. Then, after all these years, he saw you on WLW-TV talking about crashed UFOs and said, 'That man knows what he's talking about!' That was the wedge I needed, the chance to ask him what he did there.' In the course of the next several months, the daughter managed to ferret out bits and pieces of information. YR, employed by General Electric as a millwright, accepted the job assignment at Wright-Patterson knowing beforehand of its sensitivity. As far as his"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"daughter could ascertain, it involved the installation of a radiation device (a furnace?) which was used in some unexplained way in a secret section in or near the room which stored seven alien cadavers. According to her father, when he and his black assistant, Mr. W., reported to the Wright- Patterson office for their assignment, they were transported by limousine with dark curtains pulled shut across the windows. It reminded him of a hearse. Then, blindfolded and turned around several times for disorientation, he and 'W' were escorted to an underground level by elevator and then on to the work area. Once in the chamber or 'morgue,' which he described as 'icy cold' and exuding a strange offensive odor, he was given work instructions. Every move he made, he said, was watched by guards. Once when he peeked over to look at one of the corpses, each inside a glass case resting on a marble slab, a guard pulled a sheet over the top. On the side of each case were jalousies, usually shut. Occasionally, the glass would fog up. Asked about the bodies, his daughter said her father would not say much, probably conscious of his oath. But with time and patience, she learned that the humanoids were short, had large heads and looked 'clammy with the skin of a reptile.' the head had skin that reminded him of a frog. Yes, he said the hands had webs, but he didn't remember the number of fingers. To his daughter's dismay, she was told that as a security measure, his lodging there at the base was a cell-like room (he called it 'his jail') without communications to the outside world. Among other discomforts, 'was the dangdest odor he ever smelled.' It was so bad that he asked for a fan. They obliged, but the stench made his nostrils itch. On the plus side, he said, 'The food was good - steaks, everything. I even had a TV set.' YR said that his exposure to radiation on the job concerned the officials. He had to change his work clothes regularly and they took a radiation count not only when he left the premises, but he continues to report to medical authorities for check-ups. 'Dad took early retirement because of radiation sickness,' the daughter said. 'His health is poor despite surgery and continuous medical care.' Mr. W., his black helper, was also exposed, was retired early on a good pension and died of cancer several years ago. COMMENT: YR uses 'soda pop' phraseology which, like body chemistry, can be convincing. Examples: 'his jail,' and 'blindfolded and turned around several times.' At this time of writing, he will not become a first-person statistic for me, fearing loss of his pension. His daughter, whose word I trust, is still trying to get answers to 'our' many questions. CASE B-2: 1968, U. S. Army Intelligence School, Near Big Spring, Texas Bi g Spri ng, Texas northeast of Midl and, al l egedly 50 mil es from secret Army Intelligence training base and 16 acre Air Force 'facility' in 1968. Thomas Olsen of Phoenix, Arizona, veteran UFO researcher and nuclear engineer by profession, is credited in securing this unusual report for this paper from Larry W. This report, like so many others, suggests that the highest degree of secrecy hides some sensational or sinister truth. Following is Larry's letter to me, dated December 14, 1980, abbreviated without alteration of text. December 14, 1980, letter from Larry W.: 'I applaud your efforts to shed some light on the UFO riddle; perhaps my letter will be some assistance in this regard. Before I begin, let me emphasize that every detail of which I can be reasonably certain is included in this letter. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"The following narrative is based upon my best recollections of an eyewitness account told to me some five years ago. For the most part, these recollections are gleaned from several pages of 'dog-earred' notes and sketches made at that time. In 1975, I was majoring in engineering at Arizona State University in Tempe, Arizona. I was employed by the university as a classroom assistant tutoring students in an Engineering Graphics class. It was during one of these sessions that a sophomore student, Mr. DR, first told me about his personal observations of a UFO 'capture or retrieval.' He began telling me that in 1968, he was in the U. S. Army attending an 'Intelligence' school in a remote desert area of Texas. He told me that the nearest town, Big Spring, was approximately '50 or so miles away.' About one mile from the Army compound was a small 16 acre Air Force 'facility.' DR stressed that it could not be considered a 'full-fledged base.' Apparently, this whole area was restricted. Each installation was quite 'well-guarded and patrolled.' DR pointed out, however, that the Air Force 'facility' was particularly secure.\" Continued in Part 7 - Military Helicopters and UFO Crash Retrieval?
