October 25, 2003 Greensburg, Pennsylvania - In 2002, former President Bill Clinton's Chief of Staff, John Podesta, joined the Sci-Fi Channel in a request to the Bush administration to release all documents it has on the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania \"UFO crash\" of December 9, 1965. Sci-Fi Channel President, Bonnie Hammer, says, \"Now, one year later, despite serious effort to uncover the facts, NASA and the Department of Defense are still maintaining their wall of silence. Whether or not this has anything to do with UFOs - the public has the right to know.\" With her statement, the Sci-Fi Channel also threatened to file a lawsuit against NASA and other government agencies for documents about the Kecksburg event. Even though there were many Kecksburg eyewitnesses, for the past thirty-eight years NASA and the U. S. government have remained silent about what was retrieved. On Friday, October 24, 2003, NASA agreed to turn over documents relating to the alleged crash of a UFO in Kecksburg. According to the Sci-Fi Channel's website, \"NASA informed Lee Helfrich, attorney for the Sci-Fi Channel-sponsored Coalition for Freedom of Information (CFI), that it is releasing 36 pages of documents,\" the Channel said. The release comes after ten months of pursuing the records through the Freedom of Information Act. The Department of Defense and the U.S. Army have yet to release any records under similar requests, Sci-Fi said. “For more than four months we have received no response from NASA, but one day after John Podesta, President Clinton's former chief of staff and member of the Moynihan Commission, and Bonnie Hammer, president of Sci-Fi Channel, called on government "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"agencies to make public records that are over 25 years old, lo and behold, NASA responds,” Helfrich said in a statement. “I think it's fair to say that we have truly entered the realm of science fiction in Washington, D.C., when it's fair game to disclose the identity of a clandestine CIA agent, but not the records of an unexplained crash in Kecksburg, Pa., that occurred 38 years ago,” Podesta said at a news conference this week. Kecksburg Background: On Dec. 9, 1965, witnesses described seeing a fireball in the sky, a controlled landing and the systematic military recovery of an object by individuals wearing NASA badges. This week, I asked Pennsylvania UFO researcher, Stan Gordon, about eyewitness descriptions of NASA's presence at the 1965 Kecksburg crash site. Stan has persisted for many years trying to get facts about what happened beginning at 4:47 p.m. on Thursday afternoon, December 9, 1965, in the small town southeast of Pittsburgh. He has interviewed dozens of eyewitnesses, including people who saw NASA badges on the white overalls of men who showed up that night in Kecksburg and went to the crash site to retrieve the object. W itnesses claim to have seen a metallic acorn-shaped object with strange markings in the Kecksburg, Pennsylvania woods on December 9, 1965.

Interview: Stan Gordon, Electronics Technician, UFO Researcher and producer of the award- winning documentary, Kecksburg, The Untold Story, Greensburg, Pennsylvania : \"There are a number of people who mentioned to us that NASA personnel had been involved in the NASA incident. Ron Hayes, who was a young boy at the time, it was his family that was renting a small farm house very close to the vicinity of the impact site. I talked to several of the children who lived there at the time such as the mother and the father who has been deceased for many years. But Ron very clearly remembers the events of that night because what really stuck out in his mind was the excitement of seeing the military and all the military vehicles coming in and out of his home that night. He did mention that at one particular time as he was going down the stairs, he heard a conversation that NASA was going to be arriving soon and that it wasn't too long after that he heard a knock on the door and there was a man in a white coverall with a NASA insignia on it. A number of different people described to us seeing men in white coveralls, some with what appeared to be some type of protective gear which is very possibly associated with NASA. One of the persons in particular was Bill Weaver who was on this lane with a number of people in that evening who saw various types of activity. He was there when this large light colored box truck pulled up. Out of that box truck came four men in what he called 'moon suits.' They took a piece of equipment out that looked like a big box, possibly 4 x 5 foot square, and carried it down on a stretcher towards the ravine. But there was also another family who had been involved in events who told me back years ago that a NASA representative had come to visit them and interview them about the experiences at that time. They indicated that a man spent a few days in the area interviewing witnesses about the events of that time. So, that was just one reason why they (Sci-Fi Channel) went after the NASA information. They are looking at several other things with NASA. They were looking for any documents concerning Cosmos 1996, which was a Soviet Venus probe that we know re-entered the Earth's atmosphere about 3:18 a.m. that same morning (December 9, 1965), but in Canada. This (Kecksburg) happened about 4:47 p.m. in the afternoon. But there were a number of different things they were going after concerning NASA information and one of the things was something I showed you several years ago: a document I had obtained. Something was unique, I believe, in the information on it. It was what was called the NASA Fragology files (fragments of space debris from a variety of"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"sources) and it was an interesting document that turned up in I think 1994 when I had filed another FOIA request with NASA concerning NASA's involvement and the recovery of space material. I was looking in particular for any type of involvement for any event they would have been involved with in that time period, either in the United States or outside in other countries. Surprisingly, I got this document released by the NASA Historical Office. N ational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), Washington, D. C. 20544 document, classified \"Confidential\" and labeled \"NASA Fragology Files consisting of reports of space objects recovery, analysis of fragments to determine national ownership and vehicle origin. 1962-1967. Obtained by Stan Gordon in 1994 response to one of his Freedom of Information Act requests. F 36 Moon Dust - KATOTO Estate line item stands out on the Fragology Files list because MOONDUST is defined in the July 26, 1973, Department of State Airgram below as, “a designator used in cases involving the examination of non-US space objects or objects of unknown origin.” U . S. Department of State Airgram dated July 26, 1973, that includes paragraph below about \"MOONDUST.\" Source: U.F.O.s Are Real - Extraterrestrial Encounters Documented by the U. S. Government © 1997 by U. S. Army (Ret.) Sergeant Clifford E. Stone."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"E xample of MOONDUST classification on an August 18, 1962, U. S.

Sergeant Clifford E. Stone. Just to make the story short, I went back in to request all the different files that were reportedly contained in the document I had. Basically after a long period of time with no response, the indication initially was that the documents had been destroyed. Then, later it was clarified that they believed the records had been missing since 1987. As I recall in that document, there was a hand-written memo it still had, 'National Record Center 1994.' So that is something that also they have been looking deeper to find those other documents pertaining to the NASA Fragology files. IF SCI-FI ACTS LEGALLY AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO HAVE FIRSTHAND EXPERIENCE IF THEY SPEAK OUT, WOULDN'T THAT MAKE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT FOR THE U. S. GOVERNMENT TO WITHHOLD INFORMATION? I think this is the opportunity that in fact many of the eyewitnesses would be very hopeful for this. While only a small number of the witnesses that I've interviewed have gone public, there are multitude of eyewitnesses that I have interviewed, have statements and/or interviews on tape. Again, there is a lot of difference in the age factor. Some of these people are getting older. But a lot of the eyewitnesses we're dealing with are young children or teenagers at the time. Many of these people remember the events very clearly. Many of these people have grown up and like to be professionals. We have executives of companies, school teachers, police officers, a lot of people with a wide variety of professional backgrounds. And these people are looking for the opportunity to tell the story under oath to tell the people what they saw. In fact, there are quite a lot of witnesses I talked to that have good information on the case and while not having gone public at this point, have told me they are more than willing to swear under oath about what they experienced on that day on September 9, 1965.” Kecksburg Crashed Vehicle Taken to Wright-Patterson AFB? According to two truck drivers that Stan Gordon interviewed, the Kecksburg crashed aerial vehicle was transported to Wright-Patterson AFB in Ohio where the bell-shaped object and a lizard-skinned entity were contained within a solid brick building specifically constructed to contain the non-human physical evidence. Stan Gordon: \"The story is that this gentleman was a truck driver working for a large supply house in Ohio at the time. He said that within a few days after the incident in Pennsylvania, a Navy officer brought a special type of engineering brick into the supply house. They ordered a large supply of the special engineering brick to be delivered to Wright-Patterson AFB. Now, another truck driver has verified the story that he took in the first load of those bricks into the base the day before Myron got there where they BOTH unloaded a truck load of bricks. The other truck driver verified that when he got there the day before, there was a flatbed trailer. On that flatbed outside of this building, was a large tarpaulin-covered what he described as a \"liberty bell,\" a bell-shaped object which he verified now."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"M yron, a truck driver, delivered a load of bricks to Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, and states that he saw a strange bell-shaped object being examined in a building that was being entirely bricked over. Drawing by Charles Hanna © 1998 by Stan Gordon Productions. The next day is when both he and Myron went to the base. They were told to stay around the truck, not to go looking around, but to do their job. Myron was very curious because of the fact that he had these men in white covering with side arms and they were periodically changing their outer clothing. He was wondering what was going on inside the building. He had the opportunity when he thought the coast was clear to go and look inside that building. He saw up on scaffolding this bell-shaped object with ladders going up to it and these men apparently climbing up ladders working on this thing trying to open it up. He claimed he got little bits of information from them, up to the point where they finally realized he didn't have the clearance to be there. Basically, he said he was threatened, he was told that 'If you ever talk about what you saw, you'll be thrown in jail and you'll throw the keys.' But in 20 years, this would all be public knowledge. What is intriguing is the fact that while I was filming interviews when I did my video documentary: Kecksburg, The Untold Story and I went to interview him, you could tell he was in very bad health. He was on oxygen at the time. He told myself and the production crew - we were all very surprised that he revealed an aspect of the story he never told before. And we asked him, 'Why are you telling us now?' And he said, 'I talked to my son about it and he asked me the same question and I told him that the situation I'm in, I might not be here tomorrow or the next day, so I'm going to tell it all about what I saw.' What he said he saw was the fact that the room was not very well-lit. There was the bell-shaped object up on the scaffolding. He said there was a work bench also inside that same room and all he could see was a body laying on the work bench. As I recall, he said it was under 5 feet tall, he estimated, and was covered over with a light sheet. All he could see was the arm and three index fingers when we laid down from it. That's all he could see, but the skin looked kind of lizard-like to him. That was all he was able to see. SO, YOU'VE GOT TWO PEOPLE NOW MYRON AND THIS OTHER INDIVIDUAL AND THEY ARE BOTH BASICALLY TELLING THE SAME STORY? Except the first individual only saw the object OUTSIDE of the building on the flatbed trailer the day before he and Myron went to the base. At that point, the object had been taken inside the other warehouse off the base. What Myron said they were doing they got the exact color and type of brick that matched that building. His understanding was that they were going to build some type of protective shield and they were going to entomb the object. They were building the bricks up inside the building to completely cover the object inside the other building, so you wouldn't be able to see it.” T o be continued in Part 2.
