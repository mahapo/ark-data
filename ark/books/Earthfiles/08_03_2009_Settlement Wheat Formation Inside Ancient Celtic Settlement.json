August 3, 2009 Yatesbury, Wiltshire, England - Yesterday, August 2, 2009, a new wheat formation was reported at Morgan's Hill near Bishop Cannings, Wiltshire. This is the second pattern in 2009 around Morgan's Hill. The first was the “lunar cycle calculator” of April 24, 2009, in flowering oilseed rape that indicated a date of July 7, 2009, for an astronomical event that the Australian scientist and physicist Mike Reed of North Carolina reported might relate to a solar event, probably a flare. The largest sunspot in more than a year of our abnormally quiet, spotless sun occurred between July 5 and 7, 2009. So, that April 24th Morgan's Hill crop formation was forecasting a future astronomical event. “Lunar cycle calculator” reported April 24, 2009, in flowering oilseed rape at Morgan's Hill, Wiltshire, England, the first 2009 pattern near the ancient settlement hill.

The new formation on the other side of Morgan's Hill from the spring pattern appears in aerial images to be so rigidly precise inside the very rectangular, ancient Morgan's Hill Settlement. But on the ground in the afternoon of August 2, 2009, I was surprised by how messy-looking the new pattern is in contrast, for example, to Ogbourne St. George of July 24, 2009. [ See 073009Earthfiles ] The fact that the pattern looks so rigidly detailed from the air and so messy on the ground is a contradictory phenomenon we've seen before, even in classic early 1990s patterns I have explored. Sometimes the “messiness” seems "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"related to creating the impression of 3-dimensional structure in aerial views. R ectangular wheat pattern reported August 2, 2009, at Morgan's Hill near Bishop Cannings. Aerial image © 2009 by Julian Gibsone. Other information and images: Cropcircleconnector.com. Yet on the ground, the first impression was chaos. Then you realize that the first chaotic plants circling the inner patterns are like a sea of choppy water. When I studied the perimeter of that choppy sea of wheat, I found lots of stems flat on the ground without any break or crease at ground level. Further, around the central, intricate pattern, is a border made of wheat in 4-foot-wide sections laid down at 90-degree angles that repeat to create the “ribbon” weaving around the central pattern. The Australian scientist counted 20 cross-hatches on each side of the Morgan's Hill rectangular pattern and wonders if that relates to the Mayan 20-day-count calendar? If so, could this August 2, 2009, Morgan's Hill formation be pointing to an upcoming date 80 days from the formation's appearance? That might coincide with the appearance of a comet in October 2009?

Pole image © 2009 by Charles Mallett. History Background for Morgan's Hill Area When the Romans invaded Wiltshire in 43 A.D., there were Celtic people living in small kingdoms, frequently at war with each other in iron age communities. Iron age h illtop forts had been constructed and were used for defense against the invading Saxons. Examples are Barbury Castle north of Marlborough and Liddington Castle near Swindon. Wiltshire was the scene of important battles between the Celts and Saxons, and again later between the Saxons and Danes, culminating in a final victory at Edington, Wiltshire, in 878 AD. The Celts built settlements bounded by protective ditches such as those still clearly visible at the Morgan's Hill settlement near Bishop Cannings and Devizes.
