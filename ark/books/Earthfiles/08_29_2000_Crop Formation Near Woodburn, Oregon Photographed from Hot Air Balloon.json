Photograph © 2000 by Linda Ross. August 29, 2000 Woodburn, Oregon - Yesterday I received the photograph above in an e-mail from Helen Bibelheimer of Keizer, Oregon. She wrote: \"My friend, Linda Ross, took the picture from a hot air balloon early August 13, 2000 near Woodburn, Oregon. I have an original and she has the negative. She wasn't looking for it (crop formation), just taking a ride! Linda is not that interested in crop circles. \"No news about it in the newspaper, nothing about it anywhere. The gal who owned the hot air balloon hadn't seen it before, either, and thought it was a place where tractors turned around. When Linda showed it to me, I immediately e-mailed it to you.\" More Information: Nancy Talbott, Coordinator for the BLT Research Group in Cambridge, Massachusetts, says this is the Whiskey Hill Road formation between Woodburn and Hubbard, Oregon, first noticed on August 5th by pilot Michael Salisbury of Portland. A field report was made by Carol Pedersen on August 7, 2000 in "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"which she described the large formation as having a 481 foot diameter in very mature and dry wheat. August 7, 2000: \"Three 62-foot circles (not touching each other) arranged in a triangle shape surrounded by a three-scallop edged pathway about four foot wide. The edge of each circle intersected at a scalloped edge indentation inward. The lay was all counter- clockwise in the outer path and in each circle. There were no pathways to or from the formation\" at the time she did the field survey at Longitude 122 W 48 Latitude: 45 N 10.\" Carol said, \"The field is located in the highly populated farm country of the Willamette Valley along a well traveled road, but the field itself is in somewhat of a depression so the formation could not be seen from the road.\" The farmer was not aware the formation was in his field , it was never reported to the media and no one ever claimed to have made it. This 2000 formation was in the same field crossed by electrical power lines where a previous and major formation appeared in 1998. Carol Pedersen became sick and dizzy while working inside the formation, possibly affected by residual energies or magnetic field anomalies produced by whatever made the crop glyph.
