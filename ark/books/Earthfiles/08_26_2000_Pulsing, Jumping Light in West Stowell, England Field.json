Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Pulsing, Jumping Light in West Stowell, England Field © 2000 by Linda Moulton Howe August 26, 2000 East Field, Wiltshire, England - On Monday, July 31st late in the evening, crop circle researchers Ed and Kris Sherwood were in an East Kennett crop formation when a bright yellow unidentified aerial object appeared followed immediately by a loud, military-type helicopter that nearly ran them down in the field. After the couple went to the ground to escape the low-flying helicopter, it pursued the bright yellow object again, both disappearing behind a hill. Then a second bright yellow aerial object appeared. The Sherwoods videotaped the helicopter and yellow object and learned that other people did, too. Frank Laumen, a researcher and photographer from Germany, was at the bridge in Allington and could see lights and a helicopter back toward East Kennett. He videotaped the interactions. Andy Buckley from Manchester, England was also on Martinsell Hill and videotaped helicopter and light activity about the same time. Three days later on Thursday, August 3 in Alton Barnes, Wiltshire, from morning into the afternoon four different helicopters with a yellow top, yellow belly and numbers painted on the side such as 43, 44, 45 and 54 kept traveling between the East Field, West Stowell/Oare, Pickled Hill and Woodborough Hill. Where there were crop formations, the helicopters lowered several times as if looking for something.

But with all the persistent helicopter activity on the peculiar circling route around the four locations at the heart of the Wiltshire crop circle phenomenon, several of us decided that night we would stay up for a night watch from a parking area along the East Field that had clear viewing of Knap Hill, Golden Ball Hill, Pickled Hill, Woodborough Hill and the lush ripe wheat fields in West Stowell. When seven of us gathered at the East Field site around 11 PM on August 3, the night sky straight above us was perfectly clear as if all the rain had washed the sky clean. There was no moon. Others out to look were Carl Nevin, Geoff Stray, his friend, Tanya, Bob and Gil Nicholas and Gordan Stewart - all seasoned by dozens of night watches looking for the unusual amid the normal ebb and flow of airplane and satellite traffic. As the night wore on, misty fog settled along the hills. Eyes alone could not see through the fog. But I had with me a sophisticated Night Vision scope loaned by a friend for my trip to England, an ITT Night Vision F6015 with infrared capability that \"sees\" heat. Its lens magnification was 3x. When I looked down the fields with that scope, tramlines were clearly straight and dark in the gray-green lens typical of light gathering scopes because the Night Vision scope was using heat as well as starlight to delineate features in the landscape around us. In the first couple of hours, the biggest light show was above our heads as bright meteors flashed at the rate of about ten an hour. One was a large bollide that started in the zenith seeming to come straight down toward Knap Hill beyond the East Field and broke up into pieces as it neared the earth. Then around 1 AM, three of us all said at the same time, \"Look! Did you see that red flash?\" The color was a pure red in the very black fog. I immediately looked through the Night Vision scope where the red flash had been. To my shock, there now was a bright oval seeming to rest right above the crop pulsing a beat each second. I passed the scope to the others and each confirmed he or she could see the bright oval pulsing. When the scope was passed back to me, I was eager to look again at the strange object and was further shocked when it jumped from the middle of the frame to the far right, then to the far left, then back to center and kept repeating the odd jumps. Again, I passed the scope to the others who all confirmed with their own astonishment that they could see the object jumping in the Night Vision scope even if none of us could see anything in the dark mist."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Graphic depiction of pulsing, jumping oval object as seen in shades of grey-green in the Night Vision scope beginning around 1 AM on August 4, 2000.

Then, feeling light hearted, I said out loud addressing the jumping object in the lens, \"Why don't you come closer so we can see what you are more clearly? We're not afraid. Please come closer.\" Immediately the oval flared up extremely brightly in the lens, turned into a square of flickering brightness that reminded me of sunlight reflecting off a mirror, and began to pulse faster and faster. Around the flickering square were two rings in the infrared frequency that seemed to pulse around the square. Simultaneously, my friends all yelled that they could see red light flare up again in the mist. One of them said, \"Linda, keep talking to it!\" So I did. I kept asking the strange flickering brightness to come closer so we could see it better. Each time I and the others called out for the object to come closer, it brightened and intensified its pulsing in the scope. The others could see pulsing red in the shape of a square.

I called out, \"No, please don't go.\" And the object immediately flared back up again. That fading out, asking not to go, flaring back up and then dimming again continued for another several minutes. Then the object began to jump as it had in the beginning and finally disappeared altogether."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"More Information: In July 1996, Bert Janssen and Janet Ossebaard from The Netherlands were sitting in a car at the foot of Golden Ball Hill very near the West Stowell field in which the August 3, 2000 object appeared. It was about 1:30 AM when they saw an orange light at the edge of Tawsmead Copse across the road from the East Field. Bert looked at the orange light through binoculars and described the light as \"not a real steady light. It looked much more like a fire. The light was alive like a fire is alive. Like a heartbeat ... (but) a steady, irregular pulse. It was not regular, but more like an open fire you look at the flames.\" We b s it e s : http://www.cropcircleconnector.com/ Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
