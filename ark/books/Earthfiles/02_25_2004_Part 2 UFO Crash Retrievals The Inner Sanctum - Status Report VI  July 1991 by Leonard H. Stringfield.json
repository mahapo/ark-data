Len Stringfield - continued: Cloak and Dagger Drama at MUFON Conference, Dayton, Ohio, July 29, 1978 After a brief interlude with TV newsmen for a prearranged interview and still under heavy guard, I was taken to my room. Before I could order a sandwich, I was told that I was being transferred to another room. Out went my luggage and in came a lady's wardrobe on a pushcart. Fast work, indeed. Before one of the plainclothesmen departed, he advised, \"Stay in your room until notified.\" Minutes later, I was visited by my friend with the CIA connection. Concerned by the threats, he phoned his contact and was reminded that he had been advised there would be trouble. No further explanation. About 15 minutes later, another visitor with official credentials joined by a known friend in research, requested a copy of my paper and the tape of the UFO crash witness. Still later, I learned that one of my medical informants, associated with the doctor who had performed an autopsy on an alien body, came to my vacated room and left a note under the door which was never delivered. After more than two hours, hungry, and flustered by my isolation, I left my room to join my friends. Speculation about the events of that day, July 29, 1978, (at the MUFON conference) was at a high-pitch - without answers. Later in the evening, I happenchanced to meet J. Allen Hynek in the men's room. I remember my comment: \"Well, I did it for better or for worse; what's next?\" He replied cryptically, \"It's like the inexorable flush of a toilet; you're now committed.\" Several days after the Dayton experience, I learned fro the CIA person in the usual indirect manner, \"If Stringfield had said certain things about crash and retrievals, Hynek would have taken over.\" I tried to find out more, but without success. Many questions to this day remain unanswered about the events of that day I formally introduced UFO crash/retrievals to research. Mainly, who was the culprit who made the threats? Was he a loner with a mental problem? Or a \"plant\" from the Inner Sanctum's special goon squad? But what of the advanced warning by the CIA person who predicted \"trouble?\" Were \"they\" fearful that I would make some sensitive disclosures? But if that were the case, why had they not taken stronger measures to prevent me from "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"presenting my paper before I went to Dayton? Or why had they not told me about the threats on my life before I went on stage, hoping that such a tactic might scare me into a senseless silence? And who was the lady that was willing to change her room to mine at Stouffers? Was she informed of the reason for the change? And if she did know, did she have any qualms about the danger of being bombed? And what did she do with the note addressed to me that was put under the door? She certainly knew her old room number which was room #1210. Very strange unless she, too, was a part of an orchestration. To speculate further, were the threats and subsequent Dayton police action and the assignment of a personal bodyguard to watch my every move day and night until my departure, a window-dressing stunt perpetrated for a longer range purpose on orders from the orchestraters - or shall we say, the Inner Sanctum? Was it all a means of intimidation to scare me out of crash/retrieval research? Of note, there were more threats to follow me at my home in Cincinnati. Twice I got phone calls from a low monotone voice warning me that I would die if I continued my research. Also, I had received two postal cards from an anonymous source in New York with drawings of a human skull and crossed bones - in red ink yet. The messages were brief: Get out of the UFO business! And now, for a little speculation on the lighter side - away from the cloak and dagger kind of mischief. After the disturbance, I recall that rumors were rife that the threats could have been a caper pulled of which got out of hand by one or more buffoons within the local sponsoring group, the Ohio UFO investigative League (OUFOIL). Several researchers who were present point out that they believed part of the plan to stir up controversy might have been demonstrated by one of the OUFOIL's members who paraded around the auditorium dressed like a little green man. In summary, the case is closed. It is now history. But apart from all of its spooky aspects, I'll always wonder why Hynek got to Dayton ahead of schedule and will also wonder about the remark made by the CIA contact that Hynek was there to respond to any of my 'hot stuff' disclosures. Apparently, I didn't have the hot stuff. Through the course of time, I had several occasions to meet privately with Hynek - once at his home and once at mine. Whenever he came to Cincinnati on business or to visit a \"favorite\" aunt in my city. Our main subject: crash/retrievals. He wanted names and details. I gave details but no names, insisting that I could not compromise the identity of my sources who, for their own security, preferred anonymity. At restaurants, he would often acquiesce with an understanding nod and then stare down at his plate in long silence. Perhaps he gave thought to his own position relating to sensitive matters. I recall several times that I asked about a UFO military case and got no reply. Whatever was behind Hynek's zeal to get crash/retrieval information, he always maintained in my company the aplomb of a diplomat. His warmth and wit were indeed winsome. Astronomer J. Allen Hynek and Project Sphinx In June 1980, I released The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome, Status Report II which was a continuum of witness reports from new sources, including a letter I had received under special conditions from a medical informant who described the alien anatomy. Published by MUFON, to whom I had relinquished its financial proceeds, it got good reviews in friendly quarters and according to MUFON Director, Walt Andrus, got brisk sales. When Hynek received a copy of the galley proofs, he called to extend his compliments for a \"job well done;\" but again, he lamented the fact that my credibility was suffering by not releasing names of my sources. And once again, I"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"felt cornered. My voice probably echoed my reluctance to even discuss the issue. But he tried to ease my discomfort. In his diplomatic manner, he wondered if there might be a \"discretionary\" way that could be handled to the satisfaction of the sources and myself. He hinted at some possibilities and promised to be in touch soon. A few weeks later, he called again. This time he offered his concept of a discretionary plan that would basically provide credence to my anonymous witnesses, especially when I faced the media or was interviewed on radio or TV talk shows. According to the plan which I dubbed Project Sphinx, Hynek would be privileged to know the names of my C/R sources and their full disclosures. The key to its success, he stated, would rest on the integrity of a third party who would be included in the \"know all, see all\" plan. To my surprise, he named one of the most renowned of astronauts and, lo and behold, according to plan, I could refer to his name during interviews as having knowledge of any and all of my anonymous sources. According to Hynek, the astronaut had already reviewed the galley proofs of my new status report and would reply in due course. The full disclosure papers, said Hynek, would be stored in a vault of a Cincinnati bank with access limited only to the three persons named. Alas, credibility! Needless to say, I was honored. And needless to say, I felt a choking sensation wondering what the reaction would be to the offer from some of my more sensitive and trusting sources. I had already a sample of a negative response when I requested an affidavit from an Air Force officer who had witnesses firsthand three alien bodies at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1953. When I asked for a posthumous statement, his response was that he would have to check with his security officer. The terse answer: \"You have seen nothing, heard nothing, and you sure as shit can sign nothing.\" Even in a more sensitive position were the medical specialists: one was a hematologist who had performed an autopsy on an alien body in the early 1950s. The other, his colleague, was a biochemist who had studied specimens under glass. It took almost a year of \"negotiations\" with them before I could obtain a \"cleared\" statement on the alien anatomy for publication in my The UFO Crash/Retrieval Syndrome and, knowing little or nothing about the depth of their secret work, how could I present a case for them to compromise their positions? To this day, I am not in the clear to disclose the name of the hospital in which they worked or even the name of the city in which it is located. To breach this trust could jeopardize the safety of myself, the two doctors and others who have counted on my allegiance. I expected some restless days awaiting word from Hynek to get the astronaut's answer and to ponder my response. Project Sphinx failed. It never got off the ground. Hynek called and related reluctantly that the astronaut had new and demanding obligations in another state and did not wish to get involved in the proposed program. Hynek also mentioned that the astronaut had some reservations about some of the cases in the status report, which I could understand as I, too, was aware of some questionable items. Unfortunately, I'll never know any of the specific cases or details that he held in \"reservation\" or those which he believed to be acceptable. I do know that Hynek and the astronaut were friends and got together on fishing trips. I also know from other sources that the astronaut did get involved in a business venture and changed his place of residence. Pilot Carl Madeley's UFO Information Going back to Project Blue Book days when Hynek provided conventional answers to explain away UFO sightings, I cite evidence that he was involved in the investigation of UFO incidents of greater significance than a hovering light that suddenly shot away at fantastic speed. One case in point is a taped interview by John Lear in 1987 with pilot Carl Madeley who described his close encounter with a bright red ovoid object about 50 feet in diameter while flying"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"enroute from Houston to Las Vegas in 1967. When I called Madeley for confirmation and details, he said the object that paced his Lear jet over Arizona was confirmed by radar at the Albuquerque and the Los Angeles Air Traffic Centers. Each advised that they were monitoring his flight and the UFOs. He later learned that the captain of a National Airlines DC-8 had also witnessed the object. Madeley said that the object turned green during its acceleration toward the Pacific Ocean where it disappeared. According to Madeley, a scientist friend reported the incident to Dr. Hynek who flew to his home in Texas for a debriefing. Of note, Hynek included Madeley's encounter in his book, The UFO Experience (see pages 82 and 83). Did A UFO Cause the Aurora 7 Panic When Astronaut Scott Carpenter Wa s \"Lost\" on May 24, 1962? During the interrogation, Madeley said that Hynek told him that on one of the Gemini two-man space missions, the craft was paced by a UFO for one entire orbit forcing the astronauts to abort their flight near the Grand Turk Island in the Caribbean. (Note from Linda Howe - See More Information below: Did the UFO Pace Aurora 7 Flown by Astronaut Scott Carpenter on May 24, 1962?) Debriefed by astronomer J. Allen Hynek who was flown by the USAF to the rescue aircraft carrier, one astronaut was in a near state of panic. This misadventure, of course, was never revealed publicly. According to Hynek, said Madeley, there was fear that the public would panic if all the facts about UFOs were made known. He also told Madeley that although he could not prove it, the belief in official circles was that the UFO came from outer space and he named several star systems as likely candidates of origin. \"They're way ahead of us in technology,\" said Madeley, quoting Hynek, who compared them (non-humans) to us when we view the monkeys at the zoo. In retrospect, Dr. Hynek throughout our relationship - since he instituted the Center for UFO Studies (now The J. Allen Hynek Center for UFO Studies, CUFOS), has posed a few puzzlements for me. However, despite rumors of his implication in undercover work for the U. S. Air Force, or the CIA, I personally have no evidence to suggest that he was, or that he interfered with my C/R work. In fact, on one occasion when I made the remark that my work in the C/R sector was not really research in its purest, clinical sense compared to the urgent study of abductions, he replied, \"Indeed, your research is very important.\" On the other hand, while attending a CUFOS conference in Chicago, he did remind me that the notoriety given to my claim of alien bodies stored at Wright-Patterson AFB haunted him wherever he made a public appearance. At the same conference, one of his close associates took me aside privately to relate that I \"take under advisement\" the serious distractions my work had caused to the operations of CUFOS. He particularly cited a set of photos showing alleged alien bodies inside a glass case that I had announced having in my possession at the MUFON Symposium I attended in 1980 in Houston, Texas. Looking only briefly at a set which I brought with me, he concluded they were fakes. I agreed that they probably were, but in my opinion they deserved further analysis. I further explained that I was investigating not only the genuineness of the photos, but other material I had received from the same sources. It was not long after our meeting that I concluded that the tainted photos were a \"part and parcel\" of a well-orchestrated disinformation ploy. If they were given to me to \"muddy the waters\" of research or to discredit me, they were certainly successful - at least for a brief period. More on this photo business later in this status report. "},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"On still another occasion, Hynek made the point - and I think my quotation is reasonably accurate: \"You, Len, can say whatever you wish about crashed alien UFOs publicly, but I can't. I'm a scientist. I'd be an instant outcast in my profession if I came out in the open in your support.\" My last interchange with Hynek was February 8, 1984, when he and I were guests on the Allen Hendelman radio talk show out of Raleigh, North Carolina. When Hynek was asked for a comment on my C/R work, he said, \"Len is a careful, assiduous and extremely honest man. There are many straws in the wind to back him up, but I do wish he weren't such an honorable person so that he would release names to make his stories credible.\" To me, Dr. Hynek was a kind, perspicacious, witty, well-spoken and adroit scientist. The people who pulled the strings in the Inner Sanctum knew those virtues (in him), too. In his passing in 1986, Hynek's last words reputedly on the subject to which he was so dedicated officially and at CUFOS were an expression of disappointment. He felt that he had been \"used\" without ever being told the truth behind the cover-up. There is a commonality in the feeling of being \"used\" in this business. More Information: \" ... O n one of the Gemini two-man space missions, the craft was paced by a UFO for one entire orbit forcing the astronauts to abort their flight near the Grand Turk Island in the Caribbean. Debriefed by astronomer J. Allen Hynek who was flown by the USAF to the rescue aircraft carrier, one astronaut was in a near state of panic. This misadventure, of course, was never revealed publicly.\" Is This UFO Incident the Truth Behind the Aurora 7 Panic When Astronaut Scott Carpen ter Was \"Lost\" on May 24, 1962? Astronaut Scott Malcolm Carpenter, the second American to go into orbital flight around the Earth, following John Glenn, on May 24, 1962. There was a problem and he ended up landing near Turks Island far from the intended return site. Photo courtesy NASA. Historical Background by the Turks and Caicos National Museum: \"In 2002, the Turks and Caicos Islands had more to celebrate than their position as one of the top 5 diving sites in the World, more to celebrate than the year-round great climate and sandy beaches. They celebrated the arrival of a visitor who literally came from Outer Space. Without the Missile Tracking Station on the 6 12 by 1 mile island of Grand Turk, NASA may never have known that John Glenn was still alive after being the first American to orbit the Earth in 1962. It was from here that the heart rates and positions of the astronauts John Glenn in Friendship 7 and Scott Carpenter in Aurora 7 later that year were monitored. It is an excellent example of how seemingly small places can play big roles in history. A history that still captures imagination all over the world."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"To celebrate the 40th anniversary of this momentous occasion - one of the biggest moments of history - the Turks and Caicos Islanders planned a series of events. Many people still remember the day when everyone waited 'splashdown'. John Glenn liked where he had landed though, just off the coast of the island that forms the capital of this 40-island country at the southeastern end of the Bahamian archipelago. John Glenn's Friendship 7 Space Flight February 20, 1962 During John Glenn's mission the recovery area was nicknamed \"Area Hotel\" and during his second orbit Glenn reported \" This is Friendship 7, checking down in Area Hotel on the weather, and it looks good down that way. Looks like we'll have no problem on recovery\" to which Grissom in Bermuda responded \" Ve r y good. We'll see you in Grand Turk\" . After landing and being brought to Grand Turk there were various press releases and in one Robert Voas, Mercury Training Officer, recalled Glenn's account of returning in \" a shooting star\" . Glenn, traveling admittedly by rather non-traditional means, was pleased with what he saw during the mission saying \" I don't know what you can say about a day when you see four beautiful sunsets, three in orbit and one on the surface\" . It is true that the sunsets over the islands, especially the green flash that visitors and locals claim to have seen just before the sun descends below the turquoise horizon are truly spectacular. Thanks to technology and good business sense, tourists can see sunsets here without the need of a space rocket of any kind as several major airlines have been quick to invest in this fast-growing popular and un-spoilt destination. U. S. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson Arrives John Glenn stayed in Grand Turk for only three days but even he got a taste of the warm welcome that visitors still enjoy today. When the US Vice President arrived at 4 a.m. to take John Glenn home, a large part of the population was waiting for him at the airport and greeted him with great enthusiasm in spite of the early hour. The records state \" Of all the receptions which the Vice-President and the astronaut were later to receive, perhaps none would be smaller but certainly none would be warmer or more sincere that that given by the people of Grand Turk on their departure in the early morning of 23 February.\" Scott Carpenter's Aurora 7 Space Flight on May 24, 1962 - What Really Happened? \" This trip proved more controversial because Carpenter had seemed to lose concentration as he re-entered the Earth's atmosphere. ... On descending, his capsule, Aurora 7, overshot the pickup area by 250 nautical miles (463 km) causing nationwide concern for his safety. ...While the wo rld's media began endless debates about his health and state of mind, Scott, alive and well, came to Grand Turk for full medical checks.\" Grand Turk would not be content with only one moment of fame. Months later Scott Carpenter missed his assigned landing spot by 250 miles and ended up right back in Grand Turk, where John Glenn it would seem was only too pleased to join him. This trip proved more controversial because Carpenter had seemed to lose concentration as he re-entered the Earth's atmosphere. While in Grand Turk people knew he was alive and well thanks to the Tracking Station at Colonel"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"Murray's Hill (now known by locals as Nookie Hill), the rest of the World, indeed over 65 million TV viewers were left on tenterhooks about his fate for nearly 50 minutes after hearing that the capsule had not landed where intended. While the world's media began endless debates about his health and state of mind, Scott, alive and well, came to Grand Turk for full medical checks. Other Astronauts Join Scott Carpenter On Grand Turk Fellow Mercury Astronauts John Glenn, Walter Schirra, Virgil Grissom and Leroy Gordon Cooper, joined Scott Carpenter during his debriefing on Grand Turk: Slayton was in Australia for the flight and was being flown directly to the USA to meet up with the others at Patrick Air Force Base. In fact shortly after his arrival on Grand Turk, just past midnight, Glenn and Schirra greeted Carpenter and then sat talking with him until 3.30 a.m. Carpenter apologized to the World Media and his family about giving them a 'cliff hanger,' but this was put down to the fact that Mercury Control, who knew that the craft had landed and Carpenter was alive after only a few minutes, had not told the waiting media. His landing successfully and 'fortuitously' according to the newspaper interrupted a Legislative Assembly meeting and so the Governor, His Excellency Sir Kenneth Blackburne, and members of the meeting were able to meet Scott Carpenter, John Glenn and other members of the astronaut team. In Grand Turk he was soon given a clean bill of health and the world's media were informed that the astronaut was not tired in fact 'quite the opposite.' Scott claimed that the trip did not go to plan as instruments failed and fuel ran out. The astronaut had been forced to control the capsule manually and override systems in order to land safely. A fact that led John Glenn to state later 'perhaps difficulty may actually have been a blessing in disguise, because it showed that when he has to a man can take over control of various systems operate manually and still know what he's doing.' In spite of the public outcry in the United States that Carpenter had been too ill or too tired to land correctly, the examiners in Grand Turk were so pleased with the results of their health checks that they stated, rather prophetically, that they could now consider extending manned Space flights beyond 3 orbits. So it could be said that the information recorded in Grand Turk helped shape the future of space travel.\" Continued in Part 3 . The many puzzle pieces in the Roswell UFO crash mystery.
