Buckley: \" SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS As a seasoned researcher and investigator into UFOs, crop circles and the paranormal for over thirty years, I have always been extremely careful to maintain a somewhat cautious and grounded approach when dealing with unexplained phenomena. However, in the light of recent events, some of which have been documented in this report, I feel it is time - to use a time phrase - for 'stepping outside the box.' In many respects, the crop circle phenomenon, whatever its origin, has remained largely 'inside the box.' Even though there might be many thousands, if not millions, of people who have encountered the phenomenon in one way or another and might have experienced very mysterious and bizarre events, it is the crop circles themselves which have manifested as a tangible, physical occurrence, which can be measured and recorded. At this point in time, I sense very strongly that the phenomenon, or whatever you wish to call it, is very definitely moving into a new phase, or paradigm. For those who have been conditioned to accept a 'nuts and bolts'/materialistic interpretation of what they experience, adapting to this new paradigm will be painful. Just as modern society is largely unaware and unwilling to come to terms with the relatively new quantum mechanical view of the universe, it will take time and patience for this transformation to bear fruition. Those of us who have already stepped out of the box should not, in my opinion, condemn others who are experiencing this difficulty of acceptance. Instead, we should offer support and guidance wherever possible. That is not, however, to condone ignorance and apathy, traits which are all too familiar within the public domain. The 'phenomenon' will ultimately move at its own pace, regardless of how or whether we choose to react. I have always maintained that we are dealing with a co-creative process, which is especially true of the crop circle phenomenon. On a personal level, my life has been profoundly affected by what I have experienced from childhood to the present day. Some of my experiences have been positive and enlightening; others painful and confusing. There has been a personal price to pay for 'dipping one's feet in the water,' as many other experiencers will testify. Pandora closely guards her box and offers no guarantees of comfort to those who choose to enter. Although the events described in my report are based on solid observations, I do concede that I am asking most readers to take this report with some degree of faith and trust. I have no reason to lie or fabricate information. Loyal friends who know me well will readily testify to my honesty and sincerity. Skeptics should understand that not only do I have my reputation to consider, but I also have had some difficulties in coming to terms with some of these highly strange experiences. Before addressing some of the issues raised in my report, I feel it is important to stress that while I have always attempted to maintain a scientific and objective approach to my research and investigations, my background is in the arts. I have come to appreciate that when dealing with the imagination, mind and intellectual reasoning are not always appropriate and tend to stifle new knowledge that tries to come through the heart and spirit. 'Stepping out of the box' sometimes requires a change in methodology. Paradigm shifts also demand a shift in consciousness if one is to make any progress in coming to terms with these new realities. Two years ago, I had the enormous privilege of meeting and speaking with the late Dr. John E. Mack, the Harvard Professor of Psychiatry, who researched the so-called 'alien human abduction syndrome' in the United States and wrote the best-selling 1994 book, Abduction, and 1999 book, Passport to the Cosmos. He was fully aware of the crop circle phenomenon and during the year of his untimely death (Born: October 4, 1929 – Died: September 27, 2004), he had visited Wiltshire where I met him in one of the many crop formations that year of 2004."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In his ground-breaking book, Passport to the Cosmos, he makes several references to another author whose work I respect and admire, Patrick Harpur. Just how deeply held is the world view that separates radically the material world from the realm of unseen spirit - or as Patrick Harpur would say, from unseen 'daemonic reality'? The encounters penetrate into the material world, but those manifestations are elusive, sporadic and difficult to document convincingly. The greatest source of information is the reports by experiencers themselves. UFOs and phenomena related to them (sometimes including crop circles) are, for Harpur, the ultimate daemonic realities. The physical evidence, although quite real, 'is as ambiguous as the phenomena themselves - just enough to convince those people who want to believe in their literal reality - just too little to win over the unbeliever. There is always a point of discontinuity at which the spiritual ceases to be spiritual and becomes material and vice versa.' [ Source: Passport to the Cosmos © 1999 by John E. Mack, Ph.D.] I concede that many of the events described in my report will stretch credibility to the limit for the average lay person. From my point of view, however, what I experienced was merely part of a continuing series of inexplicable happenings, which I now accept have been occurring since my childhood. Since the mid-1980s, the county of Wiltshire, England, saw an unprecedented increase in not only the crop circle phenomenon, but also sightings of unexplained aerial objects, sometimes referred to as UFOs or structured craft or balls of light (BOLS0, or luminosities. Twenty years before then in the mid-1960s, the quiet Wiltshire market town of Warminster was plunged into the international headlines when its residents experienced an extraordinary outbreak of paranormal phenomena, including UFO sightings, strange sounds, reports of 'alien entities' and 'invisible walkers' and perhaps importantly, unusual ground markings in cereal crops. By 1972, with the Warminster happenings still happening, I wasted no time in traveling down to Wiltshire to interview witnesses and experience some of these unusual phenomena for myself. By the summer of 1988, the attention and focus shifted to the agricultural landscape making up the Kennet Valley, locally known as the Vale of Pewsey. The appearance of the famous 1990 crop agriglyph at Alton Barnes heralded an unprecedented wave of crop circles and UFO sightings, which continue to the present day. Throughout the 1990s, I continued to research, investigate and experience a diverse range of phenomena, especially in the southwest of England. It would be unrealistic of me to attempt to describe these experiences in detail within the confines of this report. They have included the crop circle phenomenon, sightings of UFOs, balls of light or luminosities, together with a myriad of paranormal happening, often in the company of witnesses. The many websites, books and video documentaries, including my own published articles, testify to the reality of these phenomena. I have also accumulated a large body of research material, including a database of video footage, which I have shared with fellow researchers, friends and members of the public. Some of these experiences are so personal that it would be very difficult to explain them to a wider audience in a form that would be comprehensible in rational terms. They include the inexplicable appearance of mysterious entities, whether in the form of the archetypal 'grey alien or as invisible 'walkers,' strange sounds and disturbing presences. Reports of these entities, whether in the form of so-called aliens, faeries, elementals, devas, nature spirits and ghosts, have been part of a global folklore throughout history. While conducting my research and investigations in Wiltshire, it soon became apparent that an increasing number of witnesses were reporting similar occurrences and it was not long before I began to experience them for myself. Throughout the early 1990s, there were many attempts to contact or communicate with these unexplained entities. For example, such groups as CSETI (Center for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) led by Steven Greer, M.D. Another Project Starlight was initiated in 1992 around various sites in the Vale of Pewsey with varying degrees of success, including the 'vectoring of a structured craft' near Woodborough Hill on the night of July 26"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"to 27, 1992. Many would argue that the crop circles themselves are in the form of a coded reply from extraterrestrial agencies. Other researchers such as Andy Thomas, Karen Douglas and Paul Bura also achieved varying degrees of success in 'channeling' information from what they perceived to be the circlemakers, outlined in their fascinating book, Quest for Contact. My own somewhat humble attempts to communicate with these unexplained agencies using a series of 'meditation protocols' have also produced results and I include the events in this report as evidence of my own 'quest for contact.' What follows are some of my provisional observations and analysis. My interpretation of these events are often admittedly subjective, but nonetheless very real. Their ultimate meaning is yet to be fully understood, but certain 'clues' are emerging out of the confusion. I would also welcome the views and opinions of other readers, which are extremely valuable if we are to arrive at a greater understanding of these phenomena. 1) Woodborough Hill 'Insectogram' Crop Formation Based on the information contained in this report, I maintain that the above crop formation occurred in broad daylight on the morning of Friday, August 12, 2005, between 10:30 and 11:45 AM. I have classified the formation as an 'insectogram' because of its obvious similarity to the insect form. The name insect means literally 'in sections;' an insect's body is divided into three parts: head, thorax and abdomen. In the 2005 Woodborough Hill formation, these could be taken to correspond to the antennae, the head (comparable to preying mantis), the middle circle, and long, sinewy body and 'tail' section. To place this formation in an historical context, crop circle 'insectograms' occurred frequently in Wiltshire and Hampshire in the 1990s. Therefore, I feel the description of this formation given by researcher Andreas Mueller at www.cropcircleconnector.com [Crop-Circle Rumours] not only inaccurately describes the formation as an alien or snail, but also misleads the reader into concluding the formation is a hoax without providing any hard evidence to substantiate his claim. I also cannot place much credence that he and his associates discovered this formation in darkness on the night/morning of August 11-12, 2005. Bear in mind that according to my own account, the 'insectogram' was certainly not there on the morning of Friday, August 12, 2005, at 10:45 AM, some eight hours after Andreas says they found it. Since the formation was so small in what was a massive crop field, the chances of accidentally discovering it in darkness would have been virtually zero. \" [ Update - Editor's Note: Andreas Mueller's comment: \"Because the author of this report is questioning my credence and with it the credence of my friends and research colleagues, W. Anderhub and A. Witteveen, I would like to take the chance to clarify the discovery of the discussed formation at least as it happened to us during the night of August 11/12 in 2005: We were together on our regular crop circle night-watch-tour through the area between Avebury and Alton Barnes. We arrived on the East Field lay-by at about 3:00am and had a look around. Then out of the blue we decided to walk along the straight tramline of the still standing part of the field (just next to the Tawsmead copse fields) to the top of the hill to have a look from this vantage point, too. \"We took the first tramline and had quite a walk. During this walk we used our torch-lights time after time to see where we were going and to scan the field. (Afterwards we were thinking that we would have looked very suspicious or mysterious for other observers.) However, after some 200+ metres, I used again my light and just a few steps ahead I saw a small crop formation that I did not know of at that time - what a strange coincidence! After some looks around it became quite clear that what we were looking at was a small crooked sketch of something like an \"alien\" or \"snail\" (if you like you may also call it an \"insectogram\") figure. One can imagine how surprised and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"amazed we were ourself about this discovery! Believe it or not - but this is the story as we experienced it. Furthermore I have no explanation if this discovery was chance, coincidence or intention (by what-or whoever) or what it means, nor do I have an explanation of why Andy Buckley had not seen it when he walked through the field some hours later in broad daylight when he is so sure that he had not confused the tramlines. All I can say is that my colleagues and I have no intention to lie about our experience.\" Andreas Müller, March 13, 2007 http://www.cropcirclescience.org Andrew J. Buckley: \"A short account in the Circular Review magazine, edited by Nick Nicholson, is also similarly misleading. The article implies the formation is a hoax, without providing any evidence. My own conclusion, having conducted a thorough ground survey in what was a formation in pristine condition, was that there was absolutely no evidence of any deliberate hoaxing or mechanical flattening of the crop, either by ropes, stomping boards or garden roller. I find it difficult to understand why the formation should have been eagerly classified as a hoax by certain researchers simply because it does not conform to their 'criteria' of what they perceive to be a 'genuine' formation. Below is an interesting observation of the 2005 Woodborough Hill crop formation by Wiltshire researcher, Gill Nicholas: 'I entered the formation on Sunday, August 14, 2005, with my husband, Rob; Karleigh (young foster daughter); and Gordon Stewart (long-time friend). Gordon showed us the way into the field. After walking the whole formation, which didn't take long as it was smaller than most, I made my way to one of the antennae and sat down to tune into the energy. I found the energy to be extremely powerful, but eventually felt I had connected and asked if it were a Preying Mantis? Instantly, I was shown hundreds of little beings, such as in this drawing I produced [ Fig. A], busily scurrying about their lives. I felt a little annoyed at first with this, but realized that it was their sense of humour making its mark again, as it so often does. D rawing of 2005 Woodborough Hi ll/Tawsmead Copse 'insectogram' © 2005 by Gill Nicholas."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I decided to move from the antenna, as I was not too comfortable with the energy. Everyone else was sitting around the tuft in the main circle of the body. On entering the circle part, I was amazed how the energy changed. I intuitively felt that this center section was to let us know that they have incredibly large hearts. It was a very peaceful, yet joyful place to be. Both Karleigh, who is our foster daughter, and I made drawings. We counted seven standing tufts, one flattened swirl, which Karleigh called the nose, and two knots for eyes, which were twisted to a height of approximately one foot. They had two individual loose stems of wheat positioned into each of the knots, which protruded horizontally away from them.' - Gill Nicholas, August 2005\" To be continued in Part 5 - Ball of Light and Appearance of Mysterious Girl More Information: F or further information about crop formations, please see reports below and going back to 1999 in the Earthfiles Archives and my book, Mysterious Lights and Crop Circles in the Earthfiles Shop: • 09/06/2006 -- Part 4: Five Circle Pattern in Geneseo, I llinois, Soybeans • 08/31/2006 -- Part 3: Five Circle Pattern in Geneseo, I llinois, Soybeans • 08/28/2006 -- Part 2: Five Circle Pattern in Geneseo, I llinois, Soybeans • 08/27/2006 -- Part 1: Five Circle Pattern in Geneseo, I llinois, Soybeans • 08/17/2006 -- M ilitary Helicopter Aggression Toward Red Sphere in U.
