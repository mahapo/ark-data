For the next few minutes, Justina heard rocks raining down on the roof so loudly that she worried her house would collapse. What 74-year-old Justina Limache did not know was that a meteorite had fallen near her Carancas, Peru, home 62 miles (100 kilometers) southeast of P uno and not far from Lake Titicaca. Carancas is a farm community of about 2,000 people who raise cows, alpacas, llamas and other animals on the high Andean plateau near the Bolivian border.

Dr. Machare and his colleague, Luisa Macedo F., have overseen the analysis of the crater water, soil and some meteoritic fragments. Their first preliminary report with images is reproduced below in its entirety. I asked Dr. Machare if he was able to confirm that a physical meteorite from outer space had slammed into the Carancas, Peru, landscape. Interview: Jose Machare, Science Doctorate and Geological Engineer, Ingemmet (Geology, Mining and Metallurgical Institute), Lima, Peru: “We have recovered some pieces of the meteorite. HOW MUCH METEORITE DID YOU RECOVER? Just some small pieces of 5 centimeters (2 inches). The fragments were collected first by the local police (from residents who gathered them) and the police gave us some pieces. [ See preliminary report below.] WHERE IS THE REST OF THE METEORITE? We are not sure. We are trying in the next days to identify if parts of the remaining meteorite are still in the Earth below the small lake that is in the crater. The small crater is about 7.5 meters in diameter with a lake in the center. We cannot see what is inside. C arancas, Peru, meteorite crater and groundwater. WHERE DID THE WATER COME FROM? It is ground water that came out right after the impact. The water table is about one meter below the surface, very high water table. So, ground water was impacted and now it appears within the crater."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"C arancas, Peru, meteorite crater and groundwater. WHAT MADE THE PEOPLE AND ANIMALS SICK? We don’t know exactly because we are st ill analyzing waters. We have water samples from a couple days ago to see if there is any harmful element. But we don’t know exactly was the cause of the illness of people. AT SPACEWEATHER.COM, IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THE GROUND IS FULL OF ARSENIC AND THAT IT IS ARSENIC THAT MADE THE PEOPLE AND ANIMALS SICK. I AM READING FROM SPACEWEATHER.COM: ‘THE CRASH SITE COINCIDES WITH A NATURAL UNDERGROUND DEPOSIT OF ARSENIC.’ No. This is not proven. We have not released this news because we have not performed the water and soil analysis up to now. So that is not correct information. I understand from the first day, there has been anecdotal information about the sickness of people and supposing about arsenic or other components. But nobody has released clear chemical analyses for either the water or remaining dust or fragments of the meteorite. We will have this information in two or three days. DO YOU THINK ARSENIC IS IN THE SOIL THERE? Normal composition includes some arsenic, but it’s not a main component of the soils. WHERE DO YOU THINK THAT SPACEWEATHER.COM WOULD RECEIVE THIS INFORMATION AND POST IT AS A HEADLINE TODAY? Really, I don’t know. I have not released information at least to them about these possible contents of arsenic and that arsenic was the cause of the sickness. It was not our information. YOU WON’T HAVE FINAL RESULTS FOR TWO OR THREE DAYS? Yes, we will have the information in two or three days (by September 27 or 28). AS A MINING ENGINEER, WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS IN THE SOIL THAT MADE THE PEOPLE AND ANIMALS SICK? (laughs) Yes, this is a question I prefer not to answer because really I don’t know. I would prefer to have the results first to explain that, yes? "},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"ONE OTHER CONTROVERSIAL HEADLINE HAS COME FROM RUSSIA. THE PRAVDA NEWSPAPER SAYS THAT IT WAS NOT A METEORITE THAT CAME DOWN IN PERU, BUT THAT IT WAS AN AMERICAN SATELLITE. (laughs) Yes, it was talked about just after the crash, but looking at the samples we are sure now it’s a rock, a meteorite. WHAT WOULD HAVE MADE THE GROUND WATER BOIL WHEN THIS IMPACTED? We suppose that it boiled only from anecdotal arguments from witnesses. We were not there. If it boiled, I imagine it was because the meteorite was still hot. VERY HOT. WOULD THE COMPOSITION OF THIS METEORITE, WHICH IS LARGELY SILICATE, WITH SOME IRON AND IRON SULFATE, BE ABLE TO GET VERY HOT? We don’t really know. I don’t really know. I don’t have an answer for this question.\" The Carancas Meteorite Fall, 15 September 2007 Official INGEMMET Initial Report Released 21 September 2007 (Without Final Lab Test Results) Luisa Macedo F. & José Macharé O., Geological Engineers Instituto de Ingenieros de Minas del Peru ( Geology, Mining and Metallurgical Institute ) Urb.

Impact date and time Day 15 September 2007 Local time: 11:45 h World time 19:45 h Geological setting The impact point is locates in a high plateau (Puna) formed upon a Cenozoic continental sedimentary rocks (molasses or red beds: siltsones, shales and slates) of the Puno Group (Palacios, 1993). The zone displays the development of a few meters thick reddish brown soil. General description of the phenomenon (Only anecdotic information based upon witnesses’ declarations ) Apparent displacement azimuth of the object: towards N030°E. The object was observed since it was at about 1 000 m from the earth surface. The object presented a strongly luminous head (white light) and a white smoky queue. No other objects were observed to fall after the main body. There was a strong explosion that was felt up to Desaguadero city 20 km from the impact site. Some window glasses of the Local Health Center (at 1 km from the site) were broken. The explosion “sound” lasts about 15 minutes (!) After the impact, boiling water was seen in the crater, and a smoke column was formed that lasts for several minutes. A “sulfurous” smell was reported there. General description of effects on ground The impact created a crater when collided with the soft ground (reddish brown soil). The crater is composed by a hole and an ejecta rim. The central hole became a pond, by infill with groundwater that crops out after the impact (figure 2). The following table gives the diameters and other measures of the geoform."},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"The maximum rim height was 1 m above the original soil level, and was seen in the northern border. The photo of figure 2 is looking northward. Dispersal ejecta made by brown soil with grey patina (meteorite powder), up to 5 cm in diameter were found at 200 m from the impact point. Three days after the fall, water in the pond was 1 m below the original soil level. It presented turbid brown aspect, with pH = 7.8, temperature 17.9°C, conductivity > 4000 milisiems, and total suspended solids > 2000 ppm.

First results of meteorite samples analyzed Sampling by the INGEMMET scientist has been only partial. When she arrived, 36 hours later than the impact occurred, most major fragments had been taken by villagers. Naked-eye observations show fine grained, light grey, fragile rocky material with disseminated iron of 1mm diameter (figures 4, 5, and 6). MORE IMAGES TO BE ADDED. Thin and polished sections were prepared for petro-mineralogic determinations under optical microscope. They revealed chondritic texture, and a mineral composition including pyroxene, olivine, iron, troilite, and alkali (?) feldspar. Fig. 5 Natural aspect with iron oxide inclusion.

Ongoing and proposed further studies Initial results will be complemented and refined with ICP-MS chemical analysis and SEM-Edax analysis being done in Peru. Results are expected at the beginning of the next week. Several world scientists have offered to participate with special tests including oxygen isotope analyses to study the origin, ESEM and FESEM studies and determinations of C/N and C/S ratios in any interesting embedded microstructures, and FE ASEM probing to characterize impact microstructures. Water from the pond as well as soil samples from the impact zone are being analyzed for chemical composition in Peru. Final considerations Scientists from the Peruvian Institute of Nuclear Energy have reported that non radioactive material was detected in association with the sampled object. From our field observations and information given by the Puno Regional Health Director, the initial report about 200 people affected by headache, vomits and stomachache seems exaggerated. Ill people would be around 30, and additional 20 children from the local school are being examined. Causes of illness are still unknown. Owing to the social issues associated with the impact, new results will continue to reach first the Instituto de Defensa Civil (INDECI) which authorize their public release. It is recommended to protect the site to preserve the field evidence and allow further research.
