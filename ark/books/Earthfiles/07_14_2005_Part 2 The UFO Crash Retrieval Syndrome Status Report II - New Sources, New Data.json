Air Force Sergeant, 97th Bomber Wing R eturn to previous Part 1 T o be more computer-friendly, the reprint has been divided into parts. Here begins Part 2 of Status Report II, written in January 1980. The series of status reports, I through VII, were written by Leonard H. Stringfield from 1978 to 1994. Previous Status Report III begins at Earthfiles. Leonard Stringfield died on December 18, 1994. For all the previous status reports, see Earthfiles Archives. \" CASE A-2 Significant in this case is that the testimony from a secondhand source of information was substantiated when I reached the firsthand source. To achieve this took time and a stroke of strategy and luck in reaching the real source for a commitment. This case was first reported in Abstract # 16 of my previous paper ( Status Report I ) to be reprinted in upcoming Earthfiles, the erstwhile informant being the wife referred to as SI. In review, her information revealed to me in August 1977 follows: The year was 1973 when Carl, a Sergeant and Air Policeman in the U. S. Air Force, was called to duty during the night. He was driven to a certain location, then was blindfolded. She said he recalled that he was led across a field of wet grass and then was helped down a flight of stairs and escorted through a long corridor. At a certain point, he was halted and his blindfold removed. There, he was issued instructions about his mission and where to stand guard. To his shock, he was in a room with ranking officers and plainclothes specialists who were viewing three small humanoid bodies. The aliens were dead and were stretched out on a table. She remembers Carl telling her that the bodies were about 3 feet tall, their heads abnormally large, and they seemed to have short fuzz on the top of their heads. The skin, she said, was an off-white or cream. She could recall no other facial features described by Carl, admitting that the only time Carl had talked about his experience was while they were courting. That was in 1975. At that time, she said, he seemed shaken by it. 'I believe he was dramatically affected,' she said. 'One time he told his sister about it and she just laughed. Since then, he refuses to discuss the matter with anyone, even me.' On several later occasions when I called Mrs. SI, I asked to speak to Carl. One night he was present, sitting at a table drinking coffee, when I called. I remember she asked him if he would be willing to talk with me about his experience, but he declined. Said SI when she returned to the phone, 'He said he's not allowed to talk about it and that he will tell everything he knows after President Carter makes an announcement.' Because of her illness and SI's wish not to be involved in UFOs again, a long gap of time elapsed before I chanced a call to check on her well being. Her health restored and sounding cheerful, I then brought her up to date on my successes and failures in "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"the pursuit of retrieval stories. But when I asked to speak to Carl, she reiterated his reluctance to talk about his 1973 experience. 'He won't talk,' she said. 'He was too emotionally affected.' Already knowing of Carl's place of employment and that his on-duty schedule was subject to change, I asked her for the time of day he could be conveniently reached. I hinted that I might call him 'on a long shot.' She obliged, but offered no encouragement. On October 17, 1978, a well-timed call reached Carl at work during a coffee break. Without hesitation, I announced my purpose and cited some strong data from other sources relative to his experience and assured him that his name or identity would never be disclosed. After a long silence, Carl reluctantly confirmed his experience and described the scene he witnessed while on guard duty. While his information generally agreed with that expressed by his wife, he also revealed that the facial characteristics of all three entities were similar and that the skin was the same color as a 'drowned cadaver just brought out of the water.' When asked about his reaction to the event, he said in a low voice, 'I was shocked. I'd rather forget it.' He offered nothing more, nor did I want to press the issue. I felt that I had achieved a real breakthrough. Carl was now a firsthand witness. COMMENT: My informant, Carl, had no information concerning the actual retrieval operation, but undoubtedly the recovered bodies came from a recent crash incident. I have no reason to question Carl's veracity. His behavioral reaction to my questions and voice intonation told the truth. Carl does not want any part of active UFO research and prefers to be left alone and not bothered by the subject. When I later checked for confirmation with an Intelligence source about the 1973 retrieval, I got, 'No comment.' CASE A-3 On June 29, 1978, my son-in-law, Jeffrey Sparks, then an Assistant Professor at St. Leo College, Dade City, Florida, informed me that he had talked with a person who had witnessed the alien humanoids at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1966. According to Jeff, his contact held a responsible position in a financial capacity with a private firm in Tampa, Florida, and had formerly served in Army Intelligence. He gave me the individual's name and where he could be reached. On July 5, 1978, I talked with Mr. JK at length concerning his functions in Intelligence and what he had observed at Wright-Patterson AFB, plus many other aspects of UFO crashes and retrieval operations. He also made reference to the computer bank, or 'dump file,' which contains secret information about UFOs dating back to 1948. JK, whose duties were connected with the Nike Missile, related to me the following data: - He observed nine deceased alien bodies preserved in deep freeze conditions under well-lighted, thick glass enclosures. The bodies were short in stature, about 4 feet in height. They appeared under lighting to be grayish color in skin tone. The area where the bodies were preserved was under heavy guard, inside and out. He was told while viewing the subjects that 30 bodies were held in preservation at that time at the air base. - He did not see firsthand the alien craft stored at Wright-Patterson AFB, but was told that such craft were on the base. He was also told that an alien craft was held at Langley AFB, Virginia, and another at McDill AFB in Florida. - He knew of three key areas in the 1960s where certain secret UFO research operations were conducted other than at Wright-Patterson AFB. Bases cited were Langley, Avon Bombing Range - a part of the McDill AFB complex near Sebring, Florida; and at Seymour-Johnson AFB in Goldsboro, North Carolina. - At certain military bases, highly trained mobilized units were in a constant 'ready' state for dispatch to any area in the U.S.A. to recover downed or crashed UFOs. These special forces at the time were known as the 'Blue Berets' which can operate secretly and effectively by using diversionary tactics to prevent public interference. Such diversions include creating power blackouts."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":" - During JK's tenure of service in the Vietnam crisis, five crashes of UFOs occurred between 1966-1968 in the Tri-State area of Ohio, Indiana (near Evansville) and Kentucky. There was one known incident of a retrieval of three alien bodies. During this alleged incident, there occurred a skirmish with the alien forces by our military units. this was triggered by the uncertainty of the aliens' intent. Hostility was presumed, said JK. The location or time of these incidents were not disclosed. - Said JK, 'Since 1948, secret information concerning UFO activity involving the U. S. military has been contained in a computer center at Wright-Patterson AFB. At this base, a master computer file is maintained with duplicate support backup files secreted at other military installations.' JK also said, 'Get the complete 'dump file,' both the master and the support backup files, and you've got all the hidden UFO data.' Thus, substantive UFO data are not available through the Freedom of Information Act, nor on file at the National Archives in Washington, D. C. COMMENT: I have had a number of long talks with JK since July 1978, which was reported in Abstract # 21 of my first paper ( Status Report I ). Some additional information he related concerning certain technical phases of his former work is not included here on his request. One of our chats revealed that he was stationed at Wright-Patterson AFB when Barry Goldwater had visited the base hoping to get permission from General Curtis Lemay to see the UFO evidence stored there, but was denied. JK said, 'This refusal caused quite a fiasco on the base.' While visiting the University in Dade City, Florida, for a lecture in April 1979, I was unable to meet JK, as arranged. However, I was surprised that following my talk, waiting to see me privately was a former member of the elite 'Blue Berets.' I remembered JK had pointed out the functions of this covert service. The next day, CAM - the ex-'Blue Beret' - visited my daughter's home. Alone, we talked about the elite force, its make-up and functions and some of his experiences in Vietnam behind enemy lines. Although he had never participated in a UFO crash/retrieval, he was aware that one of his fellow members had had the experience. Details were scanty, but CAM recalls that his friend referred to his participation in the recovery of a 'big head' from an alien craft. My last talk with JK was September 12, 1979, at which time he was doing well as proprietor of his own business. He reaffirmed as true all of his past claims. CASE A-4 My informant is self-employed after serving a long career with the U. S. Air Force, retiring with the rank of Major. He was a pilot as well as filling other special assignments. During the mid-1950s, he served in an official capacity with the Ground Observers Corp (GOC), at which time I was asked by the Air Defense Command to screen and report UFO activity by code name, FOX TROT KILO 3-0 BLUE. During this active period, I was often in communication with the Major. My informant called me in the winter of 1979 when he learned from Tom Shell, newsman for ABC-TV in Los Angeles, that I had been considered by that network to be interviewed for a major TV production featuring the UFO. My informant said he recommended me, having known of my former work in the GOC and as publisher of OBIT in the late 1950s. during one of our several discussions of the UFO problem, when I cited some of the medical information relative to the recovered alien humanoids, he confided that in 1952 he had attended a high-level secret meeting at Wright-Patterson AFB and saw in an underground chamber one of the deceased alien bodies in deep-freeze preservation. My informant recalls some of the physiological characteristics of the corpse from his yesteryear observation, but admits details are vague. He said the body, with its long arms positioned straight down alongside it, was about 4 feet tall. The head was large by human standards and the skin on the face appeared smooth and gray. No bone structure was evident. Eyes were open, no hair. The feet, he said, were like an orangutan. My informant stated he had visited the Air Force's underground complex in Colorado Springs and that some of the UFO material that had been stored at the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Wright-Patterson depository had been transferred there. He also admits having seen a portion of an air Force movie which showed an alien craft embedded in the sand of a desert-like region. Aware of this film, I asked if he saw the portion showing the deceased bodies. (See Case A-9.) He said that at the time of the movie review, he was preoccupied with other business and missed seeing that portion. My informant disclosed that he is aware of secret Air Force orders in the early 1950s which directed pilots on UFO intercept missions to shoot down or ram their target. He did not know of any successful mission of this kind which forced down or caused a UFO to crash. In one instance, he said, he was aware of an incident when a UFO was surrounded by jets, but escaped by its highly evasive tactics. COMMENT: In support of the Major's information concerning tactical operations involving the UFO and interceptors of the USAF, Mildred Biesele of Salt Lake City, Utah, who serves as contributing Editor for the MUFON UFO Journal, sent me the following item which is typical of other reports known to me since the early 1950s. Her letter of October 2, 1979, is quoted in part below: Letter from Mildred Biesele, October 2, 1979: 'I heard you speak at the MUFON Symposium in Dayton last year and I am interested in your research on 'Retrievals of the third Kind.' ...I gave a talk at a local library last week and in the discussion period following, a fellow told me that when he was a gunner in the U. S. Air Force, he had emptied his guns on a UFO and had taken pictures with his gun camera that clearly showed the shells exploding against the side of the craft. He said the camera was taken off the wing of his plane when he landed and the pictures were developed. At 2 a.m., a couple of military policemen came and got him out of bed and took him to the base auditorium. They ran the 17 seconds of movie of the UFO over and over and questioned him, and two other crew members until 10 a.m. He was warned never to tell anyone what had happened. ...He said he had a wife and family, a good job, and a lot to lose. He seemed afraid of the C.I.A., and would not even give me his name.' CASE A-5 Following my second lecture, April 6, 1978, before the Cincinnati Chapter of the World Wings Association, a gathering of 50 or more pilots, I was approached by a member of the association who knew of a 'person at work' who knew about crashed UFOs and occupants. As reported in Abstract # 19 ( Status Report I ) of my previous paper, I promptly got in touch. On April 18, 1978, I talked with former Air Force Sergeant MS of the 97th Bomber Wing. He was prepared to relate information from a high-ranking intelligence source relative to the retrieval of alien craft and humanoid occupants allegedly maintained at Wright-Patterson AFB. He also related a sobering story about a landing on an Air Force base, also from the same source. MS, while serving at Wright-Patterson AFB in 1977, made close acquaintance with Major General 'T,' who was assigned at Wright-Patterson for top security work in the Logistics Command. His rank and the nature of his work entitled him to a plane at his disposal at all times. He and the General's daughter (name known to me) were seriously lovelorn, and on that basis were frequently together. This allowed MS to be a guest at the General's home where he and the general had private chats. From General 'T,' according to my informant, details were disclosed concerning a UFO that had crashed in the southwest region of the United States in 1957. At that time, General 'T' was a Lt. Colonel. According to the General, radar had confirmed that an alien craft had crossed the skies over the United States at great speed. It was tracked to the point of its crash. The area, as in most cases, was 'roped off,' and a military unit summoned (with canines) for maximum security. From the damaged craft, four humanoid bodies were recovered with great difficulty because of the inability to penetrate the craft's metal structure. The deceased bodies were found badly burned, some parts so severely that certain features were indistinguishable. However, the suits they wore - appearing silver - were not damaged by the obviously intense heat endured inside the craft. Said the General, 'The suits were fused to the flesh.'"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":" According to the General, the four bodies - approximately 5 feet in height - were sent to Wright-Patterson AFB where he had seen them in a deep-freeze morgue which was kept at approximately 120 degrees F. below zero for preservation. The only other anatomical feature described by General 'T' was that the heads of the aliens were large by human standards. Facial features were erased by the heat factor. The craft? The General related that scientists assigned to the task of dismantling it ran into difficulty. To get inside, they concentrated on an area where a fissure or crack had resulted, probably from impact. Shipment to Wright-Patterson, he said, quoting the General, 'Was by rail, using two military conveyance rocket cars, properly camouflaged and classified as 'rockets.' On another occasion, MS was a guest of the General at his home. While alone with the General, MS was shown a Top Secret document concerning a landed UFO. The incident occurred at Nellis AFB in Nevada in 1968. MS expressed disbelief when he read the report. Stamped TOP SECRET, it read in part: Large UFO hovered over Nellis AFB for three days. Three small alien craft were observed separating (or being ejected) from parent craft. One landed on the air base grounds. Sent to greet the landed craft was a Colonel with security detachment properly armed. There was no mention of an attempt to assault the craft. While waiting for a sign of intent, a humanoid was observed to disembark from the craft and was described as 'short and stocky.' Then a beam of light was directed at the Colonel. The Colonel was instantly paralyzed, according to the report. Orders then came from the officer next in command for his detachment to fire, but their weapons jammed. The UFO was observed to retreat to its parent craft and then departed. The Colonel was hospitalized. The only recall by the Colonel, as MS remembers from the report, was that he could recount the event only in terms of mathematics, as though an attempt at communications had been conducted in this manner. COMMENT: I made a check on General 'T' at Wright-Patterson AFB. They had no entry of his name as having been stationed there. However, when MS (and a witness) called the Accounting and Finance Section at Lowry AFB, Denver, Colorado, to obtain the General's new address in the area he had planned to retire, he was refused on grounds of the Privacy Act. But the General's name was on record. To authenticate the General's report on the Nellis AFB incident, I checked with an Intelligence source and obtained confirmation. (See Case A-6). During August of 1978, MS tried several times through other military friends to make personal contact with the General, but to no avail. On September 28, 1978, to check on a detail about MS's personal life, I called his employer and talked with the comptroller, the person who arranged our contact initially, and learned to my surprise that my informant had suddenly left his job three weeks before. The Comptroller said that MS had a service-related back disability and had gone to Wright-Patterson AFB for corrective surgery. MS has since become unreachable, having left no new home address or phone number.\" Continued in Part 3 - 1962 Crashed UFO in New Mexico Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
