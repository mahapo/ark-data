Like something I've never seen before.\" - Janet Ossebaard, Writer and Photographer, Gieten, The Netherlands May 21, 2000 Burghasungen, Germany - For the past several years in a beautiful farm valley between Kassel and Zierenberg, Germany, a crop formation has been discovered the same day of each year on May 1st. Anticipating the possibility of watching whatever light or energy or unknown process makes the crop glyphs, a group of about twenty people gathered on the hill tops around the valley on April 30, 2000 to watch all night. Among the various scattered groups were Bert Janssen and Janet Ossebaard from Gieten, Holland and Frank Laumen from Germany. The three have known each other for a long time in their shared passion to try to understand the crop circle mystery and the forces and intelligence behind it. What happened for all of them on that night from April 30 to May 1, 2000 was so strange that Janet Ossebaard, a professional writer and photographer, told me the experience was unlike any other in her life. Interview: Janet Ossebaard, Crop Circle Researcher, Writer and Photographer, Gieten, The Netherlands: \"At 2 AM, all of a sudden, it became extremely dark and it was so weird that it was not like anything I have ever experienced before. The situation was that we were sitting in the car on the front seat overwatching this area, this valley which "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"is really pretty. And of course it was dark because it was in the middle of the night. But, you could see the villages. You could see the orange street lights and car lights. There was a motorway running behind us and it curved to our left so you could see the cars there. So there were constant lights. There were no stars or moon because it was very cloudy. Dry, but cloudy. However, you could see many lights because of those villages. Now, all of a sudden at 2 AM, those lights diminished. They became very dim, but gradually. It was not like they were switched off. It was not an electricity failure. But bit by bit, they became less visible. This took a second, a matter of seconds. And Bert said to me, \"Hey, look at that!\" And I noticed. I said, \"Yeah, what's happening?!\" And it was really weird. And bit by bit it became more and more dark. And all of a sudden, it was completely pitch black like I've never seen before. And at the same time, there was no sound left. No sound whatsoever. Normally you can hear the night sounds which is wind in the trees, a bird, an owl or whatever. You can hear many sounds at night. But there was no sound whatsoever. And it was like we were sitting on a big black blanket or something, you know? Or one of those glass bulbs over cheese to keep it fresh? LIKE SOME KIND OF CONTAINER, OR LID, CAME DOWN OVER YOU. DID YOU GUYS GET OUT OF THE CAR TO SEE WHAT IT FELT LIKE OUTSIDE? No, we didn't. We just stayed in. We had the windows open, so we could feel the atmosphere and there was no difference in atmosphere. We talked to each other and we were sort of whispering because it was so overwhelming. We had no idea what it was. But the street lights were gone, the villages were gone, the sound was gone, the cars on the motorway. There was no motorway anymore as far as we knew at that time. It was absolutely we were completely isolated from the rest of the world. And it felt really nice. We had a very nice protected feeling, very nice. We had a very nice protected feeling, very isolated, protected warm feeling. But there was nothing else that we sensed. There was no difference in our voice. It didn't look like a mist though. There was no mist because at a certain moment, there was a car driving right beneath where we were standing. We were standing on a bit of a hill. And the car looked pretty close to us. And we could see it very clearly. And Bert said, \"Hey, look at that. That is weird!\" All of a sudden we see this car, but there is no fog. Look at the headlights. We realized there was no fog. But yet, we couldn't see anywhere. As soon as the car was gone, everything was gone. It was like we were in a pitch black universe floating or something. It was really weird. DID THE OTHER GERMANS SEE THAT FRANK LAUMEN AND THE OTHERS? Yes, everybody. The next morning, we talked to each other about this. Everybody noticed it. This happened from 2 AM to 2:15 AM. So for about a quarter of an hour it was pitch black. Then it lifted. And it was like it came from above because you could see the lights that were lowest in the valley became clear first and then it came up and up and up until the highest lights on the top of the hill. So, it was a big blanket coming down from above. Not like a mist. Like something else I've never seen before. This lasted for about 15 minutes and then the sound was back, the cars were back, the motorway, the villages, it was back to normal. And we said to each other, \"Wow, if there is a crop formation in the morning, this is the time it happened now.\" Then it happened again at 3 AM, exactly 3 AM it happened again until 3:15"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"AM. And it was even more intense than the first time. Really, really intense. And at 3:15 AM it lifted again and I became very tired. And I really had the feeling. It happened. It is there. It's there. There is nothing we can do. We didn't see it. There was no sound, no balls of light. This is it. So I can go to sleep now. AT FIRST LIGHT, DID YOU GUYS WAKE UP? Yes, we all woke up. We gathered, the Germans and us. Everybody had noticed it and everybody was convinced there was a formation. So we started driving around to look for it. And we couldn't find it. And we were surprised. And we looked and looked and looked and drove for miles through the area. And there was nothing. And we couldn't find the Germans anymore. They had gone home or disappeared or whatever. So, eventually disappointed, we decided to go home. We drove back to Holland which is about 6 hours drive and we got there and Frank gave us a call. \"Hey, there's a formation.\" We said, \"What! Where?\" And he said, \"Just behind us.\" We said, \"No, this can't be!\" Like I said, the motorway was running behind us and just on the other side of the motorway was a beautiful formation. Two circles connected by a pathway, not very complex. But this is it. He went to visit it a few days later and he called us and said, \"It's gorgeous. So pretty.\" And he took photos. Beautiful with pole shots. And he took a pole shot from 80 meters, which is a big distance. His camera did not work. And he has an EN-1, A Canon professional camera. It costs a lot, really expensive. And his professional camera failed and he said, \"My camera has never failed. I can throw this camera on the ground and it will survive. It will not be harmed.\" More Information: On May 1, 2000, crop researcher and photographer, Frank Laumen, found this formation across a major freeway and in a field of yellow flowering canola that was behind the hills where everyone watched on April 30, 2000, the night that a strange blackness descended that no one had ever seen before.
