April 19, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - On Friday, April 17, 2009, after posting the Earthfiles report, “Spider-Like ‘Drone’ Photographed Over Petten, Holland,” I received communication from a Netherlands resident now working in Beijing, China, about the Earthfiles report. He discussed the nuclear reactor fac ility in Petten, only one of three in the Netherlands and one of the world's most important producers of isotopes for medical uses. I asked Ruud Schmidt if he knew about the reactor and he said that he and his family only think of Petten as a recreational campground. 1) Subject: Regarding the Dutch Dragonfly Drone Date: April 17, 2009 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “ I am a Dutch guy living and working in Beijing, China. I was reading about the Dutch drone case on your site. I'm pretty familiar with the area where the sighting took place. I don't know if you are aware of this, but Petten, where the sighting took place, is also the location of a nuclear research fac ility: W ikipidia article: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petten_nuclear_reactor L ocation: http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&q=petten+nuclear&ie= UTF8&ll=52.787717,4.678202&spn=0.003342,0.009656&t=h&z=17 The Netherlands has only three nuclear facilities. There's a big commercial nuclear power plant in the southwest of the country, a small research reactor at the technical university in Delft and the facility in Petten. Therefore I thought it rather interesting that a drone would turn up in Petten of all places. Except for the reactor there's really nothing of interest there. It's mainly a recreation zone. The Petten facility is rather controversial. Through the years there have been safety problems and some people who have worked there have died young of rare types of cancer, including the father of a colleague of mine who had worked there for many years as a nuclear scientist. The facility is somewhat shrouded in mystery. Although the Petten nuclear facility plays an important "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"role in producing isotopes for medical use in Europe, there is also cutting edge secret research going on there. The drone could be spying, but it might just as well be theirs! I just want to emphasize again that I feel very strongly that there must be a connection between the drone and the facility. Petten is an important place and plays a strategic role in European energy research. The facility is not even owned by the Dutch government, but by the European Commission. The research being done there is not only related to nuclear energy but other types of energy as well. For example, there's groundbreaking research being done in the field fuel cells for example. I used to know a guy who works there on fuel cells. Check this link: http://www.ecn.nl/en/ For what it's worth, my opinion is that the drone is American and engaged in espionage. If I were the American government, I would want to know what happens in Petten.” I also found a National Radio Report (NPR) dated October 15, 2008, only six months ago, about the Petten nuclear reactor to restart on February 16, 2009, after many weeks offline. NPR reported: “The Petten unit is one of a few reactors that maintains global medical isotope supplies. Traces of gas bubbles were detected in the primary cooling system of the High Flux Reactor (HFR) at Petten in the Netherlands during the course of an August 2008 inspection. NRG described the finding as an ‘anomaly’ at the time, and explained that the bubbles were caused by corrosion of the pipe work of the primary cooling system. H igh Flux Reactor (HFR) during operation in Petten, Holland. Image source: NPR. “On August 21, 2008, NRG decided not to start up the reactor at the end of the month-long major maintenance and inspection program. ... HFR i the source of 30-40% of the world's medical isotopes, which are used in a variety of imaging procedures for diagnosis as well as radiotherapy. A key product from HFR is molybdenum-99, which decays into technetium-99m, used for medical imaging. Molytbdenum-99 has a half-life of just 66 hours, so deliveries to hospitals need to be regular and frequent.” The Petten problem highlighted the global shortage of isotope production when the only available reactor in Europe with production capacity was coupled to the only available production line left in Europe at the Osiris reactor in France. 2) Subject: Strange Similarity Date: April 19, 2009 To: earthfiles@earthfiles.com “Dear Linda, The attached pics are only suggestive, but something to consider? I walked through that crop formation, while Charles arrived on his bicycle and inspected it. But hundreds of people had just come through on a tour group, so there was no way to tell whether it might be real or fake.” “Sit down before fact like a little child, and follow wherever it leads, or else you will learn nothing.”"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"L eft: Wheat formation reported July 27, 2008, in East Field, Wiltshire County, England.
