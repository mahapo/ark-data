Climate Research Director Steps Down Pending University Inquiry © 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe “I f the current [ice melt] trend continues or gets worse, Antarctica could become the latest contributor to sea level rises in the world. It could start to lose more ice than Greenland in a few years.” - J ianli Chen, Ph.D., University of Texas-Austin December 2, 2009 Norwich, England - Phil Jones, Ph.D., Director, Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and professor in the School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia in Norwich, England, used the word “trick” to “hide the decline” in a chart detailing a recent plateau of global temperatures. Dr. Jones's email is among thousands of pieces of correspondence among various scientists about global climate change data. Dr. Jones argues he used the word “trick” to mean “a clever thing to do.” Further embarrassing leaked emails include how to keep scientific work that is critical of a global warming trend out of peer-reviewed journals. P hil Jones, Ph.D., Director, Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and Prof. of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia, Norwich, England, stepped down on Tuesday, December 1, 2009, pending the university's independent inquiry about allegations of scientific misconduct.

With the international Copenhagen, Denmark, climate change talks scheduled for December 7 to 18, 2009, a House Select Committee Hearing on the State of Climate Science is being held today by Chairman Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) Speaking before the House committee will be John Holdren, Ph.D., Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, and formerly a Harvard University professor and Director of the Woods Hole Research Center. Also speaking will be Jane Lubchenco, Ph.D., Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the leading climate office in the United States. Their respective scientific perspectives are that global warming is real and the science indicates that it is getting worse and ice around the planet is melting faster than expected. NASA/JPL GRACE Satellites Show Arctic, Greenland and Antarctic Ice Melting Faster Than Expected “I ce asks no questions, presents no arguments, reads no newspapers, listens to no debates. It is not burdened by ideology and carries no political baggage as it changes from solid to liquid. It just melts.” - H enry Pollack, Ph.D., Geophysicist, Univ. of Michigan and Participant, 2007 Nobel Peace Prize "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"I ce-flow off the rugged west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula, Antarctica.

O ne of twin GRACE satellites launched in March 2002, are making detailed measurements of Earth's gravity field, which will lead to discoveries about gravity and Earth's natural systems. Image by NASA. NASA's Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellites continue making aerial surveys that indicate the East Antarctic ice sheet is melting faster than expected - 57 billion tons of ice a year are melting into the Antarctic seas. GRACE data also shows the Greenland ice sheet melt is accelerating. See: NASA/JPL GRACE. In the November 2009 issue of Nature Geoscience , Jianli Chen, Ph.D., University of Texas in Austin, used NASA GRACE satellite ice surveys between April 2002 and January 2009 that confirm the West Antarctic ice sheet is melting rapidly with the loss of 132 billion tons of ice a year and unexpected and rapid melting in the larger East Antarctic ice sheet now estimated to be 57 billions tons of more ice melt per year. Dr. Chen reports, “If the current [ice melt] trend continues or gets worse, Antarctica could become the latest contributor to sea level rises in the world. It could start to lose more ice than Greenland in a few years.” See: November 2009 issue Nature Geoscience. More Than Hundred Ice Bergs Drifting to New Zealand from Antarctica"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"In this Nov. 16, 2009, photo released by the Australian Antarctic Division, an iceberg is seen at Sandy Bay on Macquarie Island's east coast, in the Southern Ocean 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) southeast of Tasmania, Australia. It is very rare to see icebergs from Macquari e Island and i s uncommon to fi nd icebergs in thi s general regi on. Image by Eve Merfield, Australian Antarctic Division. Mike Williams, Ph.D., a physicist with the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research , reports that more than 100 icebergs are drifting toward New Zealand at a speed of 16 miles a day (25 kilometers). “I am pretty sure these icebergs came from the break up of the Antarctic Ross Sea Ice Shelf in 2000 and the 2006 melt and break up of an ice shelf the size of France.” The nearest one, measuring about 330 to 660 feet (100 to 200 meters) long, was 160 miles (260 kilometers) southeast of New Zealand's Stewart Island on November 25, 2009. Giant Jelly Fish Threaten Japanese Fishing Industry Creatures spreading northward in warming ocean waters A research team led by Japan's Shin-ichi Uye, Ph.D., Professor of Biological Oceanography, Hiroshima University, have been monitoring the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea for jellyfish movement and found shocking numbers of Echizen jellyfish, also known as Nomura's Jellyfish. Nomura's Jellyfish are huge, up to 6 1/2 feet long and can weigh up to 450 pounds. 2009 image by Hiroshima University."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"H uge jelly fish are filling nets and stinging valuable fish, destroying Japanese fishermen's catches in northw est Japan's Wakasa Bay. One traw ler in early November 2009, the Diasan Shinsho-maru, sunk off an eastern Japan coast as the crew was trying to raise up a net full of many Nomura's jellyfish. 2009 image by Hiroshima University. Large Nomura's jellyfish like warm ocean waters. The Yellow Sea between China, Japan and North and South Korea has warmed 3 degrees F. (1.7 degrees C) in only the past 25 years. Until this decade, the big, heavy creatures showed up in Japanese waters only every 40 years or so. Now, warming oceans are allowing at least 2,000 jellyfish species to go further north in latitudes, including the eerie, orange Nomuras that can weigh up to 450 pounds each. Since 2002, as many as 500 million jellyfish have entered Japan's Wakasa Bay. Normal fish catches have gone down by 30 percent or more as the big and stinging Nomura's have loaded down fish nets instead of desired mackerels and sea bass. Nomura jelly fish expert, Shin-ichi Uye, Ph.D., Professor of Biological Oceanography, at Hiroshima University says, “The jellyfish are becoming more and more dominant. Their growth rates are quite amazing.” If oceans continue in their warming trend, there will be more Nomuras and other jelly fish interfering in northern latitude fishing waters.
