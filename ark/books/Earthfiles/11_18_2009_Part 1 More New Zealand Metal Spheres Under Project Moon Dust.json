Timeline of Metal Spheres Discovered South of Ashburton, New Zealand: 1) 4 similar-sized titanium alloy balls 15 inches in diameter landed on John Lindores farm about 10 miles south of Ashburton on April 3, 1972. Soviets denied metal balls were remnants of Venus-bound spacecraft later renamed Cosmos 482. But New Zealand authorities said Cyrillic Russian writing was found, even though never photographed. 2) 2 other smaller titanium alloy balls, a larger piece of spacecraft and a cylindrical structure were also found by other residents April 3, 1972, a little further south of Ashburton.

November 18, 2009 Albuquerque, New Mexico - On March 31, 1972, the Soviet Union launched a Venus 9 spacecraft later renamed Cosmos 482 with the goal of making a Venus trajectory for exploration. But four days later on April 3, 1972, the Venus 9 failed as it tried to move into the planned Venus trajectory. At 1 AM on April 3, 1972, a farmer named John Lindores of Ashburton, New Zealand, reported that four red-hot, metallic balls about 38 centimeters in diameter (15 inches) landed on his farm near Ashburton. Two smaller spheres, a larger spacecraft piece and cylindrical structure were found further south of John Lindores farm by other residents. In 2002, declassified New Zealand government files contained correspondence from Sir Keith Holyoake, New Zealand's Foreign Affairs Minister in 1972, who wrote that the spheres were “probably gas pressure vessels of a kind used in the launching rocket.” But the Soviets denied the New Zealand space debris was theirs and the Americans did not have any craft with a re-entry path that would have gone over New Zealand.

It was turned over to the New Zealand police who in turn delivered it to the National Radiation Laboratory in Christchurch for a radioactive check (negative finding). The object has now been delivered to the DSIR (New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial Research) for detailed examination and analysis. “On November 5, 1978, a second ‘space ball’ was found by DSIE (Defense Security Information Exchange). R. O. believes that a U. S. techncal team would be welcome to examine the objects, although their R. O. has not discussed that possibility with any New Zealand authorities.” Included in the Defense Intelligence Agency's Moon Dust message was the following comment from the Embassy Scientific attache: “The two spherical space objects and other apparent space debris, which were f ound in April 1972, were located in virtually the same area south of Ashburton. (The two 1972 impact areas were approximately 10.5 miles apart. The apparent 1978 impact area is about 5 miles south of both the previous 1972 impact areas, forming a triangular pattern.) “The statistical likelihood of two separate spacecraft decaying in a way, which caused them to impact in virtually the same spot on the globe was considered to be so small as to make the 1978 objects suspect. The suspicion was reinforced by advice from Lt. John Baker-Nunn Tracking Station that they had not been alerted to space craft decay during the October 23 to 24 period. “The Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR)'s advice to the science officer November 3, 1978, that the sphere was a silicon-aluminum alloy with a melting point of less than ??? degrees caused doubt that a space object with such a low melting point could survive re-entry in such a surprisingly complete condition, even if shielded (There are no evidences of shielding other than the magnetic spattering.) “The discovery of the second sphere on November 5, 1978, however, seems to increase the likelihood that the objects are indeed space fragments and, because the alfalfa field had been worked earlier this year, it would seem to eliminate the possibility that the spheres were connected with the 1972 findings. “Also, from the observation of the first ball, it was too clean inside and out to have been laying about since 1972, or even for several months. (The New Zealand police say they did not clean the ball.) The interior of the ball is covered in a fine, light brown dust, which has not yet been analyzed. Through the holes in the sphere, the equatorial weld can be ovserved, and it is apparent the weld was external only. The weld bead did not penetrate the joint, and a fairly wide reach between the two hemispheres is observable. DSIR will continue to cooperate with full analysis information.

COMMENT: BLACKED OUT THE FOLLOWING COMMENT FROM THE EMBASSY SCIENTIFIC ATTACHE IS OFFERED: QUOTE THE TWO SPHERICAL SPACE OBJECTS AND OTHER APPARENT SPACE DEBRIS WHICH WERE FOUND IN APRIL 1972 WERE LOCATED IN VIRTUALLY THE SAME AREA SOUTH OF ASHBURTON. (THE TWO 1972 IMPACT AREAS WERE APPROXIMATELY TEN AND ONE-HALF MILES APART. THE APPARENT 1978 IMPACT AREA IS ABOUT FIVE MILES SOUTH OF BOTH, FORMING A TRIANGULAR PATTERN). THE STATISTICAL LIKELIHOOD OF TWO SEPARATE SPACECRAFT DECAYING IN A WAY WHICH CAUSED THEM TO IMPACT IN VIRTUALLY THE SAME SPOT ON THE GLOBE WAS CONSIDERED TO BE SO SMALL AS TO MAKE THE 1978 OBJECTS SUSP ECT. THIS SUSP ICION WAS REINFORCED BY ADVICE FROM MT. JOHN BAKER-NUNN TRACKING STATION THAT THEY HAD NOT BEEN ALERTED TO SPACE CRAFT DECAY DURING THE OCTOBER 23-24 PERIOD. DSIR’S ADVICE TO THE SCIENCE OFFICER NOVEMBER 3 THAT THE SP HERE WAS A SILICON-ALUMINUM ALLOY WITH A MELTING POINT OF LESS THAN ??? DEGREES CAUSED DOUBT THAT A SPACE OBJECT WITH SUCH A LOW MELTING P OINT COULD SURVIVE RE-ENTRY IN SUCH A SURPRISINGLY COMPLETE CONDITION, EVEN IF SHIELDED. (THERE ARE NO EVIDENCES OF SHIELDING OTHER THAN THE MAGNETIC SPATTERING.) THE DISCOVERY OF THE SECOND SPHERE ON NOVEMBER 5, HOWEVER, SEEMS TO INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE OBJECTS ARE INDEED SPACE FRAGMENTS AND, BECAUSE THE ALFALFA FIELD HAD BEEN WORKED EARLIER THIS YEAR, IT WOULD SEEM TO ELIMINATE THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SPHERES WERE CONNECTED WITH THE 1972 FINDINGS. ALSO, FROM THE OBSERVATION OF THE FIRST BALL, IT WAS TOO CLEAN INSIDE AND OUT TO HAVE BEEN LAYING ABOUT SINCE 1972 OR EVEN FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. (THE NZ POLICE SAY THEY DID NOT CLEAN THE BALL.) THE INTERIOR OF THE BALL IS COVERED IN A FINE, LIGHT BROWN DUST WHICH HAS NOT YET BEEN ANALYZED. THROUGH THE HOLES IN THE SPHERE, THE EQUATORIAL WELD CAN BE OBSERVED, AND IT IS APPARENT THE WELD WAS EXTERNAL ONLY. THE WELD BEAD DID NOT PENETRATE THE JOINT, AND A FAIRLY WIDE REACH BETWEEN THE TWO HEMISPHERES IS OBSERVABLE. DSIR WILL CONTINUE TO COOPERATE WITH FULL ANALYSIS INFOR- PAGE 2  BLACKED OUT  ??111?1?
