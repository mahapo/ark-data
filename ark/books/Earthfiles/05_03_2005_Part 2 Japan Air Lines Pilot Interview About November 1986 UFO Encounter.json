To the far left , the long yellow line is the boundary betw een Canada and America's Alaska. Fairbanks is the upper horizontal line and Anchorage is the lower yellow line near the Gulf of Alaska. Anchorage is the home of the U. S. Army's Ft. Richardson and the US Air Force's Elmendorf AFB. Return to Part 1 May 3, 2005 - Thurmont, Maryland - The following transcript is from an interview conducted in January 1987 by the U. S. Federal Aviation Administration Chief Investigator, John Callahan, with Japan Air Lines Pilot, Kenju Terauchi, about his JAL Flight 1628 encounter with a massive UFO on November 16, 1986. The transcript was provided to Earthfiles by U. S. Navy Research Physicist, Bruce Maccabee, Ph.D., after Dr. Maccabee obtained the case file records from the CIA. Transcript of Interview with JAL Pilot, Kenju Terauchi “Once upon a time if a hunter saw a TV, how would he describe it to other people? My experience was similar to that. The north of Alaska in mid-November you cannot even see the sun. The darkness continues until the middle of March. JAL Flight 1628, a B747 jumbo cargo plane, encountered two spaceships and a 'Mother Ship' about 50 minutes above Alaska. There was no danger, but it created many questions that a human being cannot answer. So, I am writing that experience down here. ...This special flight was to import special French wine from Iceland to Anchorage for approximately a 6 hour and 20 minute flight. It is an extremely short flight compared to most flights. It takes about two-thirds normal flight hours. There are only two landings at Keflavik International Airport in Reykjavik, Iceland. This particular flight was planned to stop at Iceland and increase cargo items, rather than flying directly from Paris to Anchorage. However, since being wintertime, if the condition of the runway was poor, we might have to reduce the cargo. Therefore, everyone was paying special attention to the amount of cargo. The temperature of Keflavik Airport in November is approximately maximum of 3 degrees C. and the lowest was minus 3 degree C. Six of us Japan Air Lines employees arrived at Keflavik Airport at midnight and three people welcomed us as usual. We headed on to a new hotel. ... We stayed only about 17 hours. The weather became good and the runway was not frozen and we left Keflavik Airport at 20:42. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":" We took a flight course southeast of Greenland direct to Thule USAF Base, Thule, Greenland, by crossing the great icy highland mid west of Greenland. The flight above Greenland, under a nearly full moon which was rising on the right front side of our aircraft, helped visibility for the night flight. The flight was smooth, despite the unstable air current that shook the plane for about two hours. But still, it was a rather stressless flight as compared to a passenger flight. We aimed towards Single Point on the north coast of Canada, passing through the Canadian north polar regions and down southwest along an Arctic flight course. It was 4:25 p.m. Alaska time when we reported our location to Edmonton Center from above Single Point, Canada (68 degrees 55 minutes North Latitude; 137 degrees 15 minutes West Longitude). It had become pitch dark, perhaps because the moon was directly behind us near the horizon. We received an order from Edmonton Center that we should contact the Anchorage Center when we reached where Alaska Territorial Air begins. That location is approximately 480 miles (890 kilometers) north-northeast of Anchorage at 67 degrees, 56 minutes North Latitude and 141 degrees West Longitude. [ Editor's Note: Not far from Ammerman Mountain, Alaska.] We began the communication with the Anchorage Center about 5:05 p.m. The flight course we had acknowledged was Jet 529, direct to Ft. Yukon, and Jet 125 via Nenana, Talkeetna, and to Anchorage. JAL Pilot Terauchi's flight path from Ammerman Mountain area near Canada/Alaska border southwest past Fairbanks, Nenana, Talkeetna to Anchorage. The Anchorage Center ordered us to fly direct to Talkeetna, provided us transponder codes and placed us on a radar scope at the same time. The strange phenomenon happened immediately after we began left rotation, following the order of taking the direct flight course. There was an unidentifiable light ahead of the rotation. We set the course toward Talkeetna and began level flight. Then we saw lights that looked like aircraft lights, 30 degrees left front, 2,000 feet (600 meters) below us, moving exactly in the same direction and with the same speed as we were. We were at the altitude of 35,000 feet (10,600 meters), flying speed was 900 kilometers per hour to 910 kilometers per hour. We ignored the lights, thinking probably they were special missioned (USAF) aircraft or two (USAF) fighters, because we did not notice the lights while communication with the Anchorage Center or on prior visual inspection. However, the position of the lights had not changed, even after a few minutes, and that caught our attention. The First Officer called the Anchorage Center and asked to report to us if there were any aircraft other than ours in the area. The Anchorage Center told"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"us that there were no other aircraft in the north area. We immediately reported back that we were seeing aircraft lights. Anchorage again reported that there was no military aircraft, and the ground radar did not show any aircraft but us. Anchorage also asked us several times if there were clouds near our altitude. We saw thin and spotty clouds near the mountain below us, but no clouds in mid-to-upper air. The air current was steady and conditions were quite pleasant. Perhaps the Anchorage controllers were concerned that an increased use of improved laser beams using clouds was creating moving images. We kept observing the lights below us in left front, thinking it was ridiculous to have laser beam testing at the end of a tundra area. Then the two lights began to move in a manner different from ordinary aircraft maneuvers, like two bear cubs playing with each other. We continued the flight south along a straight course since the distance from the lights was far enough from us and their movement was not extreme and we felt no immediate danger. I thought perhaps it is one of those things called 'UFO' and to take a photo might help to identify the object later. I asked to bring forward my camera bag that was placed in the rear of the cockpit and began to take a picture. The area in which the plane was flying was unchanged, but the lights were still moving strangely. I had ASA 100 film in my camera, mainly to take scenery, and had auto-focus on. I aimed at the object, but the lens kept adjusting and I never could set a focus. I changed auto-focus to manual-focus and pressed the shutter. But this time, the shutter would not close. Then our aircraft started to vibrate and I gave up taking a photo. I placed my camera back in the camera bag and concentrated on observing the lights. It was about seven or so minutes since we began paying attention to the lights, most unexpectedly two spaceships stopped in front of our face, shooting off lights. The inside cockpit shined brightly and I felt warm in the face. Perhaps firing of jets was the result to kill inertia of their quick high speed maneuver, but the ships appeared as if they were stopped in one place in front of us.” C ontinued in Part 3 - Massive Walnut-Shaped Object More Information: F or further information about the worldwide UFO phenomena, please see Earthfiles Archive (partial list below) and my books, An Alien Harvest and the 2-volume Glimpses of Other Realities in the Earthfiles Shop. · 04/28/2005 -- Dozens of Unidentified Aerial Objects Videotaped Over Sonora, California · 04/17/2005 -- 1949 Aerial Disc Covered-Up By Project Blue Book As \"Kite\" · 04/14/2005 -- \"Battle of Los Angeles,\" February 25, 1942 · 04/13/2005 -- Highly Strange Dog Death in Arkansas; 2000-Pound Bull Dropped On Log Pile · 03/08/2005 -- Flying Disc Paced Airliner Over Puget Sound Navy Yard · 02/21/2005 -- Update d - Bull and Cow Mutilations Northwe st of Corpus Christi, Te xas · 01/15/2005 -- Bull and Cow Mutilations Northwe st of Corpus Christi, Te xas · 12/10/2004 -- Part 3: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation? · 12/10/2004 -- Part 4: \"Peculiar Phenomena,\" V-2 Rockets - and UFOB Retaliation? · 10/29/2004 -- Part 2: Update On Shag Harbour, Nova Scotia, UFO Case. · 09/06/2004 -- Part 1: Terry Sherman - 1996 Interview About High Strangeness on Fort Duche sne , Utah Ranch · 09/06/2004 -- Part 2: Terry Sherman - 1996 Interview About High Strangeness on Fort Duchesne, Utah Ranch · 08/29/2004 -- Another Pictogram in Poland · 08/09/2004 -- Pictograms in Poland · 07/07/2004 -- Fourth 2004 Crop Formation in Poland Has Multiple Parts · 06/17/2004 -- More 2004 Holland and Poland Crop Formations · 06/03/2004 -- Updated - Second 2004 Pictogram Crop Formation in Poland · 05/19/2004 -- Why Ball Lightning Does Not Explain Facts in Mexico Air Force Infrared and Radar Eve nt · 05/17/2004 -- Update d - Crop Formation Re porte d in Zabno, Poland · 02/14/2004 -- More High Strange ne ss in the Michigan Sky · 02/06/2004 -- Unidentified Aerial Objects - Again! - Over Michigan · 01/19/2004 -- Earthfiles and Radio Audience Feedback About Anomalous Sky Objects · 01/17/2004 -- High Strangene ss in the Napole on, Michigan Sky · 01/17/2004 -- Update on Horton, Michigan Ice Circle · 01/10/2004 -- Strange Unidentified Aerial Objects in Indiana and Pennsylvania · 10/17/2003 -- 2003 \"UFO Flap\" in Ohio · 04/22/2003 -- UFO Expe rie nce s Re porte d by Fore st Fire Lookouts · 02/01/2003 -- Six Unidentified Triangular Aerial Craft Over Uinta Mountains, Utah · 01/14/2003 -- Part 2: Cape Girardeau and Charlette Mann's 1991 Letter About Her G randfathe r's Expe rie nce"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"· 11/03/2002 -- Strange Light Triggered Magnetic Alarm and Was Photographed in Montre al, Canada · 04/17/2002 -- Part 2 - Unidentified Aerial Craft Over Farmington and Aztec, New Mexico in Spring 1949 · 03/16/2002 -- Part 1 - 'Huge Saucer Armada' Shocked Farmington, New Mexico 52 Ye ars Ago · 01/19/2002 -- Nine Unidentified Aerial Objects Tracked at 8,000 mph on 1952 Radar · 02/06/2000 -- Large Yellow Sphere In Snohomish, Washington · 12/26/1999 -- Hubble Repair, Gamma Ray Bursts and Unidentified Aerial Objects · 12/22/1999 -- Update - Unidentified \"Arrowhead\"-Shaped Object in California Sky · 06/28/1999 -- Anothe r 90-Degre e Ae rial Turn Associate d with Contrail · 04/09/1999 -- Strange Lights In Missouri Websites: JAL 1628 Over Alaska: http://www.ufoevidence.org/cases/case287.htm Physicist Bruce Maccabee JAL Analysis: http://brumac.8k.com/JAL1628/JL1628.html Majestic 12 Documents: http://www.majesticdocuments.com American Presidents: http://www.presidentialufo.com Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
