[ See Earthfiles Shop. ] Ray Boeche, a devout Christian, computer graphics illustrator at the University of Nebraska and long time investigator of the UFO phenomenon, including the baffling events at Bentwaters AFB in England, December 26 - 28, 1980. Ray told me he had been contacted by two men who showed identification from the Department of Defense in Washington, D. C. The two agents wanted to discuss Boeche's research about eschatology, a branch of theology that is concerned with the ultimate or last things such as death, judgment, heaven and hell, or the end of the world as we know it. During their conversation, Ray referenced my book. The two men asked if they could read Glimpses, Vol. I. Boeche called me to explain the situation and to ask if I had any objections to his giving the intelligence agents my book. G limpses of Other Realities, Volume I: Facts and Eyewitnesses © 1994 by Linda Moulton Howe. See Earthfiles Shop. I told him, “Not only give them the book, ask them if they will write in the margins whatever comments they have about what is correct and incorrect. That would be a safe way for them to communicate and for us to learn something. I'll send you a new copy to replace the one you give them.” "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In June 1994, Ray Boeche called again and said I would be getting a package in the mail. He said the contents would be a floppy disc in a sealed envelope handed to him by the two agents. Ray said the men did not want to write in the book, but were replying on the computer disc with comments about the content in my Glimpses of Other Realities, Vol. I. The following is an electronic scan of the original floppy disc printed three pages from the DoD insiders that I call the Writers.

Recorded message, October 18, 1991, on Linda Moulton Howe's phone answering machine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: “(Bob Lazar, Area 51) mentioned that the aliens were hundreds of years ahead in technology. Actually, it would be more like thousands of years. The ships don't have windows as we know windows to be. The craft are smooth and metallic colored. The aliens have no intention of hurting anyone. There will be increased sightings, very, very increased sightings in the future. The blood from the animals that you were talking about is not being used to make things compatible with people as it is being developed for, shall we say, to save the animals against radiation poisoning. The government does not have ships in working order, but does have the remains of some. There was a survivor (alien), but I don't know if that person is still living. The truth of the matter is that if the reason for their visiting the planet were revealed, the public could not handle it.” David Joseph Bohm (1917-1992), Ph.D., quantum physicist and author, Wholeness and the Implicate Order © 1980.

The writers' insistence that the non-human entities are not extraterrestrials might be understood if the NHEs are past, present, future time travelers or beings from other dimensions or even parallel universes. Those categories might not be considered by government insiders to be biology-from-another-solar-system. Further, beginning in upcoming Part 7, and other reports in this Real X-Files series, I will share some of my research into the list of books included in this first letter from the Writers."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Jacques Vallee, Ph.D., is an astrophysicist and computer scientist who began researching and writing about the UFO phenomenon in the 1960s. He postulated that the intelligences involved have influenced and manipulated human affairs for centuries, often with deception. In his 1988 book, Dimensions, Dr. Vallee wrote: “We are not dealing with successive waves of visitations from space. We are dealing with a control system. ...I cannot tell whether this control is ... artificial in nature, under the power of some superhuman will. It may be entirely determined by laws that we have not yet discovered.” C ontinued in Part 2 - My questions to Writers.
