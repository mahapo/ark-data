Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Mysterious, Buzzing Light in Tehachapi, California Â© 2002 by Linda Moulton Howe Tehachapi, California, the residence of Neil Browning since 1991, about 50 miles from Edward AFB. In that Mojave Desert and Tehachapi Mountains region, many people have reported hearing strange underground sounds, seeing unidentified triangles and other aerial craft, and even non-human entities. Rumors have long persisted that the area has underground installations, but no one specifies who operates them. July 23, 2002 Tehachapi, California Last week I received an e-mail from 41-year-old Neil Browning of Tehachapi, California. Neil worked his entire U.S. Air Force career as a mechanic on airplanes until he retired as an E-7 in 1999. Then he took a position with the USAF Civil Service at Edwards AFB as an F-16 fighter aircraft crew chief. Neil Browning has lived in the same house in Tehachapi that he purchased in 1991. Between 1995 to 1999 he was on assignment in Korea and Luke AFB, Arizona and rented the house until he retired and moved back in full time. Neil Browning's house in Tehachapi, California west of Edwards Air Force Base where he works as an F-16 crew chief. His car is parked in front of the garage where the buzzing light encounter took place around 12:15 a.m. PDT on July 11, 2002. At the right beyond the fence is the trailer that Neil retreated to in fear after the encounter with the light in the garage. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Photograph taken on July 23, 2002 by Neil Browning. In the beginning of July 2002, Neil began to hear a sound \"like a rhythmic refrigerator\" throughout his house. By the night of July 10-11, the refrigerator sound was joined by a \"buzzing mosquito\" sound which Neil Browning could hear in both ears when he laid down in bed at 7:30 p.m., knowing he had to be up at 3:30 a.m. His work day at Edwards AFB began at 5:30 a.m. on July 11. Here is his July 15 e-mail to me, followed by an interview about the mysterious light he encountered that haunts him to this day. E-mail July 15, 2002 from Neil Browning: \"For some reason I just was not sleepy, but tried my best because I had to get up at 0330 to get ready for work (it's a one-hour drive out to Edwards). All I did was toss and turn. For around two weeks now I have noticed a slight rumbling noise inside my house. It sounds like a refrigerator noise, only quieter. This noise was bothering me so much this night that I decided to investigate it. At approximately 0015 hours (fifteen minutes after midnight) on 11 July 2002, I was still wide awake in the dark with this noise bothering me. Then all of the sudden I hear what seems to be a mosquito buzzing around my head. I attempted swatting at it in the dark a few times with no luck at chasing it away. I then turned on the lamp next to the bed. I could still hear the mosquito, but could not see it. I decided anyway to get up and search out this refrigerator sound to find out what it was once and for all. This noise bothered me because I knew nothing at all was on in the house that could make this noise no fans, nothing. I began to walk from room to room very quietly while listening. No matter where I went I could still hear the same rumble at the same intensity from both ears, and oddly, the mosquito sound. After passing the living room, I got to the kitchen and put my ear against the refrigerator. It was in its off cycle and was making no noise. I then walked from the kitchen to my small laundry room and opened the door. Both sounds are still with me, no louder or quieter. I walked up to the garage entry door just 4 feet further to investigate the garage. I opened the door (pushing it into the garage) slowly because I knew my cat was out there and would want to come in. (I should have mentioned earlier that the only lights on in the house are the lamp at my bed and one 7 watt bulb in the living room that is never turned off.) Intense Bright Light I pushed the door out approximately 90 degrees into total darkness. Then all of the sudden, a very intense bright light formed about four feet in front of me and about four feet off the ground. I was paralyzed for a few seconds, probably out of fear. I screamed at the top of my lungs and slammed the door shut holding the knob as tight as I could. I could hear nothing from behind the door. After about 10 seconds, I felt I had to do something to defend myself so I ran and got a firearm then returned just outside the laundry room. I aimed it at the garage door and yelled several times 'identify yourself, I have a firearm.' Scared shitless, I ran around the house and turned as many lights on as I could. I had to know what was in that garage but would not attempt the laundry room entrance again because I could not turn on"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"the lights from that doorway (the builder forget to put a switch there). I then ran back to the bedroom to put some cloths on (I was in my underwear) so I could go outside and attack it from the door going from the outside to the inside of the garage. At least there was a light switch just inside the door. After getting dressed I ran outside, firearm in hand like an idiot, and proceeded to the outside door. It was locked as I expected it would be because I brought the keys with me. I unlocked the door and slowly opened it. I could see no light. I reached up and turned on the lights while kicking the door wide open and aiming the pistol where I saw the light from the laundry room entrance. Nothing, except the cat came running out. I slowly walked into the garage and all around, nothing. I was so shaken up that I did not notice if the rumble was still there, but I damn sure noticed the mosquito sound was gone. That noise had to come from whatever was in that garage. It was now approximately 0025 hours. I was so shaken up that I had to talk to a living, breathing person. So I went to my neighbor's house and woke them up. They could tell that I had been seriously traumatized and invited me in. I explained to them what had happened. These are good friends of mine and we have talked about UFOs in the past. We all believe they are there, but have never seen one. I can't put this in that category, but I can sure say it ain't from around here. I spent about an hour in their home and returned to mine to lock it up. I locked it and moved into my motor home for the rest of the night. I did not sleep the rest of the night. At 0330 hours I returned to the house, got ready for work and went. Sunburned Body When I got home and took my shirt off, I noticed my chest was bright red as if I had been out in the sun to get a tan. I figured it came from whatever was in that garage. I figured if that's the worst that happened I got off pretty good. Until 14 July 02, when I was taking my same trusted neighbors through the garage for about the third time since it happened and one of them mentioned radiation. At that time I remember I had a radiation meter sitting on my toolbox. It was issued to me from the Air Force to wear when my aircraft was being x-rayed (several years ago. The Air Force don't use these now.) I remembered it because I was playing with it the week before. At that time, if I remember correctly it was reading about 20 Roentgens. It now reads 190 Roentgens. Something happened in that garage that I would sure like to know about. I did not sleep for over 48 hours after that, never got tired and have yet to sleep in the house. I am slowly getting back to normal, but that sure scared the ... out of me. That rumbling sound is still here. Since this happened I have also noticed it in the neighbors homes as well. Today I took a mechanics stethoscope (it has a large prod instead of a cup) and shoved it in the ground in several places. I can hear that same rumbling noise every where I shoved it in the ground. I have not heard the mosquito sound since then. I had deadbolts installed in my house today for my peace of mind only. I want to get back to my bed. However, I do know that"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"whatever was in my garage that morning could go wherever it wants. Neil G. Browning\" Neil Browning, 41-years-old, retired USAF and now F-16 crew chief in the U. S. Air Force Civil Service at Edwards AFB, California. Photograph provided by Neil Browning. Interview: Please go over again in more detail what happened from the laundry room into the garage. I was still hearing the buzzing sound and the rumbling (refrigerator) sound. And I opened the door to the garage. The thing is, I was looking down because usually the cat runs right in. I recall it was pitch black when I opened the door and stepped through. I don't see the cat and I look up and just basically out of nowhere is where this light formed. It was about four feet away from me and about 4.5 feet up in the air pretty much straight ahead and turned an intense bright light. What color? Bright white. It was round and basically I freaked out. You're looking at it in your mind's eye now and you are seeing a bright, white light. When you say it started to form in the darkness, what was the v e ry first thing you saw and what was the proportion in size in relationship to the garage? The first thing I saw, it started out real dim. As I looked up, it might already have had some light to it, but it wasn't enough to light anything in the garage. Was the shape round right from the beginning? It was kind of crescent shaped, kind of like a half moon if I remember right. First appearance in the dark garage was a dim, white crescent"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"about six inches long. Drawing on July 23, 2002 by Neil Browning. The half moon is glowing a dim white light? Right, a dim white as my eyes come up to focus on it. What is the orientation of the half moon? Is the round part facing toward the garage ceiling or what? It was facing the 10 o'clock position. So, the round part is neither straight up or down. It's like on an angle. Yes, on an angle. The crescent would be how large? I would say it was probably four to six inches long. Very small? Yes. It was not very big when it first started. What happens as it progresses? It almost instantly from that point as I stared right at it, in no time at all - it almost instantly turned the size of a little smaller than a basketball and just intense bright, white light. The crescent-shaped glow instantly \"grew\" into a round, intensely bright white light that did not move. Drawing on July 23, 2002 by Neil Browning. Is it at this point a full complete circle and no longer a half moon? That's right. No crescent then. And it did not move at all. There was no movement whatsoever to it. When we think of a light on the earth, we think of it casting shadows and light beams coming off. Was this like a solid white circle that was not casting shadows? It was definitely not casting shadows. I thought that was kind of strange. It was not casting any shadows at all. Yet to your eyes and mind, it was extremely bright? Ye s . In that brightness, could you see details in the garage?"},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"I don't remember, but by that time my heart was pumping so much! As soon as I saw that, I slammed the garage door shut. Before you did that, were you aware of the rumbling and the mosquito buzzing sound in association with the light? I did not think about it at the time, but it had to be. As I approached the garage door initially, it still did not sound any louder than it was anywhere else in the house. When you opened the door? I could still hear the rumbling and mosquito sound as I opened the door, yes. It did not seem to be louder when you opened the door? No, not at all. What happened next? I slammed the garage door shut and held the door shut with my hands. In my panic, I realized I had never had to lock it from the inside before. I didn't even lock it. I just held the door closed no knowing what the heck it was. When I slammed the door closed, I was back in the darkness of the laundry room and I don't recall seeing any light coming from any corners of the door, but that door is also sealed. It's got weather stripping all the way around it. You never saw any motion between that crescent and the full circle? It was as if it grew in one place? Or it jumped from the crescent to the large full basketball-size in an instant? That's exactly what happened. In almost an instant. You could almost see it growing, but it happened so fast. It was almost like a flash on a camera. But I can recall seeing it grow from the crescent into the bright white light. You would compare the brightness of the light with the flash of a camera? Yes. That's about the intensity because it blinded me. Yet, it did not cast shadows? Not that I can remember. I don't remember any. At that time, I was staring right at it. When you were staring right at it, did you get any impression in your mind of any images, thoughts or anything? No, not at all. So, you've closed the door, you're in the house, you're very scared. What happens next? After that, I probably held the door for maybe ten seconds. Then I realized if this thing is going to try to kill me, I'm pretty much defenseless. I'm holding the knob as tight as I can. By then, I don't recall hearing anything, not the buzzing sound or the refrigerator rumbling. So I held the door as tight as I could and I did not hear anything out there. So I ran and got a firearm from the bedroom. I ran around and turned on as many lights in the house as I could. Put some clothes on and then I ran outside. The one thing about my house is when the contractor built it, he didn't put a switch right outside the doorway to turn lights on in the garage. You have no way to turn the lights on. To turn the light on, you would have to walk about ten feet into the garage and turn them on from the exit going outside. So what I did, and I assumed that door was still locked. At that time I did not suspect there was a burglar. It was just too strange and when you saw the light, there was no people associated with it. So I grabbed the keys, ran outside and"},{"pageNumber":7,"pageContent":"opened that side door to the garage and when I opened it up, I turned the lights on and swung the door open. The first thing that came out was the cat. So, the cat was definitely affected by this, too. He came screaming out of there! I turn the lights on, swing the door wide open and there was nothing in there. No lights. There was no smell. When I talked to my neighbors, they asked if I smelled any ozone or anything like that. There was no odors or anything associated afterward. What about the sunburn on the front of your body? It was the next day - after that, I went over to my neighbors around 12:30 a.m. I went to see them about what happened and I stayed over there for about an hour. Came home, locked it up and then stayed in the motor home that night and for several nights afterward. What do you think you were so afraid of? I don't know. I had the firearm with me, but I knew at the same time that firearm was useless. Whatever got in that garage - firearms aren't going to doing anything to it. It was peace of mind for me because I felt defenseless if this thing decided to do anything. I think what scared me the most is how much it threw me off. It was so unexpected. If I had heard a noise or anything else in the garage except for that buzzing sound - it was the same decibels everywhere I went. Other than that mosquito sound that night, I had been hearing the rumbling 'refrigerator' sound for two weeks. So this was something so incomprehensible to your mind being able to understand it that it scared you at some primal level? Big time! It threw me so far out of left field, it really shook me up. You slept in a trailer not going back into the house for about four nights. Then what happened? The interesting thing is that the next day after that happened, I got up. I didn't sleep for two days, but when I came home after that happened, I took a shower and went to work. got off at my normal time. When I got home, I usually take another shower because we work out in the desert and sweat all day. I undressed and looking in the mirror and I'm sunburned. That really surprised me. Now, I'm really wondering what happened in the garage because my chest was sunburned! But I hadn't been in the sun. Was there a pattern to the sunburn, waist to shoulders, or? Right, waist to shoulders and from the underwear line on the legs down. Your legs were burned as well? Right. In other words, the entire front of your body was red? Yes, everything that was facing that light was a bright red. And I'm thinking that means something was obviously there. And it was a couple of days later that I had the neighbors over several times and explained what happened and where it happened and he got on the subject of radiation. And he goes, 'I wonder if that thing emitted any radiation?' It dawned on me that just the week before, I had found a meter in my toolbox that measures Roentgens. I brought it out and played with it. It's shaped kind of like a cigar and you hold the meter up to the light and look through it. It's got a meter in there that goes from zero to 200. And it says Roentgens on it. What we used that for in the Air Force is we would take that with us when our aircraft went to the nondestructive inspection (NDI) facility to be x-rayed for cracks. We would take that instrument with us and after we were done assisting with the x-rays, they would read that to see if we were over-exposed from taking the x-ray pictures. The last I saw that meter, it was at 20 Roentgens which was"},{"pageNumber":8,"pageContent":"maybe a week and a half before this happened. And it was in the garage sitting on top of the toolbox. When my neighbors mentioned that, I remembered I had the gauge there and I held it up to the light and the thing was reading about 190 Roentgens. Something like that. And it only goes to 200, the gauge. Something exposed that instrument to radiation and you combine that with the fact that the whole front of your body was red. It suggests that you were exposed to something and I wonder if you have gone to a doctor to check for radiation symptoms? No, I haven't felt anything and I was not going to walk into my doctor and explain this. I don't know how open minded he would be. He would probably ask me what I drank that night. How long did the red last on your body? About three or four days before it returned back to normal, fading gradually. Did it ever feel like a painful sunburn? No, it felt warm right after it happened. And all that day it felt like a sunburn. Since then - we're now at July 23 as we are speaking - has anything else unusual happened? No, nothing. That was the only thing. Are you back in your bedroom sleeping? Yes. I finally got back. I did some peace of mind stuff that doesn't really mean anything. I put some deadbolts on the house. Tehachapi is a real quiet, small town, and most people don't have deadbolts. But I had a locksmith come in and install deadbolts and after that, I felt comfortable enough to sleep in the house. But I know at the same time that whatever this was can go wherever it wants. Why? Because the way it was in the garage. The garage do or was broke, the main roll-up door. At the time it was broken and could not possibly be opened from either inside or outside.\" After that happened and I calmed down that night, I could still hear that rumbling 'refrigerator' noise - it was still there when I came back in the house. I listened for that. But I've never heard that mosquito noise since. Is the rumbling refrigerator noise there today? I heard it several days afterward, but the wind is blowing now and you can't hear it because it is very low decibel. Did your neighbors hear any of the sounds? Yes, I did. I brought them into my house and both said they could hear it. In fact, I invited them over two days ago when we had a big storm and the power went out. I invited them over for a barbecue. I had already told them about the noise. So, the power was out and they came in the house and I asked them to listen and they could all hear it. There were three of them, all listening and said, 'Yeah, it kind of sounds like a refrigerator.' But power was out, nothing was running in my house. So, they could hear that, but they haven't heard the mosquito noise. That was only three days ago? Ye s . What about in their houses?"},{"pageNumber":9,"pageContent":"Yes, I have noticed when I go into their house, I can hear it also. When I point it out to them, then they realize it is there. It's several neighbors, not just the ones next door. People across the street and some that are up to a half mile away. Have you talked about this with anyone in authority at Edwards AFB? No, I wouldn't even know who report it to. Have you recorded the noise on tape? No, I haven't tried yet, but I ought to. One thing I did do was take a mechanics stethoscope. It looks like a doctor's stethoscope, only it's got a rod on it instead of a little cup or whatever. I took it out a day or two after the thing was in the garage. I could still hear the rumbling noise in the house and wanted to know if it was associated with the house only. So I went out and stuck the stethoscope all over my yard, front and back, shove this thing in the ground and I could hear that thing. Same exact noise. So it seems like it is something that could be recorded. That suggests there might be something underground. Yeah, but why wouldn't I have heard it before now. I never heard these sounds back in 1991 when I first got the house. You only became aware of the unusual sound in July 2002? Right. If it had been there before, I would have known it.\" More Information: I would like to know if anyone else has had a similar experience in the Tehachapi region, or in any other part of the United States or world.
