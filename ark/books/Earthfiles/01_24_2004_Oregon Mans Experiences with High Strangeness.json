Share: Digg Facebook StumbleUpon Â© 2004 by Linda Moulton Howe Milwaukee, Oregon south of Portland was location of November 2003 sighting by Michael McNeil. January 24, 2004 Milwaukee, Oregon - 2004 has begun with some spectacular sightings of unidentified sky objects over the Napoleon, Michigan, region not far from where an unusually large ice circle was found in D ecember. See: Earthfiles 011604. The more I investigated the ice circle, the more I learned from local residents about mysterious lights and unidentified flying objects haunting the area for years. In my recent Earthfiles.com, Dreamland and Coast to Coast AM radio news reports, I have presented some of those eyewitnesses. This week, I received an e-mail from a businessman named Michael McNeil who has lived in the state of Oregon all his life, most recently near Portland. His e-mail contained descriptions of unusual flying objects that he, friends and his family had seen over the years, including a large \"triangle of stars\" slowly moving overhead that many other people have described since at least the 1970s. He included a phone number and invited me to call if I had any questions about his e-mail. I did call him and asked if I could record his experiences on-the-record for Earthfiles.com and Dreamland. He began with his most recent sighting three months ago in November 2003. But to my surprise as has happened in other interviews over the years with normal citizens who have seen strange objects in the sky the recall lead to even more startling memories of a close-up encounter with non-human entities.

Michael McNeil, Owner, Northwest Pen Works, Milwaukee, Oregon: \"It was a day in November 2003 and I noticed something that moved in my line of sight over the roof of the neighbor's hou se. At first, I thought it was a Mylar balloon. I kept watching it. It moved oddly, like it was wobbling, like a child's top. Then I noticed underneath that it had a brownish or maybe tarnished cooper colored \"dome\" in the center of it that was about 1/3rd of the diameter of the whole craft. It was basically like a disk-shape, but the edges were rounded. The rest of the craft was silver colored. This thing was moving against the prevailing winds. The winds were blowing west to east and this thing was moving from south to north towards me. It dawned on me that it wasn't a balloon and that it was larger, plus it had this dome protrusion on the bottom of it. So, I ran in the house to get a pair of binoculars and was probably in the house not more than 15 to 20 seconds and ran b ack out to the same spot and this thing was gone, like it had disappeared, only I wasn't there to see it. HAVE YOU SEEN ANY SMALL DISK CRAFT LIKE THIS BEFORE? Yes, one night, I saw a craft. Actually I was with my mother and sister. It was when I was going to college, so it must have been on Thanksgiving evening in 1979 or 1980. I looked and I saw something. I could see it through the trees and it was over the top of them. And I said, 'Wow, that looks like a UFO!' I asked my sister to stop the car and my mother said , 'That does look like a UFO. Stop the car!' So she did and pulled off to the side of the road and turned the engine off and this thing made no sound. It had large windows around it that we re I don't know how big they were exactly. It was probably 200 to 300 yards out over the large open field. The windows were like the proportions of a 4 x 8-foot sheet of plywood, but with rounded corners. I think the windows might have been a little larger than that. The light that came out of these windows was very intense, but it was the color of tungsten lighting as you would see fr om outside the house at night kind of a slight yellowish-orangish color. I was trying to see through the windows to see if I could see any humanoids inside this th ing. It was kind of a hat box-shape on top, circular, with flat sides where the windows were and then it tapered down from there and I couldn't see the underneath side of the craft, but it appeared to be flat. It paralleled the Southern Pacific railro ad tracks for a little ways, maybe like 1/8th of a mile, and then it crossed over the highway and followed the highway right over the top of it. We probably wa tched it for about 4 or 5 minutes and it headed right over the top of a small littl e town. Then we got back in the car and drove on. DID ANY OF YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU THOUGHT IT WAS AND WHERE IT HAD COME FROM? Yes, we did. I guess we just assumed that it was extraterrestrial because the U. S. government, as far as I know, doesn't have anything remotely similar to it."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"IF IT WERE EXTRATERRESTRIAL THAT BIG, THAT CLOSE, WHAT DID YOU THINK THE IMPLICATION WAS? I've always thought they were surveying the planet or something. I don't understand what. WHEN YOU SAY THAT, IS THAT BASED ON SOME PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH SOMETHING THAT YOU CONSIDER TO BE NON-HUMAN? I had contact when I was probably about 11 years old. One night I was lying in bed in my folk's house and I wasn't asleep and I felt like there was something in the room. I looked up and looked down at the end of my bed and there was this little guy about 3.5 feet tall standing at the end of the bed. I was scared, but I couldn't yell. I wanted to yell for my fo lks. I felt there was something else and I looked at the other corner at the foot of the bed and there was another one standing there. I was just frightened out of my mind, but I could not speak. I was totally awake. I wanted to scream or yell or something, but it was like my vocal cords would not work or I could not get them to work as hard as I tried. They (entities) moved in an odd fashion. They moved like in jerky motions. It's hard to explain, but they bobbed th eir heads and upper bodies forward in perfect unison as they were coming toward me. One of them started speaking to me in direct mental communication and he was I say 'he' it was trying to quiet me down and told me not to be afraid. They weren't going to harm me and things of that nature. He asked me if I would go with them. I told him I didn't want to go with them. He finally convin ced me to go and said that everything was going to be all right. He lifted the covers off of me and I sat up in bed and walked over towards the door and one was in front of me and one was behind me. And I started to try to walk and they were amused by this because my feet weren't on the floor. It was like my feet were 6 inches or a foot o ff of the floor. We floated out towards the stairway and out through the wall and I looked up and there was a disk up over the back yard of the house. I remember looking down at an apple tree that is right next to the house. We went up into the craft from a beam of light and underneath the craft, I think there were three or four panels that looked like they were almost fluorescent lighting, fluorescent overhead lighting panels. But they were tapered. When we went into the craft, I don't unde rstand how we got in there, other than we went through it somehow.\" Michael McNeil told me the small bein gs who took him from his bedroom had large, black eyes and grey-colored, rough-looking skin. Michael does not remember how he and the beings traveled into the disk-shaped craft through the"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"large, angled panels of bright, white light, but he does remember what happened next. Michael McNeil: \"I was laying on a table and they flashed a bunch of images in my head in rapid succession. It was like something you would see on TV where they flash all these different images of war and Hitler and just all sorts of different things and atomic explosions. I didn't understand it other than it was supposed to be things that would happen in the future of this planet. WHAT YEAR DO YOU THINK THIS INCIDENT WAS? It was probably 1962 and the interesting part of this story is that the next morning, I woke up in bed and sat straight up in bed. I was trying to figure out what had happened. I knew I hadn't been dr eaming and I was trying to sort it all out in my head and I swung my legs o ff the bed and was sitting on the edge of the bed and I looked down at my ri ght foot, kind of in the ankle area. There was blood running down from it and it hurt. I couldn't figure out what was wrong with it. I could feel something sort of in the top of my foot where the ankle joint is. There was a small cut probably about 1/4 inch or 3/16th of an inch long. So, I got dressed and went to school. My ankle hurt all day. When I came home that afternoon, I sterilized my pocketknife with a match or candle and wiped the carbon off the blade and dug around with it in my foot and dug it out. It looked like a thin piece of glass that was an elongated triangle shape and it was probably maybe oh, half an inch long or maybe a little less and it was perfectly clear and flat on each side. I believe it mi ght have been some kind of a crystal. It took me a long time to figure out what it was, but I think it was some sort of tracking device, some way of locating human beings. WHERE IS THAT? Where is it? It's gone. I put the object in a drawer in a table next to my bed and about a week and a half later, I looked for it b ecause I just dropped it along the edge of the drawer. And it was gone. It was like it had disappeared. I don't know if they came and retrieved it while I was asleep or what happened. It wasn't there. WHY DO YOU THINK THEY SHOWED YOU ATOMIC EXPLOSIONS AND SCENES THAT SEEMED TO INVOLVE CATASTROPHE? I think that probably, I know there ha ve been thousands of people who were abducted. I know some of them, they tried to show them what was happening in the future. They tried to show humans that. I think they want us to avoid some things in the future. AND RIGHT NOW, DO YOU HAVE ANY SENSE OF ANYTHING IMPENDING? ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT ANYTHING UPCOMING? No, not more than anyone else, just terrorist attacks, I suppose."},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"SO YOU HAVEN'T HAD ANY RECENT DREAMS IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS ABOUT ANYTHING IMPENDING? No, I haven't. I don't know. The whole thing is odd to me. I can't figure it out. It's like they are doing a survey of the planet , just the way scientists study the forests in Africa or the forests in the U. S. and the animals that live in them. SO, FROM YOUR EXPERIENCE WI TH THOSE CREATURES IN YOUR ROOM THAT SCARED YOU, YOU ST ILL DON'T FEEL THEY MEANT YOU ANY HARM OR THAT THEY DO N'T MEAN ANYBODY ANY HARM? No. I don't think they want to hurt anyone, or at least I mean, that implant they put in my foot - it hurt, but it didn't kill me. AND YOU WERE ABLE TO GET IT OUT SUCCESSFULLY WITHOUT ANY PROBLEM? Right. I think they expected it to stay there and heal over the top of it and probably would have tracked me as long as it was in there.\" Copyright 1992 by Bigelow Holding Corporation, Las Vegas, Nevada. Hearing these unexpected revelations from an Oregon businessman reminded me of the national survey done by the Roper Organization in 1992 about \"Unusual Personal Experiences\" and jointly financed by real estate tycoon Robert Bigelow's The Bigelow Holding Corporation of Las Vegas, Nevada, and one of his colleagues in Europe. Robert Bigelo w is also the founder of the National Institute for Discovery Science (NIDS) in Las Vegas which investigates animal mutilations, human abductions and other physical evidence potentially related to the presence of non-human intelligences on this planet. The report for mental health professionals represented three national surveys of nearly 6,000 adult Americans about the relationship between unusual experiences and what was labeled the \"UFO Abduction Syndrome.\""},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"The Roper report's astonishing conclusion was that, \"The incidence of abduction experiences appears to be on the order of at least 2% of the population.\" In 2004, the American population is 292 milli on.
