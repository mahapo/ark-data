October 13, 2001 Mantario, Saskatchewan, Canada - This weekend I talked with 49-year-old rancher, Bill Francis, in Mantario, Saskatchewan, Canada near the Alberta border and north of Medicine Hat. He has ranched there his whole life and added cattle to his business fifteen years ago. He had heard about animal mutilations where ears, eyes, tongues, jaw flesh, genitals and rectal tissue have been excised from thousands of animals worldwide since the mid-1950s. But until August 16th, he had never seen one on his own property. It started with a sick heifer. That morning he called his vet because she was standing with her head down and eyes closed and wouldn't respond to his voice. The vet suggested that she might be dehydrated and asked Bill Francis to put a tube down her throat and pour about 5 gallons of water every hour for three or four hours. He did that and she never protested or even moved. She just ground her teeth while he pushed the tube down her throat. He left her to fix fence and received a call from a neighbor about another heifer down. Interview: Bill Francis, Rancher, Mantario, Saskatchewan, Canada: \"We went out there and I said to my son, 'What's wrong with these heifers? They are acting really strange.' They had all their heads up in the air and kind of looking off in one direction. We went out to find this heifer. And in the meantime by the water trough, I had to fix a piece of fence. And these other heifers came around us. They were really spooky. They almost ran over us, in fact. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"LIKE THEY WERE TRYING TO RUN AWAY FROM SOMETHING? They were just scared. They weren't trying to run from anything really. They were just milling around and scaring each other even. They were that spooked. And it was odd because we had been feeding them every day for a couple of weeks. So, anyways, we fixed the fence there and then we went over to see the dead one. And I thought, to lose two in one day wasn't very good because I hadn't lost any for months. I thought maybe there was something wrong. And as soon as I drove up to it, I said, 'This thing has been mutilated.' THIS WAS THE SAME HEIFER YOU WERE TRYING TO FORCE FEED THE WATER INTO? No, this was inside the fence. The other one (sick) was outside the fence. YOU'VE GOT A SECOND ONE THAT IS DOWN AND MUTILATED. Ye a h . CAN YOU TELL ME FIRST ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY WAS TAKEN? The lips and tongue and the genitals and uterus and the two front teats. THE TWO FRONT TEATS OF THE UDDER? Ye a h . WERE THEY CUT FLAT TO THE BAG OR CORED INTO THE BAG? Cut flat. In fact when they cut it, they just sliced the skin on the bag and the flap of skin was still hanging there. WAS THERE ANY BLOOD? No blood at all. DID THAT SEEM UNUSUAL TO YOU? Oh, yeah. HOW WOULD YOU CUT TEATS OFF WITHOUT THEIR BEING BLOOD? Yeah, the whole thing was strange. We've butchered lots of animals and there is no, I don't know how you would do it without blood. WHAT ABOUT THE VAGINAL AND RECTAL AREA? The cuts were the same. I call it stepped, kind of. Drawing of the cuts on the mutilated heifer discovered on August 16, 2001 in Mantario, Saskatchewan, Canada. Drawing © 2001 by Bill Francis. THEY WERE GONE? Everything was gone and it was so clean and neat in there. Like the other fellow was trying to tell me it was animals, and I said, 'Well, they could never do a job like that.' It was just like a cylinder had been in there. WAS THERE JUST A CLEAN HOLE ALSO HAD TAKEN OUT THE"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"RECTUM AND THE VAGINA? Yeah, the uterus and all that was gone. A CLEAN HOLE. Ye a h . Bill Francis did not take any photographs, but here is an example of vaginal and rectal tissue removed in deep, bloodless hole from cow found October 14, 1975 near Sterling, Colorado. Udder also removed with a hide-deep scalloped pattern. 1974 Polaroid photograph by Logan County Sheriff Tex Graves. I'VE SEEN MANY PHOTOGRAPHS LIKE THAT BEFORE. ANY BLOOD AT ALL? None. No blood anywhere. THE GROUND WAS DRY? Yeah, bone dry. WAS HER TAIL INTACT? Ye a h . SHE WAS LAYING ON HER SIDE. DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING ELSE UNUSUAL ABOUT HER? I did notice was that her (mutilated heifer) mouth was open. I've done taxidermy for years and I know that any dead animal they bring, the mouth is always closed. So, the vet was at my neighbor's two days later and he asked her, 'When these animals die, do they die with their mouths open or closed?' She said, 'They are always closed.' He said, 'Well, that's odd because this one has its mouth open.' She said that rigor mortis causes them to close and they always close. She said they must have done something to it to keep the mouth open. So I went and checked on it (the dead heifer) and after four days, it started to close. And after about eight days, it was fully closed. HOW FAR OPEN WAS THE MOUTH WHEN YOU FIRST FOUND IT? It was probably four inches. The front teeth were about 4 inches apart. YOU NOW YOU HAVE THIS ANIMAL THAT IS DEAD CLEARLY WITH THE CLASSIC MUTILATION CUTS. NOW, ON THE ONE THAT YOU HAD LEFT TRYING TO FORCE FEED WATER, HOW DID YOU FIND HER? HAD SHE COLLAPSED ON TO HER KNEES? WAS SHE ON HER SIDE? My son found her and she was laying on her side. Nothing was missing from her. the only thing was that she was grinding her teeth when I tried to get the tube in her mouth. WHAT IS PECULIAR IS THAT YOU WOULD END UP WITH THE"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"ONE CLASSICALLY MUTILATED HEIFER INSIDE THE PASTURE THE SAME DAY THAT YOU WERE TRYING TO FORCE FEED WATER TO A COW THAT JUST STOOD THERE IN A STUPOR WITH HER EYES CLOSED. Yeah, it was really strange. AS IF PERHAPS WHATEVER IT WAS THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE MUTILATION, THERE MAY HAVE BEEN SOME INTERACTION WITH THAT OTHER COW AS WELL? Yeah, I'm assuming there was. THE ENTIRE HERD OF HOW MANY ANIMALS? 160. ALL OF THE OTHER 160 HERD, THEY WERE ALL VERY UPSET AND GOING AROUND WITH THEIR HEADS IN THE AIR AND VERY SKITTISH AND SCARED. Yeah, they were. HOW LONG DID THE COWS STAY THAT SCARED? It took a few days. Probably 4 or 5 days. FOR THEM TO ACTUALLY CALM DOWN? Ye a h . Mysterious Light In The Sky A Week Later DID ANY OF YOUR NEIGHBORS REPORT SEEING ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN THE SKY? No. NO LIGHTS? Well, I saw a strange light about a week later. I was still baling and I have to bale at night to get enough moisture to make a bale. And I was coming back probably at 4 in the morning and I thought I saw a falling star. It was big and really bright and it came straight down and then just before it got to the ground, it stopped. And it started to flash. The light started to flash. And then it went down behind the hill really slowly. WHEN IT STOPPED, DID IT CHANGE ANY COLOR AT ALL? Nope. IT STAYED WHITE, BUT WHEN YOU SAID IT FLASHED, WHAT HAPPENED? It just started flashing the light and then it went down really slowly out of sight. WHEN IT FLASHED, DO YOU MEAN IT WENT OFF AND ON? Ye a h . WAS THERE LIKE EVERY SECOND, OR A COUPLE OF FLASHES? Oh, it was quite... there would be 2 or 3 a second, quite fast. FAST PULSES. HOW MANY PULSES DO YOU THINK YOU SAW? Oh, gee, I'm not sure. LIKE OVER SEVERAL SECONDS? Ye a h . IT WAS THERE PULSING 2 OR 3 TIMES A SECOND FOR SEVERAL SECONDS. Maybe 10 seconds. WHERE YOU ESTIMATE IT WENT DOWN WOULD HAVE BEEN HOW CLOSE TO THE PASTURES WHERE YOU HAD THE TWO DEAD ANIMALS? I thought it could be anywhere between 5 miles from there. Or even right there. I"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"didn't know for sure. DID YOU HAVE THE ROYAL CANADIAN MOUNTED POLICE OR ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT COME OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE UNUSUAL ANIMAL DEATHS? I phoned them, but they wouldn't come. WHY? They didn't want to. They said first of all, it was probably just some kids. And I said, 'Well, I don't think so. For one thing, it's in the middle of nowhere. It's in a hollow and there aren't many kids around here, that's one thing.' There is no way. And then I had the inspector for brands because I happened to be talking to the Agriculture Rep and I told her. She told this inspector for the brands. And he told me, 'Well, it was probably lightning that killed her.' And insects. And I said, 'I don't think so.' I said, 'We haven't had lightning for a month. We're in the middle of a drought. And it was not insects, I know that for sure.' He said, 'Well, we had some sent in and that's what they told us.' IN YOUR OWN MIND, WHAT DO YOU THINK COULD BE INVOLVED? Well, I think it's aliens. YOU DO BECAUSE? No other explanation that I can think of. Because nobody else can do this. My pasture was a new pasture, too. A 4-wire fence. There was only one gate. No tracks. And everything about it I don't know how they killed it either. No blood. I don't know anybody that can do it nice and neat. Even if it did bleed, you couldn't wipe the blood off well enough to cover it all up. And also, I talked to a fellow a week later who had one the same night as I did. ON THE AUGUST 16TH? Yeah, about 30 miles south of me. (Near Empress, Alberta) I'm right on the border. It would be a little bit southwest. WHAT DID HE FIND? The same thing, except they took all four teats and the one was cut deep into the bag.\" More Information: Please see my books and documentaries concerning the unusual animal mutilation phenomenon in the Earthfiles Shop.
