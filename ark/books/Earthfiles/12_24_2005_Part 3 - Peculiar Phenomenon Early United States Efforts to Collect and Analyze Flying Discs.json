Seidel, 1999 Return to Part 1 I n order to better understand Peculiar Phenomenon , I am beginning with the following glossary of American government abbreviations, acronyms and nomenclature. AAF Army Air Forces, predecessor to the U. S. Air Force. USAF was created by the National Security Act and organized on August 1, 1947, only three weeks after one or more flying discs were allegedly recovered in the Roswell, Corona and White Sands Missile Range region of New Mexico. AEC Atomic Energy Commission, established by the Atomic Energy Act of 1946. AEC was a \"civilian\" organization given custody of all U. S. nuclear weapons and materials by the Act. A further nuclear weapons custody determination was made by President Truman in June 1948, in favor of the AEC. Aerospace Corporation A private, non-profit, \"civilian\" research and development corporation wholly owned by the U. S. Air Force Systems Command based in El Segundo, California. However, it appears to operate as an integrated military command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. AFCRC Armed Forces Cambridge Research Center, a division of the Air Material Command based at Wright (Patterson) Field (AFB), Dayton, Ohio. AFCRC is based in Massachusetts. AFGL Armed Forces Geophysical Laboratory. Now renamed: AFRL Air Force Research Laboratory - Space Vehicles Directorate. The Space Vehicles Directorate Headquarters is located at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque, New Mexico, at the site of the former Phillips Laboratory (see: AFWL). The second Space Vehicles Directorate site is located at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts, formerly the Geophysics Directorate. AFMC Air Force Materiel Command, located at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio. AFOSI Air Force Office of Special Investigations. AFOSI is a field operating agency with headquarters at Andrews Air Force Base, Maryland. It has been the Air Force's felony-level investigative service since August 1, 1948. The agency reports to the Inspector General, Office of the Secretary of the Air Force. There is also a district headquarters at Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque. AFOSI's mission focuses on counter- intelligence operations, specifically to target and investigate attempts to steal or disclose classified information related to U. S. special weapons. AFSA Armed Forces Security Agency. Precursor to the National Security Agency "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"(NSA), created on May 20, 1949, in the Department of Defense under the command of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. AFSA was to be responsible for directing the communications and electronic intelligence activities of military intelligence units such as the Army Security Agency, Naval Security Group and the Air Force Security Service. But AFSA was ineffective and was replaced in 1952 in a classified Executive Order of President Harry Truman by the creation of the National Security Agency. AFSC U. S. Air Force Systems Command was a former United States Air Force command. Its headquarters was located at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. On July 1, 1992, AFSC and Air Force Logistics Command were merged to form the Air Force Materiel Command, also located at Wright-Patterson AFB. AFSTC U. S. Air Force Space Technology Center, Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, New Mexico. AFWL U. S. Air Force Weapons Laboratory, at Kirtland AFB's Sandia Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico. AFWL was formed in 1947 as the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) and renamed Phillips Laboratory in 1991. A division of the Research and Technology Division, Air Force Systems Command in 1963, and the Director of Science and Technology, AFSC, after 1967. AFSWC U. S. Air Force Special Weapons Command, activated on December 1, 1949, at Kirtland AFB, Albuquerque, New Mexico. It was responsible for operating all Air Material Command (Wright Field, Ohio) activities at the base and provided personnel and equipment for developing and testing aircraft and other special weapons as well as providing additional personnel and equipment to the AEC. AFSWC's mission was \"... to establish and maintain technical supervision over a test facility and group of qualified personnel, aircraft, equipment and instrumentation that will provide the Air Force, the Atomic Energy Commission, their contractors and other agencies of the Department of Defense an organization for the development and testing of atomic weapons or other special weapons with their associated equipment for determining the adequacy of airborne vehicles and special weapons. It is the primary source of scientific and technical information pertaining to special weapons development and associated special techniques within the Air Force.\" [ \"From Sundaggers to Space Exploration\" © 1986 by Hsi and Panitz, New Mexico Journal of Science , Vol. 26, No. 1, p. 294.] AFSWC became the Air Force Special Weapons Center in 1952. AFSWP Armed Forces Special Weapons Project at Sandia Base, Albuquerque, New Mexico, established in 1947 with the transfer of some Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory production and research functions to the Z Division at Sandia Base in Albuquerque. AFSWP also involved the assignment of special U. S. military units to protect the U. S. special weapons stockpile. Brig. General Robert M. Montague (MJ-11) became the first military commander of AFSWP only four days after a flying disc allegedly was discovered near Corona, New Mexico, on July 4, 1947. AMC Air Material Command based after June 1947 at Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio; Kirtland Army Air Field, Albuquerque, NM; and Alamogordo Army Air Field, Alamogordo, NM. AMC's Commander in 1947 was General Nathan Twining (MJ-4). AMOS Air Force Maui Optical & Supercomputing Site, a detachment of the USAF Research Laboratory. AMOS is a satellite-tracking facility that uses electro-optical telescopes at Haleakala, Maui, Hawaii. APL Applied Physics Laboratory, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland. APL is an armed forces contractor which employs DTM staff at Carnegie Institution, Washington, D. C. APL became a U. S. Navy, Bureau of Aeronautics, contract laboratory in 1947. President of Johns Hopkins in 1947 was Dr. Detlev Bronk (MJ-6), who also served as President of the Rockefeller Institution after 1948. ARPA Advanced Research Projects Agency, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Pentagon, Washington, D. C. AT & T AT&T Bell Laboratories was a major AEC and Department of Defense (DoD) contractor who administered Sandia National Laboratory in Albuquerque, New Mexico, after March 1948. BMEWS Ballistic Missile Early Warning System based at Thule AFB, Greenland; Fylingdales, United Kingdom; and Clear, Alaska."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"BNL Brookhaven National Laboratory. In 1948, BNL had a $40 million budget during its first year of operation. The RAND Corporation referred to BNL as an AEC laboratory. BNL's own literature refers to its mission as an \"independent, academic research laboratory\" operated by a consortium of U. S. colleges in the Associated Universities, Inc. \"BOWMAN\" Proword purportedly associated with a compartmentalized intelligence classification for \"flying discs.\" A source says the proword was used because going after discs, from a military point of view, was \"like trying to hit a jet fighter with an arrow.\" BRL Ballistic Research Laboratory, U. S. Army Ordnance, that operated for the Joint Chiefs of Staff at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. CAB Civil Aeronautics Board. President Franklin Roosevelt split the authority into two agencies in 1940, the Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB). CAA was responsible for ATC, airman and aircraft certification, safety enforcement, and airway development. CAB was entrusted with safety rule-making, accident investigation, and economic regulation of the airlines. Both organizations were part of the Department of Commerce. Unlike CAA, however, CAB functioned independently of the Secretary. The approaching introduction of jet airliners and a series of midair collisions spurred passage of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958. This legislation transferred CAA's functions to a new independent body, the Federal Aviation Agency, which had broader authority to combat aviation hazards. The Act took safety rule-making from CAB and entrusted it to the new FAA. In 1966, Congress authorized the creation of a cabinet department that would combine major federal transportation responsibilities. This new Department of Transportation (DOT) began full operations on April l, 1967. On that day, the FAA became one of several organizations within DOT and received a new name, the Federal Aviation Administration. At the same time, CAB's accident investigation function was transferred to the new National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). CIA Central Intelligence Agency, formed on September 26, 1947, from three organizations: the Central Intelligence Group (CIG), the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and the Strategic Services Unit (SSU) of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Its first Director was Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (MJ-1). President Harry S. Truman signed the legislation to create the CIA only two weeks after one or more flying discs were allegedly recovered in the region of Carrizozo, Corona and Roswell, New Mexico. CIG Central Intelligence Group of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, was formed to replace the Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in May 1946. General Hoyt Vandenberg (MJ-5) was a director of CIG. Other CIG directors were Admiral Sydney Souers (MJ-8) and Admiral Roscoe Hillenkoetter (MJ-1). CIOS Combined Intelligence Objectives Subcommittee of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, established by the Joint Research and Development Board (JRDB). CIOS panels used the most expert scientific talent available from military, civilian and academic organizations to study specific technical subjects. CIOS panels held specific names such as V-2 Rocket Panel; Upper Atmosphere Rocket Research Panel; Subsurface Warfare Research Panel; Uranium Research Panel. CIW Carnegie Institution of Washington, D. C. During 1947, the President of CIW was Dr. Vannevar Bush (MJ-2), who also served as Director of OSRD (Office of Scientific Research and Development), JRDB (Joint Research and Development Board) and RDB (Research and Development Board). COMINT Communications Intelligence. CRPL Central Radio (Wave) Propagation Laboratory, National Bureau of Standards. In the late 1940s at the beginning of the Cold War, President Truman had declared that new government facilities not be built within the Washington, D.C. metro area so as not to concentrate so many federal facilities within range of one atomic bomb. Congress had appropriated funds for the CRPL and it was established within the National Bureau of Standards in 1946."},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"P resident Dwight Eisenhower dedicated the CRPL within the NBS in Boulder, Colorado, in 1954.

DEW LINE Distant Early Warning System was designed, constructed and managed by Associated Universities Inc., parent organization of Brookhaven National Laboratory. DNA Defense Nuclear Agency, now DSWA . DNA, whose lineage derives from the Manhattan Project that produced the first atomic bomb, carried out nuclear support responsibilities throughout the Cold War. Over the years, the name of the organization evolved from the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project (AFSWP) in 1947, to the Defense Atomic Support Agency (DASA) in 1959, to DNA in 1971. In 1996, the name was changed to: Defense Special Weapons Agency (DSWA). The Agency's responsibilities were increased as a result of two congressionally mandated studies of its roles and functions. Missions include: maintaining a center for nuclear technical expertise within the Defense Department (DoD); conducting nuclear weapons stockpile support and serving as the lead DoD agency for national nuclear stockpile stewardship programs; performing nuclear and advanced weapons effects research and operational support; carrying out research and development to support U.S. government implementation, compliance and verification of arms control treaties and agreements; researching and developing capabilities for military responses to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; supporting military war fighters in analyzing plans and response options for both nuclear and advanced conventional weapons; carrying out DoD's Cooperative Threat Reduction (CRT) program projects. \"DREAMLAND\" Alleged joint U.S. government and alien base/s in Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Colorado and Arizona.
