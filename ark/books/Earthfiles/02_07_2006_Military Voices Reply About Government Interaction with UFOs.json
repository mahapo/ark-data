S. Navy physicist, Bruce Maccabee, about his discussions with a USAF geophysicist referred to as \"Hawk.\" See two-part 012106 Earthfiles. I also reported more about former New Mexico State Representative (Dona Ana County, Las Cruces) Andrew Kissner's investigations of V-2 rocket research at White Sands Proving Ground in 1947 when aerial discs interfered with launches. See \"Peculiar Phenomenon\" Real X-Files series beginning with 121905 Earthfiles. Since these several reports, I have received more than a hundred e-mails from people who have either firsthand military and/or intelligence backgrounds, or are relatives of people who have such backgrounds. Many have asked that their identity remain anonymous. I feel it is valuable to share some of the e-mails and hope other Earthfiles viewers and radio listeners will contact me with additional information that complements, or goes beyond, what I am posting in this first in a series of Earthfiles military voices. Military Voices Respond to January 20-21, 2006 Earthfiles and Radio Reports 1) USAF Radar - Vertically Rising \"Fast Walkers\" (See Update Reply after this e-mail.) \"Please don't use my name. The information I have may, or may not, be of much use to you. But after listening to you on Mr. Noory's program tonight (Jan. 20, 2006), I thought you might be interested. \"My career in the U.S.A.F. spanned nearly twenty-four years, from 1968 to 1991. The entire time was spent in radar operations. First as a Scope Operator, ending up as Superintendent of Operations for one of the squadrons at U.S.Space Command located in Colorado Springs, Colorado. \"Through out my career, I tracked hundreds of fast moving objects. I didn't think anything much about them until tonight when it was stated that the approximate speed of UFOs is at least 1500 to 1700 miles per hour. We used to refer to these objects as 'Fast Walkers' and chalked them up to SR-71's or other experimental aircraft. There were some, however, that did not fit the criteria of normal aircraft. For example, speeds could vary on a particular radar track from 1500 to over 2000 miles per hour in a matter of seconds. Some would come into range at around 45 to 50 thousand feet and appear to stop or slow to just a few hundred miles per hour, but when they were verified on our height finding radar, we found they had not slowed at all, but were climbing at a phenomenal rate to above 100 thousand feet within a matter of seconds. \"In 1976, I was trained in electronic warfare. It was my job to maintain the highest quality radar reception in any environment. This was back in what I call the 'old manual days' when one in this field would work a console full of frequency analyzing equipment so that you could 'see' the enemy's jamming signal and then manually steer your radar's frequency away from it. Sort of like tuning in a radio station for the best sound. With this specialized training, it was relatively easy to tell the difference from a tangible target and a false "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"return. \"In 1982, I was assigned to NORAD in the Missile Warning Center. There I discovered that there really are 'men in black.' Our mission there was to locate any missile launches anywhere in the world. This was done through the use of infrared, radar or other means of detection. We would then process the data and disseminate it to the Pentagon and several other foreword users. \"There were times when we would detect an anomaly and process the information as trained. Later, usually before the end of the shift, people would come into the center and request all of the information gathered for the particular sighting. They would be gone anywhere from a few minutes to hours, and when our log books were returned, the pages were missing that contained the data, and we were told that we saw nothing.\" Update Reply to 1): \"I wanted to write to you and verify one of the military e-mail messages that you posted on your website (above). The first email, titled USAF Radar - Vertically Rising \"Fast Walkers\". What this person wrote about his time in the NORAD Missle Warning Center is definitley true. From 1983 - 1987, I was an enlisted Air Force computer maintenance tech at Cheyenne Mountain, and from 1987 - 1988 I worked in SPADOC and was part of the Automated Intelligence Upgrade (AIU) program at NORAD. I had a Top Secret/SCI clearance and was one of a very few techs allowed in every part of the complex. I frequently worked in the Missle Warning Center and have experienced the very thing he described, down to the visits and the instructions that came with the visits. It got to be a pretty regular thing. I also had access to the Command Post, Space Operations, Intel, SP ADOC and other very sensitive areas. What he mentioned is just the tip of the iceberg.\" 2) U. S. Border Patrol - UFO Interference with Atlas Missiles \"I was just listening to your fascinating report on UFOs. I want to tell you about something I heard about many years ago in around 1964. I was stationed with the U.S. Border Patrol at Carlsbad, New Mexico during that time and had a good friend who worked for the old AEC. One night we were playing cards and drinking some beers. He had been up to the Las Vegas underground atomic sites and was in Carlsbad for some R&R. His name was JB. He swore us all to secrecy and told us about an underground air base near Roswell, NM. He said that it was located in the desert, on what I believe is BLM land, probably 40 or 50 miles northeast of Roswell. He said that the government had discovered a huge limestone cavern, many times bigger than the Carlsbad Caverns and had developed it into some kind of underground air base and installation. He said it had a big retracting door that planes could fly into...I suspect he meant helicopters, as it would have to have been a huge opening for a jet plane to land in. He said that the doors were then retracted and the whole site was invisible as the doors were covered with sand and looked like the rest of the landscape. We had occasion to drive out in that area with a four wheel drive jeep and covered a lot of it but never saw anything. The land there is really barren, just miles of sand dunes. He also said that there was no road leading to the site and everything came and went by air. There were some other really weird things happening during those times...UFOs, strange events at a couple of the Atlas missile silos around Roswell. One event we personally witnessed. Supposedly an Atlas missile had been \"accidentally fired\" while the silo doors were closed. The missile reportedly blew part way through the doors and then exploded. The bad part is that it reportedly had a nuclear warhead on it, and that the warhead had been blown away somewhere by the highway. My partner and I were in the patrol car heading up to Portales, NM when we came on a state police/AF police roadblock. That was about 4am and it was still dark. There were helicopters and vehicles running all over the area on both sides of the highway. One of the state policeman manning the roadblock told us what had happened. He said the AF was frantic because they couldn't find the warhead. He finally let us through as we were in a marked patrol vehicle with a warning if we saw it not to try to pick it up."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"About a month later we were in Roswell, stopped at the state police office and happened to run into the same officer who had been at the roadblock. We asked him what had developed with the lost warhead. He said that the AF had advised them that an old Indian had stopped and picked it up and put it in his car trunk and drove to St Louis, as I remember. He showed up with radiation burns in the hospital there and that was how they located the warhead. I have asked people who know about such things and they said that the story does not sound plausible...the part about an Indian picking it up. They said that those warheads were too big for one man to pick up and carry off. So, what the whole thing was all about, I don't know. We also heard that another silo had a similar 'accident' later on. Of course all of the silos were abandoned by the AF as was the SAC air base there. I later heard that some of those silo incidents were actually instigated by UFOs in the area, although we didn't hear that from the AF. I think the whole story of an accidental firing was made up to cover the UFOs being involved. During those times, there were various sightings of UFOs by many people, some by state police officers. Some real strange things happened around White Sands and Alamogordo during those times, too. One incident told by a state policeman was that all the power went dead on a stretch of the highway north of Alamogordo. His car stopped, all electrical things quit...as with a bunch of other cars as far as he could see. Cars just stopped running. That went on for about 15 minutes and then suddenly they all came on and everyone drove off. I know of one incident where a state policeman saw a UFO land early one morning. He was able to drive his patrol car up close to where it was parked a few hundred yards off the highway. He got out his accident investigation camera and shot some film of it before it took off. He then shot photos of the marks it made on the ground. He called the sighting into his dispatcher. Very shortly after he reported it he was descended upon by some plain clothes men from White Sands. They took his camera away from him, took out the film and he never got it back, according to what he told us. Our friend JB, who worked for AEC...he died of cancer when he was still in his late 20's. I was not surprised as he told us that he was going down into the holes to retrieve radio gear right after some of the underground A bomb tests. We couldn't believe him when he told us that because any fool would know that the radiation had to be tremendous. I suspect that is why he got eaten up with cancer at such a young age. There were numerous other things that happened in those days around Eastern and central New Mexico. We did not know of the 1947 UFO crash however, at the time. That news came later, long after I moved away. I retired from the Border Patrol in 1990, after 32 years of service. Some of the most vivid UFO sightings I heard about was while I was stationed on the Canadian border in Derby Line, Vermont. That is another story. I hope this helps you out with some of your research. I do agree with you about the UFO thing. I think the government, for whatever reason, is keeping the truth from us.\" 3) U. S. Navy - Green Aerial Oval Performed Aerial Patterns \"While at Basic Training for the US Navy, Dec 1966, I was one of about at least 500 Navy personnel who witnessed a UFO. It looked like an emerald green oval in the dark 04:30 am sky. Our training company was marching to the galley for breakfast. The incident lasted about 20 to 30 minutes. From exiting our barracks to the time we reached the outer area of the galley, the green oval would fly from one horizon to the opposite one in about 1 second! When our company finally reached the area just outside the galley and we were facing south, the oval then shot straight up and stopped directly above us for some time. \"When it finally moved, it started making the outline of a staircase , stopping at each vertex momentarily. When it finally reached down to the horizon it again stopped momentarily. It then"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"flew to a point about 45 degrees above the horizon or half ways up the sky. It again froze in the sky. At that point it got smaller and smaller such that we could no longer see it. \"The next day our company commander, a Submarine Service Chief Petty Officer, told us that the San Diego Police Department had been flooded with phone calls from the residents of the marina in the immediate area. Also that the two bases in the area (NAS Miramar & NAS Coronado Island) had picked the object up on radar and had launched jets to intercept it.\" 4) U. S. Navy Officer - American Military Shooting At Disc Technology \"I wanted to relate the story of my father, who was a U. S. Navy officer from 1941 to 1973. From 1962 to 1973, he was a captain and during this period, was granted the highest security clearance, which was referred to as a 'super security clearance.' Naturally, this gave him the ability to see and hear about the most classified material. He was also the Reserve CO of NAS Twin Cities in Minneapolis from 1969 until the base was decommissioned in 1970. Because of his rank, security clearance, and the fact he possessed a Bachelor's of Science from Eastern Michigan University, he was selected in 1965 to attend what was called a 'West Coast Weapons Seminar' sponsored by the military and contractors Lockheed and Aerojet-General, which together, worked on the Polaris missile project at the time. The meetings took place at the Naval Base at Point Hueneme, CA., and the emphasis was on propulsion systems. My father stated that roughly 50 scientists and high-ranking military officers were in attendance. \"Upon listening to your report on COAST, I decided to pose some questions to my father. Mind you, he had not listened to the show, and in fact, never has heard Coast to Coast AM . So, of course, his answers could not be influenced by any media. I began asking him if the subject of ETs and UFOs was ever discussed at this very classified seminar. He initially stated that he really couldn't get into specifics of what was discussed. Then I asked if based on what he may have heard or seen at the seminar, did he believe ETs existed. He said, 'Well, I would say yes.' After what one calls, a 'pregnant pause,' he actually SHOCKED me by volunteering the following. . .'Well, there was a craft shot down.' I asked, 'What craft was shot down?' He replied, 'A UFO had been shot down some years before - I believe it was the late 1940s.' I asked, 'Was it one or more than one?' He stated that, to his knowledge, just one had been shot down. This seemed to dovetail with what you discussed in Earthfiles and the radio. \"He added that the V-2 program you referred to was, he believed, utilized exclusively by the Navy for the subsequent development of the Polaris intercontinental missile and that the Navy was many years ahead of the other services in missile technology. \"As you would understand, none of this material was brought home by him and was strictly 'For Eyes Only' and discourse was only amongst a relatively limited group of officers and scientists. Although today he is 86, he maintains a relatively sharp mind and his knowledge of the military remains quite awesome. As a highly-decorated officer, he always was extremely level- headed and thoroughly professional. \"During his tenure as a captain, he also made visits to NORAD, Ellsworth AFB in South Dakota, Offut AFB near Omaha, NAS Roosevelt Roads in Puerto Rico, and served a short time at the Pentagon. \"I used to have quite a bit of skepticism regarding UFOs. Because I always knew my father had a security clearance, I decided that he couldn't impart any information, so I stayed away from asking questions. I regret I waited so long. I appreciated your most interesting radio input and Earthfiles report. I hope this has been helpful.\" 5) Roswell, NM Military Radar - Pilot Disappeared Pursuing UFO \"I worked with a man named HF who lives in Brush Prairie, Washington (northern suburb of Vancouver, WA) and he worked at radar installations and"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"went on alert for Roswell. He knew of a pilot disappearing in a pursuit of a UFO. He had very high security clearance for communications, was told by (men in black) that some events 'never happened' and were not to be discussed such as high speed objects being tracked via radar. Even with the passage of time, he could not even acknowledge Area 51 (Nellis AFB, Nevada) because he did not want to end up in Leavenworth (prison). He reported firsthand sighting of a 'mothership' in the desert while being stationed there and reported detecting traces of radioactivity in its trail.\" 6) White Sands Missile Range Commander - Mysterious Disks and Radioactive Light Beam \"A friend of mine in college told me his father was commander of White Sands in the 1950s, I believe, and said it was common knowledge during test missile firings that 'mysterious disks' would swoop in at thousands of miles per hour, follow the (missile) trajectory, and zoom off again. He also said that two airmen reported to sick bay after being surrounded by a light, and later died of radiation poisoning.\" M ilitary voices continued in Part 2.
