Image based on eyewitness drawings © 2003 by Adgraphics. January 18, 2004 Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada - A little after 7 p.m. MT in February 2003, on a very clear night outside Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada, two grade school friends were sledding in a back yard until they saw a big triangular piece of the starry sky move. Neither wants their names to be used in this report, but I was able to interview now-11-year-old, \"Sally,\" who is still in grade school with an interest in art and music. Her neighbor is a year older. Interview: \"Sally,\" 11-years-old, Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada: \"We were outside and tobogganing on the hill and I fell and I was laying on the ground and looked up and I saw these three stars moving at the same time and the stars inside were moving with it. It was a perfect triangle and it was really, really, really big and it was going really slowly and silently. And the stars in the corner were bigger than the stars on the inside. The stars on the inside were in kind of a pattern, like it was just a line around the edge and it was in a pattern. There was a little red dot in the middle, like a very small dot in the middle of it. WHEN YOU SAY THERE WAS A PATTERN OF THE LIGHTS IN THERE, HOW WOULD IT BE DIFFERENT FROM THE STARRY SKY THAT IT WAS MOVING THROUGH? The stars were more spread out everywhere and the ones on the inside (of the triangle) were spaced evenly in a line. And had little smaller ones inside in a line. SO THERE WERE THE APPEARANCE OF MORE ORDERED STARS IN STRAIGHT LINES INSIDE OF THE TRIANGLE? "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"Ye s . ABOUT HOW CAN YOU DESCRIBE THE SPEED THAT THE TRIANGLE OF LIGHTS WAS MOVING? It was going very, very slowly. It barely moved. It was like you could tell it was moving, b ut it was going very sl owl y. WHAT WAS THE VERY FIRST THOUGHT THAT WENT THROUGH YOUR MIND WHEN YOU SAW THIS MOVING? I just said, 'Oh, my gosh I know what that is!' And I started to get really scared. WHEN YOU SAID, 'I KNOW WHAT THAT IS,' WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? I was thinking that it was a UFO. YOU WERE THINKING IT WAS A UFO BECAUSE WHY? Because I knew that stars didn't really move like that and satellites don't do that and airplanes don't do that. I knew it wasn't just stars or a plane or satellites or something because three satellites couldn't move like that and have all the stars inside it move at the same time, too. So, I knew what it was and started to get really scared. So I said, 'I'm going inside because I don't feel very good.' A UFO WOULD MEAN WHAT TO YOU? Just something like aliens it's just like then when I saw it, it was a sign of fear. It's just something because it's something that no one knows barely anything about. Basically, it just automatically scares you. DID YOU HAVE ANY SENSE THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING IN THIS TRIANGLE THAT WANTED ANYTHING FROM THE EARTH OR US? Not really. The only thing I was really feeling right then was fear. FEAR ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD DO? That it would like take me away or something. IT LOOKED IN YOUR FATHER'S ANIMATION LIKE IT TOOK UP A LOT OF THE SKY. DID IT? Yes, it was really big, but it was high up. But it was really big and went really slowly. YOU WATCHED IT FOR ABOUT HOW LONG? Four or five minutes.\" Computer Animation of the Triangle of Stars Sally, who now lives with her re-married mother in Canada after her parents divorced, waited until Christmas time 2003 while visiting her father in Vancouver to talk about the moving triangle of stars. Her father is a professional computer graphics animator who asked Sally to draw what she had seen on paper. Sally's father then took Sally's drawings and over a period of four hours while she worked with him, generated an animation of what the girls had seen nearly a year earlier. You can see the animation at this link: Sally's Animation of Moving Triangle of Stars."},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"Sally's initial drawing for her father's December 2003 computer animation effort, based on her eyewitness sighting with her school friend in February 2003, in Grande Prairie, Alberta, Canada. Sally's final drawing of large moving \"triangle of stars\" for her father's computer animation effort in December 2003. \"CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THE ANIMATION THAT YOUR FATHER DID HOW DID YOU WORK WITH HIM ON IT? What we did was first I drew a picture. I described some of it to him and he drew it on the computer and then animated it. DID YOU SAY, 'NO, THAT DOESN'T LOOK QUITE RIGHT OR IT WENT SLOWER OR FASTER'? Yes, I did. WOULD YOU SAY THAT THE ANIMATION THAT YOUR FATHER NOW HAS IS VERY CLOSE TO WHAT YOU AND YOUR FRIEND SAW? Ye s . AND THAT IT TOOK AT LEAST MINUTES BEFORE YOU WENT IN THE HOUSE? Ye s . AND THIS WAS MOVING SLOWLY AND WHEN YOU FIRST SAW IT WAS THE TRIANGLE OF MOVING STARS NEAR THE ZENITH, THE TOP, OF THE SKY? It was right above me. SO THE FIRST MOMENT THAT YOU AND YOUR FRIEND SAW THE STARS MOVING, IT WAS DIRECTLY ABOVE YOU?"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"Ye s . THEN AS IT MOVED SLOWLY, HOW FAR DID IT GO IN THE TIME THAT YOU WATCHED? Not very far because it went really slow. It went about 5 inches or something from my perspective. It didn't go very far. AS THE TRIANGLE CONTAINING STARS SLOWLY MOVED, BEHIND THE TRIANGLE WAS STILL THE STARRY SKY, RIGHT? Yes, and they weren't moving at all. SO YOU BECAME AWARE THAT WHATEVER THE BIG TRIANGLE WAS, IT WAS ALMOST LIKE CAMOUFLAGE USING STARS OR THE IMAGES OF STARS LIKE CAMOUFLAGE IN THE SKY? Ye s . DID YOU TALK ABOUT THIS WITH YOUR FRIEND? No, not really. Actually, I've never brought it up since that day, I've never brought it up before. WHY? Because I knew other people would not believe me or they would get scared or something. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU WERE SCARED OF? It's not that I'm scared that anything might happen, it's just kind of a natural fear that I have because my dad is really into that kind of stuff. So, he's always talking about like aliens might abduct you or something. So I was getting afraid of that thought because I knew it was a UFO. DID EITHER OF YOU GO BACK OUTSIDE TO SEE IF IT WERE STILL THERE MOVING IN THE SKY? No. THAT NIGHT, DID YOU TELL YOUR PARENTS OR ANYBODY? No. AND THE REASON YOU DIDN'T EVEN TELL YOUR PARENTS WAS WHAT? Because I thought they would either get scared or not believe me. WHY DO YOU THINK PEOPLE WOULD NOT BELIEVE YOU? Because a lot of people especially around here wouldn't really they wouldn't it's not the kind of thing they are interested in . A lot of people kind of know, maybe heard (about UFOs) once or twice, but it's not really a subject of conversation around here. Hardly anybody even barely knows about it or believes they are out there. I WONDER IF YOU THINK EXTRATERRESTRIALS ARE HERE ON OUR PLANET NOW? Yes, I do actually. I believe we are not the only ones in the whole universe, the only life forms on the only planet able to carry living beings. I do believe there have been visits and that there are extraterrestrials and aliens and that kind of stuff here. DOES THAT SCARE YOU NOW?"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"Not as much as it did last year because now I've come to realize that it's not really it's not like they will hurt you or anything, and there is so little chance of them coming to you, one person out of so many billions of people in the whole world. DO YOU EXPECT TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THAT AGAIN? Most likely. I wouldn't be surprised. BECAUSE? Because there have been a lot of sightings around these parts and it's so many people, there have been so many frequent reports of sightings, I wouldn't be surprised if I saw one again. IF YOU DID THIS TIME, WOULD YOU TELL PEOPLE? Ye s , I w o u l d . \" Credits Copyright © 1999 - 2009 by Linda Moulton Howe.
