Wesley Clark, NATO Commander. 1999 photo from Kosovo Crisis: a Study in Foreign Policy Mismanagement by Dr. Vojin Joksimovich. November 3, 2004 Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada - Wesley K. Clark was born in Chicago, Illinois, in December 1944, an only child of Veneta and Benjamin Kanne. His father died and he moved with his mother to Little Rock, Arkansas. In 1954, Veneta married Victor Clark who became Wes Clark's stepfather. In 1962, Wesley Clark was admitted to the United States Military Academy and began a 38-year career of public service in the United States Army, where he became a four-star general. In 1994, General Clark was named Director for Strategic Plans and Policy of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Pentagon. In 1995, General Clark traveled to the Balkans as the military negotiator with Ambassador Richard Holbrooke in a United States effort to end the war in Bosnia, the bloodiest war in Europe since World War II. A few months later, General Clark played a vital role in creating a peace plan in the Dayton summit which ended the war. In 1997, after serving as Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Southern Command, General Clark was selected for one of the top posts in the military : Supreme Allied Commander of NATO - a position first held by General Dwight D. Eisenhower. As Supreme Allied Commander, General Clark commanded NATO forces during the war in Kosovo. "},{"pageNumber":2,"pageContent":"In early 2003, Americans drafted General Clark to run for President on the Democratic platform. Given General Clark's distinguished military career, it seemed likely to Canadian UFO investigator, Grant Cameron, that Wesley Clark might have - must have? - been briefed on Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOs). Grant is Director of Presidentialufo.com and has made a serious study of American presidential calendars, diaries and documents dated around the times of significant UFO incidents. For a long time, Grant Cameron has urged UFO investigators to seek out well-connected people who run for political office and ask them in public press conferences: 'Have you ever been briefed about UFOs?' Recently Roswell UFO crash researcher, David Rudiak, did ask General Clark that question and received a remarkable answer. Grant Cameron explained for me this week the background behind the General's reply. Interview: September 27, 2003 Gen. Clark Discussed \"Beyond the Speed of Light\" Grant Cameron, UFO Investigator and Director, Presidentialufo.com, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada: \" The first event occurred on September 27, 2003, at a private home where his campaign was just getting going. Wesley Clark who is a 4-Star General, the highest military rank that exists today was in Newcastle, New Hampshire, and was asked a question by Jay Buckley, who was an astronaut on the space shuttle what his (Clark's) vision for space was. Wesley Clark said he believed it was possible that we would be able to go past the speed of light. \"I still believe in E=mc2, but I can't believe in all of human history we've never been able to go beyond the speed of light to reach where we want to go. I happen to believe that mankind can do it.\" Editor's Note: The first media to report General Clark's reply to Jay Buckley was WIRED NEWS: 9/2003 NEW CASTLE, New Hampshire -- \"Wesley Clark: Rhodes scholar, four-star general, NATO commander, futurist? ( WIRED's first story version used the word \"fanatic\" which was later changed to \"futurist.\") During a whirlwind campaign swing Saturday through New Hampshire, Clark, the newest Democratic presidential candidate, gave supporters one of the first glimpses into his views on technology. \"We need a vision of how we're going to move humanity ahead, and then we need to harness science to do it,\" Clark told a group of about 50 people in New Castle attending a house party -- a tradition in New Hampshire presidential politics that enables well-connected voters to get an up-close look at candidates. Then the 58-year-old Arkansas native, who retired from the military three years ago, dropped something of a bombshell on the gathering. \"I still believe in e=mc2, but I can't believe that in all of human history, we'll never ever be able to go beyond the speed of light to reach where we want to go,\" said Clark. \"I happen to believe that mankind can do it. I've argued with physicists about it, I've argued with best friends about it. I just have to believe it. It's my only faith-based initiative.\" Clark's comment prompted laughter and applause from the gathering. ... ... Einstein's theory of special relativity says that time slows down as an object approaches the speed of light. Some scientists say that FTL travel therefore implies time travel, or being able to travel to the future or the past. Clark's comment about FTL travel came at the end of a long answer to a question about his views of NASA and the U.S. space program. Clark said he supports the agency and believes \"America needs a dream and a space program.\" But Clark said the nation must prioritize its technological goals and take a pragmatic approach to focusing its scientific resources and talent. \"Some goals may take a lifetime to reach,\" he said. \"We need to set those goals now. We need to rededicate ourselves to science, engineering and technology in this country.\" Grant Cameron: \"I was very surprised that Clark made this dramatic statement about going past the speed of light, that he believed it and argued (with scientists) about it as a 4-star general and NOBODY asked him a question about it?! He went through the entire campaign until last Saturday night and nobody asked him, 'What are you talking about, General? What do you mean going faster than the speed of light? Where did you get this from?\" Everyone was just silent. After that, because General Clark was on the campaign trail and sounded like he might have other technology information - and I'm very aware that the highest ranking people"},{"pageNumber":3,"pageContent":"should answer about UFOs since they might know stuff - I passed around to a number of researchers in the United States the challenge to get Wesley Clark and ask him the question I always ask about the President of the United States. That is not if you believe in UFOs, but 'Have you ever been briefed about UFOs?' A number of researchers said they did not want to be embarrassed asking the question or they had someone in their family who would come under government scrutiny if they asked the question. Basically, Clark went through his whole campaign and eventually pulled out of the race and no one asked him the UFO briefing question until last Saturday, October 23, 2004. The questioner was David Rudiak.\" Editor's Note: A photograph taken July 8, 1947, in Fort Worth, Texas, by James Bond Johnson of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram shows Brig.

David Rudiak has a Ph.D. in physics from the University of California, Berkeley. David used a digital photo scanner to enlarge and enhance words printed on the folded piece of paper General Ramey held. Then he used another computer program to select the most likely words on the paper and found two key phrases: \"and the victims of the wreck\" and \"in the 'disc' they will ship.\" Excerpt of Ramey document and Rudiak's computer analysis. You can view complete text reconstruction of Gen. Ramey message at http://www.roswe llproof.home stead.com/ October 30, 2004 - Gen. Clark Asked About UFO Briefing Grant Cameron: \"David Rudiak is probably one of the foremost experts on the Roswell UFO crash story and has an excellent website on Roswell. He e-mailed me on Sunday morning (October 31, 2004)) and told me he had been on business in Reno, Nevada, and had come cross Wesley Clark (now out of the Presidential campaign). Gen. Clark was campaigning for Sen. Kerry during the Presidential campaign. Rudiak watched Clark's speech and afterward, he went up and asked the General my briefing question. I can give you the exact quote of what happened as David told me, but it was not recorded: David Rudiak: 'General Clark, when you were running for president, you said you thought mankind would one day fly faster than the speed of light and visit the stars. My question is: when you were in the military, were you ever briefed on the subject of UFOs?' Rudiak said at this point, 'Clark looked down for a moment and shook his head"},{"pageNumber":4,"pageContent":"somewhat chagrined looking like 'Damn it, here it comes!' Then he said to me, 'I heard a bit. In fact, I am going to be in Roswell, New Mexico, tonight.' Rudiak came back with a question: 'So, were you briefed?' General Clark said to him: 'There are things going on. But we will have to work out our own mathematics.' Was Gen. Clark Given Access to 'Crashed Saucer Material'? Grant Cameron: \" When I put this question out across the United States to a number of different people, I sent it to a couple of people who were inside NIDS (National Institute of Discovery Science, now-defunct). Some of those people have bumped up against the UFO subject in their former work for the government and a number of them have been notoriously known as the 'aviary.' Editor's Note: \"Aviary\" is the bird-named group of UFO investigators allegedly linked to government insiders who have leaked information - officially or unofficially - about non-human entities and technologies. Grant Cameron: \"Back in 2003 when I gave Gen. Clark's initial statement about the fact that we could go faster than the speed of light to one of the people inside NIDS, he said: 'A bird told me that Clark has been given access to crashed saucer material.' That's why I pushed very hard for people to actually confront General Clark with the question: 'Have you ever been briefed (about UFOs)?' I wanted to see what a 4-star general with classified access would answer, which did not happen until Saturday night, October 30, 2004, thanks to David Rudiak. I think in that exchange that Clark basically confirmed he knows something about what is going on. WHAT YOU MEAN BY 'CONFIRMED' IS THAT HE DID NOT BRUSH MR. RUDIAK'S QUESTION OFF. HE SAID THAT WE WILL HAVE TO WORK OUT THE MATHEMATICS, IMPLYING THAT THEY HAVE HAD SOME EXPOSURE TO A TECHNOLOGY AND SOMETHING OUT THERE, THE INTELLIGENCE BEHIND IT WHICH IS NOT HELPING US? WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO HELP OURSELVES? Yes. In fact, it struck me that there are a number of times when high ranking people have been asked about this and they have brought up this thing about mathematics. Eric Walker, Ph.D., Former President, Penn State University Editor's Note: Penn State's History of Mechanical engineering states: \"Eric A. Walker became the sixth dean of engineering at Penn State. Eric Walker was born in England, but spent his youth in Wrightsville, Pennsylvania. He was educated as an electrical engineer and received his Ph.D. and M.B.A. from Harvard. During World War II, he participated in the underwater acoustic research program at Harvard. Following the war, the entire underwater acoustic program was transferred to Penn State and became known as the Ordnance Research Laboratory (ORL). Eric Walker was the original director of ORL and also head of the electrical engineering department. \"Eric A. Walker, Dean of the College of Engineering and Architecture, was a strong proponent of research. In 1956, Walker became University Vice President for Research and within five months, he became Penn State's twelfth President. Under President Walker (1956-70), the University expanded more rapidly than ever in its history. The enrollment climbed from 13,000 to 45,000, and the budget grew from $34 million to $165 million. A hundred new buildings were constructed on the University Park Campus alone.\" Grant Cameron: \"A number of years ago, we had been chasing after Dr. Eric Walker, who was former President of Penn State University. Dr. Walker was a guy who claimed all along that he knew what was going on and he tried to walk his way around the various subjects we were asking about such as MJ-12 and what the U. S. military knew about UFOs. Dr. Walker had been there right as it all started in 1947 and co-invented the homing torpedo. When Dr. Vannevar Bush retired the guy everyone thought was running the UFO program in the Pentagon - Dr. Eric Walker took over Bush's office. So, Eric Walker was a very high ranking guy. He answered a number of UFO-related questions indirectly to us. At one point, Dr. Walker even brought up mathematics. One time he was being"},{"pageNumber":5,"pageContent":"interviewed by a guy from England who had a physics background. Dr. Walker asked the interviewer, 'How good is your mathematics?' The English investigator answered, 'Well as good as it can be for a doctorate in physics. But why do you ask?' Dr. Walker said, 'Because only a couple of people are able to handle this issue. Unless your mind is like Einstein's, I do not think you will achieve anything.' A second incident that popped into my mind when I heard General Clark talk about the mathematics was Jan Hartzen who runs the Orange County MUFON. He was in a 1993 lecture given by Lockheed's original Skunk Works Director, Ben Rich. Ben Rich, original director during Cold War of Lockheed's highly classified \"Skunk Works.\" Rich is in the cockpit of a F-117 stealth fighter, one of his Skunk Works projects. Photo credit: NASA. According to Jan Hartzen who was in the auditorium listening, Ben Rich said we have the technology to 'take ET home.' And Lockheed Skunk Works is where it's believed a lot of UFO technology back-engineering has been done. Another thing that Jan told me was that Ben Rich was talking about the mathematics that we've found the thing that we are missing, the part of the equation we have been missing we've figured it out. If you know a number of people who are working on the zero point energy stuff Hal Puthoff and people like that they are always talking about the mathematics. And mathematics in this whole UFO mystery is very important. That's the key, the mathematics. And strangely enough, in October 2004 we have General Wesley Clark bringing up the idea of mathematics being important. DID DAVID RUDIAK HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENT ON THE WAY THAT GENERAL CLARK LOOKED AFTER HE MADE THE STATEMENT, 'WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO WORK OUT THE MATHEMATICS.' No, not as far as I know. It was one of these things after a speech where you are shaking hands and you have only fifteen seconds to get in what you want to say. I did check and found out that General Clark was in Roswell. He was going to Roswell right after that lecture. So David brought up UFOs and General Clark brought up Roswell, as if the two are connected, which would seem to indicate some confirmation of the Roswell crash. Clark was very interested in space. He wanted to be an astronaut. He's in the Army, but he wanted to be in the U.S. Air Force. He couldn't, though, because he is short-sighted and could not get into the USAF. So, he went to West Point and into the Army. I followed his presidential campaign website all the way through. He met with people like the Mars Society. They described their encounter with him as, 'We were blown away!' When they asked him questions such as, 'What about a trip to Mars?' He said he wanted to speed the trip up. He said, 'I think we should be looking at new propulsion and enabling technologies.' He did not really want to go to places we had already been. They described Clark when he talked about space to the Mars Society as having fire in his voice. In that sense, he's a guy who is very interested in space and has not had to address the UFO question, but is still hiding what he actually knows. But I would say he probably has enough that he could break it open. So to me, it's an important thing to ask presidents and 4-star generals about UFOs, rather than people who are just in the military. The leaders carry a lot of weight, what they say carries a lot of weight, and if one of these people should start to talk or be confronted by the media, it could break the story wide open. We might get somebody on the record who has to tell the truth and will tell us what is actually going on. People like Clark should know what is going on. BUT AFTER 60 SOME YEARS, IT IS STILL NOT IN THE INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS TO OPEN UP THE EXTRATERRESTRIAL BIOLOGICAL ENTITY SUBJECT."},{"pageNumber":6,"pageContent":"Exactly. And why haven't the aliens come forward? Why are the aliens covering this up? The aliens are doing the same sort of thing as the government, dropping little hints that they are there, little indications. But I always maintain that they could land on the White House lawn and end this (mystery) tomorrow. They don't. There might be a very good reason behind the scenes why the aliens and the U. S. government are both gradually. I'm doing a lecture in Las Vegas about the vast majority of things we believe today in the UFO community are not things we discovered (independently.) They are things that have been leaked to us by the U. S. government, whether it's Area 51, MJ-12, crashed saucers. This is all stuff that has been gradually leaked to us and our world view has been formed by the U. S. government. The aliens, I think, are doing the same sort of thing leaking little things and making us more and more aware all the time. But no one is coming out to end the cover-up. I think the government and the aliens could both do it. They haven't, which indicates to me there must be something behind the scenes that we have not explored carefully enough and we should look at: why are they doing this? What is the thing that is stopping them from coming public? White House Insights to the Strict UFO Cover-Up What happens if the President is asked: Were you briefed on the subject of UFOs? In fact, I had Jimmy Carter on the phone about to ask him that very question (Grant called in live radio program). For whatever reason, they came back on the air and said they would not take the question. I think Jimmy Carter knew what the question would be and he told the host he was not going to take the question. So, they know it's a very touchy thing and it confirms that inside the government there is something official going on. That's why we use the word 'briefing.' Clark understood what Rudiak was asking. The same as when I asked Dick Cheney (Vice President in bush Administration). I asked him if in his government jobs had he ever been briefed on the subject of UFOs? If so, when was it and what were you told?' That's when he stumbled and said, 'If I had been briefed,' - and he knew what the word meant - 'if I had been briefed on that subject, it probably would have been classified and I would not be talking about it.' That basically confirmed to me there is something to it. But no reporters picked up on Cheney saying that the subject of UFOs was probably classified. But it's just a matter of getting somebody at the right time and then some reporter following up with: Is there some truth? What were you told in your briefing? For example, there was a question asked Gerald Ford about what date was he briefed about UFOs? He said, 'I'm never going to confirm that I was briefed. Don't even go there.' So, it's the whole thing that once you have a briefing and he confirms he has been briefed, then you can go to the White House and say, 'I want the date of the briefing.' He was briefed and you should be able to get an official time and date. But you can go to Presidential Archives and you can check all you want and there is no record .\" More Information: For a review of alleged government documents that discuss extraterrestrial biological entities and technologies, click on The Majestic Documents.
